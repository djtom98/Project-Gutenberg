Other travellers, no doubt, have gone further, but\r\nnone who have escaped with their lives have fared worse.... Mr. Landor\r\ntells a plain and manly tale, without affectation or bravado. It is a\r\nbook, certainly, that will be read with interest and excitement."\r\n\r\n_Athenaeum_: "The account he has written of his travels and adventures is\r\nvivid and often fascinating. His frequent notices of curious customs are\r\nfull of interest, and numerous illustrations from photographs or sketches\r\ntaken on the spot render this one of the most attractive records of\r\ntravel published recently."\r\n\r\n_Guardian_: "Life, according to Mr. Landor, has \'barely a dull moment,\'\r\nand the gloomiest of us will admit that this is at least true of that\r\npart of life which may be devoted to the reading of his latest book."\r\n\r\n_World_: "He has contrived, even in circumstances of cruel disadvantage,\r\nto present a wonderfully minute and impressive series of pictures of the\r\nlife, manners, and customs of the Tibetans. No less powerful and vivid\r\nare his descriptions of the scenery and natural phenomena of the\r\nForbidden Land, which are reinforced by an ample series of illustrations\r\nthat attain a high standard of artistic excellence. Mr. Landor\'s bitter\r\nexperiences have had at least the advantage of providing him with\r\nmaterial for the most absorbing travel book produced within recent\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\n_Daily Telegraph_: "Mr. Landor\'s story is one of the most extraordinary\r\ntales of modern times, yet even the most sceptical reader will admire the\r\nvigour with which it is told, and the endurance with which the explorer\r\nand his faithful servants bore up against their savage captors."\r\n\r\n_Standard_: "The book fascinates ... The verbal pictures it gives are\r\nextremely vivid, and the effect of them is greatly heightened by the\r\nnumerous drawings and photographs by the author. Mr. Landor is an artist\r\nas well as traveller and writer, and he knows how to use his pencil and\r\nbrush to emphasise his letter-press. Whatever may be said of the wisdom\r\nof his enterprises, his book is certainly a remarkable contribution to\r\nthe literature of modern travel."\r\n\r\n_Daily News_: "The great library of travel in the East has not received\r\nfor many a year a more important addition than this bright, picturesque,\r\nand instructive volume."\r\n\r\n_Daily Chronicle_: "Mr. Landor is an artist as well as a writer, and this\r\nhandsome volume is most lavishly illustrated with sketches and\r\nphotographs. Apart from its intense interest as a story of stirring\r\nadventure, the book is a valuable storehouse of information on Southern\r\nTibet and its people, and on the little known Indian district of Northern\r\nKumaon. This is surely a record of devotion to geographical science such\r\nas no previous explorer has been able to show."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.

It is illustrated\r\npartly from my photographs and partly from sketches made by me on the\r\nspot. Only as regards the torture scenes have I had to draw from memory,\r\nbut it will be easily conceded that their impression must be vivid enough\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nThe map is made entirely from my surveys of an area of twelve thousand\r\nfive hundred square miles in Tibet proper. In Chapter VI. the altitudes\r\nof such high peaks in India as Nanda Devi and others are taken from the\r\nTrigonometrical Survey, and so are the positions fixed by astronomical\r\nobservations of the starting and terminating points of my surveys at the\r\nplaces where I entered and left Tibet.\r\n\r\nIn the orthography of geographical names I have adopted the course\r\nadvised by the Royal Geographical Society--viz., to give the names their\r\ntrue sound as they are locally pronounced, and I have made no exception\r\neven for the grand and poetic "Himahlya" which is in English usually\r\ndistorted into the unmusical and unromantic word "Himalayas."\r\n\r\nI submit with all deference the following geographical results of my\r\nexpedition:\r\n\r\nThe solution of the uncertainty regarding the division of the Mansarowar\r\nand Rakstal Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to so great an altitude as 22,000 feet, and the pictures of\r\nsome of the great Himahlyan glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe visit to and the fixing of the position of the two principal sources\r\nof the Brahmaputra, never before reached by a European.\r\n\r\nThe fact that with only two men I was able to travel for so long in the\r\nmost populated part of Tibet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I am glad to state that owing to the publicity\r\nwhich I gave on my return to the outrageous Tibetan abuses taking place\r\non British soil, the Government of India at last, in the summer of 1898,\r\nnotified the Tibetan authorities that they will no longer be permitted to\r\ncollect Land Revenue from British subjects there. This fact gives me\r\nspecial satisfaction, because of the exceptional courtesy and kindness\r\nbestowed on me by our mountain tribesmen, the Shokas.\r\n\r\nThe Government Report of the official Investigation of my case, as well\r\nas other documents substantiating the details of my narrative, are\r\nprinted in an appendix.\r\n\r\nA.

The Russian Government had readily granted me a special\r\npermission to take free of duty through their territory my firearms,\r\nammunition, provisions, photographic cameras, surveying and other\r\nscientific instruments, and moreover informed me, through H.E. Sir\r\nNicholas O\'Conor, then our Ambassador in St. Petersburg, that I should be\r\nprivileged to travel on the military railway through Turkestan, as far as\r\nthe terminus at Samarakand. I feel under a great obligation to the\r\nRussian Embassy in London for the extreme courtesy shown me, and I desire\r\nto acknowledge this at the outset, especially because that route might\r\nvery likely have saved me much of the suffering and disappointment I was\r\nsubjected to through going by way of India.\r\n\r\nI was provided with introductions and credentials from the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, the British Museum of Natural History, etc., I was carrying\r\nscientific instruments for the Royal Geographical Society, and I had a\r\nBritish and two Chinese passports.\r\n\r\nHaving forwarded all my explosives by an ammunition vessel to Russia (the\r\nGerman railways absolutely refusing to carry cartridges), I heard to my\r\ndismay, only a few days previous to leaving London, that the steamer had\r\nstranded just before reaching her port of destination, and that grave\r\ndoubts were entertained as to the possibility of saving even a portion of\r\nher cargo. This was at the time of the outbreak of the Turco-Greek War,\r\nand the Russians were reported to be mobilising their troops along the\r\nAfghan frontier. I did not wish to delay my journey, and although my\r\npreparations were complete for going through Russia, I nevertheless\r\ndecided to abandon that plan and go to India, with a view to penetrating\r\nover the Himahlya into Tibet. I sailed for India on March 19, on the P.\r\nand O. ss. _Peninsular_, and reached Bombay three weeks later.\r\n\r\nIt was my first visit to India, and my first impression was certainly not\r\na good one. The heat was intense, and signs of the plague were\r\ndiscernible everywhere. The streets were deserted and the hotels bad and\r\ndirty for want of servants, who had abandoned the town in fear of the\r\nscourge.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a Parsee friend, I went to several of the districts of\r\nBombay chiefly affected by the disease, but I noticed, wherever I went,\r\nlittle else than a strong odour of disinfectants. It is true there were\r\nfew houses in those parts which had not ten, twenty, and even more\r\ncircular red marks, denoting as many deaths, and on one door, which I\r\nphotographed, I counted no less than forty-nine circles. But I was unable\r\nto gauge personally with any sort of accuracy the nature or extent of the\r\ndisease, beyond seeing in the hospitals a few violent cases of bubonic\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nOn the day following my arrival in Bombay, I proceeded by rail to\r\nBareilly, which was reached in three days, and from there one more night\r\nbrought me to Kathgodam, the terminus of the railway line. Travelling\r\npartly by Tonga (a two-wheeled vehicle drawn by two horses) and partly on\r\nhorseback, I found myself at last at Naini Tal, a hill station in the\r\nlower Himahlyas and the summer seat of the Government of the North-West\r\nProvinces and Oudh, from whence I wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\ninforming him of my intention to proceed to Tibet. I also called on the\r\nDeputy-Commissioner and made him fully acquainted with my plans. Neither\r\none nor the other of these gentlemen raised the slightest objection to my\r\nintended journey into the sacred Land of the Lamas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     Loads--A set of useful pack-saddle cases--Provisions and\r\n     scientific outfit--Clothes and shoes--Medicines--Under way--The\r\n     first march--Servants--How I came to employ faithful Chanden\r\n     Sing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI KNEW that from Naini Tal, 6407 feet (sixty feet above lake level), all\r\nmy loads would have to be transported on the backs of coolies, and\r\ntherefore they had to be divided into equal weights not exceeding\r\ntwenty-five seers, or fifty pounds. I packed instruments, negatives, and\r\narticles liable to get damaged, in cases of my own make designed\r\nespecially for rough usage. A set of four such cases, of well-seasoned\r\ndeal wood, carefully joined and fitted, zinc-lined, and soaked in a\r\nspecial preparation of mine by which they were rendered water and air\r\ntight, could be made useful in many ways. Taken separately, they could be\r\nused as seats; four placed in a row answered the purpose of bedstead;\r\nthree could be used as seat and table; and the combination of four used\r\nin a certain manner made a punt or boat of quick, solid, and easy\r\nconstruction, by which an unfordable river could be crossed or soundings\r\ntaken in the still waters of a lake. The cases could also be used as\r\nbaths for myself and my followers (if I could induce these to so far\r\nindulge), and also in the developing of my negatives as tanks to properly\r\nwash my plates. I conjectured even that in case of emergency they might\r\nserve as water casks in arid regions, if I should have to traverse any.\r\nOne of these boxes packed was exactly a coolie load, and two could be\r\neasily slung over a pack-saddle by means of straps and rings. It was due\r\nmainly to the stoutness and strength of these cases that, notwithstanding\r\nthe amount of knocking about they got, my photographic and painting work,\r\nas well as my maps, instruments, etc., were really in no way injured\r\nuntil we fell into the hands of the Tibetans. Fortunately, the most\r\nimportant part of my work, from a scientific point of view, had already\r\nbeen accomplished. My provisions were prepared for me by the Bovril\r\nCompany after instructions furnished by me, with a view to the severe\r\nTibetan climate and the altitudes we should find ourselves in. They\r\ncontained a vast amount of fat and carbonaceous food, as well as\r\ningredients easily digestible and calculated to maintain one\'s strength\r\neven in moments of unusual stress. I had them packed in tin cases and\r\nskin bags. I carried in a water-tight box 1000 cartridges for my 256 deg.\r\nMannlicher rifle, besides 500 cartridges for my revolver, and a number of\r\nhunting knives, skinning implements, wire traps of several sizes for\r\ncapturing small mammals, butterfly nets, bottles for preserving reptiles\r\nin alcohol, insect-killing bottles (cyanide of potassium), a quantity of\r\narsenical soap, bone nippers, scalpels, and all other accessories\r\nnecessary for the collection of natural history specimens. There were\r\nthree sets of photographic apparatus in my outfit, and one hundred and\r\nfifty-eight dozen dry plates, as well as all adjuncts for the developing,\r\nfixing, etc. of the negatives as they were taken. The collecting\r\nmaterials were given me by the British Museum of Natural History, to\r\nwhich institution I had promised to present all specimens of fauna and\r\nflora I might collect during my journey. I had two sets of instruments\r\nfor astronomical observation and for use in surveying (one of which had\r\nbeen furnished me by the Royal Geographical Society), such as the\r\nsix-inch sextant, hypsometrical apparatus for measuring heights, with\r\nboiling-point thermometers specially constructed for very great\r\naltitudes; two aneroids, one to 20,000 feet, the other to 25,000 feet;\r\nthree artificial horizons (one mercury, the others plate-glass with\r\nlevels); a powerful telescope with astronomical eyepiece and stand; a\r\nprismatic, a luminous, a floating, and two pocket compasses; maximum and\r\nminimum thermometers, a case of drawing instruments, protractors,\r\nparallel rules, tape rules, a silver water-tight half-chronometer watch\r\nand three other watches, section paper in books and in large sheets,\r\nRaper\'s and the Nautical Almanac for 1897 and 1898.\r\n\r\nNot to neglect the artistic aspect of my expedition, I had provided\r\nmyself with ample painting and drawing materials, and I trust to the\r\nappearance of my sketches in these volumes to prove that I did not carry\r\nthem in vain.\r\n\r\nI was provided with a very light mountain _tente-d\'abri_ seven feet long,\r\nfour feet wide, and three feet high. Well accustomed to the sort of\r\ntravelling I was in for, I decided that I required for myself only a\r\ncamel-hair blanket in the way of bedding. I reduced my clothing also to a\r\nminimum and made no difference in it from start to finish. The only thing\r\nI ever missed was my straw hat, which I wore up in the Himahlyas just as\r\nI had worn it in the broiling plains, because it seemed to me always the\r\nmost comfortable headgear. It was rendered unwearable through the\r\nclumsiness of one of my Shokas to whom I had lent it to carry in it some\r\nswan eggs (presented by a friendly Shoka), and who fell with it, or on\r\nit, to the detriment and destruction both of vessel and load. After that\r\nI generally went about with my head uncovered, as I only had a small cap\r\nleft, which was not comfortable. I wore medium thick shoes without nails,\r\nand never carried a stick, and I think it was due largely to the\r\nsimplicity of my personal equipment that I was able, as will be seen\r\npresently, to climb to one of the greatest altitudes ever reached by a\r\nhuman being.[1]\r\n\r\nMy provision of medicines cost me only half-a-crown, firm as I am in the\r\nbelief that man, living naturally under natural conditions, and giving\r\nhimself plenty of exercise, can be helped very little by drugs.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I started.\r\n\r\nOn the first day I rode from Naini Tal to Almora, thirty miles by the\r\nlower and well-known road _via_ Khairna.\r\n\r\nAlmora (5510 feet) is the last hill station towards the frontier where I\r\nexpected to find a European, or rather an Anglo-Indian, community, and I\r\nmade it my headquarters for a few days. It was my intention to obtain\r\nsome reliable hill men, possibly Gourkhas, to accompany me. I applied in\r\nvain for this purpose to the Lieut.-Colonel of the 1st 3rd Gourkha\r\nRegiment quartered in the station, duly showing letters, introductions,\r\nand documents from the highest authorities and institutions in England,\r\nplainly demonstrating the scientific object of my journey to Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe superior authorities seemed open to negotiations had I been able to\r\nafford a wait of several months; but, as this would have involved the\r\npostponement of my journey for a year on account of the passes leading\r\ninto Tibet becoming impassable at the end of the summer, I decided to\r\nsnap my fingers at all the red tape the job required, and to start on my\r\njourney without the Gourkhas.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, I came across a gentleman at Almora, a Mr. J.\r\nLarkin, who showed me great politeness and gave me much useful\r\ninformation with regard to the roads, the mode of travelling, etc. on the\r\nBritish side of the Tibetan frontier. He had himself travelled nearly up\r\nto the boundary the previous year, and knew that part of Kumaon better\r\nthan any Anglo-Indian in the province. In fact, with the exception of\r\nColonel Grigg, Commissioner of Kumaon, Mr. Larkin is the only other\r\nofficial who has any knowledge at all of the north-east of Kumaon, now so\r\nneglected by the Government of the N.W.P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY FAITHFUL COMPANION]\r\n\r\nGourkhas being unobtainable, the question weighed heavily on my mind of\r\nobtaining plucky, honest, wiry, healthy servants, of whatever caste they\r\nmight be, who would be ready for the sake of a good salary and a handsome\r\nreward to brave the many discomforts, hardships, and perils my expedition\r\nwas likely to involve. Both at Naini Tal and here scores of servants and\r\nShikaris (sporting attendants) offered themselves. They one and all\r\nproduced "certificates" of good conduct, irreproachable honesty,\r\ngood-nature and willingness to work, and praises unbounded of all\r\npossible virtues that a servant could possess. Each certificate was duly\r\nornamented with the signature of a General, a Captain, a Lieut.-Governor,\r\nor some other considerable personage, but each bearer of such testimonial\r\nseemed sadly neglected by those who had been so enthusiastically pleased\r\nwith his services, for he invariably commenced by asking for a loan of\r\nseveral rupees to purchase boots and blankets, and to enable him to\r\nsupport a wife with or without a family whom he would be leaving behind.\r\n\r\nI decided that my means did not permit of my supporting "the dear ones at\r\nhome" of the two or three dozen followers I should require, and I made up\r\nmy mind to wait and see whether I could not find men to suit me farther\r\non my road without involving myself in the liability of supporting the\r\nentire population I left behind me. I made only one exception. I was\r\nsitting one fine day in my room at the Dak Bungalow (post resting-house)\r\nwhen an odd creature entered and offered his services, salaaming me.\r\n\r\n"Where are your certificates?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"_Sahib, hum \'certificates\' ne hai!_" ("Sir, I have no certificates.")\r\n\r\n"Well, then I may employ you."\r\n\r\nI had previously had a good look at the fellow. His facial lines showed\r\nconsiderably more character and force than I had noticed in the features\r\nof other local natives. His attire was peculiar. He wore a white turban,\r\nand from under a short velvet waistcoat there protruded a gaudy flannel\r\nshirt in yellow and black stripes, which he wore oddly outside of his\r\npyjamas instead of in them. He had no shoes, and carried in his right\r\nhand an old cricket stump, with which he "presented arms," as it were,\r\nevery time that I came in and went out of the room. I at once decided to\r\ntry him. It was about nine o\'clock in the morning, when I, having many\r\npeople to see, handed Chanden Sing, for that was his name, a pair of\r\nshoes and some blacking.\r\n\r\n"Mind I find them clean when I return."\r\n\r\n"_Acha, Sahib_." ("All right, sir!")\r\n\r\n"You will find some brushes in my room."\r\n\r\n"_Bahut acha, Sahib_." ("Very good, sir!")\r\n\r\nI left. At six p.m. when I returned to my quarters I found Chanden Sing\r\nstill polishing my footgear with all his might. He had been at it the\r\nwhole day and had used for the purpose my best hair and clothes brushes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you _budmash! crab log, pagal!_" ("Oh! you bad character! bad man,\r\nfool!") I exclaimed, disgusted, making as much display as possible of the\r\nonly three or four words I then knew of Hindustani. I snatched the\r\nblackened articles of toilet out of his hands, while he, with an air of\r\nwounded feelings, pointed out the wonderful results he had achieved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY START FROM NAINI TAL]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Chanden Sing was not much of a valet, neither was he a\r\nmaster at opening soda-water bottles. He generally managed to give you a\r\nspray bath if he did not actually shoot the flying cork in your face. It\r\nwas owing to one (by no means the first) of these accidents that Chanden\r\nSing, having hit me full, was a few days later flung bodily out of the\r\nfront door. I am very adverse to the habit of punishing the natives\r\ninjudiciously and unjustly, but I believe that firm if not too severe a\r\npunishment administered in time is absolutely necessary with native\r\nservants, and generally saves much trouble and unpleasantness in the end.\r\nAnyhow Chanden Sing, none the worse, returned the next day to fetch his\r\ncricket stump which he had forgotten in his hurried and involuntary\r\ndeparture. He seized this opportunity to offer his humblest apologies for\r\nhis clumsiness, and produced the following letter which he had got\r\nwritten in English by a Babu in the Bazaar:\r\n\r\n     "DEAR SIR,--I am a stupid man, but I hear you intend to take two\r\n     Gourkha soldiers with you to Tibet. I am a good and very _stout_\r\n     man and therefore far superior to any Gourkha. Please employ me.\r\n\r\n     "Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n     "CHANDEN SING."\r\n\r\nThis was touching, and I forgave him and allowed him to stay. He improved\r\nas time went on, and after a while became quite tolerable. One morning\r\nMr. Larkin called when Chanden Sing happened to be about.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" said Larkin.\r\n\r\n"That is my bearer."\r\n\r\n"But he is not a bearer! He was once a policeman, and a smart fellow too.\r\nHe worked out a good case in his own village and had many people arrested\r\nand convicted for theft. As a reward they sacked him."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of taking him with me."\r\n\r\n"He is a good lad," replied Mr. Larkin. "You can anyhow take him as far\r\nas the frontier, but I would not advise you to take him into Tibet."\r\n\r\nMr. Larkin counselled Chanden Sing to be diligent and attentive, and the\r\nex-policeman beamed all over with joy when I told him definitely that he\r\nmight accompany me to Bhot. He turned out to be the one plucky man among\r\nall my followers, and he stood by me through thick and thin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix. Letter by Dr. H. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     Pithoragarh--Fakir women--A well-ventilated abode--Askote--The\r\n     Rajiwar and his people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE country up to Bhot is comparatively well-known, therefore I will not\r\ndwell at length on the first portion of my journey.\r\n\r\nOn May 9 all my baggage, accompanied by two _Chaprassis_, left on its way\r\nto the frontier, and I followed on the next day. Two days\' marching, at\r\nthe rate of twenty-five miles a day, brought me to Shor, otherwise called\r\nPithoragarh.\r\n\r\nThe road is good all the way, running through thick forests of pine and\r\nfir trees, and you get here and there pretty views of wooded mountain\r\nranges. Nevertheless, it is tiring owing to the many ascents and\r\ndescents, as will be seen from the following figures showing the\r\nprincipal elevations. From 5510 feet we climbed to 7650 feet, descended\r\nto 2475 feet, climbed again up to 6020 feet at Gangoli Hat, and\r\nre-descended by a steep incline to 2500 feet. The intense heat prevented\r\nme from walking at my usual pace, and I did not, therefore, reach my\r\ndestination before sundown. Walking on in the dark, we saw the distant\r\nflickering forest fires crawling here and there like incandescent snakes\r\nalong or up the mountain-side: these are caused by the igniting of the\r\ngrass, shrubs, and undergrowth by the natives, the flames not\r\nunfrequently spreading and playing havoc among the finest trees of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAt Pithoragarh (6650 feet) there is the old London Gourkha fort to be\r\nseen, on a hilltop, also a well-kept leper hospital, a school, and a\r\nmission-house. The soil is fertile and there are many stretches of\r\nwell-cultivated land dotted with habitations. Water is plentiful, and\r\nthough the scenery certainly lacks trees except in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the villages and houses, it has, nevertheless, a\r\ncertain picturesqueness on account of its background of wooded mountains.\r\nI started from Pithoragarh at 6.30 A.M.; leaving the road to Tal on the\r\nleft, I followed the track at a medium elevation of 6250 feet, arriving\r\nat Shadgora (6350 feet) just in time to witness the blessing of a calf by\r\na Brahmin. Inside a diminutive shrine--into the door of which I was\r\ncurious enough to peep--I discovered two skinny, repulsive old women,\r\nwith sunken, discoloured eyes, untidy locks of scanty hair, long\r\nunwashed, bony arms and legs, and finger and toe nails of abnormal\r\nlength. They were clad in a few dirty rags, and were busily attending to\r\nthe lights burning on several primitive stone candlesticks along the\r\nwalls of the shrine. There were also some curiously-shaped stones\r\nstanding upright among the candlesticks. The ceiling of this place of\r\nworship was not high enough to allow the women to stand, and they were\r\ncompelled to crawl about inside on all fours. When they saw me they\r\nstretched out their angular arms towards me, begging for money. I gave\r\nthem a silver coin, which they shoved under one of the peculiar stones,\r\nand then, turning round, immediately made violent gestures suggesting to\r\nme that I was to depart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE AT PITHORAGARH]\r\n\r\nFarther on I came upon a point where three roads branched off to Deolthal\r\n(six miles) on the left, to Askote (twelve and three-quarter miles) in\r\nthe centre, and to Pithoragarh (eleven and a quarter miles), a different\r\nroute from the one followed, on the right. I took the middle one, and\r\ntravelled on in a storm of hail and wind with a constant deafening roar\r\nof thunder and splendid flashes of lightning, which produced magical\r\neffects on the ever-changing and fantastic clouds and the weird\r\nmountain-sides along which I ploughed my way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEPERS SHOWING STUMPS OF LIMBS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY ABODE AT ASKOTE]\r\n\r\nI arrived late in the evening at Askote, where there is neither Dak\r\nBungalow nor Daramsalla,[2] and found to my disgust that none of my\r\ncarriers had yet arrived. I was offered hospitality by Pundit Jibanand,\r\nwho put me up in his schoolroom, a structure consisting of a number of\r\nplanks put together regardless of width, height, length, or shape, and\r\nsupporting a roof of straw and grass. The ventilation of my abode was all\r\none could wish for, and as during the night I lay wrapped up in my\r\nblanket under the sheltering roof, I could admire through the\r\ndisconnected portions of the walls the brilliancy of the star-studded\r\nheaven above. When the sun arose, bits of scenery appeared between plank\r\nand plank, until by degrees the gaps were all stopped up by figures of\r\nnatives, who took possession of these points of vantage to gaze to their\r\nhearts\' content on the sahib, who, with signs of evident suspense on the\r\npart of these spectators, managed even to shave. Hilarity, on the other\r\nhand, was caused when I smeared myself all over with soap while bathing.\r\nAdmiration followed at my putting on my last starched shirt and other\r\nmysterious garments, but the excitement grew almost to fever-heat when I\r\nwent through the daily nuisance of winding up my watches and registering\r\ndaily observations of temperature, etc. The strain was too much, I fancy,\r\nand a general stampede followed the moment I touched my unloaded rifle.\r\n\r\nThe town of Askote is not unlike an old feudal castle such as are found\r\nin many parts of Central Italy. Perched on the crown of a central hill,\r\nthe Rajiwar\'s palace overlooks a fine panorama of mountains encircling it\r\non all sides. Among the higher peaks discernible from the palace are the\r\nChipla Mountain and the Dafia. Then across the Kali River, forming the\r\nboundary of Nepal, is Mount Dooti. The "_gown_" or town itself numbers\r\nsome two hundred houses scattered on the slope of the hill, and includes\r\na school, a post-office, and two Mahommedan shops. The Rajiwar had on my\r\narrival just completed building a new Court, a simple and dignified\r\nstructure of brown stone, with fine wooden carvings on the windows and\r\ndoors, and with chimneys in European fashion in each room. One wall in\r\neach room was left open, and formed a charming verandah, commanding a\r\nmagnificent view of mountain scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Rajiwar of Askote occupies a unique position in Kumaon. Having\r\nrepurchased his right to the tenure of land in the Askote Pargana as late\r\nas 1855, he now possesses the right of _zamindar_ (translated literally,\r\n_landed proprietor_), and he is the only person to whom has been granted\r\nto retain this privilege in the Kumaon Division. Jagat Sing Pal, the\r\nRajiwar\'s nephew, assured me that the people of the Askote Pargana are\r\nbrave and good-natured. They never give any trouble to the Rajiwar, who,\r\non the other hand, is almost a father to them. They apply to him in every\r\ndifficulty, in sickness and distress, and he looks after them in true\r\npatriarchal fashion. The Rajiwar is not rich, probably because he spends\r\nso much for the benefit of his people and of the strangers who pass\r\nthrough Askote. Many of these are little more than beggars, of course,\r\neven when they travel as fakirs, or other religious fanatics, going to or\r\nreturning from the sacred Mansarowar Lake in Tibet. The present\r\nRajiwar,[3] Pushkar Pal, belongs to the Ramchanda family, and he is a\r\ndescendant of the Solar dynasty. His ancestors lived in Aoudh or Ayodye\r\n(as it was formerly called), whence they migrated to the hills of Katyur\r\nin Kumaon, where they built a palace. The hill regions up to Killakanjia\r\nand the Jumua River were under the Raja of Katyur\'s rule, he assuming the\r\ntitle of Maharaja. A branch of the family came from Katyur to Askote, its\r\nchief retaining the hereditary title of Rajiwar beside that of Pal, which\r\neach male assumes. The Rajiwar pays a yearly tribute of 1800 rupees to\r\nthe Government of India. In the time of the Gourkhas he paid nothing\r\nexcept occasional gifts of _Nafas_ or musk-deer to his neighbour the King\r\nof Nepal, with whom he is still in very close relation. He was then\r\npractically an independent king. Still Rajiwar Pushkar Pal has always\r\nbeen perfectly loyal to the Government of India.\r\n\r\n"Are the people very obsequious to the Rajiwar?" I asked of Jagat Sing\r\nPal.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. For instance, when the Rajiwar sits on his _Karoka_ (a kind of\r\nthrone) he is saluted with a particularly respectful salaam. His subjects\r\nbring their hand up to the forehead and support the elbow with the left\r\nhand, as a sign that this salutation is so weighty that it requires the\r\nsupport of the other hand."\r\n\r\nAt Court functions, the male relatives, friends, and servants sit near\r\nthe Rajiwar, his brother first, his son next, then his nephews, etc.\r\nWomen are of course not admitted, and although no strict code of\r\netiquette exists, the Rajiwar and his family are nevertheless always\r\ntreated with Eastern deference.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Daramsalla_, a stone-walled shelter for the use of travellers and\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n[3] _Rajiwar:_ head of kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     The Raots--A slippery journey--Superstitious notions--Anger and\r\n     jealousy--Friends--To the homes of the\r\n     savages--Photography--Habitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A YOUNG MAN]\r\n\r\nWE had walked seventy-eight miles in three marches, and my men being\r\nfootsore, I gave them a day\'s rest, which I employed in going to the\r\nhaunts of the "Wild men of the forest," or _Raots_ or _Rajis_, as they\r\nstyle themselves. They live in the woods several miles off, and to reach\r\nthem I had to descend a steep incline covered by an uncommonly slippery\r\ncarpet of dried grass and pine needles. I had to take off shoes and\r\nstockings to get along, and even bare-footed I found it difficult to\r\nmaintain my hold. I was accompanied by one of my chaprassis and a man\r\nfrom Askote, and we were forced down more swiftly than comfortably till\r\nwe reached a faint track, which we followed until we came upon a man\r\nhiding behind some trees. He was a wild-looking creature, naked and\r\nunkempt, with flowing hair and scanty beard and moustache, and, regarding\r\nus with an air of suspicion, he was most reluctant to show us the way to\r\nthe homes of his tribe. He was a Raot, and his reluctance to let us\r\napproach his home seemed justified enough when he said to my guide, "No\r\nwhite man has ever visited our home, and should one ever come we shall\r\nall die. The spirits of the mountains will prevent your progress--not we.\r\nYou will suffer pain, for the spirit who watches over the Raots will let\r\nno one enter their homes."\r\n\r\nI gave the man a rupee, which he turned and weighed in his hand.\r\n\r\n"You can come," he muttered, "but you will regret it. You will have great\r\nmisfortune."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAOT ON TREE]\r\n\r\nThere was something so weirdly peculiar in the tone of voice in which the\r\nman spoke, as if he had been in a trance, himself only the channel\r\nthrough which the threat of some occult being was conveyed to us, that\r\nfor some minutes I could not get his words out of my head. I followed him\r\nas best I could, for he climbed up huge boulders with the agility of a\r\nmonkey. It was no easy job, for we bounded and leapt from rock to rock\r\nand vaulted over fallen trees. The track became more marked and went up\r\nalong the incline of a steep ravine. We continued until, hot and panting,\r\nwe arrived at a large hollow high up in the cliff of clay. There, on a\r\nsemicircular platform with entrenchments of felled trees, were about a\r\ndozen men almost devoid of clothing, some sitting on their heels and\r\nresting their arms on their knees, others lying down flat. One fellow\r\nsmoked dry leaves inside a pipe of Hindoo origin. I snatched a photo of\r\nthe group as, with an air of suspicion mingled with surprise and sadness,\r\nbut no apparent fear, they stared at the unexpected visitors. Two of the\r\nelder men having overcome their first stupor sprang to their feet and\r\nwith mad gesticulations refused to let me come nearer. But I penetrated\r\nright into their circle, and found myself surrounded by a sulky and angry\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAOTS]\r\n\r\n"No man has ever been here but a Raot. You will soon die. You have\r\noffended God!" screamed an old man, in a sudden outburst of temper. He\r\nbent his knees and curved his spine, protruding his head towards me. He\r\nshook his fists in my face, waved them about in the air, opened and\r\ntightly clenched them, digging his nails furiously into his palms.\r\nInstead of contracting the scalp of his forehead, the old Raot raised\r\nhis eyebrows and turned his polished forehead into a succession of deep\r\nwrinkles, stretching in a straight line across almost from ear to ear,\r\nand showing only a dark dimple over his nose. His nostrils, flat and\r\nbroad to begin with, became widely expanded and raised so as to cause two\r\ndeep lines to diverge from the nose along his cheeks. His mouth was open\r\nand a peculiar vacillation of the lower lip demonstrated plainly that its\r\nowner had but little command over speech and articulation. His eyes,\r\nwhich may have been brown originally, were discoloured, probably through\r\nthe abuse of excessive animal powers, to the possession of which the\r\nformation of his skull strongly testified, but they assumed extraordinary\r\nbrilliancy as his fury increased. He opened them wide, apparently with an\r\neffort, and showed the entire circle of his iris. The pupils were\r\ndilated, notwithstanding that the light upon his face was strong at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFollowing his example, some of the rest displayed their discontent in a\r\nsimilar fashion, but others, among whom I especially noticed two youths\r\nwith sad languishing faces, drooping large eyes, and luxuriant growth of\r\nblack hair, stood apathetically apart, with head reclining towards the\r\nright shoulder, their features perfectly composed, and supporting their\r\nchins on their hands. Even if they had overcome their stupor, they did\r\ncertainly not betray it, and appeared perfectly emotionless as far as\r\ntheir countenances were concerned.\r\n\r\nOne fellow with an extraordinary head, a mixture it seemed of a Mongolian\r\nand a Negroid type, was the first to calm himself of those who were so\r\nmadly excited. With piercing though unsteady eyes, and with nervous\r\ntwitching movements, he scrutinised my face more closely than the others,\r\nand seemed to reassure them all that I had not come to hurt them. He made\r\nsigns to the rest to desist from their threats, and then, squatting down\r\nhimself, invited me to follow his example, by sitting on my heels. When\r\nthe storm had subsided and they had all sat down, I drew out of my pocket\r\nsome coins and gave one to each of them, with the exception of one man on\r\nwhom I thought I might study the passion of jealousy in its most\r\nprimitive form. I watched the man closely, and soon saw him draw apart\r\nfrom the others and become sulky. The others were by now comparatively\r\ncalm. They seemed predisposed towards sadness, and I could with\r\ndifficulty extract from any of them more than a very faint sort of a\r\nsmile. They turned and twisted the coins in their hands, and compared\r\nthem among one another, jabbering and apparently content. The jealous man\r\nkept his head turned away from them determinedly, pretending not to see\r\nwhat was going on, and, resting his chin on his hand, he began to sing a\r\nweird, melancholy, guttural song, assuming an air of contempt, especially\r\nwhen the others chaffed him. Having allowed him to suffer enough, I gave\r\nhim two coins instead of one, and with them the satisfaction of the last\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF YOUNG MAN]\r\n\r\nI then tried to photograph them, but my camera was looked upon with\r\nsuspicion, and as plate after plate was exposed in portraying single\r\nindividuals or groups, they shuddered at each "click" of the spring.\r\n\r\n"The gods will be angry with you for doing _that_," said a Raot, pointing\r\nat the camera, "unless you give us a large white coin."\r\n\r\nI took advantage of this, and promised them as best I could through my\r\nguide "two large coins" if they would take me to their huts, some few\r\nhundred yards below the lofty eyrie in the cliff, but I must for the sum\r\nbe allowed not only to see but to touch and have explained to me anything\r\nI liked.\r\n\r\nThey consented, and we began our descent of the precipitous track leading\r\nto their habitations, a track fit really only for monkeys. Several women\r\nand children, who had come up attracted by the sight of strangers, joined\r\nwith the men in giving us a helping hand, and in fact, I believe there\r\ncannot have been a single paw in the company that did not at one time or\r\nother during the descent clutch some portion of my clothing in the\r\nfriendliest spirit. Holding on to one another, we proceeded in a body,\r\nnot always at a pleasant pace, down the dangerous cliff. Two or three\r\ntimes one of the natives or myself tripped and almost dragged the\r\nremainder of the party over the precipice, while the piercing yells and\r\nscreams of the women seemed to echo back for miles around. I was not\r\nsorry when we at last reached the small huts by the river which made up\r\ntheir village.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO MEN SITTING DOWN WITH CHILDREN]\r\n\r\nThe habitations were squalid beyond measure. Constructed with a rough\r\nframe of tree-branches, fortified by wooden posts and rafters, roofed\r\nover with a thatch of dried grass, the majority of them measured about\r\nten feet. They were built against the hillside, a strong bi-forked pole\r\nin the centre of the structure supporting the roof, and were usually\r\ndivided into two sections, so as to give shelter each of them to two\r\nfamilies. They contained no furniture, and but few utensils of the most\r\nprimitive make. There were circular wooden bowls scooped out in the past\r\nby means of sharp-edged stones, and more recently by cheap blades, which\r\nwere of Indian manufacture. For such cultivation as they were capable of\r\nthese people used primitive earth rakes, and they also possessed coarse\r\nmallets, sticks, and net bags in which they kept their stores. Their\r\nstaple food in former days was river fish, flesh of wild animals, and\r\nroots of certain trees; but they now eat grain also, and, like all\r\nsavages, they have a craving for liquor. The interior of Raot\r\nhabitations was so primitive and lacking of furniture, that it hardly\r\nrequires to be described, and the odours that emanated from these huts\r\nare also better left to the imagination of the reader.\r\n\r\nEntering one of the dwellings, I found squatted round a fire of wood some\r\nwomen and men, the women wearing silver bangles and glass bead necklaces,\r\nthe men very little more than string earrings. Only one of the men had on\r\nas much as a diminutive loin-cloth, and the women had scanty dresses of\r\nIndian manufacture, obtained in Askote.\r\n\r\nScanning their features carefully, it struck me that in their facial\r\nlines many points could be traced which would make one feel inclined to\r\nattribute to them a remote Mongolian origin, modified largely by the\r\nclimate, the nature of the country, and probably by intermarriage. In the\r\nscale of standard human races the Raots stood extremely low, as can be\r\njudged from the accompanying photographs. The women, as will be seen, had\r\nabnormally small skulls with low foreheads, and although they looked\r\ndevoid even of a glint of reason, they were actually fairly intelligent.\r\nThey had high cheek-bones; long, flattish noses, broad and rounded as in\r\nthe Mongolian type. The chin was in most instances round, very receding,\r\nthough the lips were in their normal position, thin, and very tightly\r\nclosed with up-turned corners to the mouth. The lower jaw was extremely\r\nshort and narrow, whereas the upper one seemed quite out of proportion to\r\nthe size of the skull. Their ears were large, outstanding, and\r\nunmodelled, but capable of catching sounds at great distances.\r\n\r\nThe men had better heads than the women, underdeveloped yet comparatively\r\nwell balanced. They had higher and broader foreheads, similar though\r\nshorter noses, chins not quite so receding, the whole lower jaw\r\nextraordinarily narrow, but the upper lip, as with the women, huge and\r\nout of all proportion.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the Raots are not a pure race, and even among the few I came\r\nacross variations so considerable occurred as to puzzle one in tracing\r\ntheir origin. They invariably possess luxuriant coal-black hair, which\r\nnever attains more than a moderate length. It is not coarse in texture,\r\nbut is usually so dirty that it appears coarser than it really is. They\r\nhave very little hair on their bodies except in the arm-pits, and their\r\nmoustaches and beards hardly deserve the name.\r\n\r\nThe men generally part the crop on their head in the middle, so that it\r\nflows on either side of the skull, just covering the ears, and I found\r\nthe same strange custom that I observed years ago among the Ainu of Yezo\r\nof shaving a lozenge-shaped portion of the scalp in the centre of the\r\nforehead directly above the nose. The women, using their fingers as a\r\ncomb, draw their hair to the back of the head and tie it in a knot.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the better specimens I saw were slight and agile, with no\r\nsuperfluous fat or flesh. Supple to a degree, yet solid and muscular,\r\nwith well-proportioned limbs and a skin of a rich tinge between bronze\r\nand terra-cotta colour, these savages, dirty and unclothed as they were,\r\ncertainly appealed to the artistic side of my temperament, particularly\r\non account of their very majestic deportment. I noticed their regular\r\nbreathing, which they usually did through the nose, keeping their mouths\r\ntightly closed, and also one very curious peculiarity about their feet,\r\nviz., the length of the second toe, protruding considerably beyond the\r\nothers, and giving them no doubt the power of using their toes almost as\r\nwe should our fingers. The palms of their hands were almost without\r\nlines, the finger-nails flat, and their thumbs stumpy with the last\r\nphalange curiously short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A YOUNG MAN]\r\n\r\nIf the Raots to-day have adopted some articles of clothing and ornament,\r\nbesides altering their diet to a certain extent, it is due entirely to\r\nthe Rajiwar of Askote, who, taking a great interest in the tribes he\r\nrules over, provides them in a patriarchal way with all sorts of\r\nnecessaries of life. Very few Raots have of late years visited Askote, as\r\nthey are of a retiring nature and seem contented with their primitive\r\nabodes in the forests of Chipula, which they claim as their own. Their\r\nonly occupations are fishing and hunting, and they are said to have a\r\npredilection for the flesh of the larger Himahlyan monkey, although from\r\nmy own observation I should have said that they would eat almost anything\r\nthey could get. It has generally been assumed that the Raot women are\r\nkept in strict seclusion and hidden from strangers, and I cannot better\r\nprove the absurdity of this than by reproducing in these pages one of\r\nseveral photographs of the Raot women, for which they posed at my\r\nrequest without the slightest objection from the men. They are generally\r\nbelieved to be chaste, and my photographs prove, I think, that whatever\r\ncharm they may possess for the Raot men, their peculiar beauty offers but\r\nlittle temptation to others.\r\n\r\nThey are rapidly diminishing in numbers, chiefly no doubt on account of\r\nconstant intermarriage. I was assured that the women are not sterile, but\r\nthat there is enormous mortality among the young children. They bury\r\ntheir dead, and for several days afterwards offer food and water to the\r\nspirit of the departed.\r\n\r\nI was unable to ascertain what their marriage ceremonies were like, or if\r\nthey had any to speak of, but it appeared that there was a considerable\r\nfamily feeling among couples living maritally together. They are\r\nsuperstitious and hold in curious awe the spirits of the mountains, the\r\nsun, the moon, fire, water, and wind. Whether this amounts to a definite\r\nform of worship I cannot say: I certainly saw no signs of the offering of\r\nprayers or sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe Raots claim to be the descendants of kings, and they refuse\r\nallegiance to any one. They will neither salute you nor bow to you.\r\n\r\n"It is for other people to salute us. Our blood is the blood of kings,\r\nand though for choice we have for centuries retired to the jungle, we are\r\nnone the less the sons of kings."\r\n\r\nAfter a while, and when I had spent some considerable time among them,\r\nthese royal savages seemed uncomfortable and apprehensive. I had turned\r\nover, examined, drawn or photographed every household article I had seen,\r\nhad measured every one, male and female, who consented to be measured,\r\nand paid them the stipulated money. As I was about to leave, the\r\ngrey-haired man approached me again.\r\n\r\n"You have seen the home of the Raots. You are the first stranger who has\r\ndone so, and you will suffer much. The gods are very angry with you."\r\n\r\n"Yes," rejoined another savage, pointing at the ravine, "whoever treads\r\nalong that track and is not a Raot will be afflicted by a great\r\ncalamity."\r\n\r\n"_Kush paruani, Sahib"_ ("Never mind, sir"), interrupted the guide, "they\r\nare only barbarians, they know no better. I have myself never been here,\r\nso I suppose I shall also come in for my share."\r\n\r\n"You too will suffer," said the old Raot, with self-assurance.\r\n\r\nThe Raots stood round me silently as I packed up the camera, and I felt\r\nthat they looked upon me as a man whose fate was settled. They did not\r\nacknowledge my farewell, and, had I been in the least superstitious,\r\nmight have made me thoroughly uncomfortable with their solemn, stolid\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAOT WOMEN OF THE FOREST]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     A pilgrim from Mansarowar Lake--The spirits of the mountains--A\r\n     safeguard against them--Tibetan encampments--The Rajiwar--A\r\n     waterfall--Watermills.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING returned to Askote from my excursion, I saw while going round the\r\ntown with Jagat Sing, in a low stone shed by the side of the palace, the\r\ntall gaunt figure of a man emerging from a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" I inquired of my companion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is a fakir returning from a pilgrimage to the sacred lake of\r\nMansarowar in Tibet. Many of these fanatics pass through here during the\r\nsummer on their religious journeys."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAJIWAR OF ASKOTE, HIS BROTHER AND SON]\r\n\r\nMy curiosity drew me towards the weird individual. He was over six feet\r\nin height, and his slim body had been covered with ashes, giving the dark\r\nskin a tinge of ghastly grey. I asked him to come out into the light. His\r\nmasses of long hair had been plaited into small tresses which were wound\r\nround his head in the fashion of a turban--the "_Tatta_." The hair, too,\r\nhad been whitened, while the long thin beard had been dyed bright red.\r\nHis eyes were sunken and, apparently to add to the ghastly and decidedly\r\nrepulsive effect, his forehead and cheeks were plastered with a thick\r\nwhite paint. He seemed half stupefied, and had very little to say for\r\nhimself. As can be seen by the illustration, he was scantily clothed, but\r\nhe wore the _Kamarjuri_ or fakir\'s chain about his loins, and he had a\r\nbead bracelet round his arm above the elbow. His waist was encircled with\r\na belt of wooden beads, and a necklace of plaited hair ornamented his\r\nneck. He spent his days rolling himself in ashes and enduring\r\nself-imposed bodily privations, with a view to attain a state of\r\nsanctification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAKIR RETURNING FROM MANSAROWAR]\r\n\r\nRumours had reached me of some curious superstitions prevalent among\r\nthese mountain folk.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," I said to Jagat Sing, "are there \'spirits of the mountain\' in\r\nthese ranges? And do the people really believe in them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied the young fellow, "there certainly are a number of\r\nthem, and they are often very troublesome, especially to certain people.\r\nThey are seldom known, however, to kill any one."\r\n\r\n"Then they are not quite so bad as some human beings," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, they are very bad. They seize sleeping people by the throat\r\nwith claws like iron, sitting on the chests of their victims."\r\n\r\n"Does not that sound more like an attack of indigestion?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. The ghosts of the mountains are the spirits of people that have\r\nnot gone to heaven. They are to be found in swarms at night in the\r\nforest. The people are terrified of them. They haunt the mountain-tops\r\nand slopes, and they can assume the semblance of a cat, a mouse, or any\r\nother animal; in fact they are said to frequently change their\r\nappearance. Where no man can tread, among rocks and precipices, or in the\r\nthick jungle, the spirits seek their retreat, but often they abandon\r\ntheir haunts to seek for men. The person who becomes possessed generally\r\nremains in a semi-conscious condition and ejaculates mad cries and\r\nunintelligible words. There are men who profess to know charms to draw\r\nthem out. Some remedies are for that purpose commonly used by the natives\r\nwith more or less success. A grass called _Bichna_ (nettles) has the\r\nfaculty of frightening the spirits away when applied on the body of the\r\nsufferer, but the most effective remedy is to make pretence to beat with\r\na red-hot iron the person possessed. The spirits seem to fear that more\r\nthan anything else."\r\n\r\n"Do the spirits ever speak?" I inquired, interested in the curious\r\nsuperstitions of these hill men.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, not often, nor usually directly, but they do it through people\r\nwho are possessed by them. It is they who tell many strange tales of the\r\nspirits. One curious point about them is that they only seize people who\r\nare afraid of them. If defied they vanish."\r\n\r\n"Do the natives adopt any special method to protect themselves from these\r\nmountain demons?"\r\n\r\n"Fire is the only sure protection. Any one sleeping near a fire is safe,\r\nand as long as there is a flame blazing the spirits keep away."\r\n\r\n"Do you know any one who has seen them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. A chaprassi called Joga tells of having been compelled to travel at\r\nnight through a forest: he heard a voice calling him by name. Terrified,\r\nhe stopped, and for some moments his voice failed him. At last, trembling\r\nall over, he replied, and instantly a swarm of spirits appeared and\r\nchallenged him to do them harm. Joga ran for his life and the demons\r\nvanished. Spirits have been known to throw stones at passers-by."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen a spirit, Jagat Sing?"\r\n\r\n"Only once. I was returning to the palace late in the evening when up the\r\nsteep road I perceived a woman\'s figure. It was a beautiful moonlight\r\nnight. I walked up, and as I passed, the face of the strange being\r\nappeared black, inhuman and ghastly. I staggered when I saw the weird\r\napparition approach, my blood ran cold with fear. I struck a mighty blow\r\nwith my stick, but behold! the cane whirled through the air and hit\r\nnothing. Instantly the ghost vanished."\r\n\r\n"I wish, Jagat Sing, that you could show me some of these spirits; I\r\nwould give anything to make a sketch of them."\r\n\r\n"You cannot always see them when you want, sir, but they are always to be\r\navoided. They are evil spirits and can do nothing but harm."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving Askote (4600 feet) by the winding road through a dense forest, I\r\ncrossed by a suspension bridge the Gori River at Gargia (2450 feet). The\r\ntrack was along the low and unpleasantly hot valley of the Kali River, a\r\nraging stream flowing with indescribable rapidity in the opposite\r\ndirection to that in which I was travelling. It formed the boundary line\r\nbetween Nepal and Kumaon. Huts and patches of cultivation were to be seen\r\non the Nepalese side, whereas on our side we came upon deserted and\r\nroofless winter dwellings of Shokas (usually but not correctly called\r\nBotiyas) and Tibetans, who migrate to these warmer regions to graze their\r\nsheep during the colder months of the year. The Shoka summer residences\r\nare at greater elevations, mostly along the highways to Tibet and nearer\r\nthe Tibetan boundary. On arriving at the Kutzia Daramsalla, a messenger\r\nbrought me the news that the Rajiwar, whom I had missed seeing at Askote,\r\nwas now here for the purpose of making offerings to certain deities. He\r\nwould call upon me at 3 P.M., so, having some time to spare, I went to\r\nbathe in the deliciously cold though, as I found, dangerously rapid\r\nstream. Swimming was out of the question, and even an immersion bath was\r\nattended with a certain amount of risk. The current caused me to lose my\r\nfooting, and I soon found myself washed with great force against some\r\nrocks thirty or forty yards down stream. I came out of the water _minus_\r\na few patches of skin on my knees and shins, and while drying myself in\r\nthe sun, received a deputation of the _Patan_ (head village man) and\r\nother natives, conveying with their most respectful salaams gifts of\r\nmilk, _kielas_ (bananas), _kakri_ (gigantic cucumbers), and nuts. These\r\nhill fellows impressed me as being of a far superior standard to the\r\nHindoos of the plains. They were lightly yet strongly built, and showed\r\nevidence of both character and dignity. With their fair complexion and\r\nluxuriant black hair and moustache they resembled Spaniards or Southern\r\nItalians. They lacked entirely the affected manner and falseness of\r\nspeech and demeanour, so common among the natives who are constantly in\r\ncontact with Europeans.\r\n\r\nBelow the Daramsalla, near the water-side, was a large Tibetan encampment\r\nof some twenty or thirty tents which had all originally been white, but\r\nwere now black with smoke. In these were men, women, and children, with\r\nall their paraphernalia; and the first thing that attracted my eye in\r\neach tent was the quantity of shiny brass bowls strewn upon the ground,\r\nthe entire energy of the tent-owners seemingly being spent in keeping\r\nthese utensils clean and bright, to the utter neglect of their other\r\nproperty. Walls of sheep-loads were erected either inside the tent or\r\ndirectly outside, covered in the latter case with cloths in order to\r\nprotect them from the rain.\r\n\r\nPunctually at 3 P.M. the Rajiwar arrived, carried in a _dandy_, and\r\nfollowed by his brother, who sat in a mountain dandy. The Rajiwar\'s son\r\nand heir rode a splendid grey pony. I went to assist the old Rajiwar to\r\nalight, as for some years he had been paralysed. We shook hands heartily,\r\nand I led him into the Daramsalla (2875 feet), where in default of\r\nfurniture we all sat on packing-cases. His refined, well-cut features,\r\nhis attractive manner, and the soft, dignified voice in which he spoke\r\nclearly indicated a man of superior blood and uncommon ability. His\r\nmodesty and simplicity were delightful.\r\n\r\n"I hope that your health is good and that you have not suffered too much\r\non your journey. I was grieved not to be in Askote to receive you. Are\r\nyour dear parents alive? Have you any brothers and sisters? Are you\r\nmarried? I would much like to visit England. It must be a wonderful\r\ncountry, and so much do I admire it that I have given my nephews a\r\nBritish education, and one of them is now serving the Maharanee (Queen)\r\nVictoria as Political Peshkar."\r\n\r\nI answered his questions as best I could with the aid of a Hindustani\r\ndictionary, expressive gestures, and quick sketches. He spoke of many of\r\nour latest inventions with marked interest and intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe seemed greatly struck with my scientific instruments, but he and his\r\npeople were more particularly attracted by my rifles, revolvers, and\r\nother weapons, especially the 256 deg. Mannlicher, sighted to 1000 yards.\r\n\r\nThe Rajiwar pressed me to return with him to Askote, where he offered to\r\ngive me tiger, bear, and leopard shooting. Tempting as the invitation\r\nwas, I could not accept it, for my plans would lead me in the opposite\r\ndirection. His visit lasted for more than three hours; and I was pleased\r\nto feel that we parted great friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAJIWAR AND HIS BROTHER IN DANDIES.]\r\n\r\nOn the road to Dharchula, along the low-lying valley, the heat was\r\nunbearable, although the sun was near the horizon. We came upon a\r\nwaterfall falling from a great height over a series of umbrella-like\r\nstalactites covered with moss. The last rays of the sun shone on the\r\ndropping water, brilliant and sparkling as a shower of diamonds. Several\r\nsmall rainbows added to the beauty of the scene. I rested some time in\r\nthis cool and beautiful retreat. There were birds singing and monkeys\r\nplaying among the trees. Farther on, where the river bends, there are two\r\nlarge caves hollowed in the rock; the smoke-blackened ceilings prove that\r\nthese are used as camping grounds by travelling Shokas and Hunyas\r\n(Tibetans). Large black-faced, white-bearded monkeys swarmed everywhere,\r\nfrankly and gladly mischievous. They throw or roll stones down upon the\r\npassers-by, often causing accidents, the track being rather narrow and\r\nsheer above the river.\r\n\r\nPrevious to arriving at the spot where the Tsuagar flows into the Kali\r\nRiver one meets with many Tibetan, Humli and Rongba encampments.\r\n\r\nI camped at Kalika (3205 feet) by the side of a gigantic tree with boughs\r\nspreading well over the road, the chaprassis and men erecting a\r\ncomfortable _choepper_ of mats, foliage, and branches.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to get through the hot valley with the greatest possible\r\nspeed, so, notwithstanding that we had halted very late at night, I\r\nroused my men at 3 A.M. and again set forth on the march. Here and there\r\nalong the road we passed deserted winter dwellings of Shokas, nearly all\r\nwith broken thatched roofs. Some, however, were roofed with slate, the\r\ndistinctive mark of residence of the Darma Shokas.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Shoka water-mills were curious. By a very ingenious\r\ncontrivance the water of a stream propelled a heavy cylindrical stone\r\nrevolving on the top of another. The grain fell slowly from a magazine\r\nabove into a hole pierced in the centre of the upper wheel, and finding\r\nits way through a channel between the two cylinders, was ground into fine\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nDharchula (3550 _feet_) the largest Shoka winter settlement, is situated\r\non a fine stretch of flat land some hundred feet above the river; the\r\nvillage consists of twelve long rows of roofless houses very similar in\r\nsize and shape. Four larger buildings at the extreme limit of the\r\nsettlement attract notice. One of these is a Daramsalla. The others, two\r\nhigh stone buildings, are a school, hospital and dispensary belonging to\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal Mission and under the careful supervision of Miss\r\nSheldon, M.D., Miss Brown, and that wonderful pioneer, Dr. H. Wilson. A\r\nbungalow of the same mission is built higher up on the hillside.\r\n\r\nBetween the two spots where from Nepal the Lachu and the Shakta join the\r\nKali, was Dubart (3700 feet), and from thence one gradually rose to 4120\r\nfeet at the Relegar River, also a tributary of the larger stream. Having\r\ncrossed the Rankuti River I ascended still higher by zigzag walking,\r\nslowly leaving behind me range after range of mountains beyond the valley\r\nof the river; while on the Nepal side, beyond the three nearer ranges,\r\nsnow peaks of great height and beauty stood out against the sky-line. The\r\nhighest point on the road was 5450 feet, after which we descended to 5275\r\nfeet at Khela Daramsalla, which we did not reach till late at night.\r\n\r\nNear Khela on the top of a high mountain stood a tall quadrangular rock\r\nnot unlike a tower. The natives say that a mere touch causes it to shake\r\nand revolve, but this belief is not general, for others deny that it ever\r\nmoves. I could not spare the time to go and test the facts, nor could I\r\nobtain reliable information from any one who had had actual experience.\r\nSo far as I could see with the aid of my telescope, the rock seemed to be\r\nstanding firmly on a very solid base. To my regret also, I was unable to\r\nvisit the curious hot sulphur springs on the Darma Ganga, and the strange\r\ncave in which much animal life is lost owing to the noxious gases rising\r\nfrom the ground. I gathered from various reports that this cave or grotto\r\nis packed with skeletons of birds and quadrupeds who have unknowingly\r\nentered this chamber of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n     Highways and trade routes--The Darma route--The Dholi River--A\r\n     rough track connecting two valleys--Glaciers--Three ranges and\r\n     their peaks--Altitudes--_Darma, Johar_, and the _Painkhanda_\r\n     Parganas--The highest peak in the British Empire--Natural\r\n     boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are two principal highways from Khela to Hundes: one by the valley\r\nof the Dholi or Darma River, the other along the Kali River and over the\r\nLippu Pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE HIMAHLYAS--SHOWING NANDA DEVI AND TRISUL\r\nPEAKS]\r\n\r\nThe trade route _via_ Darma is less frequented than the one by the Lippu,\r\nbut it is nevertheless of considerable importance, inasmuch as a certain\r\nportion of the trade of South-west Tibet with India is carried on through\r\nthe medium of the Darma Shokas. It consists mainly of borax, salt, wool,\r\nskins, cloth, and utensils, in exchange for which the Tibetans take\r\nsilver, wheat, rice, _satoo_, _ghur_, lump candied sugar, pepper, beads\r\nof all kinds, and articles of Indian manufacture. For a mountain track,\r\nand considering the altitudes to which it rises, the Darma way is\r\ncomparatively good and safe, notwithstanding that in following upwards\r\nthe course of the Dholi River the narrow path in many places overhangs\r\ndeep ravines and precipices. There are many Shoka villages and\r\nsettlements on the banks of the stream, the most important ones being the\r\nNyu, Sobala, Sela, Nagling (9520 feet), Bahling (10,230 feet), Sona and\r\nTuktung (10,630 feet), Dansu and Yansu, where there is a bridge. On the\r\nnorth-east bank is Goa, facing Dakar, and farther up, at an elevation of\r\n10,400 feet, the Lissar, a rapid tributary with muddy water.\r\n\r\nThe Dholi springs from a series of comparatively small glaciers\r\nnorth-east of a range forming a branch of the higher Himahlyan chain, and\r\nextending in a south-easterly direction as far as the point where the two\r\nstreams meet. It receives, on its precipitous descent, many small\r\nsnow-fed tributaries, those from the Katz snowfields and the Nui glacier\r\nbeing the most important. Its way lies in a tortuous channel amidst rocks\r\nand ravines, first tending towards the South-East, then due South, and\r\nlast South-West down to the point where it is joined by the Lissar,\r\ncoming from the North-West along a line almost parallel on the opposite\r\nwatershed of the range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DARMA SHOKAS AND TIBETANS]\r\n\r\nTyang, Sipu (11,400 feet), and Marcha (10,890 feet), are the three most\r\nimportant Shoka villages on the Lissar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE HIMAHLYAS. SHOWING NANDA DEVI AND TRISUL\r\nPEAKS.]\r\n\r\nFrom Marcha there is a track connecting the valleys of the Lissar and\r\nGori. You ascend the high mountain range west of the Lissar by skirting\r\nthe northern edge of the Nipchung Kang glacier and keeping south of the\r\nKharsa glacier, and, on a route that is unpopular on account of its\r\nconstant difficulties and perils, you pass, as you descend in a westerly\r\ndirection, the Tertcha glacier. South of the Shun Kalpa glacier you reach\r\nfirst Ralem and then Sumdu, which is situated on a tributary of the Gori\r\nRiver, itself a tributary of the Kali. The rugged, barren chain of\r\nmountains separating the Gori from the Lissar extends in a general\r\ndirection from S.S.E. to N.N.E. up to the Ralfo glacier, and there turns\r\nin a curve North-West among a succession of perpetual snow-fields and\r\nglaciers. The glaciers to the North-East and East of the range outnumber\r\nthose on the West, but there is one of importance called in its different\r\nsections the Kala Baland, the Shun Kalpa, and the Tertcha. There are,\r\nalong the fifteen most northerly miles of the range, south of the point\r\nwhere it joins the Himahlyan chain, other glaciers of considerable size\r\nand importance, but I was not able to ascertain their names, excepting\r\nthat of the _Lissar seva_, the most northern of all, forming the source\r\nof the Lissar. The inter-Lissar-Gori range is of considerable\r\ngeographical importance, not only because it forms the boundary between\r\nthe two parts of Bhot called Darma and Johar, but also because of the\r\nmagnificent peaks reaching in the Bambadhura an elevation of 20,760 feet,\r\nand in a higher unnamed peak, South-East of it, 21,470 feet. There are\r\nalso the two Kharsa peaks, the one North-West of the glacier bearing its\r\nname being 19,650 feet, the one South-West of it slightly over 20,900\r\nfeet, and S.S.W. one peak 21,360 feet, another 21,520 feet, and farther\r\nstill, North of the Telkot glacier, the highest of all, 22,660 feet. In a\r\nSouth-East direction there are peaks 20,700 feet, 20,783 feet, and 21,114\r\nfeet high. At the point where the ridge turns South the elevations become\r\nlower, the two highest being 19,923 feet and 19,814 feet, the latter\r\nsituated at the point where a smaller range branches off to the\r\nSouth-East, the principal range running South for the next eleven or\r\ntwelve miles, with no very remarkable elevations. In the side range there\r\nare peaks of 18,280 feet, 17,062 feet, 14,960 feet, 14,960 feet\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIn Lat. 29 deg. 59\' 10" N. and Long. 80 deg. 31\' 45" E. the range again separates\r\ninto two secondary ridges, one extending South-East, the other\r\nSouth-West, and in turn both these are again subdivided into minor hill\r\nridges, along which no summits are found surpassing 13,000 feet, except\r\nthe Basili, 13,244 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Bungadhura Mountain (9037 feet), in close proximity to Khela,\r\nterminates the South-Easterly division of the range, separating the\r\nPargana of Darma from that of Askote. The actual boundary line, however,\r\ndoes not follow the higher mountain range as far as the Kali River, but\r\nswerves to the south along the ridge overlooking the valley of the River\r\nRelegar. These mountains are called the Mangthil.\r\n\r\nThere is west of the above ridge a second and even more important chain,\r\nrunning out parallel to it from the backbone of the Himahlyan great\r\nmountain system. This second ridge contains the highest mountain in the\r\nBritish Empire, Nanda Devi (25,660 feet) with its second peak (24,380\r\nfeet), also Trisul (23,406 feet), East Trisul (22,360 feet), and Nanda\r\nKot (22,530 feet). This range and its ramifications divide the valleys of\r\nthe Gori River (the Pargana of Johar) from the most Western portion of\r\nBhot, the Painkhanda Pargana.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Milam and Pindari glaciers are one on the Eastern, the\r\nother on the South-West side of this range. The Milam highway to Tibet,\r\nfrequented by the Johari traders, traverses over the Kungribingri Pass\r\n(18,300 feet), and the Uttadhura (17,590 feet) directly S.S.W. of it into\r\nHundes.\r\n\r\nThe Pargana Painkhanda, a region equally Alpine, similarly covered with\r\nvast stretches of perpetual snow and extensive glaciers, is in the\r\nNorth-East corner of Garwhal, bordering on Tibet, and along the Dhauli\r\nRiver; intersecting it, another trade route finds its way into Western\r\nTibet by the Niti Pass. Leaving the course of the Dhauli at Jelam (10,100\r\nfeet), this track proceeds almost due east, rising to an altitude of\r\n16,600 feet on the Niti, in Lat. 30 deg. 57\' 59" N. and Long. 79 deg. 55\' 3" E.,\r\nwhich is, from all accounts, a very easy pass, and quite free from snow\r\nduring the summer months. The people of the Painkhanda Pargana use this\r\npass as well as the other passes of Malla Shilanch and Tumzun, besides\r\nthe Shorhoti, visited by H. R. Strachey some years ago, over which,\r\nhowever, only a small portion of the trade with Hundes is carried, for it\r\nis considered the most dangerous of the three. The cold and turbid waters\r\nof the Dhauli, swollen by dozens of equally foaming and muddy\r\ntributaries, become ultimately the sacred waters of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nThe three Alpine Parganas, viz., the Painkhanda, Johar, and Darma (Darma,\r\nChaudas, and Bias) are inhabited by races closely allied and akin to\r\nthose of Tibet proper. The region is collectively named Bhot, although\r\nthat designation is more particularly applied by the natives of India to\r\nthat portion of the country which includes Darma, Bias, and Chaudas, and\r\nwhich has for natural boundaries the Kali River to the South-East,\r\nseparating it from Nepal and the great Himahlyan chain to the North-East,\r\nextending from the Lissar Peak in a general direction of about 115 deg..\r\n\r\nA ramification leaving the main range at the Darma Pass stretches across\r\nfrom N.N.W. to S.S.E., separating the above-mentioned Darma Ganga from\r\nthe Kuti River, along which I eventually travelled on my way to Tibet.\r\nThe main elevations found on this ridge are 18,510 feet on the Darma\r\nPass; north-east of the Rama glacier a peak 20,760 feet; the Gurma\r\nMountain 20,320 feet; and others south of them as high as 20,380 feet,\r\n20,330 feet, 20,260 feet. East of the latter summit is one 20,455 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     The word _Bhot_ and its meaning--Tibetan influence--Tibetan\r\n     abuses--The ever-helpful Chanden Sing--The first Shoka\r\n     village--Chanden Sing in disgrace--Weaving-loom--Fabrics--All\'s\r\n     well that ends well!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE name _Bhot_, pronounced Bod, Pote, Tuepoet, or Taipoet, by which this\r\ninter-Alpine region is called, means Tibet. In fact _Tibet_ is probably\r\nmerely a corruption of _Tuepoet_. These lofty "pattis" of Darma, Bias, and\r\nChaudas nominally form part of the British Empire, our geographical\r\nboundary with Nari Khorsum or Hundes (Great Tibet), being the main\r\nHimahlyan chain forming the watershed between the two countries. In spite\r\nof this actual territorial right, I found at the time of my visit in 1897\r\nthat it was impossible not to agree with the natives in asserting that\r\nBritish prestige and protection in those regions were mere myths; that\r\nTibetan influence alone was dominant and prevailing, and Tibetan law\r\nenforced and feared. The natives invariably showed abject obsequiousness\r\nand servile submission to Tibetans, being at the same time compelled to\r\ndisplay actual disrespect to British officials. They were driven to bring\r\nthe greater number of civil and criminal cases before Tibetan magistrates\r\nin preference to having them tried in a British court.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans, in fact, openly claimed possession of the "pattis"\r\nbordering on Nari Khorsum; and the more obviously to impress our natives\r\nwith their influence as superior to British, they came over to hibernate\r\non our side, and made themselves quite at home in the warmer valleys and\r\nin the larger bazaars. They brought their families with them, and drove\r\nbefore them thousands and thousands of sheep to graze on our\r\npasture-lands; they gradually destroyed our forests in Bias to supply\r\nSouth-Western Tibet with fuel for the summer months. For this they not\r\nonly paid nothing, but our native subjects had to convey the timber over\r\nthe high passes without remuneration. Necessarily such unprincipled\r\ntask-masters did not draw the line at extorting from our natives under\r\nany pretence money, food, clothes, and everything else they could\r\npossibly levy. Some were known to travel yearly as far south as Lucknow,\r\nCalcutta, and Bombay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA WEAVERS]\r\n\r\nSo much for the gentleness of the Tibetans--a hermit nation living in a\r\nclosed country!\r\n\r\nChanden Sing, ever anxious to be polite and helpful, would not hear of my\r\ncarrying my own sketch and note books as had always been my custom, but\r\ninsisted on doing so himself.\r\n\r\n"_Hum pagal neh!_" ("I am no fool!") said he with an expression of\r\nwounded feelings. "I will take great care of them."\r\n\r\nWe started up the steep road, having first descended to the level of the\r\nRiver Dholi, 800 feet lower than Khela, crossing by a wooden bridge. The\r\nzigzag up the mountain-side seemed endless. Here and there a cool spring\r\nof crystal water quenched our thirst, welcome indeed on that tedious\r\nascent in the broiling sun. Six miles above Khela we had risen to 7120\r\nfeet, and from this point the incline became less trying. Still we rose\r\nto 7450 feet two miles farther on, where under the shade of some\r\nmagnificent old trees, at Pungo, I halted for lunch. We had entered the\r\nfirst inhabited village of the Shokas, visually but erroneously called\r\nBotiyas, and were now in that part of their country called Chaudas.\r\n\r\nA pleasant surprise awaited me. A smart-looking lad in European clothes\r\ncame boldly forward, and, stretching out his hand, shook mine for some\r\nconsiderable time in a jovial and friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n"I am a Christian," said he.\r\n\r\n"I should say that you were by the way you shake hands."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," he proceeded. "I have prepared for you some milk, some\r\n_chapatis_ (native bread), and some nuts. Please accept them."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," I said. "You do not seem to be a bad Christian. What is your\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"Master G. B. Walter, sir. I teach in the school."\r\n\r\nA crowd of Shokas had collected. Their first shyness having worn off,\r\nthey proved to be polite and kind. The _naive_ nature and graceful manner\r\nof the Shoka girls struck me particularly on this my first introduction\r\nto them. Much less shy than the men, they came forward, and joked and\r\nlaughed as if they had known me all their lives. I wished to sketch two\r\nor three of the more attractive.\r\n\r\n"Where is my book, Chanden Sing?" I inquired of my bearer.\r\n\r\n"_Hazur hum mallum neh!_" ("I do not know, sir!") was his melancholy\r\nanswer as he searched his empty pockets.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you villain! Is that the care you take of my notes and sketches?\r\nWhat have you done with them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh Sahib, I drank some water at the Dholi River. I had the book then in\r\nmy hand. I must have left it on a stone when I stooped to drink water\r\nfrom the stream," the wretched man explained.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that Chanden Sing was promptly despatched\r\nto the spot he had named, with strict orders not to appear before me\r\nagain without the book. I spent two or three pleasant hours in having\r\nthe primitive Shoka weaving-looms, the processes of spinning and cloth\r\nmanufacture, explained to me. As can be seen from the illustration on p.\r\n42, the weaving looms of the Shokas are in every way similar to those\r\nused by the Tibetans proper, and are quite simple in construction. The\r\nwarp is kept at great tension, and the cloth-beam on which the woven\r\ntissue is rolled rests on the woman\'s lap during the process of weaving.\r\nThere are no treadles in the Shoka loom, by which the two sets of warp\r\nthreads are alternately raised or depressed between each time that the\r\ntransverse thread is passed, and all work is done by hand. The transverse\r\nthread is beaten firmly home by means of a heavy prismatic piece of wood.\r\nThe material used in weaving is yak or sheep\'s wool, either in its\r\nnatural colour or dyed in the primary colours of red and blue and yellow,\r\nand one secondary only, green. Blue and red are used in the greater and\r\nequal proportion; then green. Yellow is very parsimoniously used. The\r\nthread is well twisted and is subjected to no preparation before\r\nspinning, leaving thus a certain greasiness in the closely-woven material\r\nthat renders it waterproof. In weaving colour fabrics several shuttles\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nShoka women are very adept at this ancient art, and they patiently sit\r\nout of doors day after day weaving most intricate and artistic patterns.\r\nThese coloured tissues, if we except the simpler ones with blue ground\r\nand lines for women\'s garments, are usually very narrow (about seven\r\ninches in width), whereas the less elaborate ones, such as the white\r\nmaterial of which men\'s clothes are made, average sixteen inches.\r\n\r\nThe patterns in these many-coloured materials are woven from memory, and\r\ndo not contain curves or circles, but are entirely composed of lines and\r\nangles, combinations of small lozenges and squares separated by long\r\ntri-coloured parallel lines, forming, so far as weaving is concerned, the\r\nmain Shoka ideas of decoration and ornament. The fabrics are\r\nextraordinarily strong. The narrow coloured cloth of better quality is\r\nused mostly for making bags in which money and food are carried; the\r\ncoarser kind for the double sheep-loads.\r\n\r\nThe more talented of the Shoka young women show much ingenuity in carpet\r\nor rather rug making. They have copied the idea from old Chinese rugs\r\nwhich have found their way here _via_ Lhassa, and though upon close\r\nexamination it is true they differ considerably in quality and\r\nmanufacture, they are pleasing enough to the eye. These rugs are woven\r\nupon coarse thread matting, the coloured material being let in\r\nvertically. A soft surface is obtained not unlike in general appearance\r\nto that of Persian carpets, but not quite so pleasant to the touch. These\r\nsmall rectangular rugs are offered in the house of Shoka gentlemen to\r\nguests to sit on, and are also used to render the Tibetan saddles less\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAs time went on I became very anxious as to the missing book, for it\r\ncontained all my notes of the journey. The thought of its being deposited\r\non a rock washed by a rapid stream into which it might easily slip and be\r\ncarried away kept me in a state of suspense. At last a staggering figure\r\napproached; it was Chanden Sing waving the book triumphantly in the air.\r\nHe had run the distance of many miles down to the river and back so\r\nquickly that when he reached me he was utterly exhausted. He handed me\r\nthe book, and once more we started, followed by Walter and the whole\r\ncommunity, down the steep incline to the river. At this place some of the\r\nShokas seized my hands and placed them on their foreheads, at the same\r\ntime making deep bows. Others embraced my feet, while the women folks\r\nbade me the usual Hindustani "_Acha giao_" ("Go well").\r\n\r\nAfter some time had been wasted, or at least spent, in receiving these\r\nodd salutations, I persuaded them to retrace their steps, and they left\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     Prayer by wind-power--Photography under difficulties--A night of\r\n     misery--Drying up--Two lady missionaries--Their valuable work--An\r\n     interesting dinner party--An "eccentric" man\'s tea party.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHRINE AND FLYING PRAYERS]\r\n\r\nTO reach Shosha I had to climb a further three miles, which proved almost\r\nas steep as the previous ascent to Pungo.\r\n\r\nA curious custom of praying by wind-power, probably borrowed from the\r\nTibetans, prevails among the Shokas. The Tibetans, with a more intense\r\nreligion than the Shokas, use for this purpose not only the wind but even\r\nwater to propel their praying machines. Let me explain these simple\r\nmechanical contrivances for prayers. One or more rags or pieces of cloth,\r\nusually white, but on occasions red or blue, are fastened and hung by one\r\nend to a string stretched across a road, a pass, or a path. On crossing a\r\npass for the first time Shokas invariably cut a strip of cloth and place\r\nit so that it will flap in the breeze. Also when materials for a new\r\ndress are purchased or manufactured, it is customary for them to tear off\r\na narrow strip of the stuff and make a flying prayer of it. As long as\r\nthere is motion in it there is prayer, so that the natives tie them very\r\nfast to sticks, poles, or branches of trees; and certain shrubs and trees\r\nin weird romantic spots on the mountains are covered with these religious\r\nsigns. Moreover, on the top of nearly every Shoka dwelling a vast number\r\nof similar little flags can be seen, as well as near their shrines and at\r\nthe outer gates of a village.\r\n\r\nI put up at the Titela Daramsalla, one mile above Shosha village. The\r\nweather had been threatening for several days, and a steady downpour came\r\nupon us during the evening. Work had been accumulating daily. I decided\r\nto develop the large number of plates I had taken on my journey, a job\r\nhateful beyond measure when you are on the move. Having duly unpacked all\r\nthe developing dishes and prepared the different solutions, I set to work\r\nto make the shelter completely dark. The next important item required was\r\nwater, and of this there was plenty in that wretched shanty! I had just\r\ndeveloped half-a-dozen negatives, and was delighted at the excellent\r\nresults, when, in consequence of the storm having grown more violent, the\r\nrain began dripping on my head through the leaky roof of the Daramsalla.\r\nTo move all the trays of developers, baths, and fixing solution would\r\nhave been a nuisance; besides, I was too interested in my work to be put\r\nout by such small trifles, so I patiently stood this new discomfort. I\r\nshifted my position continually, merely with the result that the rain\r\ndripped alternately on my back, my legs, or my shoulders, according to my\r\nposition. It fell in torrents, and the roof over me was so leaky that I\r\nmight as well have been out in the open. I was sitting in a pool of water\r\nand could not lay my hands upon anything that was not drenched.\r\nFortunately my boxes and cases were water-tight, or all the instruments\r\nand plates would have been damaged.\r\n\r\nAnnoying as it was, I had to give up work. The best thing to do was to go\r\nto sleep. Easier said than done. My bedding and blanket were soaked. The\r\nattempts to lie under a waterproof sheet failed, for I felt suffocated,\r\nso I passed the cover to my servant, who, rolling himself in it, was soon\r\nin the arms of Morpheus. Tired and disgusted, I crouched myself up and\r\neventually fell asleep. I woke up in the morning with a biting pain in my\r\ntoes. I had been lying face downwards, and had involuntarily stretched my\r\nlegs during the night. I discovered to my horror that one foot rested in\r\nthe developing bath and the other in the fixing solution, which I had\r\nforgotten to empty out of the large celluloid trays.\r\n\r\nThe morning was spent in drying up things in the sun, including our\r\nclothes, while we, clad in a "_doti_" (large loin-cloth as used by the\r\nnatives of India), squatted down in the warmth in order to restore our\r\nsaturated skins to their natural condition.\r\n\r\nI was in the meantime interviewed by many Shokas, applying for medicines,\r\nand wishing to sell their native wares.\r\n\r\nA pretty girl, from whom I bought a curious set of neck hangings made of\r\nmusk-deer teeth, wished to be cured of the _goitre_, a complaint too\r\ncommon, alas! on these hills. Then a child was brought with a nasty\r\ntumour in a state of suppuration inside his left ear. Others wished to be\r\ncured of pains in the stomach and liver, which are very general among\r\nthem owing to their abuse of liquor.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing that two lady missionaries lived a mile and a half farther\r\non, at Sirka, I gave myself the pleasure of calling upon them. They\r\npossessed a nice bungalow at an elevation of 8900 feet above sea level,\r\nby the side of which was another structure for the accommodation of\r\nconverts and servants. Lower on the hillside they had built a dispensary\r\nand hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRINKLED SHOKA]\r\n\r\nI was received with the utmost courtesy by Miss Sheldon, M.D., and Miss\r\nBrown, of the Methodist Episcopal Mission. I have in my lifetime met with\r\nmany missionaries of all creeds in nearly every part of the globe, but\r\nnever has it been my luck before to meet two such charming, open-minded,\r\nand really hard-working ladies as the two who now so kindly received me.\r\n\r\n"Come right in, Mr. Landor," said Miss Sheldon with her delightful\r\nAmerican accent, and she shook hands with me in a good, hearty fashion.\r\n\r\nThe natives had praised to me the charity and helpfulness of this lady.\r\nI found this more than justified. By night or day she would never refuse\r\nhelp to the sick, and her deeds of kindness which became known to me are\r\nfar too numerous to detail in these pages. Perhaps her most valuable\r\nquality is her perfect tact--a quality I have found none too common among\r\nmissionaries. Her patience, her kindly manner towards the Shokas, her\r\ngood heart, the wonderful cures she wrought among the sick, were items of\r\nwhich these honest mountaineers had everlasting praises to sing. A Shoka\r\nwas telling me that it was not an uncommon thing for Miss Sheldon to give\r\naway all her own food supplies, and even the clothes from her\r\nback--courting for herself discomfort, yet happy in her good work.\r\n\r\nWith it was combined a charming modesty. No word about herself or her\r\nactions ever passed her lips. A pioneer in these parts, she evidently\r\nmust have encountered much difficulty in the beginning. At present her\r\ngood influence over the Shokas is very considerable. The same can be said\r\nof Miss Brown, who was in every way a worthy comrade of Miss Sheldon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAL SING TOKUDAR AND HIS BROTHER]\r\n\r\nThey have both in a comparatively short time become fully acquainted with\r\nthe Shoka language, and can converse in it as fluently as in English,\r\nthis fact alone endearing them greatly to the natives.\r\n\r\nThey were kind enough to ask me to dinner. "It is Sunday," said Miss\r\nSheldon, "and we shall have all our Christians dining with us. You will\r\nnot mind, I am sure."\r\n\r\nI assured her that nothing would interest me more.\r\n\r\nI arrived punctually at the hour appointed, and on the verandah of the\r\nbungalow were laid some nice clean mats upon which we all sat\r\ncross-legged in native fashion. We three Europeans were provided with\r\nknife and fork, but all the natives helped themselves with their fingers,\r\nwhich they used with much dexterity. There were among the converts some\r\nHindoos, some Shokas, some Humlis, and a Tibetan woman. All counted, I\r\nsuppose they were about twenty, and it would be impossible to find a\r\nbetter behaved set of Christians anywhere. They ate heartily and only\r\nspoke when they were spoken to.\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether I have ever dined with so many good Christians," said I\r\njokingly to Miss Sheldon. "It is delightful."\r\n\r\n"They would much like to hear some of the experiences of your travels if\r\nyou would be kind enough to tell them. That is to say, if you are not too\r\ntired and do not mind."\r\n\r\nInterpreted by Miss Brown, I related some of my adventures in the country\r\nof the Ainu. Rarely have I had such an interested audience. When the\r\nstory ended they all salaamed me, and an old veteran Gourkha, one of the\r\nconverts, took my hand and shook it warmly.\r\n\r\n"You must not mind, Mr. Landor: you see, we treat our Christians like\r\nourselves,"[4] quickly interrupted Miss Sheldon.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I do not mind," I replied. "On the contrary, I am glad to see it\r\ndone."\r\n\r\nI took my leave and asked the ladies to come to tea with me the next day.\r\nThe afternoon came and they arrived, when to my horror it flashed across\r\nmy mind that I had neither cups, nor saucers, nor spoons. I had some tea,\r\nbut I had no idea in which box it was, and to save my life I could not\r\nlay my hands upon it. This caused a frank and delightful remark on the\r\npart of Miss Sheldon to Miss Brown.\r\n\r\n"Does not Mr. Landor remind you of \'that other\' eccentric gentleman that\r\ncame through here last year?"\r\n\r\nThe moment she had uttered the words Miss Sheldon saw what she had said,\r\nand we all laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"You know, Mr. Landor," put in Miss Brown, "we half foresaw that you\r\nwould not be provided with these articles of luxury, and we brought our\r\nown cups and saucers."\r\n\r\nThe news was a great relief to me.\r\n\r\n"Well now, let me persuade you to take some delicious chocolate instead\r\nof tea."\r\n\r\n"Very good, we would prefer it. We have not had chocolate for a long\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF A WEALTHY SHOKA]\r\n\r\nA solid block of chocolate was produced weighing twenty-eight pounds, and\r\nChanden Sing set to chip off bits with a stone--a primitive but effective\r\nmethod. In the meantime the kettle was boiling, while my two visitors\r\nmade themselves as comfortable as was possible under the circumstances on\r\npack-saddle cases.\r\n\r\nThe tea party went off well, for the ladies, evidently suspecting the\r\n"eccentricity" of their host, had come provided not only with cups and\r\nsaucers, but with spoons, cake, bread, butter, and biscuits!\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] N.B.--Anglo-Indians very rarely condescend to shake hands with the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     Discouraging reports--A steep ascent--How I came to deserve the\r\n     name of "monkey"--Hard at work--Promoted in rank--Collapse in a\r\n     gale of wind--Time and labour lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE weather again became rainy and cold. The reports that I received of\r\nthe state of the roads farther up were not encouraging.\r\n\r\n"The track is impassable," said an old Shoka who had just arrived from\r\nGarbyang. "The Lippu Pass by which you wish to enter Tibet is still\r\nclosed, and there is much snow on it still. Then the Jong Pen of Taklakot\r\nin Tibet, having been left unpunished for his last years\' attack on\r\nLieutenant Gaussen, has now a strong guard of three hundred men to\r\nprevent foreigners entering the country. The _Dakus_ (brigands) infesting\r\nthe region of the Mansarowar Lake seem to be more numerous this year than\r\never."\r\n\r\nI shall come in for a lively time, I thought to myself.\r\n\r\nMy next camp was at Shankula, 7450 feet above the sea level. It was\r\nreached by going over a delightfully cool track, not unlike a shady path\r\nthrough a picturesque park, among tall cedars of Lebanon, beeches and\r\nmaples, with here and there a stream or spring of water, and hundreds of\r\nblack-faced, white-bearded monkeys playing and leaping from tree to tree.\r\n\r\nI encamped by the river. The day was glorious. In front of me, north-east\r\nby east, stood, gigantic and majestic, some high snowy peaks. The valley\r\nwas narrow, and the remainder of the snowy range of mountains was hidden\r\nfrom sight. What a lovely subject for a picture! I was tempted to halt\r\nand get out my paint-box and sketch-book; and abandoning my lunch, which\r\nwas being cooked, I climbed to the summit of a high peak in order to\r\nobtain a more extensive view. The ascent, first on slippery grass, then\r\nover slaty rocks, was by no means easy, nor devoid of a certain amount of\r\ndanger; but so keen was I to get to the top that I reached the summit\r\nvery quickly, leaving half-way down the mountain slope the two men who\r\nhad followed me. In places near the top there were rocks to climb that\r\nstood almost perpendicular, and it was necessary to use hands as well as\r\nfeet. It was not unlike climbing up a rough wall. I was nevertheless well\r\nrepaid for my trouble. The view from that high point of vantage was\r\nmagnificent, and I confess that I felt almost too ambitious when, having\r\nunslung my paint-box, I attempted to reproduce on paper the scene before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"I am a fool," said I to myself, "to try and paint that! What painter\r\ncould do those mountains justice?"\r\n\r\nI dashed off the picture as usual very hastily, but never was a rash\r\nventure rewarded with poorer result, and those eternal giants remained\r\nunpainted.\r\n\r\nDisconsolate, I made my way down. It was more difficult even than the\r\nclimb up. A false step, a slip, and it might have cost my life,\r\nespecially along the steep precipice, where I had to cling to anything\r\nprojecting in the wall-like rock. I had gone four thousand feet higher\r\nthan the camp, reaching an elevation of 11,450 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nIt was this performance, watched anxiously from my camp down below, as\r\nwell as by the army of men belonging to the Deputy Commissioner of\r\nAlmora, who was also here encamped, that won me the name among the\r\nnatives of "Chota Sahib," the "Langur," the "small sir," the "monkey," a\r\nname of which I have been proud ever since.\r\n\r\nSome seventy-three miles from Pithoragarh the Shankula River enters the\r\nKali, the course of the Shankula being roughly from N.N.W. to S.S.E.\r\n\r\nThe track once crossed, the Shankula stream tends towards the South-East\r\nand with a gentle incline rises to 8570 feet at Gibti, where I encamped\r\nsomewhat above the Gala Daramsalla. I had gone through forests of maple,\r\nbeech, oak and rhododendrons, with a thick undergrowth of scrub and\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\nThe Kali River, about two thousand feet down below my camp, marks the\r\nboundary between Nepal and Kumaon. From this high point the foaming\r\nstream can be seen for miles, winding between thickly wooded hills and\r\nmountains like a silver ribbon on a dark reposeful background.\r\n\r\nThe march from my last camp was a very short one, so I had the greater\r\npart of the day left for work. Previously I had usually halted in\r\nDaramsallas (stone-walled shelters), and in default of these my men put\r\nup for me a neatly-made "Chahna"[5] or "choepper," a hut of mats and\r\nbranches of trees, in the construction of which the Paharis are\r\nwonderfully dexterous. I had also my small "mountain tent," a _tente\r\nd\'abri_, quite comfortable enough for ordinary requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TENT]\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that this style of travelling is not considered _comme\r\nil faut_ by the officials of India. It is the number and size of one\'s\r\ntents, according to these authorities, that make one a greater or a\r\nsmaller gentleman! I had put up my tent--three feet high, seven feet\r\nlong, and four feet wide--by the side of the two double-leaf eighty pound\r\ntents of the Deputy Commissioner, but this official and his companions\r\nwere far from pleased with this act of familiarity. For a double-tented\r\nsahib to be seen in company of another sahib whose bijou tent rose from\r\nthe ground hardly up to one\'s waist, was _infra dig_ and a serious threat\r\nto the prestige of the British in India. I was therefore politely\r\nrequested to move from my cosy quarters to a more dignified abode lent\r\nme by the one-eyed Lal Sing, a Tokudar[6] and brother of the Patwari.[7]\r\n\r\nBeing thus promoted in everybody\'s estimation except my own, I wrote and\r\ncopied out my first article for _The Daily Mail_, and, having done this,\r\nI dined and spent a pleasant evening with Mr. G.\r\n\r\nThe night was stormy; the wind shook my tent. I went to sleep wrapped in\r\nmy solitary camel-hair blanket. Some hours later a sharp knock on my head\r\nwoke me. It was the centre pole of the tent that had moved out of its\r\nsockets and had fallen on me. This was followed by a rushing noise of\r\ncanvas, and I found myself in a moment uncovered and gazing at the stars.\r\n\r\nThere were white things flying about in the air, and, to my horror, I\r\ndiscovered the leaves of my _Daily Mail_ article scattered in the wind.\r\n\r\nI jumped up, but of the ten or twelve foolscap leaves on very thin paper,\r\nI only managed to recover two or three. The others soared gracefully to\r\nand fro in the air, and I suppose settled eventually in the Kali. This\r\nmeant recopying the article next day, a tedious job when you are burning\r\nto get on.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose. The camp began to wake up. All were shivering with cold. I\r\ntook my usual cold bath surrounded by a half-frozen crowd of astonished\r\nonlookers, wrapped up in their thick woollen blankets, crouching round me\r\nwith their chins on their knees.\r\n\r\nThe tent was recovered after a while, and soon all was ready to start.\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] _Chahna_--Pahari. _Choepper_, Dehsi--Hindustani.\r\n\r\n[6] _Tokudar_--Head-village man.\r\n\r\n[7] _Patwari_--Accountant for a Pargana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     The _Nerpani_, or "waterless track"--Exaggerated accounts--A long\r\n     shot--The rescue of two coolies--Picturesque Nature--An\r\n     involuntary shower-bath--The _Chai_ Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE renowned _Nerpani_, or _Nerpania_, "waterless track," begins at\r\nGibti. Very few travellers have been on this road, and by the accounts\r\nbrought back many people have been prevented from imitating their\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NERPANI ROAD]\r\n\r\nPersonally I found the track far better than I anticipated. I have been\r\non worse mountain roads among less precipitous cliffs. From what I had\r\nheard it seemed as if the greater part of the road for several miles was\r\nsupported on crowbars fixed in the rock, but such is not the case. Here\r\nand there, however, are found along the track spots overhanging\r\nprecipices; and where the perpendicular cliff did not allow of a road to\r\nbe cut except at great expense, crowbars have been more or less firmly\r\nplanted horizontally in the rock, and a narrow path made over them with\r\nlarge slabs of stone. The drop from the path to the river is often from\r\neighteen hundred to two thousand feet, and the path is in many places no\r\nwider than six inches. But to any surefooted traveller that would not\r\nconstitute a real danger. The road is tedious, for the Nerpania cliff\r\nalong which it has been constructed is subdivided into three smaller\r\ncliffs, separated in turn one from the other by ravines. It is thus\r\ntroublesome to climb up and down some thousands of feet, each time along\r\ninterminable and badly put together flights of steps, only to descend\r\nagain on the other side. Some of the descents, especially the last to\r\nGulamla, are precipitous, but with no nails in one\'s shoes and no stick\r\nin one\'s hand, there is really very little danger for people accustomed\r\nto mountaineering.\r\n\r\nThese are the main elevations on the road: Gibti, 8650 feet, 6750 feet,\r\n7600 feet, 6700 feet, 7100 feet, 6600 feet from Gulamla. At bearings\r\nmagnetic 350 deg., going close to the river-bed through a gorge, one obtains\r\na fine view of a huge gneiss peak towering on the left side of the\r\n_Neganza_ or _Nejangar_ Mountain. This peculiar rock, shaped like a\r\nfortress, goes by the name of the Ladjekut Peak and rises where the\r\nNejangar River meets the Kali. Here we pitched our tents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NERPANI ROAD]\r\n\r\nTowards sunset there was much agitation in camp over the appearance of\r\nwild goats on the other side of the Kali River in Nepal.\r\n\r\n"Your rifle, Sahib, your rifle!" shouted a chorus of impatient natives.\r\n"Quick, quick, your rifle!"\r\n\r\nI seized my Mannlicher and followed the excited gang to a place some\r\nhundred yards away, where a large boisterous crowd had collected to watch\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NERPANI ROAD]\r\n\r\n"Where are they?" said I, as I could not see anything.\r\n\r\n"There, there!" they all screamed at the top of their voices, pointing to\r\nthe summit of the opposite cliff over four hundred yards distant.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is too far."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Sahib, please shoot," they all implored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NERPANI TRACK]\r\n\r\nI put up the Lyman back-sight to four hundred yards, took aim and fired.\r\nDown came rolling from rock to rock the poor wild goat, amid the frantic\r\nexcitement of the crowd around me. It rolled down until it came to the\r\nshrub and vegetation, where its progress became slower. It fell on the\r\nsmall trees and, bending them by its weight, it would drop a few seconds\r\nlater on to a lower one. The trepidation on our side was intense. At last\r\nthe graceful body stuck across a bigger tree and swung on it for some\r\nminutes. The oscillation slowly ceased, and tree and goat became\r\nmotionless. There our prey stuck fast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAI-LEK PASS]\r\n\r\nHatchets were immediately produced, and two tall trees hurriedly cut and\r\nfelled. A bridge was being spanned to cross the dangerous cold and swift\r\nwaters of the Kali. A tree was thrown across, and its point just about\r\nreached a high rock on the other side. Then, amidst a dead silence, a\r\ncoolie balanced himself over it. He had nearly reached the opposite bank\r\nwhen there was a crash. The tree broke, and the man was in the water,\r\nfrightened and screaming pitifully, clutching a branch with convulsive\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nAnother coolie went to his rescue, but the tree being now swung by the\r\ncurrent, he also was pitched into the water. It was only after a terrible\r\nmoment of suspense that our men had the common sense to draw the tree\r\nback towards the shore. One and all joined in a supreme effort, and the\r\ntwo men were eventually saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NARROW GORGE BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\nOur way to the next camp was first through a high narrow gorge. A\r\nbeautiful waterfall on terraces faced us. From 6700 feet, the road\r\nascended to 7650 feet, then on flights of steps and in places over\r\ncrowbars the weary traveller descended to 7000 feet, where at Malpa the\r\nroad was for a space nearly level. The Malpa River, running from North to\r\nSouth, was crossed. On the Nepal side across the Kali the vegetation was\r\nluxuriant, while on the Kumaon side it was sparse and bare. Farther on\r\nanother beautiful waterfall.\r\n\r\nThe track now rose on a steep incline to 8120 feet among huge rocks and\r\nboulders. What with the gigantic snow-peaks, the pretty waterfalls, the\r\nweird character of the country traversed, one got so interested in one\'s\r\nsurroundings that one forgot all about any difficulty of climbing. From\r\nbarren hills and rocks the track suddenly became clayish and sandy, and\r\nin a series of zigzags well shaded by _Tchuk, Utish_, and _Ritch_ trees,\r\nwith a thick undergrowth of scrub wood and stunted vegetation, we found\r\nourselves down as low as 6750 feet, ascending immediately after in a very\r\nshort distance to 8100 feet to Camp Lahmari.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the path went over the highest part of the cliff, and it\r\ntook a good walker the whole day to reach from one spring of water to the\r\nnext, hence the name of "waterless."\r\n\r\nHere practically ended the _Nerpani_ (waterless track), and an\r\ninvoluntary shower-bath soon awaited the passer-by, drenching him to the\r\nskin, unless he was provided with waterproof and umbrella. The spray\r\ndescended from a great height for a length of some thirty or forty yards,\r\nthe road being very narrow and very slippery, so that progress was\r\nparticularly slow. The name of the waterfall was _Takti_.\r\n\r\nThe track, if not more level, was nevertheless better after this to the\r\nsore-footed walker. It was less rocky and devoid of the tiresome flights\r\nof steps.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Lahmari we immediately had a steep rise to 9600 feet. Then a\r\ndrop of 400 feet, and we found ourselves on the Buddi River, a tributary\r\nof the Kali. Just above the bridge was a magnificent waterfall, by the\r\nleft side of which we found a kind of grotto hollowed out under a rock.\r\nThe Shokas and Tibetans used it as a camping ground.\r\n\r\nTo our right, high up on the cliffside, was the picturesque village of\r\nBuddi (9300 feet), with its two- and three-storeyed houses. Below and\r\nover it in long zigzags could be seen the track ascending to the top of\r\n_Chai-Lek_, or _Tcheto_ Pass as the Shokas call it. At bearings magnetic\r\n170 deg. we had the towering Namjun peak, so high that I was told it could be\r\nseen even from Almora and Ranikhet.\r\n\r\nThen as we proceeded up the steep clayish track, I could not, on looking\r\nback, help admiring the magnificent Kali valley with its gigantic cliffs\r\nand gorges surmounted by lofty snow peaks. On the _Chai_ Pass the two\r\naneroids I had on me registered an altitude of 11,190 feet. I was now on\r\na small flat tableland. Darcy Bura, the richest Shoka trader from Buddi,\r\nhad erected here a bargain-house for the purchase and exchange of borax,\r\nsalt, wool, and other articles from Tibet. On the left side of the road a\r\nlarge cave in the rock had been walled and partly roofed over for the use\r\nof wife-seekers from the villages of Buddi and Garbyang. These houses\r\nwere called _Rambangs_, and were an old institution among the Shokas, of\r\nwhich I shall have occasion to speak at length later on. As everywhere\r\nelse, a few high poles with flying prayers and a bell had been placed\r\nnear the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n     A series of misfortunes--Tibetan atrocities on British\r\n     subjects--Tibetan exactions--Revolting cruelty to one of her\r\n     Majesty\'s subjects--Assault on a British officer--A smart British\r\n     Envoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY arrival at Garbyang was watched by hundreds of men, women, and\r\nchildren, all squatting on the edge of the flat mud roofs of their\r\nhabitations, while a few dozen people followed me respectfully to my\r\ncamping ground beyond the village. A large tent had been put up for me by\r\nPundit Gobaria\'s brother, who had been informed of my coming by Anti Ram\r\nSah, my banker at Almora. Mr. G., Deputy Commissioner, arrived later.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious to make immediate arrangements to enter Tibet, but all\r\nmy efforts to obtain reliable followers were of little avail.\r\n\r\nI heard to my regret, a day or two later, that the plan of my journey,\r\nwhich with so much trouble and care I had kept secret, had been divulged\r\nto the Tibetan authorities. Misfortunes never come singly! Against my\r\nwill I had been advised to pay a certain sum at Almora, in exchange for\r\nwhich I received a letter of credit on Pundit Gobaria, a rich trader of\r\nGarbyang, who was to pay me the amount in silver. Unluckily, Gobaria was\r\nstill absent in Nepal, and no one else could cash a cheque for the amount\r\nI wanted. This was tiresome--all the more so as I had counted on the\r\nmoney. I immediately sent a runner to Almora to have the sum in silver\r\nsent at once. This involved much publicity and considerable risk.\r\n\r\nAlso delay was inevitable. All the passes were closed and fresh snow was\r\nfalling daily. It was just possible with much difficulty for a man to\r\ncross the Lippu Pass, but no baggage could be taken through. I made up my\r\nmind to remain a few days in Garbyang, and took this opportunity to have\r\na large Tibetan tent manufactured to shelter my future followers--if\r\never I could find any--and it might help me, I calculated, to become\r\nfriendly with the natives, among whom I hoped to find some willing\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATES OF GARBYANG]\r\n\r\nDoctor H. Wilson, of the Methodist Evangelical Mission, went to much\r\ntrouble in trying to get together men for me, but though his influence\r\nwas and is considerable in Bias and Chaudas, his efforts were not crowned\r\nwith success. The Shokas know well how terribly cruel the Tibetans are.\r\nThey have suffered at their hands more than once, and even of recent\r\nyears the Government of India has had reported by its own officers cases\r\nof horrible tortures inflicted by the Tibetan authorities on British\r\nsubjects captured by them on our side of the frontier. Some of the\r\natrocities committed by the Lamas on British subjects are revolting, and\r\nit is a matter of great regret and indignation to the Englishmen who\r\nvisit these regions to think that the weakness of our officials in Kumaon\r\nhas allowed and is allowing such proceedings still to go on. So incapable\r\nare they, in fact, that the Jong Pen of Taklakot in Tibet sends over,\r\n"with the sanction of the Government of India," his yearly emissaries to\r\ncollect Land Revenue[8] from British subjects living on British soil. The\r\nShokas have to pay this tribute, and do so out of fear--in addition to\r\nother taxes and trade dues iniquitously exacted by the Tibetans.\r\n\r\nOn the slightest pretext the Tibetans arrest, torture mercilessly, fine,\r\nand confiscate property of, British subjects on British territory.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit there could be seen, in Garbyang and other\r\nvillages, British subjects (Shokas) who had been mutilated by the Tibetan\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nEven Dr. H. Wilson, who had erected a dispensary at Gungi (one march\r\nbeyond Garbyang), was lately threatened with confiscation--and worse\r\nperhaps--if he did not immediately comply with the exactions of the\r\nTibetans. He declined to do so and reported the matter to the Government,\r\nrelying on a good rifle in the house and his many servants. His\r\ndetermination not to be intimidated seems to have given him temporary\r\nsecurity, for the Tibetans are as cowardly, when they think themselves\r\nmatched, as they are cruel.\r\n\r\nLet me quote one example of cruelty which occurred as late as 1896. A\r\nShoka trader, undeniably a British subject, had gone over the border, as\r\nis customary with them during the summer, to dispose of his merchandise\r\non the Tibetan market. He and another Shoka, also a British subject, had\r\na quarrel. Aware that the first Shoka was wealthy, the Tibetan\r\nauthorities took this pretext to arrest him and impose upon him an\r\nexorbitant fine, besides the additional punishment of two hundred lashes\r\nto be administered to him by order of the Jong Pen. The Shoka\r\nremonstrated on the plea that he had done no harm, and that being a\r\nBritish subject they had no right to so punish him. The Jong Pen saw his\r\norders executed, and further commanded his men to cut off the wretched\r\nprisoner\'s hands. He was made over to two soldiers entrusted with the\r\ncarrying out of the sentence. They led him away to the place of\r\npunishment. The Shoka was of a powerful build and possessed courage.\r\nThough half dead and covered with wounds, he overcame his guardians and\r\nescaped. The alarm was instantly given and a large party of horsemen sent\r\nto capture him.\r\n\r\nThey caught him up, and when at close range fired on him and wounded him\r\nin the knee, smashing the kneecap. He was surrounded, pounced upon,\r\nbeaten mercilessly, and last but not least, all his fingers were one by\r\none crushed into pulp between two heavy stones. In this condition he was\r\ndragged before the Lamas, only to be decapitated! Mr. Sturt, an able and\r\njust officer, who was then Deputy Commissioner at Almora, became\r\nacquainted with these facts, and, having fully ascertained their\r\naccuracy, reported them to the Government, strongly advising immediate\r\naction against the Tibetans for this and other cruelties that were\r\nconstantly taking place on our frontier. Though it was undeniably proved\r\nthat the victim was a British subject, the Government of India took no\r\nsteps in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1896, Lieutenant Gaussen, who on a shooting trip tried to\r\nenter Tibet by the Lippu Pass, was surrounded by Tibetan soldiers, and he\r\nand his servants were seriously ill-treated. The British officer received\r\na nasty wound on his forehead, and one of his servants, who behaved\r\nheroically, was so cruelly handled that to-day, two years later, I hear\r\nhe is still an invalid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATAN SING CHAPRASSI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NARENGHIRI CHAPRASSI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARBYANG]\r\n\r\nMr. J. Larkin, Deputy Collector at Almora, was then despatched to the\r\nfrontier. No better man could have been sent. Firm, just, and\r\npainstaking, he became popular and much respected among the Shokas. He\r\nlistened to their troubles and sufferings; he administered justice\r\nwherever possible. He refused audience to no one, and during his flying\r\nvisit became well acquainted with the country, the people, and all that\r\nwent on. The poor Shokas felt much relieved, thinking that at last the\r\nTibetan abuses would be put an end to. They were not mistaken, at least\r\nfor a time. The Jong Pen of Taklakot was called upon to answer for his\r\nmany misdeeds. He refused an interview. Mr. Larkin sent word across the\r\nborder that he would have no trifling and that he must come, upon which\r\nthe Jong Pen, with his officers and Lamas, crossed the snowy Lippu Pass.\r\nTrembling with fear and bending low to the ground, the Tibetans, with\r\nabject servility, entered the tent of our British envoy. The account of\r\nthe interview, which I received in full from a Shoka gentleman who was\r\npresent as interpreter, is amusing and curious, showing the mutability\r\nand hypocrisy of the Tibetans. In the long run, and being well acquainted\r\nwith the cowardice of his visitors, Mr. Larkin not only obtained redress\r\non every point but gave the Jong Pen and his officers a severe harangue.\r\nThe result of the interview was that the collection of the Land Revenue\r\nshould be put a stop to, and that Tibetan law should no more be\r\nadministered on our side of the frontier.\r\n\r\nMr. Larkin\'s visit to Bhot was cut short by urgent orders to return\r\nimmediately to Almora.\r\n\r\nThe following year (the year of my visit, 1897), Mr. G., Deputy\r\nCommissioner, undid much that the previous officer had accomplished. The\r\nJong Pen, when summoned, declined to come, and sent over deputies in his\r\nplace. The upshot of it is, that Land Revenue is again paid by the Shokas\r\nto the Tibetan tax-collectors through the Peshkar.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned these facts as representative of many, and to show how\r\nit came that the natives, who had never had any protection from our\r\nGovernment, were disinclined, notwithstanding the temptations I offered\r\nthem, to brave the dangers of Tibet. I, who later on suffered so much\r\nthrough being betrayed by Shokas, am the first to forgive and not to\r\nblame them. Though nominally our subjects, their actual rulers are the\r\nTibetans, and we do nothing to protect them against the exactions and\r\ntortures of the intruders. Why then should we expect them to be faithful\r\nto us? The Shokas are not treacherous by nature, but they are compelled\r\nto be deceitful to protect their lives and their homes. Properly treated,\r\nthese honest, gentle, good-natured mountaineers would assuredly become\r\nloyal and trustworthy subjects of her Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] The sums are now collected by the Political Peskhar and handed over\r\nin Garbyang to the Tibetans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n     Tibetan threats--My birthday--Ravenous dogs--A big dinner--Shoka\r\n     hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Jong Pen of Taklakot, on hearing of my proposed visit, sent threats\r\nthat he would confiscate the land of any man who came in my employ,\r\nbesides menaces of "flogging" and subsequent "beheading" of myself and\r\nany one caught with me. Personally I paid little attention to these\r\nintimidations.\r\n\r\nConsulting the calendar one day--a thing I did with great regularity in\r\nthese regions--I made out that it was the first of June, and I then\r\nremembered that the following day would be my birthday. Feasts were\r\nscarce in these high altitudes, and the prospect before me was that they\r\nwould in the near future be even scarcer. It therefore occurred to me\r\nthat I could not better while away a day at least of this weary waiting\r\nthan by treating myself to a real big feast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHERE I STAYED AT GARBYANG]\r\n\r\nChanden Sing was despatched round the village to summon up to my tent all\r\nthe local Bunyas (tradespeople). Rice, flour, eight pounds of butter\r\n(_ghi_), a large quantity of lump sugar, pepper, salt, and a fat sheep\r\nwere purchased. The latter was forthwith beheaded, skinned, and dressed\r\nin the approved fashion by the faithful Chanden Sing, who was indeed a\r\njack of all trades.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am a careless house or rather tent keeper, and I\r\nentrusted my chaprassis with the job of stowing away the provisions, for\r\nwhich purpose a recess under the native low bedstead served to\r\nperfection, holding as it did the different-sized vessels, with the\r\n_bachri_ (sheep) in pieces, and the rice, flour, butter, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being done, I worked away hard at writing, and getting\r\ninterested, continued at it till an early hour of the morning; I got\r\ntired at last, and, wrapping myself up in my blanket, I soon went to\r\nsleep next to a heap of stones piled up by the cautious Chanden Sing.\r\n\r\n"Sahib," had been his warning, "there are many hungry dogs about. If they\r\ncome, here are a few missiles ready for them!" and he pointed at the\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n"All right; good-night."\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this was soon apparent, for I had not slept long when I was\r\naroused by the hollow sound of lip-smacking, apparently arising from more\r\nthan one mouth, accompanied by the movement of the stretched canvas bed\r\non which I was lying. Jumping to my feet, I alighted upon a living mass\r\nof unwelcome guests; but before I even realised what had been going on,\r\nthey had scampered away, the brutes! carrying between their\r\ntightly-closed jaws a last mouthful of my dainties.\r\n\r\nThe ammunition at my disposal was quickly used up--a poor revenge, even\r\nwhen I heard the yell of a dog I happened to hit in the dark. On striking\r\na match, I found the large brass bowls emptied, the rice and flour\r\nscattered all over the tent, and the sheep practically vanished.\r\n\r\nI determined not to be done out of this piece of indulgence, which now\r\nseemed desirable beyond words, although I crawled back into my blanket,\r\nand found for a while oblivion in sleep. I was no sooner up in the\r\nmorning than I planned a new banquet. But in the nick of time, Mr. G.,\r\nwho had gone a march farther, returned with his escort of policemen,\r\n_moonshees_, pundits, and chaprassis.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Landor," said he kindly, when I had told him of my trouble,\r\n"you come and dine with me. These chaps shall get you up a special dinner\r\nin their own way."\r\n\r\nMy stores were put under tribute, instead of the native Bunyas, and we\r\nhad a very excellent meal indeed. We had Bovril soup and Irish stew,\r\nroast mutton, potted tongue, roast chicken, gigantic swan eggs poached on\r\nanchovy toast, jam omelette, chow-chow preserves, ginger biscuits, boiled\r\nrhubarb, and I must not forget, by the way, an excellent plum cake of no\r\nsmall dimensions, crammed full of raisins and candy, which I had brought\r\nfrom Mrs. G. at Almora to her husband, and to which we did, with\r\nblessings for her, the fullest justice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA HOUSE WITH STRANGE LADDER]\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. G. and also to the fortunate coincidence of receiving a\r\nbatch of letters from parents and friends, which reached me on that day\r\nby runner from Khela, I do not think that I could have spent a happier\r\nbirthday anywhere, and I knew well enough that these were to be the last\r\nmoments of contentment--an end to the fleshpots of Egypt. After this I\r\nshould be cut off from civilisation, from comfort even in its primitive\r\nform; and to emphasise this fact, it happened that on the very morning\r\nfollowing my birthday, Mr. G. left and continued his journey to Almora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA HOUSES]\r\n\r\nThe weather was cold and rain fell in torrents, the thermometer being\r\nnever above 52 deg. during the warmest hours of the day. My soaked tent stood\r\nin a regular pool of water, notwithstanding the double trenches round it,\r\nand several Shoka gentlemen had before asked me to abandon it and live in\r\na house. They were all most anxious to extend to me hospitality, which I,\r\nnot wishing to trouble them, and in order at all hazards to be entirely\r\nfree and unhampered in my actions, courteously but firmly declined.\r\nNevertheless, quite a deputation arrived on June 4, renewing their\r\nrequest; but I was determined to have my way. In vain! They would not see\r\na Sahib under cold canvas while they themselves had comfortable homes.\r\nThey held a consultation. Unexpectedly, and notwithstanding my\r\nremonstrances, my loads were suddenly seized and carried triumphantly on\r\nthe backs of a long row of powerful Shokas towards the village. I had to\r\nfollow _nolens volens_, and from that day on I grew through constant\r\ncontact daily more convinced of the genuine friendliness and\r\nkindheartedness of these people.\r\n\r\nTo prevent my coming back, they even pulled down the tent, and, wet as it\r\nwas, carried it away. Zeheram and Jaimal, two leading Shokas, held my\r\nhands and patted me on the back as they led me with every sign of\r\ncourtesy to my new dwelling.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be a fine two-storeyed building with nicely carved\r\nwooden door and windows coloured red and green. So great was the anxiety\r\nand fear of these good people that I should turn back at this juncture,\r\nthat some twenty outstretched hands seized me by the arms, while others\r\npushed me from behind up a flight of ten or twelve steps into the house,\r\nwhere I found myself the guest of my good friend Zeheram. I was given the\r\nfront of the first floor, consisting of two large clean rooms, with a\r\nvery fair native bedstead, a table and two or more _moras_ (round cane\r\nstools covered with skin); and I had no sooner realised that I must stay\r\nthan presents of sweets, preserved fruit, dried dates, and tea were\r\nbrought for my acceptance--tea made in the Tibetan fashion with butter\r\nand salt in it.\r\n\r\nEven if at first I had had slight apprehensions at the expression of such\r\nvery unusual hospitality, these were soon dispelled, and I was proud to\r\nbe assured by my host that I was the first Englishman (or for that,\r\nEuropean or American) who had been allowed to enter the living part of a\r\nShoka house and partake of food in a Shoka dwelling. The opportunity was\r\ntoo good to be lost, and I was sorely tempted to tarry among them, so as\r\nreally to get an insight into their mode of living, their customs and\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA CHILD SMEARED WITH BUTTER WHICH IS LEFT TO BE\r\nABSORBED IN THE SUN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n     Shoka hospitality--How I obtained much information--On a\r\n     reconnoitring trip--A terrible slide.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY are indeed Nature\'s gentlemen, these worthy Shokas, and as such they\r\ndid all in their power to make my stay among them pleasant. It was a\r\ncontest between them as to who should entertain me first, and who should\r\nbe the next. Invitations to breakfast and dinner literally poured in; and\r\nthose convenient "sick headaches," "colds," and "previous engagements,"\r\nso opportune in more conventional parts, were of no avail here. No\r\ncard--no friendly note bade one to come and be merry. They generally\r\narrived _en masse_ to fetch me. Pulling and pushing played a not\r\nunimportant part in their urging, and to decline was thus out of the\r\nquestion. Indeed I must confess there was but little inclination to\r\ndecline on my part. When you arrived, your host spread out fine mats and\r\nrugs, of Tibetan and ancient Chinese manufacture, and often of great\r\nvalue. In front of a raised seat were displayed in shiny brass bowls the\r\nvarious viands and delicacies which constituted the meal. There was rice\r\nalways; there was curried mutton, milk and curd with sugar; then\r\n_chapatis_ made in Hindustani fashion and _Shale_, a kind of sweet\r\npancake made of flour, _ghi_ (butter), sugar or honey, also _Parsad_, a\r\nthick paste of honey, burnt sugar, butter and flour, all well cooked\r\ntogether--a dainty morsel even for a jaded palate.\r\n\r\nI was invariably made to sit on the raised seat, which I did\r\ncross-legged, while the crowd squatted respectfully on the floor round\r\nthe room, forming a semicircle with me in the center. I generally ate\r\nwith my fingers in their own manner, a courtesy they particularly\r\nappreciated, and although I must have seemed awkward to them at first, I\r\nsoon acquired a sort of dexterity in manipulating hot food--meat and\r\nvegetables, for instance--with my hand. The trick is not very difficult,\r\nbut it requires practice. You gather up your five fingers downwards in\r\nthe dish, seizing a mouthful, and with a rapid circular twist of the hand\r\nyou collect as much sauce as you can round the morsel you have caught.\r\nWith a still more rapid movement, and before anything has time to drip\r\nbetween your fingers, you half drop and half throw it into your mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA CHILD BEING SMEARED WITH BUTTER]\r\n\r\nI soon found that I could, during these cordial repasts, enlivened as\r\nthey were by moderate libations of _choekti_ and _syrap_ (wine and spirit\r\ndistilled from wheat), acquire considerable knowledge of anthropological\r\nand ethnological interest, and gather also much valuable information\r\nabout Tibet and its people. They became, in fact, in the few days I spent\r\namong them, confiding to such a degree, and looked upon me so much as one\r\nof themselves, that I soon obtained the run of the whole place. They came\r\nto confide their grievances and troubles; they related to me their\r\nlegends and folk-lore. They sang to me their weird songs and taught me\r\ntheir dances. They brought me to their marriages and strange funerals;\r\nthey took me to their sick men, women, and children, or conveyed them to\r\nme for cure. Thus, to my delight, and with such unique chances, my\r\nobservations of a pathological, physiological, and anatomical character\r\nbecame more interesting to me day by day, and I have attempted to\r\ndescribe in a later chapter some of the things I was able to note.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASTER OF A HIGH SCHOOL ALTITUDE 10,940 FEET]\r\n\r\nAfter lingering in Garbyang for several days, I paid off my two\r\nchaprassis, Matan Sing and Narenghiri, and they returned to Almora.\r\n\r\nOn June 6 I started on a journey towards the frontier, with a view to\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\nCrossing into Nepal territory below Chongur village, and following\r\nupwards the right bank of the Kali River in a direction of 320 deg. (bearings\r\nmagnetic) I reached Kanwa, a Shoka village on a high cliff-like plateau\r\nunder which meet the three rivers Kali, Taki, and Kuti. The Kali turns\r\nsuddenly to 37 deg. (bearings magnetic), while the Kuti River keeps a general\r\ndirection of 325 deg. (bearings magnetic).\r\n\r\nHaving crossed again into Kumaon, I struck camp at Gungi. Before entering\r\nthe village, I passed Dr. Wilson\'s dispensary, not then completed. In the\r\nvillage the houses were decorated with long poles joined by strings, from\r\nwhich hung and flew gaily in the breeze hundreds of wind prayers. The\r\ndwellings were mostly of the ancient, pure Shoka architecture, and not so\r\nfine or so clean as those in Garbyang. The place was picturesque,\r\nclear-cut against the curious background of the dome-like mountain, the\r\nNabi Shankom, a peak of uncommon beauty with its grey and reddish striped\r\nstrata. Near it on another mountain is the Gungi Shankom, a gigantic\r\nquadrangular rock of a warm yellow and reddish colour, not unlike a huge\r\ntower. When I reached its foot, the sun was casting his last dying rays\r\non it, and the picture was so magical that I was tempted to sketch it. As\r\nI sat there, the shadow of the coming night rose higher and higher on\r\nthe mountain-side, tinting it violet blue, and above it the Gungi Shankom\r\nstood resplendent in all its glory like a tower of fire--till night\r\ndescended covering the mountain first, and little by little the Gungi\r\nShankom itself. I shall not easily forget this sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUNGI SHANKOM]\r\n\r\nI slept under my little _tente d\'abri_ and found it delightfully cosy and\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. the next day I raised camp. The elevation here was 10,940\r\nfeet. Interesting was the _Chiram_, a collection of tombs, five in\r\nnumber, made of slabs of white stone with poles placed vertically upon\r\nthem, and from the summit of which hung flying prayers. The Kuti River to\r\nmy left was wide and rapid. On the opposite bank the village of Ronkan\r\n(11,100 feet) made a pretty _vis-a-vis_ to the Nabi village on our side\r\nof the stream, at the same elevation, and directly under the lee of the\r\nNabi Shankom.\r\n\r\nAs I rose gradually along the river course the vegetation grew sparse,\r\nand in front of me there remained nothing but barren rocks and high snowy\r\npeaks. The spot where, from opposite sides, the Gunkan River and the Nail\r\nRiver throw themselves into the Kuti River is most picturesque. There are\r\non the water\'s edge a few pine-trees, but above there is nothing but\r\nwilderness--rock and ice and snow.\r\n\r\nI soon came upon much snow, and places where the track along the\r\nmountain-side was undiscoverable. Walking was tiresome enough on the\r\nloose shingle and shale, but it became worse when I actually had to cut\r\neach step into the frozen snow. The work was tedious to a degree, and\r\nthe progress slow. After a while I noticed a series of lofty snow\r\ntunnels over the raging stream, which is earlier in the season covered\r\nentirely by a vault of ice and snow. The higher I got the harder and more\r\nslippery grew the snow. The soles of my shoes having become soaked and\r\nfrozen made walking very difficult. At 12,000 feet, being about three\r\nhundred feet above the stream, I had to cross a particularly extensive\r\nsnow-field, hard frozen and rising at a very steep angle. Some of my\r\ncoolies had gone ahead, the others were behind. Notwithstanding the track\r\ncut by those ahead, it was necessary to re-cut each step with one\'s own\r\nfeet, so as to prevent slipping. This was best done by hammering several\r\ntimes into the white sheet with the point of one\'s shoe until a cavity\r\nwas made deep enough to contain the foot and to support one upright. It\r\nought to be done carefully each time, but I fear I had not the patience\r\nfor that. I thought I had found a quicker method, and by raising my knee\r\nhigh, I struck the snow with my heel, leaving my foot planted until the\r\nother one had by the same process cut the next step.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZAZZELA MOUNT, NEAR GUNGI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INVOLUNTARY TOBOGGANING]\r\n\r\nIt was in giving one of these vigorous thumps that I hit a spot where,\r\nunder a thin coating of snow, was hard ice. My foot, failing in its\r\ngrip, slipped, and the impulse caused me to lose my balance. I slid down\r\nthe steep incline at a terrific pace, accompanied in my involuntary\r\ntobogganing over ice and snow by the screams of my horror-stricken\r\ncoolies. I realised that in another moment I should be pitched into the\r\nstream, which would have meant being carried under the long tunnel of ice\r\nto meet certain death beneath it. In those few seconds I found time to\r\nspeculate even as to whether those stones by the water\'s edge would stop\r\nme, or whether the impetus must fling me past them into the river. I\r\nattempted to get a grip in the snow with my frozen fingers, to stem\r\nmyself with my heels, but with no success, when I saw ahead of me a large\r\nstone rising above the snow. With desperate tension of every nerve and\r\nmuscle, I knew as I approached it, with the foaming water yonder, that it\r\nwas my only hope. I consciously straightened my legs for the contact. The\r\nbump was tremendous, and seemed to shatter every bone in my body. But it\r\nstopped me, and I was saved only a few feet from the water\'s\r\nedge--miraculously, although fearfully bruised, with no bones broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIRAM]\r\n\r\nMy fingers were cut by the ice and bleeding. When I was able to stand, I\r\nsignalled to the frightened and wailing coolies above to go on, and I\r\nmyself proceeded along the watercourse until I found a spot from which I\r\ncould regain the upper track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n     A palaver--To see is to believe--Dangers and perils on the snow\r\n     and ice--_Thar_ and _Ghural_--Stalking--A tiring climb to 16,000\r\n     feet--The collapse of a snow bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT Kuti I halted and summoned the leading natives to my tent.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible, I asked them, to get over the Lumpiya Pass or the\r\nstill higher Mangshan? The first is a rarely frequented pass on the way\r\nto Gyanema, the other a high and most difficult pass by which it is\r\npossible, though not easy, to reach the Rakstal Lake by the jungle\r\nwithout going near a Tibetan settlement or encampment.\r\n\r\n"No," was the decided answer from all the Shokas. "The snow is now too\r\ndeep. Fresh snow falls daily. For another fortnight at least no human\r\nbeing can get across. To attempt it will mean losing one\'s life. At their\r\nbest during one month in summer, those two passes are arduous and\r\ndangerous. Now it would be mere folly to attempt their ascent."\r\n\r\nWith my distressingly sceptical nature I believe little that I do not\r\nsee. I started next morning to observe for myself. My bearings were\r\nroughly North-West. Seeing me determined, several of the Kutial Shokas\r\nchanged their mind and volunteered to follow me. They were of\r\nconsiderable help in many dangerous places. Here and there a few paces of\r\nnarrow track were uncovered, otherwise we went long distances on frozen\r\nsnow, over precipices down which it was almost fatal to look.\r\n\r\nThe lucky hairbreadth escape of the previous day contributed to make me\r\nlose confidence, not in myself, but in that white emblem of purity and\r\ninnocence, in reality the most treacherous substance in creation. I soon\r\nfound that wherever there was snow there was trouble. In spots where the\r\nsnow was particularly hard frozen we dared not attempt to walk on the\r\nsteep slippery surface, and we had to descend to the river, which was\r\nhere bridged over completely with ice and snow. Crossing, we would\r\nattempt progress on the other side, and having proceeded with difficulty\r\nfor a few hundred yards, had to retrace our steps and try the first bank\r\nagain. We thus crossed and recrossed the Kuti River more than\r\nhalf-a-dozen times, each crossing being preceded by a precipitous descent\r\nand immediately followed by a steep ascent. The cracks in the ice by the\r\nwater-side were constant and perilous, and we did not risk remaining near\r\nthem longer than was necessary. In six or seven hours we had walked a\r\ndistance of less than four miles. Leaving the Kuti River and following\r\ndue North the course of a tributary, the Kambelshio, we crossed over to\r\nits farther bank and pitched our tents at an altitude of 13,420 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KUTI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW BRIDGES OVER THE KUTI RIVER]\r\n\r\nThere remained a few hours of daylight when we arrived, and I employed\r\nthem by going after _Thar_ or _Tehr_ and _Ghural_ (Himahlyan chamois) a\r\ncouple of miles farther. I rose to 15,000 feet on a needle-like peak\r\ntowering over the spot where, in a narrow picturesque gorge, the Tongzu\r\npangti enters the Kuti River. The sources of the Tongzu pangti are about\r\na thousand feet higher than the spot where it meets the Kuti River, and\r\nthe stream has its birth from the melting snows, descending precipitously\r\nand in a very short distance into the larger river.\r\n\r\nThe rocks are here furred with saltpetre, and it is said to be a\r\nfavourite spot for Thar.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SHOKA WOMAN SMOKING]\r\n\r\nI enjoyed my trip so much that, rising with the sun, I started on the\r\nfollowing morning to repeat my experience. Moreover, I wanted to climb to\r\nsome high point wherefrom I could make certain whether it was possible\r\nto proceed immediately across the Himahlyan range, or whether it was\r\nadvisable to wait patiently until the snow had to some extent\r\ndisappeared. I walked four miles from camp, reaching an altitude of\r\n16,000 feet. The ascent was rather tiring. Having wounded a Thar, I went\r\nafter it up a fatiguing snow-field at a speed too great to be comfortable\r\nat such a very high elevation. When I reached the top, I was out of\r\nbreath and the Thar too far off for a second shot.\r\n\r\nThe view this high point commanded was stupendous. For miles and\r\nmiles--and it seemed hundreds of miles--snow, snow, nothing but snow!\r\nThere stood Jolinkan Mount rising above 19,000 feet. On either side of\r\nthe Kuti River were peaks as high as 20,000 feet and more. Here and there\r\nthe white sheet that covered the surrounding country seemed almost\r\ngreenish. Those spots were glaciers, and I saw many of them, feeding as\r\nthey do the numerous streams flowing into the Kuti River. I returned to\r\ncamp for lunch. It was useless to proceed and even more useless remaining\r\nstill. I gave orders to raise the camp, and at 2 P.M. we were under way\r\nback to Kuti.\r\n\r\nThe day had been an unusually warm one, and the surface of the snow, so\r\nhard the previous day, was now soft and watery. Several of the snow\r\nbridges had already disappeared.\r\n\r\nI had descended to the river preceded by some of my coolies. Two of them\r\njust in front of me were crossing over the stream on a thick and broad\r\narchway of ice. I was waiting for them to be safely across. When the men\r\nhad nearly reached the other side they noticed a peculiar vibration\r\nunderfoot. Scrambling away as best they could, they gave the alarm.\r\n\r\nI drew back hastily. In the nick of time! for with a deafening roar like\r\nmagnified thunder echoed from cliff to cliff, down went the bridge. The\r\nhuge pieces of ice, only a moment before forming part of the vault, were\r\nnow swept away by the furious stream and thrown with tremendous force\r\nagainst the next bridge, which quivered under the terrible clash.\r\n\r\nThree days\' marching over the same route brought me back to Garbyang.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] The _Gural_ is the Himahlyan chamois found at even comparatively low\r\nelevations. They are generally seen in herds, with the exception of the\r\noldest males, which are usually met with alone. It is not uncommon to see\r\nas many as eight or ten together, especially during their feeding time,\r\nshortly after sunrise and an hour or two before sunset.\r\n\r\nTehr or Thar (male) and Jahral (female) is the true and proper wild goat\r\nof the higher Himahlyan range. It is rarely found lower than 7000 feet\r\nand often as high as 15,000 feet above sea level. Those found at lower\r\nelevations do not possess quite such a luxuriant growth of hair, nor, I\r\nam told, are their curved horns quite so long. They climb about\r\nprecipices and dangerous spots with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n     An earthquake--Curious notions of the natives--A Shoka tailor and\r\n     his ways--The arrival of silver cash--Two rocks in the\r\n     Kali--Arrogance of a Tibetan spy.\r\n\r\n\r\nON hearing that Dr. Wilson was now in Garbyang I went to call upon him.\r\nSquatted on soft Chinese and Tibetan mats and rugs, we were enjoying cup\r\nafter cup of tea and devouring _chapatis_, when suddenly the whole\r\nbuilding began to shake and rumble in the queerest manner, upsetting\r\nteapot and milk and sending the _chapatis_ roaming to and fro all over\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nLeaving Dr. Wilson to save our precious beverage, I pulled out watch and\r\ncompass to notice duration and direction of the shock. It was undulatory,\r\nvery violent, and oscillating from S.S.W. to N.N.E. The duration was\r\nexactly four minutes two seconds. The earthquake began at 5.20 P.M. and\r\nended at 5h. 24m. 2s.\r\n\r\n"It strikes me that it would have been wise to have gone out of the\r\nhouse," said I. "It is a wonder the building did not collapse. My cup is\r\nfull of mud and debris from the ceiling."[10]\r\n\r\n"I have saved the tea for you!" said the Doctor, triumphantly lifting in\r\nhis muscular hands the teapot, which he had carefully nursed. He had soon\r\ndiscovered my devotion to the yellow liquid.\r\n\r\nWe were quietly going on with our refreshment when a band of excited\r\nShokas broke into the room.\r\n\r\n"Sahib! Sahib! where has it gone?" cried they in a chorus, stretching\r\ntheir hands towards me and then folding them in sign of prayer. "Sahib!\r\ntell us where it has gone!"\r\n\r\n"What?" rejoined I, amused at their suspense.\r\n\r\n"Did you not feel the earth shake and quiver?" exclaimed the astounded\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, but that is nothing."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Sahib! That is the precursory notice of some great calamity. The\r\n\'spirit\' under the earth is waking up and is shaking its back."\r\n\r\n"I would rather it shook its back than mine," said I jokingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WELL-ATTENDED SCHOOL]\r\n\r\n"Or mine," added the Doctor lightly, much to the astonishment of our\r\nawestricken callers.\r\n\r\n"Which way did it go?" repeated the impatient Shokas.\r\n\r\nI pointed towards the N.N.E. and they gave a sigh of satisfaction. It\r\nmust have proceeded to the other side of the Himahlyas.\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to the primitive notions of the Shokas, that inside\r\nthe earth lives in a torpid condition an evil spirit in the shape of a\r\ngigantic reptile. The rumbling preceding an earthquake is, to the Shoka\r\nmind, nothing else than the heavy breathing of the monster previous to\r\nwaking, whereas the actual shock is caused by the brute stretching its\r\nlimbs. When fully awake the serpent-like demon darts and forces its way\r\nin one direction, compelling the earth to quake all along its\r\nsubterranean passage, often causing by so violent a procedure great\r\ndamage to property and loss of life, not to speak of the fear and terror\r\nwhich it strikes in man and beast, should the capricious spirit by chance\r\nmake a return journey to the spot below the earth\'s crust directly\r\nunderfoot. It is curious and interesting, in analysing these crude\r\nnotions, to find that, independently of the cause attributed to its\r\norigin, the Shokas are aware of the fact that an earthquake "travels" in\r\na certain direction. Moreover, common symptoms of the approach of a\r\nviolent earthquake, such as depression and heaviness in the atmosphere,\r\nwhich they attribute to a feverish state of the giant reptile, are\r\nreadily recognised by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY BANKER AND AGENT]\r\n\r\nOn my return to civilisation some months later I discovered that on the\r\nsame day a violent shock was felt all over India, causing considerable\r\ndamage, especially in Calcutta.\r\n\r\nI had on first arriving in Garbyang ordered a tent, and the tailor who\r\nwas entrusted with its manufacture had, after several days\' intoxication,\r\ncompleted it. It was on the Tibetan pattern, with picturesque ornaments\r\nin blue. He had also been making me some Nepalese clothes, and these\r\nreally turned out quite a success, no small wonder considering the way he\r\nwent to work. I had given him cloth and lining, which he took away with\r\nhim, but he never troubled to take my measure! He simply assured me that\r\nthe suit would be ready on the following day. This was of course not the\r\ncase, and on the next afternoon and for six consecutive days he placed\r\nhimself in a state of hopeless intoxication under my window, singing, and\r\nmaking comical salaams each time I, after the custom of the country,\r\nthrew something at him to induce him to go away. On the seventh day I\r\ncaught him and shook him by the ears, explaining that if the clothes were\r\nnot ready before nightfall, I would, in default of other tailors, sew\r\nthem myself.\r\n\r\n"I have a drop too much in me," confessed the amusing rascal. "I will go\r\nto sleep now. When I wake in the afternoon I shall be sober and will\r\nfinish my work. Do not be angry, Sahib. If only you drank yourself,\r\nSahib, you would know how lovely it is to be drunk." His philosophy did\r\nnot agree with mine. But I felt sure that I had so far impressed him,\r\nthat he knew he must risk some personal violence if he delayed much\r\nlonger. Sure enough, late in the evening he came with his work.\r\n\r\n"How they will fit I do not dare to guess," I remarked to Dr. Wilson,\r\n"considering the condition the man has been in while making them, and\r\ntaking into account that he never measured me nor tried them on. After\r\nall, Nepalese clothes should be tight-fitting all over."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VALLEY OF GARBYANG]\r\n\r\nWonderful as it may seem, the clothes fitted like a glove. Clearly, that\r\nman was a genius. Anyhow he was intemperate enough to have been one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day I had gone for a walk along the deserted road from the village. I\r\nwas about a mile and a half from the inhabited part, when three men, who\r\nhad been fast approaching, stood with blunt swords in front of me. They\r\nwaved their blades clumsily and shouted at the top of their voices in an\r\nexcited manner: "_Rupiya! Rupiya!_" ("Rupees! Rupees!") Without thinking\r\nof the money that I had sent for and expected to receive, I took their\r\nattitude as a threatening demand for the cash I might have on me. They\r\nwere really grotesque in their gesticulations, and I brusquely pushed by\r\nthem and continued my constitutional. When they saw me depart, they\r\nscurried away hastily towards Garbyang, and I gave the occurrence no\r\nfurther thought. On my return to the village, however, some hours later,\r\na crowd of Shokas came up to me announcing that my money had arrived, and\r\nthat the scared messengers, not daring to come near me a second time, had\r\ngone to Dr. Wilson\'s house. There I found a _peon_ and two _chaprassis_,\r\nthe three men I had met on the road. They had brought a sum of eighteen\r\nhundred rupees in silver, nearly all in two-anna and four-anna pieces\r\n(sixteen annas to a rupee), which I had sent for from my banker, Anti Ram\r\nSah, at Almora, and which it had taken three men to carry, owing to its\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAfter an easy explanation with these three very peaceful highwaymen, the\r\nsilver was conveyed to my room, and the greater part of the night had to\r\nbe spent in counting the diminutive coins and packing them up in rolls of\r\nten rupees each.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust below Garbyang in the Kali River were, among a mass of others, two\r\nlarge rocks in the centre of the stream. These two rocks were constantly\r\nwatched by the Shokas. The Kali, though named after a small spring below\r\nits real source, is, like most of its tributaries, mainly fed by melting\r\nsnows. The greater quantity of water descends from the Jolinkan, the\r\nLumpiya, the Mangshan, the Lippu, and the Tinker passes. The first four\r\nare in Kumaon, the last in Nepal. It stands to reason that the warmer the\r\nweather the greater is the quantity of snow melting on the passes, and\r\ntherefore the higher the level of the river. When the two rocks are\r\naltogether under water all the passes are known to be open.[11]\r\n\r\nDuring the time I was in Garbyang I never had the luck to see this, but\r\nthe level of the river was daily rising, and the time of tiresome\r\nexpectation was certainly relieved by many amusing, and a few awkward\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\nHaving once been informed of my plans, the Jong Pen of Taklakot in Tibet\r\nwas kept fully acquainted with my movements. His spies went daily\r\nbackwards and forwards with details about me. This my friends confided\r\nto me regularly. One of these emissaries, a stalwart Tibetan, more daring\r\nthan the rest, actually had the impudence to enter my room, and to\r\naddress me in a boisterous tone of voice. At first I treated him kindly,\r\nbut he became more and more arrogant, and informed me, before several\r\nfrightened Shokas to whom he was showing off, that the British soil I was\r\nstanding on was Tibetan property. The British, he said, were usurpers and\r\nonly there on sufferance. He declared that the English were cowards and\r\nafraid of the Tibetans, even if they oppressed the Shokas.\r\n\r\nThis remark was too much for me, and it might anyhow have been unwise to\r\nallow it to pass unchallenged. Throwing myself on him, I grabbed him by\r\nhis pigtail and landed in his face a number of blows straight from the\r\nshoulder. When I let him go, he threw himself down crying, and implored\r\nmy pardon. Once and for all to disillusion the Tibetan on one or two\r\npoints, I made him lick my shoes clean with his tongue, in the presence\r\nof the assembled Shokas. This done, he tried to scamper away, but I\r\ncaught him once more by his pigtail, and kicked him down the front steps\r\nwhich he had dared to come up unasked.\r\n\r\nChanden Sing happened to be basking in the sun at the foot, and seeing\r\nthe hated foreigner make so contemptible an exit, leapt on him like a\r\ncat. He had heard me say, "Ye admi bura crab!" ("That man is very bad.")\r\nThat was enough for him, and before the Tibetan had regained his feet, my\r\nbearer covered his angular features with a perfect shower of blows. In\r\nthe excitement of the moment, Chanden Sing, thinking himself quite the\r\nhero, began even to shy huge stones at his terror-stricken victim, and at\r\nlast, getting hold of his pigtail, to drag him round the yard--until I\r\ninterfered and stopped the sport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANDEN SING AND THE DAKU ROLLING UP MY BEDDING]\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] The ceilings of Shoka houses are plastered with mud.\r\n\r\n[11] N.B. The Lippu Pass, the lowest of all, may be crossed, with\r\ndifficulty, nearly all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n     The _Rambang_--Shoka music--Love-songs--Doleful singing--Abrupt\r\n     ending--Solos--Smoking--When marriage is contemplated--The\r\n     _Delang_--Adultery--Punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTEMA, A SHOKA BEAUTY]\r\n\r\nONE Shoka institution, surprising in a primitive people, but\r\nnevertheless, to my way of thinking, eminently sensible and advantageous,\r\nis the Rambang, a meeting-place or club where girls and young men come\r\ntogether at night, for the sake of better acquaintance, prior to entering\r\ninto matrimony. Each village possesses one or more institutions of this\r\nkind, and they are indiscriminately patronised by all well-to-do people,\r\nwho recognise the institution as a sound basis on which marriage can be\r\narranged. The Rambang houses are either in the village itself, or half\r\nway between one village and the next, the young women of one village thus\r\nentering into amicable relations with the young men of the other and\r\n_vice versa_. I visited many of these in company with Shokas, and found\r\nthem very interesting. Round a big fire in the centre of the room men and\r\nwomen sat in couples, spinning wool and chatting merrily, for everything\r\nappeared decorous and cheerful. With the small hours of the morning, they\r\nseemed to become more sentimental, and began singing songs without\r\ninstrumental accompaniment, the rise and fall of the voices sounding\r\nweird and haunting to a degree. The Shoka men and women possess soft,\r\nmusical voices, and the sounds which they utter are not simply a series\r\nof notes emitted through the throat, but, as it were, the vibration of\r\nimpressions coming from the heart, and transmitted by means of their\r\nvoices to others. Eastern in its character, the Shoka music is pleasing\r\nto the Western ear, not because it possesses quick progressions,\r\nflourishes, or any elaborate technicalities, but because it conveys the\r\nimpression of reality and feeling. The responsive duets, sung by a young\r\nman and answered by a girl, pleased me most. All their songs are\r\nplaintive, and contain modulations of the voice so mysteriously charming\r\nin effect, and so good in tone, that they really affect one profoundly.\r\nThey only sing when the mood takes them; never with a view to please\r\nothers, but always simply to give vent to their emotions. Their\r\nlove-songs generally open with a sentimental recitative, and then change\r\ninto actual singing, with frequent modulations from one key into another.\r\nThe time is irregular, and though certain rhythmical peculiarities recur\r\nconstantly, yet each performer gives to what he sings so strong a\r\npersonality of execution as to make it almost an individual composition.\r\nAny one hearing Shokas sing for the first time would imagine that each\r\nsinger was improvising as he went along, but on closer comparison it will\r\nbe found that musical phrases, certain favourite passages and modulations\r\nin the voice, constantly recur not only in each song, but in all songs.\r\nThey seem all of them based on the same doleful tune, probably a very\r\nancient one, and only the different time in which it is given, and the\r\neccentricities of the singer, give it a separate and special character.\r\nOne characteristic of Shoka songs--as of so many other Oriental tunes--is\r\nthat they have no rounded ending, and this, to my ears, rather spoiled\r\nthem. A similar abrupt break is a feature of their dances and their\r\ndrum-beating. The song suddenly stops in the middle of the air with a\r\ncurious grating sound of the voice, and I could not obtain any entirely\r\nsatisfactory explanation of this: the only answer given me was that the\r\nsinger could not go on for ever, and that as long as he stopped it did\r\nnot matter how he did it. Further, they considered an abrupt ending most\r\nsuitable to music (or dancing), as it immediately brought you back to\r\nyour normal state, should your mind have been carried away. One pleasant\r\nfeature was that their songs were never sung in a loud tone of voice, nor\r\ndid they aim at notes too high or too low for their voices, but kept\r\nthemselves well within their compass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE RAMBANG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA EARRINGS]\r\n\r\nThe only difference between solos given by men, and those sung by women,\r\nwas that the former showed more plaintiveness and sentimentality, and\r\ngreater mutability of thought, whereas the latter were more uniform, more\r\nlively, and less imaginative in their representation of feelings. The\r\nwords of the love-songs, nearly always _impromptu_, can hardly be set\r\ndown in these pages. From our standard of morality, and away from their\r\nown special surroundings, they might seem almost lewd, while in their\r\nplace they certainly did not impress me as offensive. When singing, the\r\nShokas usually raise the end of their white shawl or dress, and hold it\r\nby the side of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER EARRINGS OF TIBETAN ORIGIN, WITH CORAL BEADS]\r\n\r\nSmoking was general, each couple sharing the same pipe. A few burning\r\nsticks of pine stuck in the rough wall formed the only illumination, save\r\nthe fire in the centre of the room slowly burning out. Signs of\r\nsleepiness became evident as morning came, and soon they all retired in\r\ncouples, and went to sleep in their clothes on a soft layer of straw and\r\ngrass. There they slept peacefully in a row, and I retraced my steps to\r\nmy diggings amidst a deafening barking of pariah dogs. At these\r\ngatherings every Shoka girl regularly meets with young men, and while she\r\nentertains the idea of selecting among them a suitable partner for life,\r\nshe also does a considerable quantity of work with her spinning-wheel.\r\nEventually, when a couple consider marriage advisable, the young man,\r\ndressed in his best clothes, proceeds to the house of his intended\r\nfather-in-law, carrying with him a pot of _choekti_ (wine), dried fruit,\r\n_ghur_ (sweet paste), _miseri_ (sugar-candy), and grilled grain. If the\r\nbridegroom is considered a suitable match, the parents of the girl\r\nreceive the young man with due consideration, and partake heartily of the\r\nfood and drink proffered by him. The marriage is there and then arranged,\r\nthe bridegroom further disbursing to the father a sum of not less than\r\nfive rupees and not more than one hundred. This is the etiquette of good\r\nShoka society, and of all people who can afford it, the payment being\r\ncalled "milk-money," or money equivalent to the sum spent by the girl\'s\r\nrelations in bringing her up. The marriage ceremony is simple enough. A\r\ncake called _Delang_ is baked, of which the friends of the two families\r\npartake. If either the bridegroom or bride refuses to eat a share of the\r\ncake, the marriage is broken off; if they both eat some of the cake, and\r\nlater any dissension arises between them, all those who assisted at the\r\nfunction are called as witnesses that the marriage took place. Often even\r\nthis primitive ceremony of eating cake is dispensed with, and Shoka\r\nmarriages begin and continue as happy and faithful unions, without any\r\nspecial form of service or rite to solemnise the tie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA WOMAN WEAVING]\r\n\r\nThey not only visit adultery on the guilty man himself by beating him,\r\nbut the men proceed _en masse_ to the house of his parents and denude it\r\nof all furniture, stores of grain, and merchandise. They confiscate the\r\nsheep, goats, yaks, and all their valuable saddles and loads, and present\r\nthe whole proceeds to the man whose wife has been seduced--a recompense\r\nfor the shame suffered. Frequently the unfortunate and innocent relations\r\nof the evil-doer are bound and even beaten to death by the villagers.\r\nThese severe measures are resorted to in order to maintain a high\r\nstandard of morality and honour, and there is little doubt that,\r\nprimitive as these methods may seem, the good results obtained more than\r\njustify them. There are very few illegitimate births, with the exception\r\nof occasional Rambang children, and their arrival is a matter of such\r\ndisgrace that they cannot be looked upon as seriously discrediting the\r\nsocial value of the Rambang.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAMBANG GIRLS WITH ORNAMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFUNERAL RITES\r\n\r\n     Departure of the Soul--Cremation--Amusement of the dead man\'s\r\n     soul--The lay figure--Feasting--Doleful dance--Transmigration of\r\n     the soul--Expensive ceremonies--Offerings before the lay\r\n     figure--Dancing and contortions--Martial dances--Solo dances--The\r\n     animal to be sacrificed and the lay figure--Chasing the animal\r\n     from the village--Tearing out its heart--The yak driven over a\r\n     precipice--Head shaving--A sacred cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Shokas ascribe death to the departure of the soul from the body, and\r\nto this notion is due the curious reverence they show for the spirit or\r\nmemory of their dead. I witnessed a funeral ceremony quaint enough to\r\ndeserve record.\r\n\r\nA man had died a painful death, the result of an accident. His friends\r\nwere immediately sent for, and the corpse, having been smeared with\r\nbutter (_ghi_), was dressed in his best clothes. They bent his body\r\ndouble before the rigor set in, and placed him on a hurriedly constructed\r\nwooden hearse. He was covered with a blue-and-gold embroidered cloth, and\r\na white one over it. At sunrise, the funeral procession left the house\r\nfor the place of cremation. First came a row of ten women, their heads\r\ncovered with a long strip of white cotton cloth, one end of which was\r\ntied to the hearse. Among these were the near relations of the deceased,\r\nincluding his wife and daughters, crying and wailing the words, "_Oh\r\nbajo! Oh bajo!_" (Oh father! oh father!), the rest of them sobbing and\r\nmaking great show of grief. The deceased having been somewhat of a\r\nfavourite in Garbyang, the villagers turned out in force to render him\r\nthis last tribute, and they took their place in the procession as it\r\nslowly wound down the cliff towards the river. The hearse was carried by\r\ntwo men, and each male Shoka following bore a log or bundle of firewood.\r\nWe reached the Kali. The body was temporarily laid on the bank of the\r\nstream, while all the men, with heads uncovered, collected large stones\r\nand pieces of wood. With the stones a circular crematory oven, five feet\r\nhigh, six feet in diameter, with an opening on the side facing the wind,\r\nwas erected by the water-side. The wife and daughters of the departed,\r\nwith their hoods turned inside out and with covered faces, squatted down\r\nmeanwhile by the hearse, moaning and keeping a small fire alight. When\r\nall preparations were made, the oven being heaped up with logs of wood,\r\nthe body was untied from the stretcher and lifted by two intimates of the\r\ndeparted on to the funeral pile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEEPING WOMEN UNDER WHITE CLOTH]\r\n\r\nAll valuables were removed, his gold earrings, his silver locket and\r\nbracelets; and a large knife was used for some purpose or other which I\r\ncould not quite see, except in slitting the lobes of the corpse\'s ears to\r\nremove his earrings more quickly. Branches of pine-tree were deposited on\r\nthe body, and a large pot of butter was set by its side. A brass bowl of\r\n_choekti_ (wine) was poured on the head, and then, in profound silence,\r\nfire was set to the pile.\r\n\r\nA few white puffs showed that it had caught fire, and then a dense column\r\nof black smoke rose from it, filling the atmosphere with a sickening\r\nsmell of singed hair and burning flesh. The wind blew the smoke towards\r\nme, and I was enveloped in it for some moments, during which I could see\r\nnothing of what was going on, and I felt my eyes smart and my nostrils\r\nfill with the smoke and the stench. Gradually a tall flame, over twenty\r\nfeet high, leaked out, consuming the body and showing me, as the\r\natmosphere cleared, the Shokas down by the river washing their hands and\r\nfaces to cleanse themselves of what they look upon as unclean, the\r\ncontact with a corpse. Retracing their steps to the village, the women\r\ncried and moaned, carrying back to the house the clothes of the deceased\r\nand his brass bowls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOKA FUNERAL PILE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN DUSTING AND CARESSING THE LAY FIGURE]\r\n\r\nReaching home, it was incumbent on them to provide lavishly for the\r\namusement of the dead man\'s soul. A lay figure crudely constructed of\r\nstraw and sticks was attired by them in the clothes of the departed, and\r\ncovered over with Indian fabrics embroidered in gold and red and blue,\r\nand a turban was stuck on the head, with a _panache_ made of a branch of\r\nfir-tree. The _Kalihe_ was at the side of the image. When the fire was\r\nextinguished, a visit was paid to the cremation spot by the relatives of\r\nthe deceased, and such pieces of bone as the knee-joints, elbows, and the\r\nlarger vertebrae of the spine, usually left undestroyed by the flames,\r\nwere collected and deposited inside the clothes of the image. Wheat,\r\nrice, and flour were purchased in large quantities and cooked to provide\r\nfood for the multitude of friends who remained the guests of the family\r\nduring the whole time of the funeral. A sheep a day is usually killed and\r\neaten on such occasions, and cask after cask of _choekti_ (wine), _zahn_\r\n(a liquor distilled from barley, rice and wheat), and _anag_ (from\r\nfermented grain of various kinds) are emptied by the mourning crowd. The\r\nwomen folk of the dead man mourned round the effigy, resting their heads\r\non it, crying and imploring the beloved one to return to life. Other rows\r\nof women, with their hoods turned inside out in sign of mourning, danced\r\ngracefully in circles round the dressed-up figure, left the house by one\r\ndoor in the basement, described an arc in the open, and returned by\r\nanother door, while men were dancing a doleful dance outside the house.\r\nBeating of drums went on the whole day--languid and sad at moments;\r\nexcited, violent and rowdy at others, according to the mood of the\r\nmusicians and the quantity of liquor consumed by them. On each day of\r\nthese proceedings, which lasted for three or four days, rice, baked\r\nwheat, and wine were placed before the effigy, until, when it was assumed\r\nthat the soul of the dead had had a sufficiently amusing time,\r\narrangements were made for its transmigration from the lay figure into a\r\nlive sheep or yak. If the deceased is a man, the animal chosen to\r\nrepresent him is a male; if a woman, a female; but no ceremony of this\r\nsort follows the cremation of children under ten or twelve. In the case\r\nof the old man whose funeral I witnessed, a sheep was chosen, instead of\r\nthe time-hallowed yak, the procuring of which from Tibet used to be a\r\nvery costly business. The use of a sheep for these sacrifices is quite a\r\nrecent innovation, brought into fashion by the greatest Shoka trader in\r\nGarbyang, called Gobaria, whose intention it was to put down the\r\nunnecessary waste of these ceremonies; but many pious Shokas, I was\r\nassured, are not satisfied with so small an offering as a single sheep,\r\nand slaughter two or even more on these occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN DANCING ROUND THE LAY FIGURE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANCE IN FRONT OF DECEASED MAN\'S HOUSE]\r\n\r\nAfter several days\' dancing and gorging indoors, a crowd collects, to the\r\nsound of the drums, outside the habitation. The lay figure is from the\r\nroom transported either directly outside the dwelling or to some\r\npicturesque spot in the woods. This is generally on the fourth day. Bowls\r\nwith food are placed in front of it, and the dancing is begun, to a\r\ncurious sentimental strain, with a graceful series of contortions, by\r\ngirls and women waving large pieces of white material. The legs keep time\r\nwith the arms, and each leg is alternately bent at the knee until it\r\nnearly touches the ground. The head is inclined to the right or left, and\r\nthrown backwards or forwards according to the beating of the drum. The\r\ncircular motion in the dancing begins first very slowly, and the speed\r\nthen increases by degrees, abruptly ending in odd and suggestive\r\npostures. During the intervals of dancing the relatives go round and\r\nround the lay figure, dusting and fanning it with their white cloths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOAT WITH SOUL OF DECEASED BEING FED]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the men join the performance, and though their dancing\r\nhas practically the same characteristics and motions as the women\'s\r\ndance, it is usually so much more violent that it almost partakes of the\r\ncharacter of a war-dance. They hold in their right hands a sword, in the\r\nleft a circular shield, and some of the younger men show great skill in\r\nthe rapid manipulation of their blades, twirling them round their heads\r\nand behind their backs. There are solos, duets and trios, in which the\r\ndrummer or drummers take part, and when the dancing is collective, they\r\nhead the procession, contorting their bodies and beating their drums with\r\na stick on one side and the palm of the hand on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOAT, WITH SOUL AND CLOTHES OF DECEASED]\r\n\r\nThe whole crowd is constantly regaled by the family with corn baked with\r\nsugar, roasted Indian corn, rice, sweets, _ghur_ and _miseri_, when the\r\nlay figure is supposed to have had its fill. While the mob eat, the\r\nladies of the house return to the effigy with quick beating of the drums,\r\nand again double themselves up in solemn lengthy curtsies. Perhaps the\r\nmost interesting, because the most accomplished, were the solo male\r\ndancers, each performer displaying his own particular genius. The drummer\r\nbeats his drum whimsically--fast and slow alternately, with no rule--just\r\nas it pleases his fancy, and the dancer always keeps time with him in\r\nall his frenzies and eccentricities, so that his movements are sometimes\r\nso slow as to be barely noticeable, and at others so rapid that his arms\r\nand legs can no longer be distinguished. I happened to witness no less\r\nthan six funerals simultaneously in Garbyang, and a collective war-dance\r\nof as many as three hundred men. It went on during a whole day and the\r\ngreater part of the following night, torches and a big bonfire burning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENDING THE GOAT AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIAL DANCE ROUND LAY FIGURE]\r\n\r\nEventually, amidst firing of guns, howls, yells and deafening hissing of\r\nthe assembled crowd, the animal to be sacrificed is dragged before the\r\nlay figure. Long coloured ribbons are tied round its horns, and the ends\r\nleft hanging by the side of its head. Sandal-wood is burnt under the\r\nbeast\'s nostrils, which is supposed to induce the soul of the departed to\r\nenter and establish itself in the animal. The clothes, the turban, the\r\nshield, the jewellery, are torn from the figure\'s back and piled on to\r\nthe goat, which is now the impersonation of the deceased. It is fed until\r\nit can hold no more, wine and liquor being poured down its throat, and\r\nlarge dishes of all possible delicacies being placed before it. The women\r\nrelatives devote to it their tenderest affection, and shed tears over it\r\nin the conviction that it holds the spirit of their lost protector.\r\nStuffed with food, and stupefied by the alcohol, the beast submits,\r\nemotionless and immovable, to the wild caresses, prayers, and salaams\r\nshowered on it. Again the hissing, whistling and yelling begin, and a\r\nrush is made for the animal, which is seized by the horns, the neck, the\r\ntail, wherever it can be caught hold of, and dragged, pushed, beaten, and\r\nat last chased out of the village, but not until after the clothes,\r\nshield, sword, turban, and ornaments have been torn from its back. It is\r\neventually handed over to the Hunyas or Jumlis or Humlis, who on these\r\noccasions benefit by the simplicity and superstition of the Shokas, and\r\nwho throw it down, rip the body open, and pull out the heart, or twist it\r\nin the inside with a jerk that kills instantly. This method applies to\r\nsheep or goat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEARING OUT THE HEART OF THE GOAT]\r\n\r\nWhen a yak is sacrificed, very much the same rites take place up to the\r\nmoment when the lay figure is deprived of its clothing and the yak\r\ninvested with it. It is similarly beaten and dragged about, and left on\r\nthe top of some mountain, the crowd calling after it, "Go! go! We have\r\nfeasted, feted and fed you. We have done all in our power for your\r\nwelfare. We cannot do more! Go now!" With this the yak, with the soul\r\nthat has been driven into it, is left to its own devices, and as soon as\r\nthe Shokas have departed, is driven by the Tibetans over a precipice, it\r\nbeing against their faith to draw blood from a yak. In the fatal leap the\r\nanimal is smashed to pieces, and the Tibetans, collecting the remains,\r\ngorge themselves with the prized meat of their cherished yak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YAK DRIVEN OVER PRECIPICE]\r\n\r\nAs a mark of reverence the Shoka men remove their caps not only while\r\nfollowing the corpse to cremation, but also during the feasting, the male\r\nrelatives themselves even shaving their heads; and this practice is\r\noccasionally extended to the whole male community in the case of a\r\nparticularly respected villager dying. The women remove their jewellery,\r\nand, as already noted, turn their hoods inside out.\r\n\r\nWhen all is over, some restitution of his property is made to the dead,\r\nand odd articles, such as brass bowls or a gun or a shield or sword, are\r\nplaced in a sacred cave, which none dare desecrate by entering to remove\r\nanything. These caves are high up on the mountain-sides, and are said to\r\nbe full of sacred offerings, which have accumulated there in the\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nI expressed the wish to see the cave on the mountain side above Garbyang,\r\nbut the natives politely asked me not to do so, as the visit of a\r\nstranger to this sacred spot might bring misfortune on the Shoka living\r\ncommunity. Therefore I abstained from going rather than cause\r\nunpleasantness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n     Touching Shoka farewell--Feelings curiously expressed--Sobs and\r\n     tears--The start--A funereal procession--Distressed father and\r\n     mother--Kachi and Dola the worse for drink--Anxious moments--The\r\n     bridge destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE day of my departure came. It was after dark. Outside my dwelling a\r\ncrowd of Shokas had assembled. I bade farewell to my host Zeheram and to\r\nhis wife and children, who with tears in their eyes wished me God-speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KACHI AND HIS RELATIONS]\r\n\r\n"Salaam, sahib, salaam!" repeated Zeheram, sobbing and bringing his hand\r\nrespectfully to his forehead. "You know, sahib, that a horse goes to a\r\nhorse, a tiger to a tiger, a yak to a yak, and a man to a man. A man\'s\r\nhouse is another man\'s house, no matter whether the colour of our skin\r\ndiffers or not. Therefore I thank Heaven that you have accepted shelter\r\nunder my humble roof. You must have been uncomfortable, for all you\r\nsahibs are rich and accustomed to luxury. I am only a trader and a\r\ncultivator. I am poor, but I possess a heart. You, unlike other sahibs,\r\nhave always spoken kindly to me and to all of us Shokas. We feel that\r\nyou are our brother. You have given us presents, but we needed them not.\r\nThe only present we wish for is that, when you reach the end of your\r\nperilous journey, you will send us a message that you are well. We will\r\nall pray day and night for you. Our hearts are sore at your leaving us."\r\n\r\nThis from the rough old boy, whom I had got really to like, was touching,\r\nand I told him I hoped I might some day be able to repay him for his\r\nkindness. When I descended the steps there was quite a crowd in the yard.\r\nEvery one wished to bid me farewell. The men took my right hand in both\r\ntheirs and brought it up to their foreheads, muttering words of grief at\r\nmy leaving. The women gently caressed my face and bade me "_Niku tza_"\r\n("Go well," "Farewell"). These are the Shoka fashions of taking leave of\r\nfriends who are departing for distant lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PATAN SUMMONING MY COOLIES FROM THE ROOF OF HIS HOUSE]\r\n\r\nLed by the hand by a really grieving company, I moved towards the narrow,\r\nsteep descent to the Chongur bridge, cut into the slope of the high\r\ncliffs of clay. On the way I called at Kachi\'s house, but he had gone\r\nahead. A more mournful procession could not be imagined. The faint rays\r\nof a new moon gave an added melancholy to the scene, and that peculiarly\r\nimpressive sound of sad steps, if I may thus express the pathetic\r\ncadence of people\'s gait when afflicted, made me feel as if I were\r\nattending my own funeral. I begged them to return to their homes, and one\r\nafter the other they came to embrace my feet and to hold my fingers.\r\nThen, hiding their faces in the palms of their hands, they one by one\r\nmade their way up the grey track cut into the lofty cliff, and like\r\nphantoms, gradually becoming smaller and smaller, vanished in the\r\ndistance. Still some twenty or thirty insisted on escorting me down to\r\nthe stream. Farther on I came upon the excited figure of an old woman\r\ntearing her hair and crying pitifully. She threw herself at my feet,\r\nimploring me to take care of her son. It was Kachi\'s distressed mother. I\r\ncomforted her as best I could, and also the desolate father (good old\r\nJunia), who was there with tears streaming down his cheeks, to bid me an\r\naffectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n"Where is your son?"\r\n\r\n"You will find him a little farther down, sahib."\r\n\r\nI did--together with four other people lying on the ground all in a heap.\r\nOne of them who tried to stand up, called out: "Kachi, get up, here is\r\nthe sahib," and then collapsed again on the top of the others. Neither\r\nKachi nor the others gave any sign of life, and when I spoke to them I\r\ndiscovered that they were in a state of hopeless intoxication, arm-in-arm\r\nas they had fallen and slept.\r\n\r\nBy the side of Kachi was Dola, his uncle, supposed to be employed by me\r\nin the quadruple capacity of interpreter, carrier, Kachi\'s valet, and\r\ncook, in which latter art, after Shoka fashion, he was quite an adept,\r\nhis fame having spread all over Bias. He was, therefore, a treasure not\r\nlightly to be abandoned, and yet, now that I wanted to act quickly and\r\ndecisively, I had to weigh whether I should proceed with two of the most\r\nimportant characters in my play disabled. Should I, hampered by these\r\nsemi-corpses, be able to pass unseen the watchful Tibetan guard at the\r\nChongur bridge, only a few hundred yards farther on? I decided to try.\r\nSeizing one on each side under their arm-pits, I supported them and kept\r\nthem erect. It was no easy job, and I felt our speed increase at every\r\nstep as I moved with my staggering mates down the steep and slippery\r\ntrack. We reached the bottom of the hill at a breakneck rate, and as the\r\ntrack was narrow along the water\'s edge, it was a wonder that we did not\r\nall three of us land in the river. As it was, in coming suddenly to a\r\nstop, my two men utterly collapsed again, and I was so exhausted that I\r\nhad to sit down and rest.\r\n\r\nKachi Ram had a lucid interval. He gazed round and saw me for the first\r\ntime that night.\r\n\r\n"Sahib!" he exclaimed, with long pauses between each word, "I am drunk!"\r\n\r\n"That is quite true," said I.\r\n\r\n"We Shokas have this bad habit," he continued. "I had to drink _choekti_\r\nwith all my relations and friends prior to leaving for this long journey.\r\nThey would have been offended if I had not divided with each a cup of\r\nwine. I now see everything go round. Please put my head into cold water.\r\nOh! the moon is jumping about, and is now under my feet!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHONGUR BRIDGE PREVIOUS TO BEING DESTROYED]\r\n\r\nI complied with his request, and gave both his head and Dola\'s a good\r\nducking in the freezing Kali River.\r\n\r\nThis had the unfortunate effect of sending them to sleep so soundly that\r\nI thought they would never wake again. Some of the sober Shokas offered\r\nto carry the two helpless men on their backs. We were wasting valuable\r\ntime and the sky was getting clouded. When the moon had disappeared\r\nbehind the high mountain, I went ahead to reconnoitre. All was darkness\r\nbut for the glimmer of a brilliant star here and there in the sky. I\r\ncrawled to the bridge and listened. Not a sound, not a light on the\r\nopposite bank. All was silence, that dead silence of nature and human\r\nlife asleep. I stopped on the bridge. This structure spans the river, a\r\nhuge boulder in the centre of the stream serving as a pillar, and forms,\r\nin fact, two separate bridges joined on the opposite sides of this\r\ncentral boulder. I walked cautiously across the first portion, stood to\r\nlisten again on the rock dividing the foaming waters, and tried to\r\npenetrate the obscurity. There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to\r\nbe heard. I went over the rock and proceeded towards the second half of\r\nthe bridge, when I found to my horror that this second half of the bridge\r\nhad been cut down. The entire section had collapsed, and with the\r\nexception of a long beam still swinging to and fro with one end in the\r\nturbid stream, and a plank or two, the whole material had been washed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI returned to my men.\r\n\r\n"We must continue our way on this side of the river," I whispered to\r\nthem. "The Tibetans have destroyed the bridge."\r\n\r\n"The track is traced," they replied, "but it is impassable at night."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; we must go. Come." And I headed the silent procession.\r\n\r\nWe went about a mile. Yet another dilemma. Kachi and Dola were still fast\r\nasleep. The others, tired and worn out with the fatigue of carrying them,\r\nwished to turn back. The sky was now clouded all over and rain was coming\r\non.\r\n\r\nI felt that it was useless to persist. Having seen the two drunken\r\ncreatures laid flat under a shed, and well covered with blankets, I\r\ntherefore returned to Garbyang, with the intention of making a fresh\r\nstart shortly before sunrise, when the drunkards would probably be fit to\r\nwalk by themselves, and found shelter under the ever hospitable roof of\r\nDr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n     A dangerous track--Perilous passage--A curious bridge over a\r\n     precipice--Pathetic Shoka custom--Small misadventures--A grand\r\n     reception--Tea for all tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT 4 A.M., before the sun rose, I made a fresh and hurried start. I\r\nproceeded quickly to the spot where I had left the two drunken men. They\r\nhad gone ahead.\r\n\r\nIndeed the track was a bad and dangerous one, overhanging precipices, and\r\nhardly wide enough to give standing room upon it. We came to a spot where\r\nthe narrow path stopped. There was before us a perpendicular rock\r\ndescending straight as a wall to the Kali River. The corrosive action of\r\ndripping water and melting snow, of which last there seemed to be a thick\r\nlayer higher above on the summit of the cliff, had worn the face of the\r\nrock quite smooth. The distance across this vertical wall-like ravine was\r\nnot more than forty or fifty feet. On the other side of it the narrow\r\ntrack began again.\r\n\r\nOwing to this and other dangerous places, this route is but very seldom\r\nused by the natives or by any one else. The road generally taken is on\r\nthe opposite side of the Kali River, in Nepal territory. Nevertheless, a\r\nfew Shokas possess bits of land on this bank of the stream, and it was by\r\nthem that, in order to surmount the obstacle before which I now stood,\r\nthe following expedient was devised in former years.\r\n\r\nBy letting down a man from above with ropes they succeeded in making two\r\nrows of small hollows in the rock, along two parallel horizontal lines,\r\nthe higher of which was about six feet or so above the lower. The holes\r\nwere dug at intervals of three or four feet along each line, the upper\r\nones to be caught on by one\'s hands, the lower ones to support one\'s\r\nfeet, and none of the cavities are deeper than a few inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERILOUS PASSAGE]\r\n\r\nThe transit seemed dangerous at any time, and impossible just then,\r\nbecause the drizzling rain which had set in had wetted the rock and made\r\nit as slippery as glass, but I realised that the thing had to be risked,\r\nand at any cost. With an affected air of assurance, I therefore took off\r\nmy shoes and went ahead.\r\n\r\nI could not look about me, for I clung with my body to the wall, feeling\r\nmy way with my toes and fingers. The cavities were, as a matter of fact,\r\nso shallow that progress was slow and troublesome. When the toes of the\r\nright limb seemed firmly planted in a receptacle, the right arm was made\r\nto slide along the rock until the fingers had obtained a firm grip in the\r\ncavity directly above the one in which the toes were. Then the entire\r\nbody had to be shifted from left to right, bringing the left foot and\r\nhand close to the right extremities and suspending one\'s weight on the\r\nformer, so as to render the right foot and arm ready to make the next\r\nmove forward, and so on, till I reached the other side and alighted upon\r\nthe narrow track, which was itself only five or six inches wide. Chanden\r\nSing having tied his shoes and mine over his shoulders, proceeded\r\nbare-footed on the same hazardous enterprise. With none of the excitement\r\nof personal danger, the moments of apprehension while he groped his way\r\nwith toes and fingers, half paralysed with cold and fear, were to me\r\nworse even than those of my own passage. But he too got across safe and\r\nsound, and after that the rest was comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary now to look out for signs of the two men, Kachi and\r\nDola, who had preceded us. I was glad to find a little farther on fresh\r\nfootmarks, undoubtedly those of the two Shokas. The track still ascended\r\nand descended nearly all along precipitous cliffs, and was everywhere\r\ndangerously narrow, with here and there bits on shaky crowbars. At one\r\nspot the rugged formation of the cliff forced one suddenly to ascend to\r\nits very top and cross (on all-fours) a rude kind of bridge made of\r\nbranches of trees spanned not horizontally, but at an angle of sixty\r\ndegrees over a precipice of several hundred feet. I found a white thread\r\nof wool laid over this primitive structure, in accordance with the custom\r\nof the Shokas at the death of relatives or friends away from their native\r\nvillage. The soul is supposed to migrate during the dark hours of the\r\nnight and to return to the birthplace of the deceased, these white\r\nthreads showing the way at dangerous places on the road.\r\n\r\nHaving lost the track more than once, we found ourselves down at the edge\r\nof the Kali and compelled to climb up some three hundred feet over sand\r\nand rolling stones to regain the path.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at last at Nabi. There I found my loads safe and sound, having\r\ngot here by the better track on the Nepalese side previously to the\r\nChongur bridge being destroyed by the Tibetans, also Kachi and Dola, who\r\nhad got over and recovered from their drink. To make up, perhaps, for\r\ntheir past misbehaviour, and probably to make me overlook or forget it,\r\nthey seemed to have induced the natives to welcome me with particular\r\ncordiality. I was invited by them, with much show of hospitality, to\r\nspend the night in the village.\r\n\r\nI was led with some ceremony to a primitive sort of ladder with very\r\nroughly carved steps, and shoved, with help from above and below, on to a\r\nflat mud roof. Here a tent had been pitched, the floor of which was\r\ncovered with mats and rugs for me to rest on. I no sooner laid myself\r\ndown than a string of men, women and children arrived, carrying bowls\r\nwith a particularly sumptuous meal of rice, _dhal_, meat, _balab_ (or\r\nboiled buckwheat leaves), curd, milk, broiled corn with sugar,\r\n_chapatis_, _shale_, sweets, native wine and liquor.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal, tea was served in all sorts of fashions. There was\r\nChinese tea and Indian tea, tea boiled with sugar and tea without it, tea\r\nwith milk, and tea with butter and salt in it, pale tea and dark tea,\r\nsweet tea and bitter tea--in fact, tea until I--devoted as I am to\r\nit--wished that no tea-leaf had ever been picked and stewed in boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n     Dr. Wilson joins my expedition for a few marches--What misdeeds a\r\n     photographic camera can do--Weighing, dividing, and packing\r\n     provisions--Two extra men wanted--The last friendly faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nI WAS examining a young woman who had badly injured and partly fractured\r\na central vertebra of the spine, when Dr. Wilson turned up and gave the\r\npoor wretch the little relief possible in her condition, for which she\r\nhad hoped in vain from me. He was welcome to me for many reasons besides\r\nthe pleasure of being in his company. He had offered to join my\r\nexpedition for a few marches into Tibet, and I was glad indeed to have\r\nhim with me. We pushed on as soon as possible over the road between Nabi\r\nand Kuti, which I have already described. Our journey was quite\r\nuneventful, and the snow-bridges and snow-fields, so troublesome when I\r\nhad first taken this road, had melted and altogether disappeared. Even at\r\nNabi little happened. But I must just mention the following incident as\r\nillustrative of the curious suspicion and dislike I found everywhere of\r\nthe photographic apparatus I carried with me.\r\n\r\nI was on the point of leaving the place when a handsome Tibetan woman,\r\nwhom I had not previously noticed, accosted me with hysterical\r\nsobs--inarticulate, but conveying a very clear impression of suffering.\r\n\r\n"You have killed my child, and now you will kill my husband," she\r\ncomplained, when she was able to talk; and I then discovered that I had\r\non my previous visit to Nabi taken a snap-shot at a child perched on the\r\ntop of a very heavy load that happened to be carried on the woman\'s back\r\nthrough my camp, and that when she complained I had appeased her, in the\r\nusual way, with a coin. She had conveyed her load to Kuti, and had\r\nslipped, on her way back, with her child--at a spot not far from where I\r\nhad had my slide--but, less fortunate than myself, had rolled right into\r\nthe foaming stream. She managed to cling to the rock and was eventually\r\nsaved, but the infant was washed from rock to rock by the current, and\r\ndisappeared under a snow tunnel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sahib!" cried the woman, "if you had not before we started looked at\r\nus through _the eyes_ (the twin lenses) of your _black box_ (the\r\nphotographic camera), I should not have lost my baby."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT CAUSED THE CHILD\'S DEATH]\r\n\r\n"And how about your husband?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you will kill him too."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know your husband. Anyhow, I promise not to look at him with\r\nthese eyes."\r\n\r\n"It is not that, sahib, but he is coming with you to Tibet. He is\r\ncarrying one of your loads. You will all be killed."\r\n\r\nShe pointed him out to me--one of the strongest among the men I had, and\r\nthe most anxious to accompany me. He was too good to lose, and I was\r\ncertainly unwilling to renounce my claim to him on account of his good\r\nwoman\'s tears. So I consoled her as best I could; promised to take good\r\ncare of him, and under no circumstances to photograph him.\r\n\r\nAt Kuti, Dr. Wilson and I were busy for several hours weighing, dividing\r\nand packing in equal loads the provisions I had purchased: fourteen\r\n_munds_ in all (1120 lbs.) of flour, rice, red sugar (_ghur_), salt, red\r\npepper (32 lbs.), _dhal, miseri_ (lump sugar), _ghi_ (butter), and a\r\nlarge quantity of _satoo_ (oatmeal), and broiled corn. There were, in\r\naddition, the preserved and tinned provisions which I had brought with me\r\nfrom London.\r\n\r\nTo give my carriers no cause for complaint, I allowed them to choose\r\ntheir own shoes, blankets, &c., and I did all in my power to humour them,\r\nbecause the loads threatened to be excessively heavy. In fact, I found\r\nthat, even after dispensing with everything but what was absolutely\r\nessential, there was still ample to carry for at least two strong men.\r\nEvery available Shoka had joined the party, and no inducement that I\r\ncould offer brought me more volunteers. I was very unwilling to delay,\r\nand I was on the point of subdividing among the men I already had the two\r\nextra loads, when two stray shepherds turned up, half famished and naked,\r\nwith long unkempt heads of hair, and only a coral necklace and a silver\r\nbangle by way of clothing. I quickly secured them, and although one was\r\nreally only a boy, I decided to trust to luck and take Dr. Wilson\'s\r\nassurance that he looked tough enough and would be useful.\r\n\r\nThis brought my little force up to thirty strong, and now I was ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF KUTI CASTLE\r\n\r\n1.

It is now\r\nin ruins, with the exception of a quadrangular tower called by the\r\nnatives the Kuti Ker, but the foundations of the whole structure can\r\nstill be plainly seen. I made a plan, which is here reproduced, as it may\r\nbe of archaeological interest. The natives could give me no information\r\nregarding it, except that it was once a king\'s palace strongly fortified.\r\nA small house of several rooms by the side of the tower is said to have\r\nbeen the blacksmith\'s shop in which the arrowheads and swords for the\r\nking\'s soldiers were made. The tower is four yards square at its base,\r\nand built of stone. Judging by its shape and construction, and the\r\ncurious windows, I am inclined to attribute this castle to Tibetan\r\nworkmanship, for identical towers are seen in Tibet, even at Taklakot.\r\nThe windows, or rather slits, on each floor of the tower were six inches\r\nsquare; those in the blacksmith\'s house were considerably larger. There\r\nwere outer walls for the defence of the fort at places where the castle\r\nwould have been most accessible. Quantities of stones piled up in heaps\r\nprobably served as ammunition for the defenders of the fortress in\r\ncenturies gone by.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to camp all was ready, and after endless trouble with\r\nsome of my men, who were already uncertain as to whether they would\r\naccompany me on my journey or not, I eventually got under way in the\r\nafternoon. The Kuti village is the highest in Bias, being situated at an\r\nelevation of 12,920 feet.\r\n\r\nThe track was now comparatively free from snow and ice except here and\r\nthere, where we had to cross extensive slopes covered with snow. On one\r\nof these we had our first disaster. A coolie fell who carried in his hand\r\na large pot containing butter. He fortunately did not slide far down, but\r\nwe had the bitter disappointment of seeing our precious pot roll into the\r\nwater and disappear for ever. We camped at an elevation of 13,050 feet.\r\nLate in the evening, as my men were collecting wood to keep up a huge\r\nfire round which we sat, my two coolies, who had remained at Kuti with\r\ninstructions to follow, arrived with their respective loads. They were\r\ntwo strange characters. The one with a coral necklace was mournful and\r\nsulky, the other lively and talkative. They professed to be by caste\r\nRajiputs.\r\n\r\n"You see," exclaimed the cheerful coolie, "I am small, but I fear\r\nnothing. When we cross into Tibet I shall go ahead with a pointed stick\r\nand clear all the Tibetans away. I am not afraid of them. I am ready to\r\nfight the whole world."\r\n\r\nKnowing the value of this sort of talk on the part of natives, I shut him\r\nup and sent him away to fetch wood. The sulky fellow interested me more.\r\nHe seldom uttered a word, and when he did he never spoke pleasantly; he\r\nwas apparently immersed in deep thought, from which it seemed a great\r\neffort to draw his mind away. He looked painfully ill. Motionless and\r\nspeechless, he would stare at a fixed point as if in a trance. His\r\nfeatures were peculiarly refined and regular, but his skin had that\r\nghastly shiny whitish tinge so peculiar to lepers. I waited for an\r\nopportunity to examine his hands, on which he sat to keep them warm. It\r\nis there, in the contracted or dropping off fingers, that one finds the\r\nfirst certain symptoms of that most terrible of all diseases, leprosy. I\r\nasked the man to come and sit nearer the blazing fire. He came and\r\nstretched out his open palms towards the flickering flame. Alas! my\r\nsuspicions were but too correct. His fingers, distorted and contracted,\r\nwith the skin sore at the joints, were sad and certain proof. I examined\r\nhis feet and found the same symptoms there also.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" I inquired of him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KUTI CASTLE]\r\n\r\n"Mansing," he said drily, becoming immediately again absorbed in one of\r\nhis reveries.\r\n\r\nThe crackling fire was dying down, when a stalwart Tibetan suddenly\r\nappeared bent low under the heavy weight of a huge tree-trunk which he\r\nwas carrying on his back. He approached and threw the wood on the fire.\r\n\r\nHere was another character! As strong as an ox, this servant of mine had\r\nqueer antecedents. He was at one time a well-known bandit in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lhassa. He was said to have taken many lives, and,\r\nfinding his own in danger in his country, had come to settle on our side\r\nof the border, marrying different wives, whom he constantly beat and in\r\nturn banished from under his roof. It was owing to his latest family\r\nsquabble that he came into my employ; his abnormal strength, valuable for\r\ncarrying loads, was to me his only recommendation. In camp he went by the\r\nname of _Daku_, "the brigand."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANSING THE LEPER SHOWING HIS HANDS]\r\n\r\nIn looking round to inspect my other followers, with whom I had hardly\r\nyet got acquainted, I was amused and interested at the strange medley of\r\ncreatures forming my band. There were Humlis and Jumlis with their\r\nluxuriant black hair tied into small tresses and a top-knot over the\r\nhead, like the Coreans. There were Tibetans, Shokas of Bias, Rongbas,\r\nNepalese, Rajiputs and Totolas, also a Brahmin, two native Christians and\r\na Johari. Then Dr. Wilson. What a collection! What a chaos of languages\r\nand dialects!\r\n\r\nAn amusing feature of this odd crowd was that each particular caste\r\nlooked down upon all the others. This from the very beginning occasioned\r\nseparation during mealtime, and the camp was lively with as many burning\r\nfires in as many sheltered spots as there were castes of men following\r\nme. I was glad of this, as it seemed a sort of guarantee that they would\r\nnever all join together to conspire against me.\r\n\r\nPoor Mansing, the leper, was shivering with cold. He had been unable to\r\npurchase himself a blanket and shoes at Kuti. He had spent the money in\r\ntobacco instead. Dr. Wilson and I took pity upon him. The long evening\r\nwas still before us, so I got out the cloth I had purchased at Kuti, and\r\nwith scissors and needle we began to cut and sew a new set of garments\r\nfor the poor wretch. The Doctor did the cutting and I the sewing. I\r\ncannot boast that a professional tailor would not have turned out a\r\nbetter fit, but for all general purposes the newly-made clothes answered\r\nwell enough. There was only one inconvenience in the single-breasted\r\njacket. I had no buttons, and was therefore compelled to sew the coat on\r\nthe man himself. It thus remained a fixture, and not only looked all\r\nright, but--which was our chief object--kept him warm.\r\n\r\nWe left camp at 5.30 the following morning. High mountains rose on either\r\nside of us, and we followed the Kuti River flowing here from West to\r\nEast. At an elevation of 13,980 feet we crossed the Bitroguare River. On\r\nthe other side of the Kuti River were high perpendicular cliffs of a\r\nvividly red-coloured rock with blue horizontal stratifications, and\r\ntowering over them a succession of very pointed peaks.\r\n\r\nThe action of ice on the rock was noticeable everywhere. As we went\r\nfarther we came upon extensive fields of stones and boulders brought down\r\nfrom the higher peaks by the ice, and in some places we found actual\r\n_moraines_. To our left stood a gigantic wall of stone like a natural\r\nimpregnable fortress. Travelling in a direction of 320 deg. (b.m.), and at\r\nelevations of 13,900 feet, 14,200 feet, 14,300 feet, we waded through\r\nthree tributaries of the Kuti; then we came to a foaming, rapid and deep\r\nriver which we had great difficulty in crossing. It was getting towards\r\nthe middle of the day, and the stream, fed by the snows melting under the\r\nhot sun, was rising from moment to moment. Two of my coolies whom I first\r\nsent in reached the middle, where the water came up to their chins. They\r\nlost their footing and were temporarily helpless, and in some danger of\r\nbeing swamped, the loads which they carried on their heads being partly\r\nspoiled when we succeeded in recovering them. The other men got\r\nfrightened by the time they were ready to cross. The river had risen so\r\nhigh that it was impossible to get to the other side except by swimming,\r\nand this was out of the question, on account of the loads. We therefore\r\nhad to follow the stream upwards for about a mile, when fortunately we\r\nfound a somewhat dangerous, yet passable, snow bridge, over which the\r\nremainder of my men and goods effected a crossing in safety. We returned\r\nto our course on the Kuti, still passing between high, rugged mountains\r\nalong an undulating plain averaging about 400 yards wide. Though at\r\ncomparatively high elevations, there were large patches of brightly\r\ncoloured flowers--red, violet, white and vivid yellow--which gave to the\r\nlandscape a picturesque and constantly changing effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JOLINKAN OR LEBUNG PASS]\r\n\r\nOn reaching a small pass, 14,750 feet, the path branched to Darma by the\r\nJolinkan towards bearings 260 deg., and over the Lebung Pass. It is really\r\nonly a goat track, exceedingly difficult and fatiguing, except in the\r\nmonth of August, when there is only a small quantity of snow, and it\r\nleads to the Dholi River about half a mile south of Khumling.\r\n\r\nThe Jolinkan River, rising from the snow field to the East of the Lebung\r\nor Jolinkan Pass, had now to be crossed. The stalwart dacoit, ever ready\r\nto make himself useful, conveyed his load across, and lifting me like a\r\nfeather on to his back, saved me from plunging higher than my waist into\r\nthe bitterly cold water, whereas he was covered up to his neck. The\r\ncourse of the Kuti turns now to 330 deg. (b.m.). Going up and down small\r\nbarren hills, round the foot of high mountains, we attained an altitude\r\nof 15,000 feet. Here, to the left of the track, and eighty feet above it,\r\nis a small and beautiful lake 500 yards long and 400 wide. Its waters, in\r\nwhich the high snowy peaks round it are reflected as in a silver mirror,\r\nfind an outlet in a short but most precipitous river flowing with\r\ntremendous force into the Kuti. Soon after leaving this lake we came upon\r\nanother small sheet of water, near which were thirteen peculiar piles or\r\ncolumns of stones, each one having been erected by the first Tibetan or\r\nShoka who crossed the pass during the summer. A similar erection could\r\nalso be seen perched on a large rock jutting out from the water of the\r\nlarger lake. Though the sun was fast going down behind the mountains to\r\nthe west, we pressed on, trying to make as much headway as we could\r\ntowards the perpetual snows. We still travelled over undulating ground,\r\nand the marching was not heavy or difficult, save for the freezingly cold\r\nand very rapid streams we had to wade through. It was all we could do to\r\nget warm again after having been immersed in one, and before we had\r\nceased shivering we had to wade through the next, and yet the next, so\r\nthat one\'s chilliness increased, and the constant discomfort of cold\r\nbecame very trying. Much discontent prevailed among my carriers over the\r\nvery long march, as their feet were numbed with cold. They nearly\r\nmutinied when I would not let them stop at a camp they had selected, but\r\nordered them to proceed farther. A mile and a half from the point they\r\nhad favoured, we overlooked a large, flat basin of stones and gravel,\r\nabout half a mile wide and three-quarters of a mile long, which had the\r\nappearance of having formerly been a lake. It was surrounded by high\r\nsnowy peaks, and its bed lay at an altitude of 15,400 feet. It seemed as\r\nif the immense quantity of stones and pebbles carried by the river\r\nfeeding it had raised its bed until it had caused the water to flow into\r\nthe Kuti. When I saw it, the river formed an extensive delta with as many\r\nas twelve arms, joining again within the basin into one single stream\r\nbefore throwing itself into the Kuti. Naturally we selected the wider\r\nexpanse of water to ford, assuming that it would be shallower than the\r\nnarrow ones. Once more that day I took off my lower garments and entered\r\nthe cold water. It came direct from the snows, and its temperature was\r\nslightly above freezing-point. The sun had gone down, and there was a\r\npiercing wind. My feet, as I went in and out of the numerous branches of\r\nthe stream, became so cold that I could hardly stand for the stinging\r\npain; moreover, treading on sharp-edged stones under the water and\r\nknocking my frozen toes against them was at first very painful, but after\r\na time they got so frozen that, though at each step the soles of my feet\r\nand toes were cut and bruised, I suffered no actual pain until after\r\ncrossing five or six arms of the delta. Unable to balance myself any\r\nlonger, I struggled as best I could out of the water and rubbed my feet\r\nviolently, until slowly, and with intense pain, they came back to life.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how a little sense of humour helps on such occasions. To an\r\nonlooker not suffering as we were, the sight of our party crossing that\r\ndreadful delta would have been curious. The expression of disgust on all\r\nmy men\'s faces, not to speak of my own, could not but have caused\r\nmerriment. We carried our footgear on our shoulders; we struggled,\r\nstumbled, and splashed in the greenish water, and now one, then another,\r\nfell helpless through frostbite on some island or other, until we were\r\nall disabled, and still only half-way through. In spite of our condition,\r\nworn out as we were, the soles and sides of our feet badly cut and\r\nbleeding, my men, so sulky at having been firmly baulked in their wishes,\r\nbecame quite good-natured and amusing when I chaffed them over their\r\npresent troubles, and they saw that I was in the same plight. After\r\nendless rubbing, we restored a certain amount of circulation to our lower\r\nlimbs, and proceeded to cross the next six arms of the delta. When, after\r\nan hour or longer of suffering, we were at last able to put on our\r\nfootgear, we felt the happiness which comes from the knowledge of\r\ndifficulties overcome. Never can I forget the great joy arising from what\r\nmay seem a small comfort--a warm pair of socks! As I write these lines I\r\nlive over again the particular pleasure of gently drawing them on, and it\r\nis impressed for ever on my mind as a fitting reward for the hardships I\r\nhad put up with.\r\n\r\nWe pitched our tents in a sheltered narrow valley to the North-West of\r\nthe large basin. Altitude, 15,400 feet. Thermometer: Minimum, 24 deg.,\r\nMaximum, 51 deg..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     Want of fuel--Cooking under difficulty--Mansing lost and\r\n     found--Saved from summary justice--Tibetan visitors--We purchase\r\n     sheep--The snow-line--Cold streams--The petrified _chapati_ and\r\n     human hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the main drawbacks of travelling at these great altitudes was the\r\nwant of vegetable fuel. There was not a tree, not a shrub to be seen near\r\nour camp. Nature wore her most desolate and barren look. Failing wood, my\r\nmen dispersed to collect and bring in the dry dung of yak, pony and sheep\r\nto serve as fuel. Kindling this was no easy matter, box after box of\r\nmatches was quickly used, and our collective lung power severely drawn\r\nupon in fanning the unwilling sparks into a flame only a few inches high.\r\nUpon this meagre fire we attempted to cook our food and boil our water (a\r\ntrying process at such an altitude), keeping our own circulation fairly\r\nnormal by constantly required efforts. The cuisine that night was not of\r\nthe usual excellence, and did but little credit to the cook. We had to\r\neat everything half-cooked, or, to be accurate, almost altogether\r\nuncooked. The night was a bitterly cold one, with a heavy fall of snow.\r\nWhen we rose in the morning it lay quite two feet deep around us, and the\r\nglare was painful to the eyes. I mustered my men. Mansing was missing. He\r\nhad not arrived the previous night, and there was no sign of the man I\r\nhad sent in search of him. I was anxious not only from my personal\r\ninterest in his load (the fellow carried a load of flour, salt, pepper,\r\nand five pounds of butter), but I was afraid that the poor leper might\r\nhimself have been washed away in one of the dangerous streams. Even if\r\nthis fear were groundless, he must, I felt, have suffered terribly from\r\nthe cold with no shelter and no fire. Bijesing, who had gone in search of\r\nhim, had eaten some food before starting, and had taken blankets with\r\nhim in case he could not return to camp during the night.\r\n\r\nIt was long after sunrise when, with the aid of my telescope, I\r\ndiscovered the two men coming towards us. They arrived an hour or so\r\nlater. Mansing had been found sound asleep, several miles back, lying by\r\nthe side of the empty butter-pot, the contents of which he had devoured.\r\nThe discovery of this misdeed caused the greatest indignation in camp,\r\nfor fatty matter and butter were much cherished by the natives, as being\r\nwarmth-producing, when going over these cold passes. He was nearly the\r\nvictim of summary justice at the hands of my angry men, and it was only\r\nwith trouble that I rescued him from their clutches. To prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the offence, I ordered the culprit to carry in future a\r\nheavy load of photographic plates and instruments, which I thought would\r\nnot prove quite so appetising.\r\n\r\nBefore starting I took my usual bath in the cold stream and rubbed myself\r\nall over with snow. I found this very invigorating, and when the reaction\r\ncame I experienced a delightful glow of warmth, notwithstanding the thin\r\nclothes I was wearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPING IN SNOW]\r\n\r\nWhile we were camping, a flock of some six hundred sheep appeared, and\r\nwith them some Tibetans. As I had put up my Tibetan tent, they had made\r\nfor it, expecting to find some of their own countrymen, and their\r\nembarrassment was amusing when they found themselves face to face with\r\nDr. Wilson and myself. Hurriedly removing their fur caps, they laid them\r\nupon the ground and made a comical jerky curtsey, as if their heads and\r\nknees moved by means of a spring. They put out their tongues full length\r\nand kept them so until I made signs that they could draw them back, as I\r\nwanted them to answer some questions. This unexpected meeting with us\r\nfrightened them greatly; they were trembling all over with fear, and\r\nafter getting as much information out of them as they seemed to possess,\r\nI took advantage of the opportunity to buy some of their fattest sheep.\r\nWhen the money was paid there was a further display of furred tongues,\r\nand more grand salaams ere they departed, while all hands on our side\r\nwere busy trying to prevent our newly purchased animals from rejoining\r\nthe flock moving away from us. On our next march these animals proved a\r\ngreat trouble, and we had to drag them the greater part of the way.\r\nKachi, who had been entrusted with a very recalcitrant and strong beast,\r\nwhich I had specially promised my men for their dinner if they made a\r\nlong march that day, found himself discomfited when he saw that the sheep\r\nhad freed its head from the cord with which he was dragging it, and was\r\ncantering away full speed in the opposite direction. Now, it is well\r\nknown that at considerable altitudes running is a very painful operation\r\nfor human beings, the rarified air making the effect of such exertion\r\nalmost suffocating. Yet Kachi, having overcome his first surprise, was\r\nsoon chasing the escaped beast, and, urged by the cheers and shouts of my\r\nother men, who seemed much concerned over this new calamity, he\r\nsucceeded, after an exciting chase, in capturing it by its tail, a feat\r\neasier to describe than to accomplish, for Tibetan sheep have very short\r\nstumpy tails. Kachi fell to the ground exhausted, but he held fast with\r\nboth hands to his capture, and eventually the animal was secured with\r\nropes. This was the sort of minor trouble with which we had to contend at\r\nalmost every turn during our journey, and although it may appear trivial,\r\nit was exasperating enough at the time.\r\n\r\nOn fairly undulating ground we gradually rose to a pass 15,580 feet high;\r\nthen traversing a wide flat land, we followed the Kuti River with its\r\nhigh snowy mountains to the West and East. The snow-line was at 16,000\r\nfeet; the snow below this level melts daily, except in a few shaded\r\nplaces. Red and white flowers were still to be seen, though not in such\r\nquantities as lower down, and I saw enamoured couples of small black and\r\nwhite butterflies.[12]\r\n\r\nAfter a while there was yet another bitterly cold stream to ford; two\r\nsmall lakes to skirt; three more deep rivers to wade, with cold water\r\nfrom the snows up to our chests, and then we had to make the best way we\r\ncould through a large field of rocks and stones showing strong\r\nindications of iron, my compasses being at once affected, and becoming\r\nfor a time quite unreliable owing to the deviation. A curious flat\r\ncircular stone, resting on the top of others, was pointed out to me as a\r\nwonder; the accepted legend of the Shokas being that, centuries ago, one\r\nof their countrymen halted by the side of this rock, and having baked a\r\n_chapati_, laid it upon the rock, proceeding to make others, when to his\r\ngreat astonishment, on raising his hand to take his first _chapati_, he\r\nfound it had turned into solid stone, and had furthermore assumed\r\ngigantic proportions. A few feet farther on I was pointed out another\r\nwonder, a great human hand (as the Tibetans and Shokas call it), which is\r\nsupposed to have belonged to the maker of the _chapati_. Not being\r\nsatisfied with his first experience, he laid his hand on the rock, and\r\nthere it remained, petrified, and in this case also, increasing tenfold\r\nin size. I could see, with some stretch of the imagination, a certain\r\nresemblance to an enormous human hand, but the thing required more faith\r\nthan observation.\r\n\r\nMile after mile we marched over sharp stones, wading through a second\r\ntroublesome delta of eight arms fully a mile in width, across a flat\r\nbasin of pointed pebbles and stones, until at last, to our great delight,\r\nwe came to smooth grass land, a soothing comfort to one\'s torn feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SNOW-LINE AT 16,000 FEET]\r\n\r\nHere the Kuti River ran through a large basin, not dissimilar to the one\r\nnear which we had camped the night before, having also the appearance of\r\nlake formation with high perpendicular rocks on the left, which gave one\r\nthe impression of a vast wall--a rugged and forbidding barrier.\r\nProceeding N.W. the basin became wider and the Kuti River turned to the\r\nN.W., while the Mangshan River, descending from the East, joined the\r\nfirst stream in the centre of the basin. In crossing the numerous\r\nbranches of the two rivers we again experienced, with almost accentuated\r\ndiscomfort, the trials and weariness of the preceding day. The water was\r\ncolder than ever, our feet were by this time in a dreadful condition, cut\r\nand bleeding, because it was constantly necessary to walk bare-footed.\r\nAching and benumbed we stumbled on, in and out of water, always, it\r\nseemed, encountering sharp small stones. For us there could be no turning\r\nback however; the pain had to be borne before the march was finished,\r\nand we won our camping-ground at last under the lee of the high chain of\r\nmountains to the North of us, and on the northern bank of the Mangshan\r\nRiver. Directly in front stood the final obstacle, the stupendous\r\nbackbone of the Himahlyas; once past this I should be on that high\r\nTibetan plateau so accurately and picturesquely called "the roof of the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] N.B.--This same kind of butterfly I found at even greater elevations\r\nin Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n     The scouts return--A small exploring party--The Mangshan glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM Kuti I had despatched a sturdy Shoka, named Nattoo, to ascertain\r\nwhether it was possible to cross the chain over the high Mangshan Pass,\r\nas in this case I should be enabled to get many marches into Tibet by the\r\njungle without fear of being detected. I should thus get behind the force\r\nof soldiers which I was informed the Jong Pen of Taklakot had\r\nconcentrated at the Lippu Pass to prevent my entering the country, and\r\nbefore they could have time to discover my whereabouts I should be too\r\nfar ahead for them to find me. Nattoo arrived in camp almost\r\nsimultaneously with ourselves and had a long tale of woe to relate. He\r\nhad been half way up the mountain. The snow was deep and there were huge\r\nand treacherous cracks in the ice. As he was on his way up, an avalanche\r\nhad fallen, and it was merely by the skin of his teeth that he had\r\nescaped with his life. This was to him an evil omen, and he had turned\r\nback without reaching the summit of the pass. He seemed scared and worn\r\nout, and declared that it was impossible for us to proceed that way.\r\nUnfortunately the thrilling account of the Kutial\'s misfortunes had a\r\ndepressing effect on my men. What with the intense cold, the fatigue of\r\ncarrying heavy loads at high elevations over such rough country, and the\r\nfearful rivers which they dreaded, and so many of which we had crossed,\r\nmy carriers became absolutely demoralised at the thought of new hardships\r\nahead, all the more when I assured them that I did not believe Nattoo,\r\nand that I should go and see for myself.\r\n\r\nIt was 4.30 in the afternoon, and therefore some time before sunset.\r\nThere would be moonlight. I had on that day marched eight miles,[13] and\r\nthough the soles of my feet were cut and sore I was not really tired. Our\r\ncamp was at an elevation of 16,150 feet, a pretty respectable altitude\r\nconsidering that the highest mountain in Europe is only 15,781 feet. Dr.\r\nWilson insisted on accompanying me to the top, and Kachi Ram and a Rongba\r\ncoolie volunteered to come as well. Bijesing, the Johari, got on his feet\r\nafter some persuasion, and that completed our little exploration party.\r\nChanden Sing, who was really the only man I could trust, was left in\r\ncharge of the camp, with strict orders to punish severely any one who\r\nmight attempt to turn back during my absence.\r\n\r\nWe set out almost immediately after reaching camp, following up stream\r\nthe course of the Mangshan River, which is boxed in between high cliffs,\r\nthose south of it running in a direction of 100 deg. (b.m.), those to the\r\nnorth converging to 130 deg.; the two ranges eventually meeting in the\r\nglacier at the foot of Mangshan, about three miles E.-E.S.E. of our camp.\r\nThere was no track, and the walking was extremely difficult and\r\ntroublesome, over large slippery stones, between which one\'s feet\r\nconstantly slipped and got jammed, straining and injuring one\'s ankles.\r\nLittle trusting my followers, who seemed on the verge of mutiny, I did\r\nnot care to leave behind in camp the heavy load of silver rupees (R. 800)\r\nsewn in my coat, which, by the way, I always carried on my person, as\r\nwell as my rifle, two compasses (prismatic and luminous), two aneroids,\r\none half-chronometer, and another watch and some thirty cartridges. The\r\ncombined weight of these articles was considerable,[14] and I felt it\r\nespecially during the first days of my march. On this particular\r\nafternoon it was almost too much for my strength. However, one gets\r\naccustomed to most things, and after a while I felt comparatively little\r\ndiscomfort in marching under it. I persisted in thus weighting myself\r\nsimply to be on the safe side, so as to be always prepared in case my men\r\nrevolted or abandoned me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANGSHAN GLACIER]\r\n\r\nWe proceeded up and down the series of hillocks and in and out of the\r\ninnumerable channels that the melting snow and ice had, with the aid of\r\ncenturies, cut deep into the mass of rolling stones. At the point where\r\nthe two ranges met there stood before us the magnificent pale green\r\nice-terraces of the Mangshan glacier, surmounted by extensive\r\nsnow-fields winding their way to the summit of the mountain range. Clouds\r\nenveloped the higher peaks. The clear Alpine ice showed vertical streaks,\r\nespecially in the lower part of the glacier, where it was granulated to a\r\ncertain extent. The base, the sides and top being covered with a thick\r\ncoat of fresh snow, and my time being very limited, I was unable to make\r\ncareful investigations to ascertain the recent movement and oscillations\r\nof this glacier. Judging by the nature of the stony tracts we had passed\r\nover, and also by the mounds, similar to those of a terminal moraine,\r\nwhich increased as we approached the glacier and its snow-covered fringe,\r\nI concluded that the glacier must have retreated considerably. The rocks\r\nand stones, as I have already mentioned, were shiny and slippery, which I\r\nattributed to the friction of the ice, and where the ice had extended\r\nover gravel, this was greatly disturbed, and scarred by innumerable\r\nchannels, due, no doubt, to the mighty force of the moving ice besides\r\nthe constant action of melting snows during the summer. The slopes of the\r\nmountains on the north showed no indication of having been disturbed, but\r\nthe range on the southern side had all the appearance of having been cut\r\nand excavated by the ice. Probably the large basins which I had crossed\r\non my way from Kuti, and even the last one, facing our camp, were after\r\nall reservoirs formed by ancient moraines with alluvial deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] It must be remembered that at high elevations the exertion of\r\nwalking eight miles would be equivalent to that of marching about twice\r\nthe distance at much lower altitudes.\r\n\r\n[14] See Appendix. Letter by Dr. H. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     Snow and troublesome _debris_--The doctor\'s sufferings--Kachi\r\n     disabled--Further trials--A weird apparition--Delirium--All\r\n     safe--The descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Mangshan River rises from this glacier, but we left the glacier\r\n(17,800 feet) to the right, and, turning sharply northwards, began our\r\nascent towards the pass. To gaze upon the incline before us was alone\r\nsufficient to deter one from attempting to climb it, had one a choice; in\r\naddition to this, the snow we struggled over was so soft and deep that we\r\nsank into it up to our waists. Occasionally the snow alternated with\r\npatches of loose _debris_ and rotten rock, on which we were no better\r\noff; in fact, the fatigue of progressing over them was simply\r\noverpowering. Having climbed up half-a-dozen steps among the loose\r\ncutting stones, we felt ourselves sliding back to almost our original\r\npoint of departure, followed by a small avalanche of shifting material\r\nthat only stopped when it got to the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAt 19,000 feet we were for a considerable distance on soft snow, covering\r\nan ice-field with deep crevasses and cracks in it. We had to feel our way\r\nwith great caution, particularly as there was only the light of the moon\r\nto depend upon.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as we rose higher, there were no more crevasses, but I began\r\nto feel a curious exhaustion that I had never experienced before. At\r\nsunset the thermometer which Kachi carried for me had descended forty\r\ndegrees within a few minutes, and the sudden change in the temperature\r\nseemed to affect us all more or less; but we went on, with the exception\r\nof Bijesing, who was seized with mountain sickness so violently that he\r\nwas unable to proceed. The doctor, too, a man of powerful build, was\r\nsuffering considerably. His legs, he said, had become like lead, and\r\neach seemed to weigh a ton. The effort of lifting, or even moving, them\r\nrequired all his energy. Although he was terribly blown and gasping for\r\nbreath, yet he would not give in, and he struggled on bravely until we\r\nreached an altitude of 20,500 feet. Here he was seized with such\r\nexhaustion and pain that he was unable to proceed. Kachi Ram, the Rongba\r\nand I went ahead, but we also were suffering, Kachi complaining of\r\nviolent beating in his temples and loud buzzing in his ears. He also\r\ngasped and staggered dangerously, threatening to collapse at any moment.\r\nAt 21,000 feet he fell flat on the snow. He was instantly asleep,\r\nbreathing heavily and snoring raspingly. His hands and feet were icy\r\ncold, and I rubbed them. But what caused me more anxiety than anything\r\nwas the irregular beating and throbbing of his heart. I wrapped him up in\r\nhis blanket and my waterproof, and, having seen to his general comfort, I\r\nshouted to the doctor, telling him what had happened, and that I was\r\ngoing to push on as much higher as I could stand, the Rongba being now\r\nthe only one of the party who was able to keep up.\r\n\r\nA thick mist came on and enveloped us, which considerably added to our\r\ntrials. Our efforts to get on after we left Kachi at 21,000 feet were\r\ndesperate, our lungs in convulsion as if about to burst, our pulses\r\nhastened, our hearts throbbing (mine being ordinarily very regular) as if\r\nthey would beat themselves out of our bodies. Exhausted and seized by\r\nirresistible drowsiness, the Rongba and I nevertheless at last reached\r\nthe top. It was a satisfaction to have got there, to have reached such an\r\naltitude, although I had long realised the impossibility of getting my\r\nmen over by this way. It served me also to ascertain the amount of snow\r\non the other side of the range, which, when the fog lifted somewhat, I\r\nfound to be greater on the northern slope than on the southern. Although\r\nalmost fainting with fatigue, I registered my observations. The altitude\r\nwas 22,000 feet, the hour 11 P.M., and there was a strong, cutting\r\nNorth-East wind. I had stupidly forgotten to take my thermometer out of\r\nKachi\'s pocket when I left him, and was unable to register the\r\ntemperature, although I had done so only a few minutes before I left\r\nKachi at 21,000 feet. The cold was intense. The stars were\r\nextraordinarily brilliant and the moon shone bright for a while over the\r\npanorama around me, and though it was a view of utter desolation, it had\r\nnevertheless a curious indescribable fascination. Below me, to the\r\nsouth, were mountainous masses buried in snow, and to the South-West and\r\nNorth-East were peaks even higher than the one on which I stood. To the\r\nnorth stretched the immense, dreary Tibetan plateau with undulations and\r\nintricate hill ranges, beyond which a high mountain range with snow peaks\r\ncould just be perceived in the distance. I could see very little snow\r\nnear by, except on the northern slope of the range I was standing on, and\r\non the hill-tops which dotted the plateau.\r\n\r\nI had barely taken it in, barely realised the wonder of nature asleep\r\nwhen the mist again rose before me and I saw a gigantic phantom rising\r\nout of it. It stood in the centre of a luminous circle, a tall, dark\r\nfigure in the folds of an enormous veil of mist. The effect was\r\noverwhelming, and it was only after some moments that I realised that the\r\nspectre wore my features, was a liquid presentation of my own proportions\r\ncolossally enlarged; that I stood in the centre of a lunar rainbow, and\r\nthat I was gazing on the reflection of myself in the mist. As I moved my\r\narms, my body, or my head, the ghostlike figure moved, and I felt myself\r\nirresistibly changing my postures--oddly and nervously at first--then,\r\nwith an awakening sense of the ridiculous in my actions--so as to make my\r\nimage change and do as I did. I felt like a child placed for the first\r\ntime in front of a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe illustration on page 145 represents a solar spectre with circular\r\nrainbow which I saw later on at a comparatively low altitude; the lunar\r\neffect differed from this in that the colours of the rainbow were but\r\nfaintly distinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe Rongba had fallen exhausted, and I felt so faint with the awful\r\npressure on my lungs, that, despite all my efforts to resist it, I\r\ncollapsed on the snow. The coolie and I, shivering pitifully, shared the\r\nsame blanket for additional warmth. Both of us were seized with\r\nirresistible drowsiness, as if we had taken a strong narcotic. I fought\r\nhard against it, for I well knew that if my eyelids once closed they\r\nwould almost certainly remain so for ever. I called to the Rongba. He was\r\nfast asleep. I summoned up my last atom of vitality to keep my eyes open.\r\nThe wind blew hard and biting, with a hissing noise. How that hiss still\r\nsounds in my ears! It seemed like the whisper of death. The Rongba,\r\ncrouched with teeth chattering, was moaning, and his sudden shudders\r\nbespoke great pain. It seemed only common charity to let him have the\r\nblanket, which was in any case too small for both, so I wrapped it\r\ntightly round his head and body. He was doubled up with his chin on his\r\nknees. This small exertion was quite sufficient to make me lose the\r\ntug-of-war in which I was pulling against nature. Just like the subject\r\nwho, under hypnotic influence, feels his own will and power suddenly\r\ngoing from him, so I felt the entire hopelessness of further struggle\r\nagainst the supernatural forces I was contending with. Falling backwards\r\non the snow, I made a last desperate effort to gaze at the glittering\r\nstars ... my sight became dim and obscured....\r\n\r\nFor how long this semi-consciousness lasted, I do not know. "God! how\r\nghastly! Doctor! Kachi!" I tried to articulate. My voice seemed choked in\r\nmy throat. Was what I saw before me real? The two men, as if frozen to\r\ndeath by the side of each other, seemed lying on that vast white sheet of\r\nsnow, motionless as statues of ice. In my dream I attempted to raise\r\nthem. They were quite rigid. I knelt beside them, calling them and\r\nfrantically striving to bring them back to consciousness and life.\r\nBewildered, I turned round to look for Bijesing, and, as I did so, all\r\nsense of vitality seemed to freeze within me. I saw myself enclosed in a\r\nquickly contracting tomb of transparent ice. It was easy to realise that\r\nI too would shortly be nothing but a solid block of ice, like my\r\ncompanions. My legs, my arms were already congealed. Horror-stricken as I\r\nwas at the approach of such a hopeless, ghastly death, my sensations were\r\naccompanied by a languor and lassitude indescribable but far from\r\nunpleasant. To some extent thought or wonderment was still alive. Should\r\nI dwindle painlessly away, preferring rest and peace to effort, or should\r\nI make a last struggle to save myself? The ice seemed to close in more\r\nand more every moment. I was choking.\r\n\r\nI tried to scream! to force myself through the suffocating weight on me!\r\nI gave a violent plunge, and then everything had vanished. The frozen\r\nKachi, the doctor, the transparent tomb! Nothingness!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPECTRE AND CIRCULAR RAINBOW]\r\n\r\nAt last I was able to open my eyes, which ached as if needles had been\r\nstuck into them. It was snowing hard. I had temporarily lost the use of\r\nmy legs and fingers. They were frozen. So violent was the shock of\r\nrealising how very near death I had really been, that in waking up from\r\nthe ghastly nightmare I became acutely alive to the full importance of\r\ninstantly making my way down to a lower level. I was already covered with\r\na layer of snow, and I suppose it was the frigid pressure on my forehead\r\nthat caused the dream. It is, however, probable that, had it not been\r\nfor the hideous vision that shook my nerves free of paralysing torpor, I\r\nshould never have awakened from that spell-bound silence.\r\n\r\nI sat up with difficulty, and by beating and rubbing them, slowly\r\nregained the use of my lower limbs. I roused the Rongba, rubbed him, and\r\nshook him till he was able to move. We began our descent.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the satisfaction of going up high mountains is very great; but\r\ncan it be compared to that of coming down?\r\n\r\nDescending was dangerous but not wearisome. The incline being extremely\r\nsteep, we took gigantic strides on the snow, and when we came to patches\r\nof _debris_, we slid ten or fifteen feet each step amidst a deafening\r\nroar from the huge mass of loose stones set in motion by our descent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I ROUSED THE RONGBA"]\r\n\r\n"Hark!" I said to the Rongba, "what is that?"\r\n\r\nWe waited till all was silence, and with hands up to our ears listened\r\nattentively. It was still snowing.\r\n\r\n"_Ao, ao, ao! Jaldi ao! Tumka hatte?_ Come, come, come quickly! Where are\r\nyou?" cried a faint distressed voice from far down below.\r\n\r\nWe quickened our pace; having hardly any control over our legs, our\r\ndescent was precipitous. The snow-fall ceased and we became enveloped in\r\na thick mist which pierced into our very bones.\r\n\r\nGuided by the anxious cries of the doctor, whose voice we recognised, we\r\ncontinued our breakneck journey downward. The cries got more and more\r\ndistinct, and at last, to my great joy, we came face to face with Wilson,\r\nwho, thank Heaven, was alive but almost helpless, as he said his legs\r\nwere still like lead, and it was all he could do to move them.\r\n\r\nOwing to his anxiety about us, he had been shouting for a long time, and\r\ngetting no answer, he became very uneasy, all the more so as he found he\r\ncould in no way come to our help. He had quite given us up for lost.\r\n\r\nWe looked for and found Kachi. He had slept like a top, curled up in his\r\nwarm blanket and my overcoat, and was now quite refreshed, so all united\r\nagain, we continued our race downwards, exchanging our experiences and\r\nsensations. We had no very serious mishaps, and life and strength\r\ngradually came back to us again when we descended to lower elevations.\r\nThe ascent from the glacier at the bottom of the mountain to the summit\r\noccupied four and a half hours; the precipitous descent, without counting\r\nstoppages, only the ninth part of that time, the distance covered being\r\nabout one mile and three quarters.\r\n\r\nOver the same trying stony valley we reached camp during the early hours\r\nof the morning. The distance from camp to the altitude reached and back\r\nwas over ten miles; therefore, during the twenty-four hours I had\r\naltogether gone eighteen miles (quite a record at such great altitudes).\r\nI may here also remark that, since breakfast at six o\'clock the previous\r\nmorning, I had taken no food of any kind, thus making an interval of\r\ntwenty-three hours between one meal and the next. The anxiety of my men\r\nin camp was intense. They had lost all hope of seeing us again, and they\r\nwere quite reassured when I told them that we would proceed later in the\r\nmorning by the Lumpiya Pass, which was believed to be far easier.\r\n\r\nIn no time they had lighted a fire of dung, and after having had (at five\r\no\'clock in the morning) a handsome feed of rice, _chapatis_, extract of\r\nmeat, and strengthening emergency food, we felt we were entitled to a\r\nwell-deserved rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n     The sources of the Kuti River--The Lumpiya glacier--The summit of\r\n     the range--Bird\'s-eye view of Tibet--Rubso frozen almost to\r\n     death--The Lumpiya Pass--Two coolies in distress.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT 9 A.M. we were ready again to start. The thermometer registered 40 deg.\r\ninside the tent, and the minimum temperature outside during the night had\r\nbeen 14 deg.. We followed the Kuti River at the foot of the mountain range,\r\ntravelling in a direction of 298 deg. (b.m). On rounding a prominent\r\nheadland, where the Kuti River flows through a narrow passage, we saw\r\nfacing us on a mound, fourteen stone pillars and pyramids with white\r\nstones on them and the customary flying prayers of cloth. It is from this\r\npoint that the ascent to the Lumpiya Pass begins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASCENDING THE LUMPIYA PASS]\r\n\r\nThere are two sources of the Kuti Yangti, joining in a large basin; one\r\ncomes from two extensive glaciers to the S.W., the other from a glacier\r\ndirectly under the Lumpiya Pass. The river at the junction of the two\r\nsources is not more than six yards across. Our route gradually ascended,\r\ngoing N.W. first, then swinging away to N.E. until we attained an\r\nelevation of 17,350 feet on a flat basin covered with deep snow. So far\r\nwe had proceeded with no very great trouble or fatigue, but matters\r\nsuddenly altered for the worse. Each coolie in the long silent row at the\r\nhead of which I marched, sank in the snow up to his knees, often up to\r\nhis waist. They formed, undoubtedly, a picturesque sight in this lonely\r\nregion, the only bit of life in the picture, the white frozen sheet of\r\nsnow throwing into strong contrast their faces wrapped tightly round with\r\nwhite turbans. Some wore fur caps with ear flaps; all had long sheepskin\r\ncoats and high boots of skins; many used snow spectacles; and as this\r\nprocession, silent and grave, with loads on their backs, struggled higher\r\nand higher with piteous panting, you speculated apprehensively as to\r\nhow many of them would ever return. Moving cautiously to avoid the many\r\ntreacherous cracks, I made my way ahead with considerable trouble to a\r\nspot six hundred feet higher, where I halted for a while on a rocky\r\nisland fairly clear of snow. As coolie after coolie arrived, breathing\r\nconvulsively, he dropped his load and sat quietly by the side of it.\r\nThere was not a grumble, not a word of reproach for the hard work they\r\nwere made to endure. Sleet was falling, and the wet and cold increased\r\nthe discomfort. There was now a very steep pull before us. To the left,\r\nwe had a glacier beginning in a precipitous fall of ice, about one\r\nhundred feet in height. Like the Mangshan glacier, it was in horizontal\r\nribbon-like strata of beautifully clear ice, showing no dirt bands.\r\nPerpendicular stripes of a darker greenish colour could be observed\r\narising from the unequal degrees of compactness of the ice; the strata\r\nshowed almost horizontal, with no curvatures nor depressions in any part\r\nof them. The top, the base and the sides of the glacier were in this case\r\nalso buried in deep snow.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and I went ahead. In our anxiety to reach the summit, unable\r\nto discern the track, now covered by several feet of snow, we mistook our\r\nbearings, and with great fatigue climbed up an extremely steep incline.\r\nHere we were on a patch of the troublesome loose _debris_, on which we\r\nstruggled for over half an hour until we reached the top of the range,\r\n18,750 feet, considerably higher than the pass itself. Four men had come\r\nwith us, the others, to whom we signalled, bearing more to the west by\r\nanother dangerous track skirting the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe wind from the N.E. was piercing and the cold terrible. Under the lee\r\nof a large rock we found temporary shelter, and through my telescope\r\nscanned the Tibetan plateau spread out before us. From this high eyrie we\r\nobtained a superb bird\'s-eye view. Huge masses of snow covered the\r\nTibetan side of the Himahlyas, as well as the lower range of mountains\r\nimmediately in front of us, running almost parallel to our range. Two\r\nthousand feet below, between these two ranges, flowed, in a wide barren\r\nvalley, a river which is afterwards called the Darma Yankti or Lumpiya\r\nYankti. In the distance, a flat plateau, rising some eight hundred feet\r\nabove the river, and resembling a gigantic embankment of a railway line,\r\ncould be seen extending for many miles; and far away to the north, a\r\nchain of high blue mountains capped with snow, undoubtedly the Kangri\r\nchain with the Kelas peaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LUMPIYA GLACIER AND PASS]\r\n\r\nA painful incident had unfortunately happened to one of my followers:\r\npoor Rubso, a Christian convert, had fallen exhausted from cold and\r\nfatigue. He had been seized with cramp, and was lying in a semi-conscious\r\nstate, his teeth chattering and his features distorted and livid; his\r\neyes were sunken and lifeless, and he showed signs of complete collapse.\r\nWe hastily carried him under the shelter of a rock and rubbed him\r\nvigorously, in the hope of restoring his circulation. After more than\r\nhalf an hour of the greatest anxiety and exertion, to our intense relief\r\nhe partially recovered, and was able to proceed slowly with our help.\r\n\r\nHaving climbed the wrong path, we now had to descend to the pass, six\r\nhundred feet lower. We made our way along dangerous rocks and _debris_. I\r\nwas just clinging with my half-frozen fingers to a prominent rock,\r\nstriving to get on the other side, when screams of distress from below\r\nstruck my ears. Notwithstanding the unsafe position I was in, I could not\r\nhelp turning my head to see what had happened. On the steep incline of\r\nsnow two coolies with their respective loads were sliding, at incredible\r\nspeed. They eventually reached the basin, where the angle of the descent\r\nbeing suddenly altered, it caused them to revolve several times on their\r\nown axes, the different bags, &c., forming their loads, flying about and\r\nbeing scattered in every direction. I gave a sigh of relief when I saw\r\nthe men getting up. One coolie picked up one after the other the goods\r\nthat had been entrusted to him, tied them together, got them on his back,\r\nand began the difficult ascent a second time. The other was crying and\r\nmoaning, so that we could plainly hear him from our elevation. He seemed\r\ngiddy. After a moment or two he staggered, fell back and lay as if dead.\r\nHastening over the slippery rocks, and then down precipitously on the\r\nloose _debris_, I gained the pass, 18,150 feet. Two reluctant men were\r\nimmediately despatched to the relief of the coolie in distress. They\r\nfirst carried his load up, then him. After some time he, too, got over\r\nthe severe shock and fright, and though he was rather shattered and\r\naching all over, I succeeded in persuading the man that nothing was the\r\nmatter with him.\r\n\r\nWe then hurried down the steep declivity on the Tibetan side, to get away\r\nquickly from the bitterly cold, windy pass. Describing a wide arc of a\r\ncircle, and then making straight down across several long snow-beds, we\r\nat last reached the river level and pitched our tents on snow at an\r\naltitude of 16,900 feet. There was no wood, no yak or pony dung, no\r\nlichens, no moss, and therefore nothing with which we could make a fire.\r\nIt seemed hard upon my men that, after such a toilsome day, they should\r\nbe compelled to go to sleep without having had a good meal. They\r\nbelieve--and they are right--that eating cold food at such high\r\nelevations, with such low temperature, leads to certain death. They\r\npreferred, therefore, to remain without food altogether. Night came, and\r\nwith it the wind blowing in gusts, and piling the grit and snow around\r\nour tents. During the nocturnal hours, with the hurricane raging, we had\r\nto turn out of our flapping canvases several times to make the loose pegs\r\nfirmer. Fastening all the frozen ropes was very cold work. At 2 A.M. the\r\nthermometer was down to 12 deg.. At 9 A.M. in the sun, it went up to 26 deg., and\r\ninside the tent at the same hour we had a temperature as high as\r\n32 deg.--freezing-point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n     Mysterious footprints--Brigand or spy?--Passes and\r\n     tracks--Intense cold--No fuel--A high flat plateau--Fuel at\r\n     last!--Two spies in disguise--What they took us for.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a hurricane of grit and drenching rain we packed up our traps as best\r\nwe could and again started on our way. I was slightly in advance when, to\r\nmy surprise, I noticed, some two hundred yards only from camp, a double\r\nline of recent footmarks on the snow. Those coming towards us were\r\nsomewhat indistinct and nearly covered with grit, those going in the\r\nopposite direction seemed quite recent. After carefully examining these\r\nfootprints, I felt pretty certain that they had been made by a Tibetan.\r\nWhere the footprints stopped, marks in the snow showed that the man had\r\nat different points laid himself flat on the ground. No doubt we had been\r\nspied upon and watched. My own men had shown many signs of terror ever\r\nsince we had crossed to this side of the Himahlyas, and were now all\r\nanxiously stooping low over these prints and speculating on their origin.\r\nTheir excitement and fear were strange to watch. Some surmised that the\r\nman must be a _Daku_, a brigand, and that in the evening we should be\r\nattacked by the whole band; others maintained that the spy could only be\r\na Sepoy sent by the Gyanema officers to watch our movements. In any case,\r\nthis incident was held to be an evil omen, and during our march in a N.W.\r\ndirection along the bank of the river we continually saw the trail. The\r\nwildest speculations and imaginations were rife. To the left of us we\r\npassed the valleys leading south to the Neway Pass; then a second to the\r\nKats, 230 deg. (b.m.). The bearings were taken from the mouth of the river\r\ndescending from it, a tributary of the Darma Yangti.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIED]\r\n\r\nSix miles from our last camp, at bearings 340 deg., was the Luway Pass.\r\n\r\nWe were travelling on flat or slightly undulating barren ground. We waded\r\nacross another cold river with water up to our waists, and my men became\r\nso exhausted that one mile farther we had to halt at 16,650 feet.\r\n\r\nThe cold was intense, and again we had no fuel of any kind. A furious\r\nwind was blowing, with snow falling heavily in the evening. My carriers,\r\nhalf starved, ate a little _satoo_, a kind of oatmeal, but Chanden Sing,\r\na Rajiput, could not, without breaking his caste, eat his food without\r\nundressing. It was two days since he had had his last meal, but rather\r\nthan infringe the rules of his religion, or take off his clothes in such\r\nfrigid regions, he preferred to curl up in his blanket and go to sleep\r\nfasting.\r\n\r\nThe doctor left the warmth and comfort of blankets to go and talk with\r\nthe men, and get their views about weather prospects and the chances of\r\nour route. I preferred the comfort of such warmth as I could get in our\r\ntent, where the temperature was 28 deg. Fahr., or four degrees below\r\nfreezing. The snow was lying a foot deep, and it was still falling\r\nheavily. The carriers were all attempting to sleep, huddled as close as\r\npossible to each other for warmth; they refused to move, saying they\r\nwould rather die, and we found it convenient to believe them, and get\r\nwhat warmth and sleep we could under blankets in the tent.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours later the weather cleared. The coolies, half starved,\r\ncame to complain that they were again unable to find fuel to cook their\r\nfood, and that they would leave me. The position of affairs was critical.\r\nI immediately took my telescope and clambered to the top of a small\r\nhillock. It was curious to note what unbounded faith the coolies had in\r\nthis glass. It was evident that they believed in a childlike fashion that\r\nI could see through mountains with it. I came down with the reassuring\r\nnews that one day\'s march further would bring us to a fine supply of\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nThey cheerfully hastened to pack up the loads, and set forth with unusual\r\nenergy in the direction I had pointed out. We followed a parallel line to\r\nthe high flat plateau on the other side of the stream, the slopes of\r\nwhich, in relation to the plain we were standing on, were at an obtuse\r\nangle of about 115 deg.. The snow-covered plateau extended from S.W. to N.E.\r\nBeyond it to the N. could be seen some high snowy peaks, in all\r\nprobability the lofty summits S.E. of Gartok. At the point where the\r\nLuway joins the other three rivers there is a direct way to the summit of\r\nthe tableland, along which it continues across the Himahlyas by the Luway\r\nPass. To our right we were flanked by high rugged mountains, with an\r\noccasional precipitous torrent. Six hours\' brisk marching took us to a\r\nsheltered nook, where a few lichens and shrubs were growing. If we had\r\nsuddenly descended into the Black Forest of Germany, or the Yosemite\r\nValley, with their gigantic century old trees, our delight could not have\r\nbeen greater. As it was, the highest of these shrubs stood no higher than\r\nsix or seven inches from the ground, while the diameter of the largest\r\npiece of wood we collected was smaller than that of an ordinary pencil.\r\nWith feverish activity all hands went to work to root up these plants for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, the same number of hands were busy cooking and\r\ntransferring with alarming celerity such steaming food as was available\r\nfrom the different fires to the mouths of the famished coolies. Happiness\r\nreigned in camp, and all recent hardships were forgotten.\r\n\r\nA fresh surprise was awaiting us when we rose. Two Tibetans disguised as\r\nbeggars had come to our camp. They professed to be suffering from cold\r\nand starvation. I gave orders that they should be properly fed and kindly\r\ntreated. On being cross-examined they confessed that they were spies sent\r\nby the officer at Gyanema to ascertain whether a sahib had crossed the\r\nfrontier, and whether we had seen anything of him.\r\n\r\nWe had so many things to attend to in the morning, and it was so cold,\r\nthat washing had really become a nuisance, and I for my part gave it up,\r\nat least _pro tem._ We were sunburnt, and we wore turbans and\r\nsnow-glasses, so the Tibetans departed under the impression that our\r\nparty consisted of a Hindoo doctor, his brother, and a caravan of\r\nservants (none of whom had seen a sahib coming), and that we were now on\r\na pilgrimage to the sacred Mansarowar Lake and Kelas Mount.\r\n\r\nBefore the men we treated this as a great joke, but, all the same, Wilson\r\nand I anxiously consulted as to our immediate plans. Should we make a\r\nrapid march during the night over the mountain range to our right, and\r\nstrike east by the jungle, or should we face the Gyanema leader and his\r\nsoldiers?\r\n\r\nWe decided to meet them rather than go out of our way, and I gave orders\r\nto raise camp immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n     Lama Chokden--A Tibetan guard--The sacred Kelas--Reverence of my\r\n     men for the Sacred Mountain--Trying hard to keep friends with the\r\n     gods--_Obos_--Water flowing to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE altered our course from N. to N.E., rising to 16,600 feet, and leaving\r\nthe high tableland to the west. We arrived at Lama Chokden (or Chorten),\r\na pass protected by a Tibetan guard, who quickly turned out, matchlocks\r\nin hand, as we approached. They seemed a miserable lot, and not only\r\noffered no resistance, but actually begged for money and food. They\r\ncomplained of ill-treatment by their superiors, stating that they\r\nreceived no pay, and even food was only occasionally sent to them at this\r\noutpost. Their tunics were in rags; each man carried a sword stuck in\r\nfront through the girdle. Here, too, we had more inquiries about the\r\nyoung sahib, as messengers on horseback had been sent post-haste from\r\nTaklakot to warn the Gyanema officer not to let him penetrate into\r\nHundes[15] by the Lumpiya Pass, should he attempt it. Their description\r\nof my supposed appearance was very amusing, and when they said that if\r\nthe sahib came they would have to cut his head off, I felt so touched by\r\ntheir good-natured confidence that I wanted to distribute a few rupees\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n"Do not give them anything, sir," said Kachi and the doctor. "These\r\nfellows are hand and glove with the bands of dacoits; the latter will\r\nsoon be told that we have money, and we shall run great risk of being\r\nattacked at night."\r\n\r\nI insisted on giving them a present.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," cried Kachi, distressed; "do not do it, or it will bring us no\r\nend of trouble and misfortune. If you give them four annas, that will be\r\nample."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY MEN SALAAMING KELAS AT LAMA CHOKDEN]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the officer in command had this large sum deposited in the\r\noutstretched palm of his hand, and to show his satisfaction, he pulled\r\nout his tongue to its full length, waving both his hands at me for some\r\nminutes, and bowing clumsily at the same time. His fur cap had been\r\npreviously removed and thrown on the ground. This was indeed a grand\r\nsalaam, a ceremonious acknowledgment of a gift of something less than\r\nfourpence!\r\n\r\nWhile the doctor remained in conversation with him, I happened to witness\r\na very beautiful sight. To the north the clouds had dispersed, and the\r\nsnow-capped sacred Kelas Mount stood majestic before us. In appearance\r\nnot unlike the graceful roof of a temple, Kelas towers over the long\r\nwhite-capped range, contrasting in beautiful blending of tints with the\r\nwarm sienna colour of the lower elevations. Kelas is some two thousand\r\nfeet higher than the other peaks of the Gangir chain, with strongly\r\ndefined ledges and terraces marking its stratifications, and covered with\r\nhorizontal layers of snow standing out in brilliant colour against the\r\ndark ice-worn rock. The Tibetans, the Nepalese, the Shokas, the Humlis,\r\nJumlis and Hindoos, all have a strong veneration for this mountain, which\r\nis believed by them to be the abode of all the good gods, especially of\r\nthe god Siva. In fact, the ledge round its base is said by the Hindoos to\r\nbe the mark of the ropes used by the devil (Rakas) to pull down the\r\nthrone of Siva.\r\n\r\nMy men, with heads uncovered, their faces turned towards the sacred peak,\r\nwere muttering prayers. With joined hands, which they slowly raised as\r\nhigh as the forehead, they prayed fervently, and then went down on their\r\nknees, with heads bent low to the ground. My brigand follower, who was\r\nstanding close by me, hurriedly whispered that I should join in this act\r\nof prayer.\r\n\r\n"You must keep friends with the gods," said the bandit; "misfortune will\r\nattend you if you do not salaam to Kelas; that is the home of a good\r\ngod!" and he pointed to the peak with the most devout air of conviction.\r\n\r\nTo please him I saluted the mountain with the utmost deference, and,\r\ntaking my cue from the others, placed a white stone on one of the\r\nhundreds of _Chokdens_ or _Obos_ (stone pillars) erected by devotees at\r\nthis spot. These _Obos_, or rough pyramids of stones, are found on the\r\ntracks traversing all high passes, near lakes, in fact, everywhere, but\r\nrarely in such quantities as at Lama Chokden. The hill in front, and at\r\nthe back of the guard-house, was literally covered with these structures.\r\nEach passer-by deposits a stone on one of them--a white stone if\r\npossible--and this is supposed to bring him good fortune, or if he has a\r\nwish he desires accomplished, such a contribution will enhance the\r\nchances of its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nThe guard-house itself was of rough stone, mean and desolate, and in any\r\ncountry but Tibet would not be considered fit accommodation for pigs.\r\n\r\nAfter going a mile or so farther, as the sun was fast disappearing, we\r\nsearched for a suitable spot to pitch our tents. There was no sign of any\r\nwater, only the stony bed of a dried rivulet. We were discussing the\r\nsituation, when a faint sound as of rushing water struck our ears. It\r\ngrew louder and louder, and then we saw coming towards us a stream of\r\nlimpid molten snow, gradually advancing over the bed of stones. Evidently\r\nthe snow of the mountains had taken all day to melt, and the water was\r\nonly now reaching this spot. My dacoit was in a great state of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"Water flowing to you, sahib!" he exclaimed, with his arms outstretched.\r\n"You will have great luck! Look! Look! You want water for your camp, and\r\na stream comes to you! Heaven blesses you. You must dip your fingers into\r\nthe water as soon as it comes up to you, and throw some drops over your\r\nshoulders. Then will fortune attend you on your journey."\r\n\r\nI readily fell in with this Tibetan superstition, and we all dipped our\r\nfingers, and sprinkled the water behind our backs. Wilson, however, who\r\ntook the matter quite seriously, said it was all nonsense, and would not\r\ngive in to such "childish fancy."\r\n\r\nGood fortune would have meant much to me, but in the days to come this\r\nsimple rite proved to have been futile!\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] Hundes = Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n     An extensive valley--Kiang, or wild horse--Their strange\r\n     ways--The Gyanema fort--Apprehension at our appearance--A\r\n     parley--"Cut off our heads!"--Revolt and murder\r\n     contemplated--Hypocritical ways of Tibetan officials--Help\r\n     summoned from everywhere--Preparing for war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN front of our camp was a great stretch of flat alluvial land, which had\r\nbeen, to all appearance, at some remote time the bed of a large lake\r\nabout ten miles long and fourteen wide.

There were many tents, and my men seemed much reassured when by\r\ntheir shape and colour we made them out to be those of the Joharis from\r\nMilam, who come over at this place to trade with the Hunyas[16]. To\r\nE.N.E. we had a valley extending for many miles between two high ranges,\r\nand to the W. and N.W. were hills between us and the Darma Yangti,\r\nflowing there in a N.N.E. direction. Beyond Karko to the North, a stretch\r\nof water, the Gyanema Lake, showed brilliantly, and beyond it some\r\ncomparatively low hill ranges. In the distance, more snowy peaks were\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nOn leaving camp we traversed the plain for six miles in a N.E. direction,\r\nand then, on a course of 80 deg. (b.m.), turned into a smaller valley well\r\nenclosed by hills, following it for a distance of three or four miles.\r\nThis formed, as it were, an arm of the other large valley.\r\n\r\nDuring our march we saw many large herds of _Kiang_ (wild horse). These\r\nanimals came quite close to us. They resembled zebras in shape and\r\nmovement of body, but in colour they were mostly light brown. The natives\r\nregarded their near proximity as extremely dangerous; for their apparent\r\ntameness is often deceptive, enabling them to draw quite close to the\r\nunwary traveller, and then with a sudden dash seize him by the stomach,\r\ninflicting a horrible wound with their powerful jaws. Their graceful and\r\ncoquettish ways were most taking; we occasionally threw stones at them to\r\nkeep them at a safe distance, but after cantering prettily away, they\r\nwould follow us again and come within a few yards. I succeeded in taking\r\nsome very good negatives, which unfortunately were afterwards destroyed\r\nby the Tibetan authorities. I still have, however, some of the sketches I\r\nmade of them. We climbed over another hill range, and descended on the\r\nother side into a grassy stretch of flat land, in the Northern portion of\r\nwhich was a sheet of water. On a hill South of the lake stood the Gyanema\r\nKhar or fort, a primitive tower-like structure of stones, with a tent\r\npitched over it to answer the purpose of roof, supporting a flagstaff, on\r\nwhich flew two dirty white rags. They were not the colours of Hundes, but\r\nonly wind prayers. Lower down, at the foot of the hill, were two or three\r\nlarge black tents and a small shed of stones. Hundreds of black, white,\r\nand brown yaks were grazing on the green patches of grass.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of our party evidently created some apprehension, for we\r\nhad hardly shown ourselves on the summit of the col when from the fort a\r\ngong began to sound loudly, filling the air with its unmelodious metallic\r\nnotes. A shot was fired. Soldiers with their matchlocks were seen running\r\nhere and there. They pulled down one of the black tents and hastily\r\nconveyed it inside the fort, the greater part of the garrison also\r\nseeking shelter within the walls with the _empressement_ almost of a\r\nstampede. When, after some little time, they convinced themselves that we\r\nhad no evil intentions, some of the Tibetan officers, followed by their\r\nmen, came trembling to meet us. The doctor, unarmed, went ahead to talk\r\nwith them, whereas my bearer and I remained with the coolies for the\r\ndouble purpose of protecting our baggage in case of a treacherous attack,\r\nand of preventing my panic-stricken carriers from abandoning their loads\r\nand escaping. But matters looked peaceful enough. Rugs were spread on the\r\ngrass, and eventually we all sat down. An hour\'s trying parley with the\r\nTibetan officers, during which time the same things were repeated over\r\nand over again, led to nothing. They said they could on no account allow\r\nany one from India, whether native or sahib, to proceed, and we must go\r\nback. We on our side stated that we were doing no harm. We were pilgrims\r\nto the sacred Lake of Mansarowar, only a few miles farther. We had gone\r\nto much expense and trouble. How could we now turn back when so near our\r\ngoal? We would not go back, and trusted they would allow us to proceed.\r\n\r\nWe treated them courteously and kindly, and probably mistaking this for\r\nfear they promptly took advantage of it, especially the Magbun[17] or\r\nchief officer in charge of the Gyanema fort. His marked humility, of\r\nwhich at first he had made so much display, suddenly turned into\r\narrogance. "You will have to cut off my head," said he with a vicious\r\ncountenance, "or rather I will cut off yours before I let you go another\r\nstep."\r\n\r\n"Cut off my head?" cried I, jumping on my feet and shoving a cartridge\r\ninto my rifle.\r\n\r\n"Cut off my head?" repeated my bearer, pointing with his Martini-Henry at\r\nthe official.\r\n\r\n"Cut off our heads?" queried angrily the Brahmin and the two Christian\r\nservants of Dr. Wilson, handling a Winchester and a couple of Gourkha\r\n_kukris_ (large knives).\r\n\r\n"No, no, no, no! Salaam, salaam, salaam!" poured forth the Magbun with\r\nthe celerity of speech only possessed by a panic-stricken man. "Salaam,\r\nsalaam," repeated he again, bowing down to the ground, tongue out, and\r\ndepositing his hat at our feet in a disgustingly servile manner. "Let us\r\ntalk like friends!"\r\n\r\nThe Magbun\'s men, no braver than their master, shifted their positions in\r\na nonchalant manner so as to be screened by their superiors in case of\r\nour firing, and on second thoughts, judging even such a precaution to\r\nensure them but scanty safety, they one after the other got up, walked\r\nsteadily away for half-a-dozen steps, to show it was not fear that made\r\nthem leave, and then took to their heels.\r\n\r\nThe Magbun and the other officers who remained became more and more meek.\r\nWe spoke and argued in a friendly manner for two long hours, but with no\r\nappreciable results. The Magbun could not decide of his own accord. He\r\nwould consult with his officers, and he could give us an answer no sooner\r\nthan the next morning. In the meantime he would provide for our general\r\ncomfort and ensure our safety, if we would encamp near his tent. This, of\r\ncourse, I well knew to be an expedient to gain time, so as to send for\r\nsoldiers to Barca, north of the Rakstal Lake, as well as to all the\r\nneighbouring camps. I frankly told him my suspicions, but added that I\r\nwished to deal fairly with the Tibetan authorities before resorting to\r\nforce. I reminded the Magbun again, and made him plainly understand, that\r\nwe were merely peaceful travellers, and had not come to fight; that I was\r\npaying tenfold for anything I purchased from him or his men, and was glad\r\nto do so; but at the same time, let the hand beware that dared touch or\r\ntwist a single hair of any one belonging to my party! The Magbun declared\r\nthat he understood perfectly. He swore friendship, and as friends he\r\nbegged us to stop over the night near his camp. By the Sun and Kunju Sum\r\n(Trinity) he gave a solemn oath that we should in no way be harmed. He\r\ntook humble leave of us and retired.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and I had been sitting in front, next were Chanden Sing, the\r\nBrahmin, and the two Christians. The carriers were behind. When the\r\nMagbun had gone I turned round to look at them. Behold, what a sight!\r\nThey one and all were crying miserably, each man hiding his face in his\r\nhands. Kachi had tears streaming down his cheeks, Dola was sobbing, while\r\nthe Daku and the other Tibetan in my employ, who had for the occasion\r\nassumed a disguise, were concealing themselves behind their loads.\r\nSerious though the situation was, I could not help laughing at the\r\ndemoralisation of my men. We pitched our tents, and I had been sitting a\r\nwhile inside one, registering my observations and writing up my diary,\r\nwhen Kachi crept in, apparently in great distress. He seemed so upset\r\nthat he could hardly speak.\r\n\r\n"Master!" he whispered. "Master! The Tibetans have sent a man to your\r\ncoolies threatening them that they must betray you or die. They must\r\nabandon you during the night, and if you attempt to retain them, they\r\nmust kill you."\r\n\r\nAt the same time that this agent had been sent to conspire with my\r\ncoolies, other envoys of the Magbun brought huge masses of dry dung to\r\nmake our fires, conveying to me his renewed declarations of friendship.\r\nNotwithstanding this, soldiers were despatched in every direction to call\r\nfor help. I saw them start: one went towards Kardam and Taklakot; a\r\nsecond proceeded in the direction of Barca, and a third galloped to the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nMy carriers were evidently preparing a _coup-de-main_ as I watched them\r\nthrough an opening in the tent. They were busily engaged separating their\r\nblankets and clothes from my loads, dividing the provisions among\r\nthemselves, and throwing aside my goods. I went out to them, patiently\r\nmade them repack the things, and cautioned them that I would shoot any\r\none who attempted to revolt or desert.\r\n\r\nWhile the doctor and I sat down to a hearty meal, which rumours in camp\r\nsaid would be our last, Chanden Sing was entrusted with the preparations\r\nfor war on our side. He cleaned the rifles with much care, and got the\r\nammunition ready, for he was longing to fight. The Brahmin, on whose\r\nfaithfulness we could also rely, remained cool and collected through the\r\nwhole affair. He was a philosopher, and never worried over anything. He\r\ntook no active part in preparing for our defence, for he feared not\r\ndeath. God alone could kill him, he argued, and all the matchlocks in the\r\ncountry together could not send a bullet through him unless God wished\r\nit. And if it were the God\'s decree that he should die, what could be the\r\nuse of rebelling against it? The two converts, like good Christians, were\r\nmore practical, and lost no time in grinding the huge blades of their\r\n_kukris_ to the sharpness of razors.\r\n\r\nWhen darkness came a guard was placed, at a little distance off, all\r\nround our camp. It seemed likely that a rush on our tent with the help of\r\nmy treacherous carriers was contemplated, should an opportunity occur.\r\nOne of us kept watch outside all through the night, and those inside lay\r\ndown in their clothes, with loaded rifles by them. I can\'t say that\r\neither Dr. Wilson or I felt particularly uneasy, for the Tibetan soldiers\r\nwith their clumsy matchlocks, long spears, and jewelled swords and\r\ndaggers, inspired us more with admiration for their picturesque\r\nappearance than with fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] Hunyas = Tibetans.\r\n\r\n[17] _Magpun_ or _Magbun_ = General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n     Arrival of a high official--The Barca Tarjum--A tedious\r\n     palaver--The Tarjum\'s anxiety--Permission to proceed--A\r\n     traitor--Entreated to retrace our steps--Thirty armed horsemen--A\r\n     pretty speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUITE early the next morning we were roused by the distant sound of\r\ntinkling horse-bells. On looking out of the tent, I saw a long row of\r\npack-ponies heavily laden, escorted by a number of mounted soldiers with\r\nmatchlocks and spears. It was evident that some high official was coming.\r\nThis advance detachment consisted of his subalterns and his baggage. They\r\ntook a long sweep far away from our tent and dismounted by the Gyanema\r\nfort. Other soldiers and messengers were constantly arriving in groups\r\nfrom all directions. The leader of one party, with a considerable escort\r\nof soldiers, was received with profuse salaams and I concluded that he\r\nmust be an important personage.\r\n\r\nAfter some time a message was sent to us that this new comer, the Barca\r\nTarjum, practically a potentate equal in rank to a king under a\r\nprotectorate, wished to have the honour of seeing us. We replied that we\r\nwere having our breakfast and that we would send for him when we wished\r\nto speak to him. Our experience had taught us that it was advisable to\r\ntreat Tibetan officials as inferiors, as they were then more subdued, and\r\neasier to deal with. At eleven we despatched a messenger to the fort to\r\nsay we should be pleased to receive the Tarjum. He came immediately with\r\na large following, a picturesque figure dressed in a long coat of green\r\nsilk of Chinese shape, with large sleeves turned up, showing his arms up\r\nto the elbow; he had a cap similar to those worn by Chinese officials,\r\nand was shod with heavy long black boots, with large nails under the\r\nsoles. His long, pale, angular face was remarkable in many ways; it was\r\ninterestingly stolid, and though somewhat effeminate, had rather fine\r\nfeatures; unmistakable signs of depravity indicated his low class of mind\r\nand morals. Long hair fell in loose curls down to his shoulders, and\r\nhanging from his left ear was an earring of large dimensions, with\r\nmalachite ornaments and a pendant. In his nervous fingers he held a small\r\nroll of Tibetan material, which he used with both hands as a handkerchief\r\nto blow his nose inconsequently every time that he was at a loss to\r\nanswer a question. The Tarjum and his men were profuse in their bows, and\r\nthere was, as usual, a great display of tongues. These were, I noticed,\r\nof an unhealthy whitish colour, caused throughout Tibet by excessive\r\ntea-drinking, a practice which ruins the digestion, and furs their\r\ntongues. We had rugs placed outside our principal tent, and the doctor\r\nand I sat on one, asking the Tarjum to sit on the one facing us. His\r\nfollowers squatted around him. It is a well-known fact that in Tibet, if\r\nyou are a "somebody," or if you wish people to recognise your importance,\r\nyou must have an umbrella spread over your head. Fortunately, the\r\never-provident doctor had two in his possession; which two of our men\r\nheld over our respective heads. The Tarjum himself was shaded by a\r\nparasol of colossal dimensions, held in position by his secretary.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the extravagant terms of friendship which fell from the\r\nTarjum\'s lips, I was convinced, by close observation of the man\'s face,\r\nthat his words were insincere and that it would be unsafe to trust him.\r\nHe never looked us straight in the face; his eyes were fixed on the\r\nground all the time, and he spoke in a despicably affected manner. I did\r\nnot like the man from the very first, and, friend or no friend, I kept my\r\nloaded rifle on my lap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARRIVAL OF REINFORCEMENTS]\r\n\r\nAfter endless ponderous speeches, clumsy compliments, and tender\r\ninquiries after all relations they could possibly think of; after tiring\r\nparabolic sentences with fine sounds but no meaning; after repeated\r\nblowing of the nose and loud coughing, which always came on opportunely\r\nwhen we asked whether they had yet come to a conclusion as to what we\r\nshould be allowed to do, at last, when my patience was nearly exhausted,\r\nour negotiations of the previous day were reopened. We argued for hours.\r\nWe asked to be allowed to go on. They were still uncertain whether they\r\nwould let us or not. To simplify matters, and hasten their decision\r\nbefore other reinforcements arrived, the doctor applied for permission to\r\nlet only eight of us proceed to Mansarowar. He (the doctor) himself would\r\nremain at Gyanema with the remainder of the party as a guarantee of\r\ngood faith. But even this offer they rejected, not directly, but with\r\nhypocritical excuses and delays, for they thought we would not find our\r\nway, and that if we did, we should find it very rough, and the climate\r\ntoo severe; that the brigands might attack us, and so on, and so on. All\r\nthis was very tiresome, and there were signs even of a nasty side to\r\ntheir attitude. I decided to know what I was about.\r\n\r\nStill holding the rifle cocked at safety on my lap, I turned the muzzle\r\nof it towards the Tarjum, and purposely let my hand slide down to the\r\ntrigger. He became uncomfortable and his face showed signs of wild\r\nterror. His eyes, until now fixed upon the ground, became first unsteady,\r\nand then settled fixedly, and with a look of distress, on the muzzle of\r\nmy rifle. At the same time he tried to dodge the aim right or left by\r\nmoving his head, but I made the weapon follow all his movements. The\r\nTarjum\'s servants fully shared their master\'s fear. Without doubt the\r\npoor fellow was in agony; his tone of voice, a moment before boisterous\r\nand aggressive, now dwindled into the humblest intonations imaginable.\r\nWith much meekness he expressed himself ready to please us in every way.\r\n\r\n"I see that you are good people," said he in a faint whisper, accompanied\r\nby a deep bow. "I cannot give, as I would like to do, my official\r\nsanction to your journey forward, but you can go if you wish. I cannot\r\nsay more. Eight of you can proceed to the sacred Mansarowar Lake. The\r\nothers will remain here."\r\n\r\nBefore giving his final decision he said that he would prefer to have\r\nanother consultation with his officers.\r\n\r\nWe accorded this readily.\r\n\r\nThe Tarjum then presented the doctor with a roll of Tibetan cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BARCA TARJUM AND HIS OFFICERS]\r\n\r\nI had bathed as usual in the morning, and my Turkish towel was spread\r\noutside the tent to dry. The Tarjum, who showed great interest in all our\r\nthings, took a particular fancy to its knotty fabric. He sent for his\r\nchild to see this wonderful material, and when he arrived the towel was\r\nplaced on the youth\'s back as if it were a shawl. I at once offered it to\r\nhim as a present if he would accept it. There were no bounds to his\r\ndelight, and our relations, somewhat strained a few minutes earlier,\r\nbecame now of the friendliest character. We invited the party inside our\r\ntent, and they examined everything with curiosity, asking endless\r\nquestions. They were now quite jovial and pleasant, and even occasionally\r\namusing. Tibetans have a craving for alcohol at all times and they soon\r\nasked me if I had any to give them; there was nothing they would like\r\nmore. As I never carry any when travelling, I could not offer them any\r\nrecognised drink, but not wishing to disappoint them, I produced a bottle\r\nof methylated spirits (which I used for my hypsometrical apparatus). This\r\nthey readily drank, apparently appreciating its throat-burning qualities,\r\nand asked for more. The Tarjum complained of an ailment from which he had\r\nsuffered for some time, and the doctor was able to give him a suitable\r\nremedy, and all the other officers received small presents when they\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a messenger came from the Barca Tarjum. He had good news\r\nfor us. The Tarjum wished us to understand that "as we had been so kind\r\nto him and his followers, he regarded us as his personal friends; and as\r\nwe were so anxious to visit the Mansarowar Lake and the great Kelas\r\nMount, and had already experienced many difficulties and great expense in\r\ncoming so far, he agreed to eight of our party proceeding to the sacred\r\nspots. It was impossible for him to give an official consent, but he\r\nrepeated again that we could go if we wished."\r\n\r\nThis news naturally delighted me. Once at Kelas, I felt sure I could\r\neasily find some means of going farther.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening, a traitor in our camp sneaked from under the tent in\r\nwhich my men were sleeping, and paid a visit to the Tarjum. There is no\r\ndoubt that he told him I was not the doctor\'s brother, nor a Hindoo\r\npilgrim. He disclosed that I was a sahib, and that I was on my way to\r\nLhassa. From what I heard afterwards, it seemed that the Tarjum did not\r\nquite believe his informant; but fresh doubts arising in his mind, he\r\nsent a message during the night, entreating us to return the way we came.\r\n\r\n"If there is really a sahib in your party, whom you have kept concealed\r\nfrom me, and I let you go on, my head will be cut off by the Lhassa\r\npeople. You are now my friends, and you will not allow this."\r\n\r\n"Tell the Tarjum," I replied to the messenger, "that he is my friend, and\r\nI will treat him as a friend."\r\n\r\nIn the morning, we found thirty horsemen fully armed posted some hundred\r\nyards from our tent. To proceed with the demoralised crowd under me, and\r\nbe followed by this company, would certainly prove disastrous and I felt\r\nagain that some ruse was a necessity.\r\n\r\nMuch to the astonishment and terror of the armed force and their\r\nsuperiors, the doctor, Chanden Sing and I, rifles in hand, walked firmly\r\ntowards the contingent of sepoys. After us came the trembling coolies.\r\nThe Magbun and the Tarjum\'s officers could hardly believe their eyes. The\r\nsoldiers quickly dismounted, and laid their arms down to show that they\r\nhad no intention of fighting. We passed them without any notice. The\r\nMagbun ran after me. He begged me to stop one moment. Dola was summoned\r\nto interpret his elaborate speech. A pair of prettily embroidered\r\ncloth-boots were produced from the loose folds of the official\'s coat,\r\nand he offered them with the following words:\r\n\r\n"Though your face is sunburnt and black, and your eyes are sore (they\r\nwere not, as a matter of fact, but I wore snow-spectacles), your features\r\ntell me that you are of a good family, therefore, you must be a high\r\nofficer in your country. Your noble feelings also show that you would not\r\nhave us punished for your sake, and now our hearts are glad to see you\r\nretrace your steps. Let me offer you these boots, so that your feet may\r\nnot get sore on the long and difficult journey back to your native land."\r\n\r\nIt was neatly put, though the mode of reasoning was peculiar. It was not\r\nto my interest to disillusionise the Tibetan as to my purpose, so I\r\naccepted the boots. The Magbun and his guard salaamed to the ground.\r\n\r\nWithout further parleying, we left the Magbun, and retracing our steps,\r\nproceeded in a W.S.W. direction as though we had decided to turn back,\r\nand leave the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n     Spying our movements--Disguised sepoys--A gloomy\r\n     look-out--Troublesome followers--Another march back--An amusing\r\n     incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE reached the summit of the hill and crossed to the other side. My men\r\nwent on down the slope, but I remained, screened by a large stone, to\r\nobserve with my telescope the folks at Gyanema. No sooner had my last man\r\ndisappeared on the other side of the pass, than the cavalrymen jumped\r\ninto their saddles and, raising clouds of dust, galloped after us. This\r\nwas what I had expected. I hastened to rejoin my men. When down in the\r\nplain, I again took my telescope, and watched the sky-line of the hill we\r\nhad just descended. Some thirty heads could be seen peeping over the\r\nrocks from among the boulders. The soldiers had evidently dismounted, and\r\nwere spying our movements. I felt annoyed that they did not openly follow\r\nus, if they so wished, instead of watching us from a distance, so I\r\nsighted my rifle to eight hundred yards, lay down flat, and took aim at a\r\nfigure I could see more plainly than the others.\r\n\r\nThe doctor snatched the rifle from my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"You must not shoot," said he, with his usual calmness; "you might kill\r\nsomebody."\r\n\r\n"I only wish to teach these cowards a lesson."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well. But every man in Tibet is so cowardly that the\r\nlesson would have to be constantly repeated," answered Wilson with his\r\nperpetual wisdom.\r\n\r\nI slung my rifle over my shoulder and made up my mind to start some other\r\ntime on the cyclopean task I had then so nearly begun.\r\n\r\nWhen we had covered a mile or so of the plain, our phantomlike escort\r\ncrossed the pass, and came full gallop down the hill. I gave orders to\r\nmy men to halt, seeing which, the soldiers also came to a dead stop. I\r\nwatched them through the telescope. They seemed to be holding a\r\ndiscussion. At last five men rode full speed northwards, probably to\r\nguard the track in that direction. Three men remained where they were,\r\nand the remainder, as if seized by panic, galloped frantically up the\r\nhill again, and disappeared over the summit.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our march. The three horsemen followed a course one mile south\r\nof ours, close against the foot of the hills, and lying low upon their\r\nponies\' heads, they probably imagined that they were passing us\r\nunperceived. Seeing that our bearings were for our old camp at Lama\r\nChokden, they left our line and rode ahead of us.\r\n\r\nWhen in the evening we reached Lama Chokden, two shepherds came to greet\r\nus. Then another appeared.\r\n\r\n"Our sheep are far away," said they. "We are hungry. We are poor. Can we\r\nstop near your camp and pick up the food that you will throw away?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," I replied. "But mind you do not pick up anything else."\r\n\r\nThese simple folk, thinking I should not know them, had left their ponies\r\nat the Lama Chokden guard-house, and, disguised as shepherds, they were\r\nnow trying to ingratiate themselves with us, with the object of\r\ndiscovering our movements and plans. They were, of course, no other than\r\nthe three sepoys from Gyanema.\r\n\r\nAt each step in our retreat towards the Himahlyas my heart became heavier\r\nand my spirits more depressed. I was full of stratagems, but to think out\r\nplans and to carry them into effect were two different things.\r\n\r\nHow many times had not my schemes been upset? How often had I not had to\r\nbegin afresh when all seemed ready and in perfect working order?--that,\r\ntoo, when I had plenty of good material at my disposal to work upon. Now\r\nthings had changed altogether for the worse. My chances of success,\r\nnotwithstanding my incessant struggle, were getting smaller and smaller\r\nevery day. I could not but feel that there must be an end eventually to\r\nthe capability and endurance of my followers and myself. It is hard\r\nenough to start on a difficult task, but when you are well started, and\r\nhave already overcome many difficulties, to have to come back and begin\r\nagain is more than galling.\r\n\r\nThe outlook was dark and gloomy; I stood face to face with apparent\r\nfailure, and I was uncertain of the loyalty of my own men.\r\n\r\nAt this camp, for instance, the Daku (brigand), who had changed his\r\ndisguise several times since coming in contact with the Tibetans,\r\nannounced his immediate departure. The doctor, with his usual kindness,\r\nhad already entreated him to remain, but without avail. We well knew that\r\nin this region, infested by dacoits, this man was only leaving us to\r\nrecommence his late marauding habits. He would, in all probability, join\r\nsome band, and without much doubt we might soon expect a visit during the\r\ndarkest hours of the night. The Daku knew that I carried a large sum of\r\nmoney, and during the last two days his behaviour had been more than\r\nstrange. Had he come across some of his mates? or had he heard from the\r\nsepoys that they were in the neighbourhood?\r\n\r\nThe Daku had a bundle of his blankets strapped on his back in readiness\r\nfor immediate departure. My men, distressed at this new danger, came to\r\nreport it to me. I immediately sent for him. Speaking bluntly, and\r\nkeeping his eyes fixed on the ground, he said: "I am going, sahib."\r\n\r\n"Where?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"I have friends near here, and I am going to them."\r\n\r\n"Very good, go," I replied, calmly taking up my rifle.\r\n\r\nHis load was off his shoulder in less time than it takes to describe the\r\nevent. He resumed his work as usual. One or two other riotous coolies\r\nwere brought back to reason by similar menaces.\r\n\r\nI heard later that a band of brigands attacked a party near the frontier\r\nonly two days after this occurred.\r\n\r\nAnother march back! How painful it was to me! Yet it was advisable. We\r\nwent a few miles and encamped on the bank of a rapid stream, the\r\nShirlangdu. From this point, with some difficulty and danger, it would be\r\npossible to climb over the mountain range during the night, and attempt\r\nto elude the spies and watchmen, by crossing the jungle to Mansarowar. I\r\nmade up my mind to attempt this. It seemed to add to the risk to have so\r\nlarge a following as my thirty men, so I decided that only four or five\r\nshould accompany me. Going alone was impracticable, because of the\r\ndifficulty of carrying sufficient food, or I would have by far preferred\r\nit. Nevertheless, if the worst came to the worst, I resolved to attempt\r\nthis latter mode of travelling, and rely on the chance of obtaining food\r\nfrom Tibetans.\r\n\r\nAll the loads were made ready. Articles of clothing and comfort, niceties\r\nin the way of food, and extras in the way of medicines, were left behind\r\nto make room for my scientific instruments.\r\n\r\nEach pound in weight more that I dedicated to science meant a pound less\r\nfood to take us to Lhassa. Everything that was not of absolute necessity\r\nhad to be left.\r\n\r\nTwo Tibetan spies came to camp in the afternoon, in the disguise, as\r\nusual, of beggars. They asked for food, and exacted it. Their manner was\r\nunbearably insulting. This was a little too much for us, and Bijesing the\r\nJohari, and Rubso the Christian cook, were the first to enter into an\r\nopen fight with them! They punched and kicked them, driving them down a\r\nsteep ravine leading to a river, then, assisted by other men in camp,\r\nshowered stones upon them. The unfortunate intruders, unable to wade\r\nquickly across the rapid stream, received as fine a reception as they\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nThis little skirmish amused the camp, but many of the Shokas and Hunyas\r\nin my service were still scared out of their wits. It was quite\r\nsufficient for them to see a Tibetan to crumble into nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     An attempt that failed--A resolution--A smart Shoka lad--The\r\n     plucky Chanden Sing proposes to accompany me--Mansing the leper\r\n     becomes my servant\'s servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hour fixed for my flight was 9 P.M. Five men had been induced to\r\nfollow me by the offer of a handsome reward.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed no single one of them had put in an appearance. I\r\nwent in search of them. One man had purposely injured his feet and was\r\ndisabled, another pretended to be dying, the others positively refused to\r\ncome. They were shivering with fright and cold.\r\n\r\n"Kill us, sahib, if you like," they implored of me, "but we will not\r\nfollow you."\r\n\r\nAt 3 A.M. all attempts to get even one man to carry a load had proved\r\nfutile. I had to abandon the idea of starting.\r\n\r\nMy prospects became more gloomy than ever. Another march back towards the\r\ncold and dreary pass by which I had entered Tibet!\r\n\r\n"You are depressed, Mr. Landor," remarked the doctor.\r\n\r\nI admitted the fact. Every step backwards was to me like a stab in the\r\nheart. I had wished to push on at all costs, and it was only in\r\nconsideration of my good and kind friend, the doctor, that I had\r\nreluctantly refrained from making my way by force. My blood was boiling.\r\nI felt feverish. The cowardice of my men made them absolutely\r\ncontemptible, and I could not bear to see them even.\r\n\r\nImmersed in my thoughts, I walked quickly on, and the rugged way seemed\r\nshort and easy. I found a suitable spot for our next camp. Here before\r\nme, and on every side, stood high snowy mountains; there, in front,\r\ntowered that same Lumpiya Pass by which I had crossed into Tibet with\r\nsuch high hopes. I detested the sight of it on the present occasion; its\r\nsnowy slopes seemed to mock at my failure.\r\n\r\nWhether it is that storms invariably come when one is depressed, or\r\nwhether one gets depressed when storms are coming, I am not here prepared\r\nto say, but the fact remains that, before we had time to pitch our tents,\r\nthe wind, which had been high all through the afternoon, increased\r\ntenfold. The clouds above were wild and threatening, and snow soon fell\r\nin feathery flakes.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" inquired the doctor of me. "I think you had\r\nbetter return to Garbyang, get fresh men, and make another start."\r\n\r\n"No, doctor. I will die rather than continue this backward march. There\r\nwill be a far better chance if I go alone, and I have resolved to start\r\nto-night, for I am convinced that I shall find my way over the range."\r\n\r\n"No, no, it is impossible, Mr. Landor," cried the doctor, with tears in\r\nhis eyes. "That must mean death to any one attempting it."\r\n\r\nI told him that I was quite determined.\r\n\r\nThe poor doctor was dumbfounded. He knew that it was useless to try to\r\ndissuade me. I went into the tent to rearrange and reduce my baggage,\r\nmaking a load small enough to carry on my back, in addition to the daily\r\nkit and instruments.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was making preparations for my journey, Kachi Ram entered the\r\ntent. He looked frightened and perplexed.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing, sir?" inquired he hurriedly. "The doctor says you\r\nare going to leave alone to-night, cross the mountain range, and go to\r\nLhassa by yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is true."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! The perils and dangers are too great, you cannot go."\r\n\r\n"I know, but I am going to try."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! Then I will come with you."\r\n\r\n"No, Kachi. You will suffer too much. Go back to your father and mother\r\nnow that you have the opportunity."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; where you go, I will go. Small men never suffer. If they do it\r\ndoes not matter. Only great men\'s sufferings are worth noticing. If you\r\nsuffer, I will suffer. I will come."\r\n\r\nKachi\'s philosophy touched me. I ascertained beyond doubt that he meant\r\nwhat he said, and then decided to take him.\r\n\r\nThis was a piece of luck. Kachi Ram had five bosom friends among the\r\nyoung Shoka coolies. They were all friends of the Rambang, and in the\r\nevenings in camp they often used to join and sing weird songs in honour\r\nof the fair maids of their hearts, whom they had left on the other side\r\nof the Himahlyas.\r\n\r\nKachi hurried away in a state of feverish excitement. He was back in a\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\n"How many coolies will you take, sir?"\r\n\r\n"None will come."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will get them. Will five do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I murmured incredulously.\r\n\r\nMy scepticism sustained a shock when Kachi returned, buoyant, saying in\r\nhis peculiar English:\r\n\r\n"Five Shokas come, sir. Then you, sir, I, sir, five coolies, sir, start\r\nnight-time, what clock?"\r\n\r\n"By Jove, Kachi," I could not help exclaiming, "you are a smart lad."\r\n\r\n"\'Smart,\' sir?" inquired he sharply, hearing a new word. He was most\r\nanxious to learn English, and he had a mania for spelling. "\'Smart!\' What\r\nis meaning? How spell?"\r\n\r\n"S-m-a-r-t. It means \'quick, intelligent.\'"\r\n\r\n"Smart," he repeated solemnly, as he wrote the newly-acquired word in a\r\nbook which I had given him for the purpose. Kachi was undoubtedly, in\r\nspite of some small faults, a great character. He was a most intelligent,\r\nsharp, well-meaning fellow. His never failing good humour, and his\r\nearnest desire to learn and to be useful, were quite refreshing.\r\n\r\nMy luck seemed to have turned indeed. A few minutes later my bearer,\r\nquite unaware that any one would accompany me, entered the tent, and\r\nexclaimed in a disgusted manner:\r\n\r\n"_Shoka crab, sahib! Hunya log bura crab. Hazur hum, do admi jaldi Lhasa\r\ngiao_." ("The Shokas are bad. The Hunyas are very bad. Your honour and I,\r\nwe two alone, will go quickly by ourselves to Lhassa.")\r\n\r\nHere was another plucky and useful man anxious to come. He professed to\r\nhave no fear of death. He was the type of man I wanted. How true the poor\r\nfellow\'s protestations were I learned at a later date!\r\n\r\nChanden Sing was a man of strong sporting proclivities. His happiness was\r\ncomplete when he could fire his rifle at something, though he was never\r\nknown to hit the mark. He had been severely reprimanded and punished by\r\nme only a few days before for wasting several cartridges on _kiang_\r\n(wild horse) three miles distant. Ordinary work, however, such as doing\r\nhis own cooking, or keeping my things tidy, was distasteful to him, and\r\nwas invariably passed on to others.\r\n\r\nMansing the leper, being unfortunately of the same caste as Chanden Sing,\r\nbecame my servant\'s servant. The two Hindoos constantly quarrelled and\r\nfought, but at heart they were the best of friends. The bearer, by means\r\nof promises, mingled at intervals with blows, eventually succeeded in\r\ninducing his _protege_ to join in our new plan, and face with us the\r\nunknown dangers ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n     "Devil\'s Camp"--A fierce snowstorm--Abandoning our tents--Dangers\r\n     and perils in prospect--Collecting the men--One load too\r\n     many!--Another man wanted and found--A propitious night--Good-bye\r\n     to Wilson--The escape--Brigands.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY eight o\'clock in the evening I had collected all the men who had\r\npromised to follow me. They comprised my bearer, Kachi and six coolies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AT NIGHT I LED MY MEN UP THE MOUNTAIN IN A FIERCE\r\nSNOWSTORM"]\r\n\r\nWe named this camp "Devil\'s Camp," for diabolical indeed was the wind\r\nthat shook our tents, not to speak of the snow blown into our shelters by\r\nthe raging storm. During the night the wind grew in fury. Neither wood,\r\ndung, nor lichen for fuel was to be found. Our tents were pitched at\r\n16,900 feet above sea-level, and to ascend to the summit of the range\r\nwould mean a further climb of two thousand feet. In such weather the\r\ndifficulties of the ascent were increased tenfold, though for evading the\r\nvigilance of the Tibetan watchmen, who spied upon our movements, we could\r\nhave no better chance than a dirty night like this. I arranged with the\r\ndoctor that he was to take back to Garbyang all the baggage I had\r\ndiscarded and the men who had declined to follow me. He must display all\r\nour tents until late in the afternoon of the next day, so as to let the\r\nTibetans suppose that we were all under them, and give me time to make a\r\nlong forced march before they could get on our track. Hard as it would be\r\nfor us going forward, we would take no tent except the small _tente\r\nd\'abri_, weighing about four pounds. We should anyhow be unable to pitch\r\none for several days, for fear of being detected by the Tibetans, who\r\nwould be soon seen abroad in search of us. We should have to march long\r\ndistances at night, keeping mostly on the summit of the range, instead of\r\nproceeding, like other travellers, along the valleys, and we must get\r\nwhat little sleep we could during the day, when we could hide in some\r\nsecluded spot. The thought of seeing a fire had to be abandoned for an\r\nindefinite period, because, even in the remote contingency of our finding\r\nfuel at the great altitudes where we should have to camp, every one knows\r\nthat a fire and a column of smoke can be seen at a very great distance,\r\nboth by day and night. We pondered and discussed all these matters before\r\nwe made a start, and, moreover, we were fully aware that, if the Tibetans\r\ncould once lay their hands upon us, our numbers were too small to offer a\r\nstout resistance, and we might well give ourselves up for lost. In fact,\r\ntaking things all round, I rather doubted whether the lives of my few\r\nfollowers and my own were worth more than a song from the moment of our\r\nleaving "Devils\' Camp."\r\n\r\nWith this full knowledge of what we were undertaking, we may have been\r\nfoolish in starting at all, but lack of determination cannot in fairness\r\nbe credited as one of our faults.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful doctor had brought with him from our last camp a few\r\nlichens, with which he was now attempting to light a fire, to cook me\r\nsome _chapatis_ before leaving. Alas! four hours\' hard work, and an equal\r\nnumber of boxes of matches, failed to produce the semblance of a flame.\r\n\r\nAt midnight I sent Chanden Sing and Kachi to collect the men. Two came\r\ntrembling into the tent; the others could not be roused. I went myself\r\nand took them, one by one, to their loads. They were all crying like\r\nchildren. It was then that I discovered that in the haste and confusion I\r\nhad made one load too many. Here was a dilemma! Everything was ready and\r\npropitious for our flight, and a delay at this juncture was fatal. At any\r\ncost, I must have another man.\r\n\r\nThe moans and groans in the coolies\' tent, when I went in search of one,\r\nwere pitiful. You would have thought that they were all going to die\r\nwithin a few minutes, and that they were now in their last agonies, all\r\nbecause of the terror of being picked out to follow me.\r\n\r\nAt last, after endless trouble, threats and promises, Bijesing the Johari\r\nwas persuaded to come. But the load was too heavy for him; he would only\r\ncarry half. To save trouble, I agreed I would carry the other half myself\r\nin addition to my own load.\r\n\r\nWe put out our hurricane lantern, and at 2 A.M., when the gale was raging\r\nat its height, driving the grit and snow like spikes into our faces;\r\nwhen the wind and cold seemed to penetrate with biting force to the\r\nmarrow of our bones, when, as it seemed, all the gods were giving vent to\r\ntheir anger by putting every obstacle in our way, a handful of silent\r\nmen, half frozen and staggering, left the camp to face the blizzard. I\r\nordered my men to keep close together, and we made immediately for the\r\nmountain side, taking care to avoid the places where we supposed the\r\nTibetan spies were posted.\r\n\r\nWe could not have selected a more suitable night for our escape. It was\r\nso dark that we could only see a few inches in front of our noses. The\r\ndoctor, silent and with a swelling heart, accompanied me for a couple of\r\nhundred yards. I urged him to return to the tent. He stopped to grasp my\r\nhand, and in a broken voice the good man bade me farewell and God-speed.\r\n\r\n"The dangers of your journey," whispered Wilson, "are so great and so\r\nnumerous that God alone can guide you through. When I think of the cold,\r\nhunger and hardships you will have to endure, I can but tremble for you."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, doctor," said I, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," he repeated, "good----" and his voice failed him.\r\n\r\nTwo or three steps and the darkness separated us, but his touching words\r\nof farewell rang and echoed in my ears, as with sadness I remembered the\r\nloyalty and cheerful kindness of this good friend. The journey towards\r\nLhassa had recommenced in grim earnest. In a short while our ears,\r\nfingers, and toes were almost frozen, and the fast driving snow beat\r\nmercilessly against our faces, making our eyes ache. We proceeded like so\r\nmany blind people, speechless and exhausted, rising slowly higher on the\r\nmountain range, and feeling our way with our feet. As we reached greater\r\naltitudes it grew still colder, and the wind became more piercing. Every\r\nfew minutes we were compelled to halt and sit close together in order to\r\nkeep warm and get breath, as the air was so rarefied that we could barely\r\nproceed under our heavy loads.\r\n\r\nWe heard a whistle, and sounds like distant voices. My men collected\r\nround me, whispered, "_Dakus, dakus!_" ("Brigands, brigands!"), and then\r\nthrew themselves flat on the snow. I loaded my rifle and went ahead, but\r\nit was vain to hope to pierce the obscurity. I listened. Yet another\r\nshrill whistle!\r\n\r\nMy Shokas were terrified. The sound seemed to come from straight in front\r\nof us. We slightly altered our course, winning our way upward slowly and\r\nsteadily, until we found at sunrise we were near the mountain top. It was\r\nstill snowing hard. One final effort brought us to the plateau on the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nHere we felt comparatively safe. Thoroughly exhausted, we deposited our\r\nburdens on the snow, and laid ourselves down in a row close to one\r\nanother to keep ourselves warm, piling on the top of us all the blankets\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n     S.E. wind--Hungry and half frozen--Lakes at 18,960 feet above\r\n     sea-level--Cold food at high altitudes--Buried in snow--Mansing\'s\r\n     sufferings--Fuel at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT 1 P.M. we woke up, drenched to the skin, the sun having thawed the\r\nthick coating of snow over us. This camp was at 18,000 feet. The wind\r\nfrom the S.E. cut like a knife, and we suffered from it, not only on this\r\noccasion, but every day during the whole time we were in Tibet. It begins\r\nto blow with great fierceness and regularity at one o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and it is only at about eight in the evening that it sometimes\r\nabates and gradually ceases. Frequently, however, the wind, instead of\r\ndropping at this time, increases in violence, blowing with terrible\r\nvehemence during the whole night. As we were making ready to start again,\r\nwith limbs cramped and stiff, the sky once more became suddenly covered\r\nwith heavy grey clouds, and fresh snow fell. There was no possibility of\r\nmaking a fire, so we started hungry and half-frozen, following a course\r\nof 70 deg. (b.m.). We waded up to our waists through a freezingly cold\r\nstream, and climbing steadily higher and higher for six miles, we at last\r\nreached another and loftier plateau to the N.E. of the one where we had\r\ncamped in the morning. The altitude was 18,960 feet, and we were\r\nsurprised to find four lakes of considerable size close to one another on\r\nthis high tableland. The sun, breaking for a moment through the clouds,\r\nshone on the snow-covered tops of the surrounding mountains, silvering\r\nthe water of the lakes, and making a beautiful and spectacular picture,\r\nwild and fascinating in effect.\r\n\r\nHunger and exhaustion prevented full appreciation of the scene; nothing\r\ncould stand in the way of quickly finding a suitable place to rest our\r\nweak and jaded bodies, under the shelter of the higher hills round the\r\nplateau, or in some depression in the ground. I was anxious to push\r\nacross the plateau, and descend on the N.E. side to some lower altitude\r\nwhere we should more probably find fuel, but my men, half-starved and\r\nfagged, could go no farther. Their wet loads were considerably heavier\r\nthan usual, they panted terribly owing to the great altitude, and no\r\nsooner had we come to a partially sheltered spot between the larger lake\r\nand its most eastern neighbouring sheet of water, than they all collapsed\r\nand were unable to proceed. I was much concerned about them, as they\r\nrefused to take any cold food, saying it would cause their death. I was\r\nreally at a loss to see how they could recover sufficient strength for\r\nthe next day\'s marching. Eventually, by personally pledging them that\r\nthey would not die, I persuaded them to eat a little _sato_ and _ghur_.\r\nUnfortunately, no sooner had they eaten some of it mixed with cold water,\r\nthan nearly all were seized with violent pains in their stomachs, from\r\nwhich they suffered for the greater part of the night.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that experience had taught them that eating cold food\r\nat great altitudes is more dangerous than eating no food at all, and I\r\nregretted my ill-timed, if kindly meant advice. One is apt to judge other\r\npeople by oneself, and personally I never felt any difference, whether my\r\nfood was cold or hot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURIED IN SNOW]\r\n\r\nSoon after sunset the cold was intense. It was still snowing hard, and\r\nour wet garments and blankets were now freezing. I lighted a small spirit\r\nlamp, round which we all sat close together, and covered over with our\r\nfrozen wraps. I even attempted to cook on the flame some concentrated\r\nbroth, but, owing to the high altitude, the water was a long time losing\r\nits chill, apart from boiling, and when it was just getting tepid the\r\nflame went out, and I could afford no more spirits of wine to light it\r\nagain: so the cooking had to be abandoned, and as the night grew colder\r\nand colder, we huddled together under our respective blankets in a vain\r\nattempt to sleep. We had made a protecting wall with our baggage, and my\r\nmen covered their heads and everything with their blankets; but I never\r\ncould adopt their style of sleeping, as it seemed to suffocate me. I\r\nalways slept with my head uncovered, for not only was it more\r\ncomfortable, but I wished to be on the alert should we at any time be\r\nsurprised by Tibetans. My men moaned, groaned, and chattered their teeth\r\nconvulsively during the night. I woke many times with a bad pain in my\r\nears from frostbite; my eyes, too, suffered as the eyelashes became\r\ncovered with icicles. Every time I tried to open them there was an\r\nuncomfortable feeling as if the eyelashes were being torn off, for the\r\nslit of the eye became fast frozen directly the lids were closed.\r\n\r\nAt last the morning came! The night had seemed endless. When I tried to\r\nraise the blanket in order to sit up, it seemed of an extraordinary\r\nweight and stiffness. No wonder! It was frozen hard, and as rigid as\r\ncardboard, covered over with a foot of snow. The thermometer during the\r\nnight had gone down to 24 deg.. I called my men. They were hard to wake, and\r\nthey, too, were buried in snow.\r\n\r\n"_Uta, uta, uta!_" ("Get up, get up, get up!") I called, shaking one by\r\none, and brushing off as much snow as I could.\r\n\r\n"_Baroff bahut!_" ("There is much snow!") remarked one as he put his nose\r\noutside his blanket, and rubbed his eyes, smarting from the white glare\r\naround us. "Salaam, sahib," added he, as, having overcome his first\r\nsurprise, he perceived me, and he waved his hand gracefully up to his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe others behaved in a similar manner. Kachi was, as usual, the last one\r\nto wake.\r\n\r\n"O, Kachi," I shouted, "get up!"\r\n\r\n"_O, bahiyoh!_" ("O, father!") yawned he, stretching his arms. Half\r\nasleep, half awake, he looked round as if in a trance, muttering\r\nincoherent words.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, sir. Oh, much snow. Oh look, sir, two kiangs there! What\r\nis \'kiang\' in English?"\r\n\r\n"Wild horse."\r\n\r\n"\'Wild\' you spell w-i-l-d?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHere the note-book was produced from under his pillow, and the word\r\nregistered in it.\r\n\r\nOdd creatures these Shokas! The average European, half-starved and\r\nfrozen, would hardly give much thought to exact spelling.\r\n\r\nPoor Mansing the leper suffered terribly. He groaned through the whole\r\nnight. I had given him one of my wrappers, but his circulation seemed\r\nsuspended. His face was grey and cadaverous, with deep lines drawn by\r\nsuffering, and his feet were so frozen that for some time he could not\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nAgain the Shokas would eat nothing, for snow was still falling. We\r\nstarted towards the N.E. After a mile of flat we began a steep descent\r\nover unpleasant loose _debris_ and sharp rocks. The progress was rapid,\r\nbut very painful. Scouring the country below with my telescope, I\r\nperceived shrubs and lichens far down in the valley to the N.E. and also\r\na tent and some sheep. This was unfortunate, for we had to alter our\r\ncourse in order not to be seen. We again climbed up to the top of the\r\nplateau and rounded unperceived the mountain summit, striking a more\r\nEasterly route. Towards sunset we began our descent from the latter\r\npoint, and we crossed the river with no great difficulty. Having selected\r\na nicely sheltered depression in the ground, we pitched my little _tente\r\nd\'abri_ there, by the side of a pond of melted snow. With natural\r\neagerness, we all set out collecting lichens and shrubs for our fires,\r\nand each man carried into camp several loads of the drier fuel. In a\r\nmoment there were three big fires blazing, and not only were we able to\r\ncook a specially abundant dinner and drown our past troubles in a\r\nbucketful of boiling tea, but we also managed to dry our clothes and\r\nblankets. The relief of this warmth was wonderful, and in our comparative\r\nhappiness we forgot the hardships and sufferings we had so far\r\nencountered. With the exception of a handful of _sato_, this was the\r\nfirst solid meal we had had for forty-eight hours. In those two days we\r\nhad travelled twenty miles, each of us carrying a weight averaging\r\nconsiderably over sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nWe were at 16,500 feet, which seemed quite a low elevation after our\r\ncolder and loftier camping-grounds. The reaction was quite pleasant, and\r\nfor myself I contemplated our future plans and possibilities with better\r\nhope. The outlook had changed from our deepest depression to a condition\r\nof comparative cheerfulness and content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n     Dacoits--No nonsense allowed--A much-frequented region--A\r\n     plateau--The Gyanema-Taklakot track--A dangerous spot--Soldiers\r\n     waiting for us--Burying our baggage--Out of provisions--A fall\r\n     into the Gakkon River--A bright idea--Nettles our only diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN front of us, to the N.E., was a high mountain, then farther towards\r\nthe East, a narrow valley between two hill ranges, while at 238 deg. (b.m.) a\r\nriver passed through a picturesque gorge in the direction of the Mangshan\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for me to proceed along the valley to the east, as we\r\nshould thus save ourselves much trouble, time and exertion, though there\r\nwould be some risk of our meeting Tibetans, especially bands of dacoits,\r\nwith whom this part of Nari Khorsum[18] is infested. We had, therefore,\r\nto proceed cautiously, especially as my Shokas seemed no less timid and\r\nafraid of these folks. We had hardly gone half a mile over the undulating\r\ncountry, and I had stopped behind my men to take some observations with\r\nmy prismatic compass, when my carriers suddenly threw themselves flat on\r\nthe ground and began to retreat, crawling on hands and knees.\r\n\r\n"_Dakus, Dakus!_" ("Brigands, brigands!") they whispered, as I got near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. We had been seen, and a number of dacoits, armed with\r\nmatchlocks and swords, came rapidly towards us. It has always been my\r\nexperience that, in such cases, the worst thing to do is to run away, for\r\nnothing encourages a man more than to see that his opponent is afraid of\r\nhim. I therefore loaded my Mannlicher, and my bearer did likewise with\r\nthe Martini-Henry. I gave orders to the Shokas to squat down by their\r\nrespective loads and not stir an inch. We two strolled towards the fast\r\napproaching band, now less than a hundred yards distant. I shouted to\r\nthem to stop, and Chanden Sing signalled that they must go back; but they\r\ntook no notice of our warnings, and came on all the faster towards us.\r\nUndoubtedly they thought that we were only Shoka traders, and looked,\r\nfrom experience, to find an easy prey. Making ready to rush us as soon as\r\nthey got near enough, they separated with the obvious intention of taking\r\nus on all sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP CARRYING LOAD]\r\n\r\n"_Dushu! Dushu!_" ("Go back!") I cried angrily at them, raising my rifle\r\nto my shoulder and taking a steady aim at the leader. Chanden Sing\r\nfollowed suit with one of the others, and this seemed to have a salutary\r\neffect on them, for they immediately made a comical salaam and took to\r\ntheir heels, Chanden Sing and I pursuing them for some distance so as to\r\nget them well out of our way. Having occupied a prominent position on a\r\nsmall mound, we discovered that a short way off they had a number of\r\nmates and some three thousand sheep, presumably their last loot. We\r\nsignalled that they must get away from our course, and eventually,\r\ndriving their booty before them, they scurried off in the direction I\r\nindicated. When they were well clear of us, and my Shokas, who thought\r\ntheir last hour had come, had partly recovered from their fright, we\r\nproceeded on our journey, entering the narrow valley between the two hill\r\nranges. That we were now in a much-frequented region could be plainly\r\nseen from the numerous encamping-grounds alongside the stream. But our\r\nsuccess of the morning had raised our spirits, and we stepped out\r\ncheerily, keeping to the left bank. A steepish climb brought us to a\r\nplateau at an altitude of 16,400 feet, from which we obtained a fine view\r\nof the snow range running from East to West from the Mangshan Mountain to\r\nthe Lippu Pass, and beyond to the N.E. the four lofty peaks of Nimo\r\nNangil, 25,360 feet, 22,200 feet, 22,850 feet, 22,670 feet. The highest\r\npeaks were at 84 deg., 92 deg., 117 deg. (b.m.). This plateau sloped gently, and was\r\nbroken by many deep crevasses, conveying the water-flow down into the\r\nGakkon River.\r\n\r\nOn the lower portion of this plateau, and then along the course of the\r\nriver, a track ran from Gyanema to Taklakot _via_ Kardam and Dogmar, and\r\nanother seldom-frequented track to Mangshan, S.S.W. of this place. The\r\nedge of the plateau was 15,800 feet above sea-level, and the river 550\r\nfeet lower.\r\n\r\nThis was for us a very dangerous spot, since, no doubt, by this time the\r\nTibetans must be aware that I had escaped and was well on my way into\r\ntheir country. I knew that soldiers and spies must be guarding all the\r\ntracks and searching for us. This thoroughfare, being more frequented\r\nthan the others, was all the more insecure, and we had to display great\r\ncaution in order to avoid detection. In Tibet, I may here note, the\r\natmosphere is so clear that moving objects can be plainly seen at\r\nexceptionally long distances. I scoured the country with my telescope,\r\nbut I could see no one, so we went on. However, my men considered it\r\nsafer to descend into one of the numerous creeks, where we should be less\r\nexposed, but we had hardly reached the border of it when we heard noises\r\nrising from the valley below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DACOITS WITH A BOOTY OF SHEEP]\r\n\r\nCrawling on our stomachs, my bearer and I peeped over the edge of the\r\nplateau. Some five hundred feet below was a Tibetan encampment, with a\r\nnumber of yaks and ponies grazing. Unnoticed, I watched them for some\r\ntime. There were several soldiers, most probably posted there on the\r\nlook-out for me. With my glass I recognised some of the Gyanema men. We\r\ndeemed it advisable to find a spot where we could hide until night came.\r\nThen, making a detour, we descended to the river, 15,250 feet, scrambled\r\nacross in the dark, and made our way up a narrow gorge between high\r\ncliffs until we came to a well-hidden spot, where I called a halt.\r\nFollowed by my men, I climbed up from rock to rock on the cliff to our\r\nleft, and found a small natural platform, sheltered by a huge boulder\r\nprojecting over it. This seemed a safe enough spot for us to stop. We\r\ndared not put up a tent, and we took the precaution of burying all our\r\nbaggage in case of a surprise during the night. Unhampered, we should at\r\nany moment be able to hide ourselves away from our pursuers or run before\r\nthem, and we could always come back afterwards for our things if an\r\nopportunity offered itself.\r\n\r\nAnd now, just as everything seemed to be running smoothly, I made a\r\nterrible discovery. At this stage of the journey, when it was important\r\nfor me to move very rapidly, I found that we were out of provisions. This\r\nwas indeed an unpleasant surprise, for before leaving the larger body of\r\nmy expedition I had given orders to my men to take food for ten days. The\r\ndoctor, who had been deputed to see to this, had assured me that the\r\nloads contained quite enough to last us over that length of time, and now\r\nfor some unaccountable reason we had only sufficient food for one meagre\r\nmeal. Moreover, I discovered that we had only a few grains of salt left.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with it?" I inquired angrily, as it immediately\r\nflashed across my mind that there had been foul play among my carriers. I\r\nhad ordered each man to take half seer (1 lb.) of salt.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sahib, but we forgot to take it," said the men in a chorus.\r\n\r\nAfter the terrible hardships and fatigue we had gone through, and the\r\nanxiety and difficulty of carrying on my surveying, photography,\r\nsketching, writing, collecting, &c., under conditions of unusual\r\ndiscomfort and risk, it was, indeed, a hard blow to me to see all my\r\nplans thus unexpectedly frustrated, for we were still three or four days\'\r\njourney from Mansarowar, where I relied on getting fresh supplies. Having\r\ncome thus far, should I be compelled now to go back or give in, and be\r\ncaptured by the Tibetan soldiers whom I had so successfully evaded?\r\nThough not usually much affected by physical pain, I unfortunately suffer\r\ngreatly under any mental stress. I felt quite ill and depressed, and, to\r\nadd bodily discomfort to my moral sufferings, came the fact that I had\r\nslipped, while jumping in semi-darkness from stone to stone across the\r\nGakkon River, and had fallen flat into about four feet of water. The wind\r\nwas very high at the time, and the thermometer down to 26 deg., so that,\r\nsitting in my wet clothes to discuss our present situation with my men, I\r\nsuddenly became so cold, shivery and exhausted, that I thought I was\r\nabout to collapse altogether. My usual good spirits, which had done much\r\ntowards carrying me so far, seemed extinguished; my strength failed me\r\nentirely, and a high fever set in, increasing in violence so fast that,\r\nnotwithstanding my desperate struggle not to give in, I became almost\r\ndelirious. With my teeth chattering and my temperature at its highest, I\r\nsaw all my troubles assume an exaggerated form, and failure seemed\r\ninevitable. The more I ransacked my brain the more hopeless seemed our\r\nposition, until, when I was almost in despair, an expedient suddenly\r\nflashed across my mind; an idea more adapted for romance perhaps than\r\nreal life, yet not, I hoped, impossible to be carried into execution.\r\nFour of my men should go disguised, two as traders and two as beggars,\r\ninto the Takla[19] fort, and purchase food from my enemies. We remaining\r\nin camp would, in the meantime, keep well hidden until they returned. I\r\nspoke to my followers, and after some easily conceivable reluctance, four\r\nShokas undertook to perform, the daring duty. Discovery would mean to\r\nthem the loss of their heads, probably preceded by cruel tortures of all\r\nkinds; so, though they eventually betrayed me, I cannot help giving them\r\ncredit for the pluck and fidelity they displayed in the present\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nDuring the night my men were extremely good to me. We did not sleep for\r\nfear of being surprised by the Tibetan soldiers, and we passed hour after\r\nhour listening to Shoka stories of brigands and Tibetan tortures,\r\nterrible enough not only to keep us awake, but to make every hair on our\r\nheads stand on end. Early in the morning, when it grew light, we gathered\r\na quantity of nettles, which were to be found in profusion at this camp,\r\nand having boiled them in different fashions, we made of them a hearty if\r\nnot an appetising meal. They did not seem very unpalatable at the time,\r\nonly it was unfortunate that we had no more salt, for that would have\r\nadded to the digestibility of our prickly diet. We supplied the\r\ndeficiency by mixing with them a double quantity of pepper, and it was a\r\nrelief to know that, while nettles existed near our camp, we should at\r\nleast not die of starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] Nari Khorsum--name of that province.\r\n\r\n[19] Takla-khar or Taklak t = _Takla_ fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n     All that remained of my men\'s provisions--The plan to enter the\r\n     fort--Appearance of yaks--A band of brigands--Erecting\r\n     fortifications--Changes in the temperature--Soldiers in search of\r\n     us!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE food supply for my men was now reduced in all to four pounds of\r\nflour, two pounds of rice, and two pounds of _sato_. This we gave to the\r\nfour men who were to attempt to enter Taklakot, for their road would be\r\nlong and fatiguing. For us, there were plenty of nettles to fall back\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEHIND OUR BULWARKS]\r\n\r\nI carefully instructed the four Shokas how to enter the Tibetan fort one\r\nby one in their disguises, and purchase, in small quantities at a time,\r\nthe provisions we required. When a sufficient amount was obtained to make\r\na load, a man should immediately start towards our camp, and the others\r\nwere to follow separately for a few marches, when at a given spot, they\r\nwould all four meet again and return to us. It was exciting work to\r\nprepare the different disguises and arrange for everything, and at last,\r\nafter repeated good-byes and words of encouragement, the four messengers\r\nleft on their perilous errand. All seemed very quiet round us, so quiet\r\nthat I unburied my sextant and artificial horizon, and was taking\r\nobservations for longitude as well as for latitude (by double altitudes,\r\nas the angle was too great to be measured at noon), when, to our dismay,\r\na herd consisting of over a hundred yaks appeared on the pass, North of\r\nour camp, and slowly advanced towards us. Were we discovered? Were the\r\nTarjum\'s men coming, preceded by their animals? No time was to be lost;\r\ninstruments and blankets were quickly cleared away and hidden, and then,\r\ncrawling up towards the animals, who had stopped on perceiving us, we\r\nthrew stones at them in order to drive them down the next creek. As\r\nluck would have it, we were just in time to do this, for from our\r\nhiding-place on the summit of the pass we could see, on the other side, a\r\nnumber of Tibetans following the yaks we had driven away. They passed\r\nonly a couple of hundred yards below us, evidently quite unconscious of\r\nour presence. They were singing, and apparently looking for somebody\'s\r\ntracks, for they often stooped to examine the ground. Later in the\r\nafternoon I went to reconnoitre down the Gyanema road, and in the hope of\r\nwatching, unseen, the Tibetans who passed on their way to and from\r\nTaklakot. I saw no soldiers, but a strong band of Jogpas (brigands),\r\ndriving before them thousands of sheep and yaks, was an interesting\r\nsight. They all rode ponies, and seemed to obey their leader very\r\nsmartly, when in a hoarse voice, and never ceasing to turn his\r\nprayer-wheel, he muttered orders. They went briskly along in fine style,\r\nwomen as well as men riding their ponies astride. The men had matchlocks\r\nand swords, and each pony carried, besides its rider, bags of food slung\r\nbehind the saddle. I watched the long procession from behind some rocks,\r\nand felt somewhat relieved when the last horsemen, who passed only some\r\ntwenty yards from me, rode away with the rest of the caravan. I retraced\r\nmy steps, and judging that this camp was not quite so safe as I had at\r\nfirst supposed, I proceeded, with the aid of my men, to erect a rough\r\nentrenchment and wall round our platform, along the rock under which we\r\nlived. These bulwarks answered the double purpose of sheltering us from\r\nthe sight of the Tibetans and of acting as fortifications in case of a\r\nnight attack. All our things were buried a little way above our camp.\r\n\r\nAnother long dreary day had elapsed. We had used our last grain of salt;\r\nand yet another day on nettles alone; and a third day and a fourth, on\r\nthe same diet! How sick we got of nettles! The days seemed endless as,\r\nlying flat on a peak above our camp, I remained hour after hour scanning\r\nwith my telescope the long plateau above the Gakkon River in search of\r\nour returning messengers. Every time I perceived men in the distance my\r\nheart leaped, but on focussing them with my glass they turned out to be\r\nJogpas (bandits), or Dogpas (nomad tribes of smugglers), or travelling\r\nHumlis or Jumlis, on their way to Gyanema and Gartok. And how many times\r\ndid we not listen and then anxiously peep through the fissures in our\r\nfortifications when some unusual noise struck our ears! As time went on,\r\nand they did not put in an appearance, we began to entertain doubts as\r\nto their safety, or would they betray us and never return? Or, as was\r\nmore likely, had they been caught by the Jong Pen (the master of the\r\nfort), and been imprisoned and tortured?\r\n\r\nMy bearer, who was somewhat of a _bon vivant_, declined to eat any more\r\nfood, as he said it was better not to eat at all than to eat the same\r\nthing constantly. He swore he could fast for ten days, and he made up for\r\nwant of food by sleeping.\r\n\r\nMy fortified abode was comfortable enough during the morning, when the\r\nsun shone on it, though often it got so warm that we had to abandon it in\r\nthe middle of the day, when the thermometer registered as much as 120 deg.,\r\n122 deg., and even 124 deg.. From 1 P.M. till 10 at night a bitter wind blew from\r\nthe S.E., and seemed to get right into our bones; so cold was it that the\r\ntemperature suddenly dropped down to 60 deg., and even lower, the moment the\r\nsun disappeared behind the mountains, and continued to fall as low as\r\n40 deg., 34 deg. and 32 deg.; the minimum during the night. One night we had a\r\nterrible gale and a snowstorm. Such was the force of the wind, that our\r\nwall was blown down upon us as we slept in its shelter, and the hours we\r\nhad dedicated to rest had to be spent in repairing the damage done. On\r\nthe following morning we were gathering nettles for our meal, when we\r\nheard the distant tinkling of fast approaching horse-bells. We quickly\r\nput out the fires, hid our things, and hastened behind our entrenchment.\r\nI seized my rifle; Chanden Sing loaded the Martini. A Shoka, who was too\r\nfar off to reach our fortified abode in time, screened himself behind\r\nsome rocks. In the nick of time! Half-a-dozen sepoys with matchlocks, to\r\nwhich were attached red flags, slung over their shoulders, were cantering\r\ngaily up the hillside only a few yards in front of us. They were\r\nundoubtedly searching for me, judging by the way they looked in every\r\ndirection, but fortunately they never turned towards the castle walls\r\nthat concealed us. They were expecting, I presumed, to see a large\r\nEuropean tent in one of the valleys, and never even dreamt that we should\r\nbe where we were. We covered them well with our rifles, but we had no\r\noccasion to fire. They rode on, and the sound of their horse-bells grew\r\nfainter and fainter as they disappeared behind the pass. To be sure these\r\nhorsemen could only be soldiers despatched by the Tarjum to guard this\r\ntrack. They were now probably on their way back to him, satisfied that\r\nthe sahib was not to be found in that part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n     "Terror Camp"--Two more messengers leave camp--A tribe of\r\n     Dogpas--A strange sahib--Our messengers return from Taklakot--The\r\n     account and adventures of their mission--In great distress--Two\r\n     fakirs who suffered through me--Five hundred rupees offered for\r\n     my head--The Shokas want to abandon me--A plot--How it failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE named this spot "Terror Camp," for many and horrible were the\r\nexperiences that befell us here. Another weary day dragged slowly to its\r\nclose, and there was still no sign of the messengers\' return. Two men\r\nvolunteered to go into Kardam, a settlement some miles off, and try to\r\nobtain food from the Tibetans. One of them had a friend at this place,\r\nand he thought he could get from him sufficient provisions to enable us\r\nto go on a few days longer.\r\n\r\nThey started, disguised as pilgrims, a disguise not difficult to assume,\r\nfor their clothes were falling to pieces owing to the rough marching we\r\nhad done of late. They were away the whole day, and only returned late at\r\nnight, having an amusing tale to tell. Meeting a tribe of Dogpas, they\r\nhad boldly entered their camp, asking to purchase food. Unfortunately the\r\nDogpas had not sufficient for themselves, and could not spare any.\r\nIncidentally my men were informed that _Lando Plenki_--the name the\r\nTibetans had given me--had taken a large army of men into Tibet, and that\r\ngreat excitement prevailed at Taklakot as well as at other places, owing\r\nto the fact that the sahib had the extraordinary power of making himself\r\ninvisible when the Tibetan soldiers were in his vicinity. He had been\r\nreported as having been seen in many places in Tibet: soldiers had been\r\ndespatched in all directions to capture him. His tracks had several times\r\nbeen discovered and followed, and yet he could never be found.\r\nMessengers had been hastily sent out from Taklakot to Lhassa (sixteen\r\ndays\' journey), and to Gartok, a great bazaar in West Tibet, asking for\r\nsoldiers to assist in the capture of this strange invader, who was also\r\nsaid to have the power of walking on the water when crossing the rivers,\r\nand of flying over mountains when he chose. When I recalled our struggles\r\nand sufferings in climbing over the mountains, and in crossing the\r\nstreams on our journey, this account of myself given by the Tibetans, and\r\nnow repeated to me, struck me as almost cruelly ironical. Anyhow, I was\r\npleased that the Tibetans credited me with such supernatural powers, for\r\nit could hardly fail to be an advantage in keeping them from getting to\r\ntoo close quarters with us.\r\n\r\nThree more days had to be spent in a state of painful uncertainty and\r\nanxiety regarding the fate of our messengers to Taklakot. On the night of\r\nthe 3rd we had retired to our fortress in despair, fearing that they had\r\nbeen captured and probably beheaded. It was 10 P.M., and we were worn out\r\nand ready to turn in; our fire down below at the bottom of the creek was\r\nslowly dying out, and nature around us was still and silent, when I\r\nsuddenly heard sounds of approaching steps. We listened, peeping through\r\nthe fissures in our wall. Were these Tibetans trying to surprise us in\r\nour sleep, or could they be our men returning at last?\r\n\r\nWe closely watched the gorge from which the sounds came, faint sounds of\r\nvoices and of footsteps. Silent as we were, there were not wanting signs\r\nof the nervous excitement of my men. At last four staggering figures\r\ncrawled cautiously into camp, and we could not even then discern in the\r\ndim light whether these were our messengers or not.\r\n\r\n"_Kuan hai?_" ("Who is there?") I shouted.\r\n\r\n"Dola!" replied a voice, and instantly we gave them a joyful and hearty\r\ngreeting. But our happiness was not to last long. The men did not\r\nrespond. They seemed quite exhausted, and apparently terrified. I asked\r\nthem to explain the cause of their distress, but, sobbing and embracing\r\nmy feet, they showed great disinclination to tell me. Grave, indeed, was\r\nthe news they brought, presaging much trouble in store.\r\n\r\n"Your days are numbered, sahib," at last cried Dola. "It is impossible\r\nfor you to get out of this country alive ... they will kill you, and the\r\nJong Pen of Taklakot says that he must have your head at all costs."\r\n\r\n"Do not look so far ahead, Dola," I replied, trying to calm him, "but\r\ntell me first how you reached Taklakot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sahib, we followed your plan. We suffered much on the road, as the\r\nmarches were long and severe, and we had very little food. We walked day\r\nand night for two days, keeping away from the track, and hiding whenever\r\nwe saw any one. When we got near the Tibetan fort, we saw at the foot of\r\nthe hill a few tents of the Tinker and Chongur Shokas from Nepal. None of\r\nthe Biassi or Chaudassi Shokas had been allowed to enter Tibet owing to\r\nthe Jong Pen\'s anger with them regarding his claims for land revenue.\r\nThere was a guard day and night at the river, and a sharp look-out was\r\nkept to stop and arrest anybody entering the country. Two fakirs, who\r\nwere on a pilgrimage to the sacred Mansarowar, unaware of the danger, had\r\ncrossed over the Lippu Pass, and had proceeded down to Taklakot, where\r\nthey were immediately seized and accused of being you, sahib, in\r\ndisguise. As the Tibetans were not quite certain as to which of the two\r\nwas the real sahib, they severely punished both, beating them almost to\r\ndeath. What became of them afterwards we were unable to learn. Anyhow,\r\nthe Tibetans subsequently found out that you had entered Tibet by another\r\npass, and soldiers have been sent in every direction to look for you.\r\n\r\n"No sooner did we appear at Taklakot," sobbed Dola, "than we were pounced\r\nupon, knocked about, and arrested. They cross-examined us closely. We\r\nprofessed to be Johari traders, who had run short of food, and had made\r\nfor Taklakot to buy provisions. They beat us and treated us badly, until\r\nyour friend Zeniram, the head village man of Chongur (in Nepal), came to\r\nour rescue and gave thirty rupees surety for us. We were then allowed to\r\nremain in his tent, guarded by Tibetan soldiers. We secretly purchased\r\nfrom him and packed the provisions, and at night Zeniram succeeded in\r\ndecoying the soldiers that were guarding us into his tent, and gave them\r\n_choekti_ to drink until they became intoxicated. One by one we four\r\nsucceeded in escaping with our loads. For three nights we marched\r\nsteadily back, concealing ourselves during the day for the sake of\r\nsafety. Now we have returned to you, sahib."\r\n\r\nDola paused for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n"Sahib," he continued, "we were told in Taklakot that over a thousand\r\nsoldiers are searching for you everywhere, and more are expected from\r\nLhassa and Sigatz,[20] whither the Jong Pen has hastily sent messengers.\r\nThey fear you, sahib, but they have orders from Lhassa to capture you at\r\nall costs. They say that you can make yourself invisible when you like,\r\nand exorcisms are made and prayers offered daily, so that in future you\r\nmay be seen and arrested. Once caught, they will have no pity on you, and\r\nyou will be beheaded, for the Jong Pen is angry with you owing to the\r\ndefiant messages you sent him from Garbyang. He has given orders to the\r\nsoldiers to bring you back dead or alive, and whoever brings your head\r\nwill receive a reward of 500 rupees."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea that my head was so valuable," I could not help\r\nexclaiming. "I shall take great care of it in the future."\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact 500 rupees in Tibet represents a fortune, and the man\r\npossessing it is a very rich man.\r\n\r\nBut my men were not in a laughing mood and they looked upon the whole\r\naffair as very serious.\r\n\r\nI gave a handsome backshish to the four men who had brought the\r\nprovisions, but that did not prevent all the Shokas declaring that the\r\ndanger was so great that they must leave me there and then. Appeals are\r\nuseless on such occasions, and so I simply stated that I should shoot any\r\nman attempting to leave camp. Having now provisions for ten days, I\r\ninformed them that we must at once push on.\r\n\r\nSulky and grumbling they left our fortified corner and went below to the\r\ncreek. They said they preferred sleeping down there. I suspected them,\r\nhowever, and I sat up watching them and listening instead of sleeping. My\r\nbearer rolled himself up in his blanket and, as usual, was soon asleep.\r\nThe Shokas lighted a fire, sat round it, and with their heads close\r\ntogether, held an excited council in semi-whispers. In the heated\r\ndiscussion some spoke louder than they imagined, and the night being\r\nparticularly still and the place well adapted for carrying sound, I\r\noverheard words which put me on the alert, for I soon convinced myself\r\nthat they were arranging to sell my head ... yes ... and to divide the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe men got closer together, and spoke so faintly, that I could hear no\r\nmore. Then they each in turn placed one hand above the other along a\r\nstick, until the end of it was reached; each man then passed it to his\r\nneighbour, who went through the same form; a complicated manner of\r\ndrawing lots, common among the Shokas. Eventually the man selected by\r\nfate drew from a load a large Gourkha _kukri_, and removed its scabbard.\r\nA strange, almost fantastic impression remains on my mind of the moment\r\nwhen the men, with their faces lighted by the small flame of the\r\nflickering fire, all looked up towards my eyrie. The culminating point of\r\ntheir treachery had come, and their countenances seemed ghastly and\r\ndistorted, as seen from the fissure in the wall behind which I knelt.\r\nThey listened to hear if we were asleep. Then all but one rolled\r\nthemselves in their blankets, completely covering their heads and bodies.\r\nThe one figure I could now see sat up by the fire for some time, as if\r\nabsorbed in thought. Every now and then he turned his head up towards my\r\nfortress, and listened. At last he got up, and with his feet smothered\r\nthe fire. It was a lovely night, and as soon as the reddish flame was put\r\nout the stars shone again like diamonds in the small patch of deep blue\r\nsky visible above my head.\r\n\r\nI rested the barrel of my rifle on the wall, my eyes being fixed on the\r\nblack figure down below. I watched as, stooping low, it crawled step by\r\nstep the few yards up to my abode, pausing to listen each time that a\r\nrolling stone caused a noise. It was now only two or three yards away,\r\nand seemed to hesitate. Drawing back, and ready to spring up, I kept my\r\neyes fixed on the top of the wall. I waited some time, but the man was in\r\nno hurry, and I grew impatient.\r\n\r\nI slowly got up, rifle in hand, and as I raised my head above the wall I\r\nfound myself face to face with the man on the other side. I lost no time\r\nin placing the muzzle of my Mannlicher close to his face, and the\r\nperplexed Shoka, dropping his _kukri_, went down on his knees to implore\r\nmy pardon. After giving him a good pounding with the butt of my rifle, I\r\nsent him about his business. The man lacked the qualities of a murderer,\r\nbut I felt I had better see that no other disturbance took place during\r\nthe night. It is true that two men attempted to crawl out of camp and\r\ndesert, but I discovered this and stopped them in time. At last the sun\r\nrose, and the night ended with all its troubles and anxieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] Sigatz, usually called "Shigatze" by English people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n     A Tibetan guard\'s encampment--Nattoo volunteers to be a\r\n     guide--Treachery and punishment of the Shokas--All ways forward\r\n     barred to me--Evading the soldiers by another perilous march at\r\n     night--Mansing again lost--A marvellous phenomenon--Sufferings of\r\n     my men--Severe cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nON my last scouting journey up the hill above the camp, I had espied, by\r\nthe aid of my telescope, the encampment of a guard of Tibetans, about\r\nthree miles north of us, and I informed my followers of this fact.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when we again dug up the main part of our baggage and\r\nmade ready to start, one of the men, the Kutial Nattoo, came forward and\r\nprofessed to be able to guide us directly to the Mansarowar Lake. He\r\nseemed very anxious to undertake this task, saying that there would be no\r\nchance of detection by the route he knew, and consequently we might march\r\nduring the daytime.\r\n\r\nWe started up the creek, led by this man, and I was astonished at the\r\nwillingness with which the Shokas agreed to proceed. In a little time I\r\nfelt convinced that he was deliberately taking us to the spot I most\r\nwished to avoid. On my remonstrating and stopping further progress in\r\nthat direction, the Shokas mutinied and, depositing their loads, tried to\r\nescape, but my bearer quickly barred their way ahead in the narrow creek\r\nand I prevented their escape from the opposite side, so they had to\r\nsurrender. Painful as it was to me, I had to severely punish them all,\r\nand while I took care that no one should bolt, Chanden Sing took special\r\npleasure in knocking them about until they were brought back to their\r\nsenses. On being closely cross-examined, they openly confessed that they\r\nhad made a plot to hand me over to the Tibetan guard, in order to escape\r\nthe horrors of torture by the Tibetans. This last act of treachery,\r\ncoming after what had happened during the night, and from the very men\r\nwhom I had just been more than lenient towards, was too much for me, and\r\nI used a stick, which Chanden Sing handed me, very freely on their backs\r\nand legs, Nattoo the Kutial receiving the largest share of blows, because\r\nhe was undoubtedly the head of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nOn climbing to a point of vantage, I now further discovered that, besides\r\nthe guard we had to the north of us, both east and west our way was\r\nbarred by Tibetan soldiers, and although it was not possible to get on\r\nduring the day without being seen, I absolutely refused to go back south.\r\nI held a palaver with my men, who were apparently resigned, and they\r\nagreed to accompany me as far as the Maium Pass (on the road to Lhassa),\r\nwhich we reckoned to be some fifteen or eighteen marches. They further\r\nagreed to endeavour to obtain yaks and food for me, and I was then to\r\ndismiss them. From the summit of the hill I had climbed, I had taken\r\ncareful bearings, and when night came, aided by my luminous compass, I\r\nled my men high up along the mountain range at an average elevation of\r\n1500 feet above the Gyanema-Taklakot track.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and stormy, and we encountered much difficulty in our\r\njourney forward owing to the slippery ground, alternated with the ever\r\ntroublesome loose _debris_ and shifting rocks. We could not see far\r\nahead, and though we well knew from the angle of the slope that we were\r\ntravelling along a precipice, we could not distinguish anything under us\r\nexcept a peculiarly luminous streak far, far down below--undoubtedly the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nI could not explain this luminosity of the water, which did not seem to\r\ncome from reflection of the light of stars or the moon, because the sky\r\nwas very cloudy at the time. Moreover, the river had a curious greenish\r\ntint quite peculiar to itself, and closely resembling the light produced\r\nby an electric spark. In the more dangerous spots we had to proceed for\r\nlong distances on all-fours, and even then we felt hardly safe, for we\r\ncould hear the rattling of the stones rolling down the steep slope, and\r\nby this sound we could judge that we were proceeding over a precipice of\r\nextraordinary height. So difficult and painful was the walking, that it\r\ntook us four hours to go about three miles; and we felt so exhausted,\r\nthat from time to time we had to lie down and rest, shivering with cold,\r\nand our hands bleeding from cuts caused by the sharp stones. I mustered\r\nmy men. Poor Mansing the leper was missing. When we last saw him he was\r\nmoaning under his load, and he constantly stumbled and fell. Two men were\r\nsent in search, but after an hour\'s absence they failed to discover him.\r\nThe faithful Chanden Sing and the Shoka Dola were then despatched, as I\r\nwould not abandon the poor wretch if by any means he could be saved.\r\nAfter another hour of anxiety, the two returned, bringing the unfortunate\r\ncoolie with them. The poor fellow\'s hands and feet were badly cut, and\r\nthe pain in the latter was so great that he could not stand erect. He had\r\nfallen fainting from exhaustion, and it was by a mere stroke of luck that\r\nin the darkness Chanden Sing stumbled against his senseless body. Apart\r\nfrom his life, his loss would have been a very serious matter for me, as\r\nhe carried my bedding and photographic cameras.\r\n\r\nSleet and rain commenced to fall, and the cold was intense. We continued\r\nto climb steadily, Chanden Sing and I helping the poor leper along. The\r\nmarch soon became less difficult, as we were following a depression\r\nformed by the action of melting snows, and were sheltered from the\r\npiercing wind which had been hitherto driving the sleet hard into our\r\nfaces. We slowly covered some three miles more, and during that time the\r\nstorm passed away, leaving the atmosphere beautifully clear. When we\r\nreached the pass (over 17,000 feet), a curious optical phenomenon\r\nastonished us all. The larger stars and planets, of a dazzling brilliancy\r\nsuch as I had never in my life seen before, seemed to swing to and fro in\r\nthe sky with rapid and sudden jerks, describing short arcs of a circle,\r\nand returning each time to their normal position. The effect was so\r\nweird, that the first thing that struck me was that something had gone\r\nwrong with my vision, but my companions saw the same phenomenon: another\r\ncurious thing was that the stars nearer the horizon disappeared and\r\nreappeared behind the mountain range. The oscillations of the heavenly\r\nbodies nearer the horizon were less rapid, but the angle of the arc\r\ndescribed measured almost double that traced by the stars directly above\r\nour heads. The oscillations of these, however, were very much more rapid,\r\nespecially at certain moments, when the star itself could no more be\r\ndiscerned, and a continuous line of light appeared on the deep blue\r\nbackground of the sky. This strange optical illusion, which began soon\r\nafter the storm had entirely cleared away, lasted some time; then the\r\nvibrations gradually became less violent, and stars and planets\r\neventually resumed their normal steadiness, and shone with great\r\nbrilliancy and beauty. We crossed the pass, and halted directly on the\r\nnorthern side of it, for my men\'s feet were in such a condition that they\r\ncould bear the pain no longer. The minimum temperature was but 12 deg., and\r\nas we had no tent there was only a blanket between us and heaven. When we\r\nwoke in the morning, we found the thermometer had risen to 30 deg., but we\r\nwere enveloped in a thick mist which chilled us to our very marrow. I had\r\nicicles hanging down my moustache, eyelashes and hair, and my cheeks and\r\nnose were covered with a thin layer of ice caused by the respiration\r\nsettling and congealing on my face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n     Night marching--The Lafan and Mafan Lakes--Tize, the sacred\r\n     Kelas--Rhubarb--Butterflies--A hermit Lama--More\r\n     Dacoits--Surrounded by them--Routed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING our night marches, up and down mountain ranges of considerable\r\nheight, we naturally had adventures and escapes far too numerous to\r\nrelate here in exact detail, and I shall not give a full description of\r\neach march on account of the unavoidable monotony of such a narrative. In\r\nconstant storms of grit and snow we crossed range after range, travelling\r\nduring the night and hiding by day, camping at very great altitudes and\r\nundergoing considerable privations. I steered my men towards the\r\nRakstal[21] Lake, and one day, having risen to 17,550 feet, we obtained a\r\nmagnificent view of the two great sheets of water, the Lafan-cho and\r\nMafan-cho, or Rakstal and Mansarowar Lakes, by which latter names they\r\nare more commonly known to non-Tibetans.\r\n\r\nTo the N. of the lakes stood the magnificent Tize, the sacred Kelas\r\nmountain, overtopping by some two thousand feet all the other snowy peaks\r\nof the Gangri chain, which extended roughly from N.W. to S.E. From this\r\nspot we could see more distinctly than from Lama Chokden the band round\r\nthe base of the mountain, which, according to legend, was formed by the\r\nrope of the Rakas (devil) trying to tear down this throne of the gods.\r\n\r\nTize, the great sacred peak, is of fascinating interest, owing to its\r\npeculiar shape. It resembles, as I have said, the giant roof of a temple,\r\nbut to my mind it lacks the gracefulness of sweeping curves such as are\r\nfound in Fujiama of Japan, the Most artistically beautiful mountain I\r\nhave ever seen. Tize is angular, uncomfortably angular, if I may be\r\nallowed the expression, and although its height, the vivid colour of its\r\nbase, and the masses of snow that cover its slopes, give it a peculiar\r\nattraction, it nevertheless struck me as being intensely unpicturesque,\r\nat least from the point from which I saw it, and from which the whole of\r\nit was visible. When clouds were round it, toning down and modifying its\r\nshape, Tize appeared at its best from the painter\'s point of view. Under\r\nthese conditions, I have thought it very beautiful, especially at\r\nsunrise, with one side tinted red and yellow, and its rocky mass standing\r\nmajestic against a background of shiny gold. With my telescope I could\r\nplainly distinguish, especially on the E. side, the defile along which\r\nthe worshippers make the circuit at the base of the mountain, though I\r\nwas told that some pilgrims actually march round it on the snowy ledge\r\ndirectly over the base, and just above the darker band of rock described\r\nbefore. On the S.W. side can be seen, on the top of a lower peak, a\r\ngigantic Obo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR FIRST VIEW OF RAKASTAL]\r\n\r\nThe peregrination round Tize usually takes three days, though some\r\naccomplish it in two days, and under favourable circumstances it has even\r\nbeen done in one day. It is usual for the pilgrims to say certain prayers\r\nand make sacrifices as they proceed, and the more fanatical perform the\r\njourney serpentwise, lying flat on the ground; others, again, do it on\r\ntheir hands and knees, and others walking backwards.\r\n\r\nTize, or Kelas, has an elevation of 21,830 feet, and Nandiphu, W. of it,\r\n19,440 feet, while N.W. of the sacred mountain are visible other summits\r\n20,460 feet, 19,970 feet, and 20,280 feet. Animal life seemed to abound,\r\nfor while I was sketching the panorama before me, a snow leopard bounded\r\ngracefully past us. I had a shot or two at _thar_, and we saw any number\r\nof _kiang_. We found rhubarb, which seemed to be thriving, at so high an\r\nelevation as 17,000 feet, and quantities of yellow flowers in the same\r\nlocality and at the same elevation; and at 19,000 feet I netted two\r\ncouples of small white and black butterflies. They seemed to have great\r\ndifficulty in flying, and hardly rose more than two or three inches off\r\nthe ground, flapping their wings irregularly; they seldom flew more than\r\na few feet, and then remained motionless for long periods before they\r\nattempted to fly again. I had come across the same kind of butterfly at\r\nlower altitudes, 18,600 feet and 17,000 feet, and I invariably found them\r\nin couples.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the lakes, the atmosphere seemed saturated with moisture, for\r\nno sooner had the sun gone down than there was a heavy dew, which soaked\r\nour blankets and clothes. We were at 16,550 feet in a narrow marshy creek\r\nin which we had descended _a pic_ from the last mountain range. From the\r\nsummit of the range we had seen many columns of smoke rising from the\r\nneighbourhood of the Rakas Lake, and we judged that again we must proceed\r\nwith great caution.\r\n\r\nWe cooked our food, and in the middle of the night, for greater safety,\r\nwe shifted our camp on the summit of the plateau in a North-Easterly\r\ndirection, and continued our journey in the morning, high above the\r\nmagnificent blue sheet of the Devil\'s Lake with its pretty islands.\r\n\r\n"Sahib, do you see that island?" exclaimed the Kutial, pointing at a\r\nbarren rock that emerged from the lake. "On it," he continued, "lives a\r\nhermit Lama, a saintly man. He has been there alone for many years, and\r\nhe is held in great veneration by the Tibetans. He exists almost entirely\r\non fish, and occasional swan\'s eggs, and only in winter, when the lake is\r\nfrozen, is communication established with the shore, and supplies of\r\n_tsamba_ are brought to him, for they have no boats in Rakastal, nor any\r\nway of constructing rafts, owing to the absence of wood. The hermit\r\nsleeps in a cave, but generally comes out in the open to pray to Buddha."\r\nDuring the following night, when everything was still, a slight breeze\r\nblowing from the North brought to us, faint and indistinct, the broken\r\nhowls of the hermit.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" I asked of the Shokas.\r\n\r\n"It is the hermit speaking to God. Every night he climbs to the summit of\r\nthe rock, and from there addresses his prayers to Buddha the Great."\r\n\r\n"How is he clothed?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"In skins."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAKASTAL AND ... MANSAROWAR LAKES]\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we had an amusing incident. We came to a creek in\r\nwhich were a number of men and women, hundreds of yaks and sheep, and\r\nsome thirty ponies.\r\n\r\nThe Shokas became alarmed, and immediately pronounced the folks to be\r\nbrigands. I maintained that they were not, and as Kachi expounded the\r\ntheory that the only way to distinguish Dakus from honest beings was to\r\nhear them talk (the Dakus he declared usually shout at the top of their\r\nvoices when conversing, and use language far from select, while\r\nwell-to-do Tibetans speak gently and with refinement), I thought the\r\nonly thing to do was to go and address the people, when by the tone of\r\nvoice we should find out what they were. This, however, did not suit my\r\nShokas, and we were placed in rather a curious position, for to proceed\r\nwe must either pass by the Tibetan encampment, or we must march\r\nsouthwards round a mountain, which would involve considerable trouble,\r\nfatigue, and waste of time. We waited till night came, watching, unseen,\r\nthe Tibetans below us. As is customary with them, they retired at sundown\r\nto their tents. Leaving my men behind, I crawled into their camp during\r\nthe night and peeped into one of the tents. The men were squatting on the\r\nground, round a fire in the centre, upon which steamed two vessels with\r\nstewing tea. One old man, with strongly-marked Mongolian features,\r\naccentuated by the heavy shadows which were cast by the light of the fire\r\nabove his angular cheek-bones and prominent and wrinkled brow, was\r\nbusily revolving his prayer-wheel from left to right, repeating in a\r\nmechanical way the usual _Omne mani padme hun_, words which come from the\r\nSanscrit, and refer to the reincarnation of Buddha from a lotus flower,\r\nmeaning literally, "O God, the gem emerging from a lotus flower." Two or\r\nthree other men, whose faces I could not well see, as they were stooping\r\nvery low, were busy counting money and examining several articles of\r\nIndian manufacture, which undoubtedly had been seized from Shokas. It was\r\nfortunate that they had no dogs in this camp, for I, having discovered\r\nour best way to pass them unperceived, went back to my men and led them,\r\nin the middle of the night, through the camp itself. We proceeded for a\r\nmile or so beyond the encampment, and having selected a well-sheltered\r\nspot where we could rest without fear of discovery, we laid down our\r\nloads and tried to get a few hours\' sleep. Waking at sunrise we were\r\nstartled to find ourselves surrounded by a band of dacoits. They were our\r\nfriends of the previous night, who, having followed our tracks, and\r\nmistaking us for Shoka traders, had now come for a little festive\r\nlooting. On drawing near they were given a somewhat warm reception, and\r\ntheir instant retreat was more speedy than dignified.\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] _Rakastal_--Devil\'s Lake, also very frequently pronounced Rakstal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n     Spied and followed by robbers--Jogpas\'\r\n     hospitality--Hares--Tibetan charms resisted--Attempt to snatch\r\n     Chanden Sing\'s rifle out of his hands--The ridge between Rakas\r\n     and Mansarowar Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE wended our way along a narrow valley towards the shore of the Devil\'s\r\nLake, halting to cook our food about half a mile from the water\'s edge,\r\nand I took this opportunity to make observations for longitude. Also\r\naltitude with hypsometrical apparatus. Water boiled at 185 deg. with\r\ntemperature of atmosphere at 64 deg..\r\n\r\nI had just repacked my instruments, and was lying flat in the sun, some\r\ndistance away from my men, when I thought I saw something move. Jumping\r\nup, I beheld a stalwart Tibetan stealing along the ground only a few\r\nyards away from me, with the object no doubt of taking possession of my\r\nrifle before I had time to discover him. Unfortunately for him, he was\r\nnot quick enough, and all that he gained for his attempt was a good\r\npounding with the butt of my Mannlicher. He was one of the Dakus we had\r\nseen in the morning, and no doubt they had followed and spied upon us all\r\nalong. Having got over his first surprise, the dacoit, with an amusing\r\nair of assumed innocence, requested us to go and spend the night in his\r\ntent with him and his mates. They would treat us right royally, he said.\r\nBeing, however, well acquainted with the hospitality of dacoits, we\r\ndeclined the invitation. The brigand went away somewhat shaken and\r\ndisappointed, and we continued our journey along the water-edge of the\r\nDevil\'s Lake (Rakas-tal), where hundreds of hares sprang from under our\r\nfeet, several of which I killed with my rifle, using bullet cartridges.\r\nThere were signs all along that at some previous epoch the level of the\r\nlake must have been much higher than it is at present.\r\n\r\nMarching during the day we encountered many Tibetans, some of whom were\r\nDogpas, others Jogpas. When they saw us approaching they generally\r\nbolted, driving their sheep or yaks in front of them. Nevertheless, we\r\ncame upon two Tibetan women, very dirty, and their faces smeared with\r\nblack ointment to prevent the skin from cracking in the high wind. They\r\nwere dressed in long sheepskin garments, worn out and filthy, and their\r\ncoiffures were so unwashed that they emitted a sickening odour. I ordered\r\nthem not to come too near us, for although these females had no claims\r\nwhatever to beauty--and, as far as I could see they possessed no other\r\ncharm--one being old and toothless, the other with a skin like a lizard,\r\nthey actually tried to decoy us to their tents, possibly with the object\r\nof getting us robbed by their men. My men seemed little attracted by the\r\ncomical speeches and gestures with which they sought to beguile us, and I\r\npushed on so as to be rid of this uncanny pack as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nFour Tibetans, who attempted to snatch Chanden Sing\'s rifle out of his\r\nhand, received from him a battering that they were unlikely soon to\r\nforget, and after this we were fortunately left alone for the remainder\r\nof the day. In the evening, Chanden Sing fired at a black wolf which came\r\nclose to camp, and I discovered, about one hundred feet above lake-level,\r\nimbedded in the mountain side, a stratum of gigantic fossils, which,\r\nowing to their size and weight, I regretted to be unable to dig out and\r\ncarry away.\r\n\r\nFeeling almost certain that we were being spied upon all the time by the\r\nnumerous Jogpas we had met, we attempted to dodge them by pretending to\r\nencamp before sunset. However, we only lighted a fine fire, and then\r\nafter dark escaped, walking and stumbling for several miles, until we\r\nfound a spot high on the hillside where we considered ourselves safe.\r\nSnow fell heavily during the night, and, as usual, we woke up with\r\nicicles hanging from our moustaches, eyelashes and hair, notwithstanding\r\nwhich we really were quite happy and well.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to make quite sure from many points that, as can\r\nbe seen from the illustration reproduced in these pages, the ridge\r\nbetween the Rakas and Mansarowar Lakes is continuous, and no\r\ncommunication between the two lakes exists. With the exception of a small\r\ndepression about half-way across, the ridge has an average height of\r\n1000 feet all along, a fact which ought in itself to dispose of the\r\ntheory that the two lakes are one. I also further ascertained from the\r\nnatives that there is no communication whatever between them, though the\r\ndepression in the ridge makes it probable that at a very remote period\r\nsome connection existed. The lowest point in this depression is over 300\r\nfeet above the level of the lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DACOIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n     More robbers--The friends of Tibetan authorities--A snap-shot--A\r\n     meek lot--Prepossessing female and her curious ways--The purchase\r\n     of two yaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST before leaving the shores of the Rakstal I had a great slice of\r\nluck. It happened thus. We had been detected by another band of dacoits\r\nwho were trying their hardest to overtake us. I had been spying them with\r\nmy telescope as they rode in our direction. They were driving some twenty\r\nyaks in front of them at an unusually fast pace. The dacoits rode ponies.\r\nWe were about a mile and a half ahead of them now, and close to the edge\r\nof the Devil\'s Lake. We saw them coming down the hillside at a breakneck\r\nspeed straight in our direction. It was evident that they were after us.\r\nMy men became terror-stricken when I gave the order to halt.\r\n\r\nThe band of dacoits approached and left the yaks in charge of two women.\r\nWhen they galloped in a line towards us, my men, with the exception of\r\nChanden Sing and Mansing, were paralysed with fright.\r\n\r\nThey were now a hundred yards off. With loaded rifle in one hand, and my\r\ncamera in the other, I advanced to meet them, knowing that, with their\r\nold-fashioned matchlocks, it takes them a considerable time to light the\r\nfuse and fire a shot. Moreover, it is almost an impossibility for them to\r\nfire on horseback, their weapons being heavy and cumbersome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANDITS LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS]\r\n\r\nI focused them in my twin lens photographic apparatus, and waited till I\r\nhad them well in the field. I snapped the shot when they were only thirty\r\nyards away, vaulting over their ponies in the act of dismounting. The\r\ncamera, having done its work, was quickly deposited on the ground, and\r\nthe rifle shouldered. I shouted to them to put down their weapons, and\r\nto give force to my request I aimed at them with my Mannlicher.\r\n\r\nA meeker lot of brigands I do not believe could be found, though people\r\nof that kind are often brave when it is easy for them to be courageous.\r\nTheir matchlocks were unslung from their shoulders with remarkable\r\nquickness and flung to the ground, and their jewelled swords were laid by\r\nthe side of their firearms. They went down on their knees, and taking off\r\ntheir caps with both hands, put out their tongues in sign of salute and\r\nsubmission, and I could not help taking another snap-shot at them in that\r\nattitude, which was comical, to say the least of it.\r\n\r\nMy bearer, who had been left to look after the baggage, had placed\r\nMansing in charge, and was now by my side with the Martini-Henry, when\r\none of the women, riding astride, arrived on the scene. She was evidently\r\nfurious at the cowardice of her men, and I liked her for that. She jumped\r\noff her steed, ejaculated words at the top of her voice, shaking her\r\nfists at the men still kneeling before me, and at last, foaming with\r\nrage, spat on them. While thus haranguing the band of highwaymen, she had\r\nan annoying way of pointing at my baggage, but her speech seemed to have\r\nlittle effect on the submissive crowd.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, went up to her, patted her on the back, and gave her a\r\nrupee to hold her tongue. She grabbed the coin and rubbed it on her skin\r\ncoat to make the silver shine. She instantly became calm, and rubbing the\r\ncoin until it was quite bright, she raised her fiery eyes, staring into\r\nmine, and pulled out her tongue to express her thanks.\r\n\r\nKachi and Dola, who knew Tibetan well, were now summoned to address the\r\nfilibusters for me, and these two Shokas were in such trepidation that\r\nthey could hardly walk, much less speak. After a while, however, seeing\r\nhow well I had these supposed terrific rangers under control, they were\r\nat last able to translate.\r\n\r\n"I want them to sell me some yaks and some ponies," I said. "I will pay\r\nhandsomely for them."\r\n\r\n"They say they cannot. The Tarjum will cut their heads off if he comes to\r\nknow it. They will only sell one or two yaks."\r\n\r\n"Very good. How much do they want?"\r\n\r\n"Two hundred silver rupees. But," added Dola, "sahib, do not give them\r\nmore than forty. That is a great deal more than they are worth. A good\r\nyak costs from ten to sixteen rupees."\r\n\r\nAfter some three or four hours\' bargaining, during which time the bandits\r\ndescended gradually from two hundred rupees to forty and I rose from\r\ntwenty to that figure, we at last agreed, amidst the greatest excitement\r\non both sides, that their two best yaks should become my property. I\r\nthen, becoming quite friendly, purchased pack-saddles from them, and\r\nsundry other curiosities. They gave me tea even and _tsamba_. The fiery\r\nwoman only had still a peculiar way of keeping her eyes fixed on my\r\nbaggage, and her longing for my property seemed to increase when she saw\r\nme paying for the yaks. If she kept one eye on my goods, I kept both\r\nthere; and I took good care that my rifle was never out of my hand, and\r\nthat no one ever came too near me from behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACK-SADDLES FOR YAKS]\r\n\r\nWe counted the money down, some fifty rupees, including all purchases.\r\nEach coin was passed round and sounded by each of our sellers, and when\r\nthe entire sum was handed over the coins were passed back and recounted\r\nso that there should be no mistake. Time in Tibet is not money, and my\r\nreaders must not be surprised when I tell them that counting, recounting\r\nand sounding the small amount took two more hours. The two yaks were\r\neventually handed over to us. One, a huge long-haired black animal,\r\nrestless and powerful; the other equally black, strong and hairy, but\r\nsomewhat gentler.\r\n\r\nTo catch them, separate them from the herd, pass ropes through their\r\nrespective nostrils, and tie pack-saddles on their backs, were all\r\noperations we as novices had to master. It was hard work indeed, but we\r\nstruggled till we succeeded.\r\n\r\nWhen we parted we were good friends, the bandits behaving admirably, and\r\nI made up my mind that I would at any time rather trust a bandit in Tibet\r\nthan an official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n     Tibetan coats, hats, and boots--Why a Tibetan prefers to leave\r\n     half the chest and one arm bare--Ornamentations--Manner and\r\n     speech--Ignorance and superstition--Way of eating--Jogpa women\r\n     and children--Head-dress.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a way, I was sorry when my interview with the Jogpas came to an end,\r\nfor, although they were undoubtedly brigands, they were certainly\r\ninteresting. Their original and curious dress and manner of conversation,\r\ntheir unusual but eminently suitable mode of eating, and their jovial\r\nfreedom of demeanour, were really quite refreshing. Their dress was quite\r\nrepresentative of Tibet, for the men wore a great variety of coats and\r\nhats, probably owing to the facility with which they obtained them, and\r\nno two individuals were dressed alike, though certain leading\r\ncharacteristics of dress were conserved in each case. One man wore a\r\ngaudy coat trimmed with leopard skin, another had a long grey woollen\r\nrobe like a dressing-gown, taken up at the waist by a kamarband, and a\r\nthird was garbed in a loose raiment of sheepskin, with the wool inside.\r\nYet a fourth was arrayed in a deep red tunic fastened by a belt of\r\nleather with silver ornamentations inlaid in wrought-iron to hold a\r\nneedle-case, tinder-pouch and steel, with a bead hanging from the leather\r\nthong, and a pretty dagger with sheath of ebony, steel, and filigree\r\nsilver, besides other articles, such as a bullet-pouch and bag. In their\r\nkamarbands or belts, the Jogpas, in common with the majority of Tibetan\r\nmen, wear a sword in front, and whether the coat is long or short, it is\r\ninvariably loose and made to bulge at the waist in order that it may\r\ncontain a store of eating and drinking bowls, the "_pu-kus_," snuff-box,\r\nand sundry bags of money, and _tsamba_ and bricks of tea! It is owing to\r\nthis custom that most Tibetan men, when seen at first, impress one as\r\nbeing very stout, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are somewhat slight\r\nin figure. Tibetans leave one arm and part of the chest bare, letting the\r\nsleeve hang loose. The reason for this practice, which seems to have\r\npuzzled many people, is that in Tibet the days are very hot and the\r\nnights cold (the drop in the thermometer in S.W. Tibet being at times as\r\nmuch as 80 deg. and even 100 deg.), and as the Tibetans always sleep in their\r\nclothes, the garments that protect their bodies from being frozen at\r\nnight are found too heavy and warm in the hot sun, and therefore this\r\nsimple expedient is adopted. When sitting down, both arms are drawn from\r\nthe sleeves and the chest and back are left bare; but when on foot, one\r\narm, usually the left, is slipped in, to prevent the coat and its heavy\r\ncontents from falling off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE WOOLLEN COAT AND SASHES--WOOLLEN SOCKS]\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in pronouncing the Tibetan boots, from a practical\r\npoint of view of utility, as the best in the world. They have all the\r\nadvantages a boot should possess, especially those with flat soles of\r\nthick twisted cord. The upper part, being made of red and green felt,\r\nkeeps the foot warm without preventing ventilation, and plenty of\r\nspreading room is left for the toes when walking. The felt gaiter,\r\nreaching to just below the knee, holds the soft sole of the boot flat\r\nunder the foot, giving absolutely free action to the ankle. The most\r\nsalient and sensible point in the Tibetan footgear, however, is that the\r\nfoot, all but the top part, is encased in the thick sole, thus preventing\r\nthe jamming of toes between stones when walking, for instance, on\r\n_debris_, and also doing away with the accumulation of snow and mud\r\nbetween the sole and boot, so inconvenient in our footgear. There are\r\nmany varieties and makes of boots in Tibet, but the principle is always\r\nthe same. The boots are always homemade, each individual making his own,\r\nexcept in large towns, where footgear can be purchased, and necessarily\r\nthe quality is then not up to the same high standard. The difference in\r\nTibetan boots is mainly in the quality or texture of the soles; for\r\ninstance, the Lhassa boots have finer, softer, and more elastic soles\r\nthan those made in Sigatz (usually written Shigatze), which are quite\r\nhard and stiff, and supposed to wear out much sooner than the more\r\npliable ones of the sacred city. Then there are some with leather soles,\r\nmade specially for wet or snowy regions, and these when greased over are\r\nquite waterproof. Two kinds of these are in use, one with pointed and\r\ncurled toes for cutting one\'s way into the snow, the other of the usual\r\nshape. Men and women alike wear these boots. The principal Lamas and\r\nofficials of Tibet have adopted the Chinese-pattern boots of leather,\r\nwith heavy leather or wooden soles and enormous nails under them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAN\'S BOOT, MADE AT SIGATZ--SNOW BOOT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN\'S BOOT--BOOT MADE IN LHASSA]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans have innumerable varieties of headgear. The most peculiar of\r\nall, worn chiefly by soldiers and dacoits, is one in the form of a\r\nsection of a cone with large rim, made entirely of twisted cord like that\r\nused for the soles of the boots, and with a hole at the top for\r\nventilation. The conical part being too small to fit the head, it is held\r\nupon the skull by means of two strings tied under the chin. There are\r\nalso conical brown and grey felt ones, not unlike filters used in\r\nchemical laboratories, and these, when of the better quality, are\r\nfrequently ornamented with gold, blue, or red embroidery of Chinese\r\nmanufacture. An impressive headgear was worn by the medicine man attached\r\nto the band of robbers I had interviewed. It resembled at first sight an\r\nexaggerated jockey\'s cap of red silk, but closer examination showed that\r\nit consisted of two long strips of red silk, well stretched on a light\r\nframe of bamboo, set at an angle of about 90 deg.. This hat was held on the\r\nhead by means of a band round the back of the head, and it projected some\r\nfifteen inches over the forehead. In addition to these there are of\r\ncourse common cloth or fur caps with ear-flaps; and it is not uncommon to\r\nsee, in Tibet, soldiers wearing a silk kamarband bound tightly round the\r\nhead, turban-fashion, with one end left hanging down over the ear. The\r\ncommoner Tibetan, however, is not fond of covering his head, and though\r\nhe often has one or more caps stowed away in the loose folds of his coat,\r\nhe seldom wears one on his head under ordinary circumstances. This does\r\nnot apply to officials, who are never seen without a circular cap of\r\nChinese shape, surmounted by a top-knot. All men, except the Lamas, who\r\nshave their heads clean, wear a pigtail, short and shaggy at times, or\r\nlong and ornamented with a piece of cloth, in which it is sewn, and\r\npassed through rings of ivory, bone, glass, metal, or coral. Ornaments of\r\nsilver, such as perforated coins, are much used in adorning the men\'s\r\npigtails, and coral and malachite ornaments are also common in Tibet for\r\nthe same purpose, and are much valued by the natives. Men wear, passed\r\nthrough the lobe of the ear, an earring with malachite ornamentations,\r\nand often with an additional long pendant. It is usually of brass or\r\nsilver, and occasionally of gold. More common than the solitary earring\r\nis the brass or silver charm-box, frequently containing a likeness of\r\nBuddha, which nearly every Tibetan carries slung round his neck. Tibetans\r\nare, as a rule, excessively superstitious and fond of charms of every\r\nsort. Their superstitions are, of course, the result of ignorance, and so\r\nare most of their other bad qualities. Except among the higher officials\r\nand the Lamas, education can hardly be said to exist in Tibet, the\r\npopulation being kept in the most obscure ignorance. Few can read, and\r\nnone can write, and the Lamas take very good care that only those shall\r\nlearn who are likely to be of use. Honesty and honour are two qualities\r\nalmost unknown in any class or condition in Tibet, and as for\r\ntruthfulness, all travellers in the country can testify to the practical\r\nimpossibility of obtaining it from a Tibetan. Cruelty is innate in them,\r\nand vice and crime are everywhere rampant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAT, AS WORN BY OFFICIALS]\r\n\r\nThat the Jogpas had good digestions was evident from the way they ate\r\nwhen, having concluded the sale of the yaks, they squatted down to a\r\nhearty meal of _tsamba_, _chura_, and tea. They took from their coats\r\ntheir wooden and metal _pu-kus_, and quickly filled them with _tsamba_;\r\npouring over it some steaming tea made as usual with butter and salt in a\r\nchurn, they stirred it round and round the bowl with their dirty fingers\r\nuntil a paste was formed, which they rolled into a ball and ate, the same\r\noperation being repeated over and over again until their appetite was\r\nsatisfied. Each time, before refilling, the bowl was licked clean by\r\nrotating the _pu-ku_ round and round the tongue. Feeling the heat of the\r\nsun, after their meal both men and women removed their garments above the\r\nwaist, showing ornaments of gold, silver and copper encircling their\r\nnecks.\r\n\r\nThe women-folk of the dacoits, though far from beautiful, possessed a\r\ncertain charm, arising from their curious wildness. Unlike those of the\r\ngenerality of Tibetan women, their teeth were very good, and their\r\ncomplexion was not specially dark, the black ointment with which their\r\ncheeks, noses, and foreheads were smeared making them appear darker than\r\nthey really were, and being decidedly unbecoming. All of them had regular\r\nfeatures, and their eyes and mouths were full of expression. Their hair\r\nhad been plaited into numberless little tresses, brought up and fastened\r\nin a graceful curve over the head, kept firm by a red turban, which was\r\narranged to show another row of little tresses on the forehead, the ends\r\nbeing joined in succession to one another. They wore large earrings of\r\ngold inlaid with malachite, and were in manner so unaffected that they\r\ndisregarded even the most primitive conventions.\r\n\r\nThe children were talkative, and had the bearing of adults. They wore\r\nswords in their belts, even at the early age of eight or ten years. In a\r\nbasket that had been carried by one of the yaks I saw an infant only a\r\nfew months old. I caressed it, to the horror of his superstitious mother,\r\nwho snatched the child away and washed and rubbed the poor little\r\nfellow\'s face until the skin was sore, declaring that children die who\r\nare touched by strangers.\r\n\r\nThe men were just as bad in this, and when I purchased some rice from\r\nthem they would not let me handle it till it had become my property. They\r\nobjected each time that I stretched out my arm to touch the bag of rice,\r\nand showed me eventually a handful of rice at a considerable distance, to\r\nlet me judge of its quality. I had to purchase only the handful at first.\r\nHaving assured myself that it was all right, I then purchased the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n     A Daku\'s strange ideas--The ridge between the two lakes--Black\r\n     tents--Confronting the two lakes--A chain of high\r\n     peaks--Gombas--Change in the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE had marched on the same afternoon about half a mile in the direction\r\nof Mansarowar, when we were overtaken by one of the Dakus, whom we had\r\nleft a short time before. He rode towards us, apparently in a great state\r\nof excitement. Having dismounted, he drew his sword and began chasing one\r\nof my yaks. This seemed so strange a proceeding that we were at a loss to\r\nunderstand his intentions, but as he screamed to us that he meant no harm\r\nwe let him go on. He eventually overtook one recalcitrant yak, and, after\r\na struggle with the unfortunate beast, he flung his arms round its neck\r\nand rested his head between its horns. I was anything but pleased with\r\nthese antics, fearing that this effusion was only a dodge to cut the\r\nbeast\'s throat. Much to my astonishment, I found that the young Jogpa had\r\nseized a tuft of the yak\'s hair with his teeth and was trying to tear it\r\noff, while the unfortunate beast was making desperate efforts to shake\r\noff its persecutor. The hair eventually gave way, and with a mouthful of\r\nit hanging from both sides of his tightly closed lips the Jogpa now let\r\ngo of the animal\'s head, and, brandishing his sword, made a dash for its\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nI seized the man by his pigtail, while he in his turn clung to the tail\r\nof the frightened yak, which bolting, dragged us after it at an\r\nunpleasant pace.\r\n\r\nThe Jogpa, in our mad flight, cut off a long lock of the yak\'s silky\r\nhair, and having secured this, appeared to be quite satisfied, let go and\r\nsheathed his sword. He concealed the stolen locks in his coat, and then\r\nmade profound obeisances to us, putting out his tongue as usual and\r\ndeclaring that unless that precaution is taken when parting with a beast,\r\nbad luck is sure to come to you. This closed the incident: the Jogpa rode\r\naway perfectly happy, and we continued our march across the stony plain\r\nuntil we reached the ridge which extends across it and divides the two\r\nsheets of water. We climbed up to the top, rising to 16,450 feet, and to\r\nmake certain that the ridge really extended right across, I made an\r\nexpedition about half-way across, finding the northern part somewhat\r\nlower than the southern, still rising several hundred feet above the\r\nlevel of the lakes. This expedition incurred some loss of time, and when\r\nnight came we were still on the ridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BLACK YAK]\r\n\r\nFrom our camping-ground we saw fifteen black tents on the hillside, and\r\nto the E. on the lake shore there was a large Gomba or Lamasery, with a\r\ntemple and a number of mud houses. I estimated the distance between\r\nourselves and the Gomba at only eight miles, a cheering fact, because I\r\nhoped to get fresh provisions there to enable us to proceed more rapidly\r\non our journey. We were now quite out of reach of the Gyanema sepoys, as\r\nwell as of the Barca Tarjum and the Taklakot Jong Pen, and if we could\r\nonly obtain a sufficient quantity of food during the night, and proceed\r\nby the jungle early the next day, there would be little danger of our\r\nbeing overtaken. The Shokas were, of course, again shaking with fright at\r\nthe idea of entering a Tibetan settlement, but I told them very firmly\r\nthat we must reach Tucker Gomba and village that night.\r\n\r\nWe had below us the two great lakes, and before I left this magnificent\r\npanorama, I could not help taking a last long look at the marvellous\r\nscene. The Devil\'s Lake, with its broken, precipitous shores, its rocky\r\nislands and outstretching peninsulas, was far more enchanting to me than\r\nthe sacred lake at its side, in which, according to tradition, dwell\r\nMahadeva (pronounced Mahadeve) and all the other good gods. Although the\r\nwater is equally blue and limpid; although each lake has for background\r\nthe same magnificent Gangri chain, Mansarowar, the creation of Brahma,\r\nfrom whom it takes its name, is not nearly so weirdly fascinating as its\r\nneighbour. Mansarowar has no ravines rising precipitously from its\r\nwaters, in which their vivid colouring would be reflected as in a mirror;\r\nit is almost a perfect oval, without indentations. There is a stony,\r\nslanting plain some two miles wide between the water\'s edge and the hills\r\nsurrounding it, except along the ridge separating it from the Rakstal,\r\nwhere its shore is slightly more rugged and precipitous.\r\n\r\nDirectly south of the lake is a chain of high peaks covered with snow,\r\nfrom which several streams descend. From where we stood we could see\r\nevident signs, as in the case of the Rakstal, that the level of the lake\r\nmust at one time have been at least thirty feet higher than it is at\r\npresent, and the slanting bed of small rounded and smooth stones, which\r\nextends from one-and-a-half to two miles beyond the water-line, is\r\nevidence enough that the water must once have been up to that point; I\r\nbelieve that it is still gradually receding.\r\n\r\nRound the lake there are several tumbling-down sheds in charge of Lamas,\r\nbut only one important Gomba (monastery) and a temple are to be\r\nfound--viz., at Tucker village.\r\n\r\nI was told that a small Gomba and _serai_ in charge of Lamas stands to\r\nthe N.W. of the lake, but I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the\r\nstatement, as I did not visit it myself, and the information I received\r\nfrom Tibetans regarding its position and importance was conflicting.\r\n\r\nAs the nature of the country suddenly altered between the Devil\'s Lake\r\nand Mansarowar, so, too, the weather and the temperature greatly changed.\r\nOver the Rakstal we invariably saw a lovely blue sky, whereas over\r\nMansarowar heavy black clouds always lowered, and rain fell incessantly.\r\nFrom time to time the wind blew off the rain for a few minutes, and\r\nlovely effects of light played on the water, but fresh clouds, with\r\nviolent bursts of thunder, soon made the scene again gloomy and\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\nIt was much warmer on the Mansarowar side of the ridge than on the other,\r\nand, probably owing to dampness, the air seemed quite thick to breathe,\r\ninstead of being crisp and light, as it was along the shores of the\r\nDevil\'s Lake. Indeed, when I recall the Mansarowar, I cannot help\r\nthinking that it is the home, not only of the gods, but also of all the\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TIBETAN FORTUNE TELLER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n     The Langa Tsangpo--A terrific storm--Drenched to the skin--Heavy\r\n     marching--Against the gods--Difficulty in finding the Lamasery\r\n     and village--A bark!--Arrival at last--Gentle tapping--Under a\r\n     roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE descended some two miles to the plain, and crossed a rapid delta of\r\nthe Langa Tsangpo or Langa River; then another, a mile farther. As these\r\nrivers came directly from the snows, the water was very cold, and often\r\nthree or four feet deep, owing to the thawing of the snow and ice during\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had we reached the shores of the Mansarowar, than the heavy\r\nclouds which had been hanging over our heads poured forth such a torrent\r\nof rain, that in a moment we were drenched to the skin. We were marching\r\nvery fast, as all our heavy loads were now on the two yaks, but night was\r\nwell advanced, and the darkness was such that we could only see a few\r\ninches in front of us. We were actually walking in an inch or two of\r\nwater, and a fierce S.E. wind drove the rain and hail so hard into our\r\nfaces and hands as to cause us considerable pain. We were frozen in our\r\nwet garments, and our teeth were chattering, though we walked quickly,\r\nkeeping close together. From time to time a bright flash of lightning\r\nshone on the lake, followed by a terrific crash of thunder, and by what\r\nwe could see during those few seconds of light we tried to steer our way\r\ntowards Tucker village and Gomba.\r\n\r\nThe rivers, swollen by the rain, were extremely difficult to cross, and\r\nthe water seemed to flow so rapidly on the inclined bed, that it was all\r\nwe could do to keep on our feet. So wet were we that we did not even take\r\nthe trouble to remove our shoes or garments, and we splashed through,\r\nclothes and all. Three times we went into the freezing water above our\r\nwaists, and then we marched for apparently endless miles on the pebbly\r\nand stony incline. We could not see where we were going, and the storm\r\nseemed to grow worse every moment: we stumbled on amidst large stones and\r\nboulders, and fell over one another on slippery rocks. Farther on, we\r\nsank up to our knees in mud, and each time that we lifted a foot it\r\nseemed to be of lead. It was a downpour such as I had seldom before\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure, Kachi, that this lake is the home of the gods?" I\r\ninquired of Kachi. "Why, even on the Devil\'s Lake we had better weather\r\nthan this."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied Kachi. "But you make the gods angry, and that is why\r\nthey send thunder, hail and rain to stop your progress. You are going on\r\nagainst the gods, sir."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Kachi. It cannot pour for ever."\r\n\r\nAt midnight we had no idea of our position, still we pushed on.\r\n\r\n"Have we passed the Gomba? Have we not yet reached it?" were the\r\nquestions we asked each other. It seemed to me that, at the rate we were\r\ngoing, we ought by now to be very near the place, and yet after another\r\nhour\'s tramp we had not struck it. I was under the belief that we had\r\ngone about nine miles, and I expressed the opinion that we had passed it,\r\nbut the Shokas insisted that we had not, so we again proceeded.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly gone five hundred yards, when we heard a faint, distant,\r\nand most welcome dog\'s bark. It came from the N.W., and we surmised that\r\nit must come from Tucker. We had steered too far south of the place,\r\nwhich accounted for our missing it in the darkness.\r\n\r\nGuided by the yelping, we hastily directed our steps towards the\r\nsettlements. The dog\'s solitary howl was at once supplemented by fifty\r\nmore angry barks, and though we knew by the sound that we were\r\napproaching the village, it was so dark and stormy that we could not find\r\nthe place. Only when we found ourselves close to the mud huts could we be\r\ncertain that we had at last arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was now between 2 and 3 A.M. The rain still came down in torrents,\r\nand, alas! there was no sign of any of the inhabitants being willing to\r\ngive us shelter. It was quite out of the question to pitch our little\r\n_tente d\'abri_, for our things were already wringing wet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY TWO YAKS]\r\n\r\nThe noise we made tapping outside a door was determined, so much so that\r\nthe door itself nearly gave way. This was a shelter-house, a _serai_\r\nfor pilgrims, and as we claimed to be pilgrims, we had, by the laws of\r\nthe country, a right to admission. The Kutial Nattoo, who had once before\r\nreached this lake by a different route, led us to this house.\r\n\r\n"You are dacoits," said a hoarse voice from inside; "or you would not\r\ncome at this hour."\r\n\r\n"No, we are not," we entreated. "Please open. We are well-to-do people.\r\nWe will harm no one, and pay for all."\r\n\r\n"_Middu, Middu!_" ("Cannot be, no.") "You are dacoits. I will not open."\r\n\r\nTo show that we were not what they imagined, faithful Chanden Sing and\r\nDola tapped again so gently at the door that the bolt gave way. The next\r\nmoment ten strangers were squatting down round a warm fire drying their\r\nshrivelled-up, soaked skins by the flame of dried tamarisk and dung. The\r\nlandlord, a doctor by the way, was reassured when he saw that we had no\r\nevil intentions, and found some silver coins in the palm of his hand. Yet\r\nhe said he would rather that we slept somewhere else: there was a capital\r\nempty hut next door.\r\n\r\nOn our agreeing to this, he conducted us to the place, and there we spent\r\nthe remainder of the night, or rather the early morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n     The interior of a _serai_--Vermin--Fish, local jewellery, and\r\n     pottery for sale--Favourite shapes and patterns--How pottery is\r\n     made.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR abode was a one-storeyed house built of stones and mud with a flat\r\nroof. There were two rooms, the first lighted by the door, the second and\r\nlarger having a square aperture in the ceiling for the triple purpose of\r\nventilation, lighting and outlet for the smoke of the fire, which burnt\r\ndirectly underneath in the centre of the room. The beams and rafters\r\nsupporting the roof had been brought over from the other side of the\r\nHimahlyas, as no wood is to be found in Western Tibet.\r\n\r\nThis _serai_ was in charge of a young, half-demented lama, who was most\r\nprofuse in salutations, and who remained open-mouthed, gazing at us for a\r\nconsiderable time. He was polite and attentive in helping to dry our\r\nthings in the morning, and, whenever we asked for anything, he ran out of\r\nthe _serai_ in frantic fits of merriment, always bringing in what we\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER LHASSA COINS]\r\n\r\nThe heavy storm during the night had flooded our room, and there was only\r\none corner slightly drier than the rest of the floor, where we all slept\r\nhuddled together. These _serais_ have no claim to cleanliness, and on\r\nthis occasion all the minor animal life that inhabited the floor had,\r\nwith a view to avoiding the water, retreated to the higher portion of the\r\nroom, which we also had selected, so that one more trial was added to\r\nall our other miseries, for we were half devoured by a variety of\r\n"insects." This, indeed, was a dreadful pest, and one from which we\r\nsuffered indescribable agonies, not only on this occasion but whenever we\r\nhalted near Tibetan camps. When we rose in the morning the room was full\r\nof Tibetan men, women and children, who seemed very good-natured and\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COPPER COINS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARRING WORN BY MEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER CHARM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD AND MALACHITE BROOCH]\r\n\r\n"_Tanga chick!_" (a silver coin equivalent to half a rupee) cried an old\r\nwoman, who stuck a dried fish under my nose, professing volubly that it\r\nhad been caught in Mansarowar, and that it would make its possessor the\r\nhappiest of mortals. Others unrolled, from pieces of red cloth, jewellery\r\nin the form of brooches, rings, and earrings of brass or silver inlaid\r\nwith malachite.\r\n\r\n"_Gurmoh sum!_" (three rupees), "_Diu, diu, diu_" ("Yes yes, yes"),\r\n"_Karuga ni!_" (two two-anna pieces), "_Gientcheke!_" (a four-anna\r\npiece), and so on, all talking at the same time, in their anxiety to\r\ndispose of their goods.\r\n\r\nThe jewellery was of local manufacture, and in some cases the pieces of\r\nmalachite were firmly set, but usually a kind of paste is used for\r\nholding the stones, and consequently, pretty as the jewels are, they soon\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nThe earrings are usually better made than the brooches, but the most\r\ninteresting of all, because simpler and more characteristic, are the flat\r\nsilver charms, such as the one I give in the illustration, ornamented\r\nwith a primitive design. This particular one, which is now in my\r\npossession is of great antiquity, the edges being much worn down. It has\r\nthe lotus pattern in the centre and leaf ornamentations filled in with\r\nlines radiating from a parent stem. Concentric circles occupy the inner\r\nsquare, which also contains circular dots in sets of threes and\r\ncontiguous semicircles. Triangles filled in with parallel lines are a\r\nfavourite form of ornamentation in Tibetan work, and, perhaps, most\r\npopular of all in the mind of the Tibetan artist is the square or the\r\nlozenge outline, with a special inclination towards purely geometrical\r\npatterns, a tradition probably inherited from their Mongol ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting objects to me at Tucker were the specimens of\r\npottery made by the natives, which is manufactured from clay of fine\r\nquality, although it is not properly beaten previous to being worked into\r\nvases, jugs, &c. Moulds are used to fashion the bases of the larger\r\nvessels and the inner part is shaped by the hand; a rough turning-machine\r\nsimplifies the finishing of the upper part of the vase, leaving it\r\ncomparatively smooth. Two handles with rough line ornamentations are\r\nadded to the larger vessels, but one suffices for the jars with longer\r\nneck and small aperture.\r\n\r\nThe two patterns reproduced in the illustration are those more commonly\r\nadopted; the colour is a light greyish terra-cotta, left fairly smooth\r\nand unvarnished. They are well burnt, in primitive furnaces, the Lamas\r\nshowing much skill in the manufacture of these vessels, which find a\r\nready market among the pilgrims to the sacred lake. The tools used in\r\nfashioning the vessels are extremely simple; a piece of flat stone, and\r\ntwo or three wands of wood, beyond which the Tucker potter does not\r\nreally require more than his fingers and his nails to accomplish his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANSAROWAR POTTERY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n     Friendly Lamas--Chanden Sing and Mansing purified--Mansing\'s\r\n     sarcasm--Pilgrims to Mansarowar and their privileges--For\r\n     luck!--Outside the Gomba.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL Lamas came to visit me in the morning, and professed to be\r\npleased to see us; in fact they asked me to go and pay them a visit in\r\nthe Lamasery and temple. They said there was much sickness in the\r\nvillage, and as they believed me to be a Hindoo doctor, they wished I\r\ncould do something to relieve their sufferings. I promised to do all I\r\ncould, and was very glad to have this unique chance of visiting a\r\nLamasery, and of studying the cases that would be brought before me. I\r\ncarried my rifle in my hand even during this friendly visit to the Lamas.\r\n\r\nWhen I came out of our stuffy, dark room, preceded and followed by a\r\ncrowd of inquisitive natives, I had a good look round this strange\r\nvillage. After the storm of the night, we did not have the beautiful blue\r\nsky that might have been expected, but over us hung threatening clouds,\r\nwhile the waters of the sacred lake, softly moved by the wind, made a\r\ngentle lapping sound on the beach. Chanden Sing and Mansing, the two\r\nHindoos, divested of all their clothing except a _doti_, were squatting\r\nnear the edge of the lake, having their heads shaved clean by Bijesing\r\nthe Johari. I must confess that I was somewhat annoyed when I saw them\r\nusing my best razor for the purpose, but I repressed my anger on\r\nremembering that, according to their religion, the fact of being at\r\nMansarowar absolved them from all sins. My two servants, with heads\r\nturned towards Kelas Mount, seemed excited, and were praying so fervently\r\nthat I stood to watch them. They washed themselves repeatedly in the\r\nwater of the lake, and at last plunged into it. On coming out shivering,\r\nthey each took out of their clothes a silver rupee, and flung it into\r\nthe lake as an offering to the God Mahadeva. Then, with hairless faces\r\nand heads, they dressed and came to pay their salaams to me, professing\r\nto be now happy and pure.\r\n\r\n"Siva, the greatest of all gods, lives in the waters of Mansarowar,"\r\nexclaimed my bearer in a poetic mood. "I have bathed in its waters, and\r\nof its waters I have drunk. I have salaamed the great Kelas, the sight of\r\nwhich alone can absolve all sins of humanity; I shall now go to heaven."\r\n\r\n"I shall be satisfied if we get as far as Lhassa," grumbled the sceptical\r\nMansing, out of ear-reach of the Tibetans.\r\n\r\nChanden Sing, who was well versed in religious matters, explained that\r\nonly Hindoo pilgrims who had lost both parents shaved their heads on\r\nvisiting Mansarowar, as a sacrifice to Siva, and if they were of a high\r\ncaste, on their return to their native land after the pilgrimage, it was\r\ncustomary to entertain all the Brahmins of the town to a banquet. A man\r\nwho had bathed in Mansarowar was held in great respect by everybody, and\r\ncommanded the admiration and envy of the entire world.\r\n\r\nThe Mansarowar Lake is about forty-six miles round, and those pilgrims\r\nwho wish to attain a greater state of sanctity make a _kora_ or circuit\r\non foot, along the water-line. The journey occupies from four to seven\r\ndays, according to circumstances, and one trip round will absolve the\r\npilgrim from ordinary sins; twice the circuit clears the conscience of\r\nany murder; and three times will make honest and good a person who has\r\nkilled his or her father, mother, brother or sister. There are fanatics\r\nwho make the tour on their knees, others accomplish the distance lying\r\ndown flat at each step on their faces like the pilgrims to Kelas.\r\n\r\nAccording to legend, Mansarowar was created by Brahma, and he who shall\r\nbathe in its waters will share the paradise of Mahadeva! No matter what\r\ncrimes he may have previously committed, a dip in the holy lake is\r\nsufficient to purge the soul as well as the body! To please my men,\r\ntherefore, and perhaps bring myself some luck, I too hurled a couple of\r\ncoins into the water.\r\n\r\nThe purifying ablutions being over, I ordered Chanden Sing to take his\r\nrifle and follow me into the Gomba, as the Lamas were so polite that I\r\nfeared treachery on their part.\r\n\r\nThe large square building, with its walls painted red and its flattish\r\ndome of gilt copper, rose by the water-side, and was both picturesque and\r\nhandsome in its severe simplicity.\r\n\r\nThere came sounds from inside of deep, hoarse voices muttering prayers,\r\nthe tinkling of bells and clanging of cymbals. From time to time a drum\r\nwas beaten, giving a hollow sound, and an occasional and sudden touch\r\nupon a gong caused the air to vibrate until the notes in a gradual\r\ndiminuendo were carried away over the holy lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n     Entering the Lamasery--The Lama\'s dwelling--Novices--Were we in a\r\n     trap?--Images--Oblations--Urghin--The holy water, the veil of\r\n     friendship, and absolution--Musical instruments, books, &c.--God\r\n     and the Trinity--Heaven and hell--A mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Chanden Sing and I had entered into the Lamasery, the large door,\r\nwhich had been pushed wide open, was immediately closed. We were in a\r\nspacious courtyard, three sides of which had two tiers of galleries\r\nsupported by columns. This was the _Lhaprang_, or Lama\'s house, and\r\ndirectly in front of me was the _Lha Kang_, or temple, the floor of which\r\nwas raised some five feet above the level of the ground, with a very\r\nlarge door leading into it. At this entrance were, one on either side,\r\nrecesses in which, by the side of a big drum, squatted two Lamas with\r\nbooks of prayers before them, a praying-wheel and a rosary in their\r\nhands, the beads of which they shifted after every prayer. At our\r\nappearance the monks ceased their prayers and beat the drums in an\r\nexcited manner. From what I could judge, there was a commotion in the\r\nGomba. Lamas, old and young, rushed to and fro out of their rooms, while\r\na number of Chibbis or novices--boys between the ages of twelve and\r\ntwenty--lined the banisters of the upper verandah with expressions of\r\nevident suspense and curiosity depicted on their faces. No doubt the\r\nLamas had prepared a trap for us. I warned Chanden Sing to be on the\r\nalert, and set him on guard at the entrance of the temple, while I,\r\ndepositing a few silver coins on the drum of the Lama to my right, took\r\noff my shoes in sign of respect and--much to the amazement of the\r\nmonks--quietly entered the house of worship. Partly astonished at the\r\nsight of the silver, and more so at my want of caution, the Lamas, of\r\nwhom there was a good number in the courtyard, remained motionless and\r\nmute. The high Lama, or Father Superior of the monastery, at last came\r\nforward, stooping low and placing one thumb above the other and putting\r\nhis tongue out to show his superlative approval of my visit to the many\r\nimages representing deities or sanctified Buddhist heroes which were\r\ngrouped along the walls of the temple. The largest of these were about\r\nfive feet high, the others about three feet. Some were carved out of\r\nwood, their drapery and ornaments being fairly artistic in arrangement\r\nand execution, while others were fashioned in gilt metal. There were a\r\nnumber in a sitting posture and some standing erect; and they all rested\r\non ornamented pedestals or plainer bases painted blue, red, white and\r\nyellow. Many wore the ancient Chinese double-winged cap, as used to this\r\nday by Corean officials, and were placed in recesses in the wall\r\ndecorated with stuffs, wood carvings, and rough paintings of images.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE TUCKER TEMPLE]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of these images was a long shelf, on which, in bright brass\r\nvessels of all sizes, were oblations of _tsamba_, dried fruit, _chura_,\r\nwheat and rice offered through the Lamas by the devotees to the different\r\nsaints. Some of the ears of barley were ornamented with imitation leaves\r\nof _murr_ (butter), coloured red, blue and yellow.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of the temple was draped in red woollen cloth similar to that\r\nof the clothes worn by the Lamas themselves, and from it hung hundreds of\r\nstrips of silk, wool and cotton of all imaginable colours. The roof was\r\nsupported by columns of wood forming a quadrangle in the centre of the\r\ntemple and joined by a balustrade, compelling the worshippers to make a\r\ncircuit from left to right in order to pass before the several images. In\r\na shrine in the central part of the wall facing the entrance was _Urghin_\r\nor _Kunjuk-chick_, "God alone," and in front of it on a kind of altar\r\ncovered with a carpet a collection of donations far more abundant than\r\nthose offered to the other images.\r\n\r\nThe Lama, pointing at it, told me that it was a good God, and so I\r\nsalaamed it and deposited a small offering in a handy collection-box,\r\nwhich seemed to please the Lama greatly, for he at once fetched a holy\r\nwater amphora, hung with long veils of friendship and love, and poured\r\nsome scented liquid on the palms of my hands. Then, producing a strip of\r\nveil, he wetted it with the scent and presented it to me. The majority of\r\npilgrims generally go round the inside of the temple on their knees, but,\r\nnotwithstanding that, to avoid offending prejudices, I generally follow\r\nthe principle of doing in Rome as the Romans do, I could not here afford\r\nthe chance of placing myself at such a disadvantage in case of a\r\nsurprise. The high Lama explained the different images and threw handfuls\r\nof rice over them as he called them by their respective names, all of\r\nwhich I tried hard to remember, but, alas! before I could get back to the\r\n_serai_ and scribble down their appellations, they had all escaped my\r\nmemory. A separate entrance led from the living part of the monastery\r\ninto the temple.\r\n\r\nLights, burning in brass bowls, their wicks being fed with melted butter,\r\nwere scattered on the floor in the central quadrangle, and near them lay\r\noblong books of prayers printed on the smooth yellow Tibetan paper made\r\nfrom a fibrous bark. Near these books were small drums and cymbals. One\r\ndouble drum, I noticed, was made from reversed sections of human skulls,\r\nand my attention was also attracted by some peculiar headgear worn by the\r\nLamas during their services and ceremonies. On these occasions they not\r\nonly accompany their chanting and prayers with the beating of drums and\r\nclashing of cymbals, but they at the same time make a noise on cane\r\nflutes, tinkle hand-bells, and sound a large gong. The noise of these\r\ninstruments is at times so great that the prayers themselves are quite\r\ninaudible. Unfortunately, I failed to see any of the awe-inspiring masks\r\nwhich are used by Lamas in their eccentric and mystic dances, during\r\nwhich, when the Lamas spend the whole day in the temple, they consume\r\nmuch tea with butter and salt in it, which is brought to them in cups by\r\nLamas of an inferior order, acting as servants. They pass hour after hour\r\nin their temples apparently absolutely absorbed in praying to the God\r\nabove all gods, the incarnation of all the saints together united in a\r\ntrinity, the _Kunjuk-Sum_.\r\n\r\n_Kunjuk-Sum_, translated literally, means "the three deities," and some\r\ntake it to refer to the elements, air, water and fire, which in the\r\nTibetan mind are symbols of speech, charity and force and life. One great\r\npoint in Buddhism, as everyone knows, is the advocation of love and\r\nrespect to one\'s father and mother and the prohibition against injuring\r\none\'s neighbours in any way. According to the precepts contained in some\r\neight hundred volumes called the Kajars, the Tibetans believe in a heaven\r\n(the Deva Tsembo) free from all anxieties of human existence, full of\r\nlove and joy, and ruled over by a god of infinite goodness, helped by\r\ncountless disciples called the _Chanchubs_, who spend their existence in\r\nperforming charitable deeds among living creatures. With a number of\r\nintermediate places of happiness and punishment they even believe in a\r\nhell, where the souls of sinners are tormented by fire and ice.\r\n\r\n"God sees and knows everything, and He is everywhere," exclaimed the\r\nLama, "but we cannot see Him. Only the _Chanchubs_ can see and speak to\r\nHim."\r\n\r\n"What are the evil qualities to be mostly avoided?" I inquired of the\r\nhigh Lama, who spoke a little Hindustani.\r\n\r\n"Luxury, pride and envy," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Do you ever expect to become a saint?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hope so, but it takes five hundred transmigrations of an\r\nuncontaminated soul before one can be one."\r\n\r\nThen, as if waking to a sudden thought, he seized my hand impulsively and\r\nspread my fingers open. Having done this, he muttered two or three words\r\nof surprise. His face became serious, even solemn, and he treated me with\r\nstrange obsequiousness. Rushing out of the temple, he went to inform the\r\nother Lamas of his discovery, whatever it was. They crowded round him,\r\nand from their words and gestures it was easy to see that they were\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the company of the strange idols and came into the courtyard,\r\nevery Lama wished to examine and touch my hand, and the sudden change in\r\ntheir behaviour was to me a source of great curiosity, until I learnt the\r\nreal cause of it some weeks later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n     The Jong Pen\'s statements regarding me--Sects of\r\n     Lamas--Lamaseries--Government allowance--Ignorance of the\r\n     crowds--How Lamas are recruited--Lamas, novices, and\r\n     menials--Dances and hypnotism--Infallibility--Celibacy and\r\n     vice--Sculptors--Prayer-wheels and revolving\r\n     instruments--Nunneries--Human bones for eating vessels and\r\n     musical instruments--Blood-drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE I left the monastery, the Lamas, who had now become more or less\r\naccustomed to me, asked me many questions regarding India and concerning\r\nmedicine. These seemed to be subjects of great interest to them. They\r\nalso questioned me as to whether I had heard that a young sahib had\r\ncrossed over the frontier with a large army, which the Jong Pen of\r\nTaklakot had defeated, beheading the sahib and the principal members of\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nI professed to be ignorant of these facts, and so I really was, though I\r\nnaturally felt much amused at the casual way in which the Jong Pen of\r\nTaklakot had disposed of the bearskin before he had even caught the bear\r\nhimself. The Lamas took me for a Hindoo doctor, owing to the colour of my\r\nface, which was sunburnt and had long remained unwashed, and they thought\r\nthat I was on a pilgrimage of circumambulation round the Mansarowar Lake.\r\nThey appeared anxious to know whether illnesses were cured by occult\r\nsciences in India, or by medicines only. I, who, on the other hand, was\r\nmore interested in getting information than in giving it, turned the\r\nconversation on the Lamas themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course I knew that there are sects of red, yellow, white and black\r\nLamas, the red ones being the older and more numerous throughout the\r\ncountry; next to them come the yellow Lamas, the _Gelupkas_, equally\r\npowerful in political and religious matters, but not quite so numerous;\r\nand, lastly, the white Lamas and the black Lamas, the _Julinba_, who are\r\nthe craftsmen in the monasteries, working at painting, printing, pottery\r\nand ornamentation, besides attending on the other Lamas and making\r\nthemselves useful all round in the capacities of cooks, shepherds,\r\nwater-carriers, writers, and last, but not least, executioners. The\r\nlamaseries are usually very rich, for the Tibetans are a deeply devout\r\nrace, and the Lamas are not backward in learning how to extort money from\r\nthe ignorant worshippers under pretences of all kinds. Besides attending\r\nto their religious functions, the Lamas are traders at large, carrying on\r\na smart money-lending business, and charging a very high interest, which\r\nfalls due every month. If this should remain unpaid, all the property of\r\nthe borrower is confiscated, and if this prove insufficient to repay the\r\nloan the debtor himself becomes a slave to the monastery. It is evident,\r\nfrom the well-fed countenances of the Lamas, that, notwithstanding their\r\noccasional bodily privations, they as a rule do not allow themselves to\r\nsuffer in any way, and no doubt can be entertained as to their leading a\r\nsmooth and comfortable existence of comparative luxury--a condition which\r\nfrequently degenerates into vice and depravity.\r\n\r\nThe larger lamaseries receive a yearly Government allowance, and\r\nconsiderable sums are collected from the oblations of the faithful, while\r\nother moneys are obtained by all sorts of devices which, in any country\r\nless religious than Tibet, would be considered hardly honourable and\r\noften even altogether criminal. To any one acquainted with Tibet, it is a\r\nwell-known fact that, except in the larger towns, nearly all people\r\nbesides brigands and Lamas are absolutely poor, while the monks\r\nthemselves and their agents live and prosper on the fat of the land. The\r\nmasses are maintained in complete ignorance, and seldom is a layman found\r\nwho can write or even read. Thus everything has to go through the Lamas\'\r\nhands before it can be sanctioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUCKER VILLAGE AND GOMBA]\r\n\r\nThe lamaseries and the Lamas, and the land and property belonging to\r\nthem, are absolutely free from all taxes and dues, and each Lama or\r\nnovice is supported for life by an allowance of _tsamba_, bricks of tea,\r\nand salt. They are recruited from all ranks, and whether honest folks or\r\nmurderers, thieves or swindlers, all are eagerly welcomed on joining the\r\nbrotherhood. One or two male members of each family in Tibet take\r\nmonastic orders, and by these means the monks obtain a great hold over\r\neach house- or tent-hold. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that in\r\nTibet half the male population are Lamas.\r\n\r\nIn each monastery are found Lamas, Chibbis, and a lower grade of ignorant\r\nand depraved Lamas, slaves, as it were, of the higher order. They dress,\r\nand have clean-shaven heads like their superiors, and do all the\r\nhandiwork of the monastery; but they are mere servants, and take no\r\ndirect, active part in the politics of the Lama Government. The Chibbis\r\nare novices. They enter the lamasery when very young, and remain students\r\nfor many years. They are constantly under the teaching and supervision of\r\nthe older ones, and confession is practised from inferior to superior.\r\nAfter undergoing, successfully, several examinations they become\r\neffective Lamas, which word translated means "high priest." These Chibbis\r\ntake minor parts in the strange religious ceremonies in which the Lamas,\r\ndisguised in skins and ghastly masks, sing and dance with extraordinary\r\ncontortions to the accompaniment of weird music made by bells, horns,\r\nflutes, cymbals and drums.\r\n\r\nEach large monastery has at its head a Grand Lama, not to be confounded\r\nwith the Dalai Lama of Lhassa, who is believed, or rather supposed, to\r\nhave an immortal soul transmigrating successively from one body into\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas eat, drink and sleep together in the monastery, with the\r\nexception of the Grand Lama, who has a room to himself. For one moon in\r\nevery twelve they observe a strict seclusion, which they devote to\r\npraying, and during which time they are not allowed to speak. They fast\r\nfor twenty-four hours at a time, with only water and butter-tea, eating\r\non fast-days sufficient food only to remain alive, and depriving\r\nthemselves of everything else, including snuff and spitting, the two most\r\ncommon habits among Tibetan men.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas have great pretensions to infallibility, and on account of this\r\nthey claim, and obtain, the veneration of the people, by whom they are\r\nsupported, fed and clothed. I found them, as a rule, very intelligent,\r\nbut inhuman, barbarously cruel and dishonourable, and this was not my own\r\nexperience alone: I heard the same from the overridden natives, who wish\r\nfor nothing better than a chance to shake off their yoke.\r\n\r\nAvailing themselves of the absolute ignorance in which they succeed in\r\nkeeping the people, the Lamas practise to a great extent occult arts, by\r\nwhich they profess to cure illnesses, discover murders and thefts, stop\r\nrivers from flowing, and bring storms about at a moment\'s notice.\r\nCertain exorcisms, they say, drive away the evil spirits that cause\r\ndisease. It is certain that the Lamas are adepts at hypnotic experiments,\r\nby which means they contrive to let the subjects under their influence\r\nsee many things and objects that are not there in reality. To this power\r\nare due the frequent reports of apparitions of Buddha, seen generally by\r\nsingle individuals, and the visions of demons, the accounts of which\r\nalone terrify the simple-minded folk, and cause them to pay all their\r\nspare cash in donations to the monastery.\r\n\r\nMesmerism plays an important part in their weird dances, during which\r\nextraordinary contortions are performed, and strange positions assumed,\r\nthe body of the dancer being eventually reduced to a cataleptic state, in\r\nwhich it remains for a great length of time.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas swear to celibacy when they enter a lamasery; but they do not\r\nalways keep these vows, and they are besides addicted to the most\r\ndisgusting of all vices in its very worst forms, which accounts for the\r\nrepulsive appearance of far-gone depravity so common among the\r\nmiddle-aged Lamas.\r\n\r\nAll the larger lamaseries support one or more Lama sculptors, who travel\r\nall over the district, and go to the most inaccessible spots to carve on\r\nrocks, stones, or pieces of horn, the everlasting inscription, "_Omne\r\nmani padme hun_," which one sees all over the country. Unseen, I once\r\nsucceeded, after much difficulty and discomfort, in carrying away two of\r\nthese very heavy inscribed stones, which are still in my possession, and\r\nof which reproductions are here given.\r\n\r\nWeird and picturesque places, such as the highest points on mountain\r\npasses, gigantic boulders, rocks near the sources of rivers, or any spot\r\nwhere a _mani_ wall exists, are the places most generally selected by\r\nthese artists to engrave the magic formula alluding to the reincarnation\r\nof Buddha from a lotus flower.\r\n\r\nThe famous prayer-wheels, those mechanical contrivances by which the\r\nTibetans pray to their god by means of water, wind and hand-power, are\r\nalso manufactured by Lama artists. The larger ones, moved by water, are\r\nconstructed by the side of, or over, a stream, and the huge cylinders on\r\nwhich the entire Tibetan prayer-book is inscribed are revolved by the\r\nflowing water. The wheels moved by wind-power are similar to those used\r\nby the Shokas, which I have already described, but the Tibetans often\r\nhave prayers printed on the slips of cloth. The smaller prayer-wheels,\r\nrevolved by hand, are of two different kinds, and are made either of\r\nsilver or copper. Those for home use are cylinders, about six inches\r\nhigh. Inside these revolve on pivots, on the principle of a spinning top,\r\nthe rolls of prayers which, by means of a projecting knob above the\r\nmachine, the worshipper sets in motion. The prayers can be seen revolving\r\ninside through a square opening in the cylinder. The more universal\r\nprayer-wheel in everyday use in Tibet is, however, of the pattern shown\r\nin the illustration. It is usually constructed of copper, sometimes of\r\nbrass, and frequently entirely or partly of silver. The cylinder has two\r\nmovable lids, between which the prayer-roll fits tightly. A handle with\r\nan iron rod is passed through the centre of the cylinder and roll, and is\r\nkept in its place by means of a knob. A ring, encircling the cylinder,\r\nattaches it to a short chain and weight; this serves, when started by a\r\njerk of the hand, to give a rotatory movement, which must, according to\r\nrule, be from left to right, and which is kept up indefinitely, the words\r\n"_Omne mani padme hun_," or simply "_Mani, mani_," being repeated all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE WITH INSCRIPTION]\r\n\r\nThe more ancient wheels have the prayers written by hand instead of\r\nprinted, and are contained in a small black bag. Charms, such as rings of\r\nmalachite, jade, bone, or silver, are often attached to the weight and\r\nchain by which the rotary movement is given to the wheel. These\r\npraying-machines are found in every Tibetan family, and nearly every\r\nLama possesses one. They keep them jealously, and it is very difficult to\r\nget the real ones. I was particularly fortunate, and during my journey in\r\nTibet I was able to purchase as many as twelve, two of which were\r\nextremely old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAYER-WHEELS--ANCIENT AND MODERN. SHOWING ROLLS OF\r\nPRAYERS TO GO INSIDE]\r\n\r\nBesides the rosary, which the Lamas always use in a similar way to the\r\nRoman Catholics, they have a brass instrument which they twist between\r\nthe palms of their hands while saying prayers, and this is used\r\nexclusively by Lamas. It is from 21/2 to 3 inches in length, and is rounded\r\nso as to be easily held in the hollow of the two hands.\r\n\r\nIn Tibet, as in other Buddhist countries, there are nunneries besides\r\nlamaseries. The nuns, most unattractive in themselves, shave their heads\r\nand practise witchcraft and magic, just as the Lamas do. They are looked\r\ndown upon by the masses. In some of these nunneries strict _clausura_ is\r\nenforced, but in most of them the Lamas are allowed free access, with the\r\nusual result, that the nuns become the concubines of the Lamas. Even\r\napart from this, the women of the nunneries are quite as immoral as their\r\nbrethren of the lamaseries, and at their best they are but a low type of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas who, at certain periods of the year, are allowed an unusual\r\namount of freedom with women, are those who practise the art of making\r\nmusical instruments and eating-vessels out of human bones. The skull is\r\nused for making drinking-cups, _tsamba_ bowls, and single and double\r\ndrums, and the humerus, femur, and tibia bones are turned into trumpets\r\nand pipes. These particular Lamas are said to relish human blood, which\r\nthey drink out of the cups made from men\'s skulls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE WITH INSCRIPTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n     Illnesses and remedies--Curious theories about fever--Evil\r\n     spirits--Blacksmith and dentist--Exorcisms--Surgical\r\n     operations--Massage and cupping--Incurable\r\n     illnesses--Deformities--Deafness--Fits and\r\n     insanity--Melancholia--Suicides.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Lamas became quite communicative, enabling me, partly with the little\r\nHindustani that I knew and partly with the Tibetan I had picked up, to\r\nenter into a conversation about illnesses and their remedies, certain as\r\nI was that they must have strange notions on the subject. I was not\r\ndisappointed in this surmise, and from that conversation and my own\r\nobservation on previous and subsequent occasions, I am able to give a few\r\ndetails of the methods of the Lamas in curing the more frequent ailments\r\nfound in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas explained to me that all diseases arose from fever, instead of\r\nfever being an accompaniment of most illnesses, and furthermore, that\r\nfever itself was but an evil spirit, which assumed different forms when\r\nit entered the body, and caused all sorts of complaints. The fever demon,\r\nthey asserted, was a spirit, but there were yet other demons who were so\r\ngood as to bring us riches and happiness. For instance, when a man after\r\na dangerous illness visited a a cave, waterfall or river-gorge which\r\nthese demons were supposed to haunt, he might have a relapse and die, or\r\nhe might be instantly cured and live happy ever afterwards. In the latter\r\ncase, as would naturally be expected, the recipient of such inestimable\r\nprivileges generally returned to pay a second visit to the kindly spirits\r\nwho made his life worth living, "but," said the Lamas quite seriously,\r\n"when he goes a second time he will get blind or paralytic, as a\r\npunishment for his greediness."\r\n\r\n"The evil spirits," continued a fat old Lama with crooked fingers, which\r\nhe clenched and shook as he spoke, "are in the shape of human beings or\r\nlike goats, dogs, sheep or ponies, and sometimes they assume the\r\nsemblance of wild animals, such as bears and snow leopards."\r\n\r\nI told the Lamas that I had remarked many cases of goitre and also other\r\nabnormalities, such as hare-lip and webbed fingers and toes, as well as\r\nthe very frequent occurrence of supernumerary fingers or toes. I asked\r\nthem the reason for such cases, and they attributed them, with the\r\nexception of webbed fingers, to the mischievous work of demons before the\r\nchild\'s birth; they could not, however, suggest a remedy for goitre.\r\n\r\nInguinal and umbilical hernia are quite common, as I have on several\r\noccasions observed, and coarse belts are made according to the taste and\r\ningenuity of the sufferer, but are of hardly any efficacy in preventing\r\nthe increase of the swellings.\r\n\r\nA common complaint, especially among the older women, was rheumatism,\r\nfrom which they seemed to suffer considerably. It affected their fingers\r\nand toes, and particularly the wrists and ankles, the joints swelling so\r\nas to render them quite stiff, the tendons contracting, swelling, and\r\nbecoming prominent and hard in the palms of the hands.\r\n\r\nBoth before and after my conversation with the Lamas I had opportunities\r\nof ascertaining that the stomachs of the Tibetans are seldom in good\r\nworking order. But how could they be when you consider the gallons of\r\nfilthy tea which they drink daily, and the liquor to which they are so\r\npartial? This poisonous concoction is enough to destroy the gastric\r\njuices of an ostrich! The tongue, as I have mentioned already, is\r\ninvariably thickly furred with a whitish coating, and Tibetans have often\r\ncomplained to me of tumours as well as of painful burnings in the\r\nstomach, the latter undoubtedly caused by ulcerations. It is to be\r\nregretted that, even in the high land of Tibet, the worst of all sexual\r\ndiseases (called by the Tibetans _Boru_) has made vast numbers of\r\nvictims, palpable traces of it showing themselves in eruptions,\r\nparticularly on the forehead and on the ears, round the mouth and under\r\nthe nostrils, on the arms and legs. In cases of very long standing, a\r\npeculiar whitish discoloration of the skin and gums was to be noticed,\r\nwith abnormal contraction of the pupils. That such a disease is well\r\nrooted in the country we have proof enough in the foul teeth which the\r\nmajority of Tibetans possess. In nearly all cases that I examined, the\r\nteeth were, even in young men, so loose, decayed and broken as to make me\r\nfeel quite sorry for their owners, and during the whole time I was in\r\nTibet--and I came in contact with several thousand people--I believe that\r\nI could almost count on my fingers the sets of teeth that appeared quite\r\nregular, healthy and strong. As a rule, too, the women had better teeth\r\nthan the men. No doubt the admixture of bad blood in the Tibetan race\r\ncontributes a great deal to the unevenness and malformation of their\r\nteeth, and if we add to this the fact that the corruption of the blood,\r\neven apart from disease, is very great owing to their peculiar laws of\r\nmarriage, it is not surprising that the services of dentists are\r\neverywhere required. The teeth of Tibetans are generally of such a\r\nbrittle nature that the dentist of Tibet--usually a Lama and a blacksmith\r\nas well--has devised an ingenious way of protecting them from further\r\ndestruction by means of a silver cap encasing the broken tooth. I once\r\nsaw a man with all his front teeth covered in this fashion, and as the\r\ndentist who had attended to him had constructed the small cases\r\napparently with no regard to shape or comfort, but had made most of them\r\nend in a point for mastication\'s sake, the poor man had a ghastly\r\nappearance every time that he opened his mouth. The Tibetans are not very\r\nsensitive to physical pain, as I have had reason to judge on several\r\noccasions, when I have seen teeth extracted in the most primitive\r\nfashion, without a sound being emitted from the sufferer.\r\n\r\nIn South-Western Tibet the _Hunyas_ (Tibetans) have the same strange\r\nnotions on transmigration of evil spirits that are common to the Shokas.\r\nFor instance, if a man falls ill, they maintain that the only remedy is\r\nto drive away the evil spirit which has entered his body. Now, according\r\nto Tibetan and Shoka ideas, evil spirits always enter a living body to\r\nsatisfy their craving for blood: therefore, to please the spirit and\r\ndecoy him away, if the illness be slight, a small animal such as a dog or\r\na bird is brought and placed close by the patient; if the illness be\r\ngrave, a sheep is produced and exorcisms are made in the following\r\nfashion. A bowl of water is whirled three or four times over the sick\r\nman\'s head, and then again over the animal selected, upon whose head it\r\nis poured. These circles, described with certain mystic words, have the\r\npower of drawing the spirit out of its first quarters and causing it to\r\nenter the brain of the second victim, upon whose skull the water is\r\npoured to prevent its returning back.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said my informer with an air of great gravity, "if you can\r\ngive the evil spirit a present in the shape of a living being that will\r\nsatisfy him, he will depart quite happy." If the illness is slight, it\r\nmeans that the spirit is not much out of temper, and a small present is\r\nenough to satisfy him, but if the disease is serious, nothing less than a\r\nsheep or even a yak will be sufficient. As soon as the spirit has changed\r\nhis temporary abode the animal is quickly dragged away to a crossing of\r\nfour roads, and if there are no roads a cross is previously drawn on the\r\nground, where a grave for the animal is dug, into which it is mercilessly\r\nthrown and buried alive. The spirit, unable to make a rapid escape,\r\nremains to suck the blood of his last victim, and in the meantime the\r\nsick man, deprived of the company of his ethereal and unwelcome guest,\r\nhas time to make a speedy recovery. When a smaller animal is used, such\r\nas a dog or a bird, and when the patient complains of more than one\r\nailment, the poor beast, having been conveyed to the crossing of four\r\nroads, is suddenly seized and brutally torn into four parts, which are\r\nflung in four different directions, the idea being that, wherever there\r\nmay be spirits waiting for blood, they will get their share and depart\r\nhappy. After their craving is satisfied, the evil spirits are not very\r\nparticular whether the blood is human or not. In Shoka land especially,\r\nbranches with thorns and small flying prayers are placed on each road to\r\nprevent their immediate return. These are said to be insuperable barriers\r\nto the evil spirits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH WITH THORNS TO PREVENT RETURN OF EVIL SPIRITS]\r\n\r\nWhen a patient completely recovers, the Lamas naturally obtain money for\r\nthe exorcisms which have expelled the illness, and they never fail to\r\nimpress upon the people the extraordinary powers they possess over the\r\nmuch-dreaded demons.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans are unsuccessful in surgery, first of all because they do\r\nnot possess sufficient knowledge of human anatomy; secondly, because\r\ntheir fingers are wanting in suppleness and sensitiveness of touch; and\r\nlastly, because they are not able to manufacture instruments of\r\nsufficient sharpness to perform surgical operations with speed and\r\ncleanliness. In Tibet everybody is a surgeon, thus woe to the unfortunate\r\nwho needs one. It is true that amputation is seldom performed; but if it\r\nshould become necessary, and the operation is at all difficult, the\r\npatient generally succumbs. The Tibetan surgeon does not know how to saw\r\nbones, and so merely severs the limb at the place where the fracture has\r\noccurred. The operation is performed with any knife or dagger that\r\nhappens to be at hand, and is, therefore, attended with much pain, and\r\nfrequently has disastrous results. The precaution is taken to tie up the\r\nbroken limb above the fracture, but it is done in such a clumsy way that\r\nvery often, owing to the bad quality of Tibetan blood, mortification sets\r\nin, and, as the Tibetans are at a loss what to do on such occasions,\r\nanother victim goes to join the majority.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nomadic habits of the Tibetans and the rough life they\r\nlead, they are comparatively immune from very bad accidents. Occasionally\r\nthere is a broken arm or leg which they manage to set roughly, if the\r\nfracture is not a compound one, by putting the bones back in their right\r\nposition, and by tightly bandaging the limbs with rags, pieces of cloth\r\nand rope. Splinters are used when wood is obtainable. A powder made from\r\na fungus growing on oak-trees in the Himahlyas is imported and used by\r\nthe Tibetans near the frontier. A thick layer of it, when wet, is rubbed\r\nand left upon the broken limb, over which the bandaging is afterwards\r\ndone. In a healthy person, a simple fracture of the leg, which by chance\r\nhas been properly set, takes from twenty to thirty days to heal, after\r\nwhich the patient can begin moving about; and a broken arm does not\r\nrequire to be kept in a sling more than fifteen or twenty days. If these\r\ncures are somewhat more rapid than with our more civilised methods of\r\nbone-setting, it is merely due to the wholesome climate and the fact that\r\nthe natives spend most of their days out in the open air and in the sun,\r\nundoubtedly the best cure for any complaint of that kind; but, of course,\r\nit is but seldom that the bones are joined properly, and they generally\r\nremain a deformity. More satisfactory results are obtained with cases of\r\ndislocations by pulling the bones into their right position.\r\n\r\nIn case of wounds the bleeding is arrested by the application of a wet\r\nrag tightly bound over the wound. In most cases of unbandaged wounds that\r\ncame under my notice the process of healing was a very slow one, the\r\ngreat changes in the temperature between night and day often causing them\r\nto open of themselves. They made good headway towards recovery in the\r\nbeginning, but the skin was very slow in joining and re-forming.\r\n\r\nBurns are treated by smearing butter over them; and a poultice of\r\nrhubarb is used to send down swellings of contusions as well as for the\r\npurpose of bringing boils, from which the Tibetans suffer much, to a\r\nspeedy maturation.\r\n\r\nAconite is given for fever and rheumatism, and a rough kind of massage is\r\nused to allay pain in the muscles of limbs. It is generally done by the\r\nwomen, who, as far as I could judge, practised it with no real knowledge\r\nbut merely contented themselves with violent rubbing and pinching and\r\nthumping until signs of relief appeared on the sufferer\'s face. Whether,\r\nhowever, these manifestations were due to actual soothing of pain, or to\r\nthe prospect of the masseuse bringing her treatment to an end, I could\r\nnever properly ascertain. Tibetan fingers are not well adapted for such\r\nwork, being clumsy and, compared with those of other Asiatic races, quite\r\nstiff and hard.\r\n\r\nCupping is adopted with success. Three or four small incisions are made\r\nclose to one another and a conical cupping-horn about seven inches long,\r\nhaving a tiny hole at its point, is applied over them. The operator then\r\nsucks through this small aperture until the horn is full of blood, when\r\nit is removed and the operation begun again. With poisoned wounds the\r\nsucking is done by applying the lips to the wound itself.\r\n\r\nBleeding is used as a remedy for bruises and swellings, and for internal\r\npain, also for acute attacks of rheumatism and articular pains. If it is\r\nnot sufficient, the branding cure is resorted to, and if this should also\r\nfail, then the tinder cones, to be described later on, come into play\r\nand, the seat of the pain being encircled with them, they are set alight.\r\nWhen even this remedy proves inefficacious, and the patient survives it,\r\nthe illness is pronounced incurable!\r\n\r\nNatural abnormalities and deformities are frequent enough in Tibet, and\r\nsome came under my notice in nearly every camp I entered. Deformities of\r\nthe spine were common, such as displacement of the shoulder-blades; and I\r\nsaw during my stay in Tibet many cases of actually humpbacked people.\r\nThere were frequent cases, too, of crookedness of the legs, and clubfoot\r\nwas not rare, while one constantly met with webbed fingers and\r\nsupernumerary fingers and toes, as well as the absence of one or more of\r\nthem. Malformations of the skull, such as the two sides being of marked\r\nunequal shape or an abnormal distance between the eye sockets, were the\r\ntwo most common deformities that came under my notice.\r\n\r\nThe ears of men of the better classes were much elongated artificially\r\nby the constant wearing of heavy earrings, which sometimes even tore the\r\nlobe of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent and curious of all was the extreme swelling of\r\nchildren\'s stomachs, caused by the umbilical cord not being properly tied\r\nat birth. The operation was generally performed by the mother and father\r\nof the newly-born or by some friend at hand. The infants had such\r\nenormous paunches that in some cases they were hardly able to stand; but,\r\nas they grew older, the swelling seemed to gradually abate and the body\r\nassumed its normal shape.\r\n\r\nDeafness was common, but I never came across any dumb people, though I\r\nnow and then encountered cases of painful stammering and other defects of\r\narticulation arising from malformation of the palate and tongue.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however, the difficulty of speech was caused by dementia,\r\nwhich seemed very common in Tibet, especially among the young men.\r\nWhether it was caused by cardiac affection subsequent to organic vices,\r\nas I suspected, or by other trouble, I could not say for certain, but\r\npresently I based my suspicions on certain facts which I happened to\r\nnotice, besides the presence of symptoms indicating great nervous\r\ndepression and strain, extreme weakness of the spine and oscillations of\r\nthe hands when spread horizontally with the fingers and thumbs wide\r\napart. This may in one way be accounted for by the difficulty that men\r\nhave in obtaining wives, owing to the scarcity of women. Apoplectic and\r\nepileptic fits and convulsions were not of very frequent occurrence, but\r\nthey seemed severe when they did occur. The fire cure was usually applied\r\nin order to drive away the spirits that were supposed to have entered the\r\nbody, but, all the same, these fits at times resulted in temporary or\r\noccasionally permanent paralysis, and much derangement and disfiguration\r\nof the facial expression, particularly about the eyes and mouth. I had\r\noccasion to study three very good specimens of this kind at Tucker, at\r\nTarbar, north of the Brahmaputra River, and at Tokchim.\r\n\r\nMuch to my regret I never came across any violent cases of insanity\r\nduring my stay in the country, though many times I observed strange\r\npeculiarities among the men, and signs of mania, more particularly\r\nreligious.\r\n\r\nIn women I several times noticed symptoms of melancholia, caused no doubt\r\nby abuse of sexual intercourse, owing to their strange laws of polyandry.\r\nI was told that occasionally it led to suicide by drowning or\r\nstrangulation. However, I was never able to keep any of the suspicious\r\ncases under close observation for any length of time, and, as our arrival\r\ninto Tibetan camps generally created some amount of fear and sensation,\r\nand we usually left before they could be quite at home with us, I never\r\nhad a chance of studying the subject more closely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOKCHIM TARJUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n     A Tibetan medicine-man--Lumbago, and a startling cure for\r\n     it--Combustible fuses--Fire and butter--Prayers, agony, and\r\n     distortions--Strange ideas on medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE as the Tibetan remedies seemed to be, none came up, as far as\r\ninterest went, to one I saw applied at a place called Kutzia. I had\r\nentered a camp of some twenty or thirty tents, when my attention was\r\ndrawn to an excited crowd collected round an old man whose garments had\r\nbeen removed. He was tightly bound with ropes, and agony was depicted on\r\nhis features. A tall, long-haired man with red coat and heavy boots knelt\r\nby the side of the sufferer and prayed fervently, twirling round a\r\nprayer-wheel which he held in his right hand.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity aroused, I approached the gathering, whereupon three or four\r\nTibetans got up and signed to me to be off. I pretended not to\r\nunderstand, and, after a heated discussion, I was allowed to remain.\r\n\r\nAn operation was obviously being performed by a Tibetan medicine-man, and\r\nthe suspense in the crowd round the sick man was considerable. The doctor\r\nwas busy preparing combustible fuses, which he wrapped up carefully in\r\nsilk paper. When cut in the centre they formed two cones, each with a\r\nlittle tail of twisted paper protruding beyond its summit. Having\r\ncompleted six or eight of these, the medicine-man made his patient, or\r\nrather his victim, assume a sitting posture. I inquired what ailed the\r\nsick man. From what they told me, and from an examination made on my own\r\naccount, I was satisfied that the man was suffering from an attack of\r\nlumbago. The coming cure, however, interested me more than the illness\r\nitself, and the doctor, seeing how absorbed I was in the performance,\r\nasked me to sit by his side. First of all the man called for "fire," and\r\na woman handed him a blazing brand from a fire near by. He swung it to\r\nand fro in the air, and pronounced certain exorcisms. Next the patient\r\nwas subjected to a thorough examination, giving vent to a piercing yell\r\neach time that the long bony fingers of the physician touched his sides,\r\nwhereupon the man of science, pointing to the spot, informed his\r\nopen-mouthed audience that the pain was "there." Putting on a huge pair\r\nof spectacles, he rubbed with the palm of his hand the umbilical region\r\nof the sufferer and then measured with folded thumb two inches on each\r\nside of, and slightly under, the umbilicus. To mark these distances he\r\nused the burning brand, applying it to the flesh at these points.\r\n\r\n"_Murr, murr!_" ("Butter, butter!") he next called for, and butter was\r\nproduced. Having rubbed a little on the burns, he placed upon each of\r\nthem a separate cone, and pressed until it remained a fixture, the point\r\nupwards. Shifting the beads of a rosary, revolving the praying-wheel, and\r\nmuttering prayers, the medicine-man now worked himself into a perfect\r\nfrenzy. He stared at the sun, raising his voice from a faint whisper to a\r\nthundering baritone at its loudest, and his whole audience seemed so\r\naffected by the performance that they all shook and trembled and prayed\r\nin their terror. He now again nervously clutched the burning wood in one\r\nhand, and, blowing upon it with the full strength of his lungs, produced\r\na flame. The excitement in the crowd became intense. Every one, head down\r\nto the ground, prayed fervently. The doctor waved the ignited wood three\r\nor four times in the air and then applied the flames to the paper tips of\r\nthe combustible cones. Apparently saltpetre and sulphur had been mixed in\r\nthe preparation of these. They burned fast, making a noise like the fuse\r\nof a rocket.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the animation of the onlookers was not to be compared\r\nwith the agitation of the patient, who began to feel the effects of this\r\nprimitive remedy. The fire spluttered on his bare skin. The cure was\r\ndoing its work. The wretched man\'s mouth foamed, and his eyes bulged out\r\nof their sockets. He moaned and groaned, making desperate efforts to\r\nunloose the bonds that kept his hands fast behind his back. Two stalwart\r\nmen sprang forward and held him, while the medicine-man and all the women\r\npresent, leaning over the prostrate form, blew with all their might upon\r\nwhat remained of the three smoking cones frizzling away into the flesh of\r\nthe wretched victim.\r\n\r\nThe pain of which the man complained seemed to encircle his waist,\r\nwherefore the strange physician, having untied his patient\'s arms from\r\nbehind, and retied them in front, began his measurements again, this time\r\nfrom the spinal column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MEDICINE-MAN]\r\n\r\n"_Chik, ni, sum!_" ("One, two, three!") he exclaimed, as he marked the\r\nthree spots in the same fashion as before, smeared them over with butter,\r\nand affixed the cones. Here ensued a repetition of the previous\r\nexcitement; prayers, agony, and distortions, but the patient was not\r\nthoroughly cured, and more cones were subsequently ignited on both his\r\nsides, in spite of his protests and my appeals on his behalf. The poor\r\nfellow soon had a regular circle of severe burns round his body.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, when, two hours later, the operation was over, the sick\r\nman had become a dying man. With a view to obtaining a few hints on\r\nTibetan medicine from this eminent physician--the Tibetans held him in\r\ngreat esteem--I sent him a small present and requested him to visit me.\r\nHe was flattered and showed no desire to keep his methods a secret, but\r\neven pressed me to try some of his unique remedies.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, fire would cure most illnesses; what fire could not\r\ncure, water would. He had, nevertheless, some small packets of variously\r\ncoloured powders, for which he claimed extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid your patient will die," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"He may," was the reply, "but it will be the fault of the patient, not\r\nthe cure. Besides, what does it matter whether you die to-day or\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\nAnd with this unprofessional dictum he left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\n     Tucker village--Chokdens--Houses--Flying prayers--Soldiers or\r\n     robbers?--A stampede--Fresh\r\n     provisions--Disappointment--Treachery--Shokas leave\r\n     me--Observations--Five men, all counted!\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN I left the Gomba, having been salaamed to the ground by my new\r\nfriends the Lamas, I walked about the village to examine all there was to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nAlong the water\'s edge stood a number of dilapidated Chokdens made of mud\r\nand stones, with a square base surmounted by a moulding, and an upper\r\ndecoration in steps, topped by a cylindrical column. They were in a row\r\nat the east end of the village, and, as is well known, they are supposed\r\nto contain a piece of bone, cloth or metal, and books or parts of them,\r\nthat had once belonged to a great man or a saint. Roughly drawn images\r\nare occasionally found in them. In rare cases, when cremation has been\r\napplied, the ashes are collected into a small earthenware urn, and\r\ndeposited in one of the Chokdens. The ashes are usually made into a paste\r\nwith clay, on which, when flattened like a medallion, a representation of\r\nBuddha is either stamped from a mould, or engraved by means of a pointed\r\ntool.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the houses at Tucker was no more pleasing than the\r\nexterior. Each habitation had a walled courtyard, and the top of the\r\nwall, as well as the edge of the flat roof, was lined with masses of\r\ntamarisk for fuel. In the courtyard, sheep and goats were penned at\r\nnight; and the human beings who occupied the rooms were dirty beyond all\r\ndescription. There were hundreds of flying prayers over the monastery as\r\nwell as over each house, and as the people stood on their roofs watching\r\nus, laughing and chatting, the place had quite a gay aspect.\r\n\r\nWhile I was strolling about some fifty or sixty men appeared on the\r\nscene, armed with matchlocks and swords, and I looked upon them with\r\nsuspicion, but Kachi reassured me, and said they were not soldiers, but a\r\npowerful band of robbers encamped about half a mile off, and on very\r\nfriendly terms with the Lamas. As a precaution, I loaded my rifle, which\r\nwas quite sufficient to occasion a stampede of the armed crowd, followed,\r\nin the panic, by all the other villagers that had collected round us.\r\nLike all Tibetans, they were a miserable lot, though powerfully built,\r\nand with plenty of bounce about them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANKU GOMBA]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I had made inquiries about provisions, and had\r\narranged for the purchase of two fat sheep and some 450 lbs. of food\r\n(flour, rice, _tsamba, ghur_, sugar, salt and butter), and several\r\nTibetans stated that they could supply me with any quantity I required.\r\nAmong others was a trader from Buddhi, Darcey Bura\'s brother, who\r\npromised to bring me within an hour a sufficient quantity of food to last\r\nus ten men twenty-five days. I noticed, when these men left, that two of\r\nmy Shokas ran after them, and entered into an excited discussion with\r\nthem. Some two or three hours later, the traders returned, swearing that\r\nnot an ounce of food could be obtained in the place. The way in which\r\nthese men could lie was indeed marvellous to study. I suspected\r\ntreachery, and reprimanded my Shokas, threatening to punish them very\r\nseverely if my suspicions proved to be well founded.\r\n\r\nThe Shokas, knowing themselves discovered, and partly through fear of the\r\nTibetans, were now again quite unreasonable and demoralised. It was no\r\nuse keeping them by force and I decided to discharge them. From the\r\nmoment I had entered the forbidden country I had been compelled to\r\nprotect myself against them as much as against the Tibetans. I reflected,\r\nhowever, when I made up my mind to let them go, that these fellows had\r\nstood for my sake hardships and privations which few men could stand; and\r\nin paying them off I therefore rewarded them suitably, and they undertook\r\nto bring back safely across the frontier part of my baggage containing\r\nphotographs, ethnological collections, &c. With infinite trouble I then\r\nmanaged to purchase enough provisions to last five men ten days.\r\n\r\nThe whole party accompanied me three-and-a-quarter miles farther, where,\r\nin sight of the tumble-down Panku Gomba, a mile to the West of us, we\r\nhalted in order to make the necessary arrangements for our parting,\r\nunseen by the Tibetans. I took observations for latitude and longitude.\r\nThe water of the hypsometrical apparatus boiled at 185 deg. Fahr. fifty feet\r\nabove the level of the lake, the temperature of the air being 76 deg. and the\r\nhour 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nWe had a high snowy chain to the South of us, extending from 70 deg. to 33 deg.\r\n(b.m.), the direction of the range being approximately from South-West to\r\nNorth-East, starting at Nimo Namgil.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ready, the five Shokas, including Kachi and Dola,\r\nleft me, swearing by the sun and all that they hold most sacred, that\r\nthey would in no way betray me to the Tibetans, who so far had no\r\nsuspicion as to who I was.\r\n\r\nBijesing the Johari and the Kutial Bura Nattoo agreed to accompany me as\r\nfar as the Maium Pass, so that my party, including myself, now was\r\nreduced to only five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n     The start with a further reduced party--A reconnaissance--Natural\r\n     fortress--Black tents and animals--On the wrong tack--Slings and\r\n     their use--A visit to a Tibetan camp--Mistaken for\r\n     brigands--Bargaining and begging.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL was promising well when, with my reduced party, I started towards the\r\nN.E., first following for three-and-a-quarter miles a course of 49 deg.,[22]\r\nskirting the lake, then ascending over the barren hill ranges in a\r\ndirection of 90 deg. for a distance of twelve miles. The journey was\r\nuneventful, and my four men seemed in the best of spirits. We descended\r\nto a plain where water and grass could be found, and having seen a\r\ncamping-ground with a protecting wall, such as are usually put up by\r\nTibetans at their halting-places, we made ourselves comfortable for the\r\nnight, notwithstanding the high wind and a passing storm of hail and\r\nrain, which drenched us to the skin. The thermometer during the night\r\nwent down to 34 deg..\r\n\r\nAt sunrise I started to make a reconnaissance from the top of a high hill\r\nwherefrom I could get a bird\'s-eye view of a great portion of the\r\nsurrounding country. It was of the utmost importance for me to find out\r\nwhich would be the easiest way to get through the intricate succession of\r\nhills and mountains, and to discover the exact direction of a large river\r\nto the N. of us, throwing itself into the Mansarowar, the name of which\r\nno one could tell me. I started alone towards 352 deg. 30\' (b.m.), and\r\nthree-and-a-half miles\' climb brought me to 16,480 feet on the summit of\r\na hill, where I was able to ascertain and note down all that I wished to\r\nknow. I returned to camp, and we went on towards 73 deg. 30\', crossing over a\r\npass 16,450 feet, and ultimately finding ourselves at the foot of a hill,\r\nthe summit of which resembled a fortress, with flying-prayers flapping\r\nto and fro in the wind. At the foot of the hill were some twenty ponies\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLING]\r\n\r\nWith the aid of my telescope I was able to make sure that what at first\r\nappeared to be a castle was nothing but a work of nature, and that\r\napparently no one was concealed up there. The ponies, however, indicated\r\nthe presence of men, and we had to move cautiously. In fact, rounding the\r\nnext hill, we discerned in the grassy valley below a number of black\r\ntents, two hundred yaks, and about a thousand sheep. We kept well out of\r\nsight behind the hill, and making a long detour, we at last descended in\r\nan extensive valley, in which the river described a semicircle, washing\r\nthe southern hill ranges, where it was joined by a tributary coming from\r\nthe S.E. This tributary at first appeared to me larger than what I\r\nafterwards recognised to be the main stream, so that I followed its\r\ncourse for four miles (92 deg. 30\' b.m.), till I found that it was taking me\r\nin a more southerly direction than I wished, and had to retrace my steps\r\nalong a flattish plateau. Meeting two Tibetan women, I purchased, after\r\nendless trouble, a fat sheep out of a flock they were driving before\r\nthem. These two females carried rope slings in their hands, and the\r\naccuracy with which they could fling stones and hit the mark at very\r\ngreat distances was really marvellous. For the sake of a few annas they\r\ngave an exhibition of their skill, hitting any sheep you pointed at in\r\ntheir flock, even at distances of thirty and forty yards. I tried to\r\nobtain from these dangerous females a little information about the\r\ncountry, but they professed absolute ignorance.\r\n\r\n"We are menials," they said, "and we know nothing. We know each sheep in\r\nour flock, and that is all, but our lord, of whom we are the slaves,\r\nknows all. He knows where the rivers come from, and the ways to all\r\nGombas. He is a great king."\r\n\r\n"And where does he live?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"There, two miles off, where that smoke rises to the sky."\r\n\r\nThe temptation was great to go and call on this "great king," who knew so\r\nmany things, all the more so as we might probably persuade him to sell us\r\nprovisions, which, as we had none too many, would be of great assistance\r\nto us. Anyhow the visit would be interesting, and I decided to risk it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NATURAL CASTLE]\r\n\r\nWe steered towards the several columns of smoke that rose before us, and\r\neventually we approached a large camp of black tents. Our appearance\r\ncaused a good deal of commotion, and men and women rushed in and out of\r\ntheir tents in great excitement.\r\n\r\n"_Jogpas, jogpas!_" ("Brigands! brigands!") somebody in their camp\r\nshouted, and in a moment their matchlocks were made ready, and the few\r\nmen who had remained outside the tents drew their swords, holding them\r\nclumsily in their hands in a way hardly likely to terrify any one.\r\n\r\nTo be taken for brigands was a novel experience for us, and the warlike\r\narray was in strange contrast to the terrified expressions on the faces\r\nof those who stood there armed. In fact, when Chanden Sing and I walked\r\nforward and encouraged them to sheathe their steels and put their\r\nmatchlocks by, they readily followed our advice, and brought out rugs for\r\nus to sit upon. Having overcome their fright, they were now most anxious\r\nto be pleasant.\r\n\r\n"_Kiula gunge gozai deva labodu!_" ("You have nice clothes!") I began the\r\nconversation, attempting flattery, to put the chieftain at his ease.\r\n\r\n"_Lasso, leh!_" ( "Yes, sir") answered the Tibetan, apparently\r\nastonished, and looking at his own attire with an air of comical pride.\r\n\r\nHis answer was sufficient to show me that the man considered me his\r\nsuperior, the affirmative in Tibetan to an equal or inferior being the\r\nmere word _lasso_ without the _leh_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN CARRYING CHILD IN BASKET]\r\n\r\n"_Kiula tuku taka zando?_" ("How many children have you?") I rejoined.\r\n\r\n"_Ni_." ("Two.")\r\n\r\n"_Chuwen bogpe, tsamba, chou won[)i]?_" ("Will you sell me flour or\r\n_tsamba?_")\r\n\r\n"_Middu_--have not got any," he replied, making several quick\r\nsemicircular movements with the up-turned palm of his right hand.\r\n\r\nThis is a most characteristic action of the Tibetan, and nearly\r\ninvariably accompanies the word "No," instead of a movement of the head,\r\nas with us.\r\n\r\n"_Keran ga naddoung?_" ("Where are you going?") he asked me eagerly.\r\n\r\n"_Nhgarang ne Koroun!_" ("I am a pilgrim!") "_Lungba quorghen neh\r\njelghen_." ("I go looking at sacred places.")\r\n\r\n"_Gopria zaldo. Chakzal wortzie. Tsamba middu. Bogpe middu, guram middu,\r\ndie middu, kassur middu._" ("I am very poor. Please hear me. I have no\r\n_tsamba_, no flour, no sweet paste, no rice, no dried fruit.")\r\n\r\nThis, of course, I knew to be untrue, so I calmly said that I would\r\nremain seated where I was until food was sold to me, and at the same time\r\nproduced one or two silver coins, the display of which to the covetous\r\neyes of the Tibetans was always the means of hastening the transaction of\r\nbusiness. In small handfuls, after each of which the Tibetans swore that\r\nthey had not another atom to sell, I managed, with somewhat of a trial to\r\nmy patience, to purchase some twenty pounds of food. The moment the money\r\nwas handed over they had a quarrel among themselves about it, and almost\r\ncame to blows, greed and avarice being the most marked characteristic of\r\nthe Tibetans. No Tibetan of any rank is ashamed to beg in the most abject\r\nmanner for the smallest silver coin, and when he sells and is paid, he\r\nalways implores for another coin, to be thrown into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] All bearings given are magnetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n     What the men were like--Their timidity--Leather work--Metal\r\n     work--Blades and swords--Filigree--Saddles and harness--Pack\r\n     saddles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE men of the party were extremely picturesque, with hair flowing down\r\ntheir shoulders and long pigtails ornamented with pieces of red cloth,\r\ncircles of ivory and silver coins. Nearly all had the stereotyped pattern\r\ncoat, with ample sleeves hanging well over the hands, and pulled up at\r\nthe waist to receive the paraphernalia of eating-bowls, snuff-box, &c.,\r\nemployed in daily life. Most of them were dressed in dark red, and all\r\nwere armed with jewelled swords.\r\n\r\nWith flat, broad noses and slits of piercing eyes, high cheek-bones and\r\nskin giving out abundant oily excretions, most of the men stood at a\r\nrespectful distance, scrutinising our faces and watching our movements\r\napparently with much interest. I have hardly ever seen such cowardice and\r\ntimidity as among these big, hulking fellows; to a European it scarcely\r\nseems conceivable. The mere raising of one\'s eyes was sufficient to make\r\na man dash away frightened, and, with the exception of the chief, who\r\npretended to be unafraid, notwithstanding that even he was trembling with\r\nfear, they one and all showed ridiculous nervousness when I approached\r\nthem to examine their clothes or the ornaments they wore round their\r\nnecks, the most prominent of which were the charm-boxes that dangled on\r\ntheir chests. The larger of these charm-boxes contained an image of\r\nBudda, the others were mere brass or silver cases with nothing in them.\r\n\r\nI was struck here, as well as in other camps, by the skill of the\r\nTibetans in working leather, which they tan and prepare themselves, often\r\ngiving to it a fine red or green colour. As a rule, however, the natural\r\ntint is preserved, especially when the leather is used for belts, bullet\r\nand powder-pouches, and flint-and-steel cases. The hair of the skins is\r\nremoved by plucking and scraping, and preference is shown for skins of\r\nthe yak, antelope, and kiang. The Tibetans are masters of the art of\r\nskinning, the hides being afterwards beaten, trodden upon and manipulated\r\nto be rendered soft. There were simple ornamentations stamped upon some\r\nof the leather articles, but in most instances either metal or leather\r\nornaments of various colours were fastened on the belts and pouches, iron\r\nclasps inlaid with silver or silver ones being the commonest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN YOUNG MAN]\r\n\r\nThese metals are found in the country, and the Tibetans smelt and cast\r\nthe ore when sufficient fuel is obtainable for the purpose. Earthen\r\ncrucibles are employed to liquefy the metals, and the castings are made\r\nin clay moulds. For the inlaid work, in which the Tibetans greatly excel,\r\nthey use hammer and chisel. Inlaid ornamentation is frequently to be seen\r\non the sheaths of Tibetan swords, the leaf pattern, varied scrolls and\r\ngeometrical combinations being most commonly preferred. The process of\r\nhardening metals is still in its infancy, and Tibetan blades are of\r\nwrought-iron, and not of steel. They succeed, however, in bringing them\r\nto a wonderful degree of sharpness, although they entirely lack the\r\nelasticity of steel blades. Grooves to let in air, and thus make wounds\r\nincurable, are generally ground in the sides of the daggers, but the\r\nblades of the common swords are perfectly smooth and made to cut on one\r\nside only. As can be seen from the illustrations, these weapons are\r\nhardly adapted to meet the requirements of severe fighting, as they do\r\nnot allow a firm grip, nor have they any guard for the hand. The sheaths\r\nand handles of some of the more valuable swords are made of solid silver\r\ninlaid with turquoises and coral beads, others of silver with gold\r\nornamentations. At Lhassa and at Sigatz (Shigatze), silver filigree\r\ndecorations are used on the best daggers; but nowhere else in Tibet is\r\nfine wire-making practised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWORDS]\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from the above remarks that there are no steel\r\nswords in Tibet, for indeed many fine blades of excellent Chinese steel\r\ncan be seen all over the country in the possession of the richer\r\nofficials, such as the huge two-handed, double-edged swords of Chinese\r\nimportation, used by Tibetan executioners.\r\n\r\nThe saddles, though possibly lacking comfort, are nevertheless skilfully\r\nmade. The frame is made of solid wood (imported) and set in hammered iron\r\n(often inlaid with silver and gold, as in the saddle here reproduced),\r\nwhich, like a Mexican saddle, is very high in front and at the back.\r\nLizard skin or coloured leather is employed to decorate certain parts,\r\nand a pad covers the seat. A rug is, however, invariably placed over this\r\npad for comfort, and the short iron stirrups compel one to sit with legs\r\ndoubled up, a really not uncomfortable position when one gets used to it.\r\nBreastpiece, crupper, bridle and bit are of leather ornamented with\r\ninlaid metal pieces. Double bags for _tsamba_, butter, &c. are fastened\r\nbehind the saddle, together with the inevitable peg and long rope, with\r\nwhich no Tibetan rider is unprovided, for the tethering of his pony at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SADDLE]\r\n\r\nPack-saddles for yaks are made on the same principle, but are of much\r\nrougher construction, as can be judged from the illustrations,[23] in\r\nwhich the two saddles I used on my journey are represented. The baggage\r\nis made fast by means of ropes to the two upper bars. To keep the saddle\r\nin position on the yak, and to prevent sores being inflicted, pads and\r\nblankets are laid upon the animal\'s back. Add to this protection the long\r\ncoat possessed by the beast itself, and it will be clear why it very\r\nseldom sustains the slightest injury from these apparently cruel burdens.\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] See page 223.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n     Rain in torrents--A miserable night--A gorge--A gigantic\r\n     inscription--Sheltered under boulders--A fresh surprise--Only two\r\n     followers left.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN night came on, I did not consider it safe to encamp near the\r\nTibetans. We moved away, driving our yaks before us and dragging the\r\nnewly purchased sheep. We marched two-and-a-half miles, and then halted\r\nin a depression in the ground (16,050 feet), where we had a little\r\nshelter from the wind, which blew with great force. To our right lay a\r\nshort range of fairly high mountains running from North to South, and cut\r\nby a gorge, out of which flowed a large stream. At that time of the\r\nevening we could not hope to cross it, but an attempt might be made in\r\nthe morning, when the cold of the night would have checked the melting of\r\nthe snows. Heavy showers had fallen frequently during the day, and the\r\nmoment the sun went down there was a regular downpour. Our little\r\n_tente-d\'abri_ had been pitched, but we had to clear out of it a couple\r\nof hours later, the small basin in which we had pitched it having been\r\nturned into a regular pond. There was no alternative for us but to come\r\nout into the open, for where the water did not flood us the wind was so\r\nhigh and the ground so moist that it was not possible to keep our tent\r\nup. The pegs would not hold. The hours of the night seemed very long as\r\nwe sat tightly wrapped up in our waterproofs, with feet, hands and ears\r\nfrozen, and the water dripping down upon us. At dawn there were no signs\r\nof the storm abating. We had not been able to light a fire in the\r\nevening, nor could we light one now, and we were cold, hungry and\r\nmiserable. The thermometer had been down to 36 deg.. Towards noon, the rain\r\nstill pouring down in torrents and there being no sign of its clearing,\r\nwe loaded our yaks and entered the gorge between the snow-covered\r\nmountains. With difficulty we crossed the tributary we had so far\r\nfollowed, and then proceeded along the right bank of the main stream to\r\n23 deg. 30", then to 25 deg..\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP WITH GIGANTIC INSCRIPTION]\r\n\r\nWe were so exhausted and wet that, when towards evening we came to an\r\nenormous cliff, on the rocky face of which a patient Lama sculptor had\r\nengraved in gigantic letters the everlasting characters, _Omne mani padme\r\nhun_, we halted. The gorge was very narrow here, and we managed to find a\r\ndry spot under a big boulder, but as there was not sufficient room for\r\nall five, the two Shokas went under the shelter of another rock a little\r\nway off. This seemed natural enough, nor could I anticipate any danger,\r\ntaking care myself of the weapons and the scientific instruments, while\r\nthe Shokas had under their own sheltering boulder the bags containing\r\nnearly all our provisions except tinned meats. The rain pelted all night,\r\nthe wind howled, and again we could not light a fire. The thermometer did\r\nnot fall below 38 deg., but the cold, owing to our drenched condition, seemed\r\nintense. In fact, we were so frozen that we did not venture to eat, but,\r\ncrouching ourselves in the small dry space at our disposal, we eventually\r\nfell fast asleep without tasting food. I slept soundly for the first time\r\nsince I had been in Tibet, and it was broad daylight when I woke up, to\r\nfind the man Nattoo from Kuti, and Bijesing the Johari, departed from\r\nunder their sheltering rock, together with the loads entrusted to them. I\r\ndiscovered their tracks, half washed away, in the direction from which we\r\nhad come the previous night. The rascals had bolted, and there would have\r\nbeen comparatively little harm in that, if only they had not taken with\r\nthem all the stock of provisions for my two Hindoo servants, and a\r\nquantity of good rope, straps, and other miscellaneous articles, which we\r\nwere bound to miss at every turn and which we had absolutely no means of\r\nreplacing.\r\n\r\nOf thirty picked servants who had started with me, twenty-eight had now\r\nabandoned me, and only two remained: faithful Chanden Sing and Mansing\r\nthe leper!\r\n\r\nThe weather continued horrible, with no food for my men and no fuel! I\r\nproposed to the two to go back also and let me continue alone. I\r\ndescribed to them the dangers of following me farther, and warned them\r\nfully, but they absolutely refused to leave me.\r\n\r\n"Sahib, we are not Shokas," were their words. "If you die, we will die\r\nwith you. We fear not death. We are sorry to see you suffer, sahib, but\r\nnever mind us. We are only poor people, therefore it is of no\r\nconsequence."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n     My time fully occupied--Our own yak drivers--A heavy blow--Along\r\n     the stream--Soldiers in pursuit of us--Discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS last disaster should, I suppose, have deterred us from further\r\nprogress, but it somehow made me even more determined to persist than I\r\nwas before. It was no light job to have to run afield oneself to capture\r\nthe yaks, which had wandered off in search of grass; and having found\r\nthem and driven them back to our primitive camping-place, to tie upon\r\ntheir backs the pack-saddles, and fasten on them the heavy tin-lined\r\ncases of scientific instruments and photographic plates. This task was\r\nonly part of the day\'s routine, which included the writing up of my\r\ndiary, the registering of observations, sketching, photographing,\r\nchanging plates in cameras, occasionally developing them, surveying,\r\ncleaning of rifles, revolver, &c. &c. The effort of lifting up the heavy\r\ncases on to the pack-saddles was, owing to our exhausted condition, a\r\nsevere tax on our strength, and the tantalising restlessness of the yaks\r\nforced us to make several attempts before we actually succeeded in\r\nproperly fastening the loads, particularly as we had lost our best pieces\r\nof rope and leather straps. Our sole remaining piece of rope seemed\r\nhardly long enough to make the final knot to one of the girths; anyhow\r\nneither my bearer nor Mansing had sufficient strength to pull and make it\r\njoin; so I made them hold the yak by the horns to keep him steady while I\r\npulled my hardest. I succeeded with a great effort, and was about to get\r\nup, when a terrific blow from the yak\'s horn struck me in the skull an\r\ninch behind my right ear and sent me rolling head over heels. I was\r\nstunned for several moments, and the back of my head was swollen and sore\r\nfor many days, the mark of the blow being visible even now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YAK WITH CASES OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS]\r\n\r\nWe proceeded along the right bank of the river on a course of 85 deg. between\r\nreddish hills and distant high snowy mountains to the N.W. and E.S.E. of\r\nus, which we saw from time to time when the rain ceased and the sky\r\ncleared. The momentary lifting of the clouds would be followed by another\r\ndownpour, and the marching became very unpleasant and difficult, as we\r\nsank deep in the mud. Towards evening, we suddenly discovered some\r\nhundred and fifty soldiers riding full gallop in pursuit of us along the\r\nriver valley. We pushed on, and having got out of their sight behind a\r\nhill, we deviated from our course and rapidly climbed up to the top of\r\nthe hill range; my two men and the yaks concealed themselves on the other\r\nside. I remained lying flat on the top of the hill, spying with my\r\ntelescope the movements of our pursuers. They rode unsuspectingly on, the\r\ntinkling of their horse-bells sounding pleasant to the ear at that\r\ndeserted spot. They made a pretty picture, and, thinking probably that we\r\nhad continued our way along the river, they rode past the spot where we\r\nhad left the path, and, possibly owing to their haste to catch us up, did\r\nnot notice our tracks up the hillside.\r\n\r\nRain began to fall heavily again, and we remained encamped at 17,000 feet\r\nwith all our loads ready for flight at any moment; the night being spent\r\nnone too comfortably. I sat up all night, rifle in hand, in case of a\r\nsurprise, and I was indeed glad when day dawned. The rain had stopped,\r\nbut we were now enveloped in a white mist which chilled us. I was very\r\ntired, and telling Chanden Sing to keep a sharp watch, tried to sleep for\r\na while.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITH ONLY TWO MEN I PROCEEDED TOWARDS LHASSA]\r\n\r\n"_Hazur, hazur! jaldi apka banduk!_" ("Sir, sir, quick, your rifle!")\r\nmuttered my bearer, rousing me. "Do you hear the sound of bells?"\r\n\r\nThe tinkling was quite plain. As our pursuers were approaching, evidently\r\nin a strong body, there was no time to be lost. To successfully evade\r\nthem appeared impossible, so I decided to meet them, rather than attempt\r\nflight. Chanden Sing and I were armed with our rifles, and Mansing with\r\nhis Gourkha _kukri_, and thus we awaited their arrival. There came out of\r\nthe mist a long procession of grey, phantomlike figures, each one leading\r\na pony. The advance guard stopped from time to time to examine the\r\nground; having discovered our footprints only partially washed away by\r\nthe rain, they were following them up. Seeing us at last on the top of\r\nthe hill, they halted. There was commotion among them, and they held an\r\nexcited consultation; some of them unslung their matchlocks, others drew\r\ntheir swords, while we sat on a rock above and watched them with\r\nundivided attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n     An interview--Peace or war?--Gifts and the scarf of\r\n     friendship--The _Kata_--The end of a friendly visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER hesitating a little, four officers signalled to us that they wished\r\nto approach.\r\n\r\n"You are a great king!" shouted one at the top of his voice, "and we want\r\nto lay these presents at your feet," and he pointed to some small bags\r\nwhich the other three men were carrying. "_Gelbo! Chakzal! Chakzal!_"\r\n("We salute you, king!")\r\n\r\nI felt anything but regal after the wretched night we had spent, but I\r\nwished to treat the natives with due deference and politeness whenever it\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nI said that four men might approach, but the bulk of the party was to\r\nwithdraw to a spot about two hundred yards away. This they immediately\r\ndid, a matter of some surprise to me after the warlike attitude they had\r\nassumed at first. They laid their matchlocks down in the humblest\r\nfashion, and duly replaced their swords in their sheaths. The four\r\nofficers approached, and when quite close to us, threw the bags on the\r\nground and opened them to show us their contents. There was _tsamba_,\r\nflour, _chura_ (a kind of cheese), _guram_ (sweet paste), butter, and\r\ndried fruit. The officers were most profuse in their humble salutations.\r\nThey had removed their caps and thrown them on the ground, and they kept\r\ntheir tongues sticking out of their mouths until I begged them to draw\r\nthem in. They professed to be the subordinates of the Tokchim Tarjum, who\r\nhad despatched them to inquire after my health, and who wished me to look\r\nupon him as my best friend. Well aware of the difficulties we must\r\nencounter in travelling through such an inhospitable country, the\r\nTarjum, they said, wished me to accept the gifts they now laid before me,\r\nand with these they handed me a _Kata_, or "the scarf of love and\r\nfriendship," a long piece of thin silklike gauze, the end of which had\r\nbeen cut into a fringe. In Tibet these _Katas_ accompany every gift, and\r\nno caller ever goes about without one, which instantly on arrival he\r\nproduces for presentation to his host. The high Lamas sell them to\r\ndevotees, and one or more of these scarves is presented to those who\r\nleave a satisfactory oblation after visiting a lamasery and temple. If a\r\nverbal message is sent to a friend, a _Kata_ is sent with it, and among\r\nofficials and Lamas small pieces of this silk gauze are enclosed even in\r\nletters. Not to give or send a _Kata_ to an honoured visitor is\r\nconsidered a breach of good manners and is equivalent to a slight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KATA]\r\n\r\nI hastened to express my thanks for the Tarjum\'s kindness, and I handed\r\nthe messengers a sum in silver of three times the value of the articles\r\npresented. The men seemed very pleasant and friendly, and we chatted for\r\nsome time. Much to my annoyance, poor Mansing, bewildered at the sight of\r\nso much food, could no longer resist the pangs of hunger and, caring\r\nlittle for the breach of etiquette and likely consequences, proceeded to\r\nfill his mouth with handfuls of flour, cheese and butter. This led the\r\nTibetans to suspect that we must be starving, and with their usual\r\nshrewdness they determined to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\n"The Tarjum," said the oldest of the messengers, "wishes you to come back\r\nand be his guest, when he will feed you and your men, and you will then\r\ngo back to your country."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," I replied; "we do not want the Tarjum\'s food, nor do we wish\r\nto go back. I am greatly obliged for his kindness, but we will continue\r\nour journey."\r\n\r\n"Then," angrily said a young and powerful Tibetan, "if you continue your\r\njourney we will take back our gifts."\r\n\r\n"And your _Kata!_" I rejoined, sending first the large ball of butter\r\nflying into his chest, and after it the small bags of flour, _tsamba_,\r\ncheese, fruit, &c., a minute earlier prettily laid out before us.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected bombardment quite upset the Tibetans, who, with powdered\r\ncoats, hair and faces, scampered away as best they could, while Chanden\r\nSing, always as quick as lightning when it was a case of hitting, pounded\r\naway with the butt of his rifle at the roundest part of one ambassador\'s\r\nbody, as in his clumsy clothes he attempted to get up and run.\r\n\r\nMansing, the philosopher of our party, interrupted in his feed but not\r\nput out, nor concerned in what was going on, picked up the fruit and\r\ncheese and pieces of butter scattered all over the place, mumbling that\r\nit was a shame to throw away good food in such a reckless fashion.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, who had been watching attentively from a distance the\r\ndifferent phases of the interview, considered it prudent to beat a hasty\r\nretreat, and, mounting their steeds with unmistakable dispatch, galloped\r\npell-mell down the hill, and then along the valley of the river, until\r\nthey were lost to sight in the mist, while the poor ambassadors, who had\r\nbeen unable to rejoin their ponies, followed as quickly as possible under\r\nthe circumstances, considering the rarefied air and rough ground.\r\n\r\nTheir cries of distress, caused by fear alone, for we had done them no\r\nharm, served to strengthen the contempt in which my men by now held the\r\nTibetan soldiers and their officers.\r\n\r\nThe scene really was comical, and I made as much capital as I could out\r\nof it, laughing with my companions and ridiculing to them the supposed\r\nvalour of Tibetans.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tibetans were out of sight, Chanden Sing and I pocketed our\r\npride and helped Mansing to collect the dried dates, apricots, the pieces\r\nof _chura_, butter and _guram_. Then having loaded our yaks we marched\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\n     Rain in torrents--A swampy plain--The sun at last--Our yaks\r\n     stolen and recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE were not in luck. The weather continued squally in the morning, and in\r\nthe afternoon the rain was again torrential. We went towards 78 deg. over\r\nuninteresting and monotonous grey country with a chain of snowy peaks\r\nstretching from South-West to North-East. We waded through a fairly deep\r\nand very cold river, and subsequently rose over a pass 17,450 feet. A\r\nnumber of Hunyas, with flocks of several thousand sheep, came in sight,\r\nbut we avoided them. They did not see us.\r\n\r\nAt the point where we crossed it, the main stream turns in a graceful\r\nbend to 140 deg. (b.m.). We climbed over hilly and barren country to an\r\naltitude of 17,550 feet, where several small lakelets were to be found,\r\nand, having marched in all fourteen and a-half miles in a drenching rain,\r\nwe descended into a large valley. Here we had great difficulty in finding\r\na spot where to rest for the night. The plain was simply a swamp, with\r\nseveral lakes and ponds, and we sank everywhere in mud and water. All our\r\nbedding and clothes were soaked to such an extent that it really made no\r\ndifference where we halted; so we pitched our little tent on the banks of\r\na stream coming out of a valley to the North, from which, extending in an\r\neasterly direction, rose a series of pyramidal mountains, covered with\r\nsnow, and all of almost equal height and base. To the South were high\r\npeaks with great quantities of snow upon them. This valley was at an\r\nelevation of 17,450 feet, and the cold was intense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORRENTIAL RAIN]\r\n\r\nAt night the rain came down in bucketsful, and our _tente d\'abri_ gave us\r\nbut little shelter. We were lying inside in water, and all the trenches\r\nin the world could not have kept it from streaming in. In fact, it is\r\nno exaggeration to say that the whole valley was a sheet of water from\r\none to several inches deep. Of course, we suffered intensely from cold,\r\nthe thermometer dropping to 26 deg. at 8 P.M., when a South-East wind blew\r\nfuriously; and the rain fell mixed with sleet for a time, and was\r\nfollowed by a heavy snowstorm. We lay crouched up on the top of our\r\nbaggage, so as not to sleep on the frozen water, and when we woke in the\r\nmorning our tent had half collapsed owing to the weight of snow upon it.\r\nDuring the day the temperature went up and rain fell afresh, so that when\r\nwe resumed our marching, we sank into a mixture of mud, snow and water\r\nseveral inches deep. We had to cross three rivers, and to skirt five\r\nlakes of various sizes, following a course of 83 deg. 45\'.\r\n\r\nSeven miles of this dreary marching saw us encamped (17,380 feet) by the\r\nfoot of a conical hill 17,500 feet, where an almost identical repetition\r\nof the previous night\'s experience took place. The thermometer was down\r\nto 32 deg., but fortunately the wind subsided at eight in the evening. As\r\nluck would have it, the sun came out the following day, and we were able\r\nto spread out all our things to dry, during which process we had yet\r\nanother novel experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF BRIGAND]\r\n\r\nOur two yaks had disappeared. I climbed up to the summit of the hill\r\nabove camp, and with my telescope scoured the plain. The two animals were\r\nsome distance off being led away by ten or twelve men on horseback, who\r\ndrove in front of them a flock of about five hundred sheep. By their\r\nclothing I recognised the strangers to be robbers. Naturally I started\r\npost haste to recover my property, leaving Chanden Sing and Mansing in\r\ncharge of our camp. I caught them up as they marched slowly, though, when\r\nthey perceived me, they hastened on, trying to get away. I shouted three\r\ntimes to them to stop, but they paid no heed to my words, so that I\r\nunslung my rifle and would have shot at them had the threat alone not\r\nbeen sufficient to make them reflect. They halted, and when I got near\r\nenough I claimed my two yaks back. They refused to give them up. They\r\nsaid they were twelve men, and were not afraid of one. Dismounted from\r\ntheir ponies, they seemed ready to go for me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGANDS WITH SHEEP]\r\n\r\nAs I saw them take out a flint and steel to light the fuses of their\r\nmatchlocks, I thought I might as well have my innings first, and, before\r\nthey could guess at my intention, I applied a violent blow with the\r\nmuzzle of my rifle to the stomach of the man nearest to me. He collapsed,\r\nwhile I administered another blow to the right temple of another man who\r\nheld his matchlock between his legs, and was on the point of striking his\r\nflint and steel to set the tinder on fire. He, too, staggered and fell\r\nclumsily.\r\n\r\n"_Chakzal, chakzal! Chakzal wortzie!_" ("We salute you, we salute you!\r\nPlease listen!") exclaimed a third brigand, with an expression of\r\ndismay, and holding up his thumbs, with his fist closed in sign of\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n"_Chakzal_," I replied, shoving a cartridge into the Mannlicher.\r\n\r\n"_Middu, middu!_" ("No, no!") they entreated, promptly laying down their\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nI purchased from these men about thirty pounds of _tsamba_ and eight of\r\nbutter, and got one of them to carry this to my camp, while I, without\r\nfurther trouble, recovered my yaks and drove them back to where Chanden\r\nSing and Mansing were busy lighting a fire to make some tea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SADDLE BAGS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\n     Travelling Tibetans--Over a high pass--A friendly meeting--A\r\n     proffered banquet--Ascent to 20,000 feet--Looking for the Gunkyo\r\n     Lake--Surprised by a phantom army.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWARDS noon, when our things had got almost dry in the warm sun, the sky\r\nbecame overclouded, and it again began to rain heavily. I was rather\r\ndoubtful as to whether I should go over a pass some miles off to 93 deg.\r\n(b.m.), or should follow the course of the river and skirt the foot of\r\nthe mountains. We saw a large number of Tibetans travelling in the\r\nopposite direction to ours, and they all seemed much terrified when we\r\napproached them. We obtained from them a few more pounds of food, but\r\nthey refused to sell us any sheep, of which they had thousands. I decided\r\nto attempt the first-mentioned route and, making our way first over a\r\ncontinuation of the flat plateau, then over undulating, ground, we came\r\nto two lakelets, at the foot of the pass in question. The ascent was\r\ncomparatively gentle, over snow, and we followed the river descending\r\nfrom the top. About half-way up, on looking back, we saw eight soldiers\r\ngalloping toward us. We waited for them; and as soon as they came up to\r\nus, they went through the usual servile salutations, depositing their\r\narms on the ground to show that they had no intention of fighting. A long\r\nfriendly palaver followed, the Tibetans professing their friendship for\r\nus and their willingness to help us to get on in any way in their power.\r\nThis was rather too good to be true, and I suspected treachery, all the\r\nmore so when they pressed and entreated us to go back to their tents,\r\nwhere they wished us to remain as their highly-honoured guests, and where\r\nwe should have all the luxuries that human mind can conceive showered\r\nupon us. On further specification, these were found to consist of\r\npresents of _chura_, cheese, butter, yak milk, and _tsamba_, and they\r\nsaid they would sell us ponies if we required them. The description was\r\ntoo glowing; so, taking all things into consideration, and allowing for\r\nthe inaccuracy of speech of my interlocutors as well as of Tibetans in\r\ngeneral, I thanked them from the bottom of my heart and answered that I\r\npreferred to continue my way and bear my present sufferings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHANTOM-LIKE VISITORS]\r\n\r\nThey perceived that I was not easy to catch, and, if anything, they\r\nrespected me the more for it. In fact they could not disguise their\r\namazement at my having got so far with only two men. When I had given my\r\nvisitors some little present, we parted at last, in a very friendly\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWe climbed up to the pass (18,480 feet), and before us on the other side\r\nfound a large stretch of flat land, some two thousand feet lower. I could\r\nsee a lake, which I took to be the Gunkyo. Nevertheless, to make certain\r\nof it, I left my men and yaks on the pass and went to reconnoitre from a\r\npeak 19,000 feet high, N.E. of us. There was much snow and the ascent was\r\ndifficult and tedious. When I got to the top another higher peak barred\r\nthe view in front of me, so descending first and then ascending again, I\r\nclimbed this second summit, finally reaching an elevation of 20,000 feet,\r\nand obtaining a good bird\'s-eye view of the country all round. There was\r\na long snowy range to the North, and, directly under it, what I imagined\r\nto be a stretch of water, judging from the mist and clouds forming above\r\nit, and from the grass on the lower portion of the mountains.\r\n\r\nA hill range stood in my way, just high enough to conceal the lake behind\r\nit. I rejoined my men and we continued our march down the other side of\r\nthe pass, sinking in deep, soft snow. We pitched our tent at a spot about\r\nfive hundred feet higher than the plain below us, in a gorge formed by\r\nthe two mountain sides coming close together. Notwithstanding that I was\r\nnow quite accustomed to great altitudes, the ascent to 20,000 feet had\r\ncaused a certain exhaustion, and I should have been glad of a good\r\nnight\'s rest.\r\n\r\nMansing and Chanden Sing, having eaten some food, slept soundly, but I\r\nfelt very depressed. I had a peculiar sense of unrest and of some evil\r\ncoming to us during the night.\r\n\r\nWe were all three under our little tent, when I began to fancy there was\r\nsome one outside. I do not know why the thought entered my head, for I\r\nheard no noise, but all the same I felt I must see and satisfy my\r\ncuriosity. I peeped out of the tent with my rifle in hand, and saw a\r\nnumber of black figures cautiously crawling towards us. In a moment I was\r\noutside on my bare feet, running towards them and shouting at the top of\r\nmy voice, "_Pila tedau tedang!_" ("Look out, look out!") which caused a\r\nstampede among our ghostlike visitors. There were, apparently, numbers of\r\nthem hidden behind rocks, for when the panic seized them, the number of\r\nrunaways was double or even treble that of the phantoms I had at first\r\nseen approaching. At one moment there seemed to be black ghosts springing\r\nout from everywhere, only, more solid than ghosts, they made a dreadful\r\nnoise with their heavy boots as they ran in confusion down the steep\r\ndescent and through the gorge. They turned sharply round the hill at the\r\nbottom and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen I crawled inside the tent again Chanden Sing and Mansing, wrapped\r\nhead and all in their blankets, were still snoring!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n     A sleepless night--Watching our enemy--A picturesque sight--A\r\n     messenger--Soldiers from Lhassa--Taken for a Kashmeree--The\r\n     Gunkyo Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALLY I passed a sleepless night after that, fearing that the\r\nunwelcome visitors might return. We speculated much as to how the\r\nTibetans had found us, and we could not help surmising that our friends\r\nof the previous afternoon must have put them on our track. However, such\r\nwas the inconceivable cowardice shown on every occasion by the Tibetans,\r\nthat we got to attach no importance to these incidents, and not only did\r\nthey not inspire us with fear, but they even ceased to excite or disturb\r\nus much.\r\n\r\nWe went on as usual, descending to the plain, and when we had got\r\nhalf-way across it, I scoured the hills all round with my telescope to\r\nsee if I could discern traces of our pusillanimous foes.\r\n\r\n"There they are," cried Chanden Sing, who had the most wonderful eyesight\r\nof any man I have known, as he pointed at the summit of a hill where,\r\namong the rocks, several heads could be seen peeping. We went on without\r\ntaking further notice of them, and then they came out of their\r\nhiding-place, and we saw them descending the hill in a long line, leading\r\ntheir ponies. On reaching the plain they mounted their steeds and came\r\nfull gallop towards us. They were quite a picturesque sight in their\r\ndark-red coats or brown and yellow skin robes and their vari-coloured\r\ncaps. Some wore bright red coats with gold braiding, and Chinese caps.\r\nThese were officers. The soldiers\' matchlocks, to the rests of which red\r\nand white flags were attached, gave a touch of colour to the otherwise\r\ndreary scenery of barren hills and snow, and the tinkling of the\r\nhorse-bells enlivened the monotony of these silent, inhospitable\r\nregions. They dismounted some three hundred yards from us, and one old\r\nman, throwing aside his matchlock and sword in a theatrical fashion,\r\nwalked unsteadily towards us. We received him kindly, and he afforded us\r\ngreat amusement, for in his way he was a strange character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUNKYO LAKE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I AM ONLY A MESSENGER"]\r\n\r\n"I am only a messenger," he hastened to state, "and therefore do not pour\r\nyour anger upon me if I speak to you. I only convey the words of my\r\nofficers, who do not dare to come for fear of being injured. News has\r\nbeen received at Lhassa, from whence we have come, that a _Plenki_ (an\r\nEnglishman) with many men is in Tibet, and can be found nowhere. We have\r\nbeen sent to capture him. Are you one of his advance guard?"\r\n\r\n"No," I replied drily. "I suppose that you have taken several months to\r\ncome from Lhassa."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! Our ponies are good," he answered; "and we have come quickly."\r\n\r\n"_Chik, ni, sum, shi, nga, do, diu, ghieh, gu, chu, chuck chick, chuck\r\nni_," the Tibetan counted up to twelve, frowning and keeping his head\r\ninclined towards the right as if to collect his thoughts, at the same\r\ntime holding up his hand, with the thumb folded against the palm, and\r\nturning down a finger as he called each number. The thumbs are never\r\nused in counting. "_Lum chuck ni niman!_" "Twelve days," said he, "have\r\nwe been on the road. We have orders not to return till we have captured\r\nthe _Plenki_. And you?" asked he inquisitively, "how long have you taken\r\nto come from Ladak?"\r\n\r\nHe said that he could see by my face that I was a Kashmeree, I being\r\nprobably so burnt and dirty that it was hard to distinguish me from a\r\nnative. The old man cross-examined me to find out whether I was a\r\n_pundit_ sent by the Indian Government to survey the country, and asked\r\nme why I had discarded my native clothes for _Plenki_ (European) ones. He\r\nover and over again inquired whether I was not one of the _Plenki\'s_\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n"_Keran ga naddo ung?_" ("Where are you going?") he queried.\r\n\r\n"_Nhgarang no koroun Lama jehlhuong._" ("I am a pilgrim," I replied,\r\n"going to visit monasteries.")\r\n\r\n"_Keran mi japodu._" ("You are a good man.")\r\n\r\nHe offered to show me the way to the Gunkyo Lake, and was so pressing\r\nthat I accepted. However, when I saw the 200 soldiers mount and follow\r\nus, I remonstrated with him, saying that if we were to be friends we did\r\nnot need an army to escort us.\r\n\r\n"If you are our friend, you can come alone, and we will not injure you,"\r\nI gave him to understand; "but if you are our enemy we will fight you and\r\nyour army here at once, and we will save you the trouble of coming on."\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan, confused and hesitating, went to confabulate with his men,\r\nand returned some time after with eight of them, while the bulk of his\r\nforce galloped away in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nWe went across the plain to 355 deg. (b.m.), until we came to a hill range,\r\nwhich we crossed over a pass 17,450 feet high. Then, altering our course\r\nto 56 deg. 30\', we descended and ascended several hills, and at last found\r\nourselves in the grassy sheltered valley of the large Gunkyo Lake,\r\nextending from South-East to North-West. With a temperature of 68 deg.\r\n(Fahr.) the water in hypsometrical apparatus boiled at 183 deg. 31/2\' at 8.30\r\nin the evening. The lake was of extraordinary beauty, with the high snowy\r\nGangri mountains rising almost sheer from its waters, and on the southern\r\nside lofty hills forming a background wild and picturesque, but barren\r\nand desolate beyond all words. At the other end of the lake, to the\r\nNorth-West, were lower mountains skirting the water.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at 16,455 feet, and the soldiers pitched their tent some\r\nfifty yards away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n     In pleasant company--Unpopularity of the Lamas--Soldiers--Towards\r\n     the Maium Pass--Grass--Threats--Puzzled Tibetans--The Maium\r\n     Pass--Obos.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the evening the Tibetans came over to my camp and made themselves\r\nuseful. They helped us to get fuel, and brewed tea for me in Tibetan\r\nfashion. They seemed decent fellows, although sly if you like. They\r\nprofessed to hate the Lamas, the rulers of the country, to whom they took\r\nspecial pleasure in applying names hardly repeatable in these pages.\r\nAccording to them, the Lamas had all the money that came into the\r\ncountry, and no one but themselves was allowed to have any. They were not\r\nparticular as to the means used to obtain their aim; they were cruel and\r\nunjust. Every man in Tibet, they said, was a soldier in case of\r\nemergency, and every one a servant of the Lamas. The soldiers of the\r\nstanding army received a certain quantity of _tsamba_, bricks of tea and\r\nbutter, and that was all, no pay being given in cash. Usually, however,\r\nthey were given a pony to ride, and when on travelling duty they had a\r\nright to obtain relays of animals at post-stations and villages, where\r\nalso they were entitled to claim supplies of food, saddles, or anything\r\nelse they required, to last them as far as the next encampment. The\r\nweapons (sword and matchlock) generally belonged to the men themselves,\r\nand always remained in the family; but occasionally, and especially in\r\nthe larger towns, such as Lhassa and Sigatz, the Lamas provided them:\r\ngunpowder and bullets were invariably supplied by the authorities. The\r\narms were manufactured mostly in Lhassa and Sigatz. Although the Tibetans\r\nboasted of great accuracy in shooting with their matchlocks, which had\r\nwooden rests to allow the marksman to take a steady aim, it was never my\r\npleasure to see even the champion shots in the country hit the mark. It\r\nis true that, for sporting purposes and for economy\'s sake, the Tibetan\r\nsoldier hardly ever used lead bullets or shot, but preferred to fill his\r\nbarrel with pebbles, which were scarcely calculated to improve the bore\r\nof the weapon. Furthermore, gunpowder was so scarce that it was but very\r\nseldom they had a chance of practising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING PRAYERS ON THE MAIUM PASS]\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the view of Gunkyo was magnificent, with the snow-covered\r\nmountains tinted gold and red, and reflected in their minutest details in\r\nthe still waters of the lake. We loaded our yaks, the Tibetans giving us\r\na helping hand, and started towards the Maium Pass, following a general\r\ncourse of 109 deg. up the river, which throws itself into the Gunkyo Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATCHLOCK]\r\n\r\nThe valley was very narrow, and ran in continuous zigzags; but although\r\nthe altitude was great, there was abundance of grass, and the green was\r\nquite refreshing to the eyes, tired as we were of snow and reddish barren\r\nmountains and desert-like stretches of land. We came to a basin where, on\r\nthe opposite bank of the stream, was a large Tibetan camping-ground with\r\na high wall of stones. Behind it I could see smoke rising, which made me\r\nsuspect that there were people concealed there.\r\n\r\nOur Tibetan friends asked what we were going to do, and begged me to stop\r\nthere to talk and drink tea. I said I had had quite enough of both, and\r\nwould proceed.\r\n\r\n"If you go on we will kill you," said one of the soldiers, getting into a\r\ntemper, and taking advantage of our politeness towards him and his mates.\r\n\r\n"_Nga samgi ganta indah_" ("If you please"), I answered with studied\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n"If you go another step, we will cut off your head, or you will have to\r\ncut off ours," cried two or three others, stretching their bare necks\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n"_Taptih middu_" ("I have not got a small knife"), I replied, quite\r\nseriously, and with assumed disappointment, twirling my hand in the air\r\nin Tibetan fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans did not know what to make of me, and when I moved towards\r\nthe pass, on which hundreds of flying prayers flapped in the wind, after\r\npolitely bidding them good-bye with tongue out, and waving both my hands\r\npalms upwards in front of my forehead in the most approved Tibetan style,\r\nthey took off their caps and humbly saluted us by going down on their\r\nknees and putting their heads close to the ground.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the plain, and slowly wended our way up the pass. Near the top\r\nwe came to a track, the highway from Ladak to Lhassa _via_ Gartok, along\r\nthe northern side of the Rakstal, Mansarowar and Gunkyo Lakes. On the\r\npass itself were planted several poles connected by means of ropes, from\r\nwhich flying prayers waved gaily in the breeze. _Obos_, or mounds of\r\nstones, had also been erected here. The slabs were usually white, and\r\nbore in many instances the inscription "_Omne mani padme hun_." Yak\r\nskulls and horns, as well as those of goats and sheep, were laid by the\r\nside of these Obos, the same words being engraved on the bone and stained\r\nred with the blood of the animal killed.\r\n\r\nThese sacrifices are offered by Tibetans when crossing a high pass,\r\nespecially if there is a Lama close at hand to commemorate the event. The\r\nmeat of the animal killed is eaten by the people present, and, if the\r\nparty is a large one, dancing and singing follow the feast. As I have\r\nalready remarked, these Obos are found all over the country; they\r\nindicate the points marking the passes or summits of hills, and no\r\nTibetan ever goes by one of them without depositing on it a white stone\r\nto appease the possible wrath of their God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\n     The Maium Pass--Into the Yutzang province--Its capital--The\r\n     Doktol province--Orders disregarded--The sources of the\r\n     Brahmaputra--Change in the climate--The valley of the\r\n     Brahmaputra--Running risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Maium Pass (17,500 feet), to which from where I started no Englishman\r\nhad ever penetrated, is a great landmark in Tibet, for not only does one\r\nof the sources of the great Tsangpu, or Brahmaputra River, rise on its\r\nS.E. slopes, but it also separates the immense provinces of Nari-Khorsum\r\n(extending West of the Maium Pass and comprising the mountainous and\r\nlacustrine region as far as Ladak) from the Yutzang, the central province\r\nof Tibet, stretching East of the pass along the valley of the Brahmaputra\r\nand having Lhassa for its capital. The word _Yu_ in Tibetan means\r\n"middle," and it is applied to this province, as it occupies the centre\r\nof Tibet. To the North of the Maium lies the Doktol province.\r\n\r\nI had taken a reconnoitring trip to another pass to the N.E. of us, and\r\nhad just returned to my men on the Maium Pass, when several of the\r\nTibetan soldiers we had left behind rode up towards us. We waited for\r\nthem, and their leader, pointing at the valley beyond the pass, cried:\r\n"That yonder is the Lhassa territory and we forbid you to enter it."\r\n\r\nI took no notice of his protest, and driving before me the two yaks I\r\nstepped into the most sacred of all the sacred provinces, "the ground of\r\nGod."\r\n\r\nWe descended quickly on the Eastern side of the pass, while the soldiers,\r\naghast, remained watching us from above, themselves a most picturesque\r\nsight as they stood among the Obos against the sky-line, with the\r\nsunlight shining on their jewelled swords and the gay red flags of their\r\nmatchlocks, while over their heads strings of flying prayers waved in\r\nthe wind. Having watched us for a little while, they disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOURCE OF THE BRAHMAPUTRA]\r\n\r\nA little rivulet, hardly six inches wide, descended among stones in the\r\ncentre of the valley we were following, and was soon swollen by other\r\nrivulets from melting snows on the mountains to either side. This was one\r\nsource[24] of the great Brahmaputra, one of the largest rivers of the\r\nworld. I must confess that I felt somewhat proud to be the first European\r\nwho had ever reached these sources, and there was a certain childish\r\ndelight in standing over this sacred stream which, of such immense width\r\nlower down, could here be spanned by a man standing with legs slightly\r\napart. We drank of its waters at the spot where it had its birth, and\r\nthen, following a marked track to 125 deg. (b.m.), we continued our descent\r\non a gentle incline along a grassy valley. The change in the climate\r\nbetween the West and South-east sides of the Maium Pass was\r\nextraordinary. On the Western side we had nothing but violent storms of\r\nhail, rain and snow, the dampness in the air rendering the atmosphere\r\ncold even during the day. The soil was unusually marshy, and very little\r\nfuel or grass could be found. The moment the pass was crossed we were in\r\na mild, pleasant climate, with a lovely deep blue sky over us and plenty\r\nof grass for the yaks, as well as low shrubs for our fires; so that,\r\nafter all our sufferings and privations, we felt that we had indeed\r\nentered the land of God. Notwithstanding that I expected great trouble\r\nsooner or later, I was not at all sorry I had disobeyed the soldiers\'\r\norders and had marched straight into the forbidden territory--it was a\r\nkind of wild satisfaction at doing that which is forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmaputra received three small snow-fed tributaries descending\r\nrapidly from the steep mountains on either side of us; and where the main\r\nstream turned sharply to 170 deg., a fourth and important tributary, carrying\r\na very large volume of water, came down to it through a gorge from 20 deg.\r\n(b.m.).\r\n\r\nWe encamped near the junction of these rivers, on the right bank of the\r\nmain stream, at an altitude of 16,620 feet. From the Maium Pass a\r\ncontinuation of the Gangri chain of mountains runs first in a\r\nSouth-easterly direction, then due East, taking a line almost parallel to\r\nthe higher Southern range of the Himahlyas, and forming a vast plain\r\nintersected by the Brahmaputra. On the Southern side of the river can be\r\nseen minor hill ranges between the river course and the big range with\r\nits majestic snowy peaks and beautiful glaciers. This Northern range\r\nkeeps an almost parallel line to the greater range southward; and, though\r\nno peaks of very considerable elevation are to be found along it, yet it\r\nis of geographical importance, as its Southern slopes form the Northern\r\nwatershed of the holy river as far as Lhassa.\r\n\r\nThe valley enclosed between these two parallel ranges is the most thickly\r\npopulated valley in Tibet. Grass is abundant, and fuel easily obtainable,\r\nand therefore thousands of yaks, sheep, and goats can be seen grazing\r\nnear the many Tibetan camps along the Brahmaputra and its principal\r\ntributaries. The trade route taken by the caravans from Ladak to Lhassa\r\nfollows this valley; and, as I came to Tibet to see and study the\r\nTibetans, I thought that, although I might run greater risks, I could in\r\nno part of the country accomplish my object better than by going along\r\nthis thickly populated track.\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] I passed the other source on the return journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n     Expecting trouble--Along the Brahmaputra--A thunderstorm--A\r\n     dilemma--A dangerous river--Swamped--Saved--Night disturbers--A\r\n     new friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE slept very little, as we expected the soldiers to attack us during the\r\nnight to try and stop our progress, but all was quiet and nothing\r\nhappened; our yaks, however, managed to get loose, and we had some\r\ndifficulty in recovering them in the morning, for they had swum across\r\nthe stream, and had gone about a mile from camp on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe night had been very cold, the thermometer dropping as low as 321/2 deg.. We\r\ndid not pitch our little tent, in case of emergencies, and we were tired\r\nand cold after the long march of the previous day. There was a\r\nSouth-westerly breeze blowing and I found it hard to have to cross the\r\nriver, chase the yaks and bring them back to camp. Then, exhausted as we\r\nwere, we had in addition to go through the daily routine of loading them.\r\nWe followed the right bank of the stream to bearings 170 deg. (m.), then to\r\n142 deg. 30\' (b.m.), where it wound in and out between barren hills,\r\nsubsequently flowing through a grassy valley three-quarters of a mile\r\nwide and a mile and a half long. It then went through a narrow passage to\r\n17 deg. 30\' (b.m.) and turned to 103 deg. and farther to 142 deg. through an\r\nundulating grassy valley two miles wide, in crossing which we were caught\r\nin a terrific thunderstorm, with hail and rain. This was indeed an\r\nannoying experience, for we were now before a very large tributary of the\r\nBrahmaputra, and the stream was so swollen, rapid and deep that I was\r\nmuch puzzled as to how to take my men across: they could not swim, and\r\nthe water was so cold that a dip in it would give any one a severe shock.\r\nHowever, there was no time to be lost, for the river was visibly rising,\r\nand as the storm was getting worse, difficulties would only increase\r\nevery moment. We took off every stitch of clothing and fastened our\r\ngarments, with our rifles, &c., on the pack-saddles of the yaks, which we\r\nsent into the water. They are good swimmers, and though the current\r\ncarried them over a hundred yards down stream, we saw them with\r\nsatisfaction scramble out of the water on to the opposite bank.\r\nNotwithstanding the faith that Chanden Sing and Mansing had in my\r\nswimming, they really thought that their last hour had come when I took\r\neach by the hand and asked them to follow me into the stream. Hardly had\r\nwe gone twelve yards when the inevitable took place. We were all three\r\nswept away, and Chanden Sing and Mansing in their panic clung tight to my\r\narms and dragged me under water. Though I swam my hardest with my legs,\r\nwe continually came to the surface and then sank again, owing to the dead\r\nweight of my helpless mates. But at last, after a desperate struggle, the\r\ncurrent washed us on to the opposite side, where we found our feet, and\r\nwere soon able to scramble out of the treacherous river. We were some two\r\nhundred yards down stream from the spot at which we had entered the\r\nriver, and such was the quantity of muddy water we had swallowed that we\r\nall three became sick. This left us much exhausted, and, as the storm\r\nshowed no signs of abating, we encamped (16,320 feet) there and then on\r\nthe left bank of the stream. Though we sadly needed some warm food, there\r\nwas, of course, no possibility of lighting a fire. A piece of chocolate\r\nwas all I had that night, and my men preferred to eat nothing rather than\r\nbreak their caste by eating my food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN DOG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL MANI WALL]\r\n\r\nWe were asleep under our little tent, the hour being about eleven, when\r\nthere was a noise outside as of voices and people stumbling against\r\nstones. I was out in a moment with my rifle, and shouted the usual\r\n"_Palado_" ("Go away"), in answer to which, though I could see nothing\r\nowing to the darkness, I heard several stones flung from slings whizzing\r\npast me. One of these hit the tent, and a dog barked furiously. I fired a\r\nshot in the air, which had the good effect of producing a hasty retreat\r\nof our enemies, whoever they were. The dog, however, would not go. He\r\nremained outside barking all night, and it was only in the morning, when\r\nI gave him some food and caressed him in Tibetan fashion, with the usual\r\nwords of endearment, "_Chochu, Chochu_," that our four-footed foe became\r\nfriendly, rubbing himself against my legs as if he had known me all his\r\nlife, and taking a particular fancy to Mansing, by whose side he lay\r\ndown. From that day he never left our camp, and followed us everywhere,\r\nuntil harder times came upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\n     Leaving the course of the river--A pass--An arid plain--More\r\n     vanishing soldiers--Another river--A _mani_ wall--_Mirage?_--A\r\n     large Tibetan encampment--The chain of mountains North of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE river was turning too much towards the South, so I decided to abandon\r\nit and strike across country, especially as there were faint signs of a\r\ntrack leading over a pass to 110 deg. (b.m.) from camp. I followed this\r\ntrack, and along it I distinguished marks of hundreds of ponies\' hoofs,\r\nnow almost entirely washed away. This was evidently the way taken by the\r\nsoldiers we had encountered on the other side of the Maium Pass.\r\n\r\nHaving risen over the col 17,750 feet, we saw before us an extensive\r\nvalley with barren hills scattered over it. To the South we observed a\r\nlarge plain some ten miles wide, with snowy peaks rising on the farther\r\nside. In front was a hill projecting into the plain, on which stood a\r\n_mani_ wall; and this latter discovery made me feel quite confident that\r\nI was on the high road to Lhassa. About eight miles off to the NNW. were\r\nhigh snowy peaks, and as we went farther we found a lofty mountain range,\r\nwith still higher peaks, three miles behind it. We had travelled half-way\r\nacross the waterless plain, when we noticed a number of soldiers\' heads\r\nand matchlocks popping in and out from behind a distant hill. After a\r\nwhile they came out in numbers to observe our movements, then retired\r\nagain behind the hill. We proceeded, but when we were still half a mile\r\nfrom them they abandoned their hiding-place, and galloped away before us,\r\nraising clouds of dust. From a hill 16,200 feet, over which the track\r\ncrossed, we perceived a group of very high snowy peaks about eight miles\r\ndistant. Between them and us stood a range of hills cut by a valley,\r\nalong which flowed a river carrying a large volume of water. This we\r\nfollowed to 126 deg. (b.m.), and having found a suitable fording-place, we\r\ncrossed over at a spot where the stream was twenty-five yards across, and\r\nthe water reached up to our waists. We found here another _mani_ wall\r\nwith large inscriptions on stones, and as the wind was very high and\r\ncutting, we made use of it to shelter us. Within the angle comprised\r\nbetween bearings 240 deg. and 120 deg. (b.m.) we could observe a very high, snowy\r\nmountain range in the distance (the great Himahlyan chain), and lower\r\nhill ranges even as near as three miles from camp. The river we had just\r\ncrossed flowed into the Brahmaputra, and we were now at an elevation of\r\n15,700 feet. We saw plainly at sunset a number of black tents before us\r\nat bearings 120 deg.; we calculated them to be two miles distant. We counted\r\nabout sixty, as well as hundreds of black yaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EFFECT OF MIRAGE]\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the next morning, much to our surprise, they had all vanished;\r\nnor, on marching in the direction where we had seen them the previous\r\nnight, were we able to find traces of them. It seemed as if it must have\r\nbeen _mirage_. Eventually, however, some fourteen miles away, across a\r\ngrassy plain bounded to the North-East by the range extending from\r\nNorth-West to South-East, and with lofty snowy peaks at 72 deg. some five\r\nmiles off, we came upon a very large Tibetan encampment of over eighty\r\nblack tents at an altitude of 15,650 feet. They were pitched on the banks\r\nof another tributary of the Brahmaputra, which, after describing a great\r\ncurve in the plain, passed West of the encampment. Five miles off, in the\r\narc of circle described from 310 deg. to 70 deg. (b.m.), stood the chain of\r\nmountains which I had observed all along; but here the elevations of its\r\npeaks became gradually lower and lower, so much so that the name of "hill\r\nrange" would be more appropriate to it than that of "mountain chain."\r\nBehind it, however, towered loftier peaks again with their snowy caps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\n     A commotion--An invitation declined--The tents--Delicacies--The\r\n     _Chokseh_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE wanted food, and so made boldly for the encampment. Our approach\r\ncaused a great commotion, and yaks and sheep were hastily driven away\r\nbefore us, while men and women rushed in and out of their tents,\r\napparently in a state of much excitement. Eight or ten men reluctantly\r\ncame forward and entreated us to go inside a large tent. They said they\r\nwished to speak to us, and offered us tea. I would not accept their\r\ninvitation, distrusting them, but went on across the encampment, halting\r\nsome three hundred yards beyond it. Chanden Sing and I proceeded\r\nafterwards on a round of calls at all the tents, trying to purchase food\r\nand also to show that, if we had declined to enter a particular tent, it\r\nwas not on account of fear, but because we did not want to be caught in a\r\ntrap. Our visit to the different _golingchos_ or _gurr_ (tents) was\r\ninteresting enough. The tents themselves were very cleverly constructed,\r\nand admirably adapted to the country in which they were used; and the\r\nvarious articles of furniture inside attracted my curiosity. The tents,\r\nblack in colour, were woven of yaks\' hair, the natural greasiness of\r\nwhich made them quite waterproof. They consisted of two separate pieces\r\nof this thick material, supported by two poles at each end, and there was\r\nan oblong aperture above in the upper part of the tent, through which the\r\nsmoke could escape. The base of the larger tents was hexagonal in shape:\r\nthe roof, generally at a height of six or seven feet above the ground,\r\nwas kept very tightly stretched by means of long ropes passing over high\r\npoles and pegged to the ground. Wooden and iron pegs were used for this\r\npurpose, and many were required to keep the tent close to the ground all\r\nround, so as to protect its inmates from the cutting winds of the great\r\nplateau. Long poles, as a rule numbering four, with white flying prayers,\r\ncould be seen outside each tent, or one to each point of the compass, the\r\nEast being taken for a starting-point. Around the interior of the larger\r\ntents there was a mud wall from two to three feet high, for the purpose\r\nof further protection against wind, rain and snow. These walls were\r\nsometimes constructed of dried dung, which, as time went on, was used for\r\nfuel. There were two apertures, one at either end of the tent; that\r\nfacing the wind being always kept closed by means of loops and wooden\r\nbolts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK TENT]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan is a born nomad, and shifts his dwelling with the seasons, or\r\nwherever he can find pasture for his yaks and sheep; but, though he has\r\nno fixed abode, he knows how to make himself comfortable, and he carries\r\nwith him all that he requires. Thus, for instance, in the centre of his\r\ntent, he begins by making himself a _goling_, or fireplace of mud and\r\nstone, some three feet high and four or five long, by one and a half\r\nwide, with two, three, or more side ventilators and draught-holes. By\r\nthis ingenious contrivance he manages to increase the combustion of the\r\ndried dung, the most trying fuel from which to get a flame. On the top of\r\nthis stove a suitable place is made to fit the several _raksangs_, or\r\nlarge brass pots and bowls, in which the brick tea, having been duly\r\npounded in a stone or wooden mortar, is boiled and stirred with a long\r\nbrass spoon. A portable iron stand is generally to be seen somewhere in\r\nthe tent, upon which the hot vessels are placed, as they are removed from\r\nthe fire. Close to these is the _toxzum_ or _dongbo_, a cylindrical\r\nwooden churn, with a lid through which a piston passes. This is used for\r\nmixing the tea with butter and salt, in the way I have described as also\r\nadopted by the Jogpas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DONGBO OR TEA CHURN]\r\n\r\nThe wooden cups or bowls used by the Tibetans are called _puku, fruh_, or\r\n_cariel_, and in them _tsamba_ is also eaten after tea has been poured on\r\nit, and the mixture worked into a paste by means of more or less dirty\r\nfingers. Often extra lumps of butter are mixed with this paste, and even\r\nbits of _chura_ (cheese). The richer people (officials) indulge in flour\r\nand rice, which they import from India and China, and in _kassur_, or\r\ndried fruit (namely, dates and apricots) of inferior quality. The rice is\r\nboiled into a kind of soup called the _tukpa_, a great luxury only\r\nindulged in on grand occasions, when such other cherished delicacies as\r\n_gimakara_ (sugar) and _shelkara_ (lump white sugar) are also eaten. The\r\nTibetans are very fond of meat, though few can afford such an\r\nextravagance. Wild game, yak and sheep are considered excellent food, and\r\nthe meat and bone cut in pieces are boiled in a cauldron with lavish\r\nquantities of salt and pepper. The several people in a tent dip their\r\nhands into the pot, and having picked up suitable pieces, tug at them\r\nwith their teeth and fingers, grinding even the bone, meat eaten without\r\nbone being supposed to be difficult to digest.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan tents are usually furnished with a few _tildih_ (rough\r\nsitting-mats) round the fireplace, and near the entrance of the tent\r\nstands a _dahlo_, or basket, in which the dung is stored as collected.\r\nThese _dahlos_, used in couples, are very convenient for tying to\r\npack-saddles, for which purpose they are specially designed. Along the\r\nwalls of the tent are the _tsamgo_ or bags of _tsamba_, and the _dongmo_\r\nor butter-pots, and among masses of sheepskins and blankets can be seen\r\nthe little wooden chests in which the store of butter is kept under lock\r\nand key.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF A TENT]\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes the eye on entering a Tibetan tent is the\r\n_chokseh_ or table, upon which are lights and brass bowls containing\r\nofferings to the _Chogan_, the gilt god to whom the occupiers of the\r\n_gurr_ (tent) address their morning and evening prayers. Prayer-wheels\r\nand strings of beads are plentiful, and lashed upright to the poles are\r\nthe long matchlocks belonging to the men, their tall props projecting\r\nwell out of the aperture in the roof of the tent. Spears are kept in a\r\nsimilar manner, but the swords and smaller knives are carried about the\r\nperson all day, and laid on the ground by the side of their owners at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TSAMGO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL TSAMBA BAG, CARRIED ON THE PERSON BY TIBETANS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\n     Refusal to sell food--Women--Their looks and characteristics--The\r\n     _Tchukti_--A Lhassa lady.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE inhabitants of this encampment were polite and talkative.\r\nNotwithstanding their refusal to sell us food on the plea that they had\r\nnone even for themselves, their friendliness was so much beyond my\r\nexpectation that I at first feared treachery. However, treachery or not,\r\nI thought that while I was there I had better see and learn as much as I\r\ncould. Women and men formed a ring round us, and the fair sex seemed less\r\nshy than the stronger in answering questions. I was particularly struck,\r\nnot only in this encampment but in all the others, by the small number of\r\nwomen to be seen in Tibet. This is not because they are kept in\r\nseclusion; on the contrary, the ladies of the Forbidden Land seem to have\r\nit all their own way. They are actually in an enormous minority, the\r\nproportion being, at a rough guess, backed by the wise words of a\r\nfriendly Lama, from fifteen to twenty males to each female in the\r\npopulation; nevertheless, the fair sex in Hundes manages to rule the male\r\nmajority, playing thereby constantly into the hands of the Lamas.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan female, whether she be a lady, a shepherdess, or a\r\nbrigandess, cannot be said to be prepossessing. In fact, it was not my\r\nluck to see a single good-looking woman in the country, although I\r\nnaturally saw women who were less ugly than others. Anyhow, with the\r\naccumulated filth that from birth is undisturbed by soap, scrubbing or\r\nbathing; with nose, cheeks and forehead smeared with black ointment to\r\nprevent the skin cracking in the wind; and with the unpleasant odour that\r\nemanates from never-changed clothes, the Tibetan woman is, at her best,\r\nrepulsive to European taste. After one has overcome one\'s first disgust\r\nshe yet has, at a distance, a certain charm of her own. She walks well,\r\nfor she is accustomed to carry heavy weights on her head; and her skull\r\nwould be well-set on her shoulders were it not that the neck is usually\r\ntoo short and thick to be graceful. Her body and limbs possess great\r\nmuscular strength and are well developed, but generally lack stability,\r\nand her breasts are flabby and pendent--facts due, no doubt, to sexual\r\nabuse. She is generally of heavy frame, and rather inclined to stoutness.\r\nHer hands and feet show power and rude strength, but no dexterity or\r\nsuppleness is noticeable in her fingers, and she has therefore no ability\r\nfor very fine or delicate work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN HAIR BRUSHES AND FLINT AND STEEL POUCH]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan woman is, nevertheless, far superior to the Tibetan man. She\r\npossesses a better heart, more pluck, and a finer character than he does.\r\nTime after time, when the males, timid beyond all conception, ran away at\r\nour approach, the women remained in charge of the tents, and, although\r\nby no means cool or collected, they very rarely failed to meet us without\r\nsome show of dignity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN]\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, when all were friendly, the women seemed much\r\nless shy than the men, and conversed freely and incessantly. They even\r\nprevailed upon their masters to sell us a little _tsamba_ and butter.\r\n\r\nTibetan women wear trousers and boots like the men, and over them they\r\nhave a long gown, either yellow or blue, reaching down to their feet.\r\nTheir head-dress is curious, the hair being carefully parted in the\r\nmiddle, and plastered with melted butter over the scalp as far down as\r\nthe ears; then it is plaited all round in innumerable little tresses, to\r\nwhich is fastened the _Tchukti_, three strips of heavy red and blue cloth\r\njoined together by cross bands ornamented with coral and malachite beads,\r\nsilver coins and bells, and reaching from the shoulders down to the\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TCHUKTI]\r\n\r\nThey seemed very proud of this ornamentation, and displayed much coquetry\r\nin attracting our notice to it. Wealthier women in Tibet have quite a\r\nsmall fortune hanging down their backs, for all the money or valuables\r\nearned or saved are sewn on to the _Tchukti_. To the lower end of the\r\n_Tchukti_ one, two or three rows of small brass or silver bells are\r\nattached, and therefore the approach of the Tibetan dames is announced by\r\nthe tinkling of their bells, a quaint custom, the origin of which they\r\ncould not explain to me, beyond saying that it was pretty and that they\r\nliked it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LADY FROM LHASSA]\r\n\r\nThe illustration that I give here of a travelling Tibetan lady from\r\nLhassa was taken at Tucker. She wore her hair, of abnormal length and\r\nbeauty, in one huge tress, and round her head, like an aureole, was a\r\ncircular wooden ornament, on the outer part of which were fastened beads\r\nof coral, glass and malachite. The arrangement was so heavy that, though\r\nit fitted the head well, it had to be supported by means of strings tied\r\nto the hair and others passed over the head. By the side of her head, and\r\nhanging by the ears and hair, were a pair of huge silver earrings inlaid\r\nwith malachite, and round her neck three long strings of beads with\r\nsilver brooches.\r\n\r\nConsiderable modifications necessarily occurred in these garments and\r\nornaments, according to the locality and the wearer\'s condition in life,\r\nbut the general lines of their clothing were practically everywhere the\r\nsame. Often a loose silver chain belt was worn considerably below the\r\nwaist, and rings and bracelets were common everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONEY BAGS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n     Polyandry--Marriage ceremonies--Jealousy--Divorce--Identification\r\n     of children--Courtship--Illegitimacy--Adultery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT the Tibetans legally recognise polyandry and polygamy is well known.\r\nVery little, however, has hitherto transpired as to the actual form of\r\nthese marital customs, so that the details which follow, startling as\r\nthey may seem when regarded from a Western standpoint, will be found not\r\nwithout interest.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I may say that there is not such a thing known in Tibet as\r\na standard of morality amongst unmarried women of the middle classes;\r\nand, therefore, from a Tibetan point of view, it is not easy to find an\r\nimmoral woman. Notwithstanding this apparently irregular state of\r\naffairs, the women\'s behaviour is better than might be expected. Like the\r\nShoka girls, they possess a wonderful frankness and simplicity of manner,\r\nwith a certain reserve which has its allurements; for the Tibetan swain,\r\noften a young man, being attracted by the charms of a damsel, finds that\r\nhis flirtation with her has become an accepted engagement almost before\r\nit has begun, and is compelled, in accordance with custom, to go,\r\naccompanied by his father and mother, to the tent of the lady of his\r\nheart. There he is received by her relations, who have been previously\r\nnotified of the intended call, and are found seated on rugs and mats\r\nawaiting the arrival of their guests.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual courtesies and salutations, the young man\'s father asks,\r\non behalf of his son, for the young lady\'s hand; and, if the answer is\r\nfavourable, the suitor places a square lump of yak _murr_ (yak butter) on\r\nhis betrothed\'s forehead. She does the same for him, and the marriage\r\nceremony is then considered over, the buttered couple being man and\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nIf there is a temple close by, _Katas_, food and money are laid before\r\nthe images of Buddha and saints, and the parties walk round the inside of\r\nthe temple. Should there be no temple at hand, the husband and wife make\r\nthe circuit of the nearest hill, or, in default of anything else, the\r\ntent itself, always moving from left to right. This ceremony is repeated\r\nwith prayers and sacrifices every day for a fortnight, during which time\r\nlibations of wine and general feasting continue, and at the expiration of\r\nwhich the husband conveys his better half to his tent.\r\n\r\nThe law of Tibet, though hardly ever obeyed, has strict clauses\r\nregulating the conduct of married men in their marital relations. So long\r\nas the sun is above the horizon, no intercourse is permitted; and certain\r\nperiods and seasons of the year, such as the height of summer and the\r\ndepth of winter, are also proscribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN WHOSE FACE IS SMEARED WITH BLACK OINTMENT]\r\n\r\nA Tibetan girl on marrying does not enter into a nuptial tie with an\r\nindividual but with all his family, in the following somewhat complicated\r\nmanner. If an eldest son marries an eldest sister, all the sisters of the\r\nbride become his wives. Should he, however, begin by marrying the second\r\nsister, then only the sisters from the second down will be his property.\r\nIf the third, all from the third, and so on. At the same time, when the\r\nbridegroom has brothers, they are all regarded as their brother\'s wife\'s\r\nhusbands, and they one and all cohabit with her, as well as with her\r\nsisters if she has any.\r\n\r\nThe system is not simple, and certainly not very edifying, and were it\r\nnot for the odd _savoir faire_ of the Tibetan woman, it would lead to\r\nendless jealousies and unpleasantness: owing, however, largely, no doubt,\r\nto the absolute lack of honour or decency in Tibetan males and females,\r\nthe arrangement seems to work as satisfactorily as any other kind of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nI asked what would happen in the case of a man marrying a second sister,\r\nand so acquiring marital rights over all her younger sisters, if another\r\nman came and married her eldest sister. Would all the brides of the first\r\nman become the brides of the second? No, they would not; and the second\r\nman would have to be satisfied with only one wife. However, if the second\r\nsister were left a widow, and her husband had no brothers, then she would\r\nbecome the property of her eldest sister\'s husband, and with her all the\r\nother sisters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN WOMAN]\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from these strange matrimonial laws that jealousy\r\nis non-existent in Tibet among both men and women; trouble does\r\noccasionally arise in Tibetan house- or tent-holds. As, however, the\r\nTibetan woman is clever, she generally contrives to arrange things in a\r\nmanner conducive to peace. When her husband has several brothers, she\r\ndespatches them on different errands in every direction, to look after\r\nyaks or sheep, or to trade. Only one remains and he is for the time being\r\nher husband; then when another returns he has to leave his place and\r\nbecomes a bachelor, and so on, till all the brothers have, during the\r\nyear, had an equal period of marital life with their single wife.\r\n\r\nDivorce is difficult in Tibet and involves endless complications. I\r\ninquired of a Tibetan lady what would she do in case her husband refused\r\nto live with her any longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LADY IN QUESTION]\r\n\r\n"\'Why did you marry me?\' I would say to him," she exclaimed. "\'You found\r\nme good, beautiful, wise, clever, affectionate. Now prove that I am not\r\nall this!\'"\r\n\r\nThis modest speech, she thought, would be quite sufficient to bring any\r\nhusband back to reason, but all the same a number of Tibetans find it\r\nconvenient occasionally to desert their wives, eloping to some distant\r\nprovince, or over the boundary. This procedure is particularly hard on\r\nthe man\'s brothers, as they all remain the sole property of the abandoned\r\nbride. On the same principle, when a husband dies, the wife is inherited\r\nby his brothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN CHILDREN]\r\n\r\nA very painful case came before the court of the Jong Pen at Taklakot.\r\nThe husband of a Tibetan lady had died, and she, being enamoured of a\r\nhandsome youth some twenty years younger than herself, married him. Her\r\nhusband\'s brother, however, came all the way from Lhassa after her and\r\nclaimed her as his wife, though he had already a better half and a large\r\nfamily. She would not hear of leaving the husband of her choice, and\r\nafter endless scenes between them, the case was heard by the Jong Pen\r\nof Taklakot. The Tibetan law was against her, as, according to it, she\r\ndecidedly belonged to her brother-in-law; but money is stronger than the\r\nlaw in the land of the Lamas.\r\n\r\n"For the peace of all, you can arrange things this way," was the advice\r\nof the Jong Pen. "You can divide your property, money and goods, into\r\nthree equal parts: one to go to the Lamas, one to your husband\'s brother,\r\nand one to be retained by yourself."\r\n\r\nThe woman consented; but, much to her disgust, when two parts had been\r\npaid out and she was hoping for peace, a question was raised by the Jong\r\nPen as to why she should even retain one-third of the fortune if she no\r\nlonger made part of the deceased man\'s family? Thus orders were instantly\r\ngiven that she should be deprived of everything she possessed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the woman was shrewd enough to deceive the Jong Pen\'s officers,\r\nfor one night, having bundled up her tent and her goods and chattels, she\r\nquietly stepped over the boundary and placed herself under British\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe mode of knowing and identifying children in Tibet is peculiar. It is\r\nnot by the child\'s likeness to his parent, nor by other reasonable\r\nmethods, that the offspring is set down as belonging to one man more than\r\nto another, but this is the mode adopted. Supposing that one married man\r\nhad two brothers and several children, the first child belongs to him;\r\nthe second to his first brother, and the third to his second brother,\r\nwhile the fourth would be again the first man\'s child.\r\n\r\nThe rules of courtship are not very strict in Tibet, yet intercourse with\r\ngirls is looked upon as illegal, and in certain cases not only are the\r\nparties, if discovered, made to suffer shame, but certain fines are\r\ninflicted on the man, the most severe of all being that he must present\r\nthe young lady with a dress and ornaments. In the case of "gentlefolks"\r\nthe question is generally solved to the satisfaction of everybody by the\r\nman marrying the woman, and by his gracefully presenting "veils of\r\nfriendship" to all her relations and friends, together with articles of\r\nfood; but if by mischance she should be placed in an awkward position\r\nbefore the eyes of the world, and the man will not hear of a matrimonial\r\nunion, then efforts are made to prevent the birth of the child alive. If\r\nthese are not successful, the mother must be maintained until after the\r\nchild\'s birth. In such cases the illegitimate child remains the man\'s,\r\nand suffers the usual indignities of illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nSixteen in the case of women, and eighteen or nineteen in that of men, is\r\nregarded as the marriageable age. Motherhood continues until a fairly\r\nadvanced age, and I have seen a woman of forty with a baby only a few\r\nmonths old. But, as a rule, Tibetan women lose their freshness while\r\nstill quite young; and no doubt their custom of polyandry not only\r\ncontributes to destroy their looks but also is the chief cause that\r\nlimits the population of Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas are supposed to live in celibacy, but they do not always keep\r\nto their oath, tempted, no doubt, by the fact that they themselves\r\ninvariably go unpunished. If, on the other hand, in cases of adultery,\r\nthe culprit be a layman, he has to pay compensation according to his\r\nmeans to the husband, the amount being fixed by the parties concerned and\r\ntheir friends, or by the law if applied for.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases of marital trespass, presents of clothing, _tsamba,\r\nchura, guram, kassur_ (dried fruit) and wine, accompanied by the\r\nnever-lacking _Kata_, are sufficient to allay the injured husband\'s anger\r\nand to fully compensate him for any shame suffered.\r\n\r\nThe only serious punishment inflicted is, however, in the case of the\r\nwife of a high official eloping with a man of low rank. Then the woman is\r\nsubjected to flogging as a penalty for her infidelity, her husband is\r\ndisgraced, and her lover, after being subjected to a painful surgical\r\noperation, is, if he survives, expelled from the town or encampment.\r\n\r\nHigh officials, and a few wealthy people who are not satisfied with one\r\nwife, are allowed by the law of the land to keep as many concubines as\r\ntheir means allow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\n     Tibetan funerals--Disposal of their dead--By cremation--By\r\n     water--Cannibalism--Strange beliefs--Revolting\r\n     barbarity--Drinking human blood--The saints of Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIBETAN funerals are interesting, but they so closely resemble those of\r\nthe Shokas, which I have described at length, that any detailed account\r\nof them would be a mere repetition of what I have already written.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A YOUNG LAMA]\r\n\r\nFor the disposal of the dead body itself, however, the Tibetans have\r\ncurious customs of their own. The most uncommon method, owing to the\r\ngreat scarcity of fuel, is that of cremation, which is only employed in\r\nthe case of wealthy people or Lamas, and is effected in exactly the same\r\nfashion as among the Shokas. Another and more usual plan is to double up\r\nthe body, sew it into skins, and let it be carried away by the current of\r\na stream. But the commonest method of all is the revolting ceremony which\r\nI now proceed to describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RED LAMA]\r\n\r\nThe body of the deceased is borne to the top of a hill, where the Lamas\r\npronounce certain incantations and prayers. Then the crowd, after walking\r\nseven times round the body, retire to a certain distance, to allow ravens\r\nand dogs to tear the corpse to pieces. It is considered lucky for the\r\ndeparted and his family when birds alone devour the greater portion of\r\nthe body; dogs and wild animals come, say the Lamas, when the deceased\r\nhas sinned during his life. Anyhow, the almost complete destruction of\r\nthe corpse is anxiously watched, and, at an opportune moment, the Lamas\r\nand crowd, turning their praying-wheels, and muttering the everlasting\r\n"_Omne mani padme hun_," return to the body, round which seven more\r\ncircuits are made, moving from left to right.[25] Then the relatives\r\nsquat round. The Lamas sit near the body, and with their daggers cut to\r\npieces what remains of the flesh. The highest Lama present eats the\r\nfirst morsel, then, muttering prayers, the other Lamas partake of it,\r\nafter which all the relations and friends throw themselves on the now\r\nalmost denuded skeleton, scraping off pieces of flesh, which they devour\r\ngreedily; and this repast of human flesh continues till the bones are dry\r\nand clean!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUP MADE OF HUMAN SKULL]\r\n\r\nThe idea of this ghastly ceremony is that the spirit of the departed, of\r\nwhom you have swallowed a piece, will for ever keep on friendly terms\r\nwith you. When birds and dogs do not shrink from feeding, it is a sign\r\nthat the body is healthy, and fit for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOKDEN, OR TOMB OF A SAINT]\r\n\r\nRevolting beyond words is the further fact that, when a man has died of\r\nsome pestilential disease, and, owing to the odour, the birds will not\r\npeck at the body, nor will the famished dogs go near it, then a large\r\nnumber of Lamas, having made the usual exorcisms, sit down by it, and do\r\nnot get up again until they have devoured the whole of the rotten human\r\nflesh! The relatives and friends are wiser and less brutal. They rightly\r\nbelieve that, if voracious animals will not partake of the meal proffered\r\nthem, it is because the body is that of a sinner against whom God is\r\nangry. And who better than the Lamas could make peace between God and\r\nhim? So let the Lamas eat it all.\r\n\r\nIn the case of not finding sufficient Lamas to perform these rites, the\r\nbody is either disposed of by throwing it into the water, or else, the\r\nrelations having first partaken of a morsel of the flesh, it is bound to\r\na rock to let animals or time do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas are said to have a great craving for human blood, which, they\r\nsay, gives them strength, genius and vigour. When sucking wounds that are\r\nnot poisoned, they drink the blood, and also on certain occasions wounds\r\nare inflicted for the sake of sucking the blood. At other times the cups\r\ncut from human skulls, found in all monasteries, are filled with blood,\r\nand the Lamas in turn satisfy their thirst out of them.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. It is sickening to set it down, though my book would\r\nbe incomplete if I had made no mention of the cannibalism of the Lamas.\r\n\r\nWhen a saintly Lama dies, or some old man much respected by the\r\ncommunity, either parts of the flesh, or, if cremation has been applied,\r\nsome of his ashes, are preserved and placed in a _Chokden_ erected for\r\nthe purpose; and, judging by the number of these structures one finds all\r\nover Tibet, one feels inclined to think that half the population of the\r\ncountry must have been saints, or else that the standard of saintliness\r\nin the sacred land of the Lamas is not prohibitively high.\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] In the case of a sect called Bombos, the circuits are made in the\r\nreverse fashion, as also are their prayer-wheels turned from right to\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\n     Another commotion--Two hundred soldiers--A stampede--Easy\r\n     travelling--A long _Mani_ wall--Mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING out of our tent in the morning, we noticed an unusual commotion\r\namong the Tibetans. A number of mounted men with matchlocks had arrived,\r\nand others similarly armed immediately went to join them from the tents.\r\nThey seemed excited, and I kept my eye upon them while I was cooking my\r\nfood. There were some two hundred in all, picturesquely garbed. They\r\nseemed to be good horsemen, and looked well as they rode in a line\r\ntowards us. A little way off they stopped and dismounted, and the leaders\r\ncame forward, one stalwart fellow in a fine sheepskin coat marching ahead\r\nof the rest. His attitude was very arrogant, and, dispensing with the\r\nusual salutations, he approached quite close, shaking his fist at me.\r\n\r\n"_Kiu mahla lokhna nga rah luck tiba tangan_" ("I will give you a goat or\r\na sheep if you will go back"), he said.\r\n\r\n"_Kiu donna nga di tangon_" ("And I give you this to make you go back!")\r\nwas my quick answer, while I unexpectedly administered him one straight\r\nfrom the shoulder that sent him flat on his back and sprawling on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe army, which, with its usual prudence, was watching events from a\r\nrespectful distance, beat a hasty retreat. The officer, though unhurt,\r\nscrambled away, screaming. The Tibetans had so far behaved with such\r\ncontemptible cowardice that we could hardly congratulate ourselves on\r\nsuch easy successes. We began to feel that really we had no enemy at all\r\nbefore us, and very likely we became even careless. Anyhow, we ate our\r\nfood and gave this affair but little thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MANI WALL ON THE ROAD TO LHASSA]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans kept their distance, and did not trouble us again that day.\r\nThose who had not ridden off retired timidly inside their black tents,\r\nand not a soul was to be seen about the encampment--which might have been\r\ndeserted, so silent and so empty did it appear. I registered my daily\r\nobservations, made a sketch of one of the black tents, and wrote up my\r\ndiary; after which we raised camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AND I GIVE YOU THIS TO MAKE YOU GO BACK"]\r\n\r\nOur progress was now comparatively easy, along a broad grassy plain, and\r\nwe proceeded without further disturbance in a South-easterly direction,\r\nobserving a high snowy peak at 20 deg. (b.m.), and a low pass in the mountain\r\nrange to our North-east at 55 deg. (b.m.). A very high range stood ahead of\r\nus in the far distance, with low hills between. In going round one of\r\nthese lonely hills we found at the foot of it another and more important\r\n_mani_ wall of some length, with numberless inscriptions of all ages and\r\nsizes on stones, pieces of bone, skulls and horns. Farther on, to the\r\nSouth, there were three smaller hillocks and two larger ones. The\r\nsoldiers we had routed at the encampment had proceeded in the direction\r\nwe were now following, and we were, in fact, treading all along on the\r\nfootprints of their ponies.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross a river and a number of rivulets, and so troublesome was\r\nit each time to take off one\'s shoes and clothes to wade through, that\r\nwe bundled up our clothes on the yaks, and travelled along for the rest\r\nof the afternoon bare-footed and with nothing on but a _doti_\r\n(loin-cloth), in the style adopted by fakirs.\r\n\r\nIn an arc of a circle from 120 deg. to 180 deg. (b.m.) we noticed very low hills,\r\nand from 160 deg. to 220 deg., some thirty or forty miles off, could be seen much\r\nmore clearly now the high range we had observed before. The sun was\r\nextremely hot, the ground marshy, the air being thick with huge and very\r\ntroublesome mosquitoes. We were quickly covered from head to foot with\r\nbites, and the irritation caused by them was intense. Halting on the\r\nright bank of a large stream at 15,600 feet, we named this spot Mosquito\r\nCamp. At sunset the number of mosquitoes around us was such as to drive\r\nus nearly mad, but fortunately, the moment the sun disappeared, the\r\nthermometer fell to 33 deg., and we had a peaceful night.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we saw a number of horsemen riding full speed on a course\r\nabout one mile south of ours, but converging to the same direction. No\r\ndoubt they were sent to keep the authorities ahead well informed of our\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\n     Washing-day--A long march--_Kiang_ and antelope--Benighted--The\r\n     purchase of a goat--Ramifications of the Brahmaputra--A\r\n     detour--Through a swamp--Mansing again lost and found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next was for us a great washing-day. The water of the stream was so\r\npleasant and clear that we could not resist the temptation of having a\r\nregular cleaning up, washing first our clothing and spreading it to dry\r\nin the sun, and then cleansing our faces and bodies thoroughly with soap,\r\na luxury unknown to us for ever so long.\r\n\r\nWhile I was drying myself in the sun--owing to the want of towels--I\r\nregistered at 211 deg. (b.m.) a very high snowy peak, and a lower one at 213 deg.\r\n30\' forming part of the chain before us. There were mountains on every\r\nside of the plain we were traversing; and another very elevated peak, of\r\nwhich I had taken bearings on a previous occasion, was at 20 deg. (b.m.). A\r\nbreak occurred in the hill range to our North-east, showing a narrow\r\nvalley, beyond which were high snowy mountains. We made a very long march\r\nalong the grassy plain, going to 147 deg. (b.m.), and encamped on the bank of\r\nthe Brahmaputra, here already a wide, deep and very rapid stream. We had\r\npassed hundreds of _kiang_ and antelopes, and shortly before sunset I\r\ntook a walk to the hills to try and bring some fresh meat to camp. I\r\nstalked a herd of antelopes, and having gone some five miles from camp, I\r\nwas benighted, and on my return had the greatest difficulty in finding my\r\nmen in the darkness. They had been unable to light a fire, and as they\r\nhad both gone fast asleep, I received no answer to my calls. We had\r\nselected a sheltered depression in the ground for our camp, and there\r\nbeing hundreds of similar spots everywhere round it, and no landmarks to\r\ngo by, it was by no means easy to identify the exact place.\r\n\r\nFortunately, at last, after I had shouted for some considerable time,\r\nChanden Sing heard me, and, by the sound of his voice, I found my way\r\nback. In the morning we noticed a large encampment about a mile off on\r\nthe opposite bank of the Brahmaputra, where we might have obtained\r\nprovisions, but the stream was too rapid for us to cross; moreover, we\r\nsaw black tents in every direction on our side of the water, and\r\ntherefore there was no reason to go to the extra trouble and danger of\r\ncrossing the stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIANG]\r\n\r\nMuch to our delight, we succeeded in purchasing a goat from some passing\r\nTibetans, who drove before them a flock of several thousand heads, and,\r\nas we could not find sufficient dry fuel to make a fire, we entrusted\r\nMansing with the safe-conduct of the animal to our next camp, where we\r\nproposed to feast on it.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmaputra had here several ramifications mostly ending in lakelets,\r\nand rendering the plain a regular swamp. The larger branch was very wide\r\nand deep, and we preferred following it to crossing it, notwithstanding\r\nthat we had to deviate somewhat from the course which I would have\r\notherwise followed. We thus made a considerable _detour_, but even as it\r\nwas, for several miles we sank in mud up to our knees, or waded through\r\nwater, for although there were small patches of earth with tufts of grass\r\nwhich rose above the water, they collapsed on our attempting to stand\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Northern part of the plain was extremely marshy. Our\r\nyaks gave us no end of trouble, for when they sank unexpectedly in soft\r\nmud-holes, they became restless and alarmed, and in their struggles to\r\nsave themselves, once or twice shook off their pack-saddles and loads,\r\nwhich we had not been able to fasten properly for want of ropes. Chanden\r\nSing and I, however, managed to keep up with them, and at last, on\r\nnearing the hills, the ground showed greater undulations and was rather\r\ndrier. We saw columns of smoke rising from near the foot of the range to\r\nthe North of us. We went on another couple of miles, exhausted and dirty,\r\nour clothes, which we had spent so much soap and time in washing, filthy\r\nwith splashes of mud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR YAKS SINKING IN MUD]\r\n\r\n"Where are Mansing and the _rabbu?_"[26] I asked of my bearer.\r\n\r\n"He remained behind at the beginning of the swamp. He was too exhausted\r\nto drag along the goat you purchased."\r\n\r\nI was much concerned, on scouting the country all round from a hillock\r\nwith my telescope, to see no signs of the poor fellow, and I was angry\r\nwith myself for not noticing his disappearance before. As there were many\r\nTibetans about the spot where he had remained, I feared foul play on\r\ntheir part, and that he might have been overpowered. Again I imagined\r\nthat, weak as he was, he might have been sucked down in one of the deeper\r\nmud-holes, without a chance of saving himself. I left Chanden Sing to\r\nlook after the yaks and turned back in search of him. As I hurried back\r\nmile after mile, struggling again half across the mud swamp, and yet saw\r\nno signs of the poor coolie, I was almost giving up my quest in despair,\r\nwhen my eye caught something moving about half a mile farther on. It was\r\nthe goat all by itself. I made for it with a sinking heart.\r\n\r\nIt was only on getting quite close to it that I perceived the poor\r\ncoolie, lying flat and half sunk in the mud. He had fallen in a faint,\r\nand though he was still breathing, he was quite insensible. Fortunately\r\nhe had taken the precaution of tying the rope of the _rabbu_ tight round\r\nhis arm, and thus not only was it owing to the animal that I had found\r\nhis whereabouts, but I had also saved our precious acquisition. With some\r\nrubbing and shaking I brought the poor fellow back to life, and supported\r\nhim by the arm until we rejoined Chanden Sing. Not till the middle of the\r\nnight did we reach Tarbar, a large Tibetan encampment at the foot of the\r\nhill range.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] The Tibetans have three distinct kinds of goats: the _rabbu_, or\r\nlarge woolly animal, such as the one I had purchased; the _ratton_, or\r\nsmall goat; and the _chitbu_, a dwarf goat whose flesh is delicious\r\neating. The _rabbu_ and _ratton_ are the two kinds generally used for\r\ncarrying loads, and they have sufficient strength to bear a weight not\r\nexceeding 40 lbs. for a distance of from five to eight miles daily over\r\nfairly good ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\n     The alarm given--Our bad manners--A peaceful settlement--A large\r\n     river--Gigantic peak--Again on marshy soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE alarm of our arrival, given first by scores of dogs barking at us,\r\nthen by one of the natives who had ventured to leave his tent to find out\r\nthe cause of the disturbance, created the usual panic in the place.\r\n\r\n"_Gigri duk! gigri duk! Jogpa, Jogpa!_" ("Danger, danger; help,\r\nbrigands!") cried the Tibetan, running frantically out of his tent; and a\r\nfew seconds later, black figures could be seen everywhere, rushing in and\r\nout of their tents in a state of confusion. It must be remembered that,\r\naccording to the manners of Tibet, one should time one\'s arrival at an\r\nencampment so as to reach it before sundown, unless notice of one\'s\r\napproach is sent ahead. People who arrive unexpectedly in the middle of\r\nthe night are never credited with good motives, and their appearance is\r\nassociated with all sorts of evil intentions, murder, robbery or\r\nextortion. I tried to set the minds of the good folk at ease, by stating\r\nthat I meant no harm; but such was their excitement and confusion that I\r\ncould get no one to listen to me.\r\n\r\nTwo old women came to us with a bucket of milk and laid it at my feet,\r\nentreating me to spare their lives; and great was their astonishment\r\nwhen, instead of finding themselves murdered, they received a silver\r\nrupee in payment. This was the first step towards a peaceful settlement\r\nof the disturbance. After some time, calm was restored and, though still\r\nregarded with considerable suspicion, we were politely treated by the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, here too we were unable to purchase provisions, the\r\nnatives declaring that they had not sufficient for themselves. So, having\r\nfeasted on the _rabbu_ which we killed, and on yak\'s milk, we made\r\npreparations to strike camp early next morning.\r\n\r\nAt night the thermometer fell to 26 deg., and the cold was very great; but we\r\npurchased a quantity of dung from the natives and made a fine fire in the\r\nmorning; and, having had a good meal after several days\' privations, we\r\nfelt happier than usual. The natives begged as ever, showing their\r\nunrestrained craving for money, to get which they would lower themselves\r\nto anything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPENTER AND SADDLE-MAKER]\r\n\r\nNorth-west of the encampment, through a gorge, flowed a wide river which\r\nskirted the foot of the mountains. It was snow-fed, for in the evening\r\nthe current was strong and deep, whereas early in the morning the level\r\nof the water was several feet lower, being, however, even then hardly\r\nfordable. On leaving Tarbar, we followed for a while the course of the\r\nriver, and, the day being glorious, we were able to admire fully the\r\nmagnificent panorama of the great rugged mountain-range to our\r\nSouth-west. The higher peaks were nearly all of a pyramidical shape, and\r\nat 226 deg. 30\' (b.m.) I observed a gigantic quadrangular peak which I took\r\nto be Mount Everest. Next to it, at 225 deg. 30\' (b.m.), is a pyramidical\r\npeak, very lofty, but not to be compared in height or beauty to its\r\nneighbour. I followed a general course towards 120 deg. (b.m.), and as the\r\nriver, which we had more or less followed, now described a big bend\r\ntowards the S.S.E., I decided to cross it. We waded through it\r\nsuccessfully with water up to our necks, and again we found ourselves\r\nupon marshy land, with a repetition of the previous day\'s experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD WOMAN]\r\n\r\nFarther on, we crossed three more tributaries of the larger stream, all\r\nfairly wide and deep; and then we had once more to get across the main\r\nriver, now of such depth and rapidity as to cause us much trouble and no\r\nsmall danger. The river traverses the plain in zigzag fashion, and,\r\nunless we wanted to follow its banks, and so lengthen the journey by\r\ndouble or treble the distance, this was the only course open to us. Thus,\r\nwhile trying to travel in a straight line, we found ourselves for the\r\nthird time confronted by this great river, now swollen by other snow-fed\r\nstreams, and carrying an immense body of water. It was in the afternoon,\r\ntoo, when the water was at its highest. We attempted a crossing at\r\nseveral points, but found it impossible; so I made up my mind to wait for\r\nlow water early next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\n     Another Tibetan encampment--Uncontrollable animals--A big\r\n     stream--Washed away--In dreadful suspense--Rescuing the\r\n     yak--Diving at great altitudes and its effects--How my two\r\n     followers got across--A precarious outlook and a little comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONTRIVANCE FOR CARRYING LOADS]\r\n\r\nAPPARENTLY my yaks knew this part of the country well; and I noticed\r\nthat, whenever I lost the track, all I had to do was to follow them, and\r\nthey would bring me back to it again. Even when I drove them away from\r\nthe track, they showed a great disinclination to move, whereas they\r\nproceeded willingly enough while we were on the high road, which, mark\r\nyou, is no road at all, for no track is visible except here and there,\r\nwhere the footprints of the last nomads with their sheep, ponies and yaks\r\nhave destroyed the grass.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile on the other side of the river was an encampment of some\r\nfifty or sixty tents, with hundreds of yaks and sheep grazing near it.\r\n\r\nAt this point my two yaks, which I noticed had been marching with more\r\nthan usual smartness, bolted while I was ordering Chanden Sing and\r\nMansing to take down the loads, and went straight into the water.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to make them turn back, Mansing threw a stone at them,\r\nwhich, however, only sent them on all the faster. The current was so\r\nstrong, and the bottom of the river so soft, that they both sank, and\r\nwhen they reappeared on the surface it was only to float rapidly away\r\ndown stream. We watched them with ever-increasing anxiety, for they\r\nseemed quite helpless. We ran panting along the river bank, urging them\r\non with shouts to drive them to the other side. Alas, in their desperate\r\nstruggle to keep afloat, and powerless against the current, the two yaks\r\ncollided violently in mid-stream, and the bump caused the pack-saddle and\r\nloads of the smaller yak to turn over. The animal, thus overbalanced and\r\nhampered, sank and reappeared two or three times, struggling for air and\r\nlife. It was, indeed, a terrible moment. I threw off my clothes and\r\njumped into the water. I swam fast to the animal, and, with no small\r\nexertion, pulled him on shore, some two hundred yards farther down the\r\nstream. We were both safe, though breathless, but, alas! the ropes that\r\nheld the baggage had given way, and saddle and loads had disappeared.\r\nThis loss was a dreadful blow to us. I tried hard, by repeatedly diving\r\ninto the river, until I was almost frozen, to recover my goods, but\r\nfailed to find them or even to locate them. Where I suspected them to be\r\nthe water was over twenty feet deep, and the bottom of the river was of\r\nsoft mud; so that the weight of the loads would have caused them to sink\r\nand be covered over with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESCUING A YAK]\r\n\r\nDiving at such very great elevations gave one a peculiar and unpleasant\r\nsensation. The moment I was entirely under water, I felt as if I were\r\ncompressed under an appalling weight which seemed to crush me. Had the\r\nliquid above and around me been a mass of lead instead of water, it\r\ncould not have felt heavier. The sensation was especially noticeable in\r\nmy head, which felt as if my skull were being screwed into a vice. The\r\nbeating at my temples was so strong that, though in ordinary\r\ncircumstances I can remain under water for over a minute, I could there\r\nnever bold out for longer than fifteen or twenty seconds. Each time that\r\nI emerged from below, gasping for air, my heart beat alarmingly hard, and\r\nmy lungs seemed as if about to burst.\r\n\r\nI was so exhausted that I did not feel equal to conveying across my two\r\nmen, so I unloaded the stronger yak, and then, with endless fatigue, I\r\ndrove him and his mate again into the water. Unhampered, and good\r\nswimmers as they are, they floated away with the current and reached the\r\nother side. Chanden Sing and Mansing, with their clothes and mine tied\r\ninto a bundle over their shoulders, got on the animals and, after a\r\nsomewhat anxious passage, they arrived safely on my side, where we\r\ncamped, my men mourning all night over the lost property. The next\r\nmorning I made fresh attempts to recover the loads, but in vain!\r\nUnhappily they contained all my tinned provisions, and what little other\r\nfood I had, and they had in them besides eight hundred rupees in silver,\r\nthe greater part of my ammunition, changes of clothing and three pairs of\r\nshoes, my copper hurricane lantern, and sundry knives and razors.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we recovered was the pack-saddle, which was washed ashore\r\nsome six hundred yards farther down. Our situation can be summed up in a\r\nfew words. We were now in the centre of Tibet, with no food of any kind,\r\nno clothes to speak of, and no boots or shoes, except those we wore,\r\nwhich were falling to pieces. What little ammunition I had left could not\r\nbe relied upon, owing to its having been in the water on several\r\noccasions; and round us we had nothing but enemies--insignificant enemies\r\nif you like, yet enemies for all that.\r\n\r\nI got what comfort I could out of the knowledge that at least the\r\nwater-tight cases with my scientific instruments, notes, sketches and\r\nmaps were saved, and as far as I was concerned, I valued them more than\r\nanything else I possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\n     Hungry and worn--A sense of humour--Two buckets of milk--No food\r\n     to be obtained--Chanden Sing and Mansing in a wretched\r\n     state--Their fidelity--Exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE went on, hungry, worn out, with our feet lacerated, cheering one\r\nanother as best we could. We laughed at our troubles; we laughed at the\r\nTibetans and their comical ways; we laughed at everything and everybody,\r\nuntil eventually we even laughed at ourselves. When you are hungry, the\r\nsun seems slow at describing its daily semicircle from East to West; yet\r\nthough involuntary fasting gives you at first an acute pain in the\r\nstomach, it doesn\'t become unbearable until after several days\' absolute\r\nwant of food; that is to say, if you are in a way accustomed, as we were,\r\nto extra long intervals between one meal and the next. When we got to our\r\nthird day\'s fasting we were keen enough for a meal; and, perceiving some\r\nblack tents close by the mountain side, about four miles out of our\r\ncourse, we made for them with hungry haste. We purchased two bucketsful\r\nof yaks\' milk, one of which I drank there and then myself, the second\r\nbeing equally divided between my two servants. That was all we could get.\r\nThey would sell us absolutely nothing else.\r\n\r\nAfter this we moved forward again, making steady, and, if one allows for\r\nthe great elevation we were at, comparatively rapid progress; noting down\r\neverything, and holding our own against all comers. We encountered\r\npleasant people, and some unpleasant ones, but, whether their manner was\r\ncourteous or the reverse, we could nowhere obtain food for love or money.\r\n\r\nPoor Mansing and Chanden Sing, not having the same interest that I had in\r\nmy work to keep up their spirits, were now in a dreadful condition. Cold,\r\ntired and starved, the poor wretches had hardly strength left to stand\r\non their feet, the soles of which were badly cut and very sore. It really\r\nmade my heart bleed to see these two brave fellows suffer as they did for\r\nmy sake; and yet no word of complaint came from them; not once did their\r\nlips utter a reproach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRINKING OUT OF A BUCKET]\r\n\r\n"Never, mind if we suffer or even die," said the poor fellows, when I\r\nexpressed my sympathy with them, "we will follow you as long as we have\r\nstrength to move, and we will stand by you, no matter what happens."\r\n\r\nI had to relieve Chanden Sing of his rifle, as he was no longer able to\r\ncarry it. I myself, too, felt languid and exhausted as the days went by,\r\nand we got scarcely any food. I cannot say that I experienced any very\r\nsevere physical pain. This was due, I think, to the fact that my\r\nexhaustion brought on fever. I had, nevertheless, a peculiar feeling in\r\nmy head, as if my intellect, never too bright, had now been altogether\r\ndulled. My hearing, too, became less acute; and I felt my strength slowly\r\ndying down like the flame of a lamp with no more oil in it. The nervous\r\nexcitement and strain alone kept me alive, and I went on walking\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHRINE INSIDE TENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\n     Eighty black tents--Starved--Kindly natives--Presents--Ando and\r\n     his promises--A friendly Lama--A low pass--My plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE reached an encampment of some eighty black tents and a mud\r\nguard-house. We were positively in a starved condition and it was utterly\r\nimpossible to proceed farther, owing to the wretched condition of my two\r\nmen. They begged to be given ponies to ride, for their feet were so sore\r\nthat, notwithstanding their anxiety to follow me, they could not.\r\n\r\nThe natives received us very kindly, and, on my applying for them,\r\nconsented to sell me ponies, clothes and provisions. We encamped about\r\ntwo miles beyond the settlement, and during the evening several persons\r\nvisited my tent, bringing gifts of flour, butter and _tsamba_,\r\naccompanied by _Katas_, the veils of friendship. I made a point of\r\ninvariably giving the Tibetans, in return for their gifts, silver money\r\nto an amount three or four times greater than the value of the articles\r\nthey presented us with, and they professed to be very grateful for it. A\r\nman called Ando, who styled himself a Gourkha, but wore the garb of the\r\nTibetans, came to visit us in our tent, and promised to bring for sale\r\nseveral ponies the next morning. He also undertook to sell me a\r\nsufficient quantity of food to enable us to reach Lhassa, and, to show\r\nhis good faith, brought a portion of the supplies in the evening, and\r\nsaid he would let us have the remainder the next morning.\r\n\r\nWe next had a visit from a Lama, who appeared both civil and intelligent,\r\nand who presented us with some butter and _chura_ (cheese). He had\r\ntravelled in India, he told us, as far as Calcutta, and was on his way\r\nfrom Gartok to Lhassa, where he expected to arrive in four or five days,\r\nhaving an excellent pony. Other Lamas and men who came to see us stated\r\nthat they had come from Lhassa in that time, and I do not think that they\r\ncan have been far wrong, as the whole distance from the Lippu Pass on the\r\nfrontier (near Garbyang) to Lhassa can on horseback be covered in sixteen\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUD GUARD-HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThe natives, as usual, showed great reticence in letting out the name of\r\nthe encampment, some calling it Toxem, others Taddju. North of us was a\r\nlow pass in the hill range, and having already seen as much as I wanted\r\nof the Tibetans, it was my intention, if I succeeded in purchasing\r\nprovisions and ponies, to cross over this pass and proceed towards the\r\nSacred City, following a course on the northern side of the mountain\r\nrange. Besides, the highway to Lhassa was getting so thickly populated\r\nthat I thought it advisable to travel through less inhabited regions. I\r\nintended proceeding, dressed as a European, until within a few miles of\r\nLhassa. Then I would leave my two men concealed in some secluded spot,\r\nand assuming a disguise, I would penetrate alone during the night into\r\nthe city. This would have been easy enough, as Lhassa has no gates, and\r\nonly a ruined wall round it.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in purchasing some clothing and boots from the Tibetans, and\r\nthe pigtail that I needed to make me pass for a Tibetan I intended to\r\nmake myself, out of the silky hair of my yaks. To avoid betraying myself\r\nby my inability to speak Tibetan fluently, I thought of pretending to be\r\ndeaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nA good meal brought hope and high spirits, and when I retired to sleep I\r\nsaw myself already inside the sacred walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN BELLOWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n     Strange noises--Ando the traitor--Purchasing provisions and\r\n     ponies--A handsome pony--Decoyed away from my tent and\r\n     rifles--Pounced upon--The fight--A prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DISTAFF]\r\n\r\nDURING the night I was aroused several times by noises, and I went out of\r\nmy tent to look for the disturbers, but failed to discover any one. This\r\nhad become my nightly experience, and I attached very little importance\r\nto these sounds.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Ando and two or three Tibetans came to sell us provisions\r\nand ponies, and, while my two servants and I were engaged in purchasing\r\nwhat we required, I saw a number of villagers coming up in groups. Some\r\nspun their wool, others carried bags of _tsamba_ and flour, while others\r\nstill arrived leading a number of fine ponies. Having purchased\r\nprovisions to last us a couple of months, we now began the selection of\r\nmounts, and naturally my servants and myself were overjoyed at our\r\nunexpected piece of luck in finding ourselves, after untold sufferings\r\nand privations of all kinds, confronted with abundance of everything we\r\ncould possibly desire. The demeanour of the Tibetans was so friendly, and\r\nthey seemed so guileless, that I never thought of suspecting them.\r\nChanden Sing and Mansing, who at bottom were sportsmen of the very first\r\norder, delighted at the prospect of getting animals, rode first one pony\r\nand then another to suit themselves; and Chanden Sing, having selected a\r\nhandsome beast for his own use, called me to try it and examine it before\r\npaying over the purchase-money. Unsuspecting of foul play, and also\r\nbecause it would not be convenient to try the various lively ponies\r\nwith my rifle slung over my shoulder, I walked unarmed to the spot, about\r\na hundred yards away from my tent, where the restless animal was being\r\nheld for my inspection. The natives followed behind me, but such a thing\r\nbeing common in any country when one buys a horse in public, I thought\r\nnothing of it. As I stood with my hands behind my back, I well recollect\r\nthe expression of delight on Chanden Sing\'s face when I approved of his\r\nchoice, and, as is generally the case on such occasions, the crowd behind\r\nin a chorus expressed their gratuitous opinion on the superiority of the\r\nsteed selected. I had just stooped to look at the pony\'s fore-legs, when\r\nI was suddenly seized from behind by several persons, who grabbed me by\r\nthe neck, wrists, and legs, and threw me down on my face. I struggled and\r\nfought until I shook off some of my assailants and regained my feet; but\r\nothers rushed up, and I was surrounded by some thirty men, who attacked\r\nme from every side, and clinging to me with all their might succeeded in\r\ngrabbing my arms, legs and head. Weak as I was, they knocked me down\r\nthree more times, and three more times I regained my feet. I fought to\r\nthe bitter end with my fists, feet, head and teeth each time that I got\r\none hand or leg free from their clutches, hitting right and left at any\r\npart where I could disable my opponents. Their timidity, even when in\r\nsuch overwhelming numbers, was indeed beyond description; and it was\r\nentirely due to it, and not to my strength (for I had hardly any), that I\r\nwas able to hold my own against them for some twenty minutes. My clothes\r\nwere torn in the fight. Long ropes were thrown at me from every side, and\r\nI became so entangled in them that my movements were impeded. One rope\r\nwhich they flung and successfully twisted round my neck completed their\r\nvictory. They pulled hard at it from the two ends, and while I panted and\r\ngasped with the exertion of fighting, they tugged and tugged to strangle\r\nme, till I felt as if my eyes would shoot out of their sockets. I was\r\nsuffocating. My sight became dim, and I was in their power. Dragged down\r\nto the ground, they stamped, and kicked, and trampled upon me with their\r\nheavy nailed boots, until I was stunned. Then they tied my wrists tightly\r\nbehind my back; they bound my elbows, my chest, my neck and my ankles. I\r\nwas a prisoner!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURCHASING PONIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I WAS A PRISONER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROPE RIDING-WHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n     Chanden Sing\'s plucky resistance--Mansing secured--A signal--A\r\n     treacherous Lama--Confiscation of baggage--Watches, compasses and\r\n     aneroids--Fear and avidity--The air-cushion--Dragged into the\r\n     encampment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARRING WORN BY HIGH OFFICIALS]\r\n\r\nTHEY lifted me and made me stand up. The brave Chanden Sing had been\r\nstruggling with all his might against fifteen or twenty foes, and had\r\ndisabled several of them. He had been pounced upon at the same moment as\r\nI was, and had fought gallantly until, like myself, he had been\r\nentangled, thrown down and secured by ropes. During my struggle, I heard\r\nhim call out repeatedly: "_Banduk, banduk, Mansing; jaldi, banduk!_"\r\n("Rifle, rifle, Mansing; quick, my rifle!") but, alas, poor Mansing the\r\nleper, the weak and jaded coolie, had been sprung upon by four powerful\r\nTibetans, who held him pinned to the ground as if he had been the\r\nfiercest of bandits. Mansing was a philosopher. He had saved himself the\r\ntrouble of even offering any resistance; but he too, was ill-treated,\r\nbeaten and tightly bound. At the beginning of the fight a shrill whistle\r\nhad brought up four hundred[27] armed soldiers who had lain in ambush\r\nround us, concealed behind the innumerable sandhills and in the\r\ndepressions in the ground. They took up a position round us and covered\r\nus with their matchlocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGGED INTO THE SETTLEMENT]\r\n\r\nAll was now over, and, bound like a dangerous criminal, I looked round\r\nto see what had become of my men. When I realised that it took the\r\nTibetans five hundred men[28] all counted to arrest a starved Englishman\r\nand his two half-dying servants, and that, even then, they dared not do\r\nit openly, but had to resort to abject treachery; when I found that these\r\nsoldiers were picked troops from Lhassa and Sigatz (Shigatze), despatched\r\non purpose to arrest our progress and capture us, I could not restrain a\r\nsmile of contempt for those into whose hands we had at last fallen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPEAR]\r\n\r\nMy blood boiled when, upon the order of the Lama, who the previous night\r\nhad professed to be our friend, several men advanced and searched our\r\npockets. They rifled us of everything we possessed, and began overhauling\r\nour baggage. The watches and chronometer were looked upon with suspicion,\r\ntheir ticking causing anxiety and curiosity. They were passed round and\r\nround and mercilessly thrown about from one person to the other, until\r\nthey stopped. They were then pronounced "dead." The compasses and\r\naneroids, which they could not distinguish from watches, were soon thrown\r\naside, as "they had no life in them," but great caution was displayed in\r\ntouching our rifles, which were lying on our bedding when the tent had\r\nbeen torn down.\r\n\r\nGreat fears were entertained lest they should go off by themselves; and\r\nit was only on my assurance (which made our captors ten times more\r\ncautious) that they were not loaded, that at last they took them and\r\nregistered them in the catalogue of our confiscated property. I had upon\r\nme a gold ring that my mother had given me when I was a child. I asked\r\npermission to retain it, and with their superstitious nature they\r\nimmediately thought that it had occult powers, like the wands one reads\r\nof in fairy tales.\r\n\r\nA man called Nerba, who later on played an important part in our\r\nsufferings, was entrusted with it, and warned never to let me see it\r\nagain. As we three prisoners sat bound and held down by guards it was\r\nheartbreaking to see the Lamas and officers handle all our things so\r\nroughly as to spoil nearly all they touched; but particularly disgusting\r\nwas their avidity when, in searching the pockets of the coat I wore\r\ndaily, and which I had not put on that morning, they found a quantity of\r\nsilver coins, some eight hundred rupees in all. Officers, Lamas and\r\nsoldiers made a grab for the money, and when order was re-established,\r\nonly a few coins remained where the sum had been laid down. Other moneys\r\nwhich they found in one of our loads met with a similar fate. Among the\r\nthings arousing greatest curiosity was an india-rubber pillow fully blown\r\nout. The soft, smooth texture of the india-rubber seemed to catch their\r\nfancy, and one after the other they rubbed their cheeks on the cushion,\r\nexclaiming at the pleasant sensation it gave them. However, in playing\r\nwith the brass screw by which the cushion was inflated, they gave it a\r\nturn, and the imprisoned air found its way out with a hissing noise. This\r\ncreated quite a panic among the Tibetans, and many were the conjectures\r\nof their superstitious minds as to the meaning of the strange\r\ncontrivance. They regarded it as an evil omen, and naturally I took\r\nadvantage of any small incident of this kind to work judiciously on their\r\nsuperstitions and frighten them as much as I could.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETANS OVERHAULING OUR BAGGAGE]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans, having examined all except my water-tight cases of\r\ninstruments, photographic plates and sketches, seemed so upset at one or\r\ntwo things that happened, and at some remarks I made, that they hurriedly\r\nsealed up all my property in bags and blankets, and ordered the things to\r\nbe placed on yaks and brought into the guard-house of the settlement.\r\nThis done, they tied the end of the ropes that bound our necks to the\r\npommels of their saddles, and, having loosed our feet, they sprang on\r\ntheir ponies and rode off, with shouts, hisses and cries of victory,\r\nfiring their matchlocks in the air, and dragging us prisoners into the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] The Lamas stated afterwards that this was the number.\r\n\r\n[28] Counting Lamas, villagers and soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n     A warning to my men--Calm and coolness--The Pombo\'s tent--Chanden\r\n     Sing cross-examined and flogged.\r\n\r\n\r\nON reaching the settlement, my last words to my men before we were\r\nseparated were, "No matter what they do to you, do not let them see that\r\nyou suffer," and they promised to obey me. We were then conveyed to\r\ndifferent tents. I was dragged to one of the larger tents, inside and\r\noutside of which soldiers were placed on guard. Those near me were at\r\nfirst sulky, and rough in their manner and speech, but I always made a\r\npoint of answering them in as collected and polite a fashion as I could.\r\nI had on many previous occasions found that nothing carries one further\r\nin dealings with Asiatics than to keep calm and cool, and I saw in a\r\nmoment that, if we were ever to get out of our present scrape, it would\r\nbe by maintaining a perfectly impassive demeanour in face of anything\r\nthat might take place. Whether I acted my part well it is not for me to\r\nsay, but the reader can satisfy himself on that point by perusing the\r\nGovernment inquiry and report made by Mr. J. Larkin, and given in the\r\nAppendix to this book.\r\n\r\nThe tent being kept closed, I was unable to discover what happened\r\noutside, but from the noises I heard of people rushing hither and\r\nthither, and of shouted orders, besides the continuous tinkling of the\r\nsoldiers\' horse-bells as they galloped past the tent, I concluded that\r\nthe place must be in a state of turmoil. I had been some three hours in\r\nthe tent, when a soldier entered and ordered me out.\r\n\r\n"They are going to cut off his head," said he to his comrades; and,\r\nturning round to me, he made a significant gesture with his hand across\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n"_Nikutza_" ("All right"), said I drily.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that, when a Tibetan himself hears words of\r\nthis import, he usually goes down on his knees and implores to be spared,\r\nwith tears, and sobs, and prayers in profusion. So it is not surprising\r\nthat the Tibetans were somewhat astonished at my answer, and seemed\r\npuzzled as to what to make of it. Anyhow, the first ardour of the\r\nmessenger was sensibly cooled down, and I was led out with more\r\nreluctance than firmness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POMBO\'S TENT]\r\n\r\nDuring the time I had been shut up, a huge white tent with blue ornaments\r\nhad been pitched in front of the mud-house, and round it were hundreds of\r\nsoldiers and villagers--a most picturesque sight.\r\n\r\nAs I was led nearer, I perceived that the front of the tent was wide\r\nopen, and inside stood a great number of red Lamas, with shaven heads, in\r\ntheir long woollen tunics. The soldiers stopped me when I was about\r\ntwenty yards from the tent. Additional ropes were added to those already\r\ncutting into my wrists, elbows and chest, and the others made tighter. I\r\nperceived Chanden Sing led forward, and then, instead of taking me before\r\nthe Lamas, they pushed me to the rear of the solitary mud-house to\r\npreclude my witnessing the scene that followed. I heard Chanden Sing\r\nbeing interrogated in a loud angry tone of voice, and accused of having\r\nbeen my guide. Next I heard wild shouts from the crowd, then a dead\r\nsilence. A few instants later I distinguished the snapping noise of a\r\nlash, followed by hoarse moans from my poor bearer, to whom they were\r\nevidently applying it.\r\n\r\nI counted the strokes, the sickening noise of which is still well\r\nimpressed on my memory, as they regularly and steadily fell one after the\r\nother to twenty, to thirty, forty, and fifty. Then there was a pause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\n     Led before the tribunal--The Pombo--Classical Tibetan beyond\r\n     me--Chanden Sing lashed--The Lamas puzzled--A sudden change in\r\n     the Pombo\'s attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NUMBER of soldiers now came for me, and I was first led, then pushed\r\nviolently before the tribunal.\r\n\r\nOn a high seat in the centre of the tent sat a man wearing ample trousers\r\nof gaudy yellow and a short yellow coat with flowing sleeves. On his head\r\nhe had a huge four-pointed hat gilt all over, and with three great eyes\r\npainted on it. He was young-looking, and his head was clean shaven, as he\r\nwas a Lama of the highest order, a Grand Lama and a _Pombo_, or Governor\r\nof the province, with powers equivalent to those of a feudal king. On his\r\nright stood a stout and powerful red Lama who held a huge double-handed\r\nsword, and behind, and at the sides, were a number of other Lamas,\r\nofficers and soldiers. As I stood silent, and with my head held high\r\nbefore him, two or three Lamas rushed at me and ordered me to kneel. They\r\ntried to compel me to do so, by forcing me on my knees, but I succeeded\r\nin maintaining an upright posture.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo, who was furious at my declining to kneel before him, addressed\r\nme in words that sounded violent; but, as he spoke classical Tibetan, and\r\nI only the colloquial language, I could not understand a word of what he\r\nsaid, and I meekly asked him not to use such fine words, as they were\r\nunintelligible to me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANDEN SING BEING LASHED]\r\n\r\nThe great man was taken aback at this unheard-of request; and, with a\r\nfrown on his face, he pointed to me to look to my left. The soldiers and\r\nLamas drew aside, and I beheld Chanden Sing lying flat on his face,\r\nstripped from the waist downwards, in front of a row of Lamas and\r\nmilitary men. Two powerful Lamas, one on each side of him, began again\r\nto castigate him with knotted leather thongs weighted with lead, laying\r\non their strokes with vigorous arms from his waist to his feet. He was\r\nbleeding all over. Each time that a lash fell on his wounded skin it felt\r\nas if a dagger had been stuck into my chest; but I knew Orientals too\r\nwell to show any pity for the man, as this would have only involved a\r\nmore severe punishment for him. So I looked on at his torture as one\r\nwould upon a thing of everyday occurrence. The Lamas nearer to me shook\r\ntheir fists under my nose, and explained that my turn would come next,\r\nwhereupon I smiled and repeated the usual "_Nikutza, nikutza_" ("Very\r\ngood, very good").\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POMBO]\r\n\r\nThe Pombo and his officers were at a loss what to make of me, as I could\r\nplainly see by their faces; so that the more I perceived how well my plan\r\nwas answering, the more courage I screwed up to play my part to the best\r\nof my ability.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo, an effeminate, juvenile, handsome person, almost hysterical in\r\nmanner, and likely to make a splendid subject for hypnotic experiments (I\r\nhad reason to think, indeed, that he had already often been under\r\nmesmeric influence), remained with his eyes fixed upon mine as if in a\r\ntrance for certainly over two minutes.\r\n\r\nThere was a wonderful and sudden change in the man, and his voice,\r\narrogant and angry a few moments before, was now soft and apparently\r\nkindly. The Lamas around him were evidently concerned at seeing their\r\nlord and master transformed from a foaming fury to the quietest of lambs.\r\nThey seized me and brought me out of his sight to the spot where Chanden\r\nSing was being chastised. Here again I could not be compelled to kneel,\r\nso at last I was allowed to squat down before the Pombo\'s officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n     My note-books and maps--What the Lamas wanted me to say--My\r\n     refusal--Anger and threats--Ando, the traitor--Chanden Sing\'s\r\n     heroism--A scene of cruelty--Rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE two Lamas, leaving Chanden Sing, produced my note-books and maps, and\r\nproceeded to interrogate me closely, saying that, if I spoke the truth, I\r\nshould be spared, otherwise I should be flogged and then beheaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SOLDIER]\r\n\r\nI answered that I would speak the truth, whether they punished me or not.\r\n\r\nOne of the Lamas, a great big brute, who was dressed up in a gaudy red\r\nsilk coat, with gold embroidery at the collar, and who had taken part in\r\nthe flogging of Chanden Sing, told me I must say "that my servant had\r\nshown me the road across Tibet, and that he had done the maps and\r\nsketches." If I would say this, they were willing to release me and have\r\nme conveyed back to the frontier, promising to do me no further harm.\r\nThey would cut my servant\'s head off, that was all, but no personal\r\ninjury should be inflicted on me.\r\n\r\nI explained clearly to the Lamas that I alone was responsible for the\r\nmaps and sketches, and for finding my way so far inland. I repeated\r\nseveral times, slowly and distinctly, that my servant was innocent, and\r\nthat therefore there was no reason to punish him. He had only obeyed my\r\norders in following me to Tibet, and I alone, not my two servants, was to\r\nbe punished if anybody was punishable.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas were angry at this, and one of them struck me violently on the\r\nhead with the butt-end of his riding-crop. I pretended not to notice it,\r\nthough it made my scalp ache and smart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIER WITH PIGTAIL WOUND ROUND HIS HEAD]\r\n\r\n"Then we shall beat you and your man until you say what we want," the\r\nLama exclaimed angrily.\r\n\r\n"You can beat us if you like," I replied with assurance, "but if you\r\npunish us unjustly it will go against yourselves. You can tear our skin\r\noff, and you can make us bleed to death, but you cannot make us feel\r\npain."\r\n\r\nAndo, the traitor, who spoke Hindustani fluently, acted as interpreter\r\nwhenever there was a hitch in our Tibetan conversation, and with what I\r\nknew of the language, and with this man\'s help, everything was explained\r\nto the Tibetans as clearly as possible. Notwithstanding this, they\r\ncontinued mercilessly to lash my poor servant, who, in his agony, was\r\nbiting the ground as each blow fell on him and tore away patches of skin\r\nand flesh. Chanden Sing behaved heroically. Not a word of complaint, nor\r\na prayer for mercy, came from his lips. He said that he had spoken the\r\ntruth and had nothing more to say. Watched intently by all the Lamas and\r\nsoldiers, I sat with affected stoicism before this scene of cruelty,\r\nuntil, angry at my phlegm, order was given to the soldiers that I should\r\nbe dragged away. Again they led me behind the mud-house, from where I\r\ncould distinctly hear the angry cries of the Lamas cross-examining\r\nChanden Sing, and those dreadful sounds of the lash still being\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nIt began to rain heavily, and this was a bit of luck for us, for in\r\nTibet, as in China, a shower has a great effect upon the people, and even\r\nmassacres have been known to be put a stop to until the rain should\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case that day. The moment the first drops fell, the soldiers\r\nand Lamas rushed here, there, and everywhere inside the tents, and I was\r\nhastily dragged to the most distant tent of the settlement, which became\r\npacked with the guards into whose charge I had been given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OFFICER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\n     A high military officer--A likely friend--A soldier and not a\r\n     Lama--His sympathy--Facts about the Tibetan army.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURSE]\r\n\r\nAN officer of high rank was sitting cross-legged at the farther end of\r\nthe tent. He wore a handsome dark red gown trimmed with gold and leopard\r\nskin, and was shod with tall black and red leather boots of Chinese\r\nshape. A beautiful sword with solid silver sheath inlaid with large\r\npieces of coral and malachite was passed through his belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINT AND STEEL]\r\n\r\nThis man, apparently between fifty and sixty years of age, had an\r\nintelligent, refined, honest, good-natured face; and somehow or other I\r\nfelt from the very first moment I saw him that he would be a friend. And,\r\nindeed, whereas the soldiers and Lamas treated me with brutality and took\r\nevery mean advantage that they could, this officer was alone in showing\r\nsome deference to me and some appreciation of my behaviour. He made room\r\nby his side and signed that I might sit there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNUFF-BOX]\r\n\r\n"I am a soldier," said he in a dignified tone, "not a Lama. I have come\r\nfrom Lhassa with my men to arrest you, and you are now our prisoner. But\r\nyou have shown no fear, and I respect you."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he inclined his head and laid his forehead touching mine, and\r\npulled out his tongue. Then he made a gesture signifying that, though he\r\nwished to, he could not then say more, owing to the presence of the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nLater on we entered into a most amicable conversation, in the course of\r\nwhich he said that he was a Rupun (a grade below that of general). I\r\ntried to explain to him all about English soldiers and weapons, and he\r\ndisplayed the keenest interest in all I told him. In return he gave me\r\ninteresting information about the soldiers of Tibet. Every man in Tibet\r\nis considered a soldier in time of war or when required to do duty, but\r\nfor the regular army all lads that are strong and healthy can enlist from\r\nthe age of seventeen, those deformed or weakly being rejected as unfit\r\nfor service. Good horsemanship is one of the qualities most appreciated\r\nin the Tibetan soldier, and, after that, unbounded obedience. The Rupun\r\nswore by the Tibetan matchlocks, which he believed to be the most\r\nserviceable weapons on earth; for, according to him, as long as you had\r\npowder enough, you could use anything as a missile. Pebbles, earth, or\r\nnails did as good work as any lead bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINT-AND-STEEL POUCH]\r\n\r\nHe told me that large quantities of these weapons were manufactured at\r\nLhassa and Sigatz (Shigatze), and he stated that the majority of Tibetan\r\nmen outside the towns possess one. Gunpowder was also made with saltpetre\r\nand sulphur found in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Rupun, seeing how quick I was at picking up words, took a special\r\ndelight in teaching me, as one would a child, the names of the several\r\ngrades in the Tibetan army. The _Tchu-pun_[29] was the lowest grade, and\r\nonly had ten men under him; then came the _Kiatsamba-pun_ or\r\n_Kia-pun_,[30] or officer in command of one hundred soldiers; and the\r\n_Tung-pun_,[31] or head of one thousand. These officers, however, are\r\nseldom allowed the full complement of soldiers according to their grade,\r\nand very often the "commander of one thousand" has only under him three\r\nor four hundred men at the most. Above the _Tung-pun_ comes the _Rupun_,\r\na kind of adjutant-general; then the _Dah-pun_, or great officer; and\r\nhighest of all, the _Mag-pun_ (or _Mag-bun_, as it is usually\r\npronounced), the general in chief.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance of one of these generals we had already made at Gyanema.\r\nThough my informant said that officers are elected for their bravery in\r\ntime of war and for their strength and aptitude in the saddle and with\r\ntheir weapons, I knew well enough that such was not the case. The posts\r\nare mainly given to whoever can afford to pay most for them, and to men\r\nof families under special protection of the Lamas. In many cases they are\r\nactually sold by auction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEATHER HORSE-WHIP]\r\n\r\nThe method described by the Rupun was nevertheless what is popularly\r\nbelieved by the masses of Tibet to be the way in which military officers\r\nare chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] _Tchu_, ten, _pun_, officer, or officer of ten men.\r\n\r\n[30] _Kiatsamba_ or _Kia_ = one hundred.\r\n\r\n[31] _Tung_ = one thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\n     Sarcasm appreciated--Kindness--A change for the worse--The place\r\n     for an Englishman--Vermin--A Tibetan prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Rupun possessed a good deal of dry humour, and I told him how fast\r\nthe Tibetan soldiers had run away on previous occasions when I had met\r\nthem and had my rifle by me. But he was quite equal to the situation and\r\nexclaimed: "Yes, I know that they ran, but it was not through fear. It\r\nwas because they did not wish to hurt you." Upon which I answered that,\r\nif that were the case, they need not have run so fast.\r\n\r\nThe Rupun seemed amused and laughed at my sarcasm. He patted me on the\r\nback and said I was right. He professed to be grieved to see me tied up,\r\nand said he had received strict orders not to give me food or unloose my\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARM-BOX]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, who had been listening open-mouthed to the affable and\r\nfriendly conversation between the Rupun and myself, a practice not common\r\nin Tibet between captor and prisoner, followed their chief\'s example, and\r\nfrom being harsh and rough, turned quite kindly and respectful. They\r\nplaced a cushion under me and tried to make me as comfortable as they\r\ncould in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, however, the Rupun was summoned before the Pombo,\r\nand the guard was relieved by a fresh lot of men. This was a change for\r\nthe worse. Their manner was extremely rough, and they dragged me away\r\nfrom the dignified seat I had occupied in the place of honour in the\r\ntent, and knocked me violently down on a heap of dung which they used for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n"That is the place for _plenkis!_" shouted one of the men, "not in the\r\nbest part of the tent."\r\n\r\nThey pounced upon me roughly, and though I made no resistance whatever,\r\nthey again tied my feet together, and another rope was fastened round my\r\nknees. The ends of these ropes were left long, and each was given in\r\ncharge of a soldier.\r\n\r\nNo part of a Tibetan tent is over clean, but the spot where I was to rest\r\nfor the night was the dirtiest. Bound so tightly that the ropes cut\r\nchannels in my flesh, it was out of the question to sleep; but tenfold\r\nworse than this was the disgusting fact that I soon got covered with\r\nvermin, which swarmed in the tent. From this time till the end of my\r\ncaptivity, or twenty-five days later, I suffered unspeakable tortures\r\nfrom this pest. The guards, with their swords drawn, were all round me\r\ninside the tent, and others were posted outside.\r\n\r\nThe night was full of strange events. Shouts could be heard at intervals\r\nfrom a distance outside, and some one of the guard in the tent answered\r\nthem. They were to keep the men awake and make sure that I was still\r\nthere. One of the soldiers in the tent revolved his prayer-wheel,\r\nmuttering the following prayer so often that I learned it by heart:\r\n\r\n            Sangbo, sangbo\r\n    Yabni namla dupchenche\r\n    Yumni sala lockchendir\r\n    Lashin shukpi Kani san\r\n    Pashin tagpe Kani san\r\n    Yulo parba palui san\r\n    Tumlo parba wumboi san\r\n    Lassan lussan tamjeh san\r\n    Chedan Kordan jindan san\r\n    Takpeh yeiki polloh san\r\n    Takpeh yonki molloh san\r\n    Tzurzu Kaghi Tablah san\r\n    Arah, Banza, Nattitti\r\n    Jehmi jangla changzalu.\r\n\r\nThe almost literal translation of the words is this:\r\n\r\n    Oh, my God, I confess\r\n    That my father has gone to heaven,\r\n    But my mother is at present alive (_lit._ in the house).\r\n    First my mother sinned\r\n    And you took all men to heaven,\r\n    Then my mother and father sinned and I will go to heaven.\r\n    If all other men and I sin, and we withdraw our sins,\r\n    We are all liable to sin and the wumboo wood absolves (_lit._\r\n            washes all) from all sins.\r\n    On the North-west (Lassan) and South-east (Lussan) are the two\r\n            ways to heaven.\r\n    I read the holy book and purify myself,\r\n    My arm-bone[32] is the sacred bone (_lit._ God\'s bone).\r\n    And the sign of manhood my left arm.\r\n    Oh, my God, who art above my head,\r\n    And at the sacred Kujernath, Banzah and Nattitti\r\n    I pray every day for health and wealth (silver and gold).\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] The Tibetans believe that in men the left, and in women the right,\r\narm belongs to God. They regard it as sacred, because with this arm food\r\nis conveyed to the mouth, thus giving life to the body, and also because\r\nit is with the arms that one can defend oneself against one\'s enemies.\r\nThe bone of the nose is also regarded as sacred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\n     The Rupun as a friend--Treated with respect and deference--Fed by\r\n     the Rupun and soldiers--Improving my knowledge of Tibetan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUKU, OR WOODEN CUP]\r\n\r\nIN the middle of the night the Rupun returned. I noticed he seemed very\r\nmuch upset. He sat by my side, and by the light of the flickering fire\r\nand a wick burning in a brass bowl filled with butter, I could see in his\r\nface an expression of great anxiety. I felt, by the compassionate way in\r\nwhich he looked at me, that he had grave news to give me. I was not\r\nmistaken. He moved me from the pestilent place where I had been thrown\r\ndown helpless by the soldiers, and laid me in a more comfortable and\r\ncleaner part of the tent. Then he ordered a soldier to bring me a\r\nblanket. Next, to my astonishment, he became very severe, and said he\r\nmust examine my bonds. He turned quite angry, scolding the soldiers for\r\nleaving me so insecurely tied, and proceeded to make the knots firmer, a\r\nthing which I felt was impossible. Though he pretended to use all his\r\nstrength in doing this, I found, much to my amazement, that my bonds were\r\nreally becoming loosened. He then quickly covered me up with the heavy\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUKU, OR WOODEN CUP]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were at the other end of the large tent, and seemed occupied\r\nwith a loud argument over some paltry matter. The Rupun, stooping low,\r\nand making pretence to tuck me in the blanket, whispered:\r\n\r\n"Your head is to be cut off to-morrow. Escape to-night. There are no\r\nsoldiers outside."\r\n\r\nThe good man was actually preparing everything for my flight. He put out\r\nthe light, and came to sleep by my side. It would have been\r\ncomparatively easy, when all the men had fallen asleep, to slip from\r\nunder the tent and steal away. I had got my hands easily out of the\r\nropes, and should have had no difficulty in undoing all my other bonds;\r\nbut the thought that I should be leaving my two men at the mercy of the\r\nTibetans prevented my carrying the escape into effect. The Rupun, having\r\nrisen to see that the guard were asleep, lay down again close to me and\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n"_Nelon, nelon; palad[)o]_" ("They are asleep; go").\r\n\r\nWell meant and tempting as the offer was, I told him I must stay with my\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHaving my hands free, I managed to sleep a little during the night; and\r\nwhen the morning came I slipped my hands again inside the ropes.\r\n\r\nThe Rupun, who seemed much disappointed, tied the ropes round my wrists\r\nfirmly again, and, though he appeared rather vexed at my not having\r\navailed myself of the chance of flight he had given me, he treated me\r\nwith ever-increasing respect and deference. He even produced his _puku_\r\n(wooden bowl), which he filled with steaming tea from the _raksang_,[33]\r\nand lifted it up to my mouth for me to drink.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving how thirsty and hungry I was, not only did this good man\r\nrefill the cup time after time until my thirst was quenched, but he mixed\r\nwith it _tsamba_, and lumps of butter, which he then stuffed into my\r\nmouth with his fingers.\r\n\r\nIt was really touching to see how, moved to kindness, the soldiers\r\nimitated his example, and, one after the other, produced handfuls of\r\n_tsamba_ and _chura_, and deposited them in my mouth. Their hands, it is\r\ntrue, were not over clean, but on such occasions it does not do to be too\r\nparticular, and I was so hungry that the food they gave me seemed\r\ndelicious. I had been for two nights and one day without food, and, what\r\nwith the exertion of the fight and my various exciting experiences, my\r\nappetite was very keen.\r\n\r\nThis great politeness, however, and the sympathy with which not only the\r\nRupun, but even the soldiers treated me now, made me suspect that my end\r\nwas indeed near. I was grieved not to be able to obtain news of Chanden\r\nSing and Mansing; and the soldiers\' reticence in answering questions\r\nregarding them made me fear that something awful had happened.\r\nNevertheless, though my gaolers were friendly, I did not betray any\r\nanxiety, but pretended to take all that came as a matter of course. I\r\nspent the first portion of the day in a lively conversation with the\r\nsoldiers, partly to divert my thoughts and partly to improve my knowledge\r\nof Tibetan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[33] _Raksang_, a vessel in which tea mixed with butter and salt is kept\r\nboiling over the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI\r\n\r\n     A bearer of bad news--Marched off to the\r\n     mud-house--Mansing--Insults and humiliations--Iron handcuffs\r\n     instead of ropes--The Rupun\'s sympathy--No more hope--In the\r\n     hands of the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the afternoon a soldier entered the tent, and striking me on the\r\nshoulder with his heavy hand, shouted:\r\n\r\n"_Ohe!_" (This is a Tibetan exclamation always used by the rougher\r\nclasses when beginning a conversation. It corresponds to "Look here.")\r\n\r\n"_Ohe!_" repeated he; "before the sun goes down you will be flogged, both\r\nyour legs will be broken,[34] they will burn out your eyes, and then they\r\nwill cut off your head!"\r\n\r\nThe man, who seemed quite in earnest, accompanied each sentence with an\r\nappropriate gesture illustrating his words. I laughed at him and affected\r\nto treat the whole thing as a joke, partly because I thought this was the\r\nbest way to frighten them and prevent them from using violence, and\r\npartly because the programme thus laid before me seemed so extensive that\r\nI thought it could only be intended to intimidate me.\r\n\r\nHowever, the words of the soldier cast a gloom over my friendly guard in\r\nthe tent, and when I tried to cheer them up, they answered bluntly that I\r\nwould not laugh for very long. Something was certainly happening, for the\r\nmen rushed in and out of the tent, and whispered among themselves. When I\r\nspoke to them they would answer no more, and on my insisting, they made\r\nsigns that their lips must from now be closed.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour later, another person rushed into the tent in a great\r\nstate of excitement, and signalled to my guards to lead me out. This\r\nthey did, after making my bonds tighter than ever, and placing extra\r\nropes round my chest and arms. In this fashion I was marched off to the\r\nmud-house and led into one of the rooms. A large number of soldiers and\r\nvillagers assembled outside, and after we had waited some time, Mansing,\r\ntightly bound, was brought into the same room. My pleasure at seeing my\r\nman again was so great, that I forgot all about what was happening, and\r\npaid no attention to the insults of the mob peeping through the door.\r\nAfter a while a Lama came in with a smiling face and said he had good\r\nnews to give me.\r\n\r\n"We have ponies here," he said, "and we are going to take you back to the\r\nfrontier, but the Pombo wishes to see you first to-day. Do not make any\r\nresistance. Let us exchange the ropes round your wrists for these iron\r\nhandcuffs."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIER LAYING BEFORE ME THE PROGRAMME OF TORTURES]\r\n\r\nHere he produced a heavy pair of them, which he had kept concealed under\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\n"You will not wear them for more than a few moments while we are leading\r\nyou to his presence. Then you will be free. We swear to you by the Sun\r\nand Kunjuk-Sum that we will treat you kindly."\r\n\r\nI promised not to resist, chiefly because I had no chance of doing so.\r\nFor greater safety they tied my legs and placed a sliding knot round my\r\nneck; then I was carried out into the open, where a ring of soldiers with\r\ndrawn swords stood round me. While I lay flat on my face on the ground,\r\nheld down firmly, they unwound the ropes from around my wrists, and the\r\niron fetters, joined by a heavy chain, were substituted for them. They\r\ntook some time in fastening the clumsy padlock, after which, all being\r\nready, they unbound my legs.\r\n\r\nThey made me stand up again, and knowing that I could not possibly get my\r\nhands free, they began to load me with insults and offensive terms, not\r\ndirected to me as an individual, but as a _Plenki_, an Englishman. They\r\nspat upon me and threw mud at me. The Lamas behaved worse than any of the\r\nothers, and the one who had sworn that I should be in no way ill-used if\r\nI would submit quietly to be handcuffed was the most prominent among my\r\ntormentors and the keenest in urging the crowd on to further brutality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY HANDCUFFS]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the attention of the crowd was drawn to the approach of the\r\nRupun with a number of soldiers and officers. He seemed depressed, and\r\nhis face was of a ghastly yellowish tint. He kept his eyes fixed on the\r\nground, and, speaking very low, ordered that I should again be conveyed\r\ninside the mud-house.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he came in and closed the door after him, having\r\nfirst cleared the room of all the people who were in it. As I have\r\nmentioned before, Tibetan structures of this kind have a square aperture\r\nin the ceiling by which they are ventilated and lighted.\r\n\r\nThe Rupun laid his forehead upon mine in sign of compassion, and then\r\nsadly shook his head.\r\n\r\n"There is no more hope," he whispered; "your head will be cut off\r\nto-night. The Lamas are bad and my heart is aching. You are like my\r\nbrother, and I am grieved...."\r\n\r\nThe good old man tried not to let me see his emotion, and made signs that\r\nhe could stay no longer, lest he should be accused of being my friend.\r\n\r\nThe mob again entered the room, and I was once more dragged out into the\r\nopen by the Lamas and soldiers. Some discussion followed as to who should\r\nkeep the key of my handcuffs, and eventually it was handed over to one of\r\nthe officers, who mounted his pony and rode away at a great rate in the\r\ndirection of Lhassa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PADLOCK AND KEY]\r\n\r\n\r\n[34] A form of torture in which, after placing the legs upon two parallel\r\nlogs of wood, a heavy blow is given with a mallet, fracturing both legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII\r\n\r\n     A pitiful scene--A struggle to get to Chanden Sing--Brutally\r\n     treated--A torturing saddle--Across country at a gallop--A\r\n     spirited pony--Sand deposits and hills--Speculation--More\r\n     horsemen coming towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST then I heard the voice of my servant Chanden Sing calling to me in a\r\nweak agonised tone:\r\n\r\n"_Hazur, Hazur, hum murgiaega!_" ("Sir, sir, I am dying!") and, turning\r\nmy head in the direction from which these painful sounds came, I\r\nperceived my faithful bearer with his hands bound behind his back,\r\ndragging himself on his stomach towards the door of one of the other\r\nrooms of the mud-house. His poor face was hardly recognisable, it bore\r\nthe traces of such awful suffering.\r\n\r\nI could stand no more. Pushing my guards aside with my shoulders, I\r\nendeavoured to get to the poor wretch, and had nearly reached him when\r\nthe soldiers who stood by sprang upon me, grappling me, and lifting me\r\nbodily off my feet. They threw me on the back of a pony.\r\n\r\nThough I now feared the worst, I tried to encourage my brave servant by\r\nshouting to him that I was being taken to Taklakot, and that he would be\r\nbrought after me the following day. He had exhausted his last atom of\r\nstrength in creeping to the door. He was roughly seized, and brutally\r\nhurled back into the room of the mud-house, so that we could not exchange\r\na word more. Mansing, the coolie, was placed, with his arms pinioned, on\r\na bare-backed pony. The saddle of the pony I had been thrown upon is\r\nworthy of description. It was in reality the wooden frame of a very\r\nhigh-backed saddle, from the back of which some five or six sharp iron\r\nspikes stuck out horizontally. As I sat on this implement of torture, the\r\nspikes caught me in the small of my back.\r\n\r\nMy guard having been augmented by twenty or thirty mounted men with\r\nmuskets and swords, we set off at a furious pace. A horseman riding in\r\nfront of me led my pony by means of a cord, as my hands were manacled\r\nbehind my back; and thus we travelled across country for miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "SIR, SIR, I AM DYING"]\r\n\r\nBut for those awful spikes in the saddle, the ride would not have been so\r\nvery bad, for the pony I rode was a fine spirited animal, and the country\r\naround was curious and interesting. We proceeded along an apparently\r\nendless succession of yellow sandhills, some of them as high as two or\r\nthree hundred feet, others not more than twenty or thirty. The sand\r\nseemed to have been deposited more by wind than by water, though it is\r\nalso possible that the whole basin, not very high above the level of the\r\nhuge stream, may at some time have been altogether under water. The whole\r\nspace between the mountain-range to the North of the Brahmaputra and the\r\nriver itself was covered with these sand mounds, except in certain places\r\nwhere the soil was extremely marshy, and where our ponies sank in deep\r\nsoft mud. We splashed across several rivulets and skirted a number of\r\nponds. From the summit of a hill to which they led me, I could see that\r\nthe hills were of much greater circumference and height near the river\r\nedge, becoming smaller and smaller as they approached the mountain-range\r\nto the North. Moreover, they increased in number and size the farther we\r\nwent in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIKED SADDLE]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I was now travelling did not permit me to\r\nascertain the quality of the sand, or make any accurate investigations as\r\nto where the sand came from, but a glance at the country all round made\r\nme feel sure that the sand had been conveyed there from the South. This\r\none could plainly see from depressions and wavelike undulations, showing\r\nthat it had travelled (roughly) in a northerly direction; and although,\r\nhaving been unable to ascertain this for a fact, I do not wish to be too\r\ncertain with regard to the movements and sources of these sand deposits,\r\nI was pretty firmly convinced that the sand had been deposited there by\r\nthe wind, which had carried it over the Himahlyan chain from the plains\r\nof India.\r\n\r\nMy guard scoured the country from the high point of vantage to which we\r\nhad ascended. Away in the distance to the East, we saw a large number of\r\nhorsemen raising clouds of dust; and, riding down the hill, the ponies\r\nsinking in the soft sand, we set off in the direction of the new comers,\r\nthe surface at the bottom of the hill being more compact and harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII\r\n\r\n     At an unpleasant pace--Drawing near the cavalcade--A picturesque\r\n     sight--A shot fired at me--Terrible effects of the spikes along\r\n     my spine--The rope breaks--An ill omen--A second shot misses\r\n     me--Arrows--The end of my terrible ride.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE travelled mile after mile at an unpleasant pace, until we arrived at a\r\nspot where, drawn up in a line, was the cavalcade we had seen from the\r\nsummit of the hill. It was a beautiful sight as we approached it, though\r\nthe pain which I was undergoing rather detracted from the pleasure I\r\nshould otherwise have taken in the picturesque scene. There were about a\r\nhundred red Lamas in the centre, with banner-men whose heads were covered\r\nby peculiar flat fluffy hats, and the same number of soldiers and\r\nofficers in their grey, red and black tunics; some two hundred horsemen\r\nin all.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo, in his yellow coat and trousers and his queer pointed hat, sat\r\non a magnificent pony a little in front of the crowd of Lamas and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, when close to this new crowd, the horseman who led my\r\npony let go the rope, and the pony was lashed cruelly and left to its own\r\ndevices. The soldiers of my guard reined up and drew aside. The pony\r\ndashed off in the direction of the Pombo and, as I passed close to him, a\r\nman named Nerba (private secretary of the Tokchim Tarjum), knelt down,\r\nand, taking aim with his matchlock resting on its prop, deliberately\r\nfired a shot at me.\r\n\r\nAlthough (I learned afterwards) this Nerba was one of the champion shots\r\nin the country, and the distance from the muzzle of his matchlock to me\r\nnot more than four yards, the bullet missed me, whizzing past my left\r\near. Probably the speed at which my animal was proceeding saved me, as\r\nthe marksman could not take a very steady aim; but my pony, startled at\r\nthe sudden report of the matchlock at such close quarters, took fright,\r\nand began rearing and plunging. I managed to maintain my seat, though the\r\nspikes in the saddle were lacerating the lower part of my spine terribly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NERBA FIRING AT ME]\r\n\r\nSeveral horsemen now rode up and captured my pony, and preparations were\r\nmade for another exciting number in the programme of my tortures. In\r\ntheir way these noble Lamas were of a sporting nature, but I swore to\r\nmyself that, no matter what they did to me, I would not give them the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that they were hurting me. Acting on this\r\nprinciple, I pretended not to feel the effect of the spikes tearing the\r\nflesh off my backbone; and when they led me before the Pombo to show him\r\nhow covered with blood I was, I expressed satisfaction at riding such an\r\nexcellent pony. This seemed to puzzle them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIDE ON A SPIKED SADDLE]\r\n\r\nA cord of yak\'s hair, about forty or fifty yards long, was now produced,\r\nthe swivel attached to one end of it fastened to my handcuffs, and the\r\nother end held by a horseman. We set off again on our wild career, this\r\ntime followed not only by the guard, but by the Pombo and all his men.\r\nOnce or twice I could not help turning round to see what they were about.\r\nThe cavalcade was a weird and picturesque sight, the riders with their\r\nmany-coloured dresses, their matchlocks with red flags, their jewelled\r\nswords, their banners with long ribbons of all colours flying in the\r\nwind; all galloping furiously, shouting, yelling and hissing, amidst a\r\ndeafening din of thousands of horse-bells.\r\n\r\nIn order to accelerate our speed, a horseman rode by my side lashing my\r\npony to make it go its hardest. Meanwhile the horseman who held the cord\r\ndid his utmost to pull me out of the saddle, no doubt in the hope of\r\nseeing me trampled to death by the cohort behind me. As I leaned my body\r\nforward so as to maintain my seat, and with my arms pulled violently\r\nbackwards by the rope, the flesh was rubbed off my hands and knuckles by\r\nthe chain of the handcuffs. In places the bone was exposed; and, of\r\ncourse, every tug brought me into forcible contact with the spikes and\r\ninflicted deeper wounds. The cord, though strong, eventually and\r\nunexpectedly gave way. The soldier who was pulling at the other end was\r\nclumsily unhorsed, and I myself was all but thrown by the unexpected\r\njerk. This ludicrous incident at first provoked mirth among my escort, a\r\nmirth which their superstitious minds immediately turned into an ill\r\nomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAT I WORE AT THE TIME OF MY CAPTURE, AND SHOWING EFFECT\r\nOF SPIKES]\r\n\r\nWhen my pony was stopped, as well as the runaway steed of the dismounted\r\ncavalier, I took advantage of their fears, and assured them once more\r\nthat whatever harm they tried to do me would go against themselves.\r\nHowever, the cord was retied with sundry strong knots, and, after an\r\ninterruption of a few minutes, we resumed our breakneck gallop, I being\r\nagain sent on in front.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of our journey we had to go round the curve of a\r\nsandhill, the track between this and a large pond at its foot being very\r\nnarrow. At this point I saw in front of me a soldier posted in ambush,\r\nwith his matchlock ready to fire. The pony sank deep in the sand, and\r\ncould not travel fast here, which I suppose was the reason why this spot\r\nhad been selected. The man fired as I passed only a few paces from him;\r\nbut, as luck would have it, this second attempt also left me untouched.\r\n\r\nGetting clear of the soft sand, and finding harder ground, we resumed our\r\nheadlong career. Several arrows were shot at me from behind; but, though\r\nsome passed very near, not one struck me; and thus, after an interminable\r\nride full of incident and excitement, we arrived, towards sunset, at our\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nOn the crown of a hill stood a fortress and large lamasery, and at its\r\nfoot, in front of another large structure, the Pombo\'s gaudy tent had\r\nbeen pitched. The name of this place, as far as I could afterwards\r\nascertain, was Namj Lacce Galshio or Gyatsho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV\r\n\r\n     Intense pain--Hustled to the execution-ground--Stretched and\r\n     tied--Thirsting for blood--A parade of torturing appliances--The\r\n     music--The _Taram_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DISPLAY OF VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE]\r\n\r\nTWO or three men tore me roughly off the saddle. The pain in my spine\r\ncaused by the spikes was intense. I asked for a moment\'s rest. My\r\ncaptors, however, refused, and, roughly thrusting me forward, said that I\r\nwould be beheaded in an instant. All the people round jeered and made\r\nsigns to me that my head would be cut off, and insults of all kinds were\r\nshowered upon me by the crowd of Lamas and soldiers. I was hustled to\r\nthe execution-ground, which lay to the left front of the tent. On the\r\nground was a long log of wood in the shape of a prism. Upon the sharp\r\nedge of this I was made to stand, and several men held me by the body\r\nwhile four or five others, using their combined strength, stretched my\r\nlegs as wide apart as they could go. Fixed in this painful position, the\r\nbrutes securely tied me by my feet to the log of wood with cords of\r\nyak-hair. Several men were made to pull these cords, and they were so\r\ntight that they cut grooves into my skin and flesh in several places\r\nround my ankles and on my feet, many of the cuts[35] being as much as\r\nthree inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMA MUSICIANS]\r\n\r\nWhen I was thus firmly bound, one ruffian, the man Nerba, whom I have\r\nmentioned before as having fired a shot at me, came forward and seized me\r\nfrom behind by the hair of my head. My hair was long, as it had not been\r\ncut for over five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOT IRON TORTURE]\r\n\r\nThe spectacle before me was overwhelming. By the Pombo\'s tent stood in a\r\nrow the most villainous brutes I have ever set eyes upon. One, a powerful\r\nrepulsive individual, held in his hand a great knobbed mallet used for\r\nfracturing bones; another carried a bow and arrows; a third held a big\r\ntwo-handed sword; while others made a display of various ghastly\r\ninstruments of torture. The crowd, thirsting for my blood, formed up in a\r\nsemicircle, leaving room for me to see the parade of the torture\r\nimplements that awaited me; and, as my eyes roamed from one figure to the\r\nother, the several Lamas shook their various implements to show that they\r\nwere preparing for action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TARAM]\r\n\r\nA group of three Lamas stood at the entrance of the tent. They were the\r\nmusicians. One held a gigantic horn which, when blown, emitted hoarse,\r\nthundering sounds, and his companions had one a drum and the other\r\ncymbals. Another fellow some distance away continually sounded a huge\r\ngong. From the moment I was made to dismount the deafening sounds of the\r\ndiabolical trio echoed all through the valley, and added to the horror of\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nAn iron bar with a handle of wood bound in red cloth was being made red\r\nhot in a brasier. The Pombo, who had again placed something in his mouth\r\nto produce artificial foaming at the lips, and so to show his temper,\r\nworked himself up into a frenzy. A Lama handed him the implement of\r\ntorture (the _Taram_), now red hot, and the Pombo seized it by the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\n_"Ngaghi kin meh taxon!_" ("We will burn out your eyes!") cried a chorus\r\nof Lamas.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo strode up to me, brandishing the ghastly implement. I stared at\r\nhim, but he kept his eyes away from me. He seemed reluctant, but the\r\nLamas around him urged him on, lifting the man\'s arm towards me!\r\n\r\n"You have come to this country to see" (alluding to what I had stated the\r\nprevious day, viz., that I was a traveller and pilgrim, and had only come\r\nto see the country). "This, then, is the punishment for you!" and with\r\nthese dreadful words the Pombo raised his arm and placed the red-hot iron\r\nbar parallel to, and about an inch or two from, my eyeballs, and all but\r\ntouching my nose.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I kept my eyes tightly closed, but the heat was so intense\r\nthat it seemed as if my eyes, the left one especially, were being\r\ndesiccated and my nose scorched.\r\n\r\nThough the time seemed interminable, I do not think that the heated bar\r\nwas before my eyes actually longer than thirty seconds or so. Yet it was\r\nquite long enough, for, when I lifted my aching eyelids, I saw everything\r\nas in a red mist. My left eye was frightfully painful, and every few\r\nseconds it seemed as if something in front of it obscured its vision.\r\nWith the right eye I could still see fairly well, except that everything,\r\nas I have said, looked red instead of its usual colour. The hot iron had\r\nbeen thrown down and was frizzling on the wet ground a few paces from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[35] Measured some weeks later by Dr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV\r\n\r\n     Bleeding all over--Insulted and spat upon--"Kill him!"--Urging on\r\n     the executioner--Refusal to stoop--An unpleasant sword\r\n     exercise--The execution suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY position as I stood with my legs wide apart, with my back, hands and\r\nlegs bleeding, and seeing everything of a ghastly red tinge; amidst the\r\ndeafening, maddening noise of gong, drum, cymbals and horn; insulted,\r\nspat upon by the crowd, and with Nerba holding me so tight by my hair as\r\nto tear handfuls of it from my scalp, was one in which I cannot wish even\r\nmy bitterest enemies to find themselves. All I was able to do was to\r\nremain calm and composed and to watch with apparent unconcern the\r\npreparations for the next sufferings to be inflicted upon me.\r\n\r\n"_Miumta nani sehko!_" ("Kill him with a rifle!") shouted a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nA matchlock was now being loaded by a soldier, and such was the quantity\r\nof gunpowder they placed in the barrel that I made sure whoever fired it\r\nwould have his head blown off; so it was with a certain amount of\r\nsatisfaction that I saw it handed over to the Pombo. That official placed\r\nthe weapon against my forehead, with the muzzle pointing upwards. Then a\r\nsoldier leaning down, applied fire to the fuse and eventually there was a\r\nloud report which gave my head a severe shock, and the overloaded\r\nmatchlock flew clean out of the Pombo\'s hand, much to everybody\'s\r\nsurprise. I forced myself to laugh; and their confusion, added to the\r\ntantalising failure of every attempt they made to hurt me, drove the\r\ncrowd to the highest pitch of fury.\r\n\r\n_"Ta kossaton, ta kossaton!_" ("Kill him, kill him!") exclaimed fierce\r\nvoices all round me. "_Ngala mangbo shidak majidan!_" ("We cannot\r\nfrighten him!") "_Ta kossaton, ta kossaton!_" ("Kill him, kill him!"),\r\nthe whole valley resounding with their ferocious cries.\r\n\r\nA huge two-handed sword was now handed to the Pombo, who drew it out of\r\nits sheath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BANNERMAN]\r\n\r\n"Kill him, kill him!" shouted the mob once more, urging on the\r\nexecutioner, who, his superstitious nature not having overcome the\r\nill-omened fact that the matchlock a moment before had jumped out of his\r\nhand (which he probably attributed to the doing of some supreme power and\r\nnot to the over-charge), seemed quite reluctant to come forward.\r\n\r\nI seized this moment to say that they might kill me if they wished, but\r\nthat, if I died to-day, they would all die to-morrow--an undeniable fact,\r\nfor we are all bound to die some day. This seemed to cool them for a\r\nmoment, but the excitement in the crowd was too great, and at last they\r\nsucceeded in working the Pombo up into a passion. His face became quite\r\nunrecognisable, such was his excitement, and he behaved like a madman.\r\n\r\nAt this point a Lama approached and slipped something into the mouth of\r\nthe executioner, who again foamed at the lips. A Lama held his sword,\r\nwhile he turned up one sleeve of his coat to have his arms free, and the\r\nLamas turned up the other for him. Then he strode towards me with slow,\r\nponderous steps, swinging the shiny sharp blade from side to side before\r\nhim, with his bare arms outstretched.\r\n\r\nThe man Nerba, who was still holding me by the hair, was told to make me\r\nbend my neck. I resisted with what little strength I had left, determined\r\nto keep my head erect and my forehead high. They might kill me, true\r\nenough, they might hack me to pieces if they chose, but never until I had\r\nlost my last atom of strength would these ruffians make me stoop before\r\nthem. I would perish, but it should be looking down upon the Pombo and\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXECUTIONER BROUGHT THE SWORD DOWN TO MY NECK]\r\n\r\nThe executioner, now close to me, held the sword with his nervous hands,\r\nlifting it high above his shoulder. He then brought it down to my neck,\r\nwhich he touched with the blade, to measure the distance, as it were, for\r\na clean effective stroke. Then, drawing back a step, he quickly raised\r\nthe sword again and struck a blow at me with all his might. The sword\r\npassed disagreeably close to my neck under my chin, but did not touch\r\nme. I would not flinch, nor speak, and my demeanour seemed to impress him\r\nalmost to the point of frightening him. He became reluctant to continue\r\nhis diabolical performance; but the impatience and turbulence of the\r\ncrowd were at their highest, and the Lamas nearer to him gesticulated\r\nlike madmen and urged him on again.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, their wild shouts, their bloodthirsty countenances, are\r\nvividly brought before me. Apparently against his will, the executioner\r\nwent through the same kind of performance on the other side of my head.\r\nThis time the blade passed so near that the point cannot have been more\r\nthan half an inch or so from my neck.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if all would soon be over; yet, strange to say, even at this\r\nculminating moment I did not seriously realise that I should die. Why\r\nthis was so I cannot say, because everything pointed towards my end being\r\nvery near; but I had a feeling all the time that I should live to see the\r\nend of it all. I was very sorry, if my end were really at hand, as it\r\nseemed likely, that I should die without seeing my parents and friends\r\nagain, and that they probably would never know how and where I had died.\r\nOne is naturally at all times reluctant to leave a world in which one has\r\nbarely had a dull moment, but, after all my wretched experiences,\r\nsufferings and excitement, I did not realise my peril so much as I should\r\nhave done had I, for instance, been dragged from my comfortable London\r\nflat direct on to the execution-ground, instead of first having lived\r\nthrough the recent past.\r\n\r\nNaturally the scene is one that I am not likely to forget, and I must say\r\nfor the Tibetans that the whole affair was very picturesquely carried\r\nout. Even the ghastliest ceremonies may have their artistic side, and\r\nthis particular one, performed with extra pomp and flourish, was really\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the unpleasant sword exercise is sometimes gone through\r\nin Tibet previous to actually cutting off the head, so as to make the\r\nvictim suffer more before the final blow is given. I was not aware of\r\nthis at the time, and only learnt it some weeks after. It is usually at\r\nthe third stroke that the victim is actually beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas were still clamouring for my head, but the Pombo made a firm\r\nstand this time, and declined to go on with the execution. They collected\r\nround him and seemed very angry; they shouted and yelled and gesticulated\r\nin the wildest fashion; and still the Pombo kept his eyes upon me in a\r\nhalf-respectful, half-frightened manner, and refused to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI\r\n\r\n     Mansing arrives--A pretence of killing him--Our execution\r\n     postponed--Fed by the Lamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN excited consultation followed, during which, in the midst of this\r\nscene of barbarity, my coolie Mansing arrived. He had fallen off his\r\nbare-back pony many times, and had been left far behind. The man who held\r\nmy hair now relinquished his grasp, while another pushed me violently\r\nfrom in front, causing me to fall heavily backward, and putting a painful\r\nstrain on all the tendons of my legs. Mansing, bruised and aching all\r\nover, was brought forward and tied by his legs to the same log of wood to\r\nwhich I was fastened. They informed me that they would kill my coolie\r\nfirst, and one brutal Lama seized him roughly by the throat. I was pushed\r\nup in a sitting posture, and a cloth was thrown over my head and face, so\r\nthat I could not see what was being done. I heard poor Mansing groan\r\npitifully, then there was a dead silence. I called him, I received no\r\nanswer; so I concluded that he had been despatched. I was left in this\r\nterrible suspense for over a quarter of an hour, when at last they\r\nremoved the cloth from over my head, and I beheld my coolie lying before\r\nme, bound to the log and almost unconscious, but, thank God, still alive.\r\nHe told me that, when I had called him, a Lama had placed his hand upon\r\nhis mouth to prevent him from answering, while, with the other hand, he\r\nhad squeezed his neck so tightly as to nearly strangle him. After a while\r\nMansing got better, and the coolness and bravery of the poor wretch\r\nduring these terrible trials were really marvellous.\r\n\r\nWe were told that our execution was only postponed till the next day, in\r\norder that we might be tortured until the time came for us to be brought\r\nout to death.\r\n\r\nA number of Lamas and soldiers stood round jeering at us. I seized the\r\nopportunity this respite afforded to hail a swaggering Lama and ask him\r\nfor some refreshment.\r\n\r\n"_Orcheh, orcheh nga dappa tugu duh, chuen deh, dang, yak, guram, tcha,\r\ntsamba pin_" ("I am very hungry, please give me some rice, yak meat,\r\n_ghur_, tea, and oatmeal!") I asked in my best Tibetan.\r\n\r\n"_Hum murr, Maharaja!_" ("I want butter, your Majesty") put in Mansing,\r\nhalf in Hindustani and half in the Tibetan language.\r\n\r\nThis natural application for food seemed to afford intense amusement to\r\nour torturers, who had formed a ring round us, and laughed at our appeal,\r\nwhile Mansing and I, both of us famished, were left sitting bound in a\r\nmost painful position.\r\n\r\nThe day had now waned, and our torturers did not fail to remind us\r\nconstantly that the following day our heads would be severed from our\r\nbodies, which I told them would cause us no pain, for if they gave us no\r\nfood we should be dead of starvation by then.\r\n\r\nWhether they realised that this might be the case, or whether some other\r\nreasons moved them, I cannot say; but several of the Lamas, who had been\r\nmost brutal, including one who had the previous day taken a part in\r\nChanden Sing\'s flogging, now became quite polite and treated us with a\r\nsurprising amount of deference. Two Lamas were despatched to the\r\nmonastery, and returned after some time with bags of _tsamba_ and a large\r\n_raksang_ of boiling tea. I have hardly ever enjoyed a meal more, though\r\nthe Lamas stuffed the food down my throat with their unwashed fingers so\r\nfast that they nearly choked me.\r\n\r\n"Eat, eat as much as you can," said they grimly, "for it may be your last\r\nmeal."\r\n\r\nAnd eat I did, and washed the _tsamba_ down with quantities of buttered\r\ntea, which they poured into my mouth carelessly out of the _raksang_.\r\n\r\nMansing, whose religion did not allow him to eat food touched by folk of\r\na different caste, was eventually permitted to lick the meal out of the\r\nwooden bowl. I myself was none too proud to take the food in any way it\r\nmight be offered, and when my humble "_Orcheh, orcheh tchuen mangbo\r\nterokchi_" ("Please give me some more") met with the disapproval of the\r\nLamas, and brought out the everlasting negative, "_Middu, middu_," I was\r\nstill too hungry to waste any of the precious food: so the Tibetans\r\nrevolved the wooden bowl round and round my mouth, and I licked it as\r\nclean as if it had never been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII\r\n\r\n     Happiness checked--Stretched on the rack--Mansing shares my\r\n     fate--Drenched and in rags--An unsolved mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER all the excitement of the day, we were beginning to feel a little\r\nrestored and much relieved at being treated rather less roughly, were it\r\nonly for a few moments, when, small as it was, the improvement in our\r\ncondition was checked.\r\n\r\nA Lama came from the monastery and gave orders right and left, and the\r\nplace was again in commotion. We were pounced upon and roughly seized,\r\nand my legs were quickly untied, a number of men holding me down the\r\nwhile. Again they lifted me until I stood upright on the cutting edge of\r\nthe prismatic log: two men seized one leg and two the other, and\r\nstretched them apart as far as they could possibly go. Then rope after\r\nrope was wound round my feet and ankles, and I was made fast as before to\r\nthe log.\r\n\r\nAs my legs were much farther apart this time, the pain in the muscles of\r\nmy legs when they proceeded to knock me down backwards was even greater\r\nthan it had been on the previous occasion. But before I had time to feel\r\nit in full, the Lamas, now as ferocious as I had seen them at first,\r\ndragged my manacled arms backwards from under my body and tied a rope to\r\nthe chain of the handcuffs. This done, they passed the rope through a\r\nhole in the top of a high post behind me, and by tugging at it, strained\r\nmy arms upwards in a way that, had I been less supple, would certainly\r\nhave broken them. When all their strength combined could not stretch me\r\nanother inch without tearing my body to pieces, they made the rope fast,\r\nand I remained half suspended, and feeling as if all the bones of my\r\nlimbs were getting, or had got, pulled out of their sockets. The weight\r\nof the body naturally tending to settle down would, I felt, every moment\r\nincrease the suffering of this terrible torture, which was really a\r\nprimitive form of the rack.\r\n\r\nMansing was likewise suspended on the other side, his feet remaining tied\r\nto the log to which my own were fastened, only not quite so wide apart.\r\n\r\nThe pain was at first intense, the tendons of the legs and arms being\r\ndreadfully strained, and the spinal column bent so as nearly to be broken\r\nin two. The shoulder-blades forced into close contact, pressed the\r\nvertebrae inwards, and caused excruciating pains along the lumbar\r\nvertebrae, where the strain was greatest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THUS ELAPSED TWENTY-FOUR TERRIBLE HOURS]\r\n\r\nAs if this were not sufficient, a cord was tied from Mansing\'s neck to\r\nmine, the object of which was to keep our necks stretched in a most\r\nuncomfortable position.\r\n\r\nIt began to rain heavily, and we were left out in the open. The rags to\r\nwhich our clothes had been reduced in our struggle when we were first\r\nseized were drenched. Half naked and wounded, we were alternately numbed\r\nwith cold and burning with fever. A guard encircled us, having with them\r\ntwo watch-dogs tied to pegs. The soldiers were apparently so confident of\r\nour inability to escape that they drew their heavy blankets over their\r\nheads and slept. One of them in his slumber moved and pushed his sword\r\noutside the blanket in which he had now rolled himself tight. This\r\ninspired me with the idea of attempting to escape.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours later it had become very dark. Thanks to the extremely\r\nsupple nature of my hands, I succeeded in drawing the right hand out of\r\nmy handcuffs, and, after an hour or so of stealthy and anxious work I\r\nmanaged to unloose the cord that bound Mansing\'s feet. Then I whispered\r\nto him to get up slowly and to push the sword towards me with his foot\r\nuntil I could reach it. If successful in this, I could soon cut my bonds\r\nand those fastening Mansing\'s hands, and with a weapon in our possession\r\nwe would make a bold dash for liberty.\r\n\r\nMansing, however, was not a champion of agility. In his joy at feeling\r\npartly free, the poor coolie moved his stiff legs clumsily. The vigilant\r\nwatch-dogs detected this, and gave the alarm by barking. The guards were\r\nup in a moment, and, timid as they always were, they all hurriedly left\r\nus, and went to fetch lights to examine our bonds.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, protected by the darkness of the stormy night, I had\r\nsucceeded in replacing my hand inside the iron handcuff. Putting it back\r\nwas more difficult than drawing it out, but I had just time to effect my\r\npurpose. The men who had gone to the monastery returned with lights. I\r\npretended to be fast asleep: a likely thing with every bone in my body\r\nfeeling as if it were disjointed, every limb half-numbed and frozen,\r\nevery tendon and ligament so strained as to drive me mad with pain!\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans found the bonds round Mansing\'s feet undone. They examined\r\nmy hands and saw them just as they had left them. They inspected my feet.\r\nThe ropes were still there cutting into my flesh. They inspected\r\nMansing\'s hands, only to find them still fastened to the post behind him.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans were so puzzled at this mysterious occurrence that they\r\npositively got frightened. They began to shout excitedly, calling for\r\nhelp. In a moment, the alarm having been given, a crowd of men rushed at\r\nus, and with their swords drawn, surrounded us. One man, braver than the\r\nrest, gave Mansing a few cuts with a whip, warning us that if the ropes\r\nwere found undone again they would decapitate us there and then. The\r\ncoolie was again bound, this time more tightly than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII\r\n\r\n     Mansing partially untied after twelve hours on the\r\n     rack--Numbed--How the brain works under such circumstances--My\r\n     scientific instruments--The end of my photographic plates--A\r\n     paint-box accused of occult powers--An offer refused--Courtesy\r\n     and cruelty combined.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY way of precaution, a light was set between Mansing and myself, and, as\r\nit was still raining hard, the Tibetans placed a canvas shelter over us\r\nto prevent the light from being extinguished. At about six or seven in\r\nthe morning, Mansing\'s feet were untied, but not his hands. I was left in\r\nthe same uncomfortable and painful posture. The hours passed very slowly\r\nand wearily. My legs, my arms and hands had gradually become quite\r\nlifeless, and after the first six or seven hours that I had been\r\nstretched on the rack, I felt no more actual pain. The numbness crept\r\nalong every limb of my body, until I had now the peculiar sensation of\r\npossessing a living head on a dead body.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed remarkable how one\'s brain keeps alive and working well\r\nunder such circumstances, apparently unaffected by the temporary\r\nmortification of the remainder of the system.\r\n\r\nThe day now dawning was one full of strange incidents. When the sun was\r\nhigh in the sky, the Pombo, with a great number of Lamas, rode down from\r\nthe monastery, though the distance was very short. He went to his tent,\r\nand presently my cases of scientific instruments were brought outside and\r\nopened, the soldiers and Lamas displaying an amusing mixture of curiosity\r\nand caution over everything they touched. I had to explain the use of\r\neach instrument, a difficult matter indeed, considering their ignorance\r\nand my limited knowledge of Tibetan, which did not allow of my delivering\r\nscientific addresses. The sextant was looked upon with great suspicion,\r\nand even more so the hypsometrical apparatus, with its thermometers in\r\nbrass tubes, which they took to be some sort of firearm, Then came a lot\r\nof undeveloped photographic plates, box after box of which they opened in\r\nbroad daylight, destroying in a few moments all the valuable negatives\r\nthat I had taken since leaving Mansarowar. The Pombo, more observant than\r\nthe others, noticed that the plates turned a yellowish colour on being\r\nexposed to the light.\r\n\r\n"Why is that?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"It is a sign that you will suffer for what you are doing to me."\r\n\r\nThe Pombo flung away the plate, and was much upset. He ordered a hole to\r\nbe dug in the ground some way off, and the plates to be instantly buried.\r\nThe soldiers, however, who had been entrusted with the order, seemed loth\r\nto touch the plates, and they had to be reprimanded and beaten by the\r\nLamas before they would obey. At last, with their feet, they shoved the\r\nboxes of negatives to a spot some distance off, where, in dog fashion,\r\nthey dug a deep hole with their hands in the muddy ground; and there,\r\nalas! my work of several weeks was covered for ever with earth.\r\n\r\nNow came my paint-box with its cakes of water-colours.\r\n\r\n"What do you do with these?" cried an angry Lama, pointing at the\r\nharmless colours.\r\n\r\n"I paint pictures."\r\n\r\n"No, you are lying. With the \'yellow\' you find where gold is in the\r\ncountry, and with the \'blue\' you discover where malachite is."\r\n\r\nI assured them that this was not the case, and told them that, if they\r\nwould untie me, I would, on recovering the use of my arms, paint a\r\npicture before them.\r\n\r\nThey prudently preferred to leave me tied up.\r\n\r\nTheir whole attention was now drawn to a considerable sum in silver and\r\ngold which they found in the cases, and the Pombo warned the people that\r\nnot one coin must be stolen.\r\n\r\nI took this chance to make an offering of 500 rupees to the lamasery, and\r\ntold the Pombo that I would like him to accept as a gift my\r\nMartini-Henry, which I had noticed rather took his fancy.\r\n\r\nBoth gifts were refused, as they said the lamasery was very wealthy, and\r\nthe Pombo\'s position as an official did not allow him to carry a rifle.\r\nThe Pombo, nevertheless, was quite touched by the offer, and came\r\npersonally to thank me.\r\n\r\nIn a way the rascals were gentlemanly enough in their manner, and I could\r\nnot help admiring their mixture of courtesy and cruelty, either of which\r\nthey could switch on at a moment\'s notice without regard to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX\r\n\r\n     An unknown article in Tibet--My sponge bewitched--A Lama fires my\r\n     Martini-Henry--The rifle bursts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY had now reached the bottom of the water-tight case, and the Pombo\r\ndrew out with much suspicion a curious flattened object.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" inquired he, as usual lifting the article up in the air.\r\n\r\nMy sight had been so injured that I could not clearly discern what it\r\nwas; but on their waving it in front of my nose, I recognised it to be my\r\nlong mislaid bath-sponge, dry and flattened, which Chanden Sing, with his\r\nusual ability for packing, had stored away at the bottom of the case,\r\npiling upon it the heavy cases of photographic plates. The sponge, a very\r\nlarge one, was now reduced to the thickness of less than an inch, owing\r\nto the weight that had for weeks lain upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans were greatly puzzled at this new discovery, which they said\r\nresembled tinder; and it was touched with much caution, for some of the\r\nLamas said it might explode.\r\n\r\nWhen their curiosity was appeased, they took it and threw it away. It\r\nfell near me in a small pool of water. This was a golden opportunity to\r\nfrighten my jailers, and I addressed the sponge in English, and with any\r\nword that came into my mouth, pretending to utter incantations. The\r\nattention of the Lamas and soldiers was naturally quickly drawn to this\r\nunusual behaviour on my part; and they could not conceal their terror\r\nwhen, as I spoke louder and louder to the sponge, it gradually swelled to\r\nits normal size with the moisture it absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans, who at first could hardly believe their eyes at this\r\nincomprehensible occurrence, became so panic-stricken at what they\r\nbelieved to be an exhibition of my occult powers, that there was a\r\ngeneral stampede in every direction.\r\n\r\nIn a way, all this was entertaining, and anyhow it served to pass away\r\nthe time. The most amusing scene that afternoon was, however, still to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the Lamas screwed up their courage, and returned to where my\r\nbaggage had been overhauled. One of them picked up my Martini-Henry, and\r\nthe others urged him to fire it off. He came to me, and when I had\r\nexplained to him how to load it, he took a cartridge and placed it in the\r\nbreech, but would insist on not closing the bolt firmly home. When I\r\nwarned him of the consequences, he struck me over the head with the butt\r\nof the rifle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELT, WITH BULLET AND POWDER POUCHES, DAGGER, NEEDLE-CASE,\r\nAND FLINT AND STEEL]\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion, when aiming with one of their matchlocks, which have a\r\nprop attached to them, to place the butt in front of the nose instead of\r\nholding it firmly to the shoulder as we do. So the Lama aimed in this\r\nfashion at one of my yaks peacefully grazing some thirty yards off. While\r\neverybody watched anxiously to see the results of this marksman\'s\r\nshooting, he pulled the trigger; the rifle went off with an extra loud\r\nreport, and behold! the muzzle of the Martini burst and the violent\r\nrecoil gave the Lama a fearful blow in the face. The rifle, flying out of\r\nhis hands, described a somersault in the air, and the Lama fell backwards\r\nto the ground, where he remained spread out flat, bleeding all over, and\r\nscreaming like a child. His nose was squashed; one eye had been put out,\r\nand his teeth shattered.\r\n\r\nWhether the rifle burst because the bolt had not been properly closed, or\r\nbecause mud had got into the muzzle as well, I could not say; but I give\r\nhere a photograph of the broken weapon, which the Tibetans returned to\r\nme several months later through the Government of India.\r\n\r\nThe injured Lama, I may say, was the one at the head of the party that\r\nwanted to have my head cut off, so that, naturally enough, I could not\r\nhelp betraying my satisfaction at the accident. I was glad they had let\r\nme live another day were it only to see his self-inflicted punishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTINI-HENRY EXPLODED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC\r\n\r\n     A consultation--Untied from the rack--The most terrible\r\n     twenty-four hours of my life--I lose the use of my\r\n     feet--Circulation returning--Intense pain--Sports.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Pombo, who had been, during the greater part of the afternoon,\r\nlooking at me with an air of mingled pity and respect, as though he had\r\nbeen forced against his will to treat me so brutally, could not help\r\njoining in my laughter at the Lama\'s sorrowful plight. In a way, I\r\nbelieve he was rather glad that the accident had happened; for, if he had\r\nuntil then been uncertain whether to kill me or not, he felt, after what\r\nhad occurred, that it was not prudent to attempt it. The gold ring which\r\nhad been taken from me on the day of our arrest, and for which I had\r\nasked many times, as it had been given by my mother, was regarded as\r\npossessing miraculous powers as long as it was upon me; and was therefore\r\nkept well away from me, for fear that, with its help, I might break my\r\nbonds and escape. The Pombo, the Lamas and officers held another\r\nconsultation, at the end of which, towards sunset, several soldiers came\r\nand loosed my legs from the stretching log; and my hands, though still\r\nmanacled, were lowered from the pillar behind.\r\n\r\nAs the ropes round my ankles were unwound from the deep channels they had\r\ncut into my flesh, large patches of skin came away with them. Thus ended\r\nthe most terrible twenty-four hours I have ever passed in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nI felt very little relief at first as I lay flat on the ground, for my\r\nbody and legs were stiff and as if dead; and, as time went by, and I saw\r\nno signs of their coming back to life, I feared that mortification had\r\nset in, and that I had lost the use of my feet for good. It was two or\r\nthree hours before the blood began to circulate in my right foot, and the\r\npain when it did so was intense. Had a handful of knives been passed\r\nslowly down the inside of my leg the agony could not have been more\r\nexcruciating. My arms were not quite so bad: they also were numbed, but\r\nthe circulation was more quickly re-established.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Pombo, whether to amuse me or to show off his\r\nriches, ordered about one hundred ponies, some with magnificent harness,\r\nto be brought up; and, mounting the finest, and holding in his hand that\r\ndreadful _taram_, rode round the hill on which the monastery and fort\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nOn returning, he harangued his men, and a series of sports began, the\r\nPombo seating himself near me and watching me intently to see how I was\r\nenjoying the performance. First of all the best marksmen were selected,\r\nand with their matchlocks fired one after the other at my two poor yaks\r\nonly a few yards off; but although they aimed carefully and deliberately,\r\nthey did not succeed in hitting them. I knew that they fired with\r\nbullets, for I could hear the hissing sound the missiles made.\r\n\r\nNext came a display of fine horsemanship, which was very interesting. I\r\nshould have enjoyed it more if I had not been suffering agonies all the\r\ntime. Still, the performance helped to cheer me. First there were races\r\nin which only two ponies at a time took part, the last race being run\r\nbetween the two winners of the last heats, and a _kata_ was presented to\r\nthe victor. Next one horseman rode ahead at full gallop flying a _kata_,\r\nwhile some twenty others followed closely behind. The _kata_ was left to\r\nfly by itself, and when it settled on the ground, the horsemen following\r\nthe first rode some distance away, and, at a given signal, galloped back\r\nwildly, all converging towards the spot, and, bending down from their\r\nponies, attempted to pick up the _kata_ without dismounting. Some of the\r\nyounger men were very clever at this.\r\n\r\nAnother exercise consisted in one man on foot standing still, while a\r\nmounted comrade rode at full gallop towards him, seized him by his\r\nclothes, and lifted him on to the saddle.\r\n\r\nThough I could not see as well as I wished, I got so interested in the\r\nshow, and expressed such admiration for the ponies, that the Pombo,\r\nbecoming quite thoughtful and polite, ordered the best of them to be\r\nbrought before me, and had me lifted into a sitting posture, so that I\r\ncould see them better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI\r\n\r\n     A great relief--The Pombo\'s attentions--A weird hypnotic dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS was a great relief, for I was suffering more from my humiliating\r\nposition, being unable to stand, than from the tortures themselves. The\r\nPombo told me that I must now look towards the tent, and then got up and\r\nwalked towards it.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the tent was over twenty feet long. Some soldiers came and\r\ndragged me close to the front of it, so that I could witness all that\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nTwo big Lamas entered the tent with the Pombo, and a number of other\r\npeople who were inside were turned out. They closed the tent for a few\r\nminutes, and then opened it again. In the meantime a gong summoned the\r\nLamas of the monastery to come down, and, a few minutes later, a string\r\nof them came and took their places inside the tent.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo, in his yellow coat and trousers and four-cornered hat, sat on\r\na kind of high-backed chair in the centre of the tent, and by his side\r\nstood the two Lamas who had first entered it with him. The Pombo was\r\nbeyond doubt in a hypnotic trance. He sat motionless, with his hands flat\r\non his knees and his head erect; his eyes were fixed and staring. For\r\nsome minutes he remained like this, and all the soldiers and people who\r\nhad collected in front of the tent went down on their knees, laid their\r\ncaps on the ground, and muttered prayers. One of the two Lamas, a fellow\r\nwith great mesmeric powers, now laid his hand upon the shoulders of the\r\nPombo, who gradually raised his arms with hands outstretched and remained\r\nas in a cataleptic state for a long time without moving an inch.\r\n\r\nNext the Lama touched the Pombo\'s neck with his thumbs, and caused the\r\nhead to begin a rapid circular movement from left to right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POMBO\'S CONTORTIONS]\r\n\r\nCertain exorcisms were pronounced by the hypnotiser, and the Pombo now\r\nbegan the most extraordinary snake-like contortions, moving and twisting\r\nhis arms, head, body and legs. He worked himself, or rather was worked,\r\ninto a frenzy that lasted some time, and the crowd of devotees drew\r\nnearer and nearer to him, praying fervently and emitting deep sighs and\r\ncries of astonishment and almost terror at some of the more eccentric\r\nmovements of his limbs. Every now and then this weird kind of dance\r\nterminated in a strange posture, the Pombo actually doubling himself up\r\nwith his head between his feet and his long flat hat resting on the\r\nground. While he was in this position, the bystanders went one by one to\r\nfinger his feet, and make low prostrations and salaams. At last the\r\nhypnotiser, seizing the Pombo\'s head between his hands, stared in his\r\neyes, rubbed his forehead, and woke him from the trance. The Pombo was\r\npale and exhausted. He lay back on the chair and his hat fell off his\r\nhead, which was clean shaven, thus unmistakably showing that he too was a\r\nLama, and, as we have seen, of a very high order, probably of the first\r\nrank after the Dalai Lama.\r\n\r\n_Katas_ were distributed after this religious performance to all the\r\nTibetans present, and they folded them and stowed them away in their\r\ncoats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FINALE OF THE DANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII\r\n\r\n     Compliments exchanged--A poisoned drink proffered--In acute\r\n     pain--Uncertainty as to our fate--Working the oracle--My webbed\r\n     fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Pombo came out of his gaudy tent, and I told him that the dance was\r\nbeautiful, but that I was very hungry. He asked me what I wanted to eat,\r\nand I said I would like some meat and tea.\r\n\r\nA little later, a large vessel with a delicious stew of yak\'s meat was\r\nbrought to me, as well as _tsamba_ in abundance. However, though I felt\r\nquite famished, I had the greatest difficulty in swallowing even a little\r\nfood. This I thought must be owing to the injuries to my spine and to the\r\nmortification of my limbs, which had apparently affected my whole system\r\nexcept my head.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pombo had retired and night came on, I was again tied to the\r\nstretching log, but this time with my limbs not stretched so far apart.\r\nMy hands, too, were again fastened to the pillar behind, but with no\r\nstrain on them.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, half a dozen Lamas came from the monastery with a\r\nlight and a large brass bowl which they said contained tea. The wounded\r\nLama, with his head all bandaged up, was among them, and he was so\r\nanxious for me to drink some of it to keep myself warm during the cold\r\nnight that I became suspicious. When they pushed a bowl of the liquid to\r\nmy lips, I merely sipped a little, and declined to take more, spitting\r\nout what they had forced into my mouth. I swallowed a few drops, and a\r\nfew minutes later I was seized with sharp, excruciating pains in my\r\nstomach, which continued for several days after. I can but conclude that\r\nthe drink proffered me was poisoned.\r\n\r\nThe following day my left foot, which had remained lifeless since I had\r\nbeen untied from the rack the first time, began to get better, and the\r\ncirculation was gradually restored. The pain was unbearable.\r\n\r\nIn the morning indecision again prevailed as to what was to be done to\r\nus. A number of Lamas were still anxious to have us beheaded, whereas the\r\nPombo and the others had the previous night almost made up their minds to\r\nsend us back to the frontier. Unfortunately, it appears[36] that the\r\nPombo had seen a vision during the night in which a spirit told him that,\r\nif he did not kill us, he and his country would suffer some great\r\nmisfortune. "You can kill the Plenki," the spirit was reported to have\r\nsaid, "and no one will punish you if you do. The Plenkis are afraid to\r\nfight the Tibetans."\r\n\r\nAmong the Lamas no important step is taken without incantations and\r\nreference to occult science, so the Pombo ordered a Lama to cut off a\r\nlock of my hair, which he did with a very blunt knife, and then the Pombo\r\nrode up with it in his hand to the lamasery to consult the oracle. The\r\nlock was handed in for inspection, and it seems that, after certain\r\nincantations, the oracle answered that I must be beheaded or the country\r\nwould be in great danger.\r\n\r\nThe Pombo rode back apparently disappointed, and now ordered that one of\r\nmy toe-nails should be cut; after which operation, performed with the\r\nsame blunt knife, the oracle was again consulted as to what should be\r\ndone, and unhappily gave the same answer.\r\n\r\nThree such consultations are usually held by the high court of the\r\nassembled Lamas, the Tibetans on the third occasion producing for the\r\noracle\'s decision a piece of a finger-nail. The Lama who was about to cut\r\nthis off examined my hands behind and spread my fingers apart, expressing\r\ngreat surprise and astonishment. In a moment all the Lamas and soldiers\r\ncame round and examined my manacled hands; a repetition of my experience\r\nat the Tucker Monastery. The Pombo, too, on being informed, immediately\r\ncame and inspected my fingers, and the proceedings were at once stopped.\r\n\r\nWhen some weeks later I was released, I was able to learn from the\r\nTibetans the reason of their amazement. My fingers happen to be webbed\r\nrather higher than usual, and this is most highly thought of in Tibet. He\r\nwho possesses such fingers has, according to the Tibetans, a charmed\r\nlife; and no matter how much one tries, no harm can be done to him.\r\nApart from the question whether there was much charm or not in my life in\r\nTibet, there is no doubt that this trifling superstition did much towards\r\nhastening the Pombo\'s decision as to what was to be our fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[36] The Tibetan Lamas stated this to the Political Peshkar Karak Sing,\r\nour frontier officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII\r\n\r\n     Our lives to be spared--An unpleasant march--Chanden Sing still\r\n     alive--A sleepless night--Towards the frontier--Long and painful\r\n     marches--How we slept at night--A map drawn with blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Pombo ordered that my life should be spared, and that I should on\r\nthat very day start on my return journey towards the Indian frontier. He\r\ntook from my own money one hundred and twenty rupees, which he placed in\r\nmy pocket for my wants during the journey, and commanded that, though I\r\nmust be kept chained up, I was to be treated kindly, and my servants\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Mansing and I were led on foot to Toxem, our guard\r\nconsisting of some fifty horsemen riding on ponies. We had to travel at a\r\ngreat speed despite our severely lacerated feet, our aching bones, and\r\nthe sores and wounds with which we were covered all over. The soldiers\r\nled me tied by the neck like a dog, and dragged me along when, panting,\r\nexhausted and suffering, I could not keep up with the ponies. We crossed\r\nseveral cold streams, sinking in water and mud up to our waists.\r\n\r\nAt Toxem, to my great delight, I beheld Chanden Sing still alive. He had\r\nbeen kept prisoner in the mud-house, where he had remained tied upright\r\nto a post for over three days, and for four days he had not eaten food\r\nnor drunk anything. He was told that I had been beheaded. He was in a\r\ndreadful condition; almost dying from his wounds, cold and starvation.\r\n\r\nWe were detained there for the night, half-choked by smoke in one of the\r\nrooms of the mud-house packed with soldiers, who, with a woman of easy\r\nmorals, gambled the whole night, and sang and swore and fought,\r\npreventing us from sleeping for even a few minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANDEN SING TIED TO A POST]\r\n\r\nThe next day at sunrise Chanden Sing and I were placed on yaks, not on\r\nriding saddles, but on pack-saddles such as those shown in the\r\nillustration in chapter xl. p. 223. Poor Mansing was made to walk, and\r\nwas beaten mercilessly when, tired and worn out, he fell or remained\r\nbehind. They again tied him with a rope by the neck and dragged him along\r\nin a most brutal manner. We had a strong guard to prevent our escaping,\r\nand they demanded fresh relays of yaks and ponies and food for themselves\r\nat all the encampments, so that we travelled very fast. In the first five\r\ndays we covered one hundred and seventy-eight miles, the two longest\r\nmarches being respectively forty-two and forty-five miles; but afterwards\r\nwe did not cover quite such great distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WHITE YAK]\r\n\r\nWe suffered considerably on these long marches, as the soldiers\r\nill-treated us and would not allow us to eat every day for fear we should\r\nget too strong. They let us have food only every two or three days, and\r\nour exhaustion and the pain caused by riding those wretched yaks in our\r\nwounded condition were terrible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP DRAWN IN BLOOD DURING CAPTIVITY]\r\n\r\nAll our property had been taken away from us, and our clothes were in\r\nrags and swarming with vermin. We were bare-footed and practically\r\nnaked. The first few days we generally marched from before sunrise till\r\nsometimes an hour or two after sunset; and when we reached camp we were\r\ntorn off our yaks and our jailers fastened iron cuffs round our ankles,\r\nin addition to those we had already round our wrists. Being considered\r\nquite safe, we were left to sleep out in the open without a covering of\r\nany kind, and often lying on snow or deluged with rain. Our guard\r\ngenerally pitched a tent under which they slept; but even when they did\r\nnot have one, they usually went to brew their tea some fifty yards or so\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nHelped by my two servants, who sat by me to keep watch and to screen me,\r\nI managed, at considerable risk, to keep a rough record of the journey\r\nback, on a small piece of paper that had remained in my pocket when I had\r\nbeen searched by the Tibetans. As I did when on the rack, I used to draw\r\nmy right hand out of its cuff, and, with a small piece of bone I had\r\npicked up as pen, and my blood as ink, I drew brief cipher notes, and a\r\nmap of the whole route back.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, as I had no instruments with which to take careful\r\nobservations, I had to content myself with taking my bearings by the sun,\r\nthe position of which I got fairly accurately by constantly watching the\r\nshadow projected by my body on the ground. Of course, when it rained or\r\nsnowed, I was altogether at a loss, and had to reckon my bearings by the\r\nobservations of the previous day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV\r\n\r\n     South of the outward journey--Severity of our\r\n     guard--Ventriloquism and its effects--Terrible but instructive\r\n     days--The Southern source of the Brahmaputra--Leaving Yutzang.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE travelled, as can be seen by the dotted red line on the map attached\r\nto this book, first W. then W.N.W., N.W., W. and N.W., following the\r\nBrahmaputra along a course South of the outward journey, until we reached\r\nthe boundary of the Yutzang[37] (central, or Lhassa) province. Our guard\r\nwere not only severe with us, but they also ill-treated us in every\r\npossible way. One or two of the soldiers, however, showed kindness and\r\nthoughtfulness, bringing us a little butter or _tsamba_ whenever they\r\ncould do so unseen by their comrades. The guard was changed so frequently\r\nthat we had no chance of making friends with them, and each lot seemed\r\nworse than the last.\r\n\r\nA very curious incident happened one day, causing a scare among them. We\r\nhad halted near a cliff, and the soldiers were some twenty yards off.\r\nHaving exhausted every means I could think of to inspire these ruffians\r\nwith respect, I resorted to the performance of some ventriloquial feats,\r\npretending to speak and to receive the answers from the summit of the\r\ncliff. The Tibetans were terror-stricken. They asked me who was up there.\r\nI said it was some one I knew.\r\n\r\n"Is it a Plenki?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nImmediately they hustled us on our yaks and mounted their ponies, and we\r\nleft the place at headlong speed.\r\n\r\nOn reaching a spot which from observations taken on my outward journey I\r\nreckoned to be in longitude 83 deg. 6\' 30" E. and latitude 30 deg. 27\' 30" N. I\r\nhad a great piece of luck. It is at this point that the two principal\r\nsources of the Brahmaputra meet and form one river, the one coming from\r\nthe N.W., which I had already followed, the other proceeding from the\r\nW.N.W. The Tibetans, to my delight, selected the southern route, thus\r\ngiving me the opportunity of visiting the second of the two principal\r\nsources of the great river. This second stream rises in a flat plain,\r\nhaving its first birth in a lakelet in approximate longitude 82 deg. 47\' E.\r\nand latitude 30 deg. 33\' N. I gave the Northern source my own name, a\r\nproceeding which I trust will not be regarded as immodest in view of the\r\nfact that I was the first European to visit both sources and of all the\r\ncircumstances of my journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF OUR GUARD]\r\n\r\nThis period of our captivity was dreary, yet interesting and instructive,\r\nfor, as we went along, I got the soldiers to teach me some Tibetan songs,\r\nnot unlike those of the Shokas in character, and from the less\r\nill-natured men of our guard I picked up, by judicious questioning, a\r\nconsiderable amount of information, which, together with that collected\r\nfrom my own observations, I have given in this book.\r\n\r\nOver a more southerly and lower pass than the Maium Pass, by which,\r\nhealthy, hopeful and free, we had entered the province of Yutzang, we now\r\nleft it, wounded, broken down, naked and prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n[37] Also written U-tzang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV\r\n\r\n     Easier times--Large encampments--Suffocating a goat--A Tarjum\'s\r\n     encampment--Tokchim--Old friends--Musicians--Charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE now proceeded in a North-westerly direction, and, once clear of the\r\nsacred Yutzang province, our guard behaved with rather less cruelty. With\r\nthe little money the Pombo had permitted me to keep we were allowed to\r\npurchase food enough to provide us with more frequent meals, and, while\r\nwe ate, the soldiers removed our handcuffs, which they temporarily placed\r\nround our ankles. Thus, with utensils lent us by our guard, we were able\r\nto cook some food; and, although we had to serve it on flat stones\r\ninstead of dishes, it seemed indeed delicious.\r\n\r\nWe crossed over our former track, and then followed it almost in a\r\nparallel line, but some miles North of it, along an undulating, clayey\r\nplateau, thus avoiding the marshy plain which we had found so troublesome\r\nto cross on our journey out. We found large numbers of black tents here\r\nand there, and one night, when we were encamped by some small lakes, we\r\nwere permitted to purchase a goat. A soldier, a good fellow who had been\r\nvery friendly to us, selected a fine fat one for us, and we were looking\r\nforward with pleasure to a solid meal, when we found to our dismay that\r\nwe had no means of despatching the animal. We could not behead it, as the\r\nTibetans would not trust us with a knife or sword, and the Tibetans\r\nthemselves refused to kill the animal for us in any other way. Eventually\r\nour soldier friend allowed his scruples to be overcome by the payment of\r\na rupee, and proceeded to kill the animal in a most cruel fashion. He\r\ntied its legs together, and, having stuffed the nostrils with mud, he\r\nheld the poor beast\'s mouth closed with one hand until it was suffocated.\r\nThe soldier during the performance revolved his prayer-wheel with his\r\nfree hand, praying fervently all the while.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIER SUFFOCATING GOAT]\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves at last in the plain, where a Tarjum\'s encampment of\r\nsome two hundred tents was to be seen, and here we remained one night.\r\nThere was a large assemblage of Lamas and soldiers. In the middle of the\r\nnight we were suddenly and roughly roused from sleep, and made to move\r\nour camp about a mile or so from the settlement; and, early in the\r\nmorning, having crossed the large stream, we proceeded in a\r\nSouth-westerly direction, reaching the encampment of the Tokchim Tarjum\r\nthe same night. Here we were met by the officers who had on a previous\r\noccasion brought us gifts, and whom we had routed with all their soldiers\r\nwhen they threatened us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STROLLING MUSICIANS]\r\n\r\nThis time they behaved very decently, the oldest of them showing us every\r\ncivility, and professing great admiration for our courage in persevering\r\nagainst such heavy odds. The old gentleman did all he could to make us\r\ncomfortable, and even called up two strolling musicians for our\r\namusement. One man wore a peculiar four-cornered head-dress made of skin.\r\nHe played with a bow on a two-stringed instrument, while his companion, a\r\nchild, danced and went through certain clumsy contortions, going round\r\nevery few minutes with his tongue thrust out to beg for _tsamba_ from the\r\naudience. The Tibetans are very charitable towards beggars, and not only\r\non this, but on other occasions, I noticed that they seldom refused, no\r\nmatter however small their donations might be, to give _tsamba_ or pieces\r\nof butter or _chura_ to the mendicants. The older musician had a square\r\nclub passed through his girdle, and at intervals he laid down his\r\ninstrument, and, using the club as a sword, gave an imitation of a\r\nmartial dance, exactly like the one I have described as performed by the\r\nShokas. Every now and then, too, he applied it to the boy\'s back and\r\nhead, to inspire him with fresh vigour, and this generally drew roars of\r\nlaughter from the audience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD BEGGAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVI\r\n\r\n     Towards Mansarowar--Mansing\'s vision--Bathing in Mansarowar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day, amidst repeated good-byes and professions of friendship on\r\nthe part of our hosts and jailers, we departed towards Mansarowar, and\r\nlate in the afternoon reached the Tucker village and Gomba, where we put\r\nup at the same _serai_ in which I had slept on my way out. All our bonds\r\nwere here removed for good, and we enjoyed comparative freedom, though\r\nfour men walked by my side wherever I went, and an equal number looked\r\nafter Chanden Sing and Mansing. Naturally we were not allowed to go far\r\nfrom the _serai_, but we could prowl about in the village. I took this\r\nopportunity to have a swim in the Mansarowar Lake, and Chanden Sing and\r\nMansing again paid fresh salaams to the gods and plunged in the sacred\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas, who had been so friendly during my former visit, were now\r\nextremely sulky and rude; and, after having witnessed our arrival, they\r\nall withdrew into the monastery, banging the gate after them. All the\r\nvillagers, too, hastily retired to their respective houses. The place was\r\ndeserted with the exception of the soldiers round us.\r\n\r\nPoor Mansing, who, worn out and in great pain, was sitting close by me,\r\nlooking vaguely at the lake, had an extraordinary vision, the result,\r\nprobably, of fever or exhaustion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sahib," said he, as if in a dream, though he was quite awake; "look,\r\nlook! Look at the crowd of people walking on the water. There must be\r\nmore than a thousand men! Oh, how big they are getting!... And there is\r\nGod ... Seva.... No, they are Tibetans, they are coming to kill us, they\r\nare Lamas! Oh, come, sahib, they are so near.... Oh, they are\r\nflying...!"\r\n\r\nI could see that the poor fellow was under an hallucination. His forehead\r\nwas burning and he was in a high fever.\r\n\r\n"They have all disappeared!" he exclaimed, as I placed my hand on his\r\nforehead and he woke from his trance.\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite stupefied for a few moments; and, on my inquiring of him\r\nlater whether he had seen the phantom crowd again, he could not remember\r\never having seen it at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TIBETAN SHEPHERD]\r\n\r\nThe natives came to visit us in the _serai_ during the evening, and we\r\nhad great fun with them, for the Tibetans are full of humour and have\r\nmany comical ways. As for ourselves, now that we were only two marches\r\nfrom Taklakot, it was but natural that our spirits were high. Only two\r\nmore days of captivity, and then a prospect of freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark when we were roused and ordered to start. The soldiers\r\ndragged us out of the _serai_. We entreated them to let us have another\r\nplunge in the sacred Mansarowar, and the three of us were eventually\r\nallowed to do so. The water was bitterly cold, and we had nothing to dry\r\nourselves with.\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour before sunrise when we were placed on our yaks and,\r\nsurrounded by some thirty soldiers, rode off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A SERAI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVII\r\n\r\n     Suna--Wilson and the Political Peshkar across the frontier--A\r\n     messenger--Our progress stopped--Diverting us over the Lumpiya\r\n     Pass--Condemned to certain death--We attack our guard--Lapsang\r\n     and the Jong Pen\'s private secretary--A document--Nearing\r\n     Kardam--Retracing our steps--Dogmar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA CHURN (OPEN)]\r\n\r\nWHEN we had been marching for several hours, our guard halted to have\r\ntheir tea. A man named Suna, and his brother and son, whom I had met in\r\nGarbyang, halted near us, and from them I heard that news had arrived in\r\nIndia that I and my two men had been beheaded, and that thereupon Doctor\r\nWilson and the Political Peshkar Karak Sing had crossed over the frontier\r\nto ascertain the facts, and to attempt to recover my baggage, &c. My joy\r\nwas intense when I heard that they were still at Taklakot. I persuaded\r\nSuna to return as fast as he could, and to inform Wilson that I was a\r\nprisoner, and tell him my whereabouts. I had barely given Suna this\r\nmessage when our guard seized the man and his brother and roughly\r\ndismissed them, preventing them from having any further communication\r\nwith us. As soon as we were on the march again, a horseman rode up to us\r\nwith strict orders from the Jong Pen of Taklakot not to let us proceed\r\nany farther towards the frontier by the Lippu Pass, which we could now\r\nhave reached in two days, but to take us round by the distant Lumpiya\r\nPass. At this time of the year the Lumpiya would be impassable; and we\r\nshould have to make a further journey of at least fifteen or sixteen\r\ndays, most of it over snow and ice, during which we, in our starved and\r\nweakened state, would inevitably succumb. We asked to be taken into\r\nTaklakot, but our guard refused, and in the meantime the Jong Pen of\r\nTaklakot had sent other messengers and soldiers to ensure the fulfilment\r\nof his orders, and to prevent our further progress.\r\n\r\nOur guard, now strengthened by the Taklakot men, compelled us to leave\r\nthe Taklakot track, and we began our journey towards the cold Lumpiya.\r\nThis was murder, and the Tibetans, well knowing it, calculated on telling\r\nthe Indian authorities that we had died a natural death on the snows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEARER OF BAD NEWS]\r\n\r\nWe were informed that we should be left at the point where the snows\r\nbegan, that the Tibetans would give us no food, no clothes and no\r\nblankets, and that we should be abandoned to our own devices. This,\r\nneedless to say, meant certain death.\r\n\r\nWe determined to stand no more, and to play our last card. After\r\ntravelling some two and a half miles westward of the Taklakot track, we\r\ndeclined to proceed any more in that direction. We said that, if they\r\nattempted to force us on, we were prepared to fight our guard, as whether\r\nwe died by their swords and matchlocks, or frozen to death on the\r\nLumpiya, was quite immaterial to us.\r\n\r\nThe guard, in perplexity, decided to let us halt there for the night, so\r\nas to have time to send a messenger to Taklakot to inform the Jong Pen,\r\nand ask for further instructions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHOKA-TIBETAN HALF-CASTE]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the order came that we must proceed, so the next morning\r\nour guard prepared to start us again towards the Lumpiya. Then we three\r\nsemi-corpses collected what little strength remained in us, and suddenly\r\nmade an attack on them with stones; whereupon, incredible as it may seem,\r\nour cowardly guard turned tail and bolted! We went on in the direction of\r\nTaklakot, followed at a distance by these ruffians, who were entreating\r\nus to make no further resistance and to go with them where they wanted us\r\nto go. If we did not, they said, they would all have their heads cut off.\r\nWe refused to listen to them, and kept them away by throwing stones at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP LOADS FOR BORAX AND GRAIN]\r\n\r\nWe had gone but a few miles when we met with a large force of soldiers\r\nand Lamas, despatched by the Jong Pen to prepare for our death. Unarmed,\r\nwounded, starved and exhausted as we were, it was useless attempting to\r\nfight against such odds. As it was, when they saw we were at liberty,\r\nthey made ready to fire on us.\r\n\r\nThe Jong Pen\'s Chief Minister, a man called Lapsang, and the Jong Pen\'s\r\nPrivate Secretary, were at the head of this party. I went to shake hands\r\nwith them and held a long and stormy palaver, but they kept firm and\r\ninsisted on our turning away from the frontier, now that we were almost\r\nwithin a stone\'s-throw of it, and we must perforce proceed by the high\r\nLumpiya Pass. Those were the Jong Pen\'s orders, and they, as well as I,\r\nmust obey them. They would not give us or sell us either animals or\r\nclothes which even the small sum of money I had on me would have been\r\nsufficient to buy; and they would not provide us with an ounce of food.\r\nWe emphatically protested, and said we preferred to die where we were. We\r\nasked them to kill us then and there, for we would not budge an inch\r\nwestwards.\r\n\r\nLapsang and the Jong Pen\'s Private Secretary now cunningly suggested that\r\nI should give them in writing the names of the Shokas who had\r\naccompanied me to Tibet, probably with the object of confiscating their\r\nland and goods. As I said I could not write Tibetan or Hindustani, they\r\nrequested me to do it in English. This I did, but substituting for the\r\nnames of my men and my signature sarcastic remarks, which must have\r\ncaused the Tibetans some surprise when they had the document translated.\r\n\r\nAs, however, they refused to kill us there and then, and as Lapsang\r\nshowed us great politeness and asked us to go by the Lumpiya Pass as a\r\npersonal favour to him, I reluctantly decided to accept their terms\r\nrather than waste any more time, now that we were so near British soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A JUMLI SHED]\r\n\r\nEscorted by this large force of men, we had nearly reached Kardam when,\r\nin the nick of time, a horseman came up at full gallop and hailed our\r\nparty. We stopped, and the man overtook us and handed Lapsang a letter.\r\nIt contained an order to bring us immediately into Taklakot.\r\n\r\nWe retraced our steps along the undulating plateau above the Gakkon\r\nRiver, and late at night we reached the village of Dogmar, a peculiar\r\nsettlement in a valley between two high cliffs of clay, the natives of\r\nwhich live in holes pierced in the cliff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WE ATTACKED OUR GUARD WITH STONES]\r\n\r\nLapsang, the Jong Pen\'s Private Secretary, and the greater portion of\r\ntheir soldiers, having changed their ponies, went on to Taklakot; but we\r\nwere made to halt here, when yet another letter came from the Jong Pen\r\nsaying he had changed his mind and we must, after all, go by the Lumpiya\r\nPass!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPSANG AND THE JONG PEN\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVIII\r\n\r\n     A Commotion--The arrival of an army--Elected\r\n     General-in-chief--How we were to slaughter the Jong Pen\'s\r\n     soldiers--My men lay down their arms--Towards Taklakot--Delaling\r\n     and Sibling--Taklakot at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the night there was a great commotion in the place, the people\r\nrunning about and shouting, and a large number of ponies with their\r\nriders arriving.\r\n\r\nTibet is farmed out, so to speak, to officials who have become small\r\nfeudal kings, and these are generally at logger-heads among themselves.\r\nTo this regal jealousy, and to disputes over the rights of the road, was\r\ndue the appearance of this new army. There were altogether some hundred\r\nand fifty men armed with matchlocks and swords. The chieftain of this\r\nband came to me with eight or ten other officers, and spoke so excitedly\r\nthat I feared there was trouble in store for us. There was indeed. These\r\nnew arrivals were officers and soldiers from Gyanema, Kardam, and Barca,\r\nand they had come with strict orders from the Barca Tarjum that we were\r\non no account to traverse his province or to cross by the Lumpiya Pass.\r\nThis was very amusing and tantalising, for we had now no way across the\r\nfrontier open to us. Our guard and some of the Jong Pen\'s men who had\r\nremained behind, finding they were in the minority, thought it prudent to\r\neclipse themselves; and I, anxious as I naturally was to get out of the\r\ncountry as quickly as possible, approved of all that the Gyanema men\r\nsaid, and urged them to fight in case the Jong Pen still insisted on my\r\ngoing through the Tarjum\'s province. All ways out of the country were\r\nbarred to us, and unless we resorted to force, I felt we would never\r\nescape at all.\r\n\r\nThe Gyanema men asked me whether I would lead them in case of a fight\r\nwith the Jong Pen\'s soldiers; and I, though not very confident of their\r\ncourage, accepted the post of General-in-chief _pro tem._, Chanden Sing\r\nand Mansing being promoted there and then to be my aides-de-camp. We\r\nspent the greater part of the night in arranging our plan of attack on\r\nthe Jong Pen\'s troops, and when all was properly settled, the Tibetans,\r\nto show their gratitude, brought me a leg of mutton, some _tsamba_, and\r\ntwo bricks of tea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMLI TRADER AND HIS WIFE IN TIBET]\r\n\r\nThe morning came, and I was given a fine pony to ride, as were also\r\nChanden Sing and Mansing. Then, followed by my Tibetan troops--a grand\r\ncavalcade--we started gaily towards Taklakot. We had been informed that\r\nthe Jong Pen was concentrating his men at a certain point on the road to\r\nbar our way: and it was this point that we must force. My Tibetans said\r\nthat they hated the Jong Pen\'s men, and swore they would slaughter them\r\nall if they made any stand.\r\n\r\n"But they are such cowards," declared one of the Tibetan officers, "that\r\nthey will run away."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIFF HABITATIONS]\r\n\r\nAll this talk stopped suddenly when we heard the distant tinkling of our\r\nenemies\' horse-bells, and though I encouraged my men as best I could, a\r\npanic began to spread among them. The Jong Pen\'s men came in sight, and\r\npresently I witnessed the strange spectacle of two armies face to face,\r\neach in mortal terror of the other.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my remonstrances, matchlocks and swords were deposited on\r\nthe ground with anxious eagerness by both parties, to show that only\r\npeaceful intentions prevailed. Then a conference was held, in which\r\neverybody seemed ready to oblige everybody else except me.\r\n\r\nWhile this was still proceeding, a horseman arrived with a message from\r\nthe Jong Pen, and at last, to everybody\'s satisfaction, permission was\r\ngranted for us to proceed into Taklakot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOKDENS NEAR TAKLAKOT]\r\n\r\nMy army retraced its steps towards the North-west, and, deposed from my\r\nhigh military post, which I had occupied only a few hours, I became again\r\na private individual and a prisoner. With a large escort we were taken\r\nalong the Gakkon, by barren cliffs and on a rocky road. We passed\r\nhundreds of _Chokdens_ large and small, mostly painted red, and _mani_\r\nwalls. Then, having descended by a precipitous track on whitish\r\nclay-soil, we reached a thickly inhabited district, where stone houses\r\nwere scattered all over the landscape. We saw on our left the large\r\nmonastery of Delaling and, a little way off, the Gomba of Sibling; then,\r\ndescribing a sweeping curve among stones and boulders, we rounded the\r\nhigh graceful cliff, on the top of which towered the fort and monasteries\r\nof Taklakot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKLAKOT FORT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIX\r\n\r\n     Free at last--Among friends--Forgetting our past\r\n     troubles--Confiscated baggage returned--A scene with\r\n     Nerba--Suna\'s message delivered--How our release was brought\r\n     about--Across the frontier--Photography at Gungi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUNDIT GOBARIA]\r\n\r\nSUCH was our anxiety, when we reached this point, lest something should\r\nhappen and we should be taken back again, that, as soon as we were across\r\nthe wooden bridge over the Gakkon, Chanden Sing and I, on perceiving the\r\nlarge Shoka encampment at the foot of the hill, lashed our ponies and ran\r\naway from our guard. Thus, galloping our hardest along the high cliff,\r\nwhere hundreds of people live in holes in the clay, we found ourselves at\r\nlast among friends again. The Shokas, who had come over to this market to\r\nexchange their goods with the Tibetans, were astounded when they saw us,\r\nrecognising us at first with difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe inquired at once, of course, for Dr. Wilson, and when we found him the\r\ngood man could, himself, barely recognise us, so changed were we. He\r\nseemed deeply moved at seeing our condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of our arrival spread in camp, we met with the greatest\r\nkindness at the hands of everybody. In a corner of Wilson\'s tent was a\r\nlarge quantity of candied sugar--several pounds; and so famished was I\r\nthat I quickly devoured the lot. Later, my Shoka friends brought in all\r\nkinds of presents in the shape of eatables, which Rubso, the Doctor\'s\r\ncook, was set to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe Political Peshkar, Karak Sing, hurried to me with a change of\r\nclothes, and other garments were given me by Dr. Wilson. My own ragged\r\nattire was literally swarming with vermin; our guard had not allowed us a\r\nsingle change of raiment, nor would they even hear of our washing. It was\r\nby a very special favour and on account of its sanctity that we were\r\nallowed to plunge in the sacred Mansarowar Lake.\r\n\r\nLater in the day my wounds and injuries were examined by Dr. Wilson, who\r\nsent his reports to the Government of India, to the Commissioner of\r\nKumaon, and to the Deputy Commissioner at Almora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. WILSON]\r\n\r\nTenderly nursed by Wilson and Karak Sing, and having partaken of plenty\r\nof good food, I found my spirits, which had fallen rather low, reviving\r\nas if by magic; and, strange to say, after a few hours of happiness, I\r\nwas already beginning to forget the hardships and suffering I had\r\nendured. I remained three days at Taklakot, during which time part of my\r\nconfiscated baggage was returned by the Tibetans, and, as can well be\r\nimagined, I was overjoyed to discover that among the things thus\r\nrecovered were my diary, note-books, maps and sketches. My firearms, some\r\nmoney, the ring I have before referred to as having been a gift of my\r\nmother, several mathematical instruments, collections, over 400\r\nphotographic negatives, and various other articles were still\r\nmissing,[38] but I was glad to get back as much as I did.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Wilson\'s tent came the Tokchim Tarjum, his private secretary\r\nNerba, whom the reader may remember as having played an important part in\r\nmy tortures, the Jong Pen\'s secretary, and old Lapsang in a fine green\r\nvelvet coat with ample sleeves. As can be seen by perusing the Government\r\nEnquiry and Report in the Appendix to this book, the above-mentioned\r\nTibetan officers admitted before the Political Peshkar, Dr. Wilson,\r\nPundit Gobaria, and many Shokas, that the account I gave of my\r\ntortures--identical with the one in these pages--was correct in every\r\ndetail. They even professed to be proud of what they had done, and used\r\nexpressions not at all flattering to the British Government, which they\r\naffected to treat with great contempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KARAK SING PAL, THE POLITICAL PESHKAR]\r\n\r\nI nearly got the Political Peshkar and the Doctor into a scrape; for my\r\nblood, the little I had left, was boiling with rage at hearing the\r\nTibetan insults. The climax came when Nerba refused to give back my\r\nmother\'s ring, which he had upon him. In a passion I seized a knife that\r\nwas lying by me, and leaped upon Nerba, the ruffian who, besides, had\r\nfired at me and had held me by the hair while my eyes were being burnt\r\nprior to my abortive execution. Wilson and Karak Sing seized and\r\ndisarmed me, but there was a general stampede of the Tibetan officers,\r\nand thus our interview and negotiations were brought to an abrupt end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANSING SHOWING CUTS UNDER HIS FEET]\r\n\r\nIn further conversation I now learnt how my release had been brought\r\nabout. Dr. Wilson and the Political Peshkar, having received the news\r\nthat my servants and myself had been beheaded, proceeded across the\r\nfrontier to make inquiries and try to recover my property. They heard\r\nthen from the man Suna, whom I had sent from Mansarowar with my message,\r\nthat I was still a prisoner, covered with wounds, in rags and starving.\r\nThey had not men enough to force their way further into the country to\r\ncome and meet me; besides, the Tibetans watched them carefully; but they,\r\ntogether with Pundit Gobaria, made strong representations to the Jong Pen\r\nof Taklakot, and, by threatening him that an army would be sent up if I\r\nwere not set at liberty, they at last obtained from the reluctant Master\r\nof the fort[39] a permission that I should be brought into Taklakot. The\r\npermission was afterwards withdrawn, but was at last allowed to be\r\ncarried into execution, and it is entirely due to the good offices and\r\nenergy of these three gentlemen that I am to-day alive and safe--though\r\nnot yet sound.\r\n\r\nPundit Gobaria, who will be remembered as having been mentioned in my\r\nearly chapters, is the most influential Shoka trader in Bhot, and on very\r\nfriendly terms with the Tibetans. He was the intermediary through whom\r\nnegotiations were carried on for my immediate release, and it was largely\r\nowing to his advice to the Jong Pen that they resulted satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GLANCE AT THE FORBIDDEN LAND FROM THE LIPPU PASS]\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest to recover sufficient strength, I recommenced the\r\njourney towards India, and, having crossed the Lippu Pass (16,780 feet),\r\nfound myself at last again on British soil. We descended by slow stages\r\nto Gungi, where, in Dr. Wilson\'s dispensary, I had to halt for a few days\r\non account of my weak condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR--FEBRUARY 1897 THE AUTHOR--OCTOBER 1897]\r\n\r\nWilson had here a quantity of my baggage, instruments, cameras, plates,\r\n&c., which I had discarded at the beginning of my journey, and I\r\nimmediately had photographs taken of my two servants and myself, showing\r\nour wounds and our shocking general condition. Photographs of my feet,\r\ntaken more than a month after I had been untied from the rack, showed a\r\nconsiderable swelling, as well as the scars, round the ankle and on the\r\nfoot where the ropes had cut into my flesh. In the full-face photograph\r\nhere reproduced can be noticed the injuries to my left eye, as well as\r\nthe marks of the hot iron on the skin of my forehead and nose. Chanden\r\nSing\'s legs, which were photographed on the same occasion, though now\r\npractically healed, were still much swollen, and the marks can be seen\r\nin the illustration where big patches of skin and flesh had been torn\r\naway by the lashes, producing nasty wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANDEN SING\'S LEGS, SHOWING MARKS OF LASHES AND WOUNDS\r\nHEALED]\r\n\r\n\r\n[38] Some of the articles missing were some months later recovered by the\r\nGovernment of India.

J. LARKIN]\r\n\r\nIT was really wonderful how soon we began to pick up again under the good\r\ncare of Dr. Wilson and the influence of proper food and clothing. When I\r\nsaw my face for the first time in a looking-glass, I nearly had a fit, so\r\nghastly did it look; but I felt more like myself when I had shaved off my\r\nbeard of several months\' growth; and, after the ever-obliging Wilson,\r\nwith a pair of blunt scissors, had spent a whole afternoon in performing\r\nthe functions of hairdresser, I began to look almost civilised again.\r\nClothes were a great nuisance at first, but I soon got into the way of\r\nwearing them.\r\n\r\nThe injuries to my spine were severe, and gave me much trouble. At times\r\nthe whole of my left side became as if paralysed. Besides, I invariably\r\nexperienced the greatest difficulty in sitting down when I had been\r\nstanding, and in getting up when I had been sitting down. Through the\r\ngreat strain they had undergone, my joints continued stiff and swollen,\r\nand remained so for months. I could see comparatively well with my right\r\neye, but was unable to use the left at all.\r\n\r\nWhen slightly better I made an excursion to Tinker, in Nepal, there\r\nbeing a pass in the neighbourhood I had not visited. Having crossed into\r\nNepal at Chongur, I followed a course towards 86 deg. (b.m.), until we came\r\nto the Zirri River, descending precipitously between high snowy ridges.\r\nThen I kept on the right bank of the Tinker River, first through forests\r\nof firs, then among barren rocks and along ravines, the track being\r\nextremely bad in some places. The general direction was 88 deg. (b.m.) until\r\nthe Tinker bridge was reached, by which the stream was crossed, from\r\nwhich point I travelled some three miles to 74 deg. (b.m.), and arrived at\r\nthe Tinker village, a few Shoka houses perched on the slope of the\r\nmountain, having for a background the magnificent snowy peaks dividing\r\nNepal from Tibet. From the village the track to the pass is easy, first\r\nto 78 deg. 30\' (b.m.), as far as the Zentim bridge, two miles off, where the\r\nDongon River, descending from 106 deg. (b.m.), meets the Zeyan Yangti,[40]\r\nand, following the latter stream for another four miles, one reaches the\r\nTinker Pass, the distance between here and Taklakot being twelve miles.\r\nAt 106 deg. (b.m.) I observed a very high snowy peak, the Dongon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANDEN SING AND MANSING ENJOYING THEIR FIRST MEAL\r\nACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THEIR CASTES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TIBETAN TEMPORARY SHED]\r\n\r\nHaving seen all that I wanted to see here I made my way back to Garbyang\r\nwith all speed, as I was anxious to return to Europe as soon as possible,\r\nand I travelled down to Askote in company of Peshkar Karak Sing. The\r\nNerpani road had fallen in two or three places, and rough shaky bridges\r\nhad been constructed across the deep precipices, one of which can be\r\nseen in the illustration below. We met with a hearty reception\r\neverywhere, and kindness after kindness was showered upon us by all\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHAKY PASSAGE ON THE NERPANI ROAD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ASKOTE--SHOWING RAJIWAR\'S PALACE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNAPSHOT OF SHOKA VILLAGERS BEING ROUTED]\r\n\r\nAt Askote I was the guest of the good old Rajiwar, in whose garden I\r\nencamped, and who bestowed upon me every conceivable care and attention.\r\nMr. J. Larkin, hastily despatched by the Government of India to conduct\r\nan Inquiry into my case, met me there, and, though still suffering much\r\npain, I insisted on turning back once more towards Tibet, to help him in\r\nhis task. By quick marches we reached Garbyang, where a deputation of\r\nShokas, who had returned from Tibet, came to me, Mr. Larkin having gone\r\non ahead. Among them I noticed several of the men who had betrayed me,\r\nand as I was told that there was no way of punishing them for their\r\ntreachery, I took justice into my own hands, proceeding with a stout\r\nstick to teach them some idea of faithfulness, whereupon the whole\r\nvillage ran up to get the fellows out of my clutches. Encouraged by the\r\nTibetans, the Shokas made some insulting remarks about Englishmen; so the\r\nfight became general until, ill as I was, and alone against some hundred\r\nand fifty men, I succeeded in routing them. The thing might justly be\r\ndoubted had I not been able to take a snap-shot of them as they fled\r\nhelter-skelter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. WILSON, MYSELF, MR. LARKIN, THE POLITICAL PESHKAR, AND\r\nJAGAT SING READY TO ASCEND THE LIPPU PASS]\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Garbyang, I overtook Mr. Larkin, and we climbed\r\ntowards the snows. We intended crossing over the Lippu Pass into Tibet to\r\ngive the Jong Pen an opportunity of being interviewed, but he refused to\r\nmeet us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TINKER IN NEPAL]\r\n\r\nAll the same, to give the Tibetans every chance, we climbed over the\r\nLippu Pass. It had been snowing heavily and it was very cold. A Shoka had\r\nonly a few days previously been lost in the snow in trying to cross over,\r\nand had been frozen to death. There were some twelve feet of snow, and\r\nthe ascent was by no means easy. However, after toiling for some two\r\nhours we reached the summit of the pass, and I slipped once more across\r\nthe boundary into Tibet. Dr. Wilson, the Political Peskhar, Jagat Sing,\r\nand two chaprassis were with us. The illustration in which Dr. Wilson\r\nappears holding an umbrella to shelter himself from the high wind, with\r\nMr. Larkin and our ponies on his right, and showing also the pile of\r\nstones and flying prayers placed there by the Shokas and Tibetans, was\r\ntaken by me on the pass. Having found a suitable spot where the wind did\r\nnot cut quite so furiously into our faces, we halted for a considerable\r\ntime and waited impatiently on the Tibetan side of the boundary for the\r\nJong Pen or his deputies, to whom letters had been sent, to come and meet\r\nus; but they did not put in an appearance, so in the afternoon of October\r\n12 I definitely turned my back on the Forbidden Land. I was still far\r\nfrom well, but was glad indeed at the prospect of seeing England and my\r\nfriends again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE LIPPU PASS]\r\n\r\nWe returned to our camp, a few hundred feet lower than the pass, where we\r\nhad left our baggage and our men, who had suffered much from mountain\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. LARKIN\'S PARTY AND MINE HALTING NEAR THE LIPPU PASS]\r\n\r\nIt was at this camp that the accompanying photograph, which represents me\r\nbathing at 16,300 feet, was taken by Mr. Larkin. Chanden Sing, having\r\nbroken the ice in a stream, poured water from a brass vessel over me,\r\nstanding, with my feet on snow, in a high wind and with the temperature\r\nat 12 deg. Fahr. I reproduce it to show that even in my reduced condition I\r\nwas able to stand an unusual degree of cold. As a matter of fact, the\r\nwater that had been taken from under the ice immediately froze on my\r\nshoulders, with the result that in a second I had icicles hanging on each\r\nside of my neck and a shawl of ice over my shoulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. LARKIN LOOKING OUT FOR THE JONG PEN FROM THE LIPPU\r\nPASS]\r\n\r\nHaving fulfilled our mission, Mr. Larkin and I returned by very quick\r\nmarches to Almora; and it was a great satisfaction to me that in\r\nconducting the Government Inquiry in an open Court, Mr. Larkin was able\r\nto obtain ample testimony from Shokas and Tibetans as to my treatment,\r\nall of which was duly reported to the Government of India, and also to\r\nthe Foreign Office and India Office in London. A copy of the Inquiry and\r\nGovernment Report will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATHING AT 16,300 FEET]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DHARCHULA. DESERTED HABITATIONS OF SHOKAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I TOLD YOU," EXCLAIMED THE OLD SAVAGE, "THAT WHOEVER\r\nVISITS THE HOME OF THE RAOTS WILL HAVE MISFORTUNE"]\r\n\r\nWinter setting in, the Shokas, who had by now all returned from Tibet,\r\nwere beginning to migrate to their winter homes at Dharchula, and when we\r\npassed the settlement many were already at work repairing the fallen-down\r\nroofs of their hibernal habitations. A large number of Tibetans with\r\ntheir sheep had also come over to winter in British territory, and their\r\nencampments could be seen all along the road wherever there was\r\nsufficient grass for their flocks. The Tibetans--Lamas and\r\nofficials--maintained a high-handed and insolent demeanour as long as we\r\nwere in Bhot, which they regarded as part of their own country; a fact\r\nobserved not only by Dr. Wilson and the Political Peskhar, who travelled\r\nwith us up to the frontier and back, as far as Askote, but also by Mr.\r\nLarkin, who more than once was astounded at the impudence of Tibetans\r\nwhen on British soil. It must, however, be said for them that the moment\r\nthey had come out of Bhot, and had to deal with Hindoos instead of\r\nShokas, their manner changed considerably. Hypocritical deference and\r\nservility replaced haughtiness and insolence. Near the frontier we\r\nencountered hundreds of yaks and ponies laden with wood which the\r\nTibetans cut from our forests, and compel our natives to take across into\r\nTibet for the consumption of those Tibetans who do not come over to our\r\nside to spend the winter.\r\n\r\nAt Askote the old Raot who had predicted ill-luck for me when I visited\r\nthe Raots\' dwelling, came to remind me of his prophecy. "I told you,"\r\nexclaimed the old savage, "that whoever visits the home of the Raots will\r\nhave misfortune," and I photographed the old scoundrel on the spot,\r\ntogether with his mates, who listened with satisfaction to the words that\r\ncame from the lips of their prophet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PICTURESQUE BIT OF ALMORA]\r\n\r\nWe proceeded with no delay to Almora, and from there went straight on to\r\nNaini Tal, the summer seat of the Government of the North-West Provinces\r\nand Oudh, where a conference was held on my case by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nHaving there enjoyed the unbounded hospitality of that able and energetic\r\nofficer, Colonel Grigg, Commissioner of Kumaon, I paid off my faithful\r\ncoolie Mansing, giving him enough for a start in life. He accompanied me\r\nto Kathgodam, the terminus of the railway, and showed genuine grief when\r\nChanden Sing and I stepped into the train. As we steamed away from the\r\nplatform, he salaamed me affectionately, having previously begged that,\r\nif ever I should go back to Tibet, I would take him with me; only next\r\ntime he too must be provided with a rifle! That was the only condition.\r\n\r\nChanden Sing, who remained as my servant, travelled with me to Bombay,\r\nand from there we went direct to Florence, the home of my parents, who\r\nhad suffered in their anxiety at home almost as much as I did in the\r\nForbidden Land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAOTS LISTENING TO THE ACCOUNT OF MY MISFORTUNES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH-WESTERN TIBET]\r\n\r\n\r\n[40] Yangti = River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from_ SIR WILLIAM LEE WARNER, C.S.I., _Political and Secret\r\nDepartment, India Office, London._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_Honi soi. qui mal y pense._"]\r\n\r\n                              INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.\r\n                                   _August_ 4, 1898.\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     With reference to the request contained in your letter of the\r\n     27th, and to your interview with me of the same day I forward\r\n     herewith for your use a copy of Mr. Larkin\'s "Inquiry and report"\r\n     into your treatment by the Tibetans.\r\n\r\n                                     Yours faithfully,\r\n                 (Signed)                  W. LEE WARNER.\r\n    A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR, Esq.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT REPORT BY J. LARKIN, ESQ., MAGISTRATE OF THE FIRST CLASS.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Arnold Henry Savage Landor having been reported to have been\r\n     captured and tortured by the Tibetans, I was sent up to Garbyang\r\n     in Byans to ascertain the facts.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Landor arrived in India on the 10th of April last. He\r\n     proceeded to Almora, where he arrived on the 27th idem. He stayed\r\n     there until the 10th of May, to make arrangements for his travels\r\n     in Tibet. At first he was advised to take some Gurkha soldiers\r\n     with him, but this fell through, as the military did not accede\r\n     to his request. He then, on the 27th May, arrived in Garbyang in\r\n     Byans _patti_. It appears to have been his intention to have\r\n     entered Tibet by the Lippu Lek Pass. This is the easiest, being\r\n     about 16,780 feet above sea level. It is the most frequented\r\n     route taken by the traders of Byans and Chaudans, and is adjacent\r\n     to Taklakot, a mart for wool, salt, borax, grain, &c. He was,\r\n     however, frustrated in this, inasmuch as the Jong Pen of Taklakot\r\n     came to know of Mr. Landor\'s intention and took steps to prevent\r\n     it. He caused bridges to be destroyed and stationed guards along\r\n     the route.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, he appears to have been kept fully cognisant of Mr.\r\n     Landor\'s moves through the agency of his spies in Garbyang.\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances Mr. Landor was compelled to resort to\r\n     some other route, and selected the Lumpia Pass, which stands at\r\n     an altitude of 18,150 feet.\r\n\r\n     On the 13th July last, Mr. Landor, with a following of thirty\r\n     men, entered Tibet. He reached Gyanima, where he was stopped by\r\n     the Barkha Tarjum. This personage, however, after some\r\n     persuasion, consented to permit Mr. Landor and seven followers to\r\n     go forward to the Mansarowar Lake.\r\n\r\n     Next day the accorded permission was withdrawn, and Mr. Landor\r\n     and his party were turned back. The party returned three marches,\r\n     when Mr. Savage Landor determined to go to Mansarowar by the\r\n     unfrequented wilds.\r\n\r\n     On the 21st July, Mr. Landor, with nine followers, at midnight in\r\n     a terrific snowstorm, climbed up the mountain and went off, the\r\n     bulk of his party continuing their retreat to the Lumpia Lek. By\r\n     this strategic move Mr. Landor baffled the Tibetan guards\r\n     (Chaukidars). He carefully avoided coming into contact with any\r\n     of the inhabitants, and in order to do so was obliged to keep to\r\n     the high mountains and unfrequented wilds.\r\n\r\n     Travelling thus, with the aid of his compass, sextant and sketch\r\n     maps, he reached Mansarowar.\r\n\r\n     Here five of his followers declined to accompany him any farther,\r\n     so he paid and dismissed them. This was at Tucker. Thus Mr.\r\n     Landor was reduced to a following of four men. He went on,\r\n     however, and had accomplished but three marches more when two\r\n     more of his followers deserted him at night. These went off with\r\n     some of his supplies, all his servants\' food, and ropes.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Landor was now reduced to the following of a bearer (Chanden\r\n     Sing) and a coolie (Mansing). Despite his misfortunes he\r\n     determined to push on: his intention appears to have been to\r\n     reach Lhassa.\r\n\r\n     He went over the Mariam La Pass.[41] This attains an altitude of\r\n     over 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile the deserters had bruited about the information of Mr.\r\n     Landor\'s intention of getting to Lhassa.\r\n\r\n     While crossing the Nio Tsambo River one of Mr. Landor\'s yaks went\r\n     under. The yak was saved, but its valuable load, consisting of\r\n     all the tinned provisions, Rs. 800 in cash, three pairs of shoes,\r\n     one slaughtered sheep, wearing apparel, razors, skinning\r\n     instruments, and some three hundred rifle cartridges, was lost.\r\n\r\n     This accident was directly the cause of Mr. Landor\'s capture, as\r\n     he and his two followers, who were footsore, starving, and\r\n     disheartened, were driven to seek food and horses from the\r\n     inhabitants of the country. On the 19th of August 1897 they went\r\n     to a place called Toxem. The villagers received them well and\r\n     promised to supply them with food and horses. Next morning, the\r\n     20th idem, a number of Tibetans came to Mr. Landor\'s tent\r\n     bringing food and ponies.\r\n\r\n     While Mr. Landor and his servants were engaged trying and\r\n     selecting ponies, the crowd increased and came up behind its\r\n     three victims.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly, without any warning, the Tibetans rushed on Mr. Landor\r\n     and his two servants, and overwhelming them by numbers, made\r\n     prisoners of them. They cruelly bound their surprised victims.\r\n     Then a number of soldiers (who had lain in ambush) arrived and\r\n     took over the prisoners. The first person to be dealt with was\r\n     the bearer Chanden Sing. He was accused of having taken his\r\n     master into Tibet. He was questioned as to this, and also as to\r\n     the maps and sketches found with Mr. Landor\'s things. I may\r\n     mention that when the arrests were made the Tibetans took all of\r\n     Mr. Landor\'s property, which they handled very roughly, damaging\r\n     most of the things. Hearing the Tibetans accuse the bearer, Mr.\r\n     Landor called out that his servant was in no way responsible for\r\n     his having entered Tibet. Thereupon a Lama struck him (Mr.\r\n     Landor) a blow on the head with the butt-end of his riding-whip.\r\n     Chanden Sing was then tied down and flogged. He received two\r\n     hundred lashes with whips, wielded by two Lamas. Then the\r\n     prisoners were kept apart for the night, bound with cords. Next\r\n     day Mr. Landor was placed on a horse, seated on a spiked\r\n     pack-saddle. Mansing was put on a bare-backed horse. They still\r\n     were bound. Mr. Landor\'s arms were secured behind his back. Thus\r\n     they were taken off at a gallop towards Galshio. When the party\r\n     were nearing that place they came up with a party of Lamas,\r\n     awaiting them by the roadside. Here Mr. Landor\'s horse was\r\n     whipped and urged to the front. A kneeling soldier, his musket\r\n     resting on a prop, fired at Mr. Landor as he went past. The shot\r\n     failed to take effect. Then they stopped the pony and fastened a\r\n     long cord to Mr. Landor\'s handcuffs. The other end was held by a\r\n     soldier on horseback. The party then continued their career, the\r\n     Lamas having fallen in. While proceeding at full gallop, the\r\n     horseman who held the cord attached to Mr. Landor\'s handcuffs,\r\n     pulled hard at it to try and unhorse the latter. Had this\r\n     occurred Mr. Landor must have been trampled to death under the\r\n     troop of horsemen behind him. Thus they hurried onward till they\r\n     neared Galshio,[42] when at a turn in the road a soldier was seen\r\n     kneeling at the "ready," who fired a shot at Mr. Landor as he\r\n     came abreast of him. This, like the previous shot, missed its\r\n     object.\r\n\r\n     Arriving at Galshio, Mr. Landor was torn off his pony. He was in\r\n     a bleeding state, the spikes in the pack-saddle having severely\r\n     wounded his back. He asked for a few minutes\' respite, but was\r\n     jeeringly told by his guards that it was superfluous, as he was\r\n     to be beheaded in a few minutes. He was then taken, his legs\r\n     stretched as far as they could be forced apart, and then tied to\r\n     the sharp edge of a log shaped like a prism. The cords were bound\r\n     so tightly that they cut into the flesh.\r\n\r\n     Then a person named Nerba, the secretary of the Tokchim Tarjum,\r\n     seized Mr. Landor by the hair of his head, and the chief\r\n     official, termed the _Pombo_, came up with a red-hot iron, which\r\n     he placed in very close proximity to Mr. Landor\'s eyes. The heat\r\n     was so intense that for some moments Mr. Landor felt as if his\r\n     eyes had been scorched out. It had been placed so close that it\r\n     burned his nose. The _Pombo_ next took a matchlock, which he\r\n     rested on his victim\'s forehead and then discharged upwards.\r\n\r\n     The shock was consequently very much felt. Handing the empty gun\r\n     to an attendant soldier, the _Pombo_ took a two-handed sword. He\r\n     laid the sharp edge on the side of his victim\'s neck as if to\r\n     measure the distance to make a true blow. Then wielding the sword\r\n     aloft, he made it whiz past Mr. Landor\'s neck. This he repeated\r\n     on the other side of the neck.\r\n\r\n     After this tragic performance Mr. Landor was thrown to the ground\r\n     and a cloth put over his head and face to prevent his seeing what\r\n     was being done to his servant Mansing. This must have been done\r\n     to make Mr. Landor believe that Mansing was being executed. After\r\n     a short time the cloth was removed and Mr. Landor beheld his\r\n     servant, with his legs stretched, tied to the same log. Mr.\r\n     Landor was kept for twenty-four hours in this trying position,\r\n     legs stretched as far as possible and arms bound to a pole, and\r\n     Mansing for twelve hours. To add to their misery they were kept\r\n     in the rain and were afterwards seated in a pool of water. The\r\n     effect of this torture was to strain the muscles of the legs and\r\n     arms and injure the spine.\r\n\r\n     When Mr. Landor\'s legs were unloosed from their cords, they were\r\n     so numbed and swollen that for sixteen hours he did not recover\r\n     the use of them and feared they were mortifying. Mr. Landor\'s\r\n     property was overhauled by the officials of Galshio and sealed\r\n     up. On the afternoon of the third day at Galshio, the two\r\n     prisoners were taken on foot to Toxem. It was a very trying\r\n     march, inasmuch as several rivers had to be crossed.\r\n\r\n     On his arrival at Toxem, Mr. Landor saw his bearer Chanden Sing\r\n     in a very precarious condition, as the latter had had no food for\r\n     four days. During all this time the prisoners were firmly bound\r\n     and carefully guarded. Next day, Mr. Landor and Chanden Sing were\r\n     placed on yaks. Mansing had to walk. Thus they were taken in the\r\n     direction of Mansarowar Lake. It was only on arrival at\r\n     Mansarowar that his guards unbound Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n     Arriving at Dogmar the party was stopped by the Jong Pen of\r\n     Taklakot, who refused to give them passage through his district.\r\n     This was a very serious affair, as it meant that the worn-out\r\n     prisoners would have to be taken by a long circuitous route\r\n     _via_ Gyanima and into India by the Lumpia Pass. This would\r\n     probably have done for them. Owing to the intervention of the\r\n     Rev. Harkua Wilson, of the Methodist Episcopal Mission, _Peshkar_\r\n     Kharak Sing Pal and Pundit Gobaria, the most influential person\r\n     among the Bhutias[43] of Byans, the Jong Pen was compelled to\r\n     withdraw his prohibition and give his sanction to the prisoners\r\n     being conveyed to Taklakot.\r\n\r\n     Arriving at this place the prisoners were hospitably received by\r\n     the Rev. Harkua Wilson, who is also a medical man. He examined\r\n     their injuries and attended to them. His statement discloses the\r\n     dreadful condition he found them in. The Tibetan guards made over\r\n     some of Mr. Landor\'s property to him at Taklakot. It was then\r\n     found that much property had not been restored. Mr. Landor had a\r\n     list drawn up from memory of his unrestored property. This list\r\n     (a copy) was handed to the Jong Pen of Taklakot.\r\n\r\n     I append the list. The Jong Pen has been called upon to restore\r\n     the missing articles. He urges that the affair did not occur in\r\n     his district, and that he is in no way responsible for the loss\r\n     of the property.\r\n\r\n     He has, however, promised to try to recover them, alleging that\r\n     the affair has been reported to a superior authority at Gartok.\r\n     From what I could gather here, it seems probable that all the\r\n     missing property, save the money, will be restored. I tried to\r\n     see the Jong Pen, but he pleaded illness, and the inutility of a\r\n     meeting in which he had nothing new to disclose. This personage\r\n     is notorious in these parts for his implacable hatred to English\r\n     subjects.\r\n\r\n     The account of the affair as given by Mr. Savage Landor is fully\r\n     borne out by his two servants, and, moreover, the Tibetans who\r\n     took part in it did not try to hide it.\r\n\r\n     In the Rev. Harkua Wilson\'s tent at Taklakot, before _Peshkar_\r\n     Kharak Sing, Gobaria and a large number of Bhutias, several\r\n     Tibetan officials corroborated the whole account as related by\r\n     Mr. Landor. The man Nerba, who had held Mr. Landor\'s hair when\r\n     about to be beheaded and have his eyes burnt out, admitted he had\r\n     taken such part in the affair. There can be no doubt that the\r\n     above account is true and unexaggerated, for the whole of Byans\r\n     and Chaudans are ringing with it. The Jong Pen of Taklakot was\r\n     given ample opportunity to explain the affair, but he declined to\r\n     do so.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Savage Landor held Chinese passports, and his conduct during\r\n     his stay in that country did not warrant the officials to have\r\n     treated him in the barbarous, cruel way they did. I satisfied\r\n     myself, by careful inquiry from the people here, as to how Mr.\r\n     Landor behaved.\r\n\r\n     He is said to have been most munificent in his dealings with all,\r\n     and invariably affable and courteous. I had seen Mr. Landor just\r\n     before his entry into Tibet, and when I met him I could scarcely\r\n     recognise him, though he had then fairly recovered from the\r\n     terrible treatment he had received. I saw the marks of the cords\r\n     on his hands and feet, and they are still visible after this\r\n     lapse of time. He complains that he is still suffering from the\r\n     injury done his spine, and fears that it may be of a permanent\r\n     nature.\r\n\r\n                                    J.

LARKIN, Esq., Magistrate of the 1st class.\r\n\r\n     _In re_ The Matter of the Tortures, Robbery, &c., of A. HENRY\r\n     SAVAGE LANDOR, Esq., and his servants, by the Thibetan\r\n     Authorities.\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF MR. A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR; _taken on the 4th day of\r\nOctober 1897. Oath administered by me._\r\n\r\n     My name is Arnold Henry Savage Landor; my father\'s name is\r\n     Charles Savage Landor; I am by caste European. British subject;\r\n     by occupation artist and traveller; my home is at Empoli\r\n     (Calappiano), police station Empoli, district Florence, Tuscany,\r\n     Italy; I reside at London.\r\n\r\n     Having made up my mind to travel in Turkistan and Tibet, for\r\n     geographical and scientific purposes as well as to study the\r\n     manners and customs of those people, I obtained a British\r\n     passport from the Foreign Office and one from the Chinese\r\n     Legation in London. I had already a passport granted me by the\r\n     Chinese Government through the British Consul at Tientsin, China.\r\n     I also possess letters from Lord Salisbury and the officials of\r\n     the British Museum. I am prepared to submit all these for\r\n     scrutiny. I arrived in India by the P. and O. ss. _Peninsular_\r\n     about the beginning of April. I travelled rapidly up to Almora. I\r\n     stayed there a short time to make arrangements for my travels in\r\n     Tibet. I entered that country through the Lumpia Lek. I kept away\r\n     from the road and paths, passing over several ranges of high\r\n     mountains, camping at very high altitudes, for nearly three\r\n     weeks. When I started I had thirty men with me. Twenty-one of\r\n     them left me when I was only five days in. At Mansarowar Lake\r\n     five Shokas declined to go any farther. I paid them up and they\r\n     left. It was they who gave the Lamas of Tucker information of my\r\n     intention to go to Lhassa. I had proceeded but three marches\r\n     towards the Maium La Pass when my only two remaining Shokas\r\n     deserted during the night. They carried off all my stock of\r\n     provisions for my Hindu servants, ropes, straps, &c. My party had\r\n     now dwindled down to Chanden Sing (bearer) and Man Sing (coolie).\r\n     The latter was ill; I fear he is developing leprosy. His feet\r\n     were in a very sore and cut condition, hence he could scarcely\r\n     get along. I went over the Maium Pass and followed the course of\r\n     the Brahmaputra River for many troublesome marches, until we\r\n     reached the Neo Tsambo (river), in crossing which one of my yaks\r\n     sank and its load went down and was lost. I tried hard, by\r\n     diving and swimming in this very cold and rapid river, to recover\r\n     my goods, but failed to do so, owing to the depth and muddiness\r\n     of the water. The load contained all my provisions, some clothes,\r\n     and all my shoes, cash rupees eight hundred, my lantern, some\r\n     ammunition, and sundry knives and razors. This misfortune drove\r\n     me to Toxem, which place we reached in a state of starvation. It\r\n     had taken us several days to get there. Owing to the weak,\r\n     fatigued, and starved condition of my two followers, I had to\r\n     seek to get them food and horses, as it was impossible for them\r\n     to get on without horses. I would not desert them, as I might\r\n     have, as I was still prepared to push on despite the many\r\n     difficulties I had to encounter hourly. Toxem consisted of one\r\n     mud house and an encampment of about eighty tents. The shepherds\r\n     received us kindly and consented to sell me horses and\r\n     provisions. I encamped for the night about two miles beyond the\r\n     settlement. During the evening several persons visited my\r\n     encampment, bringing me gifts of provisions. I invariably gave\r\n     them money in return, certainly three or four times more than the\r\n     value of the articles presented. During the night I was disturbed\r\n     several times, and went out into the darkness, but failed to\r\n     discover any one. This, however, was my nightly experience; hence\r\n     I grew to attach little moment to these noises. In the morning\r\n     (August 20), two or three Thibetans came offering to sell me\r\n     provisions and ponies. While I and my two servants were engaged\r\n     examining and selecting ponies, I noticed that numbers of\r\n     villagers came up one by one, spinning their wool or carrying\r\n     bags of _tsamba_ (meal), while others arrived with more ponies.\r\n     My servants, overjoyed at the hope of getting mounts, rode first\r\n     one pony and then another to suit themselves, Chanden Sing,\r\n     having selected one, called me to see it and try it. I walked to\r\n     the spot, which was about a hundred yards from my tent. Naturally\r\n     I was unarmed. The demeanour of these people had been so friendly\r\n     that it gave me no cause to suspect that any treachery was\r\n     anticipated. While I stood with my hands behind my back, enjoying\r\n     the delight of my long-suffering servants, I was suddenly seized\r\n     from the back by several persons. I was seized simultaneously by\r\n     the neck, arms, wrists, and legs, and was thrown down in a prone\r\n     position. I fought and struggled and managed to shake off some of\r\n     my captors, so that I was able to regain my feet; but others\r\n     rushed up and I was quickly surrounded and overpowered by\r\n     twenty-five or thirty persons. Ropes were thrown round my neck,\r\n     legs and body, and thus entangled, I was thrown three several\r\n     times more to the ground. I fought with my head, teeth, legs,\r\n     arms, and succeeded in regaining my legs four times. They\r\n     overcame me at last by strangling me with the rope which they had\r\n     thrown round my neck. Then they bound me hand, foot, and neck.\r\n     When I had an opportunity to look round, I saw Chanden Sing\r\n     struggling against some fifteen or twenty foes. He was quickly\r\n     entangled, thrown, and secured by ropes. Even Man Sing, the weak\r\n     and jaded coolie, was overcome by four stout powerful men, though\r\n     he was not able to offer any resistance. He, too, was bound.\r\n     While we were struggling against our treacherous foes, some\r\n     person gave a signal--a shrill whistle--which brought up an\r\n     ambush of four hundred armed soldiers. These soldiers took up a\r\n     position round us and covered us with their muskets. Then they\r\n     searched us and rifled us of any things we had in our pockets.\r\n     They next proceeded to my tent and took possession of everything\r\n     I possessed. They sealed up my things in bags subsequent to\r\n     having overhauled and examined them. Then with shouts and hisses\r\n     they led us prisoners to Toxem. There we were separated, being\r\n     placed in separate tents. Guards of many armed soldiers were\r\n     placed to watch us. In the afternoon of the same day a _Pombo_ (a\r\n     man in authority), with several high Lamas and military officers,\r\n     held a Court under a gaudy tent. I saw Chanden Sing led forward\r\n     to this Court. I was led to the rear of the mud-house to preclude\r\n     my witnessing the scene. I heard Chanden Sing being interrogated\r\n     in a loud angry tone and accused of having been my guide. Next I\r\n     heard Chanden Sing\'s moans and groans. Then a company of soldiers\r\n     led me before this tribunal. I was ordered to kneel, and as I\r\n     would not do so, they tried to compel me to do so by forcing me\r\n     on my knees. I succeeded in maintaining a standing posture. Then\r\n     I beheld my servant Chanden Sing lying down, stripped from the\r\n     waist downwards, in the midst of a number of Lamas and soldiers.\r\n     I saw two stalwart Lamas, one on each side of him, castigating\r\n     him with knotted leather thongs. They were laying on him with\r\n     vigorous arms from his waist to his feet. He was bleeding. As I\r\n     could not be compelled to kneel, I was allowed to sit down before\r\n     the _Pombo\'s_ officer. Then my note-books and printed maps were\r\n     produced, and I was interrogated, first as to the route I had\r\n     taken, then as to why I had drawn my maps and sketches. I\r\n     explained as best I could, partly through my servant Chanden Sing\r\n     and partly through an interpreter (a person who styled himself a\r\n     Gurkha and who knew a little Hindustani. He wore the garb of the\r\n     Tibetan). I explained to the officers that Chanden Sing, my\r\n     servant, did not know the route or anything about the maps and\r\n     sketches; that I had brought him as my servant, and that I alone\r\n     was responsible for the route taken by me, and for the maps and\r\n     sketches; that my servant was not to be punished; that I should\r\n     be if anybody was punishable. Thereupon one of the Lamas struck\r\n     me a hard blow on the head with the butt-end of his riding-crop,\r\n     and they continued to castigate my servant Chanden Sing. I was\r\n     led away captive, but nevertheless heard the moans of my\r\n     unfortunate servant. It began raining heavily, and I was taken to\r\n     a tent, where I was cruelly bound. Soldiers were placed within\r\n     and without the tent to guard me. I was thus kept the greater\r\n     part of the night with my arms manacled behind my back and my\r\n     legs bound. I was so bound that rest or sleep was impossible. The\r\n     tent was swarming with vermin, which quickly covered me; and I\r\n     may here remark that I suffered unspeakable tortures from this\r\n     pest all the time I was in captivity, as I was never permitted to\r\n     wash, bathe, or change my clothes. In the tent my guard lighted\r\n     a fire of yak\'s dung, and the tent was filled with a suffocating\r\n     smoke, which well-nigh choked me. I was placed near a heap of\r\n     this stinking fuel. I must say that it was a night full of\r\n     indescribable misery for me. Though I was fasting all that day\r\n     and night, yet my cruel jailers gave me no food. I was thus kept\r\n     a prisoner the following day until about 3 or 4 P.M. Then a\r\n     soldier entered the tent and informed me that I was to be\r\n     flogged, my legs broken, my eyes burnt out, and then beheaded. I\r\n     merely laughed at him; I could not but think that this was said\r\n     merely to intimidate me. Half an hour later another person\r\n     arrived and signalled to my guard to lead me out. Not considering\r\n     me sufficiently secure already, they tightened my bonds and tied\r\n     others round my body. In this fashion I was taken to the sole\r\n     house (mud one) in the encampment. Here an enormous pair of heavy\r\n     handcuffs were put on my hands, which were still kept behind my\r\n     back. Even in this the treachery of my captors was shown, for\r\n     they patted me on the back and called me a good man and told me I\r\n     was to be taken back to Taklakot. This they said fearing I would\r\n     resist. Then, after locking the handcuffs, they made the key over\r\n     to one person, who rode away quickly with it lest I might\r\n     possibly manage to get the key and unlock my handcuffs. For this\r\n     reason I was never permitted to see or know who carried the key.\r\n     Just then I heard the voice of my servant, Chanden Sing, calling\r\n     to me in a very weak tone. He said: "_Hazur! Hazur! Hum\r\n     murjaiega!_" I endeavoured to get to the poor wretch\'s\r\n     assistance. Upon my trying to move towards him my several guards\r\n     sprang upon me and ruthlessly grappled me and threw me on to the\r\n     back of a horse. I could only call aloud to my poor servant that\r\n     I was being taken to Taklakot that day, and that he would be\r\n     brought after me the following day. I noticed that Chanden Sing\r\n     was roughly seized and hurled back into one of the rooms of the\r\n     house, so that we could hold no conversation. My other servant,\r\n     Man Sing, had his arms pinioned, and he was put on a bare-backed\r\n     pony. The saddle of the horse I had been thrown upon is worthy of\r\n     description. It was merely the wooden frame of a very high-backed\r\n     saddle. From this high projecting back or crupper four or five\r\n     sharp iron spikes were sticking out. These caught me on the small\r\n     of my back. My guard was then augmented by some twenty or thirty\r\n     mounted soldiers with muskets and swords. My pony was held by a\r\n     horseman, who rode before me. We set off at a furious gallop.\r\n     Thus we travelled for miles until we arrived at a spot where the\r\n     _Pombo_ with a following of Lamas, banner-men, and soldiers, some\r\n     two hundred in all, were drawn up. Here my pony was allowed to go\r\n     on first, and the others reined up and drew aside. As I passed\r\n     before the _Pombo_ and his following a person named Nerba (the\r\n     Private Secretary of the Tokchim Tarjum) deliberately knelt and\r\n     fixed his musket on its rest and fired at me from a few paces.\r\n     The bullet whizzed past me: I was still at a gallop, which no\r\n     doubt saved my life, as the marksman could not take a steady aim.\r\n     My pony took fright and reared and plunged, but I maintained my\r\n     seat, though I was being cruelly pricked by the spikes in the\r\n     crupper. My pony was then seized and a long cord with a swivel at\r\n     the end was fastened to my handcuffs. The cord was about fifty\r\n     yards long. The other end was held by a horseman. In this way we\r\n     all set off at a hard gallop, and in order to accelerate the\r\n     speed, a horseman rode by my side and he lashed my pony furiously\r\n     to make it go at its hardest; meanwhile the horseman who held the\r\n     cord did his utmost to pull me out of the saddle, so that I would\r\n     have of a certainty been trampled to death by the cohort behind\r\n     me. While thus riding furiously with my arms extended backwards I\r\n     had the flesh rubbed off my hands and knuckles, so much so that\r\n     the bone was exposed in places, and as the horseman at the back\r\n     tugged to get me off and I clung hard with my knees, every tug\r\n     brought me into forcible contact with the spikes in the crupper\r\n     and wounded me cruelly. The cord was one made of yak\'s hair. It\r\n     was strong, but it eventually gave way. The shock unhorsed the\r\n     soldier. I was all but thrown. This ludicrous incident provoked\r\n     much mirth among my guards. They stopped my pony and the runaway\r\n     steed of the dismounted cavalier. The cord was retied with sundry\r\n     strong knots, and after an interruption of a few minutes we\r\n     resumed our breakneck gallop, I being in front. When nearing\r\n     Galshio, and as I was going round the curve of a sandhill, a\r\n     soldier, who had been posted in ambush, fired a shot at me from a\r\n     few paces distant. The shot did not strike me. This incident did\r\n     not stop our headlong career, and we continued on until we\r\n     arrived at Galshio about sunset. This was the 21st August last.\r\n     At this place there is a large monastery on the crown of a low\r\n     hill. At some distance from the base of the hill, and on the\r\n     plain, was pitched the large white tent of the _Pombo_. Our\r\n     cavalcade drew up there. I was then roughly torn out of my saddle\r\n     by two or three men. I requested to stop for one moment. My\r\n     captors refused me this and, roughly thrusting me forward, said\r\n     that, as I was about to be beheaded in an instant, it was\r\n     unnecessary. I was hustled to the left front of the tent, where,\r\n     on the ground, lay a log of wood in the shape of a prism. Upon\r\n     the sharp edge of it I was made to stand. I was held by the body\r\n     by several persons, while others pulled my legs as wide apart as\r\n     they could be stretched. Then my feet were very securely tied by\r\n     cords of yak-hair. The cords were so tight that they cut into the\r\n     flesh in numerous places, some of the cuts or wounds being about\r\n     three inches long. When I was thus secured one ruffian (Nerba),\r\n     whom I have alluded to above, came forward and seized me by the\r\n     hair of my head. He pulled my hair as hard as he could. My hair\r\n     was long, as I had not had it cut since the day preceding my\r\n     departure from London about the middle of March. The others\r\n     formed up in front of me in a semicircle. Then the _Pombo_ arose\r\n     and was handed a bar of iron, which had been made red hot in a\r\n     brazier, the end grasped by the _Pombo_ being bound round with\r\n     red cloths. He strode up to me, urged on by the Lamas, and said\r\n     jeeringly that as I had gone to see the country, my punishment\r\n     would be to have my eyes burnt out. This was in allusion to what\r\n     I had said at Toxem, viz.--that I was a traveller and merely\r\n     wished to see the country. He then placed the red-hot bar of iron\r\n     parallel to and about an inch and a half or two inches from my\r\n     eyeballs, and all but touching the nose. The heat was so intense\r\n     that it seemed as if my eyes were desiccated and my nose\r\n     scorched. There is still a mark of the burn on my nose. I was\r\n     forced to shut my eyes instinctively. He seemed to me to have\r\n     kept the bar of heated iron before my eyes for fully thirty\r\n     seconds or so. After some moments I opened my eyes and beheld the\r\n     hot iron on the ground. I saw him take a musket from the hands of\r\n     one of the soldiers standing by. He placed this against my\r\n     forehead and discharged it upwards, giving me a severe shock,\r\n     though nothing worse. Handing back the discharged weapon to the\r\n     soldier, the _Pombo_ seized a long two-handed sword and came at\r\n     me. He swung it from side to side, all the time foaming from his\r\n     mouth. This foaming, I believe, was produced artificially. He\r\n     then motioned to the man who all this time held me by the hair of\r\n     my head to bend my neck. I resisted with all my might to keep my\r\n     head erect. Then the _Pombo_ touched my neck with the sharp blade\r\n     of his sword as if to measure the distance for a clean, effective\r\n     stroke. Then he raised the sword and made a blow at me with all\r\n     his might. The sword passed disagreeably close to my neck, but\r\n     did not touch me. I did not flinch; and my cool indifferent\r\n     demeanour seemed to impress him, so much so that he seemed\r\n     reluctant to continue his diabolical performance, but the _posse_\r\n     of Lamas urged him on by gesticulations and vociferous shouts.\r\n     Thereupon he went through the same performance on the other side\r\n     of my neck. This time the blade passed so near that I felt that\r\n     the blow had not been more than half an inch from my neck. This\r\n     terminated the sword exercise, much to the disgust of the Lamas,\r\n     who still continued to urge the swordsman on. Then they held an\r\n     excited consultation. About this time my coolie, Man Sing, who\r\n     had frequently fallen off his bare-backed pony, arrived. The\r\n     person who held my hair then relinquished his hold, and another\r\n     person came up and gave me a forcible push, which gave me a nasty\r\n     fall on my back, straining all the tendons of my legs. Then my\r\n     servant Man Sing was brought forward and tied by his legs to the\r\n     same log of wood to which I was fastened. Then they made it\r\n     appear that they were going to behead Man Sing. I was pushed up\r\n     into a sitting posture and a cloth thrown over my head and face,\r\n     so that I could not see what was being enacted. I heard Man Sing\r\n     groan, and I concluded he had been despatched. I was left in this\r\n     terrible suspense for about a quarter of an hour. Then the cloth\r\n     was removed, and I beheld my servant lying before me bound to the\r\n     log. We both asked for food. This seemed to amuse our torturers,\r\n     for they laughed. In the meanwhile the day was beginning to wane,\r\n     and our jailers made us understand that our execution was merely\r\n     put off to the following day. After some time _tsamba_ (meal) and\r\n     tea, were brought in, and it was stuffed into our mouths by our\r\n     captors. We were kept out in the open without any shelter from\r\n     the pouring rain. We were sitting in one or two inches of rain\r\n     and were drenched and numbed with cold. I have already said my\r\n     hands were manacled from the back; so also were Man Sing\'s. But\r\n     at nightfall our captors increased our tortures by straining our\r\n     manacled arms upwards as high as they could be forced, and then\r\n     secured them to an upright pole at the back. This caused very\r\n     severe pain, straining the spine in an incredible way. Then they\r\n     tied a cord from Man Sing\'s neck to mine, the effect of which was\r\n     to make us maintain a most painful position. A guard encircled\r\n     us, and with them were two watch-dogs tied to pegs. The guard\r\n     were apparently so confident of our not being able to escape,\r\n     that they drew their heavy blankets over their heads and slept.\r\n     One of them left his sword lying by his side. This made me\r\n     conceive the plan to try to escape. Knowing the extremely supple\r\n     nature of my hands, I succeeded in drawing the right hand out of\r\n     my handcuffs. After an hour\'s anxious and stealthy work I managed\r\n     to unloose Man Sing\'s bonds round his feet. In his joy at feeling\r\n     partly free, Man Sing moved his legs rather clumsily, which the\r\n     vigilant watch-dogs detected and gave the alarm by barking. The\r\n     guard were aroused. They went and fetched lights and examined our\r\n     fastenings. I had succeeded in replacing my hand inside the\r\n     handcuff. They found Man Sing\'s bonds loose and, giving him a few\r\n     cuts with a whip, warned him that if he undid them again they\r\n     would decapitate him, and refastened them. Then they placed the\r\n     light between us and put a shelter overhead to prevent the rain\r\n     extinguishing the light. At about 6 or 7 A.M. the following day\r\n     they undid Man Sing\'s feet. I was kept all that day until sunset\r\n     in the same uncomfortable and painful posture. Thus I was kept\r\n     fully twenty-four hours. During the day my property had been\r\n     overhauled and sealed. One of the Lamas picked up my\r\n     Martini-Henry rifle and put a cartridge in the breach, but failed\r\n     to push it home firmly. He then discharged the gun. The muzzle of\r\n     the barrel burst and the face of the Lama was much injured\r\n     thereby. I laughed heartily at this, and this apparently amused\r\n     the _Pombo_, for he, too, joined in. About half an hour after\r\n     this incident my feet were untied. It was then sunset. I found I\r\n     had lost the use of my feet. It took my right foot some two or\r\n     three hours before the blood began to circulate freely, but my\r\n     left foot remained like dead until the following day. That night\r\n     my feet were secured by cords. A bowl of some boiling steaming\r\n     liquid, which I was informed was tea, was presented to me to\r\n     drink. The eagerness of the surrounding Lamas that I should\r\n     partake of it aroused my suspicion. When it was pushed up to my\r\n     lips I merely sipped it and declined it. After a short time I\r\n     felt most sharp, excruciating, pains in my stomach, which\r\n     continued for several days. I could not but conclude that the\r\n     drink proffered had been poisoned. The following day Man Sing and\r\n     I were led back on foot to Toxem, our jailers riding on horses.\r\n     We had to go at a great speed despite our severely lacerated\r\n     feet. We crossed several cold streams, sinking in mud and water\r\n     to the waist. At Toxem, to my great delight, I beheld Chanden\r\n     Sing still alive. We were detained there for that night. On the\r\n     following day we were placed on yaks\' backs and hurried off\r\n     towards Taklakot. Thus we journeyed at an unpleasantly fast pace\r\n     for fifteen days, from before daybreak to nightfall. Our guards\r\n     were bent on taking us _via_ the Lumpiya Pass; but as this meant\r\n     a long protracted journey of fifteen or sixteen days, over ice\r\n     and snow, I knew that we would, in our starved, weakened state,\r\n     succumb. We were all but naked. This was a day\'s journey on this\r\n     side of Mansarowar, where our bonds had been unloosed. We\r\n     rebelled, and it well-nigh ended in a fight, but our guards\r\n     consented to halt at Dogmar, until they sent to inquire if the\r\n     Jong Pen of Taklakot would give us passage through his\r\n     jurisdiction. After much demur we were eventually taken to\r\n     Taklakot. This arrangement, I subsequently learnt, was entirely\r\n     due to the good offices and energy of the _Political Peshkar_\r\n     Kharak Sing Pal, Rev. H. Wilson, and Pundit Gobaria. On arriving\r\n     at Taklakot we hastened to Rev. Harkua Wilson\'s tent, where we\r\n     were warmly received, attended to, fed, and clothed. My injuries\r\n     were examined by the Rev. Harkua Wilson, who is a hospital\r\n     assistant, and who will be able to depose to their nature and\r\n     extent. In this gentleman\'s tent, and in the hearing of several\r\n     persons, among whom were _Peshkar_ Kharak Sing, Rev. H. Wilson,\r\n     and Pundit Gobaria, the man Nerba, above mentioned, the Toxem\r\n     Tarjum, and the Jong Pen\'s secretary, and also Lapsang, chief\r\n     secretary to the Jong Pen, admitted that my account of the affair\r\n     was perfectly true. Some of my property, more or less damaged,\r\n     was then restored me by the Tokchim Tarjum. I then gave him two\r\n     lists, one showing articles restored me, and the other the\r\n     articles missing. The _Peshkar_, Kharak Sing, has copies of the\r\n     lists. I was in a very weak state, very exhausted through what I\r\n     had suffered and little food. It was due to the kind, liberal,\r\n     and attentive care and treatment of the Rev. H. Wilson and\r\n     _Peshkar_ Kharak Sing Pal that I recovered. The few ragged\r\n     clothes I had on were literally swarming with lice, as I had no\r\n     change of raiment, nor was I ever allowed to wash. I contracted\r\n     the vermin from the tents I was kept in and also from my guards\r\n     who at first slept round me.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n          A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR.           J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF CHANDEN SING, _taken on the 9th day of October 1897.\r\n\r\nSolemn affirmation administered by me._\r\n\r\n     My name is Chanden Sing; my father\'s name is Bije Singh; I am by\r\n     caste Thatola; thirty-two years of age; by occupation _kheti_; my\r\n     home is at That, police station Bisot, district Almora.\r\n\r\n     I took service as a bearer with Mr. Landor at Almora on the 27th\r\n     or 28th April last. I accompanied him on his trip to Tibet. We\r\n     went along through the wilds, encountering many hardships and\r\n     reached Toxem. There I insisted on my master buying ponies to\r\n     take us to Darjeeling. This resulted in our capture, for up to\r\n     then we had vigilantly kept away from the people. The people who\r\n     brought us ponies to buy played us false. They informed the\r\n     authorities, who sent soldiers, who lay in ambush behind the\r\n     sandhills until the crowd of horse dealers and lookers-on, whom\r\n     we did not suspect of treachery, surrounded and seized us. We\r\n     were bound with cords by the arms (at back) and legs. My master\r\n     was more cruelly tied than we two servants. We were taken to the\r\n     Raja,[44] who accused me of having brought my master into the\r\n     country. I was then stretched out and two strong men with whips\r\n     inflicted two hundred stripes on me. I was questioned as to the\r\n     maps. My master called out that he, not I, alone understood them,\r\n     and asked that I should not be beaten. Thereupon a Lama struck\r\n     him across the head and removed him to a distance, so that I\r\n     could not communicate with him. They took all our property. Then\r\n     we were kept separate for the night. I was put in a room and my\r\n     hands tied to a pole. I could not sleep with the pain I was in.\r\n     Next day my master, with his hands tied behind his back, was put\r\n     on a spiked saddle and tied by a long rope held by a horseman. He\r\n     went at a gallop surrounded by about fifty horsemen armed with\r\n     guns and swords. Man Sing, our coolie, was also taken with him.\r\n     My guards informed me my master was to be decapitated at Galshio,\r\n     and that I was to be beheaded where I was. On the fourth or fifth\r\n     day my master returned. Meanwhile I was a close prisoner, bound\r\n     up without food. When I saw my master he was in a pitiful state.\r\n     He was handcuffed with enormous cuffs, clothes torn to rags,\r\n     bleeding from his waist, feet and hands swollen. Next day a guard\r\n     on horseback took us back, bound as we were, on yaks\' backs,\r\n     towards Mansarowar. There I had my cords unloosed. My master was\r\n     kept bound until we got to Tangchim. We were eventually taken to\r\n     Taklakot, where the Rev. Harkua Wilson met us and saw our\r\n     condition. He attended to our wants. My master was well-nigh at\r\n     death\'s door. The Tibetans returned some of my master\'s property,\r\n     but they have kept about 475 rupees in cash, two rifles,\r\n     revolver, two files, a lot of soap, medicine, a butterfly dodger,\r\n     matches, a box of mathematical instruments, a quantity (400)\r\n     cartridges, a large box of photographic plates and negatives,\r\n     three bags. We did not molest any one, and paid more than four\r\n     times the value for any food we bought.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n                               J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF MAN SING, _taken on the 9th day of October 1897.\r\n\r\nSolemn affirmation administered by Pandit Krishnanand._\r\n\r\n     My name is Man Sing; my father\'s name is Sohan Sing; I am by\r\n     caste Pharswal; twenty-five years of age; by occupation _kheti_;\r\n     my home is at Sileri, police station Bichla Kattyur, district\r\n     Almora.\r\n\r\n     I accompanied Mr. Savage Landor into Tibet. We were surrounded\r\n     and arrested at Toxem while bargaining and selecting ponies. I\r\n     was tied up hand and foot, and again tied to a log of wood with\r\n     my master. When I begged for mercy, they threatened to behead me\r\n     and struck me on the head with the handle of a _kukri_. We were\r\n     taken to Galshio. There the Tibetans were on the point of\r\n     beheading my master. They tried to burn out his eyes. They fired\r\n     at him twice to kill him. They tried to pull him off his horse to\r\n     have him trampled upon. He was subjected to many insults and\r\n     hardships. We were kept bound and guarded until brought to\r\n     Mansarowar. There our hands were untied. Chanden Sing was with\r\n     us. He received about two to three hundred lashes at Toxem. I got\r\n     off most lightly, as when the three of us were captured and\r\n     examined, I said I was merely the yak driver and not responsible\r\n     for anything. I lost nothing, but they took my master\'s\r\n     property--three firearms, some money, and other things; I cannot\r\n     enumerate them. We were brought back to Taklakot, where we met\r\n     friends. My master was made to sit on a spiked saddle and taken\r\n     from Toxem to Galshio.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n                               J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF THE REV. HARKUA WILSON, _taken on the 9th day of October\r\n1897. Oath administered by me._\r\n\r\n     My name is Harkua Wilson. By caste Christian; forty-six years of\r\n     age; by occupation missionary; my home is at Dwarahat, police\r\n     station M. Dwara, district Almora. I reside at Gunji, Byans.\r\n\r\n     I am a missionary in the American Methodist Episcopal Society. My\r\n     work is in the northern _pattis_ or Bhot. I accompanied Mr.\r\n     Savage Landor in July last as far as Gyanima in Tibet. We went\r\n     through the Lumpiya Pass. It took us four days from Lumpiya to\r\n     get to Gyanima. At this place the Barkha Tarjam declined to allow\r\n     me to go on, but he allowed Mr. Landor (who was said to be my\r\n     brother) with four porters and three servants to go on; but the\r\n     following day he withdrew this permission. We then returned three\r\n     marches. At midnight in a snowstorm Mr. Landor went up the\r\n     mountains, determining to go through Tibet by the wilds. He had\r\n     with him nine followers. He was then in perfect health and\r\n     strength, and so were his followers. At the end of August I heard\r\n     that Mr. Landor had been arrested, and, fearing the Tibetans\r\n     would kill him, I hastened to Taklakot to do my utmost to save\r\n     him. There I learnt that Mr. Landor and his two servants were\r\n     being brought back. Hearing that it was the intention of the\r\n     Tibetans to take them _via_ the Lumpiya, I, with Pandit Gobaria,\r\n     Jai Mal, and Lata, induced the Jong Pen of Taklakot to allow Mr.\r\n     Landor to be brought to Taklakot. On the evening of 7th September\r\n     _Peshkar_ Kharak Sing arrived there. At about 11 A.M. on the 8th\r\n     September Mr. Landor, Chanden Sing, and Man Sing arrived. I took\r\n     them to my tent and heard their account of what had happened. I\r\n     could hardly recognise Mr. Landor; he looked very ill and seemed\r\n     nearly exhausted. I examined his injuries and found that his\r\n     forehead had the skin off and was covered with scabs. His cheeks\r\n     and nose were in the same state. His hair had grown long. He was\r\n     unshaven and unkempt. He was in rags and dirty, covered with\r\n     swarms of lice. His hands, fingers, and wrists were swollen and\r\n     wounded. On his spine at the waist he had an open sore, and the\r\n     parts around were swollen and red. His seat was covered with\r\n     marks of wounds caused by spikes. His feet were swollen, and so\r\n     were his ankles. The flesh about the latter was much hurt and\r\n     contused, showing marks of cords having been tightly bound round\r\n     them. He was in a very low condition. I attended to him, having\r\n     given him a bath and a change of clothes. I gave him food, but\r\n     though he said he was famished, he could scarcely eat. I am\r\n     confident, if he had been a few days longer in the hands of the\r\n     Tibetans and had been taken _via_ Lumpiya, he would have died.\r\n     After half an hour the Tibetans brought some of Mr. Landor\'s\r\n     things under seal. Some of the Tibetan officials on one side,\r\n     _Peshkar_ Kharak Sing and Gobaria and myself on the other, made\r\n     out a list of the property, which we took over, and a list was\r\n     prepared of the articles taken from Mr. Landor and which were\r\n     missing. Mr. Landor dictated the list from memory. Copies of\r\n     these lists were furnished to the Jong Pen. I kept Mr. Landor at\r\n     Taklakot until the afternoon of the 11th September. Then I\r\n     conveyed him by easy stages to Gunji, where I have a dispensary,\r\n     and attended to him. I am a hospital assistant. I sent off\r\n     reports to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. Chanden Sing\r\n     and Man Sing were also in a wretched state. The former had marks\r\n     of recent flogging from his waist to above his ankles.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n                               J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF PANDIT GOBARIA, _taken on the 13th day of October_ 1897.\r\n_Solemn affirmation administered by Pandit Krishnanand._\r\n\r\n     My name is Gobaria; my father\'s name is Jaibania; I am by caste\r\n     Garbial; forty-eight years of age; by occupation trader; my home\r\n     is at Garbyang, police station Byans, district Almora.\r\n\r\n     I heard that Mr. Landor had been arrested and brought down as far\r\n     as Rungu, and saw that the Jong Pen of Taklakot was sending men\r\n     to divert Mr. Landor by the long roundabout route _via_ the\r\n     Lumpia Pass. I went to the Jong Pen and succeeded in getting him\r\n     to allow Mr. Landor to be brought to Taklakot. Next morning Mr.\r\n     Landor and his two servants with two yaks arrived. Mr. Landor was\r\n     in a very bad state--in a dying state. A list of Mr. Landor\'s\r\n     property as received from the Tokchim Tarjum was made. Then Mr.\r\n     Landor had a list of things taken from him and not returned made\r\n     out. A Tibetan, named Nerba, who was present, admitted that he\r\n     had taken part in Mr. Landor\'s torture and had held him by the\r\n     hair. The official who had tortured Mr. Landor was the Galjo\r\n     Changjo and a Lama.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n                               J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF THE POLITICAL PESHKAR KHARAK SING, _taken on the 9th day of\r\nOctober_ 1897. _Solemn affirmation administered by me._\r\n\r\n     My name is Kharak Sing; my father\'s name is Gobind Sing; I am by\r\n     caste Pal; twenty-six years of age; by occupation _Peshkar_; my\r\n     home is at Askot, police station Askot, district Almora.\r\n\r\n     I am the Political _Peshkar_ at Garbyang in Byans. I knew and\r\n     reported that Mr. Henry Savage Landor had gone into Tibet. On the\r\n     5th September I learnt from Bhotias that he had been stopped at\r\n     Toxem and reported it. I then proceeded to Taklakot in Tibet, to\r\n     inquire into the matter. On the 7th September, at Taklakot, I\r\n     learnt that Mr. Landor was a prisoner at Dogmar, and that the\r\n     Jong Pen would not permit his being brought into Taklakot, as\r\n     this meant that Mr. Landor would have to go to Gyanima and _via_\r\n     the Lumpia Lek. I then insisted on the Jong Pen allowing Mr.\r\n     Landor a passage to Taklakot, and warned him of the consequences\r\n     if he declined. The Jong Pen consented, but gave orders that Mr.\r\n     Landor should be conveyed hurriedly by night through Taklakot to\r\n     the Lippu Lek. I protested against this, and eventually Mr.\r\n     Landor, on 8th September, was conveyed into Taklakot. The Jong\r\n     Pen had sent two _sawars_ to his guard to admit them. In the Rev.\r\n     Harkua Wilson\'s tent Mr. Landor related how he had been tortured.\r\n     There were several of the Tibetans present who had taken part in\r\n     the tortures, and they signified that all of Mr. Landor\'s story\r\n     was true. Among them was Nerba, of Thokchim Tarjum, who admitted\r\n     that he had held Mr. Landor by the hair when about to be\r\n     beheaded, and had cut the nails of his fingers and toes. He\r\n     admitted he had taken a gold ring from Mr. Landor, which a\r\n     soldier had taken from him. I made a report of all this and sent\r\n     (1) a list of Mr. Landor\'s property restored him by the Tibetans\r\n     and (2) a list of articles missing. I know Mr. Landor had two\r\n     rifles and a revolver when he went into Tibet and a considerable\r\n     amount of money. Mr. Landor was in a very critical position; he\r\n     was past recognition. He was wounded on the face, body, hands,\r\n     and legs. I went to the Jong Pen and protested at the treatment\r\n     given Mr. Landor. The former boldly admitted that Mr. Landor had\r\n     been treated as alleged, and that it was their duty to act so.\r\n     The Jong Pen promised to try and have Mr. Landor\'s missing\r\n     property restored to him. I know he wrote off to the Garban of\r\n     Gartok about orders issuing to the Toxem Tarjum. He has engaged\r\n     to send me anything recovered.\r\n\r\n     Read over to witness.\r\n\r\n                               J. LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF SUNA, _taken on the 14th day of October 1897.

Owing to the rarefied air, I and the other men accompanying\r\n     Mr. Landor were unable to go as far as he did. Mr. Landor was at\r\n     the time carrying on him a weight of thirty seers (60 lbs.),\r\n     consisting of silver rupees, two aneroids, cartridges, revolver,\r\n     &c. During the whole time I travelled with Mr. Landor he always\r\n     carried the above weight on him, and generally carried his rifle\r\n     besides (71/4 lbs. extra). We all suffered very much during the\r\n     ascent, as the incline was very steep, and there was deep snow\r\n     and much troublesome _debris_.\r\n\r\n     I also certify that I took many photographs[45] of Mr. Landor and\r\n     his two servants after they were released, and Mr. Landor looked\r\n     then very old and suffering, owing to starvation and the wounds\r\n     that had been inflicted upon him by the Tibetans.\r\n\r\n        (Signed)                  H.

LANDOR,\r\n\r\n     Do you remember the night when we separated near Lama Chokden in\r\n     Tibet, you to proceed towards Lhassa, and I to return to India?\r\n\r\n     I have in my lifetime, seen few such fierce snowstorms. The storm\r\n     had been raging the whole day and night, and the wind was blowing\r\n     so hard that we could not hear each other speak. I can only\r\n     recollect with horror at the dreadful anxiety I was in when you,\r\n     with a handful of men, escaped from the Tibetan soldiers watching\r\n     us, and in the dark fearful night proceeded to take your men up\r\n     the mountain range, with no path, and among loose stones and\r\n     boulders, a way, indeed, not even fit for goats.\r\n\r\n     That night, I well remember, you were carrying a weight much\r\n     greater than the one you usually carried, thirty seers (60 lbs.),\r\n     for when you left the tent you had in your hand a small bag with\r\n     200 extra silver rupees, and you carried your revolver, your\r\n     rifle, and some extra ammunition. I assure you that I look back\r\n     with amazement at how you succeeded in pulling through the\r\n     dangers and difficulties of that night alone.\r\n\r\n                                 Yours sincerely,\r\n              (Signed)                      H. WILSON,\r\n                        _American Methodist Episcopal Mission._\r\n\r\n\r\n              DR. H. WILSON\'S _Statement_.\r\n\r\n     I herewith certify that, having heard at Gungi (Byas) that Mr. A.\r\n     Henry Savage Landor, after losing all his provisions in a large\r\n     river, had been captured by the Tibetans at Toxem and had there\r\n     been tortured, I proceeded to Taklakot (Tibet) in the hope of\r\n     obtaining further news. At Taklakot the news was confirmed, and I\r\n     heard that Mr. Landor and two servants were brought back under a\r\n     strong guard. Some uncertainty prevailed as to what route he\r\n     would be made to follow, and efforts were made by the Tibetans to\r\n     make him proceed by the long, cold, and dangerous route _via_ the\r\n     Lumpiya Pass, instead of by the shorter and easier route _via_\r\n     Taklakot. We heard that Mr. Landor and his two men were in very\r\n     poor health owing to the ill-treatment by the Tibetans, and no\r\n     doubt the long journey over ice and snow by the Lumpiya Pass left\r\n     but little chance of their reaching Gungi alive. At the request\r\n     of Jaimal Bura, Latto Bura and myself, Pundit Gobaria despatched\r\n     a man to the Jong Pen at Kujer to explain that we would be\r\n     thankful and would consider it a great kindness if he would allow\r\n     Mr. Landor to travel through Taklakot. At last, after much\r\n     trouble, our request was granted. The officer who brought us the\r\n     news informed us that Mr. Landor would be made to pass through\r\n     Taklakot at night, and conveyed directly over the Lippu Pass. The\r\n     Political Peshkar Kharak Sing Pal arrived in Taklakot that day\r\n     from India, and we held a consultation. We agreed to keep a\r\n     watchman in the road all night, but Mr. Landor did not go by. In\r\n     the afternoon of the 8th, Mr. Landor and his two men arrived.\r\n     They had been rifled of all they possessed and their clothes were\r\n     torn and dirty. Mr. Landor and the two men looked very ill and\r\n     suffering, Mr. Landor\'s face being hardly recognisable. He and\r\n     his bearer Chanden Sing gave us an account of the tortures that\r\n     had been inflicted upon them at Toxem and Galshio, and Mr. Landor\r\n     showed the Peshkar Kharak Singh, Pundit Gobaria, myself and many\r\n     Bhotiyas (Shokas) twenty-two wounds on his spine, feet and hands\r\n     received from the Tibetans. Chanden Sing, who had been\r\n     administered two hundred lashes, showed numerous black marks and\r\n     open sores where the skin had been torn on both legs. From Lamas\r\n     and soldiers who had been present at Mr. Landor\'s arrest and\r\n     tortures I heard the following account.\r\n\r\n     An ambush had been laid, and Mr. Landor and his bearer were\r\n     caught by treachery when some hundred and fifty yards away from\r\n     their tent, inside which were the rifles and revolver. They made\r\n     a desperate resistance and fought for over fifteen minutes,\r\n     struggling to get at their weapons. Thirty men were on Mr. Landor\r\n     and twelve or fifteen held Chanden Sing, while four hundred\r\n     soldiers armed with matchlocks and swords, and who had kept\r\n     hidden behind sandhills, quickly surrounded them. They were\r\n     tightly bound with ropes round the neck, chest, and legs, and the\r\n     arms were pinioned behind their backs. Chanden Sing received two\r\n     hundred lashes that same day. Mr. Landor and Mansing were taken\r\n     to Galshio three days later. Ponies were provided for them,\r\n     Mansing riding bare-back, while the wooden frame of a saddle was\r\n     provided for Mr. Landor, the frame having several iron spikes\r\n     sticking out of it in the back part of it. During the long ride\r\n     to Galshio these nails produced several wounds on Mr. Landor\'s\r\n     spine and back. Efforts were made, by means of a rope attached to\r\n     his handcuffs, to pull him off the saddle and have him trodden to\r\n     death by the hundreds of ponies of the Lamas, soldiers and\r\n     officers that came full gallop behind. Moreover, two shots were\r\n     fired at Mr. Landor. Mansing, unable to use his hands that were\r\n     bound, fell many times off his steed and remained some two miles\r\n     behind. When Galshio was reached Mr. Landor was pulled off his\r\n     saddle, and they told him that his head would be cut off\r\n     immediately. Dragged mercilessly by soldiers, he was taken to a\r\n     wooden log. Here they stretched his legs wide apart, and his feet\r\n     were made fast on the cutting edge of the log by means of tightly\r\n     bound ropes that cut into his flesh. Then while an officer held\r\n     him in a standing position by the hair of his head, a hot iron\r\n     was passed in front of his eyes and a matchlock laid on his\r\n     forehead and fired. Lastly, the head Lama approached with a long\r\n     sword and swung it right and left close to Mr. Landor\'s neck, as\r\n     if about to cut off the head. Mr. Landor remained composed and\r\n     spoke no words. After some twenty minutes Mansing arrived, and\r\n     was tied to the same log in front of Mr. Landor, and pretence was\r\n     made to behead Mansing, Mr. Landor\'s face having been covered\r\n     with a cloth. The Lamas professed to have been very astonished\r\n     when, after having tied the prisoners\' hands high up to poles\r\n     behind them, Mr. Landor asked for some _tzamba_ (oatmeal), meat\r\n     and rice, and Mansing for some butter.\r\n\r\n     The amazement of the Tibetans appears to have been even greater\r\n     when food was brought and Mr. Landor and Mansing partook heartily\r\n     of it and asked for more. Mr. Landor was kept chained to the log\r\n     for twenty-four hours, Mansing twelve hours. When they were\r\n     brought back to Toxem they found that Chanden Sing had been kept\r\n     four days tied hands and feet to an upright post, and he had been\r\n     given no food.\r\n\r\n     At Taklakot, an officer (called Nerba) confessed in my own tent,\r\n     and before Pundit Gobaria and the Political Peshkar Kharak Sing,\r\n     that he himself had held Mr. Landor by the hair when he was\r\n     about to be beheaded. He had also fired a shot at Mr. Landor,\r\n     and had moreover been ordered by the Lamas to cut off Mr.\r\n     Landor\'s toe and finger nails, as well as a lock of his hair. The\r\n     Taklakot Lamas and the Tokchim Tarjum professed to be sorry at\r\n     the Galshio Lamas having behaved in such a cruel manner.\r\n\r\n     At Taklakot we made a list of Mr. Landor\'s property that was\r\n     still missing, and we gave a copy to the Jong Pen and one to the\r\n     Tokchim Tarjum, that they may try to recover what they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n               (Signed)          HARKUA WILSON,\r\n                     _Methodist Episcopal Mission._\r\n\r\n    GUNGI BYAS BHOT, DARMA. _Sept._ 21, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR.

At the time they were\r\n     inflicted these wounds must have caused profuse bleeding.\r\n\r\n     The feet bear the marks of cruel treatment. On the right foot are\r\n     still well visible to-day (nineteen days after wounds were\r\n     inflicted) _six_ wounds,  viz.--\r\n\r\n    On the heel one wound one inch long;\r\n    Outside ankle     " half-inch long;\r\n    Front of ankle    " one inch long;\r\n    Top of foot, three inches above the toes,\r\n        one wound one and a-half inch long.\r\n    Two small wounds on the upper part of foot.\r\n\r\n     On the left foot the _four_ wounds are of a very severe\r\n     character, and were produced by ropes cutting into the flesh.\r\n\r\n    One nasty wound above heel, two and a-half inches long.\r\n    One wound below the ankle, one and one-fourth of an inch long.\r\n    One wound three inches above the toes, two inches long.\r\n    One wound on the heel, half an inch long.\r\n\r\n     These wounds have caused the feet to be much swollen, the left\r\n     foot especially having been considerably injured. Its strained\r\n     tendons give still intense pain when touched and the foot is very\r\n     heavy, inflamed and swollen.\r\n\r\n     On the left hand there are _five_ wounds.\r\n\r\n    On middle finger a wound one inch long and deep to the bone.\r\n    On root of middle finger, a wound half an inch long.\r\n    On small finger, a wound one-fourth of an inch long.\r\n    On third   "         "         "        "\r\n    On first   "         "   half an inch long.\r\n    The four fingers are still very swollen.\r\n\r\n     On the right hand there are only _two_ wounds.\r\n\r\n    The first, one half-inch long, on the upper side of the hand.\r\n    The second, a quarter of an inch long on the second finger.\r\n\r\n     Both hands are aching and much swollen, and the wounds upon them\r\n     were evidently produced by the heavy iron chain of the handcuffs.\r\n\r\n     On arrival at Taklakot (nineteen days after having been tortured)\r\n     Mr. Landor is still suffering from strong fever caused by his\r\n     wounds, and no doubt when they were fresh these must have given\r\n     Mr. Landor intense pain. His health and strong constitution seem\r\n     altogether shattered by the sufferings he has undergone.\r\n\r\n     His face, hands and feet are very swollen, and he appears\r\n     extremely weak; he himself attributed his great exhaustion to\r\n     having been unable to sleep for nineteen consecutive nights on\r\n     account of the bad sores on the spine and legs and because of the\r\n     heavy iron chains with which he was laden.\r\n\r\n                     H.

Chanden Sing has visible to this\r\n     day on both his legs, and twenty-one days after they were\r\n     inflicted, innumerable black marks produced by flogging. So\r\n     severely appears the punishment to have been administered, that\r\n     large patches of skin and flesh have been torn off by the\r\n     lashing. Chanden Sing is now in very poor health, and it is\r\n     evident by his appearance that he suffers greatly from the\r\n     tortures and ill-treatment received at the hands of the Tibetans.\r\n\r\n                     H.

La deambulazione non era libera ma incerta, la\r\n     funzionalita degli sfinteri molto difettosa per cui difficolta\r\n     della mizione e delle evacuazioni.\r\n\r\n     Presentava poi delle chiazze ecchimobili sopra-malleolari e\r\n     sopra-carpiche. L\'aspetto suo generale era di persona sofferente\r\n     e molto anemica. Fatte le cure che il caso del Sig^re Landor\r\n     reclamava, oggi 12 Febbraio notiamo; all\' occhio destro risoluta\r\n     la iperemia retinica, aumentato il campo visivo, occhio che serve\r\n     discretamente alla sua funzione; all\' occhio sinistro e molto\r\n     turbata la circolazione endoculare e quivi la funzione visiva non\r\n     e ristabilita; non vede gli oggetti e tutto gli fa confusione. La\r\n     colonna vertebrale presenta sempre dei punti dolenti in specie al\r\n     rigonfiamento sacro lombare. La deambulazione e piu corretta, ma\r\n     gli sarebbe impossibile fare una passeggiata lunga. La mizione e\r\n     megliorata, non cosi la defacazione che e sempre difettosa per\r\n     impotenza dello sfintere.\r\n\r\n     Le condizioni generali sono megliorate, ma occorre pero al Sig^re\r\n     Landor seguire la cura intrapresa, e specialmente la cura\r\n     elettrica ed idroterapica.\r\n\r\n             (Signed)                DOTT.

LANDOR,\r\n\r\n     I hope that you have received my letter of some time ago and that\r\n     you may be quite well now. Are you still at Almora? I have not\r\n     yet got back your things from the Jong Pen, but I hear it is\r\n     quite true that all your property reached Tokchim a long time\r\n     ago. I have sent another letter to the Jong Pen, but cannot get\r\n     an answer as the Lippu Pass is now closed owing to a heavy fall\r\n     of snow yesterday. It is rumoured that a Tibetan officer is\r\n     coming from Lhassa to Taklakot to inquire after your case, and\r\n     probably he may have reached Taklakot yesterday, and after\r\n     examining your things he will send them down to me. Now I have\r\n     nearly finished my work at this place. I have collected the dues\r\n     and paid them to the agents of the Jong Pen. I will go back to\r\n     Chaudas the day after to-morrow--_i.e._, on the 15th of this\r\n     month.\r\n\r\n     With kind regards and hoping to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n                            I remain,\r\n                                   Yours sincerely,\r\n                                              KHARAK SING PAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Letter from the_ POLITICAL PESHKAR, KHARAK SING PAL.\r\n\r\n                                  HALDWANI, _January_ 11, 1898.\r\nMY DEAR MR. LANDOR,\r\n\r\n     I hope that by this time you have reached safely home. I have\r\n     been very anxious as I have not heard from you or of your safe\r\n     arrival there. The dreadful day of the 8th of September is still\r\n     vivid in my mind, when I first saw you at Taklakot (in Tibet)\r\n     after you had been tortured by the Tibetans, and where I had come\r\n     in search of you.\r\n\r\n     I cannot forget your fearful appearance, with long hair and\r\n     beard, and your face, body and limbs covered with wounds and\r\n     bruises. When you arrived at Taklakot, in a few miserable rags\r\n     stained with blood, dirty and swarming with lice, and surrounded\r\n     by the guard of Tibetans, I could hardly believe it possible that\r\n     it was you who stood before me, so much you had changed since I\r\n     had last seen you.\r\n\r\n     I am still deeply pained when I think of the pitiable condition\r\n     you were in, when you showed me 22 (twenty-two) fresh wounds on\r\n     your hands, feet and spine, without counting the injuries to your\r\n     face. And indescribable pain gave us too seeing your confiscated\r\n     baggage under seal of the Tibetan authorities, and to find it,\r\n     when we opened it, to be full of broken or damaged instruments\r\n     and other articles of your property.\r\n\r\n     I think that you may remember my inquiry and consequent anger\r\n     when the Tibetan officers and soldiers admitted their guilt of\r\n     tying you by your limbs to the stretching log and of placing you\r\n     on a spiked saddle; of removing forcibly your toe-nails and\r\n     pulling you by the hair of your head. You know quite well that I\r\n     had no power to do more than to report the matter to higher\r\n     authorities, but I can assure you that it was to me quite\r\n     unbearable to hear from the Tibetans that they had brought you to\r\n     execution, and that they boasted of having swung the naked\r\n     executioner\'s sword right and left of your neck, and that they\r\n     had brought a red-hot iron close to your eyes to blind you.\r\n\r\n     Your servants\' condition, especially that of Chanden Sing, whom\r\n     like yourself the Tibetans kept prisoner for twenty-four days,\r\n     and who was given two hundred lashes, was pitiable beyond words.\r\n\r\n     I am anxious to see the photographs taken by Dr. Wilson of you as\r\n     you were when you arrived at Taklakot. I trust that by now you\r\n     may feel better and that the pain in your spine may have\r\n     altogether disappeared. I believe your rifles, revolver, ring,\r\n     &c., which I succeeded in recovering from the Tibetans, must have\r\n     reached you by now through the Deputy Commissioner at Almora. The\r\n     cash and other articles have not been recovered, nor is there any\r\n     probability of getting them back. Hoping to receive news of you\r\n     soon and with best salaams,\r\n\r\n    I am, yours most obediently,\r\n                        K. KHARAK SING PAL,\r\n                       _Political Peshkar,\r\n                    Garbyang Dharchula, Bhot._\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Letter from_ COLONEL GRIGG, _Commissioner of Kumaon._\r\n\r\n                       _Commissionership of Kumaon._\r\n                         _Dated December_ 7, 1897.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANDOR,\r\n\r\n     Karak Sing reports that 2 guns (1 damaged), 1 revolver, 1\r\n     signet-ring, cash 68/12/-, cartridges (gun) 110, ditto revolver\r\n     37, cleaning-rods 2, gun-case 1, leather straps, 1\r\n     butterfly-catcher, &c., have been handed to him by the Jong Pen\r\n     of Taklakot, and he has requested Deputy Commissioner\'s orders.\r\n\r\n     I am glad to hear your things are coming on. I hope you are\r\n     getting stronger.\r\n\r\n    With our kindest regards,\r\n                    Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                         E.E.

LARKIN, ESQ., WHO, DEPUTED BY THE GOVERNMENT,\r\nPROCEEDED TO THE FRONTIER TO MAKE AN INQUIRY INTO MY CASE.\r\n\r\n                            ALMORA, _August_ 10, 1898.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANDOR,\r\n\r\n     Yours of the 21st ult. I am glad to hear that your book on your\r\n     experiences in Tibet is nearly finished. I wish you may have\r\n     every success with it, as it is only what you deserve after your\r\n     trials and hardships in that difficult land of the\r\n     ultra-conservative Lamas. I am not aware that the Indian papers\r\n     are attacking you. However, they apparently do not get reliable\r\n     information if they dispute the fact of your having entered\r\n     Tibet. We who were in some way connected with your rescue and\r\n     return have not been "interviewed," or we would give the\r\n     authentic account of the affair.\r\n\r\n     I was on a few days\' leave at Naini Tal when I heard of your\r\n     capture, tortures and expulsion from Tibet. I was deputed by the\r\n     Government to proceed at once to the borders and make an inquiry\r\n     into the affair. I set off at once, and I met you at Askot, where\r\n     you were being looked after by the Rajbar. What a change in your\r\n     appearance! When I saw you standing among some of the Askot\r\n     natives I could with difficulty identify you. You were bronzed\r\n     and weather-beaten to such an extent that you were not\r\n     distinguishable from the natives. I do not think you can blame me\r\n     for not recognising you readily. Your forehead, nose and the part\r\n     of your face below your eyes were scarred, and helped to alter\r\n     your appearance very greatly. You did surprise me when you told\r\n     me that you would retrace your steps back to the borders on\r\n     learning from me that I was hastening on to inquire into your\r\n     case. I had then seen the twenty odd wounds you had on your face,\r\n     wrists, feet and back. I strongly protested against your\r\n     undertaking the fatiguing journey back across the perilous and\r\n     arduous road, as I knew you needed rest and good nourishment, and\r\n     thought it would be wisest for you to get back to Almora, and be\r\n     under a good doctor.\r\n\r\n     You, however, with your characteristic doggedness, meant to\r\n     accompany me, and I must perforce let you. I was glad in the long\r\n     run, for you enabled me to make a fuller inquiry than I would\r\n     otherwise have been able.\r\n\r\n     As you know, and as I reported to Government, I found after an\r\n     inquiry on the borders that you had with great difficulty and\r\n     manoeuvring succeeded in entering Tibet, evading the Jong Pen of\r\n     Taklakot, and the Barca Tarjum at Gyanema, and crossing the\r\n     Mariam La (Maium Pass) and getting as far as Tuksem (Toxem). You\r\n     had been deserted by all the mountaineers who had started with\r\n     you and who had promised to accompany you wherever you went. When\r\n     you were left with the two Kumaonis, you were surrounded and\r\n     captured by the _Governor of that part of Tibet_ and his men.\r\n     There, as a sequel to your innumerable fatigues, hardships,\r\n     desertions, and privations, you and your two followers were\r\n     ill-treated and tortured _by the Governor_. Have you not got a\r\n     copy of my official report? I remember you told me you were\r\n     applying for it. If you possess the copy, surely that will be\r\n     sufficient to confound your traducers. I saw from the public\r\n     papers that my report was to be laid on the table of the House of\r\n     Commons by the Secretary of State for India.\r\n\r\n     How did the photographs which we took up at the Lippu Pass turn\r\n     out? I should particularly like to have the one of the group on\r\n     the pass, and also the one where I am on horseback. I would also\r\n     like to have the one _I took of you having your matutinal bath\r\n     when the water froze in your hair and on your body_ as it was\r\n     thrown on you by Chanden Sing; and no wonder it did, as there\r\n     were ten to twelve feet of snow lying about, and a hardy Bhotia\r\n     (Shoka) mountaineer had only a few days prior to our arrival been\r\n     lost in the snow on crossing the pass.\r\n\r\n     Doubtless it will afford you some pleasure to learn that you have\r\n     earned quite a reputation among the natives, both Tibetan and\r\n     Bhotias (Shokas), on account of your universal cordiality,\r\n     generosity and pluck. They are constantly inquiring about you,\r\n     and relating your many good traits. Should you ever think of\r\n     returning here you have made many friends, and you would get a\r\n     very warm welcome from the natives.\r\n\r\n     Dr. H. Wilson tells me that, when he took you over from your\r\n     captors, _the officials of Tibet_, you were in a dying state, and\r\n     that he only just got you in the nick of time. How are your eyes\r\n     and spine? I trust they are quite well again. I look back with\r\n     pleasure to my tour up to the border with you, and our return\r\n     journey after your journey into Tibet proper, _where you were\r\n     subjected to tortures by the Governor of the district thereof_.\r\n\r\n       With every good wish,\r\n                 Yours very sincerely,\r\n                          (Signed)          J.

Containing "Hours of Idleness," "English Bards\r\nand Scotch Reviewers," and "Childe Harold." With a Portrait by HOLMES.\r\n[_In April._\r\n\r\n     "Mr. W.E. Henley is not only steeped to the lips in Byronic\r\n     poetry, but he has also a very familiar acquaintance with the\r\n     remarkable characters who formed \'the Byronic set,\' and he knows\r\n     the manners and customs of the Regency epoch to an extent that\r\n     gives him full mastery of his subject. There is originality in\r\n     the very form of this edition.\r\n\r\n     "He manages to give in a few vigorous sentences vivid sketches of\r\n     the wide circle of Byron\'s friends and enemies."--_Pall Mall\r\n     Gazette._\r\n\r\n     "The first volume is delightfully handy and the type excellent."\r\n     "These Byron Letters (Vol. I.) Mr. Henley has annotated as never\r\n     surely were letters annotated before. His notes provide simply a\r\n     complete series of little biographies--miniature biographies with\r\n     such vital selection, such concise completion without\r\n     dry-as-dustness--such interest as no other writer but Mr. Henley\r\n     could compass. It may fairly be said that he has discovered a new\r\n     art, the art of biographic cameos.... It is safe to say that\r\n     henceforth the typical edition of Byron can never be separated\r\n     from these notes. In conclusion, if Byron has waited long for a\r\n     heaven-sent editor, he has him at last."\r\n     "Mr. Henley, so far as elucidation and illustration are\r\n     concerned; is fully equipped."--_Athenaeum._\r\n\r\n_There will also be an Edition, limited to 150 sets for sale in Great\r\nBritain, printed on Van Gelder\'s hand-made paper, price Six Guineas net,\r\nsubscriptions for which are now being received._\r\n\r\n\r\nArt and Decoration.\r\n\r\nAN ALMANAC OF TWELVE SPORTS FOR 1898.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
