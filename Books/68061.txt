Indeed, towards the west, in striking\r\ncontrast with the pastoral sobriety of the central plain, the aspect\r\nof the country became, if not tropical, at any rate distinctly exotic.\r\nNor was this to be wondered at, perhaps; for beyond the Debatable\r\nHills (the boundary of Dorimare in the west) lay Fairyland. There\r\nhad, however, been no intercourse between the two countries for many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe social and commercial centre of Dorimare was its capital,\r\nLud-in-the-Mist, which was situated at the confluence of two rivers\r\nabout ten miles from the sea and fifty from the Elfin Hills.\r\n\r\nLud-in-the-Mist had all the things that make an old town pleasant. It\r\nhad an ancient Guild Hall, built of mellow golden bricks and covered\r\nwith ivy and, when the sun shone on it, it looked like a rotten\r\napricot; it had a harbour in which rode vessels with white and red and\r\ntawny sails; it had flat brick houses--not the mere carapace of human\r\nbeings, but ancient living creatures, renewing and modifying themselves\r\nwith each generation under their changeless antique roofs. It had old\r\narches, framing delicate landscapes that one could walk into, and a\r\npicturesque old graveyard on the top of a hill, and little open squares\r\nwhere comic baroque statues of dead citizens held levees attended by\r\nbirds and lovers and insects and children. It had, indeed, more than\r\nits share of pleasant things; for, as we have seen, it had two rivers.\r\n\r\nAlso, it was plentifully planted with trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the handsomest houses of Lud-in-the-Mist had belonged for\r\ngenerations to the family of Chanticleer. It was of red brick, and\r\nthe front, which looked on to a quiet lane leading into the High\r\nStreet, was covered with stucco, on which flowers and fruit and shells\r\nwere delicately modelled, while over the door was emblazoned a fine,\r\nstylized cock--the badge of the family. Behind, it had a spacious\r\ngarden, which stretched down to the river Dapple. Though it had no lack\r\nof flowers, they did not immediately meet the eye, but were imprisoned\r\nin a walled kitchen-garden, where they were planted in neat ribands,\r\nedging the plots of vegetables. Here, too, in spring was to be found\r\nthe pleasantest of all garden conjunctions--thick yew hedges and fruit\r\ntrees in blossom. Outside this kitchen-garden there was no need of\r\nflowers, for they had many substitutes. Let a thing be but a sort of\r\npunctual surprise, like the first cache of violets in March, let it be\r\ndelicate, painted and gratuitous, hinting that the Creator is solely\r\npreoccupied with aesthetic considerations, and combines disparate\r\nobjects simply because they look so well together, and that thing will\r\nadmirably fill the role of a flower.\r\n\r\nIn early summer it was the doves, with the bloom of plums on their\r\nbreasts, waddling on their coral legs over the wide expanse of lawn,\r\nto which their propinquity gave an almost startling greenness, that\r\nwere the flowers in the Chanticleers\' garden. And the trunks of birches\r\nare as good, any day, as white blossom, even if there had not been the\r\nacacias in flower. And there was a white peacock which, in spite of\r\nits restlessness and harsh shrieks, had something about it, too, of a\r\nflower. And the Dapple itself, stained like a palette, with great daubs\r\nof colour reflected from sky and earth, and carrying on its surface,\r\nin autumn, red and yellow leaves which may have fallen on it from the\r\ntrees of Fairyland, where it had its source--even the Dapple might be\r\nconsidered as a flower growing in the garden of the Chanticleers.\r\n\r\nThere was also a pleached alley of hornbeams. To the imaginative, it\r\nis always something of an adventure to walk down a pleached alley. You\r\nenter boldly enough, but soon you find yourself wishing you had stayed\r\noutside--it is not air that you are breathing, but silence, the almost\r\npalpable silence of trees. And is the only exit that small round hole\r\nin the distance? Why, you will never be able to squeeze through that!\r\nYou must turn back ... too late! The spacious portal by which you\r\nentered has in its turn shrunk to a small round hole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel Chanticleer, the actual head of the family, was a\r\ntypical Dorimarite in appearance; rotund, rubicund, red-haired, with\r\nhazel eyes in which the jokes, before he uttered them, twinkled like a\r\ntrout in a burn. Spiritually, too, he passed for a typical Dorimarite;\r\nthough, indeed, it is never safe to classify the souls of one\'s\r\nneighbors; one is apt, in the long run, to be proved a fool. You should\r\nregard each meeting with a friend as a sitting he is unwittingly giving\r\nyou for a portrait--a portrait that, probably, when you or he die,\r\nwill still be unfinished. And, though this is an absorbing pursuit,\r\nnevertheless, the painters are apt to end pessimists. For however\r\nhandsome and merry may be the face, however rich may be the background,\r\nin the first rough sketch of each portrait, yet with every added stroke\r\nof the brush, with every tiny readjustment of the "values," with every\r\nmodification of the chiaroscuro, the eyes looking out at you grow more\r\ndisquieting. And, finally, it is your own face that you are staring at\r\nin terror, as in a mirror by candle-light, when all the house is still.\r\n\r\nAll who knew Master Nathaniel would have been not only surprised, but\r\nincredulous, had they been told he was not a happy man. Yet such was\r\nthe case. His life was poisoned at its springs by a small, nameless\r\nfear; a fear not always active, for during considerable periods it\r\nwould lie almost dormant--almost, but never entirely.\r\n\r\nHe knew the exact date of its genesis. One evening, many years ago,\r\nwhen he was still but a lad, he and some friends decided as a frolic to\r\ndress up as the ghosts of their ancestors and frighten the servants.\r\nThere was no lack of properties; for the attics of the Chanticleers\r\nwere filled with the lumber of the past: grotesque wooden masks, old\r\nweapons and musical instruments, and old costumes--tragic, hierophantic\r\nrobes that looked little suited to the uses of daily life. There were\r\nwhole chests, too, filled with pieces of silk, embroidered or painted\r\nwith curious scenes. Who has not wondered in what mysterious forests\r\nour ancestors discovered the models for the beasts and birds upon\r\ntheir tapestries; and on what planet were enacted the scenes they have\r\nportrayed? It is in vain that the dead fingers have stitched beneath\r\nthem--and we can picture the mocking smile with which these crafty\r\ncozeners of posterity accompanied the action--the words "February,"\r\nor "Hawking," or "Harvest," having us believe that they are but\r\nillustrations of the activities proper to the different months. We know\r\nbetter. These are not the normal activities of mortal men. What kind of\r\nbeings peopled the earth four or five centuries ago, what strange lore\r\nthey had acquired, and what were their sinister doings, we shall never\r\nknow. Our ancestors keep their secret well.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chanticleers\' lumber there was also no lack of those\r\ndelicate, sophisticated toys--fans, porcelain cups, engraved\r\nseals--that, when the civilisation that played with them is dead,\r\nbecome pathetic and appealing, just as tunes once gay inevitably\r\nbecome plaintive when the generation that first sang them has turned\r\nto dust. But those particular toys, one felt, could never have been\r\nreally frivolous--there was a curious gravity about their colouring and\r\nlines. Besides, the moral of the ephemeral things with which they were\r\ndecorated was often pointed in an aphorism or riddle. For instance,\r\non a fan painted with wind-flowers and violets were illuminated these\r\nwords: "Why is Melancholy like Honey? Because it is very sweet, and it\r\nis culled from Flowers."\r\n\r\nThese trifles clearly belonged to a later period than the masks and\r\ncostumes. Nevertheless, they, too, seemed very remote from the daily\r\nlife of the modern Dorimarites.\r\n\r\nWell, when they had whitened their faces with flour and decked\r\nthemselves out to look as fantastic as possible, Master Nathaniel\r\nseized one of the old instruments, a sort of lute ending in the carving\r\nof a cock\'s head, its strings rotted by damp and antiquity, and,\r\ncrying out, "Let\'s see if this old fellow has a croak left in him!"\r\nplucked roughly at its strings. They gave out one note, so plangent,\r\nblood-freezing and alluring, that for a few seconds the company stood\r\nas if petrified.\r\n\r\nThen one of the girls saved the situation with a humourous squawk, and,\r\nputting her hands to her ears, cried, "Thank you, Nat, for your cat\'s\r\nconcert! It was worse than a squeaking slate." And one of the young\r\nmen cried laughingly, "It must be the ghost of one of your ancestors,\r\nwho wants to be let out and given a glass of his own claret." And the\r\nincident faded from their memories--but not from the memory of Master\r\nNathaniel.\r\n\r\nHe was never again the same man. For years that note was the apex of\r\nhis nightly dreams; the point towards which, by their circuitous and\r\nseemingly senseless windings, they had all the time been converging.\r\nIt was as if the note were a living substance, and subject to the law\r\nof chemical changes--that is to say, as that law works in dreams. For\r\ninstance, he might dream that his old nurse was baking an apple on the\r\nfire in her own cosy room, and as he watched it simmer and sizzle she\r\nwould look at him with a strange smile, a smile such as he had never\r\nseen on her face in his waking hours, and say, "But, of course, you\r\nknow it isn\'t really the apple. It\'s the Note."\r\n\r\nThe influence that this experience had had upon his attitude to daily\r\nlife was a curious one. Before he had heard the note he had caused his\r\nfather some uneasiness by his impatience of routine and his hankering\r\nafter travel and adventure. He had, indeed, been heard to vow that\r\nhe would rather be the captain of one of his father\'s ships than the\r\nsedentary owner of the whole fleet.\r\n\r\nBut after he had heard the Note a more stay-at-home and steady young\r\nman could not have been found in Lud-in-the-Mist. For it had generated\r\nin him what one can only call a wistful yearning after the prosaic\r\nthings he already possessed. It was as if he thought he had already\r\nlost what he was actually holding in his hands.\r\n\r\nFrom this there sprang an ever-present sense of insecurity together\r\nwith a distrust of the homely things he cherished. With what familiar\r\nobject--quill, pipe, pack of cards--would he be occupied, in which\r\nregular recurrent action--the pulling on or off of his nightcap, the\r\nweekly auditing of his accounts--would he be engaged when IT, the\r\nhidden menace, sprang out at him? And he would gaze in terror at his\r\nfurniture, his walls, his pictures--what strange scene might they\r\none day witness, what awful experience might he one day have in their\r\npresence?\r\n\r\nHence, at times, he would gaze on the present with the agonizing\r\ntenderness of one who gazes on the past: his wife, sitting under the\r\nlamp embroidering, and retailing to him the gossip she had culled\r\nduring the day; or his little son, playing with the great mastiff on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nThis nostalgia for what was still there seemed to find a voice in the\r\ncry of the cock, which tells of the plough going through the land,\r\nthe smell of the country, the placid bustle of the farm, as happening\r\nnow, all round one; and which, simultaneously, mourns them as things\r\nvanished centuries ago.\r\n\r\nFrom his secret poison there was, however, some sweetness to be\r\ndistilled. For the unknown thing that he dreaded could at times be\r\nenvisaged as a dangerous cape that he had already doubled. And to lie\r\nawake at night in his warm feather bed, listening to the breathing\r\nof his wife and the soughing of the trees, would become, from this\r\nattitude, an exquisite pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe would say to himself, "How pleasant this is! How safe! How warm!\r\nWhat a difference from that lonely heath when I had no cloak and the\r\nwind found the fissures in my doublet, and my feet were aching, and\r\nthere was not moon enough to prevent my stumbling, and IT was lurking\r\nin the darkness!" enhancing thus his present well-being by imagining\r\nsome unpleasant adventure now safe behind him.\r\n\r\nThis also was the cause of his taking a pride in knowing his way about\r\nhis native town. For instance, when returning from the Guildhall to his\r\nown house he would say to himself, "Straight across the market-place,\r\ndown Appleimp Lane, and round by the Duke Aubrey Arms into the High\r\nStreet.... I know every step of the way, every step of the way!"\r\n\r\nAnd he would get a sense of security, a thrill of pride, from every\r\nacquaintance who passed the time of day with him, from every dog to\r\nwhom he could put a name. "That\'s Wagtail, Goceline Flack\'s dog. That\'s\r\nMab, the bitch of Rackabite the butcher, I know them!"\r\n\r\nThough he did not realise it, he was masquerading to himself as a\r\nstranger in Lud-in-the-Mist--a stranger whom nobody knew, and who was\r\nthus almost as safe as if he were invisible. And one always takes a\r\npride in knowing one\'s way about a strange town. But it was only this\r\npride that emerged completely into his consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe only outward expression of this secret fear was a sudden,\r\nunaccountable irascibility, when some harmless word or remark happened\r\nto sting the fear into activity. He could not stand people saying, "Who\r\nknows what we shall be doing this time next year?" and he loathed such\r\nexpressions as "for the last time," "never again," however trivial the\r\ncontext in which they appeared. For instance, he would snap his wife\'s\r\nhead off--why, she could not think--if she said, "Never again shall I\r\ngo to that butcher," or "That starch is a disgrace. It\'s the last time\r\nI shall use it for my ruffs."\r\n\r\nThis fear, too, had awakened in him a wistful craving for other men\'s\r\nshoes that caused him to take a passionate interest in the lives of\r\nhis neighbors; that is to say if these lives moved in a different\r\nsphere from his own. From this he had gained the reputation--not\r\nquite deserved--of being a very warm-hearted, sympathetic man, and he\r\nhad won the heart of many a sea-captain, of many a farmer, of many\r\nan old working-woman by the unfeigned interest he showed in their\r\nconversation. Their long, meandering tales of humble normal lives were\r\nlike the proverbial glimpse of a snug, lamp-lit parlour to a traveller\r\nbelated after nightfall.\r\n\r\nHe even coveted dead men\'s shoes, and he would loiter by the hour\r\nin the ancient burying-ground of Lud-in-the-Mist, known from time\r\nimmemorial as the Fields of Grammary. He could justify this habit by\r\npointing out the charming view that one got thence of both Lud and\r\nthe surrounding country. But though he sincerely loved the view, what\r\nreally brought him there were such epitaphs as this:\r\n\r\n                                 BAKER\r\n\r\n                   WHO HAVING PROVIDED THE CITIZENS\r\n                  OF LUD-IN-THE-MIST FOR SIXTY YEARS\r\n                        WITH FRESH SWEET LOAVES\r\n                    DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY-EIGHT\r\n                 SURROUNDED BY HIS SONS AND GRANDSONS.\r\n\r\nHow willingly would he have changed places with that old baker! And\r\nthen the disquieting thought would come to him that perhaps after all\r\nepitaphs are not altogether to be trusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n               THE DUKE WHO LAUGHED HIMSELF OFF A THRONE\r\n                   AND OTHER TRADITIONS OF DORIMARE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we start on our story, it will be necessary, for its proper\r\nunderstanding, to give a short sketch of the history of Dorimare and\r\nthe beliefs and customs of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nLud-in-the-Mist was scattered about the banks of two rivers, the Dapple\r\nand the Dawl, which met on its outskirts at an acute angle, the apex\r\nof which was the harbour. Then there were more houses up the side of a\r\nhill, on the top of which stood the Fields of Grammary.\r\n\r\nThe Dawl was the biggest river of Dorimare, and it became so broad at\r\nLud-in-the-Mist as to give that town, twenty miles inland though it\r\nwas, all the advantages of a port; while the actual seaport town itself\r\nwas little more than a fishing village. The Dapple, however, which had\r\nits source in Fairyland (from a salt inland sea, the geographers held)\r\nand flowed subterraneously under the Debatable Hills, was a humble\r\nlittle stream, and played no part in the commercial life of the town.\r\nBut an old maxim of Dorimare bade one never forget that \'The Dapple\r\nflows into the Dawl.\' It had come to be employed when one wanted to\r\nshow the inadvisability of despising the services of humble agents;\r\nbut, possibly, it had originally another application.\r\n\r\nThe wealth and importance of the country was mainly due to the Dawl. It\r\nwas thanks to the Dawl that girls in remote villages of Dorimare wore\r\nbrooches made out of walrus tusks, and applied bits of unicorns\' horns\r\nto their toothache, that the chimney-piece in the parlour of almost\r\nevery farm-house was adorned with an ostrich egg, and that when the\r\nladies of Lud-in-the-Mist went out shopping or to play cards with their\r\nfriends, their market-basket or ivory markers were carried by little\r\nindigo pages in crimson turbans from the Cinnamon Isles, and that pigmy\r\npeddlers from the far North hawked amber through the streets. For the\r\nDawl had turned Lud-in-the-Mist into a town of merchants, and all the\r\npower and nearly all the wealth of the country was in their hands.\r\n\r\nBut this had not always been the case. In the old days Dorimare had\r\nbeen a duchy, and the population had consisted of nobles and peasants.\r\nBut gradually there had arisen a middle-class. And this class had\r\ndiscovered--as it always does--that trade was seriously hampered by a\r\nruler unchecked by a constitution, and by a ruthless, privileged class.\r\nFiguratively, these things were damming the Dawl.\r\n\r\nIndeed, with each generation the Dukes had been growing more capricious\r\nand more selfish, till finally these failings had culminated in Duke\r\nAubrey, a hunchback with a face of angelic beauty, who seemed to be\r\npossessed by a laughing demon of destructiveness. He had been known,\r\nout of sheer wantonness, to gallop with his hunt straight through a\r\nfield of standing corn, and to set fire to a fine ship for the mere\r\npleasure of watching it burn. And he dealt with the virtue of his\r\nsubjects\' wives and daughters in the same high-handed way.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, his pranks were seasoned by a slightly sinister humour. For\r\ninstance, when on the eve of marriage a maid, according to immemorial\r\ncustom, was ritually offering her virginity to the spirit of the farm,\r\nsymbolised by the most ancient tree on the freehold, Duke Aubrey would\r\nleap out from behind it, and, pretending to be the spirit, take her at\r\nher word. And tradition said that he and one of his boon companions\r\nwagered that they would succeed in making the court jester commit\r\nsuicide of his own free will. So they began to work on his imagination\r\nwith plaintive songs, the burden of which was the frailty of all lovely\r\nthings, and with grim fables comparing man to a shepherd, doomed to\r\nstand by impotent, while his sheep are torn, one by one, by a ravenous\r\nwolf.\r\n\r\nThey won their wager; for coming into the jester\'s room one morning\r\nthey found him hanging from the ceiling, dead. And it was believed that\r\nechoes of the laughter with which Duke Aubrey greeted this spectacle\r\nwere, from time to time, still to be heard proceeding from that room.\r\n\r\nBut there had been pleasanter aspects to him. For one thing, he had\r\nbeen an exquisite poet, and such of his songs as had come down were\r\nas fresh as flowers and as lonely as the cuckoo\'s cry. While in the\r\ncountry stories were still told of his geniality and tenderness--how he\r\nwould appear at a village wedding with a cart-load of wine and cakes\r\nand fruit, or of how he would stand at the bedside of the dying, grave\r\nand compassionate as a priest.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the grim merchants, obsessed by a will to wealth, raised\r\nup the people against him. For three days a bloody battle raged in the\r\nstreets of Lud-in-the-Mist, in which fell all the nobles of Dorimare.\r\nAs for Duke Aubrey, he vanished--some said to Fairyland, where he\r\nwas living to this day. During those three days of bloodshed all the\r\npriests had vanished also. So Dorimare lost simultaneously its Duke and\r\nits cult.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Dukes, fairy things had been looked on with\r\nreverence, and the most solemn event of the religious year had been\r\nthe annual arrival from Fairyland of mysterious, hooded strangers with\r\nmilk-white mares, laden with offerings of fairy fruit for the Duke and\r\nthe high-priest.\r\n\r\nBut after the revolution, when the merchants had seized all the\r\nlegislative and administrative power, a taboo was placed on all things\r\nfairy.\r\n\r\nThis was not to be wondered at. For one thing, the new rulers\r\nconsidered that the eating of fairy fruit had been the chief cause of\r\nthe degeneracy of the Dukes. It had, indeed, always been connected with\r\npoetry and visions, which, springing as they do from an ever-present\r\nsense of mortality, might easily appear morbid to the sturdy common\r\nsense of a burgher-class in the making. There was certainly nothing\r\nmorbid about the men of the revolution, and under their regime what one\r\ncan only call the tragic sense of life vanished from poetry and art.\r\n\r\nBesides, to the minds of the Dorimarites, fairy things had always\r\nspelled delusion. The songs and legends described Fairyland as a\r\ncountry where the villages appeared to be made of gold and cinnamon\r\nwood, and where priests, who lived on opobalsum and frankincense,\r\nhourly offered holocausts of peacocks and golden bulls to the sun and\r\nthe moon. But if an honest, clear-eyed mortal gazed on these things\r\nlong enough, the glittering castles would turn into old, gnarled trees,\r\nthe lamps into glow-worms, the precious stones into potsherds, and the\r\nmagnificently-robed priests and their gorgeous sacrifices into aged\r\ncrones muttering over a fire of twigs.\r\n\r\nThe fairies themselves, tradition taught, were eternally jealous of the\r\nsolid blessings of mortals, and, clothed in invisibility, would crowd\r\nto weddings and wakes and fairs--wherever good victuals, in fact, were\r\nto be found--and suck the juices from fruits and meats--in vain, for\r\nnothing could make them substantial.\r\n\r\nNor was it only food that they stole. In out-of-the-way country places\r\nit was still believed that corpses were but fairy cheats, made to\r\nresemble flesh and bone, but without any real substance--otherwise, why\r\nshould they turn so quickly to dust? But the real person, for which\r\nthe corpse was but a flimsy substitute, had been carried away by the\r\nFairies, to tend their blue kine and reap their fields of gillyflowers.\r\nThe country people, indeed, did not always clearly distinguish between\r\nthe Fairies and the dead. They called them both the "Silent People";\r\nand the Milky Way they thought was the path along which the dead were\r\ncarried to Fairyland.\r\n\r\nAnother tradition said that their only means of communication was\r\npoetry and music; and in the country poetry and music were still called\r\n"the language of the Silent People."\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, men who were teaching the Dawl to run gold, who were\r\ndigging canals and building bridges, and seeing that the tradesmen gave\r\ngood measure and used standard weights, and who liked both virtues\r\nand commodities to be solid, had little patience for flimsy cheats.\r\nNevertheless, the new rulers were creating their own form of delusion,\r\nfor it was they who founded in Dorimare the science of jurisprudence,\r\ntaking as their basis the primitive code used under the Dukes and\r\nadapting it to modern conditions by the use of legal fictions.\r\n\r\nMaster Josiah Chanticleer (the father of Master Nathaniel), who had\r\nbeen a very ingenious and learned jurist, had drawn in one of his\r\ntreatises a curious parallel between fairy things and the law. The men\r\nof the revolution, he said, had substituted law for fairy fruit. But\r\nwhereas only the reigning Duke and his priests had been allowed to\r\npartake of the fruit, the law was given freely to rich and poor alike.\r\nAgain, fairy was delusion, so was the law. At any rate, it was a sort\r\nof magic, moulding reality into any shape it chose. But, whereas fairy\r\nmagic and delusion were for the cozening and robbing of man, the magic\r\nof the law was to his intention and for his welfare.\r\n\r\nIn the eye of the law, neither Fairyland nor fairy things existed. But\r\nthen, as Master Josiah had pointed out, the law plays fast and loose\r\nwith reality--and no one really believes it.\r\n\r\nGradually, an almost physical horror came to be felt for anything\r\nconnected with the Fairies and Fairyland, and society followed the law\r\nin completely ignoring their existence. Indeed, the very word "fairy"\r\nbecame taboo, and was never heard on polite lips, while the greatest\r\ninsult one Dorimarite could hurl at another was to call him "Son of a\r\nFairy."\r\n\r\nBut, on the painted ceilings of ancient houses, in the peeling frescoes\r\nof old barns, in the fragments of bas-reliefs built into modern\r\nstructures, and, above all, in the tragic funereal statues of the\r\nFields of Grammary, a Winckelmann, had he visited Dorimare, would have\r\nfound, as he did in the rococo Rome of the eighteenth century, traces\r\nof an old and solemn art, the designs of which served as poncifs to the\r\nmodern artists. For instance, a well-known advertisement of a certain\r\ncheese, which depicted a comic, fat little man menacing with knife and\r\nfork an enormous cheese hanging in the sky like the moon, was really\r\na sort of unconscious comic reprisal made against the action depicted\r\nin a very ancient Dorimarite design, wherein the moon itself pursued a\r\nfrieze of tragic fugitives.\r\n\r\nWell, a few years before the opening of this story, a Winckelmann,\r\nthough an anonymous one, actually did appear in Lud-in-the-Mist;\r\nalthough the field of his enquiries was not limited to the plastic\r\narts. He published a book, entitled _Traces of Fairy in the\r\nInhabitants, Customs, Art, Vegetation and Language of Dorimare_.\r\n\r\nHis thesis was this: that there was an unmistakable fairy strain\r\nrunning through the race of Dorimarites, which could only be explained\r\nby the hypothesis that, in the olden days, there had been frequent\r\nintermarriage between them and the Fairies. For instance, the red hair,\r\nso frequent in Dorimare, pointed, he maintained, to such a strain.\r\nIt was also to be found, he asserted, in the cattle of Dorimare. For\r\nthis assertion he had some foundation, for it was undeniable that\r\nfrom time to time a dun or dapple cow would bring forth a calf of a\r\nbluish tinge, whose dung was of a ruddy gold. And tradition taught\r\nthat all the cattle of Fairyland were blue, and that fairy gold turned\r\ninto dung when it had crossed the border. Tradition also taught that\r\nall the flowers of Fairyland were red, and it was indisputable that\r\nthe cornflowers of Dorimare sprang up from time to time as red as\r\npoppies, and the lilies as red as damask roses. Moreover, he discovered\r\ntraces of the Fairies\' language in the oaths of the Dorimarites and\r\nin some of their names. And, to a stranger, it certainly produced an\r\nodd impression to hear such high-flown oaths as; by the Sun, Moon and\r\nStars; by the Golden Apples of the West; by the Harvest of Souls; by\r\nthe White Ladies of the Fields; by the Milky Way, come tumbling out in\r\nthe same breath with such homely expletives as Busty Bridget; Toasted\r\nCheese; Suffering Cats; by my Great-Aunt\'s Rump; or to find names like\r\nDreamsweet, Ambrose, Moonlove, wedded to such grotesque surnames as\r\nBaldbreech, Fliperarde, or Pyepowders.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the designs of old tapestries and old bas-reliefs,\r\nhe maintained that they were illustrations of the flora, fauna, and\r\nhistory of Fairyland, and scouted the orthodox theory which explained\r\nthe strange birds and flowers as being due either to the artists\'\r\nunbridled fancy or to their imperfect control of their medium, and\r\nconsidered that the fantastic scenes were taken from the rituals of the\r\nold religion. For, he insisted, all artistic types, all ritual acts,\r\nmust be modelled on realities; and Fairyland is the place where what we\r\nlook upon as symbols and figures actually exist and occur.\r\n\r\nIf the antiquary, then, was correct, the Dorimarite, like a Dutchman of\r\nthe seventeenth century, smoking his churchwarden among his tulips, and\r\neating his dinner off Delft plates, had trivialised to his own taste\r\nthe solemn spiritual art of a remote, forbidden land, which he believed\r\nto be inhabited by grotesque and evil creatures given over to strange\r\nvices and to dark cults ... nevertheless in the veins of the Dutchman\r\nof Dorimare there flowed without his knowing it the blood of these same\r\nevil creatures.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the fury caused in Lud-in-the-Mist by the\r\nappearance of this book. The printer was, of course, heavily fined, but\r\nhe was unable to throw any light on its authorship. The manuscript, he\r\nsaid, had been brought to him by a rough, red-haired lad, whom he had\r\nnever seen before. All the copies were burned by the common hangman,\r\nand there the matter had to rest.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the law\'s maintaining that Fairyland and everything to do\r\nwith it was non-existent, it was an open secret that, though fairy\r\nfruit was no longer brought into the country with all the pomp of\r\nestablished ritual, anyone who wanted it could always procure it in\r\nLud-in-the-Mist. No great effort had ever been made to discover the\r\nmeans and agents by which it was smuggled into the town; for to eat\r\nfairy fruit was regarded as a loathsome and filthy vice, practised in\r\nlow taverns by disreputable and insignificant people, such as indigo\r\nsailors and pigmy Norsemen. True, there had been cases known from time\r\nto time, during the couple of centuries that had elapsed since the\r\nexpulsion of Duke Aubrey, of youths of good family taking to this vice.\r\nBut to be suspected of such a thing spelled complete social ostracism,\r\nand this, combined with the innate horror felt for the stuff by every\r\nDorimarite, caused such cases to be very rare.\r\n\r\nBut some twenty years before the opening of this story, Dorimare had\r\nbeen inflicted with a terrible drought. People were reduced to making\r\nbread out of vetches and beans and fern-roots; and marsh and tarn were\r\nrifled of their reeds to provide the cattle with food, while the Dawl\r\nwas diminished to the size of an ordinary rill, as were the other\r\nrivers of Dorimare--with the exception of the Dapple. All through\r\nthe drought the waters of the Dapple remained unimpaired; but this\r\nwas not to be wondered at, as a river whose sources are in Fairyland\r\nhas probably mysterious sources of moisture. But, as the drought\r\nburned relentlessly on, in the country districts an ever-increasing\r\nnumber of people succumbed to the vice of fairy fruit-eating ... with\r\ntragic results to themselves, for though the fruit was very grateful\r\nto their parched throats, its spiritual effects were most alarming,\r\nand every day fresh rumours reached Lud-in-the-Mist (it was in the\r\ncountry districts that this epidemic, for so we must call it, raged) of\r\nmadness, suicide, orgiastic dances, and wild doings under the moon. But\r\nthe more they ate the more they wanted, and though they admitted that\r\nthe fruit produced an agony of mind, they maintained that for one who\r\nhad experienced this agony life would cease to be life without it.\r\n\r\nHow the fruit got across the border remained a mystery, and all the\r\nefforts of the magistrates to stop it were useless. In vain they\r\ninvented a legal fiction (as we have seen, the law took no cognisance\r\nof fairy things) that turned fairy fruit into a form of woven silk\r\nand, hence, contraband in Dorimare; in vain they fulminated in the\r\nSenate against all smugglers and all men of depraved minds and filthy\r\nhabits--silently, surely, the supply of fairy fruit continued to meet\r\nthe demand. Then, with the first rain, both began to decrease. But\r\nthe inefficiency of the magistrates in this national crisis was never\r\nforgotten, and "feckless as a magistrate in the great drought" became a\r\nproverb in Dorimare.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the ruling class of Dorimare had become\r\nincapable of handling any serious business. The wealthy merchants of\r\nLud-in-the-Mist, the descendants of the men of the revolution and the\r\nhereditary rulers of Dorimare had, by this time, turned into a set of\r\nindolent, self-indulgent, humorous gentlemen, with hearts as little\r\ntouched to tragic issues as those of their forefathers, but with none\r\nof their forefathers\' sterling qualities.\r\n\r\nA class struggling to assert itself, to discover its true shape, which\r\nlies hidden, as does the statue in the marble, in the hard, resisting\r\nmaterial of life itself, must, in the nature of things, be different\r\nfrom that same class when chisel and mallet have been laid aside, and\r\nit has actually become what it had so long been struggling to be. For\r\none thing, wealth had ceased to be a delicate, exotic blossom. It had\r\nbecome naturalised in Dorimare, and was now a hardy perennial, docilely\r\nrenewing itself year after year, and needing no tending from the\r\ngardeners.\r\n\r\nHence sprang leisure, that fissure in the solid masonry of works\r\nand days in which take seed a myriad curious little flowers--good\r\ncookery, and shining mahogany, and a fashion in dress, that, like a\r\nbaroque bust, is fantastic through sheer wittiness, and porcelain\r\nshepherdesses, and the humours, and endless jokes--in fact, the toys,\r\nmaterial and spiritual, of civilisation. But they were as different as\r\npossible from the toys of that older civilisation that littered the\r\nattics of the Chanticleers. About these there had been something tragic\r\nand a little sinister; while all the manifestations of the modern\r\ncivilisation were like fire-light--fantastic, but homely.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the men in whose hands lay the welfare of the country.\r\nAnd, it must be confessed, they knew but little and cared still less\r\nabout the common people for whom they legislated.\r\n\r\nFor instance, they were unaware that in the country Duke Aubrey\'s\r\nmemory was still green. It was not only that natural children still\r\nwent by the name of "Duke Aubrey\'s brats"; that when they saw a falling\r\nstar old women would say, "Duke Aubrey has shot a roe"; and that on\r\nthe anniversary of his expulsion, maidens would fling into the Dapple,\r\nfor luck, garlands woven out of the two plants that had formed the\r\nbadge of the Dukes--ivy and squills. He was a living reality to the\r\ncountry people; so much so that, when leakages were found in the vats,\r\nor when a horse was discovered in the morning with his coat stained\r\nand furrowed with sweat, some rogue of a farm-hand could often escape\r\npunishment by swearing that Duke Aubrey had been the culprit. And there\r\nwas not a farm or village that had not at least one inhabitant who\r\nswore that he had seen him, on some midsummer\'s eve, or some night of\r\nthe winter solstice, galloping past at the head of his fairy hunt, with\r\nharlequin ribbands streaming in the wind, to the sound of innumerable\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nBut of Fairyland and its inhabitants the country people knew no more\r\nthan did the merchants of Lud-in-the-Mist. Between the two countries\r\nstood the barrier of the Debatable Hills, the foothills of which were\r\ncalled the Elfin Marches, and were fraught, tradition said, with every\r\nkind of danger, both physical and moral. No one in the memory of man\r\nhad crossed these hills, and to do so was considered tantamount to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social life of Lud-in-the-Mist began in spring and ended in autumn.\r\nIn winter the citizens preferred their own fire-sides; they had an\r\nunreasoning dislike of being out after nightfall, a dislike due not so\r\nmuch to fear as to habit. Though the habit may have sprung from some\r\nforgotten danger that, long ago, had made their ancestors shun the dark.\r\n\r\nSo it was always with relief as well as with joy that they welcomed the\r\nfirst appearance of spring--scarcely crediting at first that it was a\r\nreality shared by all the world, and not merely an optical delusion\r\nconfined to their own eyes in their own garden. There, the lawn was\r\ncertainly green, the larches and thorns even startlingly so, and the\r\nalmonds had rose-coloured blossoms; but the fields and trees in the\r\nhazy distance beyond their own walls were still grey and black. Yes,\r\nthe colours in their own garden must be due merely to some gracious\r\naccident of light, and when that light shifted the colours would vanish.\r\n\r\nBut everywhere, steadily, invisibly, the trees\' winter foliage of white\r\nsky or amethyst grey dusk was turning to green and gold.\r\n\r\nAll the world over we are very conscious of the trees in spring,\r\nand watch with delight how the network of twigs on the wych-elms is\r\nbecoming spangled with tiny puce flowers, like little beetles caught\r\nin a spider\'s web, and how little lemon-coloured buds are studding the\r\nthorn. While as to the long red-gold buds of the horse-chestnuts--they\r\ncome bursting out with a sort of a visual bang. And now the beech is\r\nhatching its tiny perfectly-formed leaves--and all the other trees in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nAnd at first we delight in the diversity of the colours and shapes of\r\nthe various young leaves--noting how those of the birch are like a\r\nswarm of green bees, and those of the lime so transparent that they are\r\nstained black with the shadow of those above and beneath them, and how\r\nthose of the elm diaper the sky with the prettiest pattern, and are the\r\nones that grow the most slowly.\r\n\r\nThen we cease to note their idiosyncrasies, and they merge, till\r\nautumn, into one solid, unobtrusive green curtain for throwing into\r\nrelief brighter and sharper things. There is nothing so dumb as a tree\r\nin full leaf.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of his fiftieth year that Master Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer had his first real anxiety. It concerned his only son\r\nRanulph, a little boy of twelve years old.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel had been elected that year to the highest office in\r\nthe state--that of Mayor of Lud-in-the-Mist and High Seneschal of\r\nDorimare. Ex officio, he was president of the Senate and chief justice\r\non the Bench. According to the constitution, as drawn up by the men of\r\nthe revolution, he was responsible for the safety and defence of the\r\ncountry in case of attack by sea or land; it was for him to see that\r\nboth justice and the country\'s revenues were properly administered; and\r\nhis time was held to be at the disposal of the most obscure citizen\r\nwith a grievance.\r\n\r\nActually--apart from presiding on the Bench--his duties had come to\r\nconsist of nothing more onerous than being a genial and dignified\r\nchairman of a comfortable and select club, for that was what in reality\r\nthe Senate had now become. Nevertheless, though it was open to question\r\nwhether his official duties were of the slightest use to anyone, they\r\nwere numerous enough to occupy most of his time and to cause him to be\r\nunconscious of the under-currents in his home.\r\n\r\nRanulph had always been a dreamy, rather delicate child, and backward\r\nfor his years. Up to the age of seven, or thereabouts, he had caused\r\nhis mother much anxiety by his habit, when playing in the garden, of\r\nshouting out remarks to an imaginary companion. And he was fond of\r\ntalking nonsense (according to the ideas of Lud-in-the-Mist, slightly\r\nobscene nonsense) about golden cups, and snow-white ladies milking\r\nazure cows, and the sound of tinkling bridles at midnight. But children\r\nare apt, all the world over, to have nasty little minds; and this type\r\nof talk was not uncommon among the children of Lud-in-the-Mist, and, as\r\nthey nearly always grew out of it, little attention was paid to it.\r\n\r\nThen, when he was a few years older, the sudden death of a young\r\nscullery maid affected him so strongly that for two days he would not\r\ntouch food, but lay with frightened eyes tossing and trembling in bed,\r\nlike a newly-caught bird in a cage. When his shocked and alarmed mother\r\n(his father was at the seaport town on business at the time) tried to\r\ncomfort him by reminding him that he had not been particularly fond of\r\nthe scullery-maid while she was alive, he had cried out irritably, "No,\r\nno, it isn\'t her ... it\'s the thing that has happened to her!"\r\n\r\nBut all that was when he was still quite a little boy, and, as he grew\r\nolder, he had seemed to become much more normal.\r\n\r\nBut that spring his tutor had come to Dame Marigold to complain of\r\nhis inattention at his studies, and sudden unreasonable outbreaks of\r\npassion. "To tell the you truth, ma\'am, I think the little fellow can\'t\r\nbe well," the tutor had said.\r\n\r\nSo Dame Marigold sent for the good old family doctor, who said there\r\nwas nothing the matter with him but a little overheating of the blood,\r\na thing very common in the spring; and prescribed sprigs of borage in\r\nwine: "the best cordial for lazy scholars," and he winked and pinched\r\nRanulph\'s ear, adding that in June he might be given an infusion of\r\ndamask roses to complete the cure.\r\n\r\nBut the sprigs of borage did not make Ranulph any more attentive to his\r\nlessons; while Dame Marigold had no longer need of the tutor\'s hints\r\nto realise that the little boy was not himself. What alarmed her most\r\nin his condition was the violent effort that he had evidently to make\r\nin order to react in the least to his surroundings. For instance, if\r\nshe offered him a second helping at dinner, he would clench his fists,\r\nand beads of perspiration would break out on his forehead, so great an\r\neffort did it require to answer Yes or No.\r\n\r\nThere had never been any real sympathy between Ranulph and his mother\r\n(she had always preferred her daughter, Prunella), and she knew that if\r\nshe were to ask him what ailed him he would not tell her; so, instead,\r\nshe asked Ranulph\'s great ally and confidant, Master Nathaniel\'s old\r\nnurse, Mistress Hempen.\r\n\r\nHempie, as they called her, had served the family of Chanticleer for\r\nnearly fifty years, in fact ever since the birth of Master Nathaniel.\r\nAnd now she was called the housekeeper, though her duties were of the\r\nlightest, and consisted mainly of keeping the store-room keys and\r\nmending the linen.\r\n\r\nShe was a fine, hale old country-woman, with a wonderful gift for\r\namusing children. Not only did she know all the comic nursery stories\r\nof Dorimare (Ranulph\'s favourite was about a pair of spectacles whose\r\nambition was to ride on the nose of the Man-in-the-Moon, and who, in\r\nvain attempts to reach their goal, were always leaping off the nose of\r\ntheir unfortunate possessor), but she was, as well, an incomparable\r\nthough sedentary playfellow, and from her arm-chair would direct,\r\nwith seemingly unflagging interest, the manoeuvres of lead soldiers\r\nor the movements of marionettes. Indeed, her cosy room at the top of\r\nthe house seemed to Ranulph to have the power of turning every object\r\nthat crossed its threshold into a toy: the ostrich egg hanging from\r\nthe ceiling by a crimson cord, the little painted wax effigies of his\r\ngrandparents on the chimney-piece, the old spinning-wheel, even the\r\nempty bobbins, which made excellent wooden soldiers, and the pots\r\nof jam standing in rows to be labelled--they all presented infinite\r\npossibilities of being played with; while her fire seemed to purr more\r\ncontentedly than other fires and to carry prettier pictures in its red,\r\nglowing heart.\r\n\r\nWell, rather timidly (for Hempie had a rough edge to her tongue, and\r\nhad never ceased to look upon her mistress as a young and foolish\r\ninterloper), Dame Marigold told her that she was beginning to be a\r\nlittle anxious about Ranulph. Hempie shot her a sharp look over her\r\nspectacles, and, pursing her lips, drily remarked, "Well, ma\'am, it\'s\r\ntaken you a long time to see it."\r\n\r\nBut when Dame Marigold tried to find out what she thought was the\r\nmatter with him, she would only shake her head mysteriously, and mutter\r\nthat it was no use crying over spilt milk, and least said soonest\r\nmended.\r\n\r\nWhen finally the baffled Dame Marigold got up to go, the old woman\r\ncried shrilly: "Now, ma\'am, remember, not a word of this to the master!\r\nHe was never one that could stand being worried. He\'s like his father\r\nin that. My old mistress used often to say to me, \'Now, Polly, we won\'t\r\ntell the master. He can\'t stand worry.\' Aye, all the Chanticleers\r\nare wonderful sensitive." And the unexpressed converse of the last\r\nstatement was, "All the Vigils, on the other hand, have the hides of\r\nbuffaloes."\r\n\r\nDame Marigold, however, had no intention of mentioning the matter as\r\nyet to Master Nathaniel. Whether or not it was due to the Chanticleers\'\r\nsuperior sensitiveness of soul, the slightest worry, as she knew to her\r\ncost, made him unbearably irritable.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently, as yet, noticed nothing himself. Most of his day was\r\nspent in the Senate and his counting-house; besides, his interest in\r\nother people\'s lives was not extended to those of his own household.\r\n\r\nAs to his feelings for Ranulph, it must be confessed that he looked\r\nupon him more as an heirloom than as a son. In fact, unconsciously, he\r\nplaced him in the same category as the crystal goblet with which Duke\r\nAubrey\'s father had baptized the first ship owned by a Chanticleer, or\r\nthe sword with which his ancestor had helped to turn Duke Aubrey off\r\nthe throne--objects that he very rarely either looked at or thought\r\nabout, though the loss of them would have caused him to go half mad\r\nwith rage and chagrin.\r\n\r\nHowever, one evening, early in April, the matter was forced upon his\r\nattention in a very painful manner.\r\n\r\nBy this time spring had come to all the world, and the citizens\r\nof Lud-in-the-Mist were beginning to organise their life for\r\nsummer--copper vessels were being cleaned and polished for the coming\r\nlabours of the still-room, arbours in the gardens swept out and\r\ncleaned, and fishing-tackle overhauled; and people began to profit by\r\nthe longer days by giving supper-parties to their friends.\r\n\r\nNobody in Lud-in-the-Mist loved parties more than Master Nathaniel.\r\nThey were a temporary release. It was as if the tune of his life were\r\nsuddenly set to a different and gayer key; so that, while nothing was\r\nsubstantially changed, and the same chairs stood in the same places,\r\nwith people sitting in them that he met every day, and there was\r\neven the same small, dull ache in one of his teeth, nevertheless the\r\nsting, or rather the staleness, was taken out of it all. So it was\r\nvery gleefully that he sent invitations to all his cronies to come\r\n"and meet a Moongrass cheese"--as he had done every April for the last\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nMoongrass was a village of Dorimare famous for its cheeses--and rightly\r\nso, for to look at they were as beautiful as Parian marble veined with\r\njade, and they had to perfection the flavour of all good cheeses--that\r\nblending of the perfume of meadows with the cleanly stench of the\r\nbyre. It was the Moongrass cheeses that were the subject of the comic\r\nadvertisement described in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nBy seven o\'clock the Chanticleers\' parlour was filled with a crowd of\r\nstout, rosy, gaily-dressed guests, chattering and laughing like a flock\r\nof paroquets. Only Ranulph was silent; but that was to be expected\r\nfrom a little boy of twelve years old in the presence of his elders.\r\nHowever, he need not have sulked in a corner, nor responded quite so\r\nsurlily to the jocular remarks addressed him by his father\'s guests.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, of course, had a well-stored cellar, and the evening\r\nbegan with glasses of delicious wild-thyme gin, a cordial for which\r\nthat cellar was famous. But, as well, he had a share in a common\r\ncellar, owned jointly by all the families of the ruling class--a\r\ncellar of old, mellow jokes that, unlike bottles of wine, never ran\r\ndry. Whatever there was of ridiculous or lovable in each member of\r\nthe group was distilled into one of these jokes, so that at will one\r\ncould intoxicate oneself with one\'s friends\' personalities--swallow,\r\nas it were, the whole comic draught of them. And, seeing that in these\r\nold jokes the accumulated irritation that inevitably results from\r\nintimacy evaporated and turned to sweetness, like the juice of the\r\ngrape they promoted friendship and cordiality--between the members of\r\nthe group, that is to say. For each variety of humour is a sort of\r\ntotem, making at once for unity and separation. Its votaries it unites\r\ninto a closely-knit brotherhood, but it separates them sharply off\r\nfrom all the rest of the world. Perhaps the chief reason for the lack\r\nof sympathy between the rulers and the ruled in Dorimare was that, in\r\nhumour, they belonged to different totems.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, everyone there tonight shared the same totem, and each one of\r\nthem was the hero of one of the old jokes. Master Nathaniel was asked\r\nif his crimson velvet breeches were a blackish crimson because, many\r\nyears ago, he had forgotten to go into mourning for his father-in-law;\r\nand when Dame Marigold had, finally, tentatively pointed out to him his\r\nomission, he had replied angrily, "I am in mourning!" Then, when with\r\nupraised eyebrows she had looked at the canary-coloured stockings that\r\nhe had just purchased, he had said sheepishly, "Anyhow, it\'s a blackish\r\ncanary."\r\n\r\nFew wines have as strong a flavour of the grape as this old joke had of\r\nMaster Nathaniel. His absent-mindedness was in it, his power of seeing\r\nthings as he wanted them to be (he had genuinely believed himself to\r\nbe in mourning) and, finally, in the "blackish canary" there was the\r\ntendency, which he had inherited, perhaps, from his legal ancestors,\r\nto believe that one could play with reality and give it what shape one\r\nchose.\r\n\r\nThen, Master Ambrose Honeysuckle was asked whether the Honeysuckles\r\nconsidered a Moongrass cheese to be a cheese; the point being that\r\nMaster Ambrose had an exaggerated sense of the importance of his own\r\nfamily, and once in the law-courts, when the question arose as to\r\nwhether a dragon (there were still a few harmless, effete dragons\r\nlurking in caves in out-of-the-way parts of Dorimare) were a bird or a\r\nreptile, he had said, with an air of finality, "The Honeysuckles have\r\nalways considered them to be reptiles." And his wife, Dame Jessamine,\r\nwas asked if she wanted her supper "on paper," owing to her habit of\r\npinning her husband down to any rash promise, such as that of a new\r\nbarouche, by saying, "I\'d like that on paper, Ambrose."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Dame Marigold\'s brother, Master Polydore Vigil, and\r\nhis wife, Dame Dreamsweet, and old Mat Pyepowders and his preposterous,\r\nchattering dame, and the Peregrine Laquers and the Goceline Flacks and\r\nthe Hyacinth Baldbreeches--in fact, all the cream of the society of\r\nLud-in-the-Mist, and each of them labelled with his or her appropriate\r\njoke. And the old jokes went round and round, like bottles of port, and\r\nwith each round the company grew more hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous antiquary could have found in the culinary language\r\nof Dorimare another example to support his thesis; for the menu\r\nof the supper provided by Dame Marigold for her guests sounded\r\nlike a series of tragic sonnets. The first dish was called "The\r\nBitter-Sweet Mystery"--it was a soup of herbs on the successful\r\nblending of which the cooks of Lud-in-the-Mist based their reputation.\r\nThis was followed by "The Lottery of Dreams," which consisted of\r\nsuch delicacies as quail, snails, chicken\'s liver, plovers\' eggs,\r\npeacocks\' hearts, concealed under a mountain of boiled rice. Then came\r\n"True-Love-in-Ashes," a special way of preparing pigeons; and last,\r\n"Death\'s Violets," an extremely indigestible pudding decorated with\r\nsugared violets.\r\n\r\n"And now!" cried Master Nathaniel gleefully, "here comes the turn of\r\nour old friend! Fill your glasses, and drink to the King of Moongrass\r\nCheeses!"\r\n\r\n"To the King of Moongrass Cheeses!" echoed the guests, stamping with\r\ntheir feet and banging on the table. Whereupon Master Nathaniel seized\r\na knife, and was about to plunge it into the magnificent cheese, when\r\nsuddenly Ranulph rushed round to his side and, with tears in his eyes,\r\nimplored him, in a shrill terrified voice, not to cut the cheese. The\r\nguests, thinking it must be some obscure joke, tittered encouragingly,\r\nand Master Nathaniel, after staring at him in amazement for a few\r\nseconds, said testily, "What\'s taken the boy? Hands off, Ranulph, I\r\nsay! Have you gone mad?" But Ranulph\'s eyes were now starting out of\r\nhis head in fury, and, hanging on to his father\'s arm, he screamed in\r\nhis shrill, childish voice, "No, you won\'t! you won\'t, you won\'t! I\r\nwon\'t let you!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Ranulph!" laughed one of the guests. "You stand up to\r\nyour father!"\r\n\r\n"By the Milky Way! Marigold," roared Master Nathaniel, beginning to\r\nlose his temper, "what\'s taken the boy, I ask?"\r\n\r\nDame Marigold was looking nervous. "Ranulph! Ranulph!" she cried\r\nreproachfully, "go back to your place, and don\'t tease your father."\r\n\r\n"No! No! No!" shrieked Ranulph still more shrilly, "he shall not kill\r\nthe moon ... he shall not, I say. If he does, all the flowers will\r\nwither in Fairyland."\r\n\r\nHow am I to convey to you the effect that these words produced on\r\nthe company? It would not be adequate to ask you to imagine your own\r\nfeelings were your host\'s small son suddenly, in a mixed company, to\r\npour forth a stream of obscene language; for Ranulph\'s words were\r\nnot merely a shock to good taste--they aroused, as well, some of the\r\nsuperstitious terror caused by the violation of a taboo.\r\n\r\nThe ladies all blushed crimson, the gentlemen looked stern, while\r\nMaster Nathaniel, his face purple, yelled in a voice of thunder, "Go\r\nto bed this instant, Ranulph ... and I\'ll come and deal with you later\r\non"; and Ranulph, who suddenly seemed to have lost all interest in the\r\nfate of the cheese, meekly left the room.\r\n\r\nThere were no more jokes that evening, and on most of the plates the\r\ncheese lay neglected; and in spite of the efforts of some of the\r\nguests, conversation flagged sadly, so that it was scarcely nine\r\no\'clock when the party broke up.\r\n\r\nWhen Master Nathaniel was left alone with Dame Marigold he fiercely\r\ndemanded an explanation of Ranulph\'s behaviour. But she merely shrugged\r\nher shoulders wearily, and said she thought the boy must have gone mad,\r\nand told him how for some weeks he had seemed to her unlike himself.\r\n\r\n"Then why wasn\'t I told? Why wasn\'t I told?" stormed Master Nathaniel.\r\nAgain Dame Marigold shrugged her shoulders, and, as she looked at him,\r\nthere was a gleam of delicate, humourous contempt in her heavily-lidded\r\neyes. Dame Marigold\'s eyes, by the way, had a characteristic, which\r\nwas to be found often enough among the Ludites--you would have called\r\nthem dreamy and languorous, had it not been for the expression of the\r\nmouth, which with its long satirical upper lip, like that of an old\r\njudge, and the whimsical twist to its corners, reacted on the eyes,\r\nand made them mocking and almost too humourous--never more so than when\r\nshe looked at Master Nathaniel. In her own way she was fond of him. But\r\nher attitude was not unlike that of an indulgent mistress to a shaggy,\r\nuncertain-tempered, performing dog.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel began to pace up and down the room, his fists\r\nclenched, muttering imprecations against inefficient women and the\r\noverwhelming worries of a family man--in his need for a victim on whom\r\nto vent his rage, actually feeling angry with Dame Marigold for having\r\nmarried him and let him in for all this fuss and to-do. And his shadowy\r\nfears were more than usually clamorous. Dame Marigold, as she sat\r\nwatching him, felt that he was rather like a cockchafer that had just\r\nflounced in through the open window, and, with a small, smacking sound,\r\nwas bouncing itself backwards and forwards against its own shadow on\r\nthe ceiling--a shadow that looked like a big, black velvety moth. But\r\nit was its clumsiness, and blundering ineffectualness that reminded her\r\nof Master Nathaniel; not the fact that it was banging itself against\r\nthe shadow.\r\n\r\nUp and down marched Master Nathaniel, backwards and forwards bounced\r\nthe cockchafer, hither and thither flitted its soft, dainty shadow.\r\nThen, suddenly, straight as a die, the cockchafer came tumbling down\r\nfrom the ceiling and, at the same time, Master Nathaniel--calling over\r\nhis shoulder, "I must go up and see that boy"--dashed from the room.\r\n\r\nHe found Ranulph in bed, sobbing his heart out, and as he looked at\r\nthe piteous little figure he felt his anger evaporating. He laid his\r\nhand on the boy\'s shoulder and said not unkindly: "Come, my son; crying\r\nwon\'t mend matters. You\'ll write an apology to Cousin Ambrose, and\r\nUncle Polydore, and all the rest of them, tomorrow; and then--well,\r\nwe\'ll try to forget about it. We\'re none of us quite responsible for\r\nwhat we say when we\'re out of sorts ... and I gather from your mother\r\nyou\'ve not been feeling quite the thing these past weeks."\r\n\r\n"It was something made me say it!" sobbed Ranulph.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a nice, easy way of getting out of it," said Master\r\nNathaniel more sternly. "No, no, Ranulph, there\'s no excuse for\r\nbehaviour like that, none whatever. By the Harvest of Souls!" and his\r\nvoice became indignant, "Where did you pick up such ideas and such\r\nexpressions?"\r\n\r\n"But they\'re true! They\'re true!" screamed Ranulph.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going into the question of whether they\'re true or not. All\r\nI know is that they\'re not the things talked about by ladies and\r\ngentlemen. Such language has never before been heard under my roof, and\r\nI trust it never will be again ... you understand?"\r\n\r\nRanulph groaned, and Master Nathaniel added in a kinder voice, "Well,\r\nwe\'ll say no more about it. And now what\'s all this I hear from your\r\nmother about your being out of sorts, eh?"\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph\'s sobs redoubled. "I want to get away! to get away!" he\r\nmoaned.\r\n\r\n"Away? Away from where?" and there was a touch of impatience in Master\r\nNathaniel\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"From ... from things happening," sobbed Ranulph.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s heart suddenly contracted; but he tried not to\r\nunderstand. "Things happening?" he said in a voice that he endeavoured\r\nto make jocular. "I don\'t think anything very much happens in Lud, does\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"All the things," moaned Ranulph, "summer and winter, and days and\r\nnights. All the things!"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel had a sudden vision of Lud and the surrounding\r\ncountry, motionless and soundless, as it appeared from the Fields\r\nof Grammary. Was it possible that Ranulph, too, was a real person,\r\na person inside whose mind things happened? He had thought that he\r\nhimself was the only real person in a field of human flowers. For\r\nMaster Nathaniel that was a moment of surprise, triumph, tenderness,\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nRanulph had now stopped sobbing, and was lying there quite still. "The\r\nwhole of me seems to have got inside my head, and to hurt ... just like\r\nit all gets inside a tooth when one has toothache," he said wearily.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel looked at him. The fixed stare, the slightly-open\r\nmouth, the rigid motionless body, fettered by a misery too profound\r\nfor restlessness--how well he knew the state of mind these things\r\nexpressed! But there must surely be relief in thus allowing the mood to\r\nmould the body\'s attitude to its own shape.\r\n\r\nHe had no need now to ask his son for explanations. He knew so well\r\nboth that sense of emptiness, that drawing in of the senses (like\r\nthe antennae of some creature when danger is no longer imminent, but\r\nthere), so that the physical world vanishes, while you yourself at once\r\nswell out to fill its place, and at the same time shrink to a millionth\r\npart of your former bulk, turning into a mere organ of suffering\r\nwithout thought and without emotions; he knew also that other phase,\r\nwhen one seems to be flying from days and months, like a stag from its\r\nhunters--like the fugitives, on the old tapestry, from the moon.\r\n\r\nBut when it is another person who is suffering in this way, in spite of\r\none\'s pity, how trivial it all seems! How certain one is of being able\r\nto expel the agony with reasoning and persuasion!\r\n\r\nIt was in a slightly husky voice that, laying his hand on Ranulph\'s,\r\nhe said, "Come, my son, this won\'t do." And then, with a twinkle, he\r\nadded, "Chivvy the black rooks away from the corn."\r\n\r\nRanulph gave a little shrill laugh. "There are no black rooks--all the\r\nbirds are golden," he cried.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel frowned--with that sort of thing he had no patience.\r\nBut he determined to ignore it, and to keep to the aspect of the case\r\nfor which he had real sympathy. "Come, my son!" he said, in a tenderly\r\nrallying voice. "Tell yourself that tomorrow it will all be gone. Why,\r\nyou don\'t think you\'re the only one, do you? We all feel like that at\r\ntimes, but we don\'t let ourselves be beaten by it, and mope and pine\r\nand hang our heads. We stick a smile on our faces and go about our\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, as he spoke, swelled with complacency. He had never\r\nrealised it before, but really it was rather fine the way he had\r\nsuffered in silence, all these years!\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph had sat up in bed, and was looking at him with a strange\r\nlittle smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not the same as you, father," he said quietly. And then once more\r\nhe was shaken by great sobs, and screamed out in a voice of anguish, "I\r\nhave eaten fairy fruit!"\r\n\r\nAt these terrible words Master Nathaniel stood for a moment dizzy with\r\nhorror; then he lost his head. He rushed out on to the landing, calling\r\nfor Dame Marigold at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n"Marigold! Marigold! Marigold!"\r\n\r\nDame Marigold came hurrying up the stairs, calling out in a frightened\r\nvoice, "What is it, Nat? Oh, dear! What is it?"\r\n\r\n"By the Harvest of Souls, hurry! Hurry! Here\'s the boy saying he\'s been\r\neating ... the stuff we don\'t mention. Suffering cats! I\'ll go mad!"\r\n\r\nDame Marigold fluttered down on Ranulph like a plump dove.\r\n\r\nBut her voice had none of the husky tenderness of a dove as she cried,\r\n"Oh, Ranulph! You naughty boy! Oh, dear, this is frightful! Nat! Nat!\r\nWhat are we to do?"\r\n\r\nRanulph shrank away from her, and cast an imploring look towards his\r\nfather. Whereupon Master Nathaniel took her roughly by the shoulders\r\nand pushed her out of the room, saying, "If that is all you can say,\r\nyou\'d better leave the boy to me."\r\n\r\nAnd Dame Marigold, as she went down the stairs, terrified,\r\ncontemptuous, sick at heart, was feeling every inch a Vigil, and\r\nmuttering angrily to herself, "Oh, these Chanticleers!"\r\n\r\nWe are not yet civilised enough for exogamy; and, when anything\r\nseriously goes wrong, married couples are apt to lay all the blame at\r\nits door.\r\n\r\nWell, it would seem that the worst disgrace that could befall a family\r\nof Dorimare had come to the Chanticleers. But Master Nathaniel was no\r\nlonger angry with Ranulph. What would it serve to be angry? Besides,\r\nthere was this new tenderness flooding his heart, and he could not but\r\nyield to it.\r\n\r\nBit by bit he got the whole story from the boy. It would seem that some\r\nmonths ago a wild, mischievous lad called Willy Wisp who, for a short\r\ntime, had worked in Master Nathaniel\'s stables, had given Ranulph one\r\nsherd of a fruit he had never seen before. When Ranulph had eaten it,\r\nWilly Wisp had gone off into peal upon peal of mocking laughter, crying\r\nout, "Ah, little master, what you\'ve just eaten is FAIRY FRUIT, and\r\nyou\'ll never be the same again ... ho, ho, hoh!"\r\n\r\nAt these words Ranulph had been overwhelmed with horror and shame: "But\r\nnow I nearly always forget to be ashamed," he said. "All that seems to\r\nmatter now is to get away ... where there are shadows and quiet ... and\r\nwhere I can get ... more fruit."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel sighed heavily. But he said nothing; he only stroked\r\nthe small, hot hand he was holding in his own.\r\n\r\n"And once," went on Ranulph, sitting up in bed, his cheeks flushed,\r\nhis eyes bright and feverish, "in the garden in full daylight I saw\r\nthem dancing--the Silent People, I mean--and their leader was a man in\r\ngreen, and he called out to me, \'Hail, young Chanticleer! Some day I\'ll\r\nsend my piper for you, and you will up and follow him!\' And I often see\r\nhis shadow in the garden, but it\'s not like our shadows, it\'s a bright\r\nlight that flickers over the lawn. And I\'ll go, I\'ll go, I\'ll go, I\'ll\r\ngo, some day, I know I shall!" and his voice was frightened and, at the\r\nsame time, triumphant.\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, my son!" said Master Nathaniel soothingly, "I don\'t think\r\nwe\'ll let you go." But his heart felt like lead.\r\n\r\n"And ever since ... since I ate ... the fruit," went on Ranulph,\r\n"everything has frightened me ... at least, not only since then,\r\nbecause it did before too, but it\'s much worse now. Like that cheese\r\ntonight ... anything can suddenly seem queer or terrible. But\r\nsince ... since I ate that fruit I sometimes seem to see the reason why\r\nthey\'re terrible. Just as I did tonight over the cheese, and I was so\r\nfrightened that I simply couldn\'t keep quiet another minute."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel groaned. He too had felt frightened of homely things.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Ranulph suddenly, "What does the cock say to you?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel gave a start. It was as if his own soul were speaking\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"What does he say to me?"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. Never before had he spoken to anyone about his inner\r\nlife. In a voice that trembled a little, for it was a great effort to\r\nhim to speak, he went on, "He says to me, Ranulph, he says ... that the\r\npast will never come again, but that we must remember that the past is\r\nmade of the present, and that the present is always here. And he says\r\nthat the dead long to be back again on the earth, and that...."\r\n\r\n"No! No!" cried Ranulph fretfully, "he doesn\'t say that to me. He tells\r\nme to come away ... away from real things ... that bite one. That\'s\r\nwhat he says to me."\r\n\r\n"No, my son. No," said Master Nathaniel firmly. "He doesn\'t say that.\r\nYou have misunderstood."\r\n\r\nThen Ranulph again began to sob. "Oh, father! father!" he moaned, "they\r\nhunt me so--the days and nights. Hold me! Hold me!"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, with a passion of tenderness such as he had never\r\nthought himself capable of, lay down beside him, and took the little,\r\ntrembling body into his arms, and murmured loving, reassuring words.\r\n\r\nGradually Ranulph stopped sobbing, and before long he fell into a\r\npeaceful sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                 ENDYMION LEER PRESCRIBES FOR RANULPH\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel awoke the following morning with a less leaden heart\r\nthan the circumstances would seem to warrant. In the person of Ranulph\r\nan appalling disgrace had come upon him, and there could be no doubt\r\nbut that Ranulph\'s life and reason were both in danger. But mingling\r\nwith his anxiety was the pleasant sense of a new possession--this\r\nlove for his son that he had suddenly discovered in his heart, and it\r\naroused in him all the pride and the pleasure that a new pony would\r\nhave done when he was a boy.\r\n\r\nBesides, there was that foolish feeling of his that reality was not\r\nsolid, and that facts were only plastic toys; or, rather, that they\r\nwere poisonous plants, which you need not pluck unless you choose. And,\r\neven if you do pluck them, you can always fling them from you and leave\r\nthem to wither on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to vent his rage on Willy Wisp. But during the\r\nprevious winter Willy had mysteriously disappeared. And though a whole\r\nmonth\'s wages had been owing to him, he had never been seen or heard of\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of his attitude to facts, the sense of responsibility\r\nthat had been born with this new love for Ranulph forced him to take\r\nsome action in the matter, and he decided to call in Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer had arrived in Lud-in-the-Mist some thirty years ago, no\r\none knew from where.\r\n\r\nHe was a physician, and his practice soon became one of the biggest in\r\nthe town, but was mainly confined to the tradespeople and the poorer\r\npart of the population, for the leading families were conservative,\r\nand always a little suspicious of strangers. Besides, they considered\r\nhim apt to be disrespectful, and his humour had a quality that made\r\nthem vaguely uncomfortable. For instance, he would sometimes startle a\r\npolite company by exclaiming half to himself, "Life and death! Life and\r\ndeath! They are the dyes in which I work. Are my hands stained?" And,\r\nwith his curious dry chuckle, he would hold them out for inspection.\r\n\r\nHowever, so great was his skill and learning that even the people who\r\ndisliked him most were forced to consult him in really serious cases.\r\n\r\nAmong the humbler classes his was a name to conjure with, for he was\r\nalways ready to adapt his fees to the purses of his patients, and\r\nwhere the purses were empty he gave his services free. For he took a\r\ngenuine pleasure in the exercise of his craft for its own sake. One\r\nof the stories told about him was that one night he had been summoned\r\nfrom his bed to a farm-house that lay several miles beyond the walls\r\nof the town, to find when he got there that his patient was only a\r\nlittle black pig, the sole survivor of a valuable litter. But he took\r\nthe discovery in good part, and settled down for the night to tend the\r\nlittle animal; and by morning he was able to declare it out of danger.\r\nWhen, on his return to Lud-in-the-Mist, he had been twitted for having\r\nwasted so much time on such an unworthy object, he had answered that\r\na pig was thrall to the same master as a Mayor, and that it needed as\r\nmuch skill to cure the one as the other; adding that a good fiddler\r\nenjoys fiddling for its own sake, and that it is all the same to him\r\nwhether he plays at a yokel\'s wedding or a merchant\'s funeral.\r\n\r\nHe did not confine his interests to medicine. Though not himself by\r\nbirth a Dorimarite, there was little concerning the ancient customs of\r\nhis adopted country that he did not know; and some years ago he had\r\nbeen asked by the Senate to write the official history of the Guild\r\nHall, which, before the revolution, had been the palace of the Dukes,\r\nand was the finest monument in Lud-in-the-Mist. To this task he had for\r\nsome time devoted his scanty leisure.\r\n\r\nThe Senators had no severer critic than Endymion Leer, and he was\r\nthe originator of most of the jokes at their expense that circulated\r\nin Lud-in-the-Mist. But to Master Nathaniel Chanticleer he seemed to\r\nhave a personal antipathy; and on the rare occasions when they met his\r\nmanner was almost insolent.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that this dislike was due to the fact that Ranulph when\r\nhe was a tiny boy had seriously offended him; for pointing his fat\r\nlittle finger at him he had shouted in his shrill baby voice:\r\n\r\n    "Before the cry of Chanticleer\r\n    Gibbers away Endymion Leer."\r\n\r\nWhen his mother had scolded him for his rudeness, he said that he had\r\nbeen taught the rhyme by a funny old man he had seen in his dreams.\r\nEndymion Leer had gone deadly white--with rage, Dame Marigold supposed;\r\nand during several years he never referred to Ranulph except in a voice\r\nof suppressed spite.\r\n\r\nBut that was years ago, and it was to be presumed that he had at last\r\nforgotten what had, after all, been nothing but a piece of childish\r\nimpudence.\r\n\r\nThe idea of confiding to this upstart the disgraceful thing that had\r\nhappened to a Chanticleer was very painful to Master Nathaniel. But if\r\nanyone could cure Ranulph it was Endymion Leer, so Master Nathaniel\r\npocketed his pride and asked him to come and see him.\r\n\r\nAs Master Nathaniel paced up and down his pipe-room (as his private\r\nden was called) waiting for the doctor, the full horror of what had\r\nhappened swept over him. Ranulph had committed the unmentionable\r\ncrime--he had eaten fairy fruit. If it ever became known--and these\r\nsort of things always did become known--the boy would be ruined\r\nsocially for ever. And, in any case, his health would probably be\r\nseriously affected for years to come. Up and down like a see-saw went\r\nthe two aspects of the case in his anxious mind ... a Chanticleer had\r\neaten fairy fruit; little Ranulph was in danger.\r\n\r\nThen the page announced Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\nHe was a little rotund man of about sixty, with a snub nose, a freckled\r\nface, and with one eye blue and the other brown.\r\n\r\nAs Master Nathaniel met his shrewd, slightly contemptuous glance he had\r\nan uncomfortable feeling which he had often before experienced in his\r\npresence, namely that the little man could read his thoughts. So he did\r\nnot beat about the bush, but told him straight away why he had called\r\nhim in.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer gave a low whistle. Then he shot at Master Nathaniel\r\na look that was almost menacing and said sharply, "Who gave him the\r\nstuff?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel told him it was a lad who had once been in his service\r\ncalled Willy Wisp.\r\n\r\n"Willy Wisp?" cried the doctor hoarsely. "Willy Wisp?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Willy Wisp ... confound him for a double-dyed villain," said\r\nMaster Nathaniel fiercely. And then added in some surprise, "Do you\r\nknow him?"\r\n\r\n"Know him? Yes, I know him. Who doesn\'t know Willy Wisp?" said the\r\ndoctor. "You see not being a merchant or a Senator," he added with a\r\nsneer, "I can mix with whom I choose. Willy Wisp with his pranks was\r\nthe plague of the town while he was in it, and his Worship the Mayor\r\nwasn\'t altogether blessed by the townsfolk for keeping such a rascally\r\nservant."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, when I next meet him I\'ll thrash him within an inch of\r\nhis life," cried Master Nathaniel violently; and Endymion Leer looked\r\nat him with a queer little smile.\r\n\r\n"And now you\'d better take me to see your son and heir," he said, after\r\na pause.\r\n\r\n"Do you ... do you think you\'ll be able to cure him?" Master Nathaniel\r\nasked hoarsely, as he led the way to the parlour.\r\n\r\n"I never answer that kind of question before I\'ve seen the patient, and\r\nnot always then," answered Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\nRanulph was lying on a couch in the parlour, and Dame Marigold was\r\nsitting embroidering, her face pale and a little defiant. She was still\r\nfeeling every inch a Vigil and full of resentment against the two\r\nChanticleers, father and son, for having involved her in this horrible\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nPoor Master Nathaniel stood by, faint with apprehension, while Endymion\r\nLeer examined Ranulph\'s tongue, felt his pulse and, at the same time,\r\nasked him minute questions as to his symptoms.\r\n\r\nFinally he turned to Master Nathaniel and said, "I want to be left\r\nalone with him. He will talk to me more easily without you and your\r\ndame. Doctors should always see their patients alone."\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph gave a piercing shriek of terror. "No, no, no!" he cried.\r\n"Father! Father! Don\'t leave me with him."\r\n\r\nAnd then he fainted.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel began to lose his head, and to buzz and bang again\r\nlike a cockchafer. But Endymion Leer remained perfectly calm. And\r\nthe man who remains calm inevitably takes command of a situation.\r\nMaster Nathaniel found himself gently but firmly pushed out of his own\r\nparlour, and the door locked in his face. Dame Marigold had followed\r\nhim, and there was nothing for them to do but to await the doctor\'s\r\ngood pleasure in the pipe-room.\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon, and Stars, I\'m going back!" cried Master Nathaniel\r\nwildly. "I don\'t trust that fellow, I\'m not going to leave Ranulph\r\nalone with him, I\'m going back."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense, Nat!" cried Dame Marigold wearily. "Do please be calm.\r\nOne really must allow a doctor to have his way."\r\n\r\nFor about a quarter of an hour Master Nathaniel paced the room with\r\nill-concealed impatience.\r\n\r\nThe parlour was opposite the pipe-room, with only a narrow passage\r\nbetween them, and as Master Nathaniel had opened the door of the\r\npipe-room, he soon was able to hear a murmur of voices proceeding from\r\nthe parlour. This was comforting, for it showed that Ranulph must have\r\ncome to.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, his whole body seemed to stiffen, the pupils of his\r\neyes dilated, he went ashy white, and in a low terrified voice he\r\ncried, "Marigold, do you hear?"\r\n\r\nIn the parlour somebody was singing. It was a pretty, plaintive air,\r\nand if one listened carefully one could distinguish the words.\r\n\r\n    "And can the physician make sick men well,\r\n    And can the magician a fortune divine\r\n    Without lily, germander, and sops in wine?\r\n    With sweet-brier,\r\n    And bon-fire,\r\n    And strawberry-wire,\r\n    And columbine."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, Nat!" cried Dame Marigold, with a mocking look of\r\ndespair. "What on earth is the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"Marigold! Marigold!" he cried hoarsely, seizing her wrists, "don\'t you\r\nhear?"\r\n\r\n"I hear a vulgar old song, if that\'s what you mean. I\'ve known it all\r\nmy life. It is very kind and domesticated of Endymion Leer to turn\r\nnursemaid and rock the cradle like this!"\r\n\r\nBut what Master Nathaniel had heard was the Note.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds he stood motionless, the sweat breaking out on his\r\nforehead. Then blind with rage, he dashed across the corridor. But he\r\nhad forgotten the parlour was locked, so he dashed out by the front\r\ndoor and came bursting in by the window that opened on to the garden.\r\n\r\nThe two occupants of the parlour were evidently so absorbed in each\r\nother that they had noticed neither Master Nathaniel\'s violent assault\r\non the door nor yet his entry by the window.\r\n\r\nRanulph was lying on the couch with a look on his face of extraordinary\r\npeace and serenity, and there was Endymion Leer, crouching over him and\r\nsoftly crooning the tune to which he had before been singing words.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, roaring like a bull, flung himself on the doctor,\r\nand, dragging him to his feet, began to shake him as a terrier does a\r\nrat, at the same time belabouring him with every insulting epithet he\r\ncould remember, including, of course, "Son of a Fairy."\r\n\r\nAs for Ranulph, he began to whimper, and complain that his father had\r\nspoiled everything, for the doctor had been making him well.\r\n\r\nThe din caused terrified servants to come battering at the door,\r\nand Dame Marigold came hurrying in by the garden window, and, pink\r\nwith shame, she began to drag at Master Nathaniel\'s coat, almost\r\nhysterically imploring him to come to his senses.\r\n\r\nBut it was only to exhaustion that he finally yielded, and relaxed\r\nhis hold on his victim, who was purple in the face and gasping for\r\nbreath--so severe had been the shaking.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold cast a look of unutterable disgust at her panting,\r\ntriumphant husband, and overwhelmed the little doctor with apologies\r\nand offers of restoratives. He sank down on a chair, unable for a few\r\nseconds to get his breath, while Master Nathaniel stood glaring at\r\nhim, and poor Ranulph lay whimpering on the couch with a white scared\r\nface. Then the victim of Master Nathaniel\'s fury got to his feet, gave\r\nhimself a little shake, took out his handkerchief and mopped his\r\nforehead, and with a little chuckle and in a voice in which there was\r\nno trace of resentment, remarked, "Well, a good shaking is a fine thing\r\nfor settling the humours. Your Worship has turned doctor! Thank you ...\r\nthank you kindly for your physic."\r\n\r\nBut Master Nathaniel said in a stern voice, "What were you doing to my\r\nson?"\r\n\r\n"What was I doing to him? Why, I was giving him medicine. Songs were\r\nmedicines long before herbs."\r\n\r\n"He was making me well," moaned Ranulph.\r\n\r\n"What was that song?" demanded Master Nathaniel, in the same stern\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"A very old song. Nurses sing it to children. You must have known it\r\nall your life. What\'s it called again? You know it, Dame Marigold,\r\ndon\'t you? \'Columbine\'--yes, that\'s it. \'Columbine.\'"\r\n\r\nThe trees in the garden twinkled and murmured. The birds were\r\nclamorous. From the distance came the chimes of the Guildhall clock,\r\nand the parlour smelt of spring-flowers and pot-pourri.\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to relax in Master Nathaniel. He passed his hand over\r\nhis forehead, gave an impatient little shrug, and, laughing awkwardly,\r\nsaid, "I ... I really don\'t quite know what took me. I\'ve been anxious\r\nabout the boy, and I suppose it had upset me a little. I can only beg\r\nyour pardon, Leer."\r\n\r\n"No need to apologize ... no need at all. No doctor worth his salt\r\ntakes offence with ... sick men," and the look he shot at Master\r\nNathaniel was both bright and strange.\r\n\r\nAgain Master Nathaniel frowned, and very stiffly he murmured "Thank\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Well," went on the doctor in a matter-of-fact voice, "I should like to\r\nhave a little private talk with you about this young gentleman. May I?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course, Dr. Leer," cried Dame Marigold hastily, for she\r\nsaw that her husband was hesitating. "He will be delighted, I am sure.\r\nThough I think you\'re a very brave man to trust yourself to such a\r\nmonster. Nat, take Dr. Leer into the pipe-room."\r\n\r\nAnd Master Nathaniel did so.\r\n\r\nOnce there the doctor\'s first words made him so happy as instantly to\r\ndrive away all traces of his recent fright and to make him even forget\r\nto be ashamed of his abominable behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhat the doctor said was, "Cheer up, your Worship! I don\'t for a moment\r\nbelieve that boy of yours has eaten--what one mustn\'t mention."\r\n\r\n"What? What?" cried Master Nathaniel joyfully. "By the Golden Apples of\r\nthe West! It\'s been a storm in a tea-cup then? The little rascal, what\r\na fright he gave us!"\r\n\r\nOf course, he had known all the time that it could not be true! Facts\r\ncould never be as stubborn as that, and as cruel.\r\n\r\nAnd this incorrigible optimist about facts was the same man who walked\r\nin daily terror of the unknown. But perhaps the one state of mind was\r\nthe outcome of the other.\r\n\r\nThen, as he remembered the poignancy of the scene between himself and\r\nRanulph last night and, as well, the convincingness of Ranulph\'s story,\r\nhis heart once more grew heavy.\r\n\r\n"But ... but," he faltered, "what was the good of this cock and bull\r\nstory, then? What purpose did it serve? There\'s no doubt the boy\'s ill\r\nin both mind and body, and why, in the name of the Milky Way, should\r\nhe go to the trouble of inventing a story about Willy Wisp\'s giving\r\nhim a taste of that damned stuff?" and he looked at Endymion Leer\r\nappealingly, as much as to say, "Here are the facts. I give them to\r\nyou. Be merciful and give them a less ugly shape."\r\n\r\nThis Endymion Leer proceeded to do.\r\n\r\n"How do we know it was ... \'that damned stuff\'?" he asked. "We have\r\nonly Willy Wisp\'s word for it, and from what I know of that gentleman,\r\nhis word is about as reliable as ... as the wind in a frolic. All\r\nLud knows of his practical jokes ... he\'d say anything to give one a\r\nfright. No, no, believe me, he was just playing off one of his pranks\r\non Master Ranulph. I\'ve had some experience in the real thing--I\'ve\r\nan extensive practice, you know, down at the wharf--and your son\'s\r\nsymptoms aren\'t the same. No, no, your son is no more likely to have\r\neaten fairy fruit--than you are."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel smiled, and stretched his arms in an ecstasy of\r\nrelief. "Thank you, Leer, thank you," he said huskily. "The whole thing\r\nwas appalling that really I believe it almost turned my head. And\r\nyou are a very kind fellow not to bear me a grudge for my monstrous\r\nmishandling of you in the parlour just now."\r\n\r\nFor the moment Master Nathaniel felt as if he really loved the queer,\r\nsharp-tongued, little upstart.\r\n\r\n"And now," he went on gleefully, "to show me that it is really\r\nforgotten and forgiven, we must pledge each other in some wild-thyme\r\ngin ... my cellar is rather noted for it, you know," and from a corner\r\ncupboard he brought out two glasses and a decanter of the fragrant\r\ngreen cordial, left over from the supper-party of the previous night.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes they sat sipping in silent contentment.\r\n\r\nThen Endymion Leer, as if speaking to himself, said dreamily, "Yes,\r\nthis is perhaps the solution. Why should we look for any other cure\r\nwhen we have the wild-thyme distilled by our ancestors? Wild time? No,\r\ntime isn\'t wild ... time-gin, sloe-gin. It is very soothing."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel grunted. He understood perfectly what Endymion Leer\r\nmeant, but he did not choose to show that he did. Any remark verging on\r\nthe poetical or philosophical always embarrassed him. Fortunately, such\r\nremarks were rare in Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nSo he put down his glass and said briskly, "Now then, Leer, let\'s go to\r\nbusiness. You\'ve removed an enormous load from my mind, but, all the\r\nsame, the boy\'s not himself. What\'s the matter with him?"\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer gave an odd little smile. And then he said, slowly and\r\ndeliberately, "Master Nathaniel, what is the matter with you?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel started violently.\r\n\r\n"The matter with me?" he said coldly. "I have not asked you in to\r\nconsult you about my own health. We will, if you please, keep to that\r\nof my son."\r\n\r\nBut he rather spoiled the dignified effect his words might have had by\r\ngobbling like a turkey cock, and muttering under his breath, "Damn the\r\nfellow and his impudence!" Endymion Leer chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Well, I may have been mistaken," he said, "but I have sometimes had\r\nthe impression that our Worship the Mayor was, well, a whimsical\r\nfellow, given to queer fancies. Do you know my name for your house? I\r\ncall it the Mayor\'s Nest. The Mayor\'s Nest!"\r\n\r\nAnd he flung back his head and laughed heartily at his own joke, while\r\nMaster Nathaniel glared at him, speechless with rage.\r\n\r\n"Now, your Worship," he went on in a more serious voice. "If I have\r\nbeen indiscreet you must forgive me ... as I forgave you in the\r\nparlour. You see, a doctor is obliged to keep his eyes open ... it\r\nis not from what his patients tell him that he prescribes for them,\r\nbut from what he notices himself. To a doctor everything is a\r\nsymptom ... the way a man lights his pipe even. For instance, I once\r\nhad the honour of having your Worship as my partner at a game of cards.\r\nYou\'ve forgotten probably--it was years ago at the Pyepowders. We lost\r\nthat game. Why? Because each time that you held the most valuable\r\ncard in the pack--the Lyre of Bones--you discarded it as if it had\r\nburnt your fingers. Things like that set a doctor wondering, Master\r\nNathaniel. You are a man who is frightened about something."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel slowly turned crimson. Now that the doctor mentioned\r\nit, he remembered quite well that at one time he objected to holding\r\nthe Lyre of Bones. Its name caused him to connect it with the Note.\r\nAs we have seen, he was apt to regard innocent things as taboo. But to\r\nthink that somebody should have noticed it!\r\n\r\n"This is a necessary preface to what I have got to say with regard to\r\nyour son," went on Endymion Leer. "You see, I want to make it clear\r\nthat, though one has never come within a mile of fairy fruit, one can\r\nhave all the symptoms of being an habitual consumer of it. Wait! Wait!\r\nHear me out!"\r\n\r\nFor Master Nathaniel, with a smothered exclamation, had sprung from his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"I am not saying that you have all these symptoms ... far from it. But\r\nyou know that there are spurious imitations of many diseases of the\r\nbody--conditions that imitate exactly all the symptoms of the disease,\r\nand the doctors themselves are often taken in by them. You wish me\r\nto confine my remarks to your son ... well, I consider that he is\r\nsuffering from a spurious surfeit of fairy fruit."\r\n\r\nThough still angry, Master Nathaniel was feeling wonderfully relieved.\r\nThis explanation of his own condition that robbed it of all mystery\r\nand, somehow, made it rational, seemed almost as good as a cure. So\r\nhe let the doctor go on with his disquisition without any further\r\ninterruption except the purely rhetorical ones of an occasional\r\nprotesting grunt.\r\n\r\n"Now, I have studied somewhat closely the effects of fairy fruit,"\r\nthe doctor was saying. "These effects we regard as a malady. But, in\r\nreality, they are more like a melody--a tune that one can\'t get out of\r\none\'s head," and he shot a very sly little look at Master Nathaniel,\r\nout of his bright bird-like eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he went on in a thoughtful voice, "its effects, I think, can\r\nbest be described as a changing of the inner rhythm by which we live.\r\nHave you ever noticed a little child of three or four walking hand in\r\nhand with its father through the streets? It is almost as if the two\r\nwere walking in time to perfectly different tunes. Indeed, though they\r\nhold each other\'s hand, they might be walking on different planets ...\r\neach seeing and hearing entirely different things. And while the father\r\nmarches steadily on towards some predetermined goal, the child pulls\r\nagainst his hand, laughs without cause, makes little bird-like swoops\r\nat invisible objects. Now, anyone who has tasted fairy fruit (your\r\nWorship will excuse my calling a spade a spade in this way, but in my\r\nprofession one can\'t be mealy-mouthed)--anyone, then, who has tasted\r\nfairy fruit walks through life beside other people to a different tune\r\nfrom theirs ... just like the little child beside its father. But one\r\ncan be born to a different tune ... and that, I believe, is the case\r\nwith Master Ranulph. Now, if he is ever to become a useful citizen,\r\nthough he need not lose his own tune, he must learn to walk in time to\r\nother people\'s. He will not learn to do that here--at present. Master\r\nNathaniel, you are not good for your son."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel moved uneasily in his chair, and in a stifled voice he\r\nsaid, "What then do you recommend?"\r\n\r\n"I should recommend his being taught another tune," said the doctor\r\nbriskly. "A different one from any he has heard before ... but one\r\nto which other people walk as well as he. You must have captains and\r\nmates, Master Nathaniel, with little houses down at the seaport town.\r\nIs there no honest fellow among them with a sensible wife with whom\r\nthe lad could lodge for a month or two? Or stay," he went on, without\r\ngiving Master Nathaniel time to answer, "life on a farm would do as\r\nwell--better, perhaps. Sowing and reaping, quiet days, smells and\r\nnoises that are like old tunes, healing nights ... slow-time gin! By\r\nthe Harvest of Souls, Master Nathaniel, I\'d rather any day, be a farmer\r\nthan a merchant ... waving corn is better than the sea, and waggons\r\nare better than ships, and freighted with sweeter and more wholesome\r\nmerchandise than all your silks and spices; for in their cargo are\r\npeace and a quiet mind. Yes. Master Ranulph must spend some months on a\r\nfarm, and I know the very place for him."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was more moved than he cared to show by the doctor\'s\r\nwords. They were like the cry of the cock, without its melancholy. But\r\nhe tried to make his voice dry and matter of fact, as he asked where\r\nthis marvellous farm might be.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s to the west," the doctor answered vaguely. "It belongs to\r\nan old acquaintance of mine--the widow Gibberty. She\'s a fine, fresh,\r\nbustling woman and knows everything a woman ought to know, and her\r\ngranddaughter, Hazel, is a nice, sensible, hard-working girl. I\'m\r\nsure...."\r\n\r\n"Gibberty, did you say?" interrupted Master Nathaniel. He seemed to\r\nhave heard the name before.\r\n\r\n"Yes. You may remember having heard her name in the law-courts--it\r\nisn\'t a common one. She had a case many years ago. I think it was a\r\nthieving labourer her late husband had thrashed and dismissed who sued\r\nher for damages."\r\n\r\n"And where exactly is this farm?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s about sixty miles away from Lud, just out of a village\r\ncalled Swan-on-the-Dapple."\r\n\r\n"Swan-on-the-Dapple? Then it\'s quite close to the Elfin Marches!" cried\r\nMaster Nathaniel indignantly.\r\n\r\n"About ten miles away," replied Endymion Leer imperturbably. "But\r\nwhat of that? Ten miles on a busy self-supporting farm is as great a\r\ndistance as a hundred would be at Lud. Still, under the circumstances,\r\nI can understand your fighting shy of the west. I must think of some\r\nother plan."\r\n\r\n"I should think so indeed!" growled Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n"However," continued the doctor, "you have really nothing to fear\r\nfrom that quarter. He would, in reality, be much further moved from\r\ntemptation there than here. The smugglers, whoever they are, run great\r\nrisks to get the fruit into Lud, and they\'re not going to waste it on\r\nrustics and farmhands."\r\n\r\n"All the same," said Master Nathaniel doggedly, "I\'m not going to have\r\nhim going so damnably near to ... a certain place."\r\n\r\n"The place that does not exist in the eyes of the law, eh?" said\r\nEndymion Leer with a smile.\r\n\r\nThen he leaned forward in his chair, and gazed steadily at Master\r\nNathaniel. This time, his eyes were kind as well as piercing. "Master\r\nNathaniel, I\'d like to reason with you a little," he said. "Reason I\r\nknow, is only a drug, and, as such, its effects are never permanent.\r\nBut, like the juice of the poppy, it often gives a temporary relief."\r\n\r\nHe sat silent for a few seconds, as if choosing in advance the words\r\nhe meant to use. Then he began, "We have the misfortune of living in\r\na country that marches with the unknown; and that is apt to make the\r\nfancy sick. Though we laugh at old songs and old yarns, nevertheless,\r\nthey are the yarn with which we weave our picture of the world."\r\n\r\nHe paused for a second to chuckle over his own pun, and then went on,\r\n"But, for once, let us look things straight in the face, and call them\r\nby their proper names. Fairyland, for instance ... no one has been\r\nthere within the memory of man. For generations it has been a forbidden\r\nland. In consequence, curiosity, ignorance, and unbridled fancy have\r\nput their heads together and concocted a country of golden trees\r\nhanging with pearls and rubies, the inhabitants of which are immortal\r\nand terrible through unearthly gifts--and so on. But--and in this I am\r\nin no way subscribing to a certain antiquary of ill odour--there is\r\nnot a single homely thing that, looked at from a certain angle, does\r\nnot become fairy. Think of the Dapple, or the Dawl, when they roll\r\nthe sunset towards the east. Think of an autumn wood, or a hawthorn\r\nin May. A hawthorn in May--there\'s a miracle for you! Who would ever\r\nhave dreamed that that gnarled stumpy old tree had the power to do\r\nthat? Well, all these things are familiar sights, but what should we\r\nthink if never having seen them we read a description of them, or saw\r\nthem for the first time? A golden river! Flaming trees! Trees that\r\nsuddenly break into flower! For all we know, it may be Dorimare that is\r\nFairyland to the people across the Debatable Hills."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was drinking in every word as if it was nectar. A\r\nsense of safety was tingling in his veins like a generous wine ...\r\nmounting to his head, even, a little bit, so unused was he to that\r\nparticular intoxicant.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer eyed him, with a little smile. "And now," he said,\r\n"perhaps your Worship will let me talk a little of your own case. The\r\nmalady you suffer from should, I think, be called \'life-sickness.\'\r\nYou are, so to speak, a bad sailor, and the motion of life makes you\r\nbrain-sick. There, beneath you, all round you, there surges and swells,\r\nand ebbs and flows, that great, ungovernable, ruthless element that we\r\ncall life. And its motion gets into your blood, turns your head dizzy.\r\nGet your sea legs, Master Nathaniel! By which I do not mean you must\r\ncease feeling the motion ... go on feeling it, but learn to like it; or\r\nif not to like it, at any rate to bear it with firm legs and a steady\r\nhead."\r\n\r\nThere were tears in Master Nathaniel\'s eyes and he smiled a little\r\nsheepishly. At that moment his feet were certainly on terra firma; and\r\nso convinced are we that each mood while it lasts will be the permanent\r\ntemper of our soul that for the moment he felt that he would never feel\r\n"life-sickness" again.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Leer, thank you," he murmured. "I\'d do a good deal for you,\r\nin return for what you\'ve just said."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said the doctor briskly, "give me the pleasure of\r\ncuring your son. It\'s the greatest pleasure I have in life, curing\r\npeople. Let me arrange for him to go to this farm."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, in his present mood, was incapable of gainsaying\r\nhim. So it was arranged that Ranulph should shortly leave for\r\nSwan-on-the-Dapple.\r\n\r\nIt was with a curious solemnity that, just before he took his leave,\r\nEndymion Leer said, "Master Nathaniel, there is one thing I want you to\r\nbear in mind--I have never in my life made a mistake in a prescription."\r\n\r\nAs Endymion Leer trotted away from the Chanticleers he chuckled to\r\nhimself and softly rubbed his hands. "I can\'t help being a physician\r\nand giving balm," he muttered. "But it was monstrous good policy as\r\nwell. He would never have allowed the boy to go, otherwise."\r\n\r\nThen he started, and stood stock-still, listening. From far away there\r\ncame a ghostly sound. It might have been the cry of a very distant\r\ncock, or else it might have been the sound of faint, mocking laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n               RANULPH GOES TO THE WIDOW GIBBERTY\'S FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Endymion Leer was right. Reason is only a drug, and its effects\r\ncannot be permanent. Master Nathaniel was soon suffering from\r\nlife-sickness as much as ever.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, there was no denying that in the voice of Endymion Leer\r\nsinging to Ranulph, he had once again heard the Note; and the fact\r\ntormented him, reason with himself as he might.\r\n\r\nBut it was not sufficient to make him distrust Endymion Leer--one might\r\nhear the Note, he was convinced, in the voices of the most innocent;\r\njust as the mocking cry of the cuckoo can rise from the nest of the\r\nlark or the hedge sparrow. But he was certainly not going to let him\r\ntake Ranulph away to that western farm.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the boy was longing, nay craving to go, for Endymion Leer, when\r\nhe had been left alone with him in the parlour that morning, had fired\r\nhis imagination with its delights.\r\n\r\nWhen Master Nathaniel questioned him as to what other things Endymion\r\nLeer had talked about, he said that he had asked him a great many\r\nquestions about the stranger in green he had seen dancing, and had made\r\nhim repeat to him several times what exactly he had said to him.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Ranulph, "he said he would sing me well and happy. And I\r\nwas just beginning to feel so wonderful, when you came bursting in,\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, my boy," said Master Nathaniel. "But why did you first of\r\nall scream so and beg not to be left alone with him?"\r\n\r\nRanulph wriggled and hung his head. "I suppose it was like the cheese,"\r\nhe said sheepishly. "But, father, I want to go to that farm. Please let\r\nme go."\r\n\r\nFor several weeks Master Nathaniel steadily refused his consent. He\r\nkept the boy with him as much as his business and his official duties\r\nwould permit, trying to find for him occupations and amusements that\r\nwould teach him a "different tune." For Endymion Leer\'s words, in spite\r\nof their having had so little effect on his spiritual condition, had\r\ngenuinely and permanently impressed him. However, he could not but see\r\nthat Ranulph was daily wilting and that his talk was steadily becoming\r\nmore fantastic; and he began to fear that his own objection to letting\r\nhim go to the farm sprang merely from a selfish desire to keep him with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHempie, oddly enough, was in favour of his going. The old woman\'s\r\nattitude to the whole affair was a curious one. Nothing would make her\r\nbelieve that it was not fairy fruit that Willy Wisp had given him. She\r\nsaid she had suspected it from the first, but to have mentioned it\r\nwould have done no good to anyone.\r\n\r\n"If it wasn\'t that what was it then?" she would ask scornfully. "For\r\nwhat is Willy Wisp himself? He left his place--and his wages not paid,\r\ntoo, during the twelve nights of Yule-tide. And when dog or servant\r\nleaves, sudden like, at that time, we all know what to think."\r\n\r\n"And what are we to think, Hempie?" enquired Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nAt first the old woman would only shake her head and look mysterious.\r\nBut finally she told him that it was believed in the country districts\r\nthat, should there be a fairy among the servants, he was bound to\r\nreturn to his own land on one of the twelve nights after the winter\r\nsolstice; and should there be among the dogs one that belonged to Duke\r\nAubrey\'s pack, during these nights he would howl and howl, till he was\r\nlet out of his kennel, and then vanish into the darkness and never be\r\nseen again.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel grunted with impatience.\r\n\r\n"Well, it was you dragged the words from my lips, and though you are\r\nthe Mayor and the Lord High Seneschal, you can\'t come lording it over\r\nmy thoughts ... I\'ve a right to them!" cried Hempie, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"My good Hempie, if you really believe the boy has eaten ... a certain\r\nthing, all I can say is you seem very cheerful about it," growled\r\nMaster Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n"And what good would it do my pulling a long face and looking like one\r\nof the old statues in the fields of Grammary I should like to know?"\r\nflashed back Hempie. And then she added, with a meaning nod, "Besides,\r\nwhatever happens, no harm can ever come to a Chanticleer. While Lud\r\nstands the Chanticleers will thrive. So come rough, come smooth, you\r\nwon\'t find me worrying. But if I was you, Master Nat, I\'d give the boy\r\nhis way. There\'s nothing like his own way for a sick person--be he\r\nchild or grown man. His own way to a sick man is what grass is to a\r\nsick dog."\r\n\r\nHempie\'s opinion influenced Master Nathaniel more than he would like to\r\nadmit; but it was a talk he had with Mumchance, the captain of the Lud\r\nYeomanry, that finally induced him to let Ranulph have his way.\r\n\r\nThe Yeomanry combined the duties of a garrison with those of a police\r\ncorps, and Master Nathaniel had charged their captain to try and find\r\nthe whereabouts of Willy Wisp.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the rogue was quite familiar to the Yeomanry, and\r\nMumchance confirmed what Endymion Leer had said about his having turned\r\nthe town upside down with his pranks during the few months he had\r\nbeen in Master Nathaniel\'s service. But since his disappearance at\r\nYule-tide, nothing had been seen or heard of him in Lud-in-the-Mist,\r\nand Mumchance could find no traces of him.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel fumed and grumbled a little at the inefficiency of\r\nthe Yeomanry; but, at the bottom of his heart he was relieved. He had\r\na lurking fear that Hempie was right and Endymion Leer was wrong,\r\nand that it had really been fairy fruit after all that Ranulph had\r\neaten. But it is best to let sleeping facts lie. And he feared that if\r\nconfronted with Willy Wisp the facts might wake up and begin to bite.\r\nBut what was this that Mumchance was telling him?\r\n\r\nIt would seem that during the past months there had been a marked\r\nincrease in the consumption of fairy fruit--in the low quarters of\r\ntown, of course.\r\n\r\n"It\'s got to be stopped, Mumchance, d\'ye hear?" cried Master Nathaniel\r\nhotly. "And what\'s more, the smugglers must be caught and clapped into\r\ngaol, every mother\'s son of them. This has gone on too long."\r\n\r\n"Yes, your Worship," said Mumchance stolidly, "it went on in the\r\ntime of my predecessor, if your Worship will pardon the expression"\r\n(Mumchance was very fond of using long words, but he had a feeling that\r\nit was presumption to use them before his betters), "and in the days\r\nof his predecessor ... and way back. And it\'s no good trying to be\r\nsmarter than our forebears. I sometimes think we might as well try and\r\ncatch the Dapple and clap it into prison as them smugglers. But these\r\nare sad times, your Worship, sad times--the \'prentices wanting to be\r\nmasters, and every little tradesman wanting to be a Senator, and every\r\ndirty little urchin thinking he can give impudence to his betters! You\r\nsee, your Worship, I sees and hears a good deal in my way of business,\r\nif you\'ll pardon the expression ... but the things one\'s eyes and ears\r\ntells one, they ain\'t in words, so to speak, and it\'s not easy to tell\r\nother folks what they say ... no more than the geese can tell you how\r\nthey know it\'s going to rain," and he laughed apologetically. "But I\r\nshouldn\'t be surprised--no, I shouldn\'t, if there wasn\'t something\r\nbrewing."\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Mumchance, don\'t speak in riddles!" cried\r\nMaster Nathaniel irritably. "What d\'ye mean?"\r\n\r\nMumchance shifted uneasily from one foot to the other: "Well, your\r\nWorship," he began, "it\'s this way. Folks are beginning to take a\r\nwonderful interest in Duke Aubrey again. Why, all the girls are wearing\r\nbits of tawdry jewelry with his picture, and bits of imitation ivy and\r\nsquills stuck in their bonnets, and there ain\'t a poor street in this\r\ntown where all the cockatoos that the sailors bring don\'t squawk at you\r\nfrom their cages that the Duke will come to his own again ... or some\r\nsuch rubbish, and...."\r\n\r\n"My good Mumchance!" cried Master Nathaniel, impatiently, "Duke Aubrey\r\nwas a rascally sovereign who died more than two hundred years ago. You\r\ndon\'t believe he\'s going to come to life again, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that he will, your Worship," answered Mumchance evasively.\r\n"But all I know is that when Lud begins talking about him, it generally\r\nbodes trouble. I remember how old Tripsand, he who was Captain of the\r\nYeomanry when I was a little lad, used always to say that there was a\r\ndeal of that sort of talk before the great drought."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlesticks!" cried Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nMumchance\'s theories about Duke Aubrey he immediately dismissed from\r\nhis mind. But he was very much disturbed by what he had said about\r\nfairy fruit, and began to think that Endymion Leer had been right\r\nin maintaining that Ranulph would be further from temptation at\r\nSwan-on-the-Dapple than in Lud.\r\n\r\nHe had another interview with Leer, and the long and short of it was\r\nthat it was decided that as soon as Dame Marigold and Hempie could get\r\nRanulph ready he should set out for the widow Gibberty\'s farm. Endymion\r\nLeer said that he wanted to look for herbs in the neighbourhood, and\r\nwould be very willing to escort him there.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, of course, would much have preferred to have gone\r\nwith him himself; but it was against the law for the Mayor to leave\r\nLud, except on circuit. In his stead, he decided to send Luke Hempen,\r\nold Hempie\'s grand-nephew. He was a lad of about twenty, who worked in\r\nthe garden and had always been the faithful slave of Ranulph.\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful sunny morning, about a week later, Endymion Leer came\r\nriding up to the Chanticleers\' to fetch Ranulph, who was impatiently\r\nawaiting him, booted and spurred, and looking more like his old self\r\nthan he had done for months.\r\n\r\nBefore Ranulph mounted, Master Nathaniel, blinking away a tear or two,\r\nkissed him on the forehead and whispered, "The black rooks will fly\r\naway, my son, and you\'ll come back as brown as a berry, and as merry as\r\na grig. And if you want me, just send a word by Luke, and I\'ll be with\r\nyou as fast as horses can gallop--law or no law." And from her latticed\r\nwindow at the top of the house appeared the head and shoulders of old\r\nHempie in her nightcap, shaking her fist, and crying, "Now then, young\r\nLuke, if you don\'t take care of my boy--you\'ll catch it!"\r\n\r\nMany a curious glance was cast at the little cavalcade as they trotted\r\ndown the cobbled streets. Miss Lettice and Miss Rosie Prim, the two\r\nbuxom daughters of the leading watchmaker who were returning from their\r\nmarketing considered that Ranulph looked sweetly pretty on horseback.\r\n"Though," added Miss Rosie, "they do say he\'s a bit ... queer, and it\r\nis a pity, I must say, that he\'s got the Mayor\'s ginger hair."\r\n\r\n"Well, Rosie," retorted Miss Lettice, "at least he doesn\'t cover it up\r\nwith a black wig, like a certain apprentice I know!"\r\n\r\nAnd Rosie laughed, and tossed her head.\r\n\r\nA great many women, as they watched them pass, called down blessings\r\non the head of Endymion Leer; adding that it was a pity that he was\r\nnot Mayor and High Seneschal. And several rough-looking men scowled\r\nominously at Ranulph. But Mother Tibbs, the half-crazy old washerwoman,\r\nwho, in spite of her forty summers danced more lightly than any maiden,\r\nand was, in consequence, in great request as a partner at those tavern\r\ndances that played so great a part in the life of the masses in\r\nLud-in-the-Mist--crazy, disreputable, Mother Tibbs, with her strangely\r\nnoble innocent face, tossed him a nosegay and cried in her sing-song\r\npenetrating voice, "Cockadoodle doo! Cockadoodle doo! The little\r\nmaster\'s bound for the land where the eggs are all gold!"\r\n\r\nBut no one ever paid any attention to what Mother Tibbs might say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing worth mentioning occurred during their journey to Swan; except\r\nthe endless pleasant things of the country in summer. There were beech\r\nspinneys, wading up steep banks through their own dead leaves; fields\r\nall blurred with meadow-sweet and sorrel; brown old women screaming at\r\ntheir goats; acacias in full flower, and willows blown by the wind into\r\nwhite blossom.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, terrestrial comets--the blue flash of a kingfisher,\r\nthe red whisk of a fox--would furrow and thrill the surface of the\r\nearth with beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd in the distance, here and there, standing motionless and in\r\ncomplete silence by the flowing Dapple, were red-roofed villages--the\r\nleast vain of all fair things, for they never looked at their own\r\nreflection in the water, but gazed unblinkingly at the horizon.\r\n\r\nAnd there were ruined castles covered with ivy--the badge of the old\r\norder, clinging to its own; and into the ivy doves dived, seeming\r\nto leave in their wake a trail of amethyst, just as a clump of\r\nbottle-green leaves is shot with purple by the knowledge that it hides\r\nviolets. And the round towers of the castles looked as if they were so\r\nfirmly encrusted in the sky that, to get to their other side, one would\r\nhave to hew out a passage through the celestial marble.\r\n\r\nAnd the sun would set, and then our riders could watch the actual\r\nprocess of colour fading from the world. Was that tree still really\r\ngreen, or was it only that they were remembering how a few seconds ago\r\nit had been green?\r\n\r\nAnd the nymph whom all travellers pursue and none has ever yet\r\ncaught--the white high-road, glimmered and beckoned to them through the\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\nAll these things, however, were familiar sights to any Ludite. But\r\non the third day (for Ranulph\'s sake they were taking the journey in\r\neasy stages) things began to look different--especially the trees;\r\nfor instead of acacias, beeches, and willows--familiar living things\r\nfor ever murmuring their secret to themselves--there were pines and\r\nliege-oaks and olives. Inanimate works of art they seemed at first and\r\nRanulph exclaimed, "Oh, look at the funny trees! They are like the old\r\nstatues of dead people in the Fields of Grammary!"\r\n\r\nBut, as well, they were like an old written tragedy. For if human, or\r\nsuperhuman, experience, and the tragic clash of personality can be\r\nexpressed by plastic shapes, then one might half believe that these\r\ntortured trees had been bent by the wind into the spiritual shape of\r\nsome old drama.\r\n\r\nPines and olives, however, cannot grow far away from the sea. And\r\nsurely the sea lay to the east of Lud-in-the-Mist, and with each mile\r\nthey were getting further away from it? It was the sea beyond the Hills\r\nof the Elfin Marches--the invisible sea of Fairyland--that caused these\r\npines and olives to flourish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when they reached the village of\r\nSwan-on-the-Dapple--a score of houses straggling round a triangle of\r\nunreclaimed common, on which grew olives and stunted fruit trees, and\r\nwhich was used as the village rubbish heap. In the distance were the\r\nlow, pine-covered undulations of the Debatable Hills--a fine unchanging\r\nbackground for the changing colours of the seasons. Indeed, they lent a\r\ndignity and significance to everything that grew, lay, or was enacted,\r\nagainst them; so that the little children in their blue smocks who were\r\nplaying among the rubbish on the dingy common as our cavalcade rode\r\npast, seemed to be performing against the background of Destiny some\r\ntremendous action, similar to the one expressed by the shapes of the\r\npines and olives.\r\n\r\nWhen they had left the village, they took a cart-track that branched\r\noff from the high-road to the right. It led into a valley, the gently\r\nsloping sides of which were covered with vineyards and corn-fields.\r\nSometimes their path led through a little wood of liege-oaks with\r\ntrunks, where the bark had been stripped, showing as red as blood, and\r\neverywhere there were short, wiry, aromatic shrubs, beset by myriads of\r\nbees.\r\n\r\nEvery minute the hills seemed to be drawing nearer, and the pines with\r\nwhich they were covered began to stand out from the carpet of heath in\r\na sort of coagulated relief, so that they looked like a thick green\r\nscum of watercress on a stagnant purple pond.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached the farm--a fine old manor-house, standing among\r\na cluster of red-roofed barns, and supported, heraldically, on either\r\nside by two magnificent plane-trees, with dappled trunks of tremendous\r\ngirth.\r\n\r\nThey were greeted by the barking of five or six dogs, and this brought\r\nthe widow hurrying out accompanied by a pretty girl of about seventeen\r\nwhom she introduced as her granddaughter Hazel.\r\n\r\nThough she must have been at least sixty by then, the widow Gibberty\r\nwas still a strikingly handsome woman--tall, imposing-looking, and with\r\nhair that must once have had as many shades of red and brown as a bed\r\nof wallflowers smouldering in the sun.\r\n\r\nThen a couple of men came up and led away the horses, and the\r\ntravellers were taken up to their rooms.\r\n\r\nAs befitted the son of the High Seneschal, the one given to Ranulph was\r\nevidently the best. It was large and beautifully proportioned, and in\r\nspite of its homely chintzes and the plain furniture of a farm-house,\r\nin spite even of the dried rushes laid on the floor instead of a\r\ncarpet, it bore unmistakable traces of the ancient magnificence when\r\nthe house had belonged to nobles instead of farmers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the ceiling was a fine specimen of the flat enamelled\r\nceilings that belonged to the Duke Aubrey period in domestic\r\narchitecture. There was just such a ceiling in Dame Marigold\'s bedroom\r\nin Lud. She had stared up at it when in travail with Ranulph--just\r\nas all the mothers of the Chanticleers had done in the same\r\ncircumstances--and its colours and pattern had become inextricably\r\nconfused with her pain and delirium.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer was put next to Ranulph, and Luke was given a large\r\npleasant room in the attic.\r\n\r\nRanulph was not in the least tired by his long ride, he said. His\r\ncheeks were flushed, his eyes bright, and when the widow had left him\r\nalone with Luke, he gave two or three skips of glee, and cried, "I do\r\nlove this place, Luke." At six o\'clock a loud bell was rung outside\r\nthe house, presumably to summon the labourers to supper; and, as the\r\nwidow had told them it would be in the kitchen, Ranulph and Luke, both\r\nfeeling very hungry, went hurrying down.\r\n\r\nIt was an enormous kitchen, running the whole length of the house;\r\nin the olden days it had been the banqueting hall. It was solidly\r\nstone-vaulted, and the great chimney place was also of stone, and\r\ndecorated in high relief with the skulls and flowers and arabesques\r\nof leaves ubiquitous in the art of Dorimare. It was flanked by giant\r\nfire-dogs of copper. The floor was tiled with a mosaic of brown and red\r\nand grey-blue flag-stones.\r\n\r\nDown the centre of the room ran a long narrow table laid with pewter\r\nplates and mugs, for the labourers and maid servants who came flocking\r\nin, their faces shining from recent soap and scrubbing, and stood about\r\nin groups at the lower end of the room, grinning and bashful from the\r\npresence of company. According to the good old yeoman custom they had\r\ntheir meals with their masters.\r\n\r\nIt was a most delicious supper--a great ham with the aromatic flavour\r\nof wood-smoke, eaten with pickled cowslips; brawn; a red-deer pie;\r\nand, in honour of the distinguished guests, a fat roast swan. The\r\nwine was from the widow\'s own grapes and was flavoured with honey and\r\nblackberries.\r\n\r\nMost of the talking was done by the widow and Endymion Leer. He was\r\nasking her if many trout had been caught that summer in the Dapple, and\r\nwhat were their markings. And she told him that a salmon had recently\r\nbeen landed weighing ten pounds.\r\n\r\nRanulph, who had been munching away in silence, suddenly looked up at\r\nthem, with that little smile of his that people always found a trifle\r\ndisconcerting.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t real talk," he said. "That isn\'t the way you really talk to\r\neach other. That\'s only pretence talk." The widow looked very surprised\r\nand very much annoyed. But Endymion Leer laughed heartily and asked him\r\nwhat he meant by "real talk;" Ranulph, however, would not be drawn.\r\n\r\nBut Luke Hempen, in a dim inarticulate way, understood what he meant.\r\nThe conversation between the widow and the doctor had not rung true;\r\nit was almost as if their words had a double meaning known only to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, a wizened old man with very bright eyes came into\r\nthe room and sat down at the lower end of the table. And then Ranulph\r\nreally did give everyone a fright, for he stopped eating, and for a few\r\nseconds stared at him in silence. Then he gave a piercing scream.\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned toward him in amazement. But he sat as if petrified,\r\nhis eyes round and staring, pointing at the old man. "Come, come, young\r\nfellow!" cried Endymion Leer, sharply; "what\'s the meaning of this?"\r\n\r\n"What ails you, little master?" cried the widow.\r\n\r\nBut he continued pointing in silence at the old man, who was leering\r\nand smirking and ogling, in evident delight at being the centre of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"He\'s scared by Portunus, the weaver," tittered the maids.\r\n\r\nAnd the words "Portunus," "old Portunus the weaver," were bandied from\r\nmouth to mouth down the two sides of the table.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Portunus, the weaver," cried the widow, in a loud voice, a hint\r\nof menace in her eye. "And who, I should like to know, does not love\r\nPortunus, the weaver?"\r\n\r\nThe maids hung their heads, the men sniggered deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"Well?" challenged the widow.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"And who," she continued indignantly, "is the handiest most obliging\r\nfellow to be found within twenty miles?"\r\n\r\nShe glared down the table, and then repeated her question.\r\n\r\nAs if compelled by her eye, the company murmured "Portunus."\r\n\r\n"And if the cheeses won\'t curdle, or the butter won\'t come, or the wine\r\nin the vats won\'t get a good head, who comes to the rescue?"\r\n\r\n"Portunus," murmured the company.\r\n\r\n"And who is always ready to lend a helping hand to the maids--to break\r\nor bolt hemp, to dress flax, or to spin? And when their work is over to\r\nplay them tunes on his fiddle?"\r\n\r\n"Portunus," murmured the company.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hazel raised her eyes from her plate and they were sparkling\r\nwith defiance and anger.\r\n\r\n"And who," she cried shrilly, "sits by the fire when he thinks no one\r\nis watching him roasting little live frogs and eating them? Portunus."\r\n\r\nWith each word her voice rose higher, like a soaring bird. But at\r\nthe last word it was as if the bird when it had reached the ceiling\r\nsuddenly fell down dead. And Luke saw her flinch under the cold\r\nindignant stare of the widow.\r\n\r\nAnd he had noticed something else as well.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in Dorimare, in the houses of the yeomanry and the\r\npeasantry, to hang a bunch of dried fennel over the door of every room;\r\nfor fennel was supposed to have the power of keeping the Fairies. And\r\nwhen Ranulph had given his eerie scream, Luke had, as instinctively as\r\nin similar circumstances a mediaeval papist would have made the sign of\r\nthe Cross, glanced towards the door to catch a reassuring glimpse of\r\nthe familiar herb.\r\n\r\nBut there was no fennel hanging over the door of the widow Gibberty.\r\n\r\nThe men grinned, the maids tittered at Hazel\'s outburst; and then there\r\nwas an awkward silence.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Ranulph seemed to have recovered from his fright and\r\nwas going on stolidly with his supper, while the widow was saying to\r\nhim reassuringly, "Mark my words, little master, you\'ll get to love\r\nPortunus as much as we all do. Trust Portunus for knowing where the\r\ntrout rise and where all the birds\' nests are to be found ... eh,\r\nPortunus?"\r\n\r\nAnd Portunus chuckled with delight and his bright eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n"Why," the widow continued, "I have known him these twenty years. He\'s\r\nthe weaver in these parts, and goes the round from farm to farm, and\r\nthe room with the loom is always called \'Portunus\' Parlour.\' And there\r\nisn\'t a wedding or a merry-making within twenty miles where he doesn\'t\r\nplay the fiddle."\r\n\r\nLuke, whose perceptions owing to the fright he had just had were\r\nunusually alert, noticed that Endymion Leer was very silent, and that\r\nhis face as he watched Ranulph was puzzled and a little anxious.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was over the maids and labourers vanished, and so did\r\nPortunus; but the three guests sat on, listening to the pleasant whirr\r\nof the widow\'s and Hazel\'s spinning-wheels, saying but little, for the\r\nlong day in the open air had made all three of them sleepy.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock a little scrabbling noise was heard at the door.\r\n"That\'s the children," said Hazel, and she went and opened it, upon\r\nwhich three or four little boys came bashfully in from the dusk.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, my lads," said the widow, genially. "Come for your bread\r\nand cheese ... eh?"\r\n\r\nThe children grinned and hung their heads, abashed by the sight of\r\nthree strangers.\r\n\r\n"The little lads of the village, Master Chanticleer, take it in turn to\r\nwatch our cattle all night," said the widow to Ranulph. "We keep them\r\nsome miles away along the valley where there is good pasturage, and the\r\nherdsman likes to come back to his own home at night."\r\n\r\n"And these little boys are going to be out all night?" asked Ranulph in\r\nan awed voice.\r\n\r\n"That they are! And a fine time they\'ll have of it too. They build\r\nthemselves little huts out of branches and light fires in them. Oh,\r\nthey enjoy themselves."\r\n\r\nThe children grinned from ear to ear; and when Hazel had provided each\r\nof them with some bread and cheese they scuttled off into the gathering\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to go some night, too," said Ranulph.\r\n\r\nThe widow was beginning to expostulate against the idea of young Master\r\nChanticleer\'s spending the night out of doors with cows and village\r\nchildren, when Endymion Leer said, decidedly, "That\'s all nonsense! I\r\ndon\'t want my patient coddled ... eh! Ranulph? I see no reason why he\r\nshouldn\'t go some night if it amuses him. But wait till the nights are\r\nwarmer."\r\n\r\nHe paused just a second, and added, "towards Midsummer, let us say."\r\n\r\nThey sat on a little longer; saying but little, yawning a great deal.\r\nAnd then the widow suggested that they should all go off to bed.\r\n\r\nThere were home-made tallow candles provided for everyone, except\r\nRanulph, whose social importance was emphasised by a wax one from Lud.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer lit it for him, and then held it at arm\'s length and\r\ncontemplated its flame, his head on one side, eyes twinkling.\r\n\r\n"Thrice blessed little herb!" he began in a whimsical voice. "Herb o\'\r\ngrease, with thy waxen stem and blossom of flame! Thou art more potent\r\nagainst spells and terrors and the invisible menace than fennel or\r\ndittany or rue. Hail! antidote to the deadly nightshade! Blossoming in\r\nthe darkness, thy virtues are heartsease and quiet sleep. Sick people\r\nbless thee, and women in travail, and people with haunted minds, and\r\nall children."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a buffoon, Leer," said the widow roughly; in quite a\r\ndifferent voice from the one of bluff courtesy in which she had\r\nhitherto addressed him. To an acute observer it would have suggested\r\nthat they were in reality more intimate than they cared to show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Luke Hempen had difficulty in getting\r\noff to sleep.\r\n\r\nHis great-aunt had dinned into him for the past week, with many a\r\nmenacing shake of her old fist, that should anything happen to Master\r\nRanulph she would hold him, Luke, responsible, and even before leaving\r\nLud the honest, but by no means heroic, lad, had been in somewhat of a\r\npanic; and the various odd little incidents that had taken place that\r\nevening were not of a nature to reassure him.\r\n\r\nFinally he could stand it no longer. So up he got, lit his candle, and\r\ncrept down the attic stairs and along the corridor to Ranulph\'s room.\r\n\r\nRanulph, too, was wide awake. He had not put out his candle, and was\r\nlying staring up at the fantastic ceiling.\r\n\r\n"What do you want, Luke?" he cried peevishly. "Why won\'t anyone ever\r\nleave me alone?"\r\n\r\n"I was just wondering if you were all right, sir," said Luke\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n"Of course I am. Why shouldn\'t I be?" and Ranulph gave an impatient\r\nlittle plunge in his bed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I was just wondering, you know."\r\n\r\nLuke paused; and then said imploringly, "Please, Master Ranulph, be a\r\ngood chap and tell me what took you at supper time when that doitered\r\nold weaver came in. You gave me quite a turn, screaming like that."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Luke! Wouldn\'t you like to know!" teased Ranulph.\r\n\r\nFinally he admitted that when he had been a small child he had\r\nfrequently seen Portunus in his dreams, "And that\'s rather frightening,\r\nyou know, Luke."\r\n\r\nLuke, much relieved, admitted that he supposed it was. He himself was\r\nnot given to dreaming; nor did he take seriously the dreams of others.\r\n\r\nRanulph noticed his relief; and rather an impish expression stole into\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"But there\'s something else, Luke," he said. "Old Portunus, you know,\r\nis a dead man."\r\n\r\nThis time Luke was really alarmed. Was his charge going off his head?\r\n\r\n"Get along with you, Master Ranulph!" he cried, in a voice that he\r\ntried to make jocose.\r\n\r\n"All right, Luke, you needn\'t believe it unless you like," said\r\nRanulph. "Good night, I\'m off to sleep."\r\n\r\nAnd he blew out his candle and turned his back on Luke, who, thus\r\ndismissed, must needs return to his own bed, where he soon fell fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                  THE WIND IN THE CRABAPPLE BLOSSOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, Mistress Hempen received the following letter from\r\nLuke:\r\n\r\n    Dear Auntie,--\r\n\r\n    I trust this finds you as well as it leaves me. I\'m remembering\r\n    what you said, and trying to look after the little master, but this\r\n    is a queer place and no mistake, and I\'d liefer we were both safe\r\n    back in Lud. Not that I\'ve any complaint to make as to victuals and\r\n    lodging, and I\'m sure they treat Master Ranulph as if he was a\r\n    king--wax candles and linen sheets and everything that he gets at\r\n    home. And I must say I\'ve not seen him looking so well, nor so\r\n    happy for many a long day. But the widow woman she\'s a rum customer\r\n    and no mistake, and wonderful fond of fishing, for a female. She\r\n    and the doctor are out all night sometimes together after trout,\r\n    but never a trout do we see on the table. And sometimes she looks\r\n    so queerly at Master Ranulph that it fairly makes my flesh creep.\r\n    And there\'s no love lost between her and her granddaughter, her\r\n    step-granddaughter I should say, her who\'s called Miss Hazel, and\r\n    they say as what by the old farmer\'s will the farm belongs to her\r\n    and not to the widow. And she\'s a stuck-up young miss, very high\r\n    and keeping herself to herself. But I\'m glad she\'s in the house all\r\n    the same, for she\'s well liked by all the folk on the farm and I\'d\r\n    take my oath that though she\'s high she\'s straight. And there\'s a\r\n    daft old man that they call Portunus and it\'s more like having a\r\n    tame magpie in the house than a human man, for he can\'t talk a\r\n    word of sense, it\'s all scraps of rhyme, and he\'s always up to\r\n    mischief. He\'s a weaver and as cracked as Mother Tibbs, though\r\n    he do play the fiddle beautiful. And it\'s my belief the widow walks\r\n    in fear of her life for that old man, though why she should beats\r\n    me to know. For the old fellow\'s harmless enough, though a bit\r\n    spiteful at times. He sometimes pinches the maids till their arms\r\n    are as many colours as a mackerel\'s back. And he seems sweet on\r\n    Miss Hazel though she can\'t abear him, though when I ask her about\r\n    him she snaps my head off and tells me to mind my own business. And\r\n    I\'m afraid the folk on the farm must think me a bit high myself\r\n    through me minding what you told me and keeping myself to myself.\r\n    Because it\'s my belief if I\'d been a bit more friendly at the\r\n    beginning (such as it\'s my nature to be) I\'d have found out a thing\r\n    or two. And that cracked old weaver seems quite smitten by an old\r\n    stone statue in the orchard. He\'s always cutting capers in front of\r\n    it, and pulling faces at it, like a clown at the fair. But the\r\n    widow\'s scared of him, as sure as my name\'s Luke Hempen. And Master\r\n    Ranulph does talk so queer about him--things as I wouldn\'t demean\r\n    myself to write to an old lady. And I\'d be very glad, auntie, if\r\n    you\'d ask his Worship to send for us back, because I don\'t like\r\n    this place, and that\'s a fact, and not so much as a sprig of fennel\r\n    do they put above their doors.--And I am, Your dutiful\r\n    grand-nephew,\r\n\r\n                                                           LUKE HEMPEN.\r\n\r\nHempie read it through with many a frown and shake of her head,\r\nand with an occasional snort of contempt; as, for instance, where\r\nLuke intimated that the widow\'s linen sheets were as fine as the\r\nChanticleers\'.\r\n\r\nThen she sat for a few minutes in deep thought.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she finally said to herself, "my boy\'s well and happy and\r\nthat\'s more than he was in Lud, these last few months. What must be\r\nmust be, and it\'s never any use worrying Master Nat."\r\n\r\nSo she did not show Master Nathaniel Luke Hempen\'s letter.\r\n\r\nAs for Master Nathaniel, he was enchanted by the accounts he received\r\nfrom Endymion Leer of the improvement both in Ranulph\'s health and\r\nstate of mind. Ranulph himself too wrote little letters saying how\r\nhappy he was and how anxious to stay on at the farm. It was evident\r\nthat, to use the words of Endymion Leer, he was learning to live life\r\nto a different tune.\r\n\r\nAnd then Endymion Leer returned to Lud and confirmed what he had said\r\nin his letters by his accounts of how well and happy Ranulph was in the\r\nlife of a farm.\r\n\r\nThe summer was simmering comfortably by, in its usual sleepy way, in\r\nthe streets and gardens of Lud-in-the-Mist. The wives of Senators and\r\nburgesses were busy in still-room and kitchen making cordials and jams;\r\nin the evening the streets were lively with chattering voices and the\r\nsounds of music, and \'prentices danced with their masters\' daughters\r\nin the public square, or outside taverns, till the grey twilight began\r\nto turn black. The Senators yawned their way through each other\'s\r\nspeeches, and made their own as short as possible that they might\r\nhurry off to whip the Dapple for trout or play at bowls on the Guild\r\nHall\'s beautiful velvety green. And when one of their ships brought\r\nin a particularly choice cargo of rare wine or exotic sweetmeats they\r\ninvited their friends to supper, and washed down the dainties with the\r\ngood old jokes.\r\n\r\nMumchance looked glum, and would sometimes frighten his wife by gloomy\r\nforebodings; but he had learned that it was no use trying to arouse the\r\nMayor and the Senate.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was missing Ranulph very much; but as he continued to\r\nget highly satisfactory reports of his health he felt that it would be\r\nselfish not to let him stay on, at any rate till the summer was over.\r\n\r\nThen the trees, after their long silence, began to talk again, in\r\nyellow and red. And the days began to shrink under one\'s very eyes. And\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s pleached alley was growing yellower and yellower,\r\nand on the days when a thick white mist came rolling up from the Dapple\r\nit would be the only object in his garden that was not blurred and\r\ndimmed, and would look like a pair of gigantic golden compasses with\r\nwhich a demiurge is measuring chaos.\r\n\r\nIt was then that things began to happen; moreover, they began at the\r\nleast likely place in the whole of Lud-in-the-Mist--Miss Primrose\r\nCrabapple\'s Academy for young ladies.\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose Crabapple had for some twenty years "finished" the\r\ndaughters of the leading citizens; teaching them to sing, to dance,\r\nto play the spinet and the harp, to preserve and candy fruit, to wash\r\ngauzes and lace, to bone chickens without cutting the back, to model\r\ngroups of still life in every imaginable plastic material, edible and\r\nnon-edible--wax, butter, sugar--and to embroider in at least a hundred\r\ndifferent stitches--preparing them, in fact, to be one day useful and\r\naccomplished wives.\r\n\r\nWhen Dame Marigold Chanticleer and her contemporaries had first been\r\npupils at the Academy, Miss Primrose had only been a young assistant\r\ngoverness, very sentimental and affected, and full of nonsensical\r\nideas. But nonsensical ideas and great practical gifts are sometimes\r\nfound side by side, and sentimentality is a quality that rarely has the\r\nslightest influence on action.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the ridiculous gushing assistant managed bit by bit to get the\r\nwhole direction of the establishment into her own hands, while the old\r\ndame to whom the school belonged became as plastic to her will as were\r\nbutter, sugar or wax to her clever fingers; and when the old lady died\r\nshe left her the school.\r\n\r\nIt was an old rambling red-brick house with a large pleasant garden,\r\nand stood a little back from the high-road, about half a mile beyond\r\nthe west gate of Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nThe Academy represented to the ladies of Lud all that they knew of\r\nromance. They remembered the jokes they had laughed at within its\r\nwalls, the secrets they had exchanged walking up and down its pleached\r\nalleys, far more vividly than anything that had afterwards happened to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDo not for a moment imagine that they were sentimental about it. The\r\nladies of Lud were never sentimental. It was as an old comic song that\r\nthey remembered their school-days. Perhaps it is always with a touch\r\nof wistfulness that we remember old comic songs. It was at any rate\r\nas near as the ladies of Lud could get to the poetry of the past. And\r\nwhenever Dame Marigold Chanticleer and Dame Dreamsweet Vigil and the\r\nrest of the old pupils of the Academy foregathered to eat syllabub and\r\nmarzipan and exchange new stitches for their samplers, they would be\r\nsure sooner or later to start bandying memories about these funny old\r\ndays and the ridiculous doings of Miss Primrose Crabapple.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you remember," Dame Marigold would cry, "how she wanted to\r\nstart what she called a \'Mother\'s Day\', when we were all to dress up\r\nin white and green, and pretend to be lilies standing on our mothers\'\r\ngraves?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" Dame Dreamsweet would gurgle, "And mother was so angry when\r\nshe found out about it. \'How dare the ghoulish creature bury me alive\r\nlike this?\' she used to say."\r\n\r\nAnd then they would laugh till the tears ran down their cheeks.\r\n\r\nEach generation had its own jokes and its own secrets; but they were\r\nalways on the same pattern; just as when one of the china cups got\r\nbroken, it was replaced by another exactly like it, with the same\r\npainted border of squills and ivy.\r\n\r\nThere were squills and ivy all over the Academy, embroidered on the\r\ncurtains in each bedroom, and on all the cushions and screens, painted\r\nin a frieze around the wall of the parlour, and even stamped on the\r\npats of butter. For one of Miss Primrose Crabapple\'s follies was a\r\nromantic passion for Duke Aubrey--a passion similar to that cherished\r\nby highchurch spinsters of the last century for the memory of Charles\r\nI. Over her bed hung a little reproduction in water-colours of his\r\nportrait in the Guildhall. And on the anniversary of his fall, which\r\nwas kept in Dorimare as a holiday, she always appeared in deep mourning.\r\n\r\nShe knew perfectly well that she was an object of ridicule to her\r\npupils and their mothers. But her manner to them was not a whit less\r\ngushing in consequence; for she was much too practical to allow her\r\nfeelings to interfere with her bread and butter.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the occasions when her temper got the better of her\r\nprudence she would show them clearly her contempt for their pedigree,\r\nsneering at them as commercial upstarts and interlopers. She seemed\r\nto forget that she herself was only the daughter of a Lud grocer, and\r\nat times to imagine that the Crabapples had belonged to the vanished\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nShe was grotesque, too, in appearance, with a round moon face, tiny\r\neyes, and an enormous mouth that was generally stretched into an\r\ningratiating smile. She always wore a green turban and gown cut in\r\nthe style of the days of Duke Aubrey. Sitting in her garden among her\r\npretty little pupils she was like a brightly-painted Aunt Sally, placed\r\nthere by a gardener with a taste for the baroque to frighten away the\r\nbirds from his cherries and greengages.\r\n\r\nThough it was flowers that her pupils resembled more than\r\nfruit--sweetpeas, perhaps, when fragrant, gay, and demure, in muslin\r\nfrocks cut to a pattern, but in various colours, and in little\r\npoke-bonnets with white frills, they took their walk, two and two,\r\nthrough the streets of Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nAt any rate it was something sweet and fresh that they suggested, and\r\nin the town they were always known as the "Crabapple Blossoms."\r\n\r\nRecently they had been in a state of gleeful ecstasy. They had reason\r\nto believe that Miss Primrose was being courted, and by no less a\r\nperson than Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\nHe was the school physician, and hence to them all a familiar figure.\r\nBut, until quite lately, Miss Primrose had been a frequent victim of\r\nhis relentless tongue, and many a time a little patient had been forced\r\nto stuff the sheet into her mouth to stifle her laughter, so quaint and\r\npungent were the snubs he administered to their unfortunate schoolmarm.\r\n\r\nBut nearly every evening this summer his familiar cane and bottle-green\r\nhat had been seen in the hall. And his visits they had learned from the\r\nservants were not professional; unless it be part of a doctor\'s duties\r\nto drop in of an evening to play a game of cribbage with his patients,\r\nand sample their cakes and cowslip wine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, never before had Miss Primrose appeared so frequently in new\r\ngowns.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she\'s preparing her bridal chest!" tittered Prunella\r\nChanticleer. And the very idea sent them all into convulsions of mirth.\r\n\r\n"But do you really think he\'ll marry her? How could he!" said\r\nPenstemmon Fliperarde. "She\'s such an old fright, and such an old\r\ngoose, too. And they say he\'s so clever."\r\n\r\n"Why, then they\'ll be the goose and the sage!" laughed Prunella.\r\n\r\n"I expect he wants her savings," said Viola Vigil, with a wise little\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n"Or perhaps he wants to add her to his collection of antiques,"\r\ntittered Ambrosine Pyepowders.\r\n\r\n"Or to stick her up like an old sign over his dispensary!" suggested\r\nPrunella Chanticleer.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s hard on Duke Aubrey," laughed Moonlove Honeysuckle, "to be\r\ncut out like this by a snuffy old doctor."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Viola Vigil. "My father says it\'s a great pity she doesn\'t\r\ntake rooms in the Duke Aubrey\'s Arms, because," and Viola giggled and\r\nblushed a little, "it would be as near as she\'d ever get to his arms,\r\nor to anybody else\'s!"\r\n\r\nBut the laughter that greeted this last sally was just a trifle\r\nshame-faced; for the Crabapple Blossoms found it a little too daring.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of autumn, Miss Primrose suddenly sent all the\r\nservants back to their homes in distant villages; and, to the\r\nindignation of the Crabapple Blossoms, their places were filled (only\r\ntemporarily, Miss Primrose maintained) by the crazy washerwoman,\r\nMother Tibbs, and a handsome, painted, deaf-mute, with bold black eyes.\r\nMother Tibbs made but an indifferent housemaid, for she spent most of\r\nher time at the garden gate, waving her handkerchief to the passers-by.\r\nAnd if, when at her work, she heard the sound of a fiddle or flute,\r\nhowever distant, she would instantly stop whatever she was doing and\r\nstart dancing, brandishing wildly in the air broom, or warming-pan, or\r\nwhatever domestic implement she may have been holding in her hands at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nAs for the deaf-mute--she was quite a good cook, but was, perhaps,\r\nscarcely suited to employment in a young ladies\' academy, as she was\r\nknown in the town as "Bawdy Bess."\r\n\r\nOne morning Miss Primrose announced that she had found them a new\r\ndancing master (the last one had been suddenly dismissed, no one knew\r\nfor what reason), and that when they had finished their seams they were\r\nto come up to the loft for a lesson.\r\n\r\nSo they tripped up to the cool, dark, pleasant loft, which smelt of\r\napples, and had bunches of drying grapes suspended from its rafters.\r\nLong ago the Academy had been a farm-house, and on the loft\'s oak\r\npanelled walls were carved the interlaced initials of many rustic\r\nlovers, dead hundreds of years ago. To these Prunella Chanticleer\r\nand Moonlove Honeysuckle had recently added a monogram formed of the\r\nletters P. C. and E. L.\r\n\r\nTheir new dancing-master was a tall, red-haired youth, with a\r\nwhite pointed face and very bright eyes. Miss Primrose, who always\r\nimplied that it was at great personal inconvenience and from purely\r\nphilanthropic motives that their teachers gave them their lessons,\r\nintroduced him as "Professor Wisp, who had very kindly consented to\r\nteach them dancing," and the young man made his new pupils a low bow,\r\nand turning to Miss Primrose, he said, "I\'ve got you a fiddler, ma\'am.\r\nOh, a rare fiddler! It\'s your needlework that has brought him. He\'s a\r\nweaver by trade, and he dearly loves pictures in silk. And he can give\r\nyou some pretty patterns to work from--can\'t you, Portunus?" and he\r\nclapped his hands twice.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, "like a bat dropped from the rafters," as Prunella, with an\r\ninexplicable shudder, whispered to Moonlove, a queer wizened old man,\r\nwith eyes as bright as Professor Wisp\'s, all mopping and mowing, with a\r\nfiddle and a bow under his arm, sprang suddenly out of the shadows.\r\n\r\n"Young ladies!" cried Professor Wisp, gleefully, "this is Master\r\nPortunus, fiddler to his Majesty the Emperor of the Moon,\r\njester-in-chief to the Lord of Ghosts and Shadows ... though his jests\r\nare apt to be silent ones. And he has come a long long way, young\r\nladies, to set your feet a dancing. Ho, ho, hoh!"\r\n\r\nAnd the professor sprang up at least three feet in the air, and landed\r\non the tips of his toes, as light as a ball of thistledown, while\r\nMaster Portunus stood rubbing his hands, and chuckling with senile glee.\r\n\r\n"What a vulgar young man! Just like a cheap Jack on market-day,"\r\nwhispered Viola Vigil to Prunella Chanticleer.\r\n\r\nBut Prunella, who had been looking at him intently, whispered back,\r\n"I\'m sure at one time he was one of our grooms. I only saw him once,\r\nbut I\'m sure it\'s he. What can Miss Primrose be thinking of to engage\r\nsuch low people as teachers?"\r\n\r\nPrunella had, of course, not been told any details as to Ranulph\'s\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nEven Miss Primrose seemed somewhat disconcerted. She stood there,\r\nmouthing and blinking, evidently at a loss what to say. Then she turned\r\nto the old man, and, in her best company manner, said she was delighted\r\nto meet another needlework enthusiast; and, turning to Professor Wisp,\r\nadded in her most cooing treacley voice, "I must embroider a pair of\r\nslippers for the dear doctor\'s birthday, and I want the design to be\r\nvery original, so perhaps this gentleman would kindly lend me his\r\nsampler."\r\n\r\nAt this the professor made another wild pirouette, and, clapping his\r\nhands with glee, cried, "Yes, yes, Portunus is your man. Portunus will\r\nset your stitches dancing to his tunes, ho, ho, hoh!"\r\n\r\nAnd he and Portunus dug each other in the ribs and laughed till the\r\ntears ran down their cheeks.\r\n\r\nAt last, pulling himself together, the Professor bade Portunus tune up\r\nhis fiddle, and requested that the young ladies should form up into two\r\nlines for the first dance.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll begin with \'Columbine,\'" he said.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s nothing but a country dance for farm servants," pouted\r\nMoonlove Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\nAnd Prunella Chanticleer boldly went up to Miss Primrose, and said,\r\n"Please, mayn\'t we go on with the jigs and quadrilles we\'ve always\r\nlearned? I don\'t think mother would like me learning new things. And\r\n\'Columbine\' is so vulgar."\r\n\r\n"Vulgar! New!" cried Professor Wisp, shrilly. "Why, my pretty Miss,\r\n\'Columbine\' was danced in the moonlight when Lud-in-the-Mist was\r\nnothing but a beech wood between two rivers. It is the dance that the\r\nSilent People dance along the Milky Way. It\'s the dance of laughter and\r\ntears."\r\n\r\n"Professor Wisp is going to teach you very old and aristocratic dances,\r\nmy dear," said Miss Primrose reprovingly. "Dances such as were danced\r\nat the court of Duke Aubrey, were they not, Professor Wisp?"\r\n\r\nBut the queer old fiddler had begun to tune up, and Professor Wisp,\r\nevidently thinking that they had already wasted enough time, ordered\r\nhis pupils to stand up and be in readiness to begin.\r\n\r\nVery sulkily it was that the Crabapple Blossoms obeyed, for they were\r\nall feeling as cross as two sticks at having such a vulgar buffoon for\r\ntheir master, and at being forced to learn silly old-fashioned dances\r\nthat would be of no use to them when they were grown-up.\r\n\r\nBut, surely, there was magic in the bow of that old fiddler! And,\r\nsurely, no other tune in the world was so lonely, so light-footed, so\r\nbeckoning! Do what one would one must needs up and follow it.\r\n\r\nWithout quite knowing how it came about, they were soon all tripping\r\nand bobbing and gliding and tossing, with their minds on fire, while\r\nMiss Primrose wagged her head in time to the measure, and Professor\r\nWisp, shouting directions the while, wound himself in and out among\r\nthem, as if they were so many beads, and he the string on which they\r\nwere threaded.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the music stopped, and flushed, laughing, and fanning\r\nthemselves with their pocket-handkerchiefs, the Crabapple Blossoms\r\nflung themselves down on the floor, against a pile of bulging sacks in\r\none of the corners, indifferent for probably the first time in their\r\nlives to possible damage to their frocks.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Primrose cried out sharply, "Not there, dears! Not there!"\r\n\r\nIn some surprise they were about to move, when Professor Wisp whispered\r\nsomething in her ear, and, with a little meaning nod to him, she said,\r\n"Very well, dears, stay where you are. It was only that I thought the\r\nfloor would be dirty for you."\r\n\r\n"Well, it wasn\'t such bad fun after all," said Moonlove Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n"No," admitted Prunella Chanticleer reluctantly. "That old man can\r\nplay!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder what\'s in these sacks; it feels too soft for apples," said\r\nAmbrosine Pyepowders, prodding in idle curiosity the one against which\r\nshe was leaning.\r\n\r\n"There\'s rather a queer smell coming from them," said Moonlove.\r\n\r\n"Horrid!" said Prunella, wrinkling up her little nose.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a giggle, she whispered, "We\'ve had the goose and the\r\nsage, so perhaps these are the onions!"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Portunus began to tune his fiddle again, and Professor\r\nWisp called out to them to form up again in two rows.\r\n\r\n"This time, my little misses," he said, "it\'s to be a sad solemn dance,\r\nso Miss Primrose must foot it with you--\'a very aristocratic dance,\r\nsuch as was danced at the court of Duke Aubrey\'!" and he gave them a\r\nroguish wink.\r\n\r\nSo admirable had been his imitation of Miss Primrose\'s voice that, for\r\nall he was such a vulgar buffoon, the Crabapple Blossoms could not help\r\ngiggling.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll ask you to listen to the tune before you begin to dance it,"\r\nhe went on. "Now then, Portunus!"\r\n\r\n"Why! It\'s just \'Columbine\' over again...." began Prunella scornfully.\r\n\r\nBut the words froze on her lips, and she stood spellbound and\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nIt was \'Columbine,\' but with a difference. For, since they had last\r\nheard it, the tune might have died, and wandered in strange places, to\r\ncome back to earth, an angry ghost.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, dance!" cried Professor Wisp, in harsh, peremptory tones.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in sheer self-defence that they obeyed--as if by dancing\r\nthey somehow or other escaped from that tune, which seemed to be\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n    "Within and out, in and out, round as a ball,\r\n    With hither and thither, as straight as a line,\r\n    With lily, germander, and sops in wine.\r\n    With sweet-brier\r\n    And bon-fire\r\n    And strawberry-wire\r\n    And columbine,"\r\n\r\nsang Professor Wisp. And in and out, in and out of a labyrinth of\r\ndreams wound the Crabapple Blossoms.\r\n\r\nBut now the tune had changed its key. It was getting gay once\r\nmore--gay, but strange, and very terrifying.\r\n\r\n    "Any lass for a Duke, a Duke who wears green,\r\n    In lands where the sun and the moon do not shine,\r\n    With lily, germander, and sops in wine.\r\n    With sweet-brier\r\n    And bon-fire\r\n    And strawberry-wire\r\n    And columbine,"\r\n\r\nsang Professor Wisp, and in and out he wound between his pupils--or,\r\nrather, not wound, but dived, darted, flashed, while every moment his\r\nsinging grew shriller, his laughter more wild.\r\n\r\nAnd then--whence and how they could not say--a new person had joined\r\nthe dance.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in green and he wore a black mask. And the curious thing\r\nwas that, in spite of all the crossings and recrossings and runs down\r\nthe middle, and the endless shuffling in the positions of the dancers,\r\ndemanded by the intricate figures of this dance, the newcomer was never\r\nbeside you--it was always with somebody else that he was dancing. You\r\nnever felt the touch of his hand. This was the experience of each\r\nindividual Crabapple Blossom.\r\n\r\nBut Moonlove Honeysuckle caught a glimpse of his back; and on it there\r\nwas a hump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n          MASTER AMBROSE CHASES A WILD GOOSE AND HAS A VISION\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose Honeysuckle had finished his midday meal, and was\r\nsmoking his churchwarden on his daisy-powdered lawn, under the branches\r\nof a great, cool, yellowing lime; and beside him sat his stout\r\ncomfortable wife, Dame Jessamine, placidly fanning herself to sleep,\r\nwith her pink-tongued mushroom-coloured pug snoring and choking in her\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose was ruminating on the consignment he was daily expecting\r\nof flowers-in-amber--a golden eastern wine, for the import of which his\r\nhouse had the monopoly in Dorimare.\r\n\r\nBut he was suddenly roused from his pleasant reverie by the sound of\r\nloud excited voices proceeding from the house, and turning heavily in\r\nhis chair, he saw his daughter, Moonlove, wild-eyed and dishevelled,\r\nrushing towards him across the lawn, followed by a crowd of servants\r\nwith scared faces and all chattering at once.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, what\'s this? What\'s this?" he cried testily.\r\n\r\nBut her only answer was to look at him in agonized terror, and then to\r\nmoan, "The horror of midday!"\r\n\r\nDame Jessamine sat up with a start and rubbing her eyes exclaimed,\r\n"Dear me, I believe I was napping. But ... Moonlove! Ambrose! What\'s\r\nhappening?"\r\n\r\nBut before Master Ambrose could answer, Moonlove gave three\r\nblood-curdling screams, and shrieked out, "Horror! Horror! The tune\r\nthat never stops! Break the fiddle! Break the fiddle! Oh, Father,\r\nquietly, on tiptoe behind him, cut the strings. Cut the strings and let\r\nme out, I want the dark."\r\n\r\nFor an instant, she stood quite still, head thrown back, eyes alert\r\nand frightened, like a beast at bay. Then, swift as a hare, she tore\r\nacross the lawn, with glances over her shoulder as if something were\r\npursuing her, and, rushing through the garden gate, vanished from their\r\nastonished view.\r\n\r\nThe servants, who till now had kept at a respectful distance, came\r\ncrowding up, their talk a jumble of such exclamations and statements\r\nas "Poor young lady!" "It\'s a sunstroke, sure as my name\'s Fishbones!"\r\n"Oh, my! it quite gave me the palpitations to hear her shriek!"\r\n\r\nAnd the pug yapped with such energy that he nearly burst his mushroom\r\nsides, and Dame Jessamine began to have hysterics.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds Master Ambrose stood bewildered, then, setting his\r\njaw, he pounded across the lawn, with as much speed as was left him by\r\nnearly fifty years of very soft living, out at the garden gate, down\r\nthe lane, and into the High Street.\r\n\r\nHere he joined the tail of a running crowd that, in obedience to the\r\nlaw that compels man to give chase to a fugitive, was trying hard to\r\ncatch up with Moonlove.\r\n\r\nThe blood was throbbing violently in Master Ambrose\'s temples, and his\r\nbrains seemed congested. All that he was conscious of, on the surface\r\nof his mind, was a sense of great irritation against Master Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer for not having had the cobbles on the High Street recently\r\nrenewed--they were so damnably slippery.\r\n\r\nBut, underneath this surface irritation, a nameless anxiety was buzzing\r\nlike a hornet.\r\n\r\nOn he pounded at the tail end of the hunt, blowing, puffing, panting,\r\nslipping on the cobbles, stumbling across the old bridge that spanned\r\nthe Dapple. Vaguely, as in delirium, he knew that windows were flung\r\nopen, heads stuck out, shrill voices enquiring what was the matter,\r\nand that from mouth to mouth were bandied the words, "It\'s little Miss\r\nHoneysuckle running away from her papa."\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the town walls and the west gate, they had to\r\ncall a sudden halt, for a funeral procession, that of a neighbouring\r\nfarmer, to judge from the appearance of the mourners, was winding its\r\nway into the town, bound for the Fields of Grammary, and the pursuers\r\nhad perforce to stand in respectful silence while it passed, and allow\r\ntheir quarry to disappear down a bend of the high road.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose was too impatient and too much out of breath consciously\r\nto register impressions of what was going on round him. But in the\r\nautomatic unquestioning way in which at such moments the senses do\r\ntheir work, he saw through the windows of the hearse that a red liquid\r\nwas trickling from the coffin.\r\n\r\nThis enforced delay broke the spell of blind purpose that had hitherto\r\nunited the pursuers into one. They now ceased to be a pack, and broke\r\nup again into separate individuals, each with his own business to\r\nattend to.\r\n\r\n"The little lass is too nimble-heeled for us," they said, grinning\r\nruefully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s a wild goose, that\'s what she is, and I fear she has led us\r\na wild goose chase," said Master Ambrose with a short embarrassed laugh.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to be acutely conscious of the unseemliness of the\r\nsituation--he, an ex-Mayor, a Senator and judge, and, what was more,\r\nhead of the ancient and honourable family of Honeysuckle, to be\r\npounding through the streets of Lud-in-the-Mist at the tail end of a\r\ncrowd of \'prentices and artisans, in pursuit of his naughty, crazy\r\nwild goose of a little daughter!\r\n\r\n"Pity it isn\'t Nat instead of me!" he thought to himself. "I believe\r\nhe\'d rather enjoy it."\r\n\r\nJust then, a farmer came along in his gig, and seeing the hot\r\nbreathless company standing puffing and mopping their brows, he asked\r\nthem if they were seeking a little lass, for, if so, he had passed her\r\na quarter of an hour ago beyond the turnpike, running like a hare, and\r\nhe\'d called out to her to stop, but she would not heed him.\r\n\r\nBy this time Master Ambrose was once more in complete possession of his\r\nwits and his breath.\r\n\r\nHe noticed one of his own clerks among the late pursuers, and bade\r\nhim run back to his stables and order three of his grooms to ride off\r\ninstantly in pursuit of his daughter.\r\n\r\nThen he himself, his face very stern, started off for the Academy.\r\n\r\nIt was just as well that he did not hear the remarks of his late\r\ncompanions as they made their way back to town; for he would have found\r\nthem neither sympathetic nor respectful. The Senators were certainly\r\nnot loved by the rabble. However, not having heard Moonlove\'s eldritch\r\nshrieks nor her wild remarks, they supposed that her father had been\r\nbullying her for some mild offence, and that, in consequence, she had\r\ntaken to her heels.\r\n\r\n"And if all these fat pigs of Senators," they said, "were set running\r\nlike that a little oftener, why, then, they\'d make better bacon!"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose had to work the knocker of the Academy door very hard\r\nbefore it was finally opened by Miss Primrose herself.\r\n\r\nShe looked flustered, and, as it seemed to Master Ambrose, a little\r\ndissipated, her face was so pasty and her eyelids so very red.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miss Crabapple!" he cried in a voice of thunder, "What, by the\r\nHarvest of Souls, have you been doing to my daughter, Moonlove? And if\r\nshe\'s been ill, why have we not been told, I should like to know? I\'ve\r\ncome here for an explanation, and I mean to get it."\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose, mopping and mowing, and garrulously inarticulate, took\r\nthe fuming gentleman into the parlour. But he could get nothing out\r\nof her further than disjointed murmurs about the need for cooling\r\ndraughts, and the child\'s being rather headstrong, and a possible touch\r\nof the sun. It was clear that she was scared out of her wits, and,\r\nmoreover, there was something she wished to conceal.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose, from his experience on the Bench, soon realized that\r\nthis was a type of witness upon whom it was useless to waste his time;\r\nso he said sternly, "You are evidently unable to talk sense yourself,\r\nbut perhaps some of your pupils possess that useful accomplishment.\r\nBut I warn you if ... if anything happens to my daughter it is you that\r\nwill be held responsible. And now, send ... let me see ... send me down\r\nPrunella Chanticleer, she\'s always been a sensible girl with a head on\r\nher shoulders. She\'ll be able to tell me what exactly is the matter\r\nwith Moonlove--which is more than you seem able to do."\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose, now almost gibbering with terror, stammered out\r\nsomething about "study hours," and "regularity being so desirable," and\r\n"dear Prunella\'s having been a little out of sorts herself recently."\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose repeated in a voice of thunder, "Send me Prunella\r\nChanticleer, at once."\r\n\r\nAnd standing there, stern and square, he was a rather formidable figure.\r\n\r\nSo Miss Primrose could only gibber and blink her acquiescence and\r\npromise him that "dear Prunella" should instantly be sent to him.\r\n\r\nWhen she had left him, Master Ambrose paced impatiently up and down,\r\nfrowning heavily, and occasionally shaking his head.\r\n\r\nThen he stood stock-still, in deep thought. Absently, he picked up from\r\nthe work-table a canvas shoe, in process of being embroidered with\r\nwools of various brilliant shades.\r\n\r\nAt first, he stared at it with unseeing eyes.\r\n\r\nThen, the surface of his mind began to take stock of the object. Its\r\nhalf finished design consisted of what looked like wild strawberries,\r\nonly the berries were purple instead of red.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly very well done. There was no doubt but that Miss\r\nPrimrose was a most accomplished needle-woman.\r\n\r\n"But what\'s the good of needlework? It doesn\'t teach one common sense,"\r\nhe muttered impatiently.\r\n\r\n"And how like a woman!" he added with a contemptuous little snort,\r\n"Aren\'t red strawberries good enough for her? Trying to improve on\r\nnature with her stupid fancies and her purple strawberries!"\r\n\r\nBut he was in no mood for wasting his time and attention on a\r\nhalf-embroidered slipper, and tossing it impatiently away he was about\r\nto march out of the room and call loudly for Prunella Chanticleer, when\r\nthe door opened and in she came.\r\n\r\nHad a stranger wanted to see an upper class maiden of Lud-in-the-Mist,\r\nhe would have found a typical specimen in Prunella Chanticleer.\r\n\r\nShe was fair, and plump, and dimpled; and, as in the case of her\r\nmother, the ruthless common sense of her ancestors of the revolution\r\nhad been trivialized, though not softened, into an equally ruthless\r\nsense of humour.\r\n\r\nSuch had been Prunella Chanticleer.\r\n\r\nBut, as she now walked into the room, Master Ambrose exclaimed to\r\nhimself, "Toasted cheese! How plain the girl has grown!"\r\n\r\nBut that was a mere matter of taste; some people might have thought her\r\nmuch prettier than she had ever been before. She was certainly less\r\nplump than she used to be, and paler. But it was the change in the\r\nexpression of her eyes that was most noticeable.\r\n\r\nHitherto, they had been as busy and restless (and, in justice to the\r\ncharms of Prunella let it be added, as golden brown) as a couple of\r\nbees in summer--darting incessantly from one small object to another,\r\nand distilling from each what it held of least essential, so that\r\nin time they would have fashioned from a thousand trivialities that\r\ninferior honey that is apt to be labeled "feminine wisdom."\r\n\r\nBut, now, these eyes were idle.\r\n\r\nOr, rather, her memory seemed to be providing them with a vision so\r\nabsorbing that nothing else could arrest their gaze.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, Master Ambrose felt a little uneasy in her\r\npresence. However, he tried to greet her in the tone of patronizing\r\nbanter that he always used when addressing his daughter or her friends.\r\nBut his voice had an unnatural sound as he cried, "Well, Prunella, and\r\nwhat have you all been doing to my Moonlove, eh? She came running home\r\nafter dinner, and if it hadn\'t been broad daylight, I should have said\r\nthat she had seen a ghost. And then off she dashed, up hill and down\r\ndale, like a paper chaser without any paper. What have you all been\r\ndoing to her, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we\'ve been doing anything to her, Cousin Ambrose,"\r\nPrunella answered in a low, curiously toneless voice.\r\n\r\nEver since the scene with Moonlove that afternoon, Master Ambrose had\r\nhad an odd feeling that facts were losing their solidity; and he had\r\nentered this house with the express purpose of bullying and hectoring\r\nthat solidity back to them. Instead of which they were rapidly\r\nvanishing, becoming attenuated to a sort of nebulous atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose had stronger nerves and a more decided mind than\r\nMaster Nathaniel. Two facts remained solid, namely that his daughter\r\nhad run away, and that for this Miss Crabapple\'s establishment was\r\nresponsible. These he grasped firmly as if they had been dumb-bells\r\nthat, by their weight, kept him from floating up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n"Now, Prunella," he said sternly, "there\'s something very queer about\r\nall this, and I believe you can explain it. Well? I\'m waiting."\r\n\r\nPrunella gave a little enigmatical smile.\r\n\r\n"What did she say when you saw her?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Say? Why, she was evidently scared out of her wits, and didn\'t\r\nknow what she was saying. She babbled something about the sun being\r\ntoo hot--though it seems to me very ordinary autumn weather that\r\nwe\'re having. And then she went on about cutting somebody\'s fiddle\r\nstrings ... oh, I don\'t know what!"\r\n\r\nPrunella gave a low cry of horror.\r\n\r\n"Cut the fiddle strings!" she repeated incredulously. And then she\r\nadded with a triumphant laugh, "she can\'t do that!"\r\n\r\n"Now, young lady," he cried roughly, "no more of this rubbish! Do you\r\nor do you not know what has taken Moonlove?"\r\n\r\nFor a second or two she gazed at him in silence, and then she said\r\nslowly, "Nobody ever knows what happens to other people. But,\r\nsupposing ... supposing she has eaten fairy fruit?" and she gave a\r\nlittle mocking smile.\r\n\r\nSilent with horror, Master Ambrose stared at her.\r\n\r\nThen he burst out furiously, "You foul-mouthed little hussy! Do you\r\ndare to insinuate...."\r\n\r\nBut Prunella\'s eyes were fixed on the window that opened on to the\r\ngarden, and instinctively he looked in that direction too.\r\n\r\nFor a second he supposed that the portrait of Duke Aubrey that hung\r\nin the Senate Room of the Guildhall had been moved to the wall of\r\nMiss Primrose\'s parlour. Framed in the window, against the leafy\r\nbackground of the garden stood, quite motionless, a young man in\r\nantique dress. The face, the auburn ringlets, the suit of green, the\r\nrustic background--everything, down to the hunting horn entwined with\r\nflowers that he held in one hand, and the human skull that he held in\r\nthe other, were identical with those depicted in the famous portrait.\r\n\r\n"By the White Ladies of the Fields!" muttered Master Ambrose, rubbing\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nBut when he looked again the figure had vanished.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds he stood gaping and bewildered, and Prunella seized\r\nthe opportunity of slipping unnoticed from the room.\r\n\r\nThen he came to his senses, on a wave of berserk rage. They had been\r\nplaying tricks, foul, vulgar tricks, on him, on Ambrose Honeysuckle,\r\nSenator and ex-Mayor. But they should pay for it, by the Sun, Moon and\r\nStars, they should pay for it! And he shook his fist at the ivy and\r\nsquill bedecked walls.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, it was he himself who was paying for it. An\r\nappalling accusation had been made against his only child; and,\r\nperhaps, the accusation was true.\r\n\r\nWell, things must be faced. He was now quite calm, and, with his stern\r\nset face, a much more formidable person than the raging spluttering\r\ncreature of a few seconds ago. He was determined to get to the bottom\r\nof this affair, and either to vindicate his daughter from the foul\r\ninsinuation made by Prunella Chanticleer, or else, if the horrible\r\nthing were true (and a voice inside him that would not be silenced kept\r\nsaying that it was true) to face the situation squarely, and, for the\r\ngood of the town, find out who was responsible for what had happened\r\nand bring them to the punishment they merited.\r\n\r\nThere was probably no one in all Lud-in-the-Mist who would suffer\r\nin the same degree from such a scandal in his family as Master\r\nAmbrose Honeysuckle. And there was something fine in the way he thus\r\nunflinchingly faced the possibility. Not for a moment did he think of\r\nhushing the matter up to shield his daughter\'s reputation.\r\n\r\nNo, justice should run its course even if the whole town had to know\r\nthat Ambrose Honeysuckle\'s only child--and she a girl, which seemed,\r\nsomehow, to make it more horrible--had eaten fairy fruit.\r\n\r\nAs to his vision of Duke Aubrey, that he dismissed as an hallucination\r\ndue to his excited condition and perhaps, as well, to the hysterical\r\natmosphere that seemed to lie like a thick fog over the Academy.\r\n\r\nBefore he left Miss Primrose\'s parlour his eyes fell on the half\r\nembroidered slipper he had impatiently tossed away on the entrance of\r\nPrunella Chanticleer.\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly; perhaps, after all, it had not been due to mere\r\nfoolish feminine fancy that the strawberries were purple instead of\r\nred. She may have had real models for her embroidery.\r\n\r\nHe put the slipper in his pocket. It might prove of value in the law\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose was mistaken in supposing that the berries\r\nembroidered on the slipper were fairy fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n            ENDYMION LEER LOOKS FRIGHTENED, AND A BREACH IS\r\n                       MADE IN AN OLD FRIENDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose fully expected on reaching home to find that one of the\r\ngrooms he had despatched after Moonlove had returned with her in safe\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the case, and he was confronted with another\r\nfrightful contingency. Moonlove had last been seen running, at a speed\r\nso great and so unflagging as to hint at some sustaining force that was\r\nmore than human, due West. What if she were making for the Debatable\r\nHills? Once across those hills she would never again be seen in\r\nDorimare.\r\n\r\nHe must go to Mumchance at once, and give the alarm. Search parties\r\nmust immediately be sent to ransack the country from one end to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn his way out he was stopped by Dame Jessamine in the fretful\r\ncomplaining condition that he always found so irritating.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been, Ambrose?" she cried querulously. "First Moonlove\r\nscreaming like a mad cockatoo! And then you rushing off, just after\r\nyour dinner too, and leaving me like that in the lurch when I was\r\nso upset that I was on the verge of swooning! Where did you go to\r\nAmbrose?" and her voice grew shrill. "I do wish you would go to Miss\r\nPrimrose and tell her she must not let Moonlove be such a tom-boy and\r\nplay practical jokes on her parents ... rushing home in the middle of\r\nthe day like that and talking such silly nonsense. She really is a\r\nvery naughty girl to give us such a fright. I feel half inclined to go\r\nstraight off to the Academy and give her a good scolding."\r\n\r\n"Stop chattering, Jessamine, and let me go," cried Master Ambrose.\r\n"Moonlove is not at the Academy."\r\n\r\nAnd he found a sort of savage satisfaction in calling back over his\r\nshoulder as he hurried from the room, "I very much fear you will never\r\nsee your daughter again, Jessamine."\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour later, he returned home even more depressed than\r\nwhen he had set out, owing to what he had learned from Mumchance as\r\nto the recent alarming spread in the town of the consumption of fairy\r\nfruit. He found Endymion Leer sitting in the parlour with his wife.\r\n\r\nHer husband\'s parting words had brought on an attack of violent\r\nhysterics and the alarmed servants, fearing a seizure, had, on their\r\nown responsibility, summoned the only doctor of Lud in whom they had\r\nany faith, Endymion Leer. And, judging from Dame Jessamine\'s serene\r\nand smiling face, he had succeeded in removing completely the terrible\r\nimpression produced by her husband\'s parting words, and in restoring to\r\nwhat she was pleased to call her mind its normal condition, namely that\r\nof a kettle that contains just enough water to simmer comfortably over\r\na low fire.\r\n\r\nShe greeted Master Ambrose with a smile that for her was quite eager.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ambrose!" she cried, "I have been having such a pleasant talk with\r\nDr. Leer. He says girls of her age often get silly and excited, though\r\nI\'m sure I never did, and that she\'s sure to be brought home before\r\nnight. But I do think we\'d better take her away from Miss Primrose\'s.\r\nFor one thing she has really learned quite enough now--I know no one\r\nwho can make prettier groups in butter. So I think we had better give a\r\nball for her before the winter, so if you will excuse me, Dr. Leer, I\r\nhave just a few things to see to...." and off she bustled to overhaul\r\nMoonlove\'s bridal chest, which, according to the custom of Dorimarite\r\nmothers, she had been storing, ever since her daughter\'s birth, with\r\nlace and velvets and brocade.\r\n\r\nNot without reason, Dame Jessamine was considered the stupidest woman\r\nin Lud-in-the-Mist. And, in addition, the Ludite\'s lack of imagination\r\nand inability to feel serious emotions, amounted in her to a sort of\r\naffective idiocy.\r\n\r\nSo Master Ambrose found himself alone with Endymion Leer; and, though\r\nhe had never liked the man, he was very glad to have the chance of\r\nconsulting him. For, socially, however great his shortcomings might\r\nbe, Master Ambrose knew him to be undeniably the best doctor in the\r\ncountry, and a very clever fellow into the bargain.\r\n\r\n"Leer," he said solemnly, when Dame Jessamine had left the room, "there\r\nare very queer things happening at that Academy ... very queer things."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" said Endymion Leer, in a tone of surprise. "What sort of\r\nthings?"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose gave a short laugh: "Not the sort of things, if my\r\nsuspicions are correct, that one cares to talk about--even between men.\r\nBut I can tell you, Leer, though I\'m not what one could call a fanciful\r\nman, I believe if I\'d stayed much longer in that house I should have\r\ngone off my head, the whole place stinks with ... well, with pernicious\r\nnonsense, and I actually found myself, I, Ambrose Honeysuckle, seeing\r\nthings--ridiculous things."\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer looked interested.\r\n\r\n"What sort of things, Master Ambrose?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not worth repeating--except in so far as it shows that the\r\nfancies of silly overwrought women can sometimes be infectious. I\r\nactually imagined that I saw the Senate room portrait of Duke Aubrey\r\nreflected on the window. And if I take to fancying things--well, there\r\nmust be something very fishy in the offing."\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer\'s expression was inscrutable.\r\n\r\n"Optical delusions have been known before, Master Ambrose," he said\r\ncalmly. "Even the eyes of Senators may sometimes play them tricks.\r\nOptical delusions, legal fictions--and so the world wags on."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose grunted. He loathed the fellow\'s offensive way of\r\nputting things.\r\n\r\nBut he was sore at heart and terribly anxious, and he felt the need of\r\nhaving his fears either confirmed or dispelled, so, ignoring the sneer,\r\nhe said with a weary sigh: "However, that\'s a mere trifle. I have grave\r\nreasons for fearing that my daughter has ... has ... well, not to put\r\ntoo fine a point on things, I\'m afraid that my daughter has eaten fairy\r\nfruit."\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer flung up his hands in horror, and then he laughed\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n"Impossible, my dear sir, impossible! Your good lady told me you were\r\nsadly anxious about her, but let me assure you such an idea is mere\r\nmorbidness on your part. The thing\'s impossible."\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Master Ambrose grimly; and producing the slipper from his\r\npocket he held it out, saying, "What do you say to that? I found it in\r\nMiss Crabapple\'s parlour. I\'m not much of a botanist, but I\'ve never\r\nseen purple strawberries in Dorimare ... toasted cheese! What\'s taken\r\nthe man?"\r\n\r\nFor Endymion Leer had turned livid, and was staring at the design on\r\nthe shoe with eyes as full of horror as if it had been some hideous\r\ngoblin.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose interpreted this as corroboration of his own theory.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sort of groan: "Not so impossible after all, eh?" he said\r\ngloomily. "Yes, that I very much fear is the sort of stuff my poor\r\nlittle girl has been given to eat."\r\n\r\nThen his eyes flashed, and clenching his fist he cried, "But it\'s not\r\nher I blame. Before I\'m many days older I\'ll smoke out that nest of\r\nwasps! I\'ll hang that simpering old woman from her own doorpost. By the\r\nGolden Apples of the West I\'ll...."\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer had by this time, at any rate externally, recovered his\r\nequanimity.\r\n\r\n"Are you referring to Miss Primrose Crabapple?" he asked in his usual\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Primrose Crabapple!" boomed Master Ambrose, "nonsensical,\r\nfoul-minded, obscene old...."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," interrupted Endymion Leer with good-humoured impatience,\r\n"I daresay she\'s all of that and a great deal more, but, all the same,\r\nI don\'t believe her capable of having given your daughter what you\r\nthink she has. I admit, when you first showed me that slipper I was\r\nfrightened. Unlike you, I am a bit of a botanist, and I certainly have\r\nnever seen a berry like that in Dorimare. But after all that does\r\nnot prove that it grows ... across the hills. There\'s many a curious\r\nfruit to be found in the Cinnamon Isles, or in the oases of the Amber\r\nDesert ... why, your own ships, Master Ambrose, sometimes bring such\r\nfruit. The ladies of Lud have no lack of exotic fruit and flowers to\r\ncopy in their embroidery. No, no, you\'re a bit unhinged this evening,\r\nMaster Ambrose, else you would not allow so much as the shadow of foul\r\nsuspicions like these to cross your mind."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose groaned.\r\n\r\nAnd then he said a little stiffly, "I am not given, Dr. Leer, to\r\nharbouring foul suspicions without cause. But a great deal of mischief\r\nis sometimes done by not facing facts. How is one to explain my\r\ndaughter\'s running away, due west, like one possessed? Besides,\r\nPrunella Chanticleer as much as told me she had ... eaten a certain\r\nthing ... and ... and ... I\'m old enough to remember the great drought,\r\nso I know the smell, so to speak, of evil, and there is something very\r\nstrange going on in that Academy."\r\n\r\n"Prunella Chanticleer, did you say?" queried Endymion Leer with an\r\nemphasis on the last word, and with a rather odd expression in his eyes.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose looked surprised.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. "Prunella Chanticleer, her school fellow and intimate\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer gave a short laugh.\r\n\r\n"The Chanticleers are ... rather curious people," he said drily, "Are\r\nyou aware that Ranulph Chanticleer has done the very thing you suspect\r\nyour daughter of having done?"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose gaped at him.\r\n\r\nRanulph had certainly always been an odd and rather disagreeable boy,\r\nand there had been that horrid little incident at the Moongrass cheese\r\nsupper-party ... but that he actually should have eaten fairy fruit!\r\n\r\n"Do you mean? Do you mean...?" he gasped.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer nodded his head significantly: "One of the worst cases I\r\nhave ever known."\r\n\r\n"And Nathaniel knows?"\r\n\r\nAgain Endymion Leer nodded.\r\n\r\nA wave of righteous indignation swept over Master Ambrose. The\r\nHoneysuckles were every bit as ancient and honourable a family as the\r\nChanticleers, and yet here was he, ready to tarnish his escutcheon for\r\never, ready if need be to make the town crier trumpet his disgrace\r\nfrom the market-place, to sacrifice money, position, family pride,\r\neverything, for the good of the community. While the only thought of\r\nNathaniel, and he the Mayor, was to keep his skeleton safely hidden in\r\nthe cupboard.\r\n\r\n"Master Ambrose," continued Endymion Leer, in a grave impressive voice,\r\n"if what you fear about your daughter be true, then it is Master\r\nNathaniel who is to blame. No, no, hear me out," as Master Ambrose\r\nraised a protesting hand. "I happen to know that some months ago\r\nMumchance warned him of the alarming increase there has been recently\r\nin Lud in the consumption of ... a certain commodity. And I know that\r\nthis is true from my practice in the less genteel parts of the town.\r\nTake it from me, Master Ambrose, you Senators make a great mistake in\r\nignoring what takes place in those low haunts. Nasty things have a way\r\nof not always staying at the bottom, you know--stir the pond and they\r\nrise to the top. Anyway, Master Nathaniel was warned, yet he took no\r\nsteps."\r\n\r\nHe paused for a few seconds, and then, fixing his eyes searchingly on\r\nMaster Ambrose, he said, "Did it never strike you that Master Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer was a rather ... curious man?"\r\n\r\n"Never," said Master Ambrose coldly. "What are you insinuating, Leer?"\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer gave a little shrug: "Well, it is you who have set the\r\nexample in insinuations. Master Nathaniel is a haunted man, and a bad\r\nconscience makes a very good ghost. If a man has once tasted fairy\r\nfruit he is never the same again. I have sometimes wondered if perhaps,\r\nlong ago, when he was a young man...."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Leer!" cried Master Ambrose angrily. "Chanticleer\r\nis a very old friend of mine, and, what\'s more, he\'s my second cousin.\r\nThere\'s nothing wrong about Nathaniel."\r\n\r\nBut was this true? A few hours ago he would have laughed to scorn any\r\nsuggestion to the contrary. But since then, his own daughter ... ugh!\r\n\r\nYes, Nathaniel had certainly always been a very queer fellow--touchy,\r\nirascible, whimsical.\r\n\r\nA swarm of little memories, not noticed at the time, buzzed in Master\r\nAmbrose\'s head ... irrational actions, equivocal remarks. And, in\r\nparticular, one evening, years and years ago, when they had been\r\nboys ... Nat\'s face at the eerie sound produced by an old lute. The\r\nlook in his eyes had been like that in Moonlove\'s today.\r\n\r\nNo, no. It would never do to start suspecting everyone--above all his\r\noldest friend.\r\n\r\nSo he let the subject of Master Nathaniel drop and questioned Endymion\r\nLeer as to the effects on the system of fairy fruit, and whether there\r\nwas really no hope of finding an antidote.\r\n\r\nThen Endymion Leer started applying his famous balm--a balm that varied\r\nwith each patient that required it.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, certainly, there was no cure. But when the eater was\r\na Honeysuckle, and hence, born with a healthy mind in a healthy body\r\nthere was every reason to hope that no poison could be powerful enough\r\nto undermine such a constitution.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but suppose she is already across the border?" said Master\r\nAmbrose. Endymion Leer gave a little shrug.\r\n\r\n"In that case, of course, there is nothing more one can do," he replied.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose gave a deep sigh and leant back wearily in his chair,\r\nand for a few minutes they sat in silence.\r\n\r\nDrearily and hopelessly Master Ambrose\'s mind wandered over the events\r\nof the day and finally settled, as is the way with a tired mind, on the\r\nleast important--the red juice he had noticed oozing out of the coffin,\r\nwhen they had been checked at the west gate by the funeral procession.\r\n\r\n"Do the dead bleed, Leer?" he said suddenly.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer sprang from his chair as if he had been shot. First he\r\nturned white, then he turned crimson.\r\n\r\n"What the ... what the ..." he stuttered, "what do you mean by that\r\nquestion, Master Ambrose?"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently in the grip of some violent emotion.\r\n\r\n"Busty Bridget!" exclaimed Master Ambrose, testily, "what, by the\r\nHarvest of Souls, has taken you now, Leer? It may have been a silly\r\nquestion, but it was quite a harmless one. We were stopped by a funeral\r\nthis afternoon at the west gate, and I thought I saw a red liquid\r\noozing from the coffin. But, by the White Ladies of the Fields, I\'ve\r\nseen so many queer things today that I\'ve ceased to trust my own eyes."\r\n\r\nThese words completely restored Endymion Leer\'s good humour. He flung\r\nback his head and laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Why, Master Ambrose," he gurgled, "it was such a grisly question that\r\nit gave me quite a turn. Owing to the deplorable ignorance of this\r\ncountry I\'m used to my patients asking me rather queer things ... but\r\nthat beats anything I\'ve yet heard. \'Do the dead bleed? Do pigs fly?\'\r\nHa, ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that Master Ambrose was beginning to look stiff and\r\noffended, he controlled his mirth, and added, "Well, well, a man as\r\nsorely tried as you have been today, Master Ambrose, is to be excused\r\nif he has hallucinations ... it is wonderful what queer things we\r\nimagine we see when we are unhinged by strong emotion. And now I must\r\nbe going. Birth and death, Master Ambrose, they wait for no man--not\r\neven for Senators. So I must be off and help the little Ludites into\r\nthe world, and the old ones out of it. And in the meantime don\'t\r\ngive up hope. At any moment one of Mumchance\'s good Yeomen may come\r\ngalloping up with the little lady at his saddle-bow. And then--even if\r\nshe should have eaten what you fear she has--I shall be much surprised\r\nif a Honeysuckle isn\'t able with time and care to throw off all effects\r\nof that foul fodder and grow up into as sensible a woman--as her\r\nmother."\r\n\r\nAnd, with these characteristic words of comfort, Endymion Leer bustled\r\noff on his business.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose spent a most painful evening, his ears, on the one hand,\r\nalert for every sound of a horse\'s hoof, for every knock at the front\r\ndoor, in case they might herald news of Moonlove; and, at the same\r\ntime, doing their best not to hear Dame Jessamine\'s ceaseless prattle.\r\n\r\n"Ambrose, I wish you\'d remind the clerks to wipe their shoes before\r\nthey come in. Have you forgotten you promised me we should have a\r\nseparate door for the warehouse? I\'ve got it on paper.\r\n\r\n"How nice it is to know that there\'s nothing serious the matter with\r\nMoonlove, isn\'t it? But I don\'t know what I should have done this\r\nafternoon if that kind Doctor Leer hadn\'t explained it all to me. How\r\ncould you run away a second time, Ambrose, and leave me in that state\r\nwithout even fetching my hartshorn? I do think men are so heartless.\r\n\r\n"What a naughty girl Moonlove is to run away like this! I wonder when\r\nthey\'ll find her and bring her back? But it will be nice having her\r\nat home this winter, won\'t it? What a pity Ranulph Chanticleer isn\'t\r\nolder, he\'d do so nicely for her, wouldn\'t he? But I suppose Florian\r\nBaldbreeches will be just as rich, and he\'s nearer her age.\r\n\r\n"Do you think Marigold and Dreamsweet and the rest of them will be\r\nshocked by Moonlove\'s rushing off in this wild way? However, as Dr.\r\nLeer said, in his quaint way, girls will be girls.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ambrose, do you remember my deer-coloured tuftaffity, embroidered\r\nwith forget-me-nots and stars? I had it in my bridal chest. Well, I\r\nthink I shall have it made up for Moonlove. There\'s nothing like the\r\nold silks, or the old dyes either--there were no galls or gum-syrups\r\nused in them. You remember my deer-coloured tuftaffity, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose could stand it no longer. He sprang to his feet, and\r\ncried roughly, "I\'ll give you a handful of Yeses and Noes, Jessamine,\r\nand it\'ll keep you amused for the rest of the evening sorting them out,\r\nand sticking them on to your questions. I\'m going out."\r\n\r\nHe would go across to Nat\'s ... Nat might not be a very efficient\r\nMayor, but he was his oldest friend, and he felt he needed his sympathy.\r\n\r\n"If ... if any news comes about Moonlove, I\'ll be over at the\r\nChanticleers. Let me know at once," he called over his shoulder, as he\r\nhurried from the room.\r\n\r\nYes, he was longing for a talk with Nat. Not that he had any belief in\r\nNat\'s judgement; but he himself could provide all that was needed.\r\n\r\nAnd, apart from everything else, it would be comforting to talk to\r\na man who was in the same boat as himself--if, that is to say, the\r\ngossip retailed by Endymion Leer were true. But whether it were true\r\nor not Leer was a vulgar fellow, and had had no right to divulge a\r\nprofessional secret.\r\n\r\nSo huge did the events of the day loom in his own mind, that he felt\r\nsure of finding their shadow lying over the Chanticleers; and he was\r\nprepared to be magnanimous and assure the conscience-stricken Master\r\nNathaniel that though, as Mayor, he may have been a little remiss and\r\nslack, nevertheless, he could not, in fairness, be held responsible for\r\nthe terrible thing that had happened.\r\n\r\nBut he had forgotten the gulf that lay between the Magistrates and\r\nthe rest of the town. Though probably the only topics of conversation\r\nthat evening in every kitchen, in every tavern, in every tradesman\'s\r\nparlour, were the good run for his money little Miss Honeysuckle had\r\ngiven her revered father that afternoon, and the search parties of\r\nYeomen that were scouring the country for her--not to mention the\r\nterrible suspicions as to the cause of her flight he had confided to\r\nMumchance; nevertheless not a word of it all had reached the ears of\r\nthe other Magistrates.\r\n\r\nSo, when the front-door of the Chanticleers was opened for him, he was\r\ngreeted by sounds of uproarious laughter proceeding from the parlour.\r\n\r\nThe Polydore Vigils were spending the evening there, and the whole\r\nparty was engaged in trying to catch a moth--flicking at it with their\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, stumbling over the furniture, emulating each\r\nother to further efforts in the ancient terms of stag-hunting.\r\n\r\n"Come and join the fun, Ambrose," shouted Master Nathaniel, crimson\r\nwith exertion and laughter.\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose began to see red.\r\n\r\n"You ... you ... heartless, gibbering idiots!" he roared.\r\n\r\nThe moth-hunters paused in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Suffering Cats! What\'s taken you, Ambrose?" cried Master Nathaniel.\r\n"Stag-hunting, they say, was a royal sport. Even the Honeysuckles might\r\nstoop to it!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t the Honeysuckles consider a moth a stag, Ambrose?" laughed\r\nMaster Polydore Vigil.\r\n\r\nBut that evening the old joke seemed to have lost its savour.\r\n\r\n"Nathaniel," said Master Ambrose solemnly, "the curse of our country\r\nhas fallen upon you and me ... and you are hunting moths!"\r\n\r\nNow, "curse" happened to be one of the words that had always frightened\r\nMaster Nathaniel. So much did he dislike it that he even avoided the\r\nwords that resembled it in sound, and had made Dame Marigold dismiss a\r\nscullery-maid, merely because her name happened to be Kirstie.\r\n\r\nHence, Master Ambrose\'s words sent him into a frenzy of nervous\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n"Take that back, Ambrose! Take that back!" he roared. "Speak for\r\nyourself. The ... the ... the cur ... nothing of that sort is on me!"\r\n\r\n"That is not true, Nathaniel," said Master Ambrose sternly. "I have\r\nonly too good reason to fear that Moonlove is stricken by the same\r\nsickness as Ranulph, and...."\r\n\r\n"You lie!" shouted Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n"And in both cases," continued Master Ambrose, relentlessly, "the cause\r\nof the sickness was ... fairy fruit."\r\n\r\nDame Dreamsweet Vigil gave a smothered scream, Dame Marigold blushed\r\ncrimson, and Master Polydore exclaimed, in a deeply shocked voice, "By\r\nthe Milky Way, Ambrose, you are going a little too far--even if there\r\nwere not ladies present."\r\n\r\n"No, Polydore. There come times when even ladies must face facts. You\r\nsee before you two dishonoured men--Nathaniel and myself. One of our\r\nstatutes says that in the country of Dorimare each member of a family\r\nshall be the master of his own possessions, and that nothing shall\r\nbe held in common but disgrace. And before you are many days older,\r\nPolydore, your family, too, may be sharing that possession. Each one of\r\nus is threatened in what is nearest to us, and our chief citizen--hunts\r\nmoths!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Nathaniel," he went on in a louder and angrier voice, "you\r\nneedn\'t glare and growl! I consider that you, as Mayor of this town,\r\nare responsible for what has happened today, and...."\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon and Stars!" bellowed Master Nathaniel, "I haven\'t the\r\nslightest idea what you mean by \'what has happened today,\' but whatever\r\nit is, I know very well I\'m not responsible. Were you responsible last\r\nyear when old Mother Pyepowders\'s yapping little bitch chewed up old\r\nMatt\'s pet garters embroidered by his first sweetheart, and when...."\r\n\r\n"You poor, snivelling, feeble-minded buffoon! You criminal nincompoop!\r\nYes, criminal, I say," and at each word Master Ambrose\'s voice grew\r\nlouder. "Who was it that knew of the spread of this evil thing and took\r\nno steps to stop it? Whose own son has eaten it? By the Harvest of\r\nSouls you may have eaten it yourself for all I know...."\r\n\r\n"Silence, you foul-mouthed, pompous, brainless, wind-bag! You ...\r\nyou ... foul, gibbering Son of a Fairy!" sputtered Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nAnd so they went at it, hammer and tongs, doing their best to destroy\r\nin a few minutes the fabric built up by years of fellowship and mutual\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nAnd the end of it was that Master Nathaniel pointed to the door, and in\r\na voice trembling with fury, told Master Ambrose to leave his house,\r\nand never to enter it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                      PANIC AND THE SILENT PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning Captain Mumchance rode off to search Miss\r\nPrimrose Crabapple\'s Academy for fairy fruit. And in his pocket was a\r\nwarrant for the arrest of that lady should his search prove successful.\r\n\r\nBut when he reached the Academy he found that the birds had flown. The\r\nold rambling house was empty and silent. No light feet tripped down its\r\ncorridors, no light laughter wakened its echoes. Some fierce wind had\r\nscattered the Crabapple Blossoms. Miss Primrose, too, had disappeared.\r\n\r\nA nameless dread seized Captain Mumchance as he searched through the\r\nempty silent rooms.\r\n\r\nHe found the bedrooms in disorder--drawers half opened, delicately\r\ntinted clothing heaped on the floor--indicating that the flitting had\r\nbeen a hurried one.\r\n\r\nBeneath each bed, too, he found a little pair of shoes, very down at\r\nheel, with almost worn-out soles, looking as if the feet that had worn\r\nthem must have been very busy.\r\n\r\nHe continued his search down to the kitchen premises, where he found\r\nMother Tibbs sitting smiling to herself, and crooning.\r\n\r\n"Now, you cracked harlot," he cried roughly, "what have you been up\r\nto, I\'d like to know? I\'ve had my eye on you, my beauty, for a very\r\nlong time. If I can\'t make you speak, perhaps the judges will. What\'s\r\nhappened to the young ladies? Just you tell me that!"\r\n\r\nBut Mother Tibbs was more crazy than usual that day, and her only\r\nanswer was to trip up and down the kitchen floor, singing snatches of\r\nold songs about birds set free, and celestial flowers, and the white\r\nfruits that grow on the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nMumchance was holding one of the little shoes, and catching sight of\r\nit, she snatched it from him, and tenderly stroked it, as if it had\r\nbeen a wounded dove.\r\n\r\n"Dancing, dancing, dancing!" she muttered, "dancing day and night! It\'s\r\nstony dancing on dreams."\r\n\r\nAnd with an angry snort Mumchance realized, not for the first time in\r\nhis life, that it was a waste of time trying to get any sense out of\r\nMother Tibbs.\r\n\r\nSo he started again to search the house, this time for fairy fruit.\r\n\r\nHowever, not a pip, not a scrap of peel could he find that looked\r\nsuspicious. But, finally, in the loft he discovered empty sacks with\r\ngreat stains of juice on them, and it could have been no ordinary\r\njuice, for some of the stains were colours he had never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe terrible news of the Crabapple Blossoms\' disappearance spread like\r\nwildfire through Lud-in-the-Mist. Business was at a standstill. Half\r\nthe Senators, and some of the richer tradesmen, had daughters in the\r\nAcademy, and poor Mumchance was besieged by frantic parents who seemed\r\nto think that he was keeping their daughters concealed somewhere on his\r\nperson. They were all, too, calling down vengeance on the head of Miss\r\nPrimrose Crabapple, and demanding that she should be found and handed\r\nover to justice.\r\n\r\nIt was Endymion Leer who got the credit for finding her. He brought\r\nher, sobbing and screaming, to the guard-room of the Yeomanry. He said\r\nhe had discovered her wandering about, half frantic, on the wharf,\r\nevidently hoping to take refuge in some outward bound vessel.\r\n\r\nShe denied all knowledge of what had happened to her pupils, and said\r\nshe had woken up that morning to find the birds flown.\r\n\r\nShe also denied, with passionate protestations, having given them fairy\r\nfruit. In this, Endymion Leer supported her. The smugglers, he said,\r\nwere men of infinite resource and cunning, and what more likely than\r\nthat they should have inserted the stuff into a consignment of innocent\r\nfigs and grapes?\r\n\r\n"And school girls being one quarter boy and three quarters bird," he\r\nadded with his dry chuckle, "they cannot help being orchard thieves ...\r\nand if there isn\'t an orchard to rob, why, they\'ll rob the loft where\r\nthe apples are kept. And if the apples turn out not to be apples--why,\r\nthen, no one is to blame!" Nevertheless, Miss Primrose was locked up in\r\nthe room in the Guildhall reserved for prisoners of the better class,\r\npending her trial on a charge of receiving contraband goods in the form\r\nof woven silk--the only charge, owing to the willful blindness of the\r\nlaw, on which she could be tried.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a couple of the Yeomen, who had been scouring the\r\ncountry for Moonlove Honeysuckle, returned with the news that they\r\nhad chased her as far as the Debatable Hills, and had last seen her\r\nscrambling like a goat up their sides. And no Dorimarite could be\r\nexpected to follow her further.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later the Yeomen sent to search for the other\r\nCrabapple Blossoms returned with similar news. All along the West Road\r\nthey had heard rumours of a band of melancholy maidens flitting past\r\nto the sound of sad wild ditties. And, finally, they had come upon a\r\ngoatherd who had seen them disappearing, like Moonlove, among the folds\r\nof the terrible hills.\r\n\r\nSo there was nothing further to be done. The Crabapple Blossoms had by\r\nnow surely perished in the Elfin Marches, or else vanished for ever\r\ninto Fairyland.\r\n\r\nThese were sad days in Lud-in-the-Mist--all the big houses with their\r\nshutters down, the dancing halls and other places of amusement closed,\r\nsad, frightened faces in the streets--and, as if in sympathy with human\r\nthings, the days shortening, the trees yellowing, and beginning to shed\r\ntheir leaves.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer was much in request--especially in the houses that\r\nhad hitherto been closed to him. Now, he was in and out of them all\r\nday long, exhorting, comforting, advising. And wherever he went he\r\nmanaged to leave the impression that somehow or other Master Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer was to blame for the whole business.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it, Master Nathaniel, these days, was the most\r\nunpopular man in Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate he got nothing but sour looks from his colleagues;\r\nthreats and insults were muttered behind him as he walked down the High\r\nStreet; and one day, pausing at a street corner where a puppet-show\r\nwas being exhibited, he found that he himself was the villain of the\r\npiece. For when the time-honoured climax was reached and the hero was\r\nbelabouring the villain\'s wooden head with his cudgel, the falsetto\r\nvoice of the concealed showman punctuated the blows with such comments\r\nas: "There, Nat Cock o\' the Roost, is a black eye to you for small\r\nloaves ... and there\'s another for sour wine ... and there\'s a bloody\r\nnose to you for being too fond of papples and ares."\r\n\r\nHere the showman changed his voice and said, "Please, sir, what are\r\npapples and ares?" "Ask Nat Cock o\' the Roost," came the falsetto,\r\n"and he\'ll tell you they\'re apples and pears that come from across the\r\nhills!"\r\n\r\nMost significant of all, for the first time since Master Nathaniel had\r\nbeen head of the family, Ebeneezor Prim did not come himself to wind\r\nthe clocks. Ebeneezor was a paragon of dignity and respectability, and\r\nit was a joke in Lud society that you could not really be sure of your\r\nsocial status till he came to wind your clocks himself, instead of\r\nsending one of his apprentices.\r\n\r\nHowever, the apprentice he sent to Master Nathaniel was almost as\r\nrespectable looking as he was himself. He wore a neat black wig, and\r\nhis expression was sanctimonious in the extreme, with the corners of\r\nhis mouth turned down, like one of his master\'s clocks that had stopped\r\nat 7:25.\r\n\r\nCertainly a very respectable young man, and one who was evidently fully\r\naware of the unsavoury rumours that were circulating concerning the\r\nhouse of Chanticleer; for he looked with such horror at the silly\r\nmoon-face with its absurd revolving moustachios of Master Nathaniel\'s\r\ngrandfather clock, and opened its mahogany body so gingerly, and,\r\nwhen he had adjusted its pendulum, wiped his fingers on his pocket\r\nhandkerchief with such an expression of disgust, that the innocent\r\ntimepiece might have been the wicked Mayor\'s familiar--a grotesque\r\nhobgoblin tabby cat, purring, and licking her whiskers after an obscene\r\norgy of garbage.\r\n\r\nBut Master Nathaniel was indifferent to these manifestations of\r\nunpopularity. Let mental suffering be intense enough, and it becomes a\r\nsort of carminative.\r\n\r\nWhen the news first reached him of the flight of the Crabapple Blossoms\r\nhe very nearly went off his head. Facts suddenly seemed to be becoming\r\nreal.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life his secret shadowy fears began to\r\nsolidify--to find a real focus; and the focus was Ranulph.\r\n\r\nHis first instinct was to fling municipal obligations to the winds\r\nand ride post-haste to the farm. But what would that serve after all?\r\nIt would be merely playing into the hands of his enemies, and by his\r\nflight giving the public reason to think that the things that were said\r\nabout him were true.\r\n\r\nIt would be madness, too, to bring Ranulph back to Lud. Surely there\r\nwas no place in Dorimare more fraught with danger for the boy these\r\ndays than was the fairy fruit-stained town of Lud. He felt like a rat\r\nin a trap.\r\n\r\nHe continued to receive cheerful letters from Ranulph himself and good\r\naccounts of him from Luke Hempen, and gradually his panic turned into\r\na sort of lethargic nightmare of fatalism, which seemed to free him\r\nfrom the necessity of taking action. It was as if the future were a\r\ntreacly adhesive fluid that had been spilt all over the present, so\r\nthat everything he touched made his fingers too sticky to be of the\r\nslightest use.\r\n\r\nHe found no comfort in his own home. Dame Marigold, who had always\r\ncared for Prunella much more than for Ranulph, was in a condition of\r\nnervous prostration.\r\n\r\nEach time the realization swept over her that Prunella had eaten fairy\r\nfruit and was either lost in the Elfin Marches or in Fairyland itself,\r\nshe would be seized by nausea and violent attacks of vomiting.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the only moments of relief he knew were in pacing up and down\r\nhis own pleached alley, or wandering in the Fields of Grammary. For\r\nthe Fields of Grammary gave him a foretaste of death--the state that\r\nwill turn one into a sort of object of art (that is to say if one is\r\nremembered by posterity) with all one\'s deeds and passions simplified,\r\nfrozen into beauty; an absolutely silent thing that people gaze at,\r\nand that cannot in its turn gaze back at them.\r\n\r\nAnd the pleached alley brought him the peace of still life--life that\r\nneither moves nor suffers, but only grows in silence and slowly matures\r\nin secret.\r\n\r\nThe Silent People! How he would have liked to be one of them!\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, as he wandered in the late afternoon about the streets\r\nof the town, human beings themselves seemed to have found the secret\r\nof still life. For at that hour all living things seemed to cease from\r\nfunctioning. The tradesmen would stand at the doors of their shops\r\nstaring with vacant eyes down the street--as detached from business as\r\nthe flowers in the gardens, which looked as if they too were resting\r\nafter their day\'s work and peeping idly out from between their green\r\nshutters.\r\n\r\nAnd lads who were taking their sweethearts for a row on the Dapple\r\nwould look at them with unseeing eyes, while the maidens gazed into the\r\ndistance and trailed their hands absently in the water.\r\n\r\nEven the smithy, with its group of loungers at its open door,\r\nwatching the swing and fall of the smith\'s hammer and the lurid red\r\nlight illuminating his face, might have been no more than a tent at\r\na fair where holiday makers were watching a lion tamer or the feats\r\nof a professional strong man; for at that desultory hour the play of\r\nmuscles, the bending of resisting things to a human will, the taming\r\nof fire, a creature more beautiful and dangerous than any lion, seemed\r\nmerely an entertaining spectacle that served no useful purpose.\r\n\r\nThe very noises of the street--the rattle of wheels, a lad whistling,\r\na pedlar crying his wares--seemed to come from far away, to be as\r\ndisembodied and remote from the activities of man as is the song of the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nAnd if there was still some bustle in the High Street it was as\r\nsoothing as that of a farmyard. And the whole street--houses, cobbles,\r\nand all--might almost have been fashioned out of growing things cut\r\nby man into patterns, as is a formal garden. So that Master Nathaniel\r\nwould wander, at that hour, between its rows of shops and houses, as if\r\nbetween the thick green walls of a double hedge of castellated box, or\r\ndown the golden tunnel of his own pleached alley.\r\n\r\nIf life in Lud-in-the-Mist could always be like that there would be no\r\nneed to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                             HEMPIE\'S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were days, however, when even the silent things did not soothe\r\nMaster Nathaniel; when the condition described by Ranulph as the\r\nimprisoning of all one\'s being into a space as narrow as a tooth,\r\nwhence it irradiates waves of agony, became so overwhelming, that he\r\nwas unconscious of the external world.\r\n\r\nOne late afternoon, a prey to this mood, he was mooning about the\r\nFields of Grammary.\r\n\r\nIn the epitaphs on the tombstone one could read the history of\r\nDorimarite sensibility from the quiet poignancy of those dating from\r\nthe days of the Dukes--"Eglantine mourns for Endymion, who was Alive\r\nand now is Dead;" or "During her Life Ambrose often dreamed that\r\nForget-Me-Not was Dead. This Time he woke up and found that it was\r\nTrue"--followed by the peaceful records of industry and prosperity of\r\nthe early days of the Republic, down to the cheap cynicism of recent\r\ntimes--for instance, "Here lies Hyacinth Quirkscuttle, weaver, who\r\nstretched his life as he was wont to do the list of his cloth far\r\nbeyond its natural limits, and, to the great regret of his family, died\r\nat the age of XCIX."\r\n\r\nBut, that afternoon, even his favourite epitaph, the one about\r\nthe old baker, Ebeneezor Spike, who had provided the citizens of\r\nLud-in-the-Mist with fresh sweet loaves for sixty years, was powerless\r\nto comfort Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so strangled was he in the coils of his melancholy that the\r\ncurious fact of the door of his family chapel being ajar caused in him\r\nnothing but a momentary, muffled surprise.\r\n\r\nThe chapel of the Chanticleers was one of the loveliest monuments of\r\nLud. It was built of rose-coloured marble, with delicately fluted\r\npillars, and worked in low relief with the flowers and panic stricken\r\nfugitives, so common in the old art of Dorimare. Indeed, it looked like\r\nan exquisite little pleasure-house; and tradition said that this it had\r\noriginally been--one of Duke Aubrey\'s, in fact. And it certainly was in\r\naccordance with his legend to make a graveyard the scene of his revels.\r\n\r\nNo one ever entered except Master Nathaniel and his household to\r\nfill it with flowers on the anniversaries of his parents\' death.\r\nNevertheless, the door was certainly ajar.\r\n\r\nThe only comment he made to himself was to suppose that the pious\r\nHempie had been up that day to commemorate some anniversary,\r\nremembered only by herself, in the lives of her dead master and\r\nmistress, and had forgotten to lock it up again.\r\n\r\nDrearily he wandered to the western wall and gazed down upon\r\nLud-in-the-Mist, and so drugged was he with despair that at first he\r\nwas incapable of reacting in the slightest degree to what his eyes were\r\nseeing.\r\n\r\nThen, just as sometimes the flowing of the Dapple was reflected in the\r\ntrunks of the beeches that grew on its banks, so that an element that\r\nlooked as if it were half water, half light, seemed rippling down them\r\nin ceaseless zones--so did the objects he saw beneath him begin to be\r\nreflected in fancies, rippling down the hard, unyielding fabric of his\r\nwoe; the red-roofed houses scattered about the side of the hill looked\r\nas if they were crowding helter-skelter to the harbour, eager to turn\r\nships themselves and sail away--a flock of clumsy ducks on a lake of\r\nswans; the houses beyond the harbour seemed to be preening themselves\r\npreparatory to having their portrait taken. The chimneys were casting\r\nbecoming velvet shadows on the high-pitched slanting roofs. The\r\nbelfries seemed to be standing on tiptoe behind the houses--like tall\r\nserving lads, who, unbeknown to their masters, have succeeded in\r\nsqueezing themselves into the family group.\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, the houses were more like a flock of barn-door fowls,\r\nof different shapes and sizes, crowding up at the hen wife\'s "Chick!\r\nchick! chick!" to be fed at sunset.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, however innocent they might look, they were the repositories\r\nof whatever dark secrets Lud might contain. Houses counted among the\r\nSilent People. Walls have ears, but no tongue. Houses, trees, the\r\ndead--they tell no tales.\r\n\r\nHis eye travelled beyond the town to the country that lay beyond,\r\nand rested on the fields of poppies and golden stubble, the smoke of\r\ndistant hamlets, the great blue ribbon of the Dawl, the narrow one of\r\nthe Dapple--one coming from the north, one from the west, but, for\r\nsome miles beyond Lud-in-the-Mist, seeming to flow in parallel lines,\r\nso that their convergence at the harbour struck one as a geometrical\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\nOnce more he began to feel the balm of silent things, and seemed to\r\ncatch a glimpse of that still, quiet landscape the future, after he\r\nhimself had died.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... there was that old superstition of the thraldom in\r\nFairyland, the labour in the fields of gillyflowers.\r\n\r\nNo, no. Old Ebeneezor Spike was not a thrall in Fairyland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe left the Fields of Grammary in a gentler mood of melancholy than the\r\nfrost-bound despair in which he had gone there.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home he found Dame Marigold sitting dejectedly in the\r\nparlour, her hands lying limply on her lap, and she had had the fire\r\nalready lighted although evening had not yet set in.\r\n\r\nShe was very white, and there were violet shadows under her eyes.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel stood silently at the door for a few seconds watching\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThere came into his head the lines of an old song of Dorimare:--\r\n\r\n    I\'ll weaver her a wreath of the flowers of grief\r\n    That her beauty may show the brighter.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he saw her with the glamour on her that used to madden\r\nhim in the days of his courtship, the glamour of something that is\r\ndelicate, and shadowy, and far-away--the glamour that lets loose the\r\nlust of the body of a man for the soul of a woman.\r\n\r\n"Marigold," he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHer lips curled in a little contemptuous smile: "Well, Nat, have you\r\nbeen out baying the moon, and chasing your own shadow?"\r\n\r\n"Marigold!" and he came and leaned over the back of her chair.\r\n\r\nShe started violently. Then she cried in a voice, half petulant, half\r\napologetic, "I\'m sorry! But, you know, I can\'t bear having the back of\r\nmy neck touched! Oh, Nat, what a sentimental old thing you are!"\r\n\r\nAnd then it all began over again--the vain repinings, the veiled\r\nreproaches; while the desire to make him wince struggled for the\r\nascendancy with the habit of mercy, engendered by years of a mild,\r\nslightly contemptuous tenderness.\r\n\r\nHer attitude to the calamity was one of physical disgust, mingled with\r\npetulance, a sense of ill-usage, and, incredible though it may seem, a\r\nsense of its ridiculous aspect.\r\n\r\nOccasionally she would stop shuddering, to make some such remark as:\r\n"Oh, dear! I can\'t help wishing that old Primrose herself had gone off\r\nwith them, and that I could have seen her prancing to the fiddle and\r\nscreeching like an old love-sick tabby cat."\r\n\r\nFinally Master Nathaniel could stand it no longer. He sprang to his\r\nfeet, exclaiming violently: "Marigold, you madden me! You\'re ... you\'re\r\nnot a woman. I believe what you need is some of that fruit yourself.\r\nI\'ve a good mind to get some, and force it down your throat!"\r\n\r\nBut it was an outrageous thing to have said. And no sooner were the\r\nwords out of his mouth than he would have given a hundred pounds to\r\nhave them unsaid.\r\n\r\nWhat had taken his tongue! It was as if an old trusty watch-dog had\r\nsuddenly gone mad and bitten him.\r\n\r\nBut he could stay no longer in the parlour, and face her cold,\r\ndisgusted stare. So, sheepishly mumbling an apology, he left the room.\r\n\r\nWhere should he go? Not to the pipe-room. He could not face the\r\nprospect of his own company. So he went upstairs and knocked at\r\nHempie\'s door.\r\n\r\nHowever much in childhood a man may have loved his nurse, it is seldom\r\nthat, after he has grown up, he does not feel ill at ease and rather\r\nbored when he is with her. A relationship that has become artificial,\r\nand connected, on one side, with a sense of duty rather than with\r\nspontaneous affection, is always an uncomfortable one.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the nurse, it is particularly bitter when it is the\r\nmagnanimous enemy--the wife--who has to keep her "boy" up to his duty.\r\n\r\nFor years Dame Marigold had had to say at intervals, "Nat, have you\r\nbeen up to see Hempie lately?" or "Nat, Hempie has lost one of her\r\nbrothers. Do go and tell her you\'re sorry."\r\n\r\nSo, when Master Nathaniel found himself in the gay little room, he felt\r\nawkward and tongue-tied, and was too depressed to have recourse to\r\nthe somewhat laboured facetiousness with which he was in the habit of\r\ngreeting the old woman.\r\n\r\nShe was engaged in darning his stockings, and she indignantly showed\r\nhim a particularly big hole, shaking her head, and exclaiming, "There\r\nnever was a man so hard on his stockings as you, Master Nat! I\'d very\r\nmuch like to find out before I die what you do to them; and Master\r\nRanulph is every bit as bad."\r\n\r\n"Well, Hempie, as I always say, you\'ve no right to blame me if my\r\nstockings go into holes, seeing that it\'s you who knitted them,"\r\nretorted Master Nathaniel automatically.\r\n\r\nFor years Hempie\'s scolding about the condition in which she found his\r\nstockings had elicited this reply. But, after these days of nightmare,\r\nthere was something reassuring in discovering that there were still\r\npeople in the world sane enough, and with quiet enough minds, to be put\r\nout by the holes in a pair of worsted stockings.\r\n\r\nHempie had, indeed, taken the news of the Crabapple Blossoms very\r\ncalmly. It was true she had never cared very much for Prunella,\r\nmaintaining always that "she was just her mother over again." All the\r\nsame, Prunella remained Master Nathaniel\'s daughter and Ranulph\'s\r\nsister, and hence had a certain borrowed preciousness in the eyes of\r\nHempie. Nevertheless she had refused to indulge in lamentations, and\r\nhad preserved on the subject a rather grim silence.\r\n\r\nHis eye roved restlessly over the familiar room. It was certainly\r\na pleasant one--fantastic and exquisitely neat. "Neat as a Fairy\'s\r\nparlour"--the old Dorimarite expression came unbidden to his mind.\r\n\r\nThere was a bowl of autumn roses on the table, faintly scenting the air\r\nwith the hospitable, poetic perfume that is like a welcome to a little\r\nhouse with green shutters and gay chintzes and lavender-scented sheets.\r\nBut the host who welcomes you is dead, the house itself no longer\r\nstands except in your memory--it is the cry of the cock turned into\r\nperfume. Are there bowls of roses in the Fairies\' parlours?\r\n\r\n"I say, Hempie, these are new, aren\'t they?" he said, pointing to a\r\ncase of shells on the chimney-piece--very strange shells, as thin as\r\nbutterfly\'s wings and as brightly coloured. And, as well, there were\r\nporcelain pots, which looked as if they had been made out of the petals\r\nof poppies and orchids, nor could their strange shapes ever have been\r\nturned on a potter\'s wheel in Dorimare.\r\n\r\nThen he gave a low whistle, and, pointing to a horse-shoe of pure gold,\r\nnailed on to the wall, he added, "And that, too! I\'ll swear I\'ve never\r\nseen it before. Has your ship come in, Hempie?"\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked up placidly from her darning: "Oh! these came when\r\nmy poor brother died and the old home was broken up. I\'m glad to have\r\nthem, as I never remember a time when they weren\'t in the old kitchen\r\nat home. I often think it\'s strange how bits of chiney and brittle\r\nstuff like that lives on, long after solid flesh and bone has turned\r\nto dust. And it\'s a queer thing, Master Nat, as one gets old, how one\r\nlives among the dumb. Bits of chiney ... and the Silent People," and\r\nshe wiped a couple of tears from her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen she added, "Where these old bits of things came from I never\r\nrightly knew. I suppose the horse-shoe\'s valuable, but even in bad\r\nharvests my poor father would never turn it into money. He used to\r\nsay that it had been above our door in his father\'s time, and in his\r\ngrandfather\'s time, and it had best stay there. I shouldn\'t wonder if\r\nhe thought it had been dropped by Duke Aubrey\'s horse. And as for the\r\nshells and pots ... when we were children, we used always to whisper\r\nthat they came from beyond the hills."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel gave a start, and stared at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n"From beyond the hills?" he repeated, in a low, horrified voice.\r\n\r\n"Aye, and why not?" cried Hempie, undaunted. "I was country-bred,\r\nMaster Nat, and I learned not to mind the smell of a fox or of a civet\r\ncat ... or of a Fairy. They\'re mischievous creatures, I daresay,\r\nand best left alone. But though we can\'t always pick and choose our\r\nneighbours, neighbourliness is a virtue all the same. For my part, I\'d\r\nnever have chosen the Fairies for my neighbours--but they were chosen\r\nfor me. And we must just make the best of them."\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Hempie!" cried Master Nathaniel in a\r\nhorrified voice, "you don\'t know what you\'re talking about, you...."\r\n\r\n"Now, Master Nat, don\'t you try on your\r\nhoighty-toighty-his-Worship-the-Mayor-of-Lud-in-the-Mist-knock-you-down-and-be-thankful-for-small-mercies\r\nways with me!" cried Hempie, shaking her fist at him. "I know very well\r\nwhat I\'m talking about. Long, long ago I made up my mind about certain\r\nthings. But a good nurse must keep her mind to herself--if it\'s not the\r\nsame as that of her master and mistress. So I never let on to you when\r\nyou were a little boy, nor to Master Ranulph neither, what I thought\r\nabout these things. But I\'ve never held with fennel and such like. If\r\nfolks know they\'re not wanted, it just makes them all the more anxious\r\nto come--be they Fairies or Dorimarites. It\'s just because we\'re all\r\nso scared of our neighbours that we get bamboozled by them. And I\'ve\r\nalways held that a healthy stomach could digest anything--even fairy\r\nfruit. Look at my boy, now, at Ranulph--young Luke writes he\'s never\r\nlooked so bonny. No, fairy fruit nor nothing else can poison a clean\r\nstomach."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Master Nathaniel drily. He was fighting against the sense\r\nof comfort that, in spite of himself, her words were giving him. "And\r\nare you quite happy, too, about Prunella?"\r\n\r\n"Well, and even if I\'m not," retorted Hempie, "where\'s the good of\r\ncrying, and retching, and belching, all day long, like your lady\r\ndownstairs? Life has its sad side, and we must take the rough with the\r\nsmooth. Why, maids have died on their marriage eve, or, what\'s worse,\r\nbringing their first baby into the world, and the world\'s wagged on all\r\nthe same. Life\'s sad enough, in all conscience, but there\'s nothing to\r\nbe frightened about in it or to turn one\'s stomach. I was country-bred,\r\nand as my old granny used to say, \'There\'s no clock like the sun and\r\nno calendar like the stars.\' And why? Because it gets one used to the\r\nlook of Time. There\'s no bogey from over the hills that scares one like\r\nTime. But when one\'s been used all one\'s life to seeing him naked, as\r\nit were, instead of shut up in a clock, like he is in Lud, one learns\r\nthat he is as quiet and peaceful as an old ox dragging the plough. And\r\nto watch Time teaches one to sing. They say the fruit from over the\r\nhills makes one sing. I\'ve never tasted so much as a sherd of it, but\r\nfor all that I can sing."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, all the pent-up misery and fear of the last thirty years\r\nseemed to be loosening in Master Nathaniel\'s heart--he was sobbing,\r\nand Hempie, with triumphant tenderness, was stroking his hands and\r\nmurmuring soothing words, as she had done when he was a little boy.\r\n\r\nWhen his sobs had spent themselves, he sat down on a stool at her feet,\r\nand, leaning his head against her knees, said, "Sing to me, Hempie."\r\n\r\n"Sing to you, my dear? And what shall I sing to you? My voice isn\'t\r\nwhat it once was ... well, there\'s that old song--\'Columbine,\' I think\r\nthey call it--that they always seem singing in the streets these\r\ndays--that\'s got a pretty tune."\r\n\r\nAnd in a voice, cracked and sweet, like an old spinet, she began to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n    "When Aubrey did live there lived no poor.\r\n    The lord and the beggar on roots did dine\r\n    With lily, germander, and sops in wine.\r\n    With sweet-brier,\r\n    And bon-fire,\r\n    And strawberry-wire,\r\n    And columbine."\r\n\r\nAs she sang, Master Nathaniel again heard the Note. But, strange to\r\nsay, this time it held no menace. It was as quiet as trees and pictures\r\nand the past, as soothing as the drip of water, as peaceful as the\r\nlowing of cows returning to the byre at sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                    A STRONGER ANTIDOTE THAN REASON\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel sat at his old nurse\'s feet for some minutes after she\r\nhad stopped singing. Both his limbs and his mind seemed to be bathed in\r\na cool, refreshing pool.\r\n\r\nSo Endymion Leer and Hempie had reached by very different paths the\r\nsame conclusion--that, after all, there was nothing to be frightened\r\nabout; that, neither in sky, sea, nor earth was there to be found a\r\ncavern dark and sinister enough to serve as a lair for IT--his secret\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nYes, but there were facts as well as shadows. Against facts Hempie had\r\ngiven him no charm. Supposing that what had happened to Prunella should\r\nhappen to Ranulph? That he should vanish for ever across the Debatable\r\nHills.\r\n\r\nBut it had not happened yet--nor should it happen as long as Ranulph\'s\r\nfather had wits and muscles.\r\n\r\nHe might be a poor, useless creature when menaced by the figments of\r\nhis own fancy. But, by the Golden Apples of the West, he would no\r\nlonger sit there shaking at shadows, while, perhaps, realities were\r\nmustering their battalions against Ranulph.\r\n\r\nIt was for him to see that Dorimare became a country that his son could\r\nlive in in security.\r\n\r\nIt was as if he had suddenly seen something white and straight--a\r\nroad or a river--cutting through a sombre, moonlit landscape. And the\r\nstraight, white thing was his own will to action.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet and took two or three paces up and down the room.\r\n\r\n"But I tell you, Hempie," he cried, as if continuing a conversation,\r\n"they\'re all against me. How can I work by myself! They\'re all against\r\nme, I say."\r\n\r\n"Get along with you, Master Nat!" jeered Hempie tenderly. "You were\r\nalways one to think folks were against you. When you were a little boy\r\nit was always, \'You\'re not cross with me, Hempie, are you?\' and peering\r\nup at me with your little anxious eyes--and there was me with no more\r\nidea of being cross with you than of jumping over the moon!"\r\n\r\n"But, I tell you, they are all against me," he cried impatiently. "They\r\nblame me for what has happened, and Ambrose was so insulting that I had\r\nto tell him never to put his foot into my house again."\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t the first time you and Master Ambrose have\r\nquarrelled--and it won\'t be the first time you make it up again. It\r\nwas, \'Hempie, Brosie won\'t play fair!\' or \'Hempie, it\'s my turn for a\r\nride on the donkey, and Nat won\'t let me!\' And then, in a few minutes,\r\nit was all over and forgotten. So you must just step across to Master\r\nAmbrose\'s, and walk in as if nothing had happened, and, you\'ll see,\r\nhe\'ll be as pleased as Punch to see you."\r\n\r\nAs he listened, he realized that it would be very pleasant to put\r\nhis pride in his pocket and rush off to Ambrose and say that he was\r\nwilling to admit anything that Ambrose chose--that he was a hopelessly\r\ninefficient Mayor, that his slothfulness during these past months had\r\nbeen criminal--even, if Ambrose insisted, that he was an eater of, and\r\nsmuggler of, and receiver of, fairy fruit, all rolled into one--if only\r\nAmbrose would make friends again.\r\n\r\nPride and resentment are not indigenous to the human heart; and perhaps\r\nit is due to the gardener\'s innate love of the exotic that we take such\r\npains to make them thrive.\r\n\r\nBut Master Nathaniel was a self-indulgent man, and ever ready to\r\nsacrifice both dignity and expediency to the pleasure of yielding to a\r\nsentimental velleity.\r\n\r\n"By the Golden Apples of the West, Hempie," he cried joyfully, "you\'re\r\nright! I\'ll dash across to Ambrose\'s before I\'m a minute older," and he\r\nmade eagerly for the door.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold he suddenly remembered how he had seen the door of\r\nhis chapel ajar, and he paused to ask Hempie if she had been up there\r\nrecently, and had forgotten to lock it.\r\n\r\nBut she had not been there since early spring.\r\n\r\n"That\'s odd!" said Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nAnd then he dismissed the matter from his mind, in the exhilarating\r\nprospect of "making up" with Ambrose.\r\n\r\nIt is curious what tricks a quarrel, or even a short absence, can\r\nplay with our mental picture of even our most intimate friends. A few\r\nminutes later, as Master Ambrose looked at his old playmate standing\r\nat the door, grinning a little sheepishly, he felt as if he had just\r\nawakened from a nightmare. This was not "the most criminally negligent\r\nMayor with whom the town of Lud-in-the-Mist had ever been cursed;"\r\nstill less was it the sinister figure evoked by Endymion Leer. It was\r\njust queer old Nat, whom he had known all his life.\r\n\r\nJust as on a map of the country round Lud, in the zig-zagging lines he\r\ncould almost see the fish and rushes of the streams they represented,\r\ncould almost count the milestones on the straight lines that stood for\r\nroads; so, with regard to the face of his old friend--every pucker and\r\nwrinkle was so familiar that he felt he could have told you every one\r\nof the jokes and little worries of which they were the impress.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, still grinning a little sheepishly, stuck out his\r\nhand. Master Ambrose frowned, blew his nose, tried to look severe, and\r\nthen grasped the hand. And they stood there fully two minutes, wringing\r\neach other\'s hand, and laughing and blinking to keep away the tears.\r\n\r\nAnd then Master Ambrose said, "Come into the pipe-room, Nat, and try a\r\nglass of my new flower-in-amber. You old rascal, I believe it was that\r\nthat brought you!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little later when Master Ambrose was conducting Master Nathaniel back\r\nto his house, his arm linked in his, they happened to pass Endymion\r\nLeer.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds he stood staring after them as they glimmered down\r\nthe lane beneath the faint moonlight. And he did not look overjoyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night was filled to the brim for Master Nathaniel with sweet,\r\ndreamless sleep. As soon as he laid his head on the pillow he seemed\r\nto dive into some pleasant unknown element--fresher than air, more\r\ncaressing than water; an element in which he had not bathed since he\r\nfirst heard the Note, thirty years ago. And he woke up the next morning\r\nlight-hearted and eager; so fine a medicine was the will to action.\r\n\r\nHe had been confirmed in it by his talk the previous evening with\r\nMaster Ambrose. He had found his old friend by no means crushed by his\r\ngrief. In fact, his attitude to the loss of Moonlove rather shocked\r\nMaster Nathaniel, for he had remarked grimly that to have vanished for\r\never over the hills was perhaps, considering the vice to which she had\r\nsuccumbed, the best thing that could have happened to her. There had\r\nalways been something rather brutal about Ambrose\'s common sense.\r\n\r\nBut he was as anxious as Master Nathaniel himself that drastic measures\r\nshould immediately be taken for stopping the illicit trade and\r\narresting the smugglers. They had decided what these measures ought\r\nto be, and the following days were spent in getting them approved and\r\npassed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThough the name of Master Nathaniel stank in the nostrils of his\r\ncolleagues, their respect for the constitution was too deep seated\r\nto permit their opposing the Mayor of Lud-in-the-Mist and High\r\nSeneschal of Dorimare; besides, Master Ambrose Honeysuckle was a man of\r\nconsiderable weight in their councils, and they were not uninfluenced\r\nby the fact that he was the seconder of all the Mayor\'s proposals.\r\n\r\nSo a couple of Yeomen were placed at each of the gates of Lud, with\r\norders to examine not only the baggage of everyone entering the town,\r\nbut, as well, to rummage through every waggon of hay, every sack of\r\nflour, every frail of fruit or vegetables. As well, the West road\r\nwas patrolled from Lud to the confines of the Elfin Marches, where a\r\nconsignment of Yeomanry were sent to camp out, with orders day and\r\nnight to watch the hills. And the clerk to the Senate was ordered to\r\ncompile a dossier of every inhabitant of Lud.\r\n\r\nThe energy displayed by Master Nathaniel in getting these measures\r\npassed did a good deal towards restoring his reputation among the\r\ntownsfolk. Nevertheless that social barometer, Ebeneezor Prim,\r\ncontinued to send his new apprentice, instead of coming himself,\r\nto wind his clocks. And the grandfather clock, it would seem, was\r\nprotesting against the slight. For according to the servants, it would\r\nsuddenly move its hands rapidly up and down its dial, which made it\r\nlook like a face, alternating between a smirk and an expression of woe.\r\nAnd one morning Pimple, the little indigo page, ran screaming with\r\nterror into the kitchen, for, he vowed, from the orifice at the bottom\r\nof the dial, there had suddenly come shooting out a green tongue like a\r\nlizard\'s tail.\r\n\r\nAs none of Master Nathaniel\'s measures brought to light a single\r\nsmuggler or a single consignment of fairy fruit, the Senate were\r\nbeginning to congratulate themselves on having at last destroyed the\r\nevil that for centuries had menaced their country, when Mumchance\r\ndiscovered in one day three people clearly under the influence of the\r\nmysterious drug and with their mouth and hands stained with strangely\r\ncoloured juices.\r\n\r\nOne of them was a pigmy pedlar from the North, and as he scarcely knew\r\na word of Dorimarite no information could be extracted from him as\r\nto how he had procured the fruit. Another was a little street urchin\r\nwho had found some sherds in a dustbin, but was in too dazed a state\r\nto remember exactly where. The third was the deaf-mute known as Bawdy\r\nBess. And, of course, no information could be got from a deaf-mute.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, there was some leakage in the admirable system of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nAs a result, rebellious lampoons against the inefficient Mayor were\r\nfound nailed to the doors of the Guildhall, and Master Nathaniel\r\nreceived several anonymous letters of a vaguely threatening nature,\r\nbidding him to cease to meddle with matters that did not concern him,\r\nlest they should prove to concern him but too much.\r\n\r\nBut so well had the antidote of action been agreeing with his\r\nconstitution that he merely flung them into the fire with a grim laugh\r\nand a vow to redouble his efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n              DAME MARIGOLD HEARS THE TAP OF A WOODPECKER\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose Crabapple\'s trial was still dragging on, clogged by all\r\nthe foolish complications arising from the legal fiction that had\r\npermitted her arrest. If you remember, in the eye of the law fairy\r\nfruit was regarded as woven silk, and many days were wasted in a\r\nlearned discussion of the various characteristics of gold tissues,\r\nstick tuftaffities, figured satins, wrought grograines, silk mohair and\r\nferret ribbons.\r\n\r\nUrged partly by curiosity and, perhaps, also by a subconscious hope\r\nthat in the comic light of Miss Primrose\'s personality recent events\r\nmight lose something of their sinister horror, one morning Dame\r\nMarigold set out to visit her old schoolmistress in her captivity.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had left the house since the tragedy, and,\r\nas she walked down the High Street she held her head high and smiled a\r\nlittle scornful smile--just to show the vulgar herd that even the worst\r\ndisgrace could not break the spirit of a Vigil.\r\n\r\nNow, Dame Marigold had very acute senses. Many a time she had\r\nastonished Master Nathaniel by her quickness in detecting the faintest\r\nwhiff of any of the odours she disliked--shag, for instance, or onions.\r\n\r\nShe was equally quick in psychological matters, and would detect the\r\nexistence of a quarrel or love affair long before they were known to\r\nanyone except the parties concerned. And as she made her way that\r\nmorning to the Guildhall she became conscious in everything that was\r\ngoing on round her of what one can only call a change of key.\r\n\r\nShe could have sworn that the baker\'s boy with the tray of loaves on\r\nhis head was not whistling, that the maid-servant, leaning out of a\r\nwindow to tend her mistress\'s pot-flowers, was not humming the same\r\ntune that they would have been some months ago.\r\n\r\nThis, perhaps, was natural enough. Tunes, like fruit, have their\r\nseasons, and are, besides, ever forming new species. But even the\r\nvoices of the hawkers chanting "Yellow Sand!" or "Knives and Scissors!"\r\nsounded disconcertingly different.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, Dame Marigold\'s delicate nostrils expanded, and the\r\ncorners of her mouth turned down in an expression of disgust, as if she\r\nhad caught a whiff of a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Guildhall, she carried matters with a high hand. No,\r\nno, there was no need whatever to disturb his Worship. He had given\r\nher permission to visit the prisoner, so would the guardian take her\r\nup immediately to her room.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold was one of those women who, though they walk blindfold\r\nthrough the fields and woods, if you place them between four walls have\r\neyes as sharp as a naturalist\'s for the objects that surround them. So,\r\nin spite of her depression, her eyes were very busy as she followed\r\nthe guardian up the splendid spiral staircase, and along the panelled\r\ncorridors, hung, here and there, with beautiful bits of tapestry. She\r\nmade a mental note to tell Master Nathaniel that the caretaker had not\r\nswept the staircase, and that some of the panelling was worm-eaten and\r\nshould be attended to. And she would pause to finger a corner of the\r\ntapestry and wonder if she could find some silk just that powder blue,\r\nor just that old rose, for her own embroidery.\r\n\r\n"Why, I do declare, this panel is beginning to go too!" she murmured,\r\npausing to tap on the wall.\r\n\r\nThen she cried in a voice of surprise, "I do believe it\'s hollow here!"\r\n\r\nThe guardian smiled indulgently--"You are just like the doctor,\r\nma\'am--Doctor Leer. We used to call him the Woodpecker, when he was\r\nstudying the Guildhall for his book, for he was for ever hopping about\r\nand tapping on the walls. It was almost as if he were looking for\r\nsomething, we used to say. And I\'d never be surprised myself to come on\r\na sliding panel. They do say as what those old Dukes were a wild crew,\r\nand it might have suited their book very well to have a secret way out\r\nof their place!" and he gave a knowing wink.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, it certainly might," said Dame Marigold, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThey had now come to a door padlocked and bolted. "This is where we\r\nhave put the prisoner, ma\'am," said the guardian, unlocking it. And\r\nthen he ushered her into the presence of her old schoolmistress.\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose was sitting bolt upright in a straight backed old\r\nfashioned chair, against a background of fine old tapestries, faded to\r\nthe softest loveliest pastel tints--as incongruous with her grotesque\r\nugliness as had been the fresh prettiness of the Crabapple Blossoms.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold stood staring at her for a few seconds in silent\r\nindignation. Then she sank slowly on to a chair, and said sternly,\r\n"Well, Miss Primrose? I wonder how you dare sit there so calmly after\r\nthe appalling thing you have brought about."\r\n\r\nBut Miss Primrose was in one of her most exalted moods--"On her high\r\nhobby-horse," as the Crabapple Blossoms used to call it. So she merely\r\nglittered at Dame Marigold contemptuously out of her little eyes,\r\nand, with a lordly wave of her hand, as if to sweep away from her\r\nall mundane trivialities, she exclaimed pityingly, "My poor blind\r\nMarigold! Perhaps of all the pupils who have passed through my hands\r\nyou are the one who are the least worthy of your noble birthright."\r\n\r\nDame Marigold bit her lip, raised her eyebrows, and said in a low voice\r\nof intense irritation, "What do you mean, Miss Primrose?"\r\n\r\nMiss Primrose cast her eyes up to the ceiling, and, in her most treacly\r\nvoice she answered, "The great privilege of having been born a woooman!"\r\n\r\nHer pupils always maintained that "woman," as pronounced by Miss\r\nPrimrose, was the most indecent word in the language.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold\'s eyes flashed: "I may not be a woman, but, at any rate,\r\nI am a mother--which is more than you are!" she retorted.\r\n\r\nThen, in a voice that at each word grew more indignant, she said, "And,\r\nMiss Primrose, do you consider that you yourself have been \'worthy of\r\nyour noble birthright\' in betraying the trust that has been placed\r\nin you? Are vice and horror and disgrace and breaking the hearts of\r\nparents \'true womanliness\' I should like to know? You are worse than\r\na murderer--ten times worse. And there you sit, gloating over what\r\nyou have done, as if you were a martyr or a public benefactor--as\r\ncomplacent and smug and misunderstood as a princess from the moon\r\nforced to herd goats! I do really believe...."\r\n\r\nBut Miss Primrose\'s shrillness screamed down her low-toned indignation:\r\n"Shake me! Stick pins in me! Fling me into the Dapple!" she shrieked.\r\n"I will bear it all with a smile, and wear my shame like a flower given\r\nby him!"\r\n\r\nDame Marigold groaned in exasperation: "Who, on earth, do you mean by\r\n\'him\', Miss Primrose?"\r\n\r\nThen her irrepressible sense of humour broke out in a dimple, and she\r\nadded: "Duke Aubrey or Endymion Leer?"\r\n\r\nFor, of course, Prunella had told her all the jokes about the goose and\r\nthe sage.\r\n\r\nAt this question Miss Primrose gave an unmistakable start; "Duke\r\nAubrey, of course!" she answered, but the look in her eyes was sly,\r\nsuspicious, and distinctly scared.\r\n\r\nNone of this was lost upon Dame Marigold. She looked her slowly up and\r\ndown with a little mocking smile; and Miss Primrose began to writhe and\r\nto gibber.\r\n\r\n"Hum!" said Dame Marigold, meditatively.\r\n\r\nShe had never liked the smell of Endymion Leer\'s personality.\r\n\r\nThe recent crisis had certainly done him no harm. It had doubled his\r\npractice, and trebled his influence.\r\n\r\nBesides, it cannot have been Miss Primrose\'s beauty and charms that had\r\ncaused him to pay her recently such marked attentions.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it could do no harm to draw a bow at a venture.\r\n\r\n"I am beginning to understand, Miss Primrose," she said slowly.\r\n"Two ... outsiders, have put their heads together to see if they\r\ncould find a plan for humiliating the stupid, stuck-up, \'so-called\r\nold families of Lud!\' Oh! don\'t protest, Miss Primrose. You have\r\nnever taken any pains to hide your contempt for us. And I have always\r\nrealized that yours was not a forgiving nature. Nor do I blame you. We\r\nhave laughed at you unmercifully for years--and you have resented it.\r\nAll the same I think your revenge has been an unnecessarily violent\r\none; though, I suppose, to \'a true woooman,\' nothing is too mean, too\r\nspiteful, too base, if it serves the interests of \'him\'!"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Primrose had gone as green as grass, and was gibbering with\r\nterror: "Marigold! Marigold!" she cried, wringing her hands, "How can\r\nyou think such things? The dear, devoted Doctor! The best and kindest\r\nman in Lud-in-the-Mist! Nobody was angrier with me over what he called\r\nmy \'criminal carelessness\' in allowing that horrible stuff to be\r\nsmuggled into my loft, I assure you he is quite rabid on the subject\r\nof ... er ... fruit. Why, when he was a young man at the time of the\r\ngreat drought he was working day and night trying to stop it, he...."\r\n\r\nBut not for nothing was Dame Marigold descended from generations of\r\njudges. Quick as lightning, she turned on her: "The great drought? But\r\nthat must be forty years ago ... long before Endymion Leer came to\r\nDorimare."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, dear ... of course ... quite so ... I was thinking of what\r\nanother doctor had told me ... since all this trouble my poor head gets\r\nquite muddled," gibbered Miss Primrose. And she was shaking from head\r\nto foot.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold rose from her chair, and stood looking down on her in\r\nsilence for a few seconds, under half-closed lids, with a rather cruel\r\nlittle smile.\r\n\r\nThen she said, "Good-bye, Miss Primrose. You have provided me with most\r\ninteresting food for thought."\r\n\r\nAnd then she left her, sitting there with frightened face against the\r\nfaded tapestry.\r\n\r\nThat same day, Master Nathaniel received a letter from Luke Hempen that\r\nboth perplexed and alarmed him.\r\n\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Your Worship,--I\'d be glad if you\'d take Master Ranulph away from\r\n    this farm, because the widow\'s up to mischief, I\'m sure of that,\r\n    and some of the folks about here say as what in years gone by she\r\n    murdered her husband, and she and somebody else, though I don\'t\r\n    know who, seem to have a grudge against Master Ranulph, and, if I\r\n    might take the liberty, I\'ll just tell your Worship what I heard.\r\n\r\n    It was this way--one night, I don\'t know how it was, but I couldn\'t\r\n    get to sleep, and thinking that a bite, may be, of something would\r\n    send me off, towards midnight I got up from my bed to go and look\r\n    in the kitchen for a bit of bread. And half-way down the stairs I\r\n    heard the sound of low voices, and someone said, "I fear the\r\n    Chanticleers," so I stood still where I was, and listened. And I\r\n    peeped down and the kitchen fire was nearly out, but there was\r\n    enough left for me to see the widow, and a man wrapped up in a\r\n    cloak, sitting opposite to her with his back to the stairs, so I\r\n    couldn\'t see his face. Their talk was low and at first I could only\r\n    hear words here and there, but they kept making mention of the\r\n    Chanticleers, and the man said something like keeping the\r\n    Chanticleers and Master Ambrose Honeysuckle apart, because Master\r\n    Ambrose had had a vision of Duke Aubrey. And if I hadn\'t known the\r\n    widow and how she was a deep one and as fly as you make them, I\'d\r\n    have thought they were two poor daft old gossips, whose talk had\r\n    turned wild and nasty with old age. And then the man laid his hand\r\n    on her knee, and his voice was low, but this time it was so clear\r\n    that I could hear it all, and I think I can remember every word of\r\n    it, so I\'ll write it down for your Worship: "I fear counter orders.\r\n    You know the Chief and his ways--at any moment he might betray his\r\n    agents. Willy Wisp gave young Chanticleer fruit without my\r\n    knowledge. And I told you how he and that doitered old weaver of\r\n    yours have been putting their heads together, and that\'s what has\r\n    frightened me most."\r\n\r\n    And then his voice became too low for me to hear, till he said,\r\n    "Those who go by the Milky Way often leave footprints. So let him\r\n    go by the other."\r\n\r\n    And then he got up to go, and I crept back to my room. But not a\r\n    wink of sleep did I get that night for thinking over what I had\r\n    heard. For though it seemed gibberish, it gave me the shivers, and\r\n    that\'s a fact. And mad folks are often as dangerous as bad ones, so\r\n    I hope your Worship will excuse me writing like this, and that\r\n    you\'ll favour me with an answer by return, and take Master Ranulph\r\n    away, for I don\'t like the look in the widow\'s eye when she looks\r\n    at him, that I don\'t.\r\n\r\n    And hoping this finds your Worship well as it leaves me,--I am,\r\n    Your Worship\'s humble obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                           LUKE HEMPEN.\r\n\r\nHow Master Nathaniel longed to jump on to his horse and ride post-haste\r\nto the farm! But that was impossible. Instead, he immediately\r\ndespatched a groom with orders to ride day and night and deliver a\r\nletter to Luke Hempen, which bade him instantly take Ranulph to the\r\nfarm near Moongrass (a village that lay some fifteen miles north of\r\nSwan-on-the-Dapple) from which for years he had got his cheeses.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down and tried to find some meaning in the mysterious\r\nconversation Luke had overheard.\r\n\r\nAmbrose seeing a vision! An unknown Chief! Footprints on the Milky Way!\r\n\r\nReality was beginning to become very shadowy and menacing.\r\n\r\nHe must find out something about this widow. Had she not once appeared\r\nin the law-courts? He decided he must look her up without a moment\'s\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nHe had inherited from his father a fine legal library, and the\r\nbookshelves in his pipe-room were packed with volumes bound in vellum\r\nand old calf of edicts, codes, and trials. Some of them belonged to\r\nthe days before printing had been introduced into Dorimare, and were\r\nwritten in the crabbed hand of old town-clerks.\r\n\r\nIt made the past very real, and threw a friendly, humourous light upon\r\nthe dead, to come upon, when turning those yellow parchment pages, some\r\npersonal touch of the old scribe\'s, such as a sententious or facetious\r\ninsertion of his own--for instance, "The Law bides her Time, but my\r\nDinner doesn\'t!" or the caricature in the margin of some forgotten\r\njudge. It was just as if one of the grotesque plaster heads on the old\r\nhouses were to give you, suddenly, a sly wink.\r\n\r\nBut it was the criminal trials that, in the past, had given Master\r\nNathaniel the keenest pleasure. The dry style of the Law was such a\r\nmagnificent medium for narrative. And the little details of every-day\r\nlife, the humble objects of daily use, became so startlingly vivid,\r\nwhen, like scarlet geraniums breaking through a thick autumn mist, they\r\nblazed out from that grey style ... so vivid, and, often, fraught with\r\nsuch tragic consequences.\r\n\r\nGreat was his astonishment when he discovered from the index that\r\nit was among the criminal trials that he must look for the widow\r\nGibberty\'s. What was more, it was a trial for murder.\r\n\r\nSurely Endymion Leer had told him, when he was urging him to send\r\nRanulph to the farm, that it had been a quite trivial case, concerning\r\nan arrear of wages, or something, due to a discharged servant?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the plaintiff, a labourer of the name of Diggory\r\nCarp, had been discharged from the service of the late Farmer Gibberty.\r\nBut the accusation he brought against the widow was that she had\r\npoisoned her husband with the sap of osiers.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he had finished the trial, Master Nathaniel found himself\r\nin complete sympathy with the judge\'s pronouncement that the widow was\r\ninnocent, and with his severe reprimand to the plaintiff, for having\r\nbrought such a serious charge against a worthy woman on such slender\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get Luke\'s letter out of his head, and he felt that he\r\nwould not have a moment\'s peace till the groom returned with news from\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nAs he sat that evening by the parlour fire, wondering for the hundredth\r\ntime who the mysterious cloaked stranger could have been whose back had\r\nbeen seen by Luke, Dame Marigold suddenly broke the silence by saying,\r\n"What do you know about Endymion Leer, Nat?"\r\n\r\n"What do I know of Endymion Leer?" he repeated absently. "Why, that\r\nhe\'s a very good leach, with very poor taste in cravats, and, if\r\npossible, worse taste in jokes. And that, for some unknown reason, he\r\nhas a spite against me...."\r\n\r\nHe broke off in the middle of his sentence, and muttered beneath his\r\nbreath, "By the Sun, Moon and Stars! Supposing it should be...."\r\n\r\nLuke\'s stranger had said he feared the Chanticleers.\r\n\r\nA strange fellow, Leer! The Note had once sounded in his voice. Where\r\ndid he come from? Who was he? Nobody knew in Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, there were his antiquarian tastes. They were generally\r\nregarded as a harmless, unprofitable hobby. And yet ... the past\r\nwas dim and evil, a heap of rotting leaves. The past was silent and\r\nbelonged to the Silent People.... But Dame Marigold was asking another\r\nquestion, a question that had no apparent connection with the previous\r\none: "What was the year of the great drought?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel answered that it was exactly forty years ago, and\r\nadded quizzically, "Why this sudden interest in history, Marigold?"\r\n\r\nAgain she answered by asking him a question. "And when did Endymion\r\nLeer first arrive in Dorimare?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel began to be interested. "Let me see," he said\r\nthoughtfully. "It was certainly long before we married. Yes, I\r\nremember, we called him in to a consultation when my mother had\r\npleurisy, and that was shortly after his arrival, for he could still\r\nonly speak broken Dorimarite ... it must be thirty years ago."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Dame Marigold drily. "But I happen to know that he was\r\nalready in Dorimare at the time of the drought." And she proceeded to\r\nrepeat to him her conversation that morning with Miss Primrose.\r\n\r\n"And," she added, "I\'ve got another idea," and she told him about the\r\npanel in the Guildhall that sounded hollow and what the guardian had\r\nsaid about the woodpecker ways of Endymion Leer. "And if, partly for\r\nrevenge for our coldness to him, and partly from a love of power," she\r\nwent on, "it is he who has been behind this terrible affair, a secret\r\npassage would be very useful in smuggling, and would explain how all\r\nyour precautions have been useless. And who would be more likely to\r\nknow about a secret passage in the Guildhall than Endymion Leer!"\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon and Stars!" exclaimed Master Nathaniel excitedly, "I\r\nshouldn\'t be surprised if you were right, Marigold. You\'ve got a head\r\non your shoulders with something in it more useful than porridge!"\r\n\r\nAnd Dame Marigold gave a little complacent smile.\r\n\r\nThen he sprang from his chair, "I\'m off to tell Ambrose!" he cried\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nBut would he be able to convince the slow and obstinate mind of Master\r\nAmbrose? Mere suspicions are hard to communicate. They are rather like\r\nthe wines that will not travel, and have to be drunk on the spot.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he could but try.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever had a vision of Duke Aubrey, Ambrose?" he cried,\r\nbursting into his friend\'s pipe-room.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose frowned with annoyance. "What are you driving at, Nat?"\r\nhe said, huffily.\r\n\r\n"Answer my question. I\'m not chaffing you, I\'m in deadly earnest. Have\r\nyou ever had a vision of Duke Aubrey?"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose moved uneasily in his chair. He was far from proud of\r\nthat vision of his. "Well," he said, gruffly, "I suppose one might call\r\nit that. It was at the Academy--the day that wretched girl of mine ran\r\naway. And I was so upset that there was some excuse for what you call\r\nvisions."\r\n\r\n"And did you tell anyone about it?"\r\n\r\n"Not I!" said Master Ambrose emphatically; then he caught himself up\r\nand added, "Oh! yes I believe I did though. I mentioned it to that\r\nspiteful little quack, Endymion Leer. I\'m sure I wish I hadn\'t. Toasted\r\nCheese! What\'s the matter now, Nat?"\r\n\r\nFor Master Nathaniel was actually cutting a caper of triumph and glee.\r\n\r\n"I was right! I was right!" he cried joyfully, so elated by his own\r\nacumen that for the moment his anxiety was forgotten.\r\n\r\n"Read that, Ambrose," and he eagerly thrust into his hands Luke\r\nHempen\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said Master Ambrose when he had finished it. "Well, what are\r\nyou so pleased about?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see, Ambrose!" cried Master Nathaniel impatiently. "That\r\nmysterious fellow in the cloak must be Endymion Leer ... nobody else\r\nknows about your vision."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Nat, blunt though my wits may be I see that. But I fail to\r\nsee how the knowledge helps us in any way." Then Master Nathaniel told\r\nhim about Dame Marigold\'s theories and discoveries.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose hummed and hawed, and talked about women\'s reasoning,\r\nand rash conclusions. But perhaps he was more impressed, really, than\r\nhe chose to let Master Nathaniel see. At any rate he grudgingly agreed\r\nto go with him by night to the Guildhall and investigate the hollow\r\npanel. And, from Master Ambrose, this was a great concession; for it\r\nwas not the sort of escapade that suited his dignity.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah, Ambrose!" shouted Master Nathaniel. "And I\'m ready to bet a\r\nMoongrass cheese against a flask of your best flower-in-amber that\r\nwe\'ll find that rascally quack at the bottom of it all!"\r\n\r\n"You\'d always a wonderful eye for a bargain, Nat," said Master Ambrose\r\nwith a grim chuckle. "Do you remember, when we were youngsters, how you\r\ngot my pedigree pup out of me for a stuffed pheasant, so moth-eaten\r\nthat it had scarcely a feather to its name, and, let me see, what else?\r\nI think there was a half a packet of mouldy sugar-candy...."\r\n\r\n"And I threw in a broken musical-box whose works used to go queer in\r\nthe middle of \'To War, Bold Sons of Dorimare,\' and burr and buzz like\r\na drunk cockchafer," put in Master Nathaniel proudly. "It was quite\r\nfair--quantity for quality."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                   WHAT MASTER NATHANIEL AND MASTER\r\n                    AMBROSE FOUND IN THE GUILDHALL\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was much too restless and anxious to explore the\r\nGuildhall until the groom returned whom he had sent with the letter to\r\nLuke Hempen.\r\n\r\nBut he must have taken the order to ride night and day literally--in\r\nso short a time was he back again in Lud. Master Nathaniel was, of\r\ncourse, enchanted by his despatch, though he was unable to elicit from\r\nhim any detailed answers to his eager questions about Ranulph. But it\r\nwas everything to know that the boy was well and happy, and it was\r\nbut natural that the fellow should be bashful and tongue-tied in the\r\npresence of his master.\r\n\r\nBut the groom had not, as a matter of fact, come within twenty miles of\r\nthe widow Gibberty\'s farm.\r\n\r\nIn a road-side tavern he had fallen in with a red-haired youth, who had\r\ntreated him to glass upon glass of an extremely intoxicating wine; and,\r\nin consequence, he had spent the night and a considerable portion of\r\nthe following morning sound asleep on the floor of the tavern.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he was horrified to discover how much time he had\r\nwasted. But his mind was set at rest on the innkeeper\'s giving him\r\na letter from the red-haired youth, to say that he deeply regretted\r\nhaving been the indirect cause of delaying a messenger sent on pressing\r\nbusiness by the High Seneschal (in his cup the groom had boasted of the\r\nimportance of his errand), and had, in consequence, ventured to possess\r\nhimself of the letter, which he guaranteed to deliver at the address\r\non the wrapper as soon, or sooner, as the messenger could have done\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe groom was greatly relieved. He had not been long in Master\r\nNathaniel\'s service. It was after Yule-tide he had entered it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo it was with a heart relieved from all fears for Ranulph and free\r\nto throb like a schoolboy\'s with the lust of adventure that Master\r\nNathaniel met Master Ambrose on the night of the full moon at the\r\nsplendid carved doors of the Guildhall.\r\n\r\n"I say, Ambrose," he whispered, "I feel as if we were lads again, and\r\noff to rob an orchard!"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose snorted. He was determined, at all costs, to do his\r\nduty, but it annoyed him that his duty should be regarded in the light\r\nof a boyish escapade.\r\n\r\nThe great doors creaked back on their hinges. Shutting them as quietly\r\nas they could, they tip-toed up the spiral staircase and along the\r\ncorridor described by Dame Marigold: whenever a board creaked under\r\ntheir heavy steps, one inwardly cursing the other for daring to be so\r\nstout and unwieldy.\r\n\r\nAll round them was darkness, except for the little trickles of light\r\ncast before them by their two lanthorns.\r\n\r\nA house with old furniture has no need of guests to be haunted. As\r\nwe have seen, Master Nathaniel was very sensitive to the silent\r\nthings--stars, houses, trees; and often in his pipe-room, after the\r\ncandles had been lit, he would sit staring at the bookshelves, the\r\nchairs, his father\'s portrait--even at his red umbrella standing up in\r\nthe corner, with as great a sense of awe as if he had been a star-gazer.\r\n\r\nBut that night, the brooding invisible presences of the carved panels,\r\nthe storied tapestries, affected even the hard-headed Master Ambrose.\r\nIt was as if that silent population was drawing him, by an irresistible\r\nmagnetism, into the zone of its influence.\r\n\r\nIf only they would speak, or begin to move about--those silent rooted\r\nthings! It was like walking through a wood by moonlight.\r\n\r\nThen Master Nathaniel stood still.\r\n\r\n"This, I think, must roughly be the spot where Marigold found the\r\nhollow panel," he whispered, and began tapping cautiously along the\r\nwainscotting.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, he said in an excited whisper, "Ambrose! Ambrose!\r\nI\'ve got it. Hark! You can hear, can\'t you? It\'s as hollow as a drum."\r\n\r\n"Suffering Cats! I believe you\'re right," whispered back Master\r\nAmbrose, beginning, in spite of himself, to be a little infected with\r\nNat\'s absurd excitement.\r\n\r\nAnd then, yielding to pressure, the panel slid back, and by the light\r\nof their lanthorns they could see a twisting staircase.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds they gazed at each other in silent triumph. Then\r\nMaster Nathaniel chuckled, and said, "Well, here goes--down with our\r\nbuckets into the well! And may we draw up something better than an\r\nold shoe or a rotten walnut!" and straightway he began to descend the\r\nstairs, Master Ambrose valiantly following him.\r\n\r\nThe stairs went twisting down, down--into the very bowels of the earth,\r\nit seemed. But at long last they found themselves in what looked like a\r\nlong tunnel.\r\n\r\n"Tally ho! Tally ho!" whispered Master Nathaniel, laughing for sheer\r\njoy of adventure, "take it at a gallop, Brosie; it may lead to an open\r\nglade ... and the deer at bay!"\r\n\r\nAnd digging him in the ribs, he added, "Better sport than moth hunting,\r\neh?" which showed the completeness of their reconciliation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was very slowly, and feeling each step, that they\r\ngroped their way along the tunnel.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed a very long time Master Nathaniel halted, and\r\nwhispered over his shoulder, "Here we are. There\'s a door ... oh,\r\nthunder and confusion on it for ever! It\'s locked."\r\n\r\nAnd, beside himself with irritation at this unlooked-for obstacle, he\r\nbegan to batter and kick at the door, like one demented.\r\n\r\nHe paused a minute for breath, and from the inside could be heard a\r\nshrill female voice demanding the pass-word.\r\n\r\n"Pass-word?" bellowed back Master Nathaniel, "by the Sun, Moon and\r\nStars and the Golden Apples of the West, what...."\r\n\r\nBut before he could finish his sentence, the door was opened from the\r\nother side, and they marched into a low, square room, which was lit by\r\none lamp swinging by a chain from the ceiling--for which there seemed\r\nbut little need, for a light more brilliant than that of any lamp, and\r\nyet as soft as moonlight, seemed to issue from the marvelous tapestries\r\nthat hung on the walls.\r\n\r\nThey were dumb with amazement. This was as different from all the other\r\ntapestry they had ever seen as is an apple-tree in full blossom against\r\na turquoise sky in May to the same tree in November, when only a few\r\nred leaves still cling to its branches, and the sky is leaden. Oh,\r\nthose blues, and pinks, and brilliant greens! In what miraculous dyes\r\nhad the silks been dipped?\r\n\r\nAs to the subjects, they were those familiar to every\r\nDorimarite--hunting scenes, fugitives chased by the moon, shepherds\r\nand shepherdesses tending their azure sheep. But, depicted in these\r\nbrilliant hues, they were like the ashes of the past, suddenly, under\r\none\'s very eyes, breaking into flame. Heigh-presto! The men and women\r\nof a vanished age, noisy, gaudy, dominant, are flooding the streets,\r\nand driving the living before them like dead leaves.\r\n\r\nAnd what was this lying in heaps on the floor? Pearls and sapphires,\r\nand monstrous rubies? Or windfalls of fruit, marvellous fruit, fallen\r\nfrom the trees depicted on the tapestry?\r\n\r\nThen, as their eyes grew accustomed to all the brilliance, the two\r\nfriends began to get their bearings; there could be no doubt as to the\r\nnature of that fruit lying on the floor. It was fairy fruit, or their\r\nnames were not respectively Chanticleer and Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\nAnd, to their amazement, the guardian of this strange treasure was none\r\nother than their old acquaintance Mother Tibbs.\r\n\r\nHer clear, child-like eyes that shone like lamps out of her seared\r\nweather-beaten face, were gazing at them in a sort of mild surprise.\r\n\r\n"If it isn\'t Master Hyacinth and Master Josiah!" she exclaimed, adding,\r\nwith her gay, young laugh, "to think of their knowing the pass-word!"\r\n\r\nThen she peered anxiously into their faces: "Are your stockings wearing\r\nwell yonder? The last pair I washed for you didn\'t take the soap as\r\nthey should. Marching down the Milky Way, and tripping it beyond the\r\nmoon, is hard on stockings."\r\n\r\nClearly she took them for their own fathers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Master Ambrose was drawing in his breath, with a noise as\r\nif he were eating soup, and creasing his double chins--sure signs, to\r\nanyone who had seen him on the Bench, that he was getting ready to\r\nhector.\r\n\r\nBut Master Nathaniel gave him a little warning nudge, and said\r\ncordially to their hostess, "Why, our stockings, and boots too, are\r\ndoing very nicely, thank you. So you didn\'t expect us to know the\r\npass-word, eh? Well, well, perhaps we know more than you think," then,\r\nunder his breath to Master Ambrose, "By my Great-aunt\'s Rump, Ambrose,\r\nwhat was the pass-word?"\r\n\r\nThen turning again to Mother Tibbs, who was slightly swaying from her\r\nhips, as if in time to some jig, which she alone could hear, he said,\r\n"You\'ve got some fine tapestry. I don\'t believe I\'ve ever seen finer!"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and then coming close up to him, said in a low voice,\r\n"Does your Worship know what makes it so fine? No? Why, it\'s the fairy\r\nfruit!" and she nodded her head mysteriously, several times.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose gave a sort of low growl of rage, but again Master\r\nNathaniel shot him a warning look, and said in a voice of polite\r\ninterest, "Indeed! Indeed! And where, may I ask, does the ... er ...\r\nfruit come from?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed merrily, "Why, the gentlemen bring it! All the pretty\r\ngentlemen, dressed in green, with their knots of ribands, crowding down\r\nin the sunrise from their ships with the scarlet sails to suck the\r\ngolden apricocks, when all in Lud are fast asleep! And then the cock\r\nsays Cockadoodledoo! Cockadoodledooooo!" and her voice trailed off,\r\nfar-away and lonely, suggesting, somehow, the first glimmer of dawn on\r\nghostly hayricks.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you something, Master Nat Cock o\' the Roost," she went\r\non, smiling mysteriously, and coming close up to him, "you\'ll soon be\r\ndead!"\r\n\r\nThen she stepped back, smiling and nodding encouragingly, as if to say,\r\n"There\'s a pretty present I\'ve given you! Take care of it."\r\n\r\n"And as for Mother Tibbs," she went on triumphantly, "she\'ll soon be a\r\nfine lady, like the wives of the Senators, dancing all night under the\r\nmoon! The gentlemen have promised."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose gave a snort of impatience, but Master Nathaniel said\r\nwith a good-humoured laugh, "So that\'s how you think the wives of the\r\nSenators spend their time, eh? I\'m afraid they\'ve other things to do.\r\nAnd as to yourself, aren\'t you getting too old for dancing?"\r\n\r\nA slight shadow passed across her clear eyes. Then she tossed her head\r\nwith the noble gesture of a wild creature, and cried, "No! No! As long\r\nas my heart dances my feet will too. And nobody will grow old when the\r\nDuke comes back."\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose could contain himself no longer. He knew only too\r\nwell Nat\'s love of listening to long rambling talk--especially when\r\nthere happened to be some serious business on hand.\r\n\r\n"Come, come," he cried in a stern voice, "in spite of being\r\ncrack-brained, my good woman, you may soon find yourself dancing to\r\nanother tune. Unless you tell us in double quick time who exactly these\r\ngentlemen are, and who it was that put you on guard here, and who\r\nbrings that filthy fruit, and who takes it away, we will ... why, we\r\nwill cut the fiddle strings that you dance to!"\r\n\r\nThis threat was a subconscious echo of the last words he had heard\r\nspoken by Moonlove. Its effect was instantaneous.\r\n\r\n"Cut the fiddle strings! Cut the fiddle strings!" she wailed; adding\r\ncoaxingly, "No, no, pretty master, you would never do that! Would he\r\nnow?" and she turned appealingly to Master Nathaniel. "It would be\r\nlike taking away the poor man\'s strawberries. The Senator has peaches\r\nand roasted swans and peacock\'s hearts, and a fine coach to drive in,\r\nand a feather bed to lie late in of a morning. And the poor man has\r\nblack bread and baked haws, and work ... but in the summer he has\r\nstrawberries and tunes to dance to. No, no, you would never cut the\r\nfiddle strings!"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel felt a lump in his throat. But Master Ambrose was\r\ninexorable: "Yes, of course I would!" he blustered; "I\'d cut the\r\nstrings of every fiddle in Lud. And I will, too, unless you tell us\r\nwhat we want to know. Come, Mother Tibbs, speak out--I\'m a man of my\r\nword."\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him beseechingly, and then a look of innocent cunning\r\ncrept into her candid eyes and she placed a finger on her lips, then\r\nnodded her head several times and said in a mysterious whisper,\r\n"If you\'ll promise not to cut the fiddle strings I\'ll show you the\r\nprettiest sight in the world--the sturdy dead lads in the Fields of\r\nGrammary hoisting their own coffins on their shoulders, and tripping\r\nit over the daisies. Come!" and she darted to the side of the wall,\r\ndrew aside the tapestry and revealed to them another secret door. She\r\npressed some spring, it flew open disclosing another dark tunnel.\r\n\r\n"Follow me, pretty masters," she cried.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to be done," whispered Master Nathaniel, "but to\r\nhumour her. She may have something of real value to show us."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose muttered something about a couple of lunatics and\r\nnot having left his fireside to waste the night in indulging their\r\nfantasies; but all the same he followed Master Nathaniel, and the\r\nsecond secret door shut behind them with a sharp click.\r\n\r\n"Phew!" said Master Nathaniel: "Phew!" puffed Master Ambrose, as they\r\npounded laboriously along the passage behind their light-footed guide.\r\n\r\nThen they began to ascend a flight of stairs, which seemed\r\ninterminable, and finally fell forward with a lurch on to their knees,\r\nand again there was a click of something shutting behind them.\r\n\r\nThey groaned and cursed and rubbed their knees and demanded angrily to\r\nwhat unholy place she had been pleased to lead them.\r\n\r\nBut she clapped her hands gleefully, "Don\'t you know, pretty masters?\r\nWhy, you\'re where the dead cocks roost! You\'ve come back to your own\r\nsnug cottage, Master Josiah Chanticleer. Take your lanthorn and look\r\nround you."\r\n\r\nThis Master Nathaniel proceeded to do, and slowly it dawned on him\r\nwhere they were.\r\n\r\n"By the Golden Apples of the West, Ambrose!" he exclaimed, "if we\'re\r\nnot in my own chapel!"\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, the rays of the lanthorn revealed the shelves lined\r\nwith porphyry coffins, the richly wrought marble ceiling, and the\r\nmosaic floor of the home of the dead Chanticleers.\r\n\r\n"Toasted Cheese!" muttered Master Ambrose in amazement.\r\n\r\n"It must have two doors, though I never knew it," said Master\r\nNathaniel. "A secret door opening on to that hidden flight of steps.\r\nThere are evidently people who know more about my chapel than I do\r\nmyself," and suddenly he remembered how the other day he had found its\r\ndoor ajar.\r\n\r\nMother Tibbs laughed gleefully at their surprise, and then, placing one\r\nfinger on her lips, she beckoned them to follow her; and they tip-toed\r\nafter her out into the moonlit Fields of Grammary, where she signed to\r\nthem to hide themselves from view behind the big trunk of a sycamore.\r\n\r\nThe dew, like lunar daisies, lay thickly on the grassy graves. The\r\nmarble statues of the departed seemed to flicker into smiles under the\r\nrays of the full moon; and, not far from the sycamore, two men were\r\ndigging up a newly-made grave. One of them was a brawny fellow with\r\nthe gold rings in his ears worn by sailors, the other was--Endymion\r\nLeer.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel shot a look of triumph at Master Ambrose, and\r\nwhispered, "A cask of flower-in-amber, Brosie!"\r\n\r\nFor some time the two men dug on in silence, and then they pulled out\r\nthree large coffins and laid them on the grass.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better have a peep, Sebastian," said Endymion Leer, "to see that\r\nthe goods have been delivered all right. We\'re dealing with tricky\r\ncustomers."\r\n\r\nThe young man, addressed as Sebastian, grinned, and taking a clasp\r\nknife from his belt, began to prise open one of the coffins.\r\n\r\nAs he inserted the blade into the lid, our two friends behind the\r\nsycamore could not help shuddering; nor was their horror lessened by\r\nthe demeanor of Mother Tibbs, for she half closed her eyes, and drew\r\nthe air in sharply through her nostrils, as if in expectation of some\r\ndelicious perfume.\r\n\r\nBut when the lid was finally opened and the contents of the coffin\r\nexposed to view, they proved not to be cere cloths and hideousness,\r\nbut--closely packed fairy fruit.\r\n\r\n"Toasted Cheese!" muttered Master Ambrose; "Busty Bridget!" muttered\r\nMaster Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s the goods all right," said Endymion Leer, "and we\'ll take\r\nthe other two on trust. Shut it up again, and help to hoist it on to my\r\nshoulder, and do you follow with the other two--we\'ll take them right\r\naway to the tapestry-room. We\'re having a council there at midnight,\r\nand it\'s getting on for that now."\r\n\r\nChoosing a moment when the backs of the two smugglers were turned,\r\nMother Tibbs darted out from behind the sycamore, and shot back into\r\nthe chapel, evidently afraid of not being found at her post. And she\r\nwas shortly followed by Endymion Leer and his companion.\r\n\r\nAt first, the sensations of Master Nathaniel and Master Ambrose were\r\ntoo complicated to be expressed in words, and they merely stared at\r\neach other, with round eyes. Then a slow smile broke over Master\r\nNathaniel\'s face, "No Moongrass cheese for you this time, Brosie," he\r\nsaid. "Who was right, you or me?"\r\n\r\n"By the Milky Way, it was you, Nat!" cried Master Ambrose, for once, in\r\na voice of real excitement. "The rascal! The unmitigated rogue! So it\'s\r\nhim, is it, we parents have to thank for what has happened! But he\'ll\r\nhang for it, he\'ll hang for it--though we have to change the whole\r\nconstitution of Dorimare! The blackguard!"\r\n\r\n"Into the town probably as a hearse," Master Nathaniel was saying\r\nthoughtfully, "then buried here, then down through my chapel into the\r\nsecret room in the Guildhall, whence, I suppose, they distribute it by\r\ndegrees. It\'s quite clear now how the stuff gets into Lud. All that\r\nremains to clear up is how it gets past our Yeomen on the border ...\r\nbut what\'s taken you, Ambrose?"\r\n\r\nFor Master Ambrose was simply shaking with laughter; and he did not\r\nlaugh easily.\r\n\r\n"Do the dead bleed?" he was repeating between his guffaws; "why, Nat,\r\nit\'s the best joke I\'ve heard these twenty years!"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had sufficiently recovered he told Master Nathaniel about\r\nthe red juice oozing out of the coffin, which he had taken for blood,\r\nand how he had frightened Endymion Leer out of his wits by asking him\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n"When, of course, it was a bogus funeral, and what I had seen was the\r\njuice of that damned fruit!" and again he was seized with paroxysms of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nBut Master Nathaniel merely gave an absent smile; there was something\r\nvaguely reminiscent in that idea of the dead bleeding--something he\r\nhad recently read or heard; but, for the moment, he could not remember\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Master Ambrose had recovered his gravity. "Come,\r\ncome," he cried briskly, "we\'ve not a moment to lose. We must be off at\r\nonce to Mumchance, rouse him and a couple of his men, and be back in a\r\ntwinkling to that tapestry-room, to take them red-handed."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Ambrose! You\'re right!" cried Master Nathaniel. And off\r\nthey went at a sharp jog trot, out at the gate, down the hill, and into\r\nthe sleeping town.\r\n\r\nThey had no difficulty in rousing Mumchance and in firing him with\r\ntheir own enthusiasm. As they told him in a few hurried words what\r\nthey had discovered, his respect for the Senate went up in leaps and\r\nbounds--though he could scarcely credit his ears when he learned of the\r\npart played in the evening\'s transactions by Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\n"To think of that! To think of that!" he kept repeating, "and me who\'s\r\nalways been so friendly with the Doctor, too!"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Endymion Leer had for some months been the\r\nrecipient of Mumchance\'s complaints with regard to the slackness\r\nand inefficiency of the Senate; and, in his turn, had succeeded in\r\ninfecting the good Captain\'s mind with sinister suspicions against\r\nMaster Nathaniel. And there was a twinge of conscience for disloyalty\r\nto his master, the Mayor, behind the respectful heartiness of his tones\r\nas he cried, "Very good, your Worship. It\'s Green and Juniper what are\r\non duty tonight. I\'ll go and fetch them from the guard-room, and we\r\nshould be able to settle the rascals nicely."\r\n\r\nAs the clocks in Lud-in-the-Mist were striking midnight the five of\r\nthem were stepping cautiously along the corridors of the Guildhall.\r\nThey had no difficulty in finding the hollow panel, and having pressed\r\nthe spring, they made their way along the secret passage.\r\n\r\n"Ambrose!" whispered Master Nathaniel flurriedly, "what was it exactly\r\nthat I said that turned out to be the pass-word? What with the\r\nexcitement and all I\'ve clean forgotten it."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose shook his head. "I haven\'t the slightest idea," he\r\nwhispered back. "To tell you the truth, I couldn\'t make out what she\r\nmeant about your having used a pass-word. All I can remember your\r\nsaying was \'Toasted Cheese!\' or \'Busty Bridget!\'--or something equally\r\nelegant."\r\n\r\nNow they had got to the door, locked from the inside as before.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mumchance," said Master Nathaniel, ruefully, "we can\'t\r\nremember the pass-word, and they won\'t open without it."\r\n\r\nMumchance smiled indulgently, "Your Worship need not worry about the\r\npass-word," he said. "I expect we\'ll be able to find another that will\r\ndo as well ... eh, Green and Juniper? But perhaps first--just to be in\r\norder--your Worship would knock and command them to open."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel felt absurdly disappointed. For one thing, it shocked\r\nhis sense of dramatic economy that they should have to resort to\r\nviolence when the same result could have been obtained by a minimum\r\nexpenditure of energy. Besides, he had so looked forward to showing off\r\nhis new little trick!\r\n\r\nSo it was with a rueful sigh that he gave a loud rat-a-tat-tat on the\r\ndoor, calling out, "Open in the name of the Law!"\r\n\r\nThese words, of course, produced no response, and Mumchance, with the\r\nhelp of the other four, proceeded to put into effect his own pass-word,\r\nwhich was to shove with all their might against the door, two of the\r\nhinges of which he had noticed looked rusty.\r\n\r\nIt began to creak, and then to crack, and finally they burst into ...\r\nan empty room. No strange fruit lay heaped on the floor; nothing hung\r\non the walls but a few pieces of faded moth-eaten tapestry. It looked\r\nlike a room that had not been entered for centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen they had recovered from their first surprise, Master Nathaniel\r\ncried fiercely, "They must have got wind that we were after them, and\r\ngiven us the slip, taking their loads of filthy fruits with them,\r\nI\'ll...."\r\n\r\n"There\'s been no fruit here, your Worship," said Mumchance in a voice\r\nthat he was trying hard to keep respectful; "it always leaves stains,\r\nand there ain\'t any stains here."\r\n\r\nAnd he couldn\'t resist adding, with a wink to Juniper and Green, "I\r\ndaresay it\'s your Worship\'s having forgotten the pass-word that\'s done\r\nit!" And Juniper and Green grinned from ear to ear.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was too chagrined to heed this insolence; but Master\r\nAmbrose--ever the champion of dignity in distress--gave Mumchance such\r\na look that he hung his head and humbly hoped that his Worship would\r\nforgive his little joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                      DEAD IN THE EYE OF THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning Master Nathaniel woke late, and got up on\r\nthe wrong side of his bed, which, in view of the humiliation and\r\ndisappointment of the previous night, was, perhaps, pardonable.\r\n\r\nHis temper was not improved by Dame Marigold\'s coming in while he was\r\ndressing to complain of his having smoked green shag elsewhere than in\r\nthe pipe-room: "And you know how it always upsets me, Nat. I\'m feeling\r\nquite squeamish this morning, the whole house reeks of it ... Nat! you\r\nknow you are an old blackguard!" and she dimpled and shook her finger\r\nat him, as an emollient to the slight shrewishness of her tone.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re wrong for once," snapped Master Nathaniel; "I haven\'t\r\nsmoked shag even in the pipe-room for at least a week--so there! Upon\r\nmy word, Marigold, your nose is a nuisance--you should keep it in a\r\nbag, like a horse!"\r\n\r\nBut though Master Nathaniel might be in a bad temper he was far from\r\nbeing daunted by what had happened the night before.\r\n\r\nHe shut himself into the pipe-room and wrote busily for about a quarter\r\nof an hour; then he paced up and down committing what he had written\r\nto memory. Then he set out for the daily meeting of the Senate. And\r\nso absorbed was he with the speech he had been preparing that he was\r\nimpervious, in the Senators\' tiring-room, to the peculiar glances cast\r\nat him by his colleagues.\r\n\r\nOnce the Senators had donned their robes of office and taken their\r\nplaces in the magnificent room reserved for their councils, their\r\nwhole personality was wont suddenly to alter, and they would cease to\r\nbe genial, easy-going merchants who had known each other all their\r\nlives and become grave, formal--even hierophantic, in manner; while\r\nabandoning the careless colloquial diction of every day, they would\r\nadopt the language of their forefathers, forged in more strenuous and\r\npoetic days than the present.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the stern look in Master Nathaniel\'s eye that morning,\r\nwhen he rose to address his colleagues, the stern tone in which he said\r\n"Senators of Dorimare!" might have heralded nothing more serious than a\r\nsuggestion that they should, that year, have geese instead of turkeys\r\nat their public dinner.\r\n\r\nBut his opening words showed that this was to be no usual speech.\r\n\r\n"Senators of Dorimare!" he began, "I am going to ask you this morning\r\nto awake. We have been asleep for many centuries, and the Law has sung\r\nus lullabies. But many of us here have received the accolade of a very\r\nheavy affliction. Has that wakened us? I fear not. The time has come\r\nwhen it behooves us to look facts in the face--even if those facts bear\r\na strange likeness to dreams and fancies.\r\n\r\n"My friends, the ancient foes of our country are abroad. Tradition says\r\nthat the Fairies" (he brought out boldly the horrid word) "fear iron;\r\nand we, the descendants of the merchant-heroes, must still have left in\r\nus some veins of that metal. The time has come to prove it. We stand to\r\nlose everything that makes life pleasant and secure--laughter, sound\r\nsleep, the merriment of fire-sides, the peacefulness of gardens. And if\r\nwe cannot bequeath the certainty of these things to our children, what\r\nwill boot them their inheritance? It is for us, then, as fathers as\r\nwell as citizens, once and for all to uproot this menace, the roots of\r\nwhich are in the past, the branches of which cast their shadow on the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"I and another of your colleagues have discovered at last who it was\r\nthat brought this recent grief and shame upon so many of us. It will\r\nbe hard, I fear, to prove his guilt, for he is subtle, stealthy, and\r\nmocking, and, like his invisible allies, his chief weapon is delusion.\r\nI ask you all, then, to parry that weapon with faith and loyalty,\r\nwhich will make you take the word of old and trusty friends as the\r\nonly touchstone of truth. And, after that--I have sometimes thought\r\nthat less blame attaches to deluding others than to deluding oneself.\r\nAway, then, with flimsy legal fictions! Let us call things by their\r\nnames--not grograine or tuftaffity, but fairy fruit. And if it be\r\nproved that any man has brought such merchandise into Dorimare, let him\r\nhang by his neck till he be dead."\r\n\r\nThen Master Nathaniel sat down.\r\n\r\nBut where was the storm of applause he had expected would greet his\r\nwords? Where were the tears, the eager questions, the tokens of deeply\r\nstirred feelings?\r\n\r\nExcept for Master Ambrose\'s defiant "Bravos!" his speech was received\r\nin profound silence. The faces all round him were grim and frigid,\r\nwith compressed lips and frowning brows--except the portrait of Duke\r\nAubrey--he, as usual, was faintly smiling.\r\n\r\nThen Master Polydore Vigil rose to his feet, and broke the grim silence.\r\n\r\n"Senators of Dorimare!" he began, "the eloquent words we have just\r\nlistened to from his Worship the Mayor can, strangely enough, serve as\r\na prelude--a golden prelude to my poor, leaden words. I, too, came here\r\nthis morning resolved to bring your attention to legal fictions--which,\r\nsometimes, it may be, have their uses. But perhaps before I say my say,\r\nhis Worship will allow the clerk to read us the oldest legal fiction\r\nin our Code. It is to be found in the first volume of the Acts of the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of the Republic, Statute 5, chapter 9."\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore Vigil sat down, and a slow grim smile circulated round\r\nthe hall, and then seemed to vanish and subside in the mocking eyes of\r\nDuke Aubrey\'s portrait.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel exchanged puzzled glances with Master Ambrose; but\r\nthere was nothing for it but to order the clerk to comply with the\r\nwishes of Master Polydore.\r\n\r\nSo, in a small, high, expressionless voice, which might have been the\r\nvoice of the Law herself, the clerk read as follows:\r\n\r\n"Further, we ordain that nothing but death alone shall have power to\r\ndismiss the Mayor of Lud-in-the-Mist and High Seneschal of Dorimare\r\nbefore the five years of his term of office shall fully have expired.\r\nBut, the dead, being dumb, feeble, treacherous and given to vanities,\r\nif any Mayor at a time of menace to the safety of the Dorimarites be\r\nheld by his colleagues to be any of these things, then let him be\r\naccounted dead in the eye of the Law, and let another be elected in his\r\nstead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                            "HO, HO, HOH!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clerk shut the great tome, bowed low, and withdrew to his place;\r\nand an ominous silence reigned in the hall.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel sat watching the scene with an eye so cold and aloof\r\nthat the Eye of the Law itself could surely not have been colder. What\r\npower had delusion or legal fictions against the mysterious impetus\r\npropelling him along the straight white road that led he knew not\r\nwhither?\r\n\r\nBut Master Ambrose sprang up and demanded fiercely that the honourable\r\nSenator would oblige them by an explanation of his offensive\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nNothing loth, Master Polydore again rose to his feet, and, pointing a\r\nmenacing finger at Master Nathaniel, he said: "His worship the Mayor\r\nhas told us of a man stealthy, mocking, and subtle, who has brought\r\nthis recent grief and shame upon us. That man is none other than his\r\nWorship the Mayor himself."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose again sprung to his feet, and began angrily to protest,\r\nbut Master Nathaniel, ex cathedra, sternly ordered him to be silent and\r\nto sit down.\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore continued: "He has been dumb, when it was the time\r\nto speak, feeble, when it was the time to act, treacherous, as the\r\ndesolate homes of his friends can testify, and given to vanities. Aye,\r\ngiven to vanities, for what," and he smiled ironically, "but vanity in\r\na man is too great a love for grograines and tuftaffities and other\r\ncostly silks? Therefore, I move that in the eye of the Law he be\r\naccounted dead."\r\n\r\nA low murmur of approval surged over the hall.\r\n\r\n"Will he deny that he is over fond of silk?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel bowed, in token that he did deny it.\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore asked if he would then be willing to have his house\r\nsearched; again Master Nathaniel bowed.\r\n\r\nThere and then?\r\n\r\nAnd Master Nathaniel bowed again.\r\n\r\nSo the Senate rose and twenty of the Senators, without removing their\r\nrobes, filed out of the Guildhall and marched two and two towards\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s house.\r\n\r\nOn the way who should tag himself on to the procession but Endymion\r\nLeer. At this, Master Ambrose completely lost his temper. He would like\r\nto know why this double-dyed villain, this shameless Son of a Fairy,\r\nwas putting his rancid nose into the private concerns of the Senate!\r\nBut Master Nathaniel cried impatiently, "Oh, let him come, Ambrose, if\r\nhe wants to. The more the merrier!"\r\n\r\nYou can picture the consternation of Dame Marigold when, a few minutes\r\nlater, her brother--with a crowd of Senators pressing up behind\r\nhim--bade her, with a face of grave compassion, to bring him all the\r\nkeys of the house.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to make a thorough search, ransacking every cupboard,\r\nchest and bureau. But nowhere did they find so much as an incriminating\r\npip, so much as a stain of dubious colour.\r\n\r\n"Well," began Master Polydore, in a voice of mingled relief and\r\ndisappointment, "it seems that our search has been a...."\r\n\r\n"Fruitless one, eh?" prompted Endymion Leer, rubbing his hands, and\r\ndarting his bright eyes over the assembled faces. "Well, perhaps it\r\nhas. Perhaps it has."\r\n\r\nThey were standing in the hall, quite close to the grandfather\'s clock,\r\nwhich was ticking away, as innocent and foolish-looking as a newly-born\r\nlamb.\r\n\r\nEndymion Leer walked up to it and gazed at it quizzically, with his\r\nhead on one side. Then he tapped its mahogany case--making Dame\r\nMarigold think of what the guardian at the Guildhall had said of his\r\nlikeness to a woodpecker.\r\n\r\nThen he stood back a few paces and wagged his finger at it in comic\r\nadmonition ("Vulgar buffoon!" said Master Ambrose quite audibly), and\r\nthen the wag turned to Master Polydore and said, "Just before we go, to\r\nmake quite sure, what about having a peep inside this clock?"\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore had secretly sympathised with Master Ambrose\'s\r\nejaculation, and thought that the Doctor, by jesting at such a time,\r\nwas showing a deplorable lack of good breeding.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the Law does not shrink from reducing thoroughness to\r\nabsurdity, so he asked Master Nathaniel if he would kindly produce the\r\nkey of the clock.\r\n\r\nHe did so, and the case was opened; Dame Marigold made a grimace and\r\nheld her pomander to her nose, and to the general amazement that\r\nfoolish, innocent-looking grandfather\'s clock stood revealed as a\r\nveritable cornucopia of exotic, strangely coloured, sinister-looking\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nVine-like tendrils, studded with bright, menacing berries were twined\r\nround the pendulum and the chains of the two leaden weights; and at\r\nthe bottom of the case stood a gourd of an unknown colour, which had\r\nbeen scooped hollow and filled with what looked like crimson grapes,\r\ntawny figs, raspberries of an emerald green, and fruits even stranger\r\nthan these, and of colour and shape not found in any of the species of\r\nDorimare.\r\n\r\nA murmur of horror and surprise arose from the assembled company. And,\r\nwas it from the clock, or down the chimney, or from the ivy peeping in\r\nat the window?--from somewhere quite close came the mocking sound of\r\n"Ho, ho, hoh!"\r\n\r\nOf course, before many hours were over the whole of Lud-in-the-Mist was\r\nlaughing at the anti-climax to the Mayor\'s high-falutin\' speech that\r\nmorning in the Senate. And in the evening he was burned in effigy by\r\nthe mob, and among those who danced round the bon-fire were Bawdy Bess\r\nand Mother Tibbs. Though it was doubtful whether Mother Tibbs really\r\nunderstood what was happening. It was an excuse for dancing, and that\r\nwas enough for her.\r\n\r\nIt was reported, too, that the Yeomanry and their Captain, though not\r\nactually taking part in these demonstrations, stood looking on with\r\nindulgent smiles.\r\n\r\nAmong the respectable tradesmen in the far from unsympathetic crowd\r\nof spectators was Ebeneezor Prim the clockmaker. He had, however, not\r\nallowed his two daughters to be there; and they were sitting dully at\r\nhome, keeping the supper hot for their father and the black-wigged\r\napprentice.\r\n\r\nBut Ebeneezor came back without him, and Rosie and Lettice were too\r\nmuch in awe of their father to ask any questions. The evening dragged\r\nwearily on--Ebeneezor sat reading _The Good Mayor\'s Walk Through\r\nLud-in-the-Mist_ (a didactic and unspeakably dreary poem, dating from\r\nthe early days of the Republic), and from time to time he would glance\r\nseverely over the top of his spectacles at his daughters, who were\r\nwhispering over their tatting, and looking frequently towards the door.\r\n\r\nBut when they finally went upstairs to bed the apprentice had not yet\r\ncome in, and in the privacy of their bedroom the girls admitted to each\r\nother that it was the dullest evening they had spent since his arrival,\r\nearly in spring. For it was wonderful what high spirits were concealed\r\nbehind that young man\'s prim exterior.\r\n\r\nWhy, it was sufficient to enliven even an evening spent in the society\r\nof papa to watch the comical grimaces he pulled behind that gentleman\'s\r\nrespectable back! And it was delicious when the shrill "Ho, ho, hoh!"\r\nwould suddenly escape him, and he would instantly snap down on the top\r\nof it his most sanctimonious expression. And then, he seemed to possess\r\nan inexhaustible store of riddles and funny songs, and there was really\r\nno end to the invention and variety of his practical jokes.\r\n\r\nThe Misses Prim, since their earliest childhood, had craved for a\r\nmonkey or a cockatoo, such as sailor brothers or cousins brought to\r\ntheir friends; their father, however, had always sternly refused to\r\nhave any such creature in his house. But the new apprentice had been\r\nten times more amusing than any monkey or cockatoo that had ever come\r\nfrom the Cinnamon Isles.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as he did not come for his usual early roll and glass\r\nof home-made cordial, the two girls peeped into his room, and found\r\nthat his bed had not been slept in; and lying neglected on the floor\r\nwas the neat black wig. Nor did he ever come back to claim it. And when\r\nthey timidly asked their father what had happened to him, he sternly\r\nforbade them ever again to mention his name, adding, with a mysterious\r\nshake of the head, "For some time I have had my suspicions that he was\r\nnot what he appeared."\r\n\r\nAnd then he sighed regretfully, and murmured, "But never before have I\r\nhad an apprentice with such wonderfully skillful fingers."\r\n\r\nAs for Master Nathaniel--while he was being burned in effigy in the\r\nmarket-place, he was sitting comfortably in his pipe-room, deep in an\r\nin-folio.\r\n\r\nHe had suddenly remembered that it was something in the widow\r\nGibberty\'s trial that was connected in his mind with Master Ambrose\'s\r\njoke about the dead bleeding. And he was re-reading that trial--this\r\ntime with absorption.\r\n\r\nAs he read, the colours of his mental landscape were gradually\r\nmodified, as the colours of a real landscape are modified according to\r\nthe position of the sun. But if a white road cuts through the landscape\r\nit still gleams white--even when the moon has taken the place of the\r\nsun. And a straight road still gleamed white across the landscape of\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                      THE WIDOW GIBBERTY\'S TRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day, with all the masquerading that the Law delights in,\r\nMaster Nathaniel was pronounced in the Senate to be dead. His robes\r\nof office were taken off him, and they were donned by Master Polydore\r\nVigil, the new Mayor. As for Master Nathaniel--was wrapped in a shroud,\r\nlaid on a bier and carried to his home by four of the Senators, the\r\npopulace lining the streets and greeting the mock obsequies with\r\ncatcalls and shouts of triumph.\r\n\r\nBut the ceremony over, when Master Ambrose, boiling with indignation at\r\nthe outrage, came to visit his friend, he found a very cheerful corpse\r\nwho greeted him with a smack on the back and a cry of "Never say die,\r\nBrosie! I\'ve something here that should interest you," and he thrust\r\ninto his hand an open in-folio.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" asked the bewildered Master Ambrose.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain solemnity in Master Nathaniel\'s voice as he\r\nreplied, "It\'s the Law, Ambrose--the homoeopathic antidote that our\r\nforefathers discovered to delusion. Sit down this very minute and read\r\nthat trial through."\r\n\r\nAs Master Ambrose knew well, it was useless trying to talk to Nat about\r\none thing when his mind was filled with another. Besides, his curiosity\r\nwas aroused, for he had come to realize that Nat\'s butterfly whims were\r\nsometimes the disguise of shrewd and useful intuitions. So, through\r\nforce of long habit, growling out a protest about this being no time\r\nfor tomfoolery and rubbish, he settled down to read the volume at the\r\nplace where Master Nathaniel had opened it, namely, at the account of\r\nthe trial of the widow Gibberty for the murder of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff, as we have seen, was a labourer, Diggory Carp by name,\r\nwho had been in the employ of the late farmer. He said he had been\r\nsuddenly dismissed by the defendant just after harvest, when it was not\r\neasy to find another job.\r\n\r\nNo reason was given for his dismissal, so Diggory went to the farmer\r\nhimself, who, he said, had always been a kind and just master, to beg\r\nthat he might be kept on. The farmer practically admitted that there\r\nwas no reason for his dismissal except that the mistress had taken a\r\ndislike to him. "Women are kittle cattle, Diggory," he had said, with\r\nan apologetic laugh, "and it\'s best humouring them. Though it\'s hard\r\non the folks they get their knife into. So I fear it will be best for\r\nevery one concerned that you should leave my service, Diggory."\r\n\r\nBut he gave him a handful of florins over and above his wages, and\r\ntold him he might take a sack of lentils from the granary--if he were\r\ncareful that the mistress did not get wind of it.\r\n\r\nNow, Diggory had a shrewd suspicion as to why the defendant wanted to\r\nget rid of him. Though she was little more than a girl--she was the\r\nfarmer\'s second wife and more like his daughter\'s elder sister than her\r\nstepdame--she had the reputation of being as staid and sensible as a\r\nwoman of forty. But Diggory knew better. He had discovered that she had\r\na lover. One evening he had come on her in the orchard, lying in the\r\narms of a young foreigner, called Christopher Pugwalker, a herbalist,\r\nwho had first appeared in the neighbourhood just before the great\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\n"And from that time on," said Diggory, "she had got her knife into me,\r\nand everything I did was wrong. And I believe she hadn\'t a moment\'s\r\npeace till she\'d got rid of me. Though, if she\'d only known, I was no\r\nblab, and not one for blaming young blood and a wife half the age of\r\nher husband."\r\n\r\nSo he and his wife and his children were turned out on the world.\r\n\r\nThe first night they camped out in a field, and when they had lighted\r\na fire Diggory opened the sack that, with the farmer\'s permission, he\r\nhad taken from the granary, in order that his wife might make them some\r\nlentil soup for supper. But lo and behold! instead of lentils the sack\r\ncontained fruit--fruit that Diggory Carp, as a west countryman, born\r\nand bred near the Elfin Marches, recognised at the first glance to be\r\nof a kind that he would not dream of touching himself or of allowing\r\nhis wife and children to touch ... the sack, in fact, contained fairy\r\nfruit. So they buried it in the field, for, as Diggory said, "Though\r\nthe stuff be poison for men, they do say as how it\'s a mighty fine\r\nmanure for the crops."\r\n\r\nFor a week or so they tramped the country, living from hand to mouth.\r\nSometimes Diggory would earn a little by doing odd jobs for the\r\nfarmers, or by playing the fiddle at village weddings, for Diggory, it\r\nwould seem, was a noted fiddler.\r\n\r\nBut with the coming of winter they began to feel the pinch of poverty,\r\nand his wife bethought her of the trade of basket-making she had\r\nlearned in her youth; and, as they were camping at the time at the\r\nplace where grew the best osiers for the purpose, she determined to\r\nsee if her fingers had retained their old cunning. As the sap of these\r\nparticular osiers was a deadly poison, she would not allow the children\r\nto help her to gather them.\r\n\r\nSo she set to and make wicker urns in which the farmers\' wives could\r\nkeep their grain in winter, and baskets of fancy shapes for lads to\r\ngive to their sweethearts to hold their ribbands and fal-lals. The\r\nchildren peddled them about the countryside, and thus they managed to\r\nkeep the pot boiling.\r\n\r\nThe following summer, shortly before harvest, Diggory\'s eldest girl\r\nwent to try and sell some baskets in the village of Swan. There she\r\nmet the defendant, whom she asked to look at her wares, relying on not\r\nbeing recognised as a daughter of Diggory\'s, through having been in\r\nservice at another farm when her father was working at the Gibbertys\'.\r\n\r\nThe defendant seemed pleased with the baskets, bought two or three, and\r\ngot into talk with the girl about the basket-making industry, in the\r\ncourse of which she learned that the best osiers for the purpose were\r\nvery poisonous. Finally she asked the girl to bring her a bundle of the\r\nosiers in question, as making baskets, she said, would make a pleasant\r\nvariety, of an evening, from the eternal spinning; and in the course of\r\na few days the girl brought her, as requested, a bundle of the osiers,\r\nand was well paid for them.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards came the news that the farmer Gibberty had died\r\nsuddenly in the night, and with it was wafted the rumour of foul play.\r\nThere was an old custom in that part of the country that whenever there\r\nwas a death in the house all the inmates should march in procession\r\npast the corpse. It was really a sort of primitive inquest, for it\r\nwas believed that in the case of foul play the corpse would bleed at\r\nthe nose as the murderer passed it. This custom, said Diggory, was\r\nuniversally observed in that part of the country, even in cases as free\r\nfrom all suspicion as those of women dying in child-bed. And in all the\r\ntaverns and farm-houses of the neighbourhood it was being whispered\r\nthat the corpse of the farmer Gibberty, on the defendant\'s walking past\r\nit, had bled copiously, and when Christopher Pugwalker\'s turn had come\r\nto pass it, it had bled a second time.\r\n\r\nAnd knowing what he did, Diggory Carp came to feel that it was his duty\r\nto lodge an accusation against the widow.\r\n\r\nHis two reasons, then, for thinking her guilty were that the corpse\r\nhad bled when she passed it, and that she had bought from his daughter\r\nosiers the sap of which was poisonous. The motive for the crime he\r\nfound in her having a young lover, whom she wished should stand in her\r\ndead husband\'s shoes. It was useless for the defendant to deny that\r\nPugwalker was her lover--the fact had for months been the scandal of\r\nthe neighbourhood, and she had finally lost all sense of shame and had\r\nactually had him to lodge in the farm for several months before her\r\nhusband\'s death. This was proved beyond a shadow of a doubt by the\r\nwitnesses summoned by Diggory.\r\n\r\nAs for the bleeding of the corpse: vulgar superstitions did not fall\r\nwithin the cognizance of the Law, and the widow ignored it in her\r\ndefence. However, with regard to that other vulgar superstition to\r\nwhich the plaintiff had alluded, fairy fruit, she admitted, in passing,\r\nthat very much against her wishes her late husband had sometimes used\r\nit as manure--though she had never discovered how he procured it.\r\n\r\nAs to the osiers--she allowed that she had bought a bundle from the\r\nplaintiff\'s daughter; but that it was for no sinister purpose she was\r\nable conclusively to prove. For she summoned various witnesses--among\r\nothers the midwife from the village, who was always called in in cases\r\nof sickness--who had been present during the last hours of the farmer,\r\nand who had been present during the last hours of the farmer, and who\r\nall of them swore that his death had been a painless one. And various\r\nphysicians, who were summoned as expert witnesses, all maintained that\r\nthe victim of the poisonous sap of osiers always died in agony.\r\n\r\nThen she turned the tables on the plaintiff. She proved that Diggory\'s\r\ndismissal had been neither sudden nor unjust; for, owing to his\r\nthieving propensities, he had often been threatened with it by her late\r\nhusband, and several of the farm-servants testified to the truth of her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAs to the handful of florins and the sack of lentils, all she could say\r\nwas that it was not like the farmer to load a dishonest servant with\r\npresents. But nothing had been said about two sacks of corn, a pig,\r\nand a valuable hen and her brood, which had disappeared simultaneously\r\nwith the departure of the plaintiff. Her husband, she said, had been\r\nvery angry about it, and had wanted to have Diggory pursued and clapped\r\ninto gaol; but she had persuaded him to be merciful. The long and the\r\nshort of it was that the widow left the court without a stain on her\r\ncharacter, and that a ten years\' sentence for theft was passed on\r\nDiggory.\r\n\r\nAs for Christopher Pugwalker, he had disappeared shortly before the\r\ntrial, and the widow denied all knowledge of his whereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                           THE WORLD-IN-LAW\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well," said Master Ambrose, as he laid down the volume, "the woman was\r\nclearly as innocent as you are. And I should very much like to know\r\nwhat bearing the case has upon the present crisis."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel drew up his chair close to his friend\'s and said in\r\na low voice, as if he feared an invisible listener, "Ambrose, do you\r\nremember how you startled Leer with your question as to whether the\r\ndead could bleed?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not likely to forget it," said Master Ambrose, with an angry\r\nlaugh. "That was all explained the night before last in the Fields of\r\nGrammary."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but supposing he had been thinking of something else--not of\r\nfairy fruit. What if Endymion Leer and Christopher Pugwalker were one\r\nand the same?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t see the slightest reason for thinking so. But even if\r\nthey were--what good would it do us?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have an instinct that hidden in that old case is a good\r\nhonest hempen rope, too strong for all the gossamer threads of Fairie."\r\n\r\n"You mean that we can get the rascal hanged? By the Harvest of Souls,\r\nyou\'re an optimist, Nat. If ever a fellow died quietly in his bed\r\nfrom natural causes, it was that fellow Gibberty. But, for all that,\r\nthere\'s no reason to lie down under the outrageous practical joke that\r\nwas played off on you yesterday. By my Great-aunt\'s Rump, I thought\r\nPolydore and the rest of them had more sense than to be taken in by\r\nsuch tomfoolery. But the truth of it is that that villain Leer can make\r\nthem believe what he chooses."\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" cried Master Nathaniel eagerly. "The original meaning of\r\nFairie is supposed to be delusion. They can juggle with appearances--we\r\nhave seen them at it in that tapestry-room. How are we to make any\r\nstand against an enemy with such powers behind him?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that you are going to lie down under it, Nat?" cried\r\nMaster Ambrose indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Not ultimately--but for a time I must be like the mole and work in\r\nsecret. And now I want you to listen to me, Ambrose, and not scold me\r\nfor what you call wandering from the point and being prosy. Will you\r\nlisten to me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, if you\'ve got anything sensible to say," said Master\r\nAmbrose grudgingly.\r\n\r\n"Here goes, then! What do you suppose the Law was invented for,\r\nAmbrose?"\r\n\r\n"What was the Law invented for? What are you driving at, Nat? I suppose\r\nit was invented to prevent rapine, and robbery, and murder, and all\r\nthat sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"But you remember what my father said about the Law being man\'s\r\nsubstitute for fairy fruit? Fairy things are all of them supposed to be\r\nshadowy cheats--delusion. But man can\'t live without delusion, so he\r\ncreates for himself another form of delusion--the world-in-law, subject\r\nto no other law but the will of man, where man juggles with facts to\r\nhis heart\'s content, and says, \'If I choose I shall make a man old\r\nenough to be my father my son, and if I choose I shall turn fruit into\r\nsilk and black into white, for this is the world I have made myself,\r\nand here I am master.\' And he creates a monster to inhabit it--the\r\nman-in-law, who is like a mechanical toy and always behaves exactly as\r\nhe is expected to behave, and is no more like you and me than are the\r\nfairies."\r\n\r\nFor the life of him, Master Ambrose could not suppress a grunt of\r\nimpatience. But he was a man of his word, so he refrained from further\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n"Beyond the borders of the world-in-law," continued Master Nathaniel,\r\n"that is to say, the world as we choose for our convenience that it\r\nshould appear, there is delusion--or reality. And the people who live\r\nthere are as safe from our clutches as if they lived on another planet.\r\nNo, Ambrose, you needn\'t purse up your lips like that ... everything\r\nI\'ve been saying is to be found more or less in my father\'s writings,\r\nand nobody ever thought him fantastic--probably because they never took\r\nthe trouble to read his books. I must confess I never did myself till\r\njust the other day."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he glanced up at the portrait of the late Master Josiah,\r\ntaken in the very arm-chair he, Nathaniel, was at that very moment\r\nsitting in, and following his son\'s every movement with a sly, legal\r\nsmile. No, there had certainly been nothing fantastic about Master\r\nJosiah.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... there was something not altogether human about these bright\r\nbird-like eyes and that very pointed chin. Had Master Josiah also heard\r\nthe Note ... and fled from it to the world-in-law?\r\n\r\nThen he went on: "But what I\'m going to say now is my own idea.\r\nSupposing that everything that happens on the one planet, the planet\r\nthat we call Delusion, reacts on the other planet; that is to say, the\r\nworld as we choose to see it, the world-in-law? No, no, Ambrose! You\r\npromised to hear me out!" (For it was clear that Master Ambrose was\r\ngetting restive.) "Supposing then, that one planet reacts on the other,\r\nbut that these reactions are translated, as it were, into the terms of\r\nthe other? To take an example, supposing that what on one planet is a\r\nspiritual sin should turn on the other into a felony? That what in the\r\nworld of delusion are hands stained with fairy fruit should, in the\r\nworld-in-law, turn into hands stained with human blood? In short, that\r\nEndymion Leer should turn into Christopher Pugwalker?"\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose\'s impatience had changed to real alarm. He greatly\r\nfeared that Nathaniel\'s brain had been unhinged by his recent\r\nmisfortunes. Master Nathaniel burst out laughing: "I believe you think\r\nI\'ve gone off my head, Brosie--but I\'ve not, I promise you. In plain\r\nlanguage, unless we can find that this fellow Leer has been guilty of\r\nsomething in the eye of the Law he\'ll go on triumphing over us and\r\nlaughing at us in his sleeve and ruining our country for our children\r\ntill, finally, all the Senate, except you and me, follows his funeral\r\nprocession, with weeping and wailing, to the Fields of Grammary. It\'s\r\nour one hope of getting even with him, Brosie. Otherwise, we might as\r\nsoon hope to catch a dream and put it in a cage."\r\n\r\n"Well, according to your ideas of the Law, Nat, it shouldn\'t be too\r\ndifficult," said Master Ambrose drily. "You seem to consider that in\r\nwhat you call the world-in-law one does as one likes with facts--launch\r\na new legal fiction, then, according to which, for your own particular\r\nconvenience, Endymion Leer is for the future Christopher Pugwalker."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel laughed: "I\'m in hopes we can prove it without legal\r\nfiction," he said. "The widow Gibberty\'s trial took place thirty-six\r\nyears ago, four years after the great drought, when, as Marigold has\r\ndiscovered, Leer was in Dorimare, though he has always given us to\r\nunderstand that he did not arrive till considerably later ... and the\r\nreason would be obvious if he left as Pugwalker, and returned as Leer.\r\nAlso, we know that he is intimate with the widow Gibberty. Pugwalker\r\nwas a herbalist; so is Leer. And then there is the fright you gave him\r\nwith your question, \'Do the dead bleed?\' Nothing will make me believe\r\nthat that question immediately suggested to him the mock funeral and\r\nthe coffin with fairy fruit ... he might think of that on second\r\nthoughts, not right away. No, no, I hope to be able to convince you,\r\nand before very long, that I am right in this matter, as I was in the\r\nother--it\'s our one hope, Ambrose."\r\n\r\n"Well, Nat," said Master Ambrose, "though you talk more nonsense in\r\nhalf an hour than most people do in a lifetime, I\'ve been coming to the\r\nconclusion that you\'re not such a fool as you look--and, after all,\r\nin Hempie\'s old story it was the village idiot who put salt on the\r\ndragon\'s tail."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel laughed, quite pleased by this equivocal\r\ncompliment--it was so rarely that Ambrose paid one a compliment at all.\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Master Ambrose, "and how are you going to set about\r\nlaunching your legal fiction, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll try and get in touch with some of the witnesses in the\r\ntrial--Diggory Carp himself may turn out to be still alive. At any\r\nrate, it will give me something to do, and Lud\'s no place for me just\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose groaned: "Has it really come to this, Nat, that you have\r\nto leave Lud, and that we can do nothing against this ... this ... this\r\ncobweb of lies and buffoonery and ... well, delusion, if you like? I\r\ncan tell you, I haven\'t spared Polydore and the rest of them the rough\r\nside of my tongue--but it\'s as if that fellow Leer had cast a spell on\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"But we\'ll break the spell, by the Golden Apples of the West, we\'ll\r\nbreak it, Ambrose!" cried Master Nathaniel buoyantly; "we\'ll dredge the\r\nshadows with the net of the Law, and Leer shall end on the gallows, or\r\nmy name\'s not Chanticleer!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Master Ambrose, "seeing you\'ve got this bee in your\r\nbonnet about Leer you might like a little souvenir of him; it\'s the\r\nembroidered slipper I took from that gibbering criminal old woman\'s\r\nparlour, and now that her affair is settled there\'s no more use for\r\nit." (The variety of "silk" found in the Academy had finally been\r\ndecided to be part "barratine tuftaffity" and part "figured mohair,"\r\nand Miss Primrose had been heavily fined and set at liberty.) "I told\r\nyou how the sight of it made him jump, and though the reason is obvious\r\nenough--he thought it was fairy fruit--it seems to take so little to\r\nset your brain romancing there\'s no telling what you mayn\'t discover\r\nfrom it! I\'ll have it sent over to you tonight."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind, Ambrose. I\'m sure it will be most valuable," said\r\nMaster Nathaniel ironically.\r\n\r\nDuring Miss Primrose\'s trial the slipper had from time to time been\r\nhanded round among the judges, without its helping them in the\r\nslightest in the delicate distinctions they were drawing between\r\ntuftaffity and mohair. In Master Nathaniel it had aroused a vague\r\nsense of boredom and embarrassment, for it suggested a long series of\r\nbirthday presents from Prunella that had put him to the inconvenience\r\nof pumping up adequate expressions of gratitude and admiration. He had\r\nlittle hope of being able to extricate any useful information from that\r\nslipper--still, Ambrose must have his joke.\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes, and then Master Nathaniel rose\r\nto his feet and said, "This may be a long business, Ambrose, and we may\r\nnot have an opportunity for another talk. Shall we pledge each other in\r\nwild thyme gin?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not the man to refuse your wild-thyme gin, Nat. And you don\'t\r\noften give one a chance of tasting it, you old miser," said Master\r\nAmbrose, trying to mask his emotion with facetiousness. When he had\r\nbeen given a glass filled with the perfumed grass-green syrup, he\r\nraised it, and smiling at Master Nathaniel, began, "Well, Nat...."\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute, Ambrose!" interrupted Master Nathaniel. "I\'ve got a\r\nsudden silly whim that we must should take an oath I must have read\r\nwhen I was a youngster in some old book ... the words have suddenly\r\ncome back to me. They go like this: \'We\' (and then we say our own\r\nnames), \'Nathaniel Chanticleer and Ambrose Honeysuckle, swear by the\r\nLiving and the Dead, by the Past and the Future, by Memories and Hopes,\r\nthat if a Vision comes begging at our door we will take it in and warm\r\nit at our hearth, and that we will not be wiser than the foolish nor\r\nmore cunning than the simple, and that we will remember that he who\r\nrides the Wind needs must go where his Steed carries him.\' Say it after\r\nme, Ambrose."\r\n\r\n"By the White Ladies of the Fields, never in my life have I heard such\r\nfustian!" grumbled Master Ambrose.\r\n\r\nBut Nat seemed to have set his heart on this absurd ceremony, and\r\nMaster Ambrose felt that the least he could do was to humour him, for\r\nwho could say what the future held in store and when they might meet\r\nagain. So, in a protesting and excessively matter-of-fact voice, he\r\nrepeated after him the words of the oath.\r\n\r\nWhen, and in what book had Master Nathaniel found it? For it was the\r\nvow taken by the candidates for initiation into the first degree of the\r\nancient Mysteries of Dorimare.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that, in the eye of the Law, Master Nathaniel was a dead\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                        MISTRESS IVY PEPPERCORN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tasks assigned to the clerks in Master Nathaniel\'s counting-house\r\ndid not always concern cargoes and tonnage. For instance, once for\r\ntwo whole days they had not opened a ledger, but had been kept busy,\r\nunder their employer\'s supervision, in cutting out and pinning together\r\nfantastic paper costumes to be worn at Ranulph\'s birthday party. And\r\nthey were quite accustomed to his shutting himself into his private\r\noffice, with strict injunctions that he was not to be disturbed, while\r\nhe wrote, say, a comic valentine to old Dame Polly Pyepowders, popping\r\nhis head frequently round the door to demand their help in finding a\r\nrhyme. So they were not surprised that morning when told to close their\r\nbooks and to devote their talents to discovering, by whatever means\r\nthey chose, whether there were any relations living in Lud of a west\r\ncountry farmer called Gibberty who had died nearly forty years ago.\r\n\r\nGreat was Master Nathaniel\'s satisfaction when one of them returned\r\nfrom his quest with the information that the late farmer\'s widowed\r\ndaughter, Mistress Ivy Peppercorn, had recently bought a small grocer\'s\r\nshop in Mothgreen, a village that lay a couple of miles beyond the\r\nnorth gate.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost, so Master Nathaniel ordered his horse,\r\nput on the suit of fustian he wore for fishing, pulled his hat well\r\ndown over his eyes, and set off for Mothgreen.\r\n\r\nOnce there, he had no difficulty in finding Mistress Ivy\'s little shop,\r\nand she herself was sitting behind the counter.\r\n\r\nShe was a comely, apple-cheeked woman of middle age, who looked as\r\nif she would be more in her element among cows and meadows than in a\r\nstuffy little shop, redolent of the various necessities and luxuries of\r\na village community.\r\n\r\nShe seemed of a cheerful, chatty disposition, and Master Nathaniel\r\npunctuated his various purchases with quips and cranks and friendly\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nBy the time she had weighed him out two ounces of snuff and done them\r\nup in a neat little paper poke she had told him that her maiden name\r\nhad been Gibberty, and that her late husband had been a ship\'s captain,\r\nand she had lived till his death in the seaport town. By the time she\r\nhad provided him with a quarter of lollipops, he knew that she much\r\npreferred a country life to trade. And by the time a woolen muffler had\r\nbeen admired, purchased and done up in a parcel, she had informed him\r\nthat she would have liked to have settled in the neighbourhood of her\r\nold home, but--there were reasons.\r\n\r\nWhat these reasons were took time, tact and patience to discover. But\r\nnever had Master Nathaniel\'s wistful inquisitiveness, masquerading\r\nas warm-hearted sympathy, stood him in better stead. And she finally\r\nadmitted that she had a stepmother whom she detested, and whom,\r\nmoreover, she had good reason to distrust.\r\n\r\nAt this point Master Nathaniel considered he might begin to show his\r\nhand. He gave her a meaning glance; and asked her if she would like to\r\nsee justice done and rascals getting their deserts, adding, "There\'s\r\nno more foolish proverb than the one which says that dead men tell no\r\ntales. To help dead men to find their tongues is one of the chief uses\r\nof the Law."\r\n\r\nMistress Ivy looked a little scared. "Who may you be, sir, please?" she\r\nasked timidly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the nephew of a farmer who once employed a labourer called Diggory\r\nCarp," he answered promptly.\r\n\r\nA smile of enlightenment broke over her face.\r\n\r\n"Well, who would have thought it!" she murmured. "And what may your\r\nuncle\'s name have been? I used to know all the farmers and their\r\nfamilies round our part."\r\n\r\nThere was a twinkle in Master Nathaniel\'s candid hazel eyes: "I doubt\r\nI\'ve been too sharp and cut myself!" he laughed. "You see, I\'ve worked\r\nfor the magistrates, and that gets one into the habit of setting traps\r\nfor folk ... the Law\'s a wily lady. I\'ve no uncle in the West, and I\r\nnever knew Diggory Carp. But I\'ve always taken an interest in crime and\r\nenjoyed reading the old trials. So when you said your name had been\r\nGibberty my mind at once flew back to a certain trial that had always\r\npuzzled me, and I thought perhaps, the name Diggory Carp might unlock\r\nyour tongue. I\'ve always felt there was more behind that trial than met\r\nthe eye."\r\n\r\n"Did you indeed?" said Mistress Ivy evasively. "You seem mighty\r\ninterested in other folks\' affairs," and she looked at him rather\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\nThis put Master Nathaniel on his mettle. "Now, hark\'ee, Mistress Ivy,\r\nI\'m sure your father took a pleasure in looking at a fine crop, even\r\nif it was in another man\'s field, and that your husband liked good\r\nseamanship...."\r\n\r\nAnd here he had to break off his dissertation and listen, which he\r\ndid very patiently, to a series of reminiscences about the tastes and\r\nhabits of her late husband.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying," he went on, when she paused for a moment to\r\nsigh, and smile and wipe her eyes with the corner of her apron, "what\r\nthe sight of a field filled to the brim with golden wheat was to your\r\nfather, and that of a ship skilfully piloted into harbour was to your\r\nhusband, the sight of Justice crouching and springing on her prey is\r\nto me. I\'m a bachelor, and I\'ve managed to put by a comfortable little\r\nnest-egg, and there\'s nothing I\'d like to spend it on better than in\r\npreventing Justice being balked of her lawful prey, not to mention\r\nhelping to avenge a fine fellow like your father. We old bachelors, you\r\nknow, have our hobbies ... they\'re quieter about the house than a crowd\r\nof brats, but they\'re sometimes quite as expensive," and he chuckled\r\nand rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\nHe was thoroughly enjoying himself, and seemed actually to have become\r\nthe shrewd, honest, and somewhat bloodthirsty old fellow he had\r\ncreated. His eyes shone with the light of fanaticism when he spoke\r\nof Justice, the tiger; and he could picture the snug little house he\r\nlived in in Lud--it had a little garden gay with flowers, and a tiny\r\nlawn, and espalier fruit trees, to the care of which he dedicated his\r\nleisure hours. And he had a dog, and a canary, and an old housekeeper.\r\nProbably, when he got home tonight, he would sit down to a supper of\r\nsausages and mashed, followed by a toasted cheese. And then, when he\r\nhad finished his supper, he would get out his collection of patibulary\r\ntreasures, and over a bowl of negus finger lovingly the various bits\r\nof gallows rope, the blood-stained glove of a murdered strumpet, the\r\npiece of amber worn as a charm by a notorious brigand chief, and gloat\r\nover the stealthy steps of his pet tiger, the Law. Yes, his obscure\r\nlittle life was as gay with hobbies as his garden was with flowers. How\r\ncomfortable were other men\'s shoes!\r\n\r\n"Well, if what you mean," said Mistress Ivy, "is that you\'d like to\r\nhelp punish wicked people, why, I wouldn\'t mind lending a hand myself.\r\nAll the same," and again she looked at him suspiciously, "what makes\r\nyou think my father didn\'t come by a natural death?"\r\n\r\n"My nose, good lady, my nose!" and, as he spoke, he laid a knowing\r\nfinger alongside the said organ. "I smelt blood. Didn\'t it say in the\r\ntrial that the corpse bled?"\r\n\r\nShe bridled, and cried scornfully, "And you, to be town-bred, too, and\r\nan educated man from the look of you, to go believing that vulgar talk!\r\nYou know what country people are, setting everything that happens to\r\nthe tunes of old songs. It was two drops of blood when the story was\r\ntold in the tavern at Swan, and by the time it had reached Moongrass it\r\nwas a gallon. I walked past the corpse with the others, and I can\'t say\r\nI noticed any blood--but, then, my eyes were all swelled with crying.\r\nAll the same, it\'s what made Pugwalker leave the country."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" cried Master Nathaniel, and his voice was very eager.\r\n\r\n"Yes. My stepmother was never the kind to be saucy with--though I had\r\nno cause to love her, I must say she looked like a queen, but he was a\r\nforeigner and a little bit of a chap, and the boys in the village and\r\nall round gave him no peace, jumping out at him from behind hedges and\r\nchasing him down the street, shouting, \'Who made the corpse of Farmer\r\nGibberty bleed?\' and such like. And he just couldn\'t stand it, and\r\nslipped off one night, and I never thought to see him again. But I\'ve\r\nseen him in the streets of Lud, and not long ago too--though he didn\'t\r\nsee me."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s heart was thumping with excitement. "What is he\r\nlike?" he asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! very like what he was as a young man. They say there\'s nothing\r\nkeeps you young like a good conscience!" and she laughed drily. "Not\r\nthat he was ever much to look at--squat and tubby and freckled, and\r\nsuch saucy prying eyes!"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel could contain himself no longer, and in a voice hoarse\r\nwith excitement he cried, "Was it ... do you mean the Lud doctor,\r\nEndymion Leer?"\r\n\r\nMistress Ivy pursed up her mouth and nodded meaningfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what he calls himself now ... and many folks set such\r\nstore by him as a doctor, that, to hear them talk, one would think a\r\nbaby wasn\'t properly born unless he\'d brought it into the world, nor a\r\nman properly dead unless he\'d closed his eyes."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. But are you sure he is the same as Christopher Pugwalker?\r\nCould you swear to him in court?" cried Master Nathaniel eagerly.\r\n\r\nMistress Ivy looked puzzled. "What good would it do to swear at him?"\r\nshe asked doubtfully. "I must say I never held with foul language in\r\na woman\'s mouth, nor did my poor Peppercorn--for all that he was a\r\nsailor."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Master Nathaniel impatiently, and proceeded to explain\r\nto her the meaning of the expression. She dimpled a little at her own\r\nblunder, and then said guardedly, "And what would bring me into the law\r\ncourts, I should like to know? The past is over and done with, and what\r\nis done can\'t be undone."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel fixed her with a searching gaze, and, forgetting his\r\nassumed character, spoke as himself.\r\n\r\n"Mistress Peppercorn," he said solemnly, "have you no pity for the\r\ndead, the dumb, helpless dead? You loved your father, I am sure. When\r\na word from you might help to avenge him, are you going to leave that\r\nword unsaid? Who can say that the dead are not grateful for the loving\r\nthoughts of the living, and that they do not rest more quietly in\r\ntheir graves when they have been avenged? Have you no time or pity\r\nleft for your dead father?"\r\n\r\nDuring this speech Mistress Ivy\'s face had begun working, and at the\r\nlast words she burst into sobs. "Don\'t think that, sir," she gasped;\r\n"don\'t think that! I remember well how my poor father used to sit\r\nlooking at her of an evening, not a word passing his lips, but his eyes\r\nsaying as clearly as if it had been his tongue, \'No, Clem,\' (for my\r\nstepmother\'s name was Clementine), \'I don\'t trust you no further than I\r\nsee you, but, for all that, you can turn me round your little finger,\r\nbecause I\'m a silly, besotted old fool, and we both know it.\' Oh! I\'ve\r\nalways said that my poor father had both his eyes wide open, in spite\r\nof him being the slave of her pretty face. It was not that he didn\'t\r\nsee, or couldn\'t see--what he lacked was the heart to speak out."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow! And now, Mistress Ivy, I think you should tell me all you\r\nknow and what it is that makes you think that, in spite of the medical\r\nevidence to the contrary, your father was murdered," and he planted his\r\nelbows on the counter and looked at her squarely in the face.\r\n\r\nBut Mistress Ivy trimmed. "I didn\'t say that poor father was poisoned\r\nwith osiers. He died quiet and peaceful, father did."\r\n\r\n"All the same, you think there was foul play. I am not entirely\r\ndisinterested in this matter, now that I know Dr. Leer is connected\r\nwith it. I happen to bear him a grudge."\r\n\r\nFirst Mistress Ivy shut the door on to the street, and then leant over\r\nthe counter, so that her face was close to his, and said in a low\r\nvoice: "Why, yes, I always did think there had been foul play, and I\'ll\r\ntell you why. Just before my father died we\'d been making jam. And\r\none of poor father\'s funny little ways was to like the scum of jam or\r\njelly, and we used to keep some of every boiling in a saucer for him.\r\nWell, my own little brother Robin, and her little girl--a little tot\r\nof three--were buzzing round the fruit and sugar like a pair of little\r\nwasps, whining for this, sticking their fingers into that, and thinking\r\nthey were helping with the jam-making. And suddenly my stepmother\r\nturned round and caught little Polly with her mouth all black with\r\nmulberry juice. And oh, the taking she was in! She caught her and shook\r\nher, and ordered her to spit out anything she might have in her mouth;\r\nand then, when she found out it was mulberries, she cooled down all of\r\na sudden and told Polly she must be a good girl and never put anything\r\nin her mouth without asking first.\r\n\r\n"Now, the jam was boiled in great copper cauldrons, and I noticed a\r\nlittle pipkin simmering on the hearth, and I asked my stepmother what\r\nit was. And she answered carelessly, \'Oh, it\'s some mulberry jelly,\r\nsweetened with honey instead of sugar, for my old grandfather at home.\'\r\nAnd at the time I didn\'t give the matter another thought. But the\r\nevening before my father died ... and I\'ve never mentioned this to a\r\nsoul except my poor Peppercorn ... after supper he went and sat out in\r\nthe porch to smoke his pipe, leaving her and him to their own doings\r\nin the kitchen; for she\'d been brazen-faced enough, and my father weak\r\nenough, actually to have the fellow living there in the house. And my\r\nfather was a queer man in that way--too proud to sit where he wasn\'t\r\nwanted, even in his own kitchen. And I\'d come out, too, but I was hid\r\nfrom him by the corner of the house, for I had been waiting for the\r\nsun to go down to pick flowers, to take to a sick neighbour the next\r\nday. But I could hear him talking to his spaniel, Ginger, who was like\r\nhis shadow and followed him wherever he went. I remember his words as\r\nclearly as if it had been yesterday: \'Poor old Ginger!\' he said, \'I\r\nthought it would be me who would dig your grave. But it seems not,\r\nGinger, it seems not. Poor old lady, by this time tomorrow I\'ll be\r\nas dumb as you are ... and you\'ll miss our talks, poor Ginger.\' And\r\nthen Ginger gave a howl that made my blood curdle, and I came running\r\nround the corner of the house and asked father if he was ailing, and\r\nif I could fetch him anything. And he laughed, but it was as different\r\nas chalk from cheese from the way he laughed as a rule. For poor\r\nfather was a frank-hearted, open-handed man, and not one to hoard up\r\nbitterness any more than he would hoard up money; but that laugh--the\r\nlast I heard him give--was as bitter as gall. And he said, \'Well, Ivy,\r\nmy girl, would you like to fetch me some peonies and marigolds and\r\nshepherd\'s thyme from a hill where the Silent People have danced, and\r\nmake me a salad from them?\' And seeing me looking surprised, he laughed\r\nagain, and said, \'No, no. I doubt there are no flowers growing this\r\nside of the hills that could help your poor father. Come, give me a\r\nkiss--you\'ve always been a good girl.\' Now, these are flowers that old\r\nwives use in love potions, as I knew from my granny, who was very wise\r\nabout herbs and charms, but father had always laughed at her for it,\r\nand I supposed he was fretting over my stepmother and Pugwalker, and\r\nwondering if he could win her heart back to him.\r\n\r\n"But that night he died, and it was then that I started wondering\r\nabout that jelly in the pipkin, for him, liking scum as he did, and\r\nalways having a saucer of it set aside for him, it wouldn\'t have been\r\ndifficult to have boiled up some poison for him without any danger of\r\nother folks touching it. And Pugwalker knew all about herbs and such\r\nlike, and could have told her what to use. For it was as plain as\r\nprint that poor father knew he was going to die, and peonies make a\r\ngood purge; and I\'ve often wondered since if it was as a purge that he\r\nwanted these flowers. And that\'s all I know, and perhaps it isn\'t much,\r\nbut it\'s been enough to keep me awake many a night of my life wondering\r\nwhat I should have done if I\'d been older. For I was only a little maid\r\nof ten at the time, with no one I could talk to, and as frightened of\r\nmy stepmother as a bird of a snake. If I\'d been one of the witnesses, I\r\ndare say it would have come out in court, but I was too young for that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we could get hold of Diggory Carp?"\r\n\r\n"Diggory Carp?" she repeated in surprise. "But surely you heard what\r\nhappened to him? Ah, that was a sad story! You see, after he was sent\r\nto gaol, there came three or four terrible lean years, one after the\r\nother. And food was so dear, no one, of course, had any money for\r\nbuying fancy goods like baskets ... and the long and the short of it\r\nwas that when Diggory came out of gaol he found that his wife and\r\nchildren had died of starvation. And it seemed to turn his wits, and\r\nhe came up to our farm, raging against my stepmother, and vowing that\r\nsomeday he\'d get his own back on her. And that night he hanged himself\r\nfrom one of the trees in our orchard, and he was found there dead the\r\nnext morning."\r\n\r\n"A sad story," said Master Nathaniel. "Well, we must leave him out\r\nof our calculations. All you\'ve told me is very interesting--very\r\ninteresting indeed. But there\'s still a great deal to be unravelled\r\nbefore we get to the rope I\'m looking for. One thing I don\'t understand\r\nis Diggory Carp\'s story about the osiers. Was it a pure fabrication of\r\nhis?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Diggory! He wasn\'t, of course, the sort of man whose word one\r\nwould be very ready to take, for he did deserve his ten years--he was\r\na born thief. But I don\'t think he would have had the wits to invent\r\nall that. I expect the story he told was true enough about his daughter\r\nselling the osiers, but that it was only for basket-making that she\r\nwanted them. Guilt\'s a funny thing--like a smell, and one often doesn\'t\r\nquite know where it comes from. I think Diggory\'s nose was not mistaken\r\nwhen it smelt out guilt, but it led him to the wrong clue. My father\r\nwasn\'t poisoned by osiers."\r\n\r\n"Can you think what it was, then?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. "I\'ve told you everything I know."\r\n\r\n"I wish you knew something more definite," said Master Nathaniel a\r\nlittle fretfully. "The Law dearly loves something it can touch--a\r\nblood-stained knife and that sort of thing. And there\'s another matter\r\nthat puzzles me. Your father seems, on your showing, to have been\r\na very indulgent sort of husband, and to have kept his jealousy to\r\nhimself. What cause was there for the murder?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that I think I can explain to you," she cried. "You see, our farm\r\nwas very conveniently situated for ... well, for smuggling a certain\r\nthing that we don\'t mention. It stands in a sort of hollow between the\r\nmarches and the west road, and smugglers like a friendly, quiet place\r\nwhere they can run their goods. And my poor father, though he may have\r\nsat like a dumb animal in pain when his young wife was gallivanting\r\nwith her lover, all the same, if he had found out what was being\r\nstored in the granary, Pugwalker would have been kicked out of the\r\nhouse, and she could have whistled for him till she was black in the\r\nface. My father was easy-going enough in some ways, but there were\r\nplaces in him as hard as nails, and no woman, be she never so much of a\r\nfool (and, fair play to my stepmother, she was no fool), can live with\r\na man without finding out where these places are."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ho! So what Diggory Carp said about the contents of that sack was\r\ntrue, was it?" And Master Nathaniel inwardly thanked his stars that no\r\nharm had come to Ranulph during his stay in such a dangerous place.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was true, and no mistake; and, child though I was at the time,\r\nI cried through half one night with rage when they told me what the\r\nhussy had said in court about my father using the stuff as manure and\r\nher begging him not to! Begging him not to, indeed! I could have told\r\nthem a very different story. And it was Pugwalker that was at the back\r\nof that business, and got the granary key from her, so they could run\r\ntheir goods there. And shortly before my father died he got wind of\r\nit--I know that from something I overheard. The room I shared with my\r\nlittle brother Robin opened into theirs, and we always kept the door\r\najar, because Robin was a timid child, and fancied he couldn\'t go to\r\nsleep unless he heard my father snoring. Well, about a week before\r\nmy father died I heard him talking to her in a voice I\'d never known\r\nhim to use to her before. He said he\'d warned her twice already that\r\nyear, and that this was the last time. Up to that time he\'d held his\r\nhead high, he said, because his hands were clean and all his doings\r\nstraight and fair, and now he warned her for the last time that unless\r\nthis business was put a stop to once and for all, he\'d have Pugwalker\r\ntarred and feathered, and make the neighbourhood too hot for him to\r\nstay in it. And, I remember, I heard him hawking and spitting, as if\r\nhe\'d rid himself of something foul. And he said that the Gibbertys had\r\nalways been respected, and that the farm, ever since they had owned\r\nit, had helped to make the people of Dorimare straight-limbed and\r\nclean-blooded, for it had sent fresh meat and milk to market, and good\r\ngrain to the miller, and sweet grapes to the vintner, and that he would\r\nrather sell the farm than that poison and filth should be sent out of\r\nhis granary, to turn honest lads into idiots gibbering at the moon. And\r\nthen she started coaxing him, but she spoke too low for me to catch\r\nthe words. But she must have been making him some promise, for he said\r\ngruffly, \'Well, see that it\'s done, then, for I\'m a man of my word.\'\r\n\r\n"And in not much more than a week after that he was dead--poor father.\r\nAnd I count it a miracle that I ever grew up and am sitting here now\r\ntelling you all this. And a still greater one that little Robin grew\r\nup to be a man, for he inherited the farm. But it was her own little\r\ngirl that died, and Robin grew up and married, and though he died in\r\nhis prime it was through a quinsy in his throat, and he always got on\r\nwith our stepmother, and wouldn\'t hear a word against her. And she has\r\nbrought up his little girl, for her mother died when she was born. But\r\nI\'ve never seen the lass, for there was never any love lost between\r\nme and my stepmother, and I never went back to the old house after I\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\nShe paused, and in her eyes was that wistful, tranced look that always\r\ncomes when one has been gazing at things that happened to one long ago.\r\n\r\n"I see, I see," said Master Nathaniel meditatively. "And Pugwalker? Did\r\nyou ever see him again till you recognized him in the streets of Lud\r\nthe other day?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. "No, he disappeared, as I told you, just before the\r\ntrial. Though I don\'t doubt that she knew his whereabouts and heard\r\nfrom him--met him even; for she was always going out by herself after\r\nnightfall. Well, well, I\'ve told you everything I know--though perhaps\r\nI\'d have better held my tongue, for little good comes of digging up the\r\npast."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel said nothing; he was evidently pondering her story.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said finally, "everything you have told me has been very\r\ninteresting--very interesting indeed. But whether it will lead to\r\nanything definite is another matter. All the evidence is purely\r\ncircumstantial. However, I\'m very grateful to you for having spoken to\r\nme as freely as you\'ve done. And if I find out anything further I\'ll\r\nlet you know. I shall be leaving Lud shortly, but I shall keep in touch\r\nwith you. And, under the circumstances, perhaps it would be prudent to\r\nagree on some word or token by which you would recognize a messenger\r\nas really coming from me, for the fellow you knew as Pugwalker has\r\nnot grown less cunning with advancing years--he\'s full of guile, and\r\nlet him once get wind of what we\'re after, he\'d be up to all sorts of\r\ntricks to make our plans miscarry. What shall the token be?"\r\n\r\nThen his eyes began to twinkle: "I\'ve got it!" he cried. "Just to give\r\nyou a little lesson in swearing, which you say you dislike so much,\r\nwe\'ll make it a good round oath. You\'ll know a messenger comes from me\r\nif he greets you with the words, By the Sun, Moon and Stars and the\r\nGolden Apples of the West!"\r\n\r\nAnd he rubbed his hands in delight, and shouted with laughter. Master\r\nNathaniel was a born tease.\r\n\r\n"For shame, you saucy fellow!" dimpled Mistress Ivy. "You\'re as bad as\r\nmy poor Peppercorn. He used always...."\r\n\r\nBut even Master Nathaniel had had his fill of reminiscences. So he cut\r\nher short with a hearty good-bye, and renewed thanks for all she had\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nBut he turned back from the door to hold up his finger and say with\r\nmock solemnity, "Remember, it\'s to be By the Sun, Moon and Stars and\r\nthe Golden Apples of the West!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                     THE BERRIES OF MERCIFUL DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nLate into that night Master Nathaniel paced the floor of his pipe-room,\r\ntrying to pierce through the intervening medium of the dry words of the\r\nLaw and the vivider though less reliable one of Mistress Ivy\'s memory,\r\nand reach that old rustic tragedy, as it had been before the vultures\r\nof Time had left nothing of it but dry bones.\r\n\r\nHe felt convinced that Mistress Ivy\'s reconstruction was correct--as\r\nfar as it went. The farmer had been poisoned, though not by osiers. But\r\nby what? And what had been the part played by Pugwalker, alias Endymion\r\nLeer? It was, of course, gratifying to his vanity that his instinctive\r\nidentification of the two had been correct. But how tantalizing it\r\nwould be if this dead man\'s tale was to remain but a vague whisper, too\r\nlow to be heard by the ear of the Law!\r\n\r\nOn his table was the slipper that Master Ambrose had facetiously\r\nsuggested might be of use to him. He picked it up, and stared at it\r\nabsently. Ambrose had said the sight of it had made Endymion Leer\r\njump out of his skin, and that the reason was obvious. And yet those\r\npurple strawberries did not look like fairy fruit. Master Nathaniel had\r\nrecently become but too familiar with the aspect of that fruit not to\r\nrecognize it instantly, whatever its variety. Though he had never seen\r\nberries exactly like these, he was certain that they did not grow in\r\nFairyland.\r\n\r\nHe walked across to his bookcase and took out a big volume bound in\r\nvellum. It was a very ancient illustrated herbal of the plants of\r\nDorimare.\r\n\r\nAt first he turned its pages somewhat listlessly, as if he did not\r\nreally expect to find anything of interest. Then suddenly he came on\r\nan illustration, underneath which was written THE BERRIES OF MERCIFUL\r\nDEATH. He gave a low whistle, and fetching the slipper laid it beside\r\nthe picture. The painted berries and the embroidered ones were\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page the berries were described in a style that a\r\nliterary expert would have recognized as belonging to the Duke Aubrey\r\nperiod. The passage ran thus:--\r\n\r\n                     THE BERRIES OF MERCIFUL DEATH\r\n\r\n    These berries are wine-coloured, and crawl along the ground, and\r\n    have the leaves of wild strawberries. They ripen during the first\r\n    quarter of the harvest moon, and are only to be found in certain\r\n    valleys of the West, and even there they grow but sparsely; and,\r\n    for the sake of birds and children and other indiscreet lovers of\r\n    fruit, it is well that such is the case, for they are a deadly and\r\n    insidious poison, though very tardy in their action, often lying\r\n    dormant in the blood for many days. Then the poison begins to speak\r\n    in itchings of the skin, while the tongue, as though in punishment\r\n    for the lies it may have told, becomes covered with black spots, so\r\n    that it has the appearance of the shards of a ladybird, and this is\r\n    the only warning to the victim that his end is approaching. For, if\r\n    evil things ever partake of the blessed virtues, then we may say\r\n    that this malign berry is mercifully cruel, in that it spares its\r\n    victims belchings and retchings and fiery humours and racking\r\n    colics. And, shortly before his end, he is overtaken by a pleasant\r\n    drowsiness, yielding to which he falls into a peaceful sleep, which\r\n    is his last. And now I will give you a receipt, which, if you have\r\n    no sin upon your conscience, and are at peace with the living and\r\n    the dead, and have never killed a robin, nor robbed an orphan, nor\r\n    destroyed the nest of a dream, it may be will prove an antidote to\r\n    that poison--and may be it will not. This, then, is the receipt:\r\n    Take one pint of salad oil and put it into a vial glass, but first\r\n    wash it with rose-water, and marygold flower water, the flowers\r\n    being gathered towards the West. Wash it till the oil comes white;\r\n    then put it into the glass, and then put thereto the buds of\r\n    Peonies, the flowers of Marygold and the flowers and tops of\r\n    Shepherd\'s Thyme. The Thyme must be gathered near the side of a\r\n    hill where the Fairies are said to dance.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel laid down the book, and his eyes were more frightened\r\nthan triumphant. There was something sinister in the silent language in\r\nwhich dead men told their tales--with sly malice embroidering them on\r\nold maids\' canvas work, hiding them away in ancient books, written long\r\nbefore they were born; and why were his ears so attuned to this dumb\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\nFor him the old herbalist had been describing a murderer, subtle,\r\nsinister, mitigating dark deeds with mercy--a murderer, the touch of\r\nwhose bloody hands was balm to the sick in body, and whose voice could\r\nrock haunted minds to sleep. And, as well, in the light of what he\r\nalready knew, the old herbalist had told a story. A violent, cruel,\r\nreckless woman had wished to rid herself of her enemy by the first\r\nmeans that came to her hand--osiers, the sap of which produced an\r\nagonizing, cruel death. But her discreet though murderous lover took\r\nthe osiers from her, and gave her instead the berries of merciful death.\r\n\r\nThe herbalist had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the villain\r\nof the story was Endymion Leer.\r\n\r\nYes, but how should he make the dead tell their tale loud enough to\r\nreach the ear of the Law?\r\n\r\nIn any case, he must leave Lud, and that quickly.\r\n\r\nWhy should he not visit the scene of this old drama, the widow\r\nGibberty\'s farm? Perhaps he might there find witnesses who spoke a\r\nlanguage understood by all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning he ordered a horse to be saddled, packed a few\r\nnecessaries in a knapsack, and then he told Dame Marigold that, for\r\nthe present, he could not stay in Lud. "As for you," he said, "you had\r\nbetter move to Polydore\'s. For the moment I\'m the most unpopular man\r\nin town, and it would be just as well that they should think of you as\r\nVigil\'s sister rather than as Chanticleer\'s wife."\r\n\r\nDame Marigold\'s face was very pale that morning and her eyes were very\r\nbright. "Nothing would induce me," she said in a low voice, "ever again\r\nto cross the threshold of Polydore\'s house. I shall never forgive him\r\nfor the way he has treated you. No, I shall stay here--in your house.\r\nAnd," she added, with a little scornful laugh, "you needn\'t be anxious\r\nabout me. I\'ve never yet met a member of the lower classes that was a\r\nmatch for one of ourselves--they fall to heel as readily as a dog. I\'m\r\nnot a bit afraid of the mob, or anything they could do to me."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel chuckled. "By the Sun, Moon and Stars!" he cried\r\nproudly, "you\'re a chip off the old block, Marigold!"\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t stay too long away, Nat," she said, "or else when you come\r\nback you\'ll find that I\'ve gone mad like everybody else, and am dancing\r\nas wildly as Mother Tibbs, and singing songs about Duke Aubrey!" and\r\nshe smiled her charming crooked smile.\r\n\r\nThen he went up to say good-bye to old Hempie.\r\n\r\n"Well, Hempie," he cried gaily. "Lud\'s getting too hot for me. So I\'m\r\noff with a knapsack on my back to seek my fortune, like the youngest\r\nson in your old stories. Will you wish me luck?"\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the old woman\'s eyes as she looked at him, and then\r\nshe smiled.\r\n\r\n"Why, Master Nat," she cried, "I don\'t believe you\'ve felt so\r\nlight-hearted since you were a boy! But these are strange times when\r\na Chanticleer is chased out of Lud-in-the-Mist! And wouldn\'t I just\r\nlike to give those Vigils and the rest of them a bit of my mind!" and\r\nher old eyes flashed. "But don\'t you ever get downhearted, Master Nat,\r\nand don\'t ever forget that there have always been Chanticleers in\r\nLud-in-the-Mist, and that there always will be! But it beats me how\r\nyou\'re to manage with only three pairs of stockings, and no one to mend\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Well, Hempie," he laughed, "they say the Fairies are wonderfully\r\nneat-fingered, and, who knows, perhaps in my wanderings I may fall\r\nin with a fairy housewife who will darn my stockings for me," and he\r\nbrought out the forbidden word as lightly and easily as if it had been\r\none in daily use.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after Master Nathaniel had ridden away Luke Hempen\r\narrived at the house, wild-eyed, dishevelled, and with very startling\r\nnews. But it was impossible to communicate it to Master Nathaniel, as\r\nhe had left without telling anyone his destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                           WATCHING THE COWS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interval between his two letters--the one to Hempie, and the\r\none to Master Nathaniel--Luke decided that his suspicions had been\r\ngroundless, for the days at the farm were buzzing by with a soothing\r\nhum like that of summer insects, and Ranulph was growing gay and\r\nsunburned.\r\n\r\nThen towards autumn Ranulph had begun to wilt, and finally Luke\r\noverheard the strange conversation he had reported in his letter to\r\nMaster Nathaniel, and once again the farm grew hateful to him, and he\r\nfollowed Ranulph as if he were his shadow and counted the hours for the\r\norder to come from Master Nathaniel bidding them return to Lud.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you may remember that on his first evening at the farm Ranulph\r\nhad wanted to join the children who watched the widow\'s cows at night,\r\nbut it had evidently been nothing but a passing whim, for he did not\r\nexpress the wish again.\r\n\r\nAnd then at the end of June--as a matter of fact it was Midsummer\r\nday--the widow had asked him if he would not like that night to join\r\nthe little herdsmen. But towards evening had come a steady downfall of\r\nrain, and the plan had fallen through.\r\n\r\nIt was not alluded to again till the end of October, three or four\r\ndays before Master Nathaniel left Lud-in-the-Mist. It had been a very\r\nmild autumn in the West and the nights were fresh rather than cold,\r\nand when, that evening, the little boys came knocking at the door for\r\ntheir bread and cheese, the widow began to jeer at Ranulph, in a hearty\r\njovial way, for being town-bred and never having spent a night under\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go tonight with the little herdsmen? You wanted to when\r\nyou first came here, and the Doctor said it would do you no harm."\r\n\r\nNow Luke was feeling particularly downcast that night; no answer had\r\ncome from Master Nathaniel to his letter, though it was well over a\r\nweek since he had written. He felt forlorn and abandoned, with a weight\r\nof responsibility too heavy for his shoulders, and he was certainly\r\nnot going to add to that weight by allowing Ranulph to run the risk of\r\ncatching a bad chill. And as well, any suggestion that came from the\r\nwidow was greeted by him with suspicion.\r\n\r\n"Master Ranulph," he cried excitedly, "I can\'t let you go. His Worship\r\nand my old auntie wouldn\'t like it, what with the nights getting damp\r\nand all. No, Master Ranulph, be a good little chap and go to your bed\r\nas usual."\r\n\r\nAs he was speaking he caught Hazel\'s eye, and she gave him an almost\r\nimperceptible nod of approval.\r\n\r\nBut the widow cried, with a loud scornful laugh, in which Ranulph\r\nshrilly joined: "Too damp, indeed! When we haven\'t had so much as a\r\ndrop of rain these four weeks! Don\'t let yourself be coddled, Master\r\nRanulph. Young Hempen\'s nothing but an old maid in breeches. He\'s as\r\nbad as my Hazel. I\'ve always said that if she doesn\'t die an old maid,\r\nit isn\'t that she wasn\'t born one!"\r\n\r\nHazel said nothing, but she fixed her eyes beseechingly on Luke.\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph, I fear, was a very spoiled little boy, and, into the\r\nbargain, he dearly loved annoying Luke; so he jumped up and down,\r\nshouting, "Old maid Hempen! Old maid Hempen! I\'m going--so there!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, little master!" laughed the widow. "You\'ll be a man\r\nbefore I am."\r\n\r\nAnd the three little herdsmen, who had been watching this scene with\r\nshy amusement, grinned from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n"Do as you like, then," said Luke sullenly, "but I\'m coming too. And,\r\nanyway, you must wrap up as warmly as you can."\r\n\r\nSo they went upstairs to put on their boots and mufflers.\r\n\r\nWhen they came down Hazel, with compressed lips and a little frown\r\nknitting her brows, gave them their rations of cheese and bread and\r\nhoney, and then, with a furtive glance in the direction of the widow,\r\nwho was standing with her back turned, talking to the little herdsmen,\r\nshe slipped two sprigs of fennel into Luke\'s button-hole. "Try and get\r\nMaster Ranulph to wear one of them," she whispered.\r\n\r\nThis was not reassuring. But how is an undergardener, not yet turned\r\neighteen, to curb the spoiled son of his master--especially when a\r\nstrong-willed, elderly woman throws her weight into the other scale?\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the widow, bustling up, "it\'s high time you were\r\noff. You have a full three miles walk before you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, let\'s be off!" cried Ranulph excitedly; Luke felt it would\r\nbe useless to protest further, so the little cavalcade dived into the\r\nmoonlit night.\r\n\r\nThe world was looking very beautiful. At one end of the scale of\r\ndarkness stood the pines, like rich black shadows; at the other end of\r\nthe scale were the farm buildings, like white glimmering human masks.\r\nAnd in between these two extremes were all the various degrees of\r\ngreyness--the shimmer of the Dapple that was more white than grey, and\r\nall the different trees--plane-trees, liege-oaks, olives--and one could\r\nalmost recognize their foliage by their lesser or greater degree of\r\ndensity.\r\n\r\nOn they trudged in silence, up the course of the Dapple--Luke too\r\nanxious and aggrieved to talk, Ranulph buried too deep in dreams, and\r\nthe little herdsmen far too shy. There were nothing but rough cattle\r\npaths in the valley--heavy enough going by day, and doubly so by night,\r\nand before they had yet gone half the way Ranulph\'s feet began to lag.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to rest a bit and then go back?" said Luke eagerly.\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph shook his head scornfully and mended his pace.\r\n\r\nNor did he allow himself to lag again till they reached their\r\ndestination--a little oasis of rich pasturage, already on rising ground\r\nthough still a mile or two away from the hills.\r\n\r\nOnce here--in their own kingdom, as it were--the little herdsmen became\r\nlively and natural; laughing and chatting with Ranulph, as they set\r\nabout repairing such breaches as had been made in the huts by the rough\r\nand tumble of twelve odd hours. Then there was wood to be collected,\r\nand a fire to be lit--and into these tasks Ranulph threw himself with a\r\ngay, though rather feverish, vigour.\r\n\r\nAt last they settled down to their long watch--squatting round the\r\nfire, and laughing for sheer love of adventure as good campaigners\r\nshould; for were there not marching towards them some eight dark hours\r\nequipped with who could say what curious weapons from the rich arsenal\r\nof night and day?\r\n\r\nThe cattle crouched round them in soft shadowy clumps, placidly\r\nmunching, and dreaming with wide-open eyes. The narrow zone of colour\r\ncreated by the fire-light was like the planet Earth--a little freak of\r\nbrightness in a universe of impenetrable shadows.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Luke noticed that each of the three little herdsmen was, like\r\nhimself, wearing a sprig of fennel.\r\n\r\n"I say! why are all you little chaps wearing fennel?" he blurted out.\r\n\r\nThey stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"But you be wearing a bit yourself, Master Hempen," said Toby, the\r\neldest.\r\n\r\n"I know"--and he could not resist adding in an offhand tone--"it was\r\na present from a young lady. But do you always wear a bit in these\r\nparts?" he added.\r\n\r\n"Always on this night of the year," said the children. And as Luke\r\nlooked puzzled, Toby cried in surprise, "Don\'t you wear fennel in Lud\r\non the last night of October?"\r\n\r\n"No, we don\'t," answered Luke, a little crossly, "and why should we, I\r\nshould like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Why," cried Toby in a shocked voice, "because this is the night when\r\nthe Silent People--the dead, you know--come back to Dorimare."\r\n\r\nRanulph looked up quickly. But Luke scowled; he was sick to death of\r\nwestern superstitions, and into the bargain he was feeling frightened.\r\nHe removed the second sprig of fennel given him by Hazel from his\r\nbutton-hole, and holding it out to Ranulph, said, "Here, Master\r\nRanulph! Stick that in your hatband or somewhere."\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph shook his head. "I don\'t want any fennel, thank you, Luke,"\r\nhe said. "I\'m not frightened."\r\n\r\nThe children gazed at him in half-shocked admiration, and Luke sighed\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n"Not frightened of ... the Silent People?" queried Toby.\r\n\r\n"No," answered Ranulph curtly. And then he added, "At least not\r\ntonight."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wager the widow Gibberty, at any rate, isn\'t wearing any fennel,"\r\nsaid Luke, with a harsh laugh.\r\n\r\nThe children exchanged queer little glances and began to snigger. This\r\naroused Luke\'s curiosity: "Now then, out with it, youngsters! Why\r\ndoesn\'t the widow Gibberty wear fennel?"\r\n\r\nBut their only answer was to nudge each other, and snigger behind their\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nThis put Luke on his mettle. "Look here, you bantams," he cried, "don\'t\r\nyou forget that you\'ve got the High Seneschal\'s son here, and if you\r\nknow anything about the widow that\'s ... well, that\'s a bit fishy, it\'s\r\nyour duty to let me know. If you don\'t, you may find yourselves in gaol\r\nsome day. So you just spit it out!" and he glared at them as fiercely\r\nas his kindly china-blue eyes would allow.\r\n\r\nThey began to look scared. "But the widow doesn\'t know we\'ve seen\r\nanything ... and if she found out, and that we\'d been blabbing, oh my!\r\nwouldn\'t we catch it!" cried Toby, and his eyes grew round with terror\r\nat the mere thought.\r\n\r\n"No, you won\'t catch it. I\'ll give you my word," said Luke. "And if\r\nyou\'ve really anything worth telling, the Seneschal will be very\r\ngrateful, and each of you may find yourselves with more money in your\r\npockets than your three fathers put together have ever had in all their\r\nlives. And, anyhow, to begin with, if you\'ll tell me what you know,\r\nyou can toss up for this knife, and there\'s not a finer one to be\r\nfound in all Lud," and he waved before their dazzled eyes his greatest\r\ntreasure, a magnificent six-bladed knife, given him one Yule-tide by\r\nMaster Nathaniel, with whom he had always been a favourite. At the\r\nsight of this marvel of cutlery, the little boys proved venal, and in\r\nvoices scarcely above a whisper and with frequent frightened glances\r\nover their shoulders, as if the widow might be lurking in the shadows\r\nlistening to them, they told their story.\r\n\r\nOne night, just before dawn, a cow called Cornflower, from the\r\nunusually blue colour of her hide, who had recently been added to the\r\nherd, suddenly grew restless and began to moo, the strange moo of blue\r\ncows that was like the cooing of doves, and then rose to her feet and\r\ntrotted away into the darkness. Now Cornflower was a very valuable cow\r\nand the widow had given them special injunctions to look after her, so\r\nToby, leaving the other two to mind the rest of the herd, dashed after\r\nher into the thinning darkness and though she had got a good start of\r\nhim was able to keep in her track by the tinkling of her bell. Finally\r\nhe came on her standing at the brink of the Dapple and nozzling the\r\nwater. He went close up to her and found that she had got her teeth\r\ninto something beneath the surface of the stream and was tearing at it\r\nin intense excitement. Just then who should drive up in a cart but the\r\nwidow and Doctor Endymion Leer. They appeared much annoyed at finding\r\nToby, but they helped him get Cornflower away from the water. Bits of\r\nstraw were hanging from her mouth and it was stained with juices of a\r\ncolour he had never seen before. The widow then told him to go back to\r\nhis companions, and said she would herself take Cornflower back to the\r\nherd in the morning. And, to account for her sudden appearance on the\r\nscene, she said she had come with the doctor to try and catch a very\r\nrare fish that only rose to the surface an hour before sunrise. "But\r\nyou see," went on Toby, "my dad\'s a great fisherman, and often takes me\r\nout with him, but he never told me about this fish in the Dapple that\r\ncan only be caught before sunrise, and I thought I\'d just like to have\r\na peep at it. So instead of going back to the others right away, I hid,\r\nI did, behind some trees. And they took some nets, they did, out of the\r\ncart, but it wasn\'t fish they drew up in them ... no it wasn\'t." He was\r\nsuddenly seized with embarrassment, and he and his two little friends\r\nagain began to snigger.\r\n\r\n"Out with it!" cried Luke impatiently. "What was in their nets? You\'ll\r\nnot get the knife for only half a story, you know."\r\n\r\n"You say, Dorian," said Toby bashfully, nudging the second eldest boy;\r\nbut Dorian, too, would only giggle and hang his head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind saying!" cried Peter, the youngest, valiantly. "It was\r\nfairy fruit--that\'s what it was!"\r\n\r\nLuke sprang to his feet. "Busty Bridget!" he exclaimed in a horrified\r\nvoice. Ranulph began to chuckle. "Didn\'t you guess right away what it\r\nwas, Luke?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," went on Peter, much elated by the effect his words had produced,\r\n"it was wicker baskets all full of fairy fruit, I know, because\r\nCornflower had torn off the top of one of them."\r\n\r\n"Yes," interrupted Toby, beginning to think that little Peter had\r\nstolen enough of his thunder, "she had torn off the top of one of the\r\nbaskets, and I\'ve never seen fruit like it; it was as if coloured stars\r\nhad fallen from the sky into the grass, and were making all of the\r\nvalley bright, and Cornflower, she was eating as if she would never\r\nstop ... more like a bee among flowers, she was, than a common cow. And\r\nthe widow and the doctor, though of course they were put out, they\r\ncouldn\'t help laughing to see her. And her milk the next morning--oh\r\nmy! It tasted of roses and shepherd\'s thyme, but she never came back\r\nto the herd, for the widow sold her to a farmer who lived twenty miles\r\naway, and...."\r\n\r\nBut Luke could contain himself no longer. "You little rascals!" he\r\ncried, "to think of all the trouble there is in Lud just now, and the\r\nmagistrates and the town guard racking their brains to find out how the\r\nstuff gets across the border, and three little bantams like you knowing\r\nall about it, and not telling a soul! Why did you keep it to yourselves\r\nlike that?"\r\n\r\n"We were frightened of the widow," said Toby sheepishly. "You won\'t\r\ntell that we\'ve blabbed," he added in an imploring voice.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll see that you don\'t get into trouble," said Luke. "Here\'s the\r\nknife, and a coin to toss up for it with ... toasted Cheese! A nice\r\nplace this, we\'ve come to! Are you sure, young Toby, it was Dr. Leer\r\nyou saw?" Toby nodded his head emphatically. "Aye, it was Dr. Leer and\r\nno mistake--here\'s my hand on it." And he stuck out a brown little paw.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m blessed! Dr. Leer!" exclaimed Luke; and Ranulph gave a\r\nlittle mocking laugh.\r\n\r\nLuke fell into a brown study; surprise, indignation, and pleasant\r\nvisions of himself swaggering in Lud, praised and flattered by all as\r\nthe man who had run the smugglers to earth, chasing each other across\r\nthe surface of his brain. And, in the light of Toby\'s story, could it\r\nbe that the stranger whose mysterious conversation with the widow he\r\nhad overheard was none other than the popular, kindly doctor, Endymion\r\nLeer? It seemed almost incredible.\r\n\r\nBut on one thing he was resolved--for once he would assert himself, and\r\nRanulph should not spend another night at the widow Gibberty\'s farm.\r\n\r\nToby won the toss and pocketed the knife with a grin of satisfaction,\r\nand by degrees the talk became as flickering and intermittent as the\r\nlight of the dying fire, which they were too idle to feed with sticks;\r\nand finally it was quenched to silence, and they yielded to the curious\r\ndrugged sensation that comes from being out of doors and wide awake at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the earth had been transported to the sky, and they\r\nhad been left behind in chaos, and were gazing up at its towns and\r\nbeasts and heroes flattened out in constellations and looking like the\r\nstippled pictures in a neolithic cave. And the Milky Way was the only\r\nroad visible in the universe.\r\n\r\nNow and then a toad harped on its one silvery note, and from time to\r\ntime a little breeze would spring up and then die down.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ranulph broke the silence with the startling question, "How\r\nfar is it from here to Fairyland?"\r\n\r\nThe little boys nudged one another and again began to snigger behind\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n"For shame, Master Ranulph!" cried Luke indignantly, "talking like that\r\nbefore youngsters!"\r\n\r\n"But I want to know!" said Ranulph petulantly.\r\n\r\n"Tell what your old granny used to say, Dorian," giggled Toby.\r\n\r\nAnd Dorian was finally persuaded to repeat the old saying: "A thousand\r\nleagues by the great West Road and ten by the Milky Way."\r\n\r\nRanulph sprang to his feet, and with rather a wild laugh, he cried,\r\n"Let\'s have a race to Fairyland. I bet it will be me that gets there\r\nfirst. One, two, three--and away!"\r\n\r\nAnd he would actually have plunged off into the darkness, had not the\r\nlittle boys, half shocked, half admiring, flung themselves on him and\r\ndragged him back.\r\n\r\n"There\'s an imp of mischief got into you tonight, Master Ranulph,"\r\ngrowled Luke.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t joke about things like that ... specially tonight,\r\nMaster Chanticleer," said Toby gravely.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right there, young Toby," said Luke, "I only wish he had half\r\nyour sense."\r\n\r\n"It was just a bit of fun, wasn\'t it, Master Chanticleer? You didn\'t\r\nreally want us to race to ... yonder?" asked little Peter, peering\r\nthrough the darkness at Ranulph with scared eyes.\r\n\r\n"Of course it was only fun," said Luke.\r\n\r\nBut Ranulph said nothing.\r\n\r\nAgain they lapsed into silence. And all round them, subject to blind\r\ntaciturn laws, and heedless of man, myriads of things were happening,\r\nin the grass, in the trees, in the sky.\r\n\r\nLuke yawned and stretched himself. "It must be getting near dawn," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThey had successfully doubled the dangerous cape of midnight, and he\r\nbegan to feel secure of safely weathering what remained of their dark\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour when night-watchers begin to idealize their bed, and,\r\nwith Sancho Panza, to bless the man who invented it. They shuddered,\r\nand drew their cloaks closer round their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThen, something happened. It was not so much a modification of the\r\ndarkness, as a sigh of relief, a slight relaxing of tension, so that\r\none felt, rather than saw, that the night had suddenly lost a shade\r\nof its density ... ah! yes; there! between these two shoulders of the\r\nhills she is bleeding to death.\r\n\r\nAt first the spot was merely a degree less black than the rest of the\r\nsky. Then it turned grey, then yellow, then red. And the earth was\r\nundergoing the same transformation. Here and there patches of greyness\r\nbroke out in the blackness of the grass, and after a few seconds one\r\nsaw that they were clumps of flowers. Then the greyness became filtered\r\nwith a delicate sea-green; and next, one realized that the grey-green\r\nbelonged to the foliage, against which the petals were beginning to\r\nshow white--and then pink, or yellow, or blue; but a yellow like that\r\nof primroses, a blue like that of certain wild periwinkles, colours so\r\nelusive that one suspects them to be due to some passing accident of\r\nlight, and that, were one to pick the flower, it would prove to be pure\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nAh, there can be no doubt of it now! The blues and yellows are real and\r\nperdurable. Colour is steadily flowing through the veins of the earth,\r\nand we may take heart, for she will soon be restored to life again. But\r\nhad we kept one eye on the sky we should have noticed that a star was\r\nquenched with every flower that reappeared on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd now the valley is again red and gold with vineyards, the hills are\r\nclothed with pines, and the Dapple is rosy.\r\n\r\nThen a cock crowed, and another answered it, and then another--a\r\nghostly sound, which, surely, did not belong to the smiling, triumphant\r\nearth, but rather to one of those distant dying stars.\r\n\r\nBut what had taken Ranulph? He had sprung to his feet and was standing\r\nmotionless, a strange light in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd then again, from a still more distant star, it seemed, another cock\r\ncrowed, and another answered it.\r\n\r\n"The piper! the piper!" cried Ranulph in a loud triumphant voice.\r\nAnd, before his astonished companions could get to their feet, he was\r\ndashing up one of the bridle-paths towards the Debatable Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                           THE OLD GOATHERD\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds they stood petrified, and then Luke was seized with\r\npanic, and, calling to the little boys to stay where they were, dashed\r\noff in pursuit.\r\n\r\nUp the path he pounded, from time to time shouting angrily to Ranulph\r\nto come back, but the distance between them grew ever wider.\r\n\r\nLuke\'s ears began to sing and his brain to turn to fire, and he seemed\r\nto lose all sense of reality--it was not on the earth that he was\r\nrunning, but through the airless deserts of space.\r\n\r\nHe could not have said how long he struggled on, for he who runs hard\r\nleaves time behind as well as space. But finally his strength gave way,\r\nand he fell, breathless and exhausted, to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen he had sufficiently recovered to think of starting again the\r\ndiminishing speck that had been Ranulph had completely vanished.\r\n\r\nPoor Luke began to swear--at both Ranulph and himself.\r\n\r\nJust then he heard a tinkle of bells, and down the bridle-path came a\r\nherd of goats and a very ancient herdsman--to judge, at least, from his\r\nbowed walk, for his face was hidden by a hood.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got up to Luke, he stood still, leaning heavily on his\r\nstick, and peered down at him from underneath the overhanging flap of\r\nhis hood with a pair of very bright eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been running hard, young master, by the looks of ye," he said,\r\nin a quavering voice. "You be the second young fellow as what I\'ve seen\r\nrunning this morning."\r\n\r\n"The second?" cried Luke eagerly. "Was the other a little lad of about\r\ntwelve years old with red hair, in a green leathern jerkin embroidered\r\nin gold?"\r\n\r\n"Well, his hair was red and no mistake, though as to the jerkin...."\r\nAnd here he was seized with a violent attack of coughing, and it took\r\nall Luke\'s patience not to grab him by the shoulders and shake the\r\nwords out of him.\r\n\r\n"Though as to the jerkin--my eyes not being as sharp as they once\r\nwere...."\r\n\r\n"Oh! never mind about the jerkin," cried Luke. "Did you stop and speak\r\nto him?"\r\n\r\n"But about that jerkin--you do cut an old man short, you do ... it\r\nmight have been green, but then again it might have been yellow. But\r\nthe young gentleman what I saw was not the one as you\'re after."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Why, because he was the Seneschal\'s son--the one I saw," said the old\r\nman proudly, as if the fact put him at once into a superior position to\r\nLuke.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s the Seneschal\'s son--Master Ranulph Chanticleer, that I\'m\r\nafter, too!" cried Luke, eagerly. "How long is it since you saw him? I\r\nmust catch up with him."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not do that, on your two feet," said the goatherd calmly. "That\r\nyoung gentleman, and his yellow jerkin and his red hair, must be well\r\non the way to Moongrass by now."\r\n\r\n"To Moongrass?" And Luke stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Aye, to Moongrass, where the cheeses come from. You see it was this\r\nway. I\'m goatherd to the Lud yeomanry what the Seneschal has sent to\r\nwatch the border to keep out you know what. And who should come running\r\ninto their camp about half an hour ago with his red jerkin and his\r\ngreen hair but your young gentleman. \'Halt!\' cries the Yeoman on guard.\r\n\'Let me pass. I\'m young Master Chanticleer,\' cries he. \'And where are\r\nyou bound for?\' cries the Yeoman on guard. \'For Fairyland,\' says he.\r\nAnd then didn\'t they all laugh! And the little chap flew into quite a\r\nrage, and said he was off to Fairyland, and no one should stop him.\r\nAnd, of course, that just made them laugh all the more. But though they\r\nwouldn\'t let him go to Fairyland, the young rascal...." And here the\r\nold man was seized with a paroxysm of wheezy laughter which brought on\r\nanother bout of coughing.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying," he went on, when he had recovered, "they\r\nwouldn\'t let him through to Fairyland, but they said they would ride\r\nback with him where he came from. \'No, you won\'t,\' says he; \'my dad,\'\r\nsays he, \'don\'t want me to go back there, never any more.\' And he\r\nwhisks out a letter signed by the Seneschal, bidding him leave the\r\nwidow Gibberty\'s farm, where he was staying, and go straight off to\r\nFarmer Jellygreen\'s at Moongrass. So one of the Yeomen saddled his\r\nhorse, and the youngster got up behind him, and they set off for\r\nMoongrass by one of the cattle-paths running northeast, which comes out\r\nat about the middle of the road between Swan and Moongrass. So that\'s\r\nthat, my young fellow." In his relief Luke tossed his cap into the air.\r\n\r\n"The young rascal!" he cried joyfully; "fancy his never having told me\r\nhe\'d got a letter from his Worship, and me expecting that letter for\r\nthe last three days, and getting stomach-ache with worry at its not\r\ncoming! And saying he was off to a certain place, too! A nice fright\r\nhe\'s given me. But thank\'ee, gaffer, thank\'ee kindly. And here\'s\r\nsomething for you to drink the health of Master Ranulph Chanticleer,"\r\nand with a heart as light as a bird\'s, he began to retrace his steps\r\ndown the valley.\r\n\r\nBut what was that faint sound behind him? It sounded suspiciously like\r\nthe Ho, ho, hoh! of that impudent Willy Wisp, who for a short time, had\r\nbeen one of his Worship\'s grooms.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked round. No one was visible except the old\r\ngoatherd in the distance, leaning on his stick. What he had heard could\r\nhave been nothing but the distant tinkle of the goat bells.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the farm, he found it in a tumult. The little boys had\r\nfrightened Hazel out of her wits, and confirmed her worst fears by the\r\nnews that "Master Ranulph had run away towards the hills, and that\r\nMaster Hempen had run after him."\r\n\r\n"Granny!" cried Hazel, wringing her hands, "a messenger must be sent\r\noff post-haste to the Seneschal!"\r\n\r\n"Stuff and nonsense!" cried the widow, angrily. "You mind your own\r\nbusiness, miss! Long before any messenger could reach Lud, the lads\r\nwill be back safe and sound. Towards the hills, indeed! That Luke\r\nHempen is a regular old woman. It\'s just a bit of Master Ranulph\'s fun.\r\nHe\'s hiding behind a tree, and will jump out on them with a \'Boo!\'\r\nNever in my life have I heard so much fuss about nothing." And then,\r\nturning to the farm-servants, who were clustering round the children\r\nwith scared, excited eyes, she bade them go about their business, and\r\nlet her hear no more nonsense.\r\n\r\nHer words sounded like good sense, but, for all that, they did not\r\nconvince Hazel. Her deep distrust of the widow was almost as old as\r\nherself, and her instinct had told her for some time that the widow was\r\nhostile to Ranulph.\r\n\r\nNever for a moment did Hazel forget that she, not the widow, was the\r\nrightful owner of the farm. Should she for once assert her position,\r\nand, in direct defiance of the widow, report what had happened to the\r\nlaw-man of the district and send a messenger to Master Nathaniel?\r\n\r\nBut, as everybody knows, legal rights can be but weaklings--puny little\r\nchild princes, cowed by their bastard uncles, Precedent and Seniority.\r\n\r\nNo, she must wait till she was of age, or married, or ... was there any\r\nchange of condition that could alter her relations with the widow, and\r\ndestroy the parasite growth of sullen docility which, for as long as\r\nshe could remember, had rotted her volition and warped her actions?\r\n\r\nHazel clenched her fists and set her teeth ... she would assert\r\nherself!--she would!... now, at once? Why not give them, say, till\r\nnoon, to come back? Yes, she would give them till noon.\r\n\r\nBut before then, a rather shame-faced Luke arrived with his confession\r\nthat Master Ranulph had made proper fools of them.\r\n\r\n"So, Miss Hazel, if you\'ll give me a bite of something, and lend me\r\na horse, I\'ll go after the young scamp to Moongrass. To think of his\r\ngiving us the slip like that and never having told me he\'d heard from\r\nhis father! And there was me expecting a letter from his Worship every\r\nday, telling us to leave at once, and...."\r\n\r\nHazel raised her eyebrows. "You were expecting a letter ordering you to\r\nleave us? How was that?"\r\n\r\nLuke turned red, and mumbled something inaudible. Hazel stared at him\r\nfor a few seconds in silence, and then she said quietly, "I\'m afraid\r\nyou were wise if you asked the Seneschal to remove Master Ranulph."\r\n\r\nHe gave her a shrewd glance. "Yes ... I fear this is no place for\r\nMaster Ranulph. But if you\'d excuse me for being so bold, miss, I\'d\r\nlike to give you a word of warning--don\'t you trust that Endymion Leer\r\nfurther than you can see him, and don\'t you ever let your Granny take\r\nyou out fishing!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Master Hempen, but I am quite able to look after myself,"\r\nsaid Hazel haughtily. And then an anxious look came into her eyes. "I\r\nhope--oh! I hope that you\'ll find Master Ranulph safe and sound at\r\nMoongrass! It\'s all so ... well, so very strange. That old goatherd,\r\nwho do you suppose he was? One meets strange people near the Elfin\r\nMarches. You\'ll let me know if all is well ... won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nLuke promised. Hazel\'s words had dampened his spirits and brought back\r\nall his anxiety, and the fifteen miles to Moongrass, in spite of a good\r\nhorse, seemed interminable.\r\n\r\nAlas! there was no Ranulph at the Jellygreens\' farm; but, to Luke\'s\r\nbewilderment, it turned out that the farmer had been expecting him, as\r\nhe had, a few days previously, received a letter from Master Nathaniel,\r\nfrom which it was clear that he imagined his son was already at\r\nMoongrass. So there was nothing for Luke but, with a heavy heart, to\r\nstart off the next morning for Lud, where, as we have seen, he arrived\r\na few hours after Master Nathaniel had left it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                           WHO IS PORTUNUS?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout half-way to Swan, Master Nathaniel, having tethered his horse\r\nto a tree, was reclining drowsily under the shade of another. It was\r\nmidday, and the further west he rode the warmer it grew; it was rather\r\nas if he were riding backward through the months.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was aroused by a dry little laugh, and looking round, he\r\nsaw crouching beside him, an odd-looking old man, with very bright eyes.\r\n\r\n"By my Great-aunt\'s rump, and who may you be?" enquired Master\r\nNathaniel testily.\r\n\r\nThe old man shut his eyes, gulped several times, and replied:\r\n\r\n    "Who are you? Who is me?\r\n    Answer my riddle and come and see,"\r\n\r\nand then he stamped impatiently, as if that had not been what he had\r\nwished to say.\r\n\r\n"Some cracked old rustic, I suppose," thought Master Nathaniel, and\r\nclosed his eyes; in the hopes that when the old fellow saw he was not\r\ninclined for conversation he would go away.\r\n\r\nBut the unwelcome visitor continued to crouch beside him, now and then\r\ngiving him little jogs in the elbow, which was very irritating when one\r\nhappened to be hot and tired and longing for forty winks.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" cried Master Nathaniel irritably.\r\n\r\n    "I milk blue ewes; I reap red flowers,\r\n    I weave the story of dead hours,"\r\n\r\nanswered the old man.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you? Well, I wish you\'d go now, this moment, and milk your red\r\newes ... I want to go to sleep," and he pulled his hat further down\r\nover his eyes and pretended to snore.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he sprang to his feet with a yap of pain. The old man had\r\nprodded him in his belly, and was standing looking at him out of his\r\nstartlingly bright eyes, with his head slightly on one side.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you try that on, old fellow!" cried Master Nathaniel angrily.\r\n"You\'re a nuisance, that\'s what you are. Why can\'t you leave me alone?"\r\n\r\nThe old man pointed eagerly at the tree, making little inarticulate\r\nsounds; it was as if a squirrel or a bird had been charged with some\r\nmessage that they could not deliver.\r\n\r\nThen he crept up to him, put his mouth to his ear, and whispered, "What\r\nis it that\'s a tree, and yet not a tree, a man and yet not a man, who\r\nis dumb and yet can tell secrets, who has no arms and yet can strike?"\r\n\r\nThen he stepped back a few paces as if he wished to observe the\r\nimpression his words had produced, and stood rubbing his hands and\r\ncackling gleefully.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must humour him," thought Master Nathaniel; so he said\r\ngood-naturedly, "Well, and what\'s the answer to your riddle, eh?"\r\n\r\nBut the old man seemed to have lost the power of articulate speech, and\r\ncould only reiterate eagerly, "Dig ... dig ... dig."\r\n\r\n"\'Dig, dig, dig.\' ... so that\'s the answer, is it? Well, I\'m afraid I\r\ncan\'t stay here the whole afternoon trying to guess your riddles. If\r\nyou\'ve got anything to tell me, can\'t you say it any plainer?"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered the old superstition that when the Silent People\r\nreturned to Dorimare they could only speak in riddles and snatches of\r\nrhyme. He looked at the old man searchingly. "Who are you?" he said.\r\n\r\nBut the answer was the same as before. "Dig ... dig ... dig."\r\n\r\n"Try again. Perhaps after a bit the words will come more easily," said\r\nMaster Nathaniel. "You are trying to tell me your name."\r\n\r\nThe old man shut his eyes tight, took a long breath, and,\r\nevidently making a tremendous effort, brought out very slowly,\r\n"Seize--your--op-por-tun-us. Dig ... dig. Por-tun-us is my name."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve got it out at last. So your name is Portunus, is it?"\r\n\r\nBut the old man stamped his foot impatiently. "Hand! hand!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Is it that you want to shake hands with me, old fellow?" asked Master\r\nNathaniel.\r\n\r\nBut the old man shook his head peevishly. "Farm hand," he managed to\r\nbring out. "Dig ... dig."\r\n\r\nAnd then he lapsed into doggerel:\r\n\r\n    "Dig and delve, delve and dig,\r\n    Harness the mare to the farmer\'s gig."\r\n\r\nFinally Master Nathaniel gave up trying to get any sense out of him and\r\nuntethered his horse. But when he tried to mount, the old man seized\r\nthe stirrup and looking up at him imploringly, repeated, "Dig ...\r\ndig ... dig." And Master Nathaniel was obliged to shake him off with\r\nsome roughness. And even after he had left him out of sight he could\r\nhear his voice in the distance, shouting, "Dig ... dig."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the old fellow was trying to tell me," said Master\r\nNathaniel to himself.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the following day he arrived at the village of\r\nSwan-on-the-Dapple.\r\n\r\nHere the drama of autumn had only just reached its gorgeous climax, and\r\nthe yellow and scarlet trees were flaming out their silent stationary\r\naction against the changeless chorus of pines, dark green against the\r\ndistant hills.\r\n\r\n"By the Golden Apples of the West!" muttered Master Nathaniel, "I\'d no\r\nidea those accursed hills were so near. I\'m glad Ranulph\'s safe away."\r\n\r\nHaving inquired his way to the Gibbertys\' farm, he struck off the high\r\nroad into the valley--and very lovely it was looking in its autumn\r\ncolouring. The vintage was over, and the vines were now golden and red.\r\nSome of the narrow oblong leaves of the wild cherry had kept their\r\nbottle-green, while others, growing on the same twig, had turned to\r\nsalmon-pink, and the mulberries alternated between canary-yellow and\r\ngrass-green. The mountain ash had turned a fiery rose (more lovely,\r\neven, than had been its scarlet berries) and often an olive grew beside\r\nit, as if ready, lovingly, to quench its fire in its own tender grey.\r\nThe birches twinkled and quivered, as if each branch were a golden\r\ndivining rod trembling to secret water; and the path was strewn with\r\nolives, looking like black oblong dung. It was one of those mysterious\r\nautumn days that are intensely bright though the sun is hidden; and\r\nwhen one looked at these lambent trees one could almost fancy them the\r\nsource of the light flooding the valley.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a tiny yellow butterfly would flit past, like a\r\nlittle yellow leaf shed by one of the birches; and now and then one of\r\nthe bleeding, tortured looking liege-oaks would drop an acorn, with a\r\nlittle flop--just to remind you, as it were, that it was leading its\r\nown serene, vegetable life, oblivious to the agony ascribed to it by\r\nthe fevered fancy of man.\r\n\r\nNot a soul did Master Nathaniel pass after he had left the village,\r\nthough from time to time he saw in the distance labourers following the\r\nplough through the vineyards, and their smocks provided the touch of\r\nblue that turns a picture into a story; there was blue smoke, too, to\r\ntell of human habitations; and an occasional cock strutting up and down\r\nin front of one of the red vines, like a salesman before his wares,\r\nflaunting, by way of advertisement, a crest of the same material as\r\nthe vine leaves, but of a more brilliant hue; and in the distance were\r\nrushes, stuck up in sheaves to dry, and glimmering with the faint,\r\nwhitish, pinky-grey of far-away fruit trees in blossom.\r\n\r\nWhile, as if the eye had not enough to feed on in her own domain, the\r\nsounds, even, of the valley were pictorial--a tinkling of distant\r\nbells, conjuring up herds of goats; the ominous, melancholy roar which\r\ntells that somewhere a waggoner is goading on his oxen; and the distant\r\nbark of dogs that paints a picture of homesteads and sunny porches.\r\n\r\nAs Master Nathaniel jogged leisurely along, his thoughts turned to the\r\nfarmer Gibberty, who many a time must have jogged along this path, in\r\njust such a way, and seen and heard the very same things that he was\r\nseeing and hearing now.\r\n\r\nYes, the farmer Gibberty had once been a real living man, like himself.\r\nAnd so had millions of others, whose names he had never heard. And one\r\nday he himself would be a prisoner, confined between the walls of other\r\npeople\'s memory. And then he would cease even to be that, and become\r\nnothing but a few words cut in stone. What would these words be, he\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nA sudden longing seized him to hold Ranulph again in his arms. How\r\npleasant would have been the thought that he was waiting to receive him\r\nat the farm!\r\n\r\nBut he must be nearing his journey\'s end, for in the distance he could\r\ndiscern the figure of a woman, leisurely scrubbing her washing on one\r\nof the sides of a stone trough.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if that\'s the widow," thought Master Nathaniel. And a slight\r\nshiver went down his spine.\r\n\r\nBut as he came nearer the washerwoman proved to be quite a young girl.\r\n\r\nHe decided she must be the granddaughter, Hazel; and so she was.\r\n\r\nHe drew up his horse beside her and asked if this were the widow\r\nGibberty\'s farm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," she answered shortly, with that half-frightened,\r\nhalf-defiant look that was so characteristic of her.\r\n\r\n"Why, then, I\'ve not been misdirected. But though they told me I\'d find\r\na thriving farm and a fine herd of cows, the fools forgot to mention\r\nthat the farmer was a rose in petticoats," and he winked jovially.\r\n\r\nNow this was not Master Nathaniel\'s ordinary manner with young ladies,\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, was remarkably free from flirtatious\r\nfacetiousness. But he had invented a role to play at the farm, and was\r\nalready beginning to identify himself with it.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, this opening compliment was a stroke of luck. For\r\nHazel bitterly resented that she was not recognized as the lawful owner\r\nof the farm, and Master Nathaniel\'s greeting of her as the farmer\r\nthawed her coldness into dimples.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve come to see over the farm, I\'m sure we\'ll be very pleased to\r\nshow you everything," she said graciously.\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee, thank\'ee kindly. I\'m a cheesemonger from Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\nAnd there\'s no going to sleep quietly behind one\'s counter these\r\ndays in trade, if one\'s to keep one\'s head above the water. It\'s\r\ncompetition, missy, competition that keeps old fellows like me awake.\r\nWhy, I can remember when there weren\'t more than six cheesemongers in\r\nthe whole of Lud; and now there are as many in my street alone. So I\r\nthought I\'d come myself and have a look round and see where I could get\r\nthe best dairy produce. There\'s nothing like seeing for oneself."\r\n\r\nAnd here he launched into an elaborate and gratuitous account of all\r\nthe other farms he had visited on his tour of inspection. But the one\r\nthat had pleased him best, he said, had been that of a very old friend\r\nof his--and he named the farmer near Moongrass with whom, presumably,\r\nRanulph and Luke were now staying.\r\n\r\nHere Hazel looked up eagerly, and, in rather an unsteady voice, asked\r\nif he\'d seen two lads there--a big one, and a little one who was the\r\nson of the Seneschal.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean little Master Ranulph Chanticleer and Luke Hempen? Why,\r\nof course I saw them! It was they who told me to come along here ...\r\nand very grateful I am to them, for I have found something well worth\r\nlooking at."\r\n\r\nA look of indescribable relief flitted over Hazel\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh ... oh! I\'m so glad you saw them," she faltered.\r\n\r\n"Aha! My friend Luke has evidently been making good use of his\r\ntime--the young dog!" thought Master Nathaniel; and he proceeded to\r\nretail a great many imaginary sayings and doings of Luke at his new\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nHazel was soon quite at home with the jovial, facetious old\r\ncheesemonger. She always preferred elderly men to young ones, and was\r\nsoon chatting away with the abandon sometimes observable when naturally\r\nconfiding people, whom circumstances have made suspicious, find someone\r\nwhom they think they can trust; and Master Nathaniel was, of course,\r\ndrinking in every word and longing to be in her shoes.\r\n\r\n"But, missy, it seems all work and no play!" he cried at last. "Do you\r\nget no frolics and junketings?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes we dance of an evening, when old Portunus is here," she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"Portunus?" he cried sharply, "Who\'s he?"\r\n\r\nBut this question froze her back into reserve. "An old weaver with a\r\nfiddle," she answered stiffly.\r\n\r\n"A bit doited?"\r\n\r\nHer only answer was to look at him suspiciously and say, "Do you know\r\nPortunus, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe I met him--about half-way between here and Lud. The\r\nold fellow seemed to have something on his mind, but couldn\'t get it\r\nout--I\'ve known many a parrot that talked better than he."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve often thought that, too! That he\'d something on his mind, I\r\nmean," cried Hazel on another wave of confidence. "It\'s as if he were\r\ntrying hard to tell one something. And he often follows me as if he\r\nwanted me to do something for him. And I sometimes think I should try\r\nand help him and not be so harsh with him--but he just gives me the\r\ncreeps, and I can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"He gives you the creeps, does he?"\r\n\r\n"That he does!" she cried with a little shiver. "To see him gorging\r\nhimself with green fruit! It isn\'t like a human being the way he does\r\nit--it\'s like an insect or a bird. And he\'s like a cat, too, in the way\r\nhe always follows about the folk that don\'t like him. Oh, he\'s nasty!\r\nAnd he\'s spiteful, too, and mischievous. But perhaps that\'s not to be\r\nwondered at, if ..." and she broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel gave her a keen look. "If what?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--just silly talk of the country people," said Hazel evasively.\r\n\r\n"That he\'s--er, for instance, one of what you call the Silent People?"\r\n\r\n"How did you know?" And Hazel looked at him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guessed. You see, I\'ve heard a lot of that sort of talk since\r\nI\'ve been in the west. Well, the old fellow certainly seemed to have\r\nsomething he wanted to tell me, but I can\'t say he was very explicit.\r\nHe kept saying, over and over again, \'Dig, dig.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s his great word," cried Hazel. "The old women round about\r\nsay that he\'s trying to tell one his name. You see, they think that ...\r\nwell, that he\'s a dead man come back and that when he was on earth he\r\nwas a labourer, by name Diggory Carp."\r\n\r\n"Diggory Carp?" cried Master Nathaniel sharply.\r\n\r\nHazel looked at him in surprise. "Did you know him, sir?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No, no; not exactly. But I seem to have heard the name somewhere.\r\nThough I dare say in these parts it\'s a common enough one. Well, and\r\nwhat do they say about this Diggory Carp?"\r\n\r\nHazel looked a little uneasy. "They don\'t say much, sir--to me. I\r\nsometimes think there must have been some mystery about him. But I know\r\nthat he was a merry, kind sort of man, well liked all round, and a rare\r\nfiddler. But he came to a sad end, though I never heard what happened\r\nexactly. And they say," and here she lowered her voice mysteriously,\r\n"that once a man joins the Silent People he becomes mischievous and\r\nspiteful, however good-natured he may have been when he was alive. And\r\nif he\'d been unfairly treated, as they say he was, it would make him\r\nall the more spiteful, I should think. I often think he\'s got something\r\nhe wants to tell us, and I sometimes wonder if it\'s got anything to\r\ndo with the old stone herm in our orchard ... he\'s so fond of dancing\r\nround it."\r\n\r\n"Really? And where is this old herm? I want to see all the sights of\r\nthe country, you know; get my money\'s worth of travel!" And Master\r\nNathaniel donned again the character of the cheerful cheesemonger,\r\nwhich, in the excitement of the last few minutes, he had, unwittingly,\r\nsloughed.\r\n\r\nAs they walked to the orchard, which was some distance from the washing\r\ntrough, Hazel said, nervously:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you hadn\'t heard, sir, but I live here with my granny; at\r\nleast, she isn\'t my real granny, though I call her so. And ... and ...\r\nwell, she seems fond of old Portunus, and perhaps it would be as well\r\nnot to mention to her that you had met him."\r\n\r\n"Very well; I won\'t mention him to her ... at present." And he gave her\r\nrather a grim little smile.\r\n\r\nThough the orchard had been stripped of its fruit, what with the red\r\nand yellow leaves, and the marvelous ruby-red of the lateral branches\r\nof the peach trees there was colour enough in the background of the old\r\ngrey herm, and, in addition, there twisted around him the scarlet and\r\ngold of a vine.\r\n\r\n"I often think he\'s the spirit of the farm," said Hazel shyly, looking\r\nto see if Master Nathaniel was admiring her old stone friend. To her\r\namazement, however, as soon as his eyes fell on it he clapped his hand\r\nagainst his thigh, and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon and Stars!" he cried, "here\'s the answer to\r\nPortunus\'s riddle: \'the tree yet not a tree, the man yet not a man,\'"\r\nand he repeated to Hazel the one consecutive sentence that Portunus had\r\nmanaged to enunciate.\r\n\r\n"\'Who has no arms and yet can strike, who is dumb and yet can tell\r\nsecrets,\'" she repeated after him. "Can you strike and tell secrets,\r\nold friend?" she asked whimsically, stroking the grey lichened stone.\r\nAnd then she blushed and laughed as if to apologize for this exhibition\r\nof childishness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith country hospitality Hazel presumed that their uninvited guest had\r\ncome to spend several days at the farm, and accordingly she had his\r\nhorse taken to the stables and ordered the best room to be prepared for\r\nhis use.\r\n\r\nThe widow, too, gave him a hearty welcome, when he came down to the\r\nmidday meal in the big kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen they had been a few minutes at table, Hazel said, "Oh, granny,\r\nthis gentleman has just come from the farm near Moongrass, where little\r\nMaster Chanticleer and young Hempen have gone. And he says they were\r\nboth of them blooming, and sent us kind messages."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Master Nathaniel cheerfully, ever ready to start romancing,\r\n"my old friend the farmer is delighted with them. The talk in Lud\r\nwas that little Chanticleer had been ill, but all I can say is, you\r\nmust have done wonders for him--his face is as round and plump as a\r\nMoongrass cheese."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m glad you\'re pleased with the young gentleman\'s looks, sir,"\r\nsaid the widow in a gratified voice. But in her eyes there was the\r\ngleam of a rather disquieting smile.\r\n\r\nDinner over, the widow and Hazel had to go and attend to their various\r\noccupations, and Master Nathaniel went and paced up and down in front\r\nof the old house, thinking. Over and over again his thoughts returned\r\nto the odd old man, Portunus.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that he had really once been Diggory Carp, and that he\r\nhad returned to his old haunts to try and give a message?\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Master Nathaniel that the metaphysical\r\npossibilities of the situation occupied him before the practical ones.\r\nIf Portunus were, indeed, Diggory Carp, then these stubble-fields\r\nand vineyards, these red and golden trees, would be robbed of their\r\npeace and stability. For he realized at last that the spiritual balm\r\nhe had always found in silent things was simply the assurance that\r\nthe passions and agonies of man were without meaning, roots, or\r\nduration--no more part of the permanent background of the world than\r\nthe curls of blue smoke that from time to time were wafted through the\r\nvalley from the autumn bonfires of weeds and rubbish, and that he could\r\nsee winding like blue wraiths in and out of the foliage of the trees.\r\n\r\nYes, their message, though he had never till now heard it distinctly,\r\nhad always been that Fairyland was nothing but delusion--there was\r\nlife and death, and that was all. And yet, had their message always\r\ncomforted him? There had been times when he had shuddered in the\r\ncompany of the silent things.\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye," he murmured dreamily to himself, and then he sighed.\r\n\r\nBut he had yielded long enough to vain speculations--there were things\r\nto be done. Whether Portunus were the ghost of Diggory Carp or merely\r\na doited old weaver, he evidently knew something that he wanted to\r\ncommunicate--and it was connected with the orchard herm. Of course, it\r\nmight have nothing whatever to do with the murder of the late farmer\r\nGibberty, but with the memory of the embroidered slipper fresh in\r\nhis mind, Master Nathaniel felt it would be rank folly to neglect a\r\npossible clue.\r\n\r\nHe went over in his mind all the old man\'s words. "Dig, dig," ... that\r\nword had been the ever recurring burden.\r\n\r\nThen he had a sudden flash of inspiration--why should not the word\r\nbe taken in its primary meaning? Why, instead of the first syllable\r\nof Diggory Carp, should it not be merely and order to dig ... with a\r\nspade or a shovel? In that case it was clear that the place to dig in\r\nwas under the herm. And he decided that he would do so as soon as an\r\nopportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n              THE NORTHERN FIRE-BOX AND DEAD MEN\'S TALES\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Hazel could not get to sleep. Perhaps this was due to having\r\nnoticed something that afternoon that made her vaguely uneasy. The\r\nevenings were beginning to be chilly, and, shortly before supper, she\r\nhad gone up to Master Nathaniel\'s room to light his fire. She found\r\nthe widow and one of the maidservants there before her, and, to her\r\nsurprise, they had brought down from the attic an old charcoal stove\r\nthat had lain there unused for years, for Dorimare was a land of open\r\nfires, and stoves were practically unknown. The widow had brought the\r\nstove to the farm on her marriage, for, on her mother\'s side, she had\r\nbelonged to a race from the far North.\r\n\r\nOn Hazel\'s look of surprise, she had said casually, "The logs are\r\ndampish today, and I thought this would make our guest cozier."\r\n\r\nNow Hazel knew that the wood was not in the least damp; how could it\r\nbe, as it had not rained for days? But that this should have made her\r\nuneasy was a sign of her deep instinctive distrust of her grandfather\'s\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest instinct in Hazel was that of hospitality--that\r\nall should be well, physically and morally, with the guests under\r\nthe roof that she never forgot was hers, was a need in her much more\r\npressing than any welfare of her own.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Master Nathaniel, somewhat puzzled by the outlandish\r\napparatus that was warming his room, had got into bed. He did not\r\nimmediately put out his candle; he wished to think. For being much\r\ngiven to reverie, when he wanted to follow the sterner path of\r\nconsecutive thought, he liked to have some tangible object on which\r\nto focus his eye, a visible goal, as it were, to keep his feet from\r\nstraying down the shadowy paths that he so much preferred.\r\n\r\nTonight it was the fine embossed ceiling on which he fixed his eye--the\r\nsame ceiling at which Ranulph used to gaze when he had slept in\r\nthis room. On a ground of a rich claret colour patterned with azure\r\narabesques, knobs of a dull gold were embossed, and at the four corners\r\nclustered bunches of grapes and scarlet berries in stucco. And though\r\ntime had dulled their colour and robbed the clusters of many of their\r\nberries, they remained, nevertheless, pretty and realistic objects.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of the light, the focus, and his desire for hard\r\nthinking, Master Nathaniel found his thoughts drifting down the most\r\nfantastic paths. And, besides, he was so drowsy and his limbs felt so\r\nstrangely heavy. The colours on the ceiling were getting all blurred,\r\nand the old knobs were detaching themselves from their background\r\nand shining in space like suns, moons, and stars--or was it like\r\napples--the golden apples of the West? And now the claret-coloured\r\nbackground was turning into a red field--a field of red flowers, from\r\nwhich leered Portunus, and among which wept Ranulph. But the straight\r\nroad, which for the last few months had been the projection of his\r\nunknown, buried purpose, even through this confused landscape glimmered\r\nwhite ... yet, it looked different from usual ... why, of course, it\r\nwas the Milky Way! And then he knew no more.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Hazel had been growing more and more restless, and,\r\nthough she scolded herself for foolishness, more and more anxious.\r\nFinally, she could stand it no more: "I think I\'ll just creep up to the\r\ngentleman\'s door and listen if I can hear him snoring," she said to\r\nherself. Hazel believed that it was a masculine peculiarity not to be\r\nable to sleep without snoring.\r\n\r\nBut though she kept her ear to the keyhole for a full two minutes, not\r\na sound proceeded from Master Nathaniel\'s room. Then she softly opened\r\nthe door. A lighted candle was guttering to its end, and her guest\r\nwas lying, to all appearance, dead, whilst a suffocating atmosphere\r\npervaded the room. Hazel felt almost sick with terror, but she flung\r\nopen the casement window as wide as it would go, poured half the water\r\nfrom the ewer into the stove to extinguish its fire, and the remainder\r\nover Master Nathaniel himself. To her unspeakable relief he opened his\r\neyes, groaned, and muttered something inaudible.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, you\'re not dead then!" almost sobbed Hazel. "I\'ll just go and\r\nfetch you a cup of cordial and get you some hartshorn."\r\n\r\nWhen she returned with the two restoratives, she found Master Nathaniel\r\nsitting up in bed, and, though he looked a little fuddled, his natural\r\ncolour was creeping back, and the cordial restored him to almost his\r\nnormal condition.\r\n\r\nWhen Hazel saw that he was really himself again, she sank down on the\r\nfloor and, spent with terror, began to sob bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Come, my child!" said Master Nathaniel kindly, "there\'s nothing to\r\ncry about. I\'m feeling as well as ever I did in my life ... though, by\r\nthe Harvest of Souls, I can\'t imagine what can have taken me. I never\r\nremember to have swooned before in all my born days."\r\n\r\nBut Hazel would not be comforted: "That it should have happened, here,\r\nin my house," she sobbed. "We who have always stood by the laws of\r\nhospitality ... and not a young gentleman, either ... oh, dearie me;\r\noh, dearie me!"\r\n\r\n"What do you blame to yourself, my child?" asked Master Nathaniel.\r\n"Your hospitality is in no sense to blame if, owing perhaps to recent\r\nfatigues and anxieties, I should have turned faint. No, it is not you\r\nthat are the bad host, but I that am the bad guest to have given so\r\nmuch trouble."\r\n\r\nBut Hazel\'s sobs only grew wilder. "I didn\'t like her bringing in that\r\nfire-box--no I didn\'t! An evil outlandish thing that it is! That it\r\nshould have happened under my roof! For it is my roof ... and she\'ll\r\nnot pass another night under it!" and she sprang to her feet, with\r\nclenched fists and blazing eyes.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel was becoming interested. "Are you alluding to your\r\ngrandfather\'s widow?" he asked quietly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am!" cried Hazel indignantly. "Oh! she\'s up to strange tricks,\r\nalways ... and none of her ways are those of honest farmers--no fennel\r\nover our doors, unholy fodder in our granary ... and in her heart,\r\nthoughts as unholy. I saw the smile with which she looked at you at\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"Are you accusing this woman of actually having made an attempt on my\r\nlife?" he asked slowly.\r\n\r\nBut Hazel flinched before this point-blank question, and her only\r\nanswer was to begin again to cry. For a few minutes Master Nathaniel\r\nallowed her to do so unmolested, and then he said gently, "I think you\r\nhave cried enough for tonight, my child. You have been kindness itself,\r\nbut it is evident that I am not very welcome to your grandfather\'s\r\nwidow, so I must not inflict myself longer upon her. But before I leave\r\nher roof there is something I want to do, and I shall need your help."\r\n\r\nThen he told her who he was and how he wanted to prove something\r\nagainst a certain enemy of his, and had come here hoping to find a\r\nmissing clue.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked at her meditatively. "I think I ought to tell\r\nyou, my child," he went on, "that if I can prove what I want, your\r\ngrandmother may also be involved. Did you know she had once been tried\r\nfor the murder of your grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she faltered. "I\'ve heard that there was a trial. But I thought\r\nshe was proved innocent."\r\n\r\n"Yes. But there is such a thing as a miscarriage of justice. I believe\r\nthat your grandfather was murdered, and that my enemy--whose name\r\nI don\'t care to mention till I have more to go upon--had a hand in\r\nthe matter. And I have a shrewd suspicion that the widow was his\r\naccomplice. Under these circumstances, will you still be willing to\r\nhelp me?"\r\n\r\nHazel first turned red, and then she turned white, and her lower lip\r\nbegan to tremble. She disliked the widow, but had to admit that she had\r\nnever been unkindly treated by her, and, though not her own kith and\r\nkin, she was the nearest approach to a relative she could remember.\r\nBut, on the other hand, Hazel belonged by tradition and breed to the\r\nvotaries of the grim cult of the Law. Crime must not go unpunished;\r\nmoreover (and here Hazel subscribed to a still more venerable code)\r\none\'s own kith and kin must not go unavenged.\r\n\r\nBut the very vehemence with which she longed to be rid of the widow\'s\r\ncontrol had bred a curious irrational sense of guilt with regard to\r\nher; and, into the bargain, she was terrified of her.\r\n\r\nSupposing this clue should lead to nothing, and the widow discover that\r\nthey had been imagining? How, in that case, should she dare to face\r\nher, to go on living under the same roof with her?\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... she was certain she had tried to murder their guest that\r\nnight. How dared she? How dared she?\r\n\r\nHazel clenched her fists, and in a little gasping voice said, "Yes,\r\nsir, I\'ll help you."\r\n\r\n"Good!" said Master Nathaniel briskly. "I want to take old Portunus\'s\r\nadvice--and dig under that herm in the orchard, this very night.\r\nThough, mind you, it\'s just as likely as not to prove nothing but the\r\nravings of a crazy mind; or else it may concern some buried treasure,\r\nor something else that has nothing to do with your grandfather\'s\r\nmurder. But, in the case of our finding a valuable bit of evidence,\r\nwe must have witnesses. And I think we should have the law-man of the\r\ndistrict with us; who is he?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Swan blacksmith, Peter Pease."\r\n\r\n"Is there any servant you trust whom you could send for him? Someone\r\nmore attached to you than to the widow?"\r\n\r\n"I can trust them all, and they all like me best," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Good. Go and wake a servant and send him off at once for the\r\nblacksmith. Tell him not to bring him up to the house, but to take him\r\nstraight to the orchard ... we don\'t want to wake the widow before\r\nneed be. And the servant can stay and help us with the job--the more\r\nwitnesses the better."\r\n\r\nHazel felt as if she was in a strange, rather terrible dream. But she\r\ncrept up to the attic and aroused one of the unmarried labourers--who,\r\naccording to the old custom, slept in their master\'s house--and bade\r\nhim ride into Swan and bring the blacksmith back with him on important\r\nbusiness concerning the law.\r\n\r\nHazel calculated that he should get to Swan and back in less than an\r\nhour, and she and Master Nathaniel crept out of the house to wait for\r\nthem in the orchard, each provided with a spade.\r\n\r\nThe moon was on the wane, but still sufficiently full to give a good\r\nlight. She was, indeed, an orchard thief, for no fruit being left to\r\nrob, she had robbed the leaves of all their colour.\r\n\r\n"Poor old moon!" chuckled Master Nathaniel, who was now in the highest\r\nof spirits, "always filching colours with which to paint her own pale\r\nface, and all in vain! But just look at your friend, at Master Herm. He\r\ndoes look knowing!"\r\n\r\nFor in the moonlight the old herm had found his element, and under her\r\nrays his stone flickered and glimmered into living silver flesh, while\r\nhis archaic smile had gained a new significance.\r\n\r\n"Excuse, me, sir," said Hazel timidly, "but I couldn\'t help wondering\r\nif the gentleman you suspected was ... Dr. Leer."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think so?" asked Master Nathaniel sharply.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite know," faltered Hazel. "I just--wondered."\r\n\r\nBefore long they were joined by the labourer and the law-man\r\nblacksmith--a burly, jovial, red-haired rustic of about fifty.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," cried Master Nathaniel briskly, "I am Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer" (he was sure that the news of his deposition could not\r\nyet have had time to travel to Swan) "and if my business were not\r\nvery pressing and secret I would not, you may be sure, have had you\r\nroused from your bed at this ungodly hour. I have reason to think\r\nthat something of great importance may be hidden under this herm,\r\nand I wanted you to be there to see that our proceedings are all in\r\norder," and he laughed genially. "And here\'s the guarantee that I\'m no\r\nmasquerader," and he removed his signet ring and held it out to the\r\nblacksmith. It was engraved with his well-known crest, and with six\r\nchevrons, in token that six of his ancestors had been High Seneschals\r\nof Dorimare.\r\n\r\nBoth the blacksmith and the labourer were at first quite overwhelmed by\r\nlearning his identity, but he pressed a spade into the hand of each and\r\nbegged them to begin digging without further delay.\r\n\r\nFor some time they toiled away in silence, and then one of the spades\r\ncame against something hard.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a small iron box with a key attached to it.\r\n\r\n"Out with it! out with it!" cried Master Nathaniel excitedly. "I wonder\r\nif it contains a halter! By the Sun, Moon and Stars, I wonder!"\r\n\r\nBut he was sobered by a glimpse of poor Hazel\'s scared face.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, my child," he said gently, "my thirst for revenge has made\r\nme forget both decency and manners. And, as like as not, there will be\r\nnothing in it but a handful of Duke Aubrey crowns--the nest-egg of one\r\nof your ancestors."\r\n\r\nThey unlocked the box and found that it contained nothing but a sealed\r\nparchment package, addressed thus:\r\n\r\n                     "To the First Who Finds Me."\r\n\r\n"I think, Miss Hazel, it should be you who opens it. Don\'t you agree,\r\nMaster Law-man?" said Master Nathaniel. So, with trembling fingers,\r\nHazel broke the seal, tore open the wrapper, and drew out a sheet of\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the blacksmith\'s lanthorn they read as follows:\r\n\r\n    I, Jeremiah Gibberty, farmer and law-man of the district of\r\n    Swan-on-the-Dapple, having ever been a merry man who loved his\r\n    joke, do herein crack my last, this side of the Debatable Hills,\r\n    in the hopes that it will not lie so long in the damp earth as to\r\n    prove but a lame rocket when the time comes to fire it off. And\r\n    this is my last joke, and may all who hear it hold their sides,\r\n    and may the tears run down their cheeks. I, Jeremiah Gibberty,\r\n    was wilfully murdered by my second wife, Clementina, daughter of\r\n    Ralph Baldbreeches, sailor, and an outlandish woman from the far\r\n    North. In the which crime she was aided by her lover, Christopher\r\n    Pugwalker, a foreigner who called himself an herbalist. And I know\r\n    by sundry itchings of my skin which torment me as I write and by my\r\n    spotted tongue that I have been given what the folks who know them\r\n    call death-berries. And they were boiled down to look like mulberry\r\n    jelly, offered to me by my dear wife, and of which I ate in my\r\n    innocence. And I bid him who finds this writing to search for a\r\n    little lad, by name Peter Pease, the son of a tipsy tinker. For\r\n    this little lad, having an empty stomach and being greedy for\r\n    pence, came to me but an hour ago with a basket full of these same\r\n    death-berries and asked me if I should like to buy them. And I, to\r\n    test him, asked him if he thought there was a blight in my orchard\r\n    that I should be so hard put to it for fruit. And he said he\r\n    thought we must like them up at Gibberty\'s for he had seen the\r\n    gentleman who lived with us (Christopher Pugwalker) but a week\r\n    since, gathering them. And if Christopher Pugwalker should leave\r\n    these parts, then let the law search for a dumpy fellow, with\r\n    nut-brown hair, a pug-nose freckled like a robin\'s egg, and one eye\r\n    brown, the other blue. And in order that my last joke may be a\r\n    well-built one, I have tested the berries I bought from the little\r\n    lad, though it wrung my heart to do so, on one of the rabbits of a\r\n    certain little maid, by name, Marjory Beach, the daughter of my\r\n    carter. And I have done so because she, being seven years old and a\r\n    healthy lass, runs a good chance of being still this side of the\r\n    hills when someone digs up this buried jest. And if she be alive\r\n    she will not have forgotten how one of her rabbits took to\r\n    scratching itself, and how its tongue was spotted like a snake, and\r\n    how she found it lying dead. And I humbly beg her pardon for having\r\n    played such a cruel trick on a little maid, and I ask my heirs (if\r\n    so be any of them still alive) to send her a fine buck rabbit, a\r\n    ham, and ten gold pieces. And, though I am law-man and could put\r\n    them under arrest before I die, yet, for a time, I hold my hand.\r\n    Partly because I have been a hunter all my life, and as the hare\r\n    and deer are given their chance to escape, so shall they have\r\n    theirs; and partly because I should like to be very far on my\r\n    wanderings down the Milky Way before Clementina mounts Duke\r\n    Aubrey\'s wooden horse; because I think the sound of her strangling\r\n    would hurt my ears; and, last of all, because I am very weary. And\r\n    here I sign my name for the last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                            BELLING THE CAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished reading, Hazel burst into hysterical sobs,\r\ncrying alternately, "Poor grandfather!" and "Will they hang her for\r\nit?" Master Nathaniel soothed her as best he could, and, when she had\r\ndried her eyes, she said, "Poor Marjory Beach! She must have that ham\r\nand that buck rabbit."\r\n\r\n"She\'s still alive, then?" asked Master Nathaniel eagerly. Hazel\r\nnodded: "She is poor, and still a maid, and lives in Swan."\r\n\r\n"And what about Peter Pease, the tinker\'s smart little lad? Is there\r\nnothing for him, Miss Hazel?" cried the blacksmith with a twinkle.\r\n\r\nHazel stared at him in bewilderment, and Master Nathaniel cried\r\ngleefully, "Why, it\'s the same name, by the Harvest of Souls! Were you,\r\nthen, the little chap who saw Pugwalker picking the berries?"\r\n\r\nAnd Hazel said in slow amazement, "You were the little boy who spoke to\r\nmy grandfather ... that night? I never thought...."\r\n\r\n"That I\'d begun so humbly, eh? Yes, I was the son of a tinker, or, as\r\nthey liked to be called, of a whitesmith. And now I\'m a blacksmith, and\r\nas white is better than black I suppose I\'ve come down in the world."\r\nAnd he winked merrily.\r\n\r\n"And you remember the circumstances alluded to by the late farmer?"\r\nasked Master Nathaniel eagerly.\r\n\r\n"That I do, my lord Seneschal. As well if they had happened yesterday.\r\nI won\'t easily forget the farmer\'s face that night when I offered him\r\nmy basketful--but though the death-berries are rare enough I found them\r\nin those days commoner to pick up than ha\'pence. And I won\'t easily\r\nforget Master Pugwalker\'s face, either, while he was plucking them.\r\nAnd little did he know there was a squirrel watching him with a good\r\nDorimare tongue in his head!"\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen him since?"\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith winked.\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" cried Master Nathaniel impatiently. "Have you seen him\r\nsince? This is no time for beating about the bush."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps I have," said the blacksmith slowly, "trotting about\r\nSwan, as brisk and as pleased with himself as a fox with a goose in his\r\nmouth. And I\'ve often wondered whether it wasn\'t my duty as law-man to\r\nspeak out ... but, after all, it was very long ago, and his life seemed\r\nto be of better value than his death, for he was a wonderfully clever\r\ndoctor and did a powerful lot of good."\r\n\r\n"It--it was Dr. Leer, then?" asked Hazel in a low voice; and the\r\nblacksmith winked.\r\n\r\n"Well, I think we should be getting back to the house," said Master\r\nNathaniel, "there\'s still some business before us." And, lowering his\r\nvoice, he added, "Not very pleasant business, I fear."\r\n\r\n"I suppose your Honour means belling the cat?" said the blacksmith,\r\nadding with a rueful laugh, "I can\'t imagine a nastier job. She\'s a cat\r\nwith claws."\r\n\r\nAs they walked up to the house, the labourer whispered to Hazel,\r\n"Please, missy, does it mean that the mistress killed her husband? They\r\nalways say so in the village, but...."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Ben; don\'t! I can\'t bear talking about it," cried Hazel with a\r\nshudder. And when they reached the house, she ran up to her own bedroom\r\nand locked herself in.\r\n\r\nBen was despatched to get a stout coil of rope, and Master Nathaniel\r\nand the blacksmith, whom the recent excitement had made hungry, began\r\nto forage around for something to eat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice at the door said, "And what, may I ask, are you\r\nlooking for in my larder, gentlemen?"\r\n\r\nIt was the widow. First she scrutinized Master Nathaniel--a little pale\r\nand hollow-eyed, perhaps, but alive and kicking, for all that. Then\r\nher eyes travelled to Peter Pease. At that moment, Ben entered with\r\nthe rope, and Master Nathaniel nudged the law-man, who, clearing his\r\nthroat, cried in the expressionless falsetto of the Law, "Clementina\r\nGibberty! In the name of the country of Dorimare, and to the end that\r\nthe dead, the living, and those not yet born, may rest quietly in their\r\ngraves, their bed, and the womb, I arrest you for the murder of your\r\nlate husband, Jeremiah Gibberty."\r\n\r\nShe turned deadly pale, and, for a few seconds, stood glaring at him in\r\ndeadly silence. Then she gave a scornful laugh. "What new joke of yours\r\nis this, Peter Pease? I was accused of this before, as you know well,\r\nand acquitted with the judge\'s compliments, and as good as an apology.\r\nLaw business must be very slack in Swan that you\'ve nothing better to\r\ndo than to come and frighten a poor woman in her own house with old\r\nspiteful tales that were silenced once and for all nearly forty years\r\nago. My late husband died quietly in his bed, and I only hope you may\r\nhave as peaceful an end. And you must know very little of the law,\r\nPeter Pease, if you don\'t know that a person can\'t be tried twice for\r\nthe same crime."\r\n\r\nThen Master Nathaniel stepped forward. "You were tried before," he said\r\nquietly, "for poisoning your husband with the sap of osiers. This\r\ntime it will be for poisoning him with the berries of merciful death.\r\nTonight the dead have found their tongues."\r\n\r\nShe gave a wild shriek, which reached upstairs to Hazel\'s room and\r\ncaused her to spring into bed and pull the blankets over her ears, as\r\nif it had been a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel signed to Ben, who, grinning from ear to ear, as is\r\nthe way of rustics when witnessing a painful and embarrassing scene,\r\ncame up to his mistress with the coil of rope. But to bind her, he\r\nneeded the aid of both the blacksmith and Master Nathaniel, for, like a\r\nveritable wild cat, she struggled and scratched and bit.\r\n\r\nWhen her arms were tightly bound, Master Nathaniel said, "And now I\r\nwill read you the words of the dead."\r\n\r\nShe was, for the time, worn out by her struggles, and her only answer\r\nwas an insolent stare, and he produced the farmer\'s document and read\r\nit through to her.\r\n\r\n"And now," he said, eyeing her curiously, "shall I tell you who gave me\r\nthe clue without which I should never have found that letter? It was a\r\ncertain old man, whom I think you know, by name Portunus."\r\n\r\nHer face turned as pale as death, and in a low voice of horror she\r\ncried, "Long ago I guessed who he was, and feared that he might prove\r\nmy undoing." Then her voice grew shrill with terror and her eyes\r\nbecame fixed, as if seeing some hideous vision, "The Silent People!"\r\nshe screamed. "The dumb who speak! The bound who strike! I cherished\r\nand fed old Portunus like a tame bird. But what do the dead know of\r\nkindness?"\r\n\r\n"If old Portunus is he whom you take him to be, I fail to see that he\r\nhas much cause for gratitude," said Master Nathaniel drily. "Well, he\r\nhas taken his revenge, on you--and your accomplice."\r\n\r\n"My accomplice?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, on Endymion Leer."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Leer!" And she laughed scornfully. "It was a greater than Endymion\r\nLeer who ordered the death of farmer Gibberty."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. One who cares not for good and evil, and sows his commands like\r\ngrain."\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\nAgain she laughed scornfully. "Not one whom I would name to you. But\r\nset your mind at rest, he cannot be summoned in a court of law."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a searching look, and said abruptly, "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Nathaniel Chanticleer."\r\n\r\n"I thought as much!" she cried triumphantly. "I wasn\'t sure, but I\r\nthought I\'d take no risks. However, you seem to bear a charmed life."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are alluding to your kind thought for my\r\ncomfort--putting that nice little death-box in my room to keep me warm,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it," she answered brazenly.\r\n\r\nThen a look of indescribable malice came into her face, and, with an\r\nevil smile, she said, "You see, you gave yourself away--without knowing\r\nit--at dinner."\r\n\r\n"Indeed? And how, may I ask?"\r\n\r\nAt first she did not answer, but eyed him gloatingly as a cat might\r\neye a mouse. And then she said slowly, "It was that pack of lies you\r\ntold me about the doings of the lads at Moongrass. Your son isn\'t at\r\nMoongrass--nor ever has been, nor ever will be."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he cried hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"Mean?" she said with a shrill, triumphant laugh. "I mean this--on\r\nthe night of the thirty-first of October, when the Silent People are\r\nabroad, he heard Duke Aubrey\'s summons, and followed it across the\r\nhills."\r\n\r\n"Woman ... what ... what ... speak ... or ..." and the veins in Master\r\nNathaniel\'s temples were swelling, and a fire seemed to have been\r\nlighted in his brain.\r\n\r\nHer laughter redoubled. "You\'ll never see your son again!" she jeered.\r\n"Young Ranulph Chanticleer has gone to the land whence none returns."\r\n\r\nNot for a moment did he doubt the truth of her words. Before his\r\ninward eye there flashed the picture he had seen in the pattern on the\r\nceiling, just before losing consciousness--Ranulph weeping among the\r\nfields of gillyflowers.\r\n\r\nA horror of impotent tenderness swept over him. While, with the surface\r\nof his mind, he supposed that this was IT springing out at him at last.\r\nAnd parallel with the agony, and in no way mitigating it, was a sense\r\nof relief--the relaxing of tension, when one can say, "Well, it has\r\ncome at last."\r\n\r\nHe turned a dull eye on the widow, and said, a little thickly, "The\r\nland from which no one returns ... but I can go there, too."\r\n\r\n"Follow him across the hills?" she cried scornfully. "No; you are not\r\nmade of that sort of stuff."\r\n\r\nHe beckoned to Peter Pease, and they went out together to the front of\r\nthe house. The cocks were crowing, and there was a feeling of dawn in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n"I want my horse," he said dully. "And can you find Miss Hazel for me?"\r\n\r\nBut as he spoke she joined them--pale and wild-eyed.\r\n\r\n"From my room I heard you coming out," she said. "Is it--is it over?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel nodded. And then, in a quiet voice emptied of all\r\nemotion, he told her what he had just learned from the widow. She went\r\nstill paler than before, and her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Peter Pease, he said, "You will immediately get out a\r\nwarrant for the apprehension of Endymion Leer and send it into Lud to\r\nthe new Mayor, Master Polydore Vigil. And you, Miss Hazel, you\'d better\r\nleave this place at once--you will have to be plaintiff in the trial.\r\nGo to your aunt, Mistress Ivy Peppercorn, who keeps the village shop at\r\nMothgreen. And remember, you must say nothing whatever about the part\r\nI\'ve played in this business--that is essential. I am not popular at\r\npresent in Lud. And, now, would you kindly order my horse saddled and\r\nbrought round."\r\n\r\nThere was something so colourless, so dead, in his voice, that both\r\nHazel and the smith stood, for a few seconds, in awed and sympathetic\r\nsilence, and then Hazel went off slowly to order his horse.\r\n\r\n"You ... you didn\'t mean what you said to the widow, sir, about ...\r\nabout going ... yonder?" asked Peter Pease in an awed voice.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the fire was rekindled in Master Nathaniel\'s eyes, and he\r\ncried fiercely, "Aye, yonder, and beyond yonder, if need be ... till I\r\nfind my son."\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for his horse to be saddled and led to the door.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my child," he said to Hazel, taking her hand, and then he\r\nadded, with a smile, "You dragged me back last night from the Milky\r\nWay ... and now I am going by the earthly one."\r\n\r\nShe and Peter stood watching him, riding along the valley towards\r\nthe Debatable Hills, till he and his horse were just a speck in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Peter Pease, "I warrant it\'ll be the first time in\r\nthe history of Dorimare that a man has loved his son well enough to\r\nfollow him yonder."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                     THE LAW CROUCHES AND SPRINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterally, Master Polydore Vigil received the severest shock of his\r\nlife, when a few days after the events recorded in the last chapter\r\nthere reached him the warrant against Endymion Leer, duly signed and\r\nsealed by the law-man of the district of Swan-on-the-Dapple.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold had been right in saying that her brother was now\r\ncompletely under the dominion of the doctor. Master Polydore was\r\na weak, idle man, who, nevertheless, dearly loved the insignia of\r\nauthority. Hence, his present position was for him an ideal one--he had\r\nall the glory due to the first citizen, who has, moreover, effected a\r\ncoup d\'etat, and none of the real responsibility that such a situation\r\nentails.\r\n\r\nAnd now, this terrible document had arrived--it was like an attempt to\r\ncut off his right hand. His first instinct on receiving it was to rush\r\noff and take counsel with Endymion Leer himself--surely the omniscient\r\nresourceful doctor would be able to reduce to wind and thistledown\r\neven a thing as solid as a warrant. But respect for the Law, and the\r\nbelief that though everything else may turn out vanity and delusion,\r\nthe Law has the terrifying solidity of Reality itself, were deep-rooted\r\nin Master Polydore. If there was a warrant out against Endymion\r\nLeer--well, then, he must bend his neck to the yoke like any other\r\ncitizen and stand his trial.\r\n\r\nAgain he read through the warrant, in the hopes that on a second it\r\nwould lose its reality--prove to be a forgery, or a hoax. Alas! Its\r\ngenuineness was but too unmistakable--the Law had spoken.\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore let his hands fall to his sides in an attitude of limp\r\ndismay; then he sighed heavily; then he rose slowly to his feet--there\r\nwas nothing for it but to summon Mumchance, and let the warrant\r\ninstantly be put into effect. As it was possible, nay, almost certain,\r\nthat the Doctor would be able to clear himself triumphantly in Court,\r\nthe quicker the business was put through, the sooner Master Polydore\r\nwould recover his right hand.\r\n\r\nWhen Mumchance arrived, Master Polydore said, in a voice as casual\r\nas he could make it, "Oh! yes, Mumchance, yes ... I asked you to\r\ncome, because," and he gave a little laugh, "a warrant has actually\r\narrived--of course, there must be some gross misunderstanding behind\r\nit, and there will be no difficulty in getting it cleared up in\r\nCourt--but, as a matter of fact, a warrant has arrived from the law-man\r\nof Swan-on-the-Dapple, against ... well, against none other than Dr.\r\nEndymion Leer!" and again he laughed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, your Worship," said Mumchance; and, not only did his face express\r\nno surprise, but into the bargain it looked distinctly grim.\r\n\r\n"Absurd, isn\'t it?" said Master Polydore, "and most inconvenient."\r\n\r\nMumchance cleared his throat: "A murderer\'s a murderer, your\r\nWorship," he said. "Me and my wife, we were spending last evening\r\nat Mothgreen--my wife\'s cousin keeps the tavern there, and he was\r\ncelebrating his silver wedding--if your Worship will excuse me\r\nmentioning such things--and among the friends he\'d asked in was the\r\nplaintiff and her aunt ... and, well ... there be some things that be\r\njust too big for any defendant to dodge. But I\'ll say no more, your\r\nWorship."\r\n\r\n"I should hope not, Mumchance; you have already strangely forgotten\r\nyourself," and Master Polydore glared fiercely at the unrepentant\r\nMumchance. All the same, he could not help feeling a little disquieted\r\nby the attitude adopted by that worthy.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later after a busy morning devoted to professional\r\nvisits--and, perhaps, some unprofessional ones too--Endymion Leer sat\r\ndown to his midday dinner. There was not a happier man in Lud than\r\nhe--he was the most influential man in the town, deep in the counsels\r\nof the magistrates; and as for the dreaded Chanticleers--well, he\r\nhad successively robbed them of their sting. Life being one and\r\nindivisible, when one has a sense that it is good its humblest\r\nmanifestations are transfigured, and that morning the Doctor would have\r\nfound a meal of baked haws sweet to his palate--how much more so the\r\nsucculent meal that was actually awaiting him. But it was not fated\r\nthat Endymion Leer should eat that dinner. There came a loud double\r\nknock at the door, and then the voice of Captain Mumchance, demanding\r\ninstantly to be shown in to the Doctor. It was in vain that the\r\nhousekeeper protested, saying that the Doctor had given strict orders\r\nthat he was never to be disturbed at his meals, for the Captain roughly\r\nbrushed her aside with an aphorism worthy of that eminent jurist, the\r\nlate Master Josiah Chanticleer. "The Law, my good lady, is no respector\r\nof a gentleman\'s stomach, so I\'ll trouble you to stand out of the way,"\r\nand he stumped resolutely into the parlour.\r\n\r\n"Morning, Mumchance!" cried the Doctor cheerily, "come to share this\r\nexcellent-looking pigeon-pie?"\r\n\r\nFor a second or two the Captain surveyed him rather ghoulishly. It must\r\nbe remembered that not only had the Captain identified himself with the\r\nLaw to such a degree that he looked upon any breach of it as a personal\r\ninsult, but that also he had been deeply wounded in his professional\r\npride in that he had not immediately recognised a murderer by his\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mumchance was not exactly an imaginative man, but as he\r\nstood there contemplating the Doctor he could almost have believed\r\nthat his features and expression had suffered a subtle and most\r\nunbecoming change since he had last seen them. It was as if he was\r\nsitting in a ghastly green light--the most disfiguring and sinister\r\nof all the effects of light with which the Law cunningly plays with\r\nappearances--the light that emanates from the word murder.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," he said gruffly, "I don\'t sit down to table with the\r\nlikes of you."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gave him a very sharp look, and then he raised his eyebrows\r\nand said drily, "It seems to me that recently you have more than once\r\nhonoured my humble board."\r\n\r\nThe Captain snorted, and then in a stentorian and unnatural voice, he\r\nshouted, "Endymion Leer! I arrest you in the name of the country of\r\nDorimare, and to the end that the dead, the living, and those not yet\r\nborn, may rest quietly in their graves, their bed, and the womb."\r\n\r\n"Gammon and spinnage!" cried the Doctor, testily, "what\'s your little\r\ngame, Mumchance?"\r\n\r\n"Is murder, game?" said the Captain; and at that word the Doctor\r\nblanched, and then Mumchance added, "You\'re accused of the murder of\r\nthe late Farmer Gibberty."\r\n\r\nThe words acted like a spell. It was as if Endymion Leer\'s previous\r\nsly, ironical, bird-like personality slipped from him like a mask,\r\nrevealing another soul, at once more formidable and more tragic. For\r\na few seconds he stood white and silent, and then he cried out in a\r\nterrible voice: "Treachery! Treachery! The Silent People have betrayed\r\nme! It is ill serving a perfidious master!"\r\n\r\nThe news of the arrest of Endymion Leer on a charge of murder flew like\r\nwildfire through Lud.\r\n\r\nAt all the street corners, little groups of tradesmen, \'prentices,\r\nsailors, were to be seen engaged in excited conversation, and from one\r\nto the other group flitted the deaf-mute harlot, Bawdy Bess, inciting\r\nthem in her strange uncontrolled speech, while dogging her footsteps\r\nwith her dance-like tread went old Mother Tibbs, alternately laughing\r\nin crazy glee and weeping and wringing her hands and crying out that\r\nshe had not yet brought back the Doctor\'s last washing, and it was a\r\nsad thing that he should go for his last ride in foul linen. "For he\'ll\r\nmount Duke Aubrey\'s wooden horse--the Gentlemen have told me so," she\r\nadded with mysterious nods.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Luke Hempen had reported to Mumchance what he had\r\nlearned from the little herdsmen about the "fish" caught by the widow\r\nand the Doctor. The Yeomanry stationed on the border were instantly\r\nnotified and ordered to drag the Dapple near the spot where it bubbled\r\nout after its subterranean passage through the Debatable Hills. They\r\ndid so, and discovered wicker frails of fairy fruit, so cunningly\r\nweighted that they were able to float under the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThis discovery considerably altered Master Polydore\'s attitude to\r\nEndymion Leer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                        "NEITHER TREES NOR MEN"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the disturbance caused among the populace by the arrest\r\nof Endymion Leer, the Senate deemed it advisable that his trial, and\r\nthat of the widow Gibberty, should take precedence of all other legal\r\nbusiness; so as soon as the two important witnesses, Peter Pease and\r\nMarjory Beach, reached Lud-in-the-Mist, it was fixed for an early date.\r\n\r\nNever, in all the annals of Dorimare, had a trial been looked forward\r\nto with such eager curiosity. It was to begin at nine o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, and by seven o\'clock the hall of justice was already packed,\r\nwhile a seething crowd thronged the courtyard and overflowed into the\r\nHigh Street beyond.\r\n\r\nOn the front seats sat Dame Marigold, Dame Jessamine, Dame Dreamsweet\r\nand the other wives of magistrates; the main body of the hall was\r\noccupied by tradesmen and their wives, and other quiet, well-to-do\r\nmembers of the community, and behind them seethed the noisy, impudent,\r\nhawking, cat-calling riff-raff--\'prentices, sailors, pedlars,\r\nstrumpets; showing clearly on what side were their sympathies by such\r\nribald remarks as, "My old granny\'s pet cockatoo is terrible fond of\r\ncherries, I think we should tell the Town Yeomanry, and have it locked\r\nup as a smuggler," or, "Where\'s Mumchance! Send for Mumchance and the\r\nMayor! Two hundred years ago an old gaffer ate a gallon of crab soup\r\nand died the same night--arrest Dr. Leer and hang him for it."\r\n\r\nBut as the clocks struck nine and Master Polydore Vigil, in his\r\npriestly-looking purple robes of office embroidered in gold with\r\nthe sun and the moon and the stars, and the other ten judges clad\r\nin scarlet and ermine filed slowly in and, bowing gravely to the\r\nassembly, took their seats on the dais, silence descended on the hall;\r\nfor the fear of the Law was inbred in every Dorimarite, even the most\r\ndisreputable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was a low hum of excitement when Mumchance in his\r\ngreen uniform, carrying an axe, and two or three others of the Town\r\nYeomanry, marched in with the two prisoners, who took their places in\r\nthe dock.\r\n\r\nThough Endymion Leer had for long been one of the most familiar figures\r\nin Lud, all eyes were turned on him with as eager a curiosity as if he\r\nhad been some savage from the Amber Desert, the first of his kind to be\r\nseen in Dorimare; and such curious tricks can the limelight of the Law\r\nplay on reality that many there thought that they could see his evil\r\nsinister life writ in clear characters on his familiar features.\r\n\r\nTo the less impressionable of the spectators, however, he looked very\r\nmuch as usual, though perhaps a little pale and flabby about the gills.\r\nAnd he swept the hall with his usual impudent appraising glance, as if\r\nto say, "Linsey-woolsey, linsey-woolsey! But one must make the best of\r\na poor material."\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to give the judges a run for their money!"\r\n\r\n"If he\'s got to die, he\'ll die game!" gleefully whispered various of\r\nhis partisans.\r\n\r\nAs for the widow, her handsome passionate face was deadly pale and\r\nemptied of all expression; this gave her a sort of tragic sinister\r\nbeauty, reminiscent of the faces of the funereal statues in the Fields\r\nof Grammary.\r\n\r\n"Not the sort of woman I\'d like to meet in a lonely lane at night," was\r\nthe general comment she aroused.\r\n\r\nThen the Clerk of Arraigns called out "Silence!" and in a solemn\r\nvoice, Master Polydore said, "Endymion Leer and Clementina Gibberty,\r\nhold up your hands." They did so. Whereupon, Master Polydore read the\r\nindictment, as follows: "Endymion Leer, and Clementina Gibberty, you\r\nare accused of having poisoned the late Jeremiah Gibberty, farmer, and\r\nlaw-man of the district of Swan-on-the-Dapple, thirty-six years ago,\r\nwith a fruit known as the berries of merciful death."\r\n\r\nThen the plaintiff, a fresh-faced young girl (none other, of course,\r\nthan our old friend, Hazel) knelt at the foot of the dais and was given\r\nthe great seal to kiss; upon which the Clerk of Arraigns led her up\r\ninto a sort of carved pulpit, whence in a voice, low, but so clear\r\nas to penetrate to the furthest corners of the hall she told, with\r\nadmirable lucidity, the story of the murder of her grandfather.\r\n\r\nNext, Mistress Ivy, flustered and timid, told the Judges, in somewhat\r\nrambling fashion, what she had already told Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nThen came the testimony of Peter Pease and Marjory Beach, and, finally,\r\nthe document of the late farmer was handed round among the Judges.\r\n\r\n"Endymion Leer!" called out Master Polydore, "the Law bids you speak,\r\nor be silent, as your conscience prompts you."\r\n\r\nAnd as Endymion Leer rose to make his defence, the silence of the hall\r\nseemed to be trebled in intensity.\r\n\r\n"My Lords Judges!" he began, "I take my stand, not high enough,\r\nperhaps, to be out of reach of the gibbet, but well above the heads,\r\nI fancy, of everybody here today. And, first of all, I would have you\r\nbear in mind that my life has been spent in the service of Dorimare."\r\n(Here there was a disturbance at the back of the hall and shouts\r\nof "Down with the Senators!" "Long live the good Doctor!" But the\r\nwould-be rioters were cowed by the thunder of the Law, rumbling in the\r\n"Silence!" of the Clerk of Arraigns.)\r\n\r\n"I have healed and preserved your bodies--I have tried to do the same\r\nfor your souls. First, by writing a book--published anonymously some\r\nyears ago--in which I tried to show the strange seeds that are sleeping\r\nin each of you. But the book hardly aroused the enthusiasm that it\r\nso justly deserved" (and he gave his old dry chuckle). "In fact, not\r\nto put too fine a point on it, the copies were burned by the common\r\nhangman--and could you have found the author you would gladly have\r\nburned him too. I can tell you since writing it I have gone in fear\r\nof my life, and have hardly dared to look a red-haired man in the\r\nface--still less a blue cow!" and here some of his partizans at the\r\nback of the hall laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then went on in a graver voice, "Why have I taken all\r\nthis trouble with you? Why have I spent my erudition and my skill on\r\nyou thus? To speak truth, I hardly know myself ... perhaps because I\r\nlike playing with fire; perhaps because I am relentlessly compassionate.\r\n\r\n"My friends, you are outcasts, though you do not know it, and you\r\nhave forfeited your place on earth. For there are two races--trees\r\nand man; and for each there is a different dispensation. Trees are\r\nsilent, motionless, serene. They live and die, but do not know the\r\ntaste of either life or death; to them a secret has been entrusted but\r\nnot revealed. But the other tribe--the passionate, tragic, rootless\r\ntree--man? Alas! he is a creature whose highest privileges are a curse.\r\nIn his mouth is ever the bitter-sweet taste of life and death, unknown\r\nto the trees. Without respite he is dragged by the two wild horses,\r\nmemory and hope; and he is tormented by a secret that he can never\r\ntell. For every man worthy of the name is an initiate; but each one\r\ninto different Mysteries. And some walk among their fellows with the\r\npitying, slightly scornful smile, of an adept among catechumens. And\r\nsome are confiding and garrulous, and would so willingly communicate\r\ntheir own unique secret--in vain! For though they shout it in the\r\nmarket-place, or whisper it in music and poetry, what they say is never\r\nthe same as what they know, and they are like ghosts charged with a\r\nmessage of tremendous import who can only trail their chains and gibber.\r\n\r\n"Such then are the two tribes. Citizens of Lud-in-the-Mist, to which do\r\nyou belong? To neither; for you are not serene, majestic, and silent,\r\nnor are you restless, passionate, and tragic.\r\n\r\n"I could not turn you into trees; but I had hoped to turn you into men.\r\n\r\n"I have fed and healed your bodies; and I would fain have done the same\r\nfor your souls." (He paused to mop his brow; clearly it was more of an\r\neffort for him to speak than one would have guessed. Then he went on,\r\nand his voice had in it a strange new thrill.) "There is a land where\r\nthe sun and the moon do not shine; where the birds are dreams, the\r\nstars are visions, and the immortal flowers spring from the thoughts\r\nof death. In that land grow fruit, the juices of which sometimes cause\r\nmadness, and sometimes manliness; for that fruit is flavoured with life\r\nand death, and it is the proper nourishment for the souls of man. You\r\nhave recently discovered that for some years I have helped to smuggle\r\nthat fruit into Dorimare. The farmer Gibberty would have deprived you\r\nof it--and so I prescribed for him the berries of merciful death."\r\n(This admission of guilt caused another disturbance at the back of the\r\nhall, and there were shouts of "Don\'t you believe him!" "Never say die,\r\nDoctor!" and so on. The Yeomanry had to put out various rough-looking\r\nmen, and Master Ambrose, sitting up on the dais, recognised among them\r\nthe sailor, Sebastian Thug, whom he and Master Nathaniel had seen\r\nin the Fields of Grammary. When silence and order had been restored\r\nEndymion Leer went on.) "Yes, I prescribed for him the berries of\r\nmerciful death. What could it matter to the world whether he reaped the\r\ncorn-fields of Dorimare, or the fields of gillyflowers beyond the hills?\r\n\r\n"And now, my Lords Judges, I will forestall your sentence. I have\r\npleaded guilty, and you will send me for a ride on what the common\r\npeople call Duke Aubrey\'s wooden horse; and you will think that you\r\nare sending me there because I helped to murder the farmer Gibberty.\r\nBut, my Lords Judges, you are purblind, and, even in spectacles, you\r\ncan only read a big coarse script. It is not you that are punishing me,\r\nbut others for a spiritual sin. During these days of my imprisonment\r\nI have pondered much on my own life, and I have come to see that I\r\nhave sinned. But how? I have prided myself on being a good chemist,\r\nand in my crucibles I can make the most subtle sauces yield up their\r\nsecret--whether it be white arsenic, rosalgar, mercury sublimate, or\r\ncantharides. But where is the crucible or the chemist that can analyse\r\na spiritual sin?\r\n\r\n"But I have not lived in vain. You will send me to ride on Duke\r\nAubrey\'s wooden horse, and, in time, the double-faced Doctor will be\r\nforgotten; and so will you, my Lords Judges. But Lud-in-the-Mist will\r\nstand, and the country of Dorimare, and the dreaded country beyond the\r\nhills. And the trees will continue to suck life from the earth and the\r\nclouds, and the winds will howl o\' nights, and men will dream dreams.\r\nAnd who knows? Some day, perhaps, my fickle bitter-sweet master, the\r\nlord of life and death, of laughter and tears, will come dancing at the\r\nhead of his silent battalions to make wild music in Dorimare.\r\n\r\n"This then, my Lords Judges, is my defence," and he gave a little bow\r\ntowards the dais.\r\n\r\nWhile he had been speaking, the Judges had shown increasing symptoms of\r\nirritation and impatience. This was not the language of the Law.\r\n\r\nAs for the public--it was divided. One part had sat taut with\r\nattention--lips slightly parted, eyes dreamy, as if they were listening\r\nto music. But the majority--even though many of them were partisans of\r\nthe Doctor--felt that they were being cheated. They had expected that\r\ntheir hero, whether guilty or not, would in his defence quite bamboozle\r\nthe Judges by his juggling with the evidence and brilliant casuistry.\r\nInstead of which his speech had been obscure, and, they dimly felt,\r\nindecent; so the girls tittered, and the young men screwed their mouths\r\ninto those grimaces which are the comment of the vulgar on anything\r\nthey consider both ridiculous and obscene.\r\n\r\n"Terribly bad taste, I call it," whispered Dame Dreamsweet to Dame\r\nMarigold (the sisters-in-law had agreed to bury the hatchet) "you\r\nalways said that little man was a low vulgar fellow." But Dame\r\nMarigold\'s only answer was a little shrug, and a tiny sigh.\r\n\r\nThen came the turn of the widow Gibberty to mount the pulpit and make\r\nher defence.\r\n\r\nBefore she began to speak, she fixed in turn the judges, plaintiff,\r\nand public, with an insolent scornful stare. Then, in her deep, almost\r\nmasculine voice, she began: "You\'ve asked me a question to which you\r\nknow the answer well enough, else I shouldn\'t be standing here now.\r\nYes, I murdered Gibberty--and a good riddance too. I was for killing\r\nhim with the sap of osiers, but the fellow you call Endymion Leer,\r\nwho was always a squeamish, tenderhearted, sort of chap (if there was\r\nnothing to lose by it, that\'s to say) got me the death-berries and\r\nmade me give them to him in a jelly, instead of the osiers." (It was a\r\npity Master Nathaniel was not there to glory in his own acumen!) "And\r\nit was not only because they caused a painless death that he preferred\r\nthe berries. He had never before seen them at their work, and he was\r\nalways a death-fancier--tasting, and smelling, and fingering death,\r\nlike a farmer does samples of grain at market. Though, to give him his\r\ndue, if it hadn\'t been for him, that girl over there who has just been\r\nstanding up to denounce him and me" (and she nodded in the direction of\r\nthe pale, trembling, Hazel) "and her father before her would long ago\r\nhave gone the way of the farmer. And this I say in the hope that the\r\nwench\'s conscience may keep her awake sometimes in the nights to come,\r\nremembering how she dealt with the man who had saved her life. It will\r\nbe but a small prick, doubtless; but it is the last that I can give her.\r\n\r\n"And now, good people, here\'s a word of advice to you, before I go my\r\nlast ride, a pillion to my old friend Endymion Leer. Never you make\r\na pet of a dead man. For the dead are dirty curs and bite the hand\r\nthat has fed them;" and with an evil smile she climbed down from the\r\npulpit, while more than one person in the audience felt faint with\r\nhorror and would willingly have left the hall.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left but for Master Polydore to pronounce the\r\nsentence; and though the accused had stolen some of his thunder,\r\nnevertheless the solemn time-honoured words did not fail to produce\r\ntheir wonted thrill:\r\n\r\n"Endymion Leer and Clementina Gibberty, I find you guilty of murder,\r\nand I consign your bodies to the birds, and your souls to whence they\r\ncame. And may all here present take example from your fate, correcting\r\ntheir conduct if it needs correction, or, if it be impeccable, keeping\r\nit so. For every tree can be a gallows, and every man has a neck to\r\nhang."\r\n\r\nThe widow received her sentence with complete stolidity; Endymion Leer\r\nwith a scornful smile. But as it was pronounced there was a stir and\r\nconfusion at the back of the hall, and a grotesque frenzied figure\r\nbroke loose from the detaining grip of her neighbours, and, struggling\r\nup to the dais, flung herself at the feet of Master Polydore. It was\r\nMiss Primrose Crabapple.\r\n\r\n"Your Worship! Your Worship!" she cried, shrilly, "Hang me instead\r\nof him! My life for his! Was it not I who gave your daughters fairy\r\nfruit, with my eyes open! And I glory in the knowledge that I was made\r\na humble instrument of the same master whom he has served so well.\r\nDear Master Polydore, have mercy on your country, spare your country\'s\r\nbenefactor, and if the law must have a victim let it be me--a foolish\r\nuseless woman, whose only merit was that she believed in loveliness\r\nthough she had never seen it."\r\n\r\nWeeping and struggling, her face twisted into a grotesque tragic mask,\r\nthey dragged her from the hall, amid the laughter and ironical cheers\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Mumchance came to Master Polydore to inform him that a\r\nyoung maid-servant from the Academy had just been to the guard-room to\r\nsay that Miss Primrose Crabapple had killed herself.\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore at once hurried off to the scene of the tragedy, and\r\nthere in the pleasant old garden where so many generations of Crabapple\r\nBlossoms had romped, and giggled, and exchanged their naughty little\r\nsecrets, he found Miss Primrose, hanging stone-dead from one of her own\r\napple-trees.\r\n\r\n"Well, as the old song has it, Mumchance," said Master Polydore--"\'Here\r\nhangs a maid who died for love.\'"\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore was noted for his dry humour.\r\n\r\nA gibbet had been set up in the great court of the Guildhall, and the\r\nnext day, at dawn, Endymion Leer and the widow Gibberty were hanged by\r\nthe neck till they died.\r\n\r\nRumour said that as the Doctor\'s face was contorted in its last grimace\r\nstrange silvery peals of laughter were heard proceeding from the room\r\nwhere long ago Duke Aubrey\'s jester had killed himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                     THE FAIR IN THE ELFIN MARCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after he had set out from the farm, Master Nathaniel\r\nreached a snug little hollow at the foot of the hills, chosen for their\r\ncamp by the consignment of the Lud Yeomanry stationed, by his own\r\norders, at the foot of the Debatable Hills.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" cried the sentry. And then he dropped his musket in amazement.\r\n"Well, I\'m blessed if it ain\'t his Worship!" he cried. Some six or\r\nseven of his mates, who were lounging about the camp, some playing\r\ncards, some lying on their backs and staring up at the sky, came\r\nhurrying up at the sound of the challenge, and, speechless with\r\nastonishment, they stared at Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n"I have come to look for my son," he said. "I have been told that ...\r\ner ... he came this way some two or three nights ago. If so, you must\r\nhave seen him."\r\n\r\nThe Yeomen shook their heads. "No, your Worship, we\'ve seen no little\r\nboy. In fact, all the weeks we\'ve been here we\'ve not seen a living\r\nsoul. And if there are any folks about they must be as swift as\r\nswallows and as silent-footed as cats, and as hard to see--well, as the\r\ndead themselves. No, your Worship, little Master Chanticleer has not\r\npassed this way."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel sighed wearily. "I had a feeling that you would not\r\nhave seen him," he said; adding dreamily more to himself than to them:\r\n"Who knows? He may have gone by the Milky Way."\r\n\r\nAnd then it struck him that this was probably the last normal encounter\r\nhe would ever have with ordinary human beings, and he smiled at them\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," he said, "you\'re having a pleasant holiday, I\r\nexpect ... nothing to do and plenty to eat and drink, eh? Here\'s a\r\ncouple of crowns for you. Send to one of the farms for a pigskin of red\r\nwine and drink my health ... and my son\'s. I\'m off on what may prove a\r\nvery long journey; I suppose this bridle-path will be as good a route\r\nas any?"\r\n\r\nThey stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Please, your Worship, if you\'ll excuse me mentioning it, you must\r\nbe making a mistake," said the sentry, in a shocked voice. "All the\r\nbridle-paths about here lead to nowhere but the Elfin Marches ... and\r\nbeyond."\r\n\r\n"It is for beyond that I am bound," answered Master Nathaniel curtly.\r\nAnd digging his spurs into his horse\'s flanks, he dashed past the\r\nhorrified Yeomen, and up one of the bridle-paths, as if he would take\r\nthe Debatable Hills by storm.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds they stood staring at one another, with scared,\r\nastonished eyes. Then the sentry gave a low whistle.\r\n\r\n"He must be powerful fond of that little chap," he said.\r\n\r\n"If the little chap really slipped past without our seeing him, that\r\nwill be the third Chanticleer to cross the hills. First there was the\r\nlittle missy at the Academy, then the young chap, then the Mayor."\r\n\r\n"Aye, but they didn\'t do it on an empty stomach--leastways, we know the\r\nCrabapple Blossoms didn\'t, and if the talk in Lud be true, the little\r\nchap had had a taste too of what he oughtn\'t," said another. "But it\'s\r\nanother story to go when you\'re in your right mind. Doctor Leer can\'t\r\nhave been in the right when he said all them Magistrates were played\r\nout, for it\'s the bravest thing has ever been done in Dorimare."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel, for how long he could not have said, went riding up\r\nand up the bridle-path that wound in and out among the foothills, which\r\ngradually grew higher and higher. Not a living creature did he meet\r\nwith--not a goat, not so much as a bird. He began to feel curiously\r\ndrowsy, as if he were riding in a dream.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his consciousness seemed to have gone out of gear, to have\r\nmissed one of the notches in time or space, for he found himself riding\r\nalong a high-road, in the midst of a crowd of peasants in holiday\r\nattire. Nor did this surprise him--his passive uncritical mood was\r\nimpervious to surprise.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... what were these people with whom he had mingled? An\r\nordinary troop of holiday-making peasants? At first sight, so they\r\nseemed. There were pretty girls, with sunny hair escaping from under\r\nred and blue handkerchiefs, and rustic dandies cross-gartered with\r\ngay ribands, and old women with quiet, nobly-lined faces--a village\r\ncommunity bound for some fair or merry-making.\r\n\r\nBut why were their eyes so fixed and strange, and why did they walk in\r\nabsolute silence?\r\n\r\nAnd then the invisible cicerone of dreams, who is one\'s other self,\r\nwhispered in his ear, These are they whom men call dead.\r\n\r\nAnd, like everything else said by that cicerone, these words seemed to\r\nthrow a flood of light on the situation, to make it immediately normal,\r\neven prosaic.\r\n\r\nThen the road took a sudden turn, and before them stretched a sort of\r\nheath, dotted with the white booths of a fair.\r\n\r\n"That is the market of souls," whispered the invisible cicerone. "Of\r\ncourse, of course," muttered Master Nathaniel, as if all his life he\r\nhad known of its existence. And, indeed, he had forgotten all about\r\nRanulph, and thought that to visit this fair had been the one object of\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the heath, and then they paid their gate-money to a silent\r\nold man. And though Master Nathaniel paid with a coin of a metal and\r\ndesign he had never seen before, it was with no sense of a link missing\r\nin the chain of cause and effect that he produced it from his pocket.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, there was nothing different in this fair from those in\r\nDorimare. Pewterers, shoemakers, silversmiths were displaying their\r\nwares; there were cows and sheep and pigs, and refreshment booths and\r\nraree-shows. But instead of the cheerful, variegated din that is part\r\nof the fun of the every-day fair, over this one there reigned complete\r\nsilence; for the beasts were as silent as the people. Dead silence, and\r\nblazing sun.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel started off to investigate the booths. In one of them\r\nthey were flinging darts at a pasteboard target, on which were painted\r\nvarious of the heavenly bodies, with the moon in the centre. Anyone\r\nwhose dart struck the moon was allowed to choose a prize from a heap of\r\nglittering miscellaneous objects--golden feathers, shells painted with\r\ncurious designs, brilliantly-coloured pots, fans, silver sheep-bells.\r\n\r\n"They\'re like Hempie\'s new ornaments," thought Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nIn another booth there was a merry-go-round of silver horses and\r\ngilded chariots--both sadly tarnished. It was a primitive affair\r\nthat moved not by machinery, but by the ceaseless trudging of a live\r\npony--a patient, dingy little beast--tied to it with a rope. And the\r\nmotion generated a thin, cracked music--tunes that had been popular in\r\nLud-in-the-Mist when Master Nathaniel had been a little boy.\r\n\r\nThere was "Oh, you Little Charmer with your pretty Puce Bow," there was\r\n"Old Daddy Popinjay fell down upon his Rump," there was "Why did she\r\ncock her Pretty Blue Eye at the Lad with the Silver Buckles?"\r\n\r\nBut, except for one solitary little boy, the tarnished horses and\r\nchariots whirled round without riders; and the pert tunes sounded so\r\nthin and wan as to accentuate rather than destroy the silence and\r\natmosphere of melancholy.\r\n\r\nIn a hopeless, resigned sort of way, the little boy was sobbing. It was\r\nas if he felt that he was doomed by some inexorable fate to whirl round\r\nfor ever and ever with the tarnished horses and chariots, the dingy,\r\npatient pony, and the old cracked tunes.\r\n\r\n"It is not long," said the invisible cicerone, "since that little boy\r\nwas stolen from the mortals. He still can weep."\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel felt a sudden tightening in his throat. Poor little\r\nboy! Poor little lonely boy! What was it he reminded him of? Something\r\npainful, and very near his heart.\r\n\r\nRound and round trudged the pony, round and round went the hidden\r\nmusical-box, grinding out its thin, blurred tunes.\r\n\r\n    Why did she cock her pretty blue eye\r\n    At the lad with the silver buckles,\r\n    When the penniless lad who was handsome and spry\r\n    Got nought but a rap on his knuckles?\r\n\r\nThese vulgar songs, though faded, were not really old. Nevertheless,\r\nto Master Nathaniel, they were the oldest songs in existence--sung by\r\nthe Morning Stars when all the world was young. For they were freighted\r\nwith his childhood, and brought the memory, or, rather, the tang, the\r\nscent, of the solemn innocent world of children, a world sans archness,\r\nsans humour, sans vulgarity, where they had sounded as pure and silvery\r\nas a shepherd\'s pipe. Where the little charmer with her puce bow, and\r\nthe scheming hussy who had cocked her blue eye had been own sisters to\r\nthe pretty fantastic ladies of the nursery rhymes, like them walking\r\nalways to the accompaniment of tinkling bells and living on frangipane\r\nand sillabubs of peaches and cream; and whose gestures were stylised\r\nand actions preposterous--nonsense actions that needed no explanation.\r\nWhile mothers-in-law, shrewish wives, falling in love--they were just\r\npretty words like brightly-coloured beads, strung together without\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nAs Master Nathaniel listened, he knew that other people would have\r\nheard other tunes--whatever tunes through the milkman\'s whistle, or\r\nthe cracked fiddle of a street musician, or the voices of young sparks\r\nreturning from the tavern at midnight, the Morning Stars may have\r\nhappened to sing in their own particular infancy.\r\n\r\n    Oh, you little charmer with your pretty puce bow,\r\n    I\'ll tell mamma if you carry on so!\r\n\r\nRound and round whirled the tarnished horses and chariots with their\r\none pathetic little rider; round and round trudged the pony--the little\r\ndusty, prosaic pony.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel rubbed his eyes and looked round; he felt as if after\r\na dive he were slowly rising to the surface of the water. The fair\r\nseemed to be coming alive--the silence had changed into a low murmur.\r\nAnd now it was swelling into the mingled din of chattering voices,\r\nlowing cows, grunting pigs, blasts from tin trumpets, hoarse voices of\r\ncheap-jacks praising their wares--all the noises, in short, that one\r\nconnects with an ordinary fair.\r\n\r\nHe sauntered away from the merry-go-round and mingled with the crowd.\r\nAll the stall-keepers were doing a brisk trade, but, above all, the\r\nmarket gardeners--their stalls were simply thronged.\r\n\r\nBut, lo and behold! the fruit that they were selling was of the kind\r\nhe had seen in the mysterious room of the Guildhall, and concealed\r\ninside the case of his grandfather\'s clock--it was fairy fruit; but the\r\nknowledge brought no sense of moral condemnation.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized that his throat was parched with thirst and that\r\nnothing would slake it but one of these translucent globes.\r\n\r\nThe wizened old woman who was selling them cried out to him coaxingly,\r\n"Three for a penny, sir! Or, for you, I\'ll make it four for a\r\npenny--for the sake of your hazel eyes, lovey! You\'ll find them as\r\ngrateful as dew to the flowers--four for a penny, pretty master. Don\'t\r\nsay no!"\r\n\r\nBut he had the curious feeling that one sometimes has in dreams,\r\nnamely, that he himself was inventing what was happening to him, and\r\ncould make it end as he chose.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said to himself, "I am telling myself one of Hempie\'s old\r\nstories, about a youngest son who has been warned against eating\r\nanything offered to him by strangers, so, of course, I shall not touch\r\nit."\r\n\r\nSo with a curt "No thank\'ee, nothing doing today," he contemptuously\r\nturned his back on the old woman and her fruit.\r\n\r\nBut whose was that shrill voice? Probably that of some cheapjack whose\r\npatter or whose wares, to judge from the closely-packed throng hiding\r\nhim from view, had some particularly attractive quality. The voice\r\nsounded vaguely familiar, and, his curiosity aroused, Master Nathaniel\r\njoined the crowd of spectators.\r\n\r\nHe could discern nothing but the top of a red head, but the patter was\r\naudible: "Now\'s your chance, gentlemen! Beauty doesn\'t keep, but rots\r\nlike apples. Apple-shies! Four points if you hit her on the breast, six\r\nif you hit her on the mouth, and he who first gets twenty points wins\r\nthe maid. Don\'t fight shy of the apple-shies! Apples and beauty do not\r\nkeep--there\'s a worm in both. Step up, step up, gentlemen!"\r\n\r\nYes, he had heard that voice before. He began to shoulder his way\r\nthrough the crowd. It proved curiously yielding, and he had no\r\ndifficulty in reaching the centre of attraction, a wooden platform on\r\nwhich gesticulated, grimaced and pirouetted ... who but his rascally\r\ngroom Willy Wisp, dressed as a harlequin. But Willy Wisp was not the\r\nstrangest part of the spectacle. Out of the platform grew an apple\r\ntree, and tied to it was his own daughter, Prunella, while grouped\r\naround her in various attitudes of woe were the other Crabapple\r\nBlossoms.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Master Nathaniel felt convinced that this was not merely\r\na story he was inventing himself, but, as well, it was a dream--a\r\ngrotesque, illogical, synthesis of scraps of reality, to which he\r\ncould add what elements he chose.\r\n\r\n"What\'s happening?" he asked his neighbour.\r\n\r\nBut he knew the answer--Willy Wisp was selling the girls to the highest\r\nbidder, to labour in the fields of gillyflowers.\r\n\r\n"But you have no right to do this!" he cried out in a loud angry\r\nvoice, "no right whatever. This is not Fairyland--it is only the\r\nElfin Marches. They cannot be sold until they have crossed over into\r\nFairyland--I say they cannot be sold."\r\n\r\nAll round him he heard awed whispers, "It is Chanticleer--Chanticleer\r\nthe dreamer, who has never tasted fruit." Then he found himself giving\r\na learned dissertation on the law of property, as observed in the\r\nElfin Marches. The crowd listened to him in respectful silence. Even\r\nWilly Wisp was listening, and the Crabapple Blossoms gazed at him with\r\ninexpressible gratitude.\r\n\r\nWith what seemed to him a superbly eloquent peroration he brought his\r\ndiscourse to an end. Prunella stretched out her arms to him, crying,\r\n"Father, you have saved us! You and the Law."\r\n\r\n"You and the Law! You and the Law!" echoed the other Crabapple Blossoms.\r\n\r\n"Chanticleer and the Law! Chanticleer and the Law!" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fair had vanished. He was in a strange town, and was one of a great\r\ncrowd of people all hurrying in the same direction.\r\n\r\n"They are looking for the bleeding corpse," whispered the invisible\r\ncicerone, and the words filled Master Nathaniel with an unspeakable\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nThen the crowd vanished, leaving him alone in a street as silent as\r\nthe grave. He pressed forward, for he knew that he was looking for\r\nsomething; but what it was he had forgotten. At every street corner he\r\ncame on a dead man, guarded by a stone beggar with a face like the herm\r\nin the Gibberty\'s orchard. He was almost choked by the horror of it.\r\nThe terror became articulate: "Supposing one of the corpses should turn\r\nout to be that little lonely boy on the merry-go-round!"\r\n\r\nThis possibility filled him with an indescribable anguish.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered about Ranulph. Ranulph had gone to the country\r\nfrom which there is no return.\r\n\r\nBut he was going to follow him there and fetch him back. Nothing would\r\nstop him--he would push, if necessary, through fold after fold of\r\ndreams until he reached their heart.\r\n\r\nHe bent down and touched one of the corpses. It was warm, and it\r\nmoved. As he touched it he realized that he had incurred the danger of\r\ncontamination from some mysterious disease.\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t real, it isn\'t real," he muttered. "I\'m inventing it all\r\nmyself. And so, whatever happens, I shan\'t mind, because it isn\'t real."\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark. He knew that he was being followed by one of\r\nthe stone beggars, who had turned into a four-footed animal called\r\nPortunus. In one sense the animal was a protection, in another a\r\nmenace, and he knew that in summoning him he must be very careful to\r\nuse the correct ritual formulary.\r\n\r\nHe had reached a square, on one side of which was a huge building\r\nwith a domed roof. Light streamed from it through a great window of\r\nstained glass, on which was depicted a blue warrior fighting with a\r\nred dragon ... no, it was not a stained glass window but merely the\r\nreflection on the white walls of the building from a house in complete\r\ndarkness in the opposite side of the square, inhabited by creatures\r\nmade of red lacquer. He knew that they were expecting him to call,\r\nbecause they believed that he was courting one of them.\r\n\r\n"What else could bring him here save all this lovely spawn?" said a\r\nvoice at his elbow.\r\n\r\nHe looked round--suddenly the streets were pullulating with strange\r\nsemi-human fauna: tiny green men, the wax figures of his parents from\r\nHempie\'s chimney-piece, grimacing greybeards with lovely children\r\ngamboling round them dressed in beetles\' shards.\r\n\r\nNow they were dancing, some slow old-fashioned dance ... in and out, in\r\nand out. Why, they were only figures on a piece of tapestry flapping in\r\nthe wind!\r\n\r\nOnce more he felt his horse beneath him. But what were these little\r\npattering footsteps behind him? He turned uneasily in his saddle, to\r\ndiscover that it was nothing but a gust of wind rustling a little eddy\r\nof dead leaves.\r\n\r\nThe town and its strange fauna had vanished, and once more he was\r\nriding up the bridle-path; but now it was night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                    "BY THE SUN, MOON AND STARS AND\r\n                    THE GOLDEN APPLES OF THE WEST"\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it was a relief to have returned to the fresh air of reality,\r\nMaster Nathaniel was frightened. He realized that he was alone at dead\r\nof night in the Elfin Marches. And the moon kept playing tricks on him,\r\nturning trees and boulders into goblins and wild beasts; cracking her\r\njokes, true humourist that she was, with a solemn impassive face. But,\r\nhow was this? She was a waxing moon, and almost full, while the night\r\nbefore--or what he supposed was the night before--she had been a half\r\nmoon on the wane.\r\n\r\nHad he left time behind him in Dorimare?\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, like some winged monster rushing from its lair, there\r\nsprang up a mighty wind. The pines creaked and rustled and bent beneath\r\nits onslaught, the grasses whistled, the clouds flocked together and\r\ncovered the face of the moon.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he was nearly lifted from his saddle. He drew his cloak\r\nclosely round him, and longed, with an unspeakable longing, for his\r\nwarm bed in Lud; and it flashed into his mind that what he had so often\r\nimagined in that bed, to enhance his sense of well-being, was now\r\nactually occurring--he was tired, he was cold, and the wind was finding\r\nthe fissures in his doublet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if some hero had slain the monster, the wind died down,\r\nthe moon sailed clear of the clouds, and the pines straightened\r\nthemselves and once more stood at attention, silent and motionless. In\r\nspite of this, his horse grew strangely restive, rearing and jibbing,\r\nas if something was standing before it in the path that frightened it;\r\nand in vain Master Nathaniel tried to quiet and sooth it.\r\n\r\nThen it shuddered all over and fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Master Nathaniel was thrown clear, and was not hurt,\r\nbeyond the inevitable bruises entailed by the fall of a man of his\r\nweight. He struggled to his feet and hurried to his horse. It was stone\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nFor some time he sat beside it ... his last link with Lud and familiar\r\nthings; as yet too depressed in mind and aching in body to continue his\r\njourney on foot.\r\n\r\nBut what were those sudden strains of piercingly sweet music, and from\r\nwhat strange instrument did they proceed? They were too impersonal for\r\na fiddle, too passionate for a flute, and much too sweet for any pipes\r\nor timbrels. It must be a human--or superhuman--voice, for now he was\r\nbeginning to distinguish the words.\r\n\r\n    "There are windfalls of dreams, there\'s a wolf in the stars,\r\n    And Life is a nymph who will never be thine,\r\n    With lily, germander, and sops in wine.\r\n    With sweet-brier,\r\n    And bon-fire,\r\n    And strawberry-wire,\r\n    And columbine."\r\n\r\nThe voice stopped, and Master Nathaniel buried his face in his hands\r\nand sobbed as if his heart would break.\r\n\r\nIn this magically sweet music once more he had heard the Note. It held,\r\nthis time, no menace as to things to come; but it aroused in his breast\r\nan agonizing tumult of remorse for having allowed something to escape\r\nthat he would never, never recapture. It was as if he had left his\r\nbeloved with harsh words, and had returned to find her dead.\r\n\r\nThrough his agony he was conscious of a hand laid on his shoulder:\r\n"Why, Chanticleer! Old John o\' Dreams! What ails you? Has the cock\'s\r\ncrow become too bitter-sweet for Chanticleer?" said a voice, half\r\ntender and half mocking, in his ear.\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and by the light of the moon saw standing behind\r\nhim--Duke Aubrey.\r\n\r\nThe Duke smiled. "Well, Chanticleer," he said, "so we meet at last!\r\nYour family has been dodging me down the centuries, but some day you\r\nwere bound to fall into my snares. And, though you did not know it,\r\nyou have been working for some time past as one of my secret agents.\r\nHow I laughed when you and Ambrose Honeysuckle pledged each other in\r\nwords taken from my Mysteries! And little did you think, when you stood\r\ncursing and swearing at the door of my tapestry-room, that you had\r\npronounced the most potent charm in Faerie," and he threw back his head\r\nand broke into peal upon peal of silvery laughter.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his laughter stopped, and his eyes, as he looked at Master\r\nNathaniel, became wonderfully compassionate.\r\n\r\n"Poor Chanticleer! Poor John o\' Dreams!" he said gently. "I have\r\noften wished my honey were not so bitter to the taste. Believe me,\r\nChanticleer, I fain would find an antidote to the bitter herb of life,\r\nbut none grows this side of the hills--or the other."\r\n\r\n"And yet ... I have never tasted fairy fruit," said Master Nathaniel in\r\na low broken voice.\r\n\r\n"There are many trees in my orchard, and many and various are the fruit\r\nthey bear--music and dreams and grief and, sometimes, joy. All your\r\nlife, Chanticleer, you have eaten fairy fruit, and some day, it may be,\r\nyou will hear the Note again--but that I cannot promise. And now I will\r\ngrant you a vision--they are sometimes sweet to the taste."\r\n\r\nHe paused. And then he said, "Do you know why it was that your horse\r\nfell down dead? It was because you had reached the brink of Fairyland.\r\nThe winds of Faerie slew him. Come with me, Chanticleer."\r\n\r\nHe took Master Nathaniel\'s hand and dragged him to his feet, and they\r\nscrambled a few yards further up the bridle-path and stepped on to\r\na broad plateau. Beneath them lay what, in the uncertain moonlight,\r\nlooked like a stretch of desolate uplands.\r\n\r\nThen Duke Aubrey raised his arms high above his head and cried out in\r\na loud voice, "By the Sun, Moon and Stars and the Golden Apples of the\r\nWest!"\r\n\r\nAt these words the uplands became bathed in a gentle light and proved\r\nto be fair and fertile--the perpetual seat of Spring; for there\r\nwere vivid green patches of young corn, and pillars of pink and\r\nwhite smoke, which were fruit trees in blossom, and pillars of blue\r\nblossom, which was the smoke of distant hamlets, and a vast meadow of\r\ncornflowers and daisies, which was the great inland sea of Faerie. And\r\neverything--ships, spires, houses--was small and bright and delicate,\r\nyet real. It was not unlike Dorimare, or rather, the transfigured\r\nDorimare he had once seen from the Fields of Grammary. And as he gazed\r\nhe knew that in that land no winds ever howled at night, and that\r\neverything within its borders had the serenity and stability of trees,\r\nthe unchanging peace of pictures.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, it all vanished. Duke Aubrey had vanished too, and he\r\nwas standing alone on the edge of a black abyss, while wafted on the\r\nwind came the echo of light, mocking laughter.\r\n\r\nWas Fairyland, then, a delusion? Had Ranulph vanished into nothingness?\r\n\r\nFor a second or two he hesitated, and then--he leaped down into the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                   A MESSAGE COMES TO HAZEL AND THE\r\n                    FIRST SWALLOW TO DAME MARIGOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information given by Luke Hempen had enabled the authorities in Lud\r\nfinally to put a stop to the import of fairy fruit. As we have seen,\r\nthe Dapple had been dragged near its source, and wicker frails had been\r\nbrought up, so cunningly weighted that they could float beneath the\r\nsurface of the water, and closely packed with what was unmistakably\r\nfairy fruit. After that no further cases of fruit-eating came to\r\nMumchance\'s notice. But, for all that, his anxieties were by no means\r\nat an end, for the execution of Endymion Leer came near to causing a\r\npopular rising. An angry mob, armed with cudgels and led by Bawdy Bess,\r\nstormed the court of the Guildhall, cut down the body--which had been\r\nleft hanging on the gibbet as an example to evildoers--and bore it off\r\nin triumph; and the longest funeral procession that had been seen for\r\nyears was shortly following it to the Fields of Grammary.\r\n\r\nThe cautious Mumchance considered it would be imprudent to interfere\r\nwith the obsequies.\r\n\r\n"After all, your Worship," he said to Master Polydore, "the Law has\r\nhad his blood, and if it will mean a little peace and quiet she can do\r\nwithout his corpse."\r\n\r\nThe next day many of the \'prentices and artizans went on strike, and\r\nseveral captains of merchant vessels reported that their crews showed\r\nsigns of getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nMaster Polydore was terrified out of his wits, and Mumchance was\r\ninclined to take a very gloomy view of the situation: "If the town\r\nchooses to rise the Yeomanry can do nothing against them," he said\r\ndejectedly. "We ain\'t organized (if your Worship will pardon the\r\nexpression) for trouble--no, we ain\'t."\r\n\r\nThen, as if by a miracle, everything quieted down. The strikers,\r\nas meek as lambs, returned to their work, the sailors ceased to be\r\nturbulent, and Mumchance declared that it was years since the Yeomanry\r\nhad had so little to do.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing like taking strong measures at once," Master Polydore\r\nremarked complacently to Master Ambrose (whom he had taken as his\r\nmentor in the place of Endymion Leer). "Once let them feel that there\r\nis a strong man at the helm, and you can do anything with them. And, of\r\ncourse, they never felt that with poor old Nat."\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose\'s only answer was a grunt--and a rather sardonic smile.\r\nFor Master Ambrose happened to be one of the few people who knew what\r\nhad really happened.\r\n\r\nThe sudden calm was due neither to a miracle, nor to the strong\r\nhand of Master Polydore. It had been brought about by two humble\r\nagents--Mistress Ivy Peppercorn and Hazel Gibberty.\r\n\r\nOne evening they had been sitting in the little parlour behind the\r\ngrocer\'s shop over the first fire of the season.\r\n\r\nAs plaintiff and principal witness in the unpopular trial, their\r\nsituation was not without danger. In fact, Mumchance had advised them\r\nto move into Lud till the storm had blown over. But, to Hazel, Lud was\r\nthe place where the widow was buried, and, full as she was of western\r\nsuperstitions, she felt that she could not bear to sleep enclosed by\r\nthe same town walls as the angry corpse. Nor would she return to the\r\nfarm. Her aunt had told her of Master Nathaniel\'s half-joking plan to\r\ncommunicate with her, and Hazel insisted that even though he had gone\r\nbehind the Debatable Hills it was their clear duty to remain within\r\nreach of a message.\r\n\r\nThat evening Mistress Ivy was waxing a little plaintive over her\r\nobstinacy. "I sometimes think, Hazel, your wits have been turned,\r\nliving so long with that bad bold woman ... and I don\'t wonder, I\'m\r\nsure, poor child; and if my poor Peppercorn hadn\'t come along, I don\'t\r\nknow what would have happened to me. But there\'s no sense, I tell you,\r\nin waiting on here--with the hams and bacon at home not cured yet, nor\r\nthe fish salted for winter, nor your fruit pickled or preserved. You\'re\r\na farmer on your own now, and you shouldn\'t forget it. And I wish to\r\ngoodness you\'d get all that silly nonsense out of your head. A message\r\nfrom the Mayor, indeed! Though I can\'t get over its being him that came\r\nto see me, and me never knowing, but giving him sauce, as if he\'d been\r\nnothing but a shipmate of my poor Peppercorn\'s! No, no, poor gentleman,\r\nwe\'ll never hear from him! Leastways, not this side of the Debatable\r\nHills."\r\n\r\nHazel said nothing. But her obstinate little chin looked even more\r\nobstinate than usual.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she looked up with startled eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hark, auntie!" she cried. "Didn\'t you hear someone knocking?"\r\n\r\n"What a girl you are for fancying things! It\'s only the wind," said\r\nMistress Ivy querulously.\r\n\r\n"Why, auntie, there it is again! No, no, I\'m sure it\'s someone\r\nknocking. I\'ll just go and see," and she took a candle from the table;\r\nbut her hand was trembling.\r\n\r\nThe knocking was audible now to Mistress Ivy as well.\r\n\r\n"You just stay where you are, my girl!" she cried shrilly. "It\'ll be\r\none of these rough chaps from the town, and I won\'t have you opening\r\nthe door--no, I won\'t."\r\n\r\nBut Hazel paid no attention, and, though her face was white and her\r\neyes very scared, she marched boldly into the shop and called, "Who\'s\r\nthere?" through the door.\r\n\r\n"By the Sun, Moon and Stars and the Golden Apples of the West!" came\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n"Auntie! Auntie!" she cried shrilly, "it\'s from the Mayor. He has sent\r\na messenger, and you must come."\r\n\r\nThis brought Mistress Ivy hurrying to her side. Though she was not of\r\nan heroic character, she came of good sturdy stock, and she was not\r\ngoing to leave her dead brother\'s child to face the dangers of the\r\nunseen alone, but her teeth were chattering with terror. Evidently the\r\nmessenger was growing impatient, for he began beating a tattoo on the\r\ndoor and singing in a shrill sweet voice:\r\n\r\n    "Maids in your smocks\r\n    Look well to your locks\r\n    And beware of the fox\r\n    When the bellman knocks."\r\n\r\nHazel (not without some fumbling, for her hands were still trembling)\r\ndrew the bolts, lifted the latch, and flung the door wide open. A\r\nsudden gust of wind extinguished her candle, so they could not see the\r\nface of the messenger.\r\n\r\nHe began speaking in a shrill, expressionless voice, like that of a\r\nchild repeating a lesson: "I have given the pass-word, so you know from\r\nwhom I come. I am to bid you go at once to Lud-in-the-Mist, and find\r\na sailor, by name Sebastian Thug--he will probably be drinking at the\r\ntavern of the Unicorn--also a deaf-mute, commonly known as Bawdy Bess,\r\nwhom you will probably find in the same place. You will have need of\r\nno other introduction than the words, By the Sun, Moon and Stars and\r\nthe Golden Apples of the West. You are to tell them that there is to\r\nbe no more rioting, and that they are to keep the people quiet, for\r\nthe Duke will send his deputy. And next you will go to Master Ambrose\r\nHoneysuckle and bid him remember the oath which he and Master Nathaniel\r\npledged each other over wild-thyme gin, swearing to ride the wind\r\nwith a loose rein, and to be hospitable to visions. And tell him that\r\nLud-in-the-Mist must throw wide its gates to receive its destiny. Can\r\nyou remember this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Hazel in a low puzzled voice.\r\n\r\n"And now just a trifle to the messenger for his pains!" and his voice\r\nbecame gay and challenging. "I am an orchard thief and the citizen of\r\na green world. Buss me, green maid!" and before Hazel had time to\r\nprotest he gave her a smacking kiss on the lips and then plunged into\r\nthe night, leaving the echoes of his "Ho, ho, hoh!" like a silvery\r\ntrail in his wake.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never did!" exclaimed Mistress Ivy in amazement, adding with a\r\nfat chuckle, "It would seem that it isn\'t only this side of the hills\r\nthat saucy young fellows are to be found. But I don\'t quite know what\r\nto make of it, my girl. How are we to know he really comes from the\r\nMayor?"\r\n\r\n"Well, auntie, we can\'t know, of course, for certain--though, for my\r\npart, I don\'t think he was a Dorimarite. But he gave the pass-word, so\r\nI think we must deliver the messages--there\'s nothing in them, after\r\nall, that could do any harm."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said Mistress Ivy. "Though I\'m sure I don\'t want to go\r\ntrudging into Lud at this time of night on a fool\'s errand. But, after\r\nall, a promise is a promise--and doubly so when it\'s been given to\r\nsomebody as good as dead."\r\n\r\nSo they put on their pattens and cloaks, lighted a lanthorn, and\r\nstarted off to walk into Lud, as briskly as Mistress Ivy\'s age and\r\nweight would allow, so as to get there before the gates were shut.\r\nMaster Ambrose, as a Senator, would give them a pass to let them\r\nthrough on the way back.\r\n\r\nThe Unicorn was a low little tavern down by the wharf, of a not very\r\nsavoury reputation. And as they peeped in at the foul noisy little den,\r\nHazel had considerable difficulty in persuading Mistress Ivy to enter.\r\n\r\n"And to think of the words we have to use too!" the poor woman\r\nwhispered disconsolately; "they\'re not at the best of times the sort of\r\nwords I like to hear on a woman\'s lips, but in a place like this you\r\ncan\'t be too careful of your speech ... it\'s never safe to swear at\r\nfolks in liquor."\r\n\r\nBut the effect produced by the words was the exact opposite of what\r\nshe had feared. On first crossing the threshold they had been greeted\r\nby hostile glances and coarse jests, which, on one of the revellers\r\nrecognizing them as two of the protagonists in the trial, threatened to\r\nturn into something more serious. Whereupon, to the terror of Mistress\r\nIvy, Hazel had made a trumpet of her hands and shouted with all the\r\nforce of her strong young lungs, "Sebastian Thug and Mistress Bess! By\r\nthe Sun, Moon and Stars and the Golden Apples of the West!"\r\n\r\nThe words must indeed have contained a charm, for they instantly\r\ncalmed the angry company. A tall young sailor, with very light eyes\r\nand a very sunburned face, sprang to his feet, and so did a bold-eyed,\r\npainted woman, and they hurried to Hazel\'s side. The young man said in\r\na respectful voice, "You must excuse our rough and ready ways when we\r\nfirst saw you, missie; we didn\'t know you were one of us." And then\r\nhe grinned, showing some very white teeth, and said, "You see, pretty\r\nfresh things don\'t often come our way, and sea-dogs are like other\r\ndogs and bark at what they\'re not used to."\r\n\r\nBawdy Bess\'s eyes had been fixed on his lips, and his last words caused\r\nher to scowl and toss her head; but from Hazel they brought forth a\r\nlittle, not unfriendly, smile. Evidently, like her aunt, she was not\r\naverse to seafaring men. And, after all, sailors are apt to have a\r\ncharm of their own. When on dry land, like ghosts when they walk, there\r\nis a tang about them of an alien element. And Sebastian Thug was a\r\nthorough sailor.\r\n\r\nThen in a low voice Hazel gave the message, which Thug repeated on his\r\nfingers for the benefit of Bawdy Bess. He insisted on conducting them\r\nto Master Ambrose\'s, and said he would wait outside for them and see\r\nthem home.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose made them repeat the words several times, and questioned\r\nthem closely about the messenger.\r\n\r\nThen he took two or three paces up and down the room, muttering to\r\nhimself, "Delusion! Delusion!"\r\n\r\nThen he turned suddenly to Hazel and said sharply, "What reason have\r\nyou to believe, young woman, that this fellow really came from Master\r\nNathaniel?"\r\n\r\n"None, sir," answered Hazel. "But there was nothing for us to do but to\r\nact as if he did."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see. You, too, ride the wind--that\'s the expression, isn\'t\r\nit? Well, well, we are living in strange times."\r\n\r\nAnd then he sank into a brown study, evidently forgetful of their\r\npresence; so they thought it best quietly to steal away.\r\n\r\nFrom that evening the rabble of Lud-in-the-Mist ceased to give any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yeomen stationed on the border were recalled to Lud and spread\r\nthe news that they had seen Master Nathaniel riding alone towards the\r\nElfin Marches, Dame Marigold was condoled with as a widow, and went\r\ninto complete retirement, refusing even to see her oldest friends,\r\nalthough they had all come to regret their unjust suspicions of Master\r\nNathaniel, and were, in consequence, filled with contrition, and eager\r\nto prove it in services to his wife.\r\n\r\nOccasionally she made an exception for Master Ambrose; but her real\r\nsupport and stay was old Hempie. Nothing could shake the woman\'s\r\nconviction that all was well with the Chanticleers. And the real anchor\r\nis not hope but faith--even if it be only somebody else\'s faith. So the\r\ngay snug little room at the top of the house, where Master Nathaniel\r\nhad played when he was a little boy, became Dame Marigold\'s only haven,\r\nand there she would spend the most of her day.\r\n\r\nThough Hempie never forgot that she was only a Vigil, nevertheless,\r\nin her own way, she was growing fond of her. Indeed, she had\r\nalmost forgiven her for having spilled her cup of chocolate over\r\nher sheets, when, after her betrothal, she had come on a visit to\r\nMaster Nathaniel\'s parents--almost, but not quite, for to Hempie the\r\nChanticleers\' linen was sacrosanct.\r\n\r\nOne night, at the beginning of December, when the first snow was lying\r\non the ground, Dame Marigold, who had almost lost the power of sleep,\r\nwas tossing wakefully in her bed. Her bedroom ran the whole length of\r\nthe house, so one of its windows looked out on the lane, and suddenly\r\nshe heard what sounded like low knocking on the front door. She sat up\r\nand listened--there it was again. Yes, someone was knocking at the door.\r\n\r\nShe sprang from bed, flung on a cloak and hurried downstairs, her heart\r\nbeating violently.\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers she drew the bolts and flung wide the door. A\r\nsmall, slight figure was cowering outside.\r\n\r\n"Prunella!" she gasped. And with a sort of sob Prunella flung herself\r\ninto her mother\'s arms.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes they stood crying and hugging each other, too\r\nprofoundly moved for questions or explanations.\r\n\r\nBut they were roused by a scolding voice from the stairs: "Dame\r\nMarigold, I\'m ashamed of you, that I am, not having more sense at your\r\nage than to keep her standing there when she must be half frozen,\r\npoor child! Come up to your room this minute, Miss Prunella, and no\r\nnonsense! I\'ll have your fire lighted and a warming-pan put in your\r\nbed."\r\n\r\nIt was Hempie, candle in hand, frowning severely from under the frills\r\nof an enormous nightcap. Prunella rushed at her, half laughing, half\r\ncrying, and flung her arms round her neck.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds Hempie allowed herself to be hugged, and then,\r\nscolding hard all the time, she chivvied her up to her room. And,\r\nwhen Prunella was finally settled in her warm bed, with an inexorable\r\nexpression she strode in carrying a cup of some steaming infusion.\r\n\r\nIt was black currant tea, for the brewing of which Hempie was famous.\r\nAnd it had always been one of her grievances against Dame Marigold and\r\nPrunella that they detested the stuff, and refused to drink it, even\r\nwhen they had a bad cold. For it had always been loved by all true\r\nChanticleers, from old Master Josiah downwards.\r\n\r\n"Now, miss, you just drink that down, every drop of it," she said\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nPrunella was too exhausted that night to tell them her adventures. But\r\nthe next morning she gave a confused account of wanderings at the\r\nbottom of the sea, and how they had lost their way in a terrible marine\r\njungle, out of which they had been guided by Master Nathaniel. It was\r\nevident that she had no very clear recollection of what had happened to\r\nher since her flight from Lud; or, rather, since "Professor Wisp" had\r\ngiven his first dancing lesson.\r\n\r\nThe other Crabapple Blossoms returned to their respective homes the\r\nsame night as Prunella; and each gave a different account of their\r\nadventures. Moonlove Honeysuckle said they had danced wildly down the\r\nwaste places of the sky, and then had been imprisoned in a castle in\r\nthe moon; Viola Vigil said they had been chased by angry trees into\r\nthe Dapple, where they had got entangled in the weeds, and could not\r\nextricate themselves--and so on. But on one point all the accounts\r\nagreed, namely, that it had been Master Nathaniel Chanticleer who had\r\ndelivered them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                     MASTER AMBROSE KEEPS HIS VOW\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first the Crabapple Blossoms felt as if they had awakened from an\r\nevil dream, but they soon found that it was a dream that had profoundly\r\ninfluenced their souls. Though they showed no further desire to run\r\naway and roam the hills, they were moody, silent, prone to attacks of\r\nviolent weeping, and haunted by some nameless fear--strange melancholy\r\ndenizens, in fact, of the comfortable, placid homes of their parents.\r\n\r\nOne would not have imagined that a daughter in this condition\r\nwould have met with much sympathy from Master Ambrose Honeysuckle.\r\nNevertheless, his tenderness and patience with Moonlove proved\r\nboundless. Night after night he sat by her holding her hand till she\r\nfell asleep, and by day he soothed her ravings, and in her quieter\r\nmoments they would have long intimate talks together, such as they had\r\nnever had before she ran away. And the result of these talks was that\r\nhis stiff but fundamentally honest mind was beginning to creak on its\r\nhinges. And he would actually listen without protest when Moonlove\r\nexpressed her conviction that although fairy fruit had robbed her of\r\nher peace of mind, nevertheless nothing but fairy fruit could restore\r\nit to her, and that at Miss Primrose Crabapple\'s she had either been\r\ngiven the wrong kind or not enough.\r\n\r\nThe reign of winter was now established, and Lud-in-the-Mist seemed at\r\nlast to have settled down into its old peaceful rut.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel had turned into "poor old Nat," and was to most people\r\nno more than a lovable ghost of the past. Indeed, Master Polydore was\r\nthinking of suggesting to Dame Marigold that two empty coffins should\r\nbe placed in the Chanticleers\' chapel bearing respectively the names of\r\nNathaniel and Ranulph.\r\n\r\nAs for the Senate, it was very busy preparing for its annual banquet,\r\nwhich was celebrated every December in the Guildhall, to commemorate\r\nthe expulsion of the Dukes; and it was kept fully occupied by such\r\nimportant questions as how many turkeys should be ordered and from\r\nwhat poulterers; which Senator was to have the privilege of providing\r\nthe wine, and which the marzipan and ginger; and whether they would be\r\njustified in expending on goose liver and peacocks\' hearts the sum left\r\nthem in the will of a late linen-draper, to be devoted to the general\r\nwelfare of the inhabitants of Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\nBut one morning a polished conceit of Master Polydore\'s concerning\r\n"that sweet and pungent root commonly known as ginger, a kindly snake\r\nwho stings us that we may better enjoy the fragrant juice of the\r\ngrape," was rudely interrupted by the sudden entry of Mumchance, his\r\neyes almost starting out of his head with terror, with the appalling\r\ntidings that an army of Fairies had crossed the Debatable Hills, and\r\nthat crowds of terrified peasants were pouring into Lud.\r\n\r\nThe news produced something like pandemonium in the Senate. Everyone\r\nbegan talking at once, and a dozen different schemes of defence were\r\nmooted, each one more senseless than the last.\r\n\r\nThen Master Ambrose Honeysuckle rose to his feet. He was the man that\r\ncarried most weight among his colleagues, and all eyes were turned to\r\nhim expectantly.\r\n\r\nIn a calm, matter of fact voice, he began thus: "Senators of Dorimare!\r\nBefore the entry of the Captain of the Yeomanry we were discussing what\r\ndesert we should have at our annual feast. It seems unnecessary to\r\nstart a fresh subject of discussion before the previous one has been\r\nsettled to our satisfaction. So, with your permission, I will return\r\nto the sweet and pungent (I think these were his Worship\'s well-chosen\r\nwords) subject of dessert; for there is one item I should like to add\r\nto those that have already been suggested."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then he said in a loud challenging voice, "Senators of\r\nDorimare! I propose that for the first time since the foundation of our\r\nannual feast, we should partake at it of ... fairy fruit!"\r\n\r\nHis colleagues stared at him in open-mouthed amazement. Was this some\r\nill-timed jest? But Ambrose was not given to jesting ... especially on\r\nserious occasions.\r\n\r\nThen, with a certain rough poetry breaking through the artificial\r\ndiction of the Senate, he began to speak of the events of the year that\r\nwas nearly over, and the lessons to be learned from them. And the chief\r\nlessons, he said, were those of humility and faith.\r\n\r\nHe ended thus: "One of our proverbs says, \'Remember that the Dapple\r\nflows into the Dawl.\' I have sometimes wondered, recently, whether\r\nwe have ever really understood the true meaning of that proverb.\r\nOur ancestors built the town of Lud-in-the-Mist between these two\r\nrivers, and both have brought us their tribute. The tribute of the\r\nDawl has been gold, and we have gladly accepted it. But the tribute of\r\nthe Dapple we have ever spurned. The Dapple--our placid old friend,\r\nin whose waters we learned as lads the gentle art of angling--has\r\nsilently, through the centuries, been bringing fairy fruit into\r\nDorimare ... a fact that, to my mind, at least, proves that fairy\r\nfruit is as wholesome and necessary for man as the various other gifts\r\nbrought for our welfare by our silent friends--the Dawl\'s gift of gold,\r\nthe earth\'s gift of corn, the hills\' gift of shelter and pasturage, and\r\nthe trees\' gift of grapes and apples and shade.\r\n\r\n"And if all the gifts of Life are good, perhaps, too, are all the\r\nshapes she chooses to take, and which we cannot alter. The shape she\r\nhas taken now for Dorimare is that of an invasion by our ancient foes.\r\nWhy should we not make a virtue of necessity and throw our gates wide\r\nto them as friends?"\r\n\r\nHis colleagues, at first, expressed themselves as horrified. But\r\nperhaps they, too, though unknown to themselves, had been altered by\r\nrecent events.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this was one of the crises when the strongest man\r\ninevitably finds himself at the helm. And there could be no doubt that\r\nthe strongest man in the Senate was Master Ambrose Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate rose, he addressed the terrified populace from the\r\nmarket-place, with the result that before nightfall he had quieted\r\nthe panic-stricken crowds and had persuaded the citizens, with the\r\nexception of such models of old-fashioned respectability as Ebeneezor\r\nPrim, to accept with calm passivity whatever the future might hold in\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nHis two most ardent supporters were Sebastian Thug and the disreputable\r\nBawdy Bess.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months ago what would he have said if someone had told him\r\nthe day would come when he, Ambrose Honeysuckle, would turn demagogue,\r\nand, assisted by a rough sailor and a woman of the town, would be\r\nexhorting the citizens of Lud-in-the-Mist to throw wide their gates and\r\nwelcome in the Fairies!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo, instead of repairing its walls and testing its cannon and laying\r\nin provision against a siege, Lud-in-the-Mist hoisted its flags and\r\nfestooned its windows with wreaths of Duke Aubrey\'s ivy, and flung the\r\nwest gate wide open; and a throng of silent, expectant people lined the\r\nstreets and waited.\r\n\r\nFirst came the sounds of wild sweet music, then the tramp of a myriad\r\nfeet, and then, like hosts of leaves blown on the wind, the invading\r\narmy came pouring into the town.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, Master Ambrose remembered the transfigured tapestry in\r\nthe Guildhall, and the sense they had had of noisy, gaudy, dominant\r\ndreams flooding the streets and scattering reality in their wake.\r\n\r\nBehind the battalions of mail-clad dead marched three gigantic old men,\r\nwith long white beards reaching below their girdles. Their long stiff\r\nrobes were embroidered in gold and jewels with strange emblems, and\r\nbehind them were led sumpter mules laden with coffers of wrought gold.\r\nAnd the rumour passed through the waiting crowd that these were none\r\nother than the balsam-eating priests of the sun and moon.\r\n\r\nAnd bringing up the rear on a great white charger was--Master Nathaniel\r\nChanticleer, with Ranulph riding by his side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe accounts of what took place immediately after the entry of the\r\nfairy army read more like legends than history. It would seem that the\r\ntrees broke into leaf and the masts of all the ships in the bay into\r\nblossom; that day and night the cocks crowed without ceasing; that\r\nviolets and anemones sprang up through the snow in the streets, and\r\nthat mothers embraced their dead sons, and maids their sweethearts\r\ndrowned at sea.\r\n\r\nBut one thing seems certain, and that is that the gold-wrought coffers\r\ncontained the ancient offering of fairy fruit to Dorimare. And the\r\ncoffers were of such miraculous capacity that there was enough and to\r\nspare, not only for the dessert of the Senate, but for that of every\r\nhousehold in Lud-in-the-Mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                             THE INITIATE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may, perhaps, have wondered why a man so full of human failings,\r\nand set in so unheroic a mould as Master Nathaniel Chanticleer should\r\nhave been cast for so great a role. Yet the highest spiritual destinies\r\nare not always reserved for the strongest men, nor for the most\r\nvirtuous ones.\r\n\r\nBut though he had been chosen as Duke Aubrey\'s deputy and initiated\r\ninto the Ancient Mysteries, he had not ceased to be in many ways the\r\nsame Master Nathaniel as of old--whimsical, child-like, and, often,\r\nunreasonable. Nor, I fear, did he cease to be the prey of melancholy.\r\nI doubt whether initiation ever brings happiness. It may be that the\r\nfinal secret revealed is a very bitter one ... or it may be that the\r\nfinal secret had not yet been revealed to Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, far from being set up by his new honours, he felt\r\noddly ashamed of them--it was almost as if he was for the first time\r\nrunning the gauntlet of his friends\' eyes after having been afflicted\r\nby some physical disfigurement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen things had returned again to their usual rut, Master Ambrose came\r\nto spend a quiet evening with Master Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nThey sat for some time in silence puffing at their pipes, and then\r\nMaster Ambrose said, "Tell me what your theory is about Endymion Leer,\r\nNat. He was a double-dyed villain, all right, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel did not answer at once, and then he said thoughtfully,\r\n"I suppose so. I read the report of his defence, however, and his words\r\nseemed to me to ring true. But I think there was some evil lurking in\r\nhis soul, and everything he touched was contaminated by it, even fairy\r\nfruit--even Duke Aubrey."\r\n\r\n"And that spiritual sin he accused himself of ... what do you suppose\r\nit was?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Master Nathaniel slowly, "he may have mishandled the\r\nsacred objects of the Mysteries."\r\n\r\n"What are these sacred objects, Nat?"\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel moved uneasily in his chair, and said, with an\r\nembarrassed little laugh, "Life and death, I suppose." He hated being\r\nasked about these sorts of things.\r\n\r\nMaster Ambrose sat for a few moments pondering, and then he said, "It\r\nwas curious how in all his attacks on you he defeated his own ends."\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Master Nathaniel, with much more animation than he had\r\nhitherto shown, "that was really very curious. Everything he did\r\nproduced exactly the opposite effect he had intended it should. He\r\nfeared the Chanticleers, and wanted to be rid of them, so he gets\r\nRanulph off to Fairyland, whence nobody had ever before returned. And\r\nhe manages to get me so discredited that I have to leave Lud, and he\r\nthinks me safely out of the way. But, in reality, he was only bringing\r\nabout his own downfall. I have to leave Lud, and so I go to the farm,\r\nand there I find old Gibberty\'s incriminating document. While the fact\r\nof Ranulph\'s having gone off yonder sends me after him, and that is\r\nwhy, I suppose, I come back as Duke Aubrey\'s deputy," and again he gave\r\nan embarrassed laugh; and then added dreamily, "It is useless to try\r\nand circumvent the Duke."\r\n\r\n"He who rides the wind needs must go where his steed carries him,"\r\nquoted Master Ambrose.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel smiled, and for some minutes they puffed at their\r\npipes in silence.\r\n\r\nThen Master Nathaniel gave a reminiscent chuckle: "Those were queer\r\nmonths that we lived through, Ambrose!" he cried. "All of us, that\'s\r\nto say those of us who had parts to play, seemed to be living each\r\nothers\' dreams or dreaming each others\' lives, whichever way you choose\r\nto put it, and the most incongruous things began to rhyme--apples\r\nand bleeding corpses and trees and ghosts. Yes, all our dreams got\r\nentangled. Leer makes a speech about men and trees, and I find the\r\nsolution of the situation under a herm, which is half a man and half\r\na tree, and you see the juice of fairy fruit and think that it is the\r\ndead bleeding--and so on. Yes, my adventures went on getting more and\r\nmore like a dream till ... the climax," and he paused abruptly.\r\n\r\nA long silence followed, broken at last by Master Ambrose. "Well, Nat,"\r\nhe said, "I think I\'ve had a lesson in humility. I used to have as good\r\nan opinion of myself as most men, I think, but now I\'ve learned that\r\nI\'m a very ordinary sort of fellow, made of very inferior clay to you\r\nand my Moonlove--all the things that you know at first hand and I can\r\nonly take on faith."\r\n\r\n"Suppose, Ambrose, that what we know at first hand is only this--that\r\nthere is nothing to know?" said Master Nathaniel a little sadly. Then\r\nhe sank into a brown study, and Master Ambrose, thinking he wanted to\r\nbe alone, stole quietly from the room.\r\n\r\nMaster Nathaniel sat gazing moodily into the fire; and his pipe went\r\nout without his noticing it. Then the door opened softly, and someone\r\nstole in and stood behind his chair. It was Dame Marigold. All she said\r\nwas, "Funny old Nat!" but her voice had a husky tenderness. And then\r\nshe knelt down beside him and took him into her soft warm arms. And a\r\nnew hope was borne in upon Master Nathaniel that someday he would hear\r\nthe Note again, and all would be clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI should like to conclude with a few words as to the fate of the\r\nvarious people who have appeared in these pages.\r\n\r\nHazel Gibberty married Sebastian Thug--and an excellent husband he made\r\nher. He gave up the sea and settled on his wife\'s farm. Mistress Ivy\r\nPeppercorn came and lived with them and every summer they had a visit\r\nfrom Master Nathaniel and Ranulph. Bawdy Bess left Lud at the time of\r\nSebastian\'s marriage--out of pique, said the malicious.\r\n\r\nLuke Hempen entered the Lud Yeomanry, where he did so well that when\r\nMumchance retired he was elected Captain in his place.\r\n\r\nHempie lived to a ripe old age--long enough to tell her stories to\r\nRanulph\'s children; nor had she any scruples about telling them her\r\nviews on "neighbourliness." And when she died, as a tribute to her\r\nlong and loving service, she was buried in the family chapel of the\r\nChanticleers.\r\n\r\nMother Tibbs, after taking a conspicuous part in the wild revels which\r\nfollowed on the arrival of the fairy army, vanished for ever from\r\nDorimare. Nor did anyone ever again see Portunus. But, from time to\r\ntime, a wild red-haired youth would arrive uninvited, and having turned\r\neverything topsy-turvy with his pranks, would rush from the house,\r\nshouting "Ho! Ho! Hoh!"\r\n\r\nBy degrees the Crabapple Blossoms recovered their spirits. But they\r\ncertainly did not grow up into the sort of young ladies their mothers\r\nhad imagined they would when they first sent them to Miss Primrose\r\nCrabapple\'s Academy. They were never stinted of fairy fruit, for the\r\nDapple continued to bring its tribute to Dorimare, adding thereby\r\nconsiderably to the wealth of the country. For, thanks to the sound\r\npractical sense of Master Ambrose, a new industry was started--that\r\nof candying fairy fruit, and exporting it to all the countries with\r\nwhich they trafficked, in pretty fancy boxes, the painted lids of which\r\nshowed that art was creeping back to Dorimare.\r\n\r\nAs for Ranulph, when he grew up he wrote the loveliest songs that had\r\nbeen heard since the days of Duke Aubrey--songs that crossed the sea\r\nand were sung by lonely fishermen in the far North, and by indigo\r\nmothers crooning to their babies by the doors of their huts in the\r\nCinnamon Isles.\r\n\r\nDame Marigold continued to smile, and to nibble marzipan with her\r\ncronies. But she used sometimes sadly to wonder whether Master\r\nNathaniel had ever really come back from beyond the Debatable Hills;\r\nsometimes, but not always.\r\n\r\nAnd Master Nathaniel himself? Whether he ever heard the Note again\r\nI cannot say. But in time he went, either to reap the fields of\r\ngillyflowers, or to moulder in the Fields of Grammary.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
