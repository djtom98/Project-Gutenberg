Humiliating as it is to\r\nmake the confession, it is undeniably true. "Men and Dress are all\r\nwomen think about," cry the lords of creation in their unbounded\r\nvanity. And again, we must submit--and agree--to the truth of the\r\naccusation; at any rate, in nine cases out of ten. Fortunately I am a\r\ntenth case; at least, I consider myself so. I don\'t dispute the\r\n"dress" imputation. I am very fond of dress. Nearly as fond of it as\r\nthe twenty-year old youth, and saying that, I allow a good deal. But\r\nvery few of my thoughts are given to the creature "man"! I do not\r\nthink him worth it. As my old nurse used to say, "I never \'ad no\r\nopinion of the sex!"\r\n\r\nDo not conclude, however, that because of my statement that I am a\r\ndisappointed, soured old maid, for I am nothing of the sort. I am on\r\nthe right side of twenty-five, and I have never been crossed in love;\r\nindeed, I have never even experienced the tender passion, and only\r\nwrite from my observations of other people; thus taking a perfectly\r\nneutral ground in speaking of it at all.\r\n\r\nOne never hears that Adam fell in love with Eve, or that Eve was\r\npassionately attached to Adam. But then, poor things, they had so\r\nlittle choice--it was either that or nothing. Besides, there was no\r\nopposition to the match, so it was bound to be rather a tame affair.\r\nFor my part, I pity Eve, for Adam was, I think, the very meanest of\r\nmen. When he was turned out of the garden, what a wretch he must have\r\nfelt himself! and how he must have taunted his poor wife! Weak men are\r\nalways bullies.\r\n\r\nBut "_revenons a nos moutons_," I am wondering who was the first\r\nperson to fall in love! Cain _might_ have done so with his mysterious\r\nwife; history does not say. But certainly there is always some\r\nattraction in mystery, so such a thing is possible. I wonder whence\r\nthat extraordinary woman sprang!\r\n\r\nNeither do we hear much of Noah\'s domestic experiences, but I should\r\nconclude on the whole that they were not happy. No man could be\r\nendured for forty days shut up in the house, no business to go to,\r\nnothing to do, always hanging about, his idle hands at some mischief\r\nor other, and last, but not least, a diabolical temper, displayed at\r\nevery turn! Why, I cannot endure one for a week! My only wonder is\r\nthat the female population of the Ark did not rise up in a body and\r\nconsign their lords and masters to the floods.\r\n\r\nPoor men, they deserve a little of our pity too, perhaps; for if Mrs.\r\nNoah and her daughters-in-law at all resembled their effigies in the\r\nNoah\'s Arks of the present day, they were women to be avoided, _I_\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nSo that, after all, it must have been Jacob who set such a very\r\nfoolish example; because we could not count Isaac, his being so\r\nextraordinary and isolated a case, when he fell in love with his own\r\nwife!\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we owe Jacob a great many grudges. He was the\r\ninventor of the tender passion, and since his time people have begun\r\nto follow his example long before they come to years of discretion,\r\nsimply because their parents did so before them, and they think they\r\nare not grown up, that they are not men, unless they have some love\r\naffair on hand.\r\n\r\nSome get married at once, some wait a long time, and some do not marry\r\nat all. These last are, I think, generally the happiest, for this\r\nso-called love lasts for only a very short time, and neither husband\r\nnor wife are long before they console themselves with someone else\'s\r\naffection to make up for what is wanting on the part of the other.\r\n\r\nOf course I am speaking generally. As far as I can see, the majority\r\nact thus, though I am glad to say that many and various are the\r\nexceptions. It was only the other day I came across our washerwoman\r\nand asked her how she and her husband got on together. He used to be a\r\ndrunkard, and used her cruelly, but two years ago he took the pledge,\r\nand, what is more, he kept it. "Lor\', mum," she exclaimed fervently,\r\n"we draws nearer every day!" I am afraid not many husbands and wives\r\ncould say the same.\r\n\r\nPeople are so anxious to marry too. I cannot understand them, men\r\nespecially. They have their clubs, they are entirely independent, and\r\ncan go home as late as they please without being questioned as to\r\ntheir whereabouts. And yet, as soon as they can, they saddle\r\nthemselves with a wife, who requires at least half the money--they\r\nhave never found sufficient for themselves alone--besides a great deal\r\nof looking after!\r\n\r\nWomen, on the contrary, are different. They have to make some\r\nprovision for the future, so to speak. How do you like it, oh men! the\r\nidea that you, with your handsome personages and fascinating ways, are\r\nused only as a kind of insurance office? This is the case very often,\r\nhowever, though you may not know it!\r\n\r\nYet others pursue the god Hymen merely for the sake of being married.\r\nAs soon as they leave the school-room, sometimes before, they begin\r\ntheir search for a husband, and look out for him in the person of\r\nevery man they meet. No matter who it is so long as they are married\r\nbefore So-and-So, and can triumph over all their friends.\r\n\r\nIt must be said for men that they are falling off in the marrying\r\nline. This is not nearly such a proposing generation as the last. Then\r\nthey married much younger and seemed to propose after a few days\'\r\nacquaintance. No, this is a more cautious age altogether. Men look\r\nround carefully before they make their choice. They sample it well,\r\nthey watch it in the home circle, they watch it abroad, they watch it\r\nwith other men, and finally come to the conclusion that it is worthy\r\nto be allied to their noble selves, or they don\'t!\r\n\r\nAnother thing. Men of the present day are so direfully afraid of a\r\nrefusal! So fearful are they, that rather than risk one, they give up\r\nmany chances of happiness.\r\n\r\nThey expect that a girl should show her feeling toward them, before\r\nthey come to the point. But you must remember that girls also have to\r\nbe cautious, and a few--I acknowledge it is only a few--would rather\r\ndie than show they cared for a man who after all might only "love and\r\nride away."\r\n\r\nNot that I altogether blame man in this respect. I always admire\r\npride, and am afraid I should not care for a refusal myself. I am\r\nintolerant of it even in the smallest matters!\r\n\r\nIt is curious how men run in grooves. The same style of man nearly\r\nalways marries the opposite type of girl. I mean that the\r\nintellectual, the clever, invariably choose the insipid brainless\r\ngirl. Pretty, she may be, but it is in a doll-like way, with not a\r\nthought above her household. You would have imagined that such men\r\nwould require some help-meet, in the fullest sense of the word; with a\r\nbrain almost as quick as their own. But such a choice occurs very\r\nseldom.\r\n\r\nAgain, why is it that little men always select the very tallest women\r\nthey can find? You would think that a man would hesitate to show off\r\nhis meagre inches to such bad advantage. But these pigmies appear to\r\nenjoy the contrast. It is evidently quantity they admire, not quality.\r\n\r\nI daresay a good deal of what I have written sounds very cynical, but\r\nperhaps my experience has been unfortunate, therefore you must forgive\r\nme: certainly it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between\r\nthe real thing and its successful counterpart.\r\n\r\nParents are greatly at fault in the issues of the matrimonial market.\r\nAfter all these centuries of experience you would give them credit for\r\nmore tact than they possess. Any match they do not desire, they oppose\r\nat once, and thereby set alight all the contradictory elements in your\r\nnature. If Laban had been less obstinate, and had consented to an\r\nalliance between Jacob and Rachel from the first, provided Leah was\r\nleft behind to look after him, the latter would immediately have been\r\nendowed with attractions innumerable to Jacob, tender eyes and all!\r\n\r\nNowhere is there such a fertile soil for love as opposition!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if parents wish to encourage a match, young people\r\nare thrown together as much as possible. However big the gathering,\r\nyou are somehow always paired off with the eligible parti until you\r\ngrow to loathe the man, and would sooner become an "old maid" than\r\nmarry him.\r\n\r\nParents have a bad time altogether I am afraid. Their nice little\r\nplans are so nearly always upset by their ungrateful children, and\r\nthen they have to be continually looking after their brood. I knew one\r\nmother who used to take her daughters on the pier and lose sight of\r\nthem at once, as they paired off with their he-acquaintances. Do what\r\nshe would she could not find them again, so many were the nooks and\r\ncrannies near at hand. Finally she had recourse to the Camera Obscura,\r\nand, with the help of the views set before her there, she found the\r\nmissing girls! "We never can escape her now," they told me in mournful\r\ntones, after her fatal discovery.\r\n\r\nGirls are degenerating sadly, it is said. They are getting too\r\nmasculine, too independent, too different from man\'s ideal--the modest\r\nlittle maid who sits at home and mends her husband\'s socks.\r\n\r\nI do not dispute the fact. They _are_ degenerating. Neither, though I\r\ndislike the ideal specimen, and have a contempt for her, do I stand up\r\nfor the other extreme. I have a horror of fast masculine girls, and\r\nagree with all that is said against them. Nevertheless, I do not\r\nconsider men have any right to complain, as they are the chief cause\r\nof the deterioration of our sex.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that a girl thinks more of a man\'s opinion than that of\r\nanyone else. If he applauds, then she is satisfied. She does not\r\nconsider it ignominy to be termed "a jolly good fellow!" She gets\r\npraise, and in a way admiration, when she caps his good stories,\r\nsmokes, and drinks brandies and sodas. Unfortunately, she does not\r\nhear herself discussed when he is alone with his friends, or perhaps\r\nshe would be more cautious in her manners and conversation for the\r\nfuture, for this is not the kind of girl who is\r\n\r\n    "Rich in the grace all women desire,\r\n    Strong in the power that all men adore."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON BILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLS! BILLS! BILLS! Detestable sound! Obnoxious word! Why were such\r\nthings ever invented? Why are they sent to destroy our peace of mind?\r\n\r\nThey always come, too, when you are expecting some interesting letter.\r\nYou hurry to meet the postman, you get impatient at the length of time\r\nhe takes to separate his packets (I sometimes think these men find\r\npleasure in tantalizing you, and keep you waiting on purpose), and\r\nwhen he at last presents you with your long-expected missive, behold,\r\nit turns to dust and ashes in your hand--metaphorically speaking, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity such a metamorphosis does not occur in reality; for the\r\nwretched oblong envelope, with the sprawly, flourishy writing, so\r\nunmistakably suggests a bill, that you--well, I do not know what\r\n_you_ do on such an occasion; _my_ letter, which I have been so\r\nanxious to obtain, is flung to the other side of the room.\r\n\r\nHow is it that bills mount up so quickly? You buy a little ribbon, a\r\nfew pairs of gloves, some handkerchiefs--mere items in fact, and yet\r\nwhen quarter day comes round you are presented with a bill a yard\r\nlong, which as your next instalment of money is fully mortgaged, is\r\ncalculated to fill you with anything but extreme joy.\r\n\r\nWhy are the paths leading to destruction always so much easier of\r\naccess than any other? It takes so much less time to run up a bill, it\r\nis so much simpler to say, "Will you please enter it to my account?"\r\nthan to pay your money down. First the bill has to be added up, and,\r\nstrange as it may seem, these shop people appear to take _hours_ over\r\na simple addition sum. "Eight and elevenpence halfpenny if you please,\r\nma\'am." Of course you have not enough silver, and so are obliged to\r\nwait for change. Then someone has to be found to sign. Altogether it\r\ntakes quite five minutes longer paying ready money; and think, how\r\nfive minutes after each purchase would mount up in a day\'s shopping!\r\nI should say that, on an average you might call it two important hours\r\nregularly thrown away. "And a good job, too," perhaps our fathers,\r\nhusbands, and brothers would say. But, then, you see, they are\r\nPhilistines and do not understand.\r\n\r\nBut though we suffer somewhat at the hands of these shop people, I\r\nthink in their turn they have to endure a great deal more from their\r\ncustomers. I have seen old ladies order nearly the whole shop out,\r\nturn over the articles, and having entirely exhausted the patience of\r\ntheir victims, say, "Yes--all very pretty--but I don\'t think I will\r\nbuy any to-day, thank you," and they move off to other counters to\r\nenact the same scene over again. Selfish old things!\r\n\r\nI was dreadfully hard up a short time ago, and of course my bills were\r\nten times as big as usual. I had no money coming in, and could not\r\nconceive how I was to meet my debts.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing, when you come to try it, how few paths there are\r\nopen for poverty-stricken ladies to make a little money, especially\r\nwhen your object is to keep your difficulties a secret from your\r\nmankind. I tried every imaginable way without success. What is the\r\ngood of having an expensive education, of being taught French and\r\nGerman--neither of which languages, by the way, when brought to the\r\ntest, a girl can ever talk, or at any rate so as to be understood.\r\nWhat is the good of it all, I say, when you want to turn your hand to\r\nmaking a little money? I felt quite angry the other day when, our cook\r\nbeing ill, we had a woman in to take her place. Fifteen shillings a\r\nweek she made! She, who had had little or nothing spent on her\r\neducation, could yet make more shillings in a week than I could pence!\r\nI began to wish I had been brought up as a scullery maid.\r\n\r\nI can paint rather well, but what are the advantages of art compared\r\nto those of cookery? Many and many a shop I went into, carrying\r\nspecimens of my talent, and asking the owners if they would employ me\r\nto decorate their tambourines, bellows, &c. But no, they all had their\r\nown especial artists, and were quite suited. It is such a dreadfully\r\nhumiliating business. At the first place I could have slain the man\r\nfor his impertinence in declining, and I left the shop with a haughty\r\nmien and my head in the air. But I grew accustomed to it in time, and\r\neven used to try a little persuasion, which, however, proved of no\r\navail. One man offered to exhibit my wares (I felt quite like a\r\npeddler going his rounds), and through him I sold two tambourines.\r\nThen who so proud as I? though my profits only came to a few\r\nshillings. However small, the first taste of success is always\r\nexhilarating, though indeed my confidence did not last long, for this\r\nwas my first and last experience of money-making in the painting line.\r\n\r\nI used to search the sale and exchange columns of the papers, and\r\nfound once that someone wanted music transposed. I wrote directly\r\noffering my services, and charging a shilling per piece or song. For a\r\nwonder I was successful, for the person answered, asking for a\r\nspecimen of my skill, which she was pleased to say would do very well.\r\n\r\nHow her letters used to amuse me! She must have been a rather\r\nincapable singing mistress I think. Her letters though properly spelt\r\nwere written in an uneducated hand, and she addressed me as if I were\r\na servant. She used to give me very little time in which to transpose\r\nher songs, and insisted on their being finished when she wanted them.\r\nSometimes I was quite tired out, for copying music is not a thing to\r\nbe done in a hurry.\r\n\r\nSomehow, our negotiations did not last long. Whether I grew careless,\r\nor she found others to do the work cheaper, I do not know, but she\r\nsuddenly withdrew her custom, and I have never heard from her since.\r\n\r\nMy next venture was tale writing. Who has not tried this most\r\nunsatisfactory method? It is a tremendously anxious time when your\r\nfirst effort is sent out. What a lot of money you expect to obtain for\r\nit! You do not intend to be unprepared, so you spend every penny in\r\nyour mind beforehand. Then there is the honor and glory of it! You\r\nwill hear everyone talking of the cleverly written tale and wondering\r\nwho is the gifted author!\r\n\r\nWhat made me more hopeful was the possession of a cousin, who was very\r\nsuccessful in this line. Indeed, she has reached the three-volume\r\nstage by now, and is beginning to be quite well known. I have lost my\r\ninterest in her, however, since she took me and my family off in one\r\nof her books. It is such an easy thing to do. You only have to find\r\nout a person\'s peculiarities--and everyone has a peculiarity!--and\r\noverdraw them a little. My sisters and I, I remember, figured as\r\nthree brainless, fast girls, which would only have amused us had she\r\nleft the rest of the family alone. It is a foolish thing to do, for\r\nbesides nearly always giving offence it is not by any means an\r\nevidence of good taste.\r\n\r\nIt is much more difficult to write a tale than some people think; you\r\nget in such hopeless tangles sometimes. People you kill off in the\r\nfirst chapter, you sadly need in the last. Then, when you are\r\nfinishing up, there are so many people to get rid of, that you are\r\nobliged to dispatch them in a bunch with an explosion, or something\r\nequally probable--three or four strangers as a rule, who have never\r\nseen each other before, but who considerately assemble in one place to\r\nmeet their doom. Then the last pages will never fit in with the first.\r\nYour meek but lovely heroine at the beginning has been transformed\r\ninto a beautiful vixen as you near the end, and is quite\r\nunrecognizable. The worst parts of all are the sensational ones. You\r\nthink you have worked your hero up to a pitch of fiery eloquence,\r\nwhile his _fiancee_ is dying in agony close by, and when you\r\ncomplacently turn to read over the passage, you find his words imply\r\nno more sorrow than they would at the death of a relative from whom he\r\nhad expectations, or--a mother-in-law!\r\n\r\nIt is rather a difficult matter in a large family to keep your actions\r\na secret. Obtuse as most men are, with things going on right under\r\ntheir eyes, it is not easy to baffle them when once their curiosity is\r\nroused. And yet curiosity is always imputed exclusively to women!\r\nThough Eve _was_ the first to taste the apple, Adam had no intention\r\nof being behindhand. I know a man who always manages to get down to\r\nbreakfast five minutes before the rest of his family, for the purpose\r\nof examining the correspondence all round.\r\n\r\nFortunately I managed to escape from these inquisitive eyes, for I met\r\nthe postman myself when he brought back my first tale. It was returned\r\nwith the Editor\'s "compliments and thanks," coupled with the regret\r\nthat he could not make use of my contribution.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know that I ever felt such keen disappointment as when that\r\ntale came back from its first visit. I had hoped so much from it, and\r\nhad been so confident of its success. It depressed me for some time,\r\nand it was long before I ventured upon anything in the literary way\r\nagain. But habit is second nature, they say, so after that and other\r\ntales had been the round of all the magazines and returned to their\r\nancestral home, decidedly the worse for their outings (change of air\r\nevidently does not agree with MSS.), they affected me no more than the\r\nreceipt of a tradesman\'s circular. In fact I grew quite to welcome\r\nthem as old friends, and no one would have been more astonished than I\r\nhad they been converted into L s. d.\r\n\r\nApparently I am not cut out for literary work. I have not sufficient\r\nimagination, nor am I sceptical enough for this fanciful and\r\nscientific age. The world only cares for impossible adventures and\r\nmagic stories, or stories which undermine their religion or upset it\r\naltogether, and I am not clever enough for this.\r\n\r\nOf course, in my pecuniary need I did not neglect to employ a\r\n"chancellor of the exchequer," as Miss. Mathers calls her; a "wardrobe\r\nkeeper," as she terms herself. Indeed, I employed two or three, and so\r\nhad plenty of opportunities of observing the type.\r\n\r\nThese women certainly vary in the way they carry on business, but very\r\nrarely do they vary in appearance. For the fattest, ugliest, oiliest\r\nold creatures to be found anywhere, commend me to a Chancellor! I\r\npause in astonishment sometimes, and wonder how they have the strength\r\nto carry so much flesh about with them.\r\n\r\nThe first one I engaged possessed a complexion of a glowing yellow,\r\nlike unto the petals of an alamander. She carried on the business in a\r\ntoo independent way altogether. She would take up my garments, look\r\nthem over with a contemptuous sniff (what eloquence there is in a\r\nsniff!), and then begin to talk of the "ilegant costoomes she \'ad \'ad\r\nlately of Lady ----, of the \'ansome silks and furs purchased from the\r\nCountess of ----," &c. It was cunningly and knowingly done.\r\nImmediately, as was intended, my productions began to lose value in my\r\neyes, in contrast to her gorgeous descriptions. Finally she would\r\nstate her price, and by no art or persuasion would she give way a\r\npenny afterwards.\r\n\r\nI believe she was given to fits. Anyhow she fell very ill once when\r\nshe came, and had to be given brandy to support her. I was afraid she\r\nwas going to die in the house, which would have been exceedingly\r\nunpleasant, for it is a heinous breach of gentility to be found mixed\r\nup in any such transactions. We are so foolish, we have such little\r\nminds, we try to hide our doings from our neighbors, who are all going\r\nthrough the same experiences, and are equally desirous of concealing\r\nthem from us. If all our screens were taken away what a comedy of\r\nerrors would be disclosed. How surprised we should be to see everyone\r\ncommitting follies of which we have been so ashamed and so anxious to\r\nhide from the eyes of all!\r\n\r\nAfter all the brandy had a most beneficial effect. I think it must\r\nhave flown to her head; for never before had she given such large\r\namounts. I was quite sorry to find her so well at her next advent. Her\r\nsniff was even more eloquent, and her prices had returned to their\r\noriginal low level. I regret now that I did not again try the brandy.\r\n\r\nAnother woman I employed was even uglier than the first. She was so\r\nwholesomely ugly. A great red full moon represented her countenance,\r\nradiant with the color of the Eiffel Tower. She was altogether a more\r\nsatisfactory chancellor than the other. She always insisted on your\r\nstating your own price to begin with. "Well, what d\'yer think yerself,\r\nmum?" was her invariable ejaculation, and then, hearing your reply,\r\nwould break in on whatever you said by "It ain\'t worth more than\r\n_\'arf_ that to me, mum," in the most aggrieved voice. I became used to\r\nher in time, and knowing she would halve whatever I said, used to\r\ndemand double the worth of the thing. "What d\'yer think yerself, mum?"\r\nYou grow so tired of your opinion being thus asked. I wonder how many\r\ntimes she says it in a day! It is a cautious way of going about it, at\r\nany rate. If that woman ever appeared in a police court on a charge of\r\ndishonesty, and the magistrate asked her what she had to say to the\r\ncharge, the answer would undoubtedly be, "Well, what d\'yer think\r\nyerself, sir?"\r\n\r\nSome of those bills are still unpaid. Quarter day is coming round\r\nagain, so I expect there will be some more soon. Alas! I am an unlucky\r\nbeing, born under an unlucky star.\r\n\r\nYou may think it a strange notion, but I attribute all my ill-luck to\r\nspiders:\r\n\r\n    "If you wish to live and thrive,\r\n    Let a spider run alive."\r\n\r\nI am not superstitious as a rule, but I cannot help thinking that my\r\nwholesale massacre of this obnoxious insect has something to do with\r\nmy misfortunes by way of retribution.\r\n\r\nI hate spiders! Nearly everybody has a pet aversion of some sort. I\r\nhave heard people shriek at the sight of a caterpillar, and turn pale\r\nin the neighborhood of a toad. My great antipathy is a spider! Not\r\nthat I object to its treatment of flies--nasty little worries, they\r\ndeserve everything that happens to them. But it is the _appearance_ of\r\na spider that is so against it. There is a shifty expression about the\r\neye, and such a leer on the upper lip. Money spinners are not so\r\nobjectionable. I can tolerate them. It is the big, almost tarantulas,\r\nfrom which I flee. Those creatures which start up suddenly, and run\r\nacross the room close by where you are sitting; creatures so large\r\nthat you can almost hear their footsteps as they pass.\r\n\r\nA man told me once he had found a spider in his room of such enormous\r\ndimensions that he had to open the door in order that it might get\r\nout!\r\n\r\nOverdrawn, you say? Well, it sounds a little improbable certainly; not\r\nso much on account of the unusual size of the spider as for the\r\nextraordinary consideration on the part of the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nON POLITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you don\'t think me competent to talk about politics? "What do\r\nwomen know about such things?" asks the superior masculine mind.\r\n\r\nWell, they don\'t know so much as men, I admit, and I earnestly hope\r\nthey never will. A woman who is infected with politics is a positive\r\npest, and should be removed at once. If I do not know anything about\r\nthem, at any rate I ought to, as I have been brought up in a raging\r\nTory household, and so have been steeped in them from my youth up.\r\n\r\nThere is such a sameness in politicians. Whatever their opinions,\r\ntheir language and feelings are all one. They are only directed at\r\ndifferent people. While one man is gloating over a Conservative\r\nvictory you hear a mutter from the Radical to the effect that "That\r\n_brute_ has got in for ----" Poor man, why, because he thinks\r\ndifferently to you, should he be a brute? But just the same words are\r\nspoken if the positions be reversed. It is only the mouths that change\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI am afraid my views incline toward the Tory side. I cannot help it, I\r\nwas bought over long ago. You _must_ feel an interest as to the\r\nsuccessful candidate when the result means either a tip all round or a\r\nthundery atmosphere for the rest of the day. Men take an adverse poll\r\nas a personal affront and vent their feelings on their families. The\r\ntipping was quite an understood thing when I was younger, now it is\r\ngiven up, and joy is shown in a less substantial way, I regret to say.\r\nUnfortunately the thunder storms are not events of the past as well.\r\n\r\nPoliticians have such a narrow way of looking at things. The other\r\nside can do nothing right while they themselves are absolutely\r\nfaultless! If a Tory wishes to confer an opprobrious epithet on a\r\nperson he calls him a Radical, and _vice versa_; the opposite faction\r\nis capable of any enormity? This reminds me of the old Scotchman who\r\non being asked his opinion of a man who had first murdered and then\r\nmutilated his victim, answered in a shocked voice, "What do I think?\r\nWell, I think that a maun who\'d do all that would whistle on the\r\nSawbuths!" "Such a man must be a Home Ruler," my father would have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIn having a guest with opposite views at your dinner table, what\r\nagonies do you not suffer? I have gone through those dreadful meals\r\ntrembling at every word that drops from the man\'s lips. Try as you\r\nmay, turn the conversation how you will, there is sure to be some\r\nallusion, some statement that sets on fire all the host\'s enthusiasm,\r\nand it does not take long before the poor guest is entirely\r\nannihilated and subdued--unless indeed he is as hot on his side as the\r\nother is on his; then indeed all we can do is to sit and hear it out.\r\nTo attempt to stem such a torrent would be the act of a lunatic. We\r\nonly feel thankful that "pistols for two and coffee for one" is a\r\nthing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe General Elections are dreadful times; nothing but canvassing goes\r\non night after night for weeks beforehand. Conversation is entirely\r\nrestricted to the coming event--if you mention a word about anything\r\napart from it, you are considered absolutely profane, and are treated\r\nas a pariah for the next few days.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, I admit, and the election day itself is positively\r\nexciting. You cannot help catching the malady at times. I remember\r\nonce, when I was very little, and walking out with my governess,\r\ntearing down a Liberal bill, in spite of all she said to the contrary.\r\nTrue, it was on what she considered her own side, though I don\'t think\r\nshe knew enough to distinguish between the two; still her real\r\nannoyance was occasioned more by the look of the thing. That a pupil\r\nof hers should act in such a plebeian way, and in so public a place,\r\ncertainly must have been somewhat provoking? Anyhow, she gave me a bad\r\nmark for disobedience, which affected me but little, as when I related\r\nthe story to my father later on he rewarded me with a shilling for my\r\nprowess! Electioneering, you see, is not good for the morals!\r\n\r\nHow tired you get, too, of seeing the names of would-be members stuck\r\nup all over the place. My brothers used to follow the Liberal\r\nbill-sticker round, and as soon as he had turned his back pull the\r\nplacards down, or cover them up with their own. This was found out at\r\nlast, and the foe grew more cautious.\r\n\r\nThen the extravagant promises made by the candidates, which they never\r\nreally intend to fulfil, and could not if they wished. It is like the\r\nman in Church who, while singing--\r\n\r\n    "Were the whole realm of nature mine,\r\n    That were an offering far too small,"\r\n\r\nwas rubbing his finger along the rim of a threepenny bit to make sure\r\nit was not a fourpenny!\r\n\r\nOn election days all mankind goes mad. Their excitement is so great\r\nthat they would scarcely know it did they forego their dinner. And\r\nthis, with men, proves an absorbing interest in the matter. Anything\r\nplaced above dinner, in their opinion, must be important indeed.\r\n\r\nThere is such a polite element abroad on polling day. Men are so\r\nrespectful and hurl such affectionate terms at one another. Even the\r\ndogs are upset, and strut about in quite a different manner than on\r\nordinary days, so puffed out with vanity are they, on account of their\r\ndecorations. The members\' wives and their friends are all taking part\r\nin the scene too, bringing voters along in their carriages, and\r\nshaking hands with everybody indiscriminately. I heard an old navvy\r\nprotesting once that "Lady ---- never troubled to shake \'ands with him\r\nany other time, but was generally that \'orty she\'d step over you as\r\nsoon as look at you."\r\n\r\nPoor old men are dragged out _nolens volens_ to add their mite to the\r\npublic voice, and are sometimes so aged that they scarcely know what\r\ntheir opinions are. I hope I shall not live to be very old. It is a\r\nterrible thing when you make such a prolonged stay on this earth that\r\nyou have to be helped off it.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious too, how exceedingly disobliging old people are. I\r\nknow a family who have never worn anything brighter than grey for\r\nyears. "In case we have to go into mourning soon--our poor old aunt,\r\nyou know. It\'s so very sad!" and they squeeze a tear out from\r\nsomewhere, but whether on account of their relative\'s illness, or her\r\nprolonged life, is open to opinion. The old lady is flourishing still,\r\nand the family is as soberly clothed as ever. When she has been dead\r\na few months what rainbows they will become, to make up for lost time!\r\n\r\n"A disappointing man," I have heard a dutiful nephew term his uncle.\r\nTrue, he (the uncle, I mean) is ninety-four, and therefore old enough\r\nto know better than to rally so many times. But after all, he does\r\nnothing, runs into no danger, is tended as carefully as a new-born\r\nbaby; I should not at all wonder if he still continued "disappointing"\r\nand took a new lease of life for seven years. But I am digressing, and\r\nmust return to politics.\r\n\r\nI went to a Primrose meeting once and the experience was not so happy\r\nas to make me wish to try it again.\r\n\r\nIt amused me, certainly. The conclusion I eventually arrived at, when\r\nI left, was that the chief element in the Primrose League was\r\ngratitude! This virtue seemed to be the point round which all the\r\nspeakers rallied.\r\n\r\nFirst the secretary rose, ran off a quantity of statistics, as to what\r\nhad been done by the great League, what it was going to do, and how\r\nmany converts had been induced to join, which was exceedingly\r\nuninteresting, I think, but which elicited loud applause from the rest\r\nof the audience. Then some resolution was passed, at which if you\r\nagreed you were begged "to signify the same in the usual way." After\r\nwhich those who thought differently were asked to show their feelings\r\nin the same fashion. I held my hand up here, but I suppose the ruling\r\ncouncillor did not expect any opposition, for he never even looked\r\nround to see, but gabbled off by rote, "On the contrary? carried\r\nunanimously!" and my amiable attempt at running counter to the rest\r\nwas not even noticed!\r\n\r\nThen the ruling councillor gave way to Mr. ---- (here a sickly smile\r\nwas directed at the great man), who had so very kindly come to speak\r\nto us this evening, who would, he felt sure, quite enchant us with\r\nhis--er--great eloquence (another leer to his right).\r\n\r\nThe great man then came forward, and with a superior smile on his\r\ncountenance waited until the applause which greeted his entrance had\r\nceased, and then began. He commenced somewhat softly, detailing all\r\nthe advantages of the Primrose League: what it had done for England,\r\nthe fear it arouses in the heart of the Liberal faction, how it will\r\nraise the country to a summit it never before has reached! No! and\r\nnever would have reached had it not been for this flourishing, this\r\npowerful League! &c., &c., &c. His voice gradually grew louder and\r\nlouder until, with beating his hands on the table, stamping violently\r\nover the sins of the Radicals, and perspiring vehemently in the\r\neffort, he presented anything but a pleasing spectacle.\r\n\r\nOf course animation like this brought down the house. The applause\r\nnearly deafened me, and I was quite glad when he drew near the end of\r\nhis most tedious speech. He concluded by calming down very suddenly,\r\nreturned to his original tones, and thanking his audience for his\r\nexceedingly kind reception, retired to his seat looking, as Mr.\r\nMantalini would say, a "dem\'d damp, moist, unpleasant body."\r\n\r\nThen up rose the ruling councillor, and called us all to pass a vote\r\nof thanks to the "gifted orator." Someone seconded it, and the great\r\nman came forward again to thank us for thanking him. A sort of "So\r\nglad, I\'m glad, you\'re glad" business, it seemed to me.\r\n\r\nThen the ladies were thanked for being present: "Such great aids, and\r\nsuch an _important_ element in the League," with a snigger, and what\r\nhe confidently hoped was a fascinating smile, but which made him\r\nresemble a very placid cow with the corners of its mouth turned up.\r\nSuch a mouth, too! The poor man could have whispered in his own ear\r\nhad he wished. Then someone returned thanks for the ladies. The ruling\r\ncouncillor was thanked, and thanked his thankers back again, and after\r\na few more people had exhibited their great faculty for gratitude the\r\nmeeting broke up--the only moment at which I felt inclined to applaud.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to disparage my own "side" by the foregoing remarks, not\r\ncaring in any way to emulate Balaam. It is not only the members of the\r\nPrimrose League who are so anxious to praise each other. It is the\r\ncase at nearly every meeting you go to. It is a weakness of human\r\nnature. We know that if we laud our friend he will sing an eulogy on\r\nus the next minute, so it is only natural we should do it, after all.\r\n\r\n    "The fault is not in our stars,\r\n    But in ourselves, that we are underlings."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON AFTERNOON TEA.\r\n\r\n    "The Muses\' friend, Tea, does our fancy aid,\r\n    Repress the vapors which the head invade,\r\n    And keeps the palace of the soul serene."\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I do love tea! I don\'t deny it, it is as necessary to me as\r\nsmoking is to men.\r\n\r\nI have heard a lady accused by her doctor of being a "tea-drunkard"!\r\n"Tea picks you up for a little time," he said, "and you feel a great\r\ndeal better after you have had a cup. But it is a stimulant, the\r\neffect of which does not last very long, and all the while it is\r\nruining your nerves and constitution. I daresay it is difficult to\r\ngive up--the poor man finds the same with his spirits. You are no\r\nbetter than he!"\r\n\r\nIt is rather a come down, is it not? Somehow, when you are drinking\r\ntea, you feel so very temperate. Well, at least, the above reflection\r\nmakes you sympathize with the inebriates, if it does nothing else;\r\nand I am afraid it does nothing else with me. In spite of the warning,\r\nI continue to take my favorite beverage as strong and as frequently as\r\never, and so I suppose must look forward to a cranky nervous old age.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice how men are invading our precincts now-a-days.\r\nThey used to scoff at such a meal as afternoon tea, and now most of\r\nthem take it as regularly as they stream out of the trains on Saturday\r\nafternoons with pink papers under their arms--such elevating\r\nliterature! Indeed there is quite a fuss if they have to go without\r\nit--the tea I mean, not the paper.\r\n\r\nIt is strange too, because they dislike it so, if we trespass on their\r\npreserves, _e.g._, their outcry on ladies smoking: which is\r\nexceedingly unfair, for we have no equivalent for the fragrant weed.\r\nStill I agree with the men in a way, for nothing looks worse than a\r\ngirl smoking in public, though a cigarette now and then with a brother\r\ndoes, I think, no harm, provided it does not grow into a habit.\r\n\r\nMy brother once gave me a cigarette and bet me a shilling that I would\r\nnot smoke it through. It was so hard that if I had bent it, it would\r\nhave snapped in two. He had only just found it in a corner of a\r\ncupboard where it had lain for years and years. But oh, the strength\r\nof that cigarette! It took me hours to get through, for it would not\r\ndraw a bit. Nevertheless, with the incentive of a shilling to urge me\r\non, I continued "faint but pursuing" and eventually won the bet. I\r\nwould not do it again for ten times the amount.\r\n\r\nBut I should be talking about tea, not smoking; and tea has other\r\nbaneful influences besides destroying the digestion. I think that\r\nafternoon tea is the time that breeds more gossip and scandal than\r\nany other hour in the day.\r\n\r\nAs Young exclaims:--\r\n\r\n    "Tea! How I tremble at thy fatal stream!\r\n    As Lethe dreadful to the love of fame.\r\n    What devastations on thy bank are seen,\r\n    What shades of mighty names that once have been!\r\n    A hecatomb of characters supplies\r\n    Thy painted alters\' daily sacrifice!"\r\n\r\nAcquaintances drop in. They have all the latest doings of the\r\nneighborhood at their fingers\' ends, and in a quarter of an hour have\r\npicked everyone of their most intimate friends to pieces, nor do they\r\nleave them a shred of character.\r\n\r\nWhy do we feel such a relish in running down our friends and\r\nrelations--the latter especially? _I_ quite enjoy it, though I should\r\nnever do so outside my own family; thus my words never come round to\r\ntheir ears. It is a necessity to relieve your feelings occasionally,\r\nand your family is a good, safe receptacle.\r\n\r\nFor those who have a taste for speaking spitefully of their neighbors,\r\nI can suggest an amusing game which was, I believe, started in Oxford.\r\nIt is called Photograph whist, and is played by four. Two or three\r\ndozen photographs are dealt round, and each person plays one, he who\r\nplays the ugliest portrait taking the trick. The more hideous the\r\nphotograph, the greater its value as a trump! I have played the game\r\nwith a man who always keeps his brother to the end, and then brings\r\nhim out with enormous success, the said brother never failing to\r\novertrump any other card in the pack! So you see it is a most amiable\r\ngame altogether. You must only be careful not to spread your doings\r\nabroad, or no one will present you with their portraits ever again.\r\n\r\nThere is no sin so bad as being found out. You can say anything as\r\nlong as you are not discovered to be the originator. But if your words\r\nagainst a person ever happen to get round to him or her (of course\r\nadded to, and made almost unrecognizable in their progress) you make\r\nan enemy for life. At least, this is so as a rule. Personally, I never\r\ncare what people say against me, so long as it is not true. But if\r\nthey only keep to the truth, then it is aggravating. You cannot deny\r\nit! You cannot "tremble with indignation, and fling the words back in\r\ntheir faces," as the slandered heroine always does in the modern\r\nnovel. You must simply submit to the accusation.\r\n\r\nA man I know was saying all round the place a little while ago, that\r\nmy sisters and I "were all good looking until we opened our mouths."\r\nOf course we heard of it, and have never forgiven him for his "damning\r\npraise." But it is true. We always admit the fact. We know we show our\r\nteeth too much when we laugh and talk. It was impossible to disclaim\r\nsuch a statement. If he had said that we squinted, not a syllable\r\nwould have been pronounced against him. Our eyes are all exceptionally\r\ngood, and would bear any detrimental remarks. But no, he kept to the\r\ntruth, and consequently has suffered ever since, for ways of revenge\r\nhave been found which were thoroughly successful. He is the ugliest\r\nman I ever met too, and should therefore have been the last to offend.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the tea you are invariably given on such occasions, I\r\nthink calls--formal calls--are some of the most dreadful experiences\r\nMrs. Grundy obliges you to undergo. I dislike them immensely, and\r\nalways get out of them if possible. I hope servants do not afterwards\r\nrecord the expression of my countenance when they tell me their\r\nmistress is "out." It is radiant with an unholy joy!\r\n\r\nThese dreadful "at home" days, too, are so provoking. If you know a\r\ndozen people in a neighborhood, you can only call on one at a time.\r\nThey all have different days! This may seem slightly impossible; but\r\nit is not indeed. While one lady\'s house is open to visitors on the\r\nfirst and third Wednesdays in the month, another is on view on the\r\nsecond and fourth, and so on. Not two people agree!\r\n\r\nSmall talk, I think, is never so small as on these occasions. The poor\r\nweather is thorougly worn out, a few mutual friends are picked to\r\npieces, and of course there is a discussion about dress. Sometimes you\r\nhear some sad account of the lady\'s second cousin\'s daughter, and you\r\nhave immediately to clothe your countenance in a sober garb. You must\r\nlook grieved, and all the while not caring one straw if the cousin\'s\r\ndaughter has fits or gets insane, or anything else she cares to do.\r\nYou have never heard of her before, and therefore have not the\r\nslightest interest in her eccentricities. I always feel so terribly\r\ninclined to laugh, just because I ought to be doing the other thing.\r\n\r\nPeople are so fond of talking about their troubles and griefs. The\r\ngreater the sorrow, the greater the discussion. They call up tears to\r\ntheir eyes, as if the subject were too sacred to approach. But such\r\ntears are kept for the purpose. They come at their bidding, and fall\r\nas naturally into their place as if the exhibition had been practiced\r\nbeforehand. It is a positive enjoyment to such people to detail their\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nWith the lower classes, this, so to speak, gloating over your losses\r\nis even more apparent. One comparatively well-to-do woman I know,\r\nseems to have a monopoly of funerals. There is always some relation\r\ndead, and off she goes with an important air, draped from head to foot\r\nin black; the picture of "loathed melancholy" outwardly; inwardly,\r\nglowing with pride; while all her neighbors stand outside their doors,\r\nliterally consumed with jealousy at her good fortune! And then the\r\nterrible moment of her return, when you are obliged, whether you will\r\nor not, to listen to the whole account, the description, the progress,\r\nand finally the interment of "the corpse"! I hope, however dead I may\r\nbe one day, that I shall never be described as "a corpse"! There is\r\nsomething so horrible in the word, I always think. It makes you even\r\nmore dead than you are. It cuts you so absolutely off from the living.\r\n\r\nThen there are those tiresome people who talk of nothing but their\r\nown families. The mother from whom you hear all the ailments of her\r\nchildren if they are young, all the conquests of her daughters if they\r\nare old. The sisters, to prevent the accusation of vanity, do not\r\npraise themselves, but arrive at the same end by lauding up each\r\nother! These "mutual admiration" families, as Wilkie Collins so aptly\r\nterms them, are families to be shunned.\r\n\r\nYou do not very often come across men on these "at home" days. If they\r\nare in the house, they wisely avoid the drawing-room; and if you ever\r\ndo meet one, he is sure to be a very milk-and-water young man--one who\r\ndelights in small talk and small matters; or else a curate.\r\n\r\nI met one of the former class the other day. He was a dreadful\r\nspecimen! A large head, a bland smile, a vacant stare, and an enormous\r\ncapacity for eating!\r\n\r\nHe came and sat by me when I first arrived; but when he made a slip of\r\nthe tongue, and I brought it to his notice kindly, but firmly, he went\r\naway and sulked for the rest of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe was talking about the recent muzzling order, and added, in quick\r\nlittle tones, "They are talking about muzzling cats, I see."\r\n\r\n"But cats do not bite," I objected.\r\n\r\n"No," in mild surprise at my ignorance; "but they scratch."\r\n\r\n"And do they intend to muzzle their paws?" I asked, smiling; adding a\r\nsuggestion that two pairs of goloshes apiece would answer the purpose\r\nadmirably, besides having the combined advantage of keeping the poor\r\nthings from rheumatism!\r\n\r\nBut he did not smile. He saw nothing funny in what he had said. He\r\nthought I was laughing at him, and so left me at the very first\r\nopportunity, and went and sat by himself at the tea table. I could not\r\nvery well see what he was doing, for his back was turned; howbeit it\r\nwas a very eloquent back--a back which appeared absorbed in bread and\r\nbutter and cakes! He must have cleared the table, I should think,\r\nbefore he had finished!\r\n\r\nIt certainly is not nice to be caught up suddenly and made to appear\r\nfoolish. If you ever make a mistake, the best way is to confess it at\r\nonce, to tell the tale yourself. It sounds very different from your\r\nlips than from those of your dearest friends. People laugh, but it is\r\na laugh that lacks the sting it would have if someone else told it at\r\nyour expense.\r\n\r\nI remember making a woeful slip when I was taken over a cotton mill.\r\nThe man who was conducting us pointed to what looked like a heap of\r\ndirty wool, and explained that it was the raw material. "And is that\r\njust as it comes off the sheep\'s back?" I asked, unthinkingly. If a\r\nthunderbolt had fallen in our midst the guide could not have been more\r\nastonished. "Cotton, Miss!" he said, with grave surprise, "_Cotton_ is\r\na plant!" I inquired for no further information in that cotton mill,\r\nbut I told the story myself when I reached home, joining in the\r\nlaughter that followed as heartily as any of my audience.\r\n\r\nCurates are more the rule than the exception at the five o\'clock meal.\r\nSomehow, you always connect the two. Afternoon tea without a curate\r\nsounds an anomaly, a something incomplete.\r\n\r\nI have had great experience in curates. Ours is a large parish, and\r\nmany clerical helps are needed. Large, small, nice, objectionable,\r\nugly, handsome--I have met specimens of each and all, and have come\r\nto the conclusion that the last kind is the worst. How rarely do you\r\nmeet a good-looking man who thinks of anything but his appearance. It\r\nis strange, for the more lovely a woman is the less apparently\r\nconscious she is of her beauty. At any rate, she does not go about\r\nwith an expression which seems to say, "I am that which is \'a joy\r\nforever\'--admire me!"\r\n\r\nThe "pale young curate" type is perhaps the most general. This poor\r\nthing is so depressingly shy--I say depressingly, because his shyness\r\naffects his company. You try to draw him out. You ask question after\r\nquestion, and have to supply the answers yourself, only obtaining, by\r\nway of reward, despairing upward glances, that are by no means an\r\nencouragement to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe most fatal effect of this shyness, however, lies in the fact that\r\nhe dare not get up to go! He sits toying with his hat, he picks up his\r\numbrella three or four times, and lets it drop again; finally,\r\nstarting up with a rush in the middle of a conversation, he hurries\r\nout, shaking hands all round with everyone but his hostess!\r\n\r\nWould it be a very heinous breach of etiquette, if after an hour and a\r\nhalf of this curate\'s company, one should suggest diffidently that it\r\nwas time to go?\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast, there is the bold, dashing man, who only comes\r\nwhen he knows all the daughters are at home, not so much because it\r\ngives him pleasure to see them, as because he would not deprive them\r\nof the pleasure of talking to him. He has a faith in himself that\r\nremoves mountains; no lady\'s heart can beat regularly in his presence,\r\naccording to his confident opinion.\r\n\r\nSo on the whole I do not think afternoon tea is so nice abroad as it\r\nis at home. It is not so pleasant with many as with a chosen few. I am\r\nselfish, I am afraid, but I must confess I enjoy mine most with the\r\nsole company of a roaring fire, a very easy chair, and a novel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON DRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know who was the originator of the remark, but it has often\r\nbeen said, and is generally admitted, that women do not dress to\r\nplease the men, but to outdo one another.\r\n\r\nI think just the same might be said of men in their turn. It is after\r\nall this spirit of competition which helps to make the world go round.\r\nIt is innate in man, and woman too, to always try to outrun each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWith clothes it is undoubtedly the case. The ancient Briton must have\r\nvied with his neighbor in different designs with the woad plant. An\r\nunusual curve, an uncommon pattern, caused, I daresay, as much\r\nexcitement then as the fashions of our own day.\r\n\r\nI often wonder how they will manage some points in the histories for\r\nthe coming generation. In most of these books you see illustrations\r\nand descriptions of the dress of the period, the costume of the reign.\r\nHow, oh historians! can you show forth those of Victorian times? Fifty\r\nyears have passed already! There were four seasons in each of those\r\nfifty years! Two hundred illustrations must be shown in order to give\r\na correct idea of the dress of the time! Perhaps it might be more\r\nsatisfactory to devote a volume exclusively to the subject.\r\n\r\nIf only we did not run on so quickly! We seem to get faster every\r\nyear. In a very little time, what we wear one day will be quite out of\r\ndate the next! When we arrive at this climax, there will be a sudden\r\nconvulsion of nature, I should think, and we shall return once more to\r\nthe more simple garb of the aborigines. What an amount of trouble it\r\nwould save us! No worrying because the dressmaker has not sent our\r\ngowns home in time! No sending them back to be altered! No\r\ndressmaker\'s or tailor\'s bills; or at the least, very small ones; for\r\n"woad" could not ruin us _very_ much.\r\n\r\nSo on the whole it would be well perhaps if this revolution did occur.\r\nSome such convulsion as geologists declare has already frequently\r\nbefallen our earth; and, as they prophesy, is shortly coming again.\r\n\r\nI do not like talking to these scientific men. They make you feel so\r\ninfinitesimally small. They go back such a long, long way. They make\r\nout that from the Creation (which by the way they do not admit, only\r\nconsidering it another great change in the world springing from\r\nnatural causes), from the Creation until now, is the space of a moment\r\non the great clock of time, is a mere "parenthesis in eternity."\r\n\r\nIt is not nice to feel such a nonentity. What are our lives, our\r\nlittle lives in comparison? We, who each consider ourselves the one\r\nperson upon the earth, the hero or heroine in the great drama: all the\r\nrest mere by-characters. We do not care to be considered of such\r\nlittle consequence; only puppets appearing on the stage for one moment\r\nand taken off the next. We are like the clergyman in the small island\r\noff the North of Scotland, who prayed for the inhabitants "of Great\r\nCumbray and Little Cumbray and the neighboring islands of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland!" On our small piece of land, we yet consider\r\nourselves the centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped if this revolution occurs, after all, that the\r\nclimate will change likewise. We should require something more besides\r\nblue paint in most of our English winters!\r\n\r\nPerhaps we take too much thought for what we shall put on. They say\r\nthat nothing but the prevailing and forthcoming fashions fill the\r\nfeminine mind. It is true sometimes, I daresay, and yet I always agree\r\nwith our immortal bard in thinking that "Self-love is not so vile a\r\nthing as self-neglect."\r\n\r\nIt is decidedly better to think too much than too little. It is a duty\r\nto your country and your nation to look your best, no matter who is\r\nlikely to see you.\r\n\r\nOf course it can be overdone, _e.g._, the lady who insisted on her\r\nbonnet being trimmed on the right because that was the side presented\r\nto the congregation! And she, I am afraid, is only a type of many.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why this should be the rule; yet nearly everyone\r\nseems to bring out their new clothes on Sunday, and exhibit them in\r\nChurch. I suppose it is because they meet so many friends there, and\r\nwith laudable unselfishness wish them all equally to enjoy the sight.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of your going to church?" a man said to me once; "you\r\nonly go to show off your gown and look about to see who has a new\r\nbonnet and who has not! Now, when _I_ go," he went on in a superior\r\nway, "I don\'t notice a single thing anyone has on!"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered quietly, "but you could tell me exactly how many\r\npretty girls were amongst the congregation, and describe their\r\nfeatures accurately!" And he not only forbore to deny the accusation,\r\nbut admitted it with pride! No girl, he assured me, with any pretence\r\nto good looks, ever escaped _his_ notice.\r\n\r\nWhich was the worse, I wonder; he or I? At least I did not glory in my\r\nmisdeeds.\r\n\r\n"_Il faut souffrir pour etre belle_;" and I _have_ suffered sometimes.\r\nHow often I used to burn myself when I first began to curl my hair!\r\nThis is such an arduous task, too, with me, for my hair is, as my old\r\nnurse used to call it, "like a yard o\' pumpwater" (I never went to her\r\nwhen I wanted a compliment). It certainly is straight, and I find it a\r\nmatter of great difficulty to give it the appearance of natural\r\ncurls. But "practice makes perfect," they say, so I still persevere,\r\nhoping that it may come right some day. I have to be so careful in\r\ndamp and rainy weather. It is such a shock to look at yourself after a\r\nday\'s outing, to find your "fringe" hanging in straight lines all down\r\nyour forehead, an arrangement that is so particularly unbecoming. You\r\nbegin to wonder at what time during the day it commenced to unbend,\r\nand if you have had that melancholy, damp appearance many hours.\r\nPerhaps it is as well that you did not know before, for it could not\r\nhave been rectified; you cannot bring a pair of tongs and a\r\nspirit-lamp out of your pocket and begin operations in public! Still\r\nit is exceedingly aggravating if you think you have been making an\r\nimpression, and you return home to confront such a dejected-looking\r\nspectacle as you find in your mirror.\r\n\r\nI am wandering again. Let me get back to my subject--Dress. To insure\r\na good fit you must have your gown so tight that it is impossible to\r\nraise your arms. You are obliged to walk about stiffly, with all the\r\nappearance of a trussed fowl. If you wish to put on your hat you must\r\nfirst unbutton your bodice! It is particularly awkward, too, in\r\nChurch: you scarcely have the power to hold your book at seeing\r\ndistance. But what do such trifles matter? You look as if you had been\r\nmelted and poured into your gown. What are a few discomforts, more or\r\nless, when you have procured an effect such as that?\r\n\r\nI always like to look as tall as possible. Five feet four is not a\r\nvery great height; so, to give the appearance of another inch I have\r\nmy skirts made as long as possible; that is to say, they just don\'t\r\nsweep the pavement, and that is all. But, oh! the trouble of that\r\nextra inch! Unfortunately I have no carriage, my present pecuniary\r\ncondition does not permit me the luxury of hansoms, and I always avoid\r\nan omnibus, where you have fat old men sitting nearly on the top of\r\nyou, wet umbrellas streaming on to your boots, squalling babies, and\r\ndisputes with the conductor continuing most of the way--not to speak\r\nof the time you have to wait while so many roll by "full inside!" So\r\non muddy days, when I take my walks, the amount of distress I have to\r\nundergo on account of the length of my gown is inconceivable. I grow\r\nweary with holding it up, and have to stop in the middle of the street\r\nto change hands, and when you have an umbrella as well, and sometimes\r\na small parcel besides, this performance is anything but a momentary\r\nmatter. You drop your gown, the umbrella changes hands, and the parcel\r\ngenerally falls in the mud! While picking it up, four impatient, wet,\r\nmackintoshed pedestrians knock against you, and go off uttering\r\nimprecations on your head. And when you are once again comfortably\r\nsettled, your satisfaction does not last long. Your left hand tires as\r\nsoon as your right, and the scene has all to be acted over again.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of "_savoir faire_" in holding up. Your gown\r\nmust be high enough to quite clear the ground, but then comes the\r\ndanger of holding it too high. There has been no license yet granted\r\nfor the exhibition of ankles in the great metropolis either by Mrs.\r\nGrundy or the County Councils; therefore "holding up" becomes a very\r\ndelicate performance.\r\n\r\nThough we do not dress only to please the men, I always prefer their\r\ncriticisms on a costume to those of my own sex. You can never tell if\r\nthe latter speak the truth. They may be jealous, and run it down from\r\nspite; they may want to gain something from you, and so call yours "a\r\nperfection of a gown, and suits you admirably, my dear!" disliking it\r\nexceedingly in their inmost hearts.\r\n\r\nBut a man never gives his approbation unless he really means what he\r\nsays, and he is not difficult to please as a rule. So long as the\r\ncostume is neat and well-fitting, he does not care about anything\r\nelse. It is the _tout ensemble_ he thinks of, not the thousand and one\r\ndetails that go to make up the whole.\r\n\r\nI wonder why so many men dislike large hats! It is a pity, for they\r\nare so very becoming to some faces, and give a picturesque effect\r\naltogether. Perhaps this last is a reason for their disapproval. They\r\nnever like their womankind to attract attention.\r\n\r\nThe most unpardonable sin one woman can commit against another, is to\r\ncopy her clothes and bring the style out as her own idea. It is\r\nintensely irritating! If she admits she has copied or asks your leave\r\nbeforehand, it is a different matter. You are even gratified then,\r\nfor "imitation is the sincerest flattery." But to have your ideas\r\nstolen and brought out in such a way as to convey the impression that\r\nyou are the imitator, to say the least, arouses murderous intentions\r\nin your heart!\r\n\r\nThere are times, too, when you receive a shock to your vanity; times\r\nwhen you are quite satisfied with your appearance, and find to your\r\ndismay that everyone is not of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nI remember once when I was dining out and feeling very pleased with my\r\n_tout ensemble_, I was disillusioned in a way that not only upset my\r\nself-confidence, but my gravity at the same time. To heighten the\r\ngeneral effect, I had stuck a patch near my mouth. (Oh, the minds of\r\nthe last century! From whose fertile brain did it emanate, I wonder,\r\nthe fact that a piece of black plaster on the face, should be so\r\neminently becoming!) Imagine my horror when the maid, an old servant I\r\nknew very well, took me aside and whispered confidentially, "Oh, Miss!\r\nyou\'ve got _such_ a big smut on your chin!"\r\n\r\nClothes are altogether a great nuisance, I think. How tired you get of\r\nthe regular routine of the morning toilet; always the same, never any\r\nvariety. Why are we not born, like dogs, with nice cosy rugs all over\r\nus, so that we should just have to get out of bed in the morning,\r\nshake ourselves, and be ready at once to go down to breakfast and do\r\nthe business of the day?\r\n\r\n"Ah well! God knows what\'s best for us all," as an old charwoman said\r\nto me, years ago, when she was remarking on how I had grown. I never\r\nsaw the application of the remark, and do not think I ever shall.\r\nWhether my growth was a subject to deplore, and she tried to comfort\r\nme, or not, I cannot say; but she was evidently proud of the remark,\r\nfor she repeated it three times!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is such a prickly time. Not only everything but everybody is\r\npositively bristling with prickles. Go where you will, you cannot\r\navoid these pointed, jagged edges. You come across them everywhere,\r\nand have to suffer accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there is the holly. Now you could not find anything\r\nlovelier in the way of foliage than holly, only such a little\r\nsuffices. At Christmas time you are literally saturated with it. In\r\nevery house you enter, in everything you eat, at every step you take,\r\nnothing but holly, holly, holly.\r\n\r\nThen there are the Church decorations, begun generally a week\r\nbeforehand. All the ladies of the place assemble in the vestry,\r\nattracted there by divers reasons. Some, by the desire to have a\r\nfinger in every pie; some, because it is an opportunity to meet the\r\ncurates; and some, but a very few, from real love of the work. I\r\ncannot understand these latter, I must confess. It is the most\r\ndisagreeable work I have ever undertaken. Such dirty work, too! Your\r\nhands or your gloves grow perfectly black under the operation; and it\r\nis a curious thing, that when this stage is reached, your nose\r\ninvariably begins to itch, and you forget the condition of your\r\nfingers, and--well, the result is anything but becoming! It is so\r\ncomfortable, too, walking about the vestry, isn\'t it? The holly grows\r\nso affectionate to your ankles, and at every step squash goes a berry,\r\nand all its middle oozes out and sticks to the sole of your boot. When\r\nyou go home, you find you are at least an inch taller by reason of the\r\nmany corpses of berries you have collected!\r\n\r\nYes, Christmas decorations are delightful altogether. And so the\r\nclergymen think, when they become excited in their sermons, and bring\r\ntheir fists down sharply on some charming arrangement of holly round\r\nthe pulpit. They do not actually swear then, but their faces express\r\nsufficiently all they would like to say; it rather spoils the effect\r\nof the discourse, especially if the text be on the virtue of patience.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, everybody is prickly at Christmas time, especially\r\none\'s relations. And so, to make the season as festive as possible,\r\nwe, in our sensible way, collect as many of these cheerful, sociable\r\nbeings together as we can; and, in short, make a delightful family\r\nparty. Holly? it is an insult to the tree to compare it in any way.\r\nNo, I think the whole gathering resembles a hedgehog more than\r\nanything else. It is one _mass_ of prickles. Ah, these happy family\r\nparties! Is there ever one member that agrees with another, I wonder?\r\n\r\nThere is the crabbed old maiden aunt, always on the defensive, never\r\nwithout the idea that someone is waging war against her. Yet she has\r\nto be treated civilly, and humored. Has she not that which some people\r\nterm "filthy lucre," but never really think so? Have these old ladies\r\never had any youth? Have they ever danced and enjoyed themselves like\r\nother people? What has made them so sour, so bitter? Is it\r\ndisappointment or regret? Poor old souls! In spite of their money,\r\nthey never seem happy. They are to be pitied, I think, though they do\r\ntry to make themselves as disagreeable as possible. They are so\r\nindependent, too, they will not be interfered with. They know\r\neverything better than any one else. One old lady I used to know\r\ndeclined altogether to have a lawyer, insisting on making her will\r\nherself. It was found afterwards, fortunately not too late, that she\r\nhad appointed herself her own executor!\r\n\r\nThen there is the maternal grandmother; to whom, of course, the host\r\nis openly rude. This wears you out more than anything, for you have\r\nalways to be ready to smooth over and soften every sentence that is\r\nsaid. And she never helps you at all, either. If she can possibly put\r\nher foot in it, and unconsciously irritate her son-in-law more than\r\never, she does it.\r\n\r\nThen the uncle who spends his life in making the most villainous puns\r\nyou ever heard. Not a remark, not a word in any assembly, which this\r\nwitty specimen of humanity does not at once garnish with a pun of the\r\npoorest description. It generally has to be repeated twice, too, for\r\nit is never noticed the first time. The poor pun, indeed, has a most\r\nmelancholy existence, for it is greeted with no other applause than\r\nthat emanating from the author of its being, and stirs up a torrent of\r\nabuse from the maiden aunt, who thinks the laughter is directed at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhy were punsters ever invented, or family parties either? They are\r\nour thorns in the flesh, I suppose, and so must be endured.\r\n\r\nAfter dancing attendance upon these lively old people during the day,\r\nthe least you expect is a good night\'s rest to support and invigorate\r\nyou for the battles on the following day. But no, at Christmas time\r\nany repose is denied you.\r\n\r\nYou are just off to sleep, forgetful of all troubles and strife, when\r\nyou are rudely awakened and brought back to the present by the most\r\nawful screechings under your window. Morpheus flies, he has a musical\r\near has that god, and when once, "Oh, come let us adore him," with a\r\nconcertina accompaniment, both voices and instrument woefully out of\r\ntune; when once these harmonious strains have started, that good old\r\ndeity goes, to return no more that night.\r\n\r\nWhere does the pleasure come in, I wonder? Certainly not to us fuming\r\ninside; and surely not to those poor deluded people squalling outside!\r\nIt must be so cold, so raw; and they never get appreciated, these\r\nso-called "waits"--oh, if they only would _not_ wait, but go away\r\nsomewhere else, how much more satisfactory for us all!\r\n\r\nNo, Christmas is not a soothing time. It does not altogether improve\r\nyour temper. How glad I am when the festive season draws to a close,\r\nand the last petitioner for Christmas-boxes goes on his way rejoicing.\r\nTo me it always realizes that period so often referred to by the lower\r\nclasses, "a month o\' Sundays." So much church and so few posts!\r\n\r\nIt certainly is a little more interesting when the presents come in.\r\nThere is a kind of excitement about them; and it is not until the\r\nfollowing day, when you find yourself with a dozen letters of\r\ngratitude to indite, that you feel that perhaps, after all, you might\r\nhave done without them.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so annoying as being obliged to write letters when\r\nyou do not feel inclined. It is a great art, this letter writing, and\r\nvery few possess it. People often think they do, and they write for\r\nwriting\'s sake; but these letters are most wearying to read. Between\r\nevery line you seem to see the words, "Is not this a charming letter?"\r\nand in reality you are so bored it is all you can do to reach the end.\r\nThen those dreadful persons who "cross and recross" their epistles in\r\nevery direction! Paper is not so dear but that they could at least\r\nafford a fly-leaf. They defeat their own ends, too, for their letters\r\nare never legible, and they have to write again to explain their\r\nmeaning, thus paying another penny away in postage.\r\n\r\nWhy do we not make a stand against the old forms? Why should we always\r\ntread in the footmarks of our ancestors, instead of making tracks of\r\nour own? "Dear Mr. So-and-So," we write to a man almost a stranger to\r\nus. Imagine his surprise if we addressed him so to his face! And we\r\nend in just such a foolish and unreasonable way, "Yours obediently,\r\nfaithfully, truly!" Where is the sense? Your signature should be quite\r\nenough. You have to be so careful, too, in saying whether you are\r\nobedient, faithful, or affectionate to your correspondent. If you end\r\ntoo warmly, by mistake, the whole letter has to be written again. It\r\nis not a thing you can scratch out or correct. It would look so very\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nPeople have different ideas of "Christmasing." Some prefer to adopt an\r\nunsteady gait, and to spend the night in a ditch or a police-station;\r\nsome have a taste for family parties; some like it better by\r\nthemselves, and some go right away and spend the time at a different\r\nplace every year. These last are, I think, by far the most sensible.\r\nIt is a mistake to have land-marks to remind you how time is running\r\non, how friends have left, how the loved ones have passed away. The\r\nvacant place appears even more empty. The old happy times show out\r\neven happier in contrast to the present. You cannot enjoy yourself or\r\nforget the past, for\r\n\r\n    "A sorrow\'s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things."\r\n\r\nIt is far better to go away somewhere to places which recall no\r\nsorrows or recollections and have no associations with the years gone\r\nby.\r\n\r\nHe is growing such a foolish old man is Father Christmas. He rarely\r\nvisits us now with hoary head, his garments sparkling with frost and\r\nsnow. He is tired of all that. He likes a change of fashion, like\r\neverybody else. He either comes so thickly enveloped in yellow fog\r\nthat you can scarcely distinguish the old man, or else he arrives so\r\ndrenched with rain and splashed up to the beard in mud that we\r\nscarcely like to open our doors to him.\r\n\r\nHe is growing old, I suppose, and trembling on the brink of second\r\nchildhood, so we must not blame him. But still he is not a very great\r\nfavorite of mine, and I cannot refrain from echoing the complaint in\r\none of the comic papers--"_Why doesn\'t he strike, like the rest?_"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt which season, I wonder, is the country most lovely, most enjoyable!\r\nIs it in the spring, with its richly-colored carpet, its young green\r\nleaves, its delicious perfumes, its glorious freshness? Ah, why cannot\r\nwe, like the trees, put off our old sinful world-steeped habits, and\r\nyear by year bud out in purest innocence once again? The hedges, but a\r\nweek ago barren and bare, are now clothed in brightest apparel, the\r\ngreenest of cloaks thrown over them, lifting up their heads and\r\nsharing in the general rejoicing, in the glory of their annual\r\nresurrection. Is it in summer, with its myriads of blooms, and its\r\nthousand thousand happy voices, the silent torpid river, basking in\r\nthe light of the sun, and responding only to the fishes as they frisk\r\nnear the surface? Or is it in the autumn, with its many shades, with\r\nits long avenues on which nature has lavished whole tubes of burnt\r\nsienna and vermilion; when you tread on gorgeous paths heavy with\r\ngolden leaves? Oh, why are we not as lovely in our autumn of life as\r\nnature is in hers? Why, when she decks herself in the gayest coloring,\r\ndo we don our soberest garb? _We_ do not gain in splendor as we grow\r\nolder. We lose our beauties and our charms one by one, till at last we\r\nstand destitute. Oh, cruel Time to treat us so!\r\n\r\n    "Time that doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\r\n    And delves the parallels in Beauty\'s brow."\r\n\r\nAnd yet "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb." While He takes from\r\nus our youth He also takes away the inclination to be young. We pine\r\nfor the happy days of childhood; yet, if the power were given us, who\r\nwould wish himself back in the past? We feel we should always like to\r\nbe young, but should we not get very weary of the world, should we not\r\nwish for some kind of change?\r\n\r\nOr is nature at her best when the year is dead and the earth puts on\r\nher spotless white shroud, when everything around has fallen asleep,\r\nand only robins are left to join in the wake?\r\n\r\nUnanswerable question. There are too many opinions. Some prefer\r\nwinter, some summer; some like the heat, some like the cold. Only in\r\none thing do we agree, and that is, in our taste for variety, for\r\nchange. Much as we admire the country, lovely as it is, it would not\r\nsuit many to live there all the year round. The peace and quiet of our\r\nwoodland scenes make us enjoy the town life all the more, while the\r\nunceasing turmoil of the season makes us hail with delight the idea of\r\nonce more being\r\n\r\n    "Far from the madding crowd."\r\n\r\nThe very thought refreshes you. There is something exhilarating in our\r\njourney country-wards, long and tiring though it may be. Few people\r\ncare about a railway journey, and yet with one or two kindred spirits\r\nI think it most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTraveling alone in the midst of strangers, you do feel rather\r\nmelancholy. You try to read, and when you are tired of chasing the\r\nwords up and down the page, you look out of the window and admire the\r\nscenery as you flit past until your eyes ache to such an extent you\r\nare obliged to withdraw your gaze and be satisfied with the study of\r\nhuman nature, as far as it can be procured from the inmates of your\r\ncompartment. Finally you go to sleep, only to wake up after a few\r\nminutes, to find the eyes of all your fellow passengers upon you, and\r\nthis serves to make you nervous and uncomfortable. You dare not close\r\nyour eyes again. You feel sure it is the signal for everyone to turn\r\nin your direction, and you will not gratify them.\r\n\r\nThen comes luncheon time, when we all begin to grow fidgety, and take\r\nsurreptitious looks at our watches, and then glance round at our\r\ncompanions to see if anyone is taking the first plunge. Hopeless\r\nquest! Nobody ever _will_ be the first to begin to eat in a railway\r\ncarriage. Why is it, I wonder? Are they afraid none of the others will\r\nfollow suit, and they be left to eat all alone? It would be nervous\r\nwork, certainly. You would feel so dreadfully greedy, and yet if you\r\noffered any of your fellow travelers even a sandwich, they would peek\r\nup their heads, give you an astonished look, and decline shortly but\r\nwith decision. You are made to feel you have insulted them, and yet\r\nthey had such a hungry expression! Rarely indeed, though, do you\r\nundergo such an experience. You only have to rise, and reach down your\r\nbasket, and behold! the next moment all the carriage is feeding. We\r\nare nothing but sheep after all. One leads the way, and we all follow.\r\n\r\nWhen you have once made a start, eating on a railway journey is easy\r\nenough work; it is when you grow thirsty that the difficulty comes in.\r\nYou pour the sherry, claret, whatever you have (some take milk in a\r\ngreen bottle--not a very tempting beverage to look at!) on to the\r\nfloor, over your gown, on your neighbor\'s foot (thereby eliciting a\r\nmost unholy frown from the recipient of your bounty), anywhere,\r\nindeed, except in your glass. Even if you are fortunate enough to\r\ncatch a few drops, it is another Herculaean effort to take it to your\r\nmouth. No, drinking in the train, while it is in motion, requires\r\nyears of practice.\r\n\r\nThen again, your fellow passengers are not always all that can be\r\ndesired. Often they are neither pleasant in themselves nor interesting\r\nas a study. I traveled with an awful old lady the other day. She had\r\nsix small packages with her in the carriage, besides her hand-bag and\r\numbrellas and half the contents of an extra luggage van. The\r\nlong-suffering porter who had looked after her boxes and finally put\r\nher in the train, was crimson with his exertions. The generous lady,\r\nhaving searched several pockets before finding the necessary coin,\r\nbestowed on him a threepenny piece for his trouble! "Thank yer, mum,"\r\nhe went off muttering grimly, "I\'ll bore a \'ole in the middle and \'ang\r\nit round my neck."\r\n\r\nThis good dame never ceased to worry all through the journey. She\r\npulled her things from under the seat and put them up in the rack, and\r\nthen reversed their locality. At each station she called frantically\r\nto the guard to know where she was and if she ought to change.\r\nFinally, when we reached our destination, it was proved that she had\r\ntaken her ticket to one place and had her luggage labelled to another;\r\nand there she was, standing on the platform gesticulating violently,\r\nwhile the train was steaming off with her belongings. What happened I\r\ndo not know, for I was hurried off by my friends; but I should think\r\nit would be long before she and her luggage met again.\r\n\r\nFortunately she never knew how near she was to her death. If ever I\r\nhad murderous intentions in my heart, it was on that journey north.\r\n\r\nYou do not feel very affectionate toward the country on a wet day.\r\nIndeed, it is a most mournful affair altogether, unless you have a\r\nparticularly merry house party. There is absolutely nothing to do. The\r\nheavens weep at such inopportune moments too. There is sure to be some\r\nlarge picnic, some delightful gathering on the "tapis," when they\r\nchoose to exhibit their griefs. And they never notice how unwelcome\r\nsuch a display of feelings is, but go on weeping, weeping, weeping all\r\nday long, until at last you catch the malady yourself, and are obliged\r\nperforce to mingle a few of your own tears with theirs.\r\n\r\nNo, there is simply nothing to be done, and Satan has quite a\r\ndifficulty to find enough work for all the idle hands. Some can be\r\nperfectly happy in spending all their time in solving the intricacies\r\nof those many wonderful puzzles which have appeared lately as a sort\r\nof antidote to the mischief generally supposed to be perpetrated by\r\nthe aforesaid gentleman. Unfortunately, an entirely contrary effect is\r\nproduced on me. They did not look far enough ahead when they made me.\r\nThey could not conceive the wonderful minds of this time, and so did\r\nnot endow me with a sufficient quantity of patience. If they could\r\nhave imagined those marvelous little tin saucers, with shot running in\r\nand out of horse-shoes, &c., with _me_ in the perspective, well, I\r\nthink they would have gone about their work more carefully, and\r\nperhaps brought about a happier result. As it is, the puzzles are\r\nalways swept away now at my approach. I have smashed so many.\r\n\r\nIt is base ingratitude, too, on my part, to bring them to so speedy an\r\nend; for what I owe to those dear little things I am powerless to\r\nexpress. Those entertaining people who sit speechless, and only answer\r\nyes and no with an eternal smile on their faces: give them a puzzle.\r\nThere is no further effort to amuse them required on your part. They\r\nare at once absorbed in "shot." Their only idea is to successfully get\r\nthem into their places. They never do; but being good thorough-going\r\ncharacters will never give up the attempt.\r\n\r\nYou meet several of these people in the country, but they never get\r\nvery friendly. You shock them too much with your "London manners."\r\nThey vote you "fast," and turn aside, fearful of contamination for\r\ntheir daughters.\r\n\r\nOh, the dreariness, the heaviness of a country dinner party! It seems\r\nto last four times as long as any other--parish, horses, or crops the\r\nonly topic of conversation. How can you be interested in old Jane\r\nSmith\'s rheumatism when you have never heard of her before; in the\r\nswelling of a favorite mare\'s hock, when you did not know it possessed\r\nsuch a thing. People\'s views grow so dreadfully narrow, shut up in\r\ntheir small parish. Their stock of conversation is so very small. It\r\nis wise to find out your dinner partner at once, and avoid that man as\r\nyou would a disease until the meal is announced. If not, if you\r\naccidentally get in his neighborhood, and he talks to you, all his\r\nconversation is at once exhausted, and you are obliged to hear it over\r\nagain at table, or submit to an interesting silence.\r\n\r\nDinner parties anywhere are, I think, a mistake. It is a wicked waste\r\nof time to spend nearly three hours over eating and drinking. And you\r\nrequire such a very interesting "taker-in" to make it bearable at all.\r\n\r\nThe river is the nicest way of spending a holiday, in my opinion; you\r\nare so free and untrammeled. Mrs. Grundy even waives some of her laws\r\non the river. The smaller the cottage, the more primitive the place,\r\nthe more enjoyable it is. You can spend your time on the water, and\r\nwhen you are tired of that, you can hire a pony and trap and drive\r\nthrough some of the loveliest bits of English scenery, to your heart\'s\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nOnly be careful before engaging your pony to find out its previous\r\noccupations. It is a necessary caution, I assure you. It once took me\r\nnearly an hour to drive out of one of the smallest villages\r\nimaginable. And why? Because my pony had formerly belonged to the\r\nbutcher, and insisted on first going his rounds! I coaxed, I\r\npersuaded, I lashed him, but it was all of no avail. On he trotted\r\nuntil he reached the familiar doors of his late customers, and then he\r\nstopped and _would_ not go on for at least five minutes. One place\r\nwas worse than any. I could not get him away for over a\r\nquarter-of-an-hour. This rather mystified me until I was told later\r\nthat the butcher was on "walking out" terms with the cook residing\r\nthere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON TOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not much difference of opinion as to when Town is at its\r\nbest. Perhaps a few misanthropists, wrapped up in their little selves\r\nand their narrow thoughts, would shut themselves up during the season,\r\nin order to escape the pain of witnessing us all in our ungodly\r\ncareer. Shallow butterflies they call us. And what do they know about\r\nour lives? They judge from appearances; and because we wear a cheerful\r\nexpression, shutting down our cares and struggles in our inmost\r\nhearts, and not burdening other people with them, we are called\r\nshallow and worldly. No, you good and godly people, what do you know\r\nabout us? You are no more capable of judging than the ephemera, which\r\nlives but for a day, and so must consider the world all sunshine, all\r\nlight. How can it imagine the night which closes round later on, when\r\nneither it nor any of its ancestors have ever lived to see it?\r\n\r\nYou ought to be punished for your ignorant mutterings. You complain of\r\nthe well-dressed happy throng. You should be turned out in the streets\r\nin August and September, and if the utter destitution does not shortly\r\nturn your brains back in the right direction I am afraid your case is\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nDoes any place come up to London I wonder? Having never been out of\r\nEngland I cannot give an opinion. Unfortunately I have not the gift,\r\nlike some people, of either imagining or describing places I have\r\nnever seen--descriptions generally gleaned from other books and\r\ncompiled under one authorship as original compositions. Why cannot\r\nthey be content with laying their English stories in English scenery:\r\nplaces they know well and can write about. Some save up their money in\r\norder to go abroad and visit one particular place, so as to bring new\r\nscenes into their new books. But ah, how weary you get of this one\r\nplace! It is brought into at least three of their next novels.\r\nEverything, past, present and future seems to happen there. Your one\r\nprayer, as you lay down the book, is to the effect that they may soon\r\nbe able to save up a little more and visit another spot.\r\n\r\nThere is so much going on in May, June, and July, that it is a\r\ndifficulty to get through all your engagements and yet see everything\r\nthere is to be seen. Then there is the Park. Two or three hours of the\r\nday must at least be spent in the Park. There we all come out to show\r\nourselves and to look at others. There the equestrians canter up and\r\ndown the Row. Such equestrians too! If foreigners take their ideas of\r\nEnglish riding from the Row, they must form a high opinion of our\r\nhorsemanship.\r\n\r\nThere are the loungers flocking around their friends or walking up and\r\ndown in the hope of admiration. And they get it too, for who could\r\nhelp admiring such master-pieces of a tailor\'s skill? Are these really\r\nthe descendants of that Adam whose posterity had all to earn their\r\nbread by the sweat of their brow? These automatons, whose only\r\nbusiness in life seems to be to look after pretty women and\r\nthemselves? Men are supposed to be bread winners, but they have a\r\nvery easy time of it, I think, though they generally try to make\r\nthemselves out so overworked. Go into that great centre of business,\r\nthe City, and you find everyone of these busy men out and about,\r\nalways apparently in a great hurry, never seeming to arrive at any\r\ndestination, running about and hustling each other, occasionally\r\nmeeting an acquaintance, which proves a good opportunity for one to\r\nstand the other a "drink." A funny way men have of showing their\r\naffection, have they not? "Ah! how de do, old fellow? Come and have a\r\ndrink," is their invariable salutation to an intimate friend. After\r\nall it is better than the mutual kissing on the part of women, which\r\nis the more emphatic the more they dislike one another. Men are less\r\ndemonstrative and therefore more sincere in their friendships. Anyhow\r\nthere cannot be many at work in their offices, or where could this\r\nidle crowd come from?\r\n\r\nIn spite of their haste, though, they generally find time to stare at\r\nany woman who crosses their path. Why should not a woman go to the\r\nCity? She has as much right there as man, and yet if she is in the\r\nleast degree superior to the flower girls (?) who surround the Royal\r\nExchange, she is looked on as a freak of nature, a positive curiosity,\r\nand is followed by every pair of male eyes within reach!\r\n\r\nMrs. Grundy is inclined to rather overdo her season, I think. There is\r\nso much she might leave undone, so many things that "never would be\r\nmissed." Imagine the gratitude that would be displayed to anyone who\r\nwould put down and demolish those dreadful crushes, so called "at\r\nhomes," where nobody ever is at home; where you have neither space nor\r\nair from the moment you arrive until the glad time comes for\r\ndeparting. Does anyone enjoy them, I wonder! Does anybody like being\r\nliterally baked with heat, which I am sure must exceed even that at\r\nMexico; where one of the inhabitants of that delightful climate, when\r\nhe died and went to perdition, found the contrast so striking that he\r\nwas obliged to send home for his greatcoat!\r\n\r\nStill, I suppose such entertainments will continue to exist. They are\r\na good deal cheaper than balls or dinners, and you can "knock off"\r\never so many people at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is well, at any rate, to consider economy in some matters in these\r\nwofully extravagant days. When the shops are decked out in their\r\ngayest colors to lure us on to destruction, why is it that "just the\r\nvery thing you want" is placed so conspicuously in the front of the\r\nwindow, put cunningly near a mirror too, so that you see it all the\r\nway round, and it appears doubly precious?\r\n\r\nHow convenient it is, by the way, when they have mirrors in the shop\r\nwindows. You can look to see if your hat is straight, or your veil\r\nnicely arranged, without being credited with vanity. You are supposed\r\nto be admiring the bonnets displayed to view, not yourself. Girls make\r\na great mistake when they take little surreptitious glances at any\r\nmirror they come across. The action is always noticed and condemned;\r\nwhile if they, instead, went up boldly, ostensibly to smooth their\r\nhair or alter a pin, it would be taken as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIt so soon grows into a habit, this always looking about for your\r\nreflection, and one that is very difficult to get out of. Not that the\r\nmen are at all behind us in this respect. There are not many of our\r\nlittle follies that the lords of creation do not take up and\r\ncultivate. You see them at dinner, addressing nearly all their\r\nconversation opposite--where hangs a mirror. At dances they are\r\nadmiring and smiling at their reflections the whole evening, finding\r\nfar more satisfaction in gazing there than at their partner, even\r\nthough she be the loveliest in the land.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my subject. (I seem to be always wandering away.) You\r\nneed never be idle in town. A wet day even makes no difference, when a\r\nplace teems with picture galleries, as London does. They are such good\r\nplaces to meet your friends. You always see someone you know. You\r\nmight as well be there as anywhere else. Of course you do not look at\r\nthe pictures. You glance at the few you have heard talked about, just\r\nso as to say you have seen them. But you do not go to a picture\r\ngallery to look at _pictures_! "We always go the wrong way round. You\r\navoid the crowd like that, you know," I have heard people say.\r\n"_Avoid_ the crowd!" It is the crowd they want to see! There is less\r\nchance of missing your friends if you go in the opposite direction!\r\nThere is one real advantage though in beginning at the other end. You\r\ndon\'t have the same people following you all the time, nor have to\r\nlisten to ignorant remarks. "Who\'s that? She don\'t look very happy, to\r\nbe sure," I once heard one woman ask of another as they were going\r\nround. "That? why that\'s Adam and Eve, o\' course, and the serpent in\r\nthe distance. I never \'eard of anyone else who went about without\r\ntheir clothes on, though why they put chains on her I can\'t think: it\r\nsays nothing about \'em in the Bible."\r\n\r\nI glanced at the picture. It was "Andromeda!" And they talk of the\r\nstrides education has been making of late years!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON CHILDREN AND DOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you very shocked that I should couple these two subjects? An\r\ninsult to the children, do you say? Well, do you know, I am afraid I\r\nconsider it an insult to the dogs. I am not fond of children, and I\r\nlove dogs. A man may be a superior animal to a dog, but a puppy is\r\ndecidedly more intelligent than a baby. What can you find more\r\nhelpless, more utterly incapable, than a baby? Look at a puppy in\r\ncomparison. At a month old it is trotting about, and growing quite\r\nindependent; more sensible altogether than a child aged a year.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I shock people often by my opinions, but they are really\r\ngenuine. I am always more interested in the canine race than in the\r\nblossoms of humanity. Very likely it is the behavior of each that\r\nmakes me so. Children never take to me, nor come near me if they can\r\nhelp it. I do not understand them, or know what to talk to them about.\r\nOn the other hand, dogs will come to me at once, and, what is more,\r\nkeep to me. I have never been growled at in my life, and I have come\r\nacross a good many dogs, too.\r\n\r\n"You were a baby yourself once!" How often has this been said to me\r\nwhen I have aired the above opinions. It is put before me as an\r\nunanswerable argument, a sort of annihilating finale to the\r\nconversation. Yet I really don\'t see what it has to do with the\r\nmatter. I suppose I was a baby once. At least they say so. Which\r\nprotestation, by the way, rather leaves it open to doubt, for "on\r\ndits" like weather forecasts are nice reliable institutions if you do\r\nbut follow the opposite of what they tell you. Still, as there is more\r\nthan one witness to the effect, I will give in and admit it; I was a\r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nBut the admission makes me no fonder of the species. If anything it\r\nmakes me admire them the less; for if I at all resembled the\r\nphotographs that were taken of me--"before my eyes were open," I was\r\ngoing to say; at any rate before I could stand--I wonder a stone was\r\nnot put round my neck, and they did not drown me in the first bucket\r\nof water they came across.\r\n\r\nIt is said that ugly babies grow up the best looking, and _vice\r\nversa_. This is a pleasant and comforting thought for the ugly baby.\r\nIt can bear a little depreciation now, because it can look forward to\r\nthe time when it will far outdo its successful rival. And the pretty\r\nbaby\'s glory is soon over. It becomes only a memory which rather\r\nirritates than soothes. For after all, retrospection is not so\r\npleasant as anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe above remark was said before a child about four years old, the\r\nother day. She must have been listening intently, and having taken in\r\nthe sense she inwardly digested it; for the next time she quarrelled\r\nwith her sister, she broke in spitefully, "You must have been the\r\nbeautifullest baby that ever was born."\r\n\r\nChildren should never be seen until they are over two. Until then they\r\nare neither pretty nor entertaining. But at this age they begin to say\r\nfunny things, and so are interesting. "You only care for them when\r\nthey amuse you!" cried a young mother once, indignant at my\r\nselfishness. I suppose it is a selfish way of looking at it; but if\r\nmodern children were brought up as we were brought up I should not\r\nobject to them in the least. We were always kept strictly in the\r\nnursery, only appearing down-stairs on the rarest occasions: and when\r\nwe arrived there we behaved properly--we were seen and not heard. We\r\ndid not run noisily up and down the room, taking up the whole\r\nconversation of the party. We did not try to make the most\r\ndisagreeable personal remarks; or if we did we were sent up-stairs at\r\nonce, and not laughed at for our "sharpness."\r\n\r\nThere are no children, now-a-days; they are mimic men and women. They\r\ndine late, they stay up until the small hours, and are altogether as\r\nobjectionable a faction as can be. They respect their father and\r\nmother not a whit. It was only two or three days ago I heard a child\r\nof five allude to her father as "the fat old governor," and simply get\r\nlaughed at for her remark, no one joining more heartily than the said\r\nparent himself. Of course, with such applause, the child repeats it\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nThey have such dreadfully sharp eyes, too, these children. Not a\r\ndefect escapes their notice. You tremble to hear what will come out\r\nnext. They ask Mr. Jones what makes his nose so red. They want to know\r\nwhy Mrs. Smith puts flour on her face. In spite of a thick veil, they\r\ndiscover at once that Miss. Blank has a moustache, and inquire of her\r\nwith interest if she is a man!\r\n\r\nThere are some nice children, of course--there are exceptions to every\r\nrule--and if they are pretty I cannot help admiring them. It is\r\nfortunate that I have never had anything to do with children. If I\r\nwere a governess I should be so dreadfully unjust, I should always\r\nfavor the pretty ones. I love beauty in any form. There are girls I\r\ncould sit and look at all day, if they would let me. Only they are\r\nmost of them so self-conscious; they expect to be admired, and when I\r\nsee girls laying themselves out for admiration, however beautiful they\r\nmay be, however strong my inclination to gaze, I will not gratify\r\ntheir vanity. For it is certainly true, that though we prefer the\r\npraise of men, we do not disdain any like offering from our own sex.\r\n\r\nThat is the best of very young children. They do not notice you, they\r\nare not yet awake to the power of their charms, so that you are able\r\nto look your full. I say "very" young, because it is a knowledge that\r\ncomes to them only too soon, and a little of this knowledge is, at any\r\nrate, "a dangerous thing."\r\n\r\nChildren sometimes set you thinking more than any philosopher who ever\r\nexisted. Their ideas are so fresh, so unsophisticated, so original.\r\nThe atmosphere of the great unknown still seems to cling to their\r\nsouls. They are not yet tainted with the world\'s impure air. They ask\r\nyou questions impossible to answer, but which you are obliged to parry\r\nin an underhand manner, so as not to expose your ignorance. They solve\r\nproblems and reach conclusions after a way of their own, which, at any\r\nrate, have plenty of reason about them. I remember being very much\r\nstruck by a little boy\'s idea once when his mother was remarking on\r\nthe strange appearance of a man who, while his whiskers were black as\r\nebony, possessed hair of a snowy white. "But why, mother, should it\r\nseem funny?" broke in the child. "Aren\'t his whiskers twenty years\r\nyounger than his hair?"\r\n\r\nDogs certainly cannot talk or say quaint things, but they can do\r\nnearly everything else. At any rate they can understand you and\r\ndistinguish between the words, as the following instance proves.\r\n\r\nWe have family prayers at home, and have had them ever since we were\r\nquite little things. What an ordeal they used to be too! We used to be\r\nwatched so strictly, and the moment our eyes wavered from our books,\r\nattention would at once be drawn to the culprits and cover them with\r\nconfusion. Woe be to him, too, who forgot to turn over the leaf of his\r\nbook with the rest! It is such an unkind thing to do to print all the\r\nbooks alike. If you forget and turn over later, you are at once\r\ndetected. Being sharp children, however, we used to make this our\r\nfirst care, so that whatever we were doing--laughing, pinching,\r\nwinking, our pages all went over together, so we _sounded_ attentive.\r\n\r\nOur little dog was even more cunning than ourselves. He was never\r\npermitted, on any plea, to lie before the fire. "It enlarged his\r\nliver," his master said. Now this decree is a great deprivation to\r\ndogs. They like warmth and comfort just as much as we do; indeed,\r\nthey love the fire to such an extent that if all the terrors of Hades\r\nwere put before them, they would by no means have a salutary effect.\r\nThe dogs would try to be as naughty as possible in the hopes of\r\ngetting there.\r\n\r\nBut this particular little animal was made of most obstinate\r\nmaterials, and had no intention of being baulked; so directly we knelt\r\ndown for prayers, he scrambled from under the table, and stretched his\r\nfull length before the fire. He knew he would not be spoken to until\r\nwe had finished, and felt quite safe until we all joined in the Lord\'s\r\nPrayer at the end, when he would immediately decamp, and thus escape\r\nany scolding for his disobedience. It was more especially clever of\r\nhim because we all joined in the Confession as well, but he never took\r\nany notice of that, and always put off his departure until the last\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nWe had this dog twelve years altogether, and a sad night it was,\r\nindeed, when he had a fit and died. The breakfast-table next morning\r\npresented a most distressing spectacle. We were all positively\r\nswimming in tears. The whole family was upset at his death; and when,\r\nlater on in the day, he was wrapped up in a fish basket and buried in\r\nthe garden, next door to a favorite rabbit--on whose grave a cabbage\r\nhad been planted, most unkindly reminding him of the sweets of life he\r\nhad left behind--we all lifted up our voices and wept again.\r\n\r\nI often wonder if we shall meet our faithful dumb friends hereafter!\r\nSages say no; but I cannot believe they are so entirely blotted out,\r\nand like to think they have some happy sugary existence somewhere, and\r\nthat we shall see them again some day.\r\n\r\nDogs are very human after all; they have a great many of our virtues\r\nand nearly all our vices. I expect it is this that endears them to us,\r\nfor "One touch of nature makes all the world kin." They are just as\r\ncontradictory, as disappointing, as ourselves. Why will they always\r\nshow off to such bad advantage? After spending weeks in teaching them,\r\nand fortunes on pieces of sugar, why, before an audience, will they\r\ninsist on ringing the bell when they are told to shut the door? and\r\nwhen you ask them to sit up and beg, _why_ do they die for the Queen?\r\n\r\nA little while ago we used to have grand steeplechases with our dogs.\r\nWe put up fences and water jumps, all of which--with the aid of sugar\r\nagain--they were able to master in time. I think they used to get\r\nquite excited themselves at last. Our old gardener, who used to watch\r\nthe races with great interest, told me once that he "\'ad seen one of\r\nthe little dawgs a\'jumpin\' backwards and forwards over that \'ere bit\r\nof wood (the highest and most perilous jump), and a\'practisin\' by\r\nhisself!" He _was_ a very clever "little dawg," but I don\'t think he\r\never reached such a pitch of intelligence as to practice "by hisself."\r\n\r\nWe had to fill up the fences down to the ground, or, to save\r\nthemselves the trouble of getting over, they would run under or\r\nscramble through in some extraordinary fashion, which in the end took\r\nmuch the most time and pains. Humanity again! Lazy people always take\r\nthe most trouble!\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little girl I had every morning to learn and repeat to my\r\ngoverness three verses from a French Bible. I thought I had hit upon\r\nan easy way of getting over this, and of reducing the quantity I had\r\nto commit to memory; so I chose the cxxxvi. Psalm, in which you will\r\nfind, if you care to look it up (I have just had to do the same to\r\nfind out the number, not being by any means a living concordance to\r\nthe Psalms!)--you will find that half of each verse is composed of the\r\nwords, "For His mercy endureth for ever." Ingenuity wasted! Trouble\r\nincreased! Not one whit the better off was I. Until that Psalm was\r\nfinished I had to learn six verses instead of three. I retired\r\nanything but satisfied, and heartily wishing I had left that Psalm\r\nalone. It was very mean of my governess all the same. She should\r\nbetter have appreciated the craftiness of her pupil. But, poor things,\r\nthey have to be very sharp and always on the look-out, or the children\r\nwill take them in; they will not let any opportunity escape them, and,\r\nindeed, I pity anyone who has the care of these unraveled Sphinxes,\r\nthese uncut Gordian knots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nON CONCERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not thinking about the Albert Hall Concerts, where the highest in\r\nthe musical world go time after time, always singing the same songs.\r\n\r\nNeither am I thinking of "Monday Pops," and purely classical concerts,\r\nto which at least half the audience listens with closed eyes and\r\nthoughts somewhere in dreamland. They like to be thought musical; they\r\nknow they ought to appreciate _such_ renderings of _such_\r\ncompositions; and after all, when they describe "the treat they had!\r\nsuch a perfect touch, my dear! and the execution!!--" no one knows\r\nthey have never heard a note, so what does their inattention matter.\r\nThey have been seen there, and that is all they care about.\r\n\r\nNo, my thoughts take a much lower range. They are intent on only\r\namateur productions, from penny readings upwards, to those\r\nsuperintended by the _elite_ of the neighborhood, when the seats rise\r\nin price to five shillings each.\r\n\r\nThey are such nice cheery entertainments, so much life, such a great\r\ndeal of energy about them! You are called on by four separate people\r\nto take tickets. In desperation you have to yield at last; paying\r\nextra for having your seat reserved, or else you must start\r\nhalf-an-hour beforehand, and scramble in with the crowd. There is\r\ngenerally a series of them too, and you are obliged to go to them all.\r\nThey are so considerate, these concert-makers, they would not allow\r\nyou to miss one for worlds.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of novelty and variety about the artists\r\nthemselves. All the musical members in the neighborhood are routed\r\nout, and each is persuaded to contribute to the public pleasure--by\r\nthe way, there is never very much persuasion needed. It is such a\r\ntreat to listen to people you know, and whom you have heard perform\r\ndozens and dozens of times before in every drawing-room in the place.\r\nAt least, you know what to expect. You recognize each song, each\r\npiece. You wait in suspense until Miss. Brown has passed her high\r\nA--always half a tone too flat. You take it as a matter of course that\r\nMr. Black--the first violinist in the place--after tuning up for ten\r\nminutes, will break a string directly he begins to play. I should have\r\nthought he would be pretty well used to it by now, but he never gets\r\nin tune again for the rest of the evening. You would be quite\r\ndisappointed if Mrs. Green ever concluded her most finished and\r\nspirited pianoforte solo on the right chord.\r\n\r\nThese concerts always begin with a pianoforte solo, and the performers\r\nought to feel very flattered at the way in which they are received.\r\nWe, the audience, regard them no more than we do the mounted policemen\r\nin the Lord Mayor\'s Show. They are not part of the procession. They\r\nare only meant to clear the way and let us know that the concert is\r\ngoing to begin, and then we must leave off our chatter. Naturally, we\r\nmake the most of our time, and try to get all our talking done at\r\nonce. In fact, we are so taken up with what we are saying that we\r\nactually forget to applaud when the performance is over.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction in this form, the chief moving spirit of the\r\nentertainment comes forward, and, after bowing right and left,\r\nstammers out (the chief moving spirit is never a good speaker) that he\r\nmuch regrets that, on account of Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith, and Miss. Blank\r\nhaving been prevented by illness from turning up, he is afraid there\r\nwill be a little change in the programme. Now as Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith,\r\nand Miss. Blank are down for seven things between them there is likely\r\nto be a very great change in the programme. Why is it that people\r\nnever know they cannot come until the last moment, I wonder? Perhaps\r\nthey think that the more often they disappoint the more they emulate\r\nthe "stars" in the musical world. Only the force of example, you see.\r\nAnd, after all, what does it matter? The other performers are most\r\nkind and sympathetic, and ready to help all they can. They are\r\ndelighted to sing four times each instead of twice. Selfish people!\r\nthey have no consideration for the audience, they only think of their\r\nown enjoyment!\r\n\r\nThere is the youth who looks as if he were going to favor us with a\r\nsweet treble. Lo, and behold! he opens his mouth, and out comes a\r\nloud double bass voice that seems to spring somewhere from the region\r\nof his boots. It is not a pretty sound by any means.\r\n\r\nThere is the smiling, simpering girl who comes forward gorgeously\r\narrayed in light blue satin. She chooses a song, all trills and little\r\nscales, running up and down, shaking at last upon a high note for\r\nnearly two minutes, and then coming down with a rush. This brings down\r\nthe house. We applaud lustily; we begin the encoring business here,\r\nwhich, having once started, we do not intend to give up again. We like\r\nto get as much as we can for our money, we Britons. She keeps us\r\nwaiting some time, too--taking a little refreshment in between,\r\nperhaps--and then comes back beaming with smiles and, under the\r\nimpression that she is a second Patti, shrieks out in plaintive tones,\r\n"Home, sweet home!" A cat might as well try to emulate a thrush! And\r\nwe never find it "sweet" either. Never do you dislike "Home" more than\r\nwhen you hear it sung thus.\r\n\r\nThere is the sentimental man, who gets into position while the\r\nintroduction to his song is being played. He sticks his finger down\r\nhis collar (the object of which I can never understand), pulls both\r\ncuffs out, stretches out his music a yard or two in front of him and\r\ngazes above the audience with a hungry yearning look. His is always a\r\nlove song, an unhappy love song, that should bring tears to our eyes,\r\nonly we are so taken up with his expression, and the fear that he is\r\ngoing to die or have a fit, that we have no time for weeping. True to\r\nour instincts, he is greeted with deafening applause, and coming back,\r\nhe generously treats us to the last verse over again.\r\n\r\nEveryone is not so fortunate in receiving an encore, though. It\r\ndepends on how well they are known, not on their desserts.\r\nThe newcomer in the neighborhood tries her hardest and does her best,\r\nbut as we have never seen her before we scarcely take the trouble to\r\napplaud her, which must be rather disappointing, especially when her\r\nmother is sitting among the audience with the encore song on her lap,\r\nready to hand it up.\r\n\r\nThe best exhibition of all is made by the flutist. He is the only one\r\nwho plays that instrument for miles round, and so the swagger with\r\nwhich he steps on to the platform is perhaps excusable.\r\n\r\nHow anyone _can_ play it I do not know. It is such a singularly\r\nunbecoming instrument. But the wretched owner never seems to think so.\r\nWhen he once commences he gives us a good dose of it. We begin to\r\nthink he is going on all night. Suddenly there comes a pause, and\r\napplause is started at once, we being only too delighted to make a\r\nlittle noise on our own account. But no--it is a mistake, a delusion,\r\nafter all. The pause was only an interval between an Andante and a\r\nScherzo; and, with a bland smile at his ovation, on he goes again for\r\nanother quarter of an hour. We--the audience--are disappointed, we\r\nfeel we have been tricked, and we therefore sulk for a season. But the\r\nScherzo is so long, it gives us time to get over our ill-humor, though\r\nwe are mutually resolved that we will not have him back again. Vain\r\nhope! From the far end of the room comes thundering applause, which\r\nnever dies away until the talented flutist appears on the platform\r\nagain. We find out afterwards that he treats the whole of his\r\nestablishment to the cheap seats; so, of course, poor things, we\r\ncannot blame them. They are only earning their wages. Perhaps they are\r\npresented with an extra shilling each when their master returns home.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing how we all like applauding and making a noise.\r\nIf you notice, at organ recitals in the Church we feel quite\r\nuncomfortable. We think we ought to do something at the conclusion of\r\nthe pieces; so, as we may not clap our hands, we all give a little\r\nrustle and cough. This is to show our approbation. _Every_one coughs.\r\nIt is astonishing how many people have bad colds. For my part I think\r\nit is a pity applause is not allowed. It is infinitely preferable to\r\nthe coughing at any rate.\r\n\r\nOf course the comic singer goes down best. He is called back three,\r\nsometimes four times. The schoolboys behind grow excited, and greet\r\nhim with a whistle that would do credit to the "gods." This is too\r\nmuch for decently-clad minds, anything so profane as that whistle. The\r\nclergyman, who is in the chair (the proceeds are always to be devoted\r\nto some charitable object), rises and insists "that if that most\r\nobjectionable noise does not cease, the boys will have to be turned\r\nout."\r\n\r\nWhere the "objectionable" comes in I cannot think. The boys are very\r\nclever to be able to do it. I have often tried it, and cannot succeed,\r\nand so conclude it must be a difficult accomplishment. They stick\r\nabout four fingers in their mouths, and thereby make quite a different\r\nsound to any ordinary whistle. However, it is no wonder the chairman\r\ndiscourages it. When he was reading a few minutes before, reading out\r\nsome dry little tale with a moral, in which the humorous parts were\r\nthe heaviest, no encore whistle was accorded him. He was clapped\r\nloudly, of course--is he not one of the chief men in the parish? But\r\nno one wished to hear him read again, so we stopped our applause just\r\nin time to prevent him from re-appearing.\r\n\r\nWe go home glad at heart, and two mornings later read an account of\r\nthe evening\'s performance in the local paper.\r\n\r\nWe find there a few statements which agree with our own feelings.\r\nThey say that "Mr. Jones sang in a pure and cultured manner, and\r\ndeserves special attention for his sweet tenor voice and the\r\nrefinement of the sentiment in his songs" (whatever that may mean!)\r\n"Mr. Smith played two violin solos with remarkable precision of touch\r\nand with the greatest ease;" while "Miss. Blank, with a good contralto,\r\nwas all that could be desired in both her songs!" They were none of\r\nthem there, but that does not matter. They were praised up more than\r\nanyone else, which must be very discouraging to those who _did_\r\nperform. But on account of their non-appearance alone we feel they\r\ndeserve some approbation, and so do not grudge it them. It is of no\r\nconsequence to a newspaper reporter who is there and who is not. He\r\ntakes the programme, ticks off the names, and writes his remarks and\r\ncriticisms just as he likes. It would be wiser, all the same, on his\r\npart, if he found out the absentees, for otherwise his little hints\r\nrather lose their effect.\r\n\r\nHe writes that this one wants a little "animation," that one "sings\r\nout of tune." Miss So-and-So plays the piano "with faultless\r\nmanipulation, the only drawback being a slight preponderance of\r\npedal," and so on. He generally has as good an ear for music as a\r\nparish priest who only knew two tunes: one of which was "God save the\r\nQueen," and the other wasn\'t. And once, when a brass band was playing\r\na selection outside the vicarage, he went on to his balcony, hat in\r\nhand, and waved it vigorously as he commenced to sing the first line\r\nof "God save the Queen."\r\n\r\nWell, it does not matter after all. The only object is to appear\r\nlearned, and to use long words. If the artists do not like being\r\nignorantly criticized they must forbear to appear in public, a result\r\nwhich would incline us to go and shake hands with the reporters all\r\nround in the exuberance of our gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON DANCING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was looking through a "Querist Album" the other day; one of those\r\ndreadful confession books in which you are required to answer the most\r\nabsurd questions. Dreadful indeed they are to write in, but not\r\naltogether uninteresting to peruse, though the interest comes not so\r\nmuch in the answers themselves as in the manner in which they are\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nSome go in for it seriously, and describe their inmost feelings on the\r\npages; some take a witty strain, and put down the most ridiculous\r\nthings they can think of; while others write just what comes first.\r\n\r\nSome are such hypocrites, too. Here is a man who describes his wife as\r\nhis ideal woman; and when we know that he scarcely ever addresses a\r\ncivil word to the poor little woman, his admission is, to say the\r\nleast of it, amusing.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever been in love? and if so, how often?" This is one of the\r\nquestions. The answers to it are of doubtful veracity. All the single\r\nladies reply "Never!" underlining the word three times. "Yes, only\r\nonce," is the statement of the married ones. According to the Querist\r\nAlbum, "The course of true love _always_ runs smooth." No one seems to\r\nbe attacked by Cupid but they must immediately marry the object of\r\ntheir choice, and "all goes merrily as a marriage bell." The men, on\r\nthe contrary, like to appear somewhat inflammable. It is generally the\r\nmasculine writers who adopt the sprightly key. Twenty--forty--thousands\r\nof times they admit falling in love. Such one-sided affairs they must\r\nhave been, too; for the girls, according to their own confessions, never\r\nreciprocated any attachment until their rightful lords and masters appeared\r\non the scene. I am afraid we must be a very hard-hearted race!\r\n\r\nBut it is the question relating to your idea of "the greatest earthly\r\nhappiness" that struck me most. "Never being called in the morning,"\r\nwas one lazy person\'s reply. "To write M.P. after my name," was the\r\nambition of another. "Married life," wrote the bride on the completion\r\nof her honeymoon. Ah, little bride, you have been married some years\r\nnow. Are your ideas still the same, I wonder? "A good partner, a good\r\nfloor, and good music," said a fourth, and it is this one that has my\r\nentire sympathy. I agree with her. It is my idea also of "the greatest\r\nearthly happiness." I do not require much, you see. These are not very\r\ndifficult things to procure now-a-days; and yet I am often taunted\r\nwith my love of dancing. If I express disapproval of a man, "I suppose\r\nhe can\'t dance," they say with a sneer.\r\n\r\nNow though that accomplishment is a necessity in a ball-room, I do\r\n_not_ consider it indispensable in a husband. Unfortunately you cannot\r\ndance through life. I wish you could for many reasons. A continual\r\nchange of partners, for instance, would it not be refreshing? You\r\nwould scarcely have time to grow tired of them. And how much more\r\npolite our husbands would be if they thought we were only fleeting\r\njoys! What am I saying? I am shocking everyone I am afraid; the\r\nlittle matron who advocates married life, the newly-made brides whose\r\nideal men are realized in their husbands--I am shocking them all! I\r\nhumbly plead forgiveness. You see, I am not married myself. I can only\r\ngive my impressions as a looker-on, and, as Thackeray says, "One is\r\nbound to speak the truth as far as one knows it, and a deal of\r\ndisagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an\r\nundertaking."\r\n\r\nBut dancing _is_ indispensable in a ball-room. If a man cannot dance\r\nhe should stay away, and not make an object of himself. Unfortunately,\r\nso many think they excel in the art when they have not the least idea\r\nof it. Again, with girls, dancing (in a ball-room only, of course)\r\ncomes before charm of manner, before wit, even before beauty. I know\r\ngirls, absolutely plain, with not a word to say for themselves, who\r\ndance every dance, while the walls of the room are lined with pretty\r\nfaces, and dismal-looking enough they are too, which is very foolish\r\nof them. They should have too much pride to show their discomfiture.\r\n\r\nMen have so much the best of it at dances--so everybody says. I am\r\nafraid I do not agree. I would not change our positions for anything.\r\nAfter all, a girl can nearly always dance with anyone she likes, and\r\npick and choose as well as the men--provided, of course, that she is\r\nan adept on the "light fantastic toe" herself.\r\n\r\nAnd think, on the other hand, what men go through! Reverse the order\r\nof things, as you are supposed to do at leap year dances--which\r\nsystem, however, is never properly carried out. But suppose you go up\r\nto a man and ask him for a dance, and he tells you with a smile that\r\n"he is very sorry, but really he has not one left." Suppose that the\r\nnext minute you see him give three to another girl, would you speak to\r\nthat man ever again? _Never!_ And yet this is what they constantly\r\nendure and, what is more, forgive.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you analyze it, what an absurd thing dancing is. Close\r\nyour ears to the music and look around you when a ball is at its\r\nheight. What motive, you foolishly wonder, could induce all these\r\npeople--who are supposed to possess an average amount of brains--to\r\nassemble together to clasp each other round the waist, twirl round\r\nand round up and down the room, suddenly stop, and hurry one after\r\nanother outside the dancing hall, seeking dark corners, secret\r\nretreats, anywhere away from the eyes of other men? "Ah, what a mad\r\nworld it is, my masters!"\r\n\r\nHow our grandmothers exclaim at the present mode of dancing!--they who\r\nused to consider round dances almost improper. How the programmes must\r\nastonish them, too; those engagement cards that did not exist fifty\r\nyears ago, and in their infancy were quite content to bear only two or\r\nthree names on their paper countenances. But now times have changed,\r\nand as they grow older they become most greedy little cards. They are\r\nnot only not content with being scribbled all over, but require two\r\nnames on the top of one another, and thus causing dissensions to\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of art in making up a programme. It is a mistake\r\nto be full up before you arrive. Someone may come whom you did not\r\nexpect, and then you have no dance to give him. Arrangement of a\r\nprogramme requires two or three seasons\' practice. There are the duty\r\ndances to be got through first; put them up early, so that they shall\r\nbe soon over, and then you have the good ones at the end to look\r\nforward to.\r\n\r\nEveryone has duty dances. There are your father\'s constituents,\r\nclients, patients, someone you are obliged to ingratiate, and these\r\nare generally the worst dancers in the room! One is so fat he shakes\r\nthe hall as he walks, and yet is just as eager to join the giddy\r\nthrong, and alas! to take you with him! Another resembles the little\r\ntin soldiers which schoolboys have such an affection for, in that he\r\nhas been gifted with large flat stands, twice the length of himself,\r\ninstead of feet. And oh, _how_ he kicks! Then there is the\r\ncomplimentary man, a creature who never opens his mouth without making\r\nor implying a compliment. Does he ever find anyone whom this system\r\npleases, I wonder! The only antidote I can find is to take no notice,\r\nand pretend not to understand that the pretty speeches are directed at\r\nyou. This discourages him after a time.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to get hold of a man\'s programme, and find out how you\r\nare represented there. They do not put down names, but describe\r\ncostumes, hoping thus to find their partners easier, but in reality\r\nplunging themselves into most hopeless perplexities. They scribble\r\ndown "pearl necklace," and find later that there are at least sixteen\r\nin the room, and so are worse off than if they had written the name.\r\n\r\nSome describe the personal appearance, but this is a very risky thing\r\nto do. A man the other day wrote down his partner as "Miss blue dress,\r\nwith the nose," and subsequently dropped his programme, which, of\r\ncourse, was picked up by the lady mentioned. Now I do not know why you\r\nshould dislike being told that you have a nose--you would feel very\r\nmuch worse without one--but when your nasal organ takes up double its\r\nshare of room in your face, and is, moreover, prettily tinted with\r\nscarlet, which you try to conceal under a little pearl powder, and\r\nonly succeed in making it purple--well, perhaps you would not like to\r\nbe told you have a nose. At any rate, this lady did not, and hers very\r\nmuch resembled this description, I believe. But she was a wise woman.\r\nNot a word did she say on the subject, and he went home happily\r\nunconscious of her fatal discovery, until a few days later he\r\nreceived his programme back as a Christmas card, with "Miss blue dress\r\nwith the nose\'s compliments." How very comfortable he must have felt\r\nwhen he met her next!\r\n\r\nWhat a great many different styles of dancing there are! You have to\r\nchange your step with nearly every partner. The girl should always\r\nsuit hers to the man\'s, he has quite enough to do with the steering.\r\nYou require about five good partners altogether, and can then spend an\r\nenjoyable evening. A different man for every dance is tiring. You\r\nnever get beyond the theatres and the weather; you have not time to\r\nsay much more, and grow quite weary of the same style of conversation.\r\nI always think I must be a most uninteresting partner when I am asked\r\nwhat theatres I have been to lately, or what is my opinion of the\r\nAcademy, &c., &c. I never begin this kind of talk myself except as a\r\nlast resource, when I can get nothing else out of a man. Someone says,\r\nI forget who, that "a woman can always know in what opinion she is\r\nheld by the conversation addressed to her," and is it not true? The\r\nfoolish compliments paid to the pretty, but silly little _debutante_;\r\nthe small talk to the fools; the sparring with the witty; the _risque_\r\ntales enjoyed by those of a more rapid style. Men find out first what\r\nare our tastes, and then dish up their conversation accordingly, and\r\nthey do not often make mistakes.\r\n\r\nSome girls dance with one man the whole evening. How weary they must\r\nget of each other! Engaged people invariably pass the evening\r\ntogether, and sometimes do not dance at all, but sit out in some\r\nsecluded corner. They have to endure one another for years to come, I\r\nwonder they do not get as much variety as possible now. At any rate,\r\nthey might just as well stop at home.\r\n\r\nLike everything else, dancing is hurrying along, and growing faster\r\nevery year. The _deux-temps_, they say is coming back. May the day be\r\nfar ahead when that step reigns once more! Perhaps before then I shall\r\nbe converted into a chaperone, and shall sit watching others dance,\r\nnot being able to do so myself; or, perhaps worse, not being _asked_\r\nmyself. I am afraid I should not make a nice chaperone. I should look\r\nvery cross, and should hurry away as early as possible. Ah, sad indeed\r\nwill the day be when I give up dancing, when only the remembrance of\r\nmy past enjoyments will be brought back to me through the scent of\r\ngardenias and tube-roses, dear dissipated-smelling flowers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nON WATERING PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a great deal of trouble and time it takes to choose a\r\nwatering-place! And yet there are many and various kinds of resorts,\r\nsome for one season, some for another.\r\n\r\nIf you could be carried sufficiently high above the earth so as to\r\nhave a bird\'s-eye view of the whole of Great Britain, what a strange\r\nsight it would present during the months of August and September! The\r\ncounty would appear surrounded with a human fringe, the outer edge\r\nmore resembling a disturbed ants\' hill than anything else. I don\'t\r\nsuppose we should appear more significant than ants at that distance.\r\n\r\nThere are those places teeming with shop-keepers and children, when\r\nyou can scarcely see the beach so covered is it with those who are\r\nmaking the most of their one holiday in the year.\r\n\r\nThere is the primitive little village, discovered by few, which is\r\nwelcomed by the city man who wants rest and entire seclusion from\r\nbusiness matters and the world for a month or two. And oh, what\r\nlanguage he uses! and how annoyed he is to find absolutely nothing to\r\ndo--one post a day, and, worst of all, no newspaper until late in the\r\nafternoon! And this is the man who wishes to be shut out from the\r\nworld and from his acquaintances! There is no pier, there are no\r\namusements. The esplanade is composed of nothing more than a plank of\r\nwood, on which, in walking you have to observe much caution in order\r\nto keep your balance; and sometimes the butcher from the neighboring\r\nvillage forgets to call! In desperation, the unfortunate creature digs\r\nsand-castles with his children, and, after a few days of his\r\nbanishment, grows quite excited as the waves wash up and undermine\r\ntheir foundations. He picks acquaintance with anybody he comes across,\r\nbe he peer or peasant--anything to make the time pass a little quicker\r\nuntil he can return to the stir of his business life again.\r\n\r\nSomeone remarks somewhere that "a man works one-half of his life in\r\norder that he may rest the other." I wonder if those who are\r\nsuccessful ever appreciate their rest when they get it! I wonder if it\r\ncomes up to their expectations! if the goal toward which they have\r\nbeen looking almost since they began to exist is worth the trouble and\r\nenergy spent on it! Ah, I am afraid they very rarely find it so! They\r\nhave become so immured in their busy lives, that it is difficult to\r\ngrow accustomed to any other. Unless one is brought up to it, the\r\n_Dolce far niente_ is not an existence we enjoy. We are made the wrong\r\nway about somehow. We ought to be born old and gradually grow younger\r\nas the years roll on. Still, I daresay there would be something to\r\ncomplain of even then, and perhaps it would not be very dignified to\r\ngo off the stage as a baby!\r\n\r\nTo go to the opposite extreme, there are the fashionable water-places;\r\nlittle Londons, or rather little imitations of London; for beside that\r\ngreat capital itself they are like pieces of glass to a diamond. And\r\nyet fashion and folly are all here, sunning themselves by the sea\r\ninstead of in the park; driving up and down in the same way, in\r\nequally charming toilets. But still there seems to be something\r\nlacking, something wanting. They are too small, these towns; you so\r\nsoon know everyone by sight, and grow tired both of them and their\r\ncostumes. There is a good deal of stir and life about all the same.\r\nThere are bands, niggers, clairvoyantes, fire-eaters; plenty indeed\r\nfor you to see and hear when you are weary of strutting up and down\r\nand nodding to your friends. And yet, in spite of all, you grow tired\r\nof "London by the sea," after a few weeks, even in that dead season of\r\nthe year--November.\r\n\r\nHave you ever visited one of these places in the midst of a tennis\r\nweek, when the grand tournaments take place? Lawn tennis is a\r\ndelightful recreation for a time, provided you have a good partner and\r\ngood antagonists, and you are playing under a moderately warm sun; but\r\nwhen you hear, see, and play nothing else for a week, when the\r\nconversation is "tennis," when no one appears without a racquet in his\r\nhand, when all you have to listen to are criticisms on the courts and\r\nballs, grumblings against the handicapping, imprecations on\r\n"bisques"--well, you begin to hate the very name, and wish you could\r\ninjure the man who invented it. You grow tired of watching the same\r\nthing day after day, the men who spend their lives in tossing balls\r\nacross to each other, the sea of faces; turning backwards and forwards\r\nat each stroke with the regulation of a pendulum.\r\n\r\nYes, it takes a long time to decide on a watering place, and when at\r\nlast you do make up your mind you have to change it again very soon\r\nbecause you find all your "sisters, cousins, and aunts" have chosen\r\nthe same resort; and really you have quite enough of your relations in\r\ntown without their following you wherever you go. You require a little\r\nvariety when you go away. An old lady I used to know always kept it a\r\nprofound secret where she intended spending her summer holiday,\r\n"otherwise, my dear," she said, "I should have the whole family at my\r\nheels!" A most disagreeable old lady she was; and I know for a fact\r\nthat her relatives always avoided her when possible (she was not\r\nblessed with very great possessions!) so that her caution was quite\r\nunnecessary. Oh, vanity of vanities, how little we know of the world\'s\r\ntrue opinion of us!\r\n\r\nWhen you have fixed on your locality, there is even a greater\r\ndifficulty to go through. You have to choose your residence; and this\r\ntakes up even more thought and time.\r\n\r\nThere are the lodging-houses, monotonous in their similarity. The same\r\ngilt-edged mirrors protected from the dust by green perforated paper;\r\nthe same jar of wax flowers, standing on a mat which is composed of\r\nfloral designs in Berlin wool--designs to which you can give any name\r\nyou like--"You pays your money and you takes your choice." They\r\nrepresent anything, the whole concern hiding its modest head under a\r\nglass case; the same shavings in the grate, with long trails of roses\r\ngently slumbering on the top; yes, and the same voluble landlady, the\r\nwhole of whose private concerns you are in possession of five minutes\r\nafter you have taken the apartments.\r\n\r\nThere is the boarding-house, advertised as "Directly facing the sea;"\r\nand when you have engaged your rooms, and arrive with all your\r\nluggage, you find the establishment is at the far end of a side\r\nstreet; and "Directly facing the sea" is interpreted by the fact that\r\nby hanging half-way out of the sitting-room widow, and screwing your\r\nhead round violently to the left, you can see the place where that\r\nwatery monarch ought to be.\r\n\r\n"A boarding-house is so much nicer than an hotel, because you get to\r\nknow the people so much easier," I heard a girl remark once. This is\r\nmy chief objection to a boarding-house. Because you are staying under\r\nthe same roof, all the inhabitants consider they have a right to\r\naddress you, and, what is more, they will not be repulsed, which, as\r\nmost of them by no means move in the best society, is not at all\r\npalatable. The women you can tolerate, but the men are not to be\r\nendured. You are always coming across them, too. On whatever drive,\r\nexcursion, or trip you take you invariably meet "boarding-houseites,"\r\nwho are only too ready to recognize you. You can never get away from\r\nthem; there is only the public drawing-room, and there they come in\r\nand out, talking to you, interrupting you, or else causing your ears\r\nto ache by their attempts at music.(?)\r\n\r\nThe meals are somewhat amusing, as you can watch all your\r\nfellow-boarders without being disturbed. They cannot talk and eat at\r\nthe same time, and so philosophically devote all their energies to\r\ntheir dinner.\r\n\r\nThere is the girl who scrapes up acquaintances with everybody. She has\r\nhad the good luck to be placed near a man, and the demure way in which\r\nshe prattles and smiles at him convinces you that she is trying to\r\nmake the best use of her time. Sometimes he is absent, and then the\r\nsmiles give way to the gloomiest expression. Finally, on the arrival\r\nof new-comers, when there is a sort of general post all round, she is\r\nplaced at the farthest extreme to her late partner, and oh! the\r\nwistful little glances she passes up the table to the gourmand who,\r\noblivious to all but his dinner, scarcely notices her departure.\r\n\r\nThere are the three old maids, intent on capturing a husband. They\r\nhave come here as a last resource. But with the usual fickleness of\r\nfortune, they seem to be more shunned by the male sex than attracted\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThere is the newly-married couple, looking very conscious and silly,\r\nas if they were the only people in the world who had ever committed\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nThere is one old lady grumbling, and objecting to the back of a\r\nchicken. Poor birds, they have only two wings each, and really cannot\r\nprovide everybody with them! There is another furious, because on\r\nasking for a favorite dish, that is down in the _menu_, is told that\r\n"it is all served!" The best things always are, unless you manage to\r\nget into the good graces of the waiter or waitress.\r\n\r\nYoung men and maidens, old men and children, all here, offering plenty\r\nof material for students of human nature!\r\n\r\nHotel life is very different. Even if you find the _parvenu_ and\r\n_nouveau riche_ as equally objectionable as the boarding-house\r\nspecies, at least they do not force their acquaintance upon\r\nyou. The _table d\'hote_ is much more entertaining, and you are\r\naltogether more independent. Characters you come across occasionally\r\nthat are most interesting to study. There are the girls who are taking\r\nthe round of hotels by their mothers, in the hopes of getting them\r\n"off." There are the men who astonish everybody by their generosity\r\nand apparent display of riches, and finally decamp without paying\r\ntheir bill.\r\n\r\nA man was telling me the other day of a certain "black sheep" who had\r\nrun into difficulty; how his family after a great deal of trouble\r\nmanaged to raise L200 between them, and sent him off to America with\r\nthe money to start afresh in a new country. In a month\'s time he was\r\nback again, penniless as ever, and cursing his luck and bad fortune.\r\nIt was only by accident they discovered the bills of the best hotels\r\nin New York in his pocket, and found that he had been living like a\r\nprince while his L200 lasted, nor had tried at all to obtain any\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nWith such consummate cheek, a man ought to get on in the world, I\r\nthink, for after all it is self-confidence and "bluffing" that seems\r\nto succeed most. However down in the world you are, however bad your\r\n"hand," you only have to "bluff" a little to make it all right. There\r\nare many foolish people in the world ready to be your dupes, and\r\nluckily they never think of asking to "see" you. Even the best of us\r\ntry it on a little; we strive to hide our skeletons under the cloak of\r\ncheerfulness, and entirely disguise our real feelings--\r\n\r\n    "Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we;\r\n    For, such as we are made of, such we be."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Lazy Thoughts of a Lazy Girl, by Jenny Wren\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LAZY THOUGHTS OF A LAZY GIRL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 16507.txt or 16507.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/5/0/16507/\r\n\r\nProduced by Bill Tozier, Barbara Tozier, Sankar Viswanathan,\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttps://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
