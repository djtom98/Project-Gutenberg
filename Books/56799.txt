Zola\'s novel, \'La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle,\'\r\nappeared in \'The Weekly Times and Echo,\' in which it was originally\r\nissued, the author was interviewed for that journal by Mr. Robert H.\r\nSherard, whom he favoured with some interesting particulars concerning\r\nthe scope and purport of his narrative. By the courtesy both of Mr.\r\nSherard and of the proprietor of \'The Weekly Times,\' the translator\r\nis here able to republish the remarks made by M. Zola on the occasion\r\nreferred to. They will be found to supply an appropriate preface to the\r\nstory:--\r\n\r\n\'"La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle" has given me infinitely more trouble than any of my\r\nprevious works. When I began writing it, I had no conception of the\r\nimmensity of the task which I had imposed on myself. The labour of\r\nreading up all that has been written on my subject in general, and on\r\nthe battle of Sedan in particular, has been enormous, and the work\r\nof condensation of all that I have had to read has been all the more\r\nlaborious that on no subject has more divergence of opinion been\r\nexpressed ... I have read all that has been written about the battle\r\nof Sedan, as well as about the unhappy adventures of the luckless\r\nSeventh Army Corps, in which is placed the fictitious regiment which\r\nplays the leading _r\xc3\xb4le_ in my novel. And the digestion has not been\r\nan easy task. Each general, for instance, has a different version to\r\ngive of the why and the wherefore of the defeat. Each claims to have\r\nhad a plan, which, if it had been followed, would have averted the\r\ndisaster. Another difficulty has been that I took no part in that\r\ncampaign, not having been a soldier, and that for my information on the\r\nlife and experience of those who went through the campaign in general,\r\nand the battle of Sedan in particular, I have had to depend on outside\r\ntestimony, often of a conflicting nature. I may say, however, that\r\nin this matter I have been greatly helped by the kindness of persons\r\nwho are good enough to be interested in my work, and as soon as it\r\nbecame known that I was writing a book about the war and about Sedan,\r\nI received from all parts of France manuscript relations written by\r\npeople of all classes who had been present at the battle, and who sent\r\nme their recollections. That was most excellent material--indeed, the\r\nbest, because not to be found anywhere else. An "Anecdotal Account of\r\nthe Battle of Sedan" was sent me by a gentleman who is now professor at\r\none of the Universities in the South. A long, ill-spelt letter came to\r\nme from a gamekeeper in the North, in which he gave me a full account\r\nof the battle as it impressed him, who was a private soldier in the\r\nSeventh Army Corps at the time. I have masses of such documents, and it\r\nwas my duty to go through everything that could throw any light on my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\'The subject was to be War. I had to consider War in its relation\r\nto various classes of society--War _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ the bourgeois, War\r\n_vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ the peasant, War _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ the workman. How the war\r\nwas brought about--that is to say, the state of mind of men in\r\nFrance at the time--was a consideration which also supplied me with\r\na number of characters. I had to show, in a series of types, France\r\nwho had lost the use of liberty, France drunk with pleasure, France\r\nfated irrevocably to disaster. I had to have types to show France so\r\nprompt to enthusiasm, so prompt to despair. And then there were to be\r\nshown the immense faults committed, and to show by character how the\r\ncommission of such faults was possible, a natural sequence of a certain\r\npsychological state of mind of a certain preponderating class, which\r\nexisted in the last days of the Empire. Then each phase of action had\r\nto be typified. The question of the Emperor and his surroundings--I\r\nhad to have characters to explain "the sick man" and his state at the\r\ntime. I had to show how it was with the peasants of the period, and\r\nhence to equip a character or two for that purpose. The Francs-tireurs\r\nplayed an important part in the epoch; it therefore became necessary\r\nfor me to incarnate these, to create a typical Franc-tireur. The spies\r\nand spying had their influence on the whole; I had to have a spy. By\r\nthe way, the spy in my book is one of the few German characters that\r\nI have created--four or five--this spy and an officer or two. Then,\r\nhaving thus, with a stroke of the rake, dragged together all that I\r\ncould find as likely to illustrate my period, both historically and\r\npsychologically considered, I wrote out rapidly--the work of one\r\nfeverish morning--a _maquette_, or rough draft of all I wanted to do,\r\nsome fifteen or twenty pages.\r\n\r\n\'It then became necessary to see the places, to study the geography\r\nof my book, for at that period I did not know where my scenes were to\r\nbe laid, whether on the banks of the Rhine, or elsewhere. So, with my\r\nrough draft in my pocket, and my head teeming with the shadows of my\r\nmarionettes, and of the things that they were to do and to explain, I\r\nset off for Rheims and went carefully over the whole ground, driving\r\nfrom Rheims to Sedan, and following foot by foot the road by which the\r\nSeventh Corps--already then decided upon as the _milieu_ in which my\r\nnovel was to develop--marched to their disaster. During that drive I\r\npicked up an immense quantity of material, halting in farmhouses and\r\npeasants\' cottages, and taking copious notes. Then came Sedan, and\r\nafter a careful study of the place and the people, I saw that my novel\r\nmust deal largely, for the full comprehension of my story, not only\r\nwith the locality, but with the people of the town. This gave me the\r\n_bourgeois_ of Sedan, who play an important part in my tale. Little\r\nby little, the geography gave me also the physiology of my book. Each\r\nnew place that it became necessary to describe supplied its type, its\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\'So, on my return to Paris, I was in an immense workshop or yard\r\nsurrounded with huge mountains of hewn stones, mortar and bricks, and\r\nall that remained then to do was to build the best structure that I\r\ncould build of these materials. But before that, the architect\'s plan\r\nwas necessary, and that I next carefully evolved. My plan of work is\r\nmost rigorous. Each chapter is marked out in advance, but it is only\r\nas I am writing that the various incidents which I have collected fall\r\ninto place.... My labour has been one of reconciliation of divergent\r\nstatements in the first place, and of condensation in the second. I\r\nhad to reduce to one page what I could easily, and without prolixity,\r\nhave treated in a dozen pages; so that with each page, nay with each\r\nsentence, I have been confronted with the question what to leave out\r\nand what to say. Then, when each page was written, I began to torture\r\nmyself with the doubt whether I had left unsaid things I ought to have\r\nsaid, whether I had sacrificed good to inferior material.\r\n\r\n\'"La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle" is divided into three parts. The first part treats of the\r\naction of the luckless Seventh Army Corps, in which is the fictitious\r\nregiment in which my hero or heroes are placed. I say heroes, because\r\nI have really two heroes in this story. One is Jean, of my novel\r\n\'La Terre,\' who is a corporal in this regiment; the other is a new\r\ncharacter named Maurice, who goes through Sedan as a private soldier.\r\nBetween these two men a great friendship exists, and, indeed, it is\r\nfrom this friendship in the face of death and danger, this comradeship\r\nof arms _malgr\xc3\xa9 tout_, that I draw the chief effects of sentiment with\r\nwhich my novel is seasoned. For "La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle" is not a love story.\r\nThe female characters in it play only secondary _r\xc3\xb4les_; there is no\r\nlove-making worth speaking about, at the most, only the "intention" of\r\nlove, the indication of courtship. Jean and Maurice, my two heroes,\r\nmoreover, present types of the France of the day. Maurice, who is\r\nrepresented as a young man who has recently been admitted to the bar,\r\nis the man of the world--light, cynical, sceptical, the type of the\r\nFrance of the Empire, embodying her grace and her faults. He is the\r\ntype of the France that, sated with pleasure, rushed to disaster. Jean\r\nrepresents the new social _couche_, a new stratum, and is in some way\r\nemblematic of the France of the future. Now, I will confess that when I\r\nbegan writing my book, and had this idea of this friendship, I expected\r\nto be able to produce by its means a much greater effect than I think\r\nI have done. This friendship has not yielded all that I had hoped for\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\'The first section of eight chapters opens with allusion to the\r\ntrifling defeats on the frontier, it shows the Seventh Corps crowded\r\nback on to Rheims; but the principal subject of these chapters is the\r\nterrible march from Rheims to Sedan. It is an epic event, pregnant with\r\nthe irony of fate, and, to my thinking, one of the most tragic military\r\nepisodes that history records. There is no fighting described in this\r\npart; indeed, the only battle that I describe is Sedan. The tragedy\r\nlies in the exposition of the faults that gradually led up to the\r\nterrible disaster. The reader follows the movements of this ill-fated\r\ncorps, knowing what a terrible shadow of defeat, disaster, and death\r\noverhangs it. It was a wonderful corps, and the way it was managed was\r\nwonderful in its crass stupidity.\r\n\r\n\'My second part is entirely devoted to a description of the battle of\r\nSedan in all its phases, seen from all sides. I have omitted nothing\r\nwhich can help to a comprehension of that enormous episode in the\r\nhistories of France and of the world. Now we are with Napoleon, now\r\nwith the Emperor of Germany, now with the _bourgeois_ of Sedan, now\r\nwith the Francs-tireurs in the woods. Each movement of troops that\r\ncontributed to the final _d\xc3\xa9nouement_ is exposed. I have endeavoured to\r\nbe complete, but as I have said, I had too little space for the immense\r\namount of material in my hands. I have also endeavoured to speak the\r\nplain truth without either fear or favour. The reader will be aroused\r\nto compassion with the sufferings, bodily and mental, of the heroic\r\nand martyred army, just as he will be aroused to indignation at the\r\nconduct of its chiefs, which fell little short of downright dementia.\r\nIt has been my duty to be severely critical, and I have not shrunk from\r\nthe responsibility of wounding, where it was right and just to do so,\r\nsusceptibilities which I see no reason for respecting. I dare say there\r\nwill be some outcry at my blame, but I am indifferent, having spoken\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\'The last part of my novel is played out in Sedan, after the battle.\r\nFrom thence the reader follows the rest of the history of the war as\r\nit develops itself in other parts of France, until it culminates in\r\nthe outbreak of the Commune and the final collapse of Paris in a sea\r\nof fire and an ocean of blood. The last chapter of the book is an\r\naccount of Paris in flames, of Paris with its gutters running with\r\nblood. I hope by this means to produce a gradation of effect--the\r\ncatastrophe of Sedan, which ends the second part, followed up by the\r\nstill greater catastrophe of the last chapter. To resume: The first\r\npart of my novel is the march from Rheims to Sedan; the second is the\r\ncatastrophe of Sedan, from inception to _d\xc3\xa9nouement_; and the third the\r\ncollapse not of Paris alone, but of the whole of old-time France, with\r\nthe _d\xc3\xa9nouement_ of the burning of Paris, the flames of which clear\r\naway not only an old _r\xc3\xa9gime_, but a whole psychological state, and\r\nprepare a fresh field for a new and regenerated people. For observe,\r\nthat my book, as far as outward construction goes, divided into three\r\nparts, may also be divided into a novel of historical and a novel of\r\npsychological interest. It tells a tale of many adventures, but it also\r\naims to give a full list of psychological studies of French society as\r\nit was at the outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n\'My novels have always been written with a higher aim than merely\r\nto amuse. I have so high an opinion of the novel as a means of\r\nexpression--I consider it parallel with lyrical poetry, as the highest\r\nform of literary expression, just as in the last century the drama was\r\nthe highest form of expression--that it is on this account that I have\r\nchosen it as the form in which to present to the world what I wish to\r\nsay on the social, scientific, and psychological problems that occupy\r\nthe minds of thinking men. But for this I might have said what I wanted\r\nto say to the world in another form. But the novel has to-day risen\r\nfrom the place which it held in the last century at the table of the\r\nbanquet of letters. It was then the idle pastime of the hour, and sat\r\nlow down between the fable and the idyll. To-day it contains, or may be\r\nmade to contain, everything; and it is because that is my creed that I\r\nam a novelist. I have, to my thinking, certain contributions to make\r\nto the thought of the world on certain subjects, and I have chosen\r\nthe novel as the best way of communicating these contributions to the\r\nworld. Thus "La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle," in the form of a very precise and accurate\r\nrelation of a series of historical facts--in other words, in the form\r\nof a realistic historical novel--is a document on the psychology of\r\nFrance in 1870. This will explain the enormous number of characters\r\nwhich figure in the book. Each character represents one _\xc3\xa9tat d\'\xc3\xa2me\r\npsychologique_ of the France of the day. If my work be well done, the\r\nreader will be able to understand what was in men\'s minds and what was\r\nthe bent of men\'s minds--what they thought, and how they thought, at\r\nthat period.\'\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected with a work dealing with such a question as\r\nthe last Franco-German War, \'La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle\' has given rise to considerable\r\ncontroversy in France. Some ultra-bellicose Frenchmen, and among them\r\nM. de Vogue of the Academy, have taunted the author with a lack of\r\npatriotism, their notion being apparently that they ought never to be\r\ntold the truth concerning themselves. Other persons have impeached\r\nM. Zola\'s accuracy with regard to various matters of detail, and a\r\nfew have gone so far as to accuse him of having written that which he\r\nmust have known to be untrue. It may be as well to notice some of the\r\ncharges here.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there are no hop-gardens on the road from Mulhausen\r\nto Altkirch, as will be found stated in Chapter II. (Part I.), and\r\nin this instance it would really appear that M. Zola has fallen into\r\nerror. Viewing the road from a distance, and being very short-sighted,\r\nhe doubtless mistook vineyards for hop-grounds. The error is in some\r\ndegree excusable, however, when it is remembered that in this part of\r\nAlsace the vines are trained to poles ten and eleven feet high. It\r\nis also denied that vast sums of money were distributed among the men\r\nof the Seventh Army Corps without any written acknowledgment at the\r\nclose of the battle of Sedan, as will be found stated in Chapter VII.\r\n(Part II.). I have reason to believe that it was the money of another\r\narmy corps which was thus distributed, and that M. Zola transposed the\r\nincident for the purposes of his story. A little license of this kind\r\nis surely allowable in a work of fiction. M. Paul de Cassagnac, the\r\nwell-known Bonapartist politician and journalist, denies that Napoleon\r\nIII. had his face rouged and powdered on the morning of the battle\r\nof Sedan (Sept. 1), in proof of which he mentions that he was with\r\nNapoleon during the whole of the battle of Mouzon (Aug. 30), and also\r\nfrequently ate at the Imperial table during the campaign. M. Zola does\r\nnot state that Napoleon habitually painted his face. He says (Chapters\r\nI. and III., Part II.) that he did so on one occasion only, early on\r\nthe morning of Sept. 1, and that the rouge, &c, was entirely washed\r\naway by perspiration at 11 a.m., when he returned into the town from\r\nthe front. The battle of Mouzon and what occurred at other times during\r\nthe campaign have nothing to do with the matter, and M. de Cassagnac\'s\r\nso-called denial is beside the question. The same may be said of the\r\ndenials of M. Robert Mitchell, another Bonapartist politician and\r\njournalist, and of the Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, daughter of King\r\nJer\xc3\xb4me. The princess was not even at Sedan, and can know nothing of\r\nthe matter. Moreover, is it likely that she would admit the accuracy\r\nof any statement at all disparaging to the memory of Napoleon III.?\r\nIs it likely that M. de Cassagnac would do so? Or M. Robert Mitchell\r\neither? These gentlemen upheld the Imperial _r\xc3\xa9gime_ through thick and\r\nthin, and the former, at any rate, was most liberally rewarded for his\r\nservices. He has, therefore, good reason to be prejudiced. M. Zola\r\ndeclares that he had the information in dispute in part from \'a certain\r\nlady,\' and in part from various people of Sedan, and so far there is\r\nnothing to prove that it is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nI may, perhaps, be allowed to add that I have given considerable time\r\nand care to the translation of \'La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle.\' I have always tried to\r\ngive the sense and substance of M. Zola\'s narrative, though at times\r\nI have found myself unable to use his actual words. In matters of\r\ntranslation, however, I am of the opinion of Thackeray, which was also\r\nthat expressed by James Howell in one of his often-quoted \'Familiar\r\nLetters.\' Here and there I have appended to the text some notes which\r\nmay assist the reader, for whose benefit the publishers have provided\r\ntwo sketch-maps of the battle of Sedan.\r\n\r\n E.

In the twilight of a\r\nsultry day in August, under the dull sky, across which heavy clouds\r\nwere drifting, the rows of shelter-tents could be seen stretching out\r\namid a broad expanse of ploughed land. At regular intervals along the\r\nfront gleamed the piles of arms, guarded by sentinels with loaded\r\nrifles, who stood there stock-still, their eyes fixed dreamily on the\r\nviolet-tinted mist which was rising from the great river on the far\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nThe men had arrived from Belfort at about five o\' clock. It was now\r\neight, and they had only just received their rations. The firewood,\r\nhowever, had apparently gone astray, for none had been distributed, so\r\nthat there was neither fire nor _soupe_. The men had been obliged to\r\nmunch their hard, dry biscuit, washing it down with copious draughts\r\nof brandy, which had dealt the last blow, as it were, to their failing\r\nlegs, already nerveless through fatigue. Near the canteen, however,\r\nbeyond the stacks of arms, two men were stubbornly endeavouring to\r\nlight some green wood--a pile of young tree trunks, which they had cut\r\ndown with their sword-bayonets, and which obstinately refused to blaze.\r\nMerely a coil of thick black smoke of lugubrious aspect ascended from\r\nthe heap into the evening air.\r\n\r\nThere were here only 12,000 men, all that General F\xc3\xa9lix Douay had\r\nwith him of the Seventh Army Corps. The first division, summoned by\r\nMacMahon the day before, had started for Fr\xc5\x93schweiler; the third was\r\nstill at Lyons; and the general had resolved to leave Belfort and\r\nadvance to the front with merely the second division, supported by\r\nthe reserve artillery and an incomplete division of horse. Camp fires\r\nhad been signalled at Lorrach, and the Sub-Prefect of Schelestadt\r\nhad telegraphed that the Prussians were about to cross the Rhine at\r\nMargolsheim. The general, who realised how dangerous was his isolated\r\nposition at the extreme right of the other army corps, with none of\r\nwhich he was in communication, had hastened his advance to the frontier\r\nthe more rapidly, as news had reached him, the day before, of the\r\ndisastrous surprise of Weissenburg. Even supposing he did not have to\r\nresist an attack on his own lines, it was now to be feared that he\r\nmight at any moment be called upon to support the First Army Corps.[1]\r\nThat very day--that disquieting, stormy Saturday, August 6--there must\r\nhave been fighting somewhere, most probably near Fr\xc5\x93schweiler. There\r\nwere signs of it in the air, in the heavy, restless sky across which\r\nthere now and again swept a chilly shudder--a sudden gust of wind which\r\npassed by moaning, as if with anguish. For the past two days the troops\r\nhad been convinced that they were advancing to battle. They one and all\r\nexpected to find the Prussians in front of them at the end of their\r\nforced march from Belfort to Mulhausen.\r\n\r\nThe daylight was waning, when, from a distant corner of the camp, the\r\ntattoo sounded--a roll of the drums followed by a bugle call, faint\r\nas yet, wafted away, as it was, through the open air. It was heard,\r\nhowever, by Jean Macquart,[2] who had been endeavouring to strengthen\r\nhis tent by driving the pickets deeper into the ground, and who now\r\nrapidly rose to his feet. Still bleeding from the grievous tragedy in\r\nwhich he had lost Fran\xc3\xa7oise, his wife, and the land she had brought\r\nhim in marriage, he had left Rognes, and, although nine-and-thirty\r\nyears of age, had re-enlisted at the first rumour of war. Immediately\r\nenrolled, with his old rank of corporal, in the 106th Regiment of the\r\nInfantry of the Line, then being brought up to its full strength, Jean\r\nsometimes felt astonished to find himself again in uniform--he who had\r\nbeen so delighted to leave the service after the battle of Solferino,\r\nso pleased to cease playing the swashbuckler, the part of the man who\r\nkills. But what is a fellow to do when he has no trade or profession\r\nleft him, neither wife nor even a scrap of property that he can call\r\nhis own in all the wide world, and when grief and rage bring his heart\r\nwith a leap into his very throat? Surely he has a right to trounce\r\nhis country\'s enemies, especially if they plague him. Besides, Jean\r\nremembered the cry he had raised: \'Ah! dash it all, he would defend the\r\nold soil of France, since he no longer had courage enough to till it!\'\r\n\r\nOn rising up he glanced at the camp, where a final stir was being\r\noccasioned by the passage of the tattoo party. Some men were running to\r\ntheir quarters; others, already drowsy, sat up or stretched themselves\r\nout with an air of irritated weariness; whilst Jean, the patient\r\nfellow, awaited the roll-call with that well-balanced tranquillity of\r\nmind which made him such a capital soldier. His comrades said he would\r\nprobably have risen rapidly in rank had he been more of a scholar, but\r\nit happened that he only just knew how to read and write, and he did\r\nnot even covet a sergeant\'s stripes. He who has been a peasant always\r\nremains one.\r\n\r\nJean was concerned at the sight of the green logs which were still\r\nsmoking, and called to the two men--Loubet and Lapoulle, both belonging\r\nto his squad--who were desperately endeavouring to kindle the fire:\r\n\'Just let that be. You\'re poisoning us with that smoke.\'\r\n\r\nLoubet, who was lithe and active, with the look of a wag, sneeringly\r\nreplied, \'It\'s catching alight, corporal; I assure you it is.\' And\r\ngiving his comrade Lapoulle a push, he added, \'Here, _you_, why don\'t\r\nyou blow?\'\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Lapoulle, a perfect colossus, was exhausting himself\r\nin his efforts to raise a tempest, with his cheeks puffed out like\r\ngoat-skins full of liquor, his whole face suffused by a rush of blood,\r\nand his eyes red and full of tears. Two other men of the squad,\r\nChouteau and Pache--the former of whom lay on his back like a lazybones\r\nfond of his ease, whilst the other had assumed a crouching posture that\r\nhe might carefully repair a rent in his trousers--were greatly amused\r\nby the fearful grimace which that brute Lapoulle was making, and burst\r\nat last into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\nJean let them laugh. There would, perhaps, not be many more\r\nopportunities for gaiety; and despite the serious expression which\r\nsat on his full, round, regular-featured face, he was by no means a\r\npartisan of melancholy. Indeed, he closed his eyes readily enough\r\nwhenever his men wished to amuse themselves. However, another group\r\nnow attracted his attention. For nearly an hour one of the privates\r\nof his squad, Maurice Levasseur, had been chatting with a civilian, a\r\nred-haired individual, looking some six-and-thirty years of age, with a\r\ngood-dog-Tray sort of face, and large blue goggle eyes--short-sighted\r\neyes, which had led to his being exempted from military service. A\r\nquartermaster of the reserve artillery, who with his dark moustache and\r\nimperial had a bold confident air, had joined the couple; and the three\r\nof them tarried there, making themselves at home.\r\n\r\nTo spare them a reprimand, Jean, in his obliging way, thought it his\r\nduty to intervene. \'You would do well to leave, sir,\' he said to the\r\ncivilian. \'Here comes the tattoo, and if the lieutenant saw you----\'\r\n\r\nMaurice did not let him finish. \'Don\'t go, Weiss,\' said he; and,\r\naddressing the corporal, he dryly added, \'This gentleman is my\r\nbrother-in-law. The colonel knows him, and has given him permission to\r\nremain in camp.\'\r\n\r\nWhy did this peasant, Jean Macquart, whose hands still smelt of the\r\ndungheap, interfere in a matter that did not concern him? thought\r\nMaurice. He, who had been called to the bar during the previous autumn,\r\nand who, on joining the army as a volunteer, had been forthwith\r\nenrolled in the 106th of the Line, thanks to the colonel\'s protection,\r\nand without having to undergo the usual probation at the dep\xc3\xb4t--carried\r\nhis knapsack willingly enough; but, at the very outset, a feeling of\r\nrepugnance, of covert revolt, had turned him against this illiterate\r\ncorporal, the clodhopper who commanded him.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' retorted Jean, in his quiet way. \'Get yourselves caught. I\r\ndon\'t care a rap.\'\r\n\r\nThen he abruptly faced about on finding that Maurice had not told him\r\na fib; for at that very moment the colonel, M. de Vineuil, whose long\r\nyellow face was intersected by bushy white moustaches, passed by with\r\nthat grand aristocratic air of his, and acknowledged the salute of\r\nWeiss and Maurice with a smile. The colonel was walking rapidly towards\r\na farmhouse which peeped out from among some plum trees on the right\r\nhand, a few hundred paces away. The staff was installed there for the\r\nnight, but no one knew whether the commander of the Army Corps--struck\r\ndown by the grievous tidings that his brother had been killed at\r\nWeissenburg[3]--was there or not. Major-General Bourgain-Desfeuilles,\r\nto whose brigade the 106th Regiment belonged, was, however, assuredly\r\nat the farm, brawling no doubt according to his wont, with his huge\r\nbelly swaying to and fro atop of his diminutive legs, and with his face\r\nhighly coloured, like the face of one fond of the table, who is not\r\ntroubled with any excess of brains. There was an increasing stir around\r\nthe farmhouse; every minute or so estafettes were galloping off and\r\nreturning; and feverish, indeed, were the long hours of waiting for the\r\nbelated telegrams that were expected to bring news of the great battle,\r\nwhich since daybreak everyone had deemed inevitable and proximate.\r\nWhere had it been fought, and how had it resulted? By degrees, as the\r\nnight fell, it seemed as though the spirit of anxiety were brooding\r\nover the orchards, over the scattered stacks, and around the cow-sheds,\r\nspreading itself out on all sides like a shadowy sea. The men told one\r\nanother that a Prussian spy had been caught prowling about the camp,\r\nand had been conducted to the farm to be questioned by the general. If\r\nColonel de Vineuil ran there so fast it was, perhaps, because he had\r\nreceived a telegram.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maurice Levasseur had begun to chat again with his\r\nbrother-in-law Weiss, and his cousin Honor\xc3\xa9 Fouchard, the\r\nquartermaster. The tattoo party, coming from afar off with its numbers\r\ngradually strengthened, passed near them, drumming and trumpeting\r\nin the melancholy twilight peacefulness; and yet they did not seem\r\nto hear it even. Grandson of a hero of the First Napoleon\'s armies,\r\nMaurice was born at Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux, in the Argonne. His father,\r\nbeing turned away from the paths of glory, had sunk down to a meagre\r\ntax-collectorship; and his mother, a peasant woman, had expired in\r\nbringing him and his twin sister, Henriette, into the world. If Maurice\r\nhad enlisted in the army, it was because of grave offences, the outcome\r\nof a course of dissipation in which his weak, excitable nature had\r\nembarked at the time when he had repaired to Paris to read for the\r\nbar, and when his relatives had pinched and stinted themselves to\r\nmake a gentleman of him. But he had squandered their money in gaming,\r\non women, and on the thousand and one follies of the all-devouring\r\ncity, and his conduct had hastened his father\'s death. His sister,\r\nafter parting with her all to pay his debts, had been lucky enough to\r\nsecure a husband, that honest fellow Weiss, an Alsatian of Mulhausen,\r\nwho had long been an accountant at the refinery of Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux,\r\nand was now an overseer in the employ of M. Delaherche, owner of one\r\nof the principal cloth-weaving establishments of Sedan. Maurice, who\r\nwith his nervous nature was seized as promptly with hope as with\r\ndespair, who was both generous and enthusiastic, but utterly devoid of\r\nstability--the slave indeed of each shifting, passing breeze--imagined\r\nthat he was now quite cured of his follies. Fair and short, with an\r\nunusually large forehead, a small nose and chin, and generally refined\r\nfeatures, he had grey, caressing eyes, in which there gleamed at times\r\na spark of madness.\r\n\r\nWeiss had hastened to Mulhausen on the eve of hostilities, having\r\nsuddenly become desirous of settling some family affair; and if he had\r\navailed himself of Colonel de Vineuil\'s kindness, in order to shake\r\nhands with his brother-in-law, Maurice, it was because the colonel\r\nhappened to be the uncle of young Madame Delaherche, a pretty widow,\r\nwhom the cloth merchant of Sedan had married the year before, and whom\r\nboth Maurice and Henriette had known when she was a child, her parents\r\nthen being neighbours of their own. Besides the colonel, Maurice had\r\ncome across another of Madame Delaherche\'s connections in the person\r\nof Captain Beaudoin, who commanded his company, and who had been this\r\nlady\'s most intimate friend, it was insinuated, at the time when she\r\nwas Madame Maginot of M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, wife of M. Maginot, inspector of the\r\nState forest.\r\n\r\n\'Mind you kiss Henriette for me,\' said Maurice, again and again--he\r\nwas, indeed, passionately fond of his sister--\'tell her she will have\r\nevery reason to be pleased, and that I want to make her proud of me.\'\r\n\r\nTears filled his eyes as he thought of his foolish conduct in Paris;\r\nbut his brother-in-law, touched in his turn, changed the conversation\r\nby saying to Honor\xc3\xa9 Fouchard, the artilleryman: \'The first time I pass\r\nby Remilly I shall run up and tell uncle Fouchard that I saw you and\r\nfound you well.\'\r\n\r\nUncle Fouchard, a peasant with a little land of his own, who plied\r\nthe calling of itinerant village butcher, was a brother of Maurice\'s\r\nmother. He lived at Remilly, right at the top of the hill, at four\r\nmiles or so from Sedan.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Honor\xc3\xa9, quietly; \'the old man doesn\'t care a rap\r\nabout me, but, if it pleases you, you can go to see him.\'\r\n\r\nJust at that moment there was a stir in front of the farmhouse, and\r\nthey saw the prowler--the man accused of being a Prussian spy--come\r\nout, accompanied by an officer. He had no doubt produced some papers,\r\nrelated some plausible tale or other, for he was no longer under\r\narrest--the officer was simply turning him out of the camp. At that\r\ndistance, in the impending darkness, one could only vaguely distinguish\r\nhis huge, square-built figure and tawny head. Maurice, however,\r\nimpetuously exclaimed: \'Look there, Honor\xc3\xa9. Isn\'t that fellow like the\r\nPrussian--you know the man I mean--Goliath?\'\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster started on hearing this name, and fixed his ardent\r\neyes upon the supposed spy. This mention of Goliath Steinberg, the\r\nslaughterman, the rascal who had made bad blood between himself and\r\nhis father, who had robbed him of his sweetheart Silvine, had revived\r\nall the horrible story--the filthy abomination that still caused him\r\nso much suffering--and he felt a sudden impulse to run after the man\r\nand strangle him. But the spy, if such he was, had already passed\r\nbeyond the camp lines, and, walking rapidly away, soon vanished in the\r\ndarkness of the night.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! Goliath,\' muttered Honor\xc3\xa9; \'it isn\'t possible. He must be over\r\nthere with the others. Ah! if ever I meet him----\'\r\n\r\nAnd with a threatening gesture he pointed to the darkening horizon, the\r\nviolet-tinted eastern sky which to him meant Prussia.\r\n\r\nThey all relapsed into silence, and the tattoo was again heard afar\r\noff, at the other end of the camp. \'Blazes!\' resumed Honor\xc3\xa9, \'I shall\r\nget into trouble if I\'m not back for the roll call. Good night.\r\nGood-bye to all!\' Then having once more pressed Weiss\'s hands he\r\nhastily strode away towards the hillock where the reserve artillery was\r\nmassed; he had not again mentioned his father, nor had he even sent any\r\nmessage to Silvine, whose name burnt his lips.\r\n\r\nA few minutes had elapsed, when a bugle call was heard on the left,\r\nnear the quarters of the second brigade. Another bugle nearer at hand\r\nreplied. Then a third rang out, afar off. They were all sounding, far\r\nand near, when Gaude, the bugler of Jean\'s company, made up his mind to\r\ndischarge a volley of sonorous notes. He was a big, skinny, sorrowful,\r\ntaciturn man, without a hair on his chin, and blew his instrument with\r\nthe lungs of a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nSergeant Sapin, an affected little fellow, with big dreamy eyes,\r\nbegan to call the roll, shouting out the men\'s names in a shrill\r\nvoice, whilst they, having drawn near to him, made answer in a variety\r\nof tones, now akin to the sound of a violoncello and now to that\r\nof a flute. A break, however, suddenly occurred in the responses.\r\n\'Lapoulle!\' repeated the sergeant, shouting as loud as he could.\r\nThere was still no answer, and Jean had to rush to the pile of green\r\nlogs, which Lapoulle, egged on by his comrades, was still obstinately\r\ntrying to ignite. Stretched there on his stomach, with his face quite\r\nscorched, he continued blowing away the smoke of the blackening wood.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' shouted Jean, \'just leave that alone and answer to your\r\nname.\'\r\n\r\nLapoulle sat up with a bewildered air, then appeared to understand, and\r\nfinally bellowed \'Present!\' in a voice so like that of a savage that\r\nLoubet fell flop on the ground, so amazingly funny did he consider the\r\nincident. Pache, who had finished his sewing, replied to his name in a\r\nscarcely audible voice as though he were mumbling a prayer. Chouteau,\r\nwithout even rising, let his answer drop disdainfully from his lips,\r\nand then stretched himself out more comfortably. Meanwhile, Rochas,\r\nthe lieutenant on duty, stood waiting, motionless, a few yards off.\r\nWhen the roll had been called, and Sergeant Sapin came to tell him that\r\nthere was no one missing, he protruded his chin in the direction of\r\nWeiss, who was still chatting with Maurice, and growled from under his\r\nmoustache, \'There\'s even one man too many. Why on earth is that fellow\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n\'He has the colonel\'s permission, sir,\' explained Jean, who had\r\noverheard the question.\r\n\r\nRochas shrugged his shoulders, and, without replying, began walking\r\nup and down in front of the tents pending the time to turn in, whilst\r\nJean, worn out by the day\'s march, sat down not far from Maurice,\r\nwhose words reached him without any intentional listening on his part,\r\noccupied as he was with vague dim reflections that were germinating in\r\nthe depths of his slow, dull brain.\r\n\r\nMaurice was a believer in war, which he considered to be\r\ninevitable--necessary, even, to the existence of nations. This\r\ndoctrine had imposed itself upon him since he had adopted the theory\r\nof evolution, which already at that time impassionated young men of\r\nculture. Is not life itself an incessant battle, which does not flag,\r\neven for a second? Continuous fighting, the victory of the fittest, the\r\nmaintenance and renewal of strength by action, and the resuscitation of\r\njuvenescent life from death itself--are not these the very essence of\r\nthe natural law? Maurice remembered the great transport that had buoyed\r\nhim up when, with the view of atoning for his errors, he had thought of\r\nbecoming a soldier and hurrying to the frontier. Possibly the voters\r\nof the Plebiscitum, though surrendering themselves to the Emperor, had\r\nnot really desired war. Maurice himself, but a week previously, had\r\ndeclared that such a war as was being spoken of would be both culpable\r\nand idiotic. People were then discussing the candidature of a German\r\nprince to the Spanish throne, and in the confusion which gradually\r\narose it seemed as if everybody were in the wrong. No one could say\r\nprecisely from which side the provocation had come, and only the\r\ninevitable remained, the fatal law which at a given hour impels one\r\npeople against another. Then a great thrill swept through Paris, and\r\nMaurice in his mind\'s eye still beheld the scenes of that torrid night,\r\nthe boulevards a human sea, the bands of men who waved their torches\r\nand shouted: \'To Berlin! To Berlin! To Berlin!\' And he again saw a tall\r\nwoman[4] with a sculptural figure and a queenly profile mount on a\r\ncarriage-box in front of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, and, swathed in the folds\r\nof a tricolour flag, chant the \'Marseillaise.\' Was all that a lie? Had\r\nnot the heart of Paris really beaten that night?\r\n\r\nAs was always the case with Maurice, however, after this nervous\r\nexcitement there had come long hours of fearful wavering and disgust.\r\nHis arrival at the barracks, the adjutant to whom he had reported\r\nhimself, the sergeant who had provided him with his uniform, the\r\nstinking and repulsively filthy dormitory, the rough familiarity of\r\nhis new companions, the mechanical exercises which had exhausted his\r\nlimbs and rendered his brain so heavy--all these had been unpleasant\r\nexperiences. In less than a week, however, he had become accustomed to\r\nhis new life, and displayed no further repugnance for it. And, indeed,\r\nwhen the regiment at last set out for Belfort, enthusiasm again seized\r\nhold of him.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset he had felt confident of victory. The Emperor\'s\r\nplan was quite clear to him. Four hundred thousand men were to cross\r\nthe Rhine before the Prussians were ready, and by a bold, vigorous\r\ndash to separate Northern from Southern Germany; whilst, at the same\r\ntime, thanks to some brilliant success, Austria and Italy would\r\nspeedily be compelled to ally themselves with France. Had it not been\r\nrumoured, too, at one moment, that the Seventh Army Corps, to which\r\nMaurice\'s regiment belonged, was to put to sea at Brest in view of\r\nlanding in Denmark and creating a diversion which would compel Prussia\r\nto immobilise one of her armies? She was to be surprised, overwhelmed\r\non every side, crushed in a few weeks\' time. There was to be a mere\r\nmilitary promenade--from Strasburg to Berlin. Since that period of\r\nwaiting at Belfort, however, Maurice had been distracted by anxiety.\r\nThe Seventh Corps, whose allotted task was to watch the outlets of the\r\nBlack Forest, had reached Belfort in fearful confusion, deficient in\r\nmen, and lacking everything. It was necessary to wait for the third\r\ndivision to arrive from Italy.[5] The second cavalry brigade had to\r\nremain at Lyons, as some rioting was feared there; and three batteries\r\nof artillery had actually gone astray, no one knew where. Moreover,\r\nthe corps was in an extraordinary state of destitution. The magazines\r\nof Belfort, which were to have supplied all requisites, proved to be\r\nempty; there were no tents, no pots or pans, no flannel waistbands,\r\nno pharmaceutical supplies, no field smithies, no horse-locks, not an\r\nambulance attendant, nor an artificer. At the last moment, too, it was\r\ndiscovered that the indispensable spare mechanism for thirty thousand\r\nchassepots was wanting, and it became necessary to send an officer to\r\nParis, whence he returned with barely sufficient for five thousand\r\nweapons, and he had had the utmost difficulty in obtaining even these.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Maurice was particularly worried by the inaction of\r\nthe army. What! they had been there a fortnight--why did they not march\r\nforward? He fully realised that each day\'s delay was an irreparable\r\nblunder, an opportunity of victory irretrievably lost. And, confronting\r\nthe plan he had dreamt of, there rose up the reality, the blundering\r\nfashion in which this plan had been executed. Of this he was as yet\r\nbut anxiously and dimly conscious; it was only at a later period\r\nthat he knew the truth--the Seventh Army Corps \xc3\xa9cheloned or rather\r\ndisseminated along the frontier from Metz to Bitche and from Bitche\r\nto Belfort--the regiments invariably below their assumed strength,\r\nthere being at best but 230,000 men, when it was supposed that there\r\nwere 430,000; the generals jealous of one another, each bent on\r\ngaining his own marshal\'s _b\xc3\xa2ton_ without helping his neighbour; the\r\nmost fearful lack of foresight, mobilisation and concentration being\r\ncarried out simultaneously to gain time, but resulting in inextricable\r\nconfusion; and above all else that creeping paralysis, originating in\r\nhigh quarters, with the ailing Emperor, who was incapable of prompt\r\ndecision, and which was to spread over the entire army, disorganise\r\nand annihilate it, and toss it to the most fearful disasters,\r\nwithout any possibility of its defending itself. And yet, above the\r\nsecret disquietude of those days of waiting, there still lingered an\r\ninstinctive confidence in victory.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on August 3, the news of the victory of Saarbrucken, gained\r\nthe day before, burst upon one. Nobody knew whether it was a great\r\nvictory or not, but the newspapers were brimful of enthusiasm. So\r\nGermany was invaded at last. This was the first step in the glorious\r\nmarch; and then began the legend of the Prince Imperial, who had\r\ncalmly picked up a bullet on the battle field. Two days later, when\r\nthe surprise and crushing reverse of Weissenburg became known, a cry\r\nof rage arose from every breast. Five thousand Frenchmen, caught in an\r\nambuscade, had for ten long hours gallantly resisted five-and-thirty\r\nthousand Prussians--this evidently demanded vengeance! The commanders\r\nhad no doubt been guilty in not keeping a better look-out, and in not\r\nforeseeing what had happened; but everything was about to be remedied.\r\nMacMahon had summoned the first division of the Seventh Army Corps; the\r\nFirst Corps was to be supported by the Fifth;[6] and at the present\r\ntime, no doubt, the Prussians had recrossed the Rhine with the bayonets\r\nof the French linesmen in their loins. And the thought that there\r\nmust have been some furious fighting that very day, the increasing,\r\nfeverish longing for news, all the prevailing anxiety grew and spread\r\nunder the broad pale heavens.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Maurice discoursed to Weiss.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' he added, \'they must certainly have received a good licking\r\nto-day.\'\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, Weiss nodded his head with a thoughtful air. He\r\nalso was looking towards the Rhine--towards the east, where night had\r\nnow completely fallen, and where the sky, darkened as with mystery, had\r\nthe aspect of a great black wall. Since the last bugle calls of the\r\nmustering, a profound silence had been falling over the drowsy camp,\r\ndisturbed only by the footsteps and converse of a few belated soldiers.\r\nA light, looking like a twinkling star, had just been placed in the\r\nroom of the farmhouse where the staff officers sat keeping their vigil,\r\nwaiting for the telegrams which arrived at intervals, bringing as yet\r\nonly ambiguous tidings. The fire of green wood had been abandoned at\r\nlast, but some dense, funereal smoke still ascended from it, and was\r\ndriven away by the breeze over the restless farm and towards the sky,\r\nwhere it dimmed the early stars.\r\n\r\n\'A licking!\' repeated Weiss, at last. \'God grant it!\'\r\n\r\nJean, who was still seated a few steps away, pricked up his ears;\r\nand Lieutenant Rochas, noticing the accent of doubt that quivered in\r\nWeiss\'s wish, stopped short to listen.\r\n\r\n\'What, do you lack confidence?\' Maurice resumed; \'do you think a defeat\r\npossible?\'\r\n\r\nHis brother-in-law stopped him with a gesture, his hands trembling, his\r\ngood-natured face suddenly convulsed and quite pale. \'A defeat! Heaven\r\nshield us from it! I belong to this part of the country, you know. My\r\ngrandfather and grandmother were murdered by the Cossacks, in 1814, and\r\nwhenever I think of invasion my hands clench instinctively, and I feel\r\ninclined to go and fight the enemy in my frock-coat, just as I am! But\r\na defeat--no, no, I won\'t believe it possible!\'\r\n\r\nHe became calmer, and his shoulders drooped as though he felt\r\noppressed. \'All the same,\' he resumed, \'I am not at ease. I know\r\nAlsace well; I have just travelled through the province on business,\r\nand have seen things which stared our generals in the face, but which\r\nthey refused to see. We Alsatians certainly desired war with Prussia;\r\nwe have long been awaiting an opportunity to pay off old scores. But\r\nthat did not interfere with our friendly intercourse with Baden and\r\nBavaria. We most of us have friends or relatives just across the\r\nRhine. We thought that, like ourselves, they dreamed of curbing the\r\nunbearable pride of the Prussians. Calm and resolute as we usually are,\r\nwe have, nevertheless, been seized with impatience and disquietude for\r\na fortnight past, on seeing how everything has gone from bad to worse.\r\nEver since the declaration of war the enemy\'s cavalry scouts have been\r\nallowed to come and terrify our villages, reconnoitre the country, and\r\ncut the telegraph wires. Baden and Bavaria are rising, masses of troops\r\nare marching through the Palatinate, and the information that has come\r\nin from all sides, from the fairs and the markets, shows that the\r\nfrontier is menaced. But when the frightened villagers and their mayors\r\ncome and tell all this to the passing officers, the latter shrug their\r\nshoulders and think these peasants are mere poltroons troubled with\r\nhallucinations. The enemy is far away! Ah! the truth is we ought not to\r\nhave lost an hour, whereas days and days go by. What can we be waiting\r\nfor? For the whole of Germany to fall upon us?\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low, sorrowful voice, as though repeating things that he\r\nhad long thought out: \'Ah! Germany, I know it well, and the pity is\r\nthat you others seem to know as little about it as you know of China.\r\nDo you remember my cousin Gunther, Maurice, the young fellow who came\r\nto shake hands with me last spring at Sedan? He is my cousin on the\r\nwomen\'s side. My mother and his are sisters; she was married at Berlin,\r\nand he is a true Prussian; he hates France. He is now serving as a\r\ncaptain in the Prussian Guards. On the evening when I saw him Off at\r\nthe railway station--I still seem to hear him--he said to me in that\r\nrasping voice of his: "If France ever declares war against us she will\r\nbe beaten."\'\r\n\r\nLieutenant Rochas had, so far, restrained himself, but on hearing this\r\nhe stepped forward with a furious air. He was a tall, thin fellow,\r\nnearly fifty years old, with a long, battered, tanned, smoked face. His\r\nhuge, hooked nose fell over a large mouth--expressive both of violence\r\nand kindliness--above which bristled his coarse grey moustache. \'What\r\nthe ---- are you about,\' he thundered, \'discouraging our men like that?\'\r\n\r\nWithout taking part in the dispute, Jean considered the lieutenant\r\nto be in the right. Though astonished by the long delays and the\r\nprevailing confusion, he had never doubted that they would give the\r\nPrussians a fearful thrashing. It was sure and certain, indeed, since\r\nhe and his comrades had been sent there for no other purpose.\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t want to discourage anyone,\' replied Weiss, somewhat\r\ntaken aback. \'On the contrary, I wish everyone knew what I know, for\r\nforewarned is forearmed. But listen, Germany----\'\r\n\r\nThen, with that sober-minded air of his, he explained his fears: the\r\nvictory of Sadowa had brought Prussia increased power, a national\r\nmovement was placing her at the head of the other German States, a\r\nvast empire was in progress of formation, men were seized with an\r\nenthusiastic, irresistible impulse to secure the unification of the\r\nFatherland. Thanks to the system of compulsory military service the\r\nwhole nation was up in arms, fully instructed, well disciplined,\r\nprovided with a powerful war material, trained also to European\r\nwarfare, and still flushed with the glory of its triumph over Austria.\r\nThe intelligence and moral strength of this army were also to be\r\nnoted; nearly all the commanders were young men, and took their\r\norders from a generalissimo who seemed destined to revolutionise the\r\nentire art of war, whose prudence and foresight were perfect, and\r\nwhose perspicuity was marvellous. Then, confronting Germany, Weiss\r\nboldly depicted France: the Empire greatly aged, still acclaimed, as\r\nwitness the Plebiscitum,[7] but rotten at the basis, having weakened\r\nlove of country by destroying liberty, and having reverted to liberal\r\ncourses when these could be of no avail but could only accelerate its\r\nfall; and exposed, moreover, to crumble away as soon as it ceased\r\nto encourage the appetite for enjoyment which itself had fostered.\r\nThe army, still laden with the laurels of the Crimea and Italy, was\r\ncertainly splendidly brave; but the system of allowing men to escape\r\nservice by a pecuniary payment had tampered with its efficiency; and\r\nit had been abandoned to the routine of the Algerian school, and was\r\nfar too confident of victory to make any real effort for proficiency\r\nin the new science of war. Finally, the generals, for the most part of\r\nindifferent merit, were consumed by rivalry, whilst some were crassly\r\nignorant, and at the head of them there was the Emperor, ailing and\r\nhesitating, deceived by others and deceiving himself as to the outcome\r\nof this frightful adventure, into which they all plunged like blind\r\nmen, without any attempt at serious preparation, and amid universal\r\nbewilderment and confusion, like that of a scared flock driven to the\r\nslaughter-house.\r\n\r\nRochas stood there listening, agape, with his eyes wide open and his\r\nterrible nose contracted. Suddenly, however, he made up his mind to\r\nlaugh, with a huge laugh that distended his jaws from ear to ear. \'What\r\nare you cackling there? What does all this humbug mean?\' he shouted.\r\n\'There\'s no sense in it; it is too stupid for anyone to trouble his\r\nhead about. Go and tell it to the marines if you like, but not to me;\r\nno, not to me. I\'ve seen twenty-seven years\' service!\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he struck his chest with his clenched hand. The son of a\r\njourneyman mason from the Limousin country, Rochas had been born in\r\nParis, and not caring for his father\'s calling had enlisted when he\r\nwas only eighteen. A true soldier of fortune, he started off with\r\nhis knapsack, gaining a corporal\'s stripes in Algeria, rising to the\r\nrank of a sergeant at Sebastopol, and promoted to a lieutenancy after\r\nSolferino. Fifteen years of hardship and heroic bravery was the price\r\nhe had paid to become an officer, but he was so painfully ignorant that\r\nit was certain he would never be made a captain.\r\n\r\n\'Come, sir,\' said he to Weiss, \'although you know everything, here\'s\r\nsomething you don\'t know. At Mazagran--I was barely nineteen at the\r\ntime--we were only one hundred and twenty-three men, neither more nor\r\nless, yet we held out during four days against twelve thousand Arabs.\r\nYes, indeed, for years and years out there in Africa, at Mascara,\r\nBiskra, and Dellys, then too in Khabylia, and later on at Laghouat, if\r\nyou had only been with us, sir, you would have seen how all those dirty\r\nblackamoors skedaddled as soon as ever we appeared. And at Sebastopol,\r\nsir--ah! dash it, it can\'t be said that we had an easy time of it out\r\nthere. Gales strong enough to tear the very hair out of your head, such\r\nbitter cold and ceaseless alerts, and then, at the very end, everything\r\nblown into the air by those savages! But all the same we made them\r\ndance--dance to our tune in our own frying pan. And then Solferino--you\r\nwere not there, sir, so why do you speak of it? Ah! it _was_ warm at\r\nSolferino--though there fell more water from the sky that day than\r\nyou have seen fall in all your life--and a nice dressing we gave the\r\nAustrians. You should have seen how they ran away from our bayonets,\r\nhow they galloped and pushed one another aside to run the faster, as if\r\nthey were on fire!\'\r\n\r\nHe was brimming over with delight, and all the old military gaiety\r\nof France rang out in his triumphant laugh. This was the legend--the\r\nFrench trooper marching victoriously all over the world with his\r\nsweetheart on one hand and a glass of good wine in the other; the\r\nuniverse conquered whilst singing a drinking refrain. A French corporal\r\nand four men, and lo! immense armies of foreigners bit the dust.\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly thundered out: \'Beaten, France beaten! Those Prussian\r\npigs beat such men as we!\' Then stepping up to Weiss he caught hold\r\nof a lapel of his coat. His tall, slim, knight-errant style of figure\r\nexpressed profound contempt for any enemy, no matter who that enemy\r\nmight be, and supreme indifference as to conditions of time and place.\r\n\'Listen to me, sir,\' he said; \'if the Prussians dare to come here we\r\nwill escort them home again--we\'ll kick them all the way back--all the\r\nway back to Berlin. You hear me!\'\r\n\r\nThen he waved his hand superbly, with the serenity of a child, the\r\ncandid conviction of the innocent babe that knows nothing and fears\r\nnothing. \'_Parbleu_!\' he added. \'That\'s how it is, because it can\'t be\r\notherwise.\'\r\n\r\nDazed and almost convinced, Weiss hastily declared that he asked for\r\nnothing better. As for Maurice, who held his tongue, not daring to\r\nspeak out before his superior, he ended by laughing in unison with\r\nhim. That devil of a lieutenant, stupid though he was, had warmed his\r\nheart. Jean, too, with a nod of the head, had approved each of the\r\nlieutenant\'s words. He also had fought at Solferino, when it rained\r\nso heavily. Moreover, that was the proper way to speak. If all the\r\nofficers had spoken like that, the men would not have cared a fig about\r\nthere being no pots or pans, or flannel waistbands.\r\n\r\nFor some time past the night had completely fallen, and in the darkness\r\nRochas continued waving his long arms. He had never spelt through\r\nmore than one book--a volume on the victories of Napoleon I. that had\r\nfound its way from a pedlar\'s box into his knapsack--and unable to\r\ncalm himself he vented all his science in this impetuous outburst: \'At\r\nCastiglione, Marengo, Austerlitz and Wagram we thrashed the Austrians!\r\nAt Eylau, Jena, and Lutzen we thrashed Prussia! At Friedland,\r\nSmolensko, and the Moskowa we thrashed the Russians! We thrashed\r\nSpain and England everywhere! We thrashed the whole world, right and\r\nleft, from top to bottom. Yet to-day you say we are to be thrashed\r\nourselves! Why? How? Has the world suddenly been changed?\'\r\n\r\nHe drew himself still more erect, raising his arm like a flag-staff.\r\n\'Listen, there has been fighting to-day, and the staff are waiting for\r\nnews. Well, I\'ll tell you what news will come! The Prussians have been\r\nthrashed--thrashed to such a point that they have neither arms nor legs\r\nleft them, thrashed to such a degree that only crumbs of them remain\r\nfor us to sweep away!\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment a loud, dolorous cry resounded under the sombre heavens.\r\nWas it the plaintive note of some night bird? Was it the sobbing voice\r\nof Mystery coming from afar? The whole camp, shrouded in darkness,\r\nshuddered at the sound, and the disquietude fostered by the delay in\r\nthe arrival of the expected despatches became more intense, feverish,\r\nand widespread. The flame of the candle that illuminated the anxious\r\nvigil of the staff had shot up higher, and now it was shining erect,\r\nwithout a flicker, like the flame of a taper beside a death-bed.\r\n\r\nBut it was ten o\'clock; and Gaude, springing from the dark ground where\r\nhe had been lost to view, was the first to sound the signal for the men\r\nto retire for the night. Far and near, the other bugles replied, till\r\nthe sound gradually died away in a faint flourish, as though the very\r\ninstruments were drowsy. Then Weiss, who had lingered there so long,\r\naffectionately pressed Maurice to his heart, and bade him be brave and\r\nhopeful. He would kiss Henriette for him, and say all manner of kind\r\nthings to uncle Fouchard.\r\n\r\nJust as he was going off a rumour sped through the camp causing a\r\nfeverish agitation: Marshal MacMahon had gained a great victory, it\r\nwas said; the Crown Prince of Prussia and 25,000 men had been taken\r\nprisoners; the enemy had been driven back, annihilated, leaving his\r\nguns and baggage in the hands of the French.\r\n\r\n\'Of course!\' exclaimed Rochas in his thundering voice; and running\r\nafter Weiss, who, quite delighted, was hastening away towards\r\nMulhausen, he added: \'We\'ll kick them all the way back, sir, all the\r\nway back!\'\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, however, a despatch announced that the army\r\nhad been obliged to abandon W\xc5\x93rth,[8] and was in full retreat. Ah!\r\nWhat a night! Rochas, overcome by sleep, had wrapped himself in his\r\ncloak, and as often happened was slumbering on the ground, disdaining\r\nany shelter. Maurice and Jean had slipped into the tent, where, with\r\ntheir heads resting on their knapsacks, Loubet, Chouteau, Pache, and\r\nLapoulle had already settled themselves. There was just room for six\r\nmen, provided they curled up their legs. At the outset Loubet enlivened\r\nall these hungry fellows by convincing Lapoulle that some fowls would\r\nbe given out at ration time, next day; they felt so tired, however,\r\nthat they were soon snoring, careless whether the Prussians came\r\nor not. Jean remained for a moment quite motionless, pressed close\r\nagainst Maurice. Despite his great fatigue he could not get to sleep,\r\nfor everything that Weiss had said of the innumerable, all-devouring\r\nGerman nation, that was up in arms against France, was revolving in\r\nhis brain; and he realised that his companion also was awake, thinking\r\nof the self-same things. Suddenly Maurice drew back impatiently, and\r\nJean divined that he inconvenienced him. The instinctive enmity and\r\nrepugnance, due to difference of class and education, that separated\r\nthe peasant from the young man of culture, assumed a form of physical\r\ndislike. It filled Jean with a feeling of shame and secret sadness,\r\nand he tried to make himself small, as it were, to escape the hostile\r\ncontempt that he divined in Maurice. The night was freshening, but\r\ninside the tent, with all these closely packed bodies, the atmosphere\r\nbecame so stifling that Maurice, seized with feverish exasperation, at\r\nlength bounded outside, and stretched himself on the ground a few paces\r\noff. Jean, feeling quite wretched, sank into a kind of semi-somnolence,\r\nfull of unpleasant dreams, in which his sorrow that nobody cared for\r\nhim was mingled with the apprehension of a terrible misfortune, which\r\nhe fancied he could hear galloping along, afar off, in the depths of\r\nthe Unknown.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours must have elapsed, and the whole black, motionless\r\ncamp seemed to be annihilated beneath the oppressive weight of that\r\ndense, evil night, heavy with something fearful which was as yet\r\nwithout a name. Every now and again there was an upheaval of that\r\nsea of darkness, a sudden groan resounded from some invisible tent,\r\nthe gasp of some soldier in a fitful dream. Then there came noises\r\nthat were not easily recognised, the snorting of a horse, the clash\r\nof a sabre, the hasty footsteps of some belated prowler--all those\r\ncommonplace sounds which acquire at times a menacing sonority. Suddenly\r\na great glow blazed forth near the canteen. The front was brilliantly\r\nilluminated, and the piles of arms could be seen with ruddy reflections\r\nstreaking the burnished barrels of the guns, as if with trickling\r\nrunnels of freshly shed blood. The sentinels stood out dark and erect\r\namid this sudden conflagration. Was this the enemy, whose appearance\r\nthe officers had been predicting for two days past, and to meet whom\r\nthey had marched expressly from Belfort to Mulhausen? Then, amid a\r\ngreat crackling and sparkling, the flame suddenly went out. After\r\nsmouldering for hours, the pile of green wood, with which Lapoulle and\r\nLoubet had busied themselves so long, had all at once blazed up and\r\nburnt away as though it had been so much straw.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the bright glow, Jean in his turn had precipitately bounded\r\nout of the tent, and in doing so he narrowly missed stumbling over\r\nMaurice, who lay there, looking on, with his head resting upon his\r\nelbow. The night had already fallen again, more dense than ever, and\r\nthe two men remained there stretched on the bare ground, at a few paces\r\nfrom one another. In front of them, in the depths of the gloom, there\r\nstill shone the window of the farmhouse, illumined by that solitary\r\ncandle that looked like a funeral taper. What could be the time? Two\r\no\'clock, three o\'clock perhaps. The staff had certainly not gone to\r\nbed. One could hear the brawling voice of General Bourgain-Desfeuilles,\r\nwho was quite exasperated by this long vigil, which he had only been\r\nable to endure thanks to multitudinous cigars and glasses of grog.\r\nFresh telegrams were arriving, and matters must be getting worse, for\r\nthe shadowy estafettes could be indistinctly seen galloping hither and\r\nthither like men deranged. Stamping and swearing could be heard; then\r\ncame a stifled gasp like that of a dying man, followed by a fearful\r\nsilence. Had the end come at last? An icy chill had swept over the\r\ncamp, weighed down by sleep and anguish.\r\n\r\nJust then, as a slim, tall, shadowy figure walked past them rapidly,\r\nboth Jean and Maurice recognised Colonel de Vineuil. He was with\r\nSurgeon-Major Bouroche, a stout man with the head of a lion. They were\r\nexchanging disconnected words in an undertone, words but imperfectly\r\narticulated, like those one sometimes hears in dreams: \'It came from\r\nBasle--our first division is destroyed--twelve hours\' fighting, the\r\nentire army in retreat.\' The colonel stopped short, and called to\r\nanother shadowy figure, slight, nimble, and dapper, that was hastily\r\napproaching, \'Is that you, Beaudoin?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, colonel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my poor friend. MacMahon has been beaten at Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, Frossard\r\nis beaten at Speichern, De Failly hemmed in between them, gave neither\r\nany support. At Fr\xc5\x93schweiler we had but a single corps engaged\r\nagainst an entire army. Prodigies of valour, but everything was swept\r\naway--rout and panic, and France open to the invader.\'\r\n\r\nHis sobs were choking him, and the words he added died away as he\r\nand his shadowy companions disappeared, melting as it were in the\r\nsurrounding darkness.\r\n\r\nMaurice had sprung from the ground, shuddering from head to foot. \'My\r\nGod!\' he stammered.\r\n\r\nAnd he found nothing else to say, whilst Jean, with an icy chill at his\r\nheart, muttered: \'Ah! What cursed luck! That gentleman, your relative,\r\nwas right, after all, when he said they were stronger than we are.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, quite beside himself, felt inclined to strangle Jean. The\r\nPrussians stronger than the French! The thought made his pride revolt.\r\nBut the sober-minded, stubborn peasant was already adding--\'Still it\r\ndoesn\'t much matter. A man doesn\'t give in just for one blow. We shall\r\nhave to hit them back.\'\r\n\r\nA tall figure had just sprung up in front of them, and they recognised\r\nRochas, still draped in his cloak. The fugitive noises, perhaps even\r\nthe passing breath of defeat, had roused him from his heavy slumber.\r\nHe questioned them, determined to know the truth, and when, with great\r\ndifficulty, he understood what had happened, an expression of profound\r\nstupefaction appeared in his empty child-like eyes. Again and again he\r\nrepeated: \'Beaten! beaten! How\'s that? Beaten--_why_?\'\r\n\r\nThe night had been pregnant with the anguish of this disaster. And now\r\nin the east appeared the dawn, an ambiguous dawn, infinitely sad, that\r\nwhitened the tents full of sleepers, among whom one could now dimly\r\ndescry the cadaverous-looking faces of Loubet and Lapoulle, Chouteau\r\nand Pache, who were still snoring with their mouths wide open. The\r\naurora of a day of mourning was rising amid the soot-tinted mists that\r\nhad ascended from the distant river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PANIC--FROM BELFORT TO RHEIMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards eight o\'clock the heavy clouds were dissipated by the sun, and\r\nthe bright, hot August Sunday shone upon Mulhausen, nestling amid the\r\nbroad fertile plain. From the camp, now wide awake and buzzing with\r\nlife, one could hear the bells of all the parish churches ringing out\r\nin full peal through the limpid atmosphere. Fraught though it was with\r\na terrible disaster, this beautiful Sunday was a gay one, and the sky\r\nhad a festive brilliancy.\r\n\r\nWhen Gaude suddenly sounded the call to rations, Loubet affected great\r\nastonishment. What would there be? Some of that fowl which he had\r\npromised to Lapoulle the night before? Born amid the Paris Halles,\r\nin the Rue de la Cossonnerie, Loubet was the chance offspring of a\r\nmarket woman, and had enlisted, so he expressed it, for money\'s sake,\r\nafter trying in turn a variety of callings. Fond of his stomach, he\r\nhad a keen scent for dainty morsels, so he went off to see the rations\r\ndistributed, whilst Chouteau, the artist--in reality a house painter\r\nof Montmartre--a handsome man and a revolutionist, who was furious at\r\nhaving been kept in the army after completing his time, began chaffing\r\nPache, whom he had caught saying his prayers, on his knees, behind the\r\ntent. Pache, a sorry-looking little fellow with a pointed head, coming\r\nfrom some far-away village in Picardy, submitted to the chaffing with\r\nthe patient gentleness of a martyr. He, and that colossus Lapoulle--a\r\nbrutish peasant reared amid the Sologne marshes, and so stupendously\r\nignorant that on joining the regiment he had asked to be shown the\r\nKing--were the butts of the squad.\r\n\r\nAlthough the news of the disaster of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler had been current\r\nsince the reveille, the four men laughed together, and set about their\r\naccustomed tasks with the indifference of machines. A bantering growl\r\nof surprise was heard when Corporal Jean, accompanied by Maurice, came\r\nback from the rationing with some firewood. So the supply which the men\r\nhad vainly awaited the evening before in order to cook their _soupe_\r\nhad arrived at last. There had merely been twelve hours\' delay.\r\n\r\n\'A good mark for the commissariat!\' exclaimed Chouteau.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, we\'ve got it now!\' said Loubet. \'You shall see what a\r\ncapital _pot-au-feu_ I\'ll make you.\'\r\n\r\nHe willingly took charge of the cooking as a rule; and the others\r\nthanked him for doing so, for he was a capital cook. But on\r\nthese occasions he would overwhelm Lapoulle with extraordinary\r\nfatigue-duties. \'Go and fetch the champagne,\' he would say to him,\r\n\'go and fetch the truffles.\' That morning a comical idea, worthy of\r\na Parisian _gamin_ poking fun at a fool, came into his head: \'Make\r\nhaste!\' he cried; \'give me the fowl.\'\r\n\r\n\'The fowl--why, where is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, there, on the ground. The fowl I promised you, the fowl the\r\ncorporal brought.\' So saying he pointed to a large white stone lying at\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nLapoulle, quite amazed, ended by picking up the stone and turning it\r\nover in his hands.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, wash it! Wash the feet and the neck,\' called Loubet, \'and\r\nuse plenty of water, lazybones.\' Then, by way of a joke and because\r\nthe idea that they were going to have some _soupe_ made him quite gay\r\nand facetious, he flung the stone into the pot full of water: \'That\r\nwill flavour the broth nicely. What, didn\'t you know it? Don\'t you know\r\nanything, pighead? You shall have the parson\'s nose; you will see how\r\ntender it is.\'\r\n\r\nAll the other men of the squad were splitting at sight of the\r\nexpression on the face of Lapoulle, who, convinced at last, was\r\nalready licking his lips. Ah! that rascal Loubet, there was no chance\r\nof catching the blues in his company. When the fire crackled in the\r\nsunlight and the pot began to sing, the whole squad, ranged around it\r\nlike worshippers, visibly brightened as they watched the meat dancing\r\non the water, and sniffed the nice smell that began to spread. They had\r\nfelt fearfully hungry since the night before, and the idea of feeding\r\ntook precedence of everything else. The army had been beaten, but all\r\nthe same they must fill their stomachs. From one end to the other of\r\nthe camp the fires were flaming and the pots boiling, and a voracious\r\ndelight displayed itself while the bells continued clearly pealing from\r\nevery steeple in Mulhausen.\r\n\r\nJust as nine o\'clock was about to strike, however, a sudden stir\r\nspread through the camp; officers hurried hither and thither, and\r\nLieutenant Rochas, on receiving instructions from Captain Beaudoin,\r\npassed in front of the tents of his section.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, fold up everything, pack up everything; we are starting.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the _soupe_?\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll have it another day. We start at once.\'\r\n\r\nGaude\'s bugle now rang out imperiously. Consternation and covert rage\r\nwere general. What! must they start off without a bite, without waiting\r\neven an hour, by which time the _soupe_ might be eatable? All the same\r\nthe squad wished to drink the broth, but as yet it was merely so much\r\nwater, whilst the uncooked meat was like tough leather between the\r\nmen\'s teeth. Chouteau growled angry words, and Jean had to intervene\r\nto hasten the preparations for departure. What could there be such a\r\ntremendous hurry about that they should have to rush off in that style,\r\nwithout an opportunity even to recruit their strength? Some said they\r\nwere about to march against the Prussians, to revenge the previous\r\nday\'s defeat; but Maurice, on hearing this, incredulously shrugged his\r\nshoulders. In a quarter of an hour the camp was raised, the tents were\r\nfolded and strapped to the knapsacks, the guns were shouldered, and\r\nnothing remained on the bare ground save the expiring breakfast fires.\r\n\r\nGeneral Douay had determined on an immediate retreat, for some serious\r\nreasons. The Sub-Prefect of Schelestadt\'s despatch, already three days\r\nold, had been confirmed. Telegrams stated that Prussian camp-fires had\r\nagain been seen threatening Markolsheim, and that an army corps of the\r\nenemy was crossing the Rhine at Huningen. Full and precise details\r\nwere at hand; cavalry and artillery had been observed, with infantry\r\nmarching from all directions to their rallying point. An hour\'s delay,\r\nand the line of retreat on Belfort would assuredly be intercepted. As\r\na result of the defeats of Weissenburg and Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, the general,\r\nisolated, adrift in his advanced position, now had no alternative but\r\nto fall back in all haste, especially as the morning\'s tidings were\r\nworse even than those of the night before.\r\n\r\nThe staff set out ahead at a rapid trot, spurring their horses onward\r\nand in dread lest they should be outstripped and find the Prussians\r\nalready at Altkirch. General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, foreseeing a\r\nhard march, took the precaution to pass through Mulhausen, where\r\nhe breakfasted copiously, cursing the scramble all the while. And\r\nMulhausen, as the officers rode through it, wore a sorrowful aspect. At\r\nnews of the retreat the townsfolk poured into the streets, lamenting\r\nthe sudden departure of the troops whose protection they had so\r\npressingly implored. So they were to be abandoned, and all the valuable\r\nsupplies accumulated at the railway station were to be left for the\r\nenemy; even the town itself would perhaps be merely a captured town\r\nbefore the evening. Along the country roads, the villagers and the\r\npeasants dwelling in wayside homesteads also hurried to their doors in\r\nastonishment and dismay. So the regiments they had seen marching to\r\nbattle only the day before were already retreating, flying from the\r\nenemy without even having fought! The commanders were gloomy, and\r\nwithout answering any questions urged on their horses, as though the\r\nvery fiend were at their heels. Was it true then that the Prussians had\r\ncrushed the army, and were pouring forth from all sides into France\r\nlike the waters of a swollen river? And, infected with the growing\r\npanic, the peasants fancied they could hear the distant roll of the\r\ninvasion travelling through the atmosphere and roaring louder and\r\nlouder every moment. Then carts were filled with furniture, houses were\r\nswiftly emptied, and families fled one after another by the roads along\r\nwhich fear was galloping.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the retreat, whilst skirting the canal from the\r\nRhone to the Rhine, the 106th was brought to a halt near the bridge,\r\nafter covering only the first thousand yards of the march. The marching\r\norders, given badly enough, had been even worse executed, and had\r\nresulted in the whole of the Second Division crowding together at this\r\nspot. The passage was so narrow--barely sixteen feet--that the defiling\r\nseemed likely to last for ever.\r\n\r\nTwo hours elapsed and the 106th was still waiting there, facing the\r\ninterminable stream of troops that flowed past it. Standing under the\r\nfiery sunrays with their knapsacks on their shoulders and their arms\r\ngrounded, the men at last waxed indignant in their impatience.\r\n\r\n\'It seems we belong to the rear-guard,\' said Loubet in that waggish\r\nvoice of his.\r\n\r\n\'They are having a fine game with us, letting us roast here,\' cried\r\nChouteau in a rage; \'we were the first to arrive, we ought to have gone\r\non ahead.\'\r\n\r\nAt sight of the broad fertile plain and the level roads intersecting\r\nthe hop grounds and fields of ripe corn, on the other side of the\r\ncanal, it was now quite apparent that they were retreating, returning\r\nindeed along the same route they had come by the day before, and as\r\nthis was realised jeers and furious scoffing sped through the ranks.\r\n\r\n\'So we are taking to our heels,\' resumed Chouteau. \'Well, this march to\r\nmeet the enemy, which they have been dinning into our ears since the\r\nother morning, is a precious funny one. Really now, this is too much\r\nbluster! We arrive, and then back we bolt without even having time to\r\neat anything.\'\r\n\r\nAt this, the men began to laugh again in their bitter rage, and\r\nMaurice, who stood near Chouteau, admitted he was in the right. As\r\nthey had been kept standing there like posts for a couple of hours why\r\nhadn\'t they been allowed to cook their _soupe_ quietly and eat it? They\r\nwere getting hungry again, and felt the more rancorous that their pots\r\nshould have been upset before the _soupe_ was ready, as they could\r\nnot understand the need of all this haste, which seemed to them both\r\ncowardly and stupid. Well, they were fine hares and no mistake.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lieutenant Rochas began to trounce Sergeant Sapin for the\r\ndisorderly bearing of his men; and hearing the noise, Captain Beaudoin,\r\nas dapper as ever, drew near: \'Silence in the ranks!\'\r\n\r\nJean, who like a well-disciplined veteran soldier held his peace,\r\nwas looking at Maurice, who seemed amused by Chouteau\'s malignant,\r\npassionate raillery: and he was astonished that a gentleman who had\r\nreceived so much schooling should approve of things which, however true\r\nthey might be, were certainly not things to be said. If each soldier\r\nbegan blaming the generals and giving his opinion, they would certainly\r\nnot get on together.\r\n\r\nAt last, after waiting another hour, the 106th was ordered to advance.\r\nThe bridge, however, was still so crowded with the fag end of the\r\ndivision that the most deplorable disorder was created. Several\r\nregiments became intermingled; some companies were carried along and\r\ngot across, whilst others, driven to the edge of the roadway, had to\r\nstay there marking time. And to make matters worse, a squadron of\r\ncavalry insisted on passing, driving the laggards who were already\r\nfalling out of the ranks of the infantry into the neighbouring fields.\r\nAfter an hour\'s marching, quite a large party of stragglers stretched\r\nalong the road, crawling and dawdling at their ease.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Jean found himself in the rear, adrift with his\r\nsquad, which he had not cared to leave, in the depths of a hollow\r\nroad. The 106th had disappeared, not another man nor an officer of the\r\ncompany was to be seen--only solitary soldiers, a medley of strange\r\nmen exhausted at the very outset of the march, and who were walking\r\nalong leisurely wheresoever the paths might lead them. The sunrays\r\nwere overpowering, it was extremely hot, and the knapsacks, rendered\r\nthe heavier by the tents and all the complicated paraphernalia that\r\nswelled them out, weighed terribly on the men\'s shoulders. Many of\r\nthese stragglers were not habituated to carrying them, and were\r\ninconvenienced too by their thick, campaigning great-coats, which\r\nseemed to them like leaden vestments. All at once a pale little\r\nlinesman, whose eyes were full of tears, stopped short and flung his\r\nknapsack into a ditch with a deep sigh of relief, the long breath which\r\nthe man who has been agonising draws as he feels himself coming back to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s in the right,\' muttered Chouteau, though he himself continued\r\nmarching along with his shoulders bending under the knapsack\'s weight.\r\nTwo other men, however, having disburdened themselves, he could no\r\nlonger hold out. \'Ah: curse it!\' he cried, and with a jerk of his\r\nshoulders he tossed his knapsack on to the bank. Half a hundredweight\r\non his shoulders--no, thanks. He had had enough of it. They were not\r\nbeasts of burden that they should have to drag such things about.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards Loubet imitated him, and compelled Lapoulle to\r\ndo the same. Pache, who crossed himself each time they came upon a\r\nwayside cross, unfastened the straps of his knapsack, and carefully\r\ndeposited it at the foot of a low wall, as if intending to come back\r\nand fetch it. And Maurice alone was still laden when Jean, on turning\r\nround, saw what his men had done.\r\n\r\n\'Take up your knapsacks. I shall have to pay for it if you don\'t.\'\r\n\r\nThe men, however, without as yet openly revolting, trudged on silently,\r\nwith an evil expression on their faces, as they pushed the corporal\r\nbefore them along the narrow road.\r\n\r\n\'Take them up or I shall report you!\'\r\n\r\nThese words stung Maurice as though he had been lashed with a whip\r\nacross the face. Report them! What! that brute of a peasant report\r\nthem, because the poor fellows, feeling their muscles quite crushed,\r\nhad eased themselves? And in a fit of feverish irritation he also\r\nunbuckled his straps, and with a defiant look at Jean, let his knapsack\r\nfall by the roadside.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' calmly said the corporal, realising the futility of a\r\nstruggle; \'we will settle all that this evening.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice\'s feet caused him intense suffering. They were swelling in his\r\ncoarse hard shoes, to which he was not habituated. He was far from\r\nrobust, and though he had rid himself of his knapsack he could still\r\nfeel a smarting sore on his spine, the unbearable hurt occasioned by\r\nhis burden. Now, too, the mere weight of his gun, no matter how he\r\ncarried it, made his breath come short and fast. But he was yet more\r\ndistressed by the moral agony he experienced, for he was in one of\r\nthose crises of despair to which he was subject. All at once, without\r\npossible resistance on his part, he would see his will-power collapse,\r\nand give way to evil instincts and self-abandonment, that subsequently\r\nmade him sob with very shame. His errors in Paris had never been\r\naught but the madness of \'his other self\' as he expressed it, of the\r\nweak-minded fellow, capable of any degraded action, that he became in\r\nmoments of low-spiritedness. And since he had been dragging himself\r\nalong, under the overpowering sun, in this retreat which resembled\r\na rout, he had become but a unit of the dawdling, disbanded flock\r\nspread over the roads. It was the countershock of the defeat, of the\r\nthunderbolt that had fallen leagues away, and the echo of which was\r\nfollowing close at the heels of these panic-stricken men who fled\r\nwithout having seen an enemy. What could be hoped for now? Was it not\r\nall over? They were beaten, and there was nothing to do but to lie down\r\nand die.\r\n\r\n\'All the same,\' shouted Loubet with that market boy\'s laugh of his;\r\n\'all the same we are not going to Berlin.\'\r\n\r\n\'To Berlin! to Berlin!\' Maurice again heard the cry bellowed forth\r\nby the swarming crowd on the Boulevards during that night of mad\r\nenthusiasm that had determined him to enlist. But the wind had changed\r\ninto a tempestuous squall, there had been a terrible veering, and\r\nthe very temperament of the French race was symbolised by the heated\r\nconfidence which at the first reverse had suddenly collapsed into the\r\ndespair now galloping among these vagrant, dispersed soldiers who were\r\nvanquished without having fought.\r\n\r\n\'This popgun of mine jolly well hurts my arms,\' resumed Loubet, as\r\nhe again changed his chassepot from one shoulder to the other. \'A\r\nnice toy, indeed, to carry about with one.\' And then alluding to the\r\nmoney he had received as a substitute[9] he added: \'All the same,\r\nonly fifteen hundred francs for such a trade as this--it\'s a regular\r\nswindle. That rich bloke whose place I\'ve took must be smoking some\r\nnice pipes by his fireside, while I\'m off to get my head cracked.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had finished my time,\' growled Chouteau, \'and I was just about to\r\nslope, but on account of this war they made me stay. Ah! what cursed\r\nbad luck to stumble into such a swinish business as this.\'\r\n\r\nHe was balancing his rifle with a feverish hand, and suddenly he threw\r\nit, with all his strength, over a hedge. \'There,\' said he, \'that\'s the\r\nplace for the dirty thing.\'\r\n\r\nThe gun spun round twice, and then fell in a furrow, where it lay\r\nmotionless, stretched out like a dead body. Other guns were already\r\nflying through the air to join it, and the field was soon strewn with\r\nprostrate weapons looking sadly stiff in their abandonment under the\r\noppressive sun. What with hunger torturing their stomachs, their\r\nshoes which injured their feet, this march which filled them with\r\nsuffering, and the unforeseen defeat threateningly pursuing them, the\r\nmen were seized as it were with epidemic madness. They could not hope\r\nfor anything now; the generals bolted, the commissariat did not even\r\nfeed them; and what with weariness and worry they experienced a desire\r\nto have done with the whole business before even beginning it. And\r\nthat being so, the chassepot might as well join the knapsack. So with\r\nimbecile rage, and with the jeers of madmen amusing themselves, the\r\nlaggards, scattered in endless file far away into the country, sent\r\ntheir guns flying into the fields.\r\n\r\nBefore ridding himself of his weapon, Loubet twirled it round and round\r\nlike a drum-major\'s cane. Lapoulle, seeing his comrades fling their\r\nguns away, fancied no doubt it was a new drill exercise, and imitated\r\nthem. Pache, however, with a confused consciousness of his duty,\r\nwhich he owed to his religious education, refused to do so, and was\r\nbespattered with insults by Chouteau, who called him a parson\'s drudge.\r\n\'There\'s a black-beetle for you,\' said the house painter. \'Well, go and\r\nserve mass, as you\'re afraid to do like your comrades.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, who was very gloomy, marched on in silence, his head bent\r\nunder the fiery sun. Amid a kind of nightmare, brought on by his\r\natrocious weariness, and peopled with phantoms, he advanced as if bound\r\nfor some abyss lying ahead; and he, the man of education, experienced\r\na subsidence of all his culture, an abasement that lowered him to the\r\nbestial level of the wretches surrounding him. \'Ah! you are right,\' he\r\nsuddenly said to Chouteau.\r\n\r\nHe had already deposited his gun on a pile of stones, when Jean, who\r\nhad vainly been trying to prevent the arms being thrown away in this\r\nabominable fashion, perceived him, and darted towards him.\r\n\r\n\'Take up your gun at once; at once, you hear me!\' cried the corporal,\r\nhis face suffused by a rush of terrible anger. Usually so calm and\r\nconciliatory, he now had flaming eyes, and his voice thundered.\r\nHis men, who had never seen him like this before, stopped short in\r\nsurprise. \'Take up your gun at once, or you\'ll have to deal with me.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, quivering with excitement, let but one word fall which he\r\nsought to render insulting: \'Clodhopper!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s it; I\'m a clodhopper, and you are a gentleman, you are!\r\nAnd for that very reason you\'re a pig, a dirty pig. I tell you so to\r\nyour face.\' At this some hooting was heard, but the corporal continued\r\nvehemently: \'When a man\'s educated, he shows it. If we are peasants and\r\nbrutes you ought to set us a good example, you who know more than we\r\ndo. Take up your gun, I say, or I\'ll have you shot when we halt.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, already conquered, had picked up his gun. Tears of rage\r\nobscured his eyes. He resumed his march, staggering like a drunken man\r\namid his comrades, who now jeered at him for having given in. Ah! that\r\nJean, Maurice hated him with an inextinguishable hatred, struck as he\r\nwas in the heart by this severe lesson which he felt to be deserved.\r\nAnd when Chouteau growled out that when men had a corporal like that\r\nthey waited for a day of battle to lodge a stray bullet in his head,\r\nMaurice, quite maddened, distinctly saw himself smashing Jean\'s skull\r\nbehind a wall.\r\n\r\nA diversion occurred, however. Loubet noticed that during the quarrel\r\nPache also had ended by getting rid of his gun, gently depositing it at\r\nthe foot of a bank. Why had he done this? He did not try to explain,\r\nbut laughed slyly, in the somewhat shame-faced style of a good little\r\nboy detected in his first fault. Then, very gay and quite revived, he\r\nmarched on with his arms swinging; and along the endless roads, between\r\nthe fields of ripe corn and the hop grounds that followed one another,\r\never the same, the straggling march continued, and the laggards without\r\nknapsacks or guns were now but a tramping crowd, a medley of scamps and\r\nbeggars, at whose approach the frightened villagers closed their doors.\r\n\r\nJust then an unforeseen meeting put the finishing touch to Maurice\'s\r\nrage. A dull, continuous rumbling was heard from afar; it was the\r\nreserve artillery, which had been the last to start, and the first\r\ndetachment of which suddenly debouched round a turn of the road,\r\nthe laggard linesmen having barely time to throw themselves into\r\nthe fields. There was an entire artillery regiment of six squadrons\r\nmarching in column, the colonel in the centre and each officer in\r\nhis place, and they all clattered along at equal, carefully observed\r\ndistances, each accompanied by its caisson, horses, and men. And in\r\nthe fifth squadron Maurice recognised his cousin Honor\xc3\xa9\'s gun. The\r\nquartermaster was there, proudly erect on his horse, to the left of\r\nthe front driver, Adolphe, a stalwart, fair-complexioned man, who\r\nbestrode a sturdy chestnut, which admirably matched the off-horse\r\ntrotting beside it; whilst Adolphe\'s chum, Louis, the gunner, a dark\r\nlittle fellow, would be seen among the six men seated in pairs on the\r\nammunition boxes. They all seemed to have grown taller to Maurice, who\r\nhad become acquainted with them at the camp, and the gun, drawn by its\r\nfour horses and followed by its caisson, to which six other horses\r\nwere harnessed, appeared to him as dazzling as a sun, well groomed and\r\nfurbished, idolised by all its people, man and beast, who clung to it\r\nas it were with the discipline and attachment of a gallant family; and\r\nfearfully was Maurice\'s suffering increased when he saw his cousin\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9 dart a contemptuous glance at all the laggards, and then look\r\nquite stupefied on perceiving him among this flock of unarmed men.\r\nThe defiling was nearly over already. The train of the batteries, the\r\nammunition and forage waggons, the field smithies passed by; and then\r\nin a last cloud of dust came the spare men and horses, who vanished\r\nfrom sight at another bend of the road, amid the gradually subsiding\r\nclatter of wheels and hoofs.\r\n\r\n\'Pooh!\' said Loubet, \'it\'s easy enough to swagger when you travel about\r\nin a carriage.\'\r\n\r\nThe staff had found Altkirch unoccupied. There were no Prussians there\r\nas yet. Still fearing, however, that he was being pursued, and that the\r\nenemy might appear at any moment, General Douay had determined upon\r\npushing on to Dannemarie, where the first detachments only arrived at\r\nfive in the evening. Eight o\'clock had struck, and night was gathering\r\nin, when the regiments, in frightful confusion and reduced to half\r\ntheir strength, commenced preparations for bivouacking. The men were\r\nquite exhausted, sinking both with hunger and fatigue. The laggards,\r\nthe lamentable and interminable tag-rag and bobtail of the army, the\r\ncripples and mutineers scattered along the roads, continued arriving,\r\nnow one by one, now in little bands, until ten o\'clock, and had to\r\nsearch in the darkness for their companies which they could not find.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jean had joined his regiment he went to look for Lieutenant\r\nRochas to report to him all that had happened, and found him and\r\nCaptain Beaudoin conferring with the colonel at the door of a little\r\ninn, all three of them visibly preoccupied about the roll call, and\r\nanxious as to what had become of their men. At the first words the\r\ncorporal addressed to the lieutenant, Colonel de Vineuil, overhearing\r\nhim, made him approach and relate everything. There was an expression\r\nof deep despondency on the colonel\'s yellow face, lighted by eyes that\r\nseemed all the blacker on account of the whiteness of his thick snowy\r\nhair and long drooping moustaches.\r\n\r\n\'Half a dozen of these scamps must be shot, sir,\' exclaimed Captain\r\nBeaudoin, without waiting for M. de Vineuil to give his opinion.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Rochas nodded assent, but the colonel made a gesture of\r\nhelplessness: \'There are too many of them. Nearly seven hundred. How\r\ncould you manage--whom could you select? Besides, to tell the truth,\r\nthe general won\'t have it. He\'s quite paternal, and says he never\r\npunished a single man in Algeria. No, no; I can do nothing. It\'s\r\nterrible.\'\r\n\r\n\'It _is_ terrible,\' boldly rejoined the captain, \'it\'s the end of\r\neverything.\'\r\n\r\nJean was retiring, when he heard Surgeon-Major Bouroche, whom he\r\nhad not seen, growl in an undertone on the threshold of the inn that\r\nwithout discipline and punishments the army was done for. Before a week\r\nwas over the men would be kicking their officers, whereas if a few of\r\nthese fine fellows had been shot at once, the others, perhaps, would\r\nhave profited by the lesson.\r\n\r\nNobody was punished. With commendable forethought some officers of\r\nthe rear-guard escorting the army train had caused the knapsacks and\r\nguns bestrewing either side of the roads to be picked up. Only a small\r\nnumber was missing, and the men were re-armed at daybreak, furtively\r\nas it were, so as to hush up the affair. Orders had been given to\r\nraise the camp at five o\'clock, but the men were roused at four, and\r\nthe retreat on Belfort was hastened, the commanders being convinced\r\nthat the Prussians were now only two or three leagues away. The men\r\nhad to content themselves with biscuit, and with nothing to warm their\r\nstomachs they remained quite foundered after that brief, feverish\r\nnight. And again that morning anything like an orderly march was\r\nprevented by the precipitate departure.\r\n\r\nThe day was an infinitely sad one, far worse than the day before. The\r\ncharacter of the scenery had changed; they had entered a mountainous\r\ncountry, the roads climbed and descended slopes planted with fir trees;\r\nand the narrow valleys, bushy with furze, were spangled with golden\r\nflowers. But across that stretch of country so bright in the August\r\nsunrays, panic, growing more and more frenzied, had been sweeping since\r\nthe previous day. A fresh despatch, instructing the mayors to warn the\r\ninhabitants to place their valuables in safety, had brought the general\r\nterror to a climax. Was the enemy at hand then? Would they even have\r\ntime enough to escape? And they all fancied they could hear the roar of\r\nthe invasion coming nearer and nearer; that sound like the dull roll of\r\nan overflowing river which had been swelling in volume ever since their\r\ndeparture from Mulhausen, and which now, at each village they came to,\r\nwas increased by some fresh scene of terror, fraught with wailing and\r\nuproar.\r\n\r\nMaurice marched along like a somnambulist, with his feet tingling, and\r\nhis shoulders crushed by his gun and knapsack. He no longer thought\r\nof anything; at the sights that met his gaze he fancied himself in\r\na nightmare; and he was no longer conscious of his comrades\' tramp,\r\nrealising merely that Jean was at his side, worn out with the same\r\nweariness and the same grief as himself. The villages they passed\r\nthrough presented a lamentable, pitiful aspect, such as to fill the\r\nheart with poignant anguish. As soon as the retreating troops, the\r\nworn-out, footsore, straggling soldiers appeared, the inhabitants began\r\nto bestir themselves, and hasten their flight. They had felt so easy\r\nin mind only a fortnight previously; all Alsace, indeed, had awaited\r\nthe war with a smile, convinced that the fighting would take place in\r\nGermany. But now France was invaded, and the tempest was falling upon\r\ntheir heads, around their houses, and over their fields like one of\r\nthose terrible hail and thunder storms which ruin an entire province in\r\na couple of hours.\r\n\r\nBefore the doors of the houses, amid a scene of fearful confusion,\r\nmen were loading carts and piling up articles of furniture, careless\r\nwhether they broke them or not; and from the upper windows women flung\r\nout a last mattress or lowered a baby\'s cradle which had been well-nigh\r\nforgotten. And the baby having been strapped inside it, the cradle was\r\nperched atop of the load, among the upturned legs of the chairs and\r\ntables. In another vehicle, standing behind, the poor, infirm, old\r\ngrandfather was being bound to a wardrobe that he might be carted away\r\nlike some household utensil. Then there were those who had no cart,\r\nand who piled a few goods and chattels into a wheelbarrow, and others\r\nwho went off with simply a bundle of clothes under their arm, and\r\nothers too who had only thought of saving their parlour clock, which\r\nthey pressed to their hearts as though it had been an infant. It was\r\nimpossible to remove everything, and many articles of furniture and\r\nheavy bundles of linen lay abandoned in the ditches. Some folks before\r\nleaving fastened up their homes, and the houses with their doors and\r\nshutters securely closed looked quite dead; but the majority of the\r\npeople, in their haste and the despairing conviction that everything\r\nwould be destroyed, left their old homesteads open, with doors and\r\nwindows gaping widely; and these poor empty houses, through which\r\nthe wind could blow as it listed, and whence the very cats had fled,\r\nshuddering at what was about to happen, were the saddest of all, sad\r\nlike the houses of a captured town depopulated by fright. At each\r\nsucceeding village the spectacle became more and more pitiable, the\r\nnumber of those who were moving and hastening away became larger and\r\nlarger, and there was shaking of fists, swearing of oaths, and shedding\r\nof tears amid all the growing scramble and confusion.\r\n\r\nBut it was especially whilst he followed the high road through the\r\nopen country that Maurice felt his anguish stifling him. As they\r\ndrew nearer to Belfort the train of runaways closed up and became a\r\ncontinuous procession. Ah! the poor people who imagined they would find\r\na shelter-place under the walls of the stronghold. The man belaboured\r\nthe horse, and the woman followed, dragging the children with her.\r\nEntire families, bending beneath their burdens, and with the little\r\nones, who were unable to keep up, lagging behind, were hastening over\r\nthe blinding white roads which the fiery sun was heating. Many of the\r\nfugitives had taken off their shoes that they might cover the ground\r\nmore rapidly, and were walking along barefooted; and mothers with their\r\ndress-bodies unfastened were giving the breast to crying infants,\r\nwithout pausing for a moment in their march.\r\n\r\nIn the panic-fraught breeze which dishevelled their hair and lashed\r\ntheir hastily donned garments, many of the runaways looked round with\r\nscared faces, and made gestures with trembling hands as though to shut\r\nout all view of the horizon. Others, farmers, accompanied by all their\r\nservants, were hastening across the fields, driving before them their\r\nherds and flocks--their sheep, cows, oxen and horses, which they had\r\nturned out with blows from their sheds and stables. They were making\r\nfor the mountain gorges, the high table-lands, the deserted forests,\r\nand the sight of them recalled the memory of those great migrations\r\nof ancient times, when invaded nations made way for the conquering\r\nbarbarians. They intended to live under canvas in some lonely rock-girt\r\nspot, so far from the roads that not one of the enemy\'s soldiers would\r\ndare to approach it. And the flying clouds that enveloped them were\r\nsoon wafted away behind the clumps of fir trees, whilst the lowing of\r\nthe cattle and the thuds of their hoofs grew more and more indistinct.\r\nMeantime, the flood of vehicles and wayfarers pressed along the road,\r\nhampering the march of the troops and becoming, as one approached\r\nBelfort, so compact and strong--with a force like the irresistible\r\ncurrent of a spreading torrent--that the soldiers were repeatedly\r\ncompelled to halt.\r\n\r\nDuring one of those brief halts Maurice beheld a scene which he long\r\nremembered, as one might remember a blow dealt one in the face. There\r\nwas a solitary house by the roadside, the abode of some poor peasant,\r\nwhose meagre patch of land stretched behind it. Firmly rooted to\r\nhis native soil, this man had been unwilling to leave his fields,\r\nfeeling that if he did so he must needs tear his flesh to shreds. So\r\nhe remained there, and could be seen crouching on a bench in a low\r\nroom, whence with empty eyes he watched the passing soldiers, whose\r\nretreat was about to place his ripe corn at the mercy of the invader.\r\nBeside him stood a young woman, his wife, with a child in her arms,\r\nwhilst another child was pulling at her skirts; and all three, mother\r\nand children, were sobbing and moaning. Suddenly, however, the door\r\nwas roughly flung open, and on the threshold appeared the grandmother,\r\na tall, thin, aged woman, who was furiously flourishing her bare arms\r\nwhich looked like knotted cords. Her grey hair, escaping from under\r\nher cap, was waving round her gaunt head, and so intense was her rage\r\nthat the words she shouted were half-stifled in her throat, whence\r\nthey escaped but indistinctly in an agonising hiccough. At first the\r\nsoldiers began to laugh. The old lunatic had a fine phiz! But some\r\nof her words reached them, and they heard that she was shouting:\r\n\'Blackguards! brigands! cowards! cowards!\'\r\n\r\nIn a more and more piercing voice she spat forth, as it were, that\r\ninsulting epithet--coward. And then the laughter ceased, and a great\r\nchill sped through the ranks. The men lowered their heads and looked\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\'Cowards! cowards! cowards!\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly the old woman appeared to increase in stature. She raised her\r\nspare, tragic figure, draped in a shred of a dress, to its full height;\r\nand waving her long arm from west to east with so comprehensive a\r\ngesture that it seemed to embrace the entire heavens, she shouted: \'The\r\nRhine is not there, you cowards--the Rhine is over _there_. Cowards!\r\ncowards!\'\r\n\r\nAt last they were resuming their march, and Maurice, whose glance\r\nat this moment fell upon Jean\'s face, saw that the corporal\'s eyes\r\nwere full of tears. He was thunderstruck, and his own suffering was\r\nincreased at the thought that even this brutish peasant had felt\r\nthe insult--an unmerited one, but to which they must needs submit.\r\nEverything then seemed to crumble away in Maurice\'s poor, aching head,\r\nand, overcome both by physical and moral suffering, he could never\r\nremember how he had finished the march.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Army Corps had required an entire day to cover the fourteen\r\nor fifteen miles separating Dannemarie from Belfort; and night was\r\nagain falling and it was very late when the troops were able to\r\nprepare their bivouacs under the walls of the fortress, on the very\r\nspot whence they had started four days previously to march against the\r\nenemy. Despite the lateness of the hour and their great weariness,\r\nthe men insisted on lighting their fires and cooking their _soupe_.\r\nIt was the first time, for four days, that they had something warm\r\nto swallow. And squatting around the fires in the freshening night\r\nair, they were all dipping their noses into their basins, and grunts\r\nof content were rising on all sides, when a rumour circulated, burst\r\nupon, spread through, and stupefied the camp. Two fresh telegrams had\r\narrived at brief intervals. The Prussians had not crossed the Rhine at\r\nMarkolsheim, and there was no longer a single Prussian at Huningen. The\r\npassage of the Rhine at Markolsheim, the pontoon bridge thrown across\r\nthe river at night, thanks to powerful electric lights--all those\r\nalarming stories were mere dreams, the unaccountable hallucinations of\r\nthe sub-prefect of Schelestadt. As for the army corps that threatened\r\nHuningen, the famous army corps of the Black Forest, which had made\r\nall Alsace tremble, this was composed of a petty detachment of\r\nWurtembergers--two battalions of foot and a squadron of horse--who by\r\nskilful tactics, repeated marching and counter-marching, sudden and\r\nunforeseen apparitions, had created a belief in the presence of thirty\r\nor forty thousand men. To think the Dannemarie Viaduct had narrowly\r\nescaped being blown up that morning! Twenty leagues of prosperous\r\ncountry had been ravaged through an idiotic panic, for no reason\r\nwhatever; and at thought of all they had seen that dreadful day--the\r\ninhabitants flying in terror, driving their cattle into the mountains,\r\nand the stream of furniture-laden vehicles flowing towards the town\r\namid a troop of women and children--the soldiers felt thoroughly\r\nenraged, and vented their anger in exasperated jeers.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s altogether too funny,\' stammered Loubet, with his mouth full, as\r\nhe flourished his spoon. \'So that was the enemy we were taken to fight?\r\nThere was nobody at all. Twelve leagues forward and twelve back, and\r\nnot even a mouse anywhere. All that for nothing--for the mere pleasure\r\nof getting in a funk!\'\r\n\r\nThen Chouteau, who was noisily cleaning his basin, soundly rated the\r\ngenerals without naming them: \'The hogs! What idiots they are! As timid\r\nas hares. As they bolted like that when there was nobody, what would\r\nthey have done had they found a real army in front of them?\'\r\n\r\nAnother armful of wood had been flung on the fire that they might\r\nenjoy themselves around the tall leaping flame, and Lapoulle, whilst\r\nwarming his legs, with an air of ecstasy, burst into an idiotic laugh\r\nat Chouteau\'s remarks, though he could not understand them; whereupon\r\nJean, who had hitherto turned a deaf ear to the chatter, ventured to\r\nsay paternally: \'Can\'t you be quiet? If you were overheard there might\r\nbe some unpleasantness.\' He, himself, with his simple common sense, was\r\ndisgusted with the stupidity of the commanders. Still, he must enforce\r\nrespect, and as Chouteau continued growling, he stopped him by saying,\r\n\'Silence! Here\'s the lieutenant. Address yourself to him if you have\r\nany remark to make.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, who sat apart from the others in silence, had lowered his\r\nhead. This was the end of everything! They were only at the beginning\r\nof the war, but it was all over. The indiscipline and mutinous\r\nbehaviour of the men at the very first reverse had already turned the\r\narmy into a mere mob without a tie to bind it together, but thoroughly\r\ndemoralised and ripe for every catastrophe. They, beneath Belfort, had\r\nnot seen a single Prussian, yet they were already beaten.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous days that followed were fraught with uneasiness and the\r\ntedium of waiting. To occupy the time of his men General Douay made\r\nthem toil at the defensive works of the fortress, which were still far\r\nfrom completed. They turned up the soil and split the rocks. Meanwhile,\r\nno news came. Where was MacMahon? What was taking place under Metz?\r\nThe most extravagant rumours circulated; only a few Paris newspapers\r\nreached the troops, and these, by their contradictory statements,\r\nincreased the black anxiety amid which they were struggling. Twice had\r\nthe general written asking for orders, and without even receiving an\r\nanswer. However, on August 12, the Seventh Corps was at last completed\r\nby the arrival of its third division from Italy.[10] Still even now the\r\ngeneral only had two divisions with him, for the first one, beaten at\r\nFr\xc5\x93schweiler, had been carried off in the rout, and it was not known\r\nwhere the current had cast it. At last, after a week of abandonment, of\r\ncomplete separation from the rest of France, a telegram brought orders\r\nfor departure. The men were delighted, anything was preferable to\r\nthe blank life they were leading. And whilst they were getting ready\r\nspeculations were indulged in. No one knew where they were going. Some\r\nsaid they were to be sent to Strasburg to defend it, while others\r\ntalked of a bold dash into the Black Forest to intercept the Prussian\r\nline of retreat.\r\n\r\nNext morning the 106th was among the first regiments to start,\r\npacked in cattle trucks. The one in which Jean\'s squad found itself\r\ninstalled was so full that Loubet pretended there wasn\'t even room\r\nto sneeze. Rations, as usual, had been distributed amid great\r\ndisorder, and the men, having received in brandy what they ought to\r\nhave received in food, were nearly all drunk--drunk with a violent,\r\nbrawling intoxication which vented itself in obscene songs. As the\r\ntrain travelled on they could no longer see one another, owing to the\r\nsmoke of their pipes, which filled the truck as with fog. It was also\r\nunbearably hot there, owing to the fermentation of all these closely\r\npacked bodies, and as they sped along vociferous cries poured out of\r\nthe black flying vehicle, drowning the sound of the wheels, and dying\r\naway afar off in the mournful country. It was only on reaching Langres\r\nthat the men realised they were being taken back to Paris.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! Thunder!\' repeated Chouteau, who, by the might of his glib tongue,\r\nalready reigned undisputed master of his little corner, \'sure enough,\r\nwe shall be drawn up at Charentonneau to prevent Bismarck from taking a\r\nnap at the Tuileries.\'\r\n\r\nThe others roared, thinking this very droll, though they could not say\r\nwhy. However, the slightest incidents of the journey--the sight of some\r\npeasants posted beside the line, of the groups of anxious people who,\r\nin the hope of obtaining news, were waiting at the smaller stations\r\nfor the trains to pass, the view, too, of all that region of France\r\nscared and quivering in presence of the invasion--sufficed to provoke\r\nhooting, shouting, and deafening laughter. And in the gust of wind that\r\nswept by as the engine forged onward, amid the rapid view they obtained\r\nof the train enveloped in smoke and noise, those that had hastened to\r\nthe stations received full in the face the howls of these men, all\r\nfood for powder, who were being carried along at express speed. At\r\none station, however, where they stopped, three well-dressed ladies,\r\nrich _bourgeoises_ of the town, who distributed bowls of broth to the\r\nsoldiers, met with great success. The men cried as they thanked them,\r\nand kissed their hands.\r\n\r\nBut farther on, the filthy songs and the savage yells burst forth\r\nagain. Shortly after passing Chaumont the train met another one full\r\nof some artillerymen who were no doubt being taken to Metz. Speed had\r\njust been slackened, and the soldiers of the two trains fraternised\r\namid a fearful clamour. It was, however, the artillerymen, doubtless\r\nmore intoxicated than the others, who carried off the palm by shaking\r\ntheir fists out of the trucks and raising this cry with such despairing\r\nviolence that it drowned everything else: \'To the slaughter! slaughter!\r\nslaughter!\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if a great chill, an icy wind from a charnel-house were\r\npassing by. There was a sudden brief silence, amid which one heard\r\nLoubet jeering: \'The comrades are not gay.\'\r\n\r\n\'But they are in the right,\' rejoined Chouteau, in his tavern-orator\'s\r\nvoice; \'it\'s disgusting to send a lot of brave chaps to get their\r\nheads cracked on account of some dirty business they don\'t know a word\r\nabout.\' And he continued talking in the same strain. This incapable\r\nworkman of Montmartre, this lounging, dissipated house-painter, who\r\nhad badly digested some scraps of speeches heard at public meetings,\r\nand who mingled revolutionary clap-trap with the great principles\r\nof equality and liberty, played the part of the perverter. He knew\r\neverything, and indoctrinated his comrades, especially Lapoulle,\r\nwhom he had promised to make a man of: \'Eh, old fellow? It\'s simple\r\nenough. If Badinguet and Bismarck have a row together let them settle\r\nit between them with their fists, instead of troubling hundreds of\r\nthousands of men who don\'t even know one another, and have no wish to\r\nfight.\'\r\n\r\nThe whole truck-load laughed, feeling amused and subjugated, and\r\nLapoulle, who did not even know who Badinguet[11] was, and who could\r\nnot even have said whether he was fighting for an Emperor or a King,\r\nrepeated, with that overgrown-baby air of his: \'Of course, with their\r\nfists--and a glass of wine together afterwards.\'\r\n\r\nBut Chouteau had turned towards Pache, in view of taking him in hand.\r\n\'And you--you\'re religious--Well, your religion forbids fighting. So\r\nwhy are you here, you idiot?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' replied Pache, taken aback, \'I\'m not here to please myself.\r\nOnly the gendarmes----\'\r\n\r\n\'The gendarmes! Humbug! Who cares a rap for the gendarmes? Do you\r\nknow, you others, what we ought to do if we were the right sort? Why,\r\nby-and-by, when we get out, we ought to slope--yes, quietly slope and\r\nleave that fat hog Badinguet and his clique of twopenny-halfpenny\r\ngenerals to settle matters as they please with their dirty Prussians.\'\r\n\r\nBravos resounded, the work of perversion was proceeding, and then\r\nChouteau triumphed, parading his theories, in which were confusedly\r\nmingled the Republic, the rights of man, the rottenness of the\r\nEmpire, which must be overthrown, and the treachery of all the\r\ngenerals who commanded them, and each of whom, as it had been proved,\r\nhad sold himself for a million! He, Chouteau, proclaimed himself a\r\nrevolutionist: Loubet also knew what his opinions were, he was in\r\nfavour of grub and nothing else; but the others did not know whether\r\nthey were Republicans or not, or even in what fashion a man might be\r\na Republican. Nevertheless, carried away by Chouteau\'s oratory, they\r\nall railed at the Emperor, the officers, the whole cursed show, which\r\nthey were bent on abandoning at the double-quick the first time they\r\nfelt worried. While fanning their increasing intoxication, Chouteau\r\nstealthily watched Maurice, the gentleman, whom he was enlivening,\r\nand whom he felt so proud indeed to have on his side that at last,\r\nto impassion him the more, he fell upon Jean, who with his eyes half\r\nclosed had until now stood there amid all the noise, motionless and as\r\nif asleep. If Maurice harboured any spite against the corporal for the\r\nbitter lesson the latter had given him in forcing him to pick up his\r\ngun, now was the time to urge the one against the other.\r\n\r\n\'And there are folks I know, who talked of having us shot,\' resumed\r\nChouteau, threateningly. \'Dirty curs who treat us worse than brute\r\nbeasts, and who can\'t understand that when a man has had enough of his\r\nsack and his popgun he pitches the whole lot into the fields. Well,\r\ncomrades, what would those curs say if we pitched _them_ on to the line\r\nnow that we have them comfortably in a corner? Is it agreed, eh? We\r\nmust make an example if we don\'t want to be plagued any more with this\r\nbeastly war. To death with Badinguet\'s vermin! To death with the dirty\r\ncurs who want us to fight!\'\r\n\r\nJean had become very red--red with the rush of blood which rose to his\r\ncheeks in his rare moments of anger; and close pressed though he was by\r\nhis companions, he managed to draw himself up, hold out his clenched\r\nfists, and protrude his flaming face with so terrible an air that\r\nChouteau turned quite pale.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder! just you shut up!\' cried the corporal. \'I\'ve said nothing for\r\nhours past, for there are no commanders left, and I can\'t even send you\r\nto the lock-up. I know well enough I should have rendered a big service\r\nto the regiment by ridding it of a filthy blackguard like you. But\r\nnever mind, as punishment is mere humbug, you\'ll have to deal with me.\r\nI\'m not a corporal now, but simply a chap you pester, and who\'ll shut\r\nyour jaw for you. You filthy coward, you won\'t fight, and you try to\r\nprevent others from fighting! Just say all that again, and you\'ll feel\r\nmy fists.\' All the men in the truck had already turned round, stirred\r\nby Jean\'s gallant defiance, and deserting Chouteau, who stammered and\r\ndrew back at sight of his adversary\'s big fists. \'And I don\'t care a\r\nrap for Badinguet any more than you do,\' resumed Jean; \'I\'ve never\r\ncared a rap for politics, for either Republic or Empire, and when I\r\ntilled my field I never wished but one thing, everybody\'s happiness,\r\ngood order, and prosperity everywhere, the same as I wish now. No doubt\r\nit does plague one to have to fight, but all the same the rascals as\r\ntry to discourage one when it\'s already so hard to behave properly\r\nought to be stuck against a wall and shot. Dash it all, friends!\r\ndoesn\'t your blood boil when you\'re told that the Prussians are here in\r\nFrance, and that we\'ve got to bundle them out!\'\r\n\r\nIn that easy way in which crowds change sides, the soldiers now began\r\nto acclaim Jean as he repeated his oath to break the skull of the first\r\nman in his squad who talked of not fighting. Bravo, corporal! That was\r\nthe style! Bismarck\'s hash would soon be settled! In the midst of the\r\nsavage ovation, Jean, who had calmed down, said to Maurice politely, as\r\nthough he were not addressing one of his men, \'You can\'t be on the side\r\nof the cowards, sir--we haven\'t fought yet, but we\'ll end by licking\r\nthem some day, those Prussians.\'\r\n\r\nAt these words Maurice felt a sunray glide into his heart. He was\r\ndisturbed, humiliated. So this Jean was not a mere rustic. Maurice\r\nremembered the fearful hatred that had consumed him when he picked up\r\nhis gun after throwing it down in a moment of self-abandonment. But\r\nhe also remembered how startled he had been at seeing the two large\r\ntears that stood in the corporal\'s eyes when the old grandmother, with\r\nstreaming grey hair, was insulting them and pointing to the Rhine afar\r\noff beyond the horizon. Was it the fraternity born of fatigue and pain,\r\nendured in common, that was carrying his rancour away? Belonging as he\r\ndid to a Bonapartist family, Maurice had never dreamt of the Republic\r\notherwise than in theory; his inclinations were rather in favour of\r\nthe Emperor personally, and he was a partisan of the war, war being\r\nin his mind an essential condition of the life of nations. Now, all\r\nof a sudden, hope was coming back to him in one of those veerings of\r\nthe mind to which he was so subject; whilst the enthusiasm which one\r\nevening had impelled him to enlist again beat within him, filling his\r\nheart with confidence in victory.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, corporal,\' he answered gaily, \'we\'ll lick them!\'\r\n\r\nWith its load of men, enveloped in the dense smoke of their pipes, and\r\nthe stifling heat of their closely packed bodies, the cattle truck\r\nrolled and rolled along, greeting the anxious crowds at the stations\r\nand the haggard peasants posted along the hedges with obscene songs and\r\ndrunken clamour. On August 20 they reached the Pantin station, just\r\noutside Paris, and the same night they started off again, quitting the\r\ntrain on the morrow at Rheims, _en route_ for the camp of Ch\xc3\xa2lons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTALES OF TWO BATTLES--THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\n\r\nMaurice was greatly surprised when, on detraining at Rheims, the 106th\r\nreceived orders to encamp there. Were they not going to join the army\r\nat Ch\xc3\xa2lons then? And a couple of hours later, when his regiment had\r\npiled arms at a league from the city, over towards Courcelles, amid\r\nthe vast plain skirting the canal from the Aisne to the Marne, his\r\nastonishment increased on learning that the entire army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons had\r\nbeen falling back since the morning and would bivouac on this very\r\nspot. And, indeed, tents were being pitched from one end of the horizon\r\nto the other, as far away as St. Thierry and La Meuvillette, and even\r\nbeyond the high road to Laon; and the fires of all four army corps\r\nwould be blazing there that same evening. Evidently enough, the plan of\r\ntaking up a position under Paris, there to await the Prussians, had\r\nprevailed, and Maurice was delighted, for was not this plan the wisest?\r\n\r\nHe spent most of the afternoon of August 21 in strolling through the\r\ncamp in search of news. Great latitude was allowed, there seemed less\r\ndiscipline than ever, and the men went off and came back just as\r\nthey pleased. Maurice himself was able to return to Rheims to cash\r\na post-office order for a hundred francs which he had received from\r\nhis sister. Whilst there he entered a caf\xc3\xa9, where he heard a sergeant\r\ntalking of the factious disposition of the eighteen battalions of the\r\nGarde Mobile of the Seine, which had been sent back to Paris. The sixth\r\nbattalion had almost murdered its officers. At Ch\xc3\xa2lons the generals had\r\nconstantly been insulted, and since the Fr\xc5\x93schweiler defeat the men no\r\nlonger saluted MacMahon. The caf\xc3\xa9 was filling with chatterers, and a\r\nviolent discussion arose between two peaceful civilians respecting the\r\nnumber of men that the marshal might have under his orders. One of the\r\ndisputants talked of 500,000 men, which was absurd. The other, more\r\nsensible, passed the four corps in review: the Twelfth, completed with\r\ndifficulty at the camp by means of marching regiments and a division of\r\nMarine Infantry; the First, the disbanded remnants of which had been\r\narriving since August 14, and were now being more or less successfully\r\nreorganised; then the Fifth, defeated without having fought, carried\r\naway and broken up in the rout; and the Seventh, just arriving, which\r\nwas likewise in a demoralised state, and lacked its first division,\r\nmere shreds of which it had now found at Rheims. Altogether there were\r\nat the utmost 120,000 men, including the Bonnemain and Margueritte\r\ndivisions of the reserve cavalry. However, the sergeant having mixed\r\nhimself up in the dispute, alluding to the army with furious contempt\r\nas a mere jumble of men, a flock of innocents led by idiots to the\r\nslaughter, the two civilians became alarmed and took themselves off,\r\nfearing lest they might be compromised.\r\n\r\nMaurice followed their example, and endeavoured to obtain some\r\nnewspapers. He filled his pockets with every number he could buy,\r\nand read them as he walked along under the spreading trees of the\r\nmagnificent promenades that engirdle the town. Where could the German\r\narmies be? It seemed as if they had been lost. Two of them, no doubt,\r\nwere near Metz--the first, under General Steinmetz, watching the\r\nfortress; the second, under Prince Frederick Charles, trying to make\r\nits way up the right bank of the Moselle so as to cut off Bazaine\'s\r\ncommunications with Paris. But where--so confused and contradictory\r\nwere the newspaper statements--could the third army really be--the\r\narmy of the Crown Prince of Prussia, victorious at Weissenburg and\r\nFr\xc5\x93schweiler, and launched in pursuit of the First and Fifth French\r\ncorps? Was it still camping at Nancy, or was it on the point of\r\nreaching Ch\xc3\xa2lons that the camp should have been so hastily abandoned,\r\nand the magazines, accoutrements, forage, quite an incalculable wealth\r\nof supplies, fired and destroyed? There was the same confusion, and\r\nthe same contradictory suppositions were indulged in with respect\r\nto the plans of the French generals. Hitherto separated from the\r\nrest of the world, it was only now that Maurice learnt what had been\r\noccurring in Paris--the thunderbolt of defeat falling on a people\r\nconfident of victory, the terrible emotion in the streets, the\r\nconvocation of the Chambers, the fall of the Liberal ministry[12] that\r\nhad organised the Plebiscitum, and the Emperor\'s deposition from the\r\npost of commander-in-chief, which he had been obliged to surrender to\r\nMarshal Bazaine. The Emperor had been at the camp of Ch\xc3\xa2lons since\r\nAugust 16, and all the papers spoke of a great council held there on\r\nthe 17th, and attended by Prince Napoleon and several generals. None\r\nof the accounts agreed, however, as to the decisions that had been\r\narrived at, apart from the incidents that had immediately followed,\r\nsuch as the appointment of General Trochu as governor of Paris and of\r\nMarshal MacMahon as commander of the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons, which implied\r\nthe complete effacement of the Sovereign. A general scare, prodigious\r\nirresolution, conflicting plans following swiftly one upon the\r\nother--all these could be divined. But ever the same question arose in\r\nMaurice\'s mind: Where were the German armies? Who were right--those who\r\npretended that Bazaine\'s movements were free, and that he was effecting\r\nhis retreat by way of the northern fortresses, or those who asserted\r\nthat he was already blockaded under Metz? There were persistent rumours\r\nof gigantic battles, heroic struggles sustained during an entire week,\r\nfrom the 14th to the 20th, but from these there was evolved only a\r\nformidable echo of conflict, waged far away.\r\n\r\nHis legs sinking from fatigue, Maurice seated himself at last on a\r\nbench. The town around him seemed to be living its daily life. Nurses\r\nwere minding children under the beautiful trees, and petty cits were\r\nslowly taking their usual walk. Maurice scanned his papers again, and\r\nin doing so came upon an article he had not previously noticed in one\r\nof the most fiery of the Republican opposition journals. This threw\r\na vivid light on the situation. At the council held at the camp of\r\nCh\xc3\xa2lons on August 17, so this newspaper asserted, the retreat of the\r\narmy upon Paris had been decided on, and General Trochu\'s appointment\r\nas governor of the capital had been made solely with the view of\r\npreparing the Emperor\'s return. But the newspaper added that these\r\ndecisions had been frustrated by the attitude which the Empress-Regent\r\nand the new ministry[13] had taken up. According to the Empress Eug\xc3\xa9nie\r\na revolution was certain if the Emperor returned to Paris. \'He would\r\nnot reach the Tuileries alive,\' she was asserted to have said. And\r\nshe obstinately insisted on a forward march, on MacMahon effecting\r\na junction, despite every obstacle, with the army of Metz; in which\r\nviews she was supported by the minister of war, General de Palikao, who\r\nhad planned a victorious, lightning march for MacMahon, so that the\r\nlatter might join hands with Bazaine. Gazing dreamily in front of him,\r\nwith his paper lying on his knees, Maurice now fancied that he could\r\nunderstand everything: The two conflicting plans; MacMahon\'s hesitation\r\nto undertake this dangerous flank march with such indifferent troops;\r\nand the impatient, increasingly fretful orders which reached him from\r\nParis, urging him into this madly rash adventure. Whilst picturing the\r\ntragical struggle, Maurice had a clear vision of the Emperor, deprived\r\nof his imperial authority which he had confided to the Empress-Regent,\r\nand divested of the supreme command of the army which he had entrusted\r\nto Marshal Bazaine, so that he had now become a mere nothing--a vague,\r\nundefined shadow of an Emperor, a nameless and cumbersome inutility,\r\nwhom no one knew what to do with, whom Paris rejected, and who no\r\nlonger had any place in the army since he had undertaken not to give it\r\na single order.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, when Maurice awoke after a stormy night,\r\nwhich he had spent rolled up in his blanket outside his tent, he was\r\nrelieved to hear that the plan of retreating upon Paris had gained the\r\nupper hand. There was some talk of a fresh council held the previous\r\nevening, which had been attended by the ex-vice-Emperor,[14] M.\r\nRouher, whom the Empress had despatched to head quarters in view of\r\nhastening the march upon Verdun, but whom Marshal MacMahon seemed to\r\nhave convinced of the danger that would attend such a movement. Had\r\nany bad news of Bazaine come to hand? No one dared to assert this.\r\nHowever, the absence of news was sufficiently significant. All the\r\nofficers with any common sense pronounced themselves in favour of\r\nwaiting for the enemy under Paris; and, feeling convinced that he and\r\nhis comrades would begin falling back the very next day, since it was\r\nsaid that orders to that effect had been issued, Maurice in his delight\r\ndetermined to satisfy a childish craving. He wished, once in a way, to\r\nescape the mess-platter and to breakfast somewhere at a cloth-spread\r\ntable, with a bottle of wine, a decanter of water, and a plate before\r\nhim--all the things which it seemed to him he had been deprived of for\r\nmany months. He had some money in his pocket, so he slipped away with a\r\nbeating heart, as if bent on some spree, and began to search about him\r\nfor an inn.\r\n\r\nIt was on the outskirts of the village of Courcelles, beyond the canal,\r\nthat he found the breakfast he had dreamt of. He had been told the day\r\nbefore that the Emperor had taken up his quarters at a private house in\r\nthis village, and having strolled there out of curiosity, he remembered\r\nhaving noticed at the corner of a couple of roads a tavern with an\r\narbour, where dangled some beautiful bunches of grapes already ripe and\r\ngolden. There were some green-painted tables under the creeping vine,\r\nand through the open doorway of the spacious kitchen one could espy\r\nthe loud-ticking clock, the cheap coloured prints pasted on the walls,\r\nand the fat hostess attending to the roasting-jack. A bowling alley\r\nstretched in the rear of the house, and the whole place had the gay,\r\nattractive, free-and-easy aspect of an old-fashioned _guinguette_.\r\n\r\nA well-built, full-breasted girl, who showed her white teeth, came to\r\nask Maurice if he wished to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\'Of course I do. Give me some eggs, a chop, and some cheese--and\r\nsome white wine.\' Then calling her back he asked, \'Isn\'t the Emperor\r\nquartered in one of those houses?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, in the one in front of us; but you can\'t see it--it is behind the\r\ntrees that rise above that high wall.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice then installed himself in the arbour, took off his belt\r\nthat he might be more at his ease, and selected a table on which the\r\nsunrays, filtering through the vine leaves, were casting golden spots.\r\nHis eyes kept on returning to that high yellow wall which screened\r\nthe Emperor from view. The house was indeed a hidden and mysterious\r\none; not even the tiles of the roof could be seen. The entrance was\r\non the other side, facing the village street--a narrow street, where\r\nneither shop nor even window was to be seen, for it wound along between\r\nmonotonous blank walls. The grounds in the rear of the house looked\r\nlike an ait of dense verdure amid the neighbouring buildings. Among\r\nthese, on the other side of the highway, Maurice noticed a large\r\ncourtyard surrounded by stables and coach-houses, and filled with vans\r\nand carriages, amid which men and horses were continually coming and\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\'And are all those traps for the Emperor?\' Maurice jokingly asked the\r\nservant, as she spread a clean white cloth on his table.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, for the Emperor and no one else,\' she answered, with a gay\r\nsprightly air, pleased to have an opportunity of showing her fresh\r\nwhite teeth. Then she began to enumerate all there was; having learnt\r\nthis, no doubt, from the grooms who had been coming to drink at the\r\ntavern since the day before. To begin with, there was the staff of\r\ntwenty-five officers, the sixty Cent-Gardes, the escort-detachment of\r\nGuides,[15] the six Gendarmes of the provostship service; then the\r\nhousehold, comprising seventy-three persons, chamberlains, valets\r\nand footmen, cooks and scullions; next four saddle-horses and two\r\ncarriages for the Emperor, ten horses for the equerries, and eight for\r\nthe outriders and grooms, without counting forty-seven posting horses;\r\nthen a _char \xc3\xa0 bancs_ and twelve baggage vans, two of which, reserved\r\nto the cooks, had excited the girl\'s admiration by the large quantity\r\nof kitchen utensils, plates, and bottles that could be seen inside\r\nthem, all in beautiful order. \'Ah! sir,\' she said to Maurice, \'I never\r\nsaw such saucepans before! They shine like the sun! And there are all\r\nsorts of dishes and vessels, and things I can\'t even tell the use of!\r\nAnd wine, too--bordeaux, and burgundy, and champagne enough to give a\r\nsplendid wedding feast.\'\r\n\r\nWell pleased at sight of the clean white cloth and the light golden\r\nwine sparkling in his glass, Maurice ate a couple of boiled eggs with\r\na gluttonous enjoyment he had never before experienced. Whenever he\r\nturned his head to the left he obtained, through one of the entrances\r\nto the arbour, a view of the vast tent-covered plain, the swarming city\r\nthat had just sprung up amid the stubble between Rheims and the canal.\r\nOnly a few meagre clumps of trees dotted the grey expanse, where three\r\nmills upreared their slender arms. Above the confused roofs of Rheims,\r\nintermingled with the crests of chestnut trees, the colossal pile of\r\nthe cathedral stood out in the blue atmosphere, looking, though far\r\naway, quite gigantic by the side of the low houses. And, on seeing it,\r\nrecollections of schoolboy days came back to Maurice. Lessons that\r\nhe had learnt and hemmed and hawed over returned to his mind: the\r\ncoronations of the French Kings in Rheims Cathedral, the holy oil,\r\nClovis, Joan of Arc--all the departed glories of ancient France.\r\n\r\nThen, again thinking of the Emperor hidden away in that modest private\r\nhouse so discreetly closed, Maurice turned his eyes once more on the\r\nhigh yellow wall, and was surprised to read on it the inscription,\r\n\'Vive Napol\xc3\xa9on!\' traced in huge letters with a bit of charcoal,\r\nbeside some clumsy obscene drawings. The rain had washed away the\r\nyellow distemper that had previously concealed the writing, and the\r\ninscription was evidently an old one. How singular to find upon that\r\nwall this acclamation, born of the warlike enthusiasm of long ago,\r\nand intended, undoubtedly, for the uncle, the conquering Napoleon,\r\nnot his nephew! At sight of it, all Maurice\'s childhood arose before\r\nhim, carolling in his mind, and again he listened to the tales of\r\nhis grandfather, a soldier of the Grand Army. His mother was dead,\r\nand his father had been obliged to accept a post of tax collector,\r\nno opportunities for winning glory being vouchsafed to the sons of\r\nthe heroes of France after the fall of the First Empire. And the\r\ngrandfather lived with them on a most meagre pension, fallen to the\r\nlevel of this modest home, and having but one consolation, that of\r\nrecounting his campaigns to his grandchildren, the twins, boy and girl,\r\neach with the same fair hair, and whose mother he, in some measure,\r\nwas. He would seat Henriette on his left knee, and Maurice on his\r\nright, and then, during long hours, there followed Homeric tales of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThese tales did not seem to belong to history; different periods\r\nwere blended, and all the nations of the earth met together in one\r\ngreat, fearful collision. The English, the Austrians, the Prussians,\r\nthe Russians passed by--now in turn, now all at the same time--just\r\nas alliances willed it, and without it being possible to say why some\r\nwere beaten rather than others. But beaten they were, inevitably\r\nbeaten in advance by a great dash of heroism and genius which swept\r\narmies away as if they had been merely chaff. There was Marengo, the\r\nclassical engagement on level ground, with the long lines of troops\r\nskilfully deployed, and the faultless retreat in \xc3\xa9chelon order of the\r\nbattalions so silent and impassive under fire. This was the legendary\r\nbattle lost at three o\'clock, won at six; the battle when eight hundred\r\ngrenadiers of the Consular Guard arrested the onslaught of the entire\r\nAustrian cavalry; when Desaix came up to meet his death and to change\r\nan impending rout into an immortal victory. Then there was Austerlitz,\r\nwith its beautiful sun of glory shining through the wintry mist;\r\nAusterlitz, commencing with the capture of the plateau of Pritzen and\r\nending with the terrifying disruption of the ice on the frozen lakes,\r\nwhen an entire Russian army corps, men and horses, sank into the water\r\namid a frightful crash; whilst the god-like Napoleon, who had naturally\r\nforeseen everything, completed the disaster with his round shot. Next\r\nthere was Jena, where Prussia\'s power was entombed; at first, the\r\nskirmishers firing through the October fog, and Ney, by his impatience,\r\nalmost compromising everything; then Augereau\'s advance that extricated\r\nNey, the great onslaught, so violent that it swept away the enemy\'s\r\nentire centre; and finally the panic, the _sauve-qui-peut_ of an\r\nover-vaunted cavalry, whom the French Hussars mowed down like ripe\r\noats, strewing the romantic valley with men and horses. Then there was\r\nEylau--Eylau, the abominable--the most bloody of battles, when such was\r\nthe slaughter that the hideously disfigured bodies lay on the ground\r\nin heaps; Eylau, blood red under its snow storm, with its mournful\r\ncemetery of heroes; Eylau still loudly re-echoing the thunderous charge\r\nof Murat\'s eighty squadrons, which cut right through the Russian army\r\nand strewed the field with such a depth of corpses that even Napoleon\r\nhimself wept at the sight.\r\n\r\nThen there was Friedland, the fearful trap into which the Russians,\r\nlike a flight of careless sparrows, again fell; Friedland, the\r\nstrategical masterpiece of that Emperor who knew everything and could\r\ndo everything. At first the French left wing remained motionless and\r\nimperturbable, whilst Ney, having captured the town, was destroying\r\nthe bridges; then the French left wing rushed upon the enemy\'s right,\r\nthrowing it into the river, overwhelming it in the inextricable\r\nposition into which it had been forced; and so much slaughter had to\r\nbe accomplished that the French were still killing the foe at ten\r\no\'clock at night. Next there was Wagram--the Austrians wishing to\r\ncut the French off from the Danube, and repeatedly reinforcing their\r\nleft wing so that they might overcome Mass\xc3\xa9na, who, being wounded,\r\nreclined in a carriage whilst commanding his troops; and meantime the\r\nartful, Titanic Napoleon allowed the Austrians to pursue this course\r\ntill all at once the terrible fire of a hundred guns rained upon their\r\nweakened centre, sweeping it more than a league away; whereupon their\r\nleft wing, terrified at its isolation, and already falling back before\r\nMass\xc3\xa9na, who had retrieved his earlier reverses, carried off with it\r\nthe remainder of the Austrian army with devastation akin to that caused\r\nby a breaking dyke. And at last there was the Moskowa, when the bright\r\nsun of Austerlitz shone out again for the last time, a terrible _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_\r\nof men, with all the confusion born of vast numbers of antagonists and\r\nof stubborn courage, hillocks carried under an incessant fusillade,\r\nredoubts captured by assault at the bayonet\'s point, repeated offensive\r\nreturns of the enemy, who disputed the ground inch by inch, and such\r\ndesperate bravery on the part of the Russian Guards that the furious\r\ncharges of Murat, the simultaneous thunder of three hundred guns, and\r\nall the valour of Ney, the triumphant prince of the day, were needed\r\nto secure victory. But whatever the battle was, the flags were stirred\r\nby the same glorious fluttering in the evening air; the same shouts of\r\n\'Vive Napol\xc3\xa9on!\' resounded when the bivouac fires were being lighted on\r\nthe conquered positions; France was everywhere at home--a conqueress\r\nwho marched her invincible eagles from one end of Europe to the other,\r\nand who needed but to set her foot on the soil of foreign kingdoms for\r\nthe humbled nations to sink into the ground!\r\n\r\nLess intoxicated by the white wine that sparkled in his glass than by\r\nthe glorious memories carolling in his mind, Maurice was finishing\r\nhis chop when his glance fell upon two ragged, mud-stained soldiers,\r\nwho looked like bandits weary of roaming the highways; and on hearing\r\nthem question the servant girl respecting the precise positions of the\r\nregiments encamped alongside the canal, he called out to them, \'Eh,\r\ncomrades, here! You belong to the Seventh Corps, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course--to the first division,\' replied one of the men; \'there\'s\r\nno mistake about it I warrant you. The best proof is, I was at\r\nFr\xc5\x93schweiler, where it wasn\'t cold by any means. And the comrade here\r\nbelongs to the First Corps--he was at Weissenburg, another filthy hole!\'\r\n\r\nThen they told their tale, how both being slightly wounded they had\r\nfallen in the panic and the rout, lying half dead with fatigue in a\r\nditch, and then dragging themselves along in the rear of the army,\r\nforced by exhausting attacks of fever to linger behind in the towns,\r\nand so belated at last that they were now only just arriving, somewhat\r\nrestored to health, and bent upon joining their squads. Maurice, who\r\nwas about to tackle a piece of Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese, noticed, with his heart\r\noppressed, the envious glances which they darted at his plate. \'Some\r\nmore cheese, and some bread and some wine!\' he called. \'You\'ll join me,\r\ncomrades, eh? I stand treat! Here\'s to your health!\'\r\n\r\nThey sat down delighted; and Maurice, with an increasing chill at his\r\nheart, noted to what a lamentable condition they had fallen, with no\r\nweapons, and with their overcoats and red trousers fastened with so\r\nmany bits of string, and patched with so many different shreds of\r\ncloth that they looked like pillagers--gipsies who had donned some old\r\ngarments stolen from corpses on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! curse it, yes!\' resumed the bigger of the two, with his mouth\r\nfull. \'It wasn\'t all fun over there. You should have seen it. Just tell\r\nyour tale, Coutard.\'\r\n\r\nThen the little one, gesticulating with a hunk of bread in his hand,\r\nbegan his story: \'I was washing my shirt while the _soupe_ was being\r\ngot ready--we were in a beastly hole, a regular funnel with big woods\r\nall round it which enabled those swinish Prussians to creep up on all\r\nfours without our knowing it--then, just at seven o\'clock, their shells\r\nbegan falling in our pots. We rushed to arms in a jiffy, curse it!\r\nand up to eleven o\'clock we fancied we were giving them a downright\r\nlicking--but there weren\'t more than five thousand of us, you must\r\nknow, and fresh detachments of those pigs kept constantly coming up. I\r\nwas on a little hill, lying down behind a bush, and in front of me and\r\nright and left of me I could see them marching up, swarming like ants,\r\nlike lines of black ants that never came to an end. Well, you know, we\r\ncouldn\'t help thinking that the commanders were regular duffers to have\r\nshoved us into such a wasp\'s nest, far away from our comrades, and to\r\nleave us there too, to be crushed without any help coming. Then, in the\r\nmidst of it all, our general, that poor devil General Douay,[16] who\r\nwas neither a fool nor a capon, was hit by a ball and toppled over with\r\nhis legs in the air. His account was settled! All the same, we still\r\nheld out, but there were too many of them, and we had to slope. Next we\r\nfought in an inclosure, and defended the station with such a thundering\r\nrow going on that one was quite deafened. Then, I hardly know, but the\r\ntown must have been captured, and we found ourselves on a mountain--the\r\nGeissberg they call it, I think--and there, having entrenched ourselves\r\nin a kind of ch\xc3\xa2teau, we kept on potting those pigs. They jumped into\r\nthe air as we hit them, and it was a sight to see how they came down\r\nagain on their snouts. But it was all no good; they kept on coming\r\nup till they were quite ten to one, and with as many guns as they\r\nwanted.[17] It is all very well to be brave, but bravery in an affair\r\nlike that simply means leaving one\'s carcase on the field. Well, we\r\nwere quite in a jelly at last, and we had to take ourselves off. All\r\nthe same, our officers showed themselves regular duffers--didn\'t they,\r\nPicot?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Picot, the taller of the two men, drained a glass\r\nof white wine, and then, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,\r\nrejoined: \'Of course. It was the same at Fr\xc5\x93schweiler. Only idiots\r\nwould have thought of giving battle with affairs in such a state. My\r\ncaptain, an artful little beggar, said so. The truth is, the commanders\r\ncan have known nothing. An entire army of those beasts fell on us when\r\nwe were barely forty thousand. No fighting was expected that day, it\r\nseems; but the battle began little by little, without the officers\r\nwanting it. Of course, I didn\'t see everything, but I know well enough\r\nthat the dancing went on all day, and that just when one thought it had\r\nended the music began afresh. First at W\xc5\x93rth, a pretty little village\r\nwith a comical steeple, covered with earthenware tiles, which make it\r\nlook like a stove. The devil, too, if I know why we were ordered out\r\nof W\xc5\x93rth in the morning, for afterwards we had to fight, tooth and\r\nnail, to try and recapture it. But we didn\'t succeed. Ah! my boys,\r\nwe did have a job there. You should have seen all the bellies ripped\r\nopen and the brains scattered about. It was incredible. Then we had a\r\nset-to round another village--Elsasshausen, a beastly name to remember.\r\nWe were being mowed down by a lot of guns which were firing at their\r\nease from another cursed hill, which we had also given up in the\r\nmorning. And then it was that I saw, yes, I myself saw the charge of\r\nthe Cuirassiers. Ah! how the poor devils did get themselves killed! It\r\nwas pitiful to send men and horses charging over such ground as that, a\r\nslope covered with scrub and full of ditches. And, besides, worse luck,\r\nit could be of no earthly use. All the same, however, it was brave, it\r\nwas a grand sight to see. And after that? Well, after that it seemed\r\nas if we had no other course but to try and take ourselves off. The\r\nvillage was burning like tinder, the Badeners, the Wurtembergers, and\r\nthe Prussians--the whole band, in fact--one hundred and twenty thousand\r\nof those beasts, had ended by surrounding us. But we didn\'t go off. The\r\nmusic began again round Fr\xc5\x93schweiler. The plain truth is, MacMahon may\r\nbe a duffer, but he\'s plucky. You should have seen him on his big horse\r\nin the midst of the shells! Any other man would have bolted at the\r\noutset, thinking it no shame to refuse battle when one isn\'t in force.\r\nBut he, as the fighting had begun, determined to let the skull-cracking\r\ngo on to the bitter end. And he managed it, too! In Fr\xc5\x93schweiler we\r\nweren\'t like men fighting; we were like animals, eating one another.\r\nFor a couple of hours the gutters ran with blood----. And then? Well,\r\nwe had to skedaddle at last! And to think we learned just then that we\r\nhad overthrown the Bavarians on our left! Ah! curse it, if we, too, had\r\nonly had a hundred and twenty thousand men, if we had only had enough\r\nguns and not quite such duffing officers!\'\r\n\r\nStill exasperated and violently inclined, Coutard and Picot, in their\r\nragged uniforms grey with dust, were cutting themselves hunks of bread\r\nand bolting big bits of cheese, whilst venting their nightmare-like\r\nsouvenirs under the beautiful vine with its ripe grapes spangled\r\nwith golden darts by the sun. They had now come to the fearful rout\r\nthat had followed the battle; the disbanded, demoralised, hungry\r\nregiments fleeing through the fields; the high roads one stream of\r\nmen, horses, carts, and guns in frightful confusion; all the wreckage\r\nof an annihilated army, lashed onward in its retreat by the mad blast\r\nof panic. Since they had not been able to fall back in good order\r\nand defend the passages of the Vosges, where ten thousand men might\r\nhave stopped a hundred thousand, at least they might have blown up\r\nthe bridges and filled up the tunnels. But the generals bolted in\r\nthe universal scare, and such a tempest of stupefaction swept along,\r\ncarrying off both vanquishers and vanquished, that for a moment the two\r\nconflicting armies lost one another--MacMahon hurrying in the direction\r\nof Lun\xc3\xa9ville, whilst the Crown Prince of Prussia was looking for him\r\nin the direction of the Vosges. On August 7 the remnants of the First\r\nFrench Army Corps swept through Saverne like a muddy, overflowing\r\nstream laden with wreckage. On the 8th, the Fifth Corps fell in with\r\nthe First at Saarburg, like one torrent flowing into another. The\r\nFifth Corps was also in full flight, beaten without having fought, and\r\ncarrying along with it its commander, that sorry General de Failly,\r\nwho was distracted to find that the responsibility of the defeat\r\nwas ascribed to his inaction. On the 9th and 10th the flying gallop\r\ncontinued, a mad _sauve-qui-peut_, in which no one halted even to look\r\nround. On the 11th, in the pouring rain, they descended towards Bayon,\r\nso as to avoid Nancy, which was falsely rumoured to be in the enemy\'s\r\nhands. On the 12th they encamped at Harou\xc3\xa9; on the 13th at Vicherey;\r\nand next day they reached Neufch\xc3\xa2teau, where the railway at last\r\ngathered together this drifting mass of men, who, during three entire\r\ndays, were shovelled into the trains, so that they might be conveyed\r\nto Ch\xc3\xa2lons. Four-and-twenty hours after the last train had started the\r\nPrussians came up.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! cursed luck!\' concluded Picot. \'We had to use our legs, and no\r\nmistake. And we two had been left at the infirmary.\'\r\n\r\nCoutard was just emptying the bottle into his comrade\'s glass and his\r\nown: \'Yes,\' said he, \'we took ourselves off, and we\'ve been on the road\r\never since. All the same, however, one feels better now that one can\r\ndrink to the health of those that haven\'t had their skulls cracked.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice now understood everything. After so stupidly allowing\r\nthemselves to be surprised at Weissenburg, the crushing, lightning\r\nstroke of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler had fallen on the French, its sinister glare\r\ncasting a vivid light upon the terrible truth. France was not ready,\r\nshe had neither cannon, nor men, nor generals; and the enemy, treated\r\nwith such contempt, proved to be strong and solid, innumerable,\r\nperfect alike in discipline and tactics. Through the weak screen\r\nformed of the seven French Army Corps, disseminated between Metz and\r\nStrasburg, the foe had literally punched his way. Of a certainty France\r\nwould now be left to her own resources; neither Austria nor Italy would\r\njoin her; the Emperor\'s plan had crumbled away through the delay in\r\nthe operations and the incapacity of the commanders. And even fatality\r\nwas working against the French, accumulating mishaps and deplorable\r\ncoincidences, and enabling the Prussians to carry out their secret\r\nplan, which was to cut the French armies in two and throw one portion\r\nof them under Metz, that it might be isolated from the rest of France,\r\nwhilst they--the invaders--marched upon Paris, after destroying the\r\nother portion. Already, at this stage, everything was mathematically\r\nclear. France was bound to be beaten, through causes the inevitable\r\neffects of which were already apparent; and this war was but a conflict\r\nbetween unintelligent bravery on the one hand, and superiority of\r\nnumbers and calm methodical strategy on the other. Dispute about it as\r\none might later on, in any and every case, no matter what might have\r\nbeen done, defeat was a fatal certainty, predetermined by the laws that\r\nrule the world.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as Maurice\'s dreamy eyes wandered away, they espied those\r\nwords, \'Vive Napol\xc3\xa9on!\' traced in charcoal on the high yellow wall in\r\nfront of him. He experienced an unbearable feeling of uneasiness at\r\nthe sight; a sudden burning pang shot through his heart. So it was\r\ntrue that France, the France of the legendary victories, that had\r\nmarched with beating drums through Europe, had now been thrown to\r\nthe ground by a petty nation which it had despised. Fifty years had\r\nsufficed to change the world, and defeat was falling heavy and fearful\r\non those who had once been conquerors. Maurice remembered all that\r\nhis brother-in-law Weiss had told him on that night of anguish before\r\nMulhausen. Yes, Weiss alone had shown any prescience, guessing the\r\nslow, hidden causes of the decline of France, perceiving what a breeze\r\nof youth and strength was blowing from Germany. One warlike age was\r\nending; another was beginning. Woe to those who halt in the continuous\r\neffort which nations must make; victory belongs to those who march in\r\nthe van, to the most accomplished, the healthiest, and the strongest!\r\n\r\nJust then a girl\'s screams were heard. Lieutenant Rochas, like a\r\nconquering trooper, was kissing the pretty servant in the smoky\r\nold kitchen, brightened by cheap coloured prints. He stepped into\r\nthe arbour and ordered coffee, and, having overheard the last words\r\nof Coutard and Picot, he gaily remarked, \'Pooh! my lads, all that\'s\r\nnothing. It\'s only the beginning of the dance; you\'re going to see the\r\nrevenge we\'ll have now. So far, they\'ve been five to one. But it\'s all\r\ngoing to change, take my word for it. There are three hundred thousand\r\nof us here. All the movements we are making, and which you don\'t\r\nunderstand, are to draw the Prussians down on us, whilst Bazaine, who\'s\r\nwatching them, takes them in flank. Then we\'ll just squash them--like\r\nthis fly.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he crushed a passing fly with a loud clap of his hands;\r\nand he talked on gaily, believing, in his childish simplicity, in the\r\nsuccess of this easy plan, and having recovered all his pristine faith\r\nin the invincibility of bravery. He obligingly acquainted the two\r\nsoldiers with the exact positions of their regiments, and then, feeling\r\nquite happy, he sat himself down with a cigar between his teeth, in\r\nfront of his cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\'The pleasure has been mine, comrades,\' replied Maurice to Coutard\r\nand Picot, as, in taking themselves off, they thanked him for the\r\ncheese and the bottle of wine. He also had ordered some coffee, and he\r\nsat there looking at Rochas, and sharing his good humour, though he\r\nwas surprised that an officer should talk of three hundred thousand\r\nmen when they were barely more than one hundred thousand, and that\r\nhe should consider the crushing of the Prussians between the army of\r\nCh\xc3\xa2lons and the army of Metz such a remarkably easy affair. But, on\r\nthe other hand, Maurice felt such a need of illusions! Might he not\r\ncontinue hoping in victory, when the glorious past was carolling so\r\nloudly in his memory? The old _guinguette_ had such a joyous aspect\r\ntoo, with its creeping vine, whence dangled the clear sun-gilt grapes\r\nof France! Once more did Maurice experience an hour\'s confidence rising\r\nabove all the secret sadness that had slowly gathered in his heart.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there he noticed an officer of Chasseurs d\'Afrique ride\r\npast at a rapid trot, followed by his orderly, and disappear round\r\nthe corner of the silent house occupied by the Emperor. Then, as the\r\norderly returned alone, and halted with both horses at the door of the\r\ntavern, Maurice gave a cry of surprise: \'What, Prosper! Why, I thought\r\nyou were at Metz!\'\r\n\r\nThe newcomer was a simple farm-hand of Remilly, whom Maurice had known\r\nwhen a child, at the time when he went to spend his holidays at uncle\r\nFouchard\'s. Having been taken at the conscription, Prosper had already\r\nspent three years in Algeria when the war broke out, and, with his long\r\nthin face and his supple sturdy limbs, with which he was wonderfully\r\nadroit, he looked to great advantage in his sky-blue jacket, his full\r\nred trousers with blue stripes, and his ample red woollen sash. \'What!\r\nMonsieur Maurice,\' he said. \'Here\'s an unexpected meeting!\'\r\n\r\nHe did not hurry to join his friend, however, but forthwith took the\r\nsteaming horses to the stable, eyeing his own mount with quite a\r\npaternal air. It was love of horseflesh, dating from childhood, from\r\nthe time when he had taken the teams to the fields, that had induced\r\nhim to enter the cavalry service. \'We\'ve just come from Monthois, ten\r\nleagues at a stretch,\' he said to Maurice, when he returned, \'and\r\nZephyr needs a feed.\' Zephyr was his horse. For his own part he refused\r\nto eat anything, and would only accept some coffee. He had to wait\r\nfor his officer, who, on his side, had to wait for the Emperor. They\r\nmight be five minutes there, or two hours, there was no telling, so\r\nhis officer had told him to bait the horses. Then as Maurice, whose\r\ncuriosity was roused, questioned him as to why the officer wanted\r\nto see the Emperor, he replied; \'I don\'t know--some commission of\r\ncourse--some papers to hand in.\'\r\n\r\nRochas was eyeing Prosper with a softened glance, the sight of the\r\nchasseur uniform having revived his own recollections of Algeria. \'And\r\nwhere were you, out there, my lad?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'At Medeah, sir.\'\r\n\r\nMedeah! Thereupon they began talking together like comrades, all\r\nregulations notwithstanding. Prosper had grown accustomed to that\r\nAlgerian life of constant alerts, a life spent on horseback, the\r\nmen setting out to fight as they might have set out on some hunting\r\nexcursion, some great _battue_ of Arabs. There was but one platter for\r\neach \'tribe\'[18] of six men; and each \'tribe\' was a family, one member\r\nof which did the cooking, whilst another did the washing, and the\r\nothers pitched the tents, groomed the horses, and furbished the arms.\r\nThey rode on through the morning and afternoon, laden with weighty\r\nburdens, in a heat as heavy as lead. Then in the evening they lighted\r\nlarge fires to drive away the mosquitoes, and gathered around to sing\r\nsongs of France. During the clear, star-spangled nights it was often\r\nnecessary to get up to quiet the horses, who, incommoded by the warm\r\nbreeze, would suddenly begin to bite one another and tear up their\r\npickets, neighing furiously. Then, too, there was the coffee, a great\r\naffair, the delicious coffee which they crushed in a pan and strained\r\nthrough one of their red regulation sashes. But there were also the\r\nblack days, spent far from all human habitations, face to face with\r\nthe enemy. Then there were no more camp-fires, no more songs, no more\r\nsprees. They suffered fearfully at times from thirst, hunger, and\r\nlack of sleep. Yet all the same they were fond of that adventurous\r\nlife full of unexpected incidents, that skirmishing warfare so well\r\nadapted to deeds of personal bravery, and as amusing as the conquest\r\nof some island of savages, enlivened by razzias or wholesale pillaging\r\nexpeditions, and by the petty thefts of the marauders, many of whose\r\ncunning exploits had become quite legendary, and made even the generals\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Prosper, suddenly becoming grave; \'it\'s not the same here;\r\nwe fight differently.\'\r\n\r\nIn reply to further questions from Maurice, he then related their\r\nlanding at Toulon, and their long and wearisome journey to Lun\xc3\xa9ville.\r\nIt was there they had heard of Weissenburg and Fr\xc5\x93schweiler. He hardly\r\nrecollected their line of route after that; they had gone, he thought,\r\nfrom Nancy to St. Mihiel, and then on to Metz. A great battle must have\r\nbeen fought on the 14th, for the horizon was aglow with fire; for his\r\nown part, however, he had only seen four Uhlans behind a hedge. On the\r\n16th there had been more fighting, the guns had begun thundering at six\r\nin the morning, and he had heard say that the dance had begun again\r\non the 18th, more terrible than ever.[19] The Chasseurs d\'Afrique,\r\nhowever, were then no longer with the army, for on the 16th, whilst\r\nthey were drawn up along a road near Gravelotte, waiting for orders,\r\nthe Emperor, who was driving off in a carriage, took them along with\r\nhim to escort him to Verdun. A nice ride that was, more than twenty-six\r\nmiles at a gallop, with the fear that the Prussians might intercept\r\nthem at every turn of the road.\r\n\r\n\'And Bazaine?\' asked Rochas.\r\n\r\n\'Bazaine? It\'s said he was devilish pleased that the Emperor had taken\r\nhimself off.\'\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant wished to know, however, if Bazaine were approaching,\r\nand Prosper could only reply by a gesture. Who could tell? He and his\r\ncomrades had spent long days marching and counter-marching in the\r\nrain, in reconnoitring, and on outpost duty--and without once seeing\r\nan enemy. They now belonged to the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons. His regiment, with\r\ntwo others of Chasseurs and one of Hussars, formed the first division\r\nof the reserve cavalry, and were commanded by General Margueritte, of\r\nwhom Prosper spoke with enthusiastic affection. \'Ah! the devil,\' said\r\nhe, \'there\'s a lion for you! But what good is it?--so far they\'ve never\r\nknown what to do with us except to send us floundering through the mud.\'\r\n\r\nA pause followed, and then Maurice talked about Remilly and uncle\r\nFouchard, and Prosper expressed his regret at not being able to go\r\nand shake hands with Honor\xc3\xa9, the quartermaster, whose battery must\r\nbe stationed more than a league away, on the other side of the road\r\nto Laon. Hearing a horse snort, however, he rose and hurried off\r\nto satisfy himself that Zephyr wanted nothing. It was the time for\r\ncoffee and for something short to help it down, and soldiers of all\r\narms and all ranks were now invading the tavern. There was not an\r\nunoccupied table, and bright was the display of uniforms amid the green\r\nvine-leaves flecked with sunshine. Surgeon-Major Bouroche had just\r\nseated himself beside Rochas, when Jean appeared and addressed himself\r\nto the lieutenant: \'The captain will expect you at three o\'clock, for\r\norders, sir.\'\r\n\r\nRochas nodded, as much as to say that he would be punctual, and Jean,\r\ninstead of immediately retiring, turned to smile at Maurice, who was\r\nlighting a cigarette. Since the scene in the train, there was a tacit\r\ntruce between the two men, as though they were studying one another in\r\na more and more kindly way.\r\n\r\nProsper, who had just returned, now exclaimed impatiently: \'I shall\r\nhave something to eat if my officer doesn\'t come out of that shanty.\r\nIt\'s disgusting; the Emperor may not be back before to-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' exclaimed Maurice, whose curiosity was again aroused, \'it\'s\r\nperhaps some news of Bazaine that you\'ve brought?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps so. They were talking about him at Monthois.\'\r\n\r\nJust then there was a sudden stir, and Jean, who had been standing\r\nat one of the entrances of the arbour, turned round and said: \'The\r\nEmperor!\'\r\n\r\nThey all sprang to their feet. Between the poplars lining the white\r\nhigh road there appeared a platoon of Cent-Gardes still correctly\r\ndressed in their luxurious, resplendent uniforms, with large golden\r\nsuns glittering upon their breastplates. In the open space behind\r\nthem came the Emperor on horseback, escorted by his staff, which was\r\nfollowed by a second detachment of Cent-Gardes. Everyone uncovered,\r\nand a few acclamations were heard; and the Emperor raised his head as\r\nhe passed by, so that one could clearly see his face, drawn and very\r\npale, with dim wavering eyes which appeared full of water. He seemed as\r\nif he were waking out of a doze, smiled faintly at sight of the sunlit\r\ntavern, and then saluted.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Bouroche had darted at Napoleon the quick glance of an\r\nexperienced practitioner, and Jean and Maurice, who were standing in\r\nfront of the surgeon, distinctly heard him growl: \'There\'s a nasty\r\nstone there, and no mistake.\' And then he completed his diagnosis in\r\ntwo words, \'_Done for_!\'\r\n\r\nJean, with his narrow-minded common-sense, had shaken his head\r\nsorrowfully; what fearful bad luck for an army to have such a chief\r\nas that! Ten minutes later, when Maurice, after shaking hands with\r\nProsper, went off delighted with his nicely served breakfast, to stroll\r\nabout and smoke some more cigarettes, he carried away with him the\r\nrecollection of that pale, dim-eyed Emperor, passing by on horseback\r\nat a jog-trot. So that was the conspirator, the dreamer deficient in\r\nenergy at the decisive moment. He was said to be kind-hearted, to be\r\nquite capable of great and generous ideas, and, silent man that he\r\nwas, to have a very tenacious will; and he was also undoubtedly very\r\nbrave, disdainful of danger, like a fatalist always ready to accept his\r\ndestiny. But in great crises he seemed struck with stupor, paralysed\r\nas it were in presence of accomplished facts; and thenceforward he was\r\nunable to contend against evil fortune. Maurice wondered if this were\r\nnot some special physiological condition which agony had aggravated; if\r\nthe disease from which the Emperor was evidently suffering were not the\r\ncause of the growing indecision and incapacity that he had displayed\r\nsince the outset of the campaign. In that way, everything would have\r\nbeen explained. A grain of sand in a man\'s flesh, and empires totter\r\nand fall!\r\n\r\nQuite a stir suddenly arose in camp that evening after the roll call,\r\nthe officers running hither and thither, transmitting orders, and\r\narranging everything for the men\'s departure next morning at five\r\no\'clock. With mingled surprise and disquietude, Maurice learnt that\r\neverything was again changed, and that instead of falling back on\r\nParis they were about to march on Verdun, in view of joining Bazaine.\r\nA rumour circulated that a despatch had arrived from the latter\r\nduring the day, announcing that he was effecting his retreat; and\r\nMaurice then remembered Prosper and the officer he had come with from\r\nMonthois, perhaps to bring the Emperor a copy of this despatch. Thus\r\nthe Empress-Regent and the Council of Ministers, so frightened at the\r\nthought of the Emperor\'s return to Paris, and so obstinately bent\r\nupon throwing the army forward at any cost in order that it might\r\nmake a supreme attempt to save the dynasty, had triumphed at last\r\nover the perpetual hesitation of Marshal MacMahon. And that wretched\r\nEmperor, that poor devil who no longer had any place in his own empire,\r\nwas to be carried off like a useless, cumbersome parcel among the\r\nbaggage-train of his troops, condemned--oh! the irony of it--to drag\r\nafter him all his Imperial household, his bodyguards, his carriages,\r\nhis horses, his cooks, his vans full of silver saucepans and sparkling\r\nwine of Champagne--in a word, all the pomp of his bee-spangled,\r\nimperial robes, which could now only serve to sweep up the blood and\r\nmire that covered the high-roads of defeat!\r\n\r\nAt midnight, Maurice had not yet got to sleep. Feverish insomnia,\r\nfraught with ugly dreams, made him turn over and over in the tent.\r\nAt last he ended by coming outside, and felt relieved on standing\r\nup and inhaling the cold, wind-swept air. The sky was covered with\r\nhuge clouds, the night was becoming very dense, with an infinitely\r\nmournful darkness, which the last expiring fires along the camp\r\nfront faintly illumined with star-like lights. And amidst the black,\r\nsilent peacefulness one could detect the slow breathing of the\r\nhundred thousand men who were lying there. Then Maurice\'s anguish\r\nbecame quieted, and a feeling of fraternity came to him, of indulgent\r\naffection for all those living sleepers, thousands of whom would soon\r\nbe sleeping the sleep of death. After all, they were good fellows.\r\nThey were scarcely disciplined; they got drunk, and they robbed; but\r\nwhat sufferings had they not already endured, and what excuses there\r\nwere for them in the Downfall of the entire nation! Among them there\r\nremained but a small number of the glorious veterans of Sebastopol and\r\nSolferino, mingled with men who were but lads, and incapable of any\r\nprolonged resistance. These four army corps, hastily assembled and\r\nreorganised, without any solid ties to bind them together, formed, so\r\nto say, the army of despair, the expiatory flock which was to be sent\r\nto the sacrifice in an endeavour to avert the anger of Destiny. And\r\nthis army must climb its Calvary to the bitter end, paying, with the\r\nred flood of its blood, for the faults of everyone, and attaining to\r\nfame by the very horror of the disasters that awaited it.\r\n\r\nMeditating thus in the depths of the quivering darkness, Maurice became\r\nconscious of the great duty that lay before him. He no longer indulged\r\nthe braggart hope of repeating the legendary victories. This march upon\r\nVerdun was a march to Death, and he accepted it with stout and cheerful\r\nresignation, since die he must.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nON THE MARCH--THE SPY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camp was raised on Tuesday, August 23, at six o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, and the hundred thousand men of the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons set out\r\non the march, flowing away in an immense stream, like some human river\r\nresuming its torrential course after expanding for a time into a lake.\r\nDespite the rumours current the evening before, it was a thorough\r\nsurprise to many of the men to find that, instead of continuing their\r\nmovement of retreat, they now had to turn their backs on Paris, and\r\nmarch towards the East--towards the Unknown.\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock in the morning, the Seventh Army Corps had not received\r\nany cartridges. For two days past the artillerymen had been exhausting\r\nthemselves in removing their horses and _mat\xc3\xa9riel_ from the railway\r\nstation, which was encumbered with supplies sent back from Metz. And\r\nit was only at the last moment that the vans laden with the ammunition\r\nwere discovered among the fearful jumble of trains, and that a fatigue\r\ncompany, of which Jean formed part, was able to remove some 240,000\r\ncartridges in hastily requisitioned vehicles. Jean distributed the\r\nregulation hundred cartridges to each of the men of his squad at the\r\nvery moment when Gaude, the company\'s bugler, began to sound the march.\r\n\r\nThe 106th did not have to pass through Rheims. Its orders were to skirt\r\nthe town and make for the Ch\xc3\xa2lons high road. Once again, however, the\r\ncommanders had neglected to regulate the men\'s departure at proper\r\nintervals, and, as the four army corps set out at the same time,\r\nextreme confusion arose when they debouched from the various bye-roads\r\ninto the highways they were to follow in common. At every moment the\r\nartillery and cavalry intercepted the infantry, and compelled the\r\nlatter to halt. Entire brigades had to wait for an hour in ploughed\r\nfields, and with arms grounded, until the roads should become clear.\r\nThe worst was that a frightful storm burst some ten minutes after the\r\nstart--a perfect deluge, which fell during more than an hour, soaking\r\nthe men to the skin and rendering their heavy capotes and knapsacks\r\nstill more oppressive. The 106th, however, was able to resume its march\r\njust as the rain was ceasing; whilst some Zouaves, who were still\r\nobliged to wait in a field hard by, devised, by way of taking patience,\r\na little pastime to amuse themselves--that of assailing one another\r\nwith balls of earth, huge lumps of mud, the splashing of which on the\r\nuniforms of those who were hit provoked uproarious laughter. Almost\r\nimmediately afterwards the sun reappeared, the triumphant sun of a warm\r\nAugust morning. Then gaiety returned, the men steamed--much as washing\r\nsteams before the fire--and they were soon dry, looking like so many\r\ndirty dogs pulled out of a pond, and joking with one another respecting\r\nthe hard crusty mud that dangled from their red trousers. It was still\r\nnecessary to stop and wait at each cross road, but at last there came a\r\nfinal halt at the end of one of the Rheims suburbs, just in front of a\r\ntavern, which never seemed to empty.\r\n\r\nIt then occurred to Maurice to stand treat to the squad by way of\r\nwishing them all good luck--\'if you\'ll allow it, corporal,\' said he.\r\n\r\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Jean accepted a drop of something short.\r\nLoubet and Chouteau were there, the latter slyly respectful since he\r\nhad seen Jean\'s fists so near his face; and Pache and Lapoulle were\r\nthere also, good fellows both of them, when others did not set them\r\nagog. \'To your health, corporal!\' said Chouteau, in an unctuous voice.\r\n\r\n\'To yours, and may we all bring our heads and feet back,\' politely\r\nreplied Jean, amid an approving titter.\r\n\r\nThe others were starting, however, and Captain Beaudoin had already\r\ndrawn near, apparently greatly shocked, and bent on reprimanding the\r\ntipplers, whereas Lieutenant Rochas, indulgent when his men were\r\nthirsty, affected to look in another direction. And now they sped along\r\nthe road to Ch\xc3\xa2lons, an endless ribbon, edged with trees and stretching\r\nin a straight line right across the vast plain, with stubble extending\r\nfar away on either side, and dotted here and there with lofty ricks and\r\nwooden mills, whose sails were turning. More to the north were rows\r\nof telegraph posts, indicating other roads on which the dark lines\r\nof other troops on the march could be discerned. Several regiments\r\nalso cut across the fields in dense masses. In the van, on the left,\r\na brigade of cavalry trotted along, quite dazzling in the sunlight.\r\nAnd the entire horizon, at other times so blank, so mournfully empty\r\nand limitless, became animated and populous with these streams of men\r\ngushing forth from all directions, these apparently inexhaustible\r\nmyriads that poured, as it were, out of some gigantic ant-hill.\r\n\r\nAt about nine o\'clock the 106th wheeled to the left, quitting the\r\nroad to Ch\xc3\xa2lons for another straight, endless, ribbon-like highway,\r\nconducting to Suippe. The men were marching in two open files, leaving\r\nthe centre of the road clear. The officers walked along there at their\r\nease, and Maurice noticed how strongly their thoughtful air contrasted\r\nwith the good humour and satisfied sprightliness of the men, who were\r\nas pleased as children to find themselves on the march again. The squad\r\nbeing almost at the head of the regiment, he also obtained a distant\r\nview of M. de Vineuil, and was greatly struck by the gloomy carriage\r\nof the colonel\'s tall, stiff frame, which swayed with the motion of\r\nhis horse. The band had been packed off to the rear among the sutlers\'\r\ncarts. And accompanying the division came the ambulance vans and\r\nequipage train, followed by the convoy of the entire army corps, the\r\nforage waggons, the provision vans, the baggage waggons, a stream of\r\nvehicles of every description, more than three miles in length, and\r\nlooking like an interminable tail when, at the few bends of the road,\r\nit was possible to obtain any view of it. A herd of cattle brought up\r\nthe extreme rear in the far distance--a straggling drove of big oxen\r\nstamping alone in a cloud of dust; the live, whip-driven meat, as it\r\nwere, of some warlike migratory people.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lapoulle from time to time hoisted up his knapsack by dint\r\nof shrugging his shoulders. Under pretence that he was stronger than\r\nhis comrades, he was often laden with the utensils of the squad, such\r\nas the large stew-pot and the water-can. On this occasion he had also\r\nbeen entrusted with the company\'s spade, which he had been told it\r\nwas an honour to carry. He did not complain, however; in fact, he\r\nwas laughing at a song with which Loubet, the tenor of the squad,\r\nwas enlivening the long tramp. Loubet\'s knapsack, by the way, was\r\ncelebrated for its contents, which comprised something of everything:\r\nlinen, spare shoes, needles and thread, brushes, chocolate, a metal\r\ncup, a spoon and fork, without counting the regulation provisions,\r\nbiscuits and coffee; and, although he also had his cartridges inside\r\nit, and a rolled blanket, a shelter tent and pegs strapped to it\r\noutside, the whole seemed to be wonderfully light, so accomplished was\r\nhe in the art of packing.\r\n\r\n\'A beastly part!\' muttered Chouteau, from time to time, as he cast a\r\ndisdainful glance at the mournful plains of \'la Champagne pouilleuse.\'\r\n\r\nThe vast expanses of chalky soil still stretched out on either side in\r\nendless monotony. Not a farm nor a human being was to be seen; nothing\r\nbut some flights of crows dotting the grey immensity. Afar off, on the\r\nleft, some dark green pine woods crowned the gentle undulations that\r\nlimited the horizon; whilst on the right a long line of trees indicated\r\nthe course of the river Vesle; and on that side, for the last league or\r\nso, some dense smoke had been seen rising from behind the hills, its\r\nmingled coils at last blotting out the horizon with the huge, frightful\r\ncloud of a conflagration.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s burning over there?\' the men asked on every side.\r\n\r\nThe explanation promptly sped from the van to the rear of the column.\r\nIt was the camp of Ch\xc3\xa2lons which had been blazing for two days past,\r\nset on fire, as it was said, by the Emperor\'s orders, so that the\r\nwealth of supplies gathered together there might not fall into the\r\nenemy\'s hands. The rear-guard cavalry had been instructed to fire both\r\na huge wooden building called the Yellow Magazine, which was full of\r\ntents, pickets, and matting, and another large closed shed known as\r\nthe New Magazine, in which shoes, blankets and mess utensils were\r\nstored in sufficient quantities to equip another hundred thousand men.\r\nThe ricks of forage, which had also been fired, smoked like gigantic\r\ntorches; and the army, now marching across the vast, dreary plain,\r\nbecame sadly silent at sight of the livid, whirling smoke-clouds, which\r\nspread out from behind the distant hills, and slowly covered the sky\r\nwith a veil of irreparable mourning. Under the glaring August sun no\r\nsound was to be heard save the regular tramp-tramp of the march, but\r\nthe men\'s faces were persistently turned towards the spreading smoke,\r\nwhich during another league or so seemed to be pursuing the column as\r\nthough to enshroud it in the cloudy gloom of disaster.\r\n\r\nGaiety returned at the midday halt, when the men, whilst eating a\r\nmorsel, sat and rested on their knapsacks among some stubble. The large\r\nsquare biscuits were simply intended for steeping in the _soupe_, but\r\nthe little round ones were for eating dry, and, being light and crisp,\r\nwere quite nice. Their only fault was that they made one terribly\r\nthirsty. At his comrades\' request, Pache now sang a hymn, which the\r\nsquad took up in chorus. Jean, smiling good-naturedly, let them do so,\r\nwhilst Maurice grew more and more confident at sight of the general\r\nflow of spirits, the good order, and good humour that prevailed during\r\nthis first day of the march. And the remainder of the allotted distance\r\nwas accomplished in the same vigorous fashion, though the last five\r\nmiles proved very trying. They had left the village of Prosnes on their\r\nright, and had quitted the high road to cut across some uncultivated\r\nground, a sandy _lande_ planted with copses of pine trees, between\r\nwhich wound the entire division, followed by the interminable convoy,\r\nthe men sinking in the sand up to their ankles. The solitude now\r\nseemed to have become more vast, and the only living creatures they\r\nencountered were some emaciated sheep, guarded by a big black dog.\r\n\r\nAt last, at about four o\'clock, the 106th halted at Dontrien, a village\r\non the banks of the Suippe. The little river meanders between tufts of\r\nfoliage, and the old church stands in a graveyard, which a gigantic\r\nhorse-chestnut tree fairly covers with its spreading shade. The\r\nregiment pitched its tents in a sloping meadow on the left bank of the\r\nstream. According to the officers, the four army corps would bivouac\r\nthat night along the line of the Suippe from Auberive to Heutr\xc3\xa9giville,\r\nby way of Dontrien, B\xc3\xa9thiniville and Pont-Faverger, with a front\r\nextending along a distance of nearly five leagues.\r\n\r\nGaude immediately sounded the call to rations, and Jean, the great\r\npurveyor in ordinary, ever on the alert, had to hurry off, taking\r\nLapoulle with him. They returned in half an hour\'s time with a rib of\r\nbeef and a faggot of wood. Three oxen of the drove that followed in\r\nthe rear of the army had already been slaughtered and cut up. Lapoulle\r\nthen had to go off again to fetch the bread which had been baking since\r\nnoon in the village ovens. Excepting wine and tobacco, which were never\r\nonce distributed during the whole period, there was on this occasion an\r\nabundance of everything.\r\n\r\nJean, on his return, had found Chouteau engaged in pitching the tent\r\nwith Pache\'s assistance. He looked at them for a moment like an\r\nexperienced old soldier who considered they were making a mess of the\r\njob, and finally remarked: \'Well, that\'ll do since it\'s going to be\r\nfine to-night. But if it were windy we should all be blown into the\r\nriver. I shall have to teach you how to pitch the tent properly.\'\r\n\r\nThen he thought of sending Maurice to fetch some water in the large\r\ncan, but he saw that the young fellow had seated himself on the grass,\r\nand had taken off his shoe to examine his right foot. \'Hallo! what\'s\r\nup?\' asked Jean.\r\n\r\n\'The counter has rubbed the skin off my heel. My other shoes were going\r\nto pieces, and at Rheims, stupidly enough, I chose these because they\r\nwere just my size. I ought to have taken a larger pair.\'\r\n\r\nKneeling down, Jean took hold of Maurice\'s foot and turned it round as\r\ngently as though he were dealing with a child. \'It isn\'t a laughing\r\nmatter,\' he said, shaking his head; \'you must be careful. A soldier who\r\ncan\'t depend on his feet may just as well be chucked on a rubbish heap.\r\nMy captain was always saying, out in Italy, that battles are won with\r\nmen\'s legs.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, Jean sent Pache to fetch the water, which, after all, was an\r\neasy task, since the river was only some fifty yards away. Meantime,\r\nLoubet, having lighted the wood in a hole which he had dug in the\r\nground, was able to set the large pot upon it, dropping the meat, which\r\nhe had skilfully secured together with string, into the warm water.\r\nThen came the blissful enjoyment of watching the _soupe_ boil. Fatigue\r\nduties being over, all the men of the squad, full of tender solicitude\r\nfor the cooking meat, had stretched themselves on, the grass around the\r\nfire. Like children and savages, brutified by this march towards the\r\nUnknown with its uncertain morrow, they now seemed to care for nothing\r\nbut eating and sleeping.\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, had found in his knapsack one of the newspapers he\r\nhad bought at Rheims, and Chouteau on seeing it exclaimed: \'Is there\r\nany news of the Prussians? You must read it to us.\'\r\n\r\nUnder Jean\'s steadily increasing authority the men were now getting\r\non fairly well together; and Maurice obligingly began to read all\r\nthe interesting news, whilst Pache, the squad\'s needlewoman, mended\r\na tear in his overcoat for him, and Lapoulle cleaned his gun. First\r\nof all there was an account of a great victory gained by Bazaine, who\r\nwas said to have thrown an entire Prussian army corps headlong into\r\nthe stone quarries of Jaumont; and this imaginary narrative[20] was a\r\ndramatically circumstantial one; the enemy\'s men and horses were said\r\nto have been crushed to death among the rocks, annihilated in fact, to\r\nsuch a degree, that not one whole body was left for burial! Then came\r\ncopious particulars respecting the pitiful condition of the German\r\narmies since they had entered France. Badly fed and badly equipped, the\r\nmen had fallen into a state of complete destitution, and, stricken with\r\nfearful maladies, were dying _en masse_ by the wayside. Another article\r\nrelated that the King of Prussia had the diarrh\xc5\x93a, and that Bismarck\r\nhad broken his leg in jumping out of the window of an inn where some\r\nZouaves had almost caught him. That was capital! Lapoulle laughed from\r\near to ear, whilst Chouteau and the others, who did not for one moment\r\nentertain the shadow of a doubt, felt wondrous bold at the idea that\r\nthey would soon be picking up Prussians like sparrows in a field after\r\na hailstorm. But it was especially Bismarck\'s fall that amused them.\r\nThe Zouaves and the Turcos were plucky devils, and no mistake. All\r\nsorts of legends were current concerning these fellows, who not merely\r\nmade Germany tremble but angered her as well. It was disgraceful, so\r\nthe German papers declared, that a civilised nation should employ\r\nsuch savages in her defence. And although these so-called savages had\r\nalready been decimated at Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, it seemed to the French as if\r\nthey were still intact and invincible.\r\n\r\nSix o\'clock was striking from the little steeple of Dontrien when\r\nLoubet called: \'The _soupe_ is ready!\' The squad seated itself devoutly\r\nround the pot. At the last moment Loubet had been able to procure some\r\nvegetables from a peasant living close by, so that the broth had a fine\r\nscent of carrots and leeks, and was as soft to the palate as velvet.\r\nThen Jean, the distributor, had to divide the meat into strictly equal\r\nportions, for the men\'s eyes were aglow, and there would certainly have\r\nbeen much growling had any one portion appeared to be in the smallest\r\ndegree larger than the others. Everything was devoured, the men gorging\r\nthemselves to their very eyes.\r\n\r\nEven Maurice felt replete and happy, no longer thinking of his foot,\r\nthe smarting of which was passing away. He now accepted this brutish\r\ncomradeship, principles of equality being forced upon him, by the\r\nphysical needs of their common life. That night, too, he enjoyed the\r\nsame sound slumber as his five companions, the whole lot of them being\r\nheaped together in the tent, well pleased at feeling themselves warm\r\nwhilst the dew was falling so abundantly outside. It should be added\r\nthat Lapoulle, egged on by Loubet, had removed some large armfuls of\r\nstraw from a neighbouring rick, and on this the six men snored as\r\ncomfortably as though they had been provided with feather beds. And\r\nin the clear night, along the pleasant banks of the Suippe, flowing\r\nslowly between the willows, the camp fires of those hundred thousand\r\nmen illumined the five leagues of plain from Auberive to Heutr\xc3\xa9giville,\r\nlike trailing stars.\r\n\r\nCoffee was made at sunrise, the grains being pounded in a platter\r\nwith the butt of a gun, and thrown into boiling water, to which a\r\ndrop of cold water was added in order to precipitate the grounds. The\r\nsun rose that morning with regal magnificence, amid great clouds of\r\ngold and purple. Maurice, however, no longer looked at the horizon\r\nor the sky, and only Jean, like the thoughtful peasant he was, gazed\r\nwith an expression of uneasiness at this ruddy dawn which betokened\r\nrain. Indeed, before they started, when the bread baked the day before\r\nhad been given out, and Loubet and Pache had fastened the three long\r\nloaves which the squad received to their knapsacks, he blamed them for\r\nhaving done so. The tents were already folded, however, and everything\r\nhad been strapped to the knapsacks, so that he was not listened to.\r\nSix o\'clock was striking from all the village steeples when the army\r\nset out again, gallantly resuming its forward march in the early\r\nhopefulness of this new day.\r\n\r\nTo reach the road from Rheims to Vouziers the 106th almost immediately\r\nbegan cutting along by-ways and ascending slopes of stubble. This\r\nlasted during more than an hour. Lower down, towards the north,\r\nB\xc3\xa9thiniville, where the Emperor was said to have slept, could be seen\r\nembowered in trees. Then, on reaching the Vouziers road, they again\r\nfound themselves among plains similar to those of the day before. The\r\nlast sorry fields of \'la Champagne pouilleuse\' were here spread out in\r\nall their dispiriting monotony. A meagre stream, the Arne, now flowed\r\non the left, whilst the vast expanse of barren land stretched away on\r\nthe right, so flat that the distance of the horizon was considerably\r\nincreased. The soldiers passed through some villages, St. Cl\xc3\xa9ment,\r\nwith its only street winding along the road, and St. Pierre, a large\r\nplace inhabited by well-to-do folks, who had barricaded their doors and\r\nwindows. The men halted at about ten o\'clock near another village, St.\r\nEtienne, where, to their great delight, they were able to procure some\r\ntobacco. The Seventh Corps had now become divided into several columns,\r\nand the 106th marched on with merely a battalion of foot Chasseurs and\r\nthe reserve artillery behind it. Vainly did Maurice turn round at the\r\nbends of the road, in the hope of seeing the immense convoy which had\r\nso greatly interested him the day before; the herds were no longer\r\nthere, and he could only espy the cannon which--as they rolled over\r\nthis low level plain--looked larger than they really were, seeming not\r\nunlike dark grasshoppers with unusually long legs.\r\n\r\nAfter passing St. Etienne, however, the road became frightful; it\r\nascended by gentle winding slopes through large barren fields dotted\r\nwith little woods of pine trees, ever the same, and which, with\r\ntheir foliage of a blackish green, looked infinitely mournful amid\r\nthe expanse of white soil. The troops had not passed through such\r\na desolate scene before. Badly metalled, moreover, and softened by\r\nthe last rains, the road was a perfect bed of mud, of liquefied grey\r\nargil, to which the feet adhered as to pitch. The fatigue of marching\r\nconsequently became extreme, and the exhausted men no longer made way.\r\nAs a crowning worry, violent showers suddenly began to fall. But little\r\nmore was needed, and the artillery, which had stuck in the mire, would\r\nhave remained there.\r\n\r\nOut of breath, and infuriated with his crushing burden, Chouteau, who\r\nwas carrying some rice distributed to the squad, flung it away at a\r\nmoment when he thought himself unobserved. But Loubet had seen him, and\r\nremarked: \'That\'s a dirty trick to play, for it means short commons for\r\neveryone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Humbug!\' replied Chouteau; \'there\'s plenty of everything, so we can\r\nget some more when we halt.\'\r\n\r\nInfluenced by this specious reasoning, Loubet, who was carrying the\r\nbacon, rid himself of his burden in his turn.\r\n\r\nMeantime, as his heel had again become inflamed, Maurice experienced\r\nincreasing suffering, and he dragged his leg along so painfully that\r\nJean, becoming more and more solicitous concerning him, ventured to\r\nask: \'Aren\'t you all right? Has it begun again?\' Then, when a brief\r\nhalt was ordered, just to give the men breathing time, he proffered\r\nsome good advice: \'Take your shoes off and walk barefooted. The fresh\r\nmud will take the smarting away.\'\r\n\r\nIndeed, in this fashion Maurice was able to keep up with the others\r\nwithout much difficulty; and he felt profoundly grateful to Jean. It\r\nwas real luck that the squad should have such a corporal as that, a man\r\nwho had served before, and who was up to all the tricks of the trade:\r\nan uncultured peasant, no doubt, but all the same a thorough good\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nIt was late when, after crossing the road from Ch\xc3\xa2lons to Vouziers,\r\nand diving by a rapid descent into the ravine of Semide, they reached\r\nContreuve, where they were to bivouac. The country was now changing;\r\nthey were already in the Ardennes, and from the far-stretching, barren\r\nhills above the village, which were selected as the camping ground of\r\nthe Seventh Corps, one could discern the valley of the Aisne afar off,\r\nobscured by the pale shower-laden clouds.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock, as Gaude had not yet sounded the call to rations, Jean,\r\nby way of occupying his time, and anxious, too, on account of the\r\nstrong wind which was rising, determined to pitch the tent himself.\r\nHe showed his men that they ought to select a somewhat sloping site,\r\nfix the pegs slantwise, and dig a little trench round the canvas\r\nfor the rain-water to run into. On account of his foot Maurice was\r\nexempted from all fatigue duties, and he simply looked on, surprised\r\nat the intelligent skill which that sturdy, heavy-looking fellow Jean\r\ndisplayed. For his own part, he was physically overcome by fatigue, but\r\nhis spirits were buoyed up by the hope that was now returning to every\r\nheart. They had done a terrible lot of marching since leaving Rheims,\r\nthirty-eight miles in two days. If they maintained the same speed,\r\ngoing straight before them, they must certainly succeed in overthrowing\r\nthe second German army and joining hands with Bazaine, before the\r\nthird one, under the Crown Prince of Prussia, who was said to be at\r\nVitry-le-Fran\xc3\xa7ois, was able to reach Verdun.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo! Are they going to let us die of hunger?\' asked Chouteau, when\r\nseven o\'clock came, and no rations had yet been distributed.\r\n\r\nJean had prudently told Loubet to light a fire and set the large pot,\r\nfull of water, on it; and as they had no wood he discreetly shut his\r\neyes whilst Loubet, by way of procuring some, tore down several palings\r\ninclosing a neighbouring garden. When Jean began to talk, however, of\r\ncooking some rice and bacon, it became necessary to confess that the\r\nrice and bacon had remained behind, on the muddy road near St. Etienne.\r\nChouteau lied with effrontery, swearing that the packet of rice must\r\nhave slipped off his knapsack without his noticing it.\r\n\r\n\'You pigs!\' exclaimed Jean, infuriated, \'to throw food away when there\r\nare so many poor devils with their stomachs empty!\'\r\n\r\nThen, too, with regard to the bread, the men had not listened to him\r\nat starting; and the three loaves fastened to the knapsacks had been\r\nthoroughly soaked by the showers, softened to such a degree that they\r\nwere now like so much pap and quite uneatable. \'A nice pickle we\'re\r\nin!\' repeated Jean; \'we had everything we wanted, and now we haven\'t\r\neven a crust! What hogs you fellows are!\'\r\n\r\nJust then a bugle call summoned the sergeants to orders, and the\r\nmelancholy-looking Sapin came in to inform the men of his section that,\r\nas no distribution of rations could take place, they must content\r\nthemselves with their field supplies. The convoy, it was said, had\r\nremained behind on the road on account of the bad weather, and the\r\ndrove of cattle had gone astray owing to conflicting orders. It was\r\nlearnt, later on, that as the Fifth and Twelfth Corps had marched\r\nthat day in the direction of Rethel, where head quarters were to\r\nbe established, all the provisions in the villages, as well as the\r\ninhabitants, who were feverishly anxious to see the Emperor, had flowed\r\ntowards that town; so that the country lying before the Seventh Corps\r\nwas virtually drained of everything. There was no more meat, no more\r\nbread, and there were even no more people. To make the destitution\r\ncomplete, the commissariat supplies had been sent to Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux\r\nthrough a misunderstanding. Great throughout the campaign was the\r\ndespair of the wretched commissaries, against whom the soldiers were\r\nfor ever crying out, though, often enough, their only fault was that\r\nthey punctually reached appointed places where the troops never arrived.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you dirty pigs!\' repeated Jean, quite beside himself, \'it serves\r\nyou right! You are not deserving of the trouble I\'m going to take to\r\ntry and find something for you; because, after all, it\'s my duty not\r\nto let you kick the bucket on the road.\' Thereupon he started on a\r\njourney of discovery, like every good corporal should do under the\r\ncircumstances, taking with him Pache, whom he liked on account of his\r\ngentleness, though he considered him far too fond of priests.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Loubet had noticed a little farmhouse standing two or three\r\nhundred yards away, one of the last houses of Contreuve, where, it\r\nseemed to him, a good deal of business was being done. Calling Chouteau\r\nand Lapoulle, he said to them: \'Let us have a try. I fancy we can get\r\nsome grub over there.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice was left to mount guard over the pot of boiling water, with\r\norders to keep the fire alight. He had seated himself on his blanket,\r\nwith his shoe off so that the sore on his heel might dry. He was\r\ninterested at the sight which the camp presented with all the squads\r\nat sixes and sevens since they had learnt that there would be no\r\ndistribution of provisions. He became conscious that some of the troops\r\nwere always short of everything, whilst others lived in abundance; in\r\nfact, it all depended on the foresight and skill of the corporals and\r\nthe men. Amid the stir and bustle around him, he noticed, on glancing\r\nbetween the tents and the piles of arms, that some fellows had not even\r\nbeen able to light a fire, and that others, resigning themselves to\r\ncircumstances, had already retired for the night; whilst others again,\r\non the contrary, were eating, he could not tell what, but doubtless\r\nsomething nice, with keen appetite and relish. He was also struck by\r\nthe beautiful order that prevailed among the reserve artillery encamped\r\non a hill above him. As the sun set, it shone forth between two clouds,\r\ncasting a glow over the guns, which the artillerymen had already\r\ncarefully cleansed of all the mud that they had been splashed with\r\nduring the march.\r\n\r\nMeantime the commander of the brigade, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles,\r\nhad installed himself comfortably at the little farmhouse whither\r\nLoubet and his comrades had betaken themselves. The general had found\r\na fairly good bed there, and was seated before an omelet and a roast\r\nfowl, which had put him in an excellent humour; and Colonel de Vineuil\r\nhaving come to speak to him respecting some matter of detail, he had\r\ninvited him to stay and dine with him. So they both sat there eating,\r\nwaited upon by a big, fair fellow, who had only been three days in the\r\nfarmer\'s employ, and who declared himself to be an Alsatian refugee,\r\ncarried away in the rout of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler. The general talked openly\r\nin presence of this man, commented on the march of the troops, and\r\nthen, forgetting that the fellow did not belong to the Ardennes, began\r\nquestioning him respecting the roads and the distances. Painfully\r\naffected by the thorough ignorance which the general\'s questions\r\nrevealed, the colonel, who, for his part, had formerly resided at\r\nM\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, supplied some precise particulars, whereupon the general\r\nvented his feelings in the exclamation: \'How idiotic it all is! How can\r\none fight in a country one knows nothing whatever about?\'\r\n\r\nThe colonel made a vague, despairing gesture. He knew very well that\r\nmaps of Germany had been distributed to all the officers as soon as\r\never war was declared, whereas not one of them had a map of France in\r\nhis possession. All that the colonel had seen and heard during the past\r\nmonth, had contributed to overwhelm him. Somewhat weak, and of limited\r\ncapacity, liked rather than feared by his men, he no longer felt able\r\nto exercise authority; of all his powers, courage alone remained to him.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t one even dine quietly?\' suddenly shouted the general. \'What are\r\nthey brawling about? Here, you, the Alsatian, go and see what it all\r\nmeans.\'\r\n\r\nThe farmer, however, made his appearance, exasperated, gesticulating\r\nand sobbing. He was being plundered--some Chasseurs and Zouaves were\r\npillaging his house. Being the only person in the village who had any\r\neggs, potatoes, and rabbits to dispose of, he had been foolish enough\r\nto think of doing a bit of trade. Without cheating the men overmuch,\r\nhe pocketed their money and handed over his goods; so much so that his\r\ncustomers, becoming more and more numerous, at last quite bewildered\r\nand overwhelmed him, and ended by pushing him aside and taking whatever\r\nthey could lay their hands on without paying him another copper. If\r\nso many peasants, during the war, hid all they possessed and refused\r\nthe soldiers at times even a drink of water, it was through fear of\r\nthe slow, irresistible onslaught of some such human tide, which, once\r\nadmitted, might sweep them out of doors and carry away their homes.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my good fellow, just let me be!\' replied the general to the\r\ncomplaining farmer, with an air of displeasure. \'We should have\r\nto shoot a dozen of those rascals every day, and we can\'t do it.\'\r\nThereupon he ordered the door to be shut, so that he might not be\r\nobliged to act rigorously, whilst the colonel explained that no rations\r\nhaving been distributed, the men were hungry.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Loubet had found a field of potatoes near the house, and had\r\nrushed at it in company with Lapoulle, both of them tearing up the\r\nplants, grubbing up the potatoes with their hands, and filling their\r\npockets with them. But on hearing Chouteau, who was looking over a\r\nlow wall, whistle to them to approach, they ran up, and at the sight\r\nthey beheld vented their feelings in exclamations. A flock of a dozen\r\nmagnificent geese was promenading majestically in a narrow courtyard.\r\nThe men at once held council, and Lapoulle was prevailed upon to jump\r\nover the wall. There was a terrible fight; the goose he seized almost\r\nbit off his nose with its terrible shear-like bill, whereupon he caught\r\nit by the neck and tried to strangle it, whilst it dug its powerful\r\nwebbed feet into his arms and stomach. At last he had to crush its head\r\nwith a blow of his sturdy fist, but even then it continued struggling\r\nand he made all haste to decamp, followed by the other birds of the\r\nflock, who were tearing his legs.\r\n\r\nAs the three men returned, with the goose and the potatoes stowed away\r\nin a sack, they met Jean and Pache coming back, well pleased, on their\r\nside, with the result of their expedition, for they were laden with\r\nfour new loaves and a cheese, purchased of a worthy old peasant woman.\r\n\'The water\'s boiling, so we\'ll make some coffee,\' said the corporal.\r\n\'We have some bread and some cheese--it\'ll be a regular feast.\'\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly perceived the goose stretched out at his feet, and\r\ncould not help laughing. He felt the bird in a knowing way, and was\r\nquite overcome with admiration. \'The devil!\' said he, \'she\'s plump and\r\nno mistake. She must weigh about twenty pounds.\'\r\n\r\n\'We happened to meet her,\' explained Loubet with that waggish air of\r\nhis, \'and she desired to make our acquaintance.\'\r\n\r\nJean waved his hand, as much as to say that he did not wish to know any\r\nmore. Men must live, and, besides, why shouldn\'t these poor devils, who\r\ncould hardly remember what poultry tasted like, have a bit of a treat\r\nonce in a way? Loubet was already lighting a bright fire, whilst Pache\r\nand Lapoulle tore the feathers off the bird, and Chouteau ran up to\r\nthe artillery camp to ask for a piece of string. When he returned he\r\nhung the goose from a couple of bayonets in front of the bright fire,\r\nand Maurice was appointed to give it a dig now and then, so as to make\r\nit turn. The fat fell into the squad\'s platter placed underneath, and\r\nthe entire regiment, attracted by the savoury smell, formed a circle\r\naround. And what a feast there was! Roast goose, boiled potatoes,\r\nbread and cheese! When Jean had cut up the bird, the squad began\r\ngorging. There was no question of portions, they one and all tucked\r\naway till they could eat no more; and a piece was even presented to the\r\nartillerymen who had provided the string.\r\n\r\nIt happened that evening that the officers of the regiment had to fast.\r\nOwing to wrong directions, the sutler\'s van had gone astray; it had\r\nno doubt followed the great convoy. Although the men suffered when no\r\nrations were given out, they generally ended by securing something\r\nto eat--they helped one another, the soldiers of each squad shared\r\nwhatever they happened to have; but the officer, isolated, left to his\r\nown resources, had no alternative but to starve when the canteen did\r\nnot turn up. Accordingly, Chouteau, who had heard Captain Beaudoin\r\ncomplaining of the disappearance of the provision van, began to sneer\r\nand jeer when--whilst tackling some of the goose\'s carcass--he saw\r\nthe captain pass by with a proud, stiff air. \'Look at him,\' he said,\r\ntipping the others a wink. \'See how he\'s sniffing. He\'d give five\r\nfrancs for the parson\'s nose.\'\r\n\r\nThey all began to laugh at the captain\'s hunger, for he was not popular\r\namong his men; they considered him too young and too severe, too\r\nprone to reprimand them unnecessarily. It seemed for a moment as if\r\nhe intended to reprove the squad for the scandal which that goose of\r\ntheirs was causing; but the fear no doubt of showing how hungry he was,\r\ninduced him to walk off with his head erect as if he had seen nothing.\r\nAs for Lieutenant Rochas, who was also feeling terribly hungry, he\r\nmeandered round the fortunate squad, laughing in a good-natured way. He\r\nwas greatly liked by his men, first because he execrated that puppy,\r\nthe captain, who owed his rank as an officer to his attendance at the\r\nmilitary school of St. Cyr, and, secondly, because in time past he\r\nhad carried the knapsack like themselves. And yet he was not always a\r\npleasant customer to deal with, being at times so coarse and insulting\r\nin his language that he positively deserved cuffing. After exchanging\r\nglances with his comrades, by way of consulting them, Jean rose up and\r\ninduced Rochas to follow him behind the tent. \'Beg pardon, sir,\' he\r\nsaid, \'but without offending you, may we offer you some of this?\' And\r\nthereupon he passed him a large piece of bread with a platter on which\r\nwas one of the goose\'s legs, atop of half a dozen large potatoes.\r\n\r\nAgain that night the squad needed no rocking to sleep. The six men\r\ndigested that bird with their fists clenched. They owed thanks to the\r\ncorporal for the firm manner in which he had pitched their tent, for\r\nthey were not even aware of a violent squall which blew over the camp\r\nat about two o\'clock in the morning, accompanied by driving rain. Some\r\ntents were carried away, and the men, starting from their sleep, were\r\nsoaked through, and had to run hither and thither in the darkness; but\r\nthe squad\'s tent resisted the onslaught of the wind, and the men were\r\ncomfortably under cover with not a drop of water to inconvenience them,\r\nthanks to the little trenches into which the rain dribbled.\r\n\r\nMaurice awoke at daybreak, and, as the march was not to be resumed\r\nbefore eight o\'clock, he decided to climb the hill where the reserve\r\nartillery was encamped, so as to shake hands with his cousin Honor\xc3\xa9.\r\nAfter that good night\'s rest his foot caused him less pain. He was\r\nstruck with admiring astonishment on seeing how well the park was\r\ndressed, the six guns of each battery correctly aligned and followed by\r\nthe caissons, ammunition, and forage vans, and field smithies. Farther\r\noff, the picketed horses were neighing with their heads turned towards\r\nthe rising sun. And Maurice immediately found Honor\xc3\xa9\'s tent, thanks to\r\nthe orderly system that allots one row of tents to the men of each gun;\r\nso that the number of guns is clearly indicated by the aspect of an\r\nartillery encampment.\r\n\r\nThe artillerymen were already up, and were taking their coffee, when\r\nMaurice arrived and found that a quarrel had broken out between\r\nAdolphe, the front driver, and his chum Louis, the gunner. They had\r\ngot on very well together, except with regard to messing, during the\r\nthree years that they had chummed together--according to the system\r\nby which, in the French artillery, a driver and a gunner are coupled.\r\nLouis, who was very intelligent, and the better educated of the two,\r\ncheerfully accepted the state of dependence in which every mounted man\r\nkeeps the footman his comrade, and he pitched the tent, performed the\r\nfatigue duties, and looked after the _soupe_, whilst Adolphe, with an\r\nair of superiority, simply attended to his two horses. At the same\r\ntime, however, Louis, who was dark and thin and afflicted with an\r\nexcessive appetite, revolted when his comrade, a tall fellow with bushy\r\nfair moustaches, presumed to help himself like a master. That morning,\r\nfor instance, the quarrel had arisen through Louis accusing Adolphe of\r\ndrinking all the coffee which he, Louis, had made. It became necessary\r\nto reconcile them.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, immediately after the reveille, Honor\xc3\xa9 went to have a\r\nlook at his gun, and saw that the night dew was carefully wiped from\r\nit in his presence, just as though it were a question of rubbing down\r\nsome favourite horse, for fear lest it should catch cold. And he was\r\nstanding there, like a father, watching the gun shine in the clear\r\natmosphere of the dawn, when he recognised Maurice: \'Hallo!\' he said;\r\n\'I knew that the 106th was near by. I received a letter from Remilly,\r\nyesterday, and I meant to have gone down to you. Let\'s go and drink a\r\ncup of white wine.\'\r\n\r\nSo that they might be alone together, he took him towards the little\r\nfarmhouse plundered the day before, whose peasant owner, altogether\r\nincorrigible and still eager for gain, had now tapped a cask of\r\nwhite wine in view of playing the taverner. He served the liquor\r\non a plank outside his door, at a charge of four _sous_ the glass,\r\nbeing assisted in the work by the man whom he had engaged three days\r\npreviously, the colossal, fair-haired Alsatian. Honor\xc3\xa9 and Maurice were\r\nalready chinking glasses, when the eyes of the former fell upon the\r\nso-called refugee. For an instant he scanned his face with an air of\r\nstupefaction. Then he swore a terrible oath: \'By the thunder of God!\r\nGoliath!\'\r\n\r\nHe sprang forward, wishing to seize the scamp by the throat, but the\r\nfarmer, imagining that his house was about to be pillaged afresh,\r\ndarted back and barricaded the door. There was a moment\'s confusion,\r\nand all the soldiers present rushed forward, whilst the infuriated\r\nquartermaster almost choked himself with shouting: \'Open! open! you\r\ncursed fool! The fellow\'s a spy; I tell you, he\'s a spy!\'\r\n\r\nMaurice no longer doubted it. He had fully recognised the man who\r\nhad been set at liberty at the camp of Mulhausen for lack of proof\r\nagainst him, and this man was Goliath, whom old Fouchard of Remilly\r\nhad formerly employed. When the farmer, however, was at last prevailed\r\nupon to open his door, they searched the farm in vain, the so-called\r\nAlsatian had disappeared. That good-natured looking, fair-haired\r\ncolossus, whom General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had questioned to no\r\npurpose whilst dining the day before, and in whose presence he had\r\ncarelessly confessed his own ignorance and bewilderment, had gone off!\r\nThe rascal had no doubt jumped out by a back window, which was found\r\nopen, but it was in vain that they scoured the surrounding fields; huge\r\nthough he was, the fellow had vanished like smoke.\r\n\r\nMaurice was obliged to lead Honor\xc3\xa9 away, for in his despair the\r\nquartermaster was on the point of telling his comrades more than was\r\nadvisable of certain sad family affairs which they had no need to know.\r\n\'Thunder! I should have so liked to strangle him!\' said Honor\xc3\xa9; \'I was\r\nthe more enraged against him on account of the letter I\'ve received.\'\r\nThen, as they had both seated themselves against a rick at a few steps\r\nfrom the farmhouse, he handed the letter in question to Maurice.\r\n\r\nThat love affair between Honor\xc3\xa9 Fouchard and Silvine Morange was but\r\nthe old, old story. She, a dark-complexioned girl, with beautiful\r\nsubmissive eyes, had, when very young, lost her mother, a workwoman\r\nemployed at a factory at Raucourt. She was a natural child, and Dr.\r\nDalichamp, her godfather, a worthy man who was always ready to adopt\r\nthe offspring of the poor creatures he attended, had found her a\r\nsituation as servant girl with Fouchard, the father. The old peasant,\r\nwho in his eagerness for gain had turned butcher, hawking his meat\r\nthrough a score of surrounding villages, was certainly frightfully\r\navaricious, and a pitiless hard master as well; but the doctor reasoned\r\nthat he would watch over the girl, and that she, providing she worked\r\nwell, would at all events not lack her daily bread. In any case, she\r\nwould escape the loose life of the factory. Then it naturally came\r\nto pass that young Fouchard and the little servant girl fell in love\r\nwith one another. Honor\xc3\xa9 was sixteen when she was twelve, and when\r\nshe was sixteen he was twenty. Then, when he drew his number at the\r\nconscription, he was delighted to find it a good one, and determined to\r\nmarry her. There had never been any impropriety between them; Honor\xc3\xa9\r\nwas, indeed, of a calm, thoughtful disposition, and at the most they\r\nhad kissed each other in the barn. However, when Honor\xc3\xa9 broached the\r\nsubject of the marriage to his father, the latter was exasperated, and\r\nstubbornly declared that it should not take place whilst he was living.\r\nStill, he kept the girl in his service, thinking, perhaps, that the\r\nyoung fellow\'s fancy would pass off; hoping, too, possibly, for things\r\nthat did not happen. Two years went by, and Honor\xc3\xa9 and Silvine still\r\nloved each other, and longed to marry; but at last there was a terrible\r\nscene between the father and the son, and the latter, unable to remain\r\nany longer in the house, enlisted, and was sent to Algeria, whilst\r\nthe old man obstinately kept his servant girl, with whom he was well\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThen came to pass that frightful thing that wrecked poor Silvine\'s\r\nlife. She had sworn to wait for Honor\xc3\xa9, but a fortnight after his\r\ndeparture she became the prey of Goliath Steinberg--the Prussian, as he\r\nwas called--a tall, genial-looking chap, with short, fair hair, and a\r\npink, smiling face, who had been in Fouchard\'s employ as farm-hand for\r\nsome months already, and had become Honor\xc3\xa9\'s comrade and confidant. Had\r\nold Fouchard stealthily brought this to pass? Had there been seduction\r\nor violence? Silvine herself no longer knew; she was overwhelmed.\r\nBecoming _enceinte_, however, she accepted the necessity of marrying\r\nGoliath, and he, with a smiling face, agreed to it; but he repeatedly\r\npostponed the date of the ceremony, until at last, on the very eve of\r\nSilvine\'s accouchement, he suddenly disappeared. It was reported later\r\non that he had found a situation at another farm in the direction of\r\nBeaumont. Since then three years had elapsed, and nobody at Remilly\r\nimagined that this worthy fellow, Goliath, so attentive to the girls,\r\nwas simply one of the spies with whom Germany had peopled the Eastern\r\nprovinces of France. When Honor\xc3\xa9 in Algeria heard of what had happened,\r\nit was as if the fierce tropical sun had stretched him prostrate by\r\ndealing him a burning blow on the nape of the neck. He remained for\r\nthree months in the hospital, but would never apply for a furlough to\r\ngo home, through fear lest he should again meet Silvine and see her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe artilleryman\'s hands trembled whilst Maurice was reading the\r\nletter. It was a letter from Silvine, the first and only one she had\r\never written to him. What feeling had prompted her to write it--she,\r\nso submissive and silent, but whose beautiful black eyes acquired\r\nat times an expression of wondrous resolution, despite her perpetual\r\nservitude? She simply said that she knew he had gone to the war, and\r\nthat as she might never see him again she felt too much sorrow at the\r\nthought that he might die fancying she no longer loved him; but she did\r\nlove him, and had never loved anyone but him; and she repeated this,\r\nover and over again, throughout four long pages, constantly making use\r\nof the same words, but not seeking to excuse herself or even to explain\r\nwhat had happened. And not a word did she say of the child; her letter\r\nwas but a farewell, full of infinite tenderness.\r\n\r\nMaurice, in whom his cousin had formerly confided, felt deeply touched\r\non reading what Silvine had written. On raising his eyes, he saw that\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9 was in tears, and he embraced him like a brother. \'My poor\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster was already gulping down his emotion, however, and he\r\ncarefully replaced the letter on his chest, and then again buttoned up\r\nhis uniform. \'Yes,\' he said, \'it upsets one. Ah! if I could only have\r\nstrangled that bandit! Well, we shall see.\'\r\n\r\nThe bugles were now sounding the signal for raising the camp, and they\r\nboth had to run to their tents. The preparations for departure dragged\r\non, however, and the men had to wait till nearly nine o\'clock before\r\nreceiving orders to start. Hesitation seemed to have again seized\r\nhold of the commanders: there was no more of that fine resolution\r\nshown during the first two days, when the Seventh Corps had covered\r\neight-and-thirty miles in a couple of marches. Singular and disquieting\r\ninformation had been circulating since daybreak; the other three\r\narmy corps, it appeared, had been marching northward, the First to\r\nJuniville, and the Fifth and the Twelfth to Rethel, an illogical march\r\nwhich could only be explained by a need of obtaining supplies. Were\r\nthey not to continue their advance upon Verdun? Why was a day lost?\r\nThe worst was that the Prussians could not be far off, now, for the\r\nofficers had warned their men not to straggle, as any laggards might be\r\ncarried off by the reconnoitring parties of the enemy\'s cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 25th of August, and subsequently, on recollecting\r\nGoliath\'s disappearance, Maurice felt convinced that this scamp was one\r\nof the men who supplied the enemy\'s staff with the precise information\r\nrespecting the march of the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons, which determined the\r\nsudden change of front carried out by the third German army. The Crown\r\nPrince left Revigny on the very next day, and the necessary evolutions\r\nat once began for that flank attack, that gigantic scheme of encircling\r\nthe French troops by dint of forced marches, effected in admirable\r\norder through Champagne and the Ardennes. Whilst the French were\r\nhesitating and oscillating on the spot where they found themselves, as\r\nthough suddenly struck with paralysis, the Germans, surrounded by an\r\nimmense circle of light cavalry beating the country, marched as many\r\nas twenty-five miles a day, driving the flock of men whom they were\r\nhunting towards the forests on the frontier.[21]\r\n\r\nHowever, the Seventh Corps set out at last, on that morning of the\r\n25th of August, and, wheeling to the left, simply covered the two\r\nshort leagues separating Contreuve from Vouziers; whilst the Fifth and\r\nTwelfth Corps remained at Rethel, and the First halted at Attigny.\r\nBetween Contreuve and the valley of the Aisne there were some more\r\nplains as barren as ever. As the men approached Vouziers, the road\r\nwound between stretches of grey soil and desolate hillocks, without\r\na house or even a tree in sight, nothing but mournful desert-like\r\nscenery; and the march, short as it was, was accomplished in a weary,\r\ndispirited fashion, which lengthened it terribly. At noon the 106th\r\nhalted on the left bank of the Aisne, the men forming their bivouacs\r\non high barren ground, the last spurs of which overlooked the valley.\r\nThence they kept watch over the Monthois road, which skirts the river,\r\nand by which they expected to see the enemy appear.\r\n\r\nMaurice was altogether stupefied when he suddenly noticed General\r\nMargueritte\'s division--all the reserve cavalry, charged to support the\r\nSeventh Corps and to reconnoitre on the army\'s left flank--approaching\r\nby way of this Monthois road. It was rumoured that it was proceeding\r\nup-country towards Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux. But what could be the object in\r\nthus weakening the Seventh Corps, the only wing of the army that was\r\nthreatened? Why were these two thousand horsemen, who should have been\r\nsent to reconnoitre the country for leagues around, suddenly ordered\r\nto the very centre of the French forces, where they could be of no use\r\nwhatever? The worst was that they came up in the midst of the man\xc5\x93uvres\r\nwhich the Seventh Corps was executing, and almost cut its columns in\r\ntwain--men, guns, and horses being mingled in inextricable confusion.\r\nSome of the Chasseurs d\'Afrique had to wait a couple of hours just\r\noutside Vouziers.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were there, Maurice chanced to recognise Prosper, who had\r\nhalted his horse beside a pool, and they were able to have a short chat\r\ntogether. The Chasseur seemed dazed and stupefied; he had understood\r\nnothing and seen nothing since leaving Rheims--yes, though, he had, he\r\nhad seen another couple of Uhlans, beggars who appeared and disappeared\r\nwithout anyone knowing where they came from or whither they went.\r\nAll manner of stories were already being told of them; four Uhlans\r\ngalloped into a town with revolvers in their hands, rode through it,\r\nand conquered it, twelve miles ahead of their army corps. They were\r\neverywhere, preceding the columns like buzzing bees, forming, so to\r\nsay, shifting curtains, behind which the infantry dissembled its\r\nmovements and marched along in perfect security as in time of peace.\r\nAnd Maurice felt a pang at his heart as he glanced at the road covered\r\nwith Chasseurs and Hussars, whose services were so indifferently\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\n\'Well, till we meet again,\' said he, shaking hands with Prosper;\r\n\'perhaps they need you up there all the same.\'\r\n\r\nBut the Chasseur seemed disgusted with the sorry work he was ordered\r\nto do, and as he stroked Zephyr with a mournful air, he answered:\r\n\'Oh, humbug! they kill the horses and do nothing with the men. It\'s\r\ndisgusting.\'\r\n\r\nThat evening, when Maurice took off his shoe to look at his heel, which\r\nwas throbbing quite feverishly, he tore away a piece of skin. Some\r\nblood spurted from the wound, and he gave a cry of pain. Jean, who\r\nwas there, was affected with anxious compassion: \'I say, it\'s getting\r\nserious,\' he exclaimed; \'you\'ll be laid up. It must be attended to. Let\r\nme see to it.\'\r\n\r\nKneeling down, he then washed the sore, and dressed it with a strip of\r\nclean linen, which he took out of his knapsack. There was something\r\nmotherly in his gestures; he displayed all the gentleness of an\r\nexperienced man whose big fingers can acquire a delicate touch whenever\r\noccasion requires. An invincible feeling of affection stole over\r\nMaurice, and his eyes became dim. It was as if he had found a brother\r\nin this peasant, whom he had formerly execrated, and whom he had still\r\ndespised only the day before. \'You\'re a good fellow,\' he said. \'Thanks,\r\nold man.\'\r\n\r\nThen Jean, looking very happy, responded with his quiet smile: \'Now,\r\nyoungster, I\'ve still some tobacco left. Will you have a cigarette?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN BATTLE ARRAY--THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice rose on the morrow, August 26, he was aching all over,\r\nand his shoulders were quite sore after that night spent in the tent.\r\nHe was not yet accustomed to sleeping on the hard ground, and as\r\norders had been issued the previous evening forbidding the men to\r\ntake off their shoes, and the sergeants had gone round feeling in the\r\ndarkness to make sure that everyone was properly shod and gaitered,\r\nhis foot was scarcely any better, being still painful and feverishly\r\nhot. Besides, he must have caught cold in his legs when he had allowed\r\nthem to project beyond the canvas in view of stretching himself. Jean\r\nimmediately said to him: \'If we are marching to-day you would do well\r\nto see the major,[22] and get him to put you into one of the vans.\'\r\n\r\nNothing certain was known, however; the most contradictory rumours\r\nwere current. At one moment it was thought they were about to resume\r\ntheir march, for the camp was raised and the army corps passed through\r\nVouziers, leaving only a brigade of the Second Division on the left\r\nbank of the Aisne, to continue watching the road from Monthois. Then,\r\non reaching the right bank, on the other side of the town, the men\r\nwere suddenly halted, and arms were piled in the fields and meadows\r\nextending right and left of the road to Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9. At this moment the\r\ndeparture of the 4th Hussars, who set out along this Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9 road at\r\na fast trot, gave rise to all sorts of conjectures.\r\n\r\n\'If the regiment remains here, I shall stay with you,\' declared\r\nMaurice, who did not at all care for that idea of the major and the\r\nambulance van.\r\n\r\nThey soon learned, indeed, that they were to encamp there until General\r\nDouay had obtained precise information respecting the enemy\'s march.\r\nSince the day before--since he had seen Margueritte\'s division proceed\r\nup-country towards Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux--the general\'s anxiety had been\r\nincreasing, for he knew that he was no longer covered, that there was\r\nno longer a single man guarding the defiles of the Argonne, and that\r\nconsequently he might be attacked at any moment. On this account he had\r\njust despatched the 4th Hussars to reconnoitre the country as far as\r\nthe defiles of Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9 and La Croix-aux-Bois, with orders to procure\r\nhim some information at any cost.\r\n\r\nBread, meat and forage had been given out the day before, thanks to\r\nthe energy of the Mayor of Vouziers; and that morning, at about ten\r\no\'clock, orders had just been issued that the men might cook their\r\n_soupe_--since they might not be able to do so later on--when a general\r\nflutter was occasioned by the departure of some more troops, General\r\nBordas\'s brigade, which took the same road as the Hussars. What was\r\nup? Were they all going to start? Wouldn\'t they be allowed to have a\r\nquiet meal now that the pots were on the fires? Some of the officers\r\nthereupon explained that Bordas\'s brigade had simply received orders to\r\noccupy Buzancy, a few miles away, whilst others, it must be admitted,\r\nasserted that the Hussars had come in contact with a large force of the\r\nenemy\'s cavalry, and that the brigade had been sent to the front to\r\nextricate them.\r\n\r\nMaurice now enjoyed a few delightful hours of repose. He had stretched\r\nhimself out in a field, where the regiment was encamped halfway up the\r\nheight, and, numbed as it were with fatigue, he lay there gazing over\r\nthe verdant valley of the Aisne, with its meadows dotted with tufts of\r\ntrees through which the river slowly coursed. In front of him Vouziers\r\nwas reared, built in amphitheatral fashion, and closing the valley, its\r\nroofs rising one above the other, crowned by the dome-covered tower and\r\nthe tapering steeple of the church. Down below, near the bridge, the\r\ntannery chimneys were smoking, whilst at the other end of the town the\r\nbuildings of a large mill, white with flour, were to be seen among the\r\nfoliage on the river bank. And this view of the little town, rising\r\nabove the tall rushes, was in Maurice\'s eyes invested with a tender\r\ncharm as though he had again become a sensitive being, a dreamer. His\r\nyouth seemed to be coming back to him, the days long past which he had\r\nspent at Vouziers at the time when his home was at Le Ch\xc3\xaane, his native\r\nplace. For an hour or so he forgot everything else.\r\n\r\nThe _soupe_ had long since been eaten, and the men were still waiting,\r\nwhen at about half-past two o\'clock an increasing agitation spread\r\nthrough the camp. Orders sped right and left, the meadows were\r\nevacuated, and all the troops climbed and ranged themselves on the\r\nhills between a couple of villages, Chestres and Falaise, lying some\r\ntwo or three miles apart. The Engineers at once began digging trenches\r\nand raising breast-works, whilst the reserve artillery placed itself\r\non the left, crowning a hillock there. A rumour spread that General\r\nBordas had just sent an estafette to say that having encountered\r\nsuperior forces at Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9 he was forced to fall back on Buzancy,\r\nwhich made one fear that his line of retreat on Vouziers might soon be\r\nintercepted. The commander of the Seventh Corps, believing an attack\r\nimminent, had therefore decided to place his men in position so that he\r\nmight withstand the onslaught until the remainder of the army came up\r\nto support him; and one of his aides-de-camp had already started off\r\nwith a letter, informing Marshal MacMahon of the situation, and asking\r\nhim for help. Then, fearing the embarrassment which might be occasioned\r\nby that interminable convoy of supplies, which had again joined the\r\ncorps during the night, the general set it in motion at once, ordering\r\nit, in haphazard fashion, to proceed in the direction of Chagny. All\r\nthis meant fighting.\r\n\r\n\'So it\'s serious, sir, this time?\' Maurice ventured to ask Lieutenant\r\nRochas.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes, ---- it!\' replied the lieutenant waving his long arm; \'you\'ll\r\nsee how hot it will be by-and-by.\'\r\n\r\nAll the men were delighted. Since the line of battle had been formed\r\nfrom Chestres to Falaise the animation of the camp had become still\r\ngreater, and feverish impatience was seizing hold of the men. At last,\r\nthen, they were about to see those Prussians, whom the newspapers\r\ndescribed as being worn out with marching and exhausted by disease, who\r\nwere said to be famished and clad in rags; and the hope of overthrowing\r\nthem at the first brush raised everybody\'s courage.\r\n\r\n\'So we\'ve found one another at last, and a good job too,\' said Jean.\r\n\'We\'ve been playing at hide and seek quite long enough; ever since we\r\nlost each other near the frontier, after that battle. But are these the\r\nones who beat MacMahon?\'\r\n\r\nMaurice hesitated, and was unable to answer. According to what he\r\nhad read at Rheims, it seemed to him difficult that the third German\r\narmy, commanded by the Crown Prince of Prussia, could be at Vouziers\r\nwhen a couple of days previously it appeared to have encamped in the\r\nvicinity of Vitry-le-Fran\xc3\xa7ois. There had certainly been some mention\r\nof a fourth army, under the orders of the Crown Prince of Saxony,\r\nwhich was to operate on the Meuse; and probably it was this one that\r\nthey were about to encounter, though the rapidity of the occupation of\r\nGrand-Pr\xc3\xa9 astonished him, as the Meuse was so far away. Maurice\'s ideas\r\nbecame altogether confused, however, when, to his stupefaction, he\r\nheard General Bourgain-Desfeuilles asking a peasant of Falaise whether\r\nthe Meuse did not pass by Buzancy, and whether there were not some\r\nstrong bridges there. Moreover, in his serene ignorance, the general\r\nasserted that they were about to be attacked by a column of one hundred\r\nthousand men coming from Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9, whilst another of sixty thousand\r\nwas advancing by way of Ste. Menehould.\r\n\r\n\'And your foot?\' asked Jean, addressing Maurice.\r\n\r\n\'I no longer feel it,\' the latter replied, with a laugh. \'If we fight,\r\nI shall be all right.\'\r\n\r\nThis was true; such intense nervous excitement buoyed him up that he\r\nno longer seemed to tread the ground. To think that he had not burnt\r\na cartridge since the campaign began! He had marched to the frontier,\r\nhe had spent that terrible night of anguish before Mulhausen, without\r\nseeing a Prussian, without firing a shot; and then he had been obliged\r\nto retreat, first to Belfort, and then to Rheims; and now for five\r\ndays past he had again been marching to meet the enemy, and his\r\nchassepot was still immaculate, unused. He experienced an increasing\r\nneed, a slowly gathering longing to level his gun and fire at anyone\r\nor anything, in order to ease his nerves. During the six weeks or\r\nso that had elapsed since he had enlisted in a spasm of enthusiasm,\r\nimagining that he would fight the very next day, he had only employed\r\nhis poor delicate feet in running away and tramping along, afar from\r\nany field of battle. Thus it happened that amid the feverish expectancy\r\nof the entire corps, he was one of those who consulted with the most\r\nimpatience that Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9 road, which stretched far away into the\r\ndistance in a straight line between two rows of lovely trees. The\r\nvalley where the Aisne coursed like a silver ribbon among the poplars\r\nand the willows, was spread out below him; but his eyes returned\r\nperforce to the road lying yonder.\r\n\r\nThere was an alert at about four o\'clock. The 4th Hussars came back\r\nafter a long round, and stories of some encounters they had had with\r\nUhlans, repeated with increasing exaggeration by all who heard them,\r\nbegan to circulate; confirming everyone in the impression that an\r\nattack was imminent. A couple of hours later a fresh estafette arrived\r\nwith a scared look, and explained that General Bordas no longer dared\r\nto leave Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9, as he was convinced that the road to Vouziers was\r\ncut. This was not yet the case, since the estafette had been able\r\nto pass without hindrance; still it might occur at any moment, and\r\naccordingly General Dumont, the commander of the division, set out with\r\nhis remaining brigade to extricate the other. The sun was now setting\r\nbehind Vouziers, whose roofs stood out blackly against a large red\r\ncloud. For a long time the men in camp were able to see the brigade as\r\nit marched along between the rows of trees, but at last it faded from\r\nsight in the growing darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel de Vineuil came to make sure that his men were in good\r\npositions for the night, he was astonished not to find Captain Beaudoin\r\nat his post. The captain arrived, however, from Vouziers at that very\r\nmoment, and when by way of excusing himself he explained that he had\r\nbeen lunching at Baroness de Ladicourt\'s, in the town, he received\r\na severe reprimand, which, it must be admitted, he listened to in\r\nsilence, in the irreproachable attitude of a smart officer.\r\n\r\n\'My lads,\' the colonel repeated, as he passed among his men, \'we\r\nshall no doubt be attacked to-night or certainly to-morrow morning at\r\ndaybreak. Mind you are ready, and remember that the 106th has never\r\nretreated.\'\r\n\r\nThey all acclaimed him; and indeed, in the weariness and discouragement\r\nthat had been growing upon them since their departure from Rheims\r\nthey all longed to finish matters with a tussle. The chassepots were\r\nexamined and the needles changed; and then, as they had eaten their\r\n_soupe_ in the morning, the men contented themselves, that night,\r\nwith some coffee and biscuit. They received orders not to turn in;\r\nand picket guards were stationed at some sixteen hundred yards from\r\nthe camp, whilst sentinels were placed as far away as the banks of\r\nthe Aisne. The officers sat up watching around the camp fires; by the\r\nleaping glow of one of which, near a low wall, it was possible to\r\ndistinguish every now and then the embroidery on the garish uniforms\r\nworn by the commander-in-chief and his staff, together with shadows\r\nthat moved rapidly and anxiously, hastening at times towards the road\r\nto listen there for the sound of horses\' hoofs--so intense was the\r\ndisquietude concerning the fate of the Third Division.\r\n\r\nAt about one in the morning Maurice was stationed as sentry at the\r\nedge of a field of plum trees, between the road and the river. The\r\nnight was as black as ink, and as soon as he found himself alone in the\r\noverwhelming silence of the sleeping country he felt a sensation of\r\nfear take possession of him, a terrible fear which he had never before\r\nexperienced, and which he was unable to conquer, despite a tremor of\r\nanger and shame. He turned round in the hope that the sight of the\r\ncamp fires would tranquillise him, but they were hidden by a little\r\nwood, and only a sea of darkness stretched behind him, save that at a\r\ngreat distance away a few solitary lights shone out from the houses of\r\nVouziers, whose inhabitants, warned, no doubt, of the state of affairs,\r\nand shuddering at the idea of the approaching battle, had not retired\r\nto rest. What completed Maurice\'s fright was that on levelling his\r\nchassepot he found that he could not even distinguish its sight. Then\r\nbegan a cruel spell of waiting, with all the faculties of his being\r\ncentred in the sense of hearing--his ears open to almost imperceptible\r\nsounds, and filling at last with a thunderous uproar. The trickling\r\nof some distant water, the light stir of some leaves, the spring of\r\nan insect--all acquired a deafening sonority. Was not that the gallop\r\nof horses, the continuous rumble of artillery coming straight towards\r\nhim from over yonder? What was that sound he heard on the left--was\r\nit not a cautious whisper, the stifled voices of some advanced guard\r\ncreeping forward in the darkness and preparing a surprise? On three\r\noccasions he was on the point of firing to give the alarm. The fear\r\nof being mistaken, of appearing ridiculous, increased his discomfort.\r\nHe had knelt down, resting his left shoulder against a tree, and it\r\nseemed as if he had been there for hours, as if he had been forgotten\r\nand the army had gone away without him. Then suddenly he no longer felt\r\nfrightened, but clearly distinguished the rhythmical tread of infantry\r\nmarching along the road, which he knew to be some two hundred yards\r\naway. He immediately felt convinced that this was General Dumont,\r\nbringing back Bordas\'s brigade, the troops who had remained in distress\r\nat Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9, and whose return was so anxiously awaited. Just then he\r\nwas relieved, his sentry duty having barely lasted the regulation hour.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, the Third Division returning to the camp, and the\r\nrelief was immense. But at the same time more minute precautions were\r\ntaken, for the information brought back by the returning generals\r\nconfirmed all that the commander thought he knew respecting the enemy\'s\r\napproach. A few prisoners had been brought in, some dark Uhlans, draped\r\nin large cloaks, but these refused to answer the questions put to them.\r\nThe morning twilight, the lurid dawn of a rainy day was now rising amid\r\nthe unremitting expectancy, fraught with enervating impatience, that\r\nfilled every breast. For nearly fourteen hours the men had not dared\r\nto close their eyes. At about seven o\'clock Lieutenant Rochas related\r\nthat MacMahon was approaching with the entire army. The truth, however,\r\nwas that General Douay, in reply to his despatch of the previous day,\r\nannouncing that a battle near Vouziers was inevitable, had received a\r\nletter from the marshal telling him to hold out until it was possible\r\nto support him. The army\'s forward movement was now arrested, the\r\nFirst Corps advanced upon Terron, and the Fifth on Buzancy, whilst the\r\nTwelfth remained at Le Ch\xc3\xaane, to form a second line there; and now the\r\ngeneral expectancy increased, no mere engagement was to be fought, but\r\na great battle, in which the entire army would participate, for which\r\npurpose it was turning aside from the Meuse to march southwards through\r\nthe valley of the Aisne. The men again had to content themselves with\r\ncoffee and biscuit, their commanders not daring to let them cook their\r\n_soupe_ since the tussle was for noon at the latest--at least so\r\neverybody repeated, without knowing why. An aide-de-camp had just been\r\ndespatched to the marshal with the view of hastening the arrival of\r\nthe expected succour, since the approach of the two hostile armies was\r\nbecoming more and more certain; and three hours later another officer\r\ngalloped off to Le Ch\xc3\xaane, where head quarters were established, to\r\nask for orders, so greatly had General Douay\'s disquietude increased\r\nin consequence of the information brought him by a village mayor,\r\nwho declared he had seen a hundred thousand men at Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9, whilst\r\nanother hundred thousand were coming up by way of Buzancy.\r\n\r\nNoon came, but there was still not a Prussian to be seen. One o\'clock,\r\ntwo o\'clock passed, still nothing. Then lassitude came, and with it\r\ndoubt. In bantering voices the men began to jeer at their generals, who\r\nhad taken fright, perhaps, at sight of their own shadows on some wall.\r\nIt would be a charity to provide them with spectacles. Nice humbugs\r\nthey were to have set everybody agog for nothing! And a wag called out:\r\n\'Is it the same as it was at Mulhausen, then?\'\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Maurice, in the anguish of his recollections, felt a\r\npang at his heart. He remembered that foolish flight, that panic which\r\nhad carried the Seventh Corps ten leagues away, although not a single\r\nGerman had shown himself! And the same affair was beginning again; he\r\nwas fully convinced of it. If the enemy had not attacked them, now that\r\nfour-and-twenty hours had elapsed since the skirmish of Grand-Pr\xc3\xa9, it\r\ncould only be that the 4th Hussars had simply come into collision with\r\nsome reconnoitring party of the enemy\'s cavalry. The hostile columns\r\nmust still be far off, perhaps a couple of days\' march away. This idea\r\nsuddenly terrified Maurice, for he thought of all the time that the\r\nFrench had lost. In three days they had barely covered a distance of\r\ntwo leagues from Contreuve to Vouziers. On the 25th the other army\r\ncorps had marched northward, under pretence of obtaining supplies,\r\nwhilst now, on the 27th, they were descending southwards to accept a\r\nbattle that no one offered them. Following the 4th Hussars towards the\r\nabandoned defiles of the Argonne, Bordas\'s brigade had fancied itself\r\nlost; and this had entailed the immediate advance of the remainder of\r\nthe division that it belonged to, the immobilisation of the entire\r\nSeventh Corps, and finally the southward march of the rest of the\r\narmy--all to no purpose! And Maurice reflected that each hour was of\r\nincalculable value, given that mad plan of joining Bazaine, a plan\r\nwhich only a general of genius could have executed with the help of\r\nveterans, and provided that he rushed straight before him and through\r\nevery obstacle, like a blizzard.\r\n\r\n\'We are done for!\' Maurice exclaimed, seized with despair in a sudden\r\nbrief flash of lucidity.\r\n\r\nThen, as Jean, to whom he addressed himself, opened his eyes wide,\r\nfailing to understand him, he continued in an undertone, so that his\r\nwords might only reach the corporal\'s ear: \'The commanders are stupid\r\nrather than malicious, that\'s certain, and they have no luck! They know\r\nnothing, they foresee nothing, they have no plan, no ideas, no lucky\r\nchances--Ah! everything\'s against us!\'\r\n\r\nThe discouragement which possessed Maurice, and which he analysed like\r\nan intelligent, well-educated man, was increasing and weighing more and\r\nmore heavily upon all the troops who were immobilised there, consumed\r\nwith waiting and expectation. Doubt and a presentiment of the truth\r\nwere dimly penetrating their sluggish brains; and there was not a man\r\namong them, however limited his mental powers, who did not experience\r\nan uneasy consciousness that he was badly commanded, and ought not to\r\nhave been where he was; though on the other hand he could not exactly\r\ntell why it was that he felt so exasperated. What were they doing\r\nthere, good heavens! since the Prussians did not appear? Let them\r\neither fight at once or go off somewhere where they could sleep in\r\npeace. They had had quite enough of it. The anxiety went on increasing\r\nevery minute after the departure of the last aide-de-camp despatched\r\nto Le Ch\xc3\xaane for orders, and the men gathered together in groups and\r\ndiscussed matters openly. Their agitation even gained the officers, who\r\ndid not know what to reply to those who were bold enough to question\r\nthem. And thus it came to pass that every breast was lightened as of a\r\ngrievous burden, and gave vent to a sigh of profound delight when, at\r\nfive o\'clock, a report spread that the aide-de-camp had returned, and\r\nthat they were now about to fall back!\r\n\r\nSo prudence had at last gained the upper hand! The Emperor and\r\nMacMahon, who had never been in favour of that advance on Montm\xc3\xa9dy,\r\nand who felt uneasy at the news that they had again been outmarched\r\nby the foe, and were about to find both the army of the Crown Prince\r\nof Prussia and that of the Crown Prince of Saxony confronting them,\r\nrenounced all idea of that improbable junction with Bazaine, and\r\ndecided upon retreating by way of the northern strongholds, in such\r\na manner as to fall back eventually upon Paris. The Seventh Corps\r\nreceived orders to proceed to Chagny by way of Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux,\r\nwhilst the Fifth was to march on Poix, and the Fifth and Twelfth on\r\nVendresse. But if they were to fall back, why had they thus advanced to\r\nthe Aisne--why had so many days been lost--why had they been subjected\r\nto so much fatigue, when it would have been so easy and so logical\r\nfor them, at the time they were at Rheims, to have taken up strong\r\npositions forthwith in the valley of the Marne? Had their commanders no\r\nmanaging capacity, no military talent, no common-sense even? However,\r\nthe men no longer took the trouble to question one another; they\r\nforgave the past in their delight at the sensible decision which had\r\nat last been arrived at--the only method by which they might extricate\r\nthemselves from the wasp\'s nest into which they had ventured. From the\r\ngenerals down to the rank and file, one and all felt that they could\r\nagain recover strength--nay, prove invincible--under Paris, and that it\r\nwas there that they would beat the Prussians. But it was necessary to\r\nevacuate Vouziers at daybreak, so that they might be on their march to\r\nLe Ch\xc3\xaane before being attacked, and the camp at once became the scene\r\nof extraordinary animation, the bugles sounded and orders crossed,\r\nwhilst the baggage train and army-service convoy started in advance so\r\nas to lighten the rear-guard.\r\n\r\nMaurice was delighted, but while he was endeavouring to explain to\r\nJean the movement of the retreat which they were about to execute, he\r\nsuddenly gave vent to a cry of pain. His excitement had fallen, and he\r\nagain felt his foot weighing his leg down like lead. \'What\'s up? Has\r\nit begun again?\' asked the corporal, really grieved. Then, as an idea\r\ncame into that practical head of his, he added: \'Listen, youngster; you\r\ntold me yesterday that you had some friends at Le Ch\xc3\xaane, the town where\r\nwe are going. Well, you ought to get the major\'s permission to drive\r\nthere. You would have a good night\'s rest in a comfortable bed, and\r\nto-morrow, should you be able to walk better, we could take you up on\r\nour way. Eh? Does that suit you?\'\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Maurice had found an old friend of his father\'s at\r\nFalaise, the village near which they were encamped; and this man, a\r\npetty farmer, was about to take his daughter to Le Ch\xc3\xaane, to confide\r\nher to the care of an aunt there, and had a horse, harnessed to a light\r\ncart, already waiting to start.\r\n\r\nMatters nearly turned out badly, however, at the very first words that\r\nMaurice addressed to Major Bouroche: \'I have injured my foot, _Monsieur\r\nle docteur_,\' he began.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Bouroche, shaking his large lion-like head, roared\r\nout: \'I\'m not _Monsieur le docteur_! Who on earth has sent me such a\r\nsoldier as you?\' And as Maurice, quite scared, began to stammer an\r\napology, he resumed: \'I\'m the major; do you hear me, you idiot?\' Then\r\nrealising the kind of man he had to deal with, he, doubtless, felt\r\nsomewhat ashamed of himself, for he flew into a yet more violent\r\ntantrum: \'Your foot! a fine affair! Yes, yes, I allow you. Get into a\r\ncart, get into a balloon if you like. We\'ve got quite enough dawdlers\r\nand pillagers already!\'\r\n\r\nWhen Jean helped Maurice to hoist himself into the cart, the latter\r\nturned round to thank him; and the two men fell into each other\'s arms\r\nas if they were not likely ever to see one another again. Indeed, who\r\ncould tell--what with the commotion of the retreat and those Prussians\r\nwho were near by? Maurice was surprised to feel how great was the\r\naffection that already attached him to Jean. He turned round twice\r\nto wave his hand to him; and then he set out from the camp, where\r\npreparations were now being made to light some large fires, for the\r\npurpose of deceiving the enemy as to the army\'s presence, whilst in\r\nreality the troops marched off, in the strictest silence, before the\r\ndawn of day.\r\n\r\nOnce on the road, the petty farmer who was driving Maurice did not\r\ncease to bewail the evil times. He had lacked the necessary courage\r\nto remain at Falaise, and yet he already regretted having left it,\r\nrepeating that he would be utterly ruined if the enemy should burn\r\nhis house. His daughter--a tall, pale creature--was crying. Maurice,\r\nhowever--drunk, as it were, with weariness--did not hear either of\r\nthem, but slept on in a sitting posture, rocked by the rapid trot\r\nof the little horse, which in less than an hour and a half covered\r\nthe four leagues lying between Vouziers and Le Ch\xc3\xaane. It was not yet\r\nseven o\'clock, and the twilight had scarcely fallen, when the young\r\nfellow, shivering and perplexed, alighted on the Place, near the bridge\r\nspanning the canal, and in front of the narrow yellow house where he\r\nhad been born and had spent the first twenty years of his life. He was\r\ngoing there in a mechanical sort of way, oblivious of the fact that\r\nthe house had been sold to a veterinary surgeon some eighteen months\r\npreviously. When the farmer questioned him on the subject, he answered\r\nthat he knew very well whither he was bound; and then thanked him\r\nrepeatedly for his kindness in giving him a lift.\r\n\r\nHowever, whilst approaching the well in the centre of the little\r\ntriangular Place, he stopped short, dazed, and with his head quite\r\nempty. Where did he really intend to go? Suddenly he remembered\r\nthat he had previously decided to call at the notary\'s house, which\r\nadjoined his former home, to ask hospitality of the notary\'s mother,\r\nthat venerable, good-hearted old lady, Madame Desroches, who in a\r\nneighbourly way had spoilt him when he was a child. But he could\r\nscarcely recognise Le Ch\xc3\xaane, usually such a dead-alive little place,\r\namid the extraordinary agitation that now prevailed in it, owing to\r\nthe presence of the army corps which was camping in its outskirts\r\nand filling its streets with officers, army followers, prowlers, and\r\nlaggards of all descriptions. He certainly recognised the canal,\r\ncrossing the town from end to end and cutting athwart the central\r\nPlace, the two triangular sections of which were united by a narrow\r\nstone bridge. Over there, too, on the other bank, the mossy-roofed\r\nmarket could readily be identified, together with the Rue Berond\r\nplunging down on the left, and the road to Sedan stretching away on\r\nthe right. Only, from the spot where he stood, it was necessary that\r\nhe should raise his eyes and search for the slated belfry crowning the\r\nnotary\'s house, to make sure that this was the once deserted corner\r\nwhere he had played at hopscotch; to such a degree, indeed, did the Rue\r\nde Vouziers in front of him now swarm with people, flowing along in a\r\ncompact crowd as far as the town-hall. It seemed to him that an open\r\nspace was being kept on the Place, and that some men were making the\r\ninquisitive townsfolk retire; and, in fact, behind the well he beheld\r\nto his astonishment quite an assemblage of vehicles, vans and waggons,\r\na perfect baggage camp, which he had certainly seen somewhere before.\r\n\r\nIt was still light, the sun had scarcely sunk in the unrippled water of\r\nthe canal, tinging it as with blood, and Maurice had just decided what\r\ncourse he would adopt, when a woman, standing near by, who had been\r\nlooking at him for a few moments, exclaimed: \'Good heavens! but I\'m\r\nsurely not mistaken; you are young Levasseur?\'\r\n\r\nIn his turn, he then recognised Madame Combette, wife of a chemist\r\nwhose shop was on the Place, and he began to explain to her that he\r\nwas going to ask worthy Madame Desroches for a bed; but at this she\r\nbecame strangely agitated and dragged him away, saying: \'No, no, just\r\ncome indoors with me. I will explain matters to you.\' Then, when they\r\nwere in the shop and she had carefully closed the door, she added:\r\n\'What, don\'t you know, my dear boy, that the Emperor is stopping at the\r\nDesroches\' house? It was requisitioned for him, and the Desroches are\r\nby no means pleased with the honour, I can tell you! To think that the\r\npoor old lady, a woman of over seventy, has been obliged to give up her\r\nroom to go and sleep under the eaves in a servant\'s bed! Everything\r\nyou see on the Place there belongs to the Emperor; it\'s his luggage,\r\nyou understand.\'\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, Maurice now well remembered that he had seen those\r\nvans and carts--all the superb train, in fact, of the imperial\r\nhousehold--while he was at Rheims.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my dear boy, if you only knew what a number of things have been\r\ntaken out of those vans--silver plate, and bottles of wine, and baskets\r\nof provisions, and beautiful linen, and all manner of other things\r\nbesides! It went on without stopping for a couple of hours. I wonder\r\nwhere they can have put so many things, for the house isn\'t a large\r\none. Just look! See what a fire they\'ve lighted in the kitchen!\'\r\n\r\nMaurice then turned to glance at the little two-storeyed white house,\r\nwhich stood at the corner of the Place and the Rue de Vouziers, a house\r\nof quiet _bourgeoise_ aspect, the disposition of which he pictured\r\nto himself as readily as though he had been inside it only the day\r\nbefore. Downstairs there was the central passage running right through\r\nthe house, and then on each floor there were four rooms. The corner\r\nfirst-floor window, overlooking the Place, was already lighted up, and\r\nthe chemist\'s wife explained that this was the window of the Emperor\'s\r\nroom. However, as she had already indicated, by far the greater blaze\r\nwas in the kitchen, which was on the ground floor, with a window facing\r\nthe Rue de Vouziers. The inhabitants of Le Ch\xc3\xaane had never previously\r\nseen such a sight as this kitchen now presented, and the street was\r\nblocked with an incessantly renewed stream of inquisitive people all\r\nagape in front of that fiery furnace, where an emperor\'s dinner was\r\nroasting and boiling. So that they might have a little fresh air the\r\ncooks had set the window wide open. There were three of them, attired\r\nin dazzling white jackets, now fluttering about in front of the fowls\r\nimpaled on a tremendously long spit, and now stirring the sauces which\r\nwere simmering in huge copper pans that shone like gold. And the oldest\r\ninhabitants could not remember having ever seen so much fire burning,\r\nand so much food cooking at the same time, even on the occasion of the\r\ngrandest wedding feasts given at the White Lion Inn.\r\n\r\nCombette, the chemist, a restless, weazen, little man, returned home\r\ngreatly excited by all he had seen and heard. He appeared to be in the\r\nsecret of what was passing, owing to his position as assessor to the\r\nmayor. It was at about half-past three that MacMahon had telegraphed\r\nto Bazaine that the arrival of the Crown Prince of Prussia at Ch\xc3\xa2lons\r\ncompelled him to fall back upon the northern fortresses; and another\r\ndespatch was about to be sent to the Minister of War, warning him of\r\nthe retreat, and explaining to him that the army was in imminent peril\r\nof being cut in twain and annihilated. As for the despatch addressed\r\nto Bazaine, that might go and welcome, but it was doubtful whether\r\nit would ever get to him, for all communications with Metz appeared\r\nto have been intercepted for some days past. The other telegram,\r\nhowever, was a much more serious affair; and the chemist, lowering\r\nhis voice, related that he had heard an officer of high rank remark:\r\n\'If they should be warned in Paris we are dished!\' This was easily\r\nunderstood, for everyone was aware of the bitter fierceness with which\r\nthe Empress-Regent and the Ministerial Council incited the army to\r\na forward march. However, the confusion was increasing every hour,\r\nand the most extraordinary intelligence was arriving respecting the\r\napproach of the German armies. Was it possible that the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia could be at Ch\xc3\xa2lons? In that case, to what army belonged the\r\nUhlans with whom the Hussars of the Seventh Corps had come in conflict\r\nin the defiles of the Argonne?[23]\r\n\r\n\'They know nothing at head quarters,\' continued the chemist, waving his\r\narms in a despairing way. \'Ah! what a fearful muddle! Still, everything\r\nwill be all right if the army retreats to-morrow.\' Then, kind-hearted\r\nman that he was at bottom, he resumed: \'Listen to me, my young friend.\r\nI will dress your foot: you shall dine with us and sleep upstairs in my\r\nassistant\'s little room, since he\'s bolted.\'\r\n\r\nTormented, however, by a desire to see and learn, Maurice determined\r\nthat first of all he would follow out his original idea by paying old\r\nMadame Desroches a visit. He was surprised that he was not stopped\r\nat the door of the house, which, amid all the tumult on the Place,\r\nremained wide open without even a sentry to guard it. Various people,\r\nofficers and servants, were continually going in and coming out, and it\r\nseemed as though the commotion prevailing in the kitchen had extended\r\nto the entire premises. However, there was no light on the stairs up\r\nwhich Maurice had to grope his way. With beating heart, he paused for\r\na few seconds on the first landing, in front of the door of the room\r\nwhich he knew to be occupied by the Emperor, but not a sound came from\r\nthis room, a death-like silence prevailed there. And up above, when he\r\nreached the threshold of the servant\'s chamber where Madame Desroches\r\nhad been compelled to take refuge, the poor old lady was at first\r\nquite frightened at sight of him. Having recognised him, however, she\r\nexclaimed: \'Ah! my child, in what a dreadful moment do we meet! I would\r\nwillingly have given the Emperor my house, but he has such frightfully\r\nill-bred people with him! If you only knew how they have laid hands\r\non everything, and they certainly must mean to burn all the fuel, for\r\nthey are keeping up such monstrous fires! The poor man is as pale as\r\nthough he had just stepped out of the grave, and he looks so sad.\'\r\nThen, as the young fellow went off, after trying to tranquillise her,\r\nshe crossed the landing and leant over the banisters. \'There!\' she\r\nmuttered, \'you can see him from here--Ah! we are certainly all lost!\r\nFarewell, my child!\'\r\n\r\nMaurice had remained standing on the stairs in the darkness. On craning\r\nhis neck forward he beheld, through a fan-light, so remarkable a scene\r\nthat it dwelt for ever afterwards in his memory. At one end of the\r\ncold, plainly furnished room, the Emperor sat at a small table, laid\r\nfor dinner and lighted on either side by a candle. In the background\r\nwere two silent aides-de-camp, whilst a _ma\xc3\xaetre d\'h\xc3\xb4tel_ stood beside\r\nthe table, waiting. The glass had not been used, the bread had not been\r\ntouched, some fowl\'s breast lying on the plate was getting cold. The\r\nEmperor sat there stock-still, looking at the table-cloth with those\r\ndim, wavering, watery eyes that Maurice had already noticed at Rheims.\r\nBut he seemed to be even more weary now, and when, apparently with\r\na great effort, he had made up his mind and had carried a couple of\r\nmouthfuls to his lips, he pushed all the rest aside. He had dined. An\r\nexpression of intense suffering, endured in secret, made his pale face\r\nlook even whiter than before.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, the door of the dining-room was opened just as Maurice\r\npassed out, and, amid the flare of the candles and the smoke of the\r\ndishes, he perceived a tableful of equerries, aides-de-camp, and\r\nchamberlains, who were emptying the bottles from the vans, devouring\r\nthe fowls, and polishing off the sauces between loud bursts of\r\nconversation. Since the marshal\'s despatch had gone off, the conviction\r\nthat they were about to retreat had been filling all these folks with\r\ndelight. In another week or so they would be in Paris, and have clean\r\nbeds again.\r\n\r\nThen Maurice suddenly realised how terribly he was overcome with\r\nfatigue. It was, indeed, certain--the whole army was about to retreat,\r\nand that being so, there was nothing for him to do but to sleep pending\r\nthe arrival of the Seventh Corps. He crossed the Place again, and once\r\nmore found himself at the chemist\'s, where he dined as though in a\r\ndream. Then it certainly seemed to him that his foot was dressed and\r\nthat he was carried into a room upstairs. Black night, annihilation\r\nfollowed. He slept on, overwhelmed, and scarcely breathing. After an\r\nuncertain lapse of time, however--hours or centuries, he could not\r\ntell--a shudder disturbed his slumbers, and he sat up in bed in the\r\nprofound darkness. Where was he? What was that continuous roar of\r\nthunder that had awakened him? All at once his memory returned, and\r\nhe hastened to the window to look out. In the obscurity down below\r\na regiment of artillery was crossing the Place, usually so quiet at\r\nnight time; the men, horses, and guns following each other in endless\r\nsuccession, at a trot which made the little lifeless houses fairly\r\nshake. Unreasoning disquietude took possession of Maurice as he beheld\r\nthis sudden departure. What time could it be? The town-hall clock\r\nstruck four. He was endeavouring to tranquillise himself, reflecting\r\nthat the scene he witnessed must simply be the outcome of the orders\r\nissued the previous afternoon, when on turning his head he perceived\r\nsomething which gave the finishing stroke to his anguish. The corner\r\nfirst-floor window at the notary\'s house was still lighted up, and at\r\nregular intervals the dark shadow of the Emperor was profiled upon the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nMaurice quickly slipped on his trousers, intending to go downstairs,\r\nbut at this moment Combette appeared on the threshold carrying a\r\ncandlestick and gesticulating. \'I saw you from below just as I came\r\nback from the town-hall,\' he said, \'and I came up to tell you the news.\r\nJust fancy! they haven\'t let me go to bed! For two hours past the\r\nmayor and I have had to attend to fresh requisitions. Yes, once again\r\neverything is altered. Ah! that officer who didn\'t want any telegram to\r\nbe sent to Paris was in the right!\'\r\n\r\nHe continued talking for a long time in imperfect, disjointed phrases;\r\nand Maurice, who remained silent, with anguish in his heart, ended by\r\nunderstanding him. At about midnight a telegram for the Emperor had\r\narrived from the Minister of War, in reply to that sent to Paris by\r\nthe marshal. The exact wording of the despatch was not known; but an\r\naide-de-camp had openly declared at the town-hall that the Empress and\r\nthe Ministerial Council feared there would be a revolution in Paris\r\nif the Emperor abandoned Bazaine and returned there. Those who had\r\ndrawn up the despatch, inaccurately informed as to the true positions\r\nof the German forces, seemed to believe that the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons had\r\nan advance upon the enemy which it no longer possessed, and with an\r\nextraordinary burst of passion insisted, despite everything, on a\r\nforward march.\r\n\r\n\'The Emperor sent for the marshal,\' added the chemist, \'and they\r\nremained shut up together during nearly an hour. Of course, I don\'t\r\nknow what they said to each other, but all the officers have repeated\r\nto me that we are no longer retreating, and that the march on the Meuse\r\nis resumed. We have just requisitioned all the ovens in the town for\r\nthe First Corps, which to-morrow morning will arrive here in place of\r\nthe Twelfth, whose artillery, as you can see for yourself, is at this\r\nmoment starting for La Besace. This time it\'s settled; you are marching\r\nto battle.\' He paused. He also was looking at the lighted window at the\r\nnotary\'s. Then, with a thoughtful, inquisitive air, he resumed in an\r\nundertone: \'Yes; what can they have said to one another? It\'s comical\r\nall the same. A man\'s threatened with danger, and, in order to avoid\r\nit, he decides at six o\'clock that he will retreat; then, at midnight,\r\nhe rushes head first into that very danger, although the situation\r\nremains identical.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice was still listening to the guns as they rolled along through\r\nthe little black town down below, to the horses trotting past without\r\ncessation, to the men flowing away towards the Meuse, towards the\r\nterrible Unknown of the morrow. And, meantime, on the little window\r\ncurtains he still saw the Emperor\'s shadow pass by at regular\r\nintervals; the shadow of that invalid, kept on his legs by insomnia,\r\npacing to and fro, feeling that he must needs continue on the move\r\ndespite all his sufferings, and with his ears full of the noise made by\r\nall those horses and soldiers whom he was sending to death. So a few\r\nhours had sufficed, and now the disaster was decided upon, accepted!\r\nWhat, indeed, could they have said to each other, that Emperor and that\r\nmarshal, both of whom were aware of the calamity to which they were\r\nmarching, who in the evening had been convinced of defeat--given the\r\nfrightful situation in which the army would henceforth find itself--and\r\nwho could not have changed their opinion in the morning since the peril\r\nwas increasing hour by hour? General de Palikao\'s plan, the lightning\r\nmarch on Montm\xc3\xa9dy, already a hazardous venture on August 22, still\r\nsusceptible, possibly, of accomplishment on the 25th, with veterans\r\nand a captain of genius, became on the 27th an act of sheer madness\r\nin presence of the continual hesitation of the commanders and the\r\nincreasing demoralisation of the troops. If both Emperor and marshal\r\nknew this, why did they yield to the pitiless voices that goaded them\r\non in their indecision? The marshal, perhaps, had but the limited,\r\nobedient mind of the soldier, great in its abnegation. And the Emperor,\r\nwho no longer commanded, was awaiting destiny. They were asked to give\r\ntheir lives and the lives of the army, and they consented to give them.\r\nThat was the Night of the Crime--the abominable night when a nation\r\nwas murdered, for thenceforward the army was in distress, one hundred\r\nthousand men were sent to the slaughter!\r\n\r\nDespairing and shuddering, Maurice thought of all these things as\r\nhe watched that shadow on Madame Desroches\' dainty muslin curtains,\r\nthat feverish shadow ever on the tramp, and which the pitiless voice\r\ncoming from Paris seemed to be urging on. Had not the Empress wished\r\nthat night for the father\'s death so that the son might reign? March!\r\nmarch! without a glance behind, under the rain and through the mud,\r\nmarch to extermination, so that this supreme final game for possession\r\nof an agonising empire may be played out to the last card! March!\r\nmarch! die like a hero on the piled-up corpses of your people; strike\r\nthe whole world with compassionate admiration so that it may forgive\r\nyour posterity! And doubtless the Emperor _was_ marching to death.\r\nThe kitchen was no longer blazing down below; the equerries, the\r\naides-de-camp, the chamberlains were all asleep; the whole house was\r\nblack, save for that lighted window, on the curtains of which the\r\nshadow was incessantly passing to and fro, the shadow of one who had\r\nquietly resigned himself to the fatal sacrifice amid all the deafening\r\nuproar occasioned by the Twelfth Army Corps, which was still marching\r\nalong in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to Maurice that if the forward march were resumed\r\nthe Seventh Corps would not pass through Le Ch\xc3\xaane, and he pictured\r\nhimself left behind, separated from his regiment as though he had\r\ndeserted. His foot no longer smarted, a skilful dressing, and a few\r\nhours of complete rest had calmed its feverishness. When Combette had\r\ngiven him a pair of shoes, broad shoes in which he was quite at his\r\nease, he became desirous of starting at once, hoping that he might\r\nstill meet the 106th on the Vouziers road. After vainly endeavouring\r\nto detain him, the chemist had half made up his mind to drive off with\r\nhim in his gig, and scour the roads in the chance hope of finding the\r\narmy corps, when Fernand, Combette\'s assistant, turned up and explained\r\nthat he had only absented himself to go and see after a cousin whom\r\nhe was in love with. It was this tall, pale fellow, with the look of\r\na poltroon, who then put the horse to the trap and drove off with\r\nMaurice. It was not yet five o\'clock; the rain was streaming like a\r\ndeluge from the inky sky, and the lamps of the vehicle were dimmed and\r\nbarely lighted the road, which ran through a vast drenched stretch of\r\ncountry full of tumultuous sounds that caused them to pull up at each\r\nhalf-mile, in the belief that an army was near at hand.\r\n\r\nMeantime Jean, in the camp before Vouziers, had not had a moment\'s\r\nsleep. Since Maurice had explained to him that the retreat would save\r\neverything he had been on the look-out, preventing his men from leaving\r\ntheir quarters, and awaiting the orders for raising the camp which the\r\nofficers might give at any moment. At about two o\'clock a great clatter\r\nof horses\' hoofs resounded amid the dense obscurity, which the camp\r\nfires dotted as with ruddy stars. This was an advance guard of cavalry\r\nsetting out towards Ballay and Quatre-Champs, for the purpose of\r\nwatching the Boult-aux-Bois and Croix-aux-Bois roads. An hour later the\r\ninfantry and the artillery set themselves in motion, abandoning those\r\npositions of Falaise and Chestres, which during two long days they had\r\nseemed so obstinately bent on defending against an enemy who never\r\ncame. The sky was overcast, and the night still deep, as each regiment\r\nretired in profound silence, like a procession of shadows flitting\r\naway into the darkness. Each heart, however, was beating joyously as\r\nthough they had, one and all, escaped some threatening ambush. They\r\nalready pictured themselves drawn up under the walls of Paris on the\r\neve of the _revanche_.\r\n\r\nJean looked around him through the dense night. The road was edged\r\nwith trees, and it seemed to him that it lay between large meadows.\r\nThen came rising ground and then declivities, and they were reaching\r\na village--no doubt Ballay--when a heavy cloud, darkening the sky,\r\nsuddenly burst, and the rain came down with violence. So much had\r\nalready fallen on the men, however, that they no longer complained,\r\nbut simply distended their shoulders. Ballay was speedily left behind;\r\nand, as they drew nearer to Quatre-Champs, furious squalls of wind\r\nswept through the widening valley. When they had passed Quatre-Champs,\r\nand had reached the vast plateau whose barren lands stretch as far as\r\nNoirval, the hurricane put forth all its strength, and they were lashed\r\nby a frightful deluge. And it was here that orders to halt stopped in\r\nturn every regiment.\r\n\r\nThe entire Seventh Corps, thirty and odd thousand men, had been\r\ngathered together here by the time the dawn arose, a dawn of a muddy\r\nhue seen through streaming grey water. What was up? Why were they\r\nhalting? Disquietude was already spreading through the ranks, and some\r\nasserted that the marching orders had just been changed. The men had\r\nreceived instructions to ground their arms, and were forbidden to break\r\nthe ranks and sit down. At certain moments the wind swept across the\r\nhigh table-land with such violence that they had to stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder to avoid being carried away. The icy rain was blinding them,\r\npelting their faces and streaming through their clothes. And two hours\r\nwent by, an interminable spell of waiting, the reason of which no one\r\nknew, though anguish was again oppressing every heart.\r\n\r\nAs the daylight gradually increased, Jean endeavoured to ascertain\r\nwhere they were. Some one had pointed out to him the road leading to\r\nLe Ch\xc3\xaane which climbed a hill to the north-west, on the other side of\r\nQuatre-Champs. Why had they not taken it? Why had they wheeled to the\r\nright instead of to the left? Then he became interested in the doings\r\nof the staff, which was installed at the farm of La Converserie at\r\nthe edge of the plateau. They all seemed very much upset there; the\r\nofficers were running about gesticulating and discussing together; and\r\nnothing came--what could they be waiting for? The plateau was a kind\r\nof arena covered with stubble, overlooked on the north and the east by\r\nwooded heights; with dense woods extending on the south, whilst through\r\nan opening on the west the valley of the Aisne could be perceived,\r\ntogether with the little white houses of Vouziers. Below La Converserie\r\nrose the slated steeple of Quatre-Champs, drenched by the raging\r\ndownpour, beneath which the few poor mossy roofs of the village seemed\r\nto be melting away. And as Jean\'s glance enfiladed the steep street he\r\nclearly distinguished a gig arriving at a fast trot, along the pebbly\r\nroadway now transformed into a torrent.\r\n\r\nIt was Maurice who, at a bend of the road, on the hill over yonder, had\r\nat last caught sight of the Seventh Corps. For a couple of hours he had\r\nbeen scouring the country, deceived by what a peasant had told him,\r\nand taken out of his way by the covert ill-will of the young fellow\r\ndriving him, who was in quite a fever of fear lest they should meet the\r\nPrussians. As soon as Maurice reached the farm he sprang out of the\r\nvehicle and immediately joined his regiment.\r\n\r\n\'What! you here!\' exclaimed Jean, quite stupefied. \'Why\'s that? We were\r\ngoing to call for you on the road.\'\r\n\r\nWith a gesture Maurice expressed all his anger and his grief. \'Ah, yes!\r\nBut the march is no longer that way; we are going over _there_ to find\r\nour graves.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' the corporal, turning quite pale, replied after an\r\ninterval of silence. \'At least we shall get our heads cracked together.\'\r\n\r\nAnd, as they had parted, so did they meet again with an embrace. Under\r\nthe beating downpour the private sought his place in the ranks, whilst\r\nthe corporal, streaming with rain-water, set an example of stoicism by\r\nabstaining from all complaint.\r\n\r\nThe news, however, was now spreading. The rumour had become a\r\ncertainty. They were no longer retreating upon Paris, but again\r\nmarching upon the Meuse. One of the marshal\'s aides-de-camp had just\r\nbrought the Seventh Corps orders to proceed to Nouart and encamp there,\r\nwhilst the Fifth, advancing on Beauclair, was to form the right wing\r\nof the army, and the First was to make for Le Ch\xc3\xaane, there to replace\r\nthe Twelfth, now marching on La Besace, on the left. And if thirty and\r\nodd thousand men had been waiting on that plateau with arms grounded\r\nfor nearly three hours and exposed to that furious hurricane, it was\r\nbecause General Douay, amid the lamentable confusion occasioned by this\r\nchange of front, experienced intense disquietude as to the fate of the\r\nconvoy which on the previous day he had sent forward to Chagny. It was\r\nnecessary to wait until it joined the corps, and it was reported that\r\nit had been cut in two at Le Ch\xc3\xaane by the Twelfth Corps\' convoy. On\r\nthe other hand, a portion of the _mat\xc3\xa9riel_--including all the field\r\nsmithies--having taken the wrong direction, was now returning from\r\nTerron by the road to Vouziers, where it would certainly fall into\r\nthe hands of the Germans. Never was there greater disorder, never was\r\nanxiety more keen.\r\n\r\nPerfect despair now displayed itself among the soldiers. Many of\r\nthem wished to sit down on their knapsacks in the mud of that soaked\r\nplateau, there to await death amid the rain. They jeered, and insulted\r\ntheir commanders: Fine commanders they were, with no brains, who undid\r\nin the evening what they had done in the morning, who dawdled when\r\nthe enemy was nowhere near, and skedaddled as soon as he appeared! A\r\nfinal attack of demoralisation was turning this army into a mere flock,\r\nwithout either faith, confidence, or discipline--a flock to be led\r\nto the slaughter according to the chances of the road. Over yonder,\r\ntowards Vouziers, a fusillade had just broken out--the rear-guard of\r\nthe Seventh Corps and the advance guard of the German troops were\r\nexchanging shots; and for a minute or two, moreover, all eyes had been\r\nturned towards the valley of the Aisne, where a mass of dense, black,\r\nwhirling smoke was rising against a clear patch of sky: the village of\r\nFalaise, fired by the Uhlans, was burning. Maurice and his comrades\r\nwere enraged. So the Prussians were there now. For two whole days had\r\nthe Seventh Corps waited to give them time to arrive, and now it was\r\ntaking to its heels. Bitter anger mounted to the brains even of those\r\nwhose capacity was most limited at the thought of the irreparable\r\nblunder that had been perpetrated, the idiotic delay at Vouziers, the\r\ntrap into which they had fallen; the reconnoitring parties of the\r\nfourth German army amusing Bordas\'s brigade, and immobilising in turn\r\nevery corps of the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons so as to allow the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia time to hasten to the spot with the Third Army. And at this\r\nmoment the enemy\'s forces were joining hands, thanks to the ignorance\r\nof the marshal, who as yet did not know what troops he had before him;\r\nand the Seventh and Fifth Corps were about to be harassed without\r\nrespite, threatened incessantly with a crowning disaster.\r\n\r\nMaurice gazed at Falaise whilst it continued burning on the horizon.\r\nJust then, however, some solace was afforded by the arrival of the\r\nconvoy, thought to be lost, but which was seen debouching from the\r\nroad to Le Ch\xc3\xaane. Thereupon, whilst the First Division remained at\r\nQuatre-Champs to escort and protect the interminable baggage-train,\r\nthe Second at once set out for Boult-aux-Bois through the forest,\r\nwhilst the Third took up position on the heights of Belleville on\r\nthe left, with the view of insuring communications. Just as the rain\r\nwas increasing in violence, the 106th at last quitted the plateau,\r\nresuming once more that criminal march towards the Meuse--towards the\r\nUnknown; and at that same moment Maurice, in his mind\'s eye, again\r\nsaw the Emperor\'s shadow flitting mournfully to and fro on old Madame\r\nDesroches\' little curtains. Ah! the army of the forlorn hope, the army\r\nsent to perdition, despatched to certain annihilation for the purpose\r\nof saving a dynasty. March, march, without glancing behind, under the\r\nrain and through the mud--march to extermination!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAN ARMY\'S CALVARY--CHASED BY THE FOE\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' exclaimed Chouteau, when he awoke on the following morning\r\nin the tent, feeling weary and icy cold; \'I\'d willingly accept some hot\r\nbroth with plenty of meat round it.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had encamped on the previous evening at Boult-aux-Bois, only\r\nsome scanty rations of potatoes had been distributed, the commissariat\r\nbecoming more and more bewildered and disorganised by the incessant\r\nmarching and counter-marching, and failing to meet the troops at any of\r\nthe appointed places. In the confusion prevailing on the roads, no one\r\nknew where to find those migratory droves of cattle intended for the\r\narmy, and famine seemed near at hand.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, dash it all!\' rejoined Loubet, with a sneer of desperation, as he\r\nstretched himself. \'But it\'s all over now. No more roast goose!\'\r\n\r\nThe squad was in a bad humour. Things were not lively when there was\r\nnothing to eat; and besides there was that incessant rain, and that mud\r\nin which they had been sleeping.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Pache was crossing himself, after saying his morning prayer\r\nwith closed lips, that infidel Chouteau furiously resumed: \'Why don\'t\r\nyou pray for a couple of sausages and a pint of wine for each of us?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! if we only had some bread even,\' sighed Lapoulle, who, with his\r\nexcessive appetite, suffered more hunger than the others.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lieutenant Rochas silenced them. They ought to be ashamed of\r\nthemselves, always thinking of their stomachs! For his part, when he\r\nfelt hungry he simply tightened his belt. Since affairs had been going\r\nfrom bad to worse, and a fusillade could occasionally be heard, the\r\nlieutenant had recovered all his stubborn confidence in victory. It was\r\nso simple now that the Prussians were there: the French would just give\r\nthem a licking. And he shrugged his shoulders behind Captain Beaudoin,\r\nthat whipper-snapper, as he called him, who, quite distracted by the\r\nloss of his baggage, was now always in a furious passion, with his\r\nlips set and his face extremely pale. Nothing to eat? A man could put\r\nup with that! What made the Captain so indignant was that he could not\r\nchange his shirt.\r\n\r\nMaurice awoke, depressed and shivering. Thanks to his broad shoes, his\r\nfoot had not again become inflamed; but the deluge of the previous day,\r\nwhich still made his great-coat very heavy, had again left him aching\r\nin every limb. When he was sent to fetch the water for the coffee he\r\ngazed for a moment over the plain at the edge of which Boult-aux-Bois\r\nis situated. Forests climb the hills on the west and the north, where\r\na ridge extends as far as Belleville; whilst a vast open expanse, amid\r\nthe gentle undulations of which various hamlets are hidden, stretches\r\ntowards Buzancy on the east. Was it from that side that the enemy was\r\nexpected? As he came back from the stream with his can full of water,\r\na family of weeping peasants, clustering on the threshold of a little\r\nfarmhouse, called him and asked him if the soldiers would stay there\r\nto defend them. Three times already, owing to contrary orders, had the\r\nFifth Army Corps crossed this part of the country. A cannonade in the\r\ndirection of Bar had been heard during the previous day, so that the\r\nPrussians could not now be more than a couple of leagues distant. When\r\nMaurice told these poor people that the Seventh Corps would in all\r\nprobability soon set out again, they began to bewail their lot. So\r\nthey were to be abandoned; so the soldiers did not come to fight, since\r\nthey simply saw them appear and disappear, invariably fleeing from the\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\n\'Those who want any sugar,\' said Loubet, when he served the coffee,\r\n\'must suck their thumbs.\'\r\n\r\nNobody laughed, however. It was, indeed, vexatious, not even to have\r\nany sugar for their coffee. And if they had only had a scrap of biscuit\r\nto eat! However, during that long halt on the plateau of Quatre-Champs\r\nthe day before, almost all of them, by way of passing the time, had\r\nnibbled the fragments, devoured even the crumbs remaining in their\r\nknapsacks. Fortunately, Jean\'s squad discovered that they possessed a\r\ndozen potatoes, and these were divided among the men.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! if I had only known, I would have bought some bread at Le Ch\xc3\xaane,\'\r\nregretfully said Maurice, whose stomach craved for food.\r\n\r\nJean sat there listening in silence. He had had a quarrel that morning\r\nwith Chouteau, who when ordered to fetch the firewood had insolently\r\nrefused to do so, saying that it was not his turn. Since affairs had\r\nbeen going from bad to worse, the indiscipline was increasing, until\r\nat last the officers dared not even reprimand their men. Jean, with\r\nhis admirable calmness, realised that he must sink his authority as\r\ncorporal, if he did not wish to provoke open mutiny. So he played the\r\npart of a good-natured fellow, appearing to be simply the comrade of\r\nhis men, to whom, thanks to his experience, he was able to render\r\nimportant services. If his squad was no longer so well fed as formerly,\r\nat all events it did not perish of hunger like others did. It was\r\nespecially Maurice\'s sufferings that touched Jean. He realised that\r\nthis delicate little fellow was getting very weak, and he watched him\r\nwith an uneasy eye, wondering how he would manage to keep up to the end.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard him complaining that he had no bread, he rose to his\r\nfeet, went off for a moment to rummage in his knapsack, and then, on\r\nreturning, slipped a biscuit into Maurice\'s hand.\r\n\r\n\'Take that and hide it,\' he whispered to him, \'I haven\'t enough for\r\neveryone.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how about yourself?\' asked the young fellow, deeply touched.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! never mind me. Besides, I still have a couple left.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a fact. Jean had been carefully preserving three biscuits in\r\ncase there should be any fighting, for he knew by experience that a\r\nman feels frightfully hungry on the battlefield. For the moment he had\r\neaten a potato, and that sufficed him. Later on, something else might\r\nturn up.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Corps was again set in motion at about ten o\'clock. The\r\nmarshal\'s original intention, no doubt, was to despatch it by way of\r\nBuzancy to Stenay, where it would have crossed the Meuse. But the\r\nPrussians, who were marching faster than the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons, must by\r\nthis time already be at Stenay; indeed, it was said, they were even at\r\nBuzancy. Driven in this way towards the north, the Seventh Corps had\r\nconsequently received orders to proceed to La Besace, some fourteen\r\nor fifteen miles from Boult-aux-Bois, with the view of reaching and\r\ncrossing the Meuse at Mouzon on the morrow. The start was a dreary one;\r\nthe men, with their stomachs almost empty and their limbs unrested,\r\nexhausted by the fatigue and waiting of the previous days, were audibly\r\ngrowling; and the gloomy officers, giving way to uneasiness at thought\r\nof the catastrophe to which they were marching, talked complainingly\r\nof their inaction, and were indignant that they had not been sent to\r\nBuzancy to support the Fifth Corps, whose guns had been heard there.\r\nThis corps must also be retreating--no doubt towards Nouart, whilst\r\nthe Twelfth, bound for Mouzon, was setting out from La Besace, and the\r\nFirst was taking the road to Raucourt.\r\n\r\nAll these masses of men now tramped along like so many flocks, urged on\r\nand worried by dogs, and hustling one another, as they at last advanced\r\ntowards the longed-for Meuse, after endless dawdling and delay.\r\n\r\nWhen the 106th started from Boult-aux-Bois, following the cavalry and\r\nartillery--the three divisions streaking the plain with a long stream\r\nof marching men--the sky again became covered with large, livid clouds,\r\nthe gloom of which put the finishing stroke to the men\'s sadness. For\r\na time the regiment followed the high road to Buzancy, which was edged\r\nwith superb poplars. At Germond, a village where heaps of manure were\r\nsmoking before the doors on either side of the road, the women sobbed,\r\nand taking their children in their arms, held them out to the passing\r\ntroops as though begging the latter to carry them away. Not a morsel of\r\nbread or a potato remained in the place. And now, instead of proceeding\r\nany farther in the direction of Buzancy, the 106th wheeled to the left\r\ntowards Authe; and when on a hill across the plain, the men again saw\r\nBelleville, through which they had marched the day before, they at once\r\nbecame conscious that they were retracing their steps.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' growled Chouteau; \'do they take us for spinning tops?\'\r\n\r\nAnd Loubet added, \'There are generals for you! Pulling first one way,\r\nthen another! One can easily see that they don\'t care a fig for our\r\nlegs.\'\r\n\r\nThey all became angry. It was too bad to weary men out in this fashion\r\nsimply for the purpose of promenading them up and down. They were\r\nnow marching across the barren plain in a column of two files, one\r\non either side of the road, the centre of which was reserved to the\r\nofficers; but no jokes were cracked, no songs were sung to enliven\r\nthe march as on the day when they had left Rheims--the day when they\r\ncarried their knapsacks so jauntily, their shoulders lightened by\r\nthe hope of outstripping the Prussians and beating them. Now they\r\nwere silent and irritated, and crawled along wearily, hating their\r\nguns, which made their shoulders sore, and their knapsacks, which\r\nweighed them down; no longer, moreover, having any confidence in their\r\ncommanders, but giving way to such despair that they were like cattle,\r\nwhich only fear of the goad can impel onward. The wretched army was now\r\nbeginning to ascend its Calvary.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes, however, something had greatly interested Maurice.\r\nHe had seen a horseman ride out of a little wood, far away on the left,\r\nwhere the ground rose in a succession of ridges of increasing height,\r\nparted by narrow valleys. Almost immediately afterwards a second\r\nhorseman appeared and then another. They all three remained there\r\nmotionless, looking no larger than the fist, like toys, sharply and\r\nprecisely outlined. Maurice thought they must belong to some outpost of\r\nHussars, or to some returning reconnoitring-party, but he was suddenly\r\nastonished to see some brilliant specks on their shoulders--the\r\nglitter, no doubt, of brass epaulettes.\r\n\r\n\'Look over there!\' he said, nudging Jean, who marched beside him; \'some\r\nUhlans!\'\r\n\r\nThe corporal opened his eyes wide: \'Uhlans? Those?\'\r\n\r\nIndeed they were Uhlans, the first Prussians that the 106th had seen.\r\nDuring the six weeks or so that the regiment had been campaigning, not\r\nonly had it not fired a shot, but it had not even obtained a glimpse\r\nof the enemy. Maurice\'s remark sped along the file, and every head was\r\nturned with growing curiosity. Those Uhlans looked fine fellows.\r\n\r\n\'One of them is precious fat,\' observed Loubet.\r\n\r\nHowever, an entire squadron suddenly showed itself on a plateau to the\r\nleft of the little wood; and at this threatening apparition the column\r\nwas halted. Orders arrived, and the 106th took up position behind some\r\ntrees, on the margin of a stream. The artillery was already galloping\r\nback and placing itself on a knoll. And then, for a couple of hours,\r\nthey lingered there in battle array without anything further occurring.\r\nThe party of hostile cavalry remained at the same spot on the horizon;\r\nand at last, realising that precious time was being lost, the French\r\nresumed their march.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! well,\' muttered Jean, regretfully; \'the fight won\'t be for to-day.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice also felt his hands burning with the desire to fire at least a\r\nshot. And he reflected on the blunder that had been made the previous\r\nday in not hurrying to the support of the Fifth Corps. If the Prussians\r\ndid not attack them it could only be because they had not as yet\r\nsufficient infantry at their disposal. Their cavalry demonstrations\r\ncould therefore have no other object than to delay the columns on the\r\nmarch. Once again, then, the French had fallen into the trap set for\r\nthem. And, indeed, from that time forward, the 106th incessantly beheld\r\nthe Uhlans at each rise of the ground on their left flank. The enemy\'s\r\nscouts followed the regiment and watched it, vanishing every now and\r\nagain behind some farm, and reappearing at the corner of a wood.\r\n\r\nBy degrees it harassed the troops to see themselves being thus\r\nenveloped from afar, as if in some invisible net. \'Those fellows are\r\nbecoming a confounded nuisance,\' repeated Pache, and even Lapoulle said\r\nthe same. \'It would ease one, dash it, to send them a few slugs.\'\r\n\r\nBut, with a heavy step that soon wearied them, the men continued\r\npainfully marching on. Just as one feels a storm brewing before it\r\nhas even shown itself on the horizon, so, in the general uneasiness,\r\none could feel the enemy approaching. Severe orders were given with\r\nreference to the rear-guard, and there were no more laggards, everyone\r\nnow being aware that the Prussians were following the corps, and would\r\npounce upon all stragglers. The German infantry was in fact arriving at\r\na lightning pace, marching its five-and-twenty miles a day, whilst the\r\nFrench regiments, harassed and paralysed, tramped and tramped over the\r\nsame ground.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Authe the sky cleared, and Maurice, to whom the sun\r\nserved as a guide, observed that instead of proceeding any farther\r\nin the direction of Le Ch\xc3\xaane--three long leagues away--they now went\r\nstraight towards the east. It was two in the afternoon, and after\r\nshivering for a couple of days under the rain the men now began to\r\nsuffer from the oppressive heat. The road wound with long bends across\r\nsome deserted plains. Not a house, not a living being was to be seen;\r\nonly a few little woods relieved the monotony of the barren expanse;\r\nand the mournful silence prevailing in this solitude infected the\r\nsweating soldiers, as with their heads drooping they wearily dragged\r\nthemselves along. At last they caught sight of St. Pierremont, a\r\ncluster of deserted houses on a monticle. They did not pass the\r\nvillage, however; indeed Maurice noticed that they wheeled at once\r\nto the left, taking a northerly direction towards La Besace. He now\r\nrealised what route had been selected for this attempt to reach Mouzon\r\nbefore the Prussians arrived there. But could they succeed in the\r\neffort, with troops so weary and so demoralised? This seemed the more\r\ndoubtful, as at St. Pierremont the three Uhlans again appeared in the\r\ndistance at the bend of a road coming from Buzancy; and, moreover, just\r\nas the French rear-guard was leaving the village a hostile battery was\r\nunmasked, and a few shells fell, without, however, doing any harm.\r\nThe French did not answer the fire, but continued their march with\r\nincreasing difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are three long leagues from St. Pierremont to La Besace, and\r\nJean, on learning this from Maurice, made a gesture of despair. The men\r\ncould never go that distance; he could tell that by sure and certain\r\nsigns--their hard breathing, and the wild look on their faces. The road\r\nmoreover was a steep one, running between two ridges, which gradually\r\ndrew nearer to one another. At last a halt became necessary; but,\r\nunfortunately, this rest increased the stiffness of the men\'s limbs,\r\nand when orders were given to start again matters became even worse\r\nthan before. The regiments no longer made way, and many men fell to the\r\nground. Jean, who noticed that Maurice was growing pale, with his eyes\r\ndimmed by weariness, began talking, contrary to his wont, hoping that\r\nby a flow of words he would manage to divert the young fellow, and keep\r\nhim awake amid the mechanical tramp, tramp of the march, of which the\r\nmen had now ceased to have any mental perception.\r\n\r\n\'So your sister lives at Sedan,\' said Jean; \'perhaps we shall pass that\r\nway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Through Sedan? Never, that\'s not our road; they would be madmen to\r\ntake us there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is your sister young?\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s as old as I am. I told you we were twins.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is she like you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she\'s fair like me, but with such soft, curly hair. She\'s very\r\nslight, with a thin face, and so quiet. Ah! my poor Henriette.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are very fond of one another?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes--yes.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and Jean, on looking at Maurice, saw that his\r\neyes were closing and that he was about to fall. \'Hullo, my poor\r\nyoungster--hold yourself up. Good heavens! Give me your popgun a\r\nmoment; that will ease you. It certainly isn\'t possible to go any\r\nfarther to-day; if we do, we shall leave half the men on the road.\' He\r\nhad just caught sight of Oches, with its few houses climbing a hill\r\nahead of them. The yellow church, perched aloft, overlooks the other\r\nbuildings from amidst the trees.\r\n\r\n\'Sure enough we shall have to sleep here,\' added Jean.\r\n\r\nHe had guessed correctly. Noticing the extreme weariness of his men,\r\nGeneral Douay despaired of reaching La Besace that day. He was,\r\nhowever, more particularly induced to halt by the arrival of the\r\nconvoy--that worrying convoy which he had been dragging about with him\r\nsince leaving Rheims and whose three leagues of vehicles and horses\r\nhad so repeatedly delayed his march. Whilst at Quatre-Champs, he had\r\ndespatched this interminable train direct to St. Pierremont, but it was\r\nonly at Oches that it again joined the corps, and with the horses so\r\nexhausted that they could no longer be prevailed upon to move. It was\r\nnow already five o\'clock, and the general, fearing to enter the defile\r\nof Stonne at that hour, decided that he must renounce accomplishing the\r\ndistance prescribed by the marshal. The men halted and began to encamp,\r\nthe convoy being drawn up in the meadows below, where it was protected\r\nby one of the divisions; whilst the artillery established itself on the\r\nslopes behind, and the brigade which was to serve as the rear-guard\r\non the morrow remained upon a height facing St. Pierremont. Another\r\ndivision, of which General Bourgain-Desfeuilles\' brigade formed part,\r\nbivouacked behind the church on a broad plateau, edged by a wood of oak\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWhen the 106th was at last able to encamp on the outskirts of this\r\nwood, night was already coming on, so much confusion had there been in\r\nselecting and apportioning the various sites.\r\n\r\n\'Curse it!\' said Chouteau, furiously; \'I sha\'n\'t eat. I shall sleep!\'\r\n\r\nIndeed, this was the general cry. Many of the men had not enough\r\nstrength left them to pitch their tents, but went to sleep wherever\r\nthey fell. Besides, in order to sup, they needed the presence of the\r\ncommissariat; and the commissariat, which was expecting the Seventh\r\nCorps at La Besace, was not at Oches. Such, too, were the disorder\r\nand laxity that there were no longer any bugle calls to rations, nor\r\nfrom this time forward, indeed, were any rations distributed. It was\r\na case of everyone for himself; the soldiers having to subsist on the\r\nsupplies which they were supposed to have in their knapsacks. But the\r\nlatter were empty; few indeed were the men who found a crust in them,\r\nsome chance crumbs of the plenty in which they had momentarily lived at\r\nVouziers. There was, however, some coffee, and the less weary of the\r\ntroops again drank coffee without sugar.\r\n\r\nWhen Jean, desirous of sharing his two remaining biscuits with Maurice,\r\ncame up to the young fellow, he found him sound asleep. For a moment he\r\nthought of rousing him, but decided not to do so; and then, like the\r\nstoic he was, he again hid both biscuits in his knapsack, as carefully\r\nas though he were concealing gold, and contented himself with some\r\ncoffee like his comrades. He had insisted upon having the tent pitched,\r\nand they were already lying down inside it when Loubet, who had been\r\non the prowl, came back with some carrots which he had pulled up in a\r\nneighbouring field. It was impossible to cook them, so they were eaten\r\nraw; but they only irritated the men\'s hunger, and made Pache quite ill.\r\n\r\n\'No, no, let him sleep,\' said Jean to Chouteau, when the latter began\r\nshaking Maurice to give him his share.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' remarked Lapoulle, \'we shall have some bread to-morrow when we\r\nget to Angoul\xc3\xaame--I\'ve a cousin who\'s in garrison at Angoul\xc3\xaame--a\r\ncapital place!\'\r\n\r\nThe others were amazed (as well they might be, for it was as if an\r\nEnglish soldier marching through the Highlands had expressed the belief\r\nthat they would reach Bristol on the morrow), and Chouteau exclaimed:\r\n\'Angoul\xc3\xaame! what do you mean? What a fool you must be to think you\'re\r\ngoing to Angoul\xc3\xaame!\'\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, however, to extract any explanation from Lapoulle,\r\nthough he adhered to his opinion that they were marching to Angoul\xc3\xaame.\r\nThat same morning, by the way, on seeing the Uhlans, he had maintained\r\nthat they were some of Bazaine\'s soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen the camp fell into a death-like silence in the inky night. Chilly\r\nthough it was, no fires were allowed to be lighted. It was known that\r\nthe Prussians were only a few miles away, and as little noise as\r\npossible was made for fear of attracting their attention. The officers\r\nhad already warned their men that the march would be resumed at four\r\no\'clock, with the view of making up for lost time, and weary as they\r\nwere they all hastily and gluttonously gave themselves up to sleep.\r\nThe loud breathing of those masses of men ascended into the darkness\r\nabove the dispersed encampments, as though it were the breathing of the\r\nvery earth.\r\n\r\nAll at once the squad was awakened by the report of a firearm. The\r\nnight was still dense, it could scarcely be three o\'clock. In a\r\nmoment they were all on foot, and the alert passed through the camp,\r\neveryone believing that the enemy was attacking them. But it was only\r\nthat hungry fellow Loubet, who, having woke up, had plunged into the\r\nneighbouring wood in the idea that there must be some rabbits there.\r\nWhat a feast they would have if, at the first gleam of light, he could\r\nbring a couple of rabbits back to his comrades! But whilst he was\r\nseeking a good spot to post himself, he heard some men coming towards\r\nhim, talking together and breaking the branches, and thereupon he had\r\nfired in dismay, thinking that he had to deal with some Prussians.\r\nMaurice, Jean, and others were already reaching the spot, when a gruff\r\nvoice shouted, \'In God\'s name don\'t shoot!\'\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the wood they then perceived a tall, thin man, whose\r\nthick bushy beard could be but imperfectly distinguished. He wore a\r\ngrey blouse, tightened at the waist by a red sash; and carried a gun\r\nslung over his shoulder. He at once explained that he was a Frenchman,\r\na sergeant of Francs-tireurs, and that he had come from the woods of\r\nDieulet with a couple of his men to give the general some information.\r\n\'Here, Cabasse! Ducat!\' he shouted, turning round, \'here, you drones,\r\nmake haste!\'\r\n\r\nThe two men had doubtless felt frightened. However, they now\r\napproached. Ducat was short, pale, and fat, with scanty hair; and\r\nCabasse, tall and bony, with a dark face and a long nose like a\r\nknife-blade. Meantime Maurice, who had been scrutinising the sergeant\r\nwith surprise, ended by asking him, \'Aren\'t you Guillaume Sambuc, of\r\nRemilly?\'\r\n\r\nAnd when the sergeant, looking rather alarmed, had with some hesitation\r\nanswered affirmatively, the young fellow instinctively fell back, for\r\nthis man, Sambuc, had the reputation of being a terrible rogue, the\r\ntrue scion of a family of woodcutters, who had turned out very badly.\r\nThe father, a drunkard, had been found one evening on the verge of a\r\nwood, with his throat cut; the mother and daughter, both thieves and\r\nbeggars, had disappeared, but were doubtless leading a shameful life.\r\nGuillaume, the Franc-tireur, had been a smuggler and poacher in time of\r\npeace; and only one of this family of wolves had grown into an honest\r\nman--Prosper, the Chasseur d\'Afrique, who, before becoming a soldier,\r\nhad hired himself out as a farm hand in his hatred of forest life.\r\n\r\n\'I saw your brother at Rheims and Vouziers,\' resumed Maurice. \'He was\r\nall right.\'\r\n\r\nSambuc made no answer to this, but to hasten matters exclaimed: \'Take\r\nme to the general. Tell him that some Francs-tireurs of the Dieulet\r\nwoods have something important to communicate to him.\'\r\n\r\nWhile they were returning to the camp Maurice began thinking of these\r\nFrancs-tireurs, these free companies on whom so many hopes had been\r\nfounded, but who were already, on all sides, giving so much cause for\r\ncomplaint. It had been expected that they would carry on a war of\r\nambushes, await the enemy behind the hedges, harass him, shoot down his\r\nsentries, and hold the woods so that, not a Prussian would ever leave\r\nthem alive. But, to tell the truth, they were becoming the terror of\r\nthe peasants, whom they defended inefficiently, and whose fields they\r\nlaid waste. In their hatred of the regular military service, all the\r\nwaifs and strays of society hastened to join these corps, delighted to\r\nescape discipline and to roam the country like merry bandits, sleeping\r\nand tippling wheresoever chance led them. Some of these companies were\r\nindeed composed of really execrable elements.\r\n\r\n\'Here, Cabasse! Here, Ducat!\' repeated Sambuc, turning round at each\r\nstep he took; \'make haste, you laggards!\'\r\n\r\nMaurice instinctively divined that both these men must be terrible\r\nrascals. Cabasse, the tall, bony fellow, had been born at Toulon, and\r\nafter serving as a waiter in a caf\xc3\xa9 at Marseilles, had turned up at\r\nSedan as commission agent for a firm of the South of France. He had\r\nnarrowly escaped the clutches of the law in connection with some story\r\nof theft, the real facts of which were not known. Ducat, his short,\r\nfat comrade, had been a process-server at Blainville, but had been\r\ncompelled to sell his office owing to his scandalous immorality, which,\r\nsince he had been book-keeper at a factory at Raucourt, had again\r\nalmost brought him into the dock at the assize court. Ducat indulged in\r\nLatin quotations, whereas Cabasse was scarcely able to read; but the\r\none completed the other, and they formed together a pair of equivocal\r\nscoundrels, well calculated to inspire alarm.\r\n\r\nThe camp was already awakening, and Jean and Maurice conducted\r\nthe Francs-tireurs to Captain Beaudoin, who took them to Colonel\r\nde Vineuil. The latter began to question them, but Sambuc,\r\nconscious of his importance, was absolutely bent on speaking to the\r\ngeneral. In a bad humour at having to rise in the middle of the\r\nnight, with another day of famine and fatigue before him, General\r\nBourgain-Desfeuilles--who, having slept at the priest\'s, had just\r\nappeared on the parsonage threshold--received the three men in a\r\nfurious fashion.\r\n\r\n\'Where have they come from? What do they want? Ah! so it\'s you,\r\nFrancs-tireurs? Some more laggards, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'We are holding the woods of Dieulet with our comrades, general,\'\r\nreplied Sambuc, in no wise disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\'The woods of Dieulet! where are they?\'\r\n\r\n\'Between Stenay and Mouzon, general.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stenay, Mouzon. I don\'t know them. How can I understand anything with\r\nall these new names?\'\r\n\r\nColonel de Vineuil felt uncomfortable on hearing this, and discreetly\r\nintervened to remind the general that Stenay and Mouzon were on the\r\nMeuse, and that the Germans, having occupied the former locality, were\r\nabout to attempt the passage of the river by the bridge at the latter\r\ntown, which lay more to the north.\r\n\r\n\'Well, general,\' resumed Sambuc, \'we came to warn you that the Dieulet\r\nwoods are now full of Prussians. When the Fifth Corps was leaving\r\nBois-les-Dames yesterday there was an engagement near Nouart.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! was there fighting yesterday?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, general; the Fifth Corps fought while it was falling back, and\r\nto-night it must be at Beaumont. So while some of our comrades went to\r\ninform it of the enemy\'s movements, it occurred to us to come and tell\r\nyou of the situation, so that you may support the Fifth Corps, for it\r\nwill have quite sixty thousand men to deal with in the morning.\'\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\'Sixty thousand men! How you talk! Why not a hundred thousand? You must\r\nbe dreaming, my fine fellow. Fear makes you see double. There can\'t be\r\nsixty thousand men near us--we should know it.\'\r\n\r\nTo this opinion he obstinately clung, and it was in vain that Sambuc\r\nappealed to the testimony of Ducat and Cabasse.\r\n\r\n\'We saw the guns,\' so the Proven\xc3\xa7al asserted, \'and those devils must be\r\nmadmen to risk sending them along the forest roads, in which one sinks\r\nto the shins on account of the late rain.\'\r\n\r\n\'Somebody is guiding them, that\'s certain,\' declared the\r\nex-process-server, in his turn.\r\n\r\nSince their experiences at Vouziers, however, the general no longer\r\nbelieved in the reported concentration of the two German armies, which\r\nhad been dinned into his ears, he said, till he was sick and tired\r\nof it. And he did not even consider it worth his while to send the\r\nFrancs-tireurs to the commander of the Seventh Corps, to whom, by the\r\nway, the men thought they were speaking. If one had listened to all the\r\npeasants and prowlers who came with so-called information, the army\r\nwould no longer have taken a step without being turned to right or\r\nleft, and launched into unheard-of adventures. However, as the three\r\nFrancs-tireurs knew the country, the general ordered them to remain and\r\naccompany the column.\r\n\r\n\'All the same,\' said Jean to Maurice as they were returning to the camp\r\nto fold up their tent; \'all the same, those are good fellows to have\r\ncome four leagues across country to warn us.\'\r\n\r\nThe young man assented; he considered that the Francs-tireurs were in\r\nthe right. He also knew the country, and felt extremely uneasy at the\r\nthought that the Prussians were in the Dieulet woods advancing upon\r\nSommauthe and Beaumont. In the dawn of what he instinctively felt would\r\nbe a terrible day, he had seated himself on the ground, weary already,\r\nalthough they had not yet started on the march; but his stomach was\r\nempty, and his heart oppressed with anguish.\r\n\r\nWorried to see him look so pale, the corporal, in a fatherly way,\r\ninquired: \'Still queer, eh? Is it your foot again?\'\r\n\r\nMaurice shook his head. Thanks to the broad shoes he was now wearing,\r\nhis foot was very much better.\r\n\r\n\'You are hungry, then?\' And, as he did not reply, Jean, without being\r\nobserved, took one of the two remaining biscuits out of his knapsack,\r\nand then, frankly lying, said, \'There, I kept your share for you. I ate\r\nthe other one just now.\'\r\n\r\nThe dawn was breaking when the Seventh Corps left Oches, on the way to\r\nMouzon, through La Besace, where it ought to have slept. First of all,\r\nthe terrible convoy had gone off escorted by the First Division, and\r\nwhilst the train waggons, drawn by capital horses, set out at a good\r\npace, the vehicles that had been requisitioned, empty for the most part\r\nand useless, dawdled in the strangest way between the ridges of the\r\ndefile of Stonne. The road rises--more particularly after passing the\r\nhamlet of La Berli\xc3\xa8re--between wooded hills which overlook it. At about\r\neight o\'clock, just as the two other divisions were at last setting\r\nout, Marshal MacMahon made his appearance, and was exasperated at still\r\nfinding there the troops, whom he fancied would have left La Besace\r\nat dawn with only a few miles to cover in order to reach Mouzon. And,\r\nnot unnaturally, he had a lively altercation with General Douay. It\r\nwas decided that the First Division and the convoy should be allowed\r\nto continue their march on Mouzon, but that the other division should\r\ntake the road to Raucourt and Autrecourt, so as to pass the Meuse at\r\nVillers, by which plan they would no longer be retarded by that heavy,\r\nslow-travelling advance-guard. Once more, then, they had to take a\r\nnortherly direction, so eager was the marshal in his desire to place\r\nthe Meuse between his army and the enemy. They must, at any cost, be on\r\nthe right bank of the river that evening. Yet the rear-guard was still\r\nat Oches, when a Prussian battery on a distant summit, in the direction\r\nof St. Pierremont, again began the game of the day before, and fired.\r\nAt first the French unwisely returned the fire, but eventually the last\r\ntroops fell back.\r\n\r\nUntil eleven o\'clock or so the 106th continued slowly following the\r\nroad which winds, between lofty rounded hills, through the depths of\r\nthe defile of Stonne. Precipitous bare crests rise up on the left, but\r\nthe slopes descending from the woods on the right are less abrupt. The\r\nsun was now shining again, and it was very hot in that narrow valley,\r\nthe solitude of which was quite oppressive. After passing La Berli\xc3\xa8re,\r\nwhich is overlooked by a lofty, dreary calvary, there was not a farm,\r\nnot a human being, not even a cow grazing in the meadows. And the men,\r\nso weary and so hungry already the previous day, who had scarcely slept\r\nand had eaten nothing, were even at this stage lapsing into a crawl,\r\ndispirited and full of covert rage.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, as they were halted at the edge of the road, the\r\ncannon thundered out on the right. The reports were so precise and\r\nso loud that the fighting could not be more than a couple of leagues\r\naway. The effect which the sound had upon these men, so wearied by\r\nretreating, so enervated by waiting, was extraordinary. They all stood\r\nthere erect and quivering, forgetting their fatigue. Why did they not\r\nmarch? They wished to fight, to get their skulls cracked, anything\r\nrather than to continue fleeing as they were doing, without knowing\r\nwhither or why.\r\n\r\nTaking Colonel de Vineuil with him, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles\r\nhad just ascended one of the hills on the right, with a view of\r\nreconnoitring the country. They could both be seen levelling their\r\nfield-glasses up there, between two little woods; and they at once\r\ndespatched an aide-de-camp, who accompanied them, with orders to send\r\nthem the Francs-tireurs, if the latter were still with the troops. A\r\nfew of the men, Jean, Maurice, and others, accompanied Sambuc and his\r\ncomrades, to be in attendance in case of need.\r\n\r\n\'What a cursed country this is, with these everlasting hills and\r\nwoods!\' exclaimed the general, as soon as he perceived Sambuc. \'You\r\nhear that? Where is it? Where are they fighting?\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Sambuc, to whom Ducat and Cabasse stuck like leeches,\r\nlistened and scanned the wide-spread horizon, without replying. Near\r\nhim was Maurice, gazing at the same scene, wonderstruck at sight of the\r\nimmense rolling expanse of vales and woods. It was like an endless sea\r\nof huge, slowly rising waves. The forests blotched the yellow soil with\r\ndark green, and under the fierce sun the distant hills were bathed in a\r\nruddy vapour. Although one could see nothing, not even a little smoke\r\nagainst the background of clear sky, the cannon continued thundering,\r\nwith the din of a distant storm increasing in violence.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s Sommauthe on the right,\' said Sambuc, at last, pointing to\r\na high summit crowned with foliage. \'Yoncq is there on the left--the\r\nfighting is at Beaumont, general.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, at Varnifor\xc3\xaat or at Beaumont,\' corroborated Ducat.\r\n\r\n\'Beaumont, Beaumont,\' muttered the general; \'one never knows in this\r\ncursed country----\' Then he added aloud, \'And how far away is this\r\nplace, Beaumont?\'\r\n\r\n\'About six miles, by taking the road from Le Ch\xc3\xaane to Stenay, which\r\nruns past over yonder.\'\r\n\r\nThe cannonade did not cease, but seemed to be advancing from west\r\nto east like a continuous roll of thunder. \'The devil! it\'s getting\r\nhotter,\' added Sambuc. \'I expected it. I warned you this morning,\r\ngeneral. Those are certainly the batteries we saw in the Dieulet woods.\r\nAt the present time the Fifth Corps must have to contend against all\r\nthat army which was coming up by Buzancy and Beauclair.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, whilst the battle roared louder and louder afar off.\r\nMaurice had to set his teeth to restrain his furious desire to cry out.\r\nWhy did they lose time in talk, why did they not at once march towards\r\nthose guns? Never before had he experienced such excitement. Each\r\nreport re-echoed in his breast, raised him from the ground, inspired\r\nhim with a longing to rush to the battlefield, join in the fray, and at\r\nonce bring matters to an issue. Were they going to skirt that battle\r\nlike the others; elbow it, as it were, without firing even a shot? Was\r\nthere a wager on, that ever since the declaration of war they had been\r\ndragged about like this, invariably fleeing from the foe? At Vouziers\r\nthey had only heard the shots fired by the rear-guard. At Oches the\r\nenemy had merely cannonaded them in the rear for a few minutes. And\r\nnow were they going to scamper away, instead of hurrying to support\r\ntheir comrades at the double quick? Maurice looked at Jean, who, like\r\nhimself, was very pale, with his eyes glittering feverishly. Every\r\nheart bounded in response to the vehement call of the cannon.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was another spell of waiting. A number of staff officers\r\nwere climbing the narrow pathway up the hill. It was General Douay\r\nhastening to the spot with an anxious face, and when he, himself, had\r\nquestioned the Francs-tireurs, a cry of despair escaped him. But even\r\nif he had been warned in the morning, what could he have done? The\r\nmarshal\'s orders were peremptory; they were to cross the Meuse before\r\nevening, no matter at what cost. And now, how could he collect together\r\nhis columns \xc3\xa9cheloned along the road to Raucourt so as to throw them\r\nrapidly upon Beaumont? Would they not certainly arrive too late? The\r\nFifth Corps must already be retreating in the direction of Mouzon; as,\r\nindeed the cannonade clearly indicated, for it was travelling farther\r\nand farther towards the east, like a hurricane of hail and disaster\r\npassing along into the distance. With a gesture of fury at the thought\r\nthat he was so powerless, General Douay raised both his arms above the\r\nvast horizon of hills and vales, fields and forests; and then angrily\r\ngave orders to continue marching upon Raucourt.\r\n\r\nOh! that march in the depths of the defile of Stonne, between the\r\nhigh crests, whilst the guns continued thundering behind the woods on\r\nthe right! At the head of the 106th rode Colonel de Vineuil, stiffly\r\nbestriding his horse, with his pale head erect and his eyelids beating\r\nas if to restrain his tears. Captain Beaudoin was biting his moustache\r\nin silence, whilst Lieutenant Rochas could not refrain from muttering\r\nblasphemous words, insulting everybody, himself included. And even\r\namong the soldiers who were not desirous of fighting, among those who\r\nwere the least brave, there ascended a desire to shout and strike,\r\nthe anger born of the perpetual defeat, the rage they felt that they\r\nshould still have to fall back with heavy uncertain steps, whilst those\r\naccursed Prussians were slaughtering their comrades yonder!\r\n\r\nBelow Stonne, whence a narrow road winds down through the hills, the\r\nhighway became broader, and the troops passed beside large fields,\r\nintersected by little woods. Since leaving Oches the 106th, which\r\nnow found itself in the rear-guard, had, at every moment, been in\r\nexpectation of an attack; for the enemy was now following the column\r\nstep by step, observing its movements, and doubtless watching for a\r\nfavourable moment to fall upon its rear. Hostile cavalry, profiting\r\nby the undulatory character of the country, was already trying to\r\ngain upon the army\'s flanks. Several squadrons of the Prussian Guard\r\nwere at last seen debouching from behind a wood, but halted at sight\r\nof a regiment of Hussars, which advanced, sweeping the road. And,\r\nthanks to this respite, the retreat continued in fairly good order,\r\nand the men were approaching Raucourt, when they beheld a sight which\r\nincreased their anguish and completed their demoralisation. All at\r\nonce, by a cross road, they caught sight of a precipitate rout coming\r\ntowards them--wounded officers, disbanded and unarmed soldiers,\r\ngalloping train-waggons, men and horses all fleeing, distracted,\r\nbeneath a hurricane of disaster! These were the remnants of a brigade\r\nof the First Division which had escorted the convoy sent off in the\r\nmorning to Mouzon by way of La Besace. A mistake in the road, a\r\nfrightful mischance, had brought this brigade and a part of the convoy\r\nto Varnifor\xc3\xaat, near Beaumont, at the moment of the complete rout of\r\nthe Fifth Corps. Surprised, suddenly subjected to a flank attack,\r\nsuccumbing beneath superior numbers, the men had fled, and panic was\r\nbringing them back, bleeding, haggard, and half mad, distracting\r\ntheir comrades with their terror. The stories they told spread fear\r\naround them; they seemed to have come on the wings of that thunderous\r\ncannonade which since noon had been heard without cessation.\r\n\r\nThen, in passing through Raucourt there was desperate hustling and\r\nanxiety. Ought they to turn to the right, towards Autrecourt, in view\r\nof crossing the Meuse at Villers, as had been decided? Perplexed and\r\nhesitating, General Douay feared that he might find the bridge there\r\nblocked with retreating troops, perhaps even already in the power of\r\nthe Prussians. He preferred, therefore, to continue straight on through\r\nthe defile of Haraucourt, so as to reach Remilly before night. Again\r\nhad their destination been changed; after Mouzon, Villers, and after\r\nVillers, Remilly. They were still marching due north, with the Uhlans\r\ngalloping behind them. They had now less than four miles to go, but it\r\nwas already five o\'clock, and they were overwhelmingly fatigued. They\r\nhad been on foot since daybreak, and had taken twelve hours to cover\r\nscarcely three leagues, tramping along, wearing themselves out with\r\nendless halts, amid the liveliest emotions and fears. Moreover, during\r\nthe last two nights they had barely slept, and since leaving Vouziers\r\nthey had not been able to satisfy their hunger. They were sinking with\r\ninanition. At Raucourt the scene was pitiable.\r\n\r\nRaucourt is a well-to-do little town, with its numerous factories, its\r\nwell-built high street which the road follows, its coquettish-looking\r\nchurch and town-hall. Only, all its resources had been exhausted;\r\nthe bakers\' and grocers\' shops had been emptied, even the crumbs in\r\nthe private houses had been swept away--first during the night that\r\nthe Emperor and Marshal MacMahon had spent there, when the town was\r\nburdened with the staff and the imperial household, and then when the\r\nwhole of the First Corps passed through it on the following morning,\r\nstreaming along the highway like a river. Now there was no bread\r\nleft there, no more wine, no more sugar, nothing that can be eaten,\r\nnothing that can be drunk--excepting water. Ladies had been seen\r\nstanding at their doors, distributing glasses of wine and cups of\r\nbroth, draining alike their casks and their saucepans to the dregs.\r\nAnd thus everything had gone, and great was the despair when, at\r\nabout three o\'clock, the first regiments of the Seventh Corps began\r\ndefiling along the high street. What! So it was beginning again! There\r\nwere still more soldiers! Once more, indeed, the high street became\r\na river of exhausted men--men covered with dust and dying of hunger,\r\nwithout anybody having a morsel of anything to give to them. Many of\r\nthe soldiers halted, knocked at the doors, held out their hands towards\r\nthe windows, begging that a crust of bread might be thrown to them. And\r\nthere were women who sobbed, and who signed to the soldiers that they\r\ncould give them nothing, since they had nothing whatever left.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of a street called the Rue des Dix-Potiers Maurice\'s eyes\r\nbegan to swim, and he staggered. Jean hastened to assist him, but,\r\nsinking on a corner-stone, he murmured: \'No, leave me; this is the\r\nend--I prefer to die here!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' exclaimed the corporal, affecting the stern mien of a\r\ndiscontented superior, \'who\'s given me such a soldier as you? Do you\r\nwant to be picked up by the Prussians? Make haste--up, and march!\'\r\n\r\nThe young fellow did not reply; his face was livid, his eyes were\r\nclosed, and he had half fainted away. On seeing this, Jean swore\r\nagain, but in a tone of infinite pity: \'My God! My God!\' And hastening\r\nto a fountain near by, he filled his tin bowl with water, with which\r\nhe began to bathe his comrade\'s face. Then, this time without any\r\nconcealment, he drew from his knapsack that last biscuit which he had\r\nso carefully preserved, and broke it into little morsels which he\r\nplaced between Maurice\'s teeth. The famished man opened his eyes and\r\nbegan to devour.\r\n\r\n\'But you?\' he suddenly asked, his memory returning to him. \'Didn\'t you\r\neat then?\'\r\n\r\n\'I?\' said Jean. \'Oh, I\'m tougher than you. I can wait. A drop of Adam\'s\r\nale, and I\'m on my legs again.\'\r\n\r\nHe again went to the fountain to fill his bowl, which he emptied at a\r\ndraught, clacking his tongue. _His_ face, however, was also ashy pale,\r\nand he felt so famished that his hands trembled.\r\n\r\n\'Make haste and let\'s get off,\' he said to Maurice. \'We must join the\r\ncomrades, youngster.\'\r\n\r\nLeaning heavily on Jean\'s arm, Maurice then allowed himself to be\r\nled away. Never had woman\'s arm brought such warmth as this to his\r\nheart. Now that everything was crumbling to the ground, amid this\r\nextreme misery, with death threatening him, he experienced a delicious\r\nsensation of comfort, on realising that there was yet one who loved\r\nhim and succoured him; and perhaps also the idea that this heart which\r\nwas wholly his was the heart of a man of simple mind, of a peasant but\r\nslightly removed from the soil, and who had once been so repugnant to\r\nhim, now added an infinite sweetness to his feelings of gratitude.\r\nWas not this the fraternity of the earliest days of the world, the\r\nfriendship that existed long before there was any culture, before there\r\nwere any classes; the friendship of two men, linked together, bound\r\nup in one another in their mutual need of assistance, threatened as\r\nthey were by inimical nature? He could hear his humanity beating in\r\nJean\'s breast, and he even felt proud that his comrade was stronger\r\nthan himself, that he succoured him and devoted himself to him; whilst\r\nJean, on the other hand, without analysing his sensations, experienced\r\na feeling of delight in shielding his young friend\'s refinement and\r\nintelligence--qualities that in himself had remained in a rudimentary\r\nstate. Since the violent death of his wife, carried off in a fearful\r\ntragedy, he had thought himself without a heart, and he had sworn that\r\nhe would have nothing more to do with those creatures who bring man so\r\nmuch suffering, even when their natures are not evil. And the mutual\r\nfriendship of Jean and Maurice became to both of them, as it were,\r\nan expansion of their beings; they did not embrace, and yet, however\r\ndissimilar their natures, they were none the less closely united, so\r\nbound up in one another, as they tramped along that terrible road to\r\nRemilly, the one supporting the other, that they seemed to form but one\r\nbeing compounded of pity and suffering.\r\n\r\nWhilst the rear-guard was leaving Raucourt, the Germans entered\r\nthe town at the other end; and two of their batteries which were\r\nimmediately planted on the heights, upon the left, commenced firing.\r\nAt this moment, as the 106th was moving off by the downhill-road,\r\nskirting the Emmane, it found itself in the line of fire. One shell cut\r\ndown a poplar on the river bank, and another buried itself in a meadow\r\nnear Captain Beaudoin. Until reaching Haraucourt the defile gradually\r\ncontracts, and one there plunges into a narrow passage, overlooked\r\non either hand by crested hills covered with trees. If a handful of\r\nPrussians were in ambuscade there, a disaster was certain. Cannonaded\r\nin the rear, with an attack possible both on right and left, the troops\r\nnow advanced in increasing anxiety, eager to get out of this dangerous\r\npass. And thus a last flash of energy came to even the weariest among\r\nthem. The men, who a little while ago had been crawling from door to\r\ndoor through Raucourt, now stepped out jauntily, revived by the spur of\r\nperil. Even the horses seemed to realise that a terrible price might\r\nhave to be paid for a moment lost; and the head of the column must\r\nhave already been at Remilly, and the impetus given to the retreat was\r\ncontinuing, when all at once the men again ceased to advance.\r\n\r\n\'Dash it!\' said Chouteau, \'are they going to leave us here?\'\r\n\r\nThe 106th had not yet reached Haraucourt and the shells were still\r\nfalling. Whilst the regiment was marking time pending the resumption\r\nof the march, a shell burst on the right, fortunately without wounding\r\nanyone. Five minutes elapsed, seeming frightfully long, an eternity.\r\nBut the men could not move; there was some obstacle over yonder,\r\nbarring the road like a wall suddenly thrown up. The colonel, rising\r\nin his stirrups, looked ahead, quivering, and feeling that panic was\r\nspreading among his men behind him.\r\n\r\n\'Everyone knows that we\'ve been sold!\' resumed Chouteau, vehemently.\r\n\r\nThen, under the lash of fear, loud murmurs arose, a swelling growl of\r\nexasperation. Yes, yes; they had been brought there to be sold, to be\r\nhanded over to the Prussians!\r\n\r\nEvil fortune had proved so implacable, the blunders committed had\r\nbeen so excessive, that to these men of narrow minds such a series of\r\ndisasters could only be explained by treachery.\r\n\r\n\'We are betrayed! We are betrayed!\' they shouted, in maddened voices.\r\n\r\nThen, an idea occurring to Loubet he exclaimed: \'It\'s perhaps that\r\nbeast of an Emperor who\'s blocking the road with all his luggage.\'\r\n\r\nThe surmise circulated, till it was positively affirmed that the\r\nblock was occasioned by the imperial household having intercepted the\r\ncolumn. Then the men swore abominable oaths, venting all the hatred\r\nthat had been roused in their breasts by the insolence of the Emperor\'s\r\nattendants, who took possession of the towns where they slept,\r\nunpacking their provisions, their baskets of wine, and their silver\r\nplate in the presence of soldiers who were destitute of everything, and\r\nsetting the kitchens ablaze when the poor devils had to go without a\r\nparticle of food.\r\n\r\nAh! that wretched Emperor--now without a throne or a command, like\r\na lost child in the midst of his empire, carried off as if he were\r\nsome useless parcel among the baggage of his troops, condemned to\r\ndrag about with him the irony of his gala household, his Cent-Gardes,\r\nhis carriages, his horses, his cooks, his vans, all the pomp of his\r\nbee-spangled state robes, sweeping up the blood and the mire of the\r\nhighways of defeat!\r\n\r\nTwo more shells now fell in quick succession, and a splinter carried\r\noff Lieutenant Rochas\'s cap. The ranks closed up amid violent\r\npushing--a kind of wave, the ebbing of which spread afar off. Men were\r\ncalling out in choking voices, and Lapoulle shouted to those in front\r\nof him to advance. Another minute, perhaps, and a frightful catastrophe\r\nwould take place, a _sauve-qui-peut_ which would result in the men\r\nengaging in a furious _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_ together, and being crushed to death in\r\nthe depths of that narrow pass.\r\n\r\nThe colonel turned round, looking very pale: \'My lads, my lads,\' he\r\nsaid, \'a little patience. I have sent some one to see--we are off.\'\r\n\r\nBut the march was not resumed, and the seconds seemed like centuries.\r\nJean had already taken Maurice by the hand, and with admirable calmness\r\nwas explaining to him in a whisper that if their comrades should again\r\nbegin pushing, they had better jump aside on the left, and climb\r\nthrough the woods on the other side of the little river. He looked\r\nround for the Francs-tireurs, in the idea that they must know the\r\nroads, but he was told that they had disappeared while the regiment\r\nwas passing through Raucourt. And then, all at once, the march was\r\nresumed; they turned round a bend of the road, and were thenceforth\r\nscreened from the German batteries. Later on, some of them learned that\r\nit was General de Bonnemain\'s division of cavalry--four regiments of\r\nCuirassiers--that had thus intercepted and stopped the Seventh Corps in\r\nthe confusion of that disastrous day.\r\n\r\nThe night was falling when the 106th passed through Augecourt. The\r\nwooded crests still rose upon the right, but on the left the defile\r\ngrew broader, and a bluish valley could be seen in the distance. At\r\nlast from the heights of Remilly they perceived, in the evening mist,\r\na pale silvery ribbon winding through the immense rolling expanse of\r\nmeadow and cultivated land. It was the Meuse--the Meuse they had so\r\nlonged to reach and where it seemed the victory was to be.\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice, stretching out his arm towards some distant, tiny lights,\r\nthat were gaily shining out amid the verdure in the depths of that\r\nfruitful valley, so delightfully charming in the gentle twilight, said\r\nto Jean, with the joyous relief of a man who again finds a spot he\r\nloves: \'There--look over yonder--that is SEDAN!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIN VIEW OF SEDAN--SILVINE\'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nA frightful medley of men, horses, and vehicles encumbered the sloping\r\nstreet of Remilly, descending in zigzags to the Meuse. Halfway down the\r\nhill, in front of the church, were some guns, the wheels of which were\r\nlocked together, and the men seemed unable to get them any farther,\r\nhowever much they might swear and push. Near the spinning-mill below,\r\nwhere a fall of the Emmane roars, a train of baggage waggons was\r\nstranded, completely blocking the road; whilst an ever-swelling mob of\r\nexasperated soldiers was fighting at the Cross of Malta inn, without\r\nany of the men being able to obtain even a glass of wine.\r\n\r\nThe furious rush came to an end on the southern side of the village,\r\nwhich a copse here separates from the Meuse. The Engineers had thrown a\r\npontoon bridge across the river during the morning. On the right there\r\nwas a ferry with the waterman\'s solitary house standing out whitely\r\namong the tall rushes. Large fires had been lighted on both banks, and\r\nevery now and then the flames, deftly encouraged, set the night all\r\naglow, lighting up both the water and the shore, as though it had been\r\nmidday. One could then perceive the enormous accumulation of troops\r\nwaiting here; for only two men could cross the foot-bridge at a time,\r\nwhilst the pontoon bridge, which was certainly not more than ten feet\r\nwide, was encumbered with artillery, cavalry and baggage waggons,\r\ndefiling over it at a distressingly slow pace. It was reported that a\r\nbrigade of the First Corps and an ammunition convoy were still on the\r\nspot, besides four regiments of Cuirassiers belonging to Bonnemain\'s\r\ndivision; and now, in the rear, came the entire Seventh Army Corps,\r\nthirty and odd thousand men, who believing that they had the enemy at\r\ntheir heels were feverishly eager to reach a place of safety by getting\r\nacross the stream.\r\n\r\nFor a moment perfect despair prevailed when the men of the Seventh\r\nCorps arrived on the scene. What! they had been marching ever since\r\nmorning without anything to eat, and had managed, by dint of superhuman\r\nexertion, to escape out of that terrible defile of Haraucourt, simply\r\nto plunge into all this confusion and bewilderment, to run their heads,\r\nas it were, against an impassable wall! Many hours would probably\r\nelapse before the last arrivals were able to cross; and, even supposing\r\nthe Prussians should not dare to continue the pursuit during the night,\r\nit was certain they would be on the spot at daybreak. Nevertheless,\r\norders were given to pile arms, and the men encamped on some extensive\r\nbare hills, whose slopes, skirted by the road to Mouzon, descend to the\r\nmeadows of the Meuse. On a plateau, in the rear, the reserve artillery\r\ntook up position, with the guns pointed towards the defile so that, if\r\nnecessary, they might shell its outlet.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the 106th was installed, above the road, in some stubble\r\noverlooking the far-spreading plain. The men parted with their\r\nchassepots regretfully, glancing behind them with disquietude, haunted\r\nas they were with the apprehension of an attack. With their teeth set\r\nand a harsh expression on their faces, they abstained from chatting\r\ntogether, merely growling angry words, every now and then. Nine o\'clock\r\nwas on the point of striking; they had been there for a couple of\r\nhours; and many of them, though atrociously weary, were unable to\r\nsleep, and lay upon the ground listening and starting at the faintest\r\nsounds that were wafted from afar off. They no longer struggled against\r\nthe hunger that consumed them. They would eat when they got across the\r\nriver, and then, if there were nothing else, they would eat the grass.\r\nDown below, however, the obstruction was increasing, and the officers,\r\nwhom General Douay had posted near the bridge, came every twenty\r\nminutes or so with the same irritating tidings that many hours must\r\nelapse before all the troops could be got across. At last the general\r\ndecided to make his way to the bridge in person, and he could be seen\r\nstruggling in the midst of this human sea and urging on the march.\r\n\r\nSeated against a bank by the side of Jean, Maurice pointed to the\r\nnorth as he had done before. \'Sedan lies there below,\' said he. \'And,\r\nlook, Bazeilles is yonder! And then there\'s Douzy and Carignan on the\r\nright--it\'s at Carignan, no doubt, that we shall be concentrated. Ah!\r\nthere\'s plenty of room there, as you would soon see, if it were only\r\ndaylight!\'\r\n\r\nHis gesture embraced the whole of the immense shadowy valley. The sky\r\nwas not so dark as to prevent one from discerning the pale river,\r\ncoursing through the expanse of black, rolling meadows. Here and there\r\nthe tufts of trees formed denser patches and a row of poplars barred\r\nthe horizon on the left, as with a fantastic-looking dyke. Then, in\r\nthe depths far away, behind Sedan, dotted with bright little lights,\r\nthere was an accumulation of darkness, as though all the forests of the\r\nArdennes had there stretched a curtain of their centenarian oaks.\r\n\r\nJean was again gazing at the pontoon bridge below them. \'Look!\' said\r\nhe, \'it will all give way. We shall never get across.\'\r\n\r\nThe fires were now burning higher on both banks, and their glow had\r\nbecome so bright that the frightful scene was clearly visible. The\r\npontoons, supporting the timbers, had ended by sinking beneath the\r\nweight of all the artillery and cavalry that had passed over them since\r\nthe morning, and the brow or platform of the bridge was a few inches\r\nunder water. Two by two, in endless files went the Cuirassiers, who\r\nwere now crossing the stream, slowly emerging from the darkness on\r\none bank, and passing at last into that on the other. As the bridge\r\ncould no longer be seen, it seemed as though they were marching on the\r\nwater, on the brightly illumined river, in which a lurid conflagration\r\nwas dancing. The neighing horses, with their manes raised and their\r\nlegs stiffened by fright, advanced but slowly over the swaying bridge,\r\nwhich seemed to be gliding away beneath them. Erect in their stirrups,\r\nand with tightened reins, still did the Cuirassiers pass and pass, all\r\nuniformly draped in long white cloaks, and their helmets blazing with\r\nfiery reflections. They looked like phantom horsemen, with flaming\r\nhair, marching away to some tenebrous warfare.\r\n\r\nA deep plaint escaped from Jean\'s contracted throat: \'Oh! how hungry I\r\nam!\'\r\n\r\nThe men around him, despite the complaining groans of their empty\r\nstomachs, had now fallen asleep. Their weariness was so intense that\r\nit had finally mastered their fears, and had stretched them on their\r\nbacks with open mouths, overwhelmed beneath the dark sky which no moon\r\nillumined. From one to the other end of those bare hills, waiting and\r\nexpectancy had now given place to a death-like silence.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! how hungry I am, so hungry I could eat the very earth.\' Such was\r\nthe cry which Jean, so inured to hardship and usually so silent, was\r\nno longer able to restrain; a cry which he raised despite himself, in\r\nthe delirium caused by privation; for six-and-thirty hours had now\r\nelapsed since he had partaken of any food. Then Maurice, who realised\r\nthat their regiment would not cross the Meuse at least for another two\r\nor three hours, made up his mind to speak: \'Listen,\' said he, \'I have\r\nan uncle living near here; uncle Fouchard, whom I told you about. His\r\nplace is over there, some five or six hundred yards away. I hesitated\r\nabout going, but since you are so hungry we had better try him. He will\r\ngive us some bread at all events.\' Thereupon he led his unresisting\r\ncomrade away.\r\n\r\nOld Fouchard\'s little farm was situated on the outskirts of the defile\r\nof Haraucourt, near the plateau where the reserve artillery was\r\nencamped. There was a low house, with outbuildings of considerable\r\nextent, a barn, a cowshed, and a stable: and, in a kind of coach-house\r\non the other side of the road, the old peasant had installed his\r\nbutcher\'s business. It was there that he slaughtered the animals which\r\nhe subsequently hawked through the surrounding villages in his cart.\r\nAs the two men drew near to the place Maurice was surprised not to see\r\nany light in the house. \'The old miser!\' he muttered; \'he must have\r\nbarricaded himself indoors--he won\'t open.\'\r\n\r\nOn reaching the road, the young fellow stopped short at sight of a\r\ndozen marauding soldiers--hungry rascals, no doubt, on the prowl for\r\nsomething to fill their maws with--who were moving hither and thither\r\nin front of the farmhouse. They had begun by calling; then they had\r\nknocked; and now, as the house remained quite black and silent, they\r\nwere battering the door with the butt-ends of their guns with the\r\nobject of breaking the lock open. Gruff voices could be heard roaring:\r\n\'Thunder! Hit harder! Break the cursed door down, since there\'s no one\r\ninside.\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, the shutter of a garret window was flung back, and\r\na tall old man, wearing a blouse and with his head bare, appeared\r\ncarrying a tallow candle in one hand and a gun in the other. He had\r\ncoarse white hair and a square, broadly wrinkled face, with a prominent\r\nnose, large light-coloured eyes and a chin expressive of obstinate\r\nself-will.\r\n\r\n\'Are you fellows thieves, that you are smashing everything like that?\'\r\nhe shouted in a harsh voice. \'What on earth do you want?\'\r\n\r\nThe soldiers drew back, somewhat abashed: \'We are dying of hunger. We\r\nwant something to eat,\' they answered.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got nothing, not even a crust! Do you fellows think we can\r\nfeed hundreds of thousands of men? Other troops passed by here this\r\nmorning--General Ducrot\'s men--and they took everything I had.\'\r\n\r\nOne by one the soldiers were again drawing nearer: \'All the same, just\r\nopen your door. We\'ll have a rest. You\'ll be able to find us a morsel,\r\nsure enough.\'\r\n\r\nThey were again hammering on the door, when the old man, after placing\r\nthe candle on the window-sill, raised his gun to his shoulder: \'As true\r\nas that\'s a candle,\' he shouted, \'I\'ll send a bullet into the head of\r\nthe first man who touches my door!\'\r\n\r\nA combat appeared imminent. Curses resounded, and some one shouted that\r\nthey ought to settle the hash of that swinish peasant, who, like the\r\nrest of the litter, would have flung his bread into the water rather\r\nthan give a bite to a soldier. The chassepots were already levelled,\r\nand it seemed certain that he would be shot down, for, in his obstinate\r\nrage, he remained standing there, clearly visible in the flaring\r\ncandle-light.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing at all,\' he resumed, \'not a crust! Everything has been taken\r\nfrom me.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maurice, in dire alarm, sprang forward followed by Jean.\r\n\r\n\'Comrades, comrades!\' he shouted as with a blow of his arm he lowered\r\nthe guns of the marauders; and then, raising his head, he called to\r\nFouchard in a supplicating tone: \'Come, be reasonable. Don\'t you know\r\nme?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who are you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your nephew, Maurice Levasseur.\'\r\n\r\nFouchard had taken up the candle again, and, doubtless, he recognised\r\nMaurice; but he remained obstinate, determined not to give the men even\r\nso much as a glass of water. \'Nephew, indeed!\' he growled; \'who can\r\ntell in that cursed darkness? Begone all of you, or I\'ll fire!\' And\r\namid the shouts that were then raised, the threats that they would\r\npick him off and fire his shanty, he continued bawling the same phrase,\r\nrepeating it a score of times: \'Begone all of you, or I\'ll fire!\'\r\n\r\n\'Even on me, father?\' suddenly called a loud voice which resounded\r\nabove all the tumult.\r\n\r\nThe other men had drawn on one side, and now, in the flickering\r\ncandle-light, a quartermaster suddenly appeared. It was Honor\xc3\xa9, whose\r\nbattery was stationed less than two hundred yards away, and who, for a\r\ncouple of hours, had been struggling with a desire he felt to go and\r\nknock at his father\'s door. Yet he had sworn that he would never again\r\ncross the threshold, and, during the four years that he had been in\r\nthe army, he had not once written to the old man whom he now addressed\r\nso curtly. The marauders were already talking together with animation,\r\nand concerting other measures. So that was the old fellow\'s son--a\r\nquartermaster, eh! Such being the case there was evidently nothing to\r\nbe done; matters might turn out badly, and they had far better try\r\ntheir luck elsewhere. Thereupon they slunk away, speedily vanishing\r\namid the pitchy darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen Fouchard realised that he was saved from being pillaged, he\r\nexclaimed, without evincing the slightest emotion, and, in fact, as\r\nthough he had seen his son only the day before: \'It\'s you--all right,\r\nI\'m coming down.\'\r\n\r\nIt was a long business. He could be heard unlocking and re-locking\r\ndoors which, like a careful man, he kept secured. Then, at last, the\r\nfront door was just set ajar and held vigorously to prevent it from\r\nbeing flung wide open. \'_You_ can come in--but no one else, mind,\' said\r\nFouchard to his son. Evident as was his repugnance, however, he could\r\nnot refuse shelter to his nephew: \'Well, you too,\' he added.\r\n\r\nThen he pitilessly pushed the door back on Jean, and Maurice again had\r\nto supplicate. But the old man was obstinate; no, no, he didn\'t want\r\nany strangers, any thieves to smash the furniture. Honor\xc3\xa9, however,\r\nat last forced the door open with his shoulder and made the corporal\r\nenter; the old fellow being compelled to yield, though he continued\r\nmuttering covert threats. He had not parted with his gun, but when he\r\nhad led them into the living-room he rested it against the sideboard,\r\nand placing the candle on the table, sank into stubborn silence.\r\n\r\n\'I say, father, we are dying of hunger. You\'ll surely give us some\r\nbread and cheese?\'\r\n\r\nFouchard made no answer; he did not seem to hear his son, but\r\nrepeatedly stepped up to the window to listen whether some fresh band\r\nwere not on the point of besieging his house. \'Come, uncle,\' said\r\nMaurice, \'Jean\'s a brother. He went without food to save me. We have\r\nsuffered so dreadfully together.\'\r\n\r\nThe old man, however, continued his perambulations, satisfying himself\r\nthat everything was in its place, and without even casting a glance\r\nat his son and nephew. Still without saying a word, he at last made\r\nup his mind to grant their request, and then, taking the candle, he\r\nwent off, leaving them in the darkness and carefully locking the door\r\nbehind him so that he might not be followed. He could be heard going\r\ndown the cellar stairs, and then another long interval ensued. When he\r\ncame back he again made the door fast and placed a large loaf and a\r\ncheese upon the table, still maintaining his obstinate silence, not,\r\nhowever, that he was sullen, for his anger had passed away, but from\r\nmotives of policy, since one can never tell how far talking may lead\r\none. Moreover, the three men were in no mood to waste words, but fell\r\non the food and began to devour it. No sound could now be heard save\r\nthe savage crunching of their jaws.\r\n\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9 at last rose to fetch a pitcher of water standing near the\r\nsideboard. \'You might have given us some wine, father,\' said he.\r\n\r\nFouchard, who was recovering his calmness and self-control, at the\r\nsame time found his tongue again: \'Wine? Why, I haven\'t a drop left.\r\nDucrot\'s men ate and drank and pillaged everything I had.\'\r\n\r\nHe was lying, and all his efforts to conceal it were unavailing; it\r\ncould be clearly detected by the blinking of his big pale eyes. A\r\ncouple of days previously he had concealed his cattle, the few cows he\r\nkept and the oxen and sheep reserved for his business, driving them\r\naway in the night and hiding them no one knew where, but possibly in\r\nthe depths of some wood or some abandoned quarry. And since then he\r\nhad spent long hours at home in burying his wine, his bread, in fact\r\nall his provisions, even to the flour and salt, so that one would\r\nhave ransacked every cupboard in vain. The house was cleared. He had\r\neven refused to sell anything to the first soldiers who had presented\r\nthemselves. There was no telling, perhaps he might have better\r\nopportunities, and vague ideas of making a pile of money germinated in\r\nthis shrewd, patient miser\'s brain.\r\n\r\nMaurice, promptly satisfying his hunger, was the first to speak. \'And\r\nis it long since you saw my sister, Henriette?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow was still walking about, glancing every now and then\r\nat Jean, who was precipitately swallowing huge mouthfuls of bread;\r\nand slowly, as though weighing every word he answered: \'Henriette?\r\nYes, I saw her last month at Sedan. But I caught sight of her husband,\r\nWeiss, this morning. He was in a trap with his employer, Monsieur\r\nDelaherche--they were going to Mouzon to see the army pass, just by way\r\nof amusing themselves.\' An expression of profound irony passed over the\r\nold peasant\'s stolid face. \'Perhaps,\' added he, \'they may have seen\r\ntoo much of the army, and not have had much amusement--for after three\r\no\'clock, it was impossible to pass along the roads. They were crowded\r\nwith runaways.\'\r\n\r\nThen, in the same quiet voice and with an air of seeming indifference,\r\nhe gave some particulars respecting the defeat of the Fifth Corps,\r\nwhich, whilst the men were preparing their _soupe_, had been surprised\r\nat Beaumont by the Bavarians, and thrown back as far as Mouzon.[24]\r\nSome panic-stricken, disbanded soldiers, on their way through Remilly,\r\nhad shouted to him that De Failly had once more sold them to Bismarck.\r\nOn hearing all this Maurice could not help thinking of the precipitate\r\nmarching of the last two days, of the orders to hasten the retreat\r\ngiven by MacMahon, now all eagerness to cross the Meuse at any\r\ncost after so many precious days had been lost in incomprehensible\r\nhesitation. But the decision had come too late. Doubtless the marshal,\r\nso angered on finding the Seventh Corps still at Oches when it ought to\r\nhave reached La Besace, had imagined that the Fifth Corps was already\r\nencamped at Mouzon, when, in reality, it was being crushed at Beaumont,\r\nthrough its folly in tarrying there. What, however, could be required,\r\nexpected of troops who were so badly commanded, so demoralised by\r\nwaiting and persistent retreating, exhausted alike by hunger and\r\nweariness?\r\n\r\nFouchard had ended by stationing himself behind Jean, astonished to see\r\nwhat a prodigious quantity of bread and cheese the corporal managed\r\nto put away. \'You feel better now, eh?\' he remarked, in a bantering\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nJean raised his head, and with the same peasant-like air replied: \'A\r\nlittle, thanks.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, despite his intense hunger, Honor\xc3\xa9 every now and then ceased\r\neating, and turned his head to listen as if he fancied he could hear\r\nsome sound or other. If, after a fight with himself, he had broken his\r\noath that he would never again set foot in that house, it was solely\r\non account of the irresistible desire he experienced to see Silvine\r\nonce more. Under his shirt, against his very skin, he preserved the\r\nletter he had received from her at Rheims, that tender letter in which\r\nshe told him that she still loved him, and that she would never love\r\nanyone else, despite all the cruel past, despite Goliath, despite even\r\nlittle Charlot,[25] the Prussian\'s son and her own. And now Honor\xc3\xa9 had\r\nthoughts only for her, and felt anxious at not having yet seen her,\r\nthough he strove to hide his anxiety from his father. Passion, however,\r\nwon the day, and at last, endeavouring to speak in a natural voice, he\r\ninquired: \'And Silvine--is she still with you?\'\r\n\r\nFouchard glanced askance at his son, his eyes glittering with inward\r\nmerriment: \'Yes, yes,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nThen he relapsed into silence and began spitting; and the artilleryman,\r\nafter a pause, was forced to resume: \'She\'s in bed, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no.\'\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the old man condescended to explain that, in spite\r\nof what was happening, he had driven to Raucourt market that morning\r\nin his cart, taking the girl with him. Soldiers might be passing along\r\nthe roads, but surely that was no reason why people should cease\r\neating meat, or why he should neglect his business. So, as was his\r\nhabit every Tuesday, he had driven to Raucourt with a sheep and some\r\nbeef, and was just finishing his sales when the Seventh Corps made its\r\nappearance, and he speedily found himself in the midst of a frightful\r\nhubbub. Soldiers were running about hustling everybody, and fearing\r\nthat some of them might steal his horse and cart, he had taken himself\r\noff, leaving Silvine behind; she, it appeared, was away at the time,\r\ncarrying meat to some customers in the town. \'Oh! she\'ll find her\r\nway back sure enough,\' he added: \'she must have taken refuge at Dr.\r\nDalichamp, her godfather\'s--she\'s a brave girl, although she only seems\r\nto know how to obey--she has her qualities, certainly she has.\'\r\n\r\nWas he jeering? Was he desirous of explaining why he still retained\r\nthe services of that girl, the cause of his quarrel with his son, and\r\nthis, despite the child, from whom she refused to be parted? Again did\r\nFouchard give Honor\xc3\xa9 a sidelong glance, and laugh inwardly as he added,\r\n\'Charlot\'s in there, asleep in her room; so it\'s certain she won\'t be\r\nvery long coming.\'\r\n\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9, whose lips were quivering, gazed so fixedly at his father that\r\nthe latter again began walking up and down. Then the silence fell once\r\nmore, whilst the artilleryman, in a mechanical way, cut himself another\r\npiece of bread, and went on eating. Jean also continued devouring the\r\nbread and cheese without feeling the slightest desire to talk. Maurice,\r\nwhose hunger was appeased, sat there with his elbows on the table,\r\nexamining the furniture of the room, the old sideboard and the old\r\nclock, and dreaming of the holidays that he and his sister had spent at\r\nRemilly in times long past. Thus the minutes went by, and at last the\r\nclock struck eleven.\r\n\r\n\'The devil!\' muttered Maurice. \'We mustn\'t let the others go off.\'\r\n\r\nWithout any opposition on Fouchard\'s part, he then opened the window.\r\nThe whole black valley was hollowed out there below, looking, at the\r\nfirst glance, like a sombre rolling sea; but when the eyes had become\r\naccustomed to the scene, one could clearly distinguish the bridge,\r\nillumined by the fires on both banks. The Cuirassiers were still\r\ncrossing the river, draped in their long white cloaks, and looking\r\nlike phantoms whose horses, lashed onward by a blast of terror, seemed\r\nto be walking on the water. And the endless, interminable procession\r\ncontinued crawling along, like some vision passing slowly before the\r\neyes. Meantime, on the bare hills on the right, where the troops were\r\nslumbering, all was as still and silent as death itself.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well!\' said Maurice, with a gesture of despair, \'it will be for\r\nto-morrow morning.\'\r\n\r\nHe had left the window wide open, and old Fouchard, catching up his\r\ngun, sprang over the sill and jumped out with the nimbleness of a young\r\nman. For a moment he could be heard marching along with the regular\r\nstep of a sentinel, and then the only audible sound was that of the\r\ncommotion on the encumbered bridge far away; doubtless the old peasant\r\nhad seated himself by the roadside, where he felt more at his ease,\r\nsince he could there watch for any threatening danger, prepared, if\r\nneed were, to jump indoors again and defend his house.\r\n\r\nAnd now not a minute elapsed but Honor\xc3\xa9 glanced at the clock. His\r\ndisquietude was increasing. Less than four miles separate Raucourt\r\nfrom Remilly, a matter of an hour\'s walk for a sturdy young girl like\r\nSilvine. Why had she not arrived, for many and many hours had now\r\nelapsed since the old man had left her amid the confusion created by\r\nthe army corps flooding the district and blocking up the roads? Some\r\ncatastrophe must certainly have befallen her; and he pictured her in\r\ndire distress--wandering distracted through the fields, or knocked down\r\nand trampled upon by the horses on the high road.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, he, Maurice and Jean, rose to their feet. Some one\r\nwas running down the road, and they had distinctly heard the old man\r\ncock his gun. \'Who goes there?\' called Fouchard, in a harsh voice. \'Is\r\nit you, Silvine?\'\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and he repeated his question, threatening to fire.\r\nThen an oppressed, panting voice managed to articulate: \'Yes, yes, it\'s\r\nI, father Fouchard.\' And immediately afterwards the girl inquired: \'And\r\nCharlot?\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s in bed and asleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! all right then--thanks!\' Thereupon she no longer hastened, but\r\nheaved a deep sigh, in which she exhaled all her weariness and anguish.\r\n\r\n\'Get in by the window,\' resumed Fouchard. \'There\'s some one inside.\'\r\n\r\nSpringing into the room, she stopped short in surprise at sight of the\r\nthree men. In the flickering candle-light she appeared before them,\r\nvery dark-complexioned, with thick black hair, and with large, lovely\r\neyes, that sufficed to render her beautiful, lighting up her oval face,\r\nwhich usually wore an expression of submissive tranquillity. But the\r\nsudden sight of Honor\xc3\xa9 had now brought all the blood in her heart to\r\nher cheeks, albeit she was not astonished to find him there, for she\r\nhad been thinking of him whilst running back from Raucourt.\r\n\r\nHe was choking, and felt extremely faint, but he affected great\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, Silvine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, Honor\xc3\xa9.\'\r\n\r\nThen, that she might not burst into sobs, she averted her head and\r\nsmiled at Maurice, whom she had just recognised. Jean\'s presence\r\ninconvenienced her. She felt as though she were stifling, and took off\r\nthe kerchief she wore about her neck.\r\n\r\n\'We were anxious about you, Silvine,\' resumed Honor\xc3\xa9, \'on account of\r\nall those Prussians who are coming up.\'\r\n\r\nShe suddenly became very pale again, and an expression of agitation\r\nswept over her face. Glancing involuntarily in the direction of the\r\nroom where Charlot was asleep, and waving her hand as if to drive away\r\nsome frightful vision, she muttered: \'The Prussians, yes--yes, I have\r\nseen them.\'\r\n\r\nThen, worn out with fatigue, she sank upon a chair, and related that on\r\nthe invasion of Raucourt by the Seventh Corps she had sought refuge at\r\nthe house of Dr. Dalichamp, her godfather, hoping that Fouchard would\r\nthink of fetching her before he started home. Such was the hustling\r\nand confusion in the high street that a dog would not have ventured\r\nthere. She had waited patiently, and without feeling much uneasiness,\r\ntill four o\'clock, employing her time meanwhile in helping several\r\nladies to prepare some lint; for, in the idea that some of the wounded\r\nfrom Metz and Verdun, supposing there were any fighting over there,\r\nwould be sent on to Raucourt, the doctor had been busily engaged for a\r\nfortnight past in installing an ambulance at the town-hall. Some people\r\ncame who asserted that this ambulance might be required at once; and in\r\npoint of fact a cannonade had been heard since noon in the direction of\r\nBeaumont. Still, that was some distance away, and nobody felt alarmed.\r\nSuddenly, however, just as the last French soldiers were on the point\r\nof leaving Raucourt a shell plunged, with a fearful crash, through the\r\nroof of a neighbouring house. Two others followed--a German battery\r\nwas cannonading the rear guard of the Seventh Army Corps. Some wounded\r\nmen from Beaumont having already been brought to the town-hall, it was\r\nfeared that a shell might fall upon them, and finish them off on the\r\nstraw mattresses on which they were lying waiting for the doctor to\r\nattend to them. Maddened by terror these unfortunate men rose up, and\r\ndespite their broken limbs, which drew from them loud cries of agony,\r\ninsisted on crawling into the cellar, which they considered to be the\r\nonly safe place.\r\n\r\n\'And then,\' continued Silvine. \'I don\'t know how it happened, but all\r\nat once everything became silent--I had gone upstairs to a window\r\noverlooking the street and the country, and I could no longer see\r\nanyone, not a single French soldier. But suddenly I heard a heavy\r\ntramp. Somebody called out something I did not understand, and then\r\nthe butt-ends of a number of muskets fell with a thud on the ground.\r\nIn the street down below there were a lot of dark-looking men, short\r\nand grimed with dirt, with huge, hideous heads and wearing helmets\r\nlike those that our firemen wear. I was told they were Bavarians.\r\nThen, as I raised my eyes, I saw--oh! I saw thousands and thousands\r\nof them, coming along by the roads and the fields and the woods, in\r\nclose columns which never seemed to end. The whole country-side at once\r\nbecame quite black with them. It was like a swarm of black locusts\r\ncoming and coming in such numbers that in less than no time I could no\r\nlonger see the ground.\'\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and again made that gesture with her hand to drive away\r\na frightful remembrance.\r\n\r\n\'And then--ah! you can\'t imagine what happened. It seems that these\r\nmen had been three days on the march and had just been fighting like\r\nfuries at Beaumont. And they were dying of hunger, half out of their\r\nsenses, with their eyes starting from their heads. Their officers made\r\nno attempt to restrain them, and they all rushed into the houses and\r\nthe shops, bursting open the doors, breaking the windows, smashing the\r\nfurniture, searching everywhere for something to eat and drink, and\r\nswallowing no matter what came into their hands. I saw one at Monsieur\r\nSimonnet\'s--the grocer\'s--who was scooping molasses out of a tub with\r\nhis helmet. Others were munching pieces of raw bacon. Others, too,\r\nwere swallowing flour. It had already been said that there was nothing\r\nleft, as our soldiers had been passing through the town for forty-eight\r\nhours or more, but these men managed to find something--provisions\r\nthat had been hidden, no doubt, and this made them think that people\r\npurposely refused them food, and they set to work like madmen, smashing\r\neverything. In less than an hour the grocers\' shops, and the bakers\'\r\nand the butchers\' and even the private houses had all their windows\r\nbroken, their cupboards ransacked, and their cellars invaded and\r\nemptied. At the doctor\'s, you may believe me or not, but I actually\r\ncaught sight of one fat fellow, who was eating the soap! It was,\r\nhowever, especially the cellar which they ravaged. We could hear them\r\nfrom upstairs, roaring down there like wild beasts, smashing the\r\nbottles and turning on the taps of all the casks, so that the wine\r\nrushed out with the noise of a waterfall. When they came up again their\r\nhands had been quite reddened by all the wine they had been messing\r\nwith. And--see how it is when men become savages--Monsieur Dalichamp\r\nvainly did his utmost to prevent one soldier from drinking some syrup\r\nof opium which he had found in a wine bottle. The wretched fellow must\r\ncertainly be dead by now; he was suffering dreadfully when I came away.\'\r\n\r\nSeized with a great shudder she covered her eyes with her hands as\r\nthough to shut out the sight of all she had seen. \'No, no,\' she gasped,\r\n\'it was too frightful; it stifles me.\'\r\n\r\nOld Fouchard, still outside, had drawn near and stood by the window,\r\nlistening. This story of pillage had made him thoughtful. He had been\r\ntold that the Prussians paid for everything; were they now turning\r\nthieves, then? Maurice and Jean also evinced the keenest interest in\r\nthese particulars concerning the enemy, whom this girl had just seen,\r\nbut whom they themselves had not yet met, though the fighting had been\r\ngoing on for a month past. Honor\xc3\xa9, however, with a pensive air and\r\ntwitching mouth, took interest in her alone, being absorbed in thoughts\r\nof the calamity that had long since parted them.\r\n\r\nJust then the door of the next room opened, and little Charlot ran in.\r\nHe must have heard his mother\'s voice; and now, simply clad in his\r\nshirt, he was coming to kiss her. Pink and fair, and very big for his\r\nage, he had a light curly crop of hair and large blue eyes. Silvine\r\nshuddered on seeing him appear so suddenly, as though startled by his\r\nresemblance to his father. Did she no longer know her own fondly loved\r\nchild, that she thus gazed at him with an air of fright, as if face to\r\nface with some horrible vision? At last she burst into sobs. \'My poor\r\nlittle one!\' she murmured.\r\n\r\nAnd then, like one distracted, she caught him in her arms and pressed\r\nhim to her neck, whilst Honor\xc3\xa9, turning livid, noted Charlot\'s\r\nremarkable likeness to Goliath. The child had the same fair,\r\nsquare-shaped head as his father; his healthy, infantile form, fresh\r\ncheeks, and smiling lips seemed typical of the German race. So this was\r\nthe Prussian\'s son, \'the little Prussian,\' as the jokers of Remilly\r\ncalled him! And there was his mother, pressing him to her bosom--his\r\nmother, this Frenchwoman, still overwhelmed, and with her heart\r\nlacerated by all that she had seen of the invasion!\r\n\r\n\'My poor little one, be good: go to bed again; go to by-by, my poor\r\nlittle fellow.\'\'\r\n\r\nThen she carried him away, and when she again returned she was no\r\nlonger crying; she had once more recovered her calm, docile, courageous\r\nexpression of countenance. It was Honor\xc3\xa9 who, in a trembling voice,\r\nresumed the conversation: \'And the Prussians?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! yes, the Prussians,\' said Silvine. \'Well, they had broken\r\neverything, pillaged everything, eaten everything, drunk everything.\r\nThey also stole the house linen, the napkins, the towels, the sheets,\r\neven the muslin curtains, which they tore into long strips to dress\r\ntheir feet with. I saw some of them whose feet were so many big sores,\r\nso fearfully had they been punished by their terrible march. In the\r\nroad, in front of the doctor\'s, a number of them took off their boots\r\nand bound strips of lace-edged chemises round their heels--chemises\r\nwhich they had stolen, no doubt, from pretty Madame Lef\xc3\xa8vre, the\r\nmanufacturer\'s wife. The pillage lasted till nightfall. The houses had\r\nno doors and scarcely a pane of glass left, but were quite open to the\r\nstreet, and you could see the remnants of furniture inside--everything\r\nsmashed--a sight to make the calmest people furious. I was almost out\r\nof my senses, and I could not stay there any longer. At the doctor\'s\r\nthey tried to detain me, telling me that the roads were blocked, that\r\nthey were not safe, that I should certainly be killed; but, all the\r\nsame, I went off, and took to the fields on the right hand as soon as\r\nI got out of Raucourt. Carts full of French and Prussian wounded, all\r\nheaped up together, were arriving from Beaumont. Two passed quite close\r\nto me in the darkness, and I heard such groans, such shrieks of pain\r\nthat I ran--oh! I ran right across the fields and through the woods\r\nwithout knowing where I was--going a long distance out of my way over\r\ntowards Villers. I hid myself three times, fancying I could hear some\r\nsoldiers, but the only person I met was another woman, who was running,\r\nlike myself--running away from Beaumont--and who told me things that\r\nmade my hair stand on end. Well, at last I got here, and I feel so\r\nwretched--oh, so wretched!\'\r\n\r\nHer sobs were again suffocating her, but the haunting memory of her\r\nadventure soon brought her back to her narrative, and she related\r\nwhat the woman of Beaumont had told her. This woman, who lived in the\r\nmain street of the village, had seen the German artillery pass after\r\nnightfall. On either side of the way stood a line of soldiers carrying\r\ntorches of resin, which illumined the road with the ruddy glare of a\r\nconflagration. And in the middle a stream of horses, guns, and caissons\r\nswept past, urged on at a furious, hellish gallop. Frenzied and\r\ndiabolical were the haste and eagerness to achieve victory, to pursue,\r\novertake, finish off, and crush the French troops in the depths of some\r\npit near by. Nothing was spared, every obstacle was annihilated, and\r\nstill and ever the artillery swept past. If horses fell, their traces\r\nwere immediately cut, and they were crushed, rolled on, thrust aside\r\nlike bloody wreckage. The men who tried to cross were in their turn\r\nknocked down and hashed to mincemeat by the cannon wheels. And, as\r\nthe hurricane swept along, the famished drivers did not for a moment\r\nthink of halting, but deftly caught the loaves of bread that were\r\nflung to them, and seized hold of the hunks of meat which some of the\r\ntorchbearers had stuck upon the tips of their bayonets. And then with\r\nthese same bayonets the torchbearers prodded the horses, which reared\r\nand plunged, and, maddened by pain, galloped faster and faster away.\r\nAnd thus, as the night went by, still and ever the artillery rushed\r\nalong with tempestuous violence, in the midst of frantic hurrahs.\r\n\r\nDespite the attention he had been giving to Silvine\'s narrative,\r\nMaurice, overcome with fatigue after his gluttonous repast, had just\r\nlet his head fall upon the table, on which he was resting both arms.\r\nFor another minute Jean continued struggling, then he, in his turn, was\r\nvanquished and fell asleep at the other end of the table. Meantime, old\r\nFouchard had gone down the road again, and thus Honor\xc3\xa9 found himself\r\nalone with Silvine, who was now sitting, quite still, in front of the\r\nopen window.\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster rose up and approached the window in his turn. The\r\nnight was still dense and black, laden with the hard breathing of\r\nthousands of troops. Louder, more sonorous sounds, were now rising,\r\nhowever--now a cracking noise, then the thud of a collision. At present\r\nsome artillery was crossing the half-submerged bridge down below.\r\nHorses reared, frightened by the dancing, flowing water. Caissons\r\nslipped, and as they could not be righted, had to be thrown into the\r\nstream. And at sight of the retreat which was being so painfully, so\r\nslowly effected across the river--this retreat, which had begun the\r\nprevious day, and would certainly not be accomplished by dawn--the\r\nyoung man instinctively thought of that other artillery--the artillery\r\nof the foe--rushing like a wild torrent through Beaumont, overthrowing\r\nall before it, and crushing both man and beast so that it might travel\r\nthe faster.\r\n\r\nAt last, Honor\xc3\xa9 drew near to Silvine, and in full view of all that\r\ndarkness through which fierce quiverings sped, he gently said to her,\r\n\'So you are unhappy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, very unhappy.\' She divined that he was going to speak of the\r\nabomination, and she lowered her head.\r\n\r\n\'Tell me,\' he resumed; \'how did it happen?\'\r\n\r\nAt first she could not answer him, but he plied her with questions, and\r\nat last, in a choking voice, she stammered: \'My God! I do not know; I\r\nswear to you I do not even know. But it would be wrong to tell a lie,\r\nand I cannot excuse myself. I cannot say that he struck me--but you\r\nwere gone, and I was mad, and it came to pass I know not, I know not\r\nhow.\'\r\n\r\nHer sobs were stifling her, and for a moment Honor\xc3\xa9 paused. His face\r\nwas ashy pale, and his throat contracted. However, the idea that she\r\nrefused to tell a lie rendered him somewhat calmer. At last he began\r\nquestioning her afresh, his mind still busy with all that he did not as\r\nyet understand.\r\n\r\n\'All the same, my father kept you here?\' said he.\r\n\r\nGrowing calmer once more, again recovering her expression of courageous\r\nresignation, she answered, without raising her eyes: \'I do his work;\r\nI don\'t cost much to keep; and now, as there is another mouth besides\r\nmy own to feed, he has lowered my wages. He knows well enough that,\r\nwhatever he may order me to do, I am now obliged to do it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you, why did you stay?\'\r\n\r\nAt this she was so surprised that she raised her eyes and looked at\r\nhim: \'I? Where would you have me go? Here, at least my little one and I\r\nhave something to eat, and live in peace.\'\r\n\r\nThe silence fell once more. They were now looking into one another\'s\r\neyes. The panting of the throng was ascending in increased volume from\r\nthe dark valley below, and the rumbling of the guns as they rolled\r\nover the pontoon bridge seemed interminable. Suddenly a loud cry, the\r\nforlorn cry of some man or beast, infinitely piteous, sped through the\r\ndark expanse.\r\n\r\n\'Listen to me, Silvine,\' slowly resumed Honor\xc3\xa9; \'you sent me a letter\r\nwhich gave me great joy. But for that I should never have come back\r\nhere. I read it again this evening, and in it you say things that could\r\nnot be better said.\'\r\n\r\nShe had at first turned pale on hearing him mention her letter. Perhaps\r\nhe was angry with her for having dared to write to him like some bold,\r\nvulgar wench. But as he proceeded, she became quite red.\r\n\r\n\'I know you don\'t like lying,\' continued Honor\xc3\xa9, \'and for that reason\r\nI believe what you wrote to me. Yes, I now thoroughly believe it.\r\nYou were right in thinking that if I had been killed during the war,\r\nwithout seeing you again, I should have been very unhappy at the\r\nthought that you did not love me. But since you still love me, since\r\nyou have never loved anybody else----\'\r\n\r\nThen his speech faltered; he could no longer find words to express\r\nhimself; he was shaking with intense emotion. \'Listen, Silvine,\' he\r\nsaid at last, \'if those swinish Prussians don\'t kill me I\'ll take you\r\nall the same; yes, we\'ll be married as soon as I get my discharge.\'\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet, gave a loud cry and fell in the young man\'s\r\narms. She was quite unable to speak; all the blood in her veins had\r\nrushed to her face. Honor\xc3\xa9 seated himself on the chair and took her on\r\nhis knees.\r\n\r\n\'I have thought it over,\' said he, \'and in coming here to-night that\r\nwas what I wanted to say to you. If my father refuses his consent,\r\nwell, we\'ll go away together. The world is wide. And as for your little\r\none, well, we can\'t strangle him. There\'ll be others coming by-and-by;\r\namong the brood I sha\'n\'t be able to distinguish him.\'\r\n\r\nSo she was forgiven. Yet she struggled against this immense happiness,\r\nand at last she murmured, \'No, it isn\'t possible, it is too much. Some\r\nday, perhaps, you will regret it. But how good you are, Honor\xc3\xa9; and how\r\nI love you!\'\r\n\r\nHe silenced her with a kiss on the lips. And she no longer had the\r\nstrength to refuse the promised felicity, the happy life which she had\r\nthought for ever dead. With an involuntary irresistible impulse, she\r\ncaught him in her arms, and in her turn kissed him, pressing him to\r\nher bosom with all her woman\'s strength, like a treasure regained that\r\nbelonged to her alone, and which none should ever take from her. He\r\nwas hers once more, he whom she had lost, and she would die rather than\r\nlose him again.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a sound of commotion arose; the dense night was filled\r\nwith the loud tumult of the reveille. Orders were being shouted, bugles\r\nrang out, and from the bare hills rose up a mass of shadowy forms that\r\nmoved hither and thither, an indistinct, rolling sea flowing already\r\ntowards the road. The fires on both banks were now going out, and\r\none could merely discern confused, tramping masses of men, it being\r\nimpossible to tell whether they were still crossing the river or not.\r\nNever, however, had the darkness been fraught with such anguish, such\r\ndesperate fear.\r\n\r\nOld Fouchard now drew near to the window and called that the others\r\nwere starting. His voice roused Jean and Maurice, who rose to their\r\nfeet numbed and shivering. Honor\xc3\xa9, meantime, had quickly pressed\r\nSilvine\'s hand in his own. \'It is sworn,\' said he; \'wait for me.\'\r\n\r\nShe could not think of a word to answer, but she gave him a look into\r\nwhich she cast her whole soul, a last, long look as he sprang out of\r\nthe window to join his battery at the double-quick.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, my lad.\'\r\n\r\nAnd that was all; the peasant and the soldier parted as they had met,\r\nwithout an embrace--like a father and son who do not need to see one\r\nanother in order to live.\r\n\r\nWhen in their turn Maurice and Jean had left the farm, they descended\r\nthe steep slope at a gallop. But they no longer found the 106th down\r\nbelow; all the regiments were already on the march, and they had to\r\nrun on, now directed to the right and now to the left, until at last,\r\nwhen they had quite lost their heads amid the fearful confusion, they\r\nfell in with their company, which Lieutenant Rochas was commanding. As\r\nfor Captain Beaudoin and the rest of the regiment, they were doubtless\r\nelsewhere. And now Maurice was stupefied on realising that this mob of\r\nmen, horses, and guns was quitting Remilly in the direction of Sedan,\r\nproceeding along the left bank of the Meuse. What had happened, then?\r\nWhy did they not cross the river? Why did they retreat towards the\r\nnorth?\r\n\r\nAn officer of Chasseurs who happened to be there, no one knew how,\r\nexclaimed aloud: \'Thunder! We ought to have taken to our heels on the\r\n28th, when we were at Le Ch\xc3\xaane!\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, others explained the movements that were being accomplished,\r\nand scraps of intelligence circulated. It appeared that at about two\r\no\'clock in the morning one of Marshal MacMahon\'s aides-de-camp had\r\ncome to inform General Douay that the entire army was to fall back on\r\nSedan without loss of time. The Fifth Corps crushed at Beaumont was\r\noverwhelming the other corps in its own disaster. When the aide-de-camp\r\narrived, General Douay was still watching near the pontoon-bridge,\r\nin despair that only his Third Division had as yet managed to cross\r\nthe stream. Dawn was now at hand, and they might be attacked at any\r\nmoment. Accordingly he instructed the general officers, placed under\r\nhis orders, to gain Sedan by the most direct routes, each acting for\r\nhimself. For his own part, quitting the bridge, which he ordered to\r\nbe destroyed, he went off along the left bank with his First Division\r\nand the reserve artillery, whilst the Third Division proceeded along\r\nthe right bank, and the first, which had suffered at Beaumont and was\r\ndisbanded, fled no one knew whither. Of the Seventh Army Corps, which\r\nhad not yet fought a battle, there were now only so many scattered\r\nfragments, straying along the roads and rushing onward in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet three o\'clock, and the night was still black. Maurice,\r\nthough he was acquainted with the district, no longer knew where he\r\nwas roaming, unable to take his bearings amid the overflowing torrent,\r\nthe maddened mob that was streaming tempestuously along the road.\r\nMany men who had escaped from the crushing blow of Beaumont, soldiers\r\nof all arms, in tatters, and grimed with blood and dust, had become\r\nmingled with the regiments and spread terror through the ranks. From\r\nall the broad valley across the stream ascended a sound of commotion,\r\nthe tramping of other flocks, of other flights, for the First Corps had\r\nleft Carignan and Douzy, and the Twelfth Corps had started from Mouzon\r\nwith the remnants of the Fifth, all being set in motion, carried along\r\nby the same logical, irresistible force, which since the 28th had been\r\nimpelling the army northwards, driving it into the depths whence no\r\negress was possible, and where it was fated to perish.\r\n\r\nHowever, whilst Captain Beaudoin\'s company was passing through\r\nPont-Maugis the morning twilight appeared, and Maurice was then able\r\nto identify his surroundings. On the left were the slopes of the Liry\r\nhill, on the right the road was skirted by the Meuse. Infinitely sad\r\nin the grey dawn, Bazeilles and Balan loomed indistinctly beyond the\r\nmeadows; whilst on the horizon Sedan, livid and woeful, with the aspect\r\nof some vision seen in a nightmare, stood out against the vast dark\r\ncurtain of forest trees. When, after passing through Wadelincourt, the\r\nmen at last reached the Torcy gate, it became necessary to parley, to\r\nsupplicate, threaten, and, in fact, almost besiege the fortress before\r\nthe governor would lower the drawbridge. It was now five o\'clock.\r\nIntoxicated with weariness, hunger and cold, the Seventh Army Corps\r\nentered Sedan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSEDAN AT LAST! THE EVE OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nJean became separated from Maurice in the scramble which took place\r\non the Place de Torcy at the end of the Wadelincourt highway, and as\r\nhe ran on he lost himself among the tramping crowd, and was unable to\r\nfind his friend. This was really unlucky, for he had accepted Maurice\'s\r\noffer to take him to his sister\'s house, where they had arranged to\r\nhave a rest, a refreshing nap in a comfortable bed. There was so much\r\nconfusion, all the regiments being intermingled, without marching\r\norders or even commanders, that the men were almost at liberty to do\r\nas they pleased. Thus Maurice and Jean had come to the conclusion that\r\nafter enjoying a few hours\' sleep they would still have ample time to\r\ntake their bearings and rejoin their comrades.\r\n\r\nQuite scared, Jean found himself on the Torcy viaduct, overlooking\r\nextensive meadows which the governor had flooded with the waters of\r\nthe river. Then, after passing through another gateway, he crossed the\r\nbridge over the Meuse, and, although the dawn was rising, it seemed\r\nto him as if night were coming back again, so darkly did the lofty\r\nhouses overshadow the damp streets of this little town, cramped up\r\nwithin its ramparts. Jean did not even remember the name of Maurice\'s\r\nbrother-in-law; he only knew that the young fellow\'s sister was named\r\nHenriette. Where should he go? Whom should he ask for? It was only\r\nthe mechanical motion of the march that still kept him upright; he\r\nfelt that he should fall if he ventured to stop. Like a drowning man,\r\nhe could hear nothing save a confused buzzing, distinguish nothing\r\nsave the continuous streaming of the flood of men and horses in the\r\nmidst of which he was being carried along. Having partaken of some\r\nfood at Remilly, it was now the need of sleep that caused him the most\r\nsuffering; and, indeed, all around him weariness was conquering hunger.\r\nThe shadowy flock of soldiers went stumbling hither and thither along\r\nthe strange streets, and at every step some man or other sank down on\r\nthe footway or on a doorstep, and remained there fast asleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, on raising his eyes, Jean noticed an inscription:\r\n\'Avenue de la Sous-Pr\xc3\xa9fecture.\' At the farther end of this avenue there\r\nwas a monument in a garden, and at a corner near him he perceived a\r\ncavalry soldier, a Chasseur d\'Afrique, whom he fancied he recognised.\r\nWas it not that fellow Prosper, belonging to Remilly, whom he had seen\r\nwith Maurice at Vouziers? The Chasseur had alighted from his horse, and\r\nthe wretched, haggard animal was trembling in every limb, so famished\r\nthat it had stretched out its neck to munch the woodwork of a van,\r\nstanding beside the footway. The horses had received no rations for\r\ntwo days past, and were dying of exhaustion. Jean noticed that tears\r\nwere falling from the eyes of the Chasseur d\'Afrique, as he stood there\r\nbeside his steed, whose big teeth were gnawing the wood with a rasping\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nJean passed on, and when, a few moments afterwards, he retraced\r\nhis steps, in the idea that this Chasseur must know the address of\r\nMaurice\'s relatives, he found him gone. Despair then took possession\r\nof the corporal, who wandered on from street to street till he again\r\nfound himself at the Sub-Prefecture, whence he proceeded as far as the\r\nPlace Turenne. Then, for a moment, he fancied himself saved, for in\r\nfront of the town-hall, at the foot of the statue of Turenne, he espied\r\nLieutenant Rochas with a few men of his company. Since he could not\r\nfind his friend he would join the regiment again and have a nap under\r\ncanvas. That, at all events, would be better than nothing. Captain\r\nBeaudoin not having turned up again--he had doubtless been carried away\r\nin some other direction--the lieutenant had endeavoured to get his men\r\ntogether, besides trying to ascertain on what spot the division was to\r\nencamp. On its way through the town, however, the company gradually\r\ndiminished instead of increasing. One man, after making a furious\r\ngesture, strode into a tavern and was not seen again. Three others\r\nhalted in front of a grocer\'s shop, in compliance with the suggestion\r\nof some Zouaves, who had just tapped a little barrel of brandy there.\r\nOthers, too, quite overcome, had fallen to the ground, and were lying\r\nprostrate in the gutters; whilst some, anxious to start off again,\r\ntried to pick themselves up, but fell back once more, utterly worn out\r\nand dazed. Chouteau and Loubet, after nudging one another, bolted up a\r\ndark passage, behind a fat woman who was carrying a loaf; and finally\r\nonly Pache and Lapoulle, and some ten of their comrades, remained with\r\nthe lieutenant.\r\n\r\nWhen Jean came up, Rochas was standing beside the bronze statue of\r\nTurenne, making a great effort to remain erect and keep his eyes open.\r\n\'Ah! so it\'s you, corporal. Where are your men?\' he muttered, on\r\nrecognising Jean.\r\n\r\nJean waved his hand as if to say that he did not know; but Pache, from\r\nwhose eyes tears were starting, pointed to Lapoulle, and answered: \'We\r\nare here; there are only we two left--may God take pity on us, it\'s\r\ngetting too dreadful.\'\r\n\r\nLapoulle, the man with the terrible appetite, looked at Jean\'s hands\r\nwith a voracious expression. For some days past he had been disgusted\r\nto find them always empty. Possibly, in his sleepy state, he imagined\r\nthat the corporal had been to fetch the rations. \'Curse it!\' he\r\ngrowled, \'so we\'ve again got to tighten our belts.\'\r\n\r\nWhilst leaning against the railing which inclosed the statue, awaiting\r\norders to sound the assembly, Gaude, the bugler, had gone to sleep,\r\nand slid to the ground, where he was now lying spread out on his back.\r\nOne by one they all succumbed, and with their fists clenched, began\r\nto snore. Sergeant Sapin, his nose contracted and his thin little\r\nface extremely pale, was the only one whose eyes remained wide open,\r\nscanning the horizon of this strange town as though he could there\r\nread his impending fate. On his side, Lieutenant Rochas had given way\r\nto an irresistible desire to sit down, and, crouching on the pavement,\r\nhe endeavoured to give an order: \'Corporal,\' he said, \'you must, you\r\nmust----\' But his tongue, clogged by fatigue, refused its service, and\r\nall at once he also fell back, overwhelmed with weariness.\r\n\r\nThereupon Jean, afraid lest he should fall on the pavement like the\r\nothers, went off, still obstinately bent on finding a bed. At one\r\nof the windows of the Golden Cross Hotel, on the other side of the\r\nPlace, he had just espied General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, already in\r\nhis shirt sleeves, and about to slip between a pair of clean white\r\nsheets. As that was the course which the generals adopted, what use\r\nwas there in being zealous, in suffering any longer? And suddenly\r\nJean felt overjoyed, for a name had come to him from the depths of\r\nhis memory, the name of the cloth manufacturer who employed Maurice\'s\r\nbrother-in-law: Monsieur Delaherche!--yes, that was it. An old\r\ngentleman was passing at that moment: \'Can you tell me where Monsieur\r\nDelaherche lives?\' Jean asked him.\r\n\r\n\'In the Rue Maqua, almost at the corner of the Rue au Beurre. It\'s a\r\nbig, handsome house, with a carved front.\' The old man then passed on,\r\nbut all at once he hastened back after Jean, exclaiming: \'I say, you\r\nbelong to the 106th. If you are looking for your regiment, it has left\r\nthe town by way of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau over there. I just met your colonel,\r\nMonsieur de Vineuil, whom I knew very well when he was in garrison at\r\nM\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res.\'\r\n\r\nJean, however, set off again, making a furious gesture of annoyance.\r\nNo, no, he wasn\'t going to lie on the hard ground now that he was\r\ncertain of finding Maurice. And yet, in the depths of his conscience,\r\nhe was worried by a feeling of remorse, for in his mind\'s eye he could\r\nsee the colonel, tall and rigid, indefatigable despite his age, and\r\nalways sleeping under canvas like his men. Busy with such thoughts as\r\nthese, Jean began threading the High Street, and, having lost himself\r\namid the increasing tumult that pervaded the town, he ended by applying\r\nto a little boy, who conducted him to the Rue Maqua.\r\n\r\nIt was here that one of Delaherche\'s grand-uncles had, in the last\r\ncentury, built a monumental factory, which had now been the property\r\nof the family for a hundred and sixty years. Sedan counts several\r\ncloth manufactories, dating from the earlier years of Louis XV., as\r\nlarge as Louvres, and with regally majestic fa\xc3\xa7ades. That in the Rue\r\nMaqua had three storeys of lofty windows framed round with carving of\r\na severe style; and, in the rear of the front building, there was a\r\npalatial courtyard shaded with old trees, gigantic elms dating from\r\nthe foundation of the establishment. Three generations of Delaherches\r\nhad amassed considerable fortunes there, and now it was the younger\r\nbranch of the family that reigned, the father of Jules Delaherche, the\r\npresent owner, having inherited the property from a cousin who had died\r\nchildless. Jules\' father had increased the prosperity of the firm,\r\nbut he was a man of easy morals, and had rendered his wife extremely\r\nunhappy. She, on becoming a widow, had feared lest her son should\r\ntake to the same courses as his father, and after marrying him to a\r\nwoman who was very devout and of very simple tastes, she had sought\r\nto maintain him in a dependent state as though he were a mere youth,\r\nand this till he was over fifty years of age. Life, however, sometimes\r\nhas terrible revenges, and his wife having died, Delaherche, like a\r\nmere stripling, fell in love with a young widow of Charleville, pretty\r\nMadame Maginot, concerning whom there had been no little gossip, but\r\nwhom he had ended by marrying during the previous autumn, despite all\r\nhis mother\'s remonstrances. Sedan, a very puritanical town, has always\r\nlooked down severely on Charleville, the abode of gaiety and festivity.\r\nIt should be said, however, that the marriage would never have taken\r\nplace had Gilberte not been the niece of Colonel de Vineuil, who, so it\r\nseemed, was on the point of becoming a general. This relationship, the\r\nidea of allying himself to a military family, had greatly flattered the\r\nmanufacturer\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 30, having learnt that the army was near\r\nMouzon, Delaherche, in company with Weiss, his book-keeper, had started\r\non that excursion which old Fouchard had referred to in conversation\r\nwith Maurice. Tall and stoutly built, with a ruddy complexion, a large\r\nnose and thick lips, the manufacturer was of an expansive nature,\r\nendowed with all the inquisitiveness of the French _bourgeois_, who\r\nlikes nothing better than a brilliant military display. On learning\r\nfrom the chemist at Mouzon that the Emperor was at Baybel farm, he\r\nhad climbed thither and had seen Napoleon, had almost spoken to him,\r\nhad met, in fact, with quite an adventure, which he had not ceased\r\ntalking about since his return to Sedan. But the homeward journey in\r\nthe midst of the Beaumont panic, along the roads crowded with runaways,\r\nhad been truly terrible. A score of times had the gig narrowly missed\r\nbeing upset in the wayside ditches; and delayed over and over again\r\nby constantly recurring obstacles, Delaherche and Weiss had only got\r\nback to Sedan at nightfall. The pleasure trip ended, indeed, in a most\r\nunpleasant fashion; the army, which the manufacturer had gone to see,\r\nmarching along a couple of leagues away, drove him home again with\r\nthe gallop of its retreat, and this unforeseen, tragical adventure\r\nso exercised his mind that on the road back he kept on repeating to\r\nhis companion: \'And to think that I fancied the army was marching on\r\nVerdun--that was why I didn\'t want to miss the opportunity of seeing\r\nit. Well, I have seen it, and no mistake; and I fancy we shall see\r\nrather more of it at Sedan than will be altogether pleasant.\'\r\n\r\nAwakened at five o\'clock the next morning by the loud commotion of\r\nthe Seventh Corps streaming torrent-like through the town, he hastily\r\ndressed himself and went out; and the first person whom he met on the\r\nPlace Turenne was none other than Captain Beaudoin. During the previous\r\nyear, the captain had been one of the intimates of pretty Madame\r\nMaginot at Charleville; and she had introduced him to Delaherche prior\r\nto their marriage. According to the scandal-mongers, the captain, who\r\nwas considered to be the lady\'s favoured admirer, had retired through a\r\nfeeling of delicacy, not wishing to stand between his inamorata and the\r\nmanufacturer\'s large fortune.\r\n\r\n\'What! is it you?\' exclaimed Delaherche, as he encountered him on the\r\nPlace. \'Good heavens! What a state you are in!\'\r\n\r\nThe captain, usually so correct and spruce in his get-up, was now\r\nindeed in a pitiable condition. Not only was his uniform sadly soiled,\r\nbut his face and hands were black. He had arrived from Remilly in the\r\ncompany of some Turcos, and was exasperated at having lost his company,\r\nhow he could not tell. Like all the others, he was dying of hunger and\r\nfatigue, but this caused him far less distress than the circumstance\r\nthat he had been unable to change his linen since leaving Rheims.\r\n\r\n\'Just fancy!\' he immediately whimpered, \'my baggage got lost at\r\nVouziers--lost by some idiots or other; some rascals whose heads I\'d\r\nbreak if I could only get hold of them. And I\'ve nothing left; not a\r\nhandkerchief, not a pair of socks even. \'Pon my honour, it\'s enough to\r\ndrive a man mad!\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche at once insisted on taking him home. But Beaudoin resisted.\r\nNo, no, he no longer looked like a human being, and he did not wish\r\nto frighten people. The manufacturer then had to give him his word of\r\nhonour that neither his mother nor his wife was up. Besides, he would\r\nsupply him with water, soap and linen, in fact, everything he might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nSeven o\'clock was striking when Captain Beaudoin, after a wash and\r\na brush, made his entry into the lofty, grey-panelled dining room,\r\nwearing one of Delaherche\'s shirts under his uniform. Madame Delaherche\r\nsenior was already there, for she invariably rose at dawn, despite her\r\neight-and-seventy years. Her hair was quite white, and she had a long,\r\nthin face, with a slender, pointed nose, and a mouth that no longer\r\nsmiled. She rose from her chair and showed herself extremely polite,\r\ninviting the captain to seat himself in front of one of the cups of\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9-au-lait that were already placed on the table. \'But perhaps,\r\nmonsieur,\' said she, \'you would prefer some meat and wine after so much\r\nfatigue?\'\r\n\r\nHe protested the contrary: \'Many thanks, madame, but a little milk and\r\nsome bread and butter will suit me best.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment a door was gaily opened, and Gilberte came in with her\r\nhand outstretched. Delaherche must have informed her that the captain\r\nwas there, for as a rule she was never out of bed before ten o\'clock.\r\nShe was tall and seemingly strong and supple, with beautiful black\r\nhair, beautiful black eyes, a rosy complexion, and smiling mien; hers\r\nwas a somewhat giddy nature no doubt, but evidently there was not a\r\ngrain of malice in her composition. She wore a beige morning wrapper\r\nembroidered with purple silk, which had undoubtedly come from Paris.\r\n\'Ah! captain,\' she said eagerly, as she shook hands with the young\r\nman, \'how kind of you to have paid a visit to our poor little nook in\r\nthe provinces.\' Then, the first to laugh at her own thoughtlessness,\r\nshe added: \'Ah! what a stupid I am! Of course you would rather not be\r\nat Sedan under such sad circumstances. But I am so pleased to see you\r\nagain.\'\r\n\r\nHer eyes, indeed, were sparkling with pleasure, and Madame\r\nDelaherche, senior, who was doubtless acquainted with the Charleville\r\ntittle-tattle, gazed fixedly at both of them with a rigid air. The\r\ncaptain behaved very discreetly, however, as though simply retaining a\r\npleasant recollection of an hospitable house where in past times he had\r\nbeen cordially welcomed.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to breakfast, and Delaherche immediately reverted to\r\nhis excursion of the previous day, unable to resist the desire that\r\npossessed him to relate his adventures once more. \'I saw the Emperor\r\nat Baybel,\' he began, and, thus started, nothing could stop him. First\r\ncame a description of the farm, a large square building, with an inner\r\ncourt inclosed by iron railings, and perched on a hillock overlooking\r\nMouzon, on the left of the road leading to Carignan. Then he reverted\r\nto the Twelfth Army Corps, through which he had passed whilst it was\r\ncamping among the vines on the slopes. Superb troops were these,\r\nlooking quite brilliant in the sunshine, and the sight of them had\r\nfilled his heart with patriotic delight.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he continued, \'I was standing there, when all at once the\r\nEmperor came out of the farm--he had halted there to rest and\r\nbreakfast. Although the sun was very hot, he wore an overcoat over his\r\ngeneral\'s uniform. There was a servant walking behind him with a camp\r\nstool. Ah! he didn\'t look at all well, no, that he didn\'t; he was quite\r\nbent, and walked as if in pain; his face was yellow, too--altogether\r\nhe seemed very ill. But I wasn\'t surprised at it, for when the chemist\r\nat Mouzon suggested to me that I ought go on to Baybel, he told me\r\nthat one of the imperial aides-de-camp had just been to him for some\r\nmedicine for----you understand what I mean----\' The presence of his\r\nmother and his wife prevented him from referring more explicitly to\r\nthe dysentery from which the Emperor had been suffering since his\r\ndeparture from Le Ch\xc3\xaane, and which had constantly compelled him to halt\r\nat the farms scattered along his route. \'Well,\' continued Delaherche,\r\n\'the servant opened the camp-stool at the end of a cornfield, near\r\na plantation, and then the Emperor sat down. He sat there stock\r\nstill, half crouching, like some petty cit warming his rheumatics in\r\nthe sunshine. And those mournful eyes of his wandered all over the\r\nhorizon--there was the Meuse flowing through the valley down below;\r\nwooded hills stretched far away in front of him; there were the crests\r\nof the woods of Dieulet on the left, and the green hills of Sommauthe\r\nrising up on the right. Several aides-de-camp and officers of high rank\r\ngathered round him, and a colonel of Dragoons--who, a little while\r\nbefore, had asked me for some information about the district--had just\r\nmade me a sign not to go away, when, all at once----\'\r\n\r\nAt this point Delaherche rose up, for he was coming to the dramatic\r\npart of his narrative, and wished to enforce his words with pantomime.\r\n\'All at once,\' he continued, \'I heard several loud reports, and, right\r\nin front of me, just in advance of the woods of Dieulet, I saw some\r\nshells describing curves in the air. \'Pon my word it was just like\r\nfireworks let off in broad daylight. I heard a lot of exclamations\r\namong the Emperor\'s party. Naturally they all seemed very anxious. The\r\ncolonel of Dragoons whom I mentioned just now came running up to me\r\nagain, and asked me if I could tell where the fighting was going on. I\r\nanswered at once: "It\'s at Beaumont; there\'s not the least doubt about\r\nit." Then he went back to the Emperor, on whose knees an aide-de-camp\r\nwas unfolding a map. The Emperor, however, wouldn\'t believe that the\r\nfighting was at Beaumont. But, of course, I could only repeat what I\r\nhad said, especially as one could see the shells careering through\r\nthe air, coming nearer and nearer, right along the road to Mouzon.\r\nThen, just as I see you, captain, I saw the Emperor turn his pale face\r\ntowards me. Yes, he looked at me for a moment with those dim eyes of\r\nhis, full of distrust and sadness. And then he let his head drop over\r\nhis map once more, and didn\'t move again.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche, an ardent Bonapartist at the time of the Plebiscitum,\r\nhad been willing to admit since the earlier reverses that the Empire\r\nhad erred in various ways. But he still defended the dynasty and\r\npitied Napoleon III., whom everybody deceived. According to him the\r\npeople, who were really responsible for the disasters of France, were\r\nthe deputies of the Republican Opposition, who had prevented the\r\nLegislature from voting the necessary men and credits.\r\n\r\n\'And the Emperor went back to the farm?\' asked Captain Beaudoin.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I really don\'t know; I left him sitting on the camp-stool. It\r\nwas midday, and the battle was coming nearer and nearer, and I had\r\nbegun to feel anxious about getting home again. The only thing I can\r\nadd is that a general to whom I pointed out Carignan some way off in\r\nthe plain behind us, appeared thunderstruck when I told him that the\r\nBelgian frontier was only a few miles away. Ah! that poor Emperor, he\r\nhas some nice generals, and no mistake.\'\r\n\r\nWhilst her husband was discoursing in this fashion, Gilberte, smiling,\r\nand as much at her ease as though she were still a widow in her\r\ndrawing-room at Charleville, was busy attending to the captain\'s\r\nrequirements, passing him the toast, the butter, and whatever else he\r\nneeded. She pressed him to accept a room and go to bed, but he declined\r\nthis, and it was arranged that he should merely take a couple of hours\'\r\nrest on a sofa, in Delaherche\'s study, before rejoining his regiment.\r\nJust as he was taking the sugar basin from Gilberte\'s hands, old Madame\r\nDelaherche, who kept her eyes fixed on the young couple, distinctly saw\r\nthem press each other\'s finger-tips; and after that she no longer had\r\nany doubts.\r\n\r\nJust then, however, a servant entered the room: \'There\'s a soldier\r\ndownstairs, sir, who is asking for Monsieur Weiss\'s address.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche was not at all stuck-up; with a garrulous taste for\r\npopularity he was fond of chatting with the poor and the humble.\r\n\'Weiss\'s address?\' said he. \'That\'s funny--send the soldier here!\'\r\n\r\nJean entered, so worn-out that he was fairly staggering. He started\r\nwith surprise on perceiving his captain seated at table between two\r\nladies, and drew back his hand, which he had already thrust forward in\r\na mechanical way so that he might support himself by grasping a chair.\r\nThen he briefly answered the questions put to him by the manufacturer,\r\nwho began playing the good-natured fellow, the soldier\'s friend. In a\r\nfew words Jean explained his intimacy with Maurice, and the reason why\r\nhe wished to find him.\r\n\r\n\'This is a corporal of my company,\' at last said the captain by way of\r\ncurtailing the explanations, and in his turn he began to question Jean,\r\nwishing to ascertain what had become of the regiment. And when Jean\r\nrelated that the colonel, and such men as remained with him, had just\r\nbeen seen crossing the town for the purpose of camping on the northern\r\nside, Gilberte again spoke over hastily, with the vivacity of a pretty\r\nwoman who seldom takes the trouble to reflect: \'My uncle? Oh! why\r\ndidn\'t he come to breakfast here? We would have had a room got ready\r\nfor him. Suppose we send for him?\'\r\n\r\nBut Madame Delaherche, senior, waved her hand with a gesture of\r\nsovereign authority. The blood of the old burgesses of the frontier\r\ncities coursed in her veins; she was endowed with all the masculine\r\nvirtues of rigid patriotism; and she only broke her uncompromising\r\nsilence to exclaim: \'Let Monsieur de Vineuil remain where he is; he is\r\ndoing his duty.\'\r\n\r\nThis made the others feel uncomfortable, and Delaherche carried the\r\ncaptain away into his study that he might rest, as arranged, upon\r\nthe sofa there; whilst Gilberte, on her side, without heeding her\r\nmother-in-law\'s lesson, went off like a bird shaking its wings, as\r\nblithe and as gay as ever, despite the storm. Meanwhile, the servant to\r\nwhose care Jean had been committed conducted him across the yard of the\r\nfactory, and through a maze of passages and staircases.\r\n\r\nWeiss lived in the Rue des Voyards, but the house, which belonged to\r\nDelaherche, communicated in the rear with the monumental edifice in\r\nthe Rue Maqua. The Rue des Voyards was then one of the most confined\r\nstreets in Sedan, being, in fact, simply a narrow, damp lane, darkened\r\nby the high rampart which it skirted. The eaves of the lofty frontages\r\nalmost touched one another, and the passages were as black as vaults,\r\nespecially at the end where rose the high college wall. Weiss, however,\r\noccupying a third floor, rent and firing free, found himself quite\r\ncomfortable there, especially as he was so near his office, whither he\r\ncould betake himself in his slippers without having to appear in the\r\nstreets. He was a happy man since he had married Henriette, whom he had\r\nlong desired to make his wife at the time when he had known her at Le\r\nCh\xc3\xaane, at the house of her father, the tax collector, whose housewife\r\nshe had been since she was six years old, having had to take the place\r\nof the mother who had died in giving her birth. Weiss, meantime,\r\nhad obtained a situation at the local refinery, almost in a menial\r\ncapacity, but he had gradually educated himself, and raised himself, by\r\ndint of hard work, to the position of accountant. Yet he only succeeded\r\nin realising his dream through the death of Henriette\'s father and the\r\nfolly of her brother Maurice, whose servant she had in some measure\r\nbecome, sacrificing herself in the hope of making a gentleman of him.\r\nBrought up like a little Cinderella, knowing how to read and write,\r\nbut nothing more, she had just sold the old house and the furniture,\r\nwithout, however, realising sufficient to defray the cost of Maurice\'s\r\nfolly, when Weiss, the worthy fellow, came forward and offered her all\r\nhe possessed, including his strong arms and his heart, and she had\r\nconsented to marry him, touched to tears by his affection and--calm,\r\nvirtuous, reasoning little woman that she was--penetrated with tender\r\nesteem for him, in default of passionate love. And now fortune was\r\nsmiling on them, for Delaherche had talked of giving Weiss an interest\r\nin the business, and their happiness would be complete as soon as\r\nchildren were born to them.\r\n\r\n\'Take care,\' said the servant to Jean; \'the stairs are very steep.\'\r\n\r\nThe corporal, indeed, was stumbling up the flights in profound\r\ndarkness, but all at once a door was hastily flung open, and a ray of\r\nlight streamed over the steps. Then he heard a gentle voice exclaiming,\r\n\'It is he.\'\r\n\r\n\'Madame Weiss,\' called the servant, \'here\'s a soldier asking for you.\'\r\n\r\nA gay little laugh resounded, the laugh of one who is well pleased, and\r\nthe gentle voice replied: \'All right, I know who it is.\'\r\n\r\nThen as the corporal, stifling and ill at ease, stopped short on\r\nthe landing, the voice continued: \'Come in, Monsieur Jean. Maurice\r\nhas been here a couple of hours, and we have been waiting for you so\r\nimpatiently!\'\r\n\r\nThen, in the pale light of the room he entered, Jean saw Henriette, and\r\nat once noticed her striking likeness to Maurice, that extraordinary\r\nresemblance common between twins that seems to make each of them the\r\nother\'s double. Her beautiful fair hair was of the light tint of ripe\r\noats, and excepting that her mouth appeared somewhat large her features\r\nwere small and delicate. She was, however, shorter than her brother,\r\nand still more slight and frail of build. But it was especially her\r\ngrey eyes that distinguished her from Maurice--her calm, brave, grey\r\neyes from which shone forth such another heroic soul as that of her\r\ngrandfather, the hero of the Grand Army. She spoke but little, moved\r\nabout noiselessly, and displayed such skilful, activity, such smiling\r\ngentleness, that she imparted a caress as it were to the atmosphere in\r\nwhich she lived.\r\n\r\n\'Here, come in here, Monsieur Jean,\' she repeated. \'Everything will be\r\nready directly.\'\r\n\r\nHe stammered a reply, unable to express his thanks in the emotion\r\nhe felt at being welcomed in such a brotherly manner. Moreover, his\r\neyelids were closing, and in the irresistible drowsiness that had\r\nseized hold of him, he saw her through a kind of film, a mist in which\r\nshe appeared to be vaguely floating without touching the ground. Was\r\nthis kindly young woman, who smiled at him with so much simplicity,\r\nmerely a charming apparition then? For a moment he had his doubts on\r\nthe subject. However, it certainly seemed to him that she took hold of\r\nhis hand, and that he could feel hers, small and firm, loyal, like the\r\nhand of an old friend.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment Jean lost all precise consciousness of what took\r\nplace. They were in the dining-room, it seemed, there was meat and\r\nbread on the table, but he lacked the strength to carry the morsels\r\nto his mouth. A man was seated on a chair there, and at last he\r\nrecognised Weiss, whom he had previously seen at Mulhausen. He failed\r\nto understand, however, what Weiss was saying with a sorrowful air and\r\nslow despondent gestures. As for Maurice, he was already asleep, lying\r\nmotionless, like one dead, on a trestle-bedstead in front of the stove.\r\nAnd Henriette was busy with a divan, on which a mattress had already\r\nbeen thrown. She brought a bolster, a pillow, and blankets, and with\r\nready skilful hands she spread out a pair of white sheets, beautiful\r\nsheets, white like snow.\r\n\r\nOh! those white sheets, those white sheets so ardently coveted! Jean\r\nhad eyes for nothing else. He had not undressed and slept in a bed\r\nfor six weeks, and he experienced a gluttonous craving, a childish\r\nimpatience, an irresistible longing to slip in between all that\r\nwhiteness and freshness, and lose himself in the midst of it. And, as\r\nsoon as he had been left alone, a few seconds sufficed him to undress;\r\nin a trice he was in his shirt, barefooted, and popped into bed and\r\nsatisfied his desire, grunting the while like a contented animal.\r\nThe pale morning light was streaming into the room through the lofty\r\nwindow, and as, already half asleep, he partially reopened his eyes,\r\nthere came to him another apparition of Henriette, less distinct, more\r\nimmaterial than the first. It seemed to him that she glided into the\r\nroom on tip-toe, and placed a water decanter and a glass, which she\r\nhad forgotten, on the table near him, and he fancied that she remained\r\nthere for a few seconds looking at both of them, her brother and\r\nhimself, with that quiet smile of hers, full of infinite kindness. Then\r\nshe vanished, and Jean, overwhelmed, fell fast asleep between the white\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nHours, years flowed past. Jean and Maurice no longer existed, not a\r\ndream broke upon their slumbers. They were unconscious of everything,\r\neven of the slight beating of their pulses. Ten years or ten minutes,\r\nwhatever the lapse of time they could not count it; this was the\r\nrevenge, as it were, of their jaded bodies, reaping satisfaction in the\r\nannihilation of their entire beings. Then, all at once, starting at\r\nthe same moment, both of them awoke. Hallo! what was the matter, how\r\nlong had they been asleep? The same pale light was streaming through\r\nthe lofty window. They still felt extenuated, their joints had become\r\nstiffened, their limbs seemed more wearied, the bitter taste in their\r\nmouths was more pronounced than when they had gone to bed. Fortunately,\r\nthey could only have slept an hour or so, and they were in no wise\r\nsurprised to see Weiss seated in the same chair as before, and in the\r\nsame despondent attitude, as though he had been waiting for them to\r\nawaken.\r\n\r\n\'Dash it!\' stammered Jean. \'All the same, we must get up, for we must\r\njoin the regiment before noon.\' Then, with a slight cry of pain, he\r\nsprang on to the tiled floor, and began to dress.\r\n\r\n\'Before noon?\' answered Weiss; \'why, it\'s seven o\'clock; you\'ve been\r\nsleeping for twelve hours or so.\'\r\n\r\nSeven o\'clock: good heavens! They were thunderstruck. Jean, hastily\r\ndressing, wished to rush off at once, whilst Maurice, who was still in\r\nbed, complained dolefully that he could not move his legs. How should\r\nthey find their comrades? The army must have gone off long ago, and\r\nthey both became quite angry, complaining that they ought not to have\r\nbeen allowed to sleep so long.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! you did just as well to stay in bed, for nothing has been done,\'\r\nreplied Weiss, with a despondent gesture.\r\n\r\nHe had been scouring Sedan and the environs since the morning, and\r\nhad returned home only a short time previously in despair at the\r\ninaction of the troops during this precious 31st of August, which had\r\nbeen entirely lost--consumed in inexplicable waiting. There was only\r\none possible excuse for it all--the extreme weariness of the men,\r\ntheir absolute need of rest--but, granting that, it was difficult to\r\nunderstand why the retreat had not been resumed as soon as the troops\r\nhad secured the necessary modicum of sleep.\r\n\r\n\'For my part,\' resumed Weiss, \'I don\'t pretend to be an authority on\r\nthese matters, but I instinctively feel, yes, I feel that the army\r\nis very badly situated here at Sedan. The Twelfth Corps is posted at\r\nBazeilles, where there was a little fighting this morning, the First is\r\nranged along the Givonne from La Moncelle to the wood of La Garenne,\r\nwhilst the Seventh is camping on the plateau of Floing, and the Fifth,\r\nhalf destroyed, is heaped up under the very ramparts, on the side of\r\nthe Ch\xc3\xa2teau--and it frightens me to know that they are all ranged like\r\nthat round the town, waiting for the Prussians. For my part I should\r\nhave been off, and at once, in the direction of M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res. I know the\r\ncountry; there\'s no other possible line of retreat; you can\'t go\r\nfarther north or you\'ll be thrown into Belgium--besides, come here--I\r\nwant to show you something.\' Taking Jean by the hand he led him to the\r\nwindow. \'Look over there, on the hill-tops,\' he added.\r\n\r\nDominating the ramparts and the neighbouring buildings, the window\r\noverlooked the valley of the Meuse on the southern side of Sedan. There\r\nwas the river winding through the expanse of meadow land; Remilly rose\r\nup on the left, Pont-Maugis and Wadelincourt were just in front, and\r\nFr\xc3\xa9nois was on the right. There, too, were the hills, displaying their\r\ngreen slopes, first the Liry hill, then the Marf\xc3\xa9e, the Croix-Piau,\r\nall crowned with large woods. In the declining daylight the vast\r\nhorizon was invested with infinite softness, a crystalline limpidity.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you see those black lines on the march along the hill-tops, over\r\nthere, those black ants swarming past?\'\r\n\r\nJean opened his eyes wide, whilst Maurice, kneeling on his bed, craned\r\nhis neck forward. \'Ah! yes,\' they both exclaimed, at the same moment,\r\n\'There\'s one line, there\'s another, another--they are everywhere!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' resumed Weiss, \'those are the Prussians--I\'ve been looking at\r\nthem ever since the morning, and they pass and pass without cessation.\r\nIf our soldiers are waiting for them you may be pretty sure that they\r\nare making all haste to arrive, and all the townsfolk have seen them\r\nthe same as I have. It\'s only our generals who seem to have become\r\nblind. A little while ago I was talking to a general who shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and told me that Marshal MacMahon was positive that he\r\nonly had some seventy thousand men to deal with. God grant that his\r\ninformation be correct!--But just look at them; look at them, the\r\nground is covered with them and still and ever they swarm and swarm!\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maurice threw himself back on his bed and burst into\r\nloud sobs. Henriette had just entered the room with the same smiling\r\nair that she had worn during the morning. But at sight of Maurice she\r\nfelt alarmed, and hastily approached him. \'What is the matter?\'\r\n\r\nHe waved her back, however. \'No, no, leave me, I have never brought you\r\nanything but sorrow. When I think that you used to deprive yourself of\r\ndresses, and that I was sent to college! Ah! a precious lot of good\r\nmy education has done me! And then I almost dishonoured our name, and\r\nHeaven alone knows where I should be at the present time if you hadn\'t\r\nbled yourself in every vein to repair my folly!\'\r\n\r\nShe was again smiling in her peaceful way: \'You certainly haven\'t woke\r\nup in a good humour, my dear fellow,\' she replied. \'You know very well\r\nthat all that is blotted out, forgotten. Aren\'t you now doing your duty\r\nas a Frenchman? I\'m quite proud of you since you\'ve enlisted; I assure\r\nyou I am.\'\r\n\r\nShe had turned towards Jean as though to summon him to her assistance.\r\nHe was gazing at her, somewhat surprised to find that she did not look\r\nso pretty as he had thought her in the morning. She seemed slighter\r\nand paler now that he no longer saw her with the hallucinatory vision\r\nof his weariness. Her likeness to her brother remained very striking,\r\nhowever, although, at this moment, the difference in their natures was\r\nmade plainly manifest; he, nervous like a woman, stricken with the\r\ndisease of the period, a prey to the historical, social crisis of the\r\nrace, capable of rising at one moment to the noblest enthusiasm, and\r\nof falling, the next, to the most abject despair; she, so small and\r\nslight, as unobtrusive as a Cinderella, with the air of a resigned\r\nlittle housewife, but albeit displaying an undaunted brow and brave\r\neyes--in a word, the stuff that martyrs are made of.\r\n\r\n\'Proud of me!\' Maurice exclaimed. \'Well, there\'s no reason why you\r\nshould be proud of me. For a month past we have been flying the enemy\r\nlike the cowards we are.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Jean, in his sensible way; \'we are not the only ones--we\r\nsimply do as we are bidden.\'\r\n\r\nBut now the crisis to which the young fellow was a prey burst forth\r\nwith more violence than ever. \'That\'s just it, and I\'ve had my fill of\r\nit. Isn\'t it enough to make one shed tears of blood--these continual\r\ndefeats, these idiotic generals, these soldiers who are stupidly led\r\nto the slaughter-house like flocks of animals? And now, here we are in\r\na blind alley whence there\'s no escape! You can see that the Prussians\r\nare coming up on all sides, and that we are about to be crushed--the\r\narmy is lost! No, no; I shall stay here; I would rather be shot as a\r\ndeserter. You can go away without me, Jean. No! I won\'t go back to the\r\nregiment; I shall stay here!\'\r\n\r\nA fresh flood of tears stretched him on his pillow. This was one of\r\nthose irresistible slackenings of the nerves sweeping everything away,\r\none of those sudden collapses into despair bringing with it contempt\r\nfor everybody, himself included, to which he was so subject. His\r\nsister, who knew him well, remained undisturbed. \'It would be very\r\nwrong, my dear Maurice,\' said she, \'to desert your post at the moment\r\nof danger.\'\r\n\r\nWith a sudden start he sat up in bed: \'Well, give me my gun, then. I\'ll\r\nblow my brains out. Like that it will be sooner over.\' Then, stretching\r\nout his arm and pointing to Weiss, who sat there motionless and silent,\r\nhe added: \'There, he\'s the only sensible one; yes, he alone saw clearly\r\ninto all this--don\'t you remember, Jean, what he said to me a month ago\r\nat Mulhausen?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true,\' the corporal replied; \'this gentleman said we should be\r\nbeaten.\'\r\n\r\nA vision of the scene rose up before him; that anxious night, the long\r\nwaiting fraught with so much anguish, the mournful sky already pregnant\r\nwith the disaster of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, whilst Weiss so quietly expressed\r\nhis fears: Germany ready, better commanded, better armed, sustained by\r\na great outburst of patriotism, and France scared, a prey to disorder,\r\nbehind the times, perverted, having neither the commanders, nor the\r\nmen, nor the arms she needed. And now the fearful prophecy was being\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nWeiss raised his trembling hands. An expression of intense grief had\r\ncome over his good-natured face. \'Ah! I assure you,\' he muttered, \'it\r\ngives me no pleasure at all to find that I was in the right. I am a\r\nmere stupid; but all this was so clear and patent to those who knew\r\nanything at all. At the same time, however, even if we are beaten, we\r\ncan still kill some of those baleful Prussians. That\'s our consolation.\r\nI still think our men will leave their lives here, and I should like\r\nto see the Prussians leave theirs too; yes, I should like to see them\r\nlying in heaps, covering all the ground yonder!\'\r\n\r\nHe had risen to his feet, and he pointed to the valley of the Meuse.\r\nThose large, short-sighted eyes of his which had prevented him from\r\nserving in the army were now illumined by a vivid flame. \'Thunder!\' he\r\nexclaimed, \'yes, I\'d fight readily enough if I were my own master. I\r\ndon\'t know whether it\'s because they are now in possession of my native\r\nprovince, the province where the Cossacks already did such frightful\r\nthings years ago, but I can\'t think of them or picture them in our\r\ncountry and our houses without feeling a furious longing to go and\r\nbleed a dozen of them! Ah! if I hadn\'t been invalided, if I were only a\r\nsoldier!\' Then after a short pause he added: \'But, after all, who can\r\ntell what will happen?\'\r\n\r\nHope inspired those last words, the need which even the least deceived\r\nexperienced of believing that victory was still possible. And Maurice,\r\nalready ashamed of his tears, listened to Weiss, clinging for comfort\r\nto this dream. After all, had it not been reported the previous day\r\nthat Bazaine had reached Verdun? Fortune owed a miracle to that land of\r\nFrance which she had so long endowed with glory.\r\n\r\nHenriette, who had long since relapsed into silence, left the room.\r\nWhen she returned she was in no wise surprised to find her brother\r\ndressed and ready to start. However, she insisted that he and Jean\r\nshould eat something before they went, and they had to take their\r\nplaces at table. But the food seemed to choke them: they were still\r\nheavy after their long slumber, and were troubled with nausea. Jean,\r\nhowever, like a prudent man, divided a loaf and placed one half of it\r\nin Maurice\'s knapsack and the other in his own. The daylight was now\r\nfast waning, and it was necessary they should start. Henriette, who\r\nhad paused beside the window, was gazing at the Prussian troops as\r\nthey crossed the Marf\xc3\xa9e hill--marching on and on without cessation,\r\nbut growing more and more indistinct in the depths of the gathering\r\ndarkness. All at once an involuntary plaint escaped her: \'Oh! war, war,\r\nwhat a horrible thing it is!\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Maurice, promptly taking his revenge, began to twit her.\r\n\'What! my dear girl,\' said he, \'it\'s you who want us to fight, and yet\r\nyou rail at war?\'\r\n\r\nShe turned round, and, looking him in the face, replied, with that\r\nbrave air of hers: \'Yes, I execrate war. I consider it unjust and\r\nabominable. Perhaps it\'s simply because I\'m a woman. But all this\r\nkilling horrifies me. Why can\'t nations discuss matters quietly, and\r\ncome to an understanding?\'\r\n\r\nJean, the good fellow, nodded his head approvingly. To his illiterate\r\nmind nothing seemed easier than for everyone to agree after discussing\r\nthings in a proper spirit. But Maurice, swayed by his scientific\r\ntheories, reflected that war was necessary, that it was life itself,\r\nthe law of the universe. Were not peace and justice the inventions\r\nof compassionate mankind, whereas impassive nature had from all time\r\nbeen the scene of perpetual strife? \'Come to an understanding!\' he\r\nexclaimed. \'Yes, some centuries hence. If all the nations no longer\r\nformed but one, it might be possible to conceive such a golden age,\r\nbut, then, would not the end of war mean the end of humanity? I was\r\nidiotic, just now. One _must_ fight, since such is the law of nature.\'\r\nAt present he was smiling, and he repeated Weiss\'s words: \'After all,\r\nwho can tell what will happen?\' Once more he was swayed by illusions;\r\nhis nervous sensibility, so exaggerated that it was almost a disease,\r\nrequired that he should try to deceive himself. \'By the bye,\' he\r\nremarked, gaily, \'what about Cousin Gunther?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cousin Gunther,\' replied Henriette, \'he belongs to the Prussian Guard.\r\nIs the Guard near here?\'\r\n\r\nWeiss made a gesture, implying that he could not tell, and the two\r\nsoldiers imitated his example. They were unable to answer the question.\r\nTheir generals even did not know what foes they had to contend against.\r\n\r\n\'Well, let\'s get off. I\'ll show you the way,\' said Weiss, \'I learned\r\njust now where the 106th is encamped.\' And then he informed his wife\r\nthat he should not return that night, as he proposed sleeping at\r\nBazeilles, where he had lately purchased a small house, adjoining some\r\ndyeworks belonging to M. Delaherche. He had just finished furnishing\r\nthe place, with the intention of spending the remainder of the summer\r\nthere, and had already stored various provisions in the cellar, a cask\r\nof wine, a couple of sacks of potatoes and other things, concerning\r\nwhich he now expressed anxiety. It was, indeed, certain that the house\r\nwould be pillaged by marauders if it remained unoccupied, but this\r\nhe would probably be able to avert by staying there that night. His\r\nwife looked at him fixedly whilst he was thus speaking. \'Oh! don\'t be\r\nalarmed,\' he added, with a smile, \'I merely want to mount guard over\r\nour few sticks, and if the village should be attacked, if there should\r\nbe the slightest danger, I\'ll come back at once, I promise you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go then,\' she said; \'but mind you come back, or I shall certainly\r\nfetch you.\'\r\n\r\nOn reaching the door she kissed Maurice tenderly, and holding out her\r\nhand to Jean pressed his for a few seconds in a friendly way. \'I\'m\r\nconfiding my brother to you again,\' she said. \'Yes, he has told me how\r\nkind you have been to him, and I like you very much.\'\r\n\r\nJean felt so disturbed that he could find no words to answer her, but\r\ncontented himself with returning the pressure of her small firm hand.\r\nAnd again did he experience the same impression as on his arrival--this\r\nfair-haired Henriette, so lightsome, smiling, and unobtrusive, seemed\r\nas it were to impart a caress to the atmosphere around her.\r\n\r\nDown below they found themselves once more in Sedan, as dank and dark\r\nas in the morning. The twilight was already obscuring the narrow\r\nstreets, where all was bustle and confusion. Most of the shops were\r\nclosed, and the houses seemed bereft of life, but out of doors there\r\nwas a perfect crush. They reached the Place de l\'H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville,\r\nhowever, without any very great difficulty, and there they encountered\r\nM. Delaherche, strolling about like the sightseer he was. He appeared\r\ndelighted on recognising Maurice, and at once related that he had just\r\nbeen conducting Captain Beaudoin towards Floing, where the regiment\r\nwas encamped. And his accustomed satisfaction increased when he learnt\r\nthat Weiss intended to sleep at Bazeilles, for he himself had resolved\r\nto spend the night at his dyeworks there, as, indeed, he had just been\r\ntelling the captain. \'We\'ll go together, Weiss,\' said he. \'But meantime\r\nlet\'s stroll just as far as the Sub-Prefecture; perhaps we shall get a\r\nglimpse of the Emperor.\'\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. was his one preoccupation since he had so narrowly missed\r\nspeaking to him at Baybel, and he talked in such a strain that he ended\r\nby rousing the curiosity of the two soldiers, who decided to follow\r\nhim. Only a few whispering groups were assembled on the Place de la\r\nSous-Pr\xc3\xa9fecture, but from time to time some scared officers dashed by.\r\nThe mournful dimness was already darkening the trees, and one could\r\nhear the loud noise made by the Meuse as it flowed along at the foot\r\nof the houses on the right hand. Some of the assembled people were\r\nrelating that the Emperor--who had only been induced with difficulty\r\nto leave Carignan at eleven o\'clock the previous night--had positively\r\nrefused to push on to M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, as he wished to remain on the scene of\r\ndanger, so as not to demoralise the troops. Others asserted, however,\r\nthat he was no longer at Sedan, that he had fled, leaving one of his\r\nlieutenants behind to personate him--an officer who had donned his\r\nuniform, and who was so remarkably like him that the entire army was\r\ndeceived. Others, again, gave their word of honour that they had seen\r\nseveral vehicles, containing the imperial treasure (a hundred millions\r\nof francs in brand-new gold napoleons), drive into the grounds of\r\nthe Sub-Prefecture. But the vehicles in question were simply those\r\nof the Emperor\'s household, the char-\xc3\xa0-bancs, the two calashes,\r\nand the twelve vans, the sight of which had so revolutionised the\r\nvillages, Courcelles, Le Ch\xc3\xaane and Raucourt, and the number of which\r\nrumour had so exaggerated that in the popular imagination they had\r\nbecome an immense train, obstructing the roads to such a degree that\r\nthey arrested the progress of the entire army. And now, accursed and\r\nshameful, they, had at last stranded at Sedan, hidden from all eyes by\r\nthe Sub-Prefect\'s lilac bushes.\r\n\r\nWhilst Delaherche, rising on tip-toe, was examining the ground-floor\r\nwindows of the Sub-Prefect\'s abode, an old woman--who stood near\r\nhim--some poor journey-woman of the neighbourhood, with a bent frame\r\nand distorted hands consumed by toil, mumbled between her teeth: \'An\r\nEmperor, well, I should like to get a squint at one, just to see what\r\nhe\'s like.\'\r\n\r\nAt that very moment Delaherche, catching hold of Maurice\'s arm,\r\nexclaimed: \'There--that\'s him--there, look, at the window on the\r\nleft. Oh! there\'s no mistake about it. I recognise him perfectly;\r\nI was so near him yesterday, you know. He has pulled back the\r\ncurtain--yes--there--that pale face against the window-pane.\'\r\n\r\nThe old woman heard these words, and stood there gazing. Close to the\r\nwindow-pane, as Delaherche had said, she could see a cadaverous-looking\r\nface with dim eyes, distorted features, and moustaches which seemed to\r\nhave blanched in the throes of this last, long agony. Quite stupefied,\r\nthe old woman immediately turned round and went off, making a gesture\r\nof superlative contempt: \'That an Emperor? Ugh, the ugly beast!\'\r\n\r\nA Zouave stood near by, one of those disbanded soldiers who evinced\r\nno haste to join their regiments. He was brandishing his chassepot,\r\nswearing and expectorating threats, and all at once he exclaimed to a\r\ncomrade: \'Wait a second, I\'ll put a bullet into his head.\'\r\n\r\nThis made Delaherche quite indignant, and he intervened; but Napoleon\r\nhad already disappeared. The loud rush of the Meuse was still\r\nresounding; a plaint of infinite sadness seemed to have sped by in the\r\ngrowing dimness. From afar off came the muttering of other scattered\r\nnoises. Was it the echo of the terrible order, \'March! march!\' shouted\r\nfrom Paris, the order that had impelled this man on and on, from\r\nhalting-place to halting-place, dragging with him along the highways\r\nof defeat all the irony of his imperial escort, and now brought to a\r\nstand, confronted by the frightful disaster that he had foreseen and\r\nhad come to meet. Ah! how many brave fellows were about to die through\r\nhis fault, and how profoundly must he have been stirred in every corner\r\nof his being--he, the sick man, the sentimental dreamer, so silently\r\nand mournfully waiting for destiny!\r\n\r\nWeiss and Delaherche accompanied the two soldiers as far as the plateau\r\nof Floing. \'Farewell!\' said Maurice, as he embraced his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\'No, no, till we meet again!\' gaily exclaimed the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nJean, with his keen scent, at once found the 106th, whose tents were\r\npitched on the slope of the plateau, behind the cemetery. Night had now\r\nalmost completely fallen, but one could still distinguish the dark,\r\nmassy roofs of the town, beyond which were Balan and Bazeilles in the\r\nmeadows that stretched as far as the range of hills from Remilly to\r\nFr\xc3\xa9nois; whilst on the left extended a black patch, the wood of La\r\nGarenne, and on the right, down below, glittered the Meuse, like a\r\nbroad, pale ribbon. For a moment Maurice scanned the vast horizon as it\r\nfaded away in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! here\'s the corporal!\' exclaimed Chouteau; \'has he come back from\r\nrations?\'\r\n\r\nThere was some little commotion. All day long the men had been\r\nrejoining their regiments, some of them quite alone, others in little\r\nparties, and amid such a scramble that the officers had even renounced\r\nasking for explanations. Indeed, they closed their eyes, only too glad\r\nto welcome those who chose to come back. Moreover, Captain Beaudoin had\r\narrived but a short time previously, and it was only at two o\'clock\r\nthat Lieutenant Rochas had reached the camp, having with him merely a\r\nthird of the men of his disbanded company. The latter, however, was now\r\nalmost complete again. Some of the men were drunk, whilst others were\r\nstill famished, not having managed to obtain even a scrap of bread; for\r\nthere had again been no distribution of rations. Loubet had certainly\r\nendeavoured to cook some cabbages, pulled up out of a neighbouring\r\ngarden, but he had neither salt nor lard to make the vegetables\r\npalatable, and the men\'s stomachs were still groaning with hunger.\r\n\r\n\'Come, corporal, what have you brought, you who are so artful?\' resumed\r\nChouteau, in a bantering way; \'oh! I don\'t need anything myself; Loubet\r\nand I lunched in capital style at a lady\'s.\'\r\n\r\nAnxious faces were turned towards Jean, the squad had been waiting for\r\nhim--especially those unlucky fellows, Lapoulle and Pache--for they had\r\nnot managed to get a bite, and they had relied on him, in the belief\r\nthat if need were he could actually extract flour from mill stones.\r\nAnd Jean, moved to pity, filled with remorse at the thought that he\r\nhad abandoned his men, divided between them the half-loaf which he\r\nhad placed in his knapsack before leaving Weiss\'s house. \'Curse it!\r\ncurse it!\' repeated Lapoulle, finding no other words to express the\r\nsatisfaction with which he devoured the bread; whilst Pache mumbled a\r\n_Pater_ and an _Ave_, so as to make sure that Heaven would send him\r\nhis daily food again on the morrow.\r\n\r\nBugler Gaude had just blown a sonorous blast, the summons to the\r\nroll-call. There was no tattoo however; the camp at once sank into\r\ndeep silence. And when Sergeant Sapin, with the thin, sickly face and\r\nthe contracted nose, had found that his half-section was complete, he\r\ngently remarked: \'Some of them will be missing to-morrow night.\' Then,\r\nnoticing that Jean was looking at him, he added with an air of tranquil\r\ncertainty, gazing the while into the darkness with dreamy eyes: \'Oh!\r\nfor my part I shall be killed to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\'clock. The night threatened to be very cold, for a great\r\ndeal of mist had risen from the Meuse, hiding the stars from view.\r\nMaurice shivered as he lay beside Jean under a hedge, and suggested\r\nthat it would perhaps be better for them to turn into the tent. Worn\r\nout, however, aching in every limb since their rest at Weiss\'s,\r\nneither of them was able to get to sleep. They envied Lieutenant\r\nRochas, who, disdaining any shelter and simply wrapped in a blanket,\r\nwas snoring like a hero on the damp ground near them. Then, for a\r\nlong time they fixed their attention on the little, flickering flame\r\nof a candle, burning in a large tent where the colonel and a few\r\nofficers were sitting up. M. de Vineuil had seemed very anxious all\r\nthe evening at not receiving any orders for the following day. He\r\nfelt that his regiment was quite adrift, still far too much to the\r\nfront, though he had already fallen back some distance, relinquishing\r\nthe advanced position that he had taken up in the morning. General\r\nBourgain-Desfeuilles had not shown himself; he was said to be ill in\r\nbed at the Golden Cross Hotel, and the colonel had at last decided to\r\nsend an officer to warn him that the new position appeared a dangerous\r\none; the Seventh Corps being so scattered, having far too long a line\r\nto defend, from the bend of the Meuse to the wood of La Garenne. The\r\nbattle would certainly begin at dawn. They now had only seven or eight\r\nhours of that deep, black peacefulness before them. At last the candle\r\nin the colonel\'s tent was extinguished, and at that moment Maurice was\r\ngreatly surprised to see Captain Beaudoin pass by, furtively skirting\r\nthe hedge, and vanishing in the direction of Sedan.\r\n\r\nThe night was becoming more and more dense, the mass of vapour that had\r\nascended from the river obscured it with a gloomy fog. \'Are you awake,\r\nJean?\' asked Maurice.\r\n\r\nJean was sleeping, and Maurice was now quite alone. The idea of joining\r\nLapoulle and the others in the tent was somehow repugnant to him, yet\r\nhe envied them as he heard them snoring, in response, as it were,\r\nto Rochas. Then he reflected that if great captains sometimes sleep\r\nso soundly on the eve of battle it is simply because they are very\r\ntired. He could now only hear the breath of slumber, a widespread,\r\ngentle breathing, rising from all the vast camp plunged in darkness.\r\nEverything was obliterated from view; he was simply aware that the\r\nFifth Corps must be encamped somewhere near them, under the ramparts,\r\nthat the First was stretched from the wood of La Garenne to the village\r\nof La Moncelle, whilst the Twelfth occupied Bazeilles, on the other\r\nside of Sedan; and all were sleeping--from the depths of the darkness,\r\nmore than a league away, from the first to the last tent passed the\r\nslow palpitation of slumber. Then, too, sounds were wafted to him at\r\nintervals from afar off, where all was so mysterious--sounds so light\r\nand distant that they seemed like a simple buzzing in the ears--the\r\nfaint gallop of cavalry, the low, dull rumbling of guns, and especially\r\nthe heavy tramping of men, the march along the hill-tops of the great,\r\nblack, human swarm, the invasion and envelopment which even night\r\nitself had not been able to stay. And, over yonder, were there not\r\nflashes suddenly bursting on the darkness and then expiring, voices\r\nwhich shrieked forth here and there, increasing all the anguish that\r\nprevailed during that last night, in the fear-fraught waiting for the\r\ndawn?\r\n\r\nWith fumbling fingers Maurice sought Jean\'s hand and clasped it. Then\r\nonly did he feel reassured and fall asleep. Nothing now remained awake,\r\nsave a steeple of Sedan, whose clock struck, one by one, the fateful\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n_THE BATTLE OF SEDAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK ON BAZEILLES--THE EMPEROR UNDER FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nWeiss was fast asleep in his little room at Bazeilles, where all\r\nwas dark, when a sudden disturbance made him spring out of bed. He\r\nlistened, and heard the roar of cannon. Groping for the candle, he\r\nlighted it, and on looking at his watch found it was four o\'clock;\r\nthe dawn was scarcely breaking. He hastily put on his eye-glasses\r\nand scanned the high street--the Douzy road, which runs through the\r\nvillage--but the atmosphere there seemed full of thick dust, and\r\nnothing could be distinguished. He thereupon entered the adjoining\r\nroom, the window of which overlooked the meadows on the side of the\r\nMeuse, and realised that the morning mist was rising from the river,\r\nobscuring the horizon. The guns were thundering more and more loudly\r\nfrom over yonder, across the water, but were hidden from view by the\r\nfoggy veil. All at once a French battery replied with such a crash, and\r\nat so short a distance away, that the walls of the little house fairly\r\nshook.\r\n\r\nWeiss\'s abode was nearly in the centre of Bazeilles, on the right-hand\r\nside, near the Place de l\'Eglise. It stood back a little from the\r\nhighway which it faced, and comprised a ground floor and upper floor,\r\nthe latter being lighted by three windows and surmounted by a garret.\r\nIn the rear there was a rather large garden, which sloped down towards\r\nthe meadows, and whence the view extended over the immense panorama\r\nof hills from Remilly to Fr\xc3\xa9nois. With the fervour of one who has but\r\nrecently become a householder, Weiss had remained on his legs till\r\nnearly two o\'clock in the morning, burying all his provisions in the\r\ncellar, and placing mattresses before all the windows, with the view\r\nof shielding his furniture as much as possible from the enemy\'s fire.\r\nHe felt enraged at the idea that the Prussians might come and pillage\r\nthis house, which he had so long coveted, which he had acquired with so\r\nmuch difficulty, and which he had had the enjoyment of during, as yet,\r\nso brief a space of time.\r\n\r\nAll at once he heard some one calling to him from the road: \'I say,\r\nWeiss, do you hear?\'\r\n\r\nHe went down, and on opening the door found Delaherche, who had spent\r\nthe night at his dyeworks, a large brick building, separated from the\r\nhouse merely by a party wall. All the workmen had already fled through\r\nthe woods into Belgium, and the only person who remained to protect the\r\nplace was the door-portress, a mason\'s widow, named Fran\xc3\xa7oise Quitard.\r\nShe, poor, trembling, scared creature, would have fled with the others\r\nhad it not been for her boy, little Auguste, a lad some ten years of\r\nage, who was so ill with typhoid fever that he could not be removed.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' resumed Delaherche, \'do you hear? It\'s beginning nicely--it\r\nwould be prudent for us to get back to Sedan at once.\'\r\n\r\nWeiss had formally promised his wife that he would leave Bazeilles as\r\nsoon as there was any serious danger, and he was quite resolved to keep\r\nhis promise. So far, however, merely a long-range artillery engagement\r\nwas being fought, in a more or less random fashion, through the morning\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a bit,\' the book-keeper replied, \'there\'s no hurry.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche\'s curiosity was so acute and restless that it had almost\r\nlent him some courage. He had not closed his eyes during the night,\r\nbeing greatly interested in the defensive preparations that were being\r\nmade by the French troops. Foreseeing that he would be attacked at\r\ndaybreak, General Lebrun, who commanded the Twelfth Army Corps, had\r\nemployed the night in entrenching himself in Bazeilles. Orders had been\r\ngiven him that he must at any cost prevent the enemy from occupying\r\nthe village, and accordingly barricades had been thrown up across the\r\nhigh road and the side streets, each house had been garrisoned, and\r\neach lane and garden transformed into a fortress. And the men, quietly\r\nroused in the inky darkness, were already at their posts at three in\r\nthe morning, each with ninety cartridges in his pouch and with his\r\nchassepot freshly lubricated. Thus it happened that the enemy\'s first\r\ncannon shot surprised nobody; and the French batteries, posted in the\r\nrear between Balan and Bazeilles, immediately answered it, more by way\r\nof announcing their presence, however, than for any serious purpose,\r\nfor the firing was mere guess work and could hardly prove effective in\r\nsuch a fog.\r\n\r\n\'The dyeworks will be vigorously defended,\' resumed Delaherche. \'I\'ve\r\ngot an entire section there. Come and see.\'\r\n\r\nForty and odd men of the Marine Infantry had indeed been posted there,\r\nunder the command of a lieutenant, a tall, fair fellow, very young,\r\nbut with an energetic, stubborn expression of countenance. His men\r\nhad already taken possession of the building, and whilst some of them\r\nloopholed the shutters on the first floor, others embattled the low\r\nwall of the courtyard overlooking the meadows in the rear. It was in\r\nthe courtyard that Delaherche and Weiss found the lieutenant, who was\r\nvainly trying to distinguish the enemy\'s positions through the morning\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\'What a horrid fog!\' he muttered. \'We can\'t fight groping.\' And\r\nimmediately afterwards, without the slightest transition, he inquired:\r\n\'What day is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Thursday,\' replied Weiss.\r\n\r\n\'Thursday--oh, yes! The devil take me, but we live as though the world\r\nno longer existed.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment, amid the thundering of the guns, which did not for a\r\nmoment cease, a lively fusillade burst forth on the outskirts of the\r\nmeadows, some two or three hundred yards away. And just then there was\r\na sudden change in the surroundings, similar to a transformation scene\r\nat a theatre--the sun arose, the vapour from the Meuse flew away in\r\nfragments like shreds of delicate muslin, and a blue sky of spotless\r\nlimpidity appeared to view. A delightful morning was heralding in a\r\nglorious summer day.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' exclaimed Delaherche, \'they are crossing the railway bridge--do\r\nyou see them trying to gain ground along the line? What crass stupidity\r\non our part--the bridge ought to have been blown up!\'\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant made a gesture of anger. The mine was laid, he related,\r\nbut, on the previous day, the commanders had forgotten to fire it,\r\nafter the men had fought during four long hours to recapture this very\r\nbridge. \'It\'s our cursed luck,\' he added curtly.\r\n\r\nWeiss remained silent, gazing at the scene and trying to understand\r\nit. The French occupied a very strong position in Bazeilles. Built on\r\neither side of the road from Sedan to Douzy, the village overlooked\r\nthe plain; and apart from this road, turning to the left and passing\r\nin front of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau, there was only one other, branching out to\r\nthe right, and leading to the railway bridge. It was, therefore,\r\nnecessary for the Germans who were now advancing to cross the meadows\r\nand cultivated fields, all the vast open expanse edging the Meuse and\r\nthe railway line. The enemy\'s prudence being well known, it seemed\r\nunlikely that the real attack would take place on this side, and yet\r\ndense masses of men were still coming up by way of the bridge, and\r\nthis, despite all the havoc wrought in their ranks by the French\r\nmitrailleuses posted on the outskirts of the village. Those who\r\nsucceeded in crossing the bridge immediately threw themselves in\r\nskirmishing order among the few pollard willows rising here and there,\r\nuntil the columns managed to reform, and again press forward. It was\r\nfrom this direction that came the fusillade of increasing intensity\r\nthat had begun to crackle just as the mist rose.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo!\' remarked Weiss, \'those fellows are Bavarians--I can tell it by\r\ntheir helmets.\'\r\n\r\nAt the same time it seemed to him that some other columns, half\r\nhidden by the railway line, were pressing onward, on the right, and\r\nendeavouring to reach some distant trees, whence, by an oblique\r\nmovement, they might again descend upon Bazeilles. Should they succeed\r\nin thus sheltering themselves in the park of Montivilliers, the\r\nvillage might be captured. This was vaguely but promptly realised by\r\nWeiss. However, as the front attack was becoming more determined, he\r\nceased thinking of it. He had abruptly turned towards the heights\r\nof Floing, which rose up on the north, above the town of Sedan. A\r\nbattery installed there had just opened fire, puffs of smoke could be\r\nseen ascending in the bright sunlight, and the detonations could be\r\ndistinctly heard.\r\n\r\n\'Hum,\' said Weiss, \'the dance will be a general one.\'\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, who was looking in the same direction, made a vigorous\r\ngesture of assent, and added: \'But Bazeilles is the important point.\r\nThe issue of the battle will be decided here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you really think so?\' Weiss asked.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no doubt about it. The marshal himself must certainly have\r\nthat opinion, for he came here last night to tell us that we must\r\nfight to the last man rather than let the enemy take the village.\'\r\n\r\nWeiss shook his head, however, scanned the horizon around him, and\r\nthen, in a hesitating way, as though he were talking to himself,\r\nremarked: \'Well, no--no--I hardly fancy that--I\'m afraid of something\r\nelse--something I hardly dare say----\' He spoke no further, but held\r\nout his arms as though they were the branches of a vice; and then\r\nturning towards the north, he brought his hands together as if the\r\nvice-chops had suddenly met. In this fashion he expressed the fears\r\nthat had been troubling him since the previous day, fears based on his\r\nknowledge of the country, and on everything that he had observed of\r\nthe march of the hostile armies. And even now, when the broad plain\r\nexpanded in the radiant sunshine, his eyes returned once more to the\r\nhills on the left bank of the river, over which, throughout an entire\r\nday and an entire night, there had marched such an interminable, black\r\nswarm of German troops. A battery was firing from the left of Remilly,\r\nbut the one whose shells were beginning to fall at Bazeilles was\r\ninstalled at Pont-Maugis on the bank of the river. Weiss folded his\r\neye-glasses one over the other, and held them to one eye that he might\r\nthe more effectually explore the wooded slopes. However, he could only\r\nsee the white puffs of smoke with which the guns were, each minute,\r\ncapping the heights. What had become, then, of the human torrent which\r\nhad streamed along those hills? All that he could distinguish, after\r\nprolonged scrutiny, was a cluster of horses and uniforms--some general\r\nand his staff, no doubt--perched at the corner of a pine wood on the\r\nMarf\xc3\xa9e hill, above Noyers and Fr\xc3\xa9nois. Farther on was the loop of\r\nthe Meuse, barring the west; and on this side the only possible line\r\nof retreat on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res lay along the narrow road passing through the\r\ndefile of St. Albert, between the river and the forest of the Ardennes.\r\nOn the previous day, chancing to meet a general in a hollow road of\r\nthe valley of Givonne--a general who he afterwards learnt was Ducrot,\r\nthe commander of the First Corps--Weiss had ventured to speak to him\r\nof this one possible line of retreat. Unless the troops immediately\r\nretired by the road in question, if they waited until the Prussians had\r\ncrossed the Meuse at Donchery and intercepted the passage of the river,\r\nthey would certainly find themselves immobilised, brought to a stand\r\nat the Belgian frontier. That same evening, moreover, it had already\r\nseemed too late to effect the movement, for the Uhlans were reported\r\nto be in possession of the Donchery bridge--another bridge which had\r\nnot been blown up, in this case through forgetfulness to bring the\r\npowder required for the purpose. And now, thought Weiss despairingly,\r\nthe whole stream of men, the great black swarm, must be crossing the\r\nplain of Donchery on its way towards the defile of St. Albert, with\r\nits advance guard already threatening St. Menges and Floing, whither\r\nhe had conducted Jean and Maurice the previous night. He could espy\r\nthe distant steeple of Floing looking like a fine white needle in the\r\nbrilliant sunlight.\r\n\r\nOn the east was the other branch of the vice. Although Weiss could\r\ndescry the line of battle of the Seventh Corps, stretching on the\r\nnorthern side from the plateau of Illy to that of Floing, and\r\nineffectually supported by the Fifth Corps, posted as a reserve force\r\nunder the ramparts, it was impossible for him to tell what was taking\r\nplace on the east, where the First Corps was drawn up in the valley\r\nof Givonne from the wood of La Garenne to the village of Daigny.\r\nHowever, the guns were already thundering in that direction, and it\r\nseemed as if an engagement were being fought in the Chevalier Wood\r\nin front of the village. And Weiss was the more disquieted as some\r\npeasants had already, on the previous day, reported the arrival of the\r\nPrussians at Francheval, so that the movement which was being effected\r\non the west by way of Donchery was also being effected on the east by\r\nway of Francheval; and it seemed certain that the vice-chops would\r\neventually meet at the Calvary of Illy, on the northern side, should\r\nthe all-enveloping march on either hand not be promptly stayed. He knew\r\nnothing of military science; he had simply his common sense to guide\r\nhim, but he trembled at sight of that huge triangle, one side of which\r\nwas formed by the Meuse, whilst the other two were represented by the\r\nSeventh Corps on the north, and the First on the east; the Twelfth\r\nposted at Bazeilles on the south, occupying the extreme angle, and all\r\nthree turning the back to one another and awaiting, nobody knew how or\r\nwhy, the foe who was now coming up on every side. And in the centre, in\r\nthe depths of a pit as it were, was the town of Sedan, armed with guns\r\nthat were past service, and having neither a supply of ammunition nor a\r\nsupply of food.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you see,\' said Weiss, repeating the gesture he had previously\r\nmade--his arms stretched out and his finger-tips meeting--\'that\'s how\r\nit will be if your generals don\'t take care--the enemy are playing with\r\nyou at Bazeilles.\'\r\n\r\nHe explained himself, however, in a confused, unsatisfactory manner,\r\nand the lieutenant, not being acquainted with the district, failed\r\nto understand him, and impatiently shrugged his shoulders, full of\r\ndisdain for this spectacled civilian, who claimed to know better than\r\nMarshal MacMahon. On Weiss repeating that the attack upon Bazeilles was\r\nprobably only a feint, intended to conceal the enemy\'s real design, the\r\nyoung officer became quite irritated, and exclaimed: \'Pray mind your\r\nown business. We are going to drive your Bavarians into the Meuse, and\r\nthey\'ll learn what it is to play with us.\'\r\n\r\nThe enemy\'s skirmishers seemed to have drawn somewhat nearer during the\r\nlast minute or two, and several bullets having struck the brick wall\r\nof the dyeworks with a dull thud, the French soldiers began to return\r\nthe fire, sheltered by the low wall of the courtyard. The clear, sharp\r\nreport of a chassepot resounded every second.\r\n\r\n\'Drive them into the Meuse--yes, no doubt,\' muttered Weiss, \'and pass\r\nover them and march back on Carignan--that would be a good idea.\'\r\nThen addressing Delaherche, who in his fear of the bullets had hidden\r\nhimself behind the pump, he added: \'All the same, the proper plan\r\nwas to have hurried off to M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res yesterday evening. I should have\r\npreferred that if I\'d been in the place of the generals. However, one\r\nmust fight now, for retreat is not longer possible.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you coming?\' asked Delaherche, who, despite his ardent curiosity,\r\nwas beginning to blanch. \'If we stay here much longer we sha\'n\'t be\r\nable to get back to Sedan.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, wait a minute. I\'ll go with you.\'\r\n\r\nThen, in spite of the danger to which he exposed himself, Weiss rose on\r\ntip-toe, obstinately bent on finding out how matters were progressing.\r\nOn the right were the meadows flooded by order of the Governor of\r\nSedan, quite a large lake protecting the town from Torcy to Balan. A\r\ndelicate azure tint suffused the broad sheet of unruffled water in\r\nthe early sunlight. But the lake did not stretch far enough to cover\r\nthe outskirts of Bazeilles, and the Bavarians, advancing through the\r\ngrass, had indeed drawn nearer, taking advantage of every ditch and\r\nevery tree they came upon. They were now, perhaps, five hundred yards\r\naway, and Weiss was struck with the slowness of their movements,\r\nthe patient manner in which they gradually gained ground, exposing\r\nthemselves as little as possible. Moreover, a powerful artillery was\r\nsupporting them, and at each moment shells came hissing through the\r\nfresh, pure atmosphere. Weiss raised his eyes and saw that the battery\r\nof Pont-Maugis was not the only one that was firing on Bazeilles;\r\ntwo others, planted midway up the Liry hill, had also opened fire,\r\nnot merely cannonading the village, but sweeping the bare ground of\r\nLa Moncelle farther on, where the reserves of the Twelfth Corps were\r\nposted, and even the wooded slopes of Daigny, occupied by a division\r\nof the First Corps. And, indeed, flames were now flashing from all\r\nthe hill-crests on the left bank of the river. The guns seemed to\r\nspring out of the soil. At each moment the circle of fire extended--at\r\nNoyers a battery was firing on Balan, at Wadelincourt a battery was\r\nfiring on Sedan itself, and at Fr\xc3\xa9nois, just below the Marf\xc3\xa9e hill,\r\na formidable battery was hurling shells right over the town, shells\r\nwhich went plunging and bursting among the troops of the Seventh Corps\r\non the plateau of Floing. And it was with terrified anguish that\r\nWeiss now gazed on those slopes that he loved so well, those rounded\r\nhills which fringed the valley afar off with so gay a greenery, and\r\nwhich he had never imagined could serve any other purpose than that\r\nof delighting the eyesight; but now, all at once, they had become, as\r\nit were, a fearful, gigantic fortress, ready to pulverise the futile\r\nfortifications of Sedan.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly raised his head on seeing a little plaster fall to the\r\nground. A bullet had chipped it off the front of his house, which he\r\ncould perceive above the party-wall. \'Are those brigands going to\r\ndemolish my house?\' he growled, feeling greatly annoyed.\r\n\r\nJust then, however, he was astonished to hear a slight noise behind\r\nhim, and on turning round he saw a soldier falling on his back with\r\na bullet in the heart. For a moment the poor fellow\'s legs were\r\nstirred by a supreme convulsion, but death came so swiftly that his\r\nface retained its peaceful, youthful expression. This was the first\r\nman killed; Weiss, however, was most disturbed by the clatter of the\r\nsoldier\'s chassepot, which as it escaped from his hands rebounded on\r\nthe paving-stones of the yard.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I\'m off,\' stammered Delaherche. \'If you won\'t come I shall go\r\nalone.\'\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, whom the presence of these civilians disturbed,\r\nintervened approvingly: \'Yes, gentlemen, you had better go away. We may\r\nnow be attacked at any moment.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, after glancing once more at the meadows, where the Bavarians\r\nwere still gaining ground, Weiss made up his mind to follow Delaherche.\r\nBut, on reaching the street, he paused to double-lock the door of\r\nhis house, and when he again rejoined his companion an unforeseen\r\nspectacle once more stayed their flight. The Place de l\'Eglise, some\r\nthree hundred yards away, at the end of the road, was at that moment\r\nbeing attacked by a strong column of Bavarians debouching from the\r\nDouzy highway. After a time the regiment of Marine Infantry, entrusted\r\nwith the defence of the Place, appeared to slacken fire as though to\r\nlet the foe advance, but, all at once, when the German column was\r\nmassed in front of the French, the latter resorted to a strange and,\r\non the enemy\'s part, evidently unexpected man\xc5\x93uvre. The Marines sprang\r\non one or the other side of the way, a large number of them flinging\r\nthemselves upon the ground; and then, through the space thus suddenly\r\nopened, the French mitrailleuses, in position at the other end of the\r\nroad, rained a perfect storm of bullets upon the foe. The hostile\r\ncolumn was virtually swept away, and the Marines thereupon bounded to\r\ntheir feet and charged the scattered survivors of the Bavarian force at\r\nthe bayonet\'s point, bringing many of them to the ground and throwing\r\nthe others far back. And twice again was this same man\xc5\x93uvre repeated,\r\nand with the same success. Three women, who had remained in a little\r\nhouse at the corner of a lane, could be seen tranquilly installed at\r\none of the windows there, laughing and clapping their hands at the\r\nsight, and looking indeed as much amused as though they were at a\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! dash it!\' suddenly said Weiss; \'I forgot to lock up my cellar and\r\ntake the key. Wait a bit. I sha\'n\'t be a second.\'\r\n\r\nAs this first attack seemed to have been repulsed, Delaherche, whose\r\ncuriosity once more began to gain the upper hand, was in less haste\r\nto get away. Standing outside the dyeworks, he began talking to the\r\nportress, who had stepped to the threshold of the room she occupied, on\r\nthe ground floor.\r\n\r\n\'You ought to come away with us, Fran\xc3\xa7oise,\' he said. \'It\'s not right\r\nfor a woman to remain here all alone in the midst of such horrible\r\nthings.\'\r\n\r\nShe raised her trembling arms and answered: \'Ah, sir, I should\r\ncertainly have gone away if it hadn\'t been for my little Auguste, who\'s\r\nso ill. Will you come in and look at him, sir?\'\r\n\r\nHe did not go in, but craned his neck forward and shook his head\r\nominously as he espied the lad lying in a clean white bed, with the\r\npurple flush of fever suffusing his face, whilst with flaming eyes he\r\nlooked fixedly at his mother.\r\n\r\n\'But now I think of it,\' said the manufacturer, \'why don\'t you take him\r\naway? I\'ll fix you up at Sedan. Wrap him in a warm blanket, and come\r\nwith us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! it can\'t be done, sir. The doctor told me it would kill the boy\r\nto move him. If only his poor father were still alive. But there are\r\nonly we two left, and, needing one another as we do, we must be very\r\ncareful. And, after all, perhaps those Prussians won\'t do any harm to a\r\nlone woman and a sick child.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Weiss returned, delighted at having made every door in\r\nhis house secure. \'They\'ll have to smash everything if they want to get\r\nin,\' said he. \'And now let\'s get off. It won\'t be an easy job--we had\r\nbetter keep close to the houses or we may be hit by a bullet.\'\r\n\r\nThe enemy was, indeed, evidently preparing a fresh attack, for the\r\nfusillade was increasing in violence, and there was no pause now in the\r\nhissing of the shells. A couple of the latter had already fallen in the\r\nroad about a hundred yards away, whilst a third had plunged into the\r\nsoft soil of a neighbouring garden without bursting.\r\n\r\n\'I must say good-bye to your little Auguste, Fran\xc3\xa7oise,\' resumed Weiss.\r\n\'Oh! he doesn\'t look so bad now; in a couple of days he\'ll be out of\r\ndanger. Well, keep your spirits up. Mind you go indoors at once. Don\'t\r\nventure out here.\'\r\n\r\nAt last the two men turned to go off.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, Fran\xc3\xa7oise.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, gentlemen.\'\r\n\r\nBut at that very moment there was a terrible crash. After overthrowing\r\none of the chimneys of Weiss\'s house, a shell had fallen on the\r\nfootway, where it burst with so fearful an explosion that every\r\nwindow-pane near by was shivered to pieces. For a moment a mass of\r\nthick dust, a cloud of heavy smoke obscured everything. Then the front\r\nof the dyeworks reappeared, displaying a gaping aperture, and across\r\nthe threshold of her room lay Fran\xc3\xa7oise, dead, her backbone broken,\r\nand her head crushed--now merely a bundle of human rags, covered with\r\nblood, and hideous to behold.\r\n\r\nWeiss rushed up furiously. He was stammering, and oaths alone could\r\ngive expression to his feelings: \'Curse them! Curse them!\' he shouted.\r\nYes, she was indeed dead. He had stooped down and felt her hands. As\r\nhe was rising again his eyes encountered the blotched face of little\r\nAuguste, who had raised his head to look at his mother. The lad said\r\nnothing, he did not shriek or cry, but his large eyes, full of fever,\r\nwere quite dilated as they gazed upon that frightfully mangled body,\r\nwhich he could no longer recognise. \'Curse them!\' shouted Weiss at\r\nlast, \'so now they are killing women!\'\r\n\r\nHe had again drawn himself erect, and he shook his fist at the\r\nBavarians, whose helmets were once more appearing to view in the\r\ndirection of the church. Then the sight of the roof of his house, half\r\nbroken in by the fallen chimney, put the finishing touch to his mad\r\nexasperation. \'You dirty blackguards!\' he shouted, \'you kill women and\r\nyou knock my house to pieces! No, no, it is impossible, I can\'t go off\r\nlike that; I shall stay!\'\r\n\r\nHe darted into the courtyard of the dyeworks, and bounded back again,\r\ncarrying the chassepot and cartridge pouch of the dead soldier. For\r\nuse on important occasions, when he was desirous of seeing anything\r\nvery distinctly, he always carried a pair of spectacles in his pocket,\r\nthough he seldom wore them through a coquettish regard for the feelings\r\nof his young wife. Now, however, he promptly took off his folding\r\nglasses and put on his spectacles; and then this stout civilian, whose\r\ngood-natured, full face was quite transfigured by anger, who looked\r\nalmost comical yet superb in his heroism, began to fire, aiming at the\r\ndetachment of Bavarians massed at the end of the street. It was in his\r\nblood, as he was wont to say; he had longed to stretch some of them on\r\nthe ground ever since hearing the stories of 1814, related to him in\r\nhis childish days, in his Alsatian home.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the dirty blackguards, the dirty blackguards!\'\r\n\r\nAnd still he kept on firing--so rapidly in fact that the barrel of his\r\nchassepot began to burn his fingers.\r\n\r\nEverything now betokened a terrible attack. The fusillade had ceased\r\non the side of the meadows. The Bavarians had become masters of a\r\nnarrow stream fringed with poplars and pollard willows, and were\r\npreparing to assault the houses defending the Place de l\'Eglise. Their\r\nskirmishers had prudently fallen back, and now the sunshine alone\r\nwas drowsily streaming in a golden sheet over the immense grassy\r\nexpanse, flecked here and there with black patches--the corpses of\r\nthe soldiers who had been killed. And accordingly, the Lieutenant of\r\nMarine Infantry, realising that danger would henceforth come from the\r\nside of the street, evacuated the courtyard of the dyeworks, leaving\r\nmerely a sentry there; and speedily ranged his men along the side-walk,\r\ninforming them that should the enemy obtain possession of the Place de\r\nl\'Eglise they were to barricade themselves inside the building, on the\r\nfirst floor, and defend it as long as they had a cartridge left them.\r\nThe men fired as they pleased, lying on the ground, screened by border\r\nstones and profiting by the slightest projections of the buildings; and\r\nalong the broad, deserted highway, bright with sunshine, there now sped\r\na perfect hurricane of lead, with streaks of smoke--a hailstorm, as it\r\nwere, driven along by a violent wind. A girl was seen to dart madly\r\nacross the road without receiving any injury; then an old peasant in\r\na blouse, stubbornly bent upon taking his horse into the stable, was\r\nstruck by a bullet in the forehead, the force of the shock throwing him\r\ninto the middle of the road. Moreover, the roof of the church had just\r\nbeen broken in by a shell, and two other projectiles had set fire to\r\nsome houses, whose timbers crackled and blazed in the broad sunlight.\r\nAnd the sight of that poor creature, Fran\xc3\xa7oise, pounded to pieces near\r\nher ailing child, of the peasant lying in the road with the bullet\r\nin his skull, of the damaged church and the flaming houses, put the\r\nfinishing touch to the wrath of the inhabitants, who, rather than fly\r\nto Belgium, had preferred to stay and meet death in their modest homes.\r\nAnd men of the middle classes and sons of toil, men in coats and men\r\nin blouses, fired on the enemy from their windows with a fury akin to\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the bandits!\' suddenly exclaimed Weiss. \'They have got round. I\r\nsaw them running along the railway line. There! can\'t you hear them\r\nover yonder on the left?\'\r\n\r\nA fusillade had indeed just broken out in the rear of the park of\r\nMontivilliers which skirted the road. If the foe should secure\r\npossession of that park Bazeilles would be captured. The violence of\r\nthe firing proved, however, that the Commander of the Twelfth Corps had\r\nforeseen this movement on the enemy\'s part, and that the park was being\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\n\'Take care, you clumsy chap!\' suddenly exclaimed the lieutenant,\r\nforcing Weiss to draw back close to the wall; \'you\'ll be cut in half!\'\r\n\r\nThough he could not help smiling at this big spectacled fellow, he had\r\nbegun to feel interested in him, doubtless on account of the bravery\r\nhe displayed; and, hearing a shell coming, he had in a fraternal way\r\npushed him on one side. The projectile fell a dozen paces off, and,\r\nin bursting, covered them both with splinters. The civilian, however,\r\nremained erect without a scratch, whereas the unfortunate lieutenant\r\nhad both legs broken. \'Ah! curse it!\' he muttered. \'I\'m done for.\'\r\n\r\nHe had been thrown down on the side-walk, and he instructed his men to\r\nplace him in a sitting posture with his back against a door, near the\r\nspot where the corpse of that unfortunate woman Fran\xc3\xa7oise was stretched\r\nacross the threshold of her room. And the lieutenant\'s young face still\r\nretained its stubborn, energetic expression. \'It\'s of no consequence,\r\nmy lads,\' said he. \'Listen to me. Fire at your ease, don\'t hurry--I\'ll\r\ntell you when the time comes to charge them.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thus, with his head erect, watching the distant movements of the\r\nfoe, he continued commanding his men. Another house across the road\r\ncaught fire. The crackling of the fusillade and the loud explosions\r\nof the shells rent the dust-and-smoke-pervaded atmosphere. Men were\r\ntoppling over at each street corner, and wherever the dead had\r\nfallen--now singly, now in clusters--there were dark spots splashed\r\nwith blood; whilst over and above the village arose a frightful,\r\ngrowing clamour, the threatening uproar of thousands of men rushing on\r\na few hundred brave fellows who were resolved to die.\r\n\r\nAnd now Delaherche, who had repeatedly called to Weiss, asked him\r\nfor the last time: \'Are you coming? No? So much the worse, but I\'m\r\noff--good-bye!\'\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o\'clock, and he had already delayed his departure\r\nlonger than was prudent. So far as there were houses skirting the\r\nroad, he took advantage of their projections and recesses, bolting\r\ninto a doorway or behind a wall each time there was a volley. And so\r\nrapidly did he glide along, with all the suppleness of a snake, that\r\nhe was surprised to find himself still so young and nimble. But on\r\nreaching the limits of Bazeilles, when it became necessary that he\r\nshould follow the bare, deserted road, swept by the Liry batteries\r\nfor a distance of three hundred yards, he fairly shivered, albeit he\r\nwas perspiring from every pore. For a moment or two, bending low, he\r\ncontinued advancing along a ditch, then all at once he broke into a mad\r\ngallop and rushed straight before him along the road, with detonation\r\nafter detonation resounding like thunderclaps in his ears. His eyes\r\nwere burning, and he fancied he was running through flames. It seemed\r\nto last an eternity; but all at once he espied a small house on his\r\nleft, and promptly darted towards it. Once sheltered by its walls he\r\nfelt a tremendous weight uplifted from his chest. There were several\r\npeople near him, men on foot and men on horseback. At first he failed\r\nto distinguish any of them, but as he recovered his self-possession the\r\nsight he beheld filled him with astonishment.\r\n\r\nWas not that the Emperor and his staff? He hesitated to answer the\r\nquery affirmatively, although, since he had almost spoken to Napoleon\r\nat Baybel, he had flattered himself he should at once recognise him\r\nanywhere. Then he suddenly opened his mouth and looked on gaping. Yes,\r\nit was indeed Napoleon III., to all appearance taller now that he was\r\non horseback,[26] and with his moustaches so carefully waxed, and his\r\ncheeks so highly coloured that Delaherche immediately came to the\r\nconclusion that he had sought to make himself look young again--in a\r\nword, that he had made himself up for the occasion like an actor. Ay,\r\nwithout doubt he had caused his valet to paint his face so that he\r\nmight not appear among his troops spreading discouragement and fright\r\naround him with his pale, haggard countenance distorted by suffering,\r\nhis contracted nose, and dim, bleared eyes. And warned, at five\r\no\'clock, that there was fighting going on at Bazeilles, he had set out\r\nthither, silent and mournful like a phantom, but with his cheeks all\r\naglow with rouge.\r\n\r\nOn the way some brickworks afforded a shelter. The walls on one side\r\nwere being riddled by the bullets raining upon them; and shells were at\r\nevery moment falling on the road. The entire escort halted.\r\n\r\n\'It is really dangerous, sire,\' said some one; but the Emperor turned\r\nround, and with a wave of the hand simply ordered his staff to draw up\r\nin a narrow lane skirting the works, where both men and horses would be\r\ncompletely hidden. \'It\'s really madness, sire--we beg you, sire----\'\r\n\r\nHowever, he simply repeated his gesture, as though to say that the\r\nappearance of a number of uniforms on that bare road would certainly\r\nattract the attention of the hostile batteries on the left bank of the\r\nMeuse. And then, all alone, he rode forward amid the bullets and the\r\nshells, without evincing any haste, but still and ever in the same\r\nmournful, indifferent manner, as though he were going in search of\r\nDestiny. And doubtless, he could hear behind him that implacable voice\r\nthat had ever urged him forward, the voice that rang out from Paris,\r\ncalling: \'March, march, die like a hero on the corpses of your people,\r\nstrike the whole universe with compassionate admiration, so that your\r\nson may reign!\' And forward he went, slowly walking his horse. For\r\nnearly a hundred yards he thus continued advancing; and then he halted\r\nto await the fate that he had come in search of. The bullets whistled\r\nby like an equinoctial gale, and a shell burst near him covering him\r\nwith earth. Yet still he remained there waiting. His charger\'s mane\r\nstood up, the animal was quivering all over, instinctively recoiling\r\nat thus finding itself in the presence of death which passed by every\r\nmoment, unwilling, however, to touch either man or beast. And then,\r\nafter that infinite period of waiting, the Emperor, realising like the\r\nresigned fatalist he was, that it was not there he should find his\r\ndestiny, quietly rode back again, as though he had merely gone forward\r\nto reconnoitre the exact positions of the German batteries.\r\n\r\n\'What courage you have shown, sire! But we beg of you not to expose\r\nyourself again!\'\r\n\r\nHowever, with another wave of the hand he summoned the members of\r\nhis staff to follow him, now sparing them no more than he had spared\r\nhimself; and off he rode across the fields, over the bare ground of La\r\nRapaille towards the position of La Moncelle. On the way a captain of\r\nthe escort fell dead, and two horses were killed under their riders.\r\nThe regiments of the Twelfth Corps, before which Napoleon passed, saw\r\nhim appear and vanish like a spectre; not once was he saluted nor once\r\nacclaimed.\r\n\r\nDelaherche witnessed all this, and it made him shudder, especially\r\nwhen he reflected that on leaving the brickworks he should again find\r\nhimself in the open, exposed to all the projectiles. So he lingered\r\nthere, listening to some officers who had remained behind, their horses\r\nhaving been previously shot under them.\r\n\r\n\'I tell you he was killed on the spot,\' said one; \'a shell cut him in\r\nhalf.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no. I myself saw him carried off. He was merely wounded--a\r\nsplinter of a shell in the hip----\'\r\n\r\n\'At what time did it occur?\'\r\n\r\n\'At about half-past six, an hour ago. It was in a hollow road over\r\nyonder, near La Moncelle.\'\r\n\r\n\'And was he taken back to Sedan?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, he\'s there now.\'\r\n\r\nWhom could they be speaking of? All at once Delaherche realised that\r\nthey must be referring to Marshal MacMahon, wounded whilst on his way\r\nto the outposts. The marshal wounded! Such was our cursed luck, as\r\nthe lieutenant of Marine Infantry had said. And the manufacturer was\r\nreflecting on the consequences of this unfortunate casualty when an\r\nestafette galloped by with reins down, and shouted to a comrade whom he\r\nrecognised: \'General Ducrot is commander-in-chief. The entire army is\r\nto concentrate at Illy, to retreat on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res!\'\r\n\r\nThe next moment the estafette was already far away, entering Bazeilles\r\nunder a fire of increasing intensity, and Delaherche, scared by the\r\nextraordinary tidings that had reached him in such rapid succession,\r\nand liable to find himself caught in the midst of the retreating\r\ntroops, at last made up his mind to start off again, and ran all the\r\nway to Balan, whence he managed to reach Sedan without any very great\r\ndifficulty. And, meantime, the estafette was still galloping through\r\nBazeilles, seeking the commanders that he might give them their orders.\r\nAnd the tidings were also galloping along--Marshal MacMahon wounded,\r\nGeneral Ducrot appointed commander-in-chief, the whole army to fall\r\nback on Illy!\r\n\r\n\'What! what are they saying?\' exclaimed Weiss, already black with\r\npowder. \'Retreat on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res at this time of day? Why, it\'s madness;\r\nthe army could not possibly get through!\'\r\n\r\nHe was in despair, full of remorse that he himself had advised that\r\nvery course the day before, and had advised it precisely to General\r\nDucrot, who was now invested with the supreme command. Certainly, on\r\nthe previous day there was no other reasonable plan to follow. The army\r\nought to have retreated, retreated immediately by the defile of St.\r\nAlbert. But at the present time the road must be intercepted by all\r\nthat black swarm of Prussians that had streamed along, over yonder,\r\ntowards the plain of Donchery. And, madness for madness, the only truly\r\nvaliant, desperate course was to hurl the Bavarians into the Meuse,\r\npass over them, and march once more on Carignan.\r\n\r\nHitching up his falling spectacles every minute with a touch of\r\nhis finger-tips, Weiss explained the position of affairs to the\r\nlieutenant, who was still seated there with his limbs shattered\r\nand his back against the door. He was now looking extremely pale,\r\nhowever--indeed he was dying from loss of blood. \'I assure you that I\'m\r\nright, lieutenant,\' said Weiss. \'Tell your men to keep firm. You can\r\nsee that we are victorious. Another effort and we shall fling them into\r\nthe Meuse.\'\r\n\r\nThe second attack of the Bavarians had, in fact, just been repulsed.\r\nThe mitrailleuses had again swept the Place de l\'Eglise, with such\r\neffect that the enemy\'s dead now lay there in heaps, which rose up\r\nhere and there like barricades; and the disbanded foe, charged at the\r\nbayonet\'s point, was now being driven from all the lanes into the\r\nmeadows, where there began a flight towards the river, that would\r\nassuredly have become a rout if the Marines, already extenuated and\r\ndecimated, had been supported by fresh troops. On the other hand, the\r\nfusillade in the park of Montivilliers was coming no nearer, making it\r\nevident that the wood might be cleared of the enemy if reinforcements\r\nonly came up.\r\n\r\n\'Tell your men to charge them, lieutenant!\' suddenly shouted Weiss; \'at\r\nthe bayonet\'s point!\'\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, now of a waxy whiteness, still had sufficient strength\r\nleft him to murmur in a dying voice: \'You hear, my lads; at them with\r\nthe bayonet!\'\r\n\r\nAnd those were his last words. He expired with his stubborn head still\r\nerect and his eyes open, gazing on the battle. Flies were already\r\nbuzzing around and settling on Fran\xc3\xa7oise\'s shapeless head, whilst\r\nlittle Auguste, lying in bed, a prey to feverish delirium, was calling\r\nand asking for something to drink in a low, supplicating voice: \'Wake\r\nup, get up, mother--I\'m thirsty, I\'m so thirsty.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, General Ducrot\'s orders were peremptory, and the officers had\r\nto command a retreat, lamenting that they were prevented from profiting\r\nby the advantage they had just gained. Plainly enough, the new\r\ncommander, full of fears with regard to the enemy\'s turning movement,\r\nwas disposed to sacrifice everything to a mad attempt to escape his\r\nclutches. So the Place de l\'Eglise was evacuated, the troops fell back\r\nfrom lane to lane, and the road was soon empty. Women could be heard\r\nwailing and sobbing, and men swore and shook their fists in their anger\r\nat being thus abandoned. Many of them shut themselves in their houses,\r\ndetermined to defend them and die.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I\'m not going off like that!\' exclaimed Weiss, quite beside\r\nhimself. \'I prefer to leave my carcase here. We\'ll see if they\'ll come\r\nto smash my furniture and drink my wine.\'\r\n\r\nHe had completely given himself up to his rage, to the unquenchable\r\nfury of battle. The thought of the foreigner entering his house,\r\nsitting in his chair, and drinking out of his glass made his whole body\r\nrevolt, and drove away all thoughts of his accustomed life, his wife,\r\nand his business affairs, all the prudence that he usually displayed\r\nlike a sensible petty _bourgeois_. And now he shut himself, barricaded\r\nhimself, inside his house, walking up and down like a caged animal,\r\nproceeding from room to room, and making sure that every aperture was\r\nproperly closed. He counted his cartridges, and found he had about\r\nforty left. Then, as he was giving a last glance over towards the\r\nMeuse to make certain that no attack was to be feared by way of the\r\nmeadows, the spectacle furnished by the hills on the left bank once\r\nmore arrested his attention. The position of the German batteries was\r\nclearly indicated by the puffs of smoke ascending from them; and above\r\nthe formidable battery of Fr\xc3\xa9nois, on the verge of a little wood on the\r\nMarf\xc3\xa9e hill, he again espied that same cluster of uniforms which he had\r\nalready seen, but now looking larger than on the previous occasion,\r\nand so brilliant in the broad sunlight that, on placing his folders\r\nin front of his spectacles, he could distinguish the gold or brass of\r\nepaulettes and helmets.\r\n\r\n\'The dirty blackguards! The dirty blackguards!\' he repeated, shaking\r\nhis fist at the group.\r\n\r\nIt was King William of Prussia who was perched up there, on the Marf\xc3\xa9e\r\nhill, with his staff. He had already, at seven o\'clock, arrived\r\nthere from Vendresse, where he had slept, and there he was, well out\r\nof harm\'s way, with the valley of the Meuse, the whole unbounded\r\nbattlefield spread out below him. The vast panorama extended from one\r\nhorizon to another, and he looked down upon it from the hill as upon a\r\ngala performance from a throne reared in some gigantic court-box.\r\n\r\nSedan, with the geometrical lines of its fortifications bathed on the\r\nsouth and the west by the flooded meadows and the river, stood out in\r\nthe centre against the dark background of the Ardennes Forest, which\r\ndraped the horizon as with a curtain of antique greenery. Houses were\r\nalready blazing at Bazeilles, where all was misty with the dust of\r\nbattle. Then, on the east, from La Moncelle to Givonne, only a few\r\nregiments of the Twelfth and First French Corps could be seen, looking\r\nlike lines of insects as they crossed the stubble, and now and again\r\ndisappearing in a narrow valley where some hamlets were also hidden;\r\nand, farther on, the ground rose again, and pale-tinted fields could\r\nbe perceived, blotched with the green mass of the Chevalier Wood. The\r\nSeventh French Corps was especially well in view on the north, with\r\nits regiments represented by numerous black specks moving hither and\r\nthither over the plateau of Floing, a broad band of dark grey soil,\r\nwhich descended from the little wood of La Garenne to the herbage on\r\nthe river bank. Beyond were Floing, St. Menges, Fleigneux, and Illy,\r\nall the villages scattered across the surging expanse, quite a rugged\r\nregion, intersected by steep escarpments. And on the left, also, was\r\nthe loop of the Meuse, with its slow waters glittering like new silver\r\nin the clear sunlight, and its long languid bend forming the peninsula\r\nof Iges, and intercepting all communication with M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res save on one\r\npoint, where, between the farther bank and the impassable forest, there\r\nopened the only entrance to the defile of St. Albert.\r\n\r\nThe hundred thousand men and the five hundred guns of the French army\r\nwere heaped together, brought to bay within the triangle; and when the\r\nKing of Prussia turned his eyes westward he perceived another plain,\r\nthat of Donchery, with bare fields spreading out towards Briancourt,\r\nMarancourt, and Vrignes-aux-Bois, an infinite expanse of grey soil\r\ndusty under the blue sky; and when he turned to the east he also\r\nbeheld, confronting the confined French lines, another immense open\r\nexpanse, with an abundance of villages, first Douzy and Carignan, and\r\nthen, ascending northwards, Rub\xc3\xa9court, Pourru-aux-Bois, Francheval, and\r\nVillers-Cernay, till at last there came La Chapelle, near the Belgian\r\nfrontier. And all this surrounding ground belonged to him, and as he\r\npushed forward at his pleasure the two hundred and fifty thousand men\r\nand the eight hundred guns of his armies, he could, at one glance,\r\nsurvey their invading march. The Eleventh German Army Corps was, on\r\nthe one hand, already advancing on St. Menges, whilst the Fifth Corps\r\nwas at Vrignes-aux-Bois, and the division of Wurtembergers was waiting\r\nnear Donchery; and although, on the other side, the King\'s view was\r\nsomewhat obstructed by the trees and hills, it was yet easy for him to\r\nrealise the movements that were being accomplished. He had just seen\r\nthe Twelfth German Corps enter the Chevalier Wood, and he knew that\r\nthe Guard must by this time have reached Villers-Cernay. And the army\r\nof the Crown Prince of Prussia on the left, and the army of the Crown\r\nPrince of Saxony on the right, formed, as it were, the two branches of\r\nthe vice which were opening and ascending with irresistible force to\r\nmeet over yonder; whilst on their side the two Bavarian Army Corps were\r\nrushing upon Bazeilles.\r\n\r\nAnd, at King William\'s feet, the German batteries, disposed in an\r\nalmost uninterrupted line from Remilly to Fr\xc3\xa9nois, were now thundering\r\nwithout cessation, covering La Moncelle and Daigny with shells, and\r\nsweeping the plateaux on the north with other projectiles which passed\r\nright over the town of Sedan. As yet it was hardly more than eight in\r\nthe morning, and the King was already waiting for the inevitable result\r\nof the battle, his eyes fixed on the gigantic chessboard before him,\r\nhis mind busy with the movements of that human dust, the bellicose\r\nmadness of those few black specks which here and there dotted the\r\nsurface of smiling and eternal nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMAURICE RECEIVES THE BAPTISM OF FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, in the thick fog enveloping the plateau of Floing, Bugler\r\nGaude sounded the reveille with all the strength of his lungs. But the\r\nmoisture with which the atmosphere was densely impregnated, so deadened\r\nthe joyous call that it failed to awaken the men of the company, most\r\nof whom, lacking even the energy to pitch their tents, had rolled\r\nthemselves in the canvas or stretched themselves in the mud. They were\r\nlying there, already looking like corpses with their pallid faces\r\nhardened by weariness and sleep, and to rouse them it became necessary\r\nto shake them one by one, when they sat up with the air of men just\r\nresuscitated from the grave, quite livid, and with their eyes full of\r\nterror at the thought of life.\r\n\r\nMaurice was awakened by Jean. \'What\'s up? Where are we?\' he stammered\r\nas he glanced in a scared way on either side, perceiving nothing but\r\nthe grey sea in the depths of which he was apparently plunged, with the\r\nshadowy forms of his comrades floating around him. It was impossible\r\nto see twenty yards ahead, so that he could not take his bearings. He\r\nhad not the faintest notion as to the whereabouts of Sedan. At that\r\nmoment, however, the sound of a cannonade, somewhere far away, fell on\r\nhis ears: \'Ah! it\'s for to-day--so we are going to fight. So much the\r\nbetter, we must make an end of it all.\'\r\n\r\nThe men around him said the same: on all sides there was a gloomy\r\nsatisfaction, a longing to escape from that interminable nightmare,\r\nand to come face to face with those Prussians, whom, at the outset,\r\nthey had gone in search of, and then had fled from during so many weary\r\nhours. At last they would be able to fire on the foe and disburden\r\nthemselves of those cartridges which they had brought from such a\r\ndistance without an opportunity of burning even one of them. This time\r\neverybody realised that battle was inevitable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the guns of Bazeilles were thundering more and more loudly,\r\nand Jean, who stood there listening, inquired: \'Where are they firing?\'\r\n\r\n\'I fancy it\'s near the Meuse,\' replied Maurice; \'but the deuce take me\r\nif I know where I am.\'\r\n\r\n\'Listen, youngster,\' now said the corporal, \'you must keep beside me\r\nto-day, for a fellow needs to know something about these affairs if he\r\ndoesn\'t want to get injured. I\'ve been through the mill before, and\r\nI\'ll keep my eyes open for both of us.\'\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the squad was beginning to growl, furious at the\r\nthought that they had nothing warm to comfort their stomachs with. It\r\nwas impossible to light any fires without any dry wood, and in such\r\nfilthy weather too. Thus, at the very moment when the battle was about\r\nto commence, the great, imperious, paramount belly-question came to the\r\nfore once more. Perhaps they were heroes--some of them at any rate--but\r\nbefore and above everything else they were maws. Eating was indeed the\r\none all-important question, and how lovingly they skimmed the pot on\r\nthe days when there was some good _soupe_, and how angry they waxed,\r\nlike children and savages, when there was a scarcity of rations!\r\n\r\n\'No grub, no fighting,\' declared Chouteau; \'I\'ll be blowed if I risk my\r\nskin to-day!\'\r\n\r\nThis big, lanky house-painter, this fine speechifier from Montmartre,\r\nthis public-house theorist who marred the few reasonable ideas that\r\nhe had picked up here and there, by blending them with a frightful\r\nmixture of trash and lies, was again showing himself in the colours\r\nof a revolutionist. \'Besides,\' continued he, \'haven\'t they played the\r\nfool with us, telling us that the Prussians were dying of hunger and\r\nillness, that they hadn\'t even got any shirts left, and were to be met\r\non the roads grimed with dirt and as tattered as paupers?\'\r\n\r\nThis made Loubet laugh, like the _gamin_ he was whose life had been\r\nspent amid all the hole-and-corner avocations of the Paris markets.\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s all rot,\' continued Chouteau, \'it\'s we who are kicking the\r\nbucket, dying of misery, with our shoes full of holes and our clothes\r\nso ragged that anyone might be tempted to give us a copper out of\r\ncharity. And then too those big victories! Ah! the humbugs, to tell us\r\nthat they had taken Bismarck prisoner and knocked a whole army head\r\nover heels into a stone quarry. Ah! they have played the fool with us\r\nand no mistake.\'\r\n\r\nPache and Lapoulle listened, clenching their fists and nodding\r\ntheir heads with an air of fury. Others also were enraged, for\r\nthe everlasting lies of the Paris newspapers had ended by having\r\na disastrous effect. Confidence was dead; no belief remained in\r\nanything. The minds of these big children, at the outset so fertile in\r\nextraordinary hopes, were now filled with maddening nightmares.\r\n\r\n\'Of course, and it\'s simple enough,\' resumed Chouteau. \'It\'s easily\r\nunderstood since we\'ve been sold--you fellows know it as well as I do.\'\r\n\r\nEvery time that he heard this, Lapoulle in his childish simplicity felt\r\nquite exasperated. \'Sold, eh?\' said he. \'Ah! what rogues some people\r\nare.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sold like Judas sold his Master,\' muttered Pache, his mind always\r\nfull of biblical reminiscences.\r\n\r\nChouteau was triumphing: \'It\'s simple enough,\' said he, \'everyone\r\nknows the figures. MacMahon was paid three millions of francs, and the\r\ngenerals had a million apiece to bring us here. It was all settled in\r\nParis last spring; and a rocket was sent up last night as a signal that\r\nall was ready, and that the others could come and take us.\'\r\n\r\nThe arrant stupidity of this invention revolted Maurice. Chouteau had\r\nformerly amused him, almost won him over by his Parisian \'go;\' but\r\nfor some time past he had been unable to stomach this perverter, this\r\nne\'er-do-well, who railed at everything so as to disgust the others.\r\n\'Why do you tell such absurd stories?\' he exclaimed; \'you know very\r\nwell there\'s no truth in it at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'No truth in it? What! it isn\'t true that we have been sold? It\r\nwouldn\'t be surprising if a toff like you happened to belong to that\r\nband of swinish traitors. If that\'s the case,\' continued Chouteau,\r\nstepping forward in a threatening way, \'you had better say so, Mr.\r\nGentleman, because we can settle your hash at once, without waiting for\r\nyour friend Bismarck.\'\r\n\r\nThe others also were beginning to growl, and Jean thought it his duty\r\nto intervene: \'Keep quiet, all of you: I\'ll report the first one who\r\nstirs.\'\r\n\r\nBut Chouteau, with a sneer, began to hoot him. He didn\'t care a rap\r\nfor his report. He\'d fight or not, just as he pleased, and they\'d\r\nbetter not bother him, for his cartridges would do just as well for\r\nothers as for the Prussians. Now that the battle was beginning, the\r\nlittle discipline that fear had still maintained would be swept away.\r\nWhat could they do to him? He meant to skedaddle as soon as he had had\r\nenough of it. And he went on talking in an insulting fashion, exciting\r\nthe others against the corporal, who suffered them to die of hunger.\r\nYes, it was Jean\'s fault if the squad had had nothing to eat for three\r\ndays past, whereas the comrades had _soupe_ and meat. Mr. Jean and the\r\ntoff, however, had gone to feast with some wenches. Yes, indeed, others\r\nhad seen their goings-on at Sedan.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve spent the squad\'s money,\' shouted Chouteau at last; \'you\r\ndaren\'t deny it, you cursed jobber!\'\r\n\r\nMatters were getting serious. Lapoulle clenched his fist, and even\r\nPache, usually so gentle but now maddened by hunger, demanded an\r\nexplanation of Jean. The only sensible one was Loubet, who began to\r\nlaugh, saying that it was idiotic for Frenchmen to fall out when the\r\nPrussians were there close by. He wasn\'t a partisan of quarrelling\r\neither with fists or with guns, and, alluding to the few hundred francs\r\nhe had received as a substitute, he added: \'Well, if they fancy my\r\nskin\'s worth no more than that I\'ll undeceive them. I\'m not going to\r\ngive them more than their money\'s worth.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean, however, exasperated by Chouteau\'s idiotic onslaught,\r\nreplied in violent terms, and were spurning the charges levelled at\r\nthem, when all at once a loud voice rang out through the fog: \'What\'s\r\nthe row there? Who are the stupid clowns disputing like that?\'\r\n\r\nThen Lieutenant Rochas appeared to view, with his cap discoloured\r\nby the rain, his overcoat merely retaining a button here and there,\r\nand the whole of his lank, awkward person in a pitiable condition\r\nof neglect and wretchedness. And yet he had none the less assumed a\r\nvictorious swagger, his moustaches bristling and his eyes flaring.\r\n\r\n\'Please, sir,\' replied Jean, quite beside himself, \'it\'s these men who\r\nare shouting that we are sold. Yes, they say our generals have sold us.\'\r\n\r\nTo the narrow mind of Rochas this idea of treachery did not appear\r\naltogether unreasonable, for it explained defeats which he did not\r\nconsider admissible. \'Well, what the deuce is it to them if they _have_\r\nbeen sold?\' he answered. \'What business is it of _theirs_? At any rate,\r\nit doesn\'t alter the fact that the Prussians are here now, and that we\r\nare going to give them one of those lickings that are remembered.\'\r\n\r\nAfar off, behind the dense curtain of mist, the guns of Bazeilles did\r\nnot cease thundering. And impulsively thrusting out his arms, the\r\nlieutenant added, \'Ah! this time there\'s no mistake. We are going to\r\ndrive them home again with the butt-ends of our rifles.\'\r\n\r\nTo his mind the thunder of the cannonade effaced all the past: the\r\ndelays and uncertainties of the march, the demoralisation of the\r\ntroops, the disaster of Beaumont, and even the last agony of the forced\r\nretreat upon Sedan. Since they were about to fight, was not victory a\r\ncertainty? He had learnt nothing and forgotten nothing, he retained all\r\nhis braggart contempt for the enemy, his absolute ignorance of the new\r\nmethods of warfare, his unswerving conviction that an old soldier of\r\nthe Crimea, Italy, and Algeria could not be beaten. It would be really\r\ntoo droll if he were to undergo that experience at his age.\r\n\r\nA laugh suddenly parted his jaws from ear to ear. And, like the worthy\r\nfellow he was, he now did his men one of those good turns which made\r\nthem like him so much despite the manner in which he occasionally rated\r\nthem. \'Listen, my lads,\' said he, \'instead of disputing, it\'s much\r\nbetter to drink a drop together. Yes, I\'m going to stand treat, and you\r\ncan drink my health.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, from a deep pocket of his overcoat, he produced a bottle of\r\nbrandy, adding, with that triumphant air of his, that it was a present\r\nfrom a lady. This was not so surprising, as during the previous day\r\nhe had been seen in a tavern at Floing making himself quite at home\r\nthere with the servant girl on his knees. And now the soldiers laughed\r\nheartily, and held out their tin bowls, into which he gaily poured the\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\'You must drink to your sweethearts, my lads, if you have any, and you\r\nmust drink to the glory of France. That\'s all I care about. Here\'s to\r\njollity!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re right, sir; here\'s to your health and everybody\'s!\'\r\n\r\nThey all drank together, reconciled and warmed by the liquor. It was\r\nreally very kind of the lieutenant to have treated them to that drop\r\nof \'short\' in the early cold before they advanced on the enemy. And\r\nMaurice felt the alcohol descending into his veins, again bringing\r\nwarmth and the semi-intoxication of illusion. Why should they not\r\ndefeat the Prussians after all? Had not battles their surprises in\r\nreserve, sudden, unexpected transitions at which History remained\r\nastonished? Besides, that devil of a fellow, Rochas, declared that\r\nBazaine was on his way to join them, and was expected to come up before\r\nnightfall. And he intimated that the information could be positively\r\nrelied upon, for he had it from a general\'s aide-de-camp; and although\r\nhe stretched his arm towards Belgium, to point out by what direction\r\nBazaine was approaching, Maurice surrendered himself to one of those\r\ncrises of hope without which he was unable to live. After all, perhaps\r\nthe _revanche_ was really at hand.\r\n\r\n\'Pray, sir, what are we waiting for?\' he ventured to ask; \'aren\'t we\r\ngoing to march?\'\r\n\r\nRochas made a gesture as if to say that he was without orders. Then,\r\nafter a pause, he added: \'Has anyone seen the captain?\'\r\n\r\nNobody replied. Jean remembered that during the night he had espied him\r\nslinking away in the direction of Sedan; however, a prudent soldier\r\nshould never let it appear that he has seen a superior apart from the\r\nservice. So he had decided to hold his tongue, when, on turning round,\r\nhe perceived a shadowy form approaching beside a hedge. And, thereupon,\r\nhe exclaimed: \'Here he comes!\'\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Captain Beaudoin, who astonished everybody with his\r\nirreproachable get-up, contrasting in such a marked degree with the\r\ndeplorable condition of the lieutenant. His uniform was nicely brushed,\r\nhis boots were beautifully polished, and there was something quite\r\ncoquettish, something suggestive of _galanterie_ about his white hands,\r\nhis curled moustaches, and the vague perfume of Persian lilac that he\r\ndiffused around him, reminding one of a pretty woman\'s well-appointed\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo!\' sneered Loubet; \'so the captain has found his baggage again.\'\r\n\r\nNobody smiled, however, for the captain was known not to be an easy\r\ncustomer. He was execrated by his men, whom he kept at a distance. A\r\nregular vinegar-bottle, as Rochas put it. Since the earlier defeats he\r\nhad seemed quite offended, and the disaster, which everybody foresaw,\r\nappeared to him above all things improper. A Bonapartist by conviction,\r\nhaving had a prospect of rapid and high advancement before him, backed\r\nup as he was by several influential Parisian _salons_, he felt that\r\nhis fortune was sinking in the mud and mire of this disastrous war. It\r\nwas said that he possessed a very pretty tenor voice, to which he was\r\nalready deeply indebted. Moreover, he was not without intelligence,\r\nthough he knew nothing of his profession, being simply desirous of\r\npleasing, and when necessary proving very brave, without, however,\r\ndisplaying any excessive zeal.\r\n\r\n\'What a fog!\' he quietly remarked, feeling more at his ease now that he\r\nhad found his company, which he had been looking for during the last\r\nhalf-hour, almost fearing that he had lost himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, orders had at length arrived, and the battalion immediately\r\nadvanced. Fresh clouds of mist must have been ascending from the Meuse,\r\nfor the men almost had to grope their way through a kind of whitish\r\ndew, falling upon them in fine drops. And Maurice was struck by the\r\nsudden apparition of Colonel de Vineuil, who, erect on his horse,\r\nrose up before him at the corner of a road; the old officer looking\r\nvery tall and very pale, motionless like a marble statue of despair,\r\nand the animal shivering in the early cold with dilated nostrils\r\nwhich were turned towards the cannon over yonder. And Maurice was yet\r\nmore struck when, at ten paces in the rear, he espied the regimental\r\ncolours carried by the sub-lieutenant on duty, and looking, amid the\r\nsoft, shifting white vapour, like a trembling apparition of glory,\r\nalready fading away in the atmosphere of dreamland. The gilded eagle\r\nwas drenched with water, and the tricoloured silk, embroidered with\r\nthe names of victories, soiled by smoke, and perforated with ancient\r\nwounds, seemed to be paling in the mist; well-nigh the only brilliant\r\ntouches, amid all this obliteration, being supplied by the enamel\r\npoints of the Cross of Honour, which was hanging from the tassel of the\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThe colonel and the colours disappeared, hidden by a fresh wave of\r\nmist, and the battalion still continued advancing, as though through\r\na mass of damp cotton-wool, and without the men having the faintest\r\nnotion whither they were going. They had descended a narrow slope,\r\nand were now climbing a hollow road. Then all at once resounded the\r\ncommand, \'Halt!\' And there they remained, their arms grounded, their\r\nknapsacks weighing down their shoulders, and with strict orders not\r\nto stir. They were probably on a plateau, but it was still quite\r\nimpossible to distinguish anything twenty paces away. It was now seven\r\no\'clock; the cannonade seemed to have drawn nearer; fresh batteries,\r\ninstalled closer and closer to one another, were now firing from the\r\nother side of Sedan.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! as for me,\' suddenly said Sergeant Sapin to Jean and Maurice,\r\n\'I shall be killed to-day.\' He had not opened his mouth since the\r\nreveille. Judging by the expression of his thin face, with its large,\r\nhandsome eyes, and small, contracted nose, he had been absorbed in a\r\npainful reverie.\r\n\r\n\'What an idea!\' protested Jean. \'Can any of us say what will happen to\r\nus? It\'s all chance.\'\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, however, shook his head as though absolutely convinced of\r\nwhat he had said. \'For my part,\' he added, \'it\'s as good as done. Yes,\r\nI shall be killed to-day.\'\r\n\r\nSome of the men now turned round and asked him if he had dreamt it. No,\r\nhe hadn\'t dreamt anything; only he felt it _there_. \'And all the same,\r\nit worries me,\' said he, \'for I was going to be married as soon as I\r\ngot my discharge.\'\r\n\r\nAgain his eyes wavered; all his past life rose up before him. The son\r\nof a Lyons grocer in a small way of business, spoilt by his mother,\r\nwho was dead, and unable to get on with his father, he had remained\r\nin the regiment disgusted with everything, but unwilling to be bought\r\nout. Then, on one occasion, whilst away on leave, he had come to an\r\nunderstanding with one of his cousins and had arranged to marry her.\r\nAnd then he had again begun to take an interest in life, and the pair\r\nof them had laid many happy plans for going into business together with\r\nthe help of the small sum that the girl was to bring as a dowry. He, on\r\nhis side, had received some education, and was fairly proficient in the\r\nthree R\'s. For a year past his only thoughts had been for the future\r\nfelicity he had planned.\r\n\r\nAll at once he shuddered, shook himself as though to get rid of his\r\nfixed idea, and then calmly repeated: \'Yes, it\'s a beastly worry; but I\r\nshall be killed to-day.\'\r\n\r\nNone of the others spoke; the spell of waiting continued. They were not\r\naware whether they were facing or turning their backs on the enemy.\r\nVague sounds occasionally emerged from the depths of the fog--the\r\nrumbling of wheels, the tramp of a mass of men, the distant trot of\r\nhorses; sounds produced by the movements of the troops which the fog\r\nwas hiding, all the evolutions of the Seventh Army Corps, now taking\r\nup its line of battle. During the last minute or so, however, it had\r\nseemed as if the vapour were becoming less dense. Fragments of it\r\narose, looking like pieces of muslin, and patches of the horizon were\r\ndisclosed, still dim, however, of a gloomy blue, like that of deep\r\nwater. And it was at one of these moments when the atmosphere was\r\nclearing that they saw the regiments of Chasseurs d\'Afrique, belonging\r\nto Margueritte\'s division, pass by like phantom horsemen. Erect in\r\ntheir saddles, with their short, light-blue jackets and their broad red\r\nsashes, the Chasseurs urged on their mounts, animals of slender build,\r\nwho were half hidden beneath the cumbersome kits they carried. Behind\r\none squadron came another, and after emerging for a moment from the\r\nhaze where all was vague, they passed into it again as though melting\r\naway under the fine rain. Doubtless they had been in the way, and were\r\nbeing sent farther off, those in command not knowing what to do with\r\nthem, as had been the case ever since the outset of the campaign. They\r\nhad scarcely been employed on reconnoitring duties at all, and as soon\r\nas an engagement began they were promenaded from valley to valley,\r\nvaluable, yet useless.\r\n\r\nAs Maurice looked at them he thought of Prosper. \'Hallo!\' he muttered,\r\n\'perhaps he\'s over there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\' asked Jean.\r\n\r\n\'That fellow from Remilly, whose brother, the Franc-tireur, we met at\r\nOches.\'\r\n\r\nThe Chasseurs had passed on, however, and then came another gallop,\r\nthat of a general\'s staff descending the sloping road. Jean recognised\r\nBourgain-Desfeuilles, the commander of their brigade, who was waving\r\nhis arm in a furious manner. So he had at last deigned to quit the\r\nGolden Cross Hotel, and his bad humour plainly indicated how annoyed\r\nhe was at having had to rise so early, after being so badly lodged and\r\nwretchedly fed. His voice could be distinctly heard, thundering out:\r\n\'Well, d---- it, the Moselle or the Meuse, at any rate the water that\'s\r\nthere!\'\r\n\r\nHowever, the mist was at length rising. As at Bazeilles, there was a\r\nsudden transformation scene, a radiant spectacle gradually disclosed\r\nto view, as when the drop-curtain slowly ascends towards the flies.\r\nThe sunrays were brightly streaming from the blue vault, and Maurice\r\nimmediately recognised the spot where they were waiting. \'Ah!\' said he\r\nto Jean, \'this is what they call the plateau of Algeria. You see that\r\nvillage in front of us, on the other side of the valley, that\'s Floing.\r\nThat one, farther off, is St. Menges; and there, farther still, is\r\nFleigneux. Then, right away, in the forest of the Ardennes--those trees\r\non the horizon--comes the frontier.\'\r\n\r\nWith his hand outstretched he continued giving his explanations. The\r\nplateau of Algeria, a strip of muddy soil, rather less than two and\r\na half miles in length, sloped gently from the wood of La Garenne\r\ntowards the Meuse, from which some meadows parted it. It was here that\r\nGeneral Douay had disposed the Seventh Corps, in despair that he had\r\nnot sufficient men to defend so long a line as that allotted to him, or\r\nto establish a solid connection with the First Corps, whose positions,\r\nperpendicular to his own, extended along the valley of the Givonne from\r\nthe wood of La Garenne to Daigny.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you see how vast it is, eh?\' said Maurice, turning round, and with\r\na wave of the hand embracing the entire horizon. From the plateau of\r\nAlgeria the whole immense field of battle stretched out towards the\r\nsouth and the west. First there was Sedan, whose citadel could be seen\r\nrising above the housetops; then came Balan and Bazeilles, hazy with\r\nsmoke; and, in the rear, the heights on the left bank of the Meuse, the\r\nLiry, Marf\xc3\xa9e and Croix-Piau hills. But the view was more particularly\r\nextensive on the west, in the direction of Donchery. The loop of the\r\nMeuse bounded the peninsula of Iges as with a light ribbon, and over\r\nthere one could plainly detect the narrow Route de St. Albert, running\r\nbetween the bank and a steep height, which, somewhat farther on, was\r\ncrowned by the little wood of Le Seugnon, a spur of the woods of La\r\nFalizette. The road to Vrignes-aux-Bois and Donchery passed over the\r\nsummit of the height at a spot known as the Crossway of the Red House.\r\n\r\n\'And in that direction, you know, we could fall back on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res,\' said\r\nMaurice. But at that very moment a first cannon shot was fired from\r\nSt. Menges. Shreds of fog were still trailing in the depths, and a\r\nvague mass of men could just be espied marching along the defile of St.\r\nAlbert. \'Ah! there they are!\' resumed Maurice, instinctively lowering\r\nhis voice, and without naming the Prussians. \'Our line of retreat is\r\ncut off!\'\r\n\r\nIt was not yet eight o\'clock. The cannonade, which was increasing in\r\nviolence in the direction of Bazeilles, could now also be heard on the\r\neast, in the valley of the Givonne, which they were unable to see.\r\nAt this moment, indeed, the army of the Crown Prince of Saxony was\r\nemerging from the Chevalier Wood and advancing upon the First Corps in\r\nfront of Daigny. And now that the Eleventh Prussian Corps, marching\r\nupon Floing, was opening fire on General Douay\'s troops, the battle had\r\nbegun on all sides, from north to south, over an expanse of several\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nMaurice had just realised what a deplorable blunder had been made in\r\nnot withdrawing upon M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res during the night. And although he had\r\nonly a dim notion as to what might be the exact consequences of the\r\nblunder, he was instinctively apprehensive of danger, and gazed with\r\ndisquietude at the neighbouring heights overlooking the plateau of\r\nAlgeria. Allowing that they might not have had sufficient time to\r\nretreat on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, why, at all events, had they not occupied those\r\nheights, with their backs to the frontier, so that they might, at all\r\nrisks, have made their way into Belgium in the event of a defeat? Two\r\npoints appeared particularly threatening, the round Hattoy hill, above\r\nFloing on the left, and the so-called Calvary of Illy, crowned by a\r\nstone cross rising between two lime trees. On the previous day General\r\nDouay had sent a regiment to occupy the Hattoy hill, but this isolated\r\nposition being considered dangerous the men had fallen back at dawn.\r\nAs for the Calvary of Illy, its defence had been entrusted to the left\r\nwing of the First Army Corps. All the vast bare expanse, dented with\r\ndeep valleys from Sedan to the Ardennes, was there; and evidently the\r\nkey of the position was at the foot of that cross and those two lime\r\ntrees, whence one could sweep all the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nTwo more artillery reports were now heard. Then came the roar of\r\nseveral pieces fired simultaneously, and this time a puff of smoke was\r\nseen to ascend from a little hill on the left of St. Menges. \'Ah!\' said\r\nJean, \'it\'s our turn now.\'\r\n\r\nNothing was seen of any projectile, however. The men, still standing\r\nthere stock-still, with their arms grounded, had no other pastime than\r\nthat of contemplating the fine order of the Second Division, drawn\r\nup in front of Floing, and with its left wing thrown forward in the\r\ndirection of the Meuse, to meet any attack on that side. The Third\r\nDivision was deploying on the east as far as the wood of La Garenne,\r\nbelow Illy; whilst the first, cut up at Beaumont, was in the rear,\r\nforming a second line. The Engineers had been engaged all night in the\r\npreparation of defensive works, and were still digging shelter-trenches\r\nand raising breast-works, when the Prussians began firing.\r\n\r\nA fusillade broke out in the lower part of Floing, but soon ceased, and\r\njust then Captain Beaudoin\'s company received orders to fall back a\r\ndistance of some three hundred yards. The men had just reached a large\r\nsquare field of cabbages, when the captain curtly commanded them to lie\r\ndown. They had to obey, although the order was by no means a pleasant\r\none. The abundant dew had quite soaked the cabbages, on whose thick\r\nleaves of a greenish gold there lingered large drops of as brilliant\r\nand as pure a water as diamonds. \'Sight at four hundred yards!\' called\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\nMaurice thereupon rested the barrel of his chassepot on a cabbage\r\nin front of him. Lying there, on the soil, he could no longer see\r\nanything save a confused stretch of ground streaked here and there with\r\ngreenery, and nudging Jean, who was on his right hand, he asked him\r\nwhat they were doing in that field. Jean, experienced in such matters,\r\npointed out to him a battery which was being established on a hillock\r\nnear at hand. Plainly enough they had been placed there to support that\r\nbattery. Thereupon Maurice, inquisitive as to whether Honor\xc3\xa9 was at the\r\nbattery in question, scrambled to his feet; but the reserve artillery\r\nwas in the rear, beyond a clump of trees.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' shouted Rochas, \'lie down at once!\'\r\n\r\nBefore Maurice had again stretched himself on his stomach a shell\r\npassed by, hissing, and from that moment there was no pause in the\r\narrival of the projectiles. The correct range, however, was but slowly\r\nfound; the first shells fell far beyond the French battery, which also\r\nopened fire, whilst others, which sank into the soft soil, did not\r\nexplode, so that for some time there was any number of jokes about the\r\nclumsiness of those sauerkraut-eating gunners.\r\n\r\n\'Why, their artillery fire is a mere flash in the pan!\' said Loubet.\r\n\r\nThen Chouteau indulged in a disgusting joke, and Lieutenant Rochas\r\njoined in with the remark, \'There! I told you those fools couldn\'t even\r\npoint a gun!\'\r\n\r\nOne shell, however, burst some ten paces away, covering the company\r\nwith mould, and although Loubet called to his comrades in a bantering\r\nway to get their brushes out of their knapsacks, Chouteau, who was\r\nturning quite pale, held his peace. He had never been under fire\r\nbefore, neither had Pache nor Lapoulle, nor, indeed, any man of the\r\nsquad excepting Jean. Their eyes blinked and grew dim, whilst their\r\nvoices became shrill and faint as though they had a difficulty in\r\nspeaking. Maurice, who still retained some measure of self-possession,\r\nendeavoured to analyse his sensations: he was not yet frightened, for\r\nhe did not think he was in danger, and all that he experienced was\r\na slight uneasiness in the epigastrium, whilst his head gradually\r\nemptied, so that he could not connect his ideas. All the same, however,\r\nhis hopefulness had been increasing like growing intoxication ever\r\nsince he had observed with so much wonderment the capital order of\r\nthe troops. He had reached a state when he no longer had any doubt of\r\nvictory, provided they could only charge the enemy with cold steel.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo!\' he muttered; \'what a lot of flies there are.\' Thrice already\r\nhe had heard a buzzing sound.\r\n\r\nJean could not help laughing. \'No,\' said he; \'they are bullets.\'\r\n\r\nOther light buzzing sounds swept by, and now all the men of the squad\r\nturned their heads, greatly interested. It was an irresistible impulse,\r\nand one after another they lifted up their necks, unable to keep still.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' said Loubet to Lapoulle, by way of amusing himself with the\r\nsimpleton, \'whenever you see a bullet coming you\'ve only got to put a\r\nfinger in front of your nose--like that--it cuts the air apart, and the\r\nbullet passes on the right or the left.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t see them coming,\' said Lapoulle, whereupon everybody\r\nroared.\r\n\r\n\'Oh my! he doesn\'t see them! Keep your lamps open, you fool! Why, there\r\ncomes one--and there\'s another. Didn\'t you see that one? It was a green\r\nbullet.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon Lapoulle opened his eyes as wide as he could, and kept\r\none finger uplifted in front of his nose, whilst Pache, touching the\r\nscapular he wore, wished he were able to extend it like a breastplate\r\nover his chest.\r\n\r\nRochas, who had remained standing, exclaimed all at once in his\r\nbantering way: \'You\'re not forbidden to salute the shells, my lads, bub\r\nnever mind about the bullets, there are too many of them.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment a splinter of a shell shattered the head of a soldier in\r\nthe front rank. He was not even able to cry out: there was a spurt of\r\nblood and brain-matter--that was all.\r\n\r\n\'Poor devil!\' quietly said Sergeant Sapin, who was very calm and very\r\npale; \'whose turn next?\'\r\n\r\nBut they could no longer hear one another; and it was indeed especially\r\nthe frightful uproar that distressed Maurice. The battery near by\r\nwas firing without a pause, with a continuous roar which shook the\r\nground; and the mitrailleuses, rending the air asunder, were even\r\nmore insufferable. How long were they going to lie among those\r\ncabbages? There was still nothing to be seen; nothing was known. It\r\nwas impossible to form the slightest idea of the battle; was it even\r\na real battle, a great one? All that Maurice could distinguish above\r\nthe smooth line of the fields before him was the round, wooded summit\r\nof the Hattoy hill, far away and still deserted. Not a Prussian was\r\nto be seen on the horizon. Only some puffs of smoke arose, wafted for\r\na moment in the sunlight. Then, as he turned his head, he was greatly\r\nastonished on perceiving in the depths of a sequestered valley,\r\nsheltered by rugged slopes, a peasant who was calmly pursuing his\r\navocation--guiding a plough drawn by a big white horse. Why should the\r\nman lose a day? Corn would not cease growing, the human race would not\r\ncease living, because a few thousand men happened to be fighting.\r\n\r\nConsumed by impatience, Maurice rose to his feet, and at a glance he\r\nagain saw the batteries of St. Menges, which were cannonading them,\r\ncrowned with tawny smoke; and he also again beheld the road from St.\r\nAlbert now blocked with Prussians, the indistinct swarming of an\r\ninvading horde. Jean, however, swiftly caught hold of his legs and\r\ndragged him to the ground. \'Are you mad?\' said the corporal; \'you\'ll be\r\npotted.\'\r\n\r\nOn his side Rochas began to swear: \'Lie down at once! What the deuce\r\ndoes the fellow mean, trying to get killed when he hasn\'t been ordered\r\nto do so?\'\r\n\r\n\'But you\'re not lying down, sir,\' said Maurice.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! in my case it\'s different; it\'s necessary that I should know\r\nwhat\'s passing.\'\r\n\r\nCaptain Beaudoin also remained bravely erect. But he did not open his\r\nmouth to speak to his men, to whom nothing attached him; and it seemed\r\nas if he were unable to keep still, for again and again did he tramp\r\nfrom one end of the field to the other.\r\n\r\nAnd meantime the waiting continued, nothing came. Maurice was\r\nsuffocating beneath his knapsack, which, in his horizontal position,\r\nso wearisome after a time, was weighing heavily on his back and chest.\r\nThe men had been particularly cautioned that they were not to rid\r\nthemselves of their knapsacks until the last extremity.\r\n\r\n\'I say, are we going to spend the whole day here?\' Maurice ended by\r\nasking Jean.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps so. At Solferino, I remember, we spent five hours lying in\r\na carrot-field with our noses on the ground.\' And then, like the\r\npractical fellow he was, Jean added: \'But what are you complaining of?\r\nWe are not badly off. There\'ll always be time enough for us to expose\r\nourselves. Everyone has his turn, you know. If we all got ourselves\r\nkilled at the beginning there would be no one left for the finish.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' suddenly interrupted Maurice, \'look at that smoke on the Hattoy\r\nhill. They\'ve captured it; they\'ll be leading us a nice dance now.\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment the sight he beheld supplied some food for his anxious\r\ncuriosity, into which the first quiver of fear was stealing. He could\r\nnot take his eyes off the round summit of that hill, the only acclivity\r\nthat he could perceive, above the fleeting line of fields, level with\r\nhis eye. It was, however, much too far away for him to distinguish the\r\ngunners of the batteries that had just been established there by the\r\nPrussians, and, indeed, he only saw the puffs of smoke rising at each\r\nfresh discharge above a plantation, which probably concealed the guns.\r\n\r\nAs Maurice had instinctively divined, the capture of this position,\r\nthe defence of which General Douay had been compelled to renounce,\r\nwas a very serious matter. The Hattoy hill commanded the surrounding\r\nplateaux, and when the German batteries installed there opened fire on\r\nthe Second Division of the Seventh Corps, they speedily decimated it.\r\nThe enemy\'s practice was now much improved, and the French battery,\r\nnear which Beaudoin\'s company was lying down, had a couple of gunners\r\nkilled in rapid succession. A splinter at the same time wounded a\r\nquartermaster-corporal of the company, whose left heel was carried\r\nclean away, and who began shrieking with pain as though he had suddenly\r\ngone mad.\r\n\r\n\'Shut up, you brute!\' shouted Rochas. \'Is there any sense in making\r\nsuch a row over a flea-bite?\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly calmed, the wounded man became silent, and sank into a\r\nsenseless immobility, with his foot in his hand.\r\n\r\nAnd, meanwhile, the formidable artillery duel, growing more and more\r\nserious, steadily went on over the heads of the prostrate regiments,\r\nacross the hot, mournful stretch of country where no one was to be\r\nseen in the fierce sunlight. There seemed to be nothing but this\r\nthunder, this destructive blizzard rushing backwards and forwards\r\nathwart the deserted expanse. And hours and hours were to elapse before\r\nit ceased. But the superiority of the German artillery was already\r\nbecoming manifest; nearly all of their percussion shells exploded at\r\ntremendous distances, whereas the French shells, on the fuse system,\r\ndid not travel nearly so far, and more frequently than otherwise\r\nburst in the air before reaching their destinations. And, meantime,\r\nfor Captain Beaudoin\'s men there was no resource but that of trying\r\nto make themselves as small as possible in the furrows in which they\r\nwere lying, close-pressed to the soil. They were not even able to ease\r\nthemselves, intoxicate themselves, shake off their thoughts by firing a\r\nfew shots. For whom could they fire at, since there was still nobody to\r\nbe seen along the blank horizon?\r\n\r\n\'Aren\'t we going to fire?\' Maurice kept on repeating, quite beside\r\nhimself. \'I\'d give five francs to see one of those Prussians appear.\r\nIt\'s exasperating to be fired at like that without being able to reply.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be in a hurry, the time may come,\' replied Jean, quietly.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gallop of horses on their left made them turn their heads,\r\nand they recognised General Douay, who, followed by his staff, had\r\nridden up to ascertain how his troops were behaving under the terrible\r\nfire from the Hattoy hill. He seemed satisfied, and was giving a few\r\norders, when General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, in his turn, debouched from\r\na hollow road. \'Carpet-general\' though he was, he trotted along with\r\ncareless indifference amidst all the projectiles, obstinately clinging\r\nto his Algerian practices, and having failed to profit by any of the\r\nlessons of the war. He was gesticulating after the fashion of Rochas,\r\nand shouting: \'I\'m waiting for them. We\'ll see how it will be when\r\nwe get to close quarters by-and-by.\' Then, catching sight of General\r\nDouay, he rode up to him: \'Is it true, general, that the marshal\'s\r\nwounded?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is, unfortunately. I received a line from Ducrot just now,\r\ntelling me that the marshal had selected him to take command of the\r\narmy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! so it\'s Ducrot! And what are the orders?\'\r\n\r\nThe commander of the Seventh Corps made a gesture of despair. He had\r\nrealised, already on the previous day, that the army was lost if it\r\nremained at Sedan, and he had urged again and again, but vainly, that\r\nthe positions of St. Menges and Illy ought to be occupied in view of\r\ninsuring a means of retreating upon M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n\'Ducrot reverts to our plan,\' he said, in answer to\r\nBourgain-Desfeuilles. \'The entire army is to concentrate on the plateau\r\nof Illy.\' And then he repeated his gesture as though to say that it was\r\ntoo late!\r\n\r\nThe roar of the cannon drowned many of his words; still the sense of\r\nthem reached Maurice\'s ears distinctly enough, and he was quite scared.\r\nWhat! Marshal MacMahon was wounded, General Ducrot commanded in his\r\nstead, the entire army was to retreat to the north of Sedan, and the\r\npoor devils of soldiers who were getting themselves killed were in\r\nutter ignorance of all these important matters! And they were playing\r\nthis fearful game at the mercy of a chance accident, dependent on the\r\nfancies of a fresh leader! He divined the confusion, the final disarray\r\ninto which the army was falling, without a commander, without a plan,\r\ndragged first one way and then another, whilst the Germans never\r\ndeviated, but went straight towards their goal with the precision of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bourgain-Desfeuilles was already riding away when he was\r\nimperatively recalled by his superior, who had just received another\r\nmessage, brought to him by a Hussar, covered with dust.\r\n\r\n\'General! general!\' shouted Douay, whose voice, in his surprise and\r\nemotion, thundered so loudly that it resounded above all the roar of\r\nthe artillery. \'General, it is no longer Ducrot who commands, but\r\nWimpffen! Yes, he arrived yesterday, at the very moment of the Beaumont\r\nrout, to take De Failly\'s place at the head of the Fifth Corps--and he\r\nwrites me that he has a letter from the Minister of War placing him at\r\nthe head of the army in the event of any vacancy in the command--and\r\nthe orders to retreat are cancelled, we are to regain and defend our\r\noriginal positions.\'\r\n\r\nGeneral Bourgain-Desfeuilles was listening with dilated eyes.\r\n\'Thunder!\' he exclaimed at last, \'we ought to know what we are to\r\ndo--though for my own part I don\'t care a rap!\'\r\n\r\nThen away he galloped, really indifferent as to the issue of the\r\naffair, having merely viewed the war at the outset as a means of\r\nrapidly attaining to divisional rank, and now simply desiring that this\r\nstupid campaign should be brought to an end as soon as possible, since\r\nit gave so little satisfaction to everybody.\r\n\r\nAnd now the men of Beaudoin\'s company burst into a derisive laugh.\r\nMaurice said nothing, but he shared the opinion of Chouteau and Loubet,\r\nwho began to jeer and joke, pouring forth their contempt. Right\r\nwheel, left wheel, go as you\'re told. Nice commanders they had, and\r\nno mistake; commanders who agreed so well together, and who didn\'t\r\nwant all the blanket to themselves--oh! no, of course not! When men\r\nhad such generals as those, wasn\'t it best to go off to bed? Three\r\ncommanders-in-chief in the space of a couple of hours, three fine\r\nfellows who didn\'t know what ought to be done, and each of whom gave\r\ndifferent orders! Really, it was enough to make you feel exasperated,\r\nenough to demoralise a saint! And then those fatal charges of treason\r\ncropped up afresh--Ducrot and Wimpffen were like MacMahon, they wanted\r\nto earn Bismarck\'s three millions!\r\n\r\nGeneral Douay had halted at some little distance in advance of his\r\nstaff, and there he remained quite alone, gazing at the Prussian\r\npositions, and absorbed in a reverie of infinite sadness. For a long\r\ntime he continued scanning the Hattoy hill, the shells from which were\r\nfalling close around him. Then, after turning towards the plateau of\r\nIlly, he summoned an officer to carry an order to a brigade of the\r\nFifth Corps, which he had obtained from General de Wimpffen the day\r\nbefore, and which connected him with Ducrot\'s left wing. And he was\r\ndistinctly heard to remark: \'If the Prussians should obtain possession\r\nof the Calvary we could not hold out here for an hour; we should be\r\nthrown back on Sedan.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he went off, disappearing with his escort at a bend of the\r\nhollow road, whilst the enemy\'s fire increased in intensity. Very\r\npossibly he had been remarked.\r\n\r\nAnd now the shells, which hitherto had simply been coming from the\r\nfront, began raining on the left flank as well. The fire of the\r\nbatteries at Fr\xc3\xa9nois, and of another battery established on the\r\npeninsula of Iges, was crossing that from the Hattoy hill. And the\r\nprojectiles fairly swept the plateau of Algeria. The men, occupied in\r\nwatching what was going on in front, now had this flank fire to alarm\r\nthem, and, exposed to two dangers, were at a loss how to escape from\r\neither. In rapid succession three men were killed, whilst two who were\r\nwounded shrieked aloud.\r\n\r\nAnd it was now that Sergeant Sapin met the death he expected. He had\r\nturned round, and, when it was too late to avoid the shell, he saw it\r\ncoming. \'Ah! there it is,\' he simply said. There was a look, not of\r\nterror, but of profound sadness on his little pale face, in his large\r\nhandsome eyes. His belly was ripped open, and he began to moan: \'Oh!\r\ndon\'t leave me here! take me to the ambulance I beg of you--take me\r\naway.\'\r\n\r\nRochas wished to silence him, and in his brutal fashion was about to\r\ntell him that when a man was mortally wounded he had no business to put\r\na couple of comrades to unnecessary trouble. Suddenly, however, the\r\ngrim lieutenant was stirred by pity, and exclaimed: \'Wait a moment, my\r\npoor fellow, till the bearers come for you.\'\r\n\r\nBut the wretched man continued moaning, and began to weep, distracted\r\nthat the longed-for happiness should be fleeing away with the flow of\r\nhis blood. \'Take me away,\' he begged, \'take me away.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Captain Beaudoin, whose excited nerves were doubtless\r\nexasperated by this plaint, called for a couple of men to carry the\r\nsergeant to a little wood near by, where there was a field ambulance.\r\nAnticipating their comrades, Chouteau and Loubet at once bounded to\r\ntheir feet and took up the sergeant, one holding him under his armpits\r\nand the other by his feet. Then off they carried him at a run. On the\r\nway, however, they felt him stiffening, expiring in a last convulsion.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' said Loubet, \'he\'s dead. Let\'s drop him.\'\r\n\r\nBut Chouteau refused to do so, exclaiming in a fury: \'Just you run on,\r\nyou lazybones. Do you think I\'m such a fool as to drop him here for the\r\ncaptain to call us back?\'\r\n\r\nAccordingly they went on their way with the corpse until they reached\r\nthe little wood, where they flung it at the foot of a tree. Then they\r\nwent off, and were not seen again until the evening.\r\n\r\nThe firing was now becoming more and more violent, the battery which\r\nthe company was supporting having been reinforced by a couple of\r\nguns; and, in the increasing uproar, fear, mad fear, at last took\r\npossession of Maurice. At the outset he had been free from the cold\r\nperspiration that was now issuing from every pore of his skin, from the\r\npainful weakness that at present he felt in the pit of his stomach,\r\nthe well-nigh irresistible inclination that he experienced to rise up\r\nand rush away shrieking. And doubtless all this was but the result of\r\nreflection, as often happens with delicate, nervous natures. Jean,\r\nhowever, was watching him, and as soon as he detected this crisis of\r\ncowardice by the troubled wavering of his eyes, he caught hold of him\r\nwith his strong hand, and roughly prevented him from stirring. And,\r\nin a fatherly way, he whispered insulting words in his ear, trying to\r\nmake him feel ashamed of himself, for he knew that insults, and at\r\ntimes even kicks, are needed to restore some men\'s courage. Others also\r\nwere shivering. Pache had his eyes full of tears, and gave vent to a\r\ngentle, involuntary plaint, like the wailing of a little child, which\r\nhe was altogether unable to restrain. And Lapoulle\'s vitals were so\r\nstirred that he was taken quite ill. Several other men were similarly\r\ndistressed, and the scene which ensued led to much hooting and jeering,\r\nthe effect of which was to restore everybody\'s courage.\r\n\r\n\'You wretched coward!\' Jean repeated to Maurice, \'mind you don\'t behave\r\nlike them--I\'ll punch your head if you don\'t behave properly.\'\r\n\r\nHe was in this manner warming the young fellow\'s heart, when all at\r\nonce, at some four hundred yards in front of them, they perceived\r\na dozen men in dark uniforms emerging from a little wood. At last,\r\nthen, there were the Prussians--easily recognisable by their spiked\r\nhelmets--the first Prussians they had seen within range of their\r\nchassepots since the outset of the campaign. Other squads followed the\r\nfirst one, and in front of them one could see the little clouds of dust\r\nthrown up by the shells. Everything was very small, yet delicately\r\nprecise; the Prussians looked like so many little tin soldiers set\r\nout in good order. However, as the shells from the French batteries\r\nrained upon them in increasing numbers, they soon fell back again,\r\ndisappearing behind the trees.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Beaudoin\'s men had seen them, and fancied they could see\r\nthem still. The chassepots had gone off of their own accord. Maurice\r\nwas the first to fire. Jean, Pache, Lapoulle, all the others followed\r\nhis example. There had been no command to fire; in fact, the captain\r\nwished to stop it, and only gave way on Rochas making a gesture\r\nimplying that it was absolutely necessary the men should thus ease\r\ntheir feelings. So at last they were firing, employing those cartridges\r\nwhich they had been carrying in their pouches for more than a month\r\npast, without an opportunity of burning a single one of them. Maurice,\r\nespecially, was quite enlivened. Thus occupied, he forgot his fright.\r\nThe detonations drove away his thoughts. Meantime, the verge of the\r\nwood remained desolate. Not a leaf was stirring there, not a Prussian\r\nhad reappeared, yet the men continued firing at the motionless trees.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, having raised his head, Maurice was surprised to\r\nsee Colonel de Vineuil on his big horse, only a few paces away; both\r\nman and beast looking as impassive as though they were of stone. With\r\nhis face to the foe, the colonel remained there, whilst the bullets\r\nrained around him. The entire regiment must now have fallen back to\r\nthis point, other companies were lying down in neighbouring fields,\r\nand the fusillade was spreading right along the line. And, slightly in\r\nthe rear, Maurice also saw the colours, borne aloft by the strong arm\r\nof the sub-lieutenant, who carried them. But they were no longer the\r\nphantom colours which the morning fog had obscured. The gilded eagle\r\nwas shining radiantly under the fierce sunbeams, and vividly glared\r\nthe silk of the three colours, despite all the glorious wear and tear\r\nof bygone battles. Against the bright blue sky, amid the wind of the\r\ncannonade, the flag was waving like a flag of victory.\r\n\r\nAnd now that they were fighting, why should not victory be theirs?\r\nWith desperate, maddened rage, Maurice and his comrades continued\r\nburning their cartridges, shooting at the distant wood, where twigs and\r\nbranches were slowly and silently raining upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nINSIDE SEDAN: NAPOLEON\'S MIDNIGHT AGONY--TWO WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHenriette was unable to sleep that night. She was worried by the\r\nthought that her husband was at Bazeilles so near the German lines. In\r\nvain did she repeat to herself the promise he had made her to return\r\nat the first sign of danger; and in vain at each moment did she pause\r\nin her work to listen, fancying she could hear him coming. Towards ten\r\no\'clock, when it was time for her to go to bed, she opened the window,\r\nand remained there, looking out, with her elbow resting on the sill.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark, and down below she could scarcely distinguish\r\nthe pavement of the Rue des Voyards, a narrow, gloomy passage hemmed\r\nin by old houses. The only light was a smoky, star-like lamp some\r\ndistance away, in the direction of the college. And from the depths\r\nbeneath there ascended a cellar-like, saltpetrous smell, the occasional\r\ncaterwauling of some angry tom, the heavy footfall of some soldier who\r\nhad lost his way. Moreover, unaccustomed noises resounded through Sedan\r\nbehind her, sudden gallops, continuous rumblings, which sped along like\r\nthreats of death. She listened, with her heart beating loudly, but\r\nstill and ever she failed to recognise the steps of her husband coming\r\nround the corner.\r\n\r\nHours went by, and she became anxious concerning the distant glimmers\r\nwhich she could espy along the country side, beyond the ramparts.\r\nIt was so dark that she had to picture the situation of the various\r\nlocalities. That huge pale sheet down below was evidently the water\r\ncovering the flooded meadows. But what was that fire which she had\r\nseen flare up and then die away, over yonder, doubtless on the Marf\xc3\xa9e\r\nhill? And there were other fires flaming all along the hills, at\r\nPont-Maugis, Noyers, and Fr\xc3\xa9nois, mysterious fires vacillating above\r\nan innumerable multitude, swarming there in the darkness. But it was\r\nespecially the extraordinary sounds which she heard that made her\r\nstart and tremble--the tramping of a people on the march, the panting\r\nof horses, the clang of arms, quite a chevachie passing along afar\r\noff, in the depths of that dim inferno. Suddenly the booming of\r\na cannon resounded, one formidable, frightful report, followed by\r\nperfect silence. It froze all the blood in her veins. What could it\r\nbe? A signal, no doubt--a signal that some movement had succeeded, an\r\nannouncement that they were ready over yonder, and that the sun might\r\nnow rise when he pleased.\r\n\r\nAt about two in the morning Henriette, still dressed, threw herself\r\nupon her bed, neglecting even to close the window. She was quite\r\novercome with fatigue and anxiety. What could be the matter with her,\r\nthat she should now be shivering with fever like that--she, as a rule,\r\nso calm, with so light a step that one heard her no more than if she\r\nhad not existed? She slept painfully, numbed as it were, but with a\r\npersistent consciousness of the catastrophe that weighed so heavily\r\nin the black atmosphere. All at once, in the midst of her uneasy\r\nslumber, the voice of the cannon was heard again; dull, distant reports\r\nresounded; and now the firing went on regularly, stubbornly, without\r\ncessation. She sat up on her bed shuddering. Where was she? She no\r\nlonger recognised, no longer even saw the room, which seemed to be full\r\nof dense smoke. Then all at once she understood that the mist rising\r\nfrom the neighbouring river must have entered through the open window.\r\nOutside, the guns were now sounding more frequently. She sprang off the\r\nbed and hastened to the window to listen.\r\n\r\nFour o\'clock was striking from one of the steeples of Sedan. The\r\nmorning twilight was breaking, dim, undecided in the dun-coloured mist.\r\nIt was impossible to see anything; she could no longer distinguish\r\neven the college buildings a few yards away. Where were they firing,\r\ngood heavens? Her first thought was for her brother, Maurice, for the\r\nreports were so deadened by the fog that they seemed to her to come\r\nfrom the north, right over the town. Then, however, it appeared certain\r\nthat the firing was in front of her, and she trembled for her husband.\r\nYes, the firing was undoubtedly at Bazeilles. For a few moments,\r\nhowever, she felt reassured, for it seemed to her, every now and then,\r\nas though the reports were, after all, coming from her right. Perhaps\r\nthey were fighting at Donchery, where the bridge, as she was aware,\r\nhad not been blown up. And now the most frightful perplexity took\r\npossession of her--were they firing from Donchery or from Bazeilles?\r\nIt was impossible for her to tell, there was such a continuous buzzing\r\nin her ears. At last her anguish of mind became so acute that she\r\nfelt unable to remain waiting there any longer. She quivered with an\r\nunrestrainable desire to know the truth at once, and throwing a shawl\r\nover her shoulders she went out in search of information.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment as she reached the Rue des Voyards down\r\nbelow, for the town still seemed so black in the opaque fog that\r\nenveloped it. The morning twilight had not yet reached the damp\r\npavement between the smoky old house-fronts. The only persons she\r\nperceived as she went along the Rue au Beurre were two drunken Turcos\r\nwith a girl, inside a low tavern where a candle was flickering. She\r\nhad to turn into the Rue Maqua to find some animation--soldiers whose\r\nshadows glided furtively along the footways: cowards, possibly, in\r\nsearch of a hiding place; together with a big cuirassier who had lost\r\nhimself, and who knocked at each door he came to, searching for his\r\ncaptain; and there was also a stream of civilians, perspiring with fear\r\nat the idea that they had so long delayed their departure, and packing\r\nthemselves closely in carts, to see if there were still time to get to\r\nBouillon in Belgium, whither half of Sedan had been emigrating for two\r\ndays past.\r\n\r\nHenriette was instinctively bound for the Sub-Prefecture, where she\r\nfelt certain she would gain some information; and, to avoid being\r\naccosted, the idea occurred to her of cutting through the side\r\nstreets. But she was unable to pass along the Rue du Four and the Rue\r\ndes Laboureurs: they were blocked with cannon, endless rows of guns,\r\ncaissons, and ammunition waggons, which had been huddled together there\r\nthe day before, and seemed to have been forgotten. There was not even\r\na sentry mounting guard over them; and the sight of all that gloomy,\r\nunutilised artillery, slumbering in abandonment in the depths of those\r\ndeserted by-ways, chilled Henriette\'s heart. She now had to retrace her\r\nsteps by way of the Place du Coll\xc3\xa8ge towards the high street, where,\r\noutside the H\xc3\xb4tel de l\'Europe, she saw some orderlies holding horses,\r\nand waiting for a party of field officers, whose voices resounded\r\nloudly in the brightly illuminated dining-room. People were still more\r\nplentiful on the Place du Rivage and the Place Turenne, where groups\r\nof anxious townsfolk, women and children, were mingled with scared,\r\ndisbanded soldiers, going hither and thither; and she saw a general\r\nrush swearing out of the Golden Cross Hotel and gallop off in a rage at\r\nthe risk of knocking everybody down. For a moment she seemed to think\r\nof entering the town-hall; however she ultimately turned into the Rue\r\ndu Pont-de-Meuse to reach the Sub-Prefecture.\r\n\r\nAnd never before in her eyes had Sedan presented such a tragic aspect\r\nas that which it now wore in the dim, dirty morning twilight, full of\r\nfog. The houses seemed to be dead; many of them were empty, abandoned\r\na couple of days since; and others, where fear-fraught insomnia could\r\nbe divined, remained hermetically closed. With all those streets\r\nstill half deserted, peopled merely with anxious shadows, traversed\r\nby abrupt departures in the midst of all the laggard soldiers who had\r\nbeen roaming about since the previous day, it was a morning to make\r\none fairly shiver. The light would gradually increase, and by-and-by\r\nthe town would be crowded, submerged by the impending disaster; but as\r\nyet it was only half-past five, and so far one could barely hear the\r\ncannonade, its booming being deadened by the lofty black houses.\r\n\r\nHenriette was acquainted with the daughter of the door-portress at\r\nthe Sub-Prefecture. Rose was the girl\'s name; she was a pretty,\r\ndelicate-looking, little blonde, and worked at Delaherche\'s factory.\r\nWhen Henriette stepped into the lodge the mother was not there, but\r\nRose greeted her with her accustomed amiability. \'Oh, my dear lady, we\r\ncan no longer keep on our legs,\' said she; \'mother has had to go and\r\nlie down a little. Just fancy, what with all the comings and goings, we\r\nhave had to remain on foot all night!\'\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for any questions she rattled on and on, feverishly\r\nexcited by the many extraordinary things that she had seen since the\r\nday before. \'The marshal has slept well,\' she said. \'But that poor\r\nEmperor! No, you can\'t imagine how dreadfully he suffers! Last night\r\nI went up to help give out some linen, and just as I was passing\r\nthrough a room next to the dressing-room I heard some moaning--oh! such\r\ndreadful moaning, as though somebody was dying. It made me tremble\r\nall over; and it froze my heart when I learned it was the Emperor. It\r\nappears he has a dreadful illness which makes him cry out like that. He\r\nrestrains himself when anybody\'s there, but as soon as he\'s alone it\r\nmasters him, and he calls out and complains--it\'s enough to make your\r\nhair stand on end.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know where they are fighting this morning?\' interrupted\r\nHenriette.\r\n\r\nRose dismissed the question, however, with an impatient wave of the\r\nhand. \'So you understand,\' said she, \'I wanted to know how he was, and\r\nI went up four or five times during the night and listened, with my ear\r\nto the partition--and each time that I went I heard him moaning and\r\ncomplaining, and he didn\'t cease, he didn\'t close his eyes for a moment\r\nall night long, I\'m sure of it. How terrible, isn\'t it, to suffer\r\nlike that with all the worry he has? For everything\'s in confusion, a\r\nregular scramble. They all seem to have lost their senses! The doors do\r\nnothing but bang, fresh people are always coming. Some of them fly in\r\na rage, and others cry. The house is quite topsy-turvy; everything\'s\r\nbeing pillaged. I assure you I saw some officers drinking out of the\r\nbottles last night, and some of them even went to bed in their big\r\nboots. And after all it\'s the Emperor who\'s the best of the lot, and\r\nwho takes up the least room in the little corner where he hides himself\r\nto moan.\'\r\n\r\nThen, as Henriette repeated her question, Rose replied: \'Where they\r\nare fighting? It\'s at Bazeilles--they\'ve been fighting there since\r\ndaybreak! A soldier on horseback came to tell the marshal, and he at\r\nonce went to the Emperor to let him know. The marshal has already been\r\ngone some ten minutes or so, and I think the Emperor\'s going to join\r\nhim, for they are dressing him upstairs. I was up there just now, and I\r\ncaught sight of his valet combing and curling him, and doing all sorts\r\nof things to his face.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette, however, now had the information she desired, and therefore\r\nturned to go: \'Many thanks, Rose, I\'m in a hurry,\' she said; whereupon\r\nthe young girl, complaisantly accompanying her as far as the street,\r\nreplied: \'Oh, I\'m quite at your service, Madame Weiss. I know that one\r\ncan tell _you_ everything.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette quickly returned to her home in the Rue des Voyards. She felt\r\nconvinced that she would now find her husband there; and, reflecting\r\nthat he would be alarmed by her absence, she hastened her steps. She\r\nraised her head as she drew near to the house, almost fancying that\r\nshe could see him leaning out of the window, watching for her. But\r\nno, there was nobody at the window, which was still wide open. And\r\nwhen she had climbed the stairs, and given a glance into each of\r\nthe three rooms, she stopped short thunderstruck, her heart filled\r\nwith anguish at only finding there that same icy fog, deadening the\r\nincessant commotion of the cannonade. They were still firing over\r\nyonder, and, for a moment, she returned to the window. The morning mist\r\nstill reared its impenetrable veil, but now that she was informed she\r\nimmediately realised that the struggle was going on at Bazeilles; she\r\ncould distinguish the crackling of the mitrailleuses, and the crashing\r\nvolleys of the French batteries, replying to the distant volleys of\r\nthe German ones. It seemed, too, as though the detonations were coming\r\nnearer; the battle was, every minute, growing more and more violent.\r\n\r\nWhy did not Weiss return? He had promised so positively that he\r\nwould come back at the first attack. Henriette\'s disquietude was\r\nincreasing; she pictured obstacles: the road might be cut, perhaps the\r\nshells already rendered a retreat too dangerous. And perhaps, too, an\r\nirreparable misfortune had happened. But she dismissed that thought,\r\nsustained by hope which urged her to action. For a moment she thought\r\nof going to Bazeilles, of starting to meet her husband. Then she\r\nhesitated, for they might cross one another on the way, and what would\r\nbecome of her if she should miss him? And how alarmed he would be if\r\nhe came home and did not find her there! On the other hand, however,\r\nbold as it was to think of going to Bazeilles at such a moment, it\r\nseemed to her a natural course to follow--the proper course, indeed,\r\nfor an active woman like herself, who did whatever was requisite in\r\nher household affairs without asking for instructions. And besides,\r\nwherever her husband was, she ought to be there too; that was the long\r\nand short of it.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, possessed by a fresh idea, she left the window,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\'And Monsieur Delaherche--I must see.\'\r\n\r\nIt had just occurred to her that the manufacturer also had spent the\r\nnight at Bazeilles, and that if he had returned he would be able to\r\ngive her some news of her husband. She swiftly went downstairs again,\r\nand this time, instead of passing out by way of the Rue des Voyards,\r\nshe crossed the narrow yard of the house, and followed the passage\r\nleading to the large factory buildings, whose monumental fa\xc3\xa7ade\r\noverlooked the Rue Maqua. As she reached the old central garden, now\r\npaved with stones, and retaining only a lawn girt round with superb\r\ntrees, gigantic elms of the last century, she was greatly surprised\r\nat sight of a sentry mounting guard in front of the closed doors of a\r\ncoach-house. Then she suddenly remembered why he was there. She had\r\nlearnt the day before that the treasury chest of the Seventh Army Corps\r\nhad been deposited there, and she experienced a singular feeling at\r\nthought of all that gold, millions of francs, so it was said, hidden\r\naway in that coach-house, whilst they were already killing one another\r\nover yonder.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the moment when she was beginning to ascend the servant\'s\r\nstaircase, on her way to Gilberte\'s room, she met with a fresh\r\nsurprise, indeed so unforeseen an encounter that she hastily stepped\r\ndown the three stairs which she had already climbed, doubting whether\r\nshe would still dare to go and knock at the door above. A soldier, a\r\ncaptain, had just tripped past her as lightly as a fleeting apparition,\r\nand yet she had had sufficient time to recognise him, having met him\r\nat Gilberte\'s house at Charleville in the days when she--Gilberte--was\r\nstill Madame Maginot. Henriette took a few steps across the courtyard,\r\nand looked up at the two lofty bedroom windows, the shutters of which\r\nwere still closed. Then, having come to a decision, she climbed the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nA friend since childhood, quite intimate with Gilberte, she\r\noccasionally went to chat with her of a morning; and she intended,\r\non reaching the first landing, to knock, as was her wont, at the\r\ndressing-room door. But she found that it had been left ajar, and she\r\nmerely had to push it open and cross the dressing-room to reach the\r\nbedchamber, an extremely lofty apartment, from the ceiling of which\r\ndescended flowing curtains of red velvet, enveloping a large bedstead.\r\nAll was quiet in this room, the atmosphere of which was saturated with\r\na vague perfume of lilac; there was merely a sound of calm breathing,\r\nand even that was so faint as to be scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\'Gilberte!\' called Henriette, gently. In the dim light that filtered\r\nthrough the red curtains drawn before the windows she could see her\r\nfriend\'s pretty round head, which had slipped from off the pillow and\r\nwas resting on one of her bare arms, whilst all around streamed her\r\nbeautiful black hair, which had become uncoiled. \'Gilberte!\'\r\n\r\nThe young woman moved, stretched herself, but did not at first open her\r\neyes. All at once, however, raising her head and recognising Henriette,\r\nshe exclaimed: \'Why, is it you? What o\'clock is it?\'\r\n\r\nWhen she learnt that six was striking she felt uncomfortable, and in\r\norder to hide it began jesting, asking whether that were a proper time\r\nto come and awaken people. Then, at the first question respecting her\r\nhusband, she exclaimed: \'But he hasn\'t come home. I hardly expect he\r\nwill be here before nine o\'clock. Why should he come back so early?\'\r\n\r\nAnd as she still continued smiling in her sleepy torpor, Henriette had\r\nto insist: \'But I tell you that they have been fighting at Bazeilles\r\nsince daybreak, and as I am very anxious about my husband----\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! my dear,\' exclaimed Gilberte, \'there is no occasion for anxiety.\r\nMy husband is so prudent that he would have been here long ago had\r\nthere been the slightest danger. As long as you don\'t see him you may\r\nbe quite easy.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette was impressed by this remark. Delaherche was certainly not\r\nthe man to expose himself unnecessarily. And, thereupon, feeling\r\nreassured, she approached the windows, drew back the curtains, and\r\nthrew the shutters open. The ruddy light from the sky where the sun was\r\nnow beginning to show itself, gilding the fog, streamed into the room.\r\nOne of the windows remained slightly open, and now in this large, warm\r\nchamber, so close and suffocating a moment previously, the cannon could\r\nbe distinctly heard.\r\n\r\nSitting up, with one elbow buried in the pillow, Gilberte gazed at the\r\nsky with her pretty, expressionless eyes. Her chemise had slipped from\r\none of her shoulders, and her skin looked beautifully pink and delicate\r\nunder her scattered locks of black hair. \'And so they are fighting,\'\r\nshe murmured. \'Fighting so early! How ridiculous it is to fight!\'\r\n\r\nHenriette, however, had just espied a pair of gloves, military gloves,\r\nlying forgotten upon a side table, and at this significant discovery\r\nshe could not restrain a start. Then Gilberte flushed a deep crimson,\r\nand drawing her friend to the side of the bed, in a confused, coaxing\r\nway, she hid her face against her shoulder. \'I felt you must know\r\nit, that you must have seen him,\' she murmured; \'you must not judge\r\nme too severely, darling. I have known him so long. You remember, at\r\nCharleville, I confessed to you----.\' And then, lowering her voice,\r\nshe continued, with a touch of emotion through which there stole,\r\nhowever, something like a little laugh: \'You do not know how he spoke\r\nto me when I met him again yesterday. And, only think, he has to fight\r\nthis morning, and perhaps he will be killed. What could I do?\' She\r\nhad simply wished that he might be happy before he went to risk his\r\nlife for his country on the battlefield. And such was her bird-like\r\ngiddiness, that it was this which somehow made her smile, despite all\r\nher confusion. \'Do you condemn me?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nHenriette had listened to her with a grave expression on her face. Such\r\nthings surprised her; she could not understand them. Doubtless she\r\nherself was different. Her heart was with her husband and her brother\r\nover yonder, where the bullets were raining. How was it possible to\r\nslumber peacefully, or think of passion, and smile and jest when loved\r\nones were in peril?\r\n\r\n\'But your husband, my dear, and that young fellow too; does it not stir\r\nyour heart not to be with them?\' she said. \'Think of it; they may be\r\nbrought back to you, dead, at any moment.\'\r\n\r\nWith a wave of her beautiful bare arm Gilberte swiftly drove the\r\nfrightful vision away. \'Good heavens! what\'s that you say? How cruel of\r\nyou to spoil my morning for me like that. No, no, I won\'t think of it;\r\nit is too dreadful.\'\r\n\r\nThen even Henriette could not help smiling. She remembered their\r\nchildhood, when Gilberte had been sent for the benefit of her\r\nhealth to a farm near Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux; her father, Commander de\r\nVineuil--Director of Customs at Charleville since his retirement from\r\nthe army in consequence of his wounds--having felt the more anxious\r\nabout her when he had found her coughing, as he was haunted by the\r\nremembrance of his young wife, carried off by phthisis a short time\r\npreviously. Gilberte was then only nine years old, but she was already\r\na turbulent coquette, fond of juvenile theatricals, invariably wishing\r\nto play the part of the queen, draped in all the scraps of finery\r\nshe could find, and carefully preserving the silver paper wrapped\r\nround her chocolate in order to make crowns and bracelets of it. And\r\nshe had remained much the same when in her twentieth year she had\r\nbecome the wife of M. Maginot of M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, an inspector of the State\r\nforests. M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res, which is cramped up within its ramparts, was not\r\nto her liking; she infinitely preferred the open, f\xc3\xaate-enlivened\r\nlife of Charleville, and continued residing there. Her father was\r\nno longer alive and she enjoyed complete liberty, her husband being\r\nsuch a perfect cipher that she in nowise troubled herself about him.\r\nProvincial malignity had bestowed many lovers upon her at that time,\r\nbut although, by reason of her father\'s old connections and her\r\nrelationship to Colonel de Vineuil, she lived amid a perfect stream of\r\nuniforms, she had really had but one weakness, and that for Captain\r\nBeaudoin. She was not of a perverse nature; she was simply giddy, fond\r\nof pleasure, and, if she had erred, it certainly seemed to be because\r\nof the irresistible need she experienced to be beautiful and gay.\r\n\r\n\'It was very wrong of you,\' said Henriette, at last, with a grave look.\r\n\r\nShe might have said more, but Gilberte with one of her pretty caressing\r\ngestures closed her mouth. And there they remained, neither speaking\r\nany further, but linked in an affectionate embrace albeit so dissimilar\r\nfrom one another. They could hear the beating of each other\'s hearts,\r\nand might have realised how different was their language--the one the\r\nheart of a woman who gave herself up to mirth, who wasted and frittered\r\naway her life; the other a heart that was bound up in one unique\r\ndevotion, full of the great, mute heroism of a strong and lofty soul.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s true; they are fighting,\' Gilberte at last exclaimed. \'I must\r\nmake haste and dress.\'\r\n\r\nThe detonations seemed to have been growing louder since silence had\r\nreigned in the room. Gilberte sprang out of bed, and, unwilling to\r\nsummon her maid, asked Henriette to help her. She put on a dress and a\r\npair of boots, so that she might be ready either to receive or to go\r\nout, and she was hastily dressing her hair--indeed, had almost finished\r\ndoing so--when there came a knock at the door, and, on recognising the\r\nvoice of old Madame Delaherche, she ran to open it. \'Certainly, mother\r\ndear, you can come in,\' she said, and with her usual thoughtlessness\r\nshe ushered her mother-in-law into the room, forgetting that the gloves\r\nwere still lying on the side-table.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Henriette dart forward to take and throw them behind an\r\narm-chair. They must have been seen by the old lady, for she stopped\r\nshort as if she were stifling, as though unable to catch her breath.\r\nBut at last, after glancing around the room, she said: \'So Madame Weiss\r\ncame up to wake you. Were you able to sleep, then?\'\r\n\r\nShe had evidently not come for the mere purpose of talking in that\r\nstrain. Ah! that unfortunate second marriage which her son had insisted\r\nupon, despite all her remonstrances, which he had contracted after\r\ntwenty years of frigid matrimony with a skinny, sulky wife! During\r\nall that time he had been so sensible and reasonable, and then, all\r\nat once, at fifty years of age, he had been carried away by quite a\r\nyouthful desire for that pretty widow, so frivolous and gay. She, the\r\nmother, had vowed that she would watch over the present, and now\r\nhere was the past coming back again! But ought she to speak out? Her\r\npresence in the house nowadays was like a silent blame, and she almost\r\nalways remained in her own room occupied with her devotions. This time,\r\nhowever, the wrong was so serious that she resolved to warn her son.\r\n\r\n\'You know that Jules has not come back?\' said Gilberte.\r\n\r\nThe old lady nodded. Since the beginning of the cannonade she had felt\r\nanxious, and had been watching for her son\'s return. She was, however,\r\na brave mother. And now she remembered for what reason she had come\r\nupstairs. \'Your uncle, the colonel,\' she said to her daughter-in-law,\r\n\'has sent us Major Bouroche with a note in pencil, asking if we will\r\nallow an ambulance to be installed here. He knows that we have plenty\r\nof room in the factory, and I have already placed the drying room and\r\nthe courtyard at the gentlemen\'s disposal. Only, you ought to come\r\ndown.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! at once, at once!\' said Henriette, stepping forward, \'we will\r\nhelp.\'\r\n\r\nGilberte herself gave signs of emotion, and became quite enraptured\r\nwith the idea of playing the nurse, which to her was a novel part. She\r\nbarely took time to fasten a strip of lace over her hair, and the three\r\nwomen thereupon went down.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they reached the spacious porch, when, the gate being\r\nopen, they saw that a crowd had assembled in the street. A low vehicle\r\nwas slowly approaching, a kind of tilted cart drawn by one horse,\r\nwhich a lieutenant of Zouaves was leading. They at once thought that a\r\nwounded man was being brought to them.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, it\'s here; come in!\'\r\n\r\nBut they learned that they were mistaken. The wounded man lying in the\r\ncart was Marshal MacMahon, whose left hip had been half carried away by\r\na splinter of a shell, and who, after a first dressing at a gardener\'s\r\nlittle house, was now being taken to the Sub-Prefecture. His head was\r\nbare, he was half undressed, and the gold embroidery of his uniform\r\nwas soiled with dust and blood. He did not speak, but he had raised\r\nhis head and was glancing vaguely around him. On perceiving the three\r\nwomen who stood there painfully impressed, their hands clasped at sight\r\nof the great misfortune that was passing--the whole army struck in the\r\nperson of its commander at the very first shells fired by the foe--he\r\nmade a slight inclination of the head, smiling feebly in a paternal\r\nway. Some of the bystanders respectfully uncovered, whilst others\r\nbustled about, relating that General Ducrot had just been appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief. It was now half-past seven o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\'And the Emperor?\' asked Henriette of a bookseller who was standing at\r\nhis door near by.\r\n\r\n\'He passed about an hour ago. I followed him, and saw him go off by the\r\nBalan gate. There\'s a report that a cannon ball has carried off his\r\nhead.\'\r\n\r\nAt this, however, a grocer over the way became quite indignant. \'It\'s\r\nall a pack of lies,\' said he. \'Only brave men come to any harm.\'\r\n\r\nThe cart conveying the marshal was now drawing near to the Place du\r\nColl\xc3\xa8ge, where it became lost to view amid a swelling crowd, through\r\nwhich the most extraordinary rumours from the battlefield were already\r\ncirculating. The fog was at last dispersing, and the streets were\r\nfilling with sunlight.\r\n\r\n\'Now, ladies, it isn\'t outside, but here that you are wanted,\' a gruff\r\nvoice suddenly called from the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThey all three went in again, and found themselves in presence of Major\r\nBouroche, who had already flung his uniform in a corner and donned a\r\nlarge white apron. Above all this whiteness, as yet unspotted, that\r\nhuge head of his, covered with coarse bristling hair, that lion-like\r\ncountenance was glowing with haste and energy. And so terrible did he\r\nseem to them, that they at once became his slaves, obedient to his beck\r\nand call, and bustling about to satisfy him.\r\n\r\n\'We have nothing,\' said he; \'give me some linen. Try and find me some\r\nmore mattresses. Show my men where the pump is.\' And thereupon they ran\r\nhither and thither, and multiplied themselves as though they were his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nIt was a capital idea to select the factory for an ambulance. Merely\r\nin the drying room, a vast hall with large windows, there was ample\r\nspace to make up a hundred beds, and an adjoining shed would suit\r\nremarkably well as an operating room. A long table had just been placed\r\nin it; the pump was only a few steps off, and the men who were but\r\nslightly wounded could wait on the lawn near by. And, moreover, it was\r\nall so very pleasant with those beautiful old elms, which spread such\r\ndelightful shade around.\r\n\r\nBouroche had preferred to establish his quarters inside Sedan\r\nimmediately; for he foresaw the massacre, the fearful onslaught which\r\nwould eventually throw the troops into the town. He had therefore\r\ncontented himself with leaving a couple of field ambulances with the\r\nSeventh Corps in the rear of Floing; and the injured men, after having\r\ntheir wounds summarily dressed there, were to be sent on to him.\r\nAll the bearer-squads had remained with the troops for the purpose\r\nof picking up the wounded on the field, and the entire transport\r\n_mat\xc3\xa9riel_--stretchers, waggons, vans--was with them. And, on the\r\nother hand, excepting a couple of assistant surgeons, whom he had left\r\nin charge of the field-ambulances, Bouroche had brought with him to\r\nthe factory his entire medical staff, two second-class surgeons, and\r\nthree under-assistant surgeons, who would no doubt suffice for the\r\noperations that might have to be performed. He also had with him three\r\napothecaries and a dozen infirmary attendants.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not cease fuming, for he could never do anything\r\notherwise than in a passionate way: \'What the deuce are you up to? Just\r\nplace those mattresses closer together! We\'ll lay some straw in that\r\ncorner if necessary!\' he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe cannon was growling, and he knew very well that work--waggon-loads\r\nof mangled, bleeding flesh--would be arriving at the factory in a few\r\nmoments; so with violent haste he got everything ready in the large\r\nhall which as yet was empty. Then, other preparations had to be made\r\nunder the shed, the pharmaceutical and dressing chests were opened\r\nand set out on a plank, with packets of lint, rollers, compresses,\r\nlinen-cloths, and fracture bandages; whilst on another plank, beside\r\na large pot of cerate and a bottle of chloroform, the cases of bright\r\nsteel instruments were spread out--the probes, forceps, catlings,\r\nscissors, saws, quite an arsenal of everything pointed and cutting,\r\neverything that searches, opens, gashes, slices, and lops off. There\r\nwas, however, a lack of basins.\r\n\r\n\'You must have some pans or pails, or earthenware pots,\' said Bouroche;\r\n\'give us whatever you like. Of course we are not going to smear\r\nourselves with blood up to our eyes. And some sponges, too; try and get\r\nme some sponges.\'\r\n\r\nOld Madame Delaherche went off at once, and returned with three\r\nservant girls carrying all the pans she could find. Gilberte, standing\r\nmeanwhile before the instrument cases, signed to Henriette to approach,\r\nand, with a faint shudder, showed her the terrific arsenal. And then\r\nthey remained standing there in silence, holding each other by the\r\nhand, their grasp pregnant with all the vague terror and anxious pity\r\nthat agitated them.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my dear, just think of having a leg or an arm cut off!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor fellows!\'\r\n\r\nBouroche had just placed a mattress on the long table in the shed,\r\nand was covering it with some oilcloth, when the stamping of horses\r\nwas heard under the porch. It was the first ambulance waggon entering\r\nthe courtyard. The ten men, seated face to face in the vehicle, were,\r\nhowever, only slightly wounded: a few who were injured in the head had\r\ntheir foreheads bandaged, whilst each of the others had an arm in a\r\nsling. They alighted with a little assistance, and the inspection at\r\nonce began.\r\n\r\nWhilst Henriette was gently helping a young fellow, with a bullet in\r\nhis shoulder, to take off his capote, an operation which drew from\r\nhim many cries of pain, she noticed the number of his regiment on his\r\ncollar. \'Why, you belong to the 106th,\' said she; \'are you in Captain\r\nBeaudoin\'s company?\'\r\n\r\nNo, he was in Captain Ravaud\'s, he replied; but all the same he knew\r\nCorporal Jean Macquart, and he felt certain that the latter\'s squad had\r\nnot yet taken part in the fighting. This information, vague as it was,\r\nsufficed to make the young woman quite cheerful: her brother was alive\r\nand she would feel altogether at her ease as soon as she had kissed her\r\nhusband, whose arrival she was still every minute expecting.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, as she raised her head she was thunderstruck\r\nto see Delaherche standing in a group a few paces off, engaged in\r\nrecounting all the terrible dangers through which he had just passed on\r\nhis way back from Bazeilles. How did he happen to be there? She had not\r\nseen him come in.\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t my husband with you?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nDelaherche, however, whom his mother and wife were complaisantly\r\nquestioning, was in no hurry to answer her. \'Wait a bit,\' said he, and\r\nreturning to his narrative he continued: \'I was nearly killed a score\r\nof times between Bazeilles and Balan. There was a perfect hurricane of\r\nbullets and shells. And I met the Emperor--oh! he was very brave--and\r\nthen I ran from Balan here----\'\r\n\r\n\'My husband?\' asked Henriette, shaking his arm.\r\n\r\n\'Weiss? Why, he stopped there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stopped there!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he picked up a dead soldier\'s chassepot, and he\'s fighting!\'\r\n\r\n\'Fighting, how\'s that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! he was quite mad! He wouldn\'t come, though I asked him over and\r\nover again to do so, and at last, of course, I left him----\'\r\n\r\nHenriette was gazing at Delaherche with fixed, dilated eyes. A pause\r\nensued, during which she quietly made up her mind. \'Then I\'m going\r\nthere,\' she said.\r\n\r\nGoing there, indeed! But it was impossible, senseless. And again did\r\nDelaherche talk of the bullets and shells that were sweeping the road.\r\nGilberte, too, again took hold of her hands, this time to detain her;\r\nwhilst old Madame Delaherche did all she could to show her how blindly\r\nrash her project was. But with that unpretending, gentle air of hers,\r\nshe repeated: \'It is of no use talking to me; I am going.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she became obstinate, and would take no advice, accept nothing\r\nbut the strip of black lace that covered Gilberte\'s head. Hoping\r\nthat he might still convince her of her folly, Delaherche ended by\r\ndeclaring that he would accompany her at least as far as the Balan\r\ngate. However, he had just caught sight of the sentry who, amid all the\r\nconfusion occasioned by the establishment of the ambulance, had not\r\nceased marching slowly up and down in front of the coach-house, where\r\nthe treasure chest of the Seventh Corps was deposited; and suddenly\r\nremembering it, and feeling anxious for its safety, Delaherche went to\r\nglance at the coach-house door by way of making sure that the millions\r\nwere still there. Henriette, meanwhile, turned towards the porch.\r\n\r\n\'Wait for me!\' exclaimed the manufacturer. \'Upon my word you are every\r\nbit as mad as your husband!\'\r\n\r\nIt so happened that another ambulance cart was just then arriving,\r\nand they had to step aside to let it pass. It was a smaller vehicle\r\nthan the first, on two wheels only, and contained a couple of men both\r\nseverely wounded and lying on sacking. The first, who was taken out\r\nwith every kind of precaution, appeared to be one mass of bleeding\r\nflesh; one of his hands was shattered, and his side had been ripped\r\nopen by a splinter of a shell. The other had his right leg crushed.\r\nHe was immediately laid up on the oilcloth, covering the mattress on\r\nthe long table, and Bouroche began to perform his first operation,\r\nwhilst his assistants and the attendants hurried hither and thither.\r\nMeanwhile, old Madame Delaherche and Gilberte sat on the lawn, busily\r\nrolling linen bands.\r\n\r\nDelaherche overtook Henriette just outside. \'Now surely, my dear Madame\r\nWeiss,\' said he, \'you are not going to do anything so rash--how can you\r\npossibly join Weiss over there? Besides, he can\'t be there now, he must\r\nhave come away; no doubt he\'s returning through the fields. I assure\r\nyou you cannot possibly get to Bazeilles.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not listen to him, however; she hastened her steps and turned\r\ninto the Rue du M\xc3\xa9nil to reach the Balan gate. It was nearly nine\r\no\'clock, and nothing in the aspect of Sedan now suggested that black\r\nshivering of a few hours previously, that lonesome, groping awakening\r\namid the dense fog. At present an oppressive sun clearly outlined the\r\nshadows cast by the houses, and the paved streets were obstructed by an\r\nanxious crowd through which estafettes were continually galloping. The\r\ntownsfolk clustered more particularly around the few unarmed soldiers\r\nwho had already come in from the battle, some of them slightly wounded,\r\nothers shouting and gesticulating, in an extraordinary state of nervous\r\nexcitement. And yet the town would almost have worn its everyday aspect\r\nhad it not been for the closed shops, the lifeless house-fronts, where\r\nnot a shutter was opened; and had it not been also for the cannonade,\r\nthat incessant cannonade, that shook every stone, the roadways, the\r\nwalls, and even the slates of the house-roofs.\r\n\r\nA most unpleasant conflict was going on in the mind of Delaherche.\r\nOn the one hand was his duty as a brave man, which required that he\r\nshould not leave Henriette; on the other, his terror at the thought\r\nof going back to Bazeilles, through the shells. All at once, just as\r\nthey were reaching the Balan gate, they were separated by a stream of\r\nmounted officers, returning from the fight. There was quite a crush of\r\ntownsfolk near this gate, waiting for news; and in vain did Delaherche\r\nrun hither and thither, looking for the young woman; she was gone,\r\nshe must have already passed the rampart, and was doubtless hurrying\r\nalong the road. He did not allow his zeal to take him any farther, but\r\nsuddenly caught himself exclaiming: \'Ah! well, so much the worse; it\'s\r\ntoo stupid!\'\r\n\r\nAnd then he began strolling through Sedan, like an inquisitive\r\n_bourgeois_ bent on missing none of the sights, though to tell the\r\ntruth he was now labouring under increasing disquietude. What would\r\nbe the end of it all? Would not the town suffer a great deal if the\r\narmy were beaten? Such were the questions he put to himself; but the\r\nanswers remained obscure, being almost wholly dependent on the course\r\nthat events might take. Nevertheless, he began to feel very anxious\r\nabout his factory, his house property in the Rue Maqua, whence, by the\r\nway, he had been careful to remove all his securities, burying them in\r\na safe place. At last he repaired to the town-hall, where, finding the\r\nmunicipal council assembled _en permanence_, he lingered a long while,\r\nwithout, however, learning anything fresh, except that the battle was\r\nprogressing unfavourably. The army no longer knew whom to obey--drawn\r\nback as it had been by General Ducrot during the two hours when he\r\nhad exercised the chief command, and suddenly thrown forward again by\r\nGeneral de Wimpffen, who had succeeded him; and these incomprehensible\r\nveerings, these positions which had to be reconquered after being\r\nabandoned, the utter absence of any plan, any energetic direction, all\r\ncombined to precipitate the disaster.\r\n\r\nDelaherche next went as far as the Sub-Prefecture to ascertain whether\r\nthe Emperor had returned. But here they could only give him news of\r\nMarshal MacMahon, who, having had his wound, which was of but little\r\ngravity, dressed by a surgeon, was now lying quietly in bed. At about\r\neleven o\'clock, however, whilst Delaherche was again roaming the\r\nstreets, he was stopped for a moment in the Grande Rue, just in front\r\nof the H\xc3\xb4tel de l\'Europe, by a cort\xc3\xa8ge of dusty horsemen, who were\r\nslowly walking their dejected steeds. And at the head of the party he\r\nrecognised the Emperor, who was now returning to his quarters after\r\nspending four hours on the battlefield. Decidedly, death had not\r\nbeen willing to take him. The perspiration caused by the anguish of\r\nthat long ride through the defeat, had made the paint trickle from\r\nhis cheeks, and softened the wax of his moustaches, which were now\r\ndrooping low, whilst his cadaverous countenance expressed the painful\r\nstupor of mortal agony. An officer, who alighted at the hotel, began\r\nto explain to a cluster of townsfolk that they had ridden all along\r\nthe little valley from La Moncelle to Givonne, among the troops of\r\nthe First Corps, whom the Saxons had thrown back on to the right bank\r\nof the stream; and they had returned by way of the hollow road of the\r\nFond-de-Givonne, which was already so obstructed that had the Emperor\r\ndesired to proceed once more to the front, he could only have done so\r\nwith very great difficulty. Besides, what would have been the good of\r\nit?\r\n\r\nWhilst Delaherche was listening to these particulars a violent\r\nexplosion shook the entire neighbourhood. A shell had just carried\r\naway a chimney in the Rue Ste.-Barbe near the Keep. There was quite\r\na _sauve-qui-peut_, and women were heard shrieking. For his own part\r\nhe had drawn close to a wall, when all at once another detonation\r\nshattered the window panes of a neighbouring house. Matters were\r\nbecoming terrible if the enemy were bombarding Sedan, and he hastened\r\nas fast as he could to the Rue Maqua, seized with so pressing a desire\r\nto ascertain the truth that, without pausing for a moment, he darted up\r\nthe stairs to a terrace on the roof, whence he could overlook the town\r\nand its environs.\r\n\r\nHe almost immediately felt somewhat reassured. The fight was being\r\nwaged over the housetops. The German batteries of La Marf\xc3\xa9e and Fr\xc3\xa9nois\r\nwere sweeping the plateau of Algeria beyond the town. For a moment\r\nDelaherche even became quite interested in watching the flight of the\r\nshells, the long curved sweep of light smoke which they left above\r\nSedan, like a slender track of grey feathers scattered by invisible\r\nbirds. At first it seemed to him evident that the few shells which had\r\ndamaged some of the roofs around him were simply stray projectiles.\r\nThe town was not as yet being bombarded. On a more careful inspection,\r\nhowever, it occurred to him that these shells must have been aimed in\r\nreply to the infrequent shots fired by the guns of Sedan itself. He\r\nthen turned round and began to examine the citadel on the northern\r\nside--a formidable, complicated mass of fortifications, huge pieces\r\nof blackened wall, green patches of glacis, a swarming of geometrical\r\nbastions, prominent among which were the threatening angles of three\r\ngigantic horn-works, Les Ecossais, Le Grand Jardin, and La Rochette;\r\nwhilst on the west, like a Cyclopean prolongation of the defences,\r\ncame the fort of Nassau, followed by that of the Palatinate, above\r\nthe suburb of Le M\xc3\xa9nil. This survey left him a melancholy impression,\r\nhowever. All these works were enormous, yet how child-like! Of what\r\npossible use were they nowadays, when artillery could so easily send\r\nprojectiles flying from one horizon to the other? Moreover, they were\r\nnot armed, they had neither the guns, nor the ammunition, nor the\r\nmen that were needed to turn them to account. Barely three weeks had\r\nelapsed since the Governor had begun to organise a national guard,\r\nformed of volunteer citizens, for the purpose of working the few guns\r\nthat were in a serviceable condition. It thus happened that three\r\ncannon were firing from the Palatinate fort, and perhaps half a dozen\r\nfrom the Paris gate. As, however, the ammunition was limited to seven\r\nor eight charges per gun, it was necessary to husband it, so that a\r\nshot was only fired every half-hour or so, and then simply for honour\'s\r\nsake; for the projectiles did not carry the required distance, but fell\r\nin the meadows just in front, for which reason the enemy\'s disdainful\r\nbatteries merely replied at long intervals, and as though out of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nIt was those batteries of the foe that interested Delaherche. His keen\r\neyes were exploring the slopes of the Marf\xc3\xa9e hill, when he suddenly\r\nremembered that he had a telescope which, by way of amusement, he had\r\nin former times often pointed on the environs from that very terrace.\r\nHe fetched it and set it in position, and whilst he was taking his\r\nbearings, slowly moving the instrument so that the fields, trees, and\r\nhouses passed in turn before him, his eyes fell on the same cluster of\r\nuniforms, grouped at the corner of a pine wood, above the great battery\r\nof Fr\xc3\xa9nois, that Weiss had faintly espied from Bazeilles. Delaherche,\r\nhowever, thanks to the magnifying power of his telescope could have\r\ncounted the officers of this staff, so plainly did he see them. Some\r\nwere reclining on the grass, others stood up, grouped together, and\r\nin advance of them was one man, all by himself, lean and slim, in a\r\nuniform free from all showiness, but whom he instinctively divined to\r\nbe the master. It was, indeed, the King of Prussia, barely half an inch\r\nhigh, like one of those diminutive tin soldiers that children play\r\nwith. Delaherche only became quite certain of it later on; still, from\r\nthat moment he scarcely took his eyes off that tiny little fellow whose\r\nface, the size of a pin\'s head, appeared simply like a pale spot under\r\nthe vast blue heavens.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet noon; the King was verifying the mathematical,\r\ninexorable march of his armies since nine o\'clock. They were ever\r\npressing onward and onward, following the routes traced out for them,\r\ncompleting the circle, and raising, step by step, around Sedan their\r\nwall of men and iron. That on the left, which had proceeded by way\r\nof the level plain of Donchery, was still debouching from the defile\r\nof St. Albert, passing beyond St. Menges, and beginning to reach\r\nFleigneux; and in the rear of his Eleventh Corps, hotly grappling with\r\nGeneral Douay\'s troops, the King could distinctly see the stealthy\r\nadvance of his Fifth Corps, which, under cover of the woods, was making\r\nfor the Calvary of Illy. And meantime batteries were being added to\r\nbatteries, the line of thundering guns was incessantly being prolonged,\r\nand the entire horizon was gradually becoming one belt of flames. The\r\narmy on the right hand henceforth occupied the whole valley of the\r\nGivonne; the Twelfth German Corps had seized La Moncelle, and the Guard\r\nhad just passed through Daigny, and was already ascending the banks of\r\nthe stream, also marching upon the Calvary of Illy, after compelling\r\nGeneral Ducrot to fall back behind the wood of La Garenne. One more\r\neffort and the Crown Princes of Prussia and Saxony would join hands\r\nover yonder, amid those bare fields on the very verge of the forest of\r\nthe Ardennes. South of Sedan one could no longer perceive Bazeilles; it\r\nhad disappeared in the smoke of the burning houses, in the dun-coloured\r\ndust of a furious struggle.\r\n\r\nAnd the King was tranquilly looking on, waiting as he had waited since\r\nthe early morning. One, two, perhaps three hours must still elapse:\r\nit was merely a question of time, one wheel was impelling another,\r\nthe pounding machine was at work, and would complete its task. The\r\nbattlefield was now contracting under the infinite expanse of sunny\r\nsky; all the furious _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_ of black specks was tumbling and settling\r\ncloser and closer around Sedan. In the town some window panes were\r\naglow; it seemed as though a house were burning on the left, near the\r\nFaubourg de la Cassine. Far around, however, in the once more deserted\r\nfields, towards Donchery and towards Carignan, there was a warm,\r\nluminous peacefulness that stretched in the powerful noontide glow over\r\nthe clear waters of the Meuse, over the trees so pleased with life, the\r\nlarge fertile expanses of arable land, and the broad emerald meadows.\r\n\r\nThe King, in a few words, had just asked for some information. He\r\nwished to know every move that was made, hold in his hand, as it were,\r\nthe human dust that he commanded on that colossal chessboard. On his\r\nright a flight of swallows, frightened by the cannonade, rose whirling,\r\nascended to a great height, and vanished southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA WOMAN\'S HEROISM--THE HORRORS OF BAZEILLES\r\n\r\n\r\nHenriette was at first able to walk rapidly along the road leading to\r\nBalan. It was barely more than nine o\'clock, and for some distance the\r\nbroad paved highway, edged with houses and gardens, was still free;\r\nthough towards the village it was becoming more and more obstructed\r\nby the flight of the inhabitants and the movements of the troops. At\r\neach fresh stream of the crowd that she encountered, she pressed close\r\nagainst the walls, or glided hither and thither, invariably contriving\r\nto pass on, no matter what obstacles there might be. And slight of\r\nfigure as she was, unobtrusive, too, in her dark dress, with her\r\nbeautiful fair hair and her little pale face half-hidden by Gilberte\'s\r\nblack lace _fichu_, she escaped the notice of those she met; and\r\nnothing was able to stay her light and silent steps.\r\n\r\nAt Balan, however, she found the road barred by a regiment of Marine\r\nInfantry--a compact mass of men who were waiting for orders, under the\r\nshelter of some large trees which hid them from the enemy. She rose\r\non tip-toe, but the column was of such length that she could not even\r\nsee the end of it. Nevertheless, she tried to slip by, seeking to make\r\nherself even smaller than she was. Elbows pushed her back, however; the\r\nbutt-ends of guns digged her in the sides, and when she had taken a\r\nscore of steps, loud shouts and protests rose up around her. A captain\r\nturned his head and angrily demanded: \'Here! woman, are you mad? Where\r\nare you going?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am going to Bazeilles.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! to Bazeilles?\'\r\n\r\nA general roar of laughter ensued. The men pointed her out to one\r\nanother, and jested. The captain, whom her answer had also enlivened,\r\nexclaimed: \'Well, if you are going to Bazeilles you ought to take us\r\nwith you, little one! We were there just now, and I hope we are going\r\nto return there. But I warn you that it\'s warm.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am going to Bazeilles to join my husband,\' declared Henriette in a\r\ngentle voice, her pale blue eyes retaining their expression of quiet\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAt this the men ceased laughing; and an old sergeant extricated her\r\nfrom the ranks and compelled her to retrace her steps. \'You can see\r\nvery well, my poor child,\' said he, \'that it is impossible for you to\r\npass. It isn\'t a woman\'s place to be at Bazeilles just now. You\'ll find\r\nyour husband again later on. Come, be reasonable!\'\r\n\r\nShe had to give way, and step back to the rear of the column; and\r\nthere she remained standing, at each minute rising upon tip-toe to\r\nlook along the road; for she was stubbornly bent upon resuming her\r\njourney as soon as this became possible. From the talk around her she\r\nderived some knowledge of the situation. Several officers were bitterly\r\ncomplaining of the orders to retreat which had caused them to abandon\r\nBazeilles at a quarter-past eight that morning, when General Ducrot on\r\nsucceeding the marshal had resolved to concentrate the entire army upon\r\nthe plateau of Illy. The worst was that the First Corps in surrendering\r\nthe valley of the Givonne to the Germans, had fallen back too soon, so\r\nthat the Twelfth Corps, already hotly attacked in front, had also been\r\noverlapped on the left. And, now that General de Wimpffen had succeeded\r\nGeneral Ducrot, the original plan was again in the ascendant, and\r\norders were coming to reconquer Bazeilles at any cost, and to throw the\r\nBavarians into the Meuse. Was it not really idiotic, however, that they\r\nshould have had to abandon this position, and now have to reconquer it\r\nwhen it was in possession of the enemy? They were quite willing to give\r\ntheir lives, but not for the mere fun of doing so.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a great rush of men and horses, and General de\r\nWimpffen galloped up, erect in his stirrups, his face aglow and his\r\nvoice greatly excited as he shouted: \'We cannot fall back, my lads;\r\nit would be the end of everything. If we must retreat we will retire\r\non Carignan and not on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res. But we will win! You beat them this\r\nmorning, and you will beat them again!\'\r\n\r\nThen away he galloped, going off by a road that ascended towards\r\nLa Moncelle; and the rumour spread that he had just had a violent\r\ndiscussion with General Ducrot, during which each had upheld his own\r\nplan and attacked the other\'s; one declaring that a retreat on M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res\r\nhad been an impossibility since the night before, whilst the other\r\npredicted that if they did not now retire to the plateau of Illy the\r\nentire army would be surrounded before evening. And they also accused\r\none another of knowing neither the district nor the real state of the\r\ntroops. The worst was, that both of them were in the right.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or so, pressing as was Henriette\'s desire to go forward,\r\nher attention had been diverted from her purpose. She had just\r\nrecognised some fugitives from Bazeilles stranded by the roadside--a\r\nfamily of poor weavers, the husband, the wife and their three girls,\r\nthe eldest of whom was only nine years old. They were so overcome, so\r\nutterly distracted by weariness and despair, that they had been able to\r\ngo no farther, but had sunk down against a wall. \'Ah! my dear lady,\'\r\nsaid the woman to Henriette, \'we have nothing left. Our house, you\r\nknow, was on the Place de l\'Eglise. A shell set it on fire, and I don\'t\r\nknow how the children and we two didn\'t leave our lives there.\'\r\n\r\nAt this remembrance the three little girls again began sobbing and\r\nshrieking, whilst the mother, with the gestures of one deranged, gave a\r\nfew particulars of their disaster: \'I saw the loom burn like a faggot\r\nof dry wood,\' said she; \'the bed, the furniture flamed up faster than\r\nstraw--and there was the clock too; yes, the clock which I didn\'t even\r\nhave time to carry away with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' swore the man, with his eyes full of big tear-drops, \'what\r\non earth will become of us?\'\r\n\r\nTo tranquillise them, Henriette replied in a voice that quivered\r\nslightly: \'At all events, you are together; neither of you has come to\r\nany harm, and you have your little girls with you too. You must not\r\ncomplain.\'\r\n\r\nThen she began to question them, anxious to know what was taking place\r\nat Bazeilles, whether they had seen her husband there, and what had\r\nbeen the condition of her house at the time they came away. In their\r\nshivering fright, however, they gave contradictory answers. No, they\r\nhad not seen Monsieur Weiss. But at this, one of the little girls\r\ndeclared that she _had_ seen him; he was lying on the footway, said\r\nshe, with a big hole in his head. Her father thereupon gave her a smack\r\nto teach her not to tell such stories, for a story it was, undoubtedly.\r\nAs for the house, that must have been standing when they came away; in\r\nfact, they now remembered noticing, as they passed it, that the door\r\nand the windows were all carefully closed, as if nobody were there.\r\nBesides, at that time, the Bavarians were only in possession of the\r\nPlace de l\'Eglise, and they had to conquer the village, street by\r\nstreet, house by house. Since then, however, they must have made no\r\nlittle progress, and at the present time, no doubt, all Bazeilles was\r\non fire.[27] And the wretched couple continued talking of all these\r\nthings with fumbling gestures of fear, evoking the whole frightful\r\nvision of flaming roofs, flowing blood, and corpses strewing the ground.\r\n\r\n\'And my husband?\' repeated Henriette.\r\n\r\nThey no longer answered her, however; they were sobbing, with their\r\nhands before their eyes. And she remained there consumed by atrocious\r\nanxiety, but erect and without weakening, merely a faint quiver causing\r\nher lips to tremble. What ought she to believe? In vain did she repeat\r\nthat the child must have been mistaken; still and ever she seemed to\r\nsee her husband lying across the road with a bullet in his head. Then,\r\ntoo, she was disquieted on thinking of the house where, so it seemed,\r\nevery shutter was closed. Why was that? Was he no longer there? All\r\nat once a conviction that he was dead froze her heart to the core.\r\nPerhaps, though, he was only wounded, and at this thought her urgent\r\nlonging to go there and be with him seized hold of her once more, and\r\nso imperiously that she would again have tried to make her way through\r\nthe ranks of the soldiers had not the bugles at that moment sounded the\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nMany of the young fellows gathered together here had come from Toulon,\r\nRochefort, or Brest, barely drilled, without ever having fired a shot\r\nin their lives, and yet they had been fighting since the morning as\r\nbravely and as stoutly as veterans. They, who had marched so badly\r\nfrom Rheims to Mouzon, weighed down by the unwonted task, were proving\r\nthemselves the best disciplined, the most fraternally united of all\r\nthe troops--linked together in presence of the enemy by a solid bond\r\nof duty and abnegation. The bugles had merely to sound and they were\r\nreturning to the fight, marching once more to the attack despite all\r\nthe anger that swelled their veins. Thrice had they been promised the\r\nsupport of a division which did not come, and they felt that they were\r\nbeing abandoned, sacrificed. To send them back to Bazeilles, like this,\r\nafter making them evacuate the village, was equivalent indeed to asking\r\neach one of them for his life. And they all knew it, and they all gave\r\ntheir lives without a thought of revolting. The ranks closed up, and\r\nthey advanced beyond the trees that screened them, to find themselves\r\nonce more among the bullets and the shells.\r\n\r\nHenriette gave a deep sigh of relief. So at last they were marching!\r\nShe followed, hoping to reach Bazeilles in company with the troops, and\r\nquite prepared to run, should they, on their side, do so. But they had\r\nalready halted again. The enemy\'s projectiles were now fairly raining\r\naround them, and to reoccupy Bazeilles each yard of the road had to\r\nbe conquered, the lanes, houses, and gardens recaptured both on the\r\nright and on the left. The men in the first ranks had opened fire, and\r\nthey now only advanced by fits and starts, long minutes being consumed\r\nin overcoming the slightest obstacles. And Henriette soon realised\r\nthat she would never get there if she continued remaining in the rear\r\nwaiting for victory. So she made up her mind, and threw herself between\r\ntwo hedges on the right hand, taking a path that descended towards the\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nHer project now was to get to Bazeilles by way of those vast\r\npasture-lands skirting the Meuse. But she had no very distinct idea how\r\nshe should manage this, and all at once she found her way barred by a\r\nlittle sea of still water. It was the inundation, the defensive lake\r\nformed by flooding the low ground, which she had altogether forgotten.\r\nFor a moment she thought of retracing her steps; then, skirting the\r\nedge of the water, at the risk of leaving her shoes in the mud, she\r\ncontinued on her way through the drenched grass, in which she sank up\r\nto her ankles. This was practicable for a hundred yards or so; but she\r\nwas then confronted by a garden wall. The ground descended at this\r\nspot, and the water washing the wall was quite six feet in depth. So\r\nit was impossible to pass that way. She clenched her little fists, and\r\nhad to put forth all her strength to bear up against this crushing\r\ndisappointment and refrain from bursting into tears. However, when\r\nthe first shock was over, she skirted the inclosure and found a lane\r\nrunning along between some scattered houses. And she now thought\r\nherself saved, for she was acquainted with that labyrinth, those bits\r\nof tangled paths whose skein, perplexing though it was, ended at last\r\nat the village.\r\n\r\nSo far there had been no shells to impede her progress, but all at\r\nonce, with her blood curdling and her face very pale, she stopped short\r\namid the deafening thunderclap of a frightful explosion, the blast of\r\nwhich enveloped her. A projectile had just burst a few yards ahead. She\r\nlooked round and examined the heights on the left bank of the river,\r\nwhere the smoke of the German batteries was ascending to the sky; then\r\nrealising whence the shell had come, she once more started off, with\r\nher eyes fixed upon the horizon, watching for the projectiles so as to\r\navoid them. Despite the mad temerity of her journey she retained great\r\n_sang-froid_, all the brave tranquillity that her little housewife\'s\r\nsoul was capable of showing. Her desire was to escape death, to find\r\nher husband, and bring him away that they might yet live together and\r\nbe happy. The shells were now falling without a pause, and she glided\r\nalong close to the walls, threw herself behind border-stones, and took\r\nadvantage of every nook that afforded the slightest shelter. But at\r\nlast there came an open space, a stretch of broken-up road which was\r\nalready covered with splinters; and she was waiting at the corner of\r\na shed, when all at once, level with the ground, she espied a child\'s\r\ninquisitive face peeping out of a hole. It was a little boy some\r\nten years old, barefooted, and wearing simply a shirt and a pair of\r\ntattered trousers--some ragamuffin of the roads whom the battle was\r\ngreatly amusing. His narrow black eyes were sparkling with delight, and\r\nat each detonation he gleefully exclaimed: \'Oh! how funny they are!\r\nDon\'t move, there\'s another one coming! Boum! Didn\'t that one make a\r\nrow? Don\'t move! Don\'t move!\' And, for his own part, he would dive into\r\nhis hole, reappear raising his wren-like head, and then dive again each\r\ntime a projectile fell.[28]\r\n\r\nHenriette now remarked that the shells were coming from the Liry hill,\r\nand that the batteries of Pont-Maugis and Noyers were firing only on\r\nBalan. She could distinctly perceive the smoke of each discharge, and\r\nalmost immediately afterwards she heard the hissing of the shell,\r\nfollowed by the detonation. A short pause must have occurred in the\r\nfiring, for at last she could only see some light vapour which was\r\nslowly dispersing.\r\n\r\n\'They must be drinking a glass,\' said the youngster; \'make haste, give\r\nme your hand; we\'ll get off.\'\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and forced her to follow him, and bending low they\r\nboth galloped, side by side, across the open space. At its farther\r\nextremity, as they were throwing themselves for shelter behind a rick,\r\nthey glanced round and saw another shell arrive, which fell right upon\r\nthe shed, at the very spot where they had been waiting a moment before.\r\nThe crash was frightful, the shed itself fell in a heap to the ground.\r\n\r\nAt this spectacle the urchin danced with senseless delight, considering\r\nit extremely funny. \'Bravo! there\'s a smash! All the same, it was time\r\nwe crossed!\'\r\n\r\nAnd now Henriette, for a second time, came upon impassable\r\nobstacles--garden walls with never a lane between them. Her little\r\ncompanion, however, kept on laughing, and declared that it was easy\r\nenough to pass if one chose to do so. Climbing on to the coping of a\r\nwall he assisted her over, and they jumped down into a kitchen garden\r\namong beds of beans and peas. There were walls all round, and in order\r\nto get out again they had to pass through a gardener\'s low house.\r\nWhistling and swinging his arms, the lad went on ahead, showing no\r\nsurprise at anything he saw. He opened a door, found himself in a room,\r\nand made his way into another one, where an old woman, probably the\r\nonly living creature who had remained in the place, was standing near a\r\ntable with a look of stupor. She gazed at these two strangers who were\r\nthus passing through her house; but she did not say a word to them, nor\r\ndid they speak to her. Once out of the house they found themselves in a\r\nlane which for a moment they were able to follow. Then, however, came\r\nother obstacles, and for half a mile or more, according to the chances\r\nof the road they contrived to make for themselves, it was frequently\r\nnecessary to climb over walls or creep through gaps in hedges, and\r\npass out by cart-shed doors, or ground-floor windows, by way of taking\r\na short cut. They could hear dogs howling, and once they were almost\r\nknocked down by a cow, which was fleeing at a mad gallop. However, they\r\nmust have been getting nigh, for a smell of fire was wafted to them,\r\nand large stretches of ruddy smoke were every minute veiling the sun,\r\nlike light, wavy fragments of crape.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, the urchin stopped, and, confronting Henriette,\r\ninquired: \'I say, Madame, pray where are you going like that?\'\r\n\r\n\'You can see very well. I\'m going to Bazeilles.\'\r\n\r\nHe whistled and burst into a shrill laugh, like a scapegrace playing\r\nthe truant from school, and having a fine time of it: \'To Bazeilles!\r\nOh! that\'s not my direction. I\'m going another way. Good day.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he turned on his heels and went off as he had come, and\r\nshe never knew where he had sprung from or whither he went. She had\r\nfound him in a hole, and she lost sight of him round a corner, and\r\nnever set eyes upon him again.\r\n\r\nHenriette experienced a singular sensation of fear when she once more\r\nfound herself alone. No doubt that puny child had scarcely been of any\r\nprotection, but his chatter had diverted her thoughts. And now she,\r\nwho was naturally so brave, had begun to tremble. The shells were no\r\nlonger falling, the Germans had ceased firing on Bazeilles, no doubt\r\nfor fear of killing their own men, who were masters of the village.\r\nBut for a few minutes already she had heard the whistling of bullets,\r\nthat blue-bottle kind of buzzing which she had been told about, and\r\nrecognised. So confused were all the noises of the rageful fight\r\nafar off, so violent was the universal clamour, that she could not\r\ndistinguish the crackling of the fusillade. All at once, whilst she\r\nwas turning the corner of a house, a dull thud resounding near her ear\r\nabruptly arrested her steps. A bullet had chipped some plaster from\r\nthe corner of the house-front, and she turned very pale. Then, before\r\nshe had time to ask herself if she would have sufficient courage to\r\npersevere, it seemed to her as though she were struck on the forehead\r\nby a blow from a hammer, and she fell on both knees, half stunned. A\r\nsecond bullet, in ricochetting, had grazed her forehead just above the\r\nleft eyebrow, badly bruising it, and carrying away a strip of skin. And\r\nwhen she withdrew her hands which she had raised to her forehead, she\r\nfound them red with blood. Beneath her fingers, however, she had felt\r\nher skull intact, quite firm; and to encourage herself she repeated\r\naloud: \'It is nothing, it is nothing. Come, I am surely not frightened;\r\nno, I am not frightened.\'\r\n\r\nAnd \'twas true; she picked herself up, and henceforth walked on\r\namong the bullets with the indifference of one detached from herself,\r\nwho has ceased to reason and gives her life. And she no longer even\r\nsought to protect herself, but went straight before her with her\r\nhead erect, hastening her steps only because of her desire to reach\r\nher destination. The projectiles were falling and flattening around\r\nher, and she narrowly missed being killed a score of times without\r\napparently being aware of it. Her lightsome haste, her silent feminine\r\nactiveness seemed to assist her as it were, to render her so slight\r\nand so agile amid the peril that she escaped it. At last she had\r\narrived at Bazeilles, and she at once cut across a field of lucern to\r\nreach the high road which passes through the village. Just as she was\r\nturning into it, on her right hand, a couple of hundred paces away,\r\nshe recognised her house, which was burning, the flames not showing\r\nin the brilliant sunlight, but the roof already half fallen in, and\r\nthe windows vomiting big whirling coils of black smoke. Then a gallop\r\ncarried her along; she ran breathlessly.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock, Weiss had found himself shut up there, separated from\r\nthe retreating troops. Immediately afterwards it had become impossible\r\nfor him to return to Sedan, for the Bavarians, streaming forth from the\r\npark of Montivilliers, intercepted the road. He was alone, with his\r\ngun and his remaining cartridges, when he suddenly espied at his door\r\na small detachment of soldiers, who, parted from their comrades, had\r\nremained behind like himself, and were seeking some place of shelter\r\nwhere they might, at any rate, sell their lives dearly. He hastily\r\nwent down to open the door, and the house henceforth had a garrison:\r\na captain, a corporal, and eight men, all of them beside themselves,\r\nquite maddened, and resolved upon no surrender.\r\n\r\n\'What! are you one of us, Laurent?\' exclaimed Weiss, surprised to see\r\namong the soldiers a young man in blue linen trousers and jacket, who\r\ncarried a chassepot which he had picked up beside some corpse.\r\n\r\nLaurent, a tall, thin fellow, thirty years of age, was a journeyman\r\ngardener of the neighbourhood. He had lately lost his mother and his\r\nwife, both carried away by the same malignant fever. \'Why shouldn\'t I\r\nbe one of you?\' he answered. \'I\'ve only my carcase left, and I can very\r\nwell give it. Besides, it amuses me, you know, for I\'m not a bad shot,\r\nand it would be good sport to bring down one of those brutes each time\r\nI fire.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the captain and the corporal had already begun to inspect\r\nthe house. Nothing could be done on the ground floor, so they contented\r\nthemselves with pushing a quantity of furniture before the door\r\nand the windows, with the view of barricading them as stoutly as\r\npossible. Then they organised the defence in the three little rooms\r\non the first floor and the garret up above; approving, by the way, of\r\nthe preparations that Weiss had already made, the mattresses placed\r\nagainst the shutters, and the loopholes devised in the latter between\r\nthe transverse laths. Whilst the captain was venturing to peep out to\r\nexamine the surroundings, he heard a child calling and crying. \'Who\'s\r\nthat?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nThen Weiss, in his mind\'s eye, again espied poor little Auguste in\r\nthe adjacent dyeworks, his face purple with fever as he lay between\r\nhis white sheets asking for something to drink, and calling for his\r\nmother, who could never more answer him; for she was lying across the\r\ntiled threshold with her head smashed to pieces. And as this vision\r\nrose up before him he made a sorrowful gesture, and replied: \'It\'s a\r\npoor little fellow whose mother has been killed by a shell, and who is\r\ncrying there, next door.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' muttered Laurent. \'What a price we shall have to make them\r\npay for it all!\'\r\n\r\nAs yet only some stray bullets had struck the house-front. Weiss and\r\nthe captain, accompanied by the gardener and two soldiers, had gone up\r\nto the garret, whence they could keep watch over the road. They could\r\nsee it obliquely as far as the Place de l\'Eglise, which was now in the\r\npossession of the Bavarians, who only continued advancing, however,\r\nwith great difficulty and extreme caution. A handful of soldiers, at\r\nthe corner of a lane, kept them at bay during nearly a quarter of\r\nan hour, with so galling a fire that there was soon quite a heap of\r\nslain. Then, at the other corner, there was a house which they had to\r\nsecure possession of before proceeding any farther. At one moment, as\r\nthe smoke blew off, a woman could be espied firing with a gun from\r\none of the windows. It was the house of a baker; some other soldiers\r\nhad been forgotten there, mingled with the occupants; and when the\r\nplace was at last captured by the foe, loud shouts resounded, and a\r\nfrightful scramble whirled to the wall over the way--a rush, amid\r\nwhich the woman\'s skirt and a man\'s jacket and bristling white hair\r\nsuddenly appeared to view. Then came the sound of platoon firing, and\r\nblood spurted to the coping of the wall. The Germans were inflexible;\r\nevery person, not belonging to the belligerent forces, who was captured\r\nwith arms in his hand, was shot down there and then, as having placed\r\nhimself beyond the pale of the law of nations. And their wrath was\r\nrising in presence of the furious resistance offered by the village.\r\nThe frightful losses they had sustained during nearly five hours\'\r\ncombat urged them on to atrocious reprisals. The gutters were running\r\nred with blood, corpses were barring the streets, and some crossways\r\nwere like charnel-houses, whence the rattle of death could be heard\r\nascending to the sky. And they were seen to throw lighted straw into\r\neach house they carried by force. Some of them ran about with torches,\r\nothers smeared the walls with petroleum, and soon entire streets were\r\non fire--Bazeilles blazed.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the central part of the village there only remained\r\nWeiss\'s house, with its closed shutters, that retained the threatening\r\nappearance of a citadel resolved upon no surrender.\r\n\r\n\'Attention! here they come,\' exclaimed the captain.\r\n\r\nA volley from the garret and the first-floor stretched on the ground\r\nthree of the Bavarians who were stealthily advancing close to the\r\nwalls. The others thereupon fell back, placing themselves in ambush\r\nat the corners of the road, and the siege of the house began, such a\r\nshower of bullets pelting the front that one might have thought there\r\nwas a hailstorm. For nearly ten minutes this fusillade went on without\r\ncessation, denting the plaster without doing much damage. One of the\r\ntwo soldiers, whom the captain had taken with him into the garret,\r\nimprudently showed himself, however, at a dormer window, and was\r\ninstantly killed by a bullet, which struck him full in the forehead.\r\n\r\n\'Curse it! that\'s one less!\' growled the captain. \'Be cautious, we are\r\nnot numerous enough to get ourselves killed for the fun of the thing.\'\r\nHe himself had taken a chassepot, and was firing from behind a shutter.\r\n\r\nLaurent, the gardener, particularly excited his admiration. On his\r\nknees, as though he were stalking game, with the barrel of his gun\r\nresting in a narrow loophole, the young fellow only fired when he was\r\nsure of bringing down his man, and he himself predicted the result of\r\neach shot before it took effect. \'That little blue officer over there,\'\r\nsaid he, \'in the heart. That other one, the skinny chap, farther off,\r\nbetween the eyes. That fat fellow with the carroty beard--I can\'t stand\r\nhim--in the stomach.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the man he named invariably fell, struck in the very spot he had\r\nmentioned; and he quietly continued firing, without the least haste,\r\nhaving plenty of work before him, as he said, and requiring, indeed,\r\nmore time than he could command, to pick them all off in that fashion.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! if I could only see,\' Weiss kept on repeating, in a furious\r\nvoice. He had just broken his spectacles, and was in despair at this\r\nuntimely accident. Certainly, he still had his eye-glasses, but with\r\nthe perspiration that was streaming down his face he was unable to\r\nfix them firmly on his nose; and in a feverish state, with his hands\r\ntrembling, he frequently fired quite at random. Increasing passion was\r\nnow sweeping away all that remained of his accustomed calmness.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be in such a hurry; it does no good,\' remarked Laurent. \'There!\r\nsee that one who no longer has his helmet, at the corner by the\r\ngrocer\'s. Aim at him carefully. Why! that\'s first rate; you have broken\r\nhis leg! See how he\'s floundering about in his blood.\'\r\n\r\nWeiss, who was rather pale, looked at the man, and muttered, \'Finish\r\nhim off.\'\r\n\r\n\'Waste a bullet? Not if I know it! Far better bring down another one.\'\r\n\r\nThe attacking party had observed the galling fire directed upon them\r\nfrom the garret windows. Not one of their men could advance without\r\nbeing hit, and accordingly they brought up some fresh troops, who\r\nreceived orders to riddle the roof with bullets. The garret then became\r\naltogether untenable. The slates were transpierced as easily as though\r\nthey had been mere sheets of paper; and, with a buzzing like that of\r\nbees, the projectiles flew into the attic here, there, and everywhere.\r\nAt each moment the defenders were in danger of being killed.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go down,\' said the captain. \'We can still hold out on the first\r\nfloor.\' As he was stepping towards the ladder, however, a bullet struck\r\nhim in the groin and he fell: \'Too late! Curse it!\' he muttered.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the remaining soldier, Weiss and Laurent insisted upon\r\ncarrying him down, although he told them not to waste time in attending\r\non him. His account was settled, he remarked, and he might just as well\r\nkick the bucket up there as down below. However, when they had laid him\r\non a bed, in a room on the first floor, he became desirous of still\r\ndirecting the defence.\r\n\r\n\'Fire into the lot of them--don\'t trouble about anything else. They\r\nare too prudent to risk coming forward as long as your fire doesn\'t\r\nslacken.\'\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the siege of the little house continued as though it\r\nwere to last for ever. A score of times it seemed upon the point of\r\nbeing carried by the tempest of lead that assailed it; but through the\r\nhurricane and the smoke it again and again appeared to view, still\r\nstanding, dented, perforated, and lacerated, but none the less vomiting\r\nbullets from every aperture. Exasperated at losing so many men, at\r\nbeing kept so long at bay by such a paltry shanty, the assailants were\r\nfairly howling with rage, but they continued firing from a distance,\r\nlacking the courage to rush forward and burst open the door and windows\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\'Look out!\' suddenly exclaimed the corporal; \'a shutter is falling.\'\r\n\r\nThe violence of the bullets had, indeed, torn one of the shutters from\r\nits hinges. Weiss, however, darted forward, pushing a wardrobe against\r\nthe window, and Laurent, in ambush behind it, was able to continue\r\nfiring. One of the soldiers, whose jaw had been shattered, was lying\r\nat his feet losing a great quantity of blood. Another, hit by a bullet\r\nin the throat, rolled over to the wall, beside which he lay with a\r\nconvulsive shudder shaking him from head to foot, whilst from his\r\nparted lips escaped an endless rattle. Without counting the captain,\r\nwho--lying on the bedstead with his back resting against the head\r\nof it--was already too weak to speak, but still gave some orders by\r\nsigns--there were at present only eight of them left. And now the three\r\nrooms on the first floor were, like the garret, becoming untenable, for\r\nthe mattresses had been reduced to shreds, and no longer kept out the\r\nprojectiles; at each moment bits of plaster fell from the walls and the\r\nceiling, corners were chipped off the articles of furniture, whilst the\r\nwardrobe was being slit and rent as though with a hatchet. Worst of\r\nall, however, ammunition was failing.\r\n\r\n\'What a pity!\' growled Laurent; \'it\'s been going on so well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a bit!\' replied Weiss, as an idea flashed through his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had just remembered the dead soldier lying in the garret upstairs,\r\nand he went up to search the body and take the cartridges that must be\r\nupon it. He found that a large piece of the roof had now fallen in,\r\nand he could see the blue sky, a bright sunshiny expanse, at sight of\r\nwhich he was very much astonished. To avoid being killed he dragged\r\nhimself over the floor on his knees, and when he had secured the\r\ncartridges, some thirty or thereabouts, he made all haste and bounded\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was dividing these new supplies with the gardener, however,\r\none of the soldiers gave a shriek and fell on his knees. There were now\r\nonly seven, and a moment afterwards there were only six of them left,\r\nfor the corporal was hit in the left eye by a bullet, which blew out\r\nhis brains.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment Weiss was no longer conscious of anything. He and\r\nthe five others continued firing like madmen, consuming the remaining\r\ncartridges without a thought even of the possibility of surrendering.\r\nThe tiled floors of the three little rooms were now littered with\r\nremnants of furniture. Corpses blocked the doorways, and in one corner\r\na wounded man was giving vent to a frightful, continuous moan. Wherever\r\nthey stepped blood stuck to the soles of their shoes; and some of\r\nit, after coursing through the rooms, was even trickling down the\r\nstaircase. Moreover, it was no longer possible to breathe up there; the\r\natmosphere was dense and hot with powder-smoke, a pungent, nauseating\r\ndust plunging them into almost complete obscurity, which was streaked,\r\nhowever, by a ruddy flame each time a shot was fired.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' exclaimed Weiss; \'why, they are bringing cannon!\'\r\n\r\nIt was true. Despairing of reducing the handful of madmen, who thus\r\ndelayed their advance, the Bavarians were now placing a gun in position\r\nat the corner of the Place de l\'Eglise. And the honour thus shown them,\r\nthat artillery pointed at them from over yonder, made the besieged\r\nfuriously mirthful. They jeered contemptuously: Ah! those dirty\r\ncowards with their cannon! Laurent, meanwhile, was still on his knees,\r\ncarefully aiming at the gunners and bringing a man down at each shot he\r\nfired, so that for a time the gun could not be worked; in fact, five or\r\nsix minutes elapsed before the first discharge. And even then, the gun\r\nbeing pointed too high, merely a strip of the roof was carried away.\r\n\r\nBut the end was at hand. In vain did they search the dead; there was\r\nnot a cartridge left! Haggard and exhausted, the six men fumbled here\r\nand there, seeking for something which they might fling from the\r\nwindows to crush the enemy. One of them, on showing himself at a\r\nwindow, vociferating and brandishing his fists, was riddled by a volley\r\nof lead, and then only five of them were left. What could they do? Go\r\ndown--try to escape by way of the garden and the meadows? But at that\r\nmoment there was a loud uproar below, and men streamed furiously up the\r\nstairs. The Bavarians had at last crept round the house, broken open\r\nthe back door, and invaded the ground floor. A terrible _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_ ensued\r\nin the little rooms, among the corpses and the shattered furniture.\r\nThe chest of one of the French soldiers was transpierced by a bayonet\r\nthrust, and the two others were taken prisoners, whilst the captain,\r\nwho had just vented his last gasp, lay there with his mouth open and\r\nhis arm still raised, as though to give an order.\r\n\r\nHowever, a German officer, a stout, fair man, armed with a revolver,\r\nand whose bloodshot eyes seemed to be starting from his head, had\r\ncaught sight of Weiss and Laurent, the one in his black coat and the\r\nother in his blue linen jacket, and savagely asked them in French: \'Who\r\nare you? What the ---- are you doing here?\'\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that they were black with powder, he realised the truth,\r\nand stammering with fury, heaped insults upon them in German. He had\r\nalready raised his weapon to blow their brains out, when the soldiers\r\nhe commanded rushed forward, caught hold of the two civilians and\r\npushed them before them down the stairs. The two men were carried\r\nalong by the human wave which flung them upon the road, where they\r\nrolled over as far as the opposite wall, amid such vociferous shouts\r\nthat the voices of the officers could be no longer heard. Then, during\r\ntwo or three minutes which elapsed whilst the stout fair officer\r\nwas endeavouring to clear a space, in view of proceeding with their\r\nexecution, they were able to pick themselves up and look about them.\r\n\r\nOther houses were now blazing--all Bazeilles was becoming a furnace.\r\nFlames were beginning to stream through the lofty windows of the\r\nchurch. Some soldiers were driving an old lady out of her house after\r\ncompelling her to give them some matches that they might set her bed\r\nand her curtains on fire. What with all the lighted wisps of straw\r\nflung here and there, and all the petroleum poured upon the walls, the\r\nconflagrations were spreading from street to street. It was warfare as\r\nwaged by savages--savages infuriated by the duration of the struggle,\r\nand avenging their dead, their heaps of dead over whom they had to\r\nmarch. Bands of men were yelling amid the smoke and the sparks, amid\r\nall the fearful uproar compounded of dying groans and shrieks, falling\r\nwalls, and discharges of musketry. They could scarcely see one another;\r\nlarge clouds of livid dust, impregnated with an insufferable stench\r\nof fat and blood, as though laden indeed with all the abominations of\r\nthe massacre, flew up, obscuring the sun. And they were still killing,\r\nstill destroying in every corner; the human beast was let loose, all\r\nthe idiotic anger, all the furious madness of man preying upon man.\r\n\r\nAnd, at last, in front of him, Weiss could see his own house burning.\r\nSoldiers had hurried up with torches, and others were feeding the\r\nflames with the remnants of the furniture. The ground floor speedily\r\nblazed, and the smoke poured forth from all the gaping wounds of the\r\nroof and the front. The adjacent dyeworks, too, were already catching\r\nfire; and--oh, the pity of it!--little Auguste, lying in bed, delirious\r\nwith fever, could still be heard calling for his mother, whose skirts\r\nwere beginning to burn as her corpse, with its head pounded to pieces,\r\nlay there across the threshold.\r\n\r\n\'Mother, I\'m so thirsty; mother, give me some water.\'\r\n\r\nBut the flames roared, the plaint ceased, and then nothing could be\r\ndistinguished save the deafening hurrahs of the conquerors!\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, above every noise, above all the shouting, there\r\narose a terrible cry. It was Henriette arriving--Henriette, who had\r\njust espied her husband standing with his back to a wall, in front of a\r\nplatoon which was loading its weapons.\r\n\r\nShe sprang upon his neck: \'My God! what is it? They are not going to\r\nkill you!\'\r\n\r\nWeiss gazed at her in stupefaction. \'Twas she, his wife whom he had so\r\nlong desired, whom he had adored with such idolising tenderness. And\r\nwith a shudder he awoke, distracted, to the awful reality. Why had he\r\ntarried there firing upon the foe instead of returning to her, as he\r\nhad sworn to do? His lost happiness flashed before his dizzy eyes; they\r\nwere to be torn asunder, parted for evermore. Then he was struck by\r\nthe sight of the blood upon her forehead, and in a mechanical voice he\r\nstammered, \'Are you wounded? It was madness for you to come----\'\r\n\r\nWith a wild gesture, however, she interrupted him. \'Oh! me; it\'s\r\nnothing, a mere scratch--but you, why are they keeping you? I won\'t\r\nhave them shoot you!\'\r\n\r\nThe officer who was struggling in the middle of the obstructed road,\r\ntrying to clear a space so that the platoon might fall back a few\r\npaces, turned round on hearing the sound of voices; and when he\r\nperceived the woman hanging on the neck of one of the prisoners, he\r\nagain savagely shouted in French: \'No, no--no humbug, please! Where\r\nhave you come from? What do you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'I want my husband.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your husband, that man there? He has been condemned; justice must be\r\ndone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want my husband.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, be reasonable--move aside, we don\'t wish to do you any harm.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want my husband.\'\r\n\r\nRenouncing his attempts at persuasion, the officer was about to give\r\norders that she should be torn from the prisoner\'s arms, when Laurent,\r\nhitherto silent and impassive, ventured to intervene: \'I say, captain,\r\nit was I who knocked so many of your men over, and it\'s right enough\r\nthat you should shoot me. Besides, I\'ve nobody to think of, neither\r\nmother, nor wife, nor child--but this gentleman\'s married--why not let\r\nhim go, and settle my affair?\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that tomfoolery!\' yelled the captain, quite beside himself;\r\n\'are you making fun of me? Here! a man here to take this woman away.\'\r\n\r\nHe had to repeat the order in German, whereupon a soldier stepped\r\nforward, a short, broad-chested Bavarian, whose enormous head was bushy\r\nwith carroty beard and hair, amidst which one could only distinguish\r\na broad square-shaped nose, and a pair of big blue eyes. He was a\r\nfrightful object, stained all over with blood, looking like some bear\r\nfrom a mountain cavern--one of those hairy monsters, red with the blood\r\nof the prey whose bones they have just been crunching.\r\n\r\n\'I want my husband; kill me with my husband!\' repeated Henriette, in a\r\nheartrending cry.\r\n\r\nBut, dealing himself heavy blows on the chest with his clenched fist,\r\nthe officer declared that he was not a murderer, and that if there were\r\nsome who slaughtered the innocent, he at all events was not one of\r\nthem. She had not been condemned, and he would cut off his hand rather\r\nthan touch a hair of her head.\r\n\r\nThen, as the soldier was approaching her, Henriette distractedly coiled\r\nher limbs round Weiss: \'Oh! I beseech you, dear, keep me, let me die\r\nwith you.\'\r\n\r\nWeiss was shedding big tears, and without answering was trying to\r\nunloosen the unhappy woman\'s convulsive grasp upon his shoulder and his\r\nloins.\r\n\r\n\'Do you no longer care for me,\' she pleaded, \'that you wish to die\r\nwithout me? Keep me here; it will tire them out, and they will shoot us\r\nboth.\'\r\n\r\nHe had now succeeded in detaching one of her little hands, and was\r\npressing it to his mouth, covering it with kisses, whilst still\r\nstriving to loosen the grasp of the other one.\r\n\r\n\'No, no! Keep me,\' she cried, \'I want to die.\'\r\n\r\nAt last, however, after infinite trouble, he held both her hands in his\r\nown. And, hitherto silent, having purposely refrained from answering\r\nher, he now said but three words: \'Farewell, dear wife!\'\r\n\r\nHe himself had thrown her into the arms of the Bavarian who carried her\r\naway. She struggled and shrieked, whilst the soldier, doubtless for\r\nthe purpose of calming her, gave vent to a stream of gruff words. With\r\na violent effort she had managed to disengage her head, and she saw\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nIn less than three seconds it was over. Weiss, whose glasses had\r\nslipped down while he was parting from his wife, had hastily set them\r\non his nose again, as though he wished to look death full in the face.\r\nHe stepped back and leant against the wall, with his arms crossed;\r\nand this stout peaceable fellow, in his coat torn to shreds, had a\r\nwildly excited face, aglow with all the beauty of courage. Near him\r\nwas Laurent, who had contented himself with shoving his hands into his\r\npockets. The cruel scene, the abominableness of those savages who shot\r\nmen down before the very eyes of their wives, seemed to fill him with\r\nindignation. He drew himself up, scanned the firing party, and in a\r\ncontemptuous tone spat forth the words: \'You filthy pigs!\'\r\n\r\nBut the officer had raised his sword, and the two men fell like logs,\r\nthe gardener with his face on the ground, the book-keeper on his flank,\r\nalongside the wall. The latter, before expiring, experienced a final\r\nconvulsion, his eyelids blinked, his mouth writhed. Then the officer\r\nstepped up to him, and stirred him with his foot, desirous of making\r\nsure that he was quite dead.\r\n\r\nHenriette had seen everything: those dying eyes seeking for her, that\r\nfrightful quiver of the death-pangs, that big boot pushing the corpse\r\naside. She did not cry out, but she silently, furiously bit at what was\r\nnear her mouth; and it was a hand that her teeth caught hold of. The\r\nBavarian roared, the pain was so atrocious. He threw her down, almost\r\nfelling her. Their faces met, and never was she able to forget that red\r\nhair and beard splashed with blood, and those blue eyes dilated and\r\nswimming with fury.\r\n\r\nLater on, Henriette could not clearly remember what had happened after\r\nher husband\'s death. She, herself, had had but one desire, to return\r\nto his corpse, take it, and watch over it. However, as happens in\r\nnightmares, all sorts of obstacles rose up before her, staying her\r\ncourse at every step. Again had a brisk fusillade broken out, and there\r\nwas a great stir among the German troops who occupied Bazeilles. The\r\nFrench Marine Infantry was, at last, again reaching the village, and\r\nthe engagement began afresh with so much violence that the young woman\r\nwas thrown into a lane on the left, among a crazed, terrified flock of\r\nvillagers. There could be no doubt, however, as to the issue of the\r\nstruggle; it was too late to reconquer the abandoned positions. During\r\nanother half-hour the men of the Marine Infantry fought with the utmost\r\ndesperation, sacrificing their lives in a superb, furious transport;\r\nbut at each moment the foe received reinforcements which streamed forth\r\nfrom all sides, the meadows, the roads, and the park of Montivilliers.\r\nNothing could now have dislodged them from that village, which they had\r\nsecured at such fearful cost, where several thousands of their men were\r\nlying dead amid blood and flames. Destruction was now completing its\r\nwork, the place had become but a charnel-house of scattered limbs and\r\nsmoking ruins. Slaughtered, annihilated, Bazeilles was dwindling into\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nFor a last time did Henriette espy in the distance her little house,\r\nthe floors of which were falling into a vortex of fiery flakes. And\r\never, alongside the wall facing the house, could she see her husband\'s\r\ncorpse. But another human stream caught her in its flow, the bugles\r\nsounded the retreat, and she was carried away, how she knew not, among\r\nthe troops as they gradually fell back. And then she became as it were\r\na thing, a mere rolling waif borne onward amid the confused tramping of\r\na multitude that was streaming along the highway. And she was conscious\r\nof nothing further, till at last she found herself at Balan, in the\r\nhouse of some strangers, where she sat sobbing in a kitchen, with her\r\nhead resting upon a table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR THE CALVARY--THE GREAT CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt ten o\'clock the men of Captain Beaudoin\'s company were still lying\r\nin the cabbage field on the plateau of Algeria, whence they had not\r\nstirred since early morning. The cross fire from the batteries on the\r\nHattoy hill and the peninsula of Iges was increasing in violence, and\r\nhad again just killed a couple of soldiers; but still no orders came\r\nto advance. Were they going to remain there all day then, allowing\r\nthemselves to be pounded like that, without making any attempt at\r\nfighting?\r\n\r\nThe men were no longer even able to relieve their feelings by firing\r\ntheir chassepots, for Captain Beaudoin had succeeded in putting a stop\r\nto that furious and useless fusillade, directed upon the little wood\r\nover yonder, where not a single Prussian seemed to have remained. The\r\nsun was now becoming most oppressive; the men fairly roasted as they\r\nlay there under the flaming sky.\r\n\r\nJean, on turning round, felt anxious on seeing that Maurice\'s head had\r\nsunk to the ground. The young fellow\'s eyes were closed, and his cheek\r\nwas close pressed to the soil; he looked, too, extremely pale and did\r\nnot stir. \'Hallo, what\'s up?\' asked Jean.\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, had simply fallen asleep. He had been overcome by\r\nwaiting and weariness, although death was on the wing all around.\r\nWhen he suddenly awoke again there was a calm look in his widely\r\nopened eyes, but the scared, wavering expression of the battlefield\r\nimmediately returned to them. He had no notion how long his slumber had\r\nlasted; it seemed to him as though he were emerging from delightful,\r\ninfinite nihility.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! that\'s funny,\' he muttered, \'I\'ve been asleep--it has done me\r\ngood.\'\r\n\r\nIndeed, he now felt less of that painful oppression, the bone-splitting\r\nclasp of fright upon his temples and his ribs; and he began to poke\r\nfun at Lapoulle, who had not merely been expressing anxiety about\r\nChouteau and Loubet, ever since their disappearance, but had even\r\ntalked of going to look for them. That was a fine idea; all he wanted,\r\nno doubt, was to shelter himself behind a tree and smoke a pipe there!\r\nPache opined that the two men had been detained at the ambulance, where\r\nthere was probably a lack of bearers. Ah! that business of picking up\r\nthe wounded under the enemy\'s fire was by no means a pleasant one. Full\r\nof the superstitious notions of his native village, Pache added that it\r\nwas very unlucky to touch a corpse--whoever did so would soon die.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder! will you just shut up?\' cried Lieutenant Rochas, who had\r\noverheard this remark. \'Does anybody die?\'\r\n\r\nColonel de Vineuil, erect on his big charger a few paces away, turned\r\nhis head at this, and smiled for the first time that morning, Then he\r\nagain subsided into his motionless attitude, still impassively waiting\r\nfor orders, whilst the shells continued raining around him.\r\n\r\nMaurice, who had now become interested in the bearers, watched them\r\nas they searched about in the various folds of the ground. A field\r\nambulance was being installed behind a bank, at the edge of the\r\nhollow road near by, and the bearers attached to it were beginning to\r\nexplore the plateau. A tent was promptly pitched whilst the necessary\r\n_mat\xc3\xa9riel_ was removed from a van waiting on the road. Instruments,\r\napparatus, and linen were produced--the few things, in fact, that were\r\nrequisite for summary dressings pending the despatch of the wounded to\r\nSedan, whither they were sent as rapidly as could be managed. Vehicles,\r\nhowever, were already becoming scarce. There were only some assistant\r\nsurgeons in charge of the ambulance, and it was more particularly the\r\nbearers who gave proof of a stubborn, inglorious courage. Clad in grey,\r\nwith the red cross of Geneva on their caps and their arm-badges, they\r\ncould be seen venturing slowly and quietly under the projectiles, as\r\nfar as the spots where the soldiers had fallen. They often crawled\r\nalong on hands and knees, and endeavoured to take advantage of the\r\nvarious ditches and hedges, of all the protection that the ground\r\nafforded, never evincing any braggardism in unnecessarily exposing\r\nthemselves to peril. As soon as they found any men on the ground their\r\nlaborious task began, for many of those who were lying there had simply\r\nfainted, and it was necessary to distinguish the wounded from the\r\ndead. Some men had remained face downwards, and were stifling with\r\ntheir mouths in pools of blood; others had their throats full of earth,\r\nas though they had bitten the ground; others, again, were lying in a\r\nheap, pell-mell, with their arms and legs contracted and their chests\r\nhalf crushed. The bearers carefully extricated and picked up those who\r\nwere still breathing, stretching their limbs and raising their heads,\r\nwhich they cleaned as well as they could manage. Each bearer carried a\r\ncan of water, in the use of which he was extremely sparing. And one or\r\nanother of them would often be seen kneeling on the same spot for many\r\nminutes together, trying to revive some wounded man and waiting for him\r\nto open his eyes.\r\n\r\nAt fifty yards or so, on his left hand, Maurice noticed one bearer\r\nlooking for the wound of a little soldier, from one of whose sleeves\r\na streamlet of blood trickled continuously. This was a case of\r\nh\xc3\xa6morrhage, and the man with the red cross having at last found the\r\nwound managed to stop the flow of blood by compressing the artery. In\r\nthis manner the bearers attended to all urgent cases. Whenever there\r\nwas a fracture they were not only particularly careful how they moved\r\nthe man, but they fixed and bandaged his damaged limb, so that his\r\ncondition might not be aggravated by transport. The conveyance of the\r\nwounded to the ambulance was indeed the great affair; the bearers\r\nsupported those who could still walk, and carried others either in\r\ntheir arms like babies or in pick-a-back fashion. At times also,\r\naccording to the difficulties of the case, two, three, or four of them\r\nassembled and formed a seat with their joined hands, or carried the\r\nsufferer away in a horizontal position, by his legs and shoulders. To\r\nsupplement the regulation stretchers, recourse was had to all sorts of\r\ningenious devices; at times a stretcher would be formed by linking a\r\ncouple of chassepots together with knapsack-straps. And all over the\r\nbare plateau which the shells were ploughing the bearers could be seen,\r\nnow single, now in small parties, gliding along with their burdens,\r\nbending their heads, testing the ground with their feet, and displaying\r\nprudent but admirable heroism.\r\n\r\nWhilst Maurice was watching one of them on his right hand, a thin, puny\r\nfellow, who, like some toilsome ant burdened with too large a grain of\r\nwheat, was staggering along with bended legs, carrying a heavy sergeant\r\nwhose arms were entwined around his neck, he suddenly saw both men\r\ntopple over and disappear amid the explosion of a shell. When the smoke\r\nhad cleared off the sergeant again appeared to view, lying on his back\r\nand without any fresh wound, whereas the bearer was stretched beside\r\nhim with his flank ripped open. And thereupon another bearer came up,\r\nanother busy ant, who after turning his comrade over and finding him\r\ndead, again picked up the wounded sergeant and carried him away.\r\n\r\nMaurice thereupon remarked to Lapoulle: \'Well, if you like their job\r\nbetter than ours, just go and lend them a hand.\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment or so the batteries of St. Menges had been firing their\r\nutmost, and the hailstorm of projectiles was becoming more violent.\r\nCaptain Beaudoin, who was still nervously walking up and down in front\r\nof his company, at last ventured to approach the colonel. It was\r\npitiful, said he, that the spirits of the men should be worn out like\r\nthat, by long hours of idle waiting.\r\n\r\n\'I have no orders,\' stoically repeated the colonel.\r\n\r\nJust then General Douay was again seen galloping past, followed by his\r\nstaff. A few minutes previously he had met General de Wimpffen, who had\r\nhastened to this part of the field to beg him to hold out; and this he\r\nhad thought he might promise to do, on the express condition, however,\r\nthat the Calvary of Illy, on his right, should be defended. If the\r\nposition of Illy were lost, he should be unable to answer for anything;\r\nfor a retreat would then become unavoidable. General de Wimpffen\r\ndeclared that some troops of the First Corps were about to occupy the\r\nCalvary, and, in fact, almost immediately afterwards a regiment of\r\nZouaves was seen to establish itself there; whereupon General Douay,\r\nfeeling more at his ease, consented to send Dumont\'s division to the\r\nsupport of the Twelfth Corps, which was being hard pressed. A quarter\r\nof an hour afterwards, however, he was returning from an inspection of\r\nhis left wing, which still presented a firm front, when, on raising his\r\neyes, he gave vent to a cry of dismay, for the Calvary was bare: not\r\na Zouave remained there. Under the terrific fire from the Fleigneux\r\nbatteries the position was not tenable, and had consequently been\r\nabandoned. In despair, foreseeing the disaster that must overwhelm the\r\narmy, General Douay was galloping off to rejoin his right wing, when he\r\nencountered Dumont\'s division falling back in disorder, panic-stricken,\r\nand mingled with some remnants of the First Corps. The latter, after\r\nits early retreat, had failed to reconquer the positions it had\r\nheld at dawn, and, leaving Daigny in possession of the Saxons, and\r\nGivonne in that of the Prussian Guard, it had been obliged to proceed\r\nnorthwards through the wood of La Garenne, cannonaded by the batteries\r\nwhich the enemy planted upon every crest from one to the other end\r\nof the valley. The terrible circle of flame and iron was closing\r\nup. Whilst a portion of the Prussian Guard turned the heights and\r\nproceeded on its westward march towards Illy, the Fifth German Corps,\r\nscreened by the Eleventh, which was in possession of St. Menges, still\r\ncontinued on its easterly course, already leaving Fleigneux behind it,\r\nand incessantly throwing its artillery forward with the most impudent\r\ntemerity; its commanders being so convinced, indeed, of the ignorance\r\nand powerlessness of the French generals that they did not even wait\r\nfor infantry to support their gunners. It was now midday, and the\r\nwhole horizon was glowing and thundering, raining cross fires upon the\r\nSeventh and First French Corps.\r\n\r\nAnd now, whilst the foe\'s artillery was in this wise preparing for the\r\nsupreme attack on the Calvary, General Douay determined upon a last\r\ndesperate effort to reconquer it. He despatched orders, threw himself\r\nin person among the fugitives of Dumont\'s division, and succeeded in\r\nforming a column which he hurled upon the plateau. It held out there\r\nfor a few minutes, but the bullets rained so thickly, and such an\r\navalanche of shells swept the bare, treeless fields, that a panic\r\nspeedily broke out, and carried the men down the slopes again, whirling\r\nthem away like bits of straw caught in a storm. The general was\r\nobstinate, however, and ordered up other regiments.\r\n\r\nAn estafette, galloping past, shouted some order to Colonel de Vineuil\r\namid the fearful uproar. The colonel was already erect in his stirrups\r\nwith his face aglow; and brandishing his sword and pointing to the\r\nCalvary, he cried: \'It\'s our turn at last, my boys! Forward, up yonder!\'\r\n\r\nInspirited by the colonel\'s manner, the 106th set out. Beaudoin\'s men\r\nhad been among the first to spring to their feet, jesting together, and\r\nremarking that they felt quite rusty, and had every joint clogged with\r\nearth. They had taken but a few steps, however, when so violent became\r\nthe enemy\'s fire that they had to dive into a shelter-trench which they\r\nluckily came upon. They filed along it, bending double.\r\n\r\n\'Take care, youngster,\' said Jean to Maurice; \'here\'s the rub. Don\'t\r\nshow the tip of your nose even; if you do, it will surely be carried\r\naway. And get your bones well together if you don\'t want to drop any of\r\nthem on the road. Those who come back from this affair will be lucky\r\nones.\'\r\n\r\nAmid the buzzing, mob-like clamour that filled his head, Maurice could\r\nscarcely hear the corporal. He no longer knew whether he was afraid\r\nor not; he ran along, carried onward by the gallop of his comrades\r\nand destitute of any personal will, having but one desire, that of\r\nfinishing the business at once. And so completely had he become a mere\r\nwave of this marching torrent, that he felt panic seize hold of him\r\nand was ready to take to flight as soon as a sudden recoil set in at\r\nthe farther end of the trench, at view of the bare ground remaining to\r\nbe climbed. The instinct of self-preservation broke loose within him;\r\nswayed by the impulses around him his muscles rebelled against his duty.\r\n\r\nSome men were already turning back, when the colonel threw himself\r\nin their way. \'Come, my boys,\' said he, \'you don\'t mean to grieve me\r\nlike that; you are surely not going to behave like cowards! Remember,\r\nthat the 106th has never recoiled; you would be the first to stain our\r\ncolours!\'\r\n\r\nUrging on his horse he barred the way, expostulating in turn with each\r\nof the fugitives, and speaking of France in a voice that was tremulous\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Rochas was so affected by the scene that he flew into a\r\nviolent passion, and, raising his sword, began beating the men with it,\r\nas though it were a stick. \'You dirty curs!\' he shouted, \'I\'ll kick you\r\nall the way up--that I will! Mind you obey orders, or I\'ll smash the\r\njaw of the first man who turns tail.\'\r\n\r\nThis violence, however, this idea of kicking soldiers into fighting,\r\nwas not to the colonel\'s taste. \'No, no, lieutenant,\' he said; \'they\'ll\r\nall follow me. Isn\'t that so, my boys? You won\'t let your old colonel\r\nface the Prussians all alone? Forward then, up yonder!\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he set out, and they one and all followed him, feeling that\r\nhe had talked to them like a father whom they could not abandon without\r\nshowing themselves to be arrant cowards. And he quietly rode across the\r\nbare fields on his big charger, whilst his men scattered and spread\r\nthemselves out like skirmishers, taking advantage of the slightest\r\ncover. The ground rose, and more than five hundred yards of stubble and\r\nbeetroot fields had to be crossed before reaching the Calvary. Instead\r\nof the correct lines of the classical assault, such as is witnessed in\r\nsham-fighting, all that could be seen in a minute or two was the backs\r\nof the men as they bent double and glided along close to the ground,\r\nnow singly, and now in little groups, now crawling on their knees, and\r\nnow suddenly springing forward like insects, making their way to the\r\nsummit, by dint of agility and cunning. The hostile batteries must have\r\nperceived them, for the soil was ploughed up by the shells which fell\r\nso frequently that there was no pause in the detonations. On the way\r\nfive of the men were killed, and a lieutenant was cut clean in half.\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean were lucky enough to come upon a hedge, behind which\r\nthey were able to run on without being seen. A bullet, however, here\r\npenetrated the temple of one of their comrades, who, in falling, almost\r\ntripped them up. They had to push him aside with their feet. They no\r\nlonger paid any attention to the dead; there were too many of them.\r\nThe horrors of the battlefield--a wounded man whom they perceived\r\nhowling and holding in his entrails with both hands, a horse, which was\r\nstill dragging itself along although its haunches were broken--all the\r\nfrightful agonies displayed to view had ended by no longer affecting\r\nthem. Their only sufferings were occasioned by the oppressive heat of\r\nthe midday sun which was biting into their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'How thirsty I am!\' stammered Maurice; \'it seems as if my throat were\r\nfull of soot. Can\'t you smell that horrible stench of burning wool?\'\r\n\r\nJean nodded: \'It was the same at Solferino. Perhaps it\'s the smell\r\nof war. Wait a bit; I\'ve still some brandy left, we\'ll drink a drop\r\ntogether.\'\r\n\r\nThey quietly halted for a minute behind the hedge, but the brandy\r\nburnt their stomachs, instead of quenching their thirst. That burning\r\ntaste in their mouths was quite exasperating. And, besides, they felt\r\nfamished, and would willingly have devoured the half-loaf which Maurice\r\nstill had in his knapsack. But was there any possibility of getting\r\nat it? Other men were each moment coming up behind them, and pushing\r\nthem onward. At last, they too bounded over the last slope and found\r\nthemselves upon the plateau, at the very foot of the Calvary, the old\r\nstone cross reared between two meagre lime-trees, and eaten away here\r\nand there by the wind and the rain.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, dash it! here we are at last!\' Jean exclaimed; \'but the thing is\r\nto stop here.\'\r\n\r\nHe was right. As Lapoulle, in a plaintive voice, remarked to the\r\namusement of his comrades, the spot was hardly a pleasant one. And\r\nnow, once again, they all stretched themselves among some stubble.\r\nNevertheless three more men were speedily killed. A perfect hurricane\r\nwas raging up there; the projectiles came from St. Menges, Fleigneux,\r\nand Givonne, in such numbers that vapour seemed to issue from the soil,\r\nas happens during a heavy storm of rain. Evidently enough, the position\r\ncould not be long retained unless artillery promptly arrived to support\r\nthe men who had been so daringly sent to the front. General Douay,\r\nit was said, had given orders to run up a couple of batteries of the\r\nreserve artillery; and the men looked round anxiously every moment,\r\nwaiting for these guns which did not arrive.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s ridiculous, ridiculous!\' repeated Captain Beaudoin, who had again\r\nresumed his jerky promenade. \'A regiment ought not to be sent to an\r\nexposed position like this without being at once supported.\' Then,\r\nnoticing a dip in the ground on his left, he called out to Rochas: \'I\r\nsay, lieutenant, the company might lie down there.\'\r\n\r\nRochas, erect and motionless, shrugged his shoulders: \'Oh! captain,\r\nhere or there, it\'s all the same. The best is not to stir.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Beaudoin, who as a rule never swore, flew into a passion.\r\n\'But, d---- it, we shall all leave our carcases here,\' said he; \'we\r\ncan\'t allow ourselves to be destroyed in this fashion.\'\r\n\r\nAnd, getting obstinate, he determined to inspect the position which he\r\nhad pointed out as a preferable one. He had not taken a dozen steps,\r\nhowever, when he disappeared in a sudden explosion. His right leg was\r\nsmashed by a splinter of a shell, and he fell upon his back, raising a\r\nshrill cry, like a woman surprised.\r\n\r\n\'It was a dead certainty,\' muttered Rochas; \'so much moving about does\r\nno good. Besides, there\'s no escape from fate.\'\r\n\r\nSome of the men raised themselves up on seeing their captain fall; and\r\nas he called for help, begging that they would carry him away, Jean at\r\nlast ran to him, immediately followed by Maurice.\r\n\r\n\'In heaven\'s name, my friends, don\'t abandon me; carry me to the\r\nambulance.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, sir, it won\'t be an easy job. However, we\'ll try.\'\r\n\r\nThey were already concerting as to how they should lift him, when,\r\nsheltered behind the hedge which they had previously skirted, they\r\nnoticed a couple of bearers who appeared to be waiting for employment.\r\nJean and Maurice signed to them energetically and prevailed upon them\r\nto approach. If these men could only carry the captain to the ambulance\r\nwithout mishap, he might be saved. The road was a long one, however,\r\nand the storm of iron hail was increasing in violence.\r\n\r\nAs the bearers, after tightly bandaging the wounded limb, were carrying\r\nthe captain away on their joined hands, one of his arms being passed\r\nround each of their necks, Colonel de Vineuil, who had been informed\r\nof the casualty, rode up, urging on his horse. He had a liking for the\r\nyoung officer, whom he had known ever since he had left St. Cyr, and he\r\nshowed himself much affected. \'Keep up your courage, my poor fellow,\'\r\nsaid he; \'it won\'t be anything serious. They\'ll save you.\'\r\n\r\nThe captain made a gesture of relief, as though a great deal of courage\r\nhad at last come to him. \'No, no,\' he answered; \'it\'s all over, and I\r\nprefer it should be so. The exasperating thing is having to wait for\r\nwhat we cannot avoid.\'\r\n\r\nHe was carried away, and the bearers were lucky enough to reach the\r\nhedge without any mishap. They swiftly skirted it with their burden,\r\nand when the colonel saw them disappear behind the clump of trees,\r\nwhere the ambulance was established, he gave a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\'But you yourself are wounded, sir,\' Maurice suddenly exclaimed. He had\r\njust noticed that the colonel\'s left boot was covered with blood. The\r\nheel had been carried away, and a piece of leather had penetrated into\r\nthe flesh of the leg.\r\n\r\nM. de Vineuil quietly leant over his saddle and looked for a moment at\r\nhis foot, which must have felt both burning hot and terribly heavy.\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' he muttered, \'I caught that just now. But it\'s nothing, it\r\ndoesn\'t prevent me from keeping in the saddle.\' And as he rode off to\r\ntake his place again at the head of his regiment, he added: \'A man can\r\nalways get on when he\'s in the saddle and can stay there.\'\r\n\r\nThe two batteries of the reserve artillery were now at last coming\r\nup, to the intense relief of the anxious soldiers, to whom it seemed\r\nas though these guns were bringing salvation, a rampart and thunder\r\nthat would speedily silence the cannon of the foe over yonder. It\r\nwas, moreover, a superb sight, so correctly were the batteries run\r\nup in order of battle, each gun followed by its caisson, the drivers\r\nastride the near-horses, and holding the off-horses by the bridle; the\r\ngunners seated on the boxes; and the corporals and sergeants galloping\r\nalongside in their respective places. It might have been thought they\r\nwere parading, anxious to preserve the regulation distances as they\r\ndashed at full speed over the stubble, with a dull rumbling like that\r\nof a storm.\r\n\r\nMaurice, who was again lying in a furrow, raised himself up,\r\nenraptured, and said to Jean: \'There, that is Honor\xc3\xa9\'s battery on the\r\nleft. I recognise the men.\'\r\n\r\nWith a back-hander, Jean threw him to the ground again. \'Lie flat, and\r\nkeep still,\' he said.\r\n\r\nWith their cheeks resting on the soil, however, they both continued\r\nwatching the battery, feeling greatly interested in the man\xc5\x93uvres that\r\nwere being executed, and with their hearts beating quickly at sight\r\nof the calm, active bravery of the artillerymen from whom they yet\r\nexpected victory.\r\n\r\nThe battery had suddenly halted on a bare summit, on their left hand,\r\nand in a moment everything was ready; the gunners sprang from the\r\nboxes and unhooked the limbers, and the drivers, leaving the pieces\r\nin position, wheeled their horses and withdrew to a distance of some\r\nfifteen yards, where they remained motionless, facing the enemy. The\r\nsix guns were already levelled, set wide apart, in three sections,\r\ncommanded by lieutenants, and united under the orders of a captain\r\nwhose slim, extremely tall figure rose up, unluckily for him, like some\r\nconspicuous landmark. And when he had rapidly made a calculation, he\r\nwas heard to exclaim: \'Sight at 1,700 yards.\'\r\n\r\nThe mark was to be a Prussian battery established behind some bushes\r\non the left of Fleigneux, and whose terrible fire was rendering the\r\nplateau of Illy untenable.\r\n\r\n\'Do you see,\' again began Maurice, who was quite unable to hold his\r\ntongue, \'Honor\xc3\xa9\'s gun is in the central section. There he is, leaning\r\nforward with the gun-layer--little Louis--we drank a glass together at\r\nVouziers, as you may remember. And that driver over there who sits so\r\nstiffly on his horse, a beautiful chestnut, is Louis\' chum, Adolphe.\'\r\n\r\nThe whole stream of men, horses and _mat\xc3\xa9riel_, was disposed in a\r\nstraight line about a hundred yards in depth. First was the gun with\r\nits six gunners and its quartermaster,[29] farther off the limber and\r\nits four horses and its pair of drivers; then the caisson with its six\r\nhorses and its three drivers; further still the ammunition and forage\r\nwaggons and the field smithy; whilst the spare caissons and spare men\r\nand horses, provided to fill up any gaps in the battery, waited at some\r\ndistance on the right, so that they might not be unnecessarily exposed\r\nin the enfilade of the firing.\r\n\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9 was now attending to the loading of his gun. Two of his men\r\nwere already bringing the charge and the projectile from the caisson,\r\nover which the corporal and the artificer were watching; and two other\r\ngunners, after inserting the serge-covered charge by the muzzle,\r\nat once rammed it carefully into position and then slipped in the\r\nshell, the points of which grated as they slid along the grooves.\r\nThen the assistant gun-layer, after pricking the cartridge with the\r\npriming-wire, swiftly applied the match to the touch-hole. Honor\xc3\xa9 was\r\ndesirous of aiming this first shot himself, and half-lying on the\r\nblock-trail, he worked the regulating screw to obtain the correct\r\nrange, indicating the proper direction by a gentle, continuous wave\r\nof the hand, whilst the gun-layer, holding the lever behind him,\r\nimperceptibly moved the piece more to the right or more to the left.\r\n\r\n\'That must be right,\' said Honor\xc3\xa9, rising up.\r\n\r\nThe captain, with his lofty figure bent double, inspected the sighting.\r\nAt each piece the assistant gun-layer was in position, holding the\r\nlanyard in readiness to pull the saw-like blade that ignited the\r\nfulminate. And the command was then given slowly, and in due order:\r\n\'Number one, fire! Number two, fire!\'\r\n\r\nThe six shells were hurled into space, the guns recoiled and were\r\nbrought back into position, whilst the quartermasters noted that their\r\nfire had not nearly reached the required distance. They rectified\r\nit; the practice began afresh in the same orderly fashion as before;\r\nand it was this precise routine, this mechanical labour that needed\r\nto be calmly and deliberately accomplished, that sustained the men\'s\r\nfirmness. That beloved creature, the gun, grouped a little family\r\naround her, whose members were closely united by the bonds of a common\r\noccupation. The gun was indeed the connecting link, the one object\r\nof concern; it was for her that they all existed, the caisson, the\r\nwaggons, the horses, even the men themselves. And from all this sprang\r\nthe great cohesion of the battery, a steadfastness and tranquillity\r\nsuch as prevail in happy families.\r\n\r\nSome acclamations from the men of the 106th had greeted the first\r\ndischarge. At last, then, they were going to stop the jabbering of\r\nthose Prussian cannon. But a feeling of disappointment immediately\r\nfollowed when it was seen that the shells did not travel the distance,\r\nmost of them bursting in the air before reaching the bushes among which\r\nthe enemy\'s artillery was hidden.\r\n\r\n\'Honor\xc3\xa9,\' resumed Maurice, \'says that the other guns are mere nails by\r\nthe side of his. In his estimation his one will never be matched! See\r\nhow lovingly he looks at it, and how carefully he has it sponged so\r\nthat the dear thing may not feel too warm.\'\r\n\r\nIn this way he jested with Jean, both of them quite inspirited by the\r\nsmart, calm bravery of the artillerymen. In three shots, however, the\r\nPrussian batteries had regulated their fire; their range had at first\r\nbeen too long, but their practice now became so wonderfully accurate\r\nthat their shells fell upon the French guns, which, despite every\r\neffort to increase their range, still failed to carry the distance. One\r\nof Honor\xc3\xa9\'s men, on the left, was killed. The corpse was pushed aside,\r\nand the firing continued, still with the same careful regularity,\r\nand without the slightest display of haste. Projectiles were coming\r\nfrom, and exploding on all sides, whilst around each piece the same\r\nmethodical man\xc5\x93uvres were repeated, the gun was loaded with its charge\r\nand shell, the sighting was regulated, the shot was fired, and the\r\npiece, having recoiled, was run up again as though the work absorbed\r\nthese men to such a degree that they could neither see nor hear\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, was especially struck by the demeanour of the\r\ndrivers, who, stiffly erect on their horses, confronted the enemy,\r\nfifteen yards or so in the rear of the guns. Adolphe was among them\r\nwith his broad shoulders, bushy fair moustaches, and rubicund face;\r\nand a man needed to be brave, indeed, to stay there like that, without\r\nso much as blinking his eyes, whilst he watched the shells coming\r\nstraight towards him, and without being able even to bite his nails by\r\nway of occupation, and in order to divert his thoughts. The gunners\r\non their side were working; they had so much to attend to that they\r\ncould not think of danger, whereas the motionless drivers saw but death\r\nbefore their eyes, and had full leisure to ponder upon it and await\r\nits coming. They were compelled to face the enemy, because, had they\r\nturned their backs upon him, an irresistible impulse to flee might have\r\ncarried both men and horses away. A man can brave danger when he sees\r\nit. There is no more obscure and yet no greater heroism than this.\r\n\r\nAnother gunner had just had his head carried off; two horses, harnessed\r\nto a caisson, had fallen with their bellies ripped open; and the fire\r\nof the foe was proving so slaughterous that it was evident the entire\r\nbattery would be dismounted, if they obstinately remained on this same\r\nspot. Despite all the inconvenience of a change of position, it was\r\nnecessary to foil the enemy\'s terrible fire, and the captain no longer\r\nhesitated, but ordered up the fore-carriages.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous man\xc5\x93uvre was executed with lightning-like rapidity; the\r\ndrivers wheeled round again, bringing back the limbers, to which the\r\ngunners at once hooked the carriage trails. Whilst this was being\r\naccomplished, however, a lengthy front was developed, at sight of\r\nwhich the enemy redoubled his fire. Three more men thereupon fell to\r\nthe ground. Then the battery dashed off at a fast trot, describing\r\nan arc through the fields, and establishing itself some fifty yards\r\nfarther away on the right, upon a little plateau on the other side of\r\nthe position held by the 106th. The guns were unlimbered, the drivers\r\nagain found themselves confronting the foe, and the fire began afresh,\r\nwithout a pause, and with so much commotion that the ground did not\r\ncease shaking.\r\n\r\nAll at once Maurice raised a cry. In three shots the Prussian batteries\r\nhad again regulated their fire, and the third shell had fallen upon\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9\'s gun. Honor\xc3\xa9 was seen to dart forward and feel the freshly\r\nmade wound with a trembling hand; a large piece had been chipped off\r\nthe bronze muzzle. The gun could still be worked, however, and as soon\r\nas the wheels had been cleared of the corpse of another gunner, whose\r\nblood had splashed the carriage, the practice was resumed.\r\n\r\n\'No, it isn\'t little Louis,\' continued Maurice, venting his thoughts\r\naloud. \'There he is aiming; he must be wounded, however, for he\'s only\r\nusing his left arm. Ah! little Louis--he got on so well with Adolphe,\r\non condition though that the gunner, the footman, should, in spite of\r\nhis superior education, act as the humble servant of the driver, the\r\nmounted man----\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jean, hitherto silent, interrupted Maurice with a cry of\r\nanguish: \'They can never stay there; we are done for!\'\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes, indeed, this new position had become as\r\nuntenable as the previous one. The enemy\'s projectiles rained upon it\r\nwith precisely the same accuracy. One shell smashed a gun and killed\r\na lieutenant and two men. Every shot took effect, to such a degree,\r\nin fact, that if they obstinately lingered there neither a gun nor\r\nan artilleryman would soon remain. The enemy\'s fire was destruction\r\nincarnate; it swept everything away. And so, for the second time, the\r\ncaptain\'s voice rang out, ordering up the limbers.\r\n\r\nOnce more was the man\xc5\x93uvre executed, the drivers setting their horses\r\nat a gallop, and wheeling so that the gunners might again limber the\r\npieces. This time, however, during the movement, a splinter gashed\r\nLouis\' throat and tore away his jaw, and he fell across the block-trail\r\nwhich he had been raising. And just as Adolphe came up, at the moment\r\nwhen the enemy obtained a flank view of the line of teams, a furious\r\nvolley swooped down. Adolphe fell, with his chest split open, and his\r\narms outstretched, and in a last convulsion he caught hold of his\r\ncomrade; and there they lay embracing, fiercely contorted, coupled\r\ntogether even in death.\r\n\r\nBut, despite the killing of many horses, despite the disorder which\r\nthe slaughterous volley had wrought in the ranks, the entire battery\r\nwas already ascending a slope, establishing itself in a more advanced\r\nposition at a few yards from the spot where Maurice and Jean were\r\nlying. The guns were now unlimbered for the third time, the drivers\r\nagain found themselves facing the enemy, whilst the gunners immediately\r\nreopened fire with the obstinacy of unconquerable heroism.\r\n\r\n\'This is the end of everything,\' said Maurice, in a dying voice.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, indeed, as though earth and sky were mingled. The stones\r\nsplit asunder, dense smoke occasionally hid the sun. The horses stood\r\nwith their heads low, dizzy, stupefied amid the fearful uproar.\r\nWherever the captain appeared he seemed abnormally tall. At last he was\r\ncut in two--snapped, and fell like a flag-staff.\r\n\r\nThe effort was being tenaciously, deliberately prolonged, however,\r\nespecially by Honor\xc3\xa9 and his men. He, himself, despite his stripes,\r\nnow had to help work the gun, for only three gunners remained to him.\r\nHe levelled and fired whilst the three men fetched the ammunition,\r\nloaded the piece, and handled the sponge and the rammer. Spare men and\r\nhorses had been asked for to fill up the gaps that death had made,\r\nbut they were a long time coming, and meanwhile it was necessary to\r\ndo without them. The worry was that the gun still failed to carry the\r\ndistance, almost all the projectiles bursting in the air, and doing\r\nbut little harm to those terrible batteries of the foe whose fire was\r\nso efficacious. And all at once Honor\xc3\xa9 swore an oath which rang out\r\nabove all the thunder of the cannonade: there was no end to their ill\r\nluck, the gun\'s right wheel had just been pounded to pieces. Thunder!\r\nSo now the poor creature had a leg broken, and was thrown on her side,\r\nwith her nose on the ground, crippled and useless! Honor\xc3\xa9 shed big\r\ntears at the sight, and clasped her neck with his twitching hands,\r\nas though he hoped to set her erect again by the mere warmth of his\r\naffection. To think of it!--the best gun of all, the only one that had\r\nmanaged to send a few shells over yonder! Then a mad resolution took\r\npossession of him, that of immediately replacing the shattered wheel\r\nunder the enemy\'s fire. With the assistance of a gunner, he himself\r\nwent to fetch a spare wheel from the ammunition waggon, and the work\r\nthen began, the most dangerous that can be performed on the field of\r\nbattle. Fortunately the spare men and horses had eventually arrived,\r\nand a couple of fresh gunners lent a helping hand.\r\n\r\nBut once again the battery was dismantled. This heroic madness could be\r\ncarried no farther. Orders to fall back for good were on the point of\r\nbeing given.\r\n\r\n\'We must make haste, comrades!\' shouted Honor\xc3\xa9. \'We\'ll take her away at\r\nany rate; they sha\'n\'t have her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Twas his one idea, to save his gun, like others save the colours.\r\nAnd he was still speaking when he was annihilated, his right arm torn\r\naway and his left side ripped open. He fell upon the gun and remained\r\nthere as though stretched upon a bed of honour, his head still erect,\r\nand his face unscathed, turned with a fine expression of anger towards\r\nthe enemy yonder. A letter--Silvine\'s--had slipped through a rent in\r\nhis uniform and was stained with drop after drop of his blood, as he\r\ngrasped it with his twisted fingers.\r\n\r\nThe only lieutenant who had not been killed now shouted the command:\r\n\'Limber up!\'\r\n\r\nOne of the caissons had already blown up with the commotion of\r\nfireworks, fusing and bursting. The horses of another caisson had to\r\nbe taken to save a gun whose team was lying on the ground. And, this\r\nlast time, when the drivers had wheeled, and the four remaining guns\r\nhad again been limbered, the battery galloped off without stopping\r\nuntil it was some eleven hundred yards away, behind the fringing trees\r\nof the wood of La Garenne.\r\n\r\nMaurice had seen everything, and with a faint shudder of horror he\r\nrepeated in a mechanical fashion: \'Oh! the poor fellow, the poor\r\nfellow!\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though his grief imparted increased intensity to the\r\ngrowing pain that was griping his stomach. The animal part of his\r\nnature was rebelling; his strength was exhausted; he was dying of\r\nhunger. His eyesight was becoming dim, he was no longer conscious even\r\nof the danger to which the regiment was exposed, now that the battery\r\nhad been compelled to fall back. At any moment, indeed, the plateau\r\nmight be attacked by the enemy in force.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' he remarked to Jean, \'I really must eat--I\'d rather eat and be\r\nkilled at once.\'\r\n\r\nHaving opened his knapsack, he took the bread in his trembling hands\r\nand began to bite it voraciously. The bullets whistled by, a couple of\r\nshells exploded a few yards away, but nothing had any existence for him\r\nsave his hunger, which must be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\'Will you have a bit, Jean?\'\r\n\r\nStupefied, his eyes swollen, and his stomach rent by a similar craving,\r\nJean looked at him and answered: \'Yes, all the same I\'ll have some; I\r\nfeel too bad.\'\r\n\r\nThey divided the bread and ate it gluttonously, without a thought of\r\nanything else so long as a mouthful of it remained. And it was only\r\nafter they had finished that they again saw their colonel, on his\r\nbig charger, with his bloody boot. The 106th was being overlapped on\r\neither side. Some companies must have already fled, and M. de Vineuil,\r\ncompelled to give way to the torrent, raised his sword, and, with\r\nhis eyes full of tears, exclaimed, \'God shield us, my lads, since He\r\nwould not take us!\' Bands of fugitives were surrounding him, and he\r\ndisappeared from view in a depression of the ground.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing how they had got there, Jean and Maurice next found\r\nthemselves with the remnants of their company behind the hedge which\r\nthey had skirted in the morning. There remained at most some forty men\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant Rochas. The colours were with them,\r\nand with a view of trying to save them, the sub-lieutenant, acting\r\nas ensign, had just rolled the silk around the staff. They all filed\r\nalong to the end of the hedge, and then threw themselves among some\r\nlittle trees on a slope, where Rochas ordered them to open fire again.\r\nSheltered and scattered in skirmishing order, the men were able to\r\nhold out here, the more especially as a mass of cavalry was being set\r\nin motion on their right, and regiments of infantry were again being\r\nbrought into line to support it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Maurice realised the slow, invincible encompassment which was\r\non the point of being completed. Early in the morning he had seen the\r\nPrussians debouching from the defile of St. Albert, reaching first St.\r\nMenges, and then Fleigneux, and now he could not only hear the cannon\r\nof the Prussian Guard thundering behind the wood of La Garenne, but\r\nbegan to perceive some other German uniforms coming up by the heights\r\nof Givonne. But a few minutes more and the circle would close up, and\r\nthe Guard would join hands with the Fifth German Corps, surrounding the\r\nFrench army with a living wall, an annihilating belt of artillery. It\r\nmust have been with the desperate thought of making a last effort, of\r\nstriving to break through this marching wall, that a division of the\r\nreserve cavalry, that commanded by General Margueritte, was now being\r\nmassed behind a fold in the ground in readiness to charge. They, were,\r\nindeed, about to charge to death, without any possibility of effecting\r\ntheir object, but for the honour of France. And Maurice, thinking of\r\nProsper, witnessed the terrible sight.\r\n\r\nSince early morning Prosper had done nothing but urge on his horse,\r\ncontinually marching and counter-marching from one to the other end of\r\nthe plateau of Illy. He and his comrades had been wakened one by one\r\nat dawn, without any trumpet call; and in order that they might make\r\ntheir coffee they had ingeniously contrived to screen each fire with\r\na cloak so as not to set the Prussians on the alert. After that they\r\nhad remained in ignorance of everything. They could certainly hear the\r\nguns, see the smoke, espy distant movements of infantry, but in the\r\ncomplete inaction in which they were left by the generals they knew\r\nnothing of the incidents of the battle, its importance and its results.\r\nProsper, for his own part, was so sleepy that he could hardly keep\r\nup. Fatigue was the great suffering: bad nights, an accumulation of\r\nweariness, followed by invincible somnolence when the men rocked in\r\nthe saddle. Prosper himself became a prey to hallucinations--fancied\r\nat times that he was on the ground, snoring on a mattress of pebbles;\r\nor dreamt that he was in a comfortable bed with clean white sheets.\r\nSometimes he actually slept in the saddle for minutes together,\r\nbecoming a mere moving thing, carried along according to the chances of\r\nthe trot. In this way some of his comrades had occasionally fallen from\r\ntheir mounts. They were all so weary that the trumpet calls no longer\r\nawoke them; it was only by dint of kicking that they could be roused\r\nfrom oblivion and set upon their legs.\r\n\r\n\'What game are they having, what game are they having with us?\' Prosper\r\nkept on saying, in the hope that by doing so he might shake off his\r\nirresistible torpor.\r\n\r\nThe cannon had been thundering since six o\'clock. A couple of comrades\r\nhad been killed by a shell beside him while they were ascending a hill,\r\nand, farther on, three others had fallen to the ground, riddled with\r\nbullets which had come no one knew whence. This useless, dangerous\r\nmilitary promenade across the battlefield was altogether exasperating.\r\nAt last, however, at about one o\'clock, he realised that the commanders\r\nhad decided to get them killed in a decent fashion, at any rate. The\r\nwhole of General Margueritte\'s division, three regiments of Chasseurs\r\nd\'Afrique, one of Chasseurs de France, and one of Hussars had just\r\nbeen assembled in a fold of the ground, on the left of the road, and\r\nslightly below the Calvary. The trumpets had sounded \'Dismount,\' and\r\nthe officers thereupon gave orders to tighten the girths and secure the\r\nkits.\r\n\r\nProsper dismounted, stretched himself, and fondled Zephyr with his\r\nhand. Poor Zephyr! he was as stultified as his master, quite worn out\r\nby the stupid life he was led. Besides, he carried such a multitude\r\nof things: First, there was the linen in the holsters, and the cloak\r\nrolled up above them; then the blouse, the overalls, and the haversack,\r\nwith everything required for grooming, behind the saddle; and in\r\naddition there was the provision bag thrown across the horse\'s back,\r\nwithout mentioning the goat-skin, the water-can, and the mess-tin. The\r\nChasseur\'s heart was flooded with tender compassion for his steed as\r\nhe tightened the girth and made sure that all the paraphernalia on his\r\nback was properly secured.\r\n\r\nIt was a trying moment. Prosper, who was not more of a coward than his\r\ncomrades, felt his mouth quite parched, and lighted a cigarette. When\r\norders are given to charge, each man may fairly say: \'It\'s all up with\r\nme this time;\' so few, indeed, are the chances in his favour.\r\n\r\nSome five or six minutes went by, and the men told one another that\r\nGeneral Margueritte had gone forward to reconnoitre the ground.\r\nMeantime, they waited. The five regiments had been assembled in three\r\ncolumns; each column was seven squadrons deep, so there would be plenty\r\nof food for the enemy\'s cannon.\r\n\r\nAll at once the trumpets sounded: \'To horse!\' And almost immediately\r\nafterwards another command rang out: \'Draw swords!\'\r\n\r\nThe colonel of each regiment had already galloped forward, taking up\r\nhis regulation position--at seven-and-twenty yards in advance of the\r\nfront. The captains were at their places at the head of their men. Then\r\nthe spell of waiting began again, amid death-like silence. No longer\r\na sound, not even the faintest breath was heard under the fierce sun.\r\nThe men\'s hearts alone were beating. But another command, the last, and\r\nthen this motionless mass would spring forward, and rush onward with\r\nthe speed of a tempest.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, however, a mounted officer, wounded and supported by\r\ntwo men, appeared upon the hill-crest. At first he was not recognised;\r\nthen a roar resounded, swelling into a furious clamour. It was General\r\nMargueritte, whose cheeks had been transpierced by a bullet, and who\r\nwas destined to die of his wound. He was unable to speak, but he waved\r\nhis arm towards the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe clamour was still increasing: \'Our general! Vengeance! vengeance!\'\r\n\r\nThereupon the colonel of the first regiment raised his sabre in the\r\nair, and cried in a voice like thunder: \'Charge!\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpets sounded and the mass started off, first of all at a trot.\r\nProsper was in the front rank, but almost at the end of the right\r\nwing. The greatest danger is in the centre, upon which the enemy\r\ninstinctively directs his more violent fire. When they had reached the\r\ncrest of the Calvary and were beginning to descend the other slope,\r\nin the direction of the broad plain, Prosper could distinctly see, a\r\nthousand yards ahead of him, the Prussian squares against which they\r\nwere being hurled. He trotted along, however, as though he were in a\r\ndream, swaying like a man asleep, feeling light and buoyant, and with\r\nhis brain so empty that he had no idea of anything. He had become a\r\nmere machine worked by an irresistible power. Orders were repeated\r\nfor the men to keep as close together as possible, knee to knee, so\r\nthat they might acquire the resistive strength of granite. And as the\r\ntrot became swifter and changed into a desperate gallop, the Chasseurs\r\nd\'Afrique in Arab fashion began raising savage yells which maddened\r\ntheir horses. It soon became a diabolical race, at hellish speed, and\r\nas an accompaniment to the furious gallop and the ferocious howls there\r\nresounded the crackling of the fusillade, the bullets striking the\r\ncans and pans of the advancing squadrons, the brass on the uniforms of\r\nthe men and on the harness of the horses, with the loud pit-a-pat of\r\nhail. And through this hail swept the shells--the hurricane of wind\r\nand thunder which shook the ground and impregnated the sunlight with a\r\nstench akin to that of burning wool and sweating beasts.\r\n\r\nAt five hundred yards from the foe a furious eddy, sweeping everything\r\naway, threw Prosper from his horse. He caught Zephyr by the mane,\r\nhowever, and managed to get into the saddle again. Riddled and broken\r\nby the fusillade, the centre had just given way, and the two wings were\r\nwhirling round, falling back to re-form and rush forward once more.\r\nThis was the fatal, foreseen annihilation of the first squadron. The\r\nfallen horses barred the ground; some had been struck dead on the spot;\r\nothers were struggling in violent throes; and dismounted soldiers could\r\nbe seen running hither and thither at the full speed of their little\r\nlegs in search of other horses. The dead were already strewing the\r\nplain, and many riderless chargers continued galloping, coming back\r\nto the ranks of their own accord so that they might return at a mad\r\npace to the fight, as though the powder fascinated them. The charge\r\nwas resumed; the second squadron swept on with growing fury, the men\r\nbending low over their horses\' necks, with their sabres on a level with\r\nthe knee, ready to strike. Another couple of hundred yards were covered\r\namid a deafening, tempestuous clamour. Yet again did the bullets make\r\na gap in the centre, men and horses fell, arresting the onslaught with\r\nthe inextricable obstruction of their corpses. And thus, in its turn,\r\nwas the second squadron mowed down, annihilated, leaving the front\r\nplace to those that followed behind it.\r\n\r\nWhen, with heroic obstinacy, the third charge was made, Prosper found\r\nhimself mixed up with some Hussars and Chasseurs de France. The\r\nregiments were mingling; there was now only a huge wave of horsemen\r\nwhich incessantly broke and re-formed, carrying whatever it met along\r\nwith it. Prosper no longer had any idea of anything; he had surrendered\r\nhimself to his horse, brave Zephyr, whom he was so fond of, and who\r\nseemed maddened by a wound in the ear. At present he was in the centre;\r\nother horses reared and fell around him; some men were thrown to the\r\nground as by a hurricane, whilst others, though shot dead, remained in\r\nthe saddle, and continued charging, showing but the whites of their\r\neyes. And, this time, again, another two hundred yards having been\r\ncovered, the stubble in the rear of the squadrons was littered with\r\ndead and dying. There were some whose heads had sunk deep into the\r\nsoil. Others, who had fallen on their backs, gazed at the great round\r\nsun with terrified eyes starting from their sockets. Then there was\r\na big black horse, an officer\'s charger, whose belly had been ripped\r\nopen, and who vainly strove to rise with the hoofs of both forelegs\r\ncaught in his entrails. Whilst the foe redoubled his fire, the wings\r\nwhirled once again, and fell back, to return, however, to the charge\r\nwith desperate fury.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, only the fourth squadron, at the fourth onslaught, that\r\nreached the Prussian lines. Prosper, with his sabre uplifted, smote\r\nthe helmets and the dark uniforms that he saw through the smoky mist.\r\nBlood flowed, and on noticing that Zephyr\'s mouth was ensanguined, he\r\nimagined that it was through having bitten the foe. So frightful was\r\nthe clamour becoming, that he could no longer hear himself shout, and\r\nyet his throat was being almost torn away by the yells that issued from\r\nit. Behind the first Prussian line, however, there was yet another\r\none, then another, and then another. Heroism remained of no avail;\r\nthose deep masses of men were like lofty herbage amid which horses and\r\nhorsemen disappeared. Mow them down as you might, there were always\r\nthousands left standing. The firing continued with such intensity,\r\nthe muzzles of the needle guns were so close, that uniforms were set\r\non fire. All foundered, sank down among the bayonets; chests were\r\ntranspierced, and skulls were split. Two-thirds of those regiments of\r\nhorsemen were to remain on the field, and of that famous charge there\r\nwould abide but the memory of the glorious madness of having attempted\r\nit. And, all at once, Zephyr, in his turn, was struck by a bullet full\r\nin the chest, and fell to the ground, crushing under him Prosper\'s\r\nright thigh, the pain of which was so acute that the Chasseur fainted.\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean, who had been watching the heroic gallop of the\r\nsquadrons, gave vent to a cry of rage: \'Thunder! Bravery\'s not a bit of\r\ngood.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then they continued discharging their chassepots, on their haunches\r\nbehind the bushes of the little hillock, where they and their comrades\r\nwere scattered in skirmishing order. Rochas himself had picked up a gun\r\nand joined in the firing. This time, however, the plateau of Illy was\r\nwell lost, the Prussian troops were invading it from all sides. It must\r\nnow have been about two o\'clock, the junction of the hostile forces was\r\nat last being effected, the Fifth Corps and the Prussian Guard were\r\nmeeting and buckling the belt.\r\n\r\nAll at once Jean was thrown to the ground. \'I\'m done for,\' he stammered.\r\n\r\nA heavy blow, like that of a hammer, had struck him on the crown of\r\nthe head, and his cap, torn and carried off, was lying behind him. He\r\nat first thought that his skull was split, that his brain was bare,\r\nand for a few seconds he dared not raise his hand to the spot, feeling\r\ncertain he should find a hole there. Then, having ventured to do so, he\r\ndrew away his hands and found them red with a thick flow of blood. And\r\nthe pain was so great that he fainted.\r\n\r\nAt that same moment Rochas gave orders to fall back. A Prussian company\r\nwas now no more than two or three hundred yards distant. If they\r\nremained they would be caught. \'Don\'t hurry, though,\' said he, \'turn on\r\nthe way and fire another shot. We will rally behind that low wall.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, was in despair. \'We are surely not going to leave our\r\ncorporal here, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'But what can be done if his account\'s settled?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no; he still breathes. Let\'s carry him.\'\r\n\r\nRochas shrugged his shoulders as though to say that they could not\r\nencumber themselves with every man who fell. Then Maurice turned\r\nsupplicatingly to Pache and Lapoulle: \'Come,\' said he, \'lend me a hand.\r\nI\'m not strong enough by myself.\'\r\n\r\nBut they did not listen to him, did not hear him; the instinct of\r\nself-preservation was so absorbing that neither had thought for any but\r\nhimself. They were already gliding along on their knees, disappearing\r\nat a gallop in the direction of the low wall. And now the Prussians\r\nwere only a hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nShedding tears of rage, Maurice, who had remained alone with Jean,\r\ntook him in his arms and endeavoured to carry him off. But he was\r\nindeed too weak, too puny, exhausted moreover by fatigue and anguish.\r\nAlmost at the first step he staggered and fell with his burden. If he\r\ncould only have seen a bearer! He looked about him wildly, fancied he\r\ncould distinguish some bearers among the fugitive soldiers, and waved\r\nhis arm to them. But nobody came. Then, collecting all his remaining\r\nstrength, he again took up Jean, and succeeded in carrying him some\r\nthirty paces, when a shell having exploded near them, he fancied it was\r\nall over, and that he also was about to die on his comrade\'s body.\r\n\r\nHe slowly picked himself up, felt himself, found himself unscathed,\r\nwithout a scratch. Why did he not flee? There was still time; he could\r\nreach the wall in a few bounds, and that would mean salvation. Fear was\r\ncoming back again, distracting him, and he was on the point of rushing\r\naway, when bonds, stronger even than death, held him back. No! it was\r\nimpossible; he could not abandon Jean. It would have made him bleed\r\nfrom every pore; the fraternity that had sprung up between that peasant\r\nand himself extended to the depths of his being, to the very roots of\r\nlife. Its origin might have been traced back, perhaps, to the first\r\ndays of the world; for it was as though there had been but two men left\r\nin all creation, one of whom could not part from the other without\r\nparting from himself.\r\n\r\nIf Maurice had not eaten that crust of bread amid the shells, an hour\r\npreviously, he would never have found the strength to do that which\r\nhe now did. Later on, moreover, he was unable to recollect how he\r\nhad accomplished it. He must have lifted Jean on to his shoulders,\r\nhave dragged himself along, have halted and set out afresh a score of\r\ntimes amid the stubble and the bushes, stumbling over each stone he\r\nencountered, but still and ever setting himself upon his legs again.\r\nHe was sustained by an unconquerable will, a resistive power that\r\nwould have enabled him to carry a mountain. When he at last got behind\r\nthe wall, he there again found Rochas and the few remaining men of\r\nthe company, who were still firing, defending the colours which the\r\nsub-lieutenant was carrying under his arm.\r\n\r\nNo line of retreat had been indicated to the different army corps for\r\nadoption in the event of a defeat. This lack of foresight and the\r\nprevailing confusion left each general free to act as he pleased,\r\nand now they all found themselves thrown back on Sedan, within the\r\nformidable embrace of the victorious German armies. The Seventh Corps\'\r\nSecond Division was retiring in fairly good order, but the remnants of\r\nits other divisions, mingled with the remnants of the First Corps, were\r\nalready rolling towards the town in a fearful mob--a torrent of rage\r\nand fright, in which men and horses were swept along.\r\n\r\nJust then, however, Maurice was delighted to see Jean opening his\r\neyes. He wished to wash his face for him, and as he was hastening to\r\na rill near by, he was greatly astonished when, on his right hand, in\r\nthe depths of a secluded valley, sheltered by rugged slopes, he again\r\nespied the same peasant whom he had seen in the morning, and who was\r\nstill leisurely turning up the sod, guiding his plough drawn by a big\r\nwhite horse. Why should a day be lost? Corn would not cease growing,\r\nnor would the human race cease living simply because it pleased some\r\nmen to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE FLAG--THE HORRORS OF AN AMBULANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, up above on the lofty terrace, whither he had climbed to\r\nobtain some idea of the situation, Delaherche again became excited\r\nby impatience to know what was happening. He saw very well that the\r\nshells were passing over the town, and realised that the three or four,\r\nwhich had burst through some of the surrounding roofs, could merely\r\nbe infrequent replies to the fire of the Palatinate fort, so slack\r\nand inefficacious. But he distinguished nothing of the battle, and\r\nexperienced a pressing desire for information which was quickened by\r\nthe dread that he might lose both fortune and life in the catastrophe.\r\nSo he went down, leaving the telescope up there, levelled upon the\r\nGerman batteries.\r\n\r\nOnce below, however, the sight which the central garden of the factory\r\npresented momentarily arrested his steps. It was nearly one o\'clock,\r\nand the wounded were crowding into the ambulance. There was already a\r\ndeficiency of the regulation conveyances, both of the two and the four\r\nwheelers; and ammunition and forage waggons, vans for the transport\r\nof _mat\xc3\xa9riel_, in fact, whatever vehicles it had been possible to\r\nrequisition on the battlefield, now made their appearance. Eventually\r\nthere even came tilted and other carts belonging to cultivators, taken\r\nfrom farms, and to which stray horses had been harnessed. And heaped\r\ntogether in all these vehicles were the men who had been picked up\r\nand summarily attended to by the field ambulance. Frightful was the\r\nunloading of these poor fellows, some greenly pallid, and others\r\nviolet from congestion. Many of them had fainted, and others were\r\nraising shrill plaints. Some, who were struck with stupor, surrendered\r\nthemselves to the attendants with a look of terror, whilst a few\r\nexpired as soon as touched, unable to endure the slightest shaking. To\r\nsuch a degree was the ambulance being invaded that in another moment\r\nthere would not remain a single unoccupied mattress in the spacious\r\ndrying-hall, and Surgeon-Major Bouroche was accordingly ordering the\r\nattendants to utilise the large litter of straw which he had spread\r\nat one end of the structure. As yet, however, he and his assistants\r\nsufficed for the requisite operations. He had merely asked that a\r\nsecond table, with a mattress and some oilcloth, might be placed in\r\nthe shed where he operated. Here an assistant swiftly applied a napkin\r\ndipped in chloroform to the patient\'s nose, the narrow steel blades\r\nflashed before the eyes; the saws gave out a faint rasping sound, and\r\nthe blood flowed in sudden spurts, instantly arrested. The wounded\r\nwere brought in and carried away amid a rapid coming-and-going, time\r\nbeing scarcely allowed for wiping the oilcloth with a sponge. And\r\nat the farther end of the lawn, behind a clump of laburnums, it had\r\nbeen necessary to form a kind of charnel-place where the attendants\r\ndisembarrassed themselves of the dead, and whither they also went to\r\nthrow the amputated legs and arms, all the remnants of flesh and bones\r\nremaining on the tables.\r\n\r\nOld Madame Delaherche and Gilberte, seated under one of the lofty\r\ntrees, could no longer roll bands enough, and Bouroche, who passed by\r\nwith his face flaming and his apron already crimson with blood, threw\r\na packet of linen to Delaherche, exclaiming: \'Here! do something, make\r\nyourself useful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' protested the manufacturer, \'but I must go out for news;\r\nwe no longer know whether we are alive.\' And then, lightly touching his\r\nwife\'s hair with his lips, \'My poor Gilberte,\' he added, \'to think that\r\na shell might set everything on fire here. It\'s frightful!\'\r\n\r\nShe was very pale, and raising her head, glanced around her with a\r\nshudder. But that involuntary, invincible smile of hers speedily came\r\nback to her lips: \'Yes, frightful!\' she said, \'all those men whom they\r\nare cutting up. It\'s a wonder that I can stay here without fainting.\'\r\n\r\nOld Madame Delaherche had looked at her son as he kissed his wife\'s\r\nhair, and had made a gesture as though to push him aside, for she\r\nthought of that other man by whom that same hair must also have been\r\nkissed. Her old hands trembled, however, and she let them fall,\r\nmurmuring: \'How much suffering, good Lord! One forgets one\'s own.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche then went off, explaining that he should speedily return\r\nwith positive information. As soon as he was in the Rue Maqua he was\r\nsurprised at the number of soldiers who were already returning from\r\nthe field without their weapons, and with their uniforms in shreds,\r\nsoiled with dust. He could not, however, obtain any precise details\r\nfrom those whom he endeavoured to question. Some, who were quite\r\nstupefied, replied that they didn\'t know; whilst others had such a deal\r\nto relate, and gesticulated so furiously, and talked so extravagantly,\r\nthat they resembled madmen. He thereupon directed his steps once more\r\ntowards the Sub-Prefecture, thinking to himself that all the news\r\nmust flow thither. As he was crossing the Place du Coll\xc3\xa8ge, a couple\r\nof guns, doubtless the only remaining pieces of some battery, came up\r\nat a gallop, and stranded beside the footway. On reaching the High\r\nStreet he had to acknowledge that the town was becoming quite crowded\r\nwith fugitives. Three dismounted Hussars were sitting in a doorway,\r\ndividing a loaf of bread; two others were slowly leading their horses\r\nby the bridle, at a loss for a stable where they might tether them;\r\nofficers, too, were running wildly hither and thither, looking as\r\nif they did not know where they were going. On the Place Turenne a\r\nsub-lieutenant advised Delaherche not to linger there, for the shells\r\nwere falling very frequently, a splinter of one of them having just\r\nbroken the railing around the statue of the great captain, the victor\r\nof the Palatinate. And, as Delaherche was swiftly gliding along the Rue\r\nde la Sous-Pr\xc3\xa9fecture, he saw a couple of projectiles explode, with a\r\nfrightful crash, on the bridge spanning the Meuse.\r\n\r\nReaching the Sub-Prefecture, he was standing in front of the porter\'s\r\nlodge, seeking a pretext to ask for one of the aides-de-camp and\r\nquestion him, when a youthful voice called him by name: \'Monsieur\r\nDelaherche! come in quick; it\'s anything but pleasant outside.\'\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Rose, his work-girl, whom he had not thought of. Thanks\r\nto her, however, every door would be opened to him. He entered the\r\nlodge and accepted a seat.\r\n\r\n\'Just fancy,\' began Rose, \'all this business has made mother quite ill;\r\nshe\'s in bed and can\'t get up. So there\'s only me, you see, for father\r\nis at the citadel, being a National Guard. A little while ago the\r\nEmperor again wanted to show his bravery, for he went out again and was\r\nable to get to the end of the street, as far as the bridge. But then a\r\nshell fell in front of him, and the horse of one of his equerries was\r\nkilled. And so he came back again--not surprising, is it? What would\r\nyou have him do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you know how we are situated--what do the officers say?\'\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look of astonishment. Amid all these abominations,\r\nbut little of which she understood, she bustled about assiduously,\r\nretaining her gay freshness, with her fine hair and her clear eyes, the\r\neyes of the child she was. \'No, I know nothing,\' she said; \'at twelve\r\no\'clock I took up a letter for Marshal MacMahon. The Emperor was with\r\nhim. They remained shut up together for nearly an hour, the marshal in\r\nbed, and the Emperor on a chair close to the mattress. I know that,\r\nbecause I saw them when the door was opened.\'\r\n\r\n\'What were they saying?\'\r\n\r\nShe again looked at him, and could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Why, I don\'t know,\' she answered. \'How could I know? Nobody in the\r\nworld knows what they said to one another.\'[30]\r\n\r\nThat was true, and Delaherche made a gesture as though to apologise\r\nfor his foolish question. Still the idea of that supreme conversation\r\nworried him; how interesting it must have been! What decision could\r\nthey have come to?\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' added Rose, \'the Emperor has gone back into his private\r\nroom, where he\'s conferring with two generals who arrived just now\r\nfrom the battlefield.\' She paused and glanced towards the house-steps:\r\n\'Look! here comes one of the generals--and look! here\'s the other.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche hastily stepped out of the lodge and recognised Generals\r\nDouay and Ducrot, whose horses were waiting. He watched them get into\r\nthe saddle again and gallop off. After the abandonment of the plateau\r\nof Illy, each, on his own side, had hastened into the town to warn\r\nthe Emperor that the battle was lost. They furnished him with precise\r\ndetails of the situation; the army and Sedan were now completely\r\nenveloped, and the disaster would prove frightful.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes the Emperor walked up and down his room in silence,\r\nwith the wavering step of a sick man. The only person there besides\r\nhimself was an aide-de-camp, standing erect and silent near a door.\r\nAnd, with a disfigured face which was now twitching with a nervous\r\ntic, Napoleon kept pacing to and fro between the chimney-piece and\r\nthe window. His back appeared to have become more bent, as though a\r\nworld had fallen upon it; and his dim eyes, veiled by their heavy\r\nlids, bespoke the resignation of the fatalist who has played and lost\r\nhis final game with Destiny. Each time, however, that he reached the\r\nwindow, set ajar, he gave a start which, for a second, made him pause;\r\nand during one of those brief halts he raised a trembling hand and\r\nmuttered: \'Oh! those guns, those guns! one has heard them ever since\r\nthe morning.\'\r\n\r\nFrom that spot, indeed, the roaring of the batteries of the Marf\xc3\xa9e and\r\nFr\xc3\xa9nois hills reached the ear with extraordinary violence--it was a\r\nrolling thunder, which not merely rattled the window panes, but shook\r\nthe very walls, a stubborn, incessant, exasperating uproar. And the\r\nEmperor must have reflected that the struggle was henceforth a hopeless\r\none, that all resistance was becoming a crime. What could it avail,\r\nwhy should more blood be spilt, more limbs be shattered, more heads\r\nbe carried off, more and more dead be ever and ever added to those\r\nalready scattered across the country-side? Since they, the French,\r\nwere vanquished, since it was all over, why continue the massacre any\r\nlonger? Sufficient abomination and suffering already cried out aloud\r\nunder the sun.\r\n\r\nOnce more did the Emperor reach the window, and again he began to\r\ntremble, with his hands raised: \'Oh! those guns, those guns! Will they\r\nnever stop?\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps the terrible thought of his responsibility was arising within\r\nhim, with a vision of the thousands of bleeding corpses stretched upon\r\nthe ground over yonder, through his fault. Perhaps, though, it was\r\nbut the melting of his heart--the pitiful heart of a dreamer, of a\r\nman in reality good-natured and haunted by humanitarian notions. And\r\nalbeit Fate had dealt him this frightful blow--which was crushing and\r\nsweeping away his fortune as though it were but a bit of straw--he\r\nyet found tears for others, was distracted that this useless butchery\r\nshould still continue, and lacked the strength to endure it any longer.\r\nThat villainous cannonade was now rending his breast, at each moment\r\nincreasing his agony.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! those guns, those guns! Make them stop firing at once--at once.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then this Emperor, who, having confided his powers to the\r\nEmpress-Regent, no longer had any throne; this generalissimo, who,\r\nsince he had surrendered the supreme command to Marshal Bazaine, no\r\nlonger commanded, awoke once more to the exercise of his power--to the\r\nirresistible needment of being the master for the last time. Since his\r\nstay at Ch\xc3\xa2lons he had kept in the background, had not given an order;\r\ncontent, in his resignation, to become nothing more than a nameless\r\nand cumbersome inutility, a troublesome parcel carried along among the\r\nbaggage train of the troops. And it was only in the hour of defeat that\r\nthe emperor again awoke within him; the first, the only order that he\r\nwas yet to give, in the scared compassion of his heart, was to hoist\r\nthe white flag upon the citadel to beg a truce.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! those guns, those guns! Take a sheet, a table-cloth, no matter\r\nwhat! Run quickly, tell them to stop those guns!\'\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp hastily left the room, and the Emperor continued\r\nhis wavering march from the chimney-piece to the window, whilst the\r\nbatteries kept on thundering, shaking the house from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nDelaherche was still talking with Rose when a sergeant, on duty at the\r\nSub-Prefecture, ran into the lodge: \'Mademoiselle,\' said he, \'we can\'t\r\nfind anything. I can\'t see a servant anywhere. Do you happen to have\r\nany linen--a piece of white linen?\'\r\n\r\n\'Will a napkin do?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no; that wouldn\'t be large enough. Half a sheet would do.\'\r\n\r\nRose, ever obliging, had already darted to the wardrobe. \'I haven\'t any\r\nhalf-sheets,\' said she. \'A large piece of white linen--no, I don\'t see\r\nanything that would suit you--Oh! would you like a table-cloth?\'\r\n\r\n\'A table-cloth? Nothing could be better; that\'s exactly what we want.\'\r\nAnd as he turned to go he added: \'We are going to make a white flag\r\nof it, and hoist it on the citadel, to ask for peace. Much obliged,\r\nmademoiselle.\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche gave a start of involuntary delight. At last, then, they\r\nwere going to have quietness. It occurred to him, however, that his joy\r\nwas unpatriotic, and he restrained it. Nevertheless his lightened heart\r\nbeat quickly, and he eagerly watched a colonel and a captain, who,\r\nfollowed by the sergeant, were now coming out of the Sub-Prefecture\r\nwith hasty steps. The colonel was carrying the table-cloth, rolled up,\r\nunder his arm. It occurred to Delaherche to follow them, and he took\r\nleave of Rose, who was quite proud of having provided that cloth. Just\r\nthen it struck two o\'clock.\r\n\r\nIn front of the town-hall Delaherche was hustled by a stream of haggard\r\nsoldiers coming from the Faubourg of La Cassine. He lost sight of the\r\ncolonel, and thereupon renounced his intention of going to see the\r\nhoisting of the white flag. He would certainly not be allowed to enter\r\nthe keep; and besides, on hearing some people say that shells were\r\nfalling on the college, he was once more filled with anxiety. Perhaps\r\nhis factory had caught fire during his absence. Thereupon he darted\r\noff again, possessed by a feverish desire to be on the move, which he\r\nendeavoured to satisfy by running through the streets. Groups of people\r\nbarred his way, however; at each crossing there were fresh obstacles.\r\nIt was only on reaching the Rue Maqua that he gave a sigh of relief,\r\non finding that the monumental front of his house was intact, that\r\nneither a puff of smoke nor a spark of fire was to be seen. He went in\r\nand called out to his mother and his wife: \'Things are going all right;\r\nthey are hoisting the white flag, so the firing will soon be over.\'\r\n\r\nThen he stopped short, for the scene which the ambulance presented\r\nwas really terrible. Not only was every mattress occupied in the\r\nspacious drying-room, the door of which was open, but there no longer\r\nremained any space even on the litter of straw spread out at one end\r\nof the building. More straw was now being laid between the beds: the\r\nwounded were being closely packed, one beside the other. There were\r\nalready more than a couple of hundred of them, and others were still\r\narriving. A white light streamed from the broad windows upon all this\r\naccumulation of human suffering. At times there arose some involuntary\r\ncry occasioned by too sudden a movement; and now and again the rattle\r\nof the death pangs was wafted through the moist atmosphere. From one\r\nend of the room there long resounded a continuous, gentle, almost\r\nmusical wail. Then the silence became deeper, like a kind of resigned\r\nstupor, like the oppressive mournfulness of a death room, broken only\r\nby the steps and whispers of the attendants. The wounds, most of which\r\nhad been hastily dressed on the battlefield, though some had remained\r\nbare, untended, were displayed in all their distressful horror, amid\r\nshreds of torn capotes and trousers. Feet were stretched out, still\r\nbooted, but crushed and bleeding. Inert limbs dangled from knees and\r\nelbows which had been smashed as though by blows of a hammer. There\r\nwere broken hands and hanging fingers, too, sustained by mere strips\r\nof skin. Most numerous, apparently, were the fractured legs and arms,\r\nstiffened by pain and as heavy as lead; but the disquieting wounds\r\nwere especially those that had opened up the stomach, the chest, or\r\nthe head. Blood was flowing from flanks that had been frightfully\r\nlacerated; bowels had become knotted under upraised skin; some men,\r\nthrough their loins being gashed and hacked, were twisted into\r\nfrightfully distorted postures. Some lungs had been perforated through\r\nand through with so small a hole that no blood flowed; others had a\r\ngaping aperture whence life was ebbing in a red stream; and there\r\nwere men, too, who suddenly became delirious and black, killed all at\r\nonce by internal h\xc3\xa6morrhage. The heads had suffered yet more severely\r\nthan the bodies; jaws had been smashed, teeth and tongue formed but a\r\nbloody mixture; eyes had been driven half out of their torn sockets;\r\nskulls had been split open, and cerebral substance was visible. All\r\nthose whose brains or marrow had been touched by the projectiles lay\r\nlike corpses, in the prostration of coma; whilst others, the fractured,\r\nthe feverish ones, moved restlessly and begged for water in low,\r\nsupplicating voices.\r\n\r\nAnd in the shed close by, where the operations were performed, there\r\nwere yet more horrors. In this first scramble, only the more urgent\r\noperations were proceeded with, those necessitated by the desperate\r\ncondition of the wounded. Whenever there was any danger of h\xc3\xa6morrhage\r\nBouroche immediately began to amputate. And, in the same way, when\r\nthe projectiles were lodged in any dangerous part, the base of the\r\nneck, the region of the axilla, the origin of the thigh, the bend of\r\nthe elbow, or the knee joint, he did not spend time in feeling for\r\nthem and removing them. The wounds which he preferred to leave under\r\nobservation, were simply dressed by the attendants in accordance with\r\nhis instructions. For his own part he had already performed four\r\namputations, spacing them out, resting himself, as it were, between\r\nthese more serious operations by extracting a few bullets. And he was\r\nnow beginning to feel tired. There were only two tables, his own and\r\nanother, at which one of his assistants operated. A sheet had just been\r\nhung up between them, so that the men operated upon might not see one\r\nanother. And, despite all the washing with sponges, the tables remained\r\nblood-red, whilst the pails, which were emptied a few paces off over a\r\nbed of China asters, those pails, whose clear water a glassful of blood\r\nsufficed to dye, seemed to be pails of pure blood--blood flung in a\r\nsplashing, drenching shower over the flowers of the lawn. And, although\r\nthe air freely circulated in the open shed, a nauseous stench now arose\r\nfrom the tables, linen and instruments there, mingling with a vague\r\nsmell of chloroform.\r\n\r\nPitiful at heart, Delaherche was shuddering with compassion, when he\r\nfelt interested at sight of a landau entering the porch. This carriage,\r\nthe only vehicle, no doubt, that the men of the field ambulance had\r\nbeen able to find, was packed full of wounded. There were eight of\r\nthem inside it, one atop of another; and when, in the last man who was\r\nlifted out, the manufacturer recognised Captain Beaudoin, he raised a\r\ncry of mingled terror and surprise: \'Oh! my poor friend! Wait a moment,\r\nI will call my mother and my wife.\'\r\n\r\nThey hastened to the spot, leaving a couple of servant-girls to\r\ncontinue making the linen-rollers. The attendants, who had taken the\r\ncaptain out of the carriage, carried him into the drying-room, and were\r\nabout to lay him on some straw there, when, upon one of the mattresses,\r\nDelaherche perceived a soldier with ashy face and open eyes, who no\r\nlonger stirred.\r\n\r\n\'I say, that fellow\'s dead!\' the manufacturer exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'So he is,\' muttered an attendant. \'We\'ll get rid of him and make\r\nroom for that officer.\' Thereupon he and a comrade took up the corpse\r\nand carried it to the charnel-place behind the laburnums. There were\r\nalready a dozen dead men lying there, stiffened in the last rattle,\r\nsome with their feet stretched out as though distended by suffering,\r\nothers all awry, twisted into atrocious postures. There were some\r\nshowing only the whites of their eyes, and sneering, with their lips\r\nturned outwardly and displaying their white teeth; whilst several,\r\nupon whose drawn, elongated faces there lingered a fearfully mournful\r\nexpression, were yet shedding big tears. One skinny, youthful little\r\nfellow, whose head had been split open, was convulsively pressing a\r\nwoman\'s portrait--a common, faded, blood-smeared photograph--to his\r\nheart. And, pell-mell, at the feet of the corpses, were piled the\r\namputated legs and arms, everything that was cut away, hewn off on the\r\noperating tables--the parings of flesh and bone of a butcher\'s shop,\r\nswept, as it were, into a corner.\r\n\r\nGilberte had shuddered at sight of Captain Beaudoin. Good God! how pale\r\nhe was, lying on that mattress there, his face quite white under the\r\nfilth that soiled it. And she was frozen with appalment, remembering\r\nthat but a few hours previously he had been full of life. She fell upon\r\nher knees: \'What a misfortune, my friend! But it\'s nothing dangerous,\r\nis it?\'\r\n\r\nShe had pulled out her handkerchief in a mechanical fashion, and\r\nwiped his face with it, unable to tolerate him in that dirty state,\r\ngrimed with earth, gunpowder, and sweat. It seemed to her also that by\r\ncleansing him a little, she gave him some relief: \'It is not dangerous,\r\nis it? It\'s only your leg.\'\r\n\r\nEmerging from a kind of somnolence the captain painfully opened his\r\neyes, and, recognising his friends, he tried to smile at them: \'Yes,\r\nonly my leg; I did not even feel the blow, I thought I had slipped and\r\nwas falling.\' He had to pause, for he could only speak with difficulty:\r\n\'Oh! I\'m so thirsty,\' he added, \'so thirsty.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, old Madame Delaherche, who was leaning over him on the other\r\nside of the mattress, went off in all haste to fetch a glass and a\r\ndecanter of water with which a small quantity of cognac had been mixed.\r\nAnd when the captain had eagerly drained the glass, she had to divide\r\nwhat remained in the decanter among the wounded near by; every hand was\r\noutstretched, and ardent voices supplicated her. A Zouave, for whom\r\nthere was none left, began to sob.\r\n\r\nDelaherche, meantime, was seeking an opportunity to speak to the major,\r\nin order that the captain might receive prompt attention. Bouroche\r\nhad just come in with his bloody apron, his broad perspiring face\r\nand flaming leonine mane; and, as he passed along, the men raised\r\nthemselves up and tried to stop him, each burning with a desire to\r\nsecure the next turn, anxious to be succoured and to learn his fate.\r\n\r\n\'Me, _monsieur le major_, me!\' they called. Faltering, prayerful\r\nvoices pursued him, and fumbling fingers clutched at his clothes.\r\nWithout listening to anyone, however, quite absorbed, breathing hard\r\nwith fatigue, he decided how he would proceed with his work. He talked\r\naloud, counted the men with his finger, numbered and classified\r\nthem: this one, that one, and that other one; numbers one, two, and\r\nthree; a jaw, an arm, and a thigh. Meantime, an assistant surgeon who\r\naccompanied him listened attentively, so that he might remember which\r\nmen were to be brought, and in what order, into the operating shed.\r\n\r\n\'Major,\' said Delaherche, \'there\'s a captain here, Captain Beaudoin----\'\r\n\r\n\'What! Beaudoin here!\' interrupted Bouroche; \'poor devil!\'\r\n\r\nHe posted himself in front of the wounded officer, and no doubt\r\nrealised the gravity of the case at a glance, for without even stooping\r\nto examine the damaged leg he immediately added: \'All right! he shall\r\nbe brought to me at once, as soon as I\'ve performed the operation which\r\nis being prepared.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he went back into the outhouse, followed by Delaherche, who\r\ndid not want to lose sight of him for fear lest he should forget his\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nThe disarticulation of a shoulder-joint in accordance with\r\nLisfranc\'s[31] method was this time in question, a pretty operation\r\nas surgeons say, something elegant and prompt, lasting barely forty\r\nseconds from first to last. The patient was already being chloroformed,\r\nwhilst an assistant caught hold of his shoulder with both hands; the\r\nfingers under the arm-pit, the thumbs up above. Thereupon Bouroche, who\r\nwas armed with a large, long knife, called out, \'Set him up,\' grasped\r\nthe deltoid, transfixed the arm and severed the muscle; then stepping\r\nback, he detached the articulation at one stroke, and the arm fell,\r\namputated in three movements. The assistant had immediately stopped the\r\naxillary artery with his thumbs. \'Lay him down again,\' said Bouroche,\r\nlaughing involuntarily as he proceeded with the ligation, for the\r\noperation had only taken him five-and-thirty seconds. All that now\r\nremained was to press the shreds of flesh down upon the wound like a\r\nshoulder strap. Altogether it was a pretty piece of work, notably on\r\naccount of the danger, for, by the axillary artery, a man may lose all\r\nhis blood in three minutes; besides which, the life of a patient under\r\nthe influence of chloroform is invariably imperilled when he is raised\r\nfrom a recumbent to a sitting posture.\r\n\r\nFrozen with horror. Delaherche had turned to go, but before he could\r\ndo so the arm was already lying on the table. The man who had been\r\namputated, a sturdy young peasant, emerged from his torpor and saw an\r\nattendant carrying his arm away, to throw it behind the laburnums. He\r\nhastily glanced at his shoulder, and, on seeing the bleeding stump,\r\nflew into a violent rage: \'Good heavens! that\'s a nice thing you\'ve\r\ndone!\'\r\n\r\nBouroche, who was terribly tired, did not at first reply; but at last\r\nin a good-natured way he said: \'I did it for the best, I didn\'t want\r\nyou to kick the bucket, my boy. Besides, I asked you beforehand if\r\nyou\'d have it off, and you said "yes."\'\r\n\r\n\'I said "yes"? I said "yes"? Did I know what you meant?\' Then, as his\r\nanger fell, he began shedding bitter tears, and gasped: \'What shall I\r\never be able to do with myself now?\'\r\n\r\nHe was carried back to the litter of straw; the oilcloth and the table\r\nwere violently washed; and the pailfuls of red water which were again\r\nflung across the lawn made the white bed of China asters quite bloody.\r\n\r\nDelaherche, however, felt astonished at still hearing the cannonade.\r\nWhy did it not stop? Rose\'s table-cloth must now be hoisted over the\r\ncitadel. And yet it seemed as if the fire of the Prussian batteries\r\nwere increasing in intensity. Such was the uproar, that one could no\r\nlonger hear oneself; the commotion shook the least nervous from head to\r\nfoot, amid growing anguish. These shocks which tore away the heart were\r\nsuited neither to amputators nor amputated. They upset, fevered the\r\nentire ambulance to the point of exasperation.\r\n\r\n\'But it was all finished; so why do they keep on firing?\' exclaimed\r\nDelaherche, listening anxiously, and imagining every second that the\r\nshot he heard would be the last.\r\n\r\nThen, as he turned to remind Bouroche of the captain, he was astonished\r\nto find the surgeon lying on his stomach atop of a truss of straw,\r\nwith both arms bared to the shoulders and plunged in a couple of pails\r\nfull of icy water. In this fashion was the major refreshing himself,\r\nfor he was both physically and morally worn out, crushed, overwhelmed\r\nby immense sadness and distress, experiencing one of those momentary\r\nagonies of the practitioner who realises his powerlessness. Bouroche,\r\nalbeit, was a sturdy fellow, hard-skinned and stout-hearted. But the\r\nthought \'what avails it?\' had flashed across his mind, and filled him\r\nwith sorrow. He had been suddenly paralysed by the consciousness that\r\nhe would never be able to accomplish everything; that it was not given\r\nto him to do so. So of what use was it all, since Death was bound to\r\nprove the stronger?\r\n\r\nTwo attendants came up, with Captain Beaudoin on a stretcher. \'Here\'s\r\nthe captain, major,\' Delaherche ventured to say.\r\n\r\nBouroche opened his eyes, took his arms out of the pails, shook them,\r\nand wiped them in the straw. Then, raising himself on his knees: \'Yes,\r\ndash it!\' said he; \'come, come, the day is by no means over.\'\r\n\r\nHe was already getting up, shaking his lion-like head and tawny hair;\r\nset erect again by habit and imperious discipline. Gilberte and Madame\r\nDelaherche had followed the stretcher, and when the captain had been\r\nlaid on the oilcloth-covered mattress, they still lingered there,\r\nstanding just a few paces away.\r\n\r\n\'Good! it\'s above the right ankle,\' said Bouroche, who talked a good\r\ndeal by way of occupying the minds of his patients. \'That\'s not so bad.\r\nWounds there can be cured--I\'ll examine it.\'\r\n\r\nIt was evident, however, that Beaudoin\'s state of torpor preoccupied\r\nhim. On looking at the provisional dressing--a simple band tightened\r\nand secured to the trousers by a bayonet sheath--he began growling\r\nbetween his teeth, asking what fool was responsible for that. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, he became silent again. The truth had just dawned upon\r\nhim. During the transport, no doubt--in the landau packed full of\r\nwounded--the bandage had loosened and slipped, ceasing to compress the\r\nwound, so that an abundant loss of blood had ensued.\r\n\r\nGuessing this, Bouroche--by way of venting his feelings--flew into a\r\nviolent rage with an attendant who was helping him. \'You ---- dawdler;\r\nmake haste with that cutting,\' he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s trousers and drawers, shoe and sock were thereupon cut\r\nopen. First the leg, then the foot appeared; their wan nudity stained\r\nwith blood. And above the ankle there was a frightful hole, into which\r\na splinter of a shell had driven a shred of red cloth. A swelling of\r\nlacerated flesh, a protuberance of the muscle emerged in a pulpous\r\nstate from the wound.\r\n\r\nGilberte had to lean against one of the posts supporting the roof of\r\nthe shed. Ah! that flesh, that flesh so soft and white, now bleeding\r\nand mangled! Despite her horror, she could not turn her eyes away from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\'The devil!\' said Bouroche, \'they\'ve put you in a nice state!\'\r\n\r\nHe felt the foot and found it cold; no beat of the pulse could be\r\ndetected. His face had become very grave, and his lips were drawn down,\r\nas always happened when he found himself confronted by a disquieting\r\ncase. \'The devil!\' he repeated, \'that foot\'s bad.\'\r\n\r\nRoused from his somnolence by anxiety, the captain looked at him,\r\nwaiting; and ended by saying: \'Do you think so, major?\'\r\n\r\nAlthough amputation might be a matter of necessity, Bouroche\'s\r\nsystem was never to ask a wounded man point-blank for the customary\r\nauthorisation. He preferred that the sufferer should, of his own\r\naccord, resign himself to the operation. \'A bad foot,\' he muttered, as\r\nif he were thinking aloud; \'we can\'t save it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, major, to the point,\' resumed Beaudoin, nervously; \'what do you\r\nthink of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you are a brave man, captain, and that you are going to let me\r\ndo what must be done.\'\r\n\r\nBeaudoin\'s paling eyes were dimmed by a kind of ruddy smoke. He had\r\nunderstood. However, despite the insupportable fear that was throttling\r\nhim, he replied simply, like a gallant man: \'Do it, major.\'\r\n\r\nThe preparations did not take long. The assistant, who had already\r\ndipped the napkin in chloroform, immediately applied it to the\r\npatient\'s nose. Then, at the moment when the slight agitation preceding\r\nan\xc3\xa6sthesia manifested itself, two attendants slid the captain along the\r\nmattress so that his legs might project beyond it; and, whilst one of\r\nthem held up the left leg, an assistant-surgeon, seizing hold of the\r\nright one, grasped it tightly with both hands, at the origin of the\r\nthigh, for the purpose of compressing the artery.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Bouroche approach with his narrow blade, Gilberte felt she\r\ncould endure no more: \'No, no, it\'s too dreadful!\'\r\n\r\nShe felt faint, and leant upon the arm which Madame Delaherche held out\r\nto prevent her from falling.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you stop, then?\'\r\n\r\nHowever, they both remained there; averting their heads, it is true,\r\nnot wishing to see any more, and standing motionless and trembling,\r\npressed close to one another, despite the little affection there was\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nAt no other time that day did the cannon thunder so loudly as it\r\nthundered now. It was three o\'clock, and Delaherche, disappointed,\r\nexasperated, declared the uproar to be incomprehensible. Far from\r\nceasing their fire, the German batteries were redoubling it. Why? What\r\ncould be taking place? It was a hellish bombardment; the ground shook,\r\nthe very atmosphere seemed on fire. The belt of artillery encircling\r\nSedan, the eight hundred guns of the German armies, were firing\r\nsimultaneously, ravaging all the surrounding fields with continuous\r\nthunderbolts; and a couple of hours of this converging fire directed\r\ncentreward from all the encompassing heights would suffice to burn\r\nand pulverise the town. The situation was serious, for shells were\r\nagain beginning to fall on the houses. The detonations were heard more\r\nand more frequently. One shell burst in the Rue des Voyards. Another\r\nchipped a corner off the high factory chimney, and some fragments of\r\nbrick and cement fell just outside the operating-shed.\r\n\r\nBouroche raised his eyes, and growled: \'Do they want to finish off our\r\nwounded? That row is insupportable.\'\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an attendant had caught hold of the captain\'s wounded\r\nleg by the foot, and by a rapid circular incision the major now cut\r\nthe skin below the knee, at a couple of inches from the point where he\r\ncontemplated sawing the bone. Then, with the same narrow knife, which\r\nhe did not exchange for another, since he wished to accomplish the\r\noperation as speedily as possible, he detached the skin, raising it up\r\nall round, much in the fashion in which one peels an orange. Just as he\r\nwas about to sever the muscles, however, an attendant approached him\r\nand whispered in his ear: \'Number two has dropped off.\'\r\n\r\nSo frightful was the din that the major could not hear. \'Speak louder,\r\nwill you? My ears are tingling with that cursed cannonade.\'\r\n\r\n\'Number two has dropped off.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who\'s number two?\'\r\n\r\n\'The arm.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! all right! Well, you\'ll bring me number three--the jaw.\'\r\n\r\nThen, with extraordinary skill, he at one stroke severed the muscles\r\nto the bone. He bared the tibia and the fibula, and, as a support,\r\npassed the three-tail compress between them. Then, with a single kerf\r\nof the saw, he lopped them off, the foot remaining in the hands of the\r\nattendant who was holding it.\r\n\r\nBut little blood flowed, thanks to the pressure which the assistant\r\nwas maintaining higher up, around the thigh; and the ligation of the\r\nthree arteries was swiftly accomplished. Nevertheless, the major shook\r\nhis head; and when his assistant had taken his hands away, he examined\r\nhis work, and, certain that his patient could not as yet hear him,\r\nmuttered: \'It\'s a nuisance; no blood comes from the little arteries.\'\r\n\r\nThen, with a wave of the hand, he completed his diagnosis. Another poor\r\ndevil done for! Again upon his perspiring face appeared that expression\r\nof immense fatigue and sadness, that despair summed up in the words:\r\n\'Of what use is it?\' And, indeed, what did his labour avail since\r\nhe did not succeed in saving four out of ten? However, he wiped his\r\nforehead, and having turned down the flesh of the captain\'s stump, he\r\nbegan to sew the three sutures.\r\n\r\nGilberte had just turned round, Delaherche having told her that it was\r\nfinished, and that she could look. However, she caught sight of the\r\ncaptain\'s foot as the attendant carried it off into the garden. The\r\ncharnel-place was now becoming more and more crowded; two more corpses\r\nwere lying there, one with the mouth wide open and black, looking as\r\nthough it were still howling; the other shrunk by an abominable agony,\r\nreduced to the size of a puny, deformed child. The annoyance was that\r\nthe pile of remnants was now stretching into the path near by. The\r\nattendant hesitated for a moment as to where he might fitly deposit the\r\ncaptain\'s foot, but at last he made up his mind to throw it on the heap.\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s all finished,\' said the major to Beaudoin, who was being\r\nroused; \'you\'re out of danger.\'\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s, however, was not that gladsome awakening which follows\r\nupon successful operations. He slightly raised himself, but fell back\r\nstammering in a feeble voice: \'Thanks, major. I would rather it were\r\nall over.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, he could feel the smart of the spirit dressing. And just as\r\nthe stretcher was being brought near, so that he might be carried back\r\nto his mattress, a terrible detonation shook the entire factory; a\r\nshell had burst behind the shed, in the little yard where the pump was.\r\nSeveral window-panes were smashed to pieces, and thick smoke poured\r\ninto the ambulance. In the drying-room, panic raised the wounded up on\r\ntheir straw pallets, and all cried out in terror, and all were eager to\r\nflee.\r\n\r\nDelaherche rushed off in distraction to ascertain the extent of the\r\ndamage. Were they now going to demolish his house, set it on fire? What\r\ncould be happening? Why did they keep on firing when the Emperor wanted\r\nthem to stop?\r\n\r\n\'D----n! bestir yourselves!\' shouted Bouroche to his attendants, whom\r\nterror rooted to the spot. \'Wash the table; go and fetch me number\r\nthree!\'\r\n\r\nThe table was washed, and once again the pailfuls of red water were\r\nflung across the lawn. The bed of China asters had become a bloody\r\nhash--the chopped stalks and flowers were swimming in blood. And now,\r\nby way of relaxation, the major, having had number three brought to\r\nhim, began searching for a bullet which, after shattering the inferior\r\nmaxilla, must have lodged itself under the tongue. A deal of blood was\r\nflowing, and made his fingers quite sticky.\r\n\r\nCaptain Beaudoin was again lying on his mattress in the drying-room.\r\nGilberte and her mother-in-law had followed the stretcher, and\r\nDelaherche himself came to chat for a moment, despite his agitation.\r\n\'Keep quiet and rest yourself, captain,\' said he; \'we will have a room\r\ngot ready, you shall stay with us.\'\r\n\r\nAmid his prostration, however, the captain awoke to a short interval\r\nof lucidity. \'No,\' said he, \'I really think I am going to die.\' And he\r\ngazed at the three of them, with dilated eyes full of the fear of death.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! what are you saying, captain?\' murmured Gilberte, forcing herself\r\nto smile, though she felt quite frozen. \'You will be up again in a\r\nmonth\'s time.\'\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, however; and now he looked at her alone, with\r\nimmense regret for life in his eyes, quailing at the thought that he\r\nmust go off like that, before his time, and without having exhausted\r\nthe delights of existence.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m going to die, I\'m going to die. Ah! it\'s awful.\'\r\n\r\nThen all at once his glance fell on his soiled, torn uniform and\r\nblack hands, and it made him uncomfortable to find himself in such a\r\nhorrid state in the presence of ladies. He felt ashamed, too, of his\r\nself-abandonment; and the thought that he was wanting in smartness\r\nrestored to him a deal of bravery. \'Well,\' he managed to resume, in a\r\ngay voice, \'if I am to die, I should at least like to die with my hands\r\nclean. Would you have the kindness, madame, to dip a towel in some\r\nwater and give it me?\'\r\n\r\nGilberte darted off, and on returning with the towel, insisted upon\r\ncleaning his hands for him. From that moment he displayed very great\r\ncourage, desirous as he was that his end might be that of a well-bred\r\nman. Delaherche encouraged him, and assisted his wife in arranging\r\nhim in a becoming manner. And in presence of this dying man, on\r\nseeing husband and wife so assiduous in their attentions, old Madame\r\nDelaherche felt her rancour pass away. Once more would she keep silent,\r\nshe who knew and had sworn to tell her son everything. But why plunge\r\nthe house in affliction, since death was carrying away the sin?\r\n\r\nThe end came almost immediately. Captain Beaudoin, growing weaker and\r\nweaker, again fell into a state of prostration. An icy sweat streamed\r\nfrom his forehead and his neck. For a moment he reopened his eyes, and\r\nfumbled as though he were seeking a blanket, and drawing it up close to\r\nhis chin, with a gentle, stubborn pull of his twisted hands: \'Oh! I am\r\nso cold, so very cold.\'\r\n\r\nAnd he passed away, expired without a sob, his calm, wasted face\r\nretaining an expression of infinite sadness.\r\n\r\nDelaherche did not allow the corpse to be carried to the charnel-place,\r\nbut saw to its being deposited in a coach-house; and he then tried to\r\ninduce Gilberte, who was sobbing, quite upset, to go back into the\r\nhouse. She declared, however, that she should feel too frightened\r\nif she remained alone, and that she preferred staying with her\r\nmother-in-law amid the bustle of the ambulance, which diverted her\r\nthoughts. She was already running off to give some water to a Chasseur\r\nd\'Afrique delirious with fever, and to help dress the hand of a\r\nlittle Linesman, a recruit of twenty, who had come on foot from the\r\nbattlefield. One of his thumbs had been carried away; and as he was\r\na good-looking, comical fellow, who jested about his wound with the\r\nheedless air of a Parisian wag, she ended by getting quite lively in\r\nhis company.\r\n\r\nThe cannonade seemed to have become still more violent whilst the\r\ncaptain was dying; a second shell had fallen in the garden, cutting\r\ndown one of the centenarian trees. Moreover, a conflagration of\r\nconsiderable magnitude had broken out in the Faubourg of La Cassine,\r\nand some terror-stricken people cried out that all Sedan was burning.\r\nIt would be the end of everything if this bombardment were to continue\r\nfor any length of time with such fearful violence.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s incomprehensible. I\'m going back!\' exclaimed Delaherche, at last,\r\nquite beside himself.\r\n\r\n\'Where to?\' asked Bouroche.\r\n\r\n\'Why, to the Sub-Prefecture, to ascertain whether the Emperor\'s playing\r\nthe fool with us when he talks of hoisting the white flag.\'\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the major remained dumbfounded by this idea of the\r\nwhite flag, defeat, and capitulation, which broke upon him amid his\r\npowerlessness to save the poor mangled fellows who were being brought\r\nto him in such numbers. He made a gesture of furious despair. \'Well, go\r\nto the devil!\' he shouted; \'we are none the less done for.\'\r\n\r\nOnce outside, Delaherche experienced far greater difficulty than\r\nbefore in making his way through the groups of people, which were now\r\nmuch larger. The streets were every minute filling with the stream\r\nof disbanded soldiers. He questioned several of the officers he met,\r\nbut none of them had seen the white flag upon the citadel. At last,\r\nhowever, a colonel declared that he had espied it there for an instant;\r\nit had been taken down almost as soon as hoisted. That seemed to\r\nexplain everything; either the Germans had not perceived it, or else,\r\nseeing it appear and disappear, they had realised that the last agony\r\nwas at hand, and had thereupon redoubled their fire. Indeed, a story\r\nwas already circulating of a general who, at sight of the flag, had\r\nflown into a mad rage, had rushed upon it, and torn it down with his\r\nown hands, breaking the staff and trampling the linen under foot. And\r\nthus the Prussian batteries were still firing; the projectiles rained\r\nupon the roofs and the streets, houses were burning, and a woman had\r\njust had her head smashed, at the corner of the Place Turenne.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Sub-Prefecture, Delaherche did not find Rose in the\r\nlodge. Every door of the house was now open; the rout was beginning. He\r\nentered and went upstairs, meeting only a few scared people, none of\r\nwhom inquired his business. Whilst he was hesitating on the first-floor\r\nlanding, he came upon the young girl.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Monsieur Delaherche, matters are getting much worse,\' said she.\r\n\'There, make haste and look if you want to see the Emperor.\'\r\n\r\nA door on the left hand stood ajar, and, through the opening, one could\r\nperceive Napoleon III. who had resumed his wavering march from the\r\nchimney-piece to the window. He tramped up and down without a pause,\r\ndespite his intolerable sufferings.\r\n\r\nAn aide-de-camp had just entered the room--it was he who had carelessly\r\nleft the door ajar--and the Emperor was heard asking in a voice\r\nenervated by wretchedness: \'But why are they still firing, monsieur,\r\nwhen I have had the white flag hoisted?\'\r\n\r\nStill did he experience the same unbearable torment at sound of that\r\ncannonade which never ceased, but on the contrary increased in violence\r\nevery minute. It struck him in the heart each time that he drew near to\r\nthe window. Still more blood, still more human lives destroyed through\r\nhis fault! Each minute added more corpses to the pile, to no purpose\r\nwhatever. And, commiserative dreamer that he was, his whole being\r\nrevolted at the thought of this slaughter; and a dozen times already\r\nhe had put the same despairing question to those who entered the room:\r\n\'But why are they still firing when I have had the white flag hoisted?\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche did not manage to catch the muttered answer of the\r\naide-de-camp. Besides, the Emperor had not paused in his walk. Faint\r\nthough he felt each time that he reached the window, he yielded to\r\nthe needment of returning thither. His pallor had increased, his\r\nlong-drawn, mournful face, but imperfectly cleansed of the paint with\r\nwhich it had been brightened that morning, plainly told his agony.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a vivacious little man, in a dusty uniform, whom\r\nDelaherche recognised as General Lebrun, crossed the landing and pushed\r\nthe door open, without waiting to be announced. And the Emperor\'s\r\nanxious voice could immediately be distinguished, once more asking:\r\n\'But why, general, why are they still firing when I have had the white\r\nflag hoisted?\'\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp came out of the room and shut the door behind him, so\r\nthat Delaherche could not even hear the general\'s answer. All was blank\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' repeated Rose, \'things are getting bad, I can tell it by the\r\ngentlemen\'s faces. It\'s like my table-cloth, which I shall never see\r\nagain; some say it has been torn up. After all, it\'s the Emperor whom\r\nI pity the most, for he\'s in a worse state even than the marshal. He\r\nwould be far better in his bed than in that room, where he\'s wearing\r\nhimself out with walking.\'\r\n\r\nShe was quite affected, and her pretty, fair face expressed sincere\r\ncompassion; for which very reason Delaherche, whose Bonapartist fervour\r\nhad been sensibly cooling during the last two days, considered her\r\nrather foolish. He lingered with her downstairs, however, whilst\r\nwatching for General Lebrun\'s departure. And when the general came down\r\nhe followed him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lebrun had explained to the Emperor that if he desired to ask\r\nfor an armistice, a letter signed by the commander-in-chief of the\r\nFrench forces must be transmitted to the commander-in-chief of the\r\nGerman armies. He had then offered to write the letter in question and\r\nto start in search of General de Wimpffen, by whom it should be signed.\r\nAnd now he was carrying this letter away, and his only fear was that he\r\nmight be unable to find Wimpffen, for he did not know on what part of\r\nthe field he was. The crush by this time had become so great that he\r\nwas compelled to walk his horse through Sedan, thus enabling Delaherche\r\nto follow him as far as the M\xc3\xa9nil gate.\r\n\r\nOnce on the highway, however, General Lebrun put his horse at a gallop,\r\nand as he was approaching Balan, he was lucky enough to perceive\r\nGeneral de Wimpffen. A few minutes previously the latter had written\r\nto the Emperor: \'Sire, come and place yourself at the head of your\r\ntroops; they will esteem it an honour to open you a passage through the\r\nenemy\'s lines.\' Accordingly, at the first word of a truce he flew into\r\na furious passion. No, no! he would sign nothing; he meant to fight.\r\nIt was then half-past three o\'clock, and shortly afterwards came the\r\nlast onslaught, that heroic, despairing attempt to pierce through the\r\nBavarians by marching yet once more upon Bazeilles. To restore the\r\nspirits of the soldiers, lies were circulated along the streets of\r\nSedan and across the surrounding fields. \'Bazaine is coming up! Bazaine\r\nis coming up!\' was the cry. It was a dream that many had indulged in\r\nsince the morning, thinking, each time that the Germans unmasked a\r\nfresh battery, that the guns they heard were those of the army of Metz.\r\n\r\nSome twelve hundred men were got together, disbanded soldiers of\r\nall arms, from every corps; and along the road, swept by the enemy\'s\r\nprojectiles, the little column dashed with glorious gallantry, at the\r\ndouble-quick. It was superb at first; the men who fell did not arrest\r\nthe dash of the others, and some five hundred yards were covered\r\nwith a perfect fury of courage. But the ranks were speedily thinned,\r\nand the bravest at last fell back. What could be done indeed against\r\nsuch overwhelming numbers? This effort was but the mad temerity of a\r\ncommander who refused to be beaten. And at last General de Wimpffen\r\nfound himself alone with General Lebrun, on that road to Balan and\r\nBazeilles, which they finally had to abandon. No course now remained\r\nbut to retreat under the walls of Sedan.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had lost sight of the general, Delaherche returned in all\r\nhaste to the factory, possessed by one idea, that of again climbing\r\nto his observatory, and thence watching the course of events. He was\r\ndelayed for a moment, however, as he reached the house, for in the\r\nporch he came upon Colonel de Vineuil, who, lying in a half-fainting\r\nstate on some hay, in a market-gardener\'s tilted cart, was just then\r\narriving with his bloody boot. The colonel had stubbornly persisted\r\nin trying to rally the remnants of his regiment until the moment when\r\nhe had fallen from his horse. He was at once carried to a room on the\r\nfirst floor, and Bouroche, hastening to him, and finding he had only a\r\nsplit in the ankle, contented himself with dressing the wound, after\r\nextracting the pieces of boot-leather that had lodged in it. Then,\r\nover tasked and exasperated, he rushed downstairs again, shouting that\r\nhe would rather cut off one of his legs than continue working in that\r\ndirty fashion, without the proper supplies or the necessary assistants.\r\nAnd indeed the ambulance people no longer knew where to place the\r\nwounded; they had been obliged to lay some of them in the grass on the\r\nlawn. There were two rows of them there already, waiting and wailing\r\nin the open air, under the shells which continued raining upon Sedan.\r\nSince noon more than four hundred men had been brought to this one\r\nambulance, and in vain had Bouroche asked for surgeons--the only person\r\nsent to him was a young doctor of the town. It was impossible for him\r\nto suffice for everything; he probed, cut, sawed, and sewed, quite\r\nbeside himself, sorely distressed to find that far more work kept on\r\narriving than he could possibly cope with. Gilberte, intoxicated with\r\nhorror, sickened by the sight of so much blood and so many tears,\r\nnow remained upstairs with her uncle, the colonel, whilst old Madame\r\nDelaherche stayed below, bringing water to the feverish ones, and\r\nwiping the clammy faces of those who were in the throes of death.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the terrace up above, Delaherche had at once endeavoured\r\nto form some idea of the situation. The town had suffered less than he\r\nhad thought; there was only one conflagration, throwing up a column\r\nof dense black smoke in the Faubourg of La Cassine. At present the\r\nPalatinate fort had ceased firing, for want, no doubt, of ammunition;\r\nand only the guns of the Paris gate continued discharging a few shots,\r\nat long intervals. What, however, immediately interested him, was to\r\nfind that the white flag had again been hoisted on the keep; but,\r\nprobably, it could not be seen from the battlefield, for the firing\r\ncontinued, as intense as ever. Some neighbouring roofs prevented him\r\nfrom seeing the Balan road, so that he could not watch the movements\r\nof the troops there. However, on applying his eye to the telescope,\r\nwhich had remained in position, he again perceived the German staff on\r\nthe same spot where he had noticed it at noon. The master--the tiny\r\ntin soldier, no taller than half of one\'s little finger, in whom he\r\nfancied he could recognise the King of Prussia--was still standing\r\nin his dark uniform in advance of the other officers, most of whom,\r\nscintillating with embroidery, were lying upon the grass. Among them\r\nwere foreign officers, aides-de-camp, generals, court marshals, princes\r\nand princelets, all provided with field-glasses, with which, since\r\nearly morning, they had been surveying the agony of the French army, as\r\nthough they were at a theatre. And now the formidable drama was drawing\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\nFrom that wooded height of La Marf\xc3\xa9e King William had just beheld the\r\njunction of his troops. It was accomplished; the Third Army, under\r\nthe orders of the Crown Prince, his son, which had proceeded by way\r\nof St. Menges and Fleigneux, was taking possession of the plateau of\r\nIlly, whilst the Fourth Army, commanded by the Crown Prince of Saxony,\r\nreached the meeting place by way of Daigny and Givonne, after turning\r\nthe wood of La Garenne. Thus the Eleventh and Fifth German Corps\r\njoined hands with the Twelfth Corps and the Prussian Guard. And the\r\nsupreme effort made to break the circle at the very moment when it was\r\nclosing up, that useless but glorious charge of General Margueritte\'s\r\ndivision, had wrung an admiring exclamation from the King: \'Ah! the\r\nbrave fellows!\' Now the mathematical, inexorable encompassment was\r\ncompleted, the vice-chops had met; and at a glance the King could\r\nsurvey the immense wall of men and guns enveloping the vanquished army.\r\nOn the north the grasp pressed closer and closer home, throwing the\r\nfugitives back into Sedan under the redoubling fire of the batteries\r\nwhich fringed the horizon all around in an unbroken line. On the south\r\nBazeilles, conquered, empty, and mournful, was burning away, throwing\r\nup whirling clouds of spark-laden smoke; whilst the Bavarians, now\r\nmasters of Balan, were levelling their guns at three hundred yards\r\nfrom the gates of Sedan itself. And the other batteries, those on the\r\nleft bank at Pont-Maugis, Noyers, Fr\xc3\xa9nois, and Wadelincourt, which\r\nfor nearly twelve hours had been firing without a pause, were now\r\nthundering yet more loudly, completing the impassable belt of flames,\r\neven under the King\'s feet.\r\n\r\nSomewhat tired, however, King William laid his field-glass aside for\r\na moment, and continued examining the scene without its help. The sun\r\nwas descending obliquely towards the woods, sinking to rest in a sky of\r\nunspotted purity; it gilded the whole vast stretch of country, bathed\r\nit in so limpid a light that the smallest objects acquired remarkable\r\ndistinctness. The King could distinguish the houses of Sedan, with\r\ntheir little, black window bars, the ramparts and the fortress, all the\r\ncomplicated defensive works, clearly and sharply outlined. Then all\r\naround, scattered amid the fields, were the villages, fresh-coloured\r\nand shiny as with varnish, like the farmhouses one finds in boxes of\r\ntoys. On the left was Donchery, at the edge of the level plain; on\r\nthe right were Douzy and Carignan in the meadows. It seemed as though\r\none could count the trees of the Forest of the Ardennes, whose sea\r\nof verdure stretched away to the frontier. In the crisp light, the\r\nlazily winding Meuse looked like a river of pure gold, and the fearful\r\nblood-smeared battle, seen from this height, under the sun\'s farewell\r\nrays, became as it were a delicate piece of painting. Some corpses\r\nof cavalry soldiers, and dead horses with their bellies ripped open,\r\nscattered bright touches over the plateau of Floing. Towards the right,\r\nin the direction of Givonne the eye was amused by the scrambles of\r\nthe retreat, the vortex of running, falling black specks; whilst on\r\nthe peninsula of Iges, on the left, a Bavarian battery, whose guns\r\nlooked no bigger than lucifer matches, was served with such clock-work\r\nregularity, that it seemed like some piece of mechanism, carefully\r\nput together. And all this was victory--victory surpassing hope,\r\noverwhelming; and the King felt no remorse whatever as he looked down\r\nupon all those tiny corpses, those thousands of men occupying less\r\nspace than the dust of the roads, that immense valley where neither the\r\nconflagrations of Bazeilles, the massacres of Illy nor the anguish of\r\nSedan could prevent impassive nature from remaining beauteous in this,\r\nthe serene close of a lovely day.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, Delaherche perceived a French general, clad in a\r\nblue tunic and mounted on a black horse, who was ascending the slopes\r\nof La Marf\xc3\xa9e preceded by a Hussar carrying a flag of truce. It was\r\nGeneral Reille, charged by the Emperor to deliver this letter to the\r\nKing of Prussia:--\r\n\r\n \'Sir, my Brother,--Not having been able to die in the midst of my\r\n troops, it only remains for me to place my sword in your Majesty\'s\r\n hands.--I am your Majesty\'s good Brother,\r\n\r\n \'Napoleon.\'\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to stop the slaughter, since he was no longer the\r\nmaster, the Emperor delivered himself up, hoping that he might thereby\r\nsoften the victor. And Delaherche saw General Reille, who was unarmed\r\nand carried merely a riding-whip, rein in his horse at ten paces from\r\nthe King, alight, and then step forward and deliver the letter. The\r\nsun was sinking in a far-spreading, roseate glow; the King seated\r\nhimself on a chair, rested his arm on the back of another one held by a\r\nsecretary, and replied that he accepted the sword, pending the despatch\r\nof an officer, empowered to treat for the capitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE ROUT--THE FIGHT AT THE HERMITAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom all the lost positions around Sedan, from Floing, from the plateau\r\nof Illy, the wood of La Garenne, the valley of the Givonne, and the\r\nroad to Bazeilles, a stream of men, horses, and cannon was now flowing\r\nback in terror, rolling along towards the town. This stronghold, which\r\nthe commanders of the army had so disastrously selected as their\r\nbase, was proving a balefully tempting spot, an inviting refuge for\r\nthe runaways, a place of seeming safety whither the bravest allowed\r\nthemselves to be allured, in the demoralisation and panic overtaking\r\nall. They imagined that behind those ramparts yonder, they would at\r\nlast escape from that terrible artillery which had been growling for\r\nnearly twelve hours; and there was no discriminative capacity, no\r\nreasoning faculty left among them; the animal carried away the man, it\r\nwas the madness of instinct, galloping off and seeking its hole, to\r\nhide underground and sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice, whilst bathing Jean\'s face with cool water, at the foot\r\nof the little wall, at last saw him open his eyes again, he raised an\r\nexclamation of delight: \'Ah! my poor fellow, I thought you were done\r\nfor! And I don\'t say it to reproach you, but you are _that_ heavy!\'\r\n\r\nJean, still dazed, seemed to be awaking from a dream. Then he must have\r\nunderstood and have remembered everything, for two big tears rolled\r\ndown his cheeks. So that weak fellow Maurice, whom he loved and tended\r\nlike a child, had, in the enthusiasm of his friendship, found arms\r\nstrong enough to carry him thither.\r\n\r\n\'Let me just look at your nob,\' said Maurice.\r\n\r\nThe wound proved to be scarcely anything, a mere scratch of the scalp,\r\nbut it had bled profusely. The hair, glued together by the blood, now\r\nserved the purpose of a pledget, and Maurice took good care not to damp\r\nit, for fear of reopening the sore.\r\n\r\n\'There, you are clean now,\' he added, \'you look like a human being\r\nagain. Wait a bit, here\'s a cap.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, picking up the _k\xc3\xa9pi_ of a dead soldier which was lying\r\nbeside him, he placed it carefully on Jean\'s head: \'It\'s just your\r\nsize,\' said he. \'Now if you can walk we shall be proper.\'\r\n\r\nJean rose up and shook his head to make sure that it was firm. He\r\nonly felt a slight heaviness, and that he could very well endure.\r\nThen, carried away by emotion, like the man of simple heart he was, he\r\ncaught Maurice in his arms, and, almost smothering him, pressed him\r\nto his breast. \'Oh, my dear little fellow, my dear little fellow,\' he\r\nrepeated; it was all that he could say.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians were coming up, however, and they ought not to dawdle\r\nbehind that wall. Lieutenant Rochas was already beating a retreat with\r\nhis few men, protecting the colours, which the sub-lieutenant still\r\ncarried, rolled around their shaft. Lapoulle, being very tall, was\r\nable to rise on tip-toe and fire a few more shots over the coping of\r\nthe wall; but Pache carried his chassepot slung over his shoulder,\r\nopining, no doubt, that he had done quite enough work that day, and\r\nought now to have something to eat and go to bed. Bending double, Jean\r\nand Maurice made haste to join the others. There was no lack either of\r\nguns or cartridges; one merely had to stoop to pick them up. So they\r\nagain armed themselves, their knapsacks, rifles, and pouches having\r\nbeen abandoned over yonder, when Maurice had been obliged to hoist Jean\r\nupon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe wall stretched as far as the wood of La Garenne, and the little\r\nband, fancying itself saved, promptly threw itself behind a farmhouse,\r\nwhence it reached the trees. \'Ah!\' said Rochas, who retained all his\r\nfine, unshakable confidence, \'we\'ll just draw breath here for a moment,\r\nbefore resuming the offensive.\'\r\n\r\nAt the first steps they took, however, they all felt that they were\r\nentering a hellish place; still, they could not fall back--whatever\r\nthe danger, they must needs cross that wood, through which lay their\r\nonly line of retreat. And it had become a most fearful wood, a wood of\r\ndespair and death. Realising that some of the French troops must be\r\nretiring through it, the Prussians were riddling it with bullets, and\r\ncovering it with shells. Lashed, as it were, by a tempest, it shook and\r\nhowled amid the shattering of its branches. The shells cut down the\r\ntrees, the bullets brought down the leaves in showers, plaintive voices\r\nseemed to issue from the split trunks, and sobs fell with the sap-laden\r\nboughs. It was like the awful agony of a chained multitude, the terror\r\nand wailing of thousands of beings rooted to the soil and unable to\r\nflee from the storm of lead and iron. Never was plaint of anguish more\r\nintense than in that bombarded forest.\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean, who had joined their comrades, at once felt\r\nfrightened. They were making their way through full-grown trees and\r\nthere was space to run, but the bullets whizzed past them every second,\r\nwildly ricocheting hither and thither, so that, as they glided from\r\ntrunk to trunk, they could not tell from which side danger might come.\r\nTwo men were killed, struck both in front and behind. A venerable oak,\r\nwhose trunk was smashed by a shell, fell across Maurice\'s path with\r\nthe tragic majesty of a hero, crushing all around it. And just as the\r\nyoung fellow was springing back, a colossal beech tree, which another\r\nshell had discrowned, snapped and sank to the ground, like some lofty\r\ncathedral pillar. Whither could they flee? On which side direct their\r\nsteps? There were but toppling branches all around them; it seemed as\r\nthough they were in some vast edifice that threatened ruin, and the\r\nceilings of whose halls, following one upon another, were for ever and\r\never falling. And when they had sprung into a plantation to escape\r\nbeing crushed by the big trees, Jean narrowly missed being cut in half\r\nby a shell, which fortunately failed to explode. They were now unable\r\nto make way amid the inextricable multitude of shrubs and saplings.\r\nThe slender stems detained them by the shoulders, the long grass\r\ntwined around their ankles, sudden walls of brambles brought them to\r\na standstill; whilst all around them flew the foliage detached by the\r\ngiant scythe which was mowing down the wood. Another man, killed beside\r\nthem by a bullet which penetrated his forehead, remained erect, caught\r\nbetween two young birches; and a score of times, whilst imprisoned in\r\nthis plantation, they felt death brush them as it passed.\r\n\r\n\'Curse it!\' said Maurice, \'we shall never get out of it.\'\r\n\r\nHe was livid, shuddering again; and even Jean, the brave fellow, who in\r\nthe morning had inspirited him, was now paling and feeling icy cold. It\r\nwas fear--horrible, contagious, irresistible fear. Again did they feel\r\nan ardent thirst burning them, an unbearable dryness of the mouth and\r\na contraction of the throat, of painful, strangulating violence. They\r\nexperienced, too, a most uncomfortable sensation, with nausea in the\r\npit of the stomach, whilst innumerable pins seemed to be pricking their\r\nlegs. And amid these purely physical symptoms of fear, with the grasp\r\nof fright pressing tightly on their brows, they saw thousands of black\r\nspecks flit past them, as though they were indeed able to distinguish\r\nthe flying cloud of bullets.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! what cursed luck!\' stammered Jean. \'It\'s horribly vexing to be\r\nhere, getting our skulls cracked for others, when they are somewhere\r\nelse, quietly smoking their pipes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, why should it be I rather than another?\' added Maurice,\r\ndistracted and haggard. This was the rebellion of self, the egotistical\r\nrage of the individual unwilling to sacrifice himself and die for the\r\nsake of the species.\r\n\r\n\'And besides,\' resumed Jean, \'if one only knew the reason of it, if it\r\nwere at all likely to be of any use.\' And then raising his eyes and\r\nlooking at the sky, he added: \'That horrid sun, too, won\'t make up its\r\nmind to skedaddle! When it has set and night comes there will perhaps\r\nbe an end of the fighting.\'\r\n\r\nUnable to tell what o\'clock it was, having in fact lost all\r\nconsciousness of time, he had for a long while already been watching\r\nthe slow decline of the orb, whose course seemed almost to have been\r\nstayed, for it was still and ever hanging over yonder, above the woods\r\non the left bank. And this longing for the sunset was not cowardice,\r\nbut rather an imperious, growing needment to cease hearing the shells\r\nand the bullets, to go off elsewhere, bury oneself in the ground, and\r\nplunge into oblivion. Were it not for fear of the world, for the vain\r\nglory of distinguishing oneself in presence of one\'s comrades, a man\r\nwould ofttimes lose his head, and despite himself hurry away at a\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nHowever, Maurice and Jean were now again growing accustomed to their\r\nperil; and amidst their utter distraction there came to them a kind of\r\nunconsciousness and intoxication which was bravery. They ended by no\r\nlonger trying to hasten through that accursed wood. Horrors had yet\r\nincreased among that people of bombarded trees, now falling upon all\r\nsides like giant sentries killed at their posts. In the delicious,\r\nsubdued, greeny light under the foliage, in the depths of all the\r\nmysterious shelter-places carpeted with moss, the brutal blast of death\r\nwas ever blowing. The lonely springs were violated; the dying moaned\r\neven in the hidden nooks where only lovers hitherto had strayed. One\r\nman, whose chest was perforated by a bullet, had just time enough to\r\ncry \'Hit!\' as he fell dying, face downward, on the sward. Another,\r\nboth of whose legs had been broken by a shell, continued laughing,\r\nunconscious of his wound, thinking, in fact, that he had merely\r\nstumbled against a tree root. Others, with their limbs pitted, mortally\r\nstricken, continued speaking and running for several yards before they\r\nfell to the ground in a sudden convulsion. At the first moment the\r\ndeepest wounds were scarcely felt, and it was only afterwards that the\r\nfrightful sufferings began, bursting forth with lamentation and tears.\r\n\r\nAh! the traitorous wood, the massacred forest, which, amid all the\r\nsobbing of the dying trees, filled, little by little, with the howling\r\nanguish of the wounded. At the foot of an oak tree, Maurice and Jean\r\nperceived a Zouave, who, with his intestines escaping from a ghastly\r\nwound, was raising a continuous roar, like a dying wild beast. Farther\r\non, there was another one--on fire; his blue sash was burning, the\r\nflame was rising and singeing his beard, whilst he shed big tears,\r\nunable to move because his spine was broken. Then there was a captain\r\nwhose left arm was torn off, and whose right side was laid open to\r\nthe thigh, and who, stretched on his stomach, dragged himself along\r\nupon an elbow, begging all those who passed, in a shrill, horribly\r\nsupplicating voice, to have the compassion to despatch him. And there\r\nwere others and others still, all suffering abominably, strewing the\r\ngrassy paths in such numbers that it was necessary to be careful lest\r\none should tread upon them in passing. The dead, the wounded, no longer\r\ncounted, however. The comrade who fell was abandoned, forgotten. Not a\r\nglance even was given behind. \'Twas fate. Another\'s turn next; perhaps,\r\nindeed, one\'s own!\r\n\r\nAll at once, as they were at last reaching the verge of the wood, a\r\ncall resounded: \'Help!\' The sub-lieutenant carrying the colours had\r\njust been struck by a bullet in the left lung. He had fallen, spitting\r\nforth the blood that had gushed into his mouth; and seeing that nobody\r\nstopped, he found strength to call \'Help!\' again, and to add, \'The\r\ncolours!\'\r\n\r\nRochas, darting back, seized hold of the flag, the shaft of which was\r\nbroken, and bounded away with it; whilst the sub-lieutenant, his speech\r\nthickened by the bloody froth filling his mouth, muttered: \'I\'m done\r\nfor, but no matter--save the colours!\'\r\n\r\nAnd he remained alone, writhing on the moss in that delicious sylvan\r\nnook, tearing up the grass with his convulsive hands, whilst his chest\r\nheaved with a frightful rattle which lasted for long hours.\r\n\r\nAt last they were out of that fearful wood. Besides Jean and Maurice,\r\nthe only remaining men of the little band were Lieutenant Rochas,\r\nPache, and Lapoulle. Bugler Gaude, who had been lost to view, suddenly\r\nsprang out of a thicket, however, and with his bugle dangling from his\r\nshoulder, ran on to join his comrades. And the survivors were immensely\r\nrelieved to find themselves again in the open country where they could\r\nbreathe at their ease. The whistling of the bullets had ceased, and no\r\nshells fell on this side of the valley.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards they heard some one swearing violently,\r\nand ahead of them, in front of a farm gate, they perceived an\r\nangry general, mounted on a horse steaming with sweat. It was\r\nBourgain-Desfeuilles, the commander of their brigade, who like\r\nthemselves was covered with dust and appeared overcome with fatigue.\r\nThat red, fat face of his--the face of a jolly companion--expressed the\r\nexasperation he felt at the disaster which he looked upon as a personal\r\nmischance. His men had not seen him since the morning. He had doubtless\r\nlost himself on the battlefield, galloping hither and thither in search\r\nof the remnants of his brigade, quite capable by the way of getting\r\nhimself killed in his rage against those Prussian batteries which were\r\nsweeping away not only the Empire, but also his own fortune, high in\r\nfavour as he was at the Tuileries.\r\n\r\n\'Thunder!\' he shouted. \'Isn\'t there anyone left, then? Can\'t a man even\r\nget any information in this cursed place?\'\r\n\r\nThe farmer and his family must have fled into the depths of the\r\nArdennes. At last, however, an aged woman appeared at the gate, some\r\nold servant whose legs, almost past service, had kept her there.\r\n\r\n\'Eh, mother, here!\' shouted the general. \'Where\'s Belgium?\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with an expression of stupor, as though she did not\r\nunderstand him. Then, casting all restraint aside, and forgetting he\r\nwas talking to a peasant woman, he shouted that for his own part he\r\ndidn\'t intend to be caught like a rat in a trap by returning to Sedan,\r\nbut meant to sling his hook across the frontier at the double-quick.\r\nSome soldiers had drawn near to him and were listening.\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s no longer possible to get through, general,\' said a sergeant.\r\n\'There are Prussians all around. This morning was the time to slope.\'\r\n\r\nStories were, indeed, already circulating of companies, separated\r\nfrom their regiments, which, without intending it, had got across the\r\nfrontier, and of others too which, later on, had even succeeded in\r\npiercing the enemy\'s lines before the junction of the German armies was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nQuite beside himself, the general shrugged his shoulders. \'Come!\' said\r\nhe, \'can\'t one cut through anything with dare-devils like you? I\'ll\r\nfind another fifty brave fellows willing to risk their skins.\' And\r\nagain turning towards the old peasant woman: \'Eh! thunder!\' he cried,\r\n\'just answer, will you, where\'s Belgium?\'\r\n\r\nThis time she understood him, and pointed towards the forests with her\r\nshrivelled hand: \'Over there, over there!\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh? What do you say? Those houses at the end of the fields?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, much farther than that, much farther away! Over yonder, right over\r\nyonder!\'\r\n\r\nThe general was stifling with rage. \'\'Pon my word, this wretched place\r\nis disgusting! A man can never tell where he is! Belgium was quite\r\nclose by, and we were afraid of tumbling into it unawares, and now\r\nthat we want to get there, it\'s gone to the devil! No, no, this is\r\naltogether too much, they can take me, and do what they like with me\r\nfor all I care. I\'m off to bed.\' And, urging on his horse, leaping in\r\nthe saddle like a wine-skin inflated by a blast of anger, he galloped\r\noff in the direction of Sedan.\r\n\r\nThe road turned, and they descended into the Fond de Givonne,[32]\r\na suburb of the town, shut in by hills, where the road in climbing\r\ntowards the woods was skirted by little houses and gardens. Such a\r\nstream of fugitives now crowded it that Lieutenant Rochas soon found\r\nhimself blockaded with Pache, Lapoulle, and Gaude, under the walls\r\nof a tavern, at the corner of a crossway. Jean and Maurice had some\r\ntrouble in joining them. And greatly were they surprised on hearing\r\na drunkard\'s husky voice suddenly calling to them: \'Hallo! here\'s a\r\nmeeting! Eh, you fellows! What a meeting to be sure!\'\r\n\r\nOn looking round they recognised Chouteau, who was leaning out of one\r\nof the ground-floor windows of the tavern. He was very drunk, and\r\nbetween a couple of hiccoughs he continued: \'Don\'t stand on ceremony\r\nif you are thirsty. There\'s still a drop left for friends.\' And then,\r\nwaving his hand over his shoulder, he called some one from the other\r\nend of the room: \'Make haste, you lazybones. Give these gentlemen\r\nsomething to drink.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Loubet made his appearance, grinning, and waving a bottle\r\nof wine in either hand. He was less intoxicated than his comrade,\r\nand, with the nasal twang of the \'coco\'[33] vendors perambulating the\r\nstreets on a public holiday, he cried, like the Parisian wag he was:\r\n\'Nice and cool! nice and cool! who\'ll have a drink!\'\r\n\r\nHe and Chouteau had not been seen by their comrades since they had gone\r\noff under the pretence of carrying Sergeant Sapin to the ambulance.\r\nThey had no doubt wandered and lounged about, carefully avoiding the\r\nspots where the shells were falling, till they had finally stranded\r\nin that tavern and helped to pillage it. Lieutenant Rochas was quite\r\nindignant: \'Wait a bit, you bandits!\' he shouted, \'I\'ll teach you to\r\nguzzle while we others are risking our skins!\'\r\n\r\nChouteau, however, would have none of his reprimand. \'Just remember,\r\nyou old lunatic,\' said he, \'that there are no lieutenants left now; we\r\nare all free men! Haven\'t the Prussians licked you enough--do you want\r\nanother dose, eh?\'\r\n\r\nRochas had to be held back, such was his eagerness to smash Chouteau\'s\r\nhead. Loubet, with the bottles under his arms, endeavoured to make\r\npeace: \'Nonsense!\' said he, \'we mustn\'t eat one another, we are all\r\nbrothers.\' And catching sight of his comrades, Lapoulle and Pache, he\r\nadded: \'Don\'t be idiots, you fellows, come in and rinse your throats.\'\r\n\r\nLapoulle hesitated for a moment, dimly conscious that it was wrong to\r\ngo and make merry whilst so many poor devils had only their tongues to\r\nswallow. But then he was so thoroughly tired out, so exhausted too with\r\nhunger and thirst. All at once he made up his mind, and without a word\r\nsprang into the tavern, pushing Pache, also silent and sorely tempted,\r\nbefore him. Pache yielded, and neither of them reappeared.\r\n\r\n\'The brigands!\' repeated Rochas; \'they all ought to be shot.\'\r\n\r\nHe now only had Jean, Maurice, and Gaude with him, and despite their\r\nefforts to resist the impetus, they were all four gradually drifting\r\nalong with the torrent of fugitives, which stretched across the full\r\nbreadth of the road. They already found themselves far away from the\r\ntavern. It was the rout rolling towards the ditches of Sedan in a muddy\r\nstream, like a heap of soil and stones which a storm, in sweeping\r\nthe hillsides, drags down into the valleys. From all the surrounding\r\nplateaux, by every slope and every fold, by the Floing road, by way of\r\nPierremont, by way of the cemetery, by way of the Champ de Mars, as\r\nwell as by the Fond de Givonne, the same mob was pouring along with\r\nan ever-accelerated gallop of panic. And how could one reproach these\r\nwretched men, who, for twelve hours, had been waiting motionless\r\nunder the death-dealing artillery of an invisible foe, against which\r\nthey could do nothing? Now, moreover, the batteries assailed them in\r\nfront, in flank, and in the rear, the fires converged more and more as\r\nthe army retreated upon the town; the men were struck down in heaps,\r\ncut into a mass of mincemeat in the traitorous hole whither they were\r\nswept. A few regiments of the Seventh Corps, notably on the side of\r\nFloing, were falling back in fairly good order. But there were no\r\nlonger ranks or leaders in the Fond de Givonne; the men scrambled and\r\nhustled one another distractedly; among them were remnants of every\r\narm, Zouaves, Turcos, Chasseurs, Linesmen, mostly unarmed, and all\r\nwith torn, soiled uniforms, black hands, black faces, bloodshot eyes\r\nstarting from their sockets, and swollen mouths, tumefied through\r\nhaving yelled so many oaths. Now and again a riderless charger rushed\r\nalong at a gallop, throwing men to the ground and penetrating the\r\nmob with a long eddy of fright. Then guns passed by at breakneck\r\nspeed--disbanded batteries whose artillerymen, carried away as it were\r\nby intoxication, raised no warning shout, but pursued their course\r\ncrushing everything in their way. And yet the flock-like tramping did\r\nnot cease; it was a compact defiling, shoulder to shoulder; a flight\r\n_en masse_, every break in which was immediately filled up, in the\r\nuniversal, instinctive eagerness to arrive yonder and secure a shelter\r\nbehind a wall.\r\n\r\nAgain did Jean raise his head and turn towards the west. The sunrays\r\nwere still burning the men\'s perspiring faces through the thick dust\r\nwhich was raised by their tramping feet. It was a lovely day, the sky\r\nwas divinely blue. \'What a beastly nuisance!\' repeated Jean; \'that\r\nhorrid sun won\'t sling its hook.\'\r\n\r\nAll at once, in a young woman standing close to a house and on the\r\npoint of being crushed against it by the torrent, Maurice, to his\r\nstupefaction, recognised his sister, Henriette. For nearly a minute\r\nhe remained gaping at her. And it was she who, without appearing\r\nsurprised, spoke the first words: \'They shot him at Bazeilles--yes, I\r\nwas there--and then, as I want to recover his body, I had an idea----\'\r\n\r\nShe named neither the Prussians nor Weiss. Everybody was bound to\r\nunderstand her, and Maurice understood. He fondly loved his sister,\r\nand, with a sob, exclaimed, \'My poor darling!\'\r\n\r\nWhen Henriette had recovered her senses, at about two o\'clock, she had\r\nfound herself at Balan, weeping in the kitchen of some people whom she\r\ndid not know, with her head lying on a table. But her tears soon ceased\r\nto flow. The heroine was already awakening in that slight, delicate,\r\nsilent woman She feared nothing, she had a proud, unconquerable soul.\r\nAnd, in her grief, she no longer had but one idea, that of recovering\r\nher husband\'s body to bury it. Her first plan was simply to return to\r\nBazeilles. But everybody deterred her from attempting this, showed\r\nher that it was absolutely impossible for her to succeed. So she at\r\nlast declared that she would seek some one, a man willing either to\r\naccompany her or to take the necessary steps. And her choice fell upon\r\na cousin of hers, who had been the assistant-manager of the refinery at\r\nLe Ch\xc3\xaane, at the time when Weiss was employed there. He had been much\r\nattached to her husband and would surely not refuse his help. For a\r\ncouple of years past, thanks to his wife having inherited some property\r\nfrom her parents, he had retired and taken up his abode at a charming\r\nplace called the Hermitage, whose tiers of terraces rose up near Sedan,\r\non the farther side of the Fond de Givonne. And thither she was now\r\nmaking her way through all the many obstacles, forced at each moment to\r\nhalt, and in constant danger of being thrown down, trodden under foot,\r\nand killed.\r\n\r\nShe briefly explained her plan to Maurice, who approved of it. \'Cousin\r\nDubreuil,\' said he, \'has always been a good friend to us. He will help\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nThen another idea came into his head. Lieutenant Rochas was anxious to\r\nsave the regimental colours. It had already been suggested that the\r\nflag should be cut up, and that each man should carry a strip of the\r\nsilk under his shirt; or it might be buried at the foot of a tree,\r\nand disinterred later on, if the situation of the spot were carefully\r\nnoted. But the idea of lacerating that banner or burying it like a\r\ncorpse affected them too painfully, and they would have preferred some\r\nother expedient. Accordingly, when Maurice proposed that they should\r\nconfide the colours to some safe person, who would hide them, and if\r\nneed wore, defend them until he could restore them intact, they all\r\napproved of the suggestion. \'Well, then,\' resumed the young fellow,\r\naddressing his sister, \'we will go with you to see if Dubreuil is at\r\nthe Hermitage Besides, I\'m determined not to leave you.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to get out of the crowd, but they succeeded in doing\r\nso, and turned into a hollow road climbing on the left. Then they\r\nfell into a perfect labyrinth of lanes and paths, a suburb of market\r\nand flower gardens, villas and other country places all jumbled and\r\nentangled together; and these paths and lanes wound round between stone\r\nwalls, or turned sharply, and ended at times in blind alleys. There\r\nwas here, indeed, a marvellous entrenched camp for an ambuscade kind\r\nof warfare, full of nooks which ten men might have defended against a\r\nregiment for hours. Shots were already crackling here and there, for\r\nthe suburb overlooked Sedan, and the Prussian Guard was coming up from\r\nthe other side of the valley.\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice and Henriette, followed by the others, had turned first\r\nto the left and then to the right between two interminable walls, they\r\nsuddenly came out in front of the large open gateway of the Hermitage,\r\nwhose grounds rose up in three broad terraces, upon one of which stood\r\nthe house, a large rectangular building, approached by an avenue of\r\nvenerable elms. On the verge of a wood, in front, beyond a narrow,\r\ndeeply banked valley, were some other country residences.\r\n\r\nHenriette felt anxious on seeing the gate wide open. \'They are no\r\nlonger there--they must have gone away,\' said she.\r\n\r\nHer surmise was correct. Foreseeing the impending disaster, Dubreuil\r\nhad, on the previous day, resigned himself to taking his wife and\r\nchildren to Bouillon. Still, the house was not empty. On glancing at it\r\nfrom a distance through the trees, it became evident that it was the\r\nscene of commotion. The young woman at last ventured to step into the\r\navenue, but recoiled on beholding the corpse of a Prussian soldier.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo!\' exclaimed Rochas, \'has there been a tussle here already?\'\r\n\r\nThey were all eager to know what had happened, and hurried towards the\r\nhouse, where the sight they beheld enlightened them. Plainly enough\r\nthe doors and windows of the ground floor had been broken open with\r\nthe butts of guns, and through all the gaping apertures could be seen\r\nthe pillaged rooms; whilst numerous articles of furniture which had\r\nbeen thrown outside were lying on the gravel of the terrace, below the\r\nsteps. There was notably a sky-blue drawing-room _suite_, a sofa and\r\ntwelve arm-chairs, ranged anyhow, pell-mell, round a large stand, the\r\nwhite marble top of which was split in halves. And several Zouaves,\r\nChasseurs, Linesmen, and men of the Marine Infantry were running about\r\nbehind the buildings and along the paths, firing at the little wood\r\nbeyond the dingle in front of them.\r\n\r\n\'We found some of those filthy Prussians here, sir,\' a Zouave explained\r\nto Rochas. \'They were sacking the place. But you can see that we\r\nsettled their hash for them. Only the brutes are now coming back, ten\r\nto one, and it won\'t be an easy job.\'\r\n\r\nThe corpses of three other Prussian soldiers were stretched here\r\nand there upon the terrace. And while Henriette was fixedly looking\r\nat them--doubtless thinking of her husband who, in a like way, was\r\nsleeping the last sleep, lying disfigured amid dust and blood over\r\nyonder--a bullet whizzed past her head and struck a tree behind her.\r\nJean darted forward: \'Don\'t stay there--quick, quick! go and hide\r\nyourself in the house!\'\r\n\r\nSince he had met her again, looking so changed, so distracted by\r\nwretchedness, he had been gazing at her with a melting heart, picturing\r\nher as she had appeared to him on the previous day with her good\r\nhousewife\'s smile. At first he could think of nothing to say to her,\r\nnot knowing even if she would recognise him. But he would gladly have\r\ndevoted himself to her could he have given her back any tranquillity\r\nand happiness. \'Wait for us in the house,\' said he. \'As soon as there\r\nis any danger we\'ll contrive to get you off up there.\'\r\n\r\n\'What use is it?\' she replied, with a gesture of indifference. However,\r\nher brother was also pushing her towards the house, and she had to\r\nclimb the steps, and for a moment enter the hall, whence she could\r\nsurvey the avenue from end to end. From that moment she became a\r\nspectatress of the fight.\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean were posted behind one of the first elms. Each of\r\nthose ancient trunks, of giant proportions, furnished ample shelter for\r\na couple of men. Farther on, Bugler Gaude had joined Lieutenant Rochas,\r\nwho obstinately kept the flag with him since there was no one to whom\r\nhe could confide it. Whilst he was firing he stood it against the tree,\r\nbeside him. Each trunk had its little garrison, the Zouaves, Chasseurs,\r\nand Marines concealing themselves behind the elms, from one to the\r\nother end of the avenue, and only peering forth at the moment when they\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nThe number of Prussians in the little wood across the dingle was no\r\ndoubt steadily increasing, for the hostile fusillade became more and\r\nmore lively. No one was to be seen--you barely espied a flitting\r\nprofile, darting every now and then from one tree to another. Some of\r\nthe enemy\'s skirmishers occupied a country house with green shutters\r\nstanding on the verge of the wood, and were firing from the partially\r\nopened windows of the ground floor. It was now about four o\'clock, the\r\ncannonade was slackening, dying away; but in this sequestered hollow,\r\nwhence the white flag hoisted on the keep of Sedan could not be seen,\r\nthese men, French and Germans, were yet killing one another as though\r\nthey had some personal quarrel together. And in this direction indeed,\r\nin spite of the truce, many hole-and-corner encounters were stubbornly\r\nprolonged until black night fell. Both through the suburb of the Fond\r\nde Givonne, and across the gardens of the Petit-Pont, the fusillade\r\nrattled persistently.\r\n\r\nPrussians and Frenchmen continued for a long while riddling one another\r\nwith bullets across that narrow valley, beyond the Hermitage. From\r\ntime to time, whenever a man was imprudent enough to show himself, he\r\nfell with a bullet in his chest. Three more corpses were already lying\r\nin the avenue, and a wounded man, stretched upon his face there, was\r\ngiving vent to a frightful rattle, without anyone thinking of going to\r\nturn him over, so as to lessen his agony.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as Jean raised his eyes, he saw Henriette slipping a\r\nknapsack as a pillow under the unfortunate fellow\'s head, after laying\r\nhim upon his back. She had stolen out of the house without being\r\nperceived. The corporal ran up to her and dragged her behind the tree\r\nwhich screened Maurice and himself. \'Do you want to get killed?\' he\r\nasked her.\r\n\r\nShe did not seem conscious of her rash temerity: \'No--but I was\r\nfrightened, all alone in that vestibule,\' she answered: \'I would much\r\nrather stay out here.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thenceforth she remained with them. They set her down at their feet\r\nclose against the trunk of the elm, whilst they continued firing their\r\nlast cartridges in such mad desperation that both weariness and fear\r\nflew away. Indeed, complete unconsciousness was coming over them, their\r\nactions were growing quite mechanical, their heads had become so empty\r\nthat they had lost even the instinct of self-preservation.\r\n\r\n\'Just look, Maurice!\' Henriette suddenly exclaimed; \'isn\'t that a man\r\nof the Prussian Guard--that dead fellow lying in front of us?\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment or so she had been scrutinising one of the enemy\'s dead,\r\na thick-set man with big moustaches, who was lying on his side on\r\nthe gravel of the terrace. His spiked helmet had rolled a few steps\r\naway, with its strap broken. And the uniform was indeed that of the\r\nPrussian Guard: dark grey trousers, blue tunic with white galloons and\r\ngreat-coat rolled up and worn in bandolier fashion.\r\n\r\n\'I assure you it is the Guards\' uniform,\' continued Henriette. \'I\'ve an\r\nengraving at home. And, besides, there\'s the photograph which Cousin\r\nGunther sent us.\' She paused, and then in her tranquil way rose and\r\nstepped up to the corpse before she could be prevented. She stooped\r\nover the body and at once exclaimed: \'The shoulder-strap is red! Ah! I\r\nfelt certain of it.\' And then back she came, never heeding the bullets\r\nwhich whistled past her ears. \'Yes, the shoulder-strap\'s red--it was\r\nfated--Cousin Gunther\'s regiment.\'\r\n\r\nFrom that moment neither Maurice nor Jean could prevail on her to\r\nremain still, under cover of the tree. She moved about, and protruded\r\nher head, insisting, despite everything, upon looking in the direction\r\nof the little wood, as though harassed by some absorbing thought. Her\r\nbrother and the corporal still continued firing, pushing her back with\r\ntheir knees whenever she exposed herself too much. The Prussians, no\r\ndoubt, were beginning to consider themselves in sufficient force for\r\nan attack, for they were now boldly showing themselves; quite a stream\r\nof them was gathering and pouring forth from among the trees. This led\r\nto their sustaining heavy losses, for every French bullet took effect,\r\nbringing a man to the ground.\r\n\r\n\'There! perhaps that\'s your cousin!\' suddenly said Jean, \'that officer\r\nwho has just come out of the house with the green shutters.\'\r\n\r\nA captain, recognisable by the gold-laced collar of his tunic and the\r\ngilded eagle which, in the oblique sunlight, was flaming on his helmet,\r\ncould now be seen just outside the little house. Sword in hand, he\r\nwas calling out an order in a sharp voice, and the distance was so\r\nshort--barely two hundred yards--that one could plainly distinguish\r\nhis slim figure and his stern face of a pinkish hue with little fair\r\nmoustaches. Henriette closely scrutinised him with her sharp eyes,\r\nand without any sign of astonishment replied: \'It is certainly he. I\r\nrecognise him perfectly.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice made a wild gesture and took aim. \'Cousin Gunther? Ah! thunder!\r\nhe shall pay for Weiss!\'\r\n\r\nBut Henriette sprang up quivering, and dealt his chassepot a blow, so\r\nthat the bullet flew skyward: \'No, no,\' said she, \'not relatives; not\r\npeople we know. It is abominable!\'\r\n\r\nHer womanly instincts were again aroused within her, and she dropped to\r\nthe ground behind the tree, weeping and sobbing violently. Horror was\r\noverwhelming her; she was now all fear and grief.\r\n\r\nRochas, however, was triumphant. The fire of his few soldiers, whom he\r\nexcited with his thunderous voice, had acquired such intensity at sight\r\nof the Prussians that the latter were falling back, again seeking the\r\ncover of the little wood. \'Keep firm, my lads!\' shouted the lieutenant;\r\n\'don\'t give way. Ah! the capons, they are turning tail, we\'ll settle\r\ntheir hash for them!\'\r\n\r\nHe was quite joyful: he seemed to have recovered all his amazing\r\nconfidence. There had been no defeats! Those few men in front of him,\r\nyonder, were the German armies, which he was about to overthrow at one\r\neasy stroke. All his tall, lean frame, his long, bony face, with its\r\nhooked nose curving over a passionate, good-natured mouth, was merry\r\nwith a braggart delight, the joy of the trooper who has conquered the\r\nworld between courting his sweetheart and tippling a bottle of good\r\nwine!\r\n\r\n\'_Parbleu_! my lads, what are we here for if not to give them a\r\nlicking! It would be something new for us to be beaten, eh? Beaten! is\r\nit possible? Another effort, my lads, and they\'ll scamper away like\r\nhares!\'\r\n\r\nHe yelled and gesticulated, withal such a capital fellow amid his\r\nignorant illusions, that the men readily joined in his gaiety. All at\r\nonce he shouted: \'We\'ll kick them back to the frontier, yes, kick them\r\nback to the frontier! Victory! Victory!\'\r\n\r\nAt that same moment, however, while the enemy on the other side of the\r\ndingle seemed to be falling back, a terrible fusillade broke out on\r\nthe left. It was the everlasting turning movement--a large detachment\r\nof the Guard had made its way round by the Fond de Givonne. From that\r\nmoment it was no longer possible to hold the Hermitage. The dozen men\r\nor so who were still defending its terraces found themselves between\r\ntwo fires, in danger, too, of being cut off from Sedan. Some of them\r\nfell, and for a moment there was extreme confusion. The Prussians were\r\nalready climbing over the walls of the grounds, rushing up along the\r\npathways in such numbers that a bayonet fight immediately began. One\r\nZouave, a tall handsome, black-bearded man, whose head was bare, and\r\nwho had doffed his jacket, especially distinguished himself by his\r\nfearful exploits, transpiercing cracking chests and yielding bellies,\r\nwiping his bayonet, red with one man\'s blood, in the flesh of another\'s\r\nflank; and the weapon having broken he took to splitting skulls with\r\nthe butt of his gun, till at last a stumble altogether disarmed him,\r\nwhen he sprang with such force at the throat of a burly Prussian that,\r\nlocked in a mortal embrace, they both rolled over the gravel as far as\r\nthe gaping kitchen doorway. And here and there, amid the trees and at\r\nthe edges of the lawns, there were other slaughterous encounters which\r\nswelled the number of dead. But it was in front of the house-steps,\r\naround the sky-blue sofa and arm-chairs that the struggle proved most\r\ndesperate--a mad scramble of men firing for a moment at such close\r\nrange that they burned one another\'s faces, and then closing and\r\ntearing with tooth and nail, for lack of a handy knife to plunge into\r\neach other\'s throats.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was that Gaude the bugler, whose pained expression of face\r\nalways spoke of sorrows which he never mentioned to his comrades, was\r\nseized with a fit of heroic lunacy. Amid this last defeat, although he\r\nknew well enough that the company was annihilated, that not a man could\r\nanswer his summons, he caught hold of his bugle, raised it to his lips\r\nand sounded the rally with such a tempestuous blast that it seemed as\r\nthough he wanted to arouse the dead. The Prussians were coming up, yet\r\nhe did not stir, but blew louder and louder, sounding a full flourish\r\nuntil a volley threw him to the ground, when his last breath escaped in\r\na bugle note, quivering skywards through the air.\r\n\r\nRochas standing there, unable to comprehend what was passing, had made\r\nno attempt at flight. He waited and stammered: \'Eh, what is it? what,\r\nwhat?\' The idea that this was again defeat did not enter his brain.\r\nEverything was being changed, even the rules of fighting. Ought not\r\nthose fellows to have waited across the dingle until the French went\r\nthither to beat them? It was impossible to kill enough of them; fresh\r\nones were ever popping up. What could it all mean, this cursed war, in\r\nwhich ten men collected together to kill a single antagonist, when the\r\nenemy only showed himself of an evening, after routing you throughout\r\nthe day by a prudent cannonade? Aghast, distracted, having understood\r\nnothing of the campaign from first to last, Rochas felt himself\r\nenveloped, carried off, as it were, by some superior force which he no\r\nlonger resisted, albeit he mechanically repeated in his obstinate way:\r\n\'Courage, my lads, victory is yonder!\'\r\n\r\nAll the same, he had with a swift movement again taken up the colours.\r\n\'Twas his last thought--to hide them so that they might not be captured\r\nby the Prussians. However, although the shaft was broken, it somehow\r\ncaught in his legs, and almost tripped him up. Bullets were whistling\r\npast him, he felt that death was near, and stripping the silk from the\r\nstaff, he tore and tried to annihilate it. And, at that same moment, he\r\nwas struck in the neck, in the chest, and in the legs, and sank upon\r\nthe ground, swathed in those tricolour shreds. For another minute he\r\nremained alive, with dilated eyes, espying perhaps on the horizon a\r\nvision of what War really was--an atrocious, vital struggle which man\r\nshould accept only with a grave and resigned heart, as he would some\r\nfatal law. Then a little sob escaped him, and he passed away in his\r\nchildish bewilderment, like some poor being of limited understanding,\r\nsome joyous insect crushed beneath the necessity of gigantic and\r\nimpassive nature. And, with him, died a legend.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Prussians were seen arriving, Jean and Maurice had\r\nbeaten a retreat from tree to tree, screening Henriette as far as\r\nwas practicable. They did not cease firing, but every now and again\r\ndischarged a shot and then sought a fresh shelter-place. Maurice knew\r\nof a little door in the wall, in the upper part of the grounds, and\r\nthey luckily found it open. Without a moment\'s hesitation, they all\r\nthree darted outside, bounding into a narrow by-way which wound along\r\nbetween high walls. Just as they were reaching the end of it some shots\r\ncompelled them to spring to the left into what unfortunately proved\r\nto be a blind alley. They thereupon had to gallop back and turn to\r\nthe right under a hail of bullets. Later on, indeed, they were never\r\nable to remember the road they had taken. Men were still firing at one\r\nanother from well-nigh every corner of that inextricable network of\r\npaths and lanes. Some lingered battling, till the last moment, beside\r\nthe cart-gates of market gardeners\' premises; the slightest obstacles\r\nwere being defended and carried by assault with terrible desperation.\r\nThen, all at once, Maurice, his sister, and the corporal found\r\nthemselves once more on the road of the Fond de Givonne, near Sedan.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the last time Jean raised his head and looked towards the\r\nwest, whence a great rosy glow was rising; and he heaved a sigh of\r\nimmense relief: \'Ah! that horrid sun is setting at last.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they were all three galloping, galloping along without\r\ndrawing breath. Around them, the fag end of the stream of fugitives\r\nwas still pouring down the road with the ever-increasing speed of an\r\noverflowing torrent. When they reached the Balan gate they had to wait\r\namid a ferocious crush and scramble. The drawbridge chains had broken,\r\nand as the ditch could only be crossed by the narrow foot-bridge,\r\nneither guns nor horses were, on this side, able to enter the town. The\r\ncrush was said to be still more frightful at the Ch\xc3\xa2teau postern and\r\nthe Cassine gate. It was a wild engulfment, all the remnants of the\r\narmy rolling down the slopes, throwing themselves upon the town and\r\ntumbling into it with a sluicy uproar as though into the depths of some\r\nsewer. The baleful fascination of those walls had ended by perverting\r\neven the bravest.\r\n\r\nMaurice had taken Henriette in his arms, and quivering with impatience\r\nhe exclaimed: \'I hope for God\'s sake they won\'t close the gate till\r\neveryone has got in.\'\r\n\r\nHis fear was that of the throng. Meantime, however, soldiers were\r\nalready camping upon the slopes, both on right and left, whilst\r\nbatteries of artillery, guns, caissons, and horses were stranding,\r\npell-mell, in the ditch. Then repeated bugle calls rang out, followed\r\nby the clear notes of the \'retreat\' summoning the belated soldiers.\r\nSeveral more men thereupon came up at the double-quick, and although\r\nisolated shots still resounded through the suburbs, the reports now\r\nbecame less and less frequent. Detachments were posted on the inner\r\nbanquette of the parapet to defend the approaches, and the gate was at\r\nlast closed. The Prussians were now no more than a hundred yards away.\r\nThey could be seen coming and going across the Balan road, quietly\r\noccupying the houses and gardens there.\r\n\r\nMaurice and Jean--pushing Henriette before them so as to protect her\r\nfrom the jostling of their comrades--had been among the last to enter\r\nSedan. Six o\'clock was striking. The cannonade had now ceased for\r\nnearly an hour, and little by little there came an end even to the\r\nisolated rifle shots. And then of all the deafening uproar, the hateful\r\nthunder that had growled since sunrise, nothing whatever remained;\r\nit had passed into death-like nihility. Night came, falling amid a\r\nlugubrious, an awful silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTRUCE AND SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about half-past five, before the gates were closed, Delaherche,\r\nanxious with regard to the consequences, now that he knew the battle\r\nto be lost, again returned to the Sub-Prefecture. He remained there\r\nduring nearly three hours, pacing across the paved courtyard, watching\r\nand questioning the officers who passed; and it was thus that he became\r\nacquainted with the rapid march of events:--General de Wimpffen\'s\r\nresignation tendered, then withdrawn, full powers conferred upon him by\r\nthe Emperor to repair to the Prussian headquarters and obtain the least\r\ngrievous conditions possible for the vanquished army, and finally,\r\nthe assembling of a council of war, to decide whether they might\r\ntry to continue the struggle by defending the fortress. During the\r\nsitting of this council, which was composed of some twenty commanding\r\nofficers, and seemed to last an eternity, the manufacturer climbed the\r\nhouse-steps more than a score of times. And all at once, at a quarter\r\npast eight, he saw General de Wimpffen come down them, very red and\r\nwith swollen eyes. He was followed by a colonel and two other generals,\r\nand they all leaped into the saddle and went off by the bridge over the\r\nMeuse. So capitulation had been resolved upon, had become inevitable!\r\n\r\nTranquillised by this, Delaherche reflected that he was very hungry,\r\nand resolved to return home. As soon as he was out of the courtyard,\r\nhowever, he hesitated at sight of the frightful obstruction that had\r\nmeantime been reaching a climax. The streets, the squares were gorged,\r\ncrammed, filled with men, horses, and guns to such a point that it\r\nseemed as though the compact mass had been forcibly driven into the\r\ntown by means of some gigantic ram. Whilst the regiments which had\r\nfallen back in good order were bivouacking on the ramparts, the\r\nscattered remnants of all the various corps, the fugitives of every\r\narm, the whole swarming herd had fairly submerged Sedan, and such was\r\nnow the accumulation, so dense had this motionless crowd become, that\r\nin its midst one could no longer move either arm or leg. The wheels\r\nof the guns, of the caissons and other innumerable vehicles were\r\nlocked together, the horses which had been lashed and urged in every\r\ndirection, had room neither to advance nor to step back, and the men,\r\ndeaf to every threat, were invading the houses, devouring whatever\r\nthey found, lying down wherever they could, both in the rooms and in\r\nthe cellars. Many too had fallen on the doorsteps, blocking up the\r\nvestibules; whilst others, lacking the strength to go any farther, were\r\nstretched upon the footways, sound asleep there, not even rising when\r\ntheir limbs were trampled upon, preferring as it were to lie there and\r\nbe crushed rather than take the trouble of going elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDelaherche then understood the necessity of surrender. At some\r\ncrossways artillery caissons stood so close together, that if a single\r\nGerman shell had fallen upon anyone of them, all would have exploded,\r\nand Sedan would then have flared from rampart to rampart. And, besides,\r\nwhat could be done with such a heap of wretches, overwhelmed with\r\nhunger and weariness, without cartridges and without food? An entire\r\nday would have been needed merely to clear the streets. Then, too,\r\nthe fortress itself was not armed, the town was not provisioned. All\r\nthis had been pointed out at the council of war, by those who were\r\nof sensible mind, those who retained an accurate perception of the\r\nsituation in the midst of their deep, patriotic grief; and the boldest\r\nofficers, those who quivered and exclaimed that it was impossible for\r\nan army to surrender in this fashion, had been obliged to bow their\r\nheads, unable to devise any practical means of renewing the struggle on\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nDelaherche managed with great difficulty to make his way through the\r\nmob on the Place Turenne and the Place du Rivage. As he passed in front\r\nof the Golden Cross Hotel he caught sight of its mournful dining-room,\r\nwhere some general officers sat in silence at the bare table. There\r\nwas nothing left--not even any bread. General Bourgain-Desfeuilles,\r\nwho could be heard roaring in the kitchen, must, however, have\r\nmanaged to discover a few scraps, for he suddenly became silent,\r\nand darted upstairs embarrassed with something wrapped in a greasy\r\npaper. There was such a crowd outside, looking through the windows\r\nat that lugubrious _table d\'h\xc3\xb4te_, swept bare by sudden famine, that\r\nDelaherche, stuck fast in its midst, had to use his elbows vigorously,\r\nand even then, such was the pushing, that he occasionally lost all the\r\nground he had managed to gain. In the High Street the block appeared so\r\nimpassable that for a moment he despaired of ever getting home again.\r\nAll the guns of a battery seemed to have been thrown there, pell-mell,\r\none atop of another. Eventually he made up his mind to climb on to\r\nthe carriages, whence striding over the pieces he jumped from wheel\r\nto wheel, at the risk of breaking his legs. Then the horses barred\r\nhis way, and he had to stoop, glide between the legs and under the\r\nbellies of these wretched animals who were dying of inanition. The\r\nobstacles became more and more formidable, and so frightened him at\r\nlast, that when, after a quarter of an hour of repeated efforts, he had\r\ngot as far as the Rue St. Michel, he resolved to turn into that street\r\nand work his way round by the Rue des Laboureurs, hoping that these\r\nout-of-the-way thoroughfares would be less obstructed than the High\r\nStreet. Unluckily, however, there happened to be there a house of evil\r\nrepute, which a band of drunken soldiers was besieging; and fearing\r\nthat he might get some nasty blow in the brawl, he retraced his steps.\r\nThenceforth he became obstinate, and pushed on to the end of the High\r\nStreet, at times balancing himself on the shafts of vehicles and at\r\nothers climbing over vans. On the Place du Coll\xc3\xa8ge he was passed along\r\non men\'s shoulders for some thirty steps; then, falling, he narrowly\r\nmissed having his ribs broken, and only saved himself by catching hold\r\nof the iron bars of a railing. And more than an hour had elapsed since\r\nhis departure from the Sub-Prefecture when he at last reached the Rue\r\nMaqua, sweating, in tatters, and quite exhausted. Yet, as a rule, he\r\ncould walk from one place to the other in less than five minutes.\r\n\r\nDesirous of preventing the ambulance and the garden from being invaded,\r\nMajor Bouroche had taken the precaution to have two sentries placed at\r\nthe entrance of the premises. This was a great relief to Delaherche, to\r\nwhom the idea had suddenly occurred that his house was perhaps being\r\npillaged. On reaching the garden the sight of the ambulance, faintly\r\nlighted up by a few lanterns, and exhaling the foul breath of fever,\r\nagain sent a shiver to his heart. Then, on stumbling against a soldier\r\nwho was lying on the paving-stones, he suddenly remembered the Seventh\r\nCorps\' treasury-chest which this man had been guarding since the\r\nmorning, forgotten, no doubt, by his officers, and at last so overcome\r\nby fatigue that he had stretched himself there to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe house itself seemed to be empty, all was black on the ground floor,\r\nwhere the doors were wide open. The servants must have remained in the\r\nambulance, for he found nobody in the kitchen, where a dim little lamp\r\nwas smoking. Having lighted a candle, he went as softly as he could\r\nup the stairs in order not to wake his mother and his wife. Before\r\nreturning to the Sub-Prefecture he had begged that they would go to bed\r\nearly, after so laborious a day, fraught with such terrible emotions.\r\n\r\nOn entering his private room, however, he had a surprise. A soldier\r\nwas lying upon the sofa where Captain Beaudoin had slept for a few\r\nhours the day before, and it was only when he recognised him to\r\nbe Henriette\'s brother, Maurice, that he understood his presence\r\nthere, the more so as, on turning round, he had perceived another\r\nsoldier--that fellow Jean whom he had seen prior to the battle, and\r\nwho, wrapped in a blanket, was now lying on a rug. Utterly overcome\r\nwith weariness, they both looked like dead men. Delaherche did not\r\ntarry, but went to his wife\'s room close by. A lamp, standing on the\r\ncorner of a table, was burning there amid a quivering silence. Gilberte\r\nhad simply thrown herself across the bed, in fear, no doubt, of some\r\ncatastrophe. She was sleeping very calmly, however, whilst Henriette,\r\nseated near her on a chair, with merely her head resting on the edge\r\nof the mattress, was also slumbering; but _her_ sleep was disturbed by\r\nnightmares, and big tears were welling under her eyelids. Delaherche\r\nlooked at them both for a moment, and was tempted to rouse Henriette\r\nto inquire what she had done. Had she been to Bazeilles? Perhaps, if\r\nhe questioned her, she would be able to give him some news of his\r\ndyeworks. However, he took pity on her, and was on the point of leaving\r\nthe room when his mother appeared on the threshold, and, without a\r\nword, signed to him to follow her.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the dining-room he gave vent to his astonishment:\r\n\'What, haven\'t you gone to bed?\'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; and then, in an undertone, she said: \'I cannot\r\nsleep. I have been sitting in an armchair near the colonel. He\'s in a\r\nburning fever, and wakes up every moment and questions me. I don\'t\r\nknow what to answer him. Come in and see him.\'\r\n\r\nM. de Vineuil had already fallen asleep again. His long, red\r\nface--which his moustaches streaked with wavy snow--could scarcely\r\nbe distinguished on the pillow, for Madame Delaherche had placed a\r\nnewspaper before the lamp, so that the head of the bed was obscured.\r\nThe bright light fell upon herself as she sat rigidly in the armchair,\r\nwith her hands inertly resting in her lap, and her eyes gazing afar, in\r\na tragic reverie.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a moment,\' she murmured. \'I think he heard you come in. Yes, he\r\nis waking again.\'\r\n\r\nThe colonel was, indeed, opening his eyes and fixing them on Delaherche\r\nwithout moving his head. He recognised the manufacturer, and in a voice\r\nwhich trembled with fever, he inquired: \'It\'s all over, isn\'t it? They\r\nare capitulating?\'\r\n\r\nEspying a glance which his mother gave him, Delaherche was on the point\r\nof telling an untruth. But what would be the good of it? And so, with\r\na gesture of discouragement, he replied: \'What would you have them do?\r\nIf you could only see the streets of the town. General de Wimpffen has\r\njust started for the German headquarters to discuss the conditions.\'\r\n\r\nM. de Vineuil\'s eyes had closed again, and a long shudder convulsed\r\nhim, whilst from his lips escaped a hollow lamentation: \'Ah! my God!\r\nmy God!\' And without opening his eyes he continued in a spasmodical\r\nvoice: \'Ah! it was yesterday that what I wanted ought to have been\r\ndone. Yes, I know the district. I told the general what I feared;\r\nbut they wouldn\'t even listen to _him_--all the heights up there, up\r\nabove St. Menges, as far as Fleigneux, occupied by our men--the army\r\ncommanding Sedan, and holding the defile of St. Albert. We wait there,\r\nour positions are impregnable, the road to M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res remains open----\'\r\n\r\nThen his speech became embarrassed, and he could only stammer a few\r\nunintelligible words, whilst the fever-born vision of the battle slowly\r\nfaded away, carried off by sleep. He slumbered, possibly still dreaming\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\n\'Does the major answer for him?\' Delaherche asked, in a low voice. The\r\nold lady nodded affirmatively. \'All the same those wounds in the foot\r\nare terrible,\' he resumed. \'He will be laid up for a long while, I\r\nsuppose?\'\r\n\r\nThis time she made no reply; she herself was absorbed in the great\r\ngrief of the defeat. She belonged to another age, to those old, rough\r\nfrontier-burgesses of bygone times, so ardent in defending their\r\ncities. The bright lamp-light fell upon her stern face, which with its\r\nsharp nose and thin lips bespoke all her anger and suffering, all the\r\nfeeling of revolt that prevented her from sleeping.\r\n\r\nThen Delaherche felt isolated and frightfully wretched. His hunger was\r\nreturning, becoming quite intolerable, and he thought it was weakness\r\nalone that thus deprived him of all courage. So he left the room on\r\ntip-toe and went down into the kitchen again with the candlestick. But\r\nhere everything was still more dreary: with the fire out, the sideboard\r\nempty, and the dishcloths flung about in disorder, it seemed as though\r\nthe blast of the disaster had swept even through this room and carried\r\naway all the substantial gaiety of creature comforts. He thought at\r\nfirst that he should not be able to find even a crust, the bread\r\nhaving been taken for the _soupe_ at the ambulance. In the depths of a\r\ncupboard, however, he at last came upon some haricot beans, left from\r\nthe previous day, and forgotten there. And he ate them as they were,\r\ncold, without butter and without bread, standing at the table there,\r\nfor he did not like to go upstairs to partake of such a meal as this,\r\nthough on the other hand he made all haste to get out of that dismal\r\nkitchen, where the little vacillating lamp was infecting the atmosphere\r\nwith a horrible stench of petroleum.\r\n\r\nIt was now scarcely more than ten o\'clock, and Delaherche remained\r\nwith nothing to do pending the time when he should know whether the\r\ncapitulation was really to be signed or not. He still experienced a\r\nfeeling of anxiety, a fear lest the struggle should be resumed, a\r\ndreadful terror of what might then happen, which he did not speak of,\r\nbut which weighed covertly upon his heart. When he had again returned\r\nto his private room, where neither Maurice nor Jean had stirred, he\r\ntried to lie back in an arm-chair and get to sleep there; but sleep\r\nwould not come to him, a noise of exploding shells made him start to\r\nhis feet each time that he was on the point of losing consciousness.\r\nIt was the uproar of the frightful cannonade of the daytime still\r\nlingering in his ears; and whenever he was roused by it he would listen\r\nfor a moment, quite scared, and tremble at the deep silence which\r\nsurrounded him. Being unable to sleep, he preferred to remain on his\r\nlegs, and began wandering about the dark rooms, carefully avoiding the\r\nchamber where his mother was watching over the colonel, for the fixed\r\nstare with which she gazed at him made him feel quite uncomfortable.\r\nHowever, he twice went to see if Henriette had awakened, and paused at\r\nsight of his wife\'s calm, peaceful face. Not knowing what to do with\r\nhimself, he kept on going up and down, moving hither and thither, until\r\ntwo o\'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe could then bear it no longer, and resolved upon again returning\r\nto the Sub-Prefecture, fully realising that until he knew what to\r\nexpect it would be impossible for him to obtain any repose. Down\r\nbelow, however, at sight of the obstructed street, he was seized with\r\ndespair, feeling that he would never have the strength to go and return\r\nthrough all those obstacles, the mere recollection of which made his\r\nlimbs ache. And he stood there hesitating, when he saw Major Bouroche\r\napproach, panting and swearing: \'Thunder! I thought I should have left\r\nmy legs behind me.\'\r\n\r\nThe major had been obliged to repair to the town-hall to beg the mayor\r\nto requisition some chloroform, and send it to him at daybreak, for his\r\nown supply was exhausted. He still had several urgent operations to\r\nperform, and feared, so he put it, that he might be obliged to chop the\r\npoor devils up without an\xc3\xa6sthetising them.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\' asked Delaherche.\r\n\r\n\'Well, they don\'t even know whether the chemists have any left!\'\r\n\r\nBut the manufacturer did not care a rap about the chloroform. \'No,\r\nno,\' said he, \'is it finished over there? Have they signed with the\r\nPrussians?\'\r\n\r\nThe major waved his arm violently. \'Nothing\'s done!\' he cried.\r\n\'Wimpffen has just come back. Those beggars, it seems, are that\r\nexacting they deserve to have their ears boxed! Well, well, let us\r\nbegin again and kick the bucket all of us; that\'s the best thing to do!\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche turned pale as he listened. \'But is what you tell me quite\r\ncertain?\'\r\n\r\n\'I had it from those people of the Municipal Council who are sitting\r\nover there _en permanence_. An officer came from the Sub-Prefecture to\r\ninform them of everything.\'\r\n\r\nThen he gave some details. The interview between General de Wimpffen,\r\nGeneral von Moltke, and Bismarck had taken place at the ch\xc3\xa2teau of\r\nBellevue, near Donchery. A terrible man that General von Moltke,\r\nstern and hard, with the glabrous face of a mathematical chemist; a\r\nman who won battles by working out algebraical calculations in his\r\nstudy! He had immediately been desirous of showing that he was fully\r\nacquainted with the hopeless situation of the French army: it had no\r\nprovisions and no ammunition, said he, it was a prey to demoralisation\r\nand disorder, and there was no possibility whatever of its breaking the\r\niron circle that shut it in; whilst the German armies occupied by far\r\nthe stronger positions, and could burn down the town in a couple of\r\nhours. Then he coldly dictated his will, which was the surrender of the\r\nentire French army, with arms and baggage.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Bismarck simply supported Moltke with the air of a\r\ngood-natured bloodhound. And, thereupon, General de Wimpffen exhausted\r\nhimself in combating these conditions, the most harsh that were ever\r\nimposed upon a beaten army. He spoke of his ill-luck, the heroism of\r\nthe soldiers, and the danger of exasperating a proud people beyond\r\nendurance; he threatened, begged, talked during three hours with\r\ndespairing, superb eloquence, asking that the vanquished army might\r\nsimply be interned in some far-off region of France, or, if preferred,\r\nin Algeria; but, after all, the only concession made by the victor was\r\nthat those of the officers who would give an engagement in writing, and\r\npledge their honour not to serve again during the war, might return\r\nto their homes. Finally, the truce was prolonged until ten o\'clock on\r\nthe following morning, and if at that hour the conditions had not been\r\naccepted, the Prussian batteries would again open fire and burn down\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s idiotic!\' exclaimed Delaherche; \'you don\'t burn down a town\r\nthat has done nothing to deserve it.\'\r\n\r\nThe major, however, put the finishing touch to his alarm by adding\r\nthat he had just seen some officers at the H\xc3\xb4tel de l\'Europe who were\r\ntalking of a _sortie en masse_ before daybreak. Since the German\r\nexactions had become known, extreme excitement was being manifested,\r\nand the most extravagant plans were broached. Nobody was deterred by\r\nthe idea that it would not be loyal to break the truce without a word\r\nof warning, under cover of the darkness, and all sorts of mad plans\r\nwere indulged in:--A midnight march on Carignan through the ranks\r\nof the Bavarians, the recapture of the plateau of Illy, by means of\r\na surprise, and the opening up of the road to M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res; or else an\r\nirresistible rush, which at one bound would land them in Belgium.\r\nOthers, it is true, said nothing, but realised the fatality of the\r\ndisaster, and would have accepted and signed anything with a glad cry\r\nof relief, so as to have done at once with the whole business.\r\n\r\n\'Well, good night,\' added Bouroche. \'I must try to sleep for a couple\r\nof hours. I need it.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he went off, leaving Delaherche suffocating. What? It was\r\ntrue, then; they were going to begin fighting again; they were going\r\nto burn and raze Sedan to the ground! It was becoming inevitable; this\r\nfrightful thing would assuredly take place as soon as the sun had risen\r\nhigh enough above the hills to illumine the horror of the massacre.\r\nIn a mechanical way he once more climbed the steep garret-stairs, and\r\nfound himself again among the chimney stacks at the edge of the narrow\r\nterrace overlooking the town. But now he was in the midst of darkness,\r\nan infinite rolling sea of huge black waves, among which he was at\r\nfirst unable to distinguish anything. The factory buildings below him\r\nwere the first to stand out in the gloom, in confused masses which he\r\nrecognised; the engine-room, the loom-shops, the drying-rooms, the\r\nwarehouses; and the view of all that huge pile of building, his pride\r\nand his wealth, overwhelmed him with pity for himself at the thought\r\nthat in a few hours\' time there would only be some ashes of it left. He\r\nraised his eyes towards the horizon and looked all around that black\r\nimmensity, where the menace of the morrow was sleeping. On the south,\r\nin the direction of Bazeilles, some flakes of fire were flying skyward\r\nabove the houses sinking into cinders; whilst, towards the north, the\r\nfarm of the wood of La Garenne, set on fire during the evening, was\r\nstill burning, ensanguining the trees with a great red glow. There\r\nwere no other fires, nothing but those two blazes; all the rest was\r\na fathomless abyss traversed only by scattered, terrifying noises.\r\nSome one was weeping over yonder, perhaps far away, perhaps upon the\r\nramparts. In vain did he try to penetrate the veil, to discern the\r\nLiry and Marf\xc3\xa9e hills, the Fr\xc3\xa9nois and Wadelincourt batteries, all the\r\nlong belt of bronze beasts, with outstretched necks and open muzzles,\r\nwhose presence he divined there. And as he lowered his eyes upon the\r\ntown around him, he heard its pant of anguish--not merely the restless\r\nslumber of the soldiers fallen in the streets, the dull rustling of\r\nthat mass of men, animals, and guns, but also, at least he fancied\r\nso, the anxious insomnia of the citizens, his neighbours, who, like\r\nhimself, were unable to sleep, consumed by fever whilst they waited for\r\nthe dawn. They all must know that the capitulation was not signed;\r\nthey all must be counting the hours, shivering at the idea that if\r\nit were not signed nothing would remain for them but to go down into\r\ntheir cellars to die there, blocked up, crushed beneath the ruins of\r\ntheir homes. Then, all at once it seemed to him as though a desperate\r\nvoice were ascending from the Rue des Voyards, crying \'Murder!\' amid a\r\nsudden clank of arms. And thereupon he leant over the terrace railing\r\nand remained there listening in the dense night, lost amid the misty,\r\nstarless sky, and seized from head to foot with such a shuddering that\r\nevery hair upon his skin stood up.\r\n\r\nMaurice awoke on the sofa at the first gleam of light. He was aching\r\nall over and did not stir, but lay there with his eyes fixed on the\r\nwindow panes, whilst they were slowly whitened by a livid dawn.\r\nIn the acute lucidity of those waking moments, all the abominable\r\nmemories returned to him, the battle of the day before, the flight,\r\nthe disaster. Everything again passed before his eyes, even to the\r\nslightest details, and he experienced frightful suffering at the\r\nthought of that defeat, the crying shame of which penetrated to the\r\nvery roots of his being, as though he had felt himself the culprit.\r\nAnd he reasoned his sufferings, analysed himself, finding the faculty\r\nof devouring himself quickened by what had happened. Was he not, after\r\nall, the first comer, a mere passer-by of the period, certainly of\r\nbrilliant education, but at the same time crassly ignorant of all that\r\nhe ought to have known, vain, too, even to blindness, and perverted by\r\nimpatience for enjoyment, and by the lying prosperity of the reign?\r\nThen came another evocation as it were; he pictured his grandfather,\r\nborn in 1780, one of the heroes of the Grand Army, one of the victors\r\nof Austerlitz, Wagram, and Friedland; next his father, born in 1811,\r\nfallen into bureaucracy, a petty official of indifferent ability,\r\nreceiver of taxes at Le Ch\xc3\xaane Populeux, where he had worn himself\r\naway; then himself, born in 1841, brought up as a gentleman, called to\r\nthe bar, capable of the worst folly and of the greatest enthusiasm,\r\nvanquished at Sedan, in what he realised was an immense catastrophe,\r\nthe end, indeed, of a world; and this degeneration of the race, which\r\nexplained how it had become possible that France, victorious with\r\nthe grandfathers, should be defeated in the person of the grandsons,\r\ncrushed his heart as though it were some slowly aggravated family\r\ncomplaint, culminating in the fatal catastrophe when the appointed hour\r\nhad struck. He would have felt so brave and triumphant had they been\r\nvictorious! But in presence of defeat he was seized with the nervous\r\nweakness of a woman, and gave way to one of those fits of immense\r\ndespair, during which it seemed to him as though the whole world were\r\nfoundering. There was nothing left, France was dead. Sobs stifled him,\r\nand he wept, joining his hands together and stammering once more the\r\nprayers of infancy: \'Take me, my God! Take all these poor suffering\r\nwretches!\'\r\n\r\nJean, rolled up in the blanket on the floor, heard him, and began to\r\nstir. \'What is the matter, youngster? Are you ill?\' asked the corporal,\r\neventually sitting up and feeling greatly astonished. Then, realising\r\nthat Maurice had been taken again with those peculiar ideas of his,\r\nhe spoke to him in a fatherly way: \'Come, what is the matter? You\r\nshouldn\'t worry yourself like that for nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' exclaimed Maurice, \'it\'s all up; we can prepare ourselves to\r\nbecome Prussians.\'\r\n\r\nJean, illiterate peasant that he was, with a hard skull, expressed\r\ngreat astonishment on hearing this, whereupon Maurice tried to make him\r\nunderstand that the race was exhausted, and must disappear and make\r\nroom for the necessary stream of new blood. With an obstinate shake\r\nof the head, however, the corporal refused to accept the explanation:\r\n\'What! my field no longer belong to me? I should allow the Prussians to\r\ntake it when I\'m not yet dead and still have my two arms left? Come,\r\ncome!\'\r\n\r\nThen, in his turn, he gave utterance to his ideas, expressing himself\r\nlaboriously in such words as he could think of. They had had a fearful\r\nlicking; that was certain. But they were not all dead, yet; there were\r\nstill some left, and these would suffice to build the house afresh,\r\nprovided they were good fellows and hard-workers, and didn\'t drink all\r\nthey earned. In a family, now, when its members take proper care and\r\nput a bit of money by, they always manage to pull through even the\r\nworst stretches of bad luck. And besides, a blow sometimes does a man\r\ngood: it makes him reflect. And then, too, if it were true there was\r\nsome rottenness somewhere, some putrid limbs or other, far better lop\r\nthem off with an axe and have done with them, than keep them until\r\nthey killed you, like the cholera. \'Exhausted, done for? No, no,\' he\r\nrepeated again and again. \'I\'m not done for. I don\'t feel that way at\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\nAnd stiff and lame though he was, with his hair still matted together\r\nby the blood from his torn scalp, he drew himself up, full of a\r\nvivacious need of life, ready to take a tool, to drive a plough, to\r\nbuild the house afresh as he expressed it. He belonged to the old,\r\nstubborn, sober stratum, the sensible, hard-working, and thrifty France.\r\n\r\n\'All the same,\' he resumed, \'I\'m sorry for the Emperor. Trade seemed to\r\nbe in a fair way, wheat sold well. But, sure enough, he has been very\r\nstupid. No sensible chap would get himself into such a mess as this.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, who still remained quite overwhelmed, made another distressful\r\ngesture: \'Ah! the Emperor; I liked him at bottom in spite of my ideas\r\nof liberty and a Republic. Yes, I had it in my blood, on account of my\r\ngrandfather, no doubt. And now you see everything\'s rotten, even in\r\nthat direction. Ah! what will become of us?\'\r\n\r\nA wild look was glimmering in his eyes, and he raised so grievous\r\na plaint that Jean felt anxious and was about to rise, when the\r\ndoor opened and Henriette came in. The sound of their voices had\r\njust awakened her in the adjoining bedchamber. A pale light was now\r\nbrightening the room.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve come just in time to scold him,\' said Jean, pretending to\r\nlaugh. \'He\'s not behaving as he ought.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, the sight of his sister, so pale and afflicted, had induced\r\na salutary crisis of sensibility. Maurice opened his arms, called\r\nher to his heart, and when she had flung her arms around his neck, a\r\ngreat appeasement penetrated him. She herself was weeping, and their\r\ntears mingled. \'Ah! my poor, poor darling. I\'m angry with myself that\r\nI haven\'t more courage to console you! That good fellow Weiss--your\r\nhusband who was so fond of you--what will become of you? You have\r\nalways been the victim, and yet you never complained. What a deal of\r\ngrief I, myself, have caused you already, and who knows whether I\r\nsha\'n\'t cause you even more----\'\r\n\r\nShe was silencing him, placing her hand before his mouth, when in came\r\nDelaherche half out of his senses. Again feeling frightfully hungry,\r\nwith one of those nervous hungers which fatigue exasperates, he had at\r\nlast come down from the terrace, and on going to the kitchen to get\r\nsomething warm to drink, he had there found the cook with one of her\r\nrelatives, a carpenter of Bazeilles, to whom she was just serving some\r\nmulled wine. Thereupon, this man, one of the last to remain in the\r\nvillage amid the conflagration, had told him that his dyeworks were\r\nutterly destroyed, reduced to a heap of cinders.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the brigands, would you believe it?\' stammered the manufacturer,\r\naddressing Jean and Maurice. \'Everything is lost. They are going to\r\nburn down Sedan this morning as they burnt down Bazeilles yesterday--I\r\nam ruined, ruined!\'\r\n\r\nStruck all at once by the scar which he observed on Henriette\'s\r\nforehead, he remembered that he had not yet been able to speak with\r\nher. \'It\'s true, then,\' he added, \'you went there, and got hurt like\r\nthat? Ah! poor Weiss!\' And then, understanding by the young woman\'s\r\nred eyes that she knew of her husband\'s death, he blurted out a\r\nfearful detail which he had just learnt from the carpenter: \'That poor\r\nWeiss! It appears they burned him! Yes, they threw the bodies of the\r\ninhabitants they had shot into the flames of a blazing house, which\r\nthey had smeared with petroleum.\'[34]\r\n\r\nHenriette listened, struck with horror. Good Lord! So she would not\r\neven have the consolation of recovering and burying her dear husband,\r\nwhose ashes would be swept away by the wind! Maurice had again pressed\r\nher to his heart, and in a caressing voice was calling her his poor\r\nCinderella, and beseeching her not to give way to so much grief, she\r\nwho was so brave.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of silence, during which Delaherche stood at the\r\nwindow observing the brightening of the light, he hastily turned and\r\nsaid to the two soldiers: \'By the way, I was forgetting, but I came to\r\ntell you that downstairs, in the coach-house, where the treasury-chest\r\nis deposited, there is an officer distributing the money among the men,\r\nso that the Prussians may not get it. You ought to go down, for money\r\nmay be useful if we are not all of us dead to-night.\'\r\n\r\nThe advice was good, and Maurice and Jean went down, as soon as\r\nHenriette had consented to take her brother\'s place on the sofa.\r\nDelaherche, meantime, passed into the adjoining room, where he found\r\nGilberte, still with her face quite calm, and sleeping as peacefully as\r\na child; neither the loud talking nor the sobs having caused so much\r\nas a change in her position. And thence he peeped into the room where\r\nhis mother was watching over M. de Vineuil, and found that she had\r\ndozed off in her armchair, whilst the colonel, whose eyes were closed,\r\nhad not stirred, being utterly prostrated by fever. All at once,\r\nhowever, he opened his eyes widely, and asked: \'Well, it is finished,\r\nisn\'t it?\'\r\n\r\nVexed by this question, which detained him just when he wished to take\r\nhimself off, Delaherche made an angry gesture, whilst deadening his\r\nvoice to answer: \'Ah, yes, finished, till it begins again! Nothing has\r\nbeen signed.\'\r\n\r\nA prey to incipient delirium, the colonel continued in faint tones: \'My\r\nGod, may I die before the finish! I don\'t hear the guns. Why are they\r\nno longer firing? Up at St. Menges and Fleigneux we command all the\r\nroads; we will fling the Prussians into the Meuse should they venture\r\nto turn Sedan, to attack us. The town is at our feet between them and\r\nus, like an obstacle which strengthens our position. March! the Seventh\r\nCorps will take the lead, the Twelfth will cover the retreat----\'\r\n\r\nHis hands jogged up and down on the sheet as though in unison with the\r\ntrot of the horse, which, in his dream, was carrying him along. Little\r\nby little, however, as his words fell more heavily from his lips and he\r\nsank asleep, their movement became slower, till at last it altogether\r\nceased, and he lay there, without a breath, overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\'Rest yourself,\' Delaherche had whispered, \'I will come back as soon as\r\nI have some news.\' Then, after making sure that he had not awakened his\r\nmother, he slipped out of the room and disappeared.\r\n\r\nSeated on a kitchen chair in the coach-house down below, Jean and\r\nMaurice had found a paymaster who was distributing fortunes there,\r\nscreened merely by a little deal table placed in front of him, and\r\nwithout having recourse to pens, receipt forms, or papers of any kind.\r\nHe simply dipped his hand into the bags overflowing with gold coins,\r\nand without even taking the trouble to count them, rapidly dropped a\r\nhandful into the cap of each sergeant of the Seventh Corps who defiled\r\nbefore him. It was understood that the sergeants were to divide the\r\nsums given them among the men of their half-section. They all received\r\nthe money with an awkward air, as though it had been some ration of\r\nmeat or coffee, and then went off in embarrassment, emptying their\r\n_k\xc3\xa9pis_ into their pockets, so that they might not find themselves\r\nin the streets with all that gold displayed to view. And not a word\r\nwas spoken. The only sound was the crystalline chinking of the coins\r\namid the stupefaction which these poor devils experienced at finding\r\nthemselves laden with all this wealth when there was no longer a loaf\r\nof bread or a quart of wine to be purchased in the whole town.\r\n\r\nWhen Jean and Maurice stepped forward, the paymaster at first withdrew\r\nthe handful of gold which he had ready, and exclaimed: \'Neither of you\r\nis a sergeant. Only the sergeants have a right to receive----\' Then,\r\ntired already, and anxious to have done with it, he added: \'Here,\r\ncorporal, you can take some all the same. Quick there, whose turn next?\'\r\n\r\nHe had let the coins drop into the _k\xc3\xa9pi_ which Jean held out to him;\r\nand the corporal, stirred at sight of the amount, nearly six hundred\r\nfrancs, immediately desired Maurice to take half of it. There was no\r\ntelling, said he; it was quite possible that they might be suddenly\r\nseparated from one another. They accordingly divided the money in the\r\ngarden in front of the ambulance, which they afterwards entered, having\r\nnoticed their company\'s drummer, a gay, fat fellow named Bastian, lying\r\non the straw near the entry. At about five o\'clock on the previous\r\nevening, when the battle was over, he had been unluckily wounded in the\r\ngroin by a stray bullet.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle which the ambulance presented in the white morning\r\ntwilight, at this moment of the reveille, fairly froze their hearts.\r\nThree more of the wounded had died, unperceived, during the night, and\r\nnow the attendants were hastily making room for others by carrying the\r\ncorpses away. Every now and then the men amputated on the previous\r\nday, lying there in a somnolent state, would abruptly open their eyes\r\nand gaze with stupor on the vast dormitory of suffering in which they\r\nfound themselves, and where, as in the shambles, a half-slaughtered\r\nflock lay prone upon the straw. The attendants had certainly swept\r\nand somewhat tidied the place on the previous evening, after all the\r\nbloody _cuisine_ of the operations; but here and there trails of blood\r\ncould be seen on the badly wiped floor, whilst a large red-spotted\r\nsponge, looking not unlike a human brain, was floating in a pail, and a\r\nforgotten hand, with broken fingers, was lying just outside the door,\r\nunder the shed. These were the crumbs as it were of the butchery, the\r\nfrightful scraps of the morrow of a day of massacre, dimly seen in\r\nthe mournful rising of the dawn. And all the agitation and turbulent\r\nassertion of life of the earlier hours had, under the heavy weight of\r\nfever, given way to prostration. Scarcely a stammered plaint, deadened\r\nby sleepiness, disturbed the moist silence. A scared look came into the\r\nsufferer\'s glassy eyes as they again encountered the daylight; their\r\nclammy mouths exhaled foul breath; the whole hall was sinking into the\r\nsuccession of endless, livid, nauseous, death-sprinkled days which were\r\nnow reserved to those wretched, mutilated men, who, at the end of two\r\nor three months, might possibly get over it, but at the cost of one of\r\ntheir limbs.\r\n\r\nBouroche, who was beginning his round, after a few hours\' repose,\r\npaused for an instant in front of Drummer Bastian, and then passed on\r\nwith a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulders. Nothing could be\r\ndone for that poor devil. The drummer, however, had opened his eyes,\r\nand, as though resuscitated, was keenly watching a sergeant, who, with\r\nhis cap full of gold, had come to see whether some of his men were\r\namong the wounded. It so happened that there were a couple, and he gave\r\neach of them twenty francs. Other sergeants now arrived; gold began to\r\nrain upon the straw, and Bastian, who had succeeded in sitting up, held\r\nout both his hands, which the death pangs were already shaking, and\r\nstammered: \'For me! For me!\'\r\n\r\nThe sergeant intended to pass on, as Bouroche had done. What, indeed,\r\ncould be the use of money to a dying man? Suddenly yielding, however,\r\nto a good-natured impulse, he dropped some coins, without counting\r\nthem, into the drummer\'s hands, which were already icy cold. \'For\r\nme! For me!\' gasped Bastian once more. He had fallen back again, and\r\nfumbled for some time with his stiffened fingers, endeavouring to\r\nrecover the gold which slipped from his grasp. Then he expired.\r\n\r\n\'Good night! The gent has blown his candle out!\' said a dark, lean,\r\nlittle Zouave, who was lying near by. \'It\'s vexing all the same, just\r\nas one\'s got the brass to pay for a drink.\'\r\n\r\nThe Zouave had his left foot bandaged; nevertheless he managed to raise\r\nhimself and crawl on his knees and elbows to the side of the corpse,\r\nwhen he picked up all the money, searching both the drummer\'s hands and\r\nthe folds of his great-coat. And noticing, when he had returned to his\r\nplace with the cash, that the others were looking at him, he contented\r\nhimself with remarking: \'Needn\'t let it be lost, eh?\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, whom this atmosphere of human misery suffocated, had made\r\nall haste to draw Jean outside again. As they were once more passing\r\nthrough the operating-shed they saw Bouroche there. He was exasperated\r\nat not having been able to procure any chloroform, but was all the same\r\nmaking up his mind to amputate the leg of a little fellow of twenty.\r\nJean and Maurice fled, so as not to hear the poor devil\'s shrieks.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Delaherche came in from the street, and waving his arm\r\nto them, called out: \'Come upstairs, come at once. We are going to\r\nhave some breakfast; the cook has managed to get some milk. It\'s very\r\nfortunate, for we need something warm.\'\r\n\r\nDespite the effort he was making, he could not conceal his exultant\r\ndelight, and as the others approached him, he lowered his voice and\r\nadded, with a radiant face: \'This time it\'s settled. General de\r\nWimpffen has gone back to sign the capitulation.\'\r\n\r\nAh! what an immense relief; his factory saved, the atrocious nightmare\r\ndissipated, life coming back again, full of pain and sorrow, no doubt;\r\nbut for all that life, yes, _life_! Nine o\'clock was now striking, and\r\nlittle Rose, whom he had met in the neighbourhood, had just told him\r\nwhat had taken place during the early morning at the Sub-Prefecture.\r\nShe had made her way to this part of the town, through the somewhat\r\nless crowded streets, with the view of trying to obtain some bread from\r\nan aunt, who kept a baker\'s shop. At eight o\'clock, said she, General\r\nde Wimpffen had assembled a fresh council of war, composed of more than\r\nthirty generals, whom he had informed of the result of the step he\r\nhad taken, of the futility of his efforts, and of the harsh exactions\r\nof the victorious enemy. His hands trembled whilst he described the\r\ninterview, violent emotion filled his eyes with tears; and he was still\r\nspeaking when a colonel of the Prussian staff presented himself as a\r\n_parlementaire_, in General von Moltke\'s name, with a reminder that if\r\na decision had not been come to by ten o\'clock the German fire would\r\nreopen on the town of Sedan. Thereupon, in this extreme, frightful\r\nnecessity, the council had adopted the only course that was open to it,\r\nthat of authorising General de Wimpffen to return to the ch\xc3\xa2teau of\r\nBellevue to accept everything. The general must have already arrived\r\nthere, and the entire French army was surrendering.\r\n\r\nRose next launched out into a variety of details concerning the\r\nextraordinary agitation which the news was exciting in the town. At the\r\nSub-Prefecture she had seen some officers tearing off their epaulettes,\r\nand bursting into tears like children. Cuirassiers flung their sabres\r\ninto the Meuse from the bridge, over which an entire regiment had\r\ndefiled, man after man throwing away his weapon and gazing on the water\r\nas it spurted and then closed up. In the streets, too, the soldiers\r\ntook hold of their chassepots by the barrels, and broke the butts\r\nagainst the house-walls, whilst artillerymen removed the pieces of\r\nmechanism from the mitrailleuses, and consigned them to the sewers.\r\nThere were some soldiers, also, who buried, and others who burned the\r\nflags. On the Place Turenne she had seen an old sergeant climb upon a\r\ncorner stone, and as though seized with sudden madness, heap insults\r\nupon the commanders and taunt them with cowardice. Other men seemed\r\nstultified and wept big silent tears. And, it must be said, there\r\nwere others, the greater number too, whose eyes smiled with gladness,\r\nwhose persons from head to foot denoted enraptured relief. So at last\r\nthere was to be an end to their misery; they were prisoners, and there\r\nwould be no more fighting. They had for so many days been suffering\r\nfrom excessive marching and lack of food. Besides, what was the use of\r\nfighting since they were not the stronger? So much the better if the\r\ncommanders _had_ sold them, so as to have done with the business at\r\nonce. It was so delightful to think that they would soon have white\r\nbread again and sleep in beds.\r\n\r\nAs Delaherche was entering the dining-room upstairs with Maurice and\r\nJean, his mother called him: \'Come here a moment. I\'m anxious about the\r\ncolonel.\'\r\n\r\nWith open eyes, M. de Vineuil was once more venting aloud the panting\r\ndream of his feverish delirium: \'What matters it? If the Prussians\r\ndo cut us off from M\xc3\xa9zi\xc3\xa8res----\' he gasped; \'here come some of them\r\nturning the wood of La Falizette, whilst others are coming up along\r\nthe valley of the Givonne. But the frontier is behind us, and we can\r\ncross it at a bound, as soon as we have killed as many of them as\r\npossible--that was what I wanted yesterday----\'\r\n\r\nHis ardent eyes, however, had just caught sight of Delaherche. He\r\nrecognised him, and seemed to come to his senses, to emerge from his\r\nhallucinatory somnolence; and as he thus returned to a consciousness of\r\nthe terrible reality, he asked for the third time; \'It\'s finished, eh?\'\r\n\r\nAnd this time, the manufacturer was quite unable to restrain the\r\noutburst of his satisfaction: \'Yes, thank heavens! quite finished! The\r\ncapitulation must now be signed.\'\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the colonel, despite his bandaged foot, rose violently\r\nfrom the bed, and taking his sword, which had remained lying on a\r\nchair, he made an effort to break it. But his hands were trembling, and\r\nthe blade slipped.\r\n\r\n\'Take care! he\'ll hurt himself,\' cried Delaherche. \'Take it out of his\r\nhands; it\'s dangerous!\'\r\n\r\nOld Madame Delaherche seized hold of the sword, but at sight of M. de\r\nVineuil\'s despair she did not hide it, as her son advised her to do.\r\nPutting forth strength extraordinary in one so old, and of which she\r\nherself would not have thought her poor hands capable, she broke it\r\nwith a sharp snap upon her knee. The colonel had got into bed again,\r\nand lay there weeping, and looking at his old friend with an expression\r\nof infinite tenderness.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the dining-room, the cook had served bowls of\r\n_caf\xc3\xa9-au-lait_ for everybody. Both Henriette and Gilberte were now\r\nawake, the latter well rested by her good sleep, and with a clear face\r\nand gay eyes. And tenderly did she kiss her friend, whom she pitied,\r\nso she said, from the very depths of her heart. Maurice placed himself\r\nnear his sister, whilst Jean, who had been pressed to stay, and who\r\nfelt somewhat embarrassed, found himself facing Delaherche. Old Madame\r\nDelaherche could not be prevailed upon to come and sit down at table,\r\nand merely drank a bowl of coffee which was taken to her. The breakfast\r\nof the five others, however, though begun in silence, soon became\r\nanimated. They were empty and very hungry, and how could they not\r\nfeel glad at finding themselves there, virtually unharmed and in good\r\nhealth, when thousands of poor devils were strewing the surrounding\r\ncountry? And in the large, cool dining-room, too, the spotless white\r\ntable-cloth was a joy for the eyes, whilst the _caf\xc3\xa9-au-lait_, which\r\nwas very hot, seemed exquisite.\r\n\r\nThey talked. Delaherche, who had already recovered all the assurance of\r\nthe rich manufacturer, the _bonhomie_ of the master fond of popularity,\r\nsevere only towards those who failed, reverted to Napoleon III., whose\r\nface had been haunting him for a couple of days past. And he addressed\r\nhimself to Jean, having only that artless fellow there. \'Ah! monsieur,\'\r\nhe began, \'yes, I can indeed say that the Emperor has greatly deceived\r\nme. For however much his incense-bearers may plead extenuating\r\ncircumstances, he is evidently the first cause, the only cause of our\r\ndisasters.\'\r\n\r\nHe was already forgetting that he had formerly shown himself an ardent\r\nBonapartist, and but a few months previously had done all he could to\r\ninsure the triumph of the Plebiscitum. And he no longer even pitied the\r\nfallen Sovereign who was about to become the Man of Sedan, but taxed\r\nhim with every iniquity.\r\n\r\n\'Absolutely incapable, as one is forced to recognise at the present\r\nmoment; still that by itself would be nothing--but his mind has always\r\nbeen addicted to chimeras; he\'s a man with an ill-proportioned brain,\r\nwith whom things seemed to succeed just so long as he had luck on his\r\nside. No; people mustn\'t try to make us pity his fate, by telling us\r\nthat he was deceived by others, and that the Opposition refused him the\r\nnecessary men and credits. It is he who has deceived us, whose vices\r\nand blunders have plunged us into the frightful mess in which we find\r\nourselves.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, who did not wish to take any part in the conversation, could\r\nnot restrain a smile, whilst Jean, whom this talk about politics\r\nrendered uncomfortable, and who feared that he might say something\r\nfoolish, contented himself with replying: \'Folks say, all the same,\r\nthat he\'s a good fellow.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, these few words, modestly spoken though they were, almost\r\nmade Delaherche leap from his seat. All the fright he had experienced,\r\nall the anguish he had undergone, burst forth in a cry of exasperated\r\npassion that had turned to hatred. \'A good fellow, indeed; that\'s\r\neasily said! Do you know, monsieur, that three shells fell here in\r\nmy factory, and that it wasn\'t the Emperor\'s fault if the buildings\r\nwere not burnt down? Do you know that I who speak to you, I shall lose\r\na hundred thousand francs in this idiotic affair? Ah! no, no, it is\r\naltogether too much--France invaded, burnt, exterminated, industry at\r\na standstill, trade destroyed! We\'ve had quite enough of such a good\r\nfellow as that, Heaven preserve us from him! He\'s down in the mud and\r\nthe blood, and I say let him stay there!\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he made an energetic gesture with his fist as though he\r\nwere pushing down some struggling wretch and keeping him under water.\r\nThen, with a greedy lip, he finished drinking his coffee. Gilberte\r\nhad given vent to a slight involuntary laugh at sight of the painful\r\nabstractedness of Henriette, whom she served like a child. The meal\r\ncontinued till at last the bowls were emptied; still they did not\r\nstir, preferring to linger awhile amid the gladsome peacefulness of\r\nthat large, cool room.\r\n\r\nAnd at that same hour Napoleon III. was in the weaver\'s poor house on\r\nthe Donchery road. Already at five in the morning he had insisted upon\r\nleaving the Sub-Prefecture, ill at ease at feeling Sedan encompassing\r\nhim, like a reproach and a threat; still worried, moreover, by a desire\r\nto soothe his sensitive heart by obtaining more favourable terms for\r\nhis unfortunate army. He wished to see the King of Prussia. So, getting\r\ninto a hired calash, he had set out along the broad highway, bordered\r\nwith lofty poplars, that first portion of his journey into exile,\r\naccomplished in the freshness of the dawn, with a consciousness of all\r\nthe fallen grandeur that he was leaving behind him in his flight; and\r\nit was upon that road that he met Bismarck hastening to him, in an old\r\nflat cap and long greased boots, for the sole purpose of trifling with\r\nhim and preventing him from seeing the King until the capitulation\r\nwas signed. The King was still at Vendresse, eight and a half miles\r\naway. Where should he go? Where could he wait? Afar off, the palace\r\nof the Tuileries had disappeared, enveloped in a thundercloud. Sedan,\r\ntoo, already seemed to have receded a distance of many leagues, shut\r\noff, as it were, by a river of blood. There were no more imperial\r\nch\xc3\xa2teaux in France, no more official residences; there was not even a\r\ncorner in the abode of the smallest functionary where he dared to go\r\nand seat himself. And it was in the weaver\'s house that he was minded\r\nto strand--the wretched house espied beside the road, with its narrow\r\nkitchen-garden skirted by a hedge, and comprising merely a ground-floor\r\nand one upper storey with mournful little windows. The room upstairs\r\nhad whitewashed walls and a tiled floor, and its only furniture was a\r\ndeal table and two straw-bottomed chairs. There he waited for hours,\r\nat first in the company of Bismarck, who smiled on hearing him talk of\r\ngenerosity, and then all alone, dragging his misery up and down the\r\nroom, pressing his ashy face to the window-panes, and gazing once more\r\nupon that soil of France, that Meuse which looked so beautiful as it\r\nflowed along athwart vast, fertile fields.[35]\r\n\r\nThen that day, the next day, and the following days, there came\r\nthe other abominable marches and their halting places: the ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nof Bellevue, that smiling _bourgeois_ country-seat overlooking the\r\nriver, where he slept, and where he wept after his interview with\r\nKing William; then the cruel departure, Sedan avoided for fear of the\r\nvanquished and the famished, the pontoon bridge, which the Prussians\r\nhad thrown across the river at Iges, the long circuit on the northern\r\nside of the town, the by-ways, the remote roads of Floing, Fleigneux,\r\nand Illy--all that lamentable flight in the open calash; and there,\r\non that tragic, corpse-strewn plateau of Illy, occurred the legendary\r\nmeeting--the wretched Emperor, no longer able to endure the motion\r\nof the vehicle, sinking down under the violence of some spasm, maybe\r\nmechanically smoking his everlasting cigarette, whilst a flock of\r\nhaggard, blood-and-dust-covered prisoners, whom their captors were\r\nescorting from Fleigneux to Sedan, ranged themselves at the edge of\r\nthe road to allow the carriage to pass; the first ones silent, the\r\nnext ones growling, and the others, beyond, growing more and more\r\nexasperated until they burst into jeers and brandished their fists\r\nwith gestures of insult and malediction. And after that there was yet\r\nthe interminable journey across other portions of the battlefield, a\r\nleague of broken-up roads, past ruins, and corpses with widely opened,\r\nthreatening eyes; and then came a bare stretch of country with vast,\r\nsilent woods, and the frontier atop of an incline; and beyond it the\r\nend of everything--a dip into a narrow valley where the road was edged\r\nwith pines.\r\n\r\nAnd what a first night of exile that was at Bouillon, in an inn,\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de la Poste, where he found himself amid such a throng\r\nof mere sightseers and French refugees that he deemed it proper to\r\nshow himself, whereat there was loud murmuring and hissing! The\r\nroom, with its three windows overlooking the Place and the Semoy,\r\nwas the commonplace hotel-room, with the usual chairs upholstered\r\nin red damask, the usual mahogany wardrobe with a plate-glass door,\r\nthe mantelshelf decked with the usual zinc clock, flanked by shells\r\nand vases of artificial flowers under glass cases. Right and left\r\nof the door were two little fellow beds. In one of them slept an\r\naide-de-camp, so overcome by fatigue that at nine o\'clock he was\r\nalready sound asleep. In the other one the Emperor must have turned\r\nand turned for hours, unable to close his eyes; and if he got up to\r\nassuage his sufferings by walking, his only diversion can have been\r\nto look at two engravings, hanging on the wall there, on either side\r\nof the chimney-piece--one representing Rouget de l\'Isle singing the\r\nMarseillaise; the other, the Day of Judgment, the mighty call sounded\r\nby the trumps of the Archangels, drawing all the dead from the bosom\r\nof the earth, the resurrection of the ossuaries of the battlefields,\r\nascending to testify before God.[36]\r\n\r\nAll the train of the Imperial household, the cumbersome, accursed\r\nbaggage vans, had remained at Sedan, in distress behind the\r\nsub-prefect\'s lilac bushes. Those in charge were at a loss how to\r\nspirit them away, how to remove them safely from the sight of the poor\r\nfolks dying of misery, so intolerable indeed became the aggressive\r\ninsolence which they had assumed, the frightful irony with which\r\nthe defeat had imbued them. A very dark night had to be waited for,\r\nand then the horses, the carriages, and the vans, with their silver\r\nsaucepans, their spits, and their baskets of fine wines, went forth\r\nfrom Sedan with great mystery, and in their turn betook themselves to\r\nBelgium, journeying with muffled tread and roll along the dark roads\r\namid an uneasy shivering, such as attends a theft.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n_WOE TO THE VANQUISHED!_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSILVINE\'S QUEST--AMONG THE SLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid the smoke and thunder of the cannonade, during the interminable\r\nday of the battle, Silvine, quivering from head to foot at thought\r\nof Honor\xc3\xa9, had not ceased gazing towards Sedan from that hill of\r\nRemilly, where stood old Fouchard\'s little farm. And on the morrow her\r\nanxiety had increased, augmented by the impossibility of obtaining any\r\naccurate tidings from the Prussians guarding the roads, who refused to\r\nanswer any questions, being, moreover, themselves ignorant of what was\r\nhappening. The bright sunshine of the previous day had disappeared,\r\nshowers had fallen, and the valley now wore a gloomy aspect in the\r\nlivid light.\r\n\r\nTowards evening old Fouchard, who, in his intentional silence, was\r\nalso feeling worried, though he thought but little of his son, being\r\nindeed more anxious to know how the misfortunes of others would\r\naffect himself, was standing on his threshold waiting for something\r\nto turn up, when he noticed a big fellow in a blouse, who had been\r\nprowling along the road for a moment or so with an embarrassed air. On\r\nrecognising him, the old man\'s surprise was so intense, that although\r\nthree Prussians were passing at the time he called in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\'Hullo, Prosper! Is it you?\'\r\n\r\nWith an energetic wave of the arm the Chasseur d\'Afrique abruptly\r\nsilenced him. Then, drawing near, he answered in an undertone:\r\n\'Yes, it\'s I. I\'ve had quite enough of fighting for nothing, so I\r\nskedaddled--and, I say, father Fouchard, you don\'t want a farm-hand, do\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\nAt this the old man immediately regained all his prudent reserve. It so\r\nhappened that he did want somebody, but it would not serve his purpose\r\nto say so. \'A hand? Why, no--not just now. But come inside all the\r\nsame, and drink a glass of wine. I\'m not going to leave you on the road\r\nlike that.\'\r\n\r\nIn the living-room was Silvine, just setting the _soupe_ on the fire,\r\nwith little Charlot laughing and frolicking, and hanging to her skirts.\r\nShe did not at first recognise Prosper, although he had formerly been\r\nin service with her; but, in fact, it was only on bringing a couple\r\nof glasses and a bottle of wine that she took a good look at him; and\r\nthen she at once raised a cry, and, with thoughts only for Honor\xc3\xa9,\r\nexclaimed: \'Ah! you\'ve come back from it, haven\'t you? Is Honor\xc3\xa9 all\r\nright?\'\r\n\r\nProsper was on the point of answering when he hesitated. For two days\r\npast he had been living in a dream, amid a violent succession of\r\nill-defined events which had left no precise impression on his memory.\r\nHe certainly thought that he had seen Honor\xc3\xa9 stretched dead upon a\r\ncannon, but he would not have sworn it; and why should he grieve folks\r\nwhen he was not certain? \'Honor\xc3\xa9,\' he muttered, \'I don\'t know, I can\'t\r\nsay.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him fixedly and insisted: \'Then you haven\'t seen him?\'\r\n\r\nShaking his head, and slowly waving his hands, he answered: \'You are\r\nmistaken if you think one can be certain of anything. So many things\r\nhappened, so many things! Why, of all that cursed battle I couldn\'t\r\ntell you so long, even to save my life! No, not even tell the places\r\nI passed through. \'Pon my word it makes one an idiot.\' He drank a\r\nglass of wine and remained sitting there, quite downcast, with dreamy\r\neyes peering, as it were, into the depths of his memory. \'All I can\r\nremember,\' he resumed, \'is that night was already falling when I\r\nrecovered consciousness. The sun was still high up in the sky when I\r\nfell, whilst we were charging. I must have been lying there for hours\r\nwith my right leg caught under poor Zephyr, who had been hit full in\r\nthe chest. There was nothing at all pleasant, I can assure you, in\r\nmy position, with heaps of dead comrades round me, and not so much\r\nas a live cat to be seen, and with the prospect, too, of kicking the\r\nbucket myself if nobody came to pick me up. I tried ever so gently to\r\nrelease my thigh, but it was no go, Zephyr was as heavy as five hundred\r\nthousand devils. He was still warm. I fondled him, called him, spoke\r\nendearing words to him, and then something happened, do you know, that\r\nI shall never forget. He opened his eyes and tried to raise his poor\r\nhead, which was lying on the ground beside mine. And we had a chat\r\ntogether. \'My poor old fellow,\' I said to him, \'I don\'t say it to\r\nreproach you, but is it because you want me to kick the bucket with you\r\nthat you hold me down so tight?\' Of course he didn\'t answer yes, but,\r\nall the same, I read in his eyes the grief he felt at leaving me. And\r\nI don\'t know how it happened, whether he did it on purpose, or whether\r\nit was only a convulsion, but he gave a sudden start which threw him\r\non one side. And I was then able to get up, ah! in a fearful state,\r\nwith my leg as heavy as lead. But no matter, I took Zephyr\'s head in\r\nmy arms and went on talking to him, telling him all my heart could\r\nthink of--that he was a good horse, and that I was very fond of him and\r\nshould always remember him. He listened to me and seemed so pleased!\r\nThen he gave another start and died; his big eyes, which hadn\'t ceased\r\nlooking at me, became quite blank all at once. It\'s funny, too, and\r\nyou won\'t believe me, but the plain truth is he had big tears in his\r\neyes--my poor Zephyr, he wept as though he were one of us.\'\r\n\r\nWeeping himself, almost choking with grief, Prosper had to pause.\r\nHe drank another glass of wine and then resumed his narrative in\r\nimperfect, disjointed phrases. Night had drawn in, only a red ray of\r\nlight had remained, on a level with the battlefield, throwing the giant\r\nshadows of the dead horses far over the ground. He, no doubt, had for\r\na long time remained with Zephyr, unable to depart on account of the\r\nheaviness of his leg. Then he had been set on his feet by a sudden\r\nsensation of terror, a pressing desire to remain alone no longer, but\r\nto find himself again among some comrades in order that he might feel\r\nless afraid. In this wise the forgotten wounded had dragged themselves\r\nalong from the ditches, the bushes, all the lonely nooks on every side,\r\nsearching for companionship, gathering together in groups, little\r\nparties of four or five, for it seemed to them less hard to suffer and\r\ndie in company. And in this wise too, Prosper, whilst hobbling through\r\nthe wood of La Garenne, fell in with two soldiers of the 43rd, who had\r\nnot received so much as a scratch, but had hidden themselves there\r\nlike hares, waiting for the night. On learning that he knew the road\r\nthey explained their idea to him, which was to escape into Belgium,\r\nmaking their way to the frontier, through the woods, before daylight.\r\nHe at first refused to guide them, for he would rather have betaken\r\nhimself direct to Remilly, certain as he was that he would find an\r\nasylum there. But how could he procure a blouse and trousers? Besides\r\nhow could he hope to get past the numerous Prussian pickets between the\r\nwood of La Garenne and Remilly? He would have had to cross the entire\r\nvalley. So he finally consented to guide his two comrades. His leg\r\nhaving become inflamed they halted at a farm to let him rest, and were\r\nlucky enough to obtain some bread there. Nine o\'clock was striking from\r\na distant steeple when they set out again. The only serious danger in\r\nwhich they found themselves was at La Chapelle, where they fell into\r\nthe midst of a hostile picket-guard, which rushed to arms and fired\r\ninto the darkness whilst they, on their side, threw themselves on their\r\nstomachs, crawled and galloped along on all fours beneath the whizzing\r\nbullets. After that experience they did not again venture out of the\r\nwoods, but groped along, with fumbling hands and ears on the alert,\r\nuntil at the turn of a path they crawled up stealthily and sprang upon\r\nthe shoulders of a forlorn sentinel whose throat they ripped open with\r\na knife. And then the roads proved free and they continued on their\r\nway, laughing and whistling. At about three in the morning they reached\r\na little Belgian village, where a good-natured farmer on being aroused\r\nat once opened his barn, in which they fell sound asleep upon trusses\r\nof hay.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already high when Prosper awoke. On opening his eyes he\r\nfound his comrades still snoring and perceived the farmer harnessing a\r\nhorse to a large tilted cart, laden with bread, rice, coffee, sugar,\r\nall sorts of provisions in fact, hidden underneath sacks of charcoal.\r\nAnd he learnt that the worthy fellow had two married daughters at\r\nRaucourt in France, to whom he was about to take these provisions,\r\nknowing them to be absolutely destitute since the Bavarians had passed\r\nthrough the town. He had obtained the safe-conduct necessary for his\r\npurpose early that morning.\r\n\r\nProsper was at once seized with an uncontrollable desire to share\r\nthe cart seat with the farmer, and return to that secluded spot over\r\nyonder, nostalgia for which was already filling his heart with anguish.\r\nIt was all so simple--he would alight at Remilly through which the\r\nfarmer must needs pass. And in three minutes it was settled, the\r\ncoveted trousers and blouse were lent to him, the farmer gave out\r\neverywhere that he was his man, and at about six in the evening he\r\nalighted in front of the village church, having only been stopped some\r\ntwo or three times on the road by the Prussian pickets.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I\'d had enough of it,\' Prosper repeated after a pause. \'If they\r\nhad only put us to some use, like over yonder, in Algeria; but to be\r\nalways cantering up and down doing nothing, to feel that one serves no\r\nearthly purpose--all that ends by becoming unbearable. Besides, now\r\nthat my poor Zephyr\'s dead I should be all alone. The only thing I can\r\ndo is to go back to the fields. That\'s better than being a prisoner of\r\nthe Prussians, eh? You have some horses, father Fouchard, you shall see\r\nif I\'m fond of them and can take care of them?\'\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s eyes glistened. He chinked glasses again, and without any\r\nshow of eagerness, completed the business: \'Well, as it will be doing\r\nyou a service, I\'ll agree to it--I\'ll take you. But as to wages, you\r\nmustn\'t talk of them, mind, till the war\'s over, for I really don\'t\r\nneed any one, and the times are so hard.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Silvine, seated with Charlot on her lap, had not taken her\r\neyes off Prosper; and, now, on seeing him rise with the intention of\r\ngoing to the stables to make the acquaintance of the horses there, she\r\nonce more asked him: \'And so you haven\'t seen Honor\xc3\xa9?\'\r\n\r\nThis question, so abruptly repeated, made Prosper start, as though it\r\nhad suddenly thrown a flood of light upon a dim corner of his memory.\r\nHe once more hesitated, but finally decided to speak out: \'Well, I\r\ndidn\'t want to grieve you just now,\' said he, \'but I fancy Honor\xc3\xa9 must\r\nhave remained yonder-----\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I think the Prussians did for him--I saw him lying back on a\r\ncannon, with his head raised and a hole just below his heart.\'\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Silvine had become frightfully pale, and old Fouchard,\r\nquite thunderstruck, set his glass, which he had just filled with the\r\nwine remaining in the bottle, upon the table again. \'You are sure of\r\nthat?\' the young woman asked in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n\'Well, as sure as one can be of anything one sees. It was on a little\r\nhillock just beside three trees, and it seems to me I could go there\r\nwith my eyes shut.\'\r\n\r\nTo her it seemed as though everything had crumbled away. Her lover,\r\nwho had forgiven her, who had bound himself to her by a promise, whom\r\nshe was to have married as soon as he got his discharge at the end of\r\nthe war! And now they had killed him, and he was lying yonder with a\r\nhole below his heart! Never before had she felt such love for him. So\r\nintense was her desire to gaze upon him again, and, despite everything,\r\nsecure him for herself even beneath the sod, that she was thoroughly\r\naroused from her customary passivity. Roughly setting Charlot on the\r\nfloor, she exclaimed: \'Well, I myself will only believe it when I\'ve\r\nseen it. Since you know where it is, you shall take me there. And if\r\nit\'s true, if we find him, we\'ll bring him back here.\'\r\n\r\nTears were stifling her, and she sank upon the table, quivering with\r\nprolonged sobs, whilst the child, stupefied at being so roughly treated\r\nby his mother, likewise burst into tears. Then taking the little\r\none in her arms again and pressing him to her heart she stammered\r\ndistractedly: \'My poor child! my poor child!\'\r\n\r\nOld Fouchard was still in a state of consternation. Despite\r\nappearances, he was, in his own fashion, attached to his son. Old\r\nmemories must have come back to him from long, long ago, from the days\r\nwhen his wife was living, when Honor\xc3\xa9 still went to school, for two big\r\ntears welled from his red eyes and coursed down the tanned parchment of\r\nhis cheeks. He had not wept for ten years or more. Then oaths escaped\r\nhis lips, and he ended by getting quite angry respecting that son of\r\nhis whom he would never see again: \'Curse it! It upsets a man--to have\r\nbut one lad, and for them to kill him.\'\r\n\r\nWhen some measure of calmness had returned, however, Fouchard was\r\nextremely annoyed at finding that Silvine still talked of going over\r\nyonder in search of Honor\xc3\xa9\'s body. Without further lamentation,\r\npreserving indeed a despairing, invincible silence, she persisted in\r\nher resolve; and he no longer knew her, usually so docile, performing\r\nany task assigned to her without complaint, whereas now those large,\r\nsubmissive eyes of hers, which sufficed for the beauty of her face, had\r\nacquired an expression of fierce decision, whilst her brow remained\r\npale, as with the pallor of death, beneath her mass of thick dark\r\nhair. She had already torn a red wrapper from her shoulders and went\r\nto dress herself in black from head to foot, like a widow. In vain did\r\nFouchard dwell upon the difficulty of the search, the dangers which she\r\nwould be exposed to, the faint hope there was of finding the body. No\r\nmatter, she even ceased answering him at last, and he realised that\r\nshe would go off of her own accord and do something rash if he did not\r\ntake steps in the matter, a prospect which disquieted him the more as\r\ntrouble might ensue with the German authorities. Accordingly he made up\r\nhis mind to go and see the mayor of Remilly, who was a distant cousin\r\nof his, and between them they concocted a plausible story: Silvine was\r\nsaid to be Honor\xc3\xa9\'s widow, and Prosper passed as being her brother, so\r\nthat the Bavarian colonel, quartered at the Cross-of-Malta inn below\r\nthe village, willingly drew up a safe-conduct, authorising the brother\r\nand sister to bring back the husband\'s body provided they could find\r\nit. By this time night had drawn in, and the only thing to which the\r\nyoung woman would consent was to defer the journey until sunrise.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Fouchard would not allow a horse to be put to one of\r\nhis large carts, for fear lest he should never see either beast or\r\nvehicle again. Who could tell, indeed, whether the Prussians would\r\nnot confiscate them both? At last, however, he consented, with an ill\r\ngrace, to lend a little grey donkey and its cart, which, though small,\r\nwas yet large enough to carry a corpse. At great length he then gave\r\ninstructions to Prosper, who, although he had slept well, seemed very\r\nthoughtful and anxious. Now that, rested and freed from excitement,\r\nhe tried to remember the spot where he had seen Honor\xc3\xa9 lying, he\r\ndoubted whether he would be able to find it, and the prospect of this\r\nexpedition disturbed him. At the last moment Silvine went to fetch the\r\nblanket from her own bed, folded it up, and laid it in the cart; and\r\nshe was already starting, when she ran back to kiss little Charlot:\r\n\'I leave him in your care, father Fouchard; mind that he doesn\'t get\r\nplaying with the lucifers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, you needn\'t be anxious.\'\r\n\r\nThe preparations had lasted a long time, and it was nearly seven\r\no\'clock when Silvine and Prosper descended the steep slopes of Remilly\r\nbehind the narrow cart which the little grey donkey drew along with its\r\nhead hanging low. It had rained heavily during the night, the roads\r\nwere like rivers of mud, and large livid patches of cloud were scudding\r\nacross the gloomy sky.\r\n\r\nDesirous of taking the shortest route, Prosper had adopted the idea of\r\npassing through Sedan. Before reaching Pont-Maugis, however, the cart\r\nwas stopped and detained during more than an hour by a Prussian picket,\r\nand only when the _laissez-passer_ had circulated among four or five\r\nofficers was the donkey able to resume its journey, it being stipulated\r\nthat the party should make the round by way of Bazeilles, which was\r\nreached by a cross-road on the left. No reason was assigned for this\r\nstipulation, but doubtless the officers wished to avoid increasing the\r\ncrush which prevailed in the town. Whilst Silvine was crossing the\r\nMeuse, over the railway bridge, that fatal bridge which the French had\r\nneglected to blow up, and for which, albeit, the Bavarians had paid so\r\nterrible a price, she espied the corpse of an artilleryman coming down\r\nstream with the current, in a sauntering sort of way. Caught by a tuft\r\nof herbage, it remained for a moment motionless, then suddenly swung\r\nround and started off again.\r\n\r\nBazeilles, which the donkey crossed at a walk from end to end, was a\r\npicture of destruction, of all the abominable havoc that devastating\r\nwar can wreak when with the fury of a blizzard it sweeps through a\r\nland. The dead had already been picked up, not a single corpse remained\r\non the paved highway of the village, and the rain was washing away the\r\nblood. Some puddles, however, were still quite red, and beside them\r\nlay suspicious remnants, things which looked like shreds of flesh,\r\nwith what seemed to be hair adhering to them. But the appalment which\r\nfroze every heart came from the sight of the ruins--the ruins of that\r\nvillage which three days previously had worn such a smiling aspect\r\nwith its pleasant houses girt with gardens, and which now had crumbled\r\nto the ground, annihilated, displaying but scraps of walls blackened\r\nby the flames. The church, a huge funeral pile of smoking beams, was\r\nstill burning in the centre of the Place, whence arose a stout column\r\nof black smoke which spread out on high like a great tuft of mourning\r\nplumes above a hearse. Entire streets had disappeared, nothing remained\r\non either hand--nothing but piles of calcined stones fringing the\r\ngutters amid a mass of soot and cinders, a thick, inky mud, which\r\nspread over everything. At the various crossways the corner houses\r\nhad been razed to the ground, carried away as it were by the fiery\r\nblast which had blown past these spots. Other houses had suffered less\r\ngrievously, one had by chance remained standing, isolated; whilst those\r\non its right and left seemed to have been hacked by shrapnel, their\r\nupreared carcases resembling gaunt skeletons. And everything exhaled an\r\nunbearable stench, the nauseating smell of fire, especially the acrid\r\nodour of the petroleum with which the floorings had been deluged. Then,\r\ntoo, there was the mute desolation of the household goods which the\r\nvillagers had tried to save, the poor articles of furniture that had\r\nbeen flung from the windows and shattered by their fall; the crippled\r\ntables with broken legs, the wardrobes with their sides ripped open\r\nand their chests rent asunder, the linen, too, lying here and there,\r\ntorn and soiled, with all the woeful residue of the pillage melting\r\naway in the rain. And, on glancing behind one gaping house-front and\r\nbetween some fallen flooring, one could espy a clock standing upon a\r\nmantelpiece that still adhered to the wall of an upper storey.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the brutes!\' growled Prosper, whose soldier\'s blood rose hotly to\r\nhis brain at sight of such abomination.\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fist, and Silvine, herself very pale, had to quiet him\r\nwith a glance each time that they came upon a sentry by the roadside.\r\nThe Bavarians had indeed placed sentinels near the houses which were\r\nstill burning, and these men, with fixed bayonets and loaded guns,\r\nseemed to be protecting the fires in order that the flames might\r\ncomplete their work. With a threatening gesture, a guttural cry when\r\nhe had to deal with any obstinate person, the sentry drove back both\r\nthe mere sightseers and the interested parties who were prowling\r\naround. Clusters of villagers had collected at a distance and stood\r\nthere in silence, looking on and quivering with restrained rage. One\r\nwoman, quite young, with dishevelled hair and in a mud-stained dress,\r\nobstinately remained in front of the heaped-up, smoking remnants of a\r\nlittle house, the live cinders of which she wished to search although\r\nthe sentinel sternly forbade her approach. It was said that this\r\nwoman\'s little child had been burnt to death in the house. And, all at\r\nonce, as the Bavarian brutally pushed her aside, she turned round and\r\nspat all her furious despair in his face, assailing him with insults\r\nwhich reeked of blood and filth, foul, obscene words which eased her\r\nfeelings. He probably did not understand her, but falling back gazed at\r\nher with an uneasy air until three of his comrades ran up and freed him\r\nfrom the woman, whom they dragged away, howling. A man and two little\r\ngirls, who, all three, had fallen on the ground from sheer fatigue and\r\nwretchedness, were sobbing in front of the ruins of another house, not\r\nknowing where to go, having indeed seen all they possessed fly away\r\nin smoke and cinders. A patrol, however, came along and dispersed the\r\nvillagers, and then the road again became deserted save for the stern,\r\ngloomy sentinels, who glanced vigilantly to right and left intent upon\r\nenforcing their iniquitous orders.\r\n\r\n\'The brutes! the brutes!\' repeated Prosper in a low growl. \'It would be\r\na treat to strangle a few of them.\'\r\n\r\nSilvine again silenced him. She was shuddering. A dog, shut up in a\r\ncart-house spared by the fire, forgotten there for a couple of days\r\npast, was howling, raising a continuous plaint, so doleful that a\r\nkind of terror sped athwart the low hanging sky whence some fine\r\ngrey rain had just begun to fall. And at that moment, whilst passing\r\nthe park of Montivilliers, they came upon a ghastly spectacle; three\r\nlarge tumbrels laden with corpses were standing there, one behind the\r\nother--scavengers\' tumbrels, into which, as they pass along the streets\r\nof a morning, it is customary to shovel all the refuse of the previous\r\nday; and in a like manner they had now been filled with corpses;\r\nstopping each time that a body was flung into them, and starting\r\noff again with a great rumbling of wheels to halt once more farther\r\non--in this wise scouring the whole of Bazeilles, until they fairly\r\noverflowed with heaped-up corpses. And now, motionless, by the wayside,\r\nthey were waiting to be taken to the public \'shoot,\' the neighbouring\r\ncharnel-place. Feet protruded from them, upreared in the air; and a\r\nhead, half-severed from the trunk, hung over the side of one of the\r\nvehicles. And when the three tumbrels again set out, jolting along\r\nthrough the puddles, a long, livid, pendent hand began rubbing against\r\none of the wheels, which in its revolutions gradually wore it away,\r\nstripped it first of its skin, and then consumed it to the bone.\r\n\r\nThe rain ceased falling when they reached the village of Balan, where\r\nProsper prevailed on Silvine to eat some bread, which he had taken the\r\nprecaution to bring with him. It was already eleven o\'clock. As they\r\nwere drawing near to Sedan they were stopped by another Prussian post,\r\nand, this time, there was a terrible to-do, for the officer in command\r\nflew into a passion and even refused to return the _laissez-passer_,\r\nwhich, speaking in perfect French, he declared to be a forgery. By\r\nhis orders some soldiers pushed the donkey and the little cart under\r\na shed. What was to be done? How were they to continue their journey?\r\nSilvine was in despair, when an idea came to her on recollecting cousin\r\nDubreuil, that well-to-do relative of old Fouchard\'s, with whom she was\r\nacquainted, and whose residence, the Hermitage, was only a few hundred\r\nyards away, beyond the lanes overlooking the suburb. Perhaps the German\r\nofficer might listen to a man of means like him. So, leaving the\r\ndonkey, she took Prosper with her, for the officer contented himself\r\nwith impounding the vehicle and the moke, and allowed the young couple\r\nto go free. They ran on and found the gate of the Hermitage wide open,\r\nand as they entered the avenue of ancient elms they were greatly\r\nastonished by a spectacle which they descried in the distance. \'The\r\ndeuce!\' said Prosper, \'here are some fellows having a high time of it!\'\r\n\r\nA joyous party appeared to be assembled on the fine gravel of the\r\nterrace, below the house-steps. Some arm-chairs and a sofa, upholstered\r\nin sky-blue satin, were ranged around a table with a marble top, thus\r\nforming a strange, open-air drawing-room, which the rain must have\r\nbeen drenching since the day before. A couple of Zouaves, wallowing\r\nat either end of the sofa, appeared to be splitting with laughter;\r\nwhilst a little Linesman, leaning forward in an arm-chair, looked as\r\nthough he were holding his sides. All three had their elbows resting\r\nin a nonchalant way on the arms of their seats; whilst a Chasseur was\r\nholding out his hand as though to take a glass from the table. They had\r\napparently emptied the cellar, and were having a spree.\r\n\r\n\'How is it they are still here?\' muttered Prosper, becoming more and\r\nmore stupefied as he drew nearer. \'The devils! are they doing this to\r\nshow their contempt for the Prussians?\'\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, Silvine, whose eyes were dilating, shrieked and\r\nmade a gesture of horror. The soldiers did not stir--they were dead!\r\nThe two Zouaves, stiffened and with twisted hands, had no faces left\r\nthem; their noses had been torn off, their eyes driven out of their\r\nsockets. The laugh of the Linesman who was holding his sides, was\r\ndue to a bullet which had split his lips, breaking his teeth. And\r\natrocious, indeed, was the sight which these poor wretches presented,\r\nseated there, as though chatting together, in the rigid postures of\r\nlay figures, with their eyes glassy, and their mouths wide open, each\r\nand all of them icy cold and for ever motionless. Had they, whilst yet\r\nalive, dragged themselves to that spot that they might die together?\r\nWas it the Prussians, who, by way of a grim joke, had picked them up\r\nand seated them there in a convivial circle, as though in derision of\r\nFrench gaiety?\r\n\r\n\'A queer amusement all the same,\' resumed Prosper, turning pale. And\r\nlooking at the other corpses strewn across the avenue, beneath the\r\ntrees and over the lawns, at the thirty brave fellows or so among whom\r\nlay Lieutenant Rochas, riddled with bullets and swathed in the colours\r\nof his regiment, the Chasseur added with a serious, almost reverential\r\nair: \'There\'s been some hard fighting here. I hardly think we shall\r\nmeet the gentleman you want to find.\'\r\n\r\nSilvine was already entering the house, through whose shattered windows\r\nand gaping doorways the damp atmosphere freely penetrated. Evidently\r\nenough, there was nobody there; the occupants must have gone away prior\r\nto the battle. However, she obstinately made her way to the kitchen,\r\nand on entering it again raised a cry of fright. Two bodies had rolled\r\nunder the sink--a Zouave, a well-built man with a black beard, and a\r\nbrawny Prussian with red hair. They were locked together in a savage\r\nembrace; the Frenchman\'s teeth had bitten into the German\'s cheek, and\r\ntheir stiffened arms had in no degree relaxed their grasp, but were\r\nstill bending and cracking each other\'s broken spine, uniting them both\r\nin such an intricate knot of everlasting fury, that they must needs be\r\nburied together.\r\n\r\nSince there was nothing they could do in that empty house, which death\r\nalone now tenanted, Prosper made all haste to lead Silvine away. On\r\nreturning, in despair, to the outpost where the donkey and the cart\r\nhad been detained, they were lucky enough to find there a general who\r\nwas visiting the battlefield. He wished to see the _laissez-passer_\r\nwhich the stern officer commanding the post had confiscated, and having\r\nread it he returned it to Silvine with a gesture of commiseration, as\r\nthough to say that this poor woman should be allowed to go on her way\r\nin search of her husband\'s body. Thereupon, without tarrying, she and\r\nher companion, followed by the little cart, went off towards the Fond\r\nde Givonne, permission to pass through Sedan having been again refused\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left in view of reaching the plateau of Illy by\r\nthe road passing through the wood of La Garenne. But here again they\r\nwere delayed, and a score of times did they despair of getting through\r\nthe wood, so many were the obstacles they met with. At every step the\r\ntrees, cut down by the shells, barred the road like fallen giants.\r\nThis, indeed, was the bombarded forest, through which as through some\r\nsquare of the Old Guard of steadfast, veteran firmness, the cannonade\r\nhad swept, destroying venerable lives. On all sides were prostrate\r\ntrunks, stripped, pitted, rent like human breasts. This scene of\r\ndestruction, with its multitude of massacred branches shedding tears\r\nof sap, was fraught with the same heartrending horror as a field of\r\nhuman battle. And there were also corpses; the corpses of soldiers who\r\nhad fallen beside the trees as by the side of comrades. A lieutenant\r\nwas lying there, with his mouth quite bloody and with both hands still\r\nclawing the soil and tearing up tufts of grass. Farther on a captain\r\nhad passed away, stretched upon his stomach, and with his head upraised\r\nto bellow forth his pain. Others seemed to be sleeping among the\r\nbushes, whilst a Zouave, whose blue sash had caught fire, had had his\r\nbeard and hair entirely burnt. And all along the narrow woodland road,\r\nit repeatedly became necessary to push the corpses on one side so that\r\nthe donkey might continue on its way.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, on reaching a little valley, the horror came to\r\nan end. The battle had, doubtless, taken another direction, leaving\r\nthis delightful nook unscathed. Not a twig of the trees had been\r\nbroken, not a drop of blood had stained the moss. A beck flowed past\r\nthrough duckweed, and lofty beech trees shaded the path which skirted\r\nit. With the freshness of the running water, the quivering silence\r\nof the greenery, the spot was fraught with a penetrating charm, an\r\nadorable peacefulness.\r\n\r\nProsper stopped the donkey in order that it might drink from the\r\nstream. \'Ah! how pleasant it is here!\' he said, thus spontaneously\r\ngiving expression to his relief.\r\n\r\nSilvine glanced around her with astonished eyes, anxious at finding\r\nthat she also felt refreshed and almost happy. Why should this secluded\r\nnook wear such an aspect of peaceful felicity when all was mourning\r\nand suffering around it? She made a despairing, eager gesture. \'Quick!\r\nquick! let us get on. Where is it? Where did you see Honor\xc3\xa9?\'\r\n\r\nFifty yards farther on, as they at last arrived at the plateau of Illy,\r\nthe level plain suddenly spread itself out before them. This time\r\nthey had come to the real battlefield, the bare expanse of country\r\nstretching away to the horizon under the great wan sky, whence frequent\r\nshowers were streaming. No heaps of dead were to be seen. All the\r\nGermans must have been already buried, for not one of them remained\r\namong the scattered corpses of the French strewn along the roads,\r\nover the stubbles, and in the hollows, according to the phases of the\r\nstruggle. The first corpse they came upon was that of a sergeant, a\r\nsuperb, sturdy young fellow whose face was peaceful, with parted lips\r\nwhich seemed to be smiling. A hundred paces farther on, however, they\r\nsaw another corpse lying across the road and this was frightfully\r\nmutilated, with the head half carried away and the shoulders splashed\r\nwith brain-matter. Then, after passing the solitary corpses, they came\r\nupon little clusters of dead here and there. They saw seven kneeling\r\nin a line, with their guns raised to their shoulders, who had been\r\nshot dead whilst in the act of firing; whilst near them had fallen\r\na non-commissioned officer in the posture of one giving the word of\r\ncommand. The road then followed a narrow ravine, and horror again took\r\npossession of them, for an entire company seemed to have fallen here,\r\nannihilated by shrapnel. The trench-like hollow was filled with bodies,\r\nmen who had slipped, toppled over, and become entangled together, some\r\nwith severed limbs, and others with twisted hands, which had clawed the\r\nyellow bank in their futile efforts to save themselves from falling. A\r\nblack band of crows flew away as Silvine and Prosper approached; and\r\nswarms of flies were already buzzing over the bodies, flocking to the\r\nspot in thousands, all eager to drink the fresh blood flowing from the\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n\'Where is it, where is it?\' repeated Silvine.\r\n\r\nThey were now skirting a ploughed field covered with knapsacks, of\r\nwhich some regiment, hard pressed by the enemy, must have rid itself\r\nin a fit of panic. The _d\xc3\xa9bris_ strewing the soil indicated various\r\nepisodes of the struggle. Scattered _k\xc3\xa9pis_ looking like large\r\npoppies with shreds of uniforms, epaulettes and belts, all covering a\r\nfield of beets, denoted a fierce hand-to-hand encounter, one of the\r\nfew close tussles engaged in during that formidable artillery duel\r\nwhich had lasted for twelve long hours. But it was more particularly\r\nagainst broken or abandoned weapons that one stumbled at almost every\r\nstep--sabres, bayonets, chassepots, in such great numbers that they\r\nseemed as it were the fruit of the earth, a crop that had sprouted\r\nfrom the soil on some day of abomination. Pans and cans also littered\r\nthe roadways, together with all sorts of things that had fallen from\r\nthe rent knapsacks--rice, brushes, and cartridges. And field followed\r\nfield amid the same immense devastation, fences torn down, trees\r\nscorched as though they had been set on fire, the very soil furrowed\r\nby the shells, or so trodden underfoot, so hardened, so ravaged by the\r\ngallop of masses of men, that it seemed as though it must for evermore\r\nremain unproductive. And while the rain blurred everything with its wan\r\nmoisture, a persistent smell arose, the smell peculiar to battlefields,\r\nwhich stink of fermenting straw and burning cloth, a commingling of\r\nfilth and gunpowder.\r\n\r\nWeary of these fields of death, through leagues and leagues of which\r\nit seemed to her she had been marching, Silvine gazed around her with\r\ngrowing anguish; \'Where is it? where is it, then?\'\r\n\r\nBut no answer came from Prosper, who was growing uneasy. For his own\r\npart, he was upset less by the sight of his dead comrades than by that\r\nof the horses, the poor horses prone on their sides, such numbers of\r\nwhich they encountered. Some were really pitiable to see, lying in\r\nfrightful postures with heads torn off and flanks ripped open, giving\r\negress to their entrails. Several, stretched upon their backs and\r\ndisplaying their huge bellies, upreared their four stiffened legs like\r\nposts. The boundless plain was quite bumpy with these stricken steeds.\r\nSome of them were not yet dead though they had been in agony for two\r\ndays past; and at the faintest sound, they raised their pain-racked\r\nheads, wagging them to right and left, and then letting them fall\r\nagain; whilst others, remaining motionless, gave vent at times to a\r\nloud call, that plaint of the dying horse, so peculiar, so frightfully\r\ndolorous, that the very atmosphere quivered at the sound. And Prosper,\r\nwith his heart lacerated, bethought himself of Zephyr, fancying that he\r\nwould perhaps see him again.\r\n\r\nAll at once he felt the ground shaking as under the gallop of a furious\r\ncharge. He looked round, and barely had time to call to his companion:\r\n\'The horses! the horses! Run behind that wall!\'\r\n\r\nA hundred chargers or so, all riderless, and some still laden with\r\nheavy kits, were rushing from the summit of a neighbouring slope,\r\nrolling towards them at a hellish pace. These were the mounts which\r\nhad lost their riders in the fight Remaining on the field, they had\r\ninstinctively collected together, and having neither hay nor straw,\r\nthey had for a couple of days past been cropping the scanty grass,\r\npulling the hedges to pieces, and gnawing the bark of the trees. And\r\nnow, whenever hunger pricked them like a spur, they started off all\r\ntogether at a mad gallop, and charged across the blank, silent country,\r\ncrushing the dead, and finishing off the wounded.\r\n\r\nThe herd was drawing near, and Silvine only had time to pull the donkey\r\nand the little cart behind the low wall: \'Good heavens! they will break\r\neverything!\'\r\n\r\nThe horses, however, had leapt the barrier; there was merely a roll of\r\nthunder as it were, and then they were galloping off, plunging into a\r\nhollow road which stretched away to the verge of a wood, behind which\r\nthey disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving led the donkey back into the track, Silvine insisted upon\r\nProsper answering her: \'Come, where is it?\'\r\n\r\nTurning and surveying the horizon on every side, he answered: \'There\r\nwere three trees--I must find them--a fellow doesn\'t see very clearly,\r\nyou know, when he\'s fighting, and it isn\'t easy afterwards to find out\r\nthe road one took.\'\r\n\r\nThen, on perceiving some people on his left, two men and a woman, it\r\noccurred to him to question them. But the woman fled at his approach,\r\nand the men warned him away with threatening gestures. Others whom\r\nhe saw, clad in sordid garments, inexpressibly filthy, and with the\r\nsuspicious-looking faces of bandits, were careful to avoid him,\r\nslinking away between the bushes like crawling, crafty animals. And on\r\nnoticing that the dead, in the rear of these evil-looking men, were\r\nshoeless, displaying their bare white feet in the grey light, he ended\r\nby realising that these prowlers were some of the tramps following\r\nthe hostile armies, plunderers of corpses, predatory German Jews,\r\nwho had entered France in the wake of the invasion. One tall, thin\r\nfellow darted away ahead of him at a gallop, with a sack burdening his\r\nshoulders, and stolen silver and stolen watches jingling in his pockets.\r\n\r\nA lad of thirteen or fourteen allowed Prosper to approach him, however,\r\nand protested loudly when the Chasseur, finding that he was French,\r\nbegan overwhelming him with reproaches: What! couldn\'t a chap earn\r\nhis living, then? For his part, he was simply picking up chassepots,\r\nand received five sous for each one that he found. That same morning,\r\nhaving fled from his village with his stomach empty since the previous\r\nday, he had hired himself out to a man from Luxemburg who had\r\ncontracted with the Prussians to collect the rifles scattered over\r\nthe battlefield. The Germans, indeed, feared that if the weapons were\r\npicked up by the frontier peasants, they would be carried off into\r\nBelgium, and sent back into France by another route, and thus quite a\r\ncrowd of poor devils was now hunting for the guns, seeking for so many\r\nfive-sous, rummaging among the herbage, like the peasant-women who may\r\nbe seen bending double in the meadows whilst searching the grass for\r\ndandelions.\r\n\r\n\'A dirty trade!\' Prosper growled.\r\n\r\n\'Well, a chap must eat,\' the youngster answered. \'I\'m not robbing\r\nanyone.\'\r\n\r\nThen, as he did not belong to that district, and could not give any\r\ninformation, he pointed out a little farmhouse, near by, where he had\r\nseen some people a short time before. Prosper thanked him and was going\r\noff to join Silvine again, when he caught sight of a chassepot half\r\nburied in a furrow. His first thought was to say nothing about it, but\r\nall at once he retraced his steps, and despite himself exclaimed: \'Hi!\r\nthere\'s one here, that will make five sous more for you.\'\r\n\r\nAs they drew near to the farm, Silvine noticed some other peasants\r\nwho were digging a long trench with picks and spades. These were\r\nimmediately under the orders of German officers, who, with nothing more\r\nformidable than switches in their hands, stood by, stiff and silent,\r\nwatching the work. The inhabitants of all the surrounding villages had\r\nin this way been requisitioned to bury the dead; for it was feared\r\nthat the rainy weather would hasten the mortification of the corpses.\r\nNear the trench were two carts laden with dead bodies, which a gang of\r\nmen was removing and swiftly depositing in the cavity, placing them\r\nside by side in serried array, and without troubling to search their\r\ngarments or even to look at their faces. And in the rear of the first\r\nparty three other men, provided with large shovels, were covering the\r\nrow of corpses with a layer of earth, so thin and scanty, however, that\r\nit was already cracking under the action of the rain. So hastily and\r\ncarelessly was the work done, indeed, that before a fortnight was over\r\na pestilence would be rising from every chink. Silvine could not resist\r\nhalting beside the trench and gazing at the poor wretches who were\r\nlaid in it. She was shuddering with a horrible fear, an idea that she\r\nrecognised Honor\xc3\xa9 in each blood-smeared face that her eyes fell upon.\r\nWas not that he--that unfortunate fellow who had lost his left eye, or\r\nthat other one, perhaps, with the broken jaw? If she did not speedily\r\nfind him on that endless, indefinite plateau, he would assuredly be\r\ntaken from her beyond power of recovery, and buried all of a heap with\r\nthe others. Accordingly she ran off to join Prosper, who had gone on\r\nto the farm-gate with the donkey: \'Good Lord, where is it, then? Ask,\r\nquestion the people!\'\r\n\r\nApart, however, from a servant-woman and her child who had made their\r\nway back from the woods, where they had almost perished of hunger\r\nand thirst, there were only some Prussian soldiers at the farm. It\r\nwas a nook suggestive of patriarchal simplicity, of honest rest\r\nfollowing upon the fatigues of the past few days. Some of the Germans\r\nwere carefully brushing their tunics, which they had hung on the\r\nclothes-lines. Another, skilful with his needle, had almost finished\r\ndarning a hole in his trousers; whilst in the middle of the courtyard\r\nthe cook of the party had lighted a large fire, on which the evening\r\nrepast was boiling in a huge pot, which exhaled a pleasant smell of\r\nbacon and cabbage. The conquest was already being organised with\r\nperfect tranquillity and discipline. These men, smoking their long\r\npipes, might have passed for peaceful civilians who had just returned\r\nhome. On a bench at the door a brawny, carroty-haired fellow had taken\r\nthe servant\'s child--a little chap of five or six--in his arms, and was\r\ndandling him playfully, speaking German words of endearment to him,\r\nvastly amused to see the urchin laugh at this harsh-syllabled foreign\r\nlanguage which he did not understand.\r\n\r\nProsper, however, at once turned his back upon the farm for fear of\r\nsome fresh mishap. But these Prussians were evidently good-natured\r\nfellows; they smiled at sight of the little moke, and did not even\r\ntrouble to ask for the _laissez-passer_.\r\n\r\nThen came a wild march. On the sun appearing for a moment between two\r\nclouds they saw that it was already low on the horizon. Would night\r\nfall and surprise them in that endless charnel-place? Then a fresh\r\nshower obscured the sun, and all around them there remained but the\r\npale infinitude of rain, a fine spray which blotted out everything,\r\nthe roads, the fields, and the trees. The donkey was still trotting at\r\nthe same slow pace behind them, carrying his head low, and dragging\r\nthe little cart along with the resigned gait of a docile animal. They\r\nwent northward, they came back towards Sedan, no longer knowing what\r\ndirection they were taking; and twice they retraced their steps on\r\nrecognising certain spots which they had previously passed. They were\r\ndoubtless going round and round; and at last, overcome by despair and\r\nexhaustion, they halted at a crossway where three roads met, and stood\r\nthere in the pelting downpour, lacking both strength of mind and body\r\nto pursue their search any farther.\r\n\r\nTo their surprise, however, they suddenly heard some groans, and on\r\ntrudging as far as a lonely cottage, on their left, they found two\r\nwounded men lying in a room. All the doors were open, and these men had\r\nseen nobody, not a soul, during the two days that they had been lying\r\nthere, shivering with fever, and without even having their wounds\r\ndressed. Thirst was consuming them, torturing them the more acutely\r\nas the rain was streaming all around them, and they could hear it\r\npattering loudly on the window-panes. Neither could move, and both at\r\nonce raised a cry of \'Water! water!\' that distressful, longing cry with\r\nwhich the wounded always pursue the passer-by whenever the faintest\r\nsound of steps rouses them from their lethargy.\r\n\r\nWhen Silvine had brought them some water, Prosper, who in the more\r\nseverely wounded of the two men had recognised a comrade, a Chasseur\r\nd\'Afrique of his own regiment, realised that they could not be far from\r\nthe ground over which Margueritte\'s division had charged. He questioned\r\nthe poor fellow, who, with a vague wave of the arm, ended by answering\r\naffirmatively, \'It was over yonder, on the left, after passing a large\r\nfield of lucern.\' Provided with this information, Silvine wished to\r\nstart off again at once. Some men were passing, picking up the dead,\r\nand having called to them in order that they might come to succour the\r\ntwo wounded soldiers, she took hold of the donkey\'s bridle and began\r\ndragging the animal over the slippery ground, all eagerness to make her\r\nway yonder past that field of lucern.\r\n\r\nAll at once Prosper halted. \'It must be hereabouts. Look! there are the\r\nthree trees on the right. Do you see the ruts too? And yonder there\'s a\r\nbroken caisson. We\'ve reached the spot at last.\'\r\n\r\nQuivering from head to foot, Silvine darted forward and examined two\r\ncorpses, two artillerymen who had fallen by the wayside. \'But he\'s not\r\nhere, he\'s not here!\' she exclaimed. \'You must have made a mistake.\r\nYes, you must have fancied it, your eyes must have deceived you.\'\r\n\r\nLittle by little a mad hope, a delirious joy was gaining upon her.\r\n\'Suppose you were mistaken. What if he should be alive? And of course\r\nhe must be alive since he\'s not here.\'\r\n\r\nBut, all at once, she groaned aloud. Turning round, she had found\r\nherself on the very spot where the battery had been established.\r\nThe scene was a frightful one, the ground cut up and rent as by an\r\nearthquake, with wreckage lying all around, and corpses thrown upon\r\ntheir stomachs, their backs, their sides, in horrifying postures; their\r\narms twisted, their legs doubled under them, their heads askew, their\r\nwhite teeth showing in their mouths, which howling had distended.\r\nA corporal had expired with both hands pressed upon his eyelids in\r\na paroxysm of fright, as though to shut out all view of what was\r\nhappening. Some gold coins, which a lieutenant had carried in a belt\r\nabout his body, had fallen from it, oozing forth with his blood, and\r\nlay scattered among his bowels. The two chums, Adolphe the driver, and\r\nLouis the gun-layer, with their eyes protruding from their sockets,\r\nwere still clasped in a fierce embrace, one atop of the other, coupled\r\neven in death. And at last there was Honor\xc3\xa9, lying upon his crippled\r\ngun as on a bed of honour, struck both in the flank and the shoulder,\r\nbut with his face unscathed and handsome with its expression of anger,\r\nwhilst his eyes were still turned in the direction of those Prussian\r\nbatteries yonder.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! my friend,\' sobbed Silvine, \'my friend!\'\r\n\r\nShe had fallen upon her knees on the drenched ground, with clasped\r\nhands, in an outburst of mad grief. That name of friend, the only one\r\nthat came to her lips, told of all the affection she had lost in losing\r\nthat excellent young fellow, so good, so kind, who had forgiven her\r\nand consented, despite everything, to make her his wife. And now her\r\nhope was ended, her life was over. Never had she loved another, never\r\nwould she cease to love _him_. The rain was abating, and a flock of\r\ncrows whirling and croaking above the three trees, alarmed her like a\r\nthreat of evil. Did they want to take him from her once more, that dear\r\none, dead, alas! whom she had only found again with so much difficulty?\r\nShe had dragged herself to him, on her knees, and was driving away the\r\ngreedy flies that buzzed above his blankly staring eyes, whose glance\r\nshe still obstinately sought.\r\n\r\nBut her anxiety took another turn when between Honor\xc3\xa9\'s clenched\r\nfingers she espied some blood-stained paper. With gentle jerks, she\r\ntried to pull it from him; but the dead man would not release it, his\r\nfingers grasped it so tightly that it could only have been torn from\r\nhim in shreds. It was the letter he had preserved under his shirt,\r\nagainst his skin, the letter she had written to him, which he had thus\r\npressed as in a farewell clasp, amid the final throes of his agony. And\r\nwhen she had recognised it, there stole through all her affliction a\r\nprofound and penetrating joy. She was quite overcome on finding that\r\nhe had died thinking of her. Yes, most certainly, she would leave that\r\ndear letter in his hand, she would make no further effort to take it\r\nfrom him since he was so stubbornly bent on carrying it with him to\r\nthe grave. A fresh flow of tears relieved her: warm, gentle tears\r\nwere these. She had risen to her feet and she kissed his hands, she\r\nkissed his brow, repeating ever the same infinitely loving word: \'My\r\nfriend--my friend.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the sun was sinking, and Prosper had gone to fetch\r\nthe blanket, which he spread upon the ground. Then, slowly, reverently,\r\nthey both raised Honor\xc3\xa9\'s body, laid it on the blanket, and carried it,\r\nwrapped in the folds of the covering, to the little cart. The rain was\r\nalready threatening again, and, mournful little _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ that they\r\nformed, they were starting off once more across that accursed plain,\r\nwhen all at once they heard a rolling, rumbling noise, as of thunder.\r\nThen again did Prosper call: \'The horses! the horses!\'\r\n\r\nIt was another charge of those famished, wandering cavalry mounts which\r\nhad remained at large. They were approaching this time over a vast\r\nlevel stretch of stubble, in a deep mass, with their manes streaming in\r\nthe wind and their nostrils covered with foam; and an oblique ray of\r\nthe red sun threw the shadow of their frantic gallop clean across the\r\nplateau to its farther end. Silvine had immediately sprung in front of\r\nthe cart, her arms uplifted, as though to stop them, with a gesture of\r\nfurious affright. Fortunately, some rising ground turned them aside and\r\nthey swerved to the left, otherwise they must have crushed everything.\r\nThe ground fairly shook beneath their mad scamper, and their hoofs\r\nsent the stones flying like grape-shot, one pebble wounding the little\r\ndonkey on the head. Then they were lost to view in the depths of a\r\nravine.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s hunger that makes them gallop like that,\' said Prosper. \'Poor\r\nanimals!\'\r\n\r\nHaving bandaged the donkey\'s head with her handkerchief, Silvine again\r\ntook hold of the bridle and the dismal little _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ once more\r\ntraversed the plateau on its return journey of a couple of leagues or\r\nso to Remilly. At every few steps Prosper halted to gaze at the dead\r\nhorses, his heart heavy at the thought of going off like that, without\r\nhaving again seen Zephyr.\r\n\r\nA little below the wood of La Garenne, they were turning to the left\r\nwith the intention of taking the road they had followed in the morning,\r\nwhen a German outpost demanded their _laissez-passer_, and instead of\r\nturning them away from Sedan ordered them to pass through the town\r\nunder penalty of being arrested. There was no questioning this new\r\norder, besides it shortened the journey by a mile and a half, which\r\nthey were glad of, weary as they felt in every limb.\r\n\r\nInside Sedan, however, their progress was greatly impeded. As soon\r\nas they were within the fortifications they found themselves in a\r\nfoul atmosphere reeking with filth. For three days the town had\r\nbeen the cesspool of a hundred thousand men; and to complete the\r\ninsufferable stench there were the carcases of the horses, which had\r\nbeen slaughtered and cut up on the various open spaces, and whose\r\nentrails were now rotting in the sunlight, their heads, their bones\r\nlying here and there about the pavements and swarming with flies. A\r\npestilence would assuredly break out if proper diligence were not shown\r\nin sweeping into the sewers all those horrible beds of manure which in\r\nthe Rue du M\xc3\xa9nil, the Rue Maqua, and even on the Place Turenne were a\r\nquarter of a yard high. As it happened, printed notices placarded by\r\nthe German authorities already requisitioned the inhabitants for the\r\nfollowing day, ordering all of them, no matter what their position\r\nmight be, workmen, shopkeepers, merchants, and magistrates, to assemble\r\nwith brooms and shovels and set about this necessary work, under threat\r\nof heavy penalties if the town were not clean by the evening. And the\r\nchief judge of the local court was already to be seen at his door,\r\nscraping the pavement and throwing the filth into a barrow, with a\r\nfire-shovel!\r\n\r\nSilvine and Prosper, who had turned into the High Street, could walk\r\nbut slowly through the f\xc5\x93tid slime. Moreover, a great commotion reigned\r\nin the town, and at every moment the road was blocked. The Prussians\r\nwere now searching the houses for such of the French soldiers as had\r\nhidden themselves, obstinately intent on not surrendering. At about\r\ntwo o\'clock on the previous day, when General de Wimpffen had returned\r\nfrom the ch\xc3\xa2teau of Bellevue after signing the capitulation there,\r\na rumour had circulated that the captive army was to be confined on\r\nthe peninsula of Iges, until convoys could be organised to escort it\r\nto Germany. Merely a few officers intended to avail themselves of\r\nthe clause which accorded them their liberty on condition that they\r\npledged their word in writing not to serve again during the war. Among\r\nthese, it appeared, there was only one general--Bourgain-Desfeuilles,\r\nwho alleged his rheumatism as an excuse. And that same morning he\r\nhad been saluted with jeers and hisses on taking his departure from\r\nthe Golden Cross Hotel in a vehicle. Since dawn the operation of\r\ndisarming the French troops had been in progress; the soldiers having\r\nto defile across the Place Turenne, and throw their guns and bayonets\r\nin a pile which, amid a crashing like that of old iron, kept rising\r\nhigher and higher in one corner of the square. A detachment of German\r\ntroops was assembled there under the orders of a young officer, a\r\ntall, pale fellow in a sky-blue tunic, a plumed cap and white gloves,\r\nwho superintended the disarmament with an air of haughty smartness.\r\nA Zouave having refused, with a mutinous gesture, to surrender his\r\nchassepot, the officer gave orders for his removal, exclaiming, in\r\nperfect French: \'That man to be shot at once!\' With dejected faces\r\nthe other Frenchmen continued defiling, throwing their guns upon the\r\npile with a mechanical gesture, anxious as they were to have done with\r\nit all. But how many there were who no longer had any weapons, whose\r\nchassepots lay scattered over the country-side! And how many who were\r\nhiding since the previous day, in the vain hope of escaping surrender\r\namid the inexpressible confusion. The houses they had invaded still\r\nswarmed with these obstinate fellows, who refused to answer when called\r\nand squeezed themselves into corners, imagining that they would not be\r\nfound there. The German patrols which scoured the town came upon some\r\nof the vanquished hidden under articles of furniture. Others who had\r\ntaken refuge in cellars refused to come out even when discovered, and\r\nthe patrols at last fired upon them through the vent-holes. Never was\r\nthere such a man-hunt, such an abominable _battue_.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bridge over the Meuse the donkey was stopped by the\r\ncrush there. A suspicious officer, commanding the picket, which guarded\r\nthe bridge, fancied that the little cart might be leaving the town\r\nwith some bread or meat, and wished to make sure of its contents. When\r\nhe had pulled the blanket aside and saw the corpse, he gazed at it\r\nfor an instant as though thunderstruck; then with a wave of his arm\r\nhe signed that the vehicle might proceed on its way. But it was still\r\nimpossible to advance, in fact the obstruction was increasing. A German\r\ndetachment was conducting one of the first convoys of prisoners to\r\nthe peninsula of Iges. There seemed no end to this flock of captives.\r\nOnward they pressed, hustling one another, treading on one another\'s\r\nheels, with their uniforms in tatters, their heads bowed, their eyes\r\ndarting hangdog, sidelong glances, their backs bent and their arms\r\nswinging listlessly, like the vanquished men they were, no longer\r\npossessed of even a knife to cut their own throats with. The harsh\r\nvoices of their guards rang out urging them onward, like whips raining\r\nlashes through their silent scramble, amid which the only sound was\r\nthe plashing of their heavy shoes in the thick mud. Another shower had\r\nbegun to fall, and there could be no more sorrowful sight than that\r\nflock of vanquished soldiers, trudging along in the rain, like tramps\r\nand beggars of the highways.\r\n\r\nAll at once Prosper, who, like the old Chasseur d\'Afrique he was, felt\r\nhis heart beating so violently with restrained rage that it seemed\r\nlikely to burst, nudged Silvine in order to call her attention to two\r\nof the passing soldiers. He had recognised Maurice and Jean, marching\r\nfraternally, side by side, among their comrades; and the little cart\r\nhaving resumed its journey in the wake of the convoy, he was able to\r\nfollow the two friends with his eyes as far as the suburb of Torcy,\r\nwhilst they proceeded along the level road which conducts to Iges\r\nbetween gardens and plots of vegetables.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' murmured Silvine, lowering her eyes upon Honor\xc3\xa9\'s corpse,\r\nprofoundly distressed by all she had seen. \'Perhaps the dead are the\r\nhappier.\'\r\n\r\nNightfall surprised them at Wadelincourt, and it had long since been\r\npitch dark when they once more reached Remilly. Old Fouchard was\r\nstupefied on beholding his son\'s corpse, for he had felt certain that\r\nit would not be found. For his own part he had employed his day in\r\ndriving a good bargain. Officers\' horses, stolen on the battlefield,\r\nwere being readily sold at twenty francs apiece, and he had given but\r\nfive-and-forty francs for three of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HORRORS OF CAPTIVITY--STARVATION, MURDER, AND DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was such a scramble whilst the column of prisoners was leaving\r\nTorcy that Maurice was separated from Jean. And, run as he might\r\nafterwards, he only lost himself the more. When he at last reached the\r\nbridge thrown across the canal at the base of the peninsula of Iges, he\r\nfound himself among some Chasseurs d\'Afrique and was unable to rejoin\r\nhis regiment.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was defended by a couple of guns pointed towards the\r\npeninsula; and the Prussian staff had turned a private residence, just\r\nbeyond the canal, into a guard-house, where was stationed a commandant\r\nappointed to receive and guard the prisoners. The formalities were of\r\na very summary description; the men arriving were simply counted like\r\nsheep, just as they came along, but little attention being paid either\r\nto the different uniforms or the different numbers; and the various\r\nflocks having scrambled past began to encamp wheresoever the chances of\r\nthe road led them.\r\n\r\nMaurice thought he might venture to apply to a Bavarian officer who sat\r\nthere, astride a chair, smoking: \'In which direction, sir, shall I find\r\nthe 106th of the Line?\'\r\n\r\nWas this officer an exception to the rule, and did he not understand\r\nFrench? Or did he think it amusing to send a poor devil of a prisoner\r\nastray? At all events he smiled, raised his hand and signed to Maurice\r\nto go straight on.\r\n\r\nAlthough Maurice belonged to that part of the country he had never\r\npreviously set foot on the peninsula, and he walked onward upon a\r\njourney of discovery much as though he had been thrown by a squall upon\r\nsome far-away island. He at first skirted Glaire Tower, a handsome\r\nestate on his left, whose little park, planted beside the Meuse, was\r\nextremely charming. Then the road followed the river which flowed by\r\non the right hand, below steep and lofty banks. Little by little the\r\nroad sloped upwards, winding round the hillock in the centre of the\r\npeninsula; and here were some old quarries, excavations towards which\r\nstrayed narrow pathways. Farther on stood a mill beside the water.\r\nThen the road turned, and came back to the village of Iges, built on\r\na slope and connected with the opposite bank of the Meuse by a ferry\r\njust in front of the spinning works of St. Albert. Finally patches of\r\ncultivated ground and meadows were spread out--quite an expanse of\r\nflat, treeless land, limited by the rounded loop of the river. In vain\r\ndid Maurice scan the undulating hill slope: he could only see some\r\nartillery and cavalry taking up their quarters there. Thereupon he\r\nagain made inquiries, applying to a corporal of Chasseurs d\'Afrique,\r\nwho, however, could tell him nothing. Night was gathering and, feeling\r\nweary, he sat down for a moment on a mile-stone.\r\n\r\nThen, in the despair which all at once came over him, he perceived\r\nacross the Meuse those accursed fields where he had fought two days\r\nbefore. In the waning light of that rainy day everything had a livid\r\nhue--a dismal, mud-smeared vista was offered to his eyes. The defile\r\nof St. Albert, the narrow road by which the Prussians had approached,\r\nskirted the loop of the river as far as some whitish quarry pits.\r\nThe crests of the wood of La Falizette waved beyond the slopes of\r\nthe Seugnon hill; and almost in front of him, just a little on the\r\nleft, was St. Menges with its road sloping down to the ferry. In the\r\ncentre, just opposite, rose the Hattoy hill. Illy was far away in the\r\nrear. Fleigneux nestled behind a bend of the ground; whilst Floing was\r\nnearer in, on the right hand. He recognised the field in which he had\r\nwaited, for so many hours, lying among the cabbages; the plateau which\r\nthe reserve artillery had attempted to defend; and the crest where he\r\nhad seen Honor\xc3\xa9 expire, stretched upon his shattered gun. And all the\r\nabomination of the disaster seemed to be coming to life again, filling\r\nhim with anguish and disgust till he felt sick at heart.\r\n\r\nA fear lest he should be overtaken by the darkness induced him to\r\nresume his search. Perhaps the 106th was camping on the low ground,\r\nbeyond the village. But he only found some prowlers there, and\r\naccordingly resolved to make the circuit of the peninsula, following\r\nthe loop of the river. Whilst crossing a potato field he took the\r\nprecaution to tear up some of the plants and fill his pockets with\r\npotatoes; they were not yet ripe, but he had nothing else to eat, for\r\nit unluckily happened that Jean had taken charge of the two loaves\r\nwhich Delaherche had given them when starting. What especially struck\r\nMaurice was the large number of horses he met on the bare land sloping\r\ngently, from the central hillock, to the Meuse in the direction of\r\nDonchery. Why had all these animals been brought there? How were they\r\nto be fed? Black night had fallen when he reached a little wood,\r\nbeside the water, where he was surprised to find the Cent-Gardes of\r\nthe Emperor\'s escort already installed, drying themselves around large\r\nfires. These \'gentlemen,\' who thus camped apart from the other troops,\r\nhad good tents, pots full of boiling _soupe_, and even a cow, tethered\r\nto a tree. Maurice at once noticed that they gazed askance at him,\r\nwretched-looking Linesman that he was, with his uniform in tatters and\r\ncovered with mud. Still they allowed him to cook his potatoes among\r\nthe ashes of one of their fires; after which, withdrawing to a tree\r\na hundred yards away, he sat himself down to eat. It was no longer\r\nraining, the sky had cleared and the stars were shining very brightly\r\nin the depths of the bluey darkness. He then reflected that it would be\r\nbest for him to spend the night there, and to resume his search in the\r\nmorning. Besides he was quite overcome with fatigue, and the tree would\r\nalways afford him some shelter should the rain begin falling again.\r\n\r\nHe did not manage to sleep, however, haunted as he was by thoughts of\r\nthat vast prison open to the night air, in which he realised he was\r\nconfined. The Prussians had displayed remarkable acumen in driving\r\nthither the eighty thousand men who remained of the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons.\r\nThe peninsula was a league[37] or so in length, with a width of about\r\na mile, ample space in which to pen the immense disbanded flock of\r\nvanquished soldiers. And Maurice clearly realised that water surrounded\r\nthem without a break, the loop of the Meuse winding round them on three\r\nsides, whilst at the base of the peninsula was the derivational canal,\r\nlinking the two adjacent river-beds. At this point only was there an\r\noutlet, the bridge guarded by a couple of cannon. And thus, despite\r\nits extent, nothing would be easier than to guard this camp. He had\r\nalready noticed the German sentries, who had been posted in a cordon on\r\nthe opposite bank of the Meuse, near the water\'s edge, at intervals of\r\nfifty yards or so, with orders to fire upon every man who might try to\r\nescape by swimming across the river. Uhlans, moreover, galloped along\r\nin the rear connecting the various pickets; and farther away, scattered\r\nover the country-side, were the black lines of the Prussian regiments,\r\nso that a triple living enceinte penned in the captive army.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, although insomnia kept his eyes wide open, Maurice\r\ncould only see the darkness, amid which the bivouac fires were being\r\nlighted, together with the silhouettes of the motionless sentries,\r\nranged beyond the pale ribbon of the Meuse. These sentries stood there\r\nerect and black in the starlight, and at regular intervals Maurice\r\nheard their guttural call, a threatening watch-cry which died away,\r\nafar off, amid the loud gushing of the river. As he heard those harsh\r\nforeign syllables speeding along beneath a lovely starlit night of\r\nFrance, all the nightmare of two days previously was born anew within\r\nhim; he once more seemed to behold all that he had again seen whilst\r\nit was light an hour or so previously--that plateau of Illy still\r\nstrewn with slain, those accursed outskirts of Sedan, where a world\r\nhad crumbled away. Lying on the damp soil at the verge of the wood,\r\nhis head resting on the root of a tree, he again sank into the despair\r\nwhich had taken possession of him on Delaherche\'s sofa the previous\r\nmorning; and that which now tortured him, increasing the anguish of his\r\npride, was the question of the morrow, a desire to measure the depth\r\nof that great Downfall, to ascertain amid what ruins that world of\r\nyesterday had sunk. Was that abominable war not over, as the Emperor\r\nhad surrendered his sword to King William? But he remembered what two\r\nBavarian soldiers had said whilst conducting him and his comrades to\r\nIges: \'We all in France, we all to Paris!\' Amid his semi-somnolence\r\nthere came to him a sudden vision of what was happening--the Empire\r\nswept away, carried off by universal execration; the Republic\r\nproclaimed amidst an outburst of patriotic fever; the shadows of the\r\nLegend of \'92 arising, the soldiers of the _lev\xc3\xa9e en masse_, the\r\narmies of volunteers driving the invader from the soil of France. And\r\neverything was intermingled in his poor, ailing head--the demands\r\nof the victors; the harshness of the conquest; the obstinacy of the\r\nvanquished, intent on resisting even to the last drop of their blood;\r\nand the captivity reserved to those eighty thousand men, of whom he was\r\none, first on that peninsula, and then in the fortresses of Germany\r\nduring weeks, months, and perhaps years. Everything was splitting to\r\npieces--falling for evermore into the depths of limitless misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe call of the sentries, growing gradually louder and louder, burst\r\nforth in front of him and then slowly died away, afar off. He had\r\nawakened from a short doze, and was turning over on the hard ground\r\nwhen the profound silence was suddenly rent by the report of a\r\nfirearm. Then a death-rattle sped through the black night, and there\r\ncame a sound of splashing water, the brief struggle of a body sinking\r\nhead-foremost in the stream. Some unlucky fellow had, no doubt, been\r\nhit by a bullet in the chest, whilst attempting to escape by swimming\r\nacross the Meuse.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the morrow Maurice arose. The sky was clear, and he was\r\neager to join Jean and his comrades. For a moment he had an idea of\r\nagain scouring the interior of the peninsula, but on reflection he\r\nresolved to complete his round. And just as he again reached the bank\r\nof the canal, he perceived the remnants of the 106th, a thousand men\r\nor so, encamped on the bank, which was screened only by a meagre row\r\nof poplars. Had he turned to the left on the previous day instead of\r\ngoing straight before him he would at once have overtaken his regiment.\r\nIndeed, nearly all the infantry were heaped together here, along that\r\nbank stretching from Glaire Tower to the ch\xc3\xa2teau of Villette, another\r\ncountry seat, surrounded by a few old houses, in the direction of\r\nDonchery; and they were all bivouacking near the bridge, near the only\r\noutlet, in that same instinctive desire for liberty which causes a\r\nflock of sheep to press near the gate of the fold.\r\n\r\nAt sight of Maurice, Jean raised a cry of delight: \'Ah! here you are at\r\nlast! I fancied you were in the river.\'\r\n\r\nWith the corporal were the remaining men of his squad, Pache and\r\nLapoulle, Loubet and Chouteau, who, after sleeping here and there\r\nunder the doorways of Sedan, had eventually been swept together by the\r\nPrussian patrols. So far as their company was concerned, the corporal\r\nwas the only superior they had left them, for death had carried\r\naway Sergeant Sapin, Lieutenant Rochas, and Captain Beaudoin; and\r\nalthough the victors had abolished all distinctions of rank among the\r\nprisoners, deciding that they henceforth owed obedience only to the\r\nGerman officers, the four men had none the less drawn together around\r\nJean, knowing that he was prudent and experienced, a man to cling to\r\nin difficult circumstances. And thus, that morning, in spite of the\r\nstupidity of some and the ill will of others, concord and good humour\r\nwere paramount among the little party. To begin with, Jean had found\r\nthem a spot between two water furrows where the ground was almost dry;\r\nand since they had only half a shelter tent left between them all, they\r\nhad here stretched themselves out to pass the night. Then, too, Jean\r\nhad just managed to procure some wood and a pot, in which Loubet had\r\nmade them some nice warm coffee, which had quite inspirited them. The\r\nrain was no longer falling, the day seemed likely to be a very fine\r\none, and they still had a little biscuit and bacon left; moreover, as\r\nChouteau remarked, it was delightful to have no orders to obey, and to\r\nbe able to loaf about just as one chose. They were captives, no doubt,\r\nbut all the same there was plenty of room. Besides, in two or three\r\ndays\' time they would be off on the road to Germany. And thus that\r\nfirst day, September 4, which chanced to be a Sunday, proved a gay one.\r\n\r\nMaurice, himself, in better spirits since he had joined his comrades,\r\nexperienced but little suffering, save such as was caused him by the\r\nPrussian bands, which played throughout the afternoon on the other side\r\nof the canal. There was psalm-singing in chorus towards the evening;\r\nand, beyond the cordon of sentries, the German soldiers strolled to and\r\nfro in little groups, slowly and loudly chanting in celebration of the\r\nSabbath.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that music!\' Maurice exclaimed at last in his exasperation. \'It\r\npierces me through and through.\'\r\n\r\nJean, whose nerves were less susceptible, shrugged his shoulders:\r\n\'Well, they have good reason to be pleased. Besides, they perhaps think\r\nthat they are entertaining us. The day hasn\'t been an unpleasant one,\r\nwe mustn\'t grumble.\'\r\n\r\nAt the fall of night, however, the rain came down again. It was a\r\nperfect disaster. Some soldiers had taken possession of the few\r\nabandoned houses on the peninsula. A few others had managed to set up\r\ntents. But the greater number, lacking any kind of shelter, destitute\r\neven of blankets, had to spend the night in the open air under the\r\ntorrential downpour. At about one in the morning, Maurice, who had\r\ndozed off with fatigue, awoke, and found himself in a perfect lake.\r\nThe water furrows, swollen by the rain, had overflowed, submerging the\r\nground where he had stretched himself to sleep. Chouteau and Loubet\r\nwere swearing with rage, whilst Pache began shaking Lapoulle, who was\r\nstill sound asleep amid all this flood. Then Jean, bethinking himself\r\nof the poplars planted alongside the canal, hastened to them for\r\nshelter with his men, who, bending down, spent the remainder of that\r\nfrightful night with their backs against the trunks, and their legs\r\ndoubled under them to protect them from the big rain drops.\r\n\r\nAnd the morrow and the following day proved really abominable; so heavy\r\nand so frequent were the showers that the men\'s clothes never once had\r\ntime to dry. Famine was beginning, too; there was not a biscuit, not\r\na bit of bacon, not a grain of coffee left. During those two days,\r\nthe Monday and the Tuesday, they lived on potatoes stolen from the\r\nneighbouring fields; and even these became so scarce at the close of\r\nthe second day that men with money bought them at the rate of five sous\r\napiece. It is true that bugles sounded to rations, and the corporal had\r\nin all haste repaired to a large shed at Glaire Tower, where, so it was\r\nrumoured, rations of bread were being distributed. But on the first\r\noccasion he had waited there to no purpose for three hours, and on the\r\nsecond he had had a quarrel with a Bavarian. The French officers being\r\nunable to do anything to assist their men, in the powerless position\r\nto which they were reduced, it really seemed as though the German\r\nstaff had herded the vanquished army together there in the rain with\r\nthe intention of starving it to death. No steps apparently were taken,\r\nnot an attempt was made to feed those eighty thousand men, whose agony\r\nwas now beginning in that frightful hell which was to acquire the name\r\nof the Camp of Misery, a name of woe which in after times the bravest\r\ncould not recall without a shudder.\r\n\r\nOn returning from his long, useless waits before the shed, Jean, as a\r\nrule so calm, flew into quite a passion. \'Are they playing the fool\r\nwith us, sounding to rations like that when there\'s nothing? I\'m dashed\r\nif I\'ll trouble to go there again.\'\r\n\r\nAnd yet at the first call he again hastened thither. These regulation\r\nbugle-calls were positively inhuman, and they produced another result\r\nwhich wrung Maurice\'s heart. Each time that the bugles sounded, the\r\nabandoned French horses, at large on the other side of the canal,\r\ngalloped up and leaped into the water, as excited by those well-known\r\nflourishes as by the prick of the spur. Exhausted by hunger, however,\r\nthey were mostly carried off by the current, few of them managing\r\nto reach the bank of the peninsula. They could be seen struggling\r\nlamentably, and so large a number of them was drowned that at last\r\ntheir floating, inflated carcases obstructed the canal. As for those\r\nthat managed to land, they were seized with madness, as it were, and\r\ngalloped away across the waste fields.\r\n\r\n\'Some more meat for the crows!\' said Maurice sorrowfully, remembering\r\nthe horses that he had already seen in such alarming numbers during the\r\nfirst night of his captivity. \'If we remain here many days longer, we\r\nshall all be eating one another. Ah! the poor animals.\'\r\n\r\nThe Tuesday proved, indeed, terrible. Jean, who was getting seriously\r\nanxious at Maurice\'s feverish condition, compelled the young fellow\r\nto wrap himself in a shred of a blanket which he had purchased from\r\na Zouave for ten francs: whilst, for his own part, with his overcoat\r\nsoaked like a sponge, he remained all night exposed to the downpour to\r\nwhich there was no cessation. The position under the poplars became\r\nuntenable, a river of mud was streaming along on all sides, and the\r\nearth was so gorged, so saturated, that it now retained the water on\r\nits surface in deep puddles. The worst was that the six men had their\r\nstomachs empty, their evening meal having been limited to two beets,\r\nwhich for lack of dry wood they had not even been able to cook. And the\r\nsweetish roots, fresh though they were to the palate, had developed an\r\ninsupportable burning sensation in their stomachs. Moreover, dysentery\r\nwas now breaking out, caused by fatigue, bad living, and incessant\r\ndampness. With his back to the trunk of the same tree as Maurice, and\r\nwith his legs quite under water, Jean stretched out his hand a dozen\r\ntimes that night to make sure that the young fellow had not uncovered\r\nhimself in his agitated slumber. Since Maurice had saved him from the\r\nPrussians, by carrying him in his arms across the plateau of Illy, the\r\ncorporal had been paying back his debt a hundredfold. Without reasoning\r\nwhat he did, he freely gave himself to Maurice, entirely forgot himself\r\nin his affection for him. It was an unmeasured, ever active attachment\r\non the part of this peasant, who was but slightly removed from the\r\nsoil, and could not even find words to express his feelings. For\r\nMaurice, he had already taken food from his own mouth, as the men of\r\nthe squad expressed it; and now, had there been need of it, he would\r\nhave given him his skin as a covering, to protect his shoulders, and\r\nwarm his feet. And amid all the savage egotism that surrounded them,\r\namid the suffering of appetite, maddened by hunger, he was possibly\r\nindebted to his self-abnegation for the unexpected advantage that he\r\nreaped in retaining his quiet good-humour, and good health; for he\r\nalone still gave proof of strength, and lost but little of his wits.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that, after that fearful night, he put into execution\r\nan idea that had been haunting him. \'I say, youngster,\' said he to\r\nMaurice, \'as we get nothing given us to eat, and are being forgotten,\r\nso it seems, in this cursed hole, we must bestir ourselves a bit, if we\r\ndon\'t want to die of hunger. Can you walk?\'\r\n\r\nThe sun was fortunately shining again and had made Maurice feel quite\r\nwarm. \'Oh! yes, I can walk well enough,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Then we\'ll go on a journey of discovery. We have some money, and we\r\nshall have to be precious unlucky if we don\'t find something to buy.\r\nAnd we mustn\'t burden ourselves with the others, they are not straight\r\nenough, let them take care of themselves.\'\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, disgusted with the crafty egotism of Loubet and\r\nChouteau, who stole whatever they could lay their hands on and never\r\nshared anything with their comrades. And in the same way there was\r\nnothing to be done with either that brute Lapoulle or that black-beetle\r\nPache.\r\n\r\nSo Jean and Maurice went off by the road which the latter had already\r\nfollowed, alongside the Meuse. The park and house of Glaire Tower were\r\nalready devastated and pillaged, the lawns ravined as by a storm,\r\nthe trees felled, and the buildings invaded. A crowd of ragged,\r\nmud-splashed soldiers, with hollow cheeks and eyes that glittered with\r\nfever, were camping there in gipsy fashion, living like wolves in the\r\nfilthy rooms, which they were afraid to leave lest they should lose\r\ntheir places for the night. On the slopes farther on Jean and Maurice\r\npassed through the cavalry and artillery, formerly so smart and jaunty,\r\nbut now sadly down-fallen, disorganised by the torture of hunger which\r\nmaddened the horses and scattered the men over the fields in plundering\r\nbands. Outside the mill, on their right hand, they saw a procession of\r\nartillerymen and Chasseurs d\'Afrique slowly defiling along: the miller\r\nwas selling them flour at the rate of a franc for every two handfuls\r\nwhich he emptied into their handkerchiefs. The fear, however, of having\r\nto wait too long for any of this, induced Jean and Maurice to proceed\r\nfarther on; besides they hoped that they might find something better\r\nin the village of Iges. And they were in consternation when they had\r\nvisited the hamlet and found it bare and desolate, just like some\r\nAlgerian village after a flight of locusts has fallen upon it. Not a\r\ncrumb remained there, neither bread, nor vegetables, nor meat; it was\r\nas though the wretched houses had been scraped bare with the finger\r\nnails. It appeared that General Lebrun had taken up his quarters at the\r\nmayor\'s. To facilitate the provisioning of the troops he had vainly\r\nendeavoured to organise a system of tickets, the value of which would\r\nhave been reimbursed by the State after the war; but no provisions were\r\nobtainable, money was utterly useless. On the previous day a biscuit\r\nhad fetched two francs, a bottle of wine seven francs, a small liqueur\r\nglass of brandy one franc,[38] and a pipeful of tobacco half a franc.\r\nAnd now officers had to mount guard over the general\'s quarters and the\r\nadjacent hovels, with drawn swords, for frequent bands of prowlers\r\nburst open the cottage doors, stealing even the colza oil from the\r\nlamps and drinking it!\r\n\r\nThree Zouaves called to Maurice and Jean in the idea that if five of\r\nthem banded together they might bring some enterprise or other to\r\nsuccess. \'Come with us!\' they cried. \'There are some horses kicking the\r\nbucket, and if we could only get some dry wood----\'\r\n\r\nBut Maurice and Jean did not go, and the Zouaves rushed upon a\r\npeasant\'s house, broke open the cupboards and tore the thatch off the\r\nroof. Some officers, however, came up at a run, threatening them with\r\ntheir revolvers, and put them to flight.\r\n\r\nFinding the few people who had remained at Iges as wretched and as\r\nhungry as the soldiers themselves, Jean regretted that he had disdained\r\nthe flour at the mill: \'We must go back, perhaps there\'s still some\r\nleft,\' said he.\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, was growing so weary, so exhausted by hunger, that\r\nJean left him in a quarry hole, sitting on a rock in full view of the\r\nfar-spreading horizon of Sedan. For his own part, after a wait of\r\nthree-quarters of an hour he at last returned with a duster full of\r\nflour. They could devise no other plan than to eat it as it was by\r\nthe handful. It wasn\'t nasty, in fact it had no smell and merely the\r\ninsipid taste of dough. This breakfast, though a poor one, revived them\r\nsomewhat. And they were even lucky enough to find on the rock a pool of\r\nrain water, fairly clean, with which they quenched their thirst.\r\n\r\nHowever, on Jean proposing that they should stay and spend the\r\nafternoon there, Maurice made a violent gesture of refusal. \'No, no,\r\nnot here! It would make me ill if I had that long before my eyes.\' So\r\nsaying, he pointed with his trembling hand to the immense horizon, the\r\nHattoy hill, the plateaux of Floing and Illy, the wood of La Garenne,\r\nall those hateful fields of slaughter and defeat. \'Just now whilst\r\nI was waiting for you,\' he added, \'I had to turn my back on it all,\r\nfor I should have ended by howling with rage, yes, howling like an\r\nexasperated dog. You can\'t imagine the pain it gives me, it drives me\r\nmad!\'\r\n\r\nJean gazed at him, astonished that his pride should bleed like that,\r\nanxious too on again espying in his eyes that wild, mad look which he\r\nhad previously noticed in them. He thought it best to treat the matter\r\nlightly: \'Well, we can easily settle all that,\' said he, \'we\'ll go to\r\nanother part.\'\r\n\r\nThen they wandered about until evening, wheresoever the paths led\r\nthem, visiting the low ground of the peninsula in the hope that they\r\nmight still find some potatoes there. The artillerymen, however,\r\nhad appropriated the ploughs and turned up the fields, reaping and\r\ngleaning and taking everything away. They thereupon retraced their\r\nsteps, and again passed through idle, agonising flocks of captives,\r\nsoldiers who were promenading their hunger, strewing the soil with\r\ntheir numbed bodies, falling from sheer exhaustion by hundreds in the\r\nbroad sunlight. Not an hour went by but Jean and Maurice themselves\r\nwere overcome and had to sit down. Then all at once exasperation set\r\nthem on their feet again, and they once more began prowling round as\r\nthough spurred on by the instinct of the animal that seeks its food.\r\nThis agony seemed to have been lasting for months, yet the minutes were\r\nrapidly flying by. In the fields in the direction of Donchery, they\r\nwere frightened by the wandering horses, and had to seek shelter behind\r\na wall, where they remained for a long time in an exhausted state,\r\ngazing with dim eyes at those maddened animals tearing along against\r\nthe red background of the sunset.\r\n\r\nAs Maurice had foreseen, the thousands of horses which had been led\r\ninto captivity with the army, and could not be fed, proved a source of\r\ndaily increasing danger. They had first eaten the bark of the trees,\r\nthen they had attacked the trelliswork, the fences, all the planks\r\nthey came upon, and now they were becoming cannibals. They could be\r\nseen throwing themselves upon one another and tearing off the hair of\r\neach other\'s tails, chewing it furiously with foaming jaws. But it\r\nwas especially at night time that they became terrible, as though the\r\ndarkness oppressed them with a nightmare. They gathered together in\r\nbands and rushed upon the few tents that had been pitched, attracted by\r\nthe straw there. In vain had the men lighted large fires to keep them\r\naway; these fires only seemed to excite them the more. Their neighing\r\nwas so dolorous, so frightful at times that it seemed like the roaring\r\nof wild beasts. Driven away, they returned yet more numerous and more\r\nferocious. And at every moment there sped through the darkness the long\r\ncry of agony of some soldier gone astray whom they had knocked over and\r\ncrushed in their wild gallop.\r\n\r\nThe sun was still above the horizon when Jean and Maurice, on their way\r\nback to the camping ground, were surprised to come upon the four men of\r\ntheir squad, crouching in a ditch as though plotting some evil stroke.\r\nLoubet at once called to them, and Chouteau proceeded to explain:\r\n\'It\'s about to-night\'s dinner,\' said he. \'We shall all end by kicking\r\nthe bucket, we haven\'t had anything to eat for six-and-thirty hours.\r\nBut there are some horses, you know, and as horseflesh is by no means\r\nbad----\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh, you\'ll join us, corporal, won\'t you?\' broke in Loubet, \'for with\r\nsuch a big animal to handle, the more we are the better it will be.\r\nLook! there\'s one over yonder whom we\'ve been watching for an hour or\r\nso--that big roan who seems ailing. It will be easier to finish him\r\noff.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he pointed to a horse which had just fallen from hunger\r\nat the edge of a ravaged field of beets. Lying on its side, the\r\nanimal from time to time raised its poor head, breathing loudly and\r\nmournfully, and gazing around with glassy eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! what a time to wait!\' growled Lapoulle, tortured by his voracious\r\nappetite: \'I\'ll go and settle him, shall I?\'\r\n\r\nLoubet prevented him, however: No, thanks! They were not at all anxious\r\nto have a row with the Prussians, who, under penalty of death, had\r\nforbidden the prisoners to kill a single one of the horses, for fear\r\nlest the abandoned carcase might foment a pestilence. It was necessary\r\nto wait till night had closed in. And this was why they were all four\r\ngathered in that ditch, watching with glittering eyes which did not\r\nstir from the animal.\r\n\r\n\'I say, corporal,\' suddenly asked Pache in a somewhat faltering voice,\r\n\'you are a man of ideas, couldn\'t you kill him without hurting him?\'\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of revolt Jean declined the cruel task. Kill that poor,\r\nagonising beast? No, no! His first impulse was to flee and carry\r\nMaurice away with him, so that neither might take any part in that\r\nfrightful butchery. But at sight of his companion\'s pallor he scolded\r\nhimself for his sensibility. After all, animals were intended for the\r\nfood of man. A fellow ought not to let himself die of hunger when there\r\nwas meat available. And pleased to see that Maurice was some what\r\ninspirited by the prospect of dining, he put on a good-humoured air and\r\nanswered: \'Well, no, I have no idea as to that, and if he\'s got to be\r\nkilled without being hurt----\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I don\'t care a fig about that,\' interrupted Lapoulle, I\'ll manage\r\nit, you\'ll see.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Jean and Maurice had seated themselves in the ditch, the waiting\r\nwas resumed. From time to time one of the party rose up to make sure\r\nthat the horse was still on the same spot, stretching its neck towards\r\nthe fresh breezes from the Meuse, towards the setting sun, as though\r\nto drink in the life that lingered there. Then, as the twilight slowly\r\nfell, all six men rose up to continue their savage watch, impatient\r\nfor the laggard night, and glancing on all sides with wild anxiety to\r\nascertain if anyone were observing them.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! dash it!\' suddenly exclaimed Chouteau, \'now\'s the time.\'\r\n\r\nThe surrounding landscape was still broadly defined in the equivocal\r\nowl\'s light which now prevailed. And Lapoulle ran up the first,\r\nfollowed by the five others. He had picked up a large round stone in\r\nthe ditch, and he rushed upon the horse and began to batter its skull,\r\nwith his arms stiffly outstretched as though they had formed a club.\r\nAt the second blow, however, the horse made an attempt to get up.\r\nChouteau and Loubet, standing over its legs, were trying to hold them\r\ndown, and calling to the others to help them. The animal neighed in a\r\nterrified, dolorous, almost human voice, struggled to rise, and would\r\nhave shattered them like glass had it not been already half dead of\r\nstarvation. Its head continued moving, and Lapoulle\'s blows missed\r\ntheir aim, so that he was unable to despatch it.\r\n\r\n\'Curse it! how hard the brute\'s bones are! Hold him so that I can\r\nsettle him.\'\r\n\r\nJean and Maurice, whose hearts were frozen, did not hear Chouteau\r\ncalling to them, but stood by with hanging arms, unable to make up\r\ntheir minds to intervene. And, all at once, Pache dropped upon his\r\nknees--in an instinctive impulse of religious pity--joined his hands,\r\nand began stammering prayers such as are said at the bedside of the\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nOnce more did Lapoulle miss his aim, merely tearing off one of the ears\r\nof the wretched horse, which fell back, giving vent to a loud cry.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a bit,\' growled Chouteau. \'We must settle him, or we shall be\r\ncaught. Don\'t let go, Loubet.\'\r\n\r\nHe had just taken his knife from his pocket, a little knife, the blade\r\nof which was not much longer than the finger. And, stretched upon the\r\nanimal\'s body, with one arm passed round its neck, he dug this blade\r\ninto the live flesh, and searched it, cutting and hacking, until he\r\nhad found and severed the artery. He had bounded aside when the blood\r\nspurted forth, gushing as from a pipe, whilst the animal\'s feet stirred\r\nfeebly, and great convulsive shudders coursed over its skin. Nearly\r\nfive minutes elapsed before it was dead. Its large dilated eyes were\r\nturned, with an expression of doleful fright, upon the haggard men who\r\nwere waiting for its death. At last they grew dim, and, all at once,\r\ntheir light was extinguished. Pache was still upon his knees stammering\r\na prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal no longer stirred, they were greatly embarrassed as to\r\nhow they could cut a nice joint off it. Loubet, who had plied every\r\ncalling, certainly pointed out how they ought to proceed if they wanted\r\nto secure the fillet; but it was dark, and having nothing but that\r\nlittle knife, he proved a clumsy butcher, and fairly lost himself amid\r\nall that warm flesh, still palpitating with life. And the impatient\r\nLapoulle, having decided to help him by opening the belly, when there\r\nwas no necessity to do so, the carnage became something abominable; all\r\nwas ferocious haste amid the spilt blood and strewn entrails; they were\r\nlike wolves raking the carcase of the prey with their fangs.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what piece it can be,\' at last said Loubet, rising up,\r\nhis arms laden with a huge chunk of meat. \'At any rate, there\'s enough\r\nhere to fill us up to our eyes.\'\r\n\r\nOvercome with horror, Jean and Maurice averted their heads. Hunger was\r\ntorturing them, however, and they followed the band when it galloped\r\naway in dread lest it should be surprised near the slaughtered horse.\r\nChouteau, by the way, had just made a find--two large beets, which had\r\nbeen overlooked in the field, and which he carried away. To disburden\r\nhis arms Loubet flung the meat upon Lapoulle\'s shoulders, whilst Pache\r\ncarried the squad\'s pot which they had been lugging about with them so\r\nas to have it handy should their hunt be successful. And the six men\r\ngalloped and galloped along without drawing breath, as though they were\r\nbeing pursued.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, Loubet stopped his comrades. \'This is stupid; the\r\nquestion is, where are we going to cook it?\'\r\n\r\nJean, who was recovering his wits, suggested the quarries, which were\r\nnot more than three hundred yards away; in one or another of the\r\ncavities there they could kindle a fire without being seen. When they\r\nreached the spot, however, all sorts of difficulties arose. First\r\ncame the question of wood. Fortunately they discovered a roadmender\'s\r\nbarrow, the planks of which Lapoulle split with his heels. Then there\r\nwas no drinkable water. The little pools of rain-water had been dried\r\nup by the sun during the afternoon. No doubt there was a pump, but it\r\nwas much too far away, at Glaire Tower; and besides, to get any water\r\nfrom it you had to join a procession and wait for hours, and might deem\r\nyourself fortunate if, just as your turn had come to fill your tin,\r\nsome comrade did not upset it with his elbow in the scramble. As for\r\nthe few wells in the neighbourhood, these had been dry for a couple\r\nof days past, and the buckets only brought up so much mud. Thus the\r\nonly available water was that of the Meuse, the bank of which was just\r\nacross the road.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go there with the pot,\' suggested Jean.\r\n\r\nBut the others protested. \'No, no, we don\'t want to be poisoned, the\r\nriver\'s full of corpses.\'\r\n\r\nThis was true, large numbers of dead men and horses were drifting down\r\nthe Meuse. They passed by at every moment, inflated, green, already\r\nmortifying. Many of them had caught in the herbage near the banks, and\r\nremained there, poisoning the atmosphere, whilst the current stirred\r\nthem with a continuous quivering. And nearly all the soldiers who\r\nhad drunk of that abominable water had been seized with nausea and\r\ndysentery, following upon frightful colics.\r\n\r\nStill they had to resign themselves to it, Maurice explaining that it\r\nwould hardly be dangerous after being boiled. \'Then I\'ll go,\' repeated\r\nJean, taking Lapoulle with him.\r\n\r\nBlack night had fallen by the time the pot, full of meat and water,\r\nhad been got on the fire. Loubet had peeled the beets to cook them\r\nin the broth; \'\'twould make a ragout fit for the other world,\' he\r\nremarked. And they all of them urged on the flames, slipping the\r\nremnants of the barrow under the pot, whilst their big shadows danced\r\nabout in a fantastic way in the depths of the rocky cavity. At last it\r\nbecame impossible for them to wait any longer, they threw themselves\r\non the filthy broth and tore the meat to pieces with their trembling,\r\nclutching fingers, too impatient even to use Chouteau\'s little knife.\r\nBut, despite all their efforts, their stomachs rose. It was the lack\r\nof salt that caused them the most disgust; their stomachs refused to\r\nretain that insipid, pappy beetroot, that half-cooked glutinous flesh\r\nwith an argillaceous flavour. They almost immediately began to vomit.\r\nPache could not go on eating, Chouteau and Loubet heaped insults on\r\nthat brute of a horse which they had had so much trouble to kill, and\r\nwhich now made their stomachs ache. Lapoulle was the only one who dined\r\ncopiously; however, he almost died of it during the night, after he\r\nhad gone back with the three others to sleep under the poplars of the\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nOn the way, Maurice, catching hold of Jean\'s arm, had, without\r\nspeaking, dragged him into a by-path. He felt furiously disgusted with\r\nhis comrades, and had formed the plan of sleeping in the little wood\r\nwhere he had spent his first night on the peninsula. The idea was a\r\ngood one, and Jean strongly approved of it when he stretched himself in\r\nthe sloping soil, which he found quite dry, under the thick foliage.\r\nThey remained there till it was broad daylight, falling even into a\r\ndeep sleep which brought them back some strength.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Thursday, but they no longer knew how they were\r\nliving, they simply felt pleased at observing that the fine weather\r\nseemed to have set in again. Despite Maurice\'s repugnance, Jean\r\nprevailed on him to return to the canal bank to see if their regiment\r\nwould not leave the peninsula that morning. Every day now some of the\r\nprisoners, columns a thousand and twelve hundred strong, were being\r\nsent off to the German fortresses. A couple of days previously, in\r\nfront of the Prussian guard-house, Jean had seen a convoy of officers\r\nand generals who were going to Pont-\xc3\xa0-Mousson to take the train there.\r\nA feverish, furious longing to get away from that frightful Camp of\r\nMisery prevailed among one and all. Ah! if their own turn could only\r\nhave come, thought Maurice and the corporal; and they were quite in\r\ndespair when they found the 106th still encamped on the canal bank, in\r\nthe growing disorder caused by so much suffering.\r\n\r\nThat day, however, they thought they would succeed in getting something\r\nto eat. Quite a trade had sprung up since the morning between the\r\nprisoners and the Bavarians on the other side of the canal. Money\r\nwas flung to the latter in handkerchiefs, which were thrown back\r\nwrapped round some coarse brown bread or common damp tobacco. Even the\r\nprisoners who had no money managed to secure something by throwing\r\nover their white regulation gloves, which seemed to have taken the\r\nBavarians\' fancy. For a couple of hours this barbarous mode of exchange\r\nwas kept up all along the canal, across which packets were continually\r\nflying. However, when Maurice flung over a five-franc piece, wrapped\r\nin his necktie, the Bavarian who sent him a loaf in exchange threw it\r\nin such a clumsy or tricky fashion that it fell flop into the water,\r\nwhereat the Germans burst into a loud guffaw. Twice did Maurice repeat\r\nthe experiment, and twice the loaf sent back to him dived into the\r\ncanal. On hearing the roars of laughter which arose, some Bavarian\r\nofficers ran up and prohibited their men from selling anything to the\r\nprisoners under penalty of severe punishment. The traffic then ceased,\r\nand Jean had to exert himself to calm Maurice, who was shaking his\r\nfists at those thieves yonder, shouting to them to throw him back his\r\nfive-franc pieces.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its bright sunshine the day proved a terrible one. There\r\nwere two alerts, two bugle calls, on hearing which Jean hastened to\r\nthe shed, where rations were said to be distributed. But on both\r\noccasions, he only secured some digs in the ribs, during the scramble.\r\nThe Prussians, so remarkably well organised themselves, continued\r\ndisplaying a brutal indifference with regard to the vanquished army.\r\nGenerals Douay and Lebrun having protested against this inhuman\r\ntreatment, they certainly sent a few sheep and some cart-loads of\r\nbread to the peninsula, but there was such an absence of method and\r\nprecaution that the sheep were carried off and the carts ransacked as\r\nsoon as they had crossed the bridge, so that the troops encamped more\r\nthan a hundred yards away were no better off than before. In fact,\r\nthe prowlers and pillagers were about the only ones who succeeded\r\nin filling their maws. Jean scented the trick, and ended by leading\r\nMaurice towards the bridge, so that they might wait and watch there for\r\nthe arrival of provisions.\r\n\r\nIt was already four o\'clock and they had as yet eaten nothing that\r\nlovely, sunshiny day, when all at once they were delighted to catch\r\nsight of Delaherche. A few of the townspeople of Sedan had, with\r\ngreat difficulty, obtained permission to go and see the prisoners, to\r\nwhom they carried provisions; and Maurice had several times already\r\nexpressed surprise at receiving no news of his sister. As soon as they\r\nespied Delaherche, carrying a large basket and with a loaf of bread\r\ntucked under either arm, they sprang forward to meet him, but once\r\nagain they came up too late. Such was the rush, indeed, that the basket\r\nand one of the loaves vanished without the manufacturer himself being\r\nable to understand how they had been torn away from him.\r\n\r\nEager as he was for popularity, he had crossed the bridge with a smile\r\non his lips and an air of affable good fellowship, but now he was\r\naltogether upset and stupefied. \'Ah! my poor friends,\' he stammered.\r\n\r\nJean had already taken possession of the remaining loaf, and\r\nvigorously defended it; and whilst he and Maurice were devouring the\r\nbread by the roadside, Delaherche told them the news. His wife, thank\r\nHeaven! was very well; but he was anxious about the colonel, who\r\nhad become extremely depressed, although Madame Delaherche, senior,\r\ncontinued keeping him company from morn till night.\r\n\r\n\'And my sister?\' asked Maurice.\r\n\r\n\'Your sister, ah yes! She came with me, it was she who brought the two\r\nloaves. Only she had to stay yonder, on the other side of the canal.\r\nBeg as we might, the sentries would not let her pass. The Prussians,\r\nyou know, have given strict orders that women are not to be allowed on\r\nthe peninsula.\'\r\n\r\nThen he went on talking of Henriette and of her futile endeavours to\r\nsee her brother and assist him. One day, in the streets of Sedan,\r\nchance had brought her face to face with cousin Gunther, the captain in\r\nthe Prussian Guards. He was passing along with that stern forbidding\r\nair of his, pretending not to recognise her, and she herself, feeling\r\nher heart rise as though she were in presence of one of her husband\'s\r\nmurderers, had at the first moment hastened her steps. Then in a sudden\r\nveering which she could not account for, she had turned back after him,\r\nand in a harsh, reproachful voice, had told him everything, especially\r\nhow her husband had been shot at Bazeilles. And on thus hearing of his\r\nrelative\'s frightful death, he had made but an ambiguous gesture; it\r\nwas the fortune of war, he also might have been killed. His soldier\'s\r\nface barely twitched as he learnt the news. Then, when she spoke to him\r\nof her brother who was a prisoner, begging that he would intervene so\r\nthat she might obtain permission to see him, he refused to do so. Such\r\nintervention was not allowed, he said; the orders were strict; and he\r\nspoke of his superior\'s orders as though they were Divine commandments.\r\nOn leaving him, Henriette clearly realised that he deemed himself a\r\njusticiar, and was swayed by all the intolerance and arrogance of an\r\nhereditary enemy, who had grown up hating the race which he was now\r\nchastising.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' concluded Delaherche, \'at all events you will have had some\r\nlittle to eat this evening. What worries me is that I fear I sha\'n\'t be\r\nable to get another permit to come here.\'\r\n\r\nHe then asked them if they had any commissions, and obligingly took\r\ncharge of some letters, written in pencil, which other soldiers\r\nconfided to him, for the Bavarians had been seen laughing and lighting\r\ntheir pipes with the missives which they had promised to forward.\r\nThen, whilst Maurice and Jean were accompanying him back to the bridge,\r\nhe suddenly exclaimed: \'Look! there\'s Henriette yonder. Can\'t you see\r\nher waving her handkerchief?\'\r\n\r\nIndeed, among the throng behind the line of sentinels, a thin little\r\nface could be espied, a white speck, as it were, palpitating in the\r\nsunlight. Greatly affected, with their eyes moist, both soldiers\r\nimmediately raised their arms and answered with an energetic wave of\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nThe morrow, a Friday, proved the most fearful day that Maurice had\r\nspent on the peninsula. True enough, after passing another quiet night\r\nin the little wood, he had been lucky enough to get some bread to\r\neat; Jean having discovered an old woman at the ch\xc3\xa2teau of Villette\r\nwho had some for sale, at the moderate price of ten francs the pound.\r\nLater on that day, however, they both witnessed a frightful scene, the\r\nnightmare-like memory of which long haunted them.\r\n\r\nChouteau had noticed the previous evening that Pache no longer\r\ncomplained, but was going about with a lightsome, contented air, like\r\na man who has eaten his fill. The idea at once occurred to him that\r\nthe slyboots must have a hidden store somewhere; and he was confirmed\r\nin this impression in the morning when he saw Pache go off for nearly\r\nan hour, and come back smiling slyly, with his mouth still full. Some\r\nwindfall must certainly have come to him; he had probably got hold of\r\nsome provisions or other in one of the scrambles. Thereupon Chouteau\r\nset himself the task of stirring up Loubet and Lapoulle, especially the\r\nlatter. \'Ah!\' said he, \'what a dirty cur that fellow Pache must be, to\r\nhave some grub and not to share it with his comrades. I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat, we\'ll follow him this evening. We\'ll just see if he\'ll dare to\r\ngorge himself all alone, when other poor devils are kicking the bucket\r\nall round him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, we\'ll follow him!\' Lapoulle angrily repeated. \'We\'ll just\r\nsee what it means.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, the colossus clenched his fists, maddened by the idea of\r\ngetting something to eat. He experienced even greater suffering than\r\nthe others, on account of his terrible appetite; indeed, his torment\r\nbecame at times so intense that he had even tried to chew the grass. He\r\nhad secured nothing else to eat since two days previously, since the\r\nnight, in fact, when the horseflesh and beetroot had given him such a\r\nfrightful attack of dysentery. Despite his great strength, he was so\r\nclumsy with his big limbs that he had not been able to secure anything\r\nwhen the provision carts were pillaged. He would now have given his\r\nblood for a pound of bread.\r\n\r\nWhen night was falling Pache glided away among the trees of Glaire\r\nTower, and the three others cautiously crept after him. \'We mustn\'t\r\nrouse his suspicions,\' repeated Chouteau. \'Be careful, he might look\r\nback.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, after going another hundred yards or so, Pache evidently\r\nfancied himself alone, for he began walking rapidly without casting\r\na glance behind. They were thus easily able to follow him to the\r\nneighbouring quarries, and came up behind him just as he was moving two\r\nlarge stones to take a half loaf of bread from under them. This was all\r\nthat remained of his hoard, just enough to make one more meal.\r\n\r\n\'You dirty black-beetle!\' shouted Lapoulle. \'So that\'s why you hide\r\nyourself, is it? You\'ll just give me that. It\'s my share.\'\r\n\r\nGive his bread, indeed! Why should he give it? However puny he might\r\nbe, his anger made him draw himself erect, pressing the bread to his\r\nheart with all the strength he possessed. He, also, was hungry. \'Mind\r\nyour own business!\' he answered, \'it\'s mine!\'\r\n\r\nThen, at sight of Lapoulle\'s raised fist, he darted away, galloping\r\ndown from the quarries towards the bare fields in the direction of\r\nDonchery. The three others pursued him, panting, as fast as their legs\r\ncould carry them. He gained ground, however, being lighter than they\r\nwere, so frightened too, and so bent on not losing his bread, that\r\nit seemed as though the wind were carrying him away. He had already\r\ngone more than a thousand yards, and was nearing the little wood on\r\nthe river bank, when he overtook Jean and Maurice, who were returning\r\nto their night quarters there. As he rushed by he raised a cry of\r\ndistress, whilst they, astounded at sight of this man-hunt so wildly\r\ngalloping past them, stopped short at the edge of a field, where they\r\nremained watching. And thus it was that they saw everything.\r\n\r\nStumbling against a stone, Pache unhappily fell to the ground. The\r\nthree others were already coming up, swearing and howling, maddened by\r\ntheir run, like wolves overtaking their prey.\r\n\r\n\'Give it me, thunder!\' shouted Lapoulle, \'or I\'ll settle your hash!\'\r\nAnd he was again raising his fist when Chouteau, after opening the\r\nlittle knife that had served to slaughter the horse, passed it to him,\r\nexclaiming: \'Here! take the knife.\'\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, Jean had darted forward to prevent an affray.\r\nHe also was losing his head, and talked of sending them all to the\r\nguard-room; whereat Loubet, with an evil grin, told him he must be a\r\nPrussian, for there were no officers left, so to say, the Prussians\r\nalone now exercising authority.\r\n\r\n\'D----!\' repeated Lapoulle, \'will you give me that bread?\'\r\n\r\nDespite the terror that blanched his face, Pache hugged the bread yet\r\nmore closely to his chest, with the obstinacy of a famished peasant,\r\nwho will never part with anything belonging to him.\r\n\r\n\'No!\'\r\n\r\nThen in a trice it was all over; the brute planted the knife in his\r\nthroat with such violence that he did not even raise a cry. His arms\r\nrelaxed, and the hunk of bread rolled to the ground, into the blood\r\nthat had spurted from the wound.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this mad, imbecile murder, Maurice, hitherto motionless,\r\nseemed all at once to lose his reason. Shaking his fists at the three\r\nmen, he called them assassins with such vehemence that his frame shook\r\nfrom head to foot. Lapoulle, however, did not even seem to hear him.\r\nStill crouching on the ground near the corpse, he was devouring the\r\nblood-splashed bread with an air of fierce stupor, as though stunned by\r\nthe loud noise of his own jaws; and he appeared so terrible whilst he\r\nthus satisfied his craving appetite, that Chouteau and Loubet did not\r\neven dare to ask him for their share.\r\n\r\nNight had now completely gathered in, a clear night with a beautiful\r\nstarry sky; and Maurice and Jean, who had betaken themselves to the\r\nlittle wood, were soon only able to see Lapoulle, who went wandering up\r\nand down the river-bank. Chouteau and Loubet had disappeared, they had\r\nno doubt gone back to the canal-bank, uneasy with regard to that corpse\r\nwhich they were leaving behind them. Lapoulle, on the contrary, seemed\r\nafraid to go and join his comrades. Oppressed by the weight of that\r\nbig chunk of bread which he had swallowed too fast, he was now, too,\r\nafter the dizziness of the murder-moment, seized with an anguish which\r\nmade motion a necessity; and not daring to turn back along the road,\r\nacross which the corpse was lying, he tramped incessantly along the\r\nsteep river-bank, with a wavering, irresolute step. Was remorse already\r\ndawning in the depths of that dark soul? Or was it not simply the fear\r\nof discovery? He paced up and down like a wild beast before the bars\r\nof its cage, with a sudden, growing longing to flee, a longing which\r\nwas painful like a physical ailment, and which he felt would cause his\r\ndeath if he did not satisfy it. Quick, quick, he must at once get out\r\nof that prison where he had killed. And yet, despite that eager desire,\r\nhe all at once sank down, and for a long time remained wallowing among\r\nthe rushes on the bank.\r\n\r\nMeantime Maurice, in his horror and disgust, was saying to Jean:\r\n\'Listen, I can\'t stay here a moment longer. It will drive me mad, I\r\nassure you--I\'m astonished that my body has held out--my health is not\r\nso bad--but I\'m losing my head, I\'m losing it sure enough--I shall\r\nbe lost if you leave me another day in this hell. Let\'s get off, I\r\nbeg of you, let\'s get off.\' And thereupon he began unfolding various\r\nextravagant plans of escape which he had formed. They would swim across\r\nthe Meuse, spring upon the sentinels, and strangle them with a bit\r\nof rope which he had in his pocket; or else they would stone them to\r\ndeath; or else bribe them and put on their uniforms so as to make their\r\nway through the Prussian lines.\r\n\r\n\'Be quiet, youngster,\' repeated Jean, despairingly. \'It frightens me to\r\nhear you say such foolish things. Is there any sense in it all, is it\r\npossible to get away as you think? Wait till to-morrow, we\'ll see what\r\nhappens. And now don\'t talk about it any more.\'\r\n\r\nFor his own part, although his heart was overflowing with anger and\r\ndisgust, although he was greatly weakened by privation, he still\r\nretained his common sense amid all that nightmare-kind of life which\r\nverged on the profoundest depths of human misery. And as his comrade\r\nbecame more and more desperate and wished to fling himself into the\r\nMeuse, he had to hold him back and even do him violence, alternately\r\nscolding and supplicating, with tears standing in his eyes. \'There!\r\nlook!\' he exclaimed all at once.\r\n\r\nThe water had just splashed, and they saw that Lapoulle had made up his\r\nmind to slip into the river after doffing his capote, for fear lest\r\nit might impede his movements. His shirt could be plainly descried,\r\nforming a whitish spot on the bosom of the black, flowing water. He was\r\nswimming slowly upstream, doubtless on the look-out for some spot where\r\nhe might land. Meantime, on the opposite bank, the slim silhouettes\r\nof the motionless sentinels could be plainly distinguished. Then,\r\nall at once, a flash rent the night asunder, and a report crackled,\r\nre-echoing as far as the rocks of Montimont. The river merely bubbled\r\nas though struck downward by a pair of oars, and that was all; forsaken\r\nand inert, Lapoulle\'s body, the white speck on the dark water, began\r\nfloating away, carried along by the current.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the morrow, which was Saturday, Jean again brought\r\nMaurice back to the camping-ground of the 106th in the hope that they\r\nmight be leaving the peninsula that day. But there were no orders; it\r\nseemed as though the regiment had been forgotten. Many had now taken\r\ntheir departure, the camp was emptying, and those who were still left\r\nin it sank more and more deeply into the blues. For eight long days\r\ninsanity had been germinating and spreading in that hell. The rain, no\r\ndoubt, had given over, but the oppressive, burning sunlight had only\r\nwrought a change of torture. The excessive heat put the finishing touch\r\nto the men\'s exhaustion, and imparted an alarming epidemical character\r\nto the attacks of dysentery. What with nausea and diarrh\xc5\x93a, this army\r\nof sick men quite poisoned the atmosphere in which it lived. It was no\r\nlonger possible to skirt the banks either of the Meuse or the canal, so\r\nfoul had become the stench of the drowned horses and soldiers rotting\r\namong the herbage. Moreover, the horses which had died of starvation\r\nlay putrefying in the fields, exhaling such a pestilence that the\r\nPrussians began to fear for themselves, and bringing picks and shovels,\r\ncompelled the prisoners to bury the bodies.\r\n\r\nThat Saturday, by the way, the famine ceased. As their numbers were\r\nnow greatly reduced, and provisions were coming in from all sides, the\r\ncaptives passed, all at once, from extreme destitution to the most\r\nabundant plenty. There was no lack of bread or meat, or even wine, and\r\nthey ate from dawn till sunset, to the point of killing themselves.\r\nNight fell and some were still eating, and even went on eating till the\r\nfollowing morning. And naturally enough many of them gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day Jean\'s one preoccupation was to keep a watch on\r\nMaurice, for he realised that the young fellow was now ripe for any\r\nextravagant action. Heated by wine he had even talked of cuffing a\r\nGerman officer in order that he might be sent away. Accordingly, in the\r\nevening, having discovered a vacant corner in the cellar of one of the\r\noutbuildings of Glaire Tower, Jean thought it prudent to go and sleep\r\nthere with his companion, in the hope that the latter would be calmed\r\nby a good night\'s rest. But it proved the most fearful night of their\r\nwhole sojourn in the camp, a perfect night of horrors, during which\r\nthey were not once able to close their eyes. Other soldiers helped to\r\nfill the cellar, and among them were two men lying side by side in the\r\nsame corner, and dying of dysentery. As soon as the darkness had come,\r\nthese two did not cease complaining, with hollow groans, inarticulate\r\ncries, followed at last by a death-rattle which became louder and\r\nlouder, sounding so awful in the pitchy darkness that the other men who\r\nwere lying there, longing to sleep, became quite enraged, and called to\r\nthe dying soldiers to hold their peace. But the latter did not hear,\r\nand the rattle went on, ceasing for a moment perhaps every now and\r\nthen, but suddenly breaking forth anew, and then drowning every other\r\nsound; whilst, in the intervals, the drunken clamour of the comrades\r\nwho were still eating, unable to satisfy themselves, was wafted from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nThen Maurice\'s agony began. He had tried to flee from that plaint of\r\natrocious pain, which brought the sweat of anguish to his brow; but\r\nwhilst he was rising and fumbling he stumbled over some outstretched\r\nlimbs and fell to the ground again, walled up, as it were, with those\r\ndying men. And he made no further attempt to escape. A vision of the\r\nwhole frightful disaster was rising up before him, from the time of\r\ntheir departure from Rheims to the crushing blow of Sedan. It seemed\r\nto him also as though the passion of the Army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons were only\r\nthat night coming to an end, amid the inky blackness of that cellar,\r\nresounding with the death-rattle of those two soldiers who prevented\r\ntheir comrades from sleeping. The army of despair, the expiatory\r\nflock, offered up as a holocaust, had, at each of its Stations,[39]\r\npaid for the faults of all with the red flood of its blood. And, now,\r\ningloriously slaughtered and beslavered, it was sinking to martyrdom\r\nbeneath a more brutal chastisement than it had deserved. \'Twas too\r\nmuch, Maurice was boiling over with anger, hungering for justice,\r\nburning to avenge himself on Destiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning twilight appeared one of the two soldiers was dead,\r\nbut the other\'s throat was still rattling.\r\n\r\n\'Come on, youngster,\' said Jean, gently; \'we\'ll go and get some fresh\r\nair, that will be best.\'\r\n\r\nStrolling along in the pure morning air, which was already warm, they\r\nskirted the steep river-bank till they again found themselves near the\r\nvillage of Iges. And then Maurice suddenly became more excited than\r\never, shaking his fist at the far-spreading, sunlit horizon of the\r\nbattlefield, which was spread out before him, the plateau of Illy just\r\nopposite, St. Menges on his left, and the wood of La Garenne on his\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n\'No, no!\' he cried. \'I cannot--I cannot bear the sight of all that any\r\nlonger! It pierces my heart and drives me mad! Take me away, take me\r\naway at once!\'\r\n\r\nThat day was again a Sunday; the pealing of church bells was wafted\r\nfrom Sedan, and a German regimental band could already be heard playing\r\nin the distance. However, there were still no orders for the 106th,\r\nand, frightened by Maurice\'s growing delirium, Jean made up his mind\r\nto try a plan which he had been nursing since the previous day. On\r\nthe road, in front of the German guard-house, preparations were being\r\nmade for the departure of another regiment, the 5th of the Line. Great\r\nconfusion prevailed in the column, which an officer, who spoke very\r\nindifferent French, could not succeed in counting. And thereupon Jean\r\nand Maurice, having torn off both the collars and buttons of their\r\nuniforms, in order that the number of their regiment might not betray\r\nthem, slipped into the midst of the throng, crossed the bridge, and\r\nthus at last found themselves on the road. The same idea must have\r\noccurred to Chouteau and Loubet, whom they espied behind them, glancing\r\nnervously on either side, like the murderers they were.\r\n\r\nAh! how great was the relief of those first happy moments! Now that\r\nthey were outside their prison, it seemed like a resurrection, a return\r\nto living light and boundless air, the flowery awakening of every hope.\r\nAnd whatever might be their misfortunes now, they feared them not, they\r\ncould afford to laugh at them, for had they not emerged unscathed from\r\nthe frightful nightmare of the Camp of Misery?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE-DRIVERS--A BID FOR FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nThat morning, for the last time, had Jean and Maurice heard the gay\r\ncalls of the French bugles, and now they were marching along the\r\nroad to Germany among the drove of prisoners, which was preceded and\r\nfollowed by platoons of Prussian soldiers, others of whom, with fixed\r\nbayonets, kept a watch upon the captives on either hand. And now they\r\nonly heard the shrill, dismal notes of the German trumpets at each\r\nguard-post that they passed.\r\n\r\nMaurice was delighted to find that the column turned to the left, so\r\nthat it would evidently pass through Sedan. Perhaps he would be lucky\r\nenough to catch a glimpse of his sister there. However, the three-mile\r\nmarch from the peninsula of Iges to the town, sufficed to damp the\r\njoy he felt at having emerged from that cesspool where he had been\r\nagonising for nine long days. This pitiable convoy of prisoners, of\r\ndisarmed soldiers with hanging arms, led away like so many sheep, at a\r\nhasty, timorous scamper, was but a fresh form of torture. Clad in rags,\r\nsoiled with the filth in which they had been abandoned, emaciated by\r\nmore than a week\'s privation, they now looked like so many vagabonds,\r\nsuspicious tramps picked up along the roads by some scouring party of\r\ngendarmes. By the time they had reached the suburb of Torcy, where men\r\npaused on the side-walks and women came to their doors to gaze at them\r\nwith an expression of gloomy compassion, Maurice already felt stifling,\r\nand bowed his head, his mouth twitching with the bitterness of his\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\nJean, however, endowed with a practical mind and a tougher skin,\r\nthought only of their foolishness in neglecting to bring a couple of\r\nloaves of bread away with them. In the wild haste of their departure\r\nthey had come away, indeed, with their stomachs empty, and hunger\r\nwas once again weakening their legs. Other captives must have been\r\nsimilarly situated, for many of them held out money, begging the people\r\nof Torcy to sell them something. One very tall fellow, who looked\r\nextremely ill, waved a bit of gold, with his long arm raised over the\r\nheads of the soldiers of the escort, and was in despair that he could\r\nfind nothing to buy. Just then Jean, who was watching, espied a dozen\r\nloaves in a pile, outside a baker\'s shop, some little distance ahead.\r\nBefore any of the others he threw down a five-franc piece, intending\r\nto take a couple of the loaves. Then, as one of the Prussian soldiers\r\nbrutally pushed him back, he obstinately made an effort to regain his\r\nmoney. But the captain in charge of the column, a bald-headed little\r\nman with a brutal face, was already rushing up. Raising his revolver\r\nwith the butt downward over Jean\'s head, he declared with an oath\r\nthat he would split the skull of the first man who dared to stir. And\r\nthereupon they all bent their backs and lowered their eyes, continuing\r\ntheir march with a subdued tramp, the quailing submissiveness of a\r\nflock of sheep.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! how I should like to slap him,\' muttered Maurice savagely, \'box\r\nhis ears, and smash his teeth with a back-hander.\'\r\n\r\nFrom that moment he could not bear to look at that captain, whose\r\nscornful face he so desired to smack. They were now entering Sedan,\r\ncrossing the bridge over the Meuse, and not a moment passed without\r\nsome fresh scene of brutality. A woman, a mother doubtless, was\r\ndesirous of embracing a young sergeant, but was pushed back so\r\nviolently with the butt of a gun, that she fell to the ground. On the\r\nPlace Turenne some well-to-do townsfolk were belaboured because they\r\ncompassionately threw provisions to the prisoners. In the High Street\r\none of the captives, having slipped down in trying to take a bottle\r\nof wine offered to him by a lady, was kicked to his feet again. And\r\nalthough, during the last eight days, Sedan had frequently seen the\r\nmiserable herds of the defeat driven through its streets in this same\r\nbrutal fashion, it could not accustom itself to the spectacle, but at\r\neach fresh _d\xc3\xa9fil\xc3\xa9_ was stirred by a fever of compassion and resentment.\r\n\r\nJean, who by this time had grown calm again, was, like Maurice,\r\nthinking of Henriette; and, all at once, too, the idea that they might\r\nsee Delaherche occurred to him. He nudged his comrade and remarked:\r\n\'Keep your eyes open by-and-by if we pass down the street.\'\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, as soon as they entered the Rue Maqua, they caught sight\r\nof several heads peering forth from one of the monumental windows\r\nof the factory, and as they drew nearer, they recognised Delaherche\r\nand his wife Gilberte, with their elbows resting on the window bar,\r\nwhilst behind them stood Madame Delaherche senior, erect, with a stern\r\nexpression on her face. They all three had some loaves with them, and\r\nthese Delaherche flung to the famished captives who were holding up\r\ntrembling, imploring hands.\r\n\r\nMaurice immediately noticed that his sister was not one of the party;\r\nwhilst Jean, on seeing so many loaves rain down, became all anxiety,\r\nfearing that none would remain for them. He waved his arm frantically\r\nand called: \'For us! For us!\'\r\n\r\nThe Delaherches evinced an almost joyous surprise. Their faces, pale\r\nwith pity, immediately brightened, and gestures expressive of their\r\npleasure at the meeting escaped them. Gilberte herself wished to throw\r\nthe last loaf into Jean\'s arms, and did so in such a charmingly awkward\r\nway that she could not restrain a pretty laugh at her own expense.\r\n\r\nUnable to halt, Maurice turned his head, and with the greatest rapidity\r\ncalled in an anxious, questioning tone: \'And Henriette? Henriette?\'\r\n\r\nDelaherche answered in a long phrase which was drowned by the tramping\r\nof the men. He must have realised that the young fellow had not heard\r\nhim, for immediately afterwards he began making a variety of signs,\r\npointing especially towards the South. However, the column was already\r\nentering the Rue du M\xc3\xa9nil, and the factory fa\xc3\xa7ade was lost to sight,\r\ntogether with the three heads protruding from the window, and a hand\r\nwhich was waving a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'What did he say to you?\' asked Jean.\r\n\r\nMaurice, sorely worried, was still vainly looking behind him. \'I don\'t\r\nknow, I didn\'t understand--I shall be anxious now, as long as I don\'t\r\nget some news.\'\r\n\r\nAnd meantime the tramping continued, the Prussians hastened the march\r\nwith the brutality of conquerors, and the wretched flock, stretched\r\ninto a narrow file, passed out of Sedan by the M\xc3\xa9nil Gate, scampering\r\nalong like sheep in fear of the dogs.\r\n\r\nAs they passed through Bazeilles, Jean and Maurice bethought themselves\r\nof Weiss, and looked for the ashes of the little house which had been\r\nso valiantly defended. During their sojourn at the Camp of Misery some\r\ncomrades had told them of the devastation of the village, the fires and\r\nthe massacres, but the sight they beheld surpassed all the abomination\r\nthey had pictured. Although twelve days had now elapsed since the\r\ndisaster, the piles of ruins were still smoking. Many damaged walls had\r\nfallen in, and in all this village of two thousand souls there were now\r\nnot ten houses standing. The captive soldiers were consoled somewhat,\r\nhowever, on meeting numerous barrows and carts full of Bavarian\r\nhelmets and rifles, which had been picked up since the struggle. This\r\nproof that a large number of these cut-throats and incendiaries had\r\nbeen slain, in some measure relieved the prisoners\' feelings.\r\n\r\nThey were to halt at Douzy, nominally for the purpose of breakfasting,\r\nand did not get there without having suffered. Exhausted, indeed, by\r\ntheir long fast, the captives were speedily fatigued. Those who had\r\ngorged themselves with food on the previous day, became giddy and\r\nheavy, and felt their legs sink beneath them; their gluttony, far\r\nfrom restoring their lost strength, had, in fact, only weakened them\r\nthe more. And so, when the column halted in a meadow on the left of\r\nthe village of Douzy, the unfortunate fellows flung themselves on the\r\ngrass, lacking even the energy to eat. There was no wine, and some\r\ncharitable women who endeavoured to approach, bringing a few bottles,\r\nwere driven away by the sentries. One of them, badly frightened, fell\r\nand sprained her ankle, and then there were cries and tears, quite a\r\nrevolting scene, whilst the Prussians, who had confiscated the bottles\r\nof wine, proceeded to drink their contents. This tender compassion\r\nof the peasants for the poor soldiers who were being led away into\r\ncaptivity, was constantly manifested along the route; but on the other\r\nhand they were said to display great harshness towards the general\r\nofficers. A few days previously the inhabitants of that very village of\r\nDouzy had hissed a convoy of generals who were proceeding on parole to\r\nPont-\xc3\xa0-Mousson. The roads were not safe for officers; men in blouses,\r\nsoldiers who had escaped the foe, or who had possibly deserted before\r\nthe fight, sprang upon them with pitchforks to massacre them, shouting\r\nthat they were cowards and had sold themselves; thus helping to ingraft\r\nthat legend of treachery which twenty years later still caused the\r\nfolks of these districts to speak with execration of all who were in\r\ncommand during that disastrous campaign.\r\n\r\nSeated on the grass, Maurice and Jean ate half of their loaf, and\r\nwere luckily able to wash it down with a drop of brandy, with which a\r\nworthy farmer managed to fill a flask they had. Then the starting off\r\nagain proved a terrible business. They were to sleep at Mouzon, but\r\nalthough the march was a short one, the effort they must needs make\r\nappeared more than they could accomplish. They were unable to rise\r\nwithout groaning, to such a point were their weary limbs stiffened by\r\nthe slightest rest. Several men whose feet were bleeding took off their\r\nboots to be able to resume the march. Dysentery was still wreaking\r\nhavoc among them; they had gone but a thousand yards or so when a first\r\nman fell and was pushed against the wayside bank. Farther on two others\r\nsank down beside a hedge, and it was night before an old woman came\r\nalong and succoured them. Those who kept up were tottering, leaning\r\non sticks which the Prussians, possibly in a spirit of derision, had\r\nallowed them to cut on the verge of a little wood. They had become a\r\nmere band of beggars covered with sores, emaciated, and scarce able\r\nto breathe. Yet their custodians continued treating them with great\r\nbrutality; those who stepped aside even to satisfy a want of nature\r\nwere whacked into the ranks again. The escort-platoon in the rear had\r\norders to drive on the laggards at the bayonet\'s point. A sergeant\r\nhaving refused to go any farther, the captain commanded two of his\r\nmen to catch hold of him under the arms, and drag him along till he\r\nconsented to walk afresh. Especially were the captives tortured by that\r\nbald-headed little officer, whose face they longed to slap, and who\r\nabused his knowledge of French to insult them in their own language, in\r\ncurt galling phrases, as cutting as the lashes of a whip.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! how I should like to hold him,\' Maurice passionately repeated,\r\n\'hold him, and drain him of all his blood, drop by drop.\'\r\n\r\nThe young fellow could no longer endure it all; he suffered, however,\r\nfar more from the anger he was compelled to restrain than from physical\r\nexhaustion. Everything exasperated him, even those jarring calls of the\r\nPrussian trumpets at which, in his enervated condition, he could have\r\nhowled like a dog. He felt that he should be unable to accomplish this\r\ncruel journey without getting his skull cracked. Even now in passing\r\nthrough the smallest hamlets he experienced intense suffering at sight\r\nof the women who looked at him with so deep an expression of pity. What\r\nwould it be then when they got to Germany, and the townsfolk scrambled\r\nto see them, and greeted them, as they greeted the other prisoners,\r\nwith insulting laughter? He pictured the cattle-trucks in which they\r\nwould be heaped together, the nauseating abominations and tortures of\r\nthe road, the dreary life in the fortresses under the snow-laden sky of\r\nwinter. No, no! rather death at once, rather the risk of leaving his\r\nskin at the turn of a road on the soil of France than rot over yonder,\r\nin some black casemate, possibly for long months.\r\n\r\n\'Listen,\' said he, in a low voice to Jean, who was walking beside him,\r\n\'we\'ll wait till we pass a wood, and then we\'ll jump aside and slip\r\nbetween the trees. The Belgian frontier isn\'t far, we shall surely find\r\nsome one or other to guide us.\'\r\n\r\nJean shuddered; despite the feeling of revolt which was making him also\r\ndream of escape, he yet retained his calmer, more practical mind. \'You\r\nare mad,\' he said. \'They would fire on us, and we should both be shot.\'\r\n\r\nBut there was a chance that they might not be hit, retorted Maurice;\r\nbesides, even supposing they were shot down, well, so much the better.\r\n\r\n\'But supposing we escaped,\' continued Jean, \'what would become of us in\r\nour uniforms? You can see very well that the country is covered with\r\nPrussian pickets. It would, at any rate, be necessary to have some\r\nother clothes. Yes, it\'s too dangerous, youngster. I can\'t let you do\r\nanything so foolish.\'\r\n\r\nIt became necessary that he should restrain the young fellow, and\r\nwhilst he strove to calm him with chiding but affectionate words, he\r\ncaught hold of his arm and pressed it closely to his side, so that\r\nthey appeared to be mutually supporting one another. They had taken\r\nbut a few steps, however, when some words exchanged in an undertone\r\nbehind them made them turn their heads. The whisperers were Chouteau\r\nand Loubet, who had started from the peninsula that morning at the\r\nsame time as themselves, and whom they had hitherto avoided. The two\r\nrascals were now at their heels, however, and Chouteau must have heard\r\nwhat Maurice had said of trying to escape through a plantation, for he\r\nadopted the idea on his own account. \'I say,\' he muttered, craning his\r\nhead forward so that they felt his breath on their necks, \'we\'ll join\r\nyou. That idea of sloping\'s a capital one. Some of the comrades have\r\nalready gone off, and we certainly can\'t let ourselves be dragged like\r\nso many dogs to the country where these pigs live. Is it agreed, eh?\r\nShall we four fellows take a breath of fresh air?\'\r\n\r\nMaurice was again growing feverish, and Jean turned round to say to the\r\ntempter: \'Well, if you\'re in a hurry, you can go on in front. What do\r\nyou hope for?\'\r\n\r\nUnder the corporal\'s searching gaze, Chouteau became disconcerted, and\r\nimprudently let the cat out of the bag. \'Well! it would be easier if\r\nthere were four of us,\' said he. \'One or two would always manage to get\r\noff.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, with an energetic shake of the head, Jean altogether\r\ndeclined taking part in the venture. He mistrusted Monsieur Chouteau,\r\nsaid he, and feared some act of treachery. However, he had to exert all\r\nhis authority over Maurice to prevent the young fellow from yielding to\r\nhis desire, for just then an opportunity presented itself; they were\r\npassing a very leafy little wood, which was merely separated from the\r\nroad by a field thickly dotted with bushes. To gallop across that field\r\nand disappear in the thickets, would not that mean safety and freedom?\r\n\r\nLoubet had so far said nothing. Firmly resolved, however, not to go and\r\nmoulder in Germany, he was sniffing the air with his restless nose,\r\nand watching for the favourable moment with those sharp eyes of his,\r\nlike the crafty fellow he was. Doubtless he relied on his legs and his\r\nartfulness, which had so far always helped him out of his scrapes. And\r\nall at once he made up his mind. \'Ah! dash it! I\'ve had enough. I\'m\r\noff.\'\r\n\r\nAt one bound he had sprung into the neighbouring field, and Chouteau,\r\nfollowing his example, galloped off beside him. Two men of the escort\r\nat once started in pursuit, without either of them thinking of stopping\r\nthe runaways with a bullet. It was all over so quickly that at the\r\nfirst moment one could hardly understand what had happened. However,\r\nit seemed as though Loubet, who had taken a zigzag course through the\r\nbushes, would certainly escape, whereas Chouteau, who was less nimble,\r\nalready appeared on the point of being recaptured. But with a supreme\r\neffort he all at once gained ground, and, on overtaking his comrade,\r\ncontrived to trip him up. And then, whilst the two Prussians were\r\nspringing upon the prostrate man to hold him down, the other bounded\r\ninto the wood and disappeared. A few shots were fired after him, the\r\nescort suddenly remembering its needle-guns, and a _battue_ was even\r\nattempted among the trees, but with no result.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two German soldiers were belabouring the prostrate\r\nLoubet. The captain had rushed to the spot, quite beside himself, and\r\nshouted that an example must be made; at which encouragement the men\r\ncontinued raining such savage kicks and blows with the butts of their\r\nguns upon the recaptured prisoner, that, on being raised from the\r\nground, he was found to have his skull split and an arm broken. Before\r\nthey reached Mouzon he expired in the little cart of a peasant, who had\r\nbeen willing to take him up.\r\n\r\n\'There, you see,\' Jean contented himself with muttering in Maurice\'s\r\near.\r\n\r\nThey both darted towards the impenetrable wood a glance which expressed\r\nall their hatred of the bandit who was now galloping off in liberty;\r\nand they ended by feeling full of pity for the poor devil, his victim;\r\na lickerish tooth, no doubt, not of much value certainly, but all the\r\nsame good company, full of expedients, and by no means a fool. Yet his\r\nfate had shown that no matter how artful a man might be, he inevitably\r\nfound his master and came to grief at last.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this terrible lesson, however, Maurice, on reaching Mouzon,\r\nwas still haunted by that fixed idea of escaping. They were all so\r\nfrightfully weary on their arrival that the Prussians had to help them\r\npitch the few tents which were placed at their disposal. The camp was\r\nformed near the town, on some low, marshy ground, and the worst was\r\nthat another column having occupied the same spot on the previous day,\r\nit was covered with filth, to protect themselves from which the men had\r\nto spread out a number of large flat stones, which they luckily found\r\nin a heap, near by. The evening proved less trying, as the watchfulness\r\nof the Prussians relaxed somewhat when their captain had gone off to\r\ntake up his quarters at an inn. The sentries began by letting some\r\nchildren throw apples and pears to the prisoners, and at last even\r\nallowed the inhabitants of the neighbourhood to enter the camp, so that\r\nthere was soon quite a little crowd of improvised hawkers there, men\r\nand women, selling bread, wine, and even cigars. All those who had any\r\nmoney ate, drank, and smoked, and in the pale twilight the scene was\r\nlike some corner of a village market, full of noisy animation.\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, seated behind one of the tents, was growing more and\r\nmore excited, again and again saying to Jean: \'I cannot stand it any\r\nlonger. I shall bolt as soon as it is dark. To-morrow we shall be going\r\nfarther and farther away from the frontier, and it will then be too\r\nlate.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, we\'ll try it then,\' at last replied Jean, unable to resist\r\nthe young fellow\'s entreaties any longer, and giving way, on his own\r\nside, to this same haunting idea of escape. \'We shall soon see if we\r\nleave our skins behind us.\'\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, however, he began scanning all the vendors around\r\nhim. Some comrades had procured blouses and pants, and it was rumoured\r\nthat some charitable folks of Mouzon had got together large stocks of\r\nclothes in view of facilitating the escape of the captives. Jean\'s\r\nattention was almost immediately attracted by a pretty girl, a tall\r\nstag-eyed blonde of some sixteen summers, who had on her arm a basket,\r\nin which three loaves of bread were to be seen. She did not call out\r\nwhat she had for sale like the others did, but stepped along in a\r\nhesitating way, with a smile which, although engaging, was somewhat\r\ntinged with anxiety. Jean gazed steadily in her face, and at last\r\ntheir eyes met, and for a moment commingled. Then the pretty girl\r\ncame forward, still smiling in her embarrassed way: \'Do you want some\r\nbread?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nJean did not answer, but questioned her with a wink. And as she nodded\r\nher head in an affirmative way, he popped the question in a very low\r\nvoice: \'There are some clothes?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, under the loaves,\' she answered, thereupon making up her mind to\r\ncall out: \'Bread! bread! Who\'ll buy bread?\'\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice, however, wished to slip twenty francs into her hand,\r\nshe hastily withdrew it, and ran off, leaving them the basket. Still,\r\nbefore she disappeared, they saw her turn round and dart on them the\r\ntender, sympathetic laugh of her lovely eyes.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had the basket they were still as perplexed as ever. They\r\nhad strayed from their tent, and were so bewildered that they could\r\nnot find it again. Where should they stow themselves away? How could\r\nthey change their clothes? It seemed to them that everyone was prying\r\ninto that basket, which Jean was carrying in such an awkward manner,\r\nand could plainly detect what it contained. At last, however, they made\r\nup their minds, and entered the first empty tent they came upon, where\r\nin desperate haste each of them divested himself of his regimentals\r\nand slipped on a pair of trousers and a blouse. They placed their\r\nuniforms under the loaves in the basket and left the latter in the\r\ntent. However, they had only found one cap among the garments provided,\r\nand this Jean had compelled Maurice to put on. For his own part, he\r\nwas bareheaded, and, exaggerating the danger, he fancied himself lost.\r\nSo he was still lingering there, wondering how he could obtain any\r\nheadgear, when the idea suddenly came to him to buy the hat of a dirty\r\nold man whom he saw selling cigars. \'Three sous apiece, Brussels\r\ncigars, five sous a couple, Brussels cigars!\'\r\n\r\nThere had been no customs\' service on the frontier, since the battle of\r\nSedan, so that Belgian articles were flooding the country-side without\r\nlet or hindrance. The ragged old fellow had already realised a handsome\r\nprofit, but he nevertheless manifested exorbitant pretensions when he\r\nunderstood why Jean wished to buy his hat, a greasy bit of felt with a\r\nhole in the crown. A couple of five-franc pieces had to be handed him\r\nbefore he would part with it, and even then he whimpered that he should\r\ncertainly catch cold.\r\n\r\nAnother idea, however, had just occurred to Jean, that of purchasing\r\nthe remainder of the old fellow\'s stock in trade, the three dozen\r\ncigars or so which he was still hawking through the camp. And having\r\naccomplished this, the corporal in his turn began walking about, with\r\nthe old hat drawn over his eyes, whilst in a drawling voice he called:\r\n\'Three sous a couple, three sous a couple, Brussels cigars!\'\r\n\r\nThis meant salvation, and he signed to Maurice to walk on before him.\r\nThe young fellow, by great good fortune, had just picked up an umbrella\r\ndropped or forgotten by one of the hawkers, and as a few drops of rain\r\nwere falling, he quietly opened it so that it might screen him whilst\r\npassing the line of sentinels.\r\n\r\n\'Three sous a couple, three sous a couple, Brussels cigars!\' cried\r\nJean, who in a few minutes had rid himself of his stock. The other\r\nprisoners laughed and pressed around him; here at all events, said\r\nthey, was a reasonable dealer who didn\'t rob poor folks! Attracted too\r\nby the cheapness of the cigars some of the Prussians even approached,\r\nand Jean had to supply them. He man\xc5\x93uvred so as to pass the guarded\r\ncamp-line, and eventually sold his two last cigars to a big-bearded\r\nPrussian sergeant, who did not speak a word of French.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t walk so quick, dash it all!\' he repeated as he walked on behind\r\nMaurice; \'you\'ll get us caught if you do.\'\r\n\r\nTheir legs were almost running away with them, and only a great effort\r\ninduced them to pause for a moment on reaching a crossway, where some\r\nclusters of people were standing outside an inn. Some French gentlemen\r\nwere there, peaceably chatting with several German soldiers; and Jean\r\nand Maurice pretended to listen and even ventured to say a few words\r\nabout the rain, which it seemed likely would fall heavily during the\r\nnight. Meantime, a fat gentleman, who was among the persons present,\r\nlooked at them so persistently that they trembled. As he ended,\r\nhowever, by smiling in a good-natured way, they ventured to ask him in\r\nan undertone: \'Is the road to Belgium guarded, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but go through that wood and then bear to the left, across the\r\nfields.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they found themselves in the wood, amid the deep, dark silence\r\nof the motionless trees, when they could no longer hear a sound, when\r\nnothing more stirred and they believed that they were really saved, a\r\nfeeling of extraordinary emotion threw them into one another\'s arms.\r\nMaurice wept, sobbing violently, whilst tears slowly gathered in\r\nJean\'s eyes and trickled down his cheeks. Their nerves were relaxing\r\nafter their prolonged torments, they hopefully thought that perhaps\r\nsuffering would now take some compassion on them and torture them no\r\nlonger. And meantime they clasped each other closely in a distracted\r\nembrace, fraught with the fraternity born of all that they had suffered\r\ntogether; and the kiss that they exchanged seemed to them the most\r\nloving, the most ardent of their life, a kiss such as they would never\r\nreceive from a woman, the kiss of immortal friendship exchanged in the\r\nabsolute certainty that their two hearts no longer formed but one, for\r\never and ever more.\r\n\r\n\'Youngster,\' resumed Jean in a trembling voice, when they had ceased\r\nclasping one another, \'it\'s already a good deal to be here, but we are\r\nnot at the end of the job. We must take our bearings a little.\'\r\n\r\nAlthough he was not acquainted with this point of the frontier, Maurice\r\ndeclared that they need only go on before them; and thereupon gliding\r\nalong, one behind the other, they stealthily made their way to the\r\nverge of the plantations. Here they remembered the directions given\r\nthem by the obliging fat gentleman, and resolved to turn to the left\r\nand cut across the stubble. But they almost at once came upon a road\r\nedged with poplars, and perceived the watchfire of a Prussian picket\r\nbarring the way. A sentinel\'s bayonet glistened in the firelight; the\r\nother men were chatting and finishing their evening meal. At this sight\r\nJean and Maurice at once retraced their steps and again plunged into\r\nthe wood, with the fear of being pursued. They fancied indeed they\r\ncould hear voices and footsteps behind them, and continued beating\r\nabout the thickets during more than an hour, losing all idea of the\r\ndirections they took, turning round and round, at times breaking into\r\na gallop like hares scampering under the bushes, and at others stopping\r\nshort and perspiring with anguish in front of some motionless oak trees\r\nwhich they mistook for Prussians. And at last they once more debouched\r\ninto the road lined with poplars, at ten paces or so from the sentinel,\r\nand near the other men who were now quietly warming themselves around\r\nthe watchfire.\r\n\r\n\'No luck!\' growled Maurice, \'it\'s an enchanted wood.\'\r\n\r\nThis time, however, they had been heard. They had broken a few twigs in\r\npassing, and some stones were rolling away. And as, upon hearing the\r\nsentinel\'s \'_Wer da_?\' they immediately took to their heels without\r\nanswering, the picket rushed to arms and fired in their direction,\r\nriddling the thicket with bullets.\r\n\r\n\'Curse it!\' swore Jean in a hollow voice, restraining a cry of pain.\r\nThe calf of his left leg had received a stinging blow, not unlike the\r\ncut of a whip, but so violent that it had thrown him to the ground\r\nagainst a tree.\r\n\r\n\'Are you hit?\' asked Maurice anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, in the leg--it\'s done for.\'\r\n\r\nThey both listened again, panting, with the fear of hearing the tumult\r\nof pursuit at their heels. But no further shots were fired, and nothing\r\nmore stirred in the great quivering silence, which was falling around\r\nthem again. The Prussians evidently did not care to venture among the\r\ntrees. However, in trying to set himself erect Jean was hardly able to\r\nrestrain a groan. Maurice held him up, and asked:\r\n\r\n\'Can you walk?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid not.\' He, as a rule so calm, was now becoming enraged. He\r\nclenched his fists, and felt inclined to hit himself: \'Ah! good Lord!\r\nhow fearfully unlucky to get one\'s leg damaged when there\'s so much\r\nrunning to be done! I may just as well fling myself on a rubbish heap\r\nat once! Go on by yourself.\'\r\n\r\nMaurice, however, contented himself with answering gaily: \'How silly\r\nyou are!\'\r\n\r\nHe had taken his friend by the arm and was now helping him along, both\r\nof them being eager to get away. By an heroic effort they had managed\r\nto take a few steps, when they again halted, alarmed at seeing a house\r\nin front of them, a little farm, so it seemed, on the verge of the\r\nwood. There was no light in any of the windows, the yard-gate was\r\nwide open, and the building looked black and empty. And when they had\r\nmustered sufficient courage to enter the yard, they were astonished\r\nto find a horse standing near the house, saddled and bridled, but with\r\nnothing to show why or how it had come there. Perhaps its master would\r\nsoon return; perhaps he was lying behind some bush with his head split.\r\nBut whatever the truth was, they never learned it.\r\n\r\nA new plan, however, had suddenly dawned on Maurice\'s mind and quite\r\ninspirited him. \'Listen,\' said he, \'the frontier is too far away;\r\nand besides, we should really require a guide to reach it. But if we\r\nwent to Remilly now, to uncle Fouchard\'s, I\'m sure that I could take\r\nyou there with my eyes shut, for I know all the lanes and by-ways. Is\r\nit agreed, eh? I\'ll hoist you on to this horse, and we\'ll get uncle\r\nFouchard to take us in.\'\r\n\r\nBefore starting, however, he wished to examine Jean\'s leg. There\r\nwere two holes in it, so that the bullet must have passed out again,\r\nprobably after fracturing the tibia. Fortunately, the h\xc3\xa6morrhage was\r\nbut slight, and Maurice contented himself with binding his handkerchief\r\ntightly round the calf of the leg.\r\n\r\n\'Go on by yourself!\' repeated Jean.\r\n\r\n\'Be quiet, you silly!\'\r\n\r\nWhen Jean was firmly perched on the saddle Maurice took hold of the\r\nhorse\'s bridle and they started off. It must now have been about eleven\r\no\'clock, and he hoped to accomplish the journey in three hours, even\r\nshould he have to walk the horse the entire distance. But all at once\r\nhe relapsed into despair at thought of a difficulty which had not\r\npreviously occurred to him. How would they be able to cross over to the\r\nleft bank of the Meuse? The bridge at Mouzon must certainly be guarded.\r\nAt last he remembered that there was a ferry lower down at Villers, and\r\ndeciding to chance it, in the hope that they would at last meet with a\r\nlittle luck, he directed his course towards that village through the\r\nmeadows and ploughed fields on the right bank. All went fairly well at\r\nfirst; they merely had to avoid a cavalry patrol, which they escaped\r\nby remaining motionless for a quarter of an hour or so, in the shadow\r\nthrown by a wall. The only worry was that, the rain having begun to\r\nfall again, walking became very difficult for Maurice, who had to\r\ntrudge through the heavy soil of the drenched fields, beside the horse,\r\nwhich was fortunately a good-natured, docile animal. At Villers luck\r\ndid at first declare itself in their favour, for, although the hour was\r\nlate, the ferryman had but a few minutes before brought a Bavarian\r\nofficer across the river, and was able to take them aboard at once,\r\nand land them on the opposite bank without difficulty. It was only at\r\nthe village of Villers that their terrible troubles began, for they\r\nhere narrowly missed falling into the clutches of the sentries who were\r\nposted at intervals right along the road to Remilly. They, therefore,\r\nagain had to take to the fields and trust to the chances of the little\r\nlanes and narrow pathways, which often were scarcely practicable.\r\nOccasionally some trivial obstacle would compel them to take a most\r\ncircuitous course; still they contrived to make their way over ditches\r\nand through hedges, and at times even forced a passage through some\r\nthick plantation.\r\n\r\nSeized with fever amid the drizzling rain, Jean had sunk across the\r\nsaddle in a semi-conscious state, clinging with both hands to the\r\nhorse\'s mane, whilst Maurice, who had slipped the reins round his right\r\narm, had to support his friend\'s legs in order to prevent him from\r\nfalling. Over more than a league of country, during nearly a couple\r\nof hours, was this exhausting march kept up, amid incessant jolting\r\nand slipping, both the horse and the men losing their balance again\r\nand again, and almost toppling over together. They became a picture\r\nof abject wretchedness; all three of them were covered with mud, the\r\nanimal\'s legs trembled, the man he carried lay upon him inert, like\r\na corpse that had just given up the ghost, whilst if the other man,\r\ndistracted and haggard, still managed to trudge along, it was solely\r\nthrough an effort of his fraternal love. The dawn was breaking; it was\r\nabout five o\'clock when they at last arrived at Remilly.\r\n\r\nIn the yard of his little farmhouse overlooking the village, near the\r\noutlet of the defile of Haraucourt, old Fouchard was already loading\r\nhis cart with two sheep which he had slaughtered the previous day. The\r\nsight of his nephew in so sorry a plight upset him to such a point\r\nthat after the first words of explanation he brutally exclaimed: \'Let\r\nyou stay here, you and your friend? To have a lot of worry with the\r\nPrussians; no, no, indeed! I\'d rather kick the bucket at once.\'\r\n\r\nAll the same, he did not dare to prevent Prosper and Maurice from\r\ntaking Jean off the horse and laying him on the large table in the\r\nliving-room. The wounded man was still unconscious, and Silvine went to\r\nfetch her own bolster and slipped it under his head. Meanwhile uncle\r\nFouchard continued growling, exasperated at seeing this fellow on his\r\ntable, which, said he, was by no means the proper place for him. And\r\nhe asked them why they did not at once take him to the ambulance, since\r\nthey were lucky enough to have an ambulance at Remilly, in the disused\r\nschool-house, which had once formed part of an old convent. It stood\r\nnear the church and contained a large and commodious gallery.\r\n\r\n\'Take him to the ambulance!\' protested Maurice, in his turn, \'for the\r\nPrussians to send him to Germany as soon as he\'s cured, since all the\r\nwounded belong to them! Are you joking with me, uncle? I certainly\r\ndidn\'t bring him here to give him back to them.\'\r\n\r\nThings were getting unpleasant, and Fouchard talked of turning them out\r\nof the house, when all at once Henriette\'s name was mentioned.\r\n\r\n\'Eh, what--what about Henriette?\' asked the young man.\r\n\r\nHe ended by learning that his sister had been at Remilly since a couple\r\nof days, having become so terribly depressed by her bereavement that\r\nshe now found life at Sedan, where she had lived so happily with her\r\nhusband, quite unbearable. A chance meeting with Dr. Dalichamp of\r\nRaucourt, whom she knew, had induced her to come and stay in a little\r\nroom at Fouchard\'s, with a view of giving all her time to the wounded\r\nat the neighbouring ambulance. This occupation, she said, would divert\r\nher thoughts. She paid for her board, and was the source of many little\r\ncomforts at the farm, so that the old man looked on her with a kindly\r\neye. Everything was first-rate when he was making money.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, so my sister\'s here!\' repeated Maurice. \'So that\'s what Monsieur\r\nDelaherche meant by that wave of the arm which I couldn\'t understand.\r\nWell, as she\'s here, it will all be easy. We shall stay.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon, despite his fatigue, he himself resolved to go and fetch\r\nher from the ambulance where she had spent the night, and his uncle\r\nmeantime grew the more angry because he could not take himself off\r\nwith his cart and his two sheep, to ply his calling as an itinerant\r\nbutcher through the surrounding villages, until this annoying affair\r\nwas settled.\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice came back with Henriette, they surprised old Fouchard\r\ncarefully examining the horse which had carried Jean to the farm and\r\nwhich Prosper had just led into the stable. The animal was no doubt\r\ntired out, but it was a sturdy beast, and Fouchard liked the look of\r\nit. Thereupon, Maurice told him with a laugh that he might keep it\r\nif it pleased him, whilst Henriette drew him aside and explained that\r\nJean would pay for his lodging, and that she herself would take charge\r\nof him and nurse him in the little room behind the cowhouse, where\r\ncertainly no Prussian would go to look for him. The old man remained\r\nsullen, hardly believing as yet that he would derive any real profit\r\nfrom the business; still, he ended by climbing into his cart and\r\ndriving off, leaving Henriette free to do as she pleased.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Silvine and Prosper, Henriette then got the room\r\nready, and had Jean carried to it and laid in a clean, comfortable bed.\r\nOpening his eyes, the corporal looked round him, but seemed to see\r\nnobody, and merely stammered a few incoherent words. Maurice was now\r\nquite overwhelmed by the reaction following on his exhausting march;\r\nhowever, whilst he was finishing a bit of meat and drinking a glass of\r\nwine, Dr. Dalichamp came in, as was his custom every morning, prior to\r\nvisiting the ambulance; and, thereupon, the young fellow, anxious to\r\nknow what injury Jean had received, found strength enough to follow the\r\ndoctor and his sister to the bedside.\r\n\r\nM. Dalichamp was a short man with a big round head. His hair and\r\nfringe of beard were getting grey; his ruddy face, like the faces of\r\nthe peasants, with whom he mixed, had become hardened by his constant\r\nlife in the open air, for he was always on the road to alleviate\r\nsome suffering or other. His keen eyes, obstinate nose, and kindly\r\nmouth told what his life had been--the life of a thoroughly worthy,\r\ncharitable man, inclined, at times, to be rather headstrong. He was\r\nnot, as a doctor, endowed with genius, but long practice had made him a\r\nfirst-rate healer.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m much afraid that amputation will be necessary,\' he muttered, when\r\nhe had examined Jean, who was still dozing; whereupon Maurice and\r\nHenriette were greatly grieved. However, the doctor added, \'Perhaps we\r\nmay manage to save that leg, but in that case he will need very careful\r\nnursing, and it will be a long job. At present he is in such a state\r\nof physical and moral prostration that the only thing is to let him\r\nsleep. We\'ll see how he is to-morrow.\' Then, having dressed the wound,\r\nhe interested himself in Maurice, whom he had formerly known as a lad.\r\n\'And you, my brave fellow, you would be better in bed than on that\r\nchair,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThe young man was gazing fixedly in front of him, with his eyes afar,\r\nas though he did not hear. Fever was mounting to his brain in the\r\nintoxication of his fatigue, an extraordinary nervous excitement, the\r\noutcome of all the sufferings, all the disgusting experiences he had\r\npassed through since the outset of the campaign. The sight of his\r\nagonising friend, the consciousness of his own defeat, the idea that he\r\nwas unarmed, good for nothing, having nothing left him but his skin,\r\nthe thought that so many heroic efforts had merely resulted in such\r\nmisery--all filled him with a frantic longing to rebel against Destiny.\r\nAt last he spoke: \'No, no! it is not finished yet! No, indeed! I must\r\ngo away. Since he must lie there now for weeks and perhaps for months,\r\nI cannot stay. I must go away at once. You will help me, doctor, won\'t\r\nyou? You\'ll find me some means of escaping and getting back to Paris?\'\r\n\r\nHenriette, who was trembling, caught him in her arms. \'What is that you\r\nsay? Weak as you are, after suffering so dreadfully? But I mean to keep\r\nyou--I will not let you go! Haven\'t you paid your debt to France? Think\r\nof me a little--think that I should be all alone, and that now I have\r\nonly you left me!\'\r\n\r\nTheir tears mingled. They embraced distractedly, with that tender\r\nadoring affection which unites twins more closely than others, as\r\nthough it originated prior even to birth. Far from becoming calmer,\r\nhowever, Maurice grew still more excited. \'I assure you that I _must_\r\ngo!\' he stammered. \'They are waiting for me. I should die of anguish if\r\nI did not go! You cannot imagine how my brain boils at the thought of\r\nremaining here in peace and quietness. I tell you that it cannot end\r\nlike this--that we must avenge ourselves--on whom or what I know not,\r\nbut, at any rate, obtain vengeance for so many misfortunes, so that we\r\nmay yet have the courage to live!\'\r\n\r\nDr. Dalichamp, who had been watching the scene with keen interest, made\r\nHenriette a sign not to answer. Maurice would no doubt be calmer when\r\nhe had slept; and he slept indeed all through that day and through\r\nthe following night--in all more than twenty hours--without moving a\r\nfinger. However, when he awoke the next morning, his resolution to\r\ngo away came back, unshakeable. His fever had subsided, but he was\r\ngloomy, restless, eager to escape from all the tempting inducements to\r\na quiet life that he divined around him. His tearful sister realised\r\nthat it would be useless to insist. And Dr. Dalichamp, when he came\r\nthat day, promised to facilitate his flight by means of the papers of\r\nan ambulance assistant, who had recently died at Raucourt: Maurice was\r\nto don the grey blouse with the red-cross badge, and go off through\r\nBelgium to make his way back to Paris, which was still open.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave the farm all that day, but hid himself there, waiting\r\nfor the night. He scarcely opened his mouth, and then only to ascertain\r\nif he could induce Prosper to go away with him. \'Aren\'t you tempted to\r\ngo and see the Prussians again?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Chasseur d\'Afrique, who was finishing some bread and cheese, set\r\nhis fist on the table with his knife upraised.\r\n\r\n\'Well, for what we saw of them it\'s hardly worth while,\' he answered.\r\n\'Since cavalrymen are nowadays good for nothing except to get\r\nthemselves killed when it\'s all over, why should I go back? \'Pon my\r\nword, no, they disgusted me too much in not giving me any decent work.\'\r\nThere was a pause, and then he resumed, doubtless in order to silence\r\nthe voice of his soldier\'s heart: \'Besides, there\'s too much work to\r\nbe done here, now. The ploughing is just coming on, later on there\'ll\r\nbe the sowing. We must think of the soil, too, eh? It\'s all very well\r\nto fight, but what would become of us if we didn\'t plough? You will\r\nunderstand very well that I can\'t turn the work up. Not that old\r\nFouchard\'s a good master, for I don\'t expect I shall ever see any of\r\nhis brass, but the horses are beginning to know and like me, and this\r\nmorning, \'pon my word, whilst I was up yonder in the old enclosure, I\r\nlooked down on that cursed Sedan, and felt quite comforted at finding\r\nmyself with my horses, driving my plough all alone, in the sunshine.\'\r\n\r\nDr. Dalichamp arrived in his gig at nightfall. He wished to drive\r\nMaurice to the frontier himself. Old Fouchard, delighted to find that,\r\nat any rate, one of the men was taking himself off, went to watch on\r\nthe road, so as to make sure that no patrol was lurking there; whilst\r\nSilvine repaired some rents in the old ambulance blouse with the\r\nred-cross badge. Before starting, the doctor again examined Jean\'s\r\nleg, and as yet he could not promise to save it. The wounded man was\r\nstill in a somnolent state, recognising nobody, and not saying a word.\r\nAnd thus it seemed as though Maurice must go off without exchanging a\r\nfarewell with his comrade. On leaning forward to embrace him, however,\r\nhe suddenly saw him open his eyes, and move his lips. \'You are going?\'\r\nasked Jean in a weak voice, adding, as the others expressed their\r\nastonishment: \'Oh! I heard you very well, though I couldn\'t stir. But\r\nsince you are going, old man, take all the money with you. It\'s in my\r\ntrousers\' pocket.\'\r\n\r\nEach of them now had about a couple of hundred francs left of the\r\ntreasury money, which they had shared together. \'The money!\' exclaimed\r\nMaurice; \'but you need it more than I do. My legs are all right! With\r\na couple of hundred francs I\'ve ample to take me to Paris and get my\r\nskull cracked, which, by the way, won\'t cost me anything. Well, all the\r\nsame, till we meet again, old man, and thanks for all your kindness and\r\ngood counsel, for, if it hadn\'t been for you, I should certainly be\r\nlying at the edge of some field like a dead dog.\'\r\n\r\nJean silenced him with a gesture. \'You don\'t owe me anything--we are\r\nquits,\' said he; \'the Prussians would have picked _me_ up over there,\r\nif you hadn\'t carried me away on your back. And again, the other day,\r\ntoo, you saved me from their clutches. That\'s twice you\'ve paid me, and\r\nit\'s rather my turn to risk my life for _you_. Ah! I shall be anxious\r\nnow at not having you with me any longer.\' His voice was trembling, and\r\ntears started from his eyes: \'Kiss me, youngster.\'\r\n\r\nAnd they kissed; and, as it had been in the wood on the night of their\r\nescape, their embrace was instinct with the fraternity born of the\r\ndangers that they had incurred together, during those few weeks of\r\nheroic life in common, which had united them far more closely than\r\nyears of ordinary friendship could have done. The days of starvation,\r\nthe sleepless nights, the excessive fatigues, the constant peril of\r\ndeath--with all of these was their emotion fraught. Can two hearts\r\never take themselves back when by a mutual gift they have thus been\r\nblended together? Nevertheless, the kiss which they had exchanged\r\namid the darkness of the trees had partaken of the new hope that\r\nflight had opened to them; whereas this kiss, now, quivered with the\r\nanguish of parting. Would they meet again, some day? And how--in what\r\ncircumstances of grief or joy?\r\n\r\nDr. Dalichamp, who had climbed into his gig again, was already calling\r\nMaurice. Then, with all his soul, the young fellow at last embraced\r\nhis sister, Henriette, who, extremely pale in the black garments of\r\nher widowhood, was looking at him and silently weeping. \'I confide my\r\nbrother to you,\' said he; \'take good care of him, and love him, as I\r\nlove him myself!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDARK DAYS--BAZAINE THE TRAITOR--THE TIDE OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nJean\'s room, a large chamber with a tiled floor and lime-washed walls,\r\nhad formerly been used as a fruitery. You could still detect there the\r\npleasant scent of apples and pears, and the only furniture was an iron\r\nbedstead, a deal table and two chairs, together with an old walnut\r\nwardrobe, wonderfully deep and containing a multitude of things. The\r\nquietness was profoundly soothing; only a few faint sounds from the\r\nadjacent cowhouse could be heard, the occasional lowing of cattle and\r\nthe muffled stamping of their hoofs. The bright sunshine came in by the\r\nwindow, which faced the south. Merely a strip of slope could be seen,\r\na cornfield skirted by a little wood. And this mysterious closed room\r\nwas so hidden away from every eye that no stranger could even have\r\nsuspected its existence.\r\n\r\nHenriette immediately settled how things were to be managed. In view\r\nof avoiding suspicions it was arranged that only she and the doctor\r\nshould have access to Jean. Silvine was never to enter the room unless\r\nshe were called--for instance, at an early hour in the morning when the\r\ntwo women tidied the place; after which the door remained as though\r\nwalled up, throughout the day. If the wounded man should need anyone\r\nat night-time, he would merely have to knock on the wall, for the room\r\noccupied by Henriette was adjacent. And thus it came to pass that\r\nafter many weeks of life amid a violent multitude, Jean suddenly found\r\nhimself separated from the world, seeing no one but the doctor and that\r\ngentle young woman whose light footsteps were inaudible. And whilst she\r\nministered to his wants with an air of infinite goodness, he again saw\r\nher as he had espied her on the first occasion, at Sedan, looking like\r\nan apparition, with small and delicate features save that her mouth was\r\nsomewhat large, and with hair the hue of ripened grain.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier days the wounded man\'s fever was so intense that\r\nHenriette scarcely left him. Dr. Dalichamp dropped in every morning,\r\nunder pretence of fetching her to go to the ambulance with him; and\r\nhe would then examine Jean\'s leg and dress it. After fracturing the\r\ntibia, the bullet had passed out again, and the doctor was astonished\r\nat the bad appearance of the wound, and was afraid there might be some\r\nsplinter there--though in probing he was unable to detect any--which\r\nwould necessitate an excision of the bone. He had spoken on the subject\r\nto Jean, but the latter revolted at the thought of having his leg\r\nshortened and going lame all the rest of his life: no, no, indeed, he\r\nwould rather die at once than become a cripple. The doctor therefore\r\nsimply kept the wound under observation, dressing it with lint\r\nsoaked in olive oil and phenic acid, after inserting a gutta-percha\r\ndrainage-tube, so that the pus might flow away. At the same time,\r\nhowever, he warned Jean that if he did not perform an operation the\r\ncure would probably take a very long time. Yet it happened that the\r\nfever abated during the second week, when the state of the wound also\r\nbecame more favourable--at least so long as the patient remained quite\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nHenriette\'s intercourse with Jean was then regulated in a systematic\r\nway. Habits came to them both; it seemed to them as though they had\r\nnever lived otherwise, as though they would go on living like that\r\nfor ever. She gave him all the time that she did not devote to the\r\nambulance, saw that he ate and drank at regular hours, and helped\r\nhim to turn over with a strength of wrist that would never have been\r\nsuspected in a woman with such slender arms. At times they chatted,\r\nbut during the earlier period they more often remained together\r\nwithout speaking. Yet they never seemed to be bored. It was a very\r\ncalm, reposeful life for both of them--for him crippled by the battle,\r\nand for her in her widow\'s gown, and with her heart crushed by her\r\nbereavement. He had felt somewhat intimidated at first, for he was\r\nfully conscious that she was his superior, almost a lady, whereas he\r\nhad never been anything but a mere peasant and soldier. He could barely\r\nread and write. However, he had felt more at his ease on finding that\r\nshe treated him like an equal, without any display of pride. And this\r\nemboldened him to show himself as he really was, intelligent after\r\na fashion, thanks to his sober common-sense. To his astonishment,\r\nmoreover, he would often feel less coarse and heavy than formerly,\r\nfull of new ideas that he had never dreamt of before. Was this the\r\noutcome of the abominable life that he had been leading for two months\r\npast? It was as though he were emerging refined from all his physical\r\nand moral sufferings. He regained, however, a still greater measure\r\nof self-possession on realising that she did not know much more than\r\nhe did. Her mother\'s death had turned her when very young into a\r\nlittle housewife, with three men, as she put it, to take care of--her\r\ngrandfather, her father, and her brother--so that she had not had\r\nmuch time for schooling. Reading, writing, a rudimentary knowledge of\r\nspelling and cyphering--beyond that she did not go. And, therefore, if\r\nshe still somewhat intimidated Jean, if she still appeared to him to\r\nbe above all others of her sex, it was simply because he knew her to\r\nbe superlatively good, endowed with extraordinary courage, albeit she\r\nappeared to be merely a retiring little woman taking her pleasure in\r\nthe petty duties of life.\r\n\r\nThey agreed together at once, whilst chatting about Maurice. If she\r\nthus devoted herself to Jean it was indeed because she looked upon him\r\nas Maurice\'s brother and friend, as the worthy protector who had helped\r\nand succoured him, and to whom she in her turn was paying a debt of\r\ngratitude. She was indeed full of gratitude, of affection which grew\r\nand grew as she learnt to know him better, simple and sensible as he\r\nwas, with a sound, sober head; and he, whom she nursed as though he\r\nwere a child, was on his side contracting a debt of infinite gratitude\r\ntowards her and would have kissed her hands for each cup of broth that\r\nshe brought to him. The bond of affectionate sympathy uniting them grew\r\ncloser every day in the profound solitude in which they lived, with\r\nthe same anxieties to trouble them. When they had exhausted Jean\'s\r\nreminiscences, the particulars which she was never weary of asking for\r\nrespecting that woeful march from Rheims to Sedan, the same question\r\ninvariably came back again: What was Maurice doing? Why did he not\r\nwrite? Was Paris completely invested, since no more news had reached\r\nthem? They had so far received but one letter from the young fellow,\r\nwritten from Rouen three days after he had left them, and in this he\r\nhad explained how, after a most circuitous journey, he had just reached\r\nthat town, in view of making his way to Paris. And there had been\r\nnothing further for an entire week--he was now altogether silent.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Dalichamp had dressed Jean\'s leg in the morning he liked to\r\nlinger there for a few minutes. And he even dropped in occasionally\r\nof an evening, when he would stay for a longer time. He was their only\r\nlink with the world, that vast outside world, now all topsy-turvy with\r\ncatastrophes. The only news they obtained came through him. He had an\r\nardent, patriotic heart, which overflowed with anger and grief at the\r\nnews of each defeat; and he spoke of little else but the invading march\r\nof the Prussians, who since the battle of Sedan had been gradually\r\nspreading over France like the waves of some black, rising sea. Each\r\nday brought its grief, and the doctor, quite overwhelmed, would often\r\nlinger on one of the two chairs beside the bed, relating with trembling\r\ngestures how the situation was becoming more and more serious. He\r\noften had his pockets full of Belgian newspapers, which he left behind\r\nhim. And thus after the lapse of weeks the echoes of each successive\r\ndisaster penetrated to that lonely room, drawing the two poor suffering\r\ncreatures shut up there yet closer together, in the bonds of a common\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in this wise that Henriette read to Jean, from sundry old\r\nnewspapers, an account of the events which had taken place around\r\nMetz--the great, heroic battles, which at an interval of one day on\r\neach occasion had been thrice renewed. These battles were already\r\nfive weeks old, but Jean was still ignorant of them, and listened\r\nto the accounts in the newspapers with his heart oppressed at\r\nfinding that the same misery and defeat, that had caused him so much\r\nsuffering, had befallen his comrades over yonder. Whilst Henriette\r\nclearly articulated each sentence in the somewhat singsong voice of\r\nan attentive school-girl, the melancholy story slowly unfolded itself\r\namid the quivering silence of the room. After Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, after\r\nSpichern, at the moment when the vanquished First Corps was carrying\r\noff the Fifth in its rout, such consternation prevailed that the other\r\ncorps, \xc3\xa9cheloned from Metz to Bitche, wavered and fell back, eventually\r\nconcentrating in advance of the intrenched camp of Metz, on the right\r\nbank of the Moselle. But how much precious time had been lost in\r\naccomplishing this junction of forces when the retreat on Paris, now\r\nbound to prove a difficult operation, ought to have been hastened with\r\nall despatch! The Emperor had been obliged to surrender the supreme\r\ncommand to Marshal Bazaine, to whom every one looked for victory, and\r\nthen on August 14 came the battle of Borny,[40] when the army was\r\nattacked just as it was at last making up its mind to cross over to\r\nthe left bank of the stream. It had two German armies against it--that\r\nof Steinmetz, motionless in front of the intrenched camp which it was\r\nthreatening, and that of Frederick Charles, which, after crossing the\r\nriver higher up, was approaching along the left bank to cut Bazaine\r\noff from the rest of France. The first shots were only fired at three\r\nin the afternoon and the victory proved a barren one, for although the\r\nFrench corps remained in possession of their positions, they found\r\nthemselves immobilised on the two banks of the Moselle, whilst the\r\nturning movement of the second German army was completed. Then on the\r\n16th came R\xc3\xa9zonville: all the corps at last landed on the left bank\r\nof the river, the third and fourth alone lagging behind, belated by\r\nthe frightful block at the intersection of the roads of Etain and\r\nMars-la-Tour which had been intercepted early in the morning by an\r\naudacious attack of the Prussian cavalry and artillery. A slowly\r\nfought, confused battle was this engagement of R\xc3\xa9zonville, which up to\r\ntwo o\'clock in the afternoon Bazaine might yet have won, since he had\r\nbut a handful of men to overthrow, but which he ended by losing through\r\nhis inexplicable dread of being cut off from Metz. And it was also a\r\nbattle of immense extent, spread over leagues of hills and plains,\r\nwhere the French, attacked in front and in flank, performed prodigies\r\nof valour to avoid marching forward, giving the enemy the requisite\r\ntime to concentrate, and themselves helping on the Prussian plan, which\r\nwas to force them back upon the other bank of the river. At last, on\r\nthe 18th, after the French had returned to positions in advance of the\r\nintrenched camp, there came St. Priv\xc3\xa2t, the supreme struggle, a line of\r\nattack over eight miles long, two hundred thousand Germans, with seven\r\nhundred guns against one hundred and twenty thousand Frenchmen with\r\nonly five hundred guns, the Germans facing Germany, the French facing\r\nFrance, as though the invaders had become the invaded, in the singular\r\ndisplacement of forces that had taken place. And after two o\'clock the\r\nfight became a most terrible _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_, the Prussian Guard repulsed,\r\ncut to pieces, Bazaine long victorious, strong in the unshakeable\r\nfirmness of his left wing, until towards evening his weaker right wing\r\nwas obliged to abandon St. Priv\xc3\xa2t, amidst horrible carnage, carrying\r\naway with it the entire army, beaten, thrown back under Metz, enclosed\r\nhenceforth in a circle of iron.\r\n\r\nAt each moment, whilst Henriette was reading, Jean interrupted her to\r\nsay: \'And to think we others had been expecting Bazaine ever since\r\nleaving Rheims!\'\r\n\r\nThe marshal\'s despatch of the 19th, the morrow of the battle of St.\r\nPriv\xc3\xa2t, in which he spoke of resuming his movement of retreat by way\r\nof Montm\xc3\xa9dy--that despatch which had determined the forward march of\r\nthe army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons--appeared to be simply the commonplace report of\r\na beaten general, desirous of attenuating his defeat. Later on, but\r\nonly on the 29th, when the news of the approach of an army of succour\r\nhad reached him through the Prussian lines, he certainly did attempt a\r\nlast effort, at Noiseville, on the right bank of the Moselle, but so\r\nfeebly that on September 1, the very day when the army of Ch\xc3\xa2lons was\r\ncrushed at Sedan, that of Metz fell back, definitely paralysed, dead\r\nso to say for France. And the marshal, who, so far, had proved himself\r\nmerely an indifferent captain, neglecting to march on when the roads\r\nwere open, but afterwards really hemmed in by superior forces, was now,\r\nunder the sway of political preoccupations, on the point of becoming a\r\nconspirator and a traitor.\r\n\r\nIn the newspapers, however, that Dr. Dalichamp brought with him,\r\nBazaine still figured as the great man, the brave soldier from whom\r\nFrance yet awaited salvation. Jean asked Henriette to read him certain\r\npassages over again, so that he might clearly understand how it was\r\nthat the third German army, commanded by the Crown Prince of Prussia,\r\nhad been able to pursue them, whilst the first and the second were\r\nblockading Metz, both of them so strong in men and guns that it had\r\nbeen possible to draw and detach from them that fourth army,[41] which,\r\nunder the orders of the Crown Prince of Saxony, had given the finishing\r\nstroke to the disaster of Sedan. Then, having at last grasped these\r\nfacts, on the bed of pain to which his wound confined him, he forced\r\nhimself despite everything to be hopeful: \'So that\'s why we weren\'t\r\nthe stronger,\' said he. \'But no matter, there are figures given there:\r\nBazaine has a hundred thousand men, three hundred thousand rifles,\r\nand more than five hundred guns; of course he means to deal them some\r\ncrushing blow of his invention.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette nodded, falling in with his opinion so as not to sadden him.\r\nShe could not follow all these complicated movements of troops, but\r\nshe felt that misfortune was inevitable. As a rule her voice remained\r\nquite clear; she could have gone on reading for hours, simply happy at\r\nthe thought that she was interesting him. But at times, whilst perusing\r\nsome narrative of slaughter, she all at once began to stammer and her\r\neyes filled with a sudden flow of tears. Doubtless she had just thought\r\nof her husband shot down over yonder, and kicked against the wall by\r\nthe Bavarian officer.\r\n\r\n\'If it grieves you too much, you mustn\'t read any more battles to me,\'\r\nsaid Jean in surprise.\r\n\r\nBut, gentle and complaisant, she at once recovered her self-possession:\r\n\'No, no; excuse me, I assure you that it interests me too.\'\r\n\r\nOne evening, during the early days of October, whilst a violent wind\r\nwas blowing out of doors, she came back from the ambulance and entered\r\nthe room in a state of great emotion: \'Here\'s a letter from Maurice!\'\r\nshe exclaimed. \'The doctor received it to-day and has just given it to\r\nme!\'\r\n\r\nThey both had been growing more and more anxious each morning on\r\nfinding that the young man still gave no sign of life; and now that for\r\na whole week rumours had been circulating that Paris was completely\r\ninvested they were quite in despair at receiving no tidings, wondering\r\nin their anxiety what could have become of him after his departure from\r\nRouen. His silence was now explained to them, however; the letter which\r\nHenriette brought home with her, written to Dr. Dalichamp from Paris,\r\non September 18, the very day when the last trains left for Havre, had\r\nmade a tremendous round, only reaching its destination by a miracle,\r\nafter going astray a score of times.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the dear fellow!\' exclaimed Jean in delight. \'Make haste and read\r\nit to me.\'\r\n\r\nThe wind was increasing in violence, and the window was rattling as\r\nthough it were being battered with a ram. Henriette placed the lamp on\r\nthe table near the bed, and, seated so close to Jean that her wavy hair\r\nbrushed against his, she began to read Maurice\'s letter. It was very\r\nsnug and pleasant in that quiet room whilst the tempest was raging out\r\nof doors.\r\n\r\nIn the letter, which was a long one, covering eight pages, Maurice\r\nbegan by explaining that immediately on his arrival in Paris, on\r\nSeptember 16, he had been fortunate enough to get enrolled in a Line\r\nregiment. Then he reverted to the past, and in extremely feverish\r\nlanguage detailed all that he had learnt of the events of that terrible\r\nmonth: Paris growing calmer after the woeful stupor of Weissenburg and\r\nFr\xc5\x93schweiler, then swiftly indulging in the hope of revenge, falling\r\ninto fresh illusions, believing in Bazaine as a commander, in the\r\n_lev\xc3\xa9e en masse_, the imaginary victories, the wholesale slaughtering\r\nof Prussian troops which even ministers themselves announced in the\r\nChamber of Deputies. And, all at once, he explained how, on September\r\n3, the thunderbolt of Sedan had fallen upon Paris: every hope\r\nshattered, the ignorant, confiding city overwhelmed by the crushing\r\nblow of destiny; the shouts of \'Dethronement! Dethronement!\' bursting\r\nforth on the Boulevards that same evening; the short, lugubrious night\r\nsitting of the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif at which Jules Favre had read out\r\nhis proposal for the deposition which the people demanded; then, on\r\nthe morrow, September 4, the Downfall of a world, the Second Empire\r\ncarried away amid the smash-up of its vices and its faults; the\r\nentire population in the streets, a torrent of half a million of men\r\nfilling the Place de la Concorde, in the broad sunshine, and flowing\r\nat last across the bridge to the gates of the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif, which\r\nwere protected merely by a handful of soldiers who raised the butts\r\nof their guns in the air. Then the crowd bursting the doors open\r\nand invading the Chamber, whence Jules Favre, Gambetta, and other\r\ndeputies of the Left soon started to proclaim the Republic at the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville, whilst a little door of the Louvre, facing the Place\r\nSaint-Germain-l\'Auxerrois, was being set ajar to give egress to the\r\nEmpress-Regent, who came forth clad in black, accompanied by a single\r\nfemale friend, both of them trembling, fleeing, cowering in a cab which\r\njolted them away, afar from those Tuileries through which the crowd was\r\nnow streaming. And on that same day Napoleon III. had quitted the inn\r\nat Bouillon, where he had spent his first night of exile, on the way to\r\nWilhelmshohe.\r\n\r\nWith a thoughtful expression on his face Jean interrupted Henriette:\r\n\'So we now have a Republic, then. So much the better if it helps us to\r\nlick the Prussians.\' However, he shook his head doubtfully, for during\r\nhis peasant life he had always been told bad things of the Republic.\r\nBesides, it seemed to him that they all ought to agree together, and\r\nunite in presence of the enemy. Yet it was certainly necessary that\r\nthere should be a new government of some kind, since the Empire was\r\nshown to be rotten, and nobody would tolerate it any longer.\r\n\r\nThen Henriette read the end of the letter, which mentioned the approach\r\nof the German armies. On September 13, the day when a delegation of\r\nthe Government of National Defence had established its quarters at\r\nTours, they had advanced as near as Lagny, on the east of Paris. On\r\nthe 14th and 15th they were almost at the city gates, at Cr\xc3\xa9teil and\r\nJoinville-le-Pont. Yet on the 18th, on the morning when he had written,\r\nMaurice still refused to believe in the possibility of completely\r\ninvesting Paris, swayed as he once more was by superb confidence,\r\nregarding the projected siege as an insolent, hazardous attempt, which\r\nwould break down before three weeks were over; relying, too, on the\r\narmies of succour which the provinces would undoubtedly send, without\r\nmentioning the army of Metz, which he imagined to be already on the\r\nmarch by way of Verdun and Rheims. Nevertheless, the links of the iron\r\nchain had met, and encompassed Paris; and now, separated from the whole\r\nworld, the city had become but the great prison of two millions of\r\nliving beings, whence came no sound, nothing but a death-like silence.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my God!\' murmured Henriette with anguish at her heart. \'How long\r\nwill it all last, and shall we ever see him again?\'\r\n\r\nA squall was bending the trees afar off, and drawing groan after groan\r\nfrom the old timbers of the farmhouse. If the winter should prove a\r\nsevere one, how the poor soldiers would suffer, starving and tireless,\r\nand fighting in the snow!\r\n\r\n\'All the same,\' concluded Jean, \'it\'s a very nice letter, and it\'s\r\npleasant to have heard from him! One must never despair.\'\r\n\r\nThen, day by day, the month of October went by, with the sky ever grey\r\nand mournful, and the wind merely abating, to come back before long\r\nwith darker and darker flights of clouds. Jean\'s wound was cicatrising\r\nvery, very slowly; the drainage-tube did not yet discharge the healthy\r\npus which would have enabled the doctor to remove it, and the wounded\r\nman had become greatly enfeebled, but still obstinately refused to\r\nundergo any operation, for fear lest he should remain a cripple.\r\nAnd the long hours of resigned waiting which sudden fits of anxiety\r\noccasionally disturbed now seemed to lull that little room to sleep;\r\nthat little, lonely room which the news of the world reached but at\r\nlong intervals and even then distantly, vaguely, like the visions one\r\ntries to recall on awaking from a nightmare. The abominable war was\r\ncontinuing somewhere yonder, with its massacres and disasters, but the\r\nexact truth they never learned; they heard nothing but the loud, hollow\r\nclamour of slaughtered France. And now the wind was carrying the leaves\r\naway under the livid sky, and there were long deep spells of silence\r\nover the country-side, athwart which only sped the cawing of the crows,\r\npresaging a bitter winter.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance, which Henriette seldom left except to keep Jean company,\r\nhad now become a frequent subject of conversation between them. He\r\nquestioned her when she came in of an evening, learnt to know each of\r\nher charges, wished to be informed which of them were dying and which\r\nwere getting well; and she, with her heart full of all these matters,\r\ndid not cease speaking of them but recounted in great detail all that\r\nshe did during the day. \'Ah!\' she frequently repeated, \'the poor\r\nchildren, the poor children!\'\r\n\r\nThis was not the ambulance of raging battle, the ambulance where fresh\r\nblood flowed, and where the flesh amputated by the surgeon was ruddy\r\nand healthy. It was the ambulance infected by hospital gangrene,\r\nreeking of fever and death, damp with the exhalations of the patients\r\nwho were slowly attaining convalescence and of those who were dying by\r\ninches. Dr. Dalichamp had had the greatest difficulty in procuring the\r\nnecessary beds, mattresses, and sheets; in order to provide for his\r\npatients, to supply them with bread, meat and dried vegetables, not\r\nto mention compresses, bandages and other appliances, he was forced\r\nto accomplish a fresh miracle every day. As the Prussians, now in\r\npossession of the military hospital of Sedan, refused him everything,\r\neven chloroform, he obtained all his supplies from Belgium. Yet he\r\ntended German as well as French wounded, and among others a dozen\r\nBavarians who had been picked up at Bazeilles. The foes who had rushed\r\nso frantically at one another\'s throats were now lying side by side\r\nreconciled by their common sufferings. And what an abode of horror\r\nand wretchedness that ambulance was--established in two long rooms of\r\nthe disused school-house, each containing some fifty beds over which\r\nstreamed the broad pale light admitted by the lofty windows!\r\n\r\nTen days after the battle some more wounded men had been brought\r\nthither, forgotten ones who had been discovered in out-of-the-way\r\ncorners. Four of them had remained since the fight in an empty house\r\nat Balan, without any medical attendance, living no one knew how,\r\nbut probably by the charity of some neighbour; and their wounds were\r\nswarming with maggots, and they died poisoned by their filthy sores.\r\nA purulence which nothing could check was wafted hither and thither,\r\nemptying rows of beds. At the very door an odour of necrosis caught you\r\nat the throat. The wounds were suppurating, drop after drop of f\xc5\x93tid\r\npus was exuding from the drainage-tubes. It was often necessary to open\r\nthe healing flesh again in order to extract splinters of bone, the\r\npresence of which had not been previously suspected. Then an abscess\r\nwould form, some flux which broke out in another part of the body.\r\nExhausted and emaciated, ashen pale, the poor wretches endured every\r\ntorture. Some of them, prostrate, scarce breathing, lay all day long\r\nupon their backs with their eyelids closed and blackened, like corpses\r\nalready half-decomposed. Others, denied the boon of sleep, agitated by\r\nrestless insomnia, bathed in sweat, grew wildly excited as though the\r\ncatastrophe had struck them mad. But whether they were violent or calm,\r\nas soon as the shivering of the infectious fever seized them, they were\r\ndoomed--the end came, the poison triumphed, flying from one to another\r\nand carrying them all off in the same stream, as it were, of victorious\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nBut there was especially one awful room, the infernal room as it\r\nwas called, set apart for those whom dysentery, typhus, and variola\r\nhad attacked. There were many who had the black pox, and these were\r\nrestless, cried out in ceaseless delirium, and rose up erect in their\r\nbeds looking like spectres. Others, wounded in the lungs, racked by\r\nfrightful coughs, were dying of pneumonia. Others again, who howled,\r\nobtained no relief except from the refreshing cold water which was\r\nallowed to trickle on their wounds. And the hour when their wounds\r\nwere dressed was the hour which they all waited for, the only time\r\nwhen a little calmness was restored, when the beds were aired, when\r\nthe sufferers, stiffened by remaining so long without moving, were\r\neased by a change of position. And this was also the dreaded hour,\r\nfor not a day went by but the doctor, whilst examining the sores, was\r\ngrieved to notice some bluey specks, the marks of invading gangrene on\r\nsome poor devil\'s skin. The operation would take place on the morrow.\r\nAnother bit of leg or arm was cut away. And sometimes the gangrene\r\nascended yet higher, and amputation had to be repeated, until the whole\r\nlimb had been lopped off. Then perhaps the sufferer\'s entire body was\r\nattacked, became covered with the livid spots of typhus, and he had to\r\nbe removed, staggering, dizzy, and haggard, into the inferno where he\r\nsuccumbed, his flesh already dead, exhaling a corpse-like smell before\r\nhe even began to agonise.\r\n\r\nEvery evening on her return home, Henriette answered Jean\'s questions\r\nin the same tremulous tone of emotion: \'Ah, the poor children, the poor\r\nchildren!\'\r\n\r\nAnd the particulars she gave were ever the same; each day brought\r\nsimilar torments in that inferno. An arm had been amputated at the\r\nshoulder, a foot had been cut off, the resection of a humerus had\r\nbeen performed; but would these means suffice to arrest gangrene or\r\npurulent infection? Another man, too, had been buried, more frequently\r\na Frenchman, at times a German. Not a day went by but a coffin, formed\r\nof four planks hastily knocked together, left the school-house in the\r\ntwilight, accompanied by a single ambulance attendant, and often by\r\nHenriette herself, unwilling as she was that a fellow-creature should\r\nbe poked away under the ground like a dog. Two trenches had been dug in\r\nthe little cemetery of Remilly; and they all slept there side by side,\r\nthe Germans in the trench on the left, the French in that on the right,\r\nreconciled together under the sod.\r\n\r\nThough he had never seen them, Jean had ended by becoming interested in\r\nsome of the wounded and would ask for news of them: \'And how is "Poor\r\nchild" getting on to-day?\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor child\' was a little infantryman, a soldier of the 5th of the\r\nLine, who had volunteered for the war and was not yet twenty years\r\nof age. The nickname of \'Poor child\' had stuck to him because he\r\nincessantly employed it in referring to himself; and one day on being\r\nasked the reason of this, he had answered that his mother had always\r\ncalled him in that fashion. And indeed he was a poor child, for he was\r\ndying of pleurisy, brought on by a wound in the left side.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the dear lad,\' said Henriette, who felt quite a motherly affection\r\nfor him: \'he\'s not at all well, he coughed all day. It pains my heart\r\nto hear him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And your bear--your Gutmann?\' resumed Jean with a faint smile. \'Is the\r\ndoctor more hopeful?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, perhaps he will be saved, but he suffers horribly.\'\r\n\r\nGreat as was their compassion, neither of them could speak of Gutmann\r\nwithout a kind of emotional gaiety. On the very first day that the\r\nyoung woman had gone to the ambulance, she had been thunderstruck at\r\nsight of this Bavarian soldier, in whom she recognised the red-haired,\r\nred-bearded man, with big blue eyes and square-shaped nose, who had\r\ncarried her off in his arms at Bazeilles, whilst her husband was being\r\nshot. He also recognised her, but he could not speak, for a bullet,\r\npenetrating by the back of the neck, had carried away half of his\r\ntongue. And after recoiling with horror during the first two days,\r\nshuddering involuntarily each time that she approached his bed, she had\r\nbeen conquered by the despairing, gentle glances with which he watched\r\nher. Was he no longer then the monster with blood-splashed hair,\r\nand eyes inverted with rage, who haunted her with such a frightful\r\nrecollection? She had to make an effort to recognise him in this\r\nunfortunate man with such a good-natured air, who proved so docile\r\ntoo, amid his atrocious sufferings. The nature of his affliction, one\r\nof by no means frequent occurrence, his sudden distressing infirmity,\r\ntouched the entire ambulance with compassion. They were not even sure\r\nthat his name was Gutmann, he was simply called so because the only\r\nsound he could manage to utter was a grunt of two syllables which\r\nformed something like that name. With regard to other matters, it was\r\nsurmised that he was married and had children. He must have understood\r\na few words of French, for he replied at times with an energetic nod of\r\nthe head. Married? Yes, yes! Children? Yes, yes! Moreover, the emotion\r\nhe displayed one day on seeing some flour had prompted the supposition\r\nthat he might be a miller. But that was all. Where was the mill? In\r\nwhat far-away village of Bavaria were his little ones and his wife now\r\nweeping? Would he die without being identified, without a name, leaving\r\nthose who belonged to him over yonder for ever waiting for his return?\r\n\r\n\'Gutmann kissed his hand to me to-day,\' Henriette told Jean one\r\nevening. \'I can no longer give him anything to drink or render him\r\nthe slightest service, but he raises his fingers to his lips, with a\r\nfervent gesture of gratitude.--You mustn\'t smile, it\'s too dreadful, it\r\nis like being buried before one\'s time.\'\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October Jean\'s condition had improved, and the\r\ndoctor consented to remove the drainage-tube, though he still continued\r\nanxious. And yet the wound appeared to be cicatrising pretty swiftly.\r\nJean was then allowed to get up, and would spend long hours walking\r\nabout the room and sitting at the window, where he was saddened by the\r\nsight of the flying clouds. Then he began to feel bored and talked\r\nof employing himself in some way, of rendering himself useful at the\r\nfarm. One of his secret worries was the question of money, for he\r\nrealised that his two hundred francs must have been entirely spent\r\nduring the six long weeks that he had lain in bed. If old Fouchard\r\ncontinued showing him a pleasant face it must be that Henriette was\r\npaying for his board and lodging. This thought greatly worried him,\r\nthough he lacked the courage to bring about an explanation; and thus he\r\nexperienced much relief when it was agreed that he should be passed off\r\nas a new hand, entrusted, like Silvine, with a part of the house-duties\r\nwhilst Prosper attended to the outdoor work.\r\n\r\nHard though the times were, a hand the more was none too many at\r\nFouchard\'s, for the old fellow\'s affairs were prospering. Whilst the\r\nentire country was groaning in agony, bled in every limb, he had\r\ncontrived to extend his butcher\'s business to such a point that he now\r\nslaughtered three and four times as many animals as formerly. It was\r\nsaid that he had entered into a superb contract with the Prussians\r\nalready on August 31. He, who on the 30th had defended his door, gun\r\nin hand, refusing to sell even a crust of bread to the men of the\r\nSeventh Corps, shouting to them that his house was quite empty, had on\r\nthe morrow, upon the arrival of the first German soldiers, exhumed all\r\nsorts of provisions from his cellars and brought back perfect flocks\r\nand herds from the mysterious nooks where he had concealed them. And\r\nsince then he had become one of the principal purveyors of meat to the\r\nGerman armies, displaying wonderful artfulness in disposing of his\r\nstock and in getting paid for it between a couple of requisitions.\r\nOthers suffered from the often brutal demands of the conquerors, but so\r\nfar he had not supplied a bushel of flour, a cask of wine, or a quarter\r\nof beef without obtaining hard cash in return. Folks talked a good\r\ndeal about it in Remilly, and it was considered scandalous on the part\r\nof a man who had just lost his son in the war, his son whose grave he\r\ndid not even visit, Silvine being the only person who kept it trim and\r\nneat. Yet, all the same, the old fellow was respected for the talent\r\nhe displayed in making money at a time when others, thought to be very\r\nshrewd, were being stripped to the skin. For his own part, on hearing\r\nof the tittle-tattle, he shrugged his shoulders in a jeering way, and\r\nlike the obstinate man he was, whose broad back could well bear the\r\nweight of a little abuse, he contented himself with growling: \'Patriot!\r\npatriot! why, I\'m more of a patriot than all of them put together! Is\r\nit patriotic to gorge the Prussians with food for nothing? I make them\r\npay for everything. You\'ll all see, you\'ll all see, by-and-by.\'\r\n\r\nJean had only been up and about again for a couple of days when he\r\nremained too long on his legs and the doctor\'s secret fears were\r\nrealised: the sore reopened, inflammation caused the leg to swell\r\nand the wounded man had to take to his bed again. Dalichamp ended\r\nby suspecting the presence of a splinter of bone, which the efforts\r\nmade during a couple of days\' exercise had served to liberate. He\r\nsearched the wound for it and succeeded in extracting it. But all this\r\ncaused Jean a great shock and brought on a violent fever, which again\r\nexhausted him. Never before indeed had his weakness been so great.\r\nHenriette, like the faithful nurse she was, resumed her place in his\r\nroom, which was becoming quite dismal now that the winter was setting\r\nin. They were in the early days of November, the east wind had already\r\nbrought them a fall of snow, and it was bitterly cold on the tiled\r\nfloor between those four bare walls. As there was no chimney in the\r\nroom, they decided to set up a stove, the snorting of which somewhat\r\nenlivened their solitude.\r\n\r\nThe days passed by monotonously, and this first week of Jean\'s relapse\r\nwas certainly both for himself and Henriette the most melancholy of\r\ntheir long, enforced intimacy. Would their sufferings never terminate?\r\nWould danger ever and ever reappear, without any hope of an end to\r\nall their wretchedness? At every hour their thoughts flew away to\r\nMaurice, from whom they had received no further tidings. Yet it was\r\nsaid that others received letters, tiny notes brought them by carrier\r\npigeons. Doubtless some German bullet had killed, aloft in the open\r\nsky, the bird that had been bringing them their supply of joy and love.\r\nEverything seemed to become more distant, to fade away and disappear\r\nin the depths of the early winter. The war rumours now only reached\r\nthem after long intervals; the few newspapers which Dr. Dalichamp still\r\nbrought with him were often a week old. Thus their sadness was due less\r\nto certain knowledge than to what they did not know but divined, to the\r\nlong death-cry which, despite everything, they could instinctively\r\nhear piercing through the silence of the country around the farm.\r\n\r\nOne morning the doctor arrived looking terribly upset and with his\r\nhands trembling. He pulled a Belgian newspaper from his pocket and\r\nflinging it on the bed exclaimed: \'Ah, my poor friends, France is dead,\r\nBazaine has betrayed us!\'\r\n\r\nJean, who was dozing, propped up by a couple of pillows, awoke at once:\r\n\'How, betrayed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he has delivered up Metz and the army. It\'s the blow of Sedan\r\nall over again, and this time it\'s the rest of our flesh and our blood\r\nthat has gone!\' Then taking up the newspaper again he read: \'One\r\nhundred and fifty thousand prisoners, one hundred and fifty-three\r\neagles and colours, five hundred and forty-one field guns, seventy-six\r\nmitrailleuses, eight hundred fortress guns, three hundred thousand\r\nrifles, two thousand army service vans, the _mat\xc3\xa9riel_ of eighty-five\r\nbatteries----\'\r\n\r\nAnd he continued giving particulars: Marshal Bazaine, shut up with\r\nhis army in Metz, reduced to a powerless state, making no effort to\r\nbreak through the iron circle that encompassed him; his systematic\r\nintercourse with Prince Frederick Charles, his ambiguous, hesitating\r\npolitical combinations, his ambition to play a decisive part which\r\nhe did not appear, however, to have well determined; then all the\r\ncomplicated negotiations, the despatch of equivocal, lying emissaries\r\nto Count von Bismarck, King William, and the Empress-Regent, who\r\nultimately refused to treat with the enemy on the basis of a cession of\r\nterritory; and then the inevitable catastrophe, destiny completing its\r\nwork, famine breaking out in Metz, compulsory capitulation, commanders\r\nand soldiers reduced to accept the harsh terms of the victors. France\r\nno longer had an army![42]\r\n\r\n\'Curse it!\' swore Jean in a hollow voice. He did not yet understand\r\neverything, but until that moment he had continued in the belief that\r\nBazaine was the great captain, the one possible saviour of France. \'And\r\nwhat\'s to be done now?\' he gasped. \'What is becoming of them in Paris?\'\r\n\r\nThe doctor, as it happened, was just coming to the news from Paris,\r\nwhich was disastrous. He called attention to the fact that his\r\nnewspaper bore the date of November 5. Metz had surrendered on October\r\n27, and the news had only been known in Paris on the 30th. After the\r\nrepulses at Chevilly, Bagneux, and La Malmaison, after the fight\r\nand loss of Le Bourget, these tidings from Metz had fallen like a\r\nthunderbolt on the despairing population, which was already irritated\r\nby the weakness and impotence of the Government of National Defence.\r\nAnd thus, on the morrow, October 31, quite an insurrection had broken\r\nout, an immense crowd assembling on the Place de l\'H\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville,\r\ninvading the building, and detaining as prisoners the members of the\r\nGovernment whom the National Guard did not deliver till late at night\r\nand then only because they feared the triumph of the revolutionaries\r\nwho demanded the Commune.[43] And to this account of the affair the\r\nBelgian newspaper appended some extremely insulting remarks concerning\r\nthe great city of Paris, which civil war was rending when the enemy was\r\nat its gates. Was not this the final decomposition, the puddle of blood\r\nand mire into which this falling world must ultimately sink?\r\n\r\n\'It\'s quite true,\' muttered Jean, who was extremely pale, \'they\r\noughtn\'t to fight among themselves when the Prussians are there.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette, who had so far said nothing, not wishing to meddle in these\r\npolitical matters, was now, however, unable to restrain the cry of her\r\nheart. She was thinking of her brother! \'Good heavens! I hope that\r\nMaurice, who is so excitable, won\'t mix himself up in all those things.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then that ardent patriot, the doctor, resumed:\r\n\'No matter, other soldiers will spring up if there be none left. Metz\r\nhas surrendered, Paris itself may surrender, but even that won\'t be the\r\nend of France. The chest\'s all right, as our peasants say, and we shall\r\nstill survive.\'\r\n\r\nIt could be seen, however, that he was forcing himself to be hopeful.\r\nHe spoke of the new army now being formed on the Loire, whose first\r\noperations in the direction of Artenay had not proved very fortunate:\r\nhowever, it would soon become inured to warfare and march to the help\r\nof Paris. The doctor was particularly excited by the proclamations in\r\nwhich Gambetta, who had left Paris on October 7, and two days later\r\nhad established himself at Tours, called all citizens under arms, in\r\nlanguage at once so virile and so sensible that the entire country was\r\nsurrendering itself to his dictatorship. And was it not also proposed\r\nto form another army in the North, and yet another one in the East--to\r\nmake soldiers spring from the ground by the mere power of faith? It\r\nwas the awakening of the provinces, the unconquerable determination to\r\ncreate and provide everything that was lacking, and to fight on to the\r\nlast copper and the last drop of blood.\r\n\r\n\'Hum!\' the doctor added, as he rose to go away, \'I myself have often\r\ncondemned patients who were on their legs again a week afterwards.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, make haste and cure me, doctor, so that I may return to my\r\nduties,\' said Jean smiling.\r\n\r\nHowever, both he and Henriette were greatly saddened by all these evil\r\ntidings. That same evening there was another snowstorm, and next day,\r\nwhen Henriette came back from the ambulance shivering, she announced\r\nthat Gutmann was dead. The bitter cold was decimating the wounded,\r\nemptying rows upon rows of beds. The wretched dumb soldier with the\r\ntongueless mouth had agonised during two long days. Henriette had\r\nremained at his bedside during his last hours, unable to resist the\r\nsupplicating glances he had turned towards her. He spoke to her with\r\nhis tearful eyes, perhaps trying to tell her his real name, and the\r\nname of the distant village where his wife and little ones were waiting\r\nfor him. And he passed away, unknown, sending her with his twitching\r\nfingers a last farewell kiss, as though to thank her for all her\r\nkindness. She alone accompanied his body to the cemetery, where the\r\nfrozen earth, the heavy foreign soil mingled with lumps of snow, fell\r\nwith a dull sound upon his deal coffin.\r\n\r\nThen on her return the next evening she exclaimed: \'"Poor child" is\r\ndead!\' For this one she was weeping: \'If you could only have seen him\r\nin his delirium. He called me "Mamma! mamma!" and stretched out such\r\nloving arms that I had to take him on my knees. Ah! the poor fellow!\r\nsuffering had so wasted him that he weighed no heavier than a little\r\nboy. And I rocked him in my arms so that he might die relieved--yes,\r\nI rocked him whilst he called me mother, though I am but a few years\r\nolder than he was. He wept, poor fellow, and I could not help weeping\r\nmyself and am still weeping now.\' Her sobs were suffocating her and she\r\nhad to pause. \'When he died,\' she resumed, \'he stammered that nickname\r\nof his: "Poor child! poor child!" Ah, yes indeed, they are poor\r\nchildren, all of them, all those brave fellows, some of them so young,\r\nwhom your abominable war maims and mangles, whom it condemns to so much\r\nsuffering before they are laid in the ground!\'\r\n\r\nAnd now not a day went by but Henriette came home distracted by some\r\nfresh agony; and the sufferings of others seemed to link her and Jean\r\ncloser together during the sad hours when they were so much alone in\r\nthat large, peaceful room. And yet those hours were also very sweet\r\nones, for affection had come to them, a fraternal affection, as they\r\nthought, between their two hearts which had slowly learned to know\r\none another. He, of such a thoughtful nature, had risen to a higher\r\nlevel during their continuous intimacy; she, finding him so good and\r\nreasonable, no longer remembered that he was but one of the humble,\r\nand had driven the plough before he carried the knapsack. They agreed\r\ntogether very well, they got on capitally, as Silvine expressed it with\r\nher grave smile. No embarrassment had ever arisen between them whilst\r\nshe nursed him. Invariably clad in the black garments of her widowhood,\r\nit seemed as though she had ceased to be a woman.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, during the long afternoons when he found himself alone, Jean\r\ncould not help pondering on it all. His feeling towards her was one of\r\ninfinite gratitude, a kind of devout respect that would have impelled\r\nhim to brush aside any idea of love as sacrilegious. Still he reflected\r\nthat had he had such a woman as her for his wife, one so loving, so\r\ngentle, and so helpful, life would have become an earthly paradise.\r\nHis earlier misfortunes, the evil years he had spent at Rognes, his\r\ndisastrous marriage, the tragic death of his wife, all the past came\r\nback to him with regretfulness for love, and a vague confused hope of\r\nwooing happiness once more. He closed his eyes, allowed himself to\r\nsink into a semi-somnolent state, and then confusedly pictured himself\r\nat Remilly, married afresh, and owning a field or two, which would\r\nsuffice to provide for a couple of honest, unaspiring folks. The vision\r\nwas so slight, so vague, that it could most certainly never have any\r\nexistence. Indeed, he deemed himself henceforth incapable of any warmer\r\nfeeling than friendship, and if he were so attached to Henriette it\r\nwas, he thought, simply because he was Maurice\'s brother. Nevertheless,\r\nthis hazy dream of marriage at last became a consolation as it were,\r\none of those fancies with which one cheers the hours of sadness, though\r\none knows that they can never be realised.\r\n\r\nNo such thoughts, however, had for a moment presented themselves to\r\nHenriette\'s mind. The atrocious tragedy of Bazeilles had lacerated her\r\nheart, and if any relief, any fresh affection were penetrating it, it\r\ncould only be without her knowledge, by a stealthy march like that of\r\nthe germinating seed, whose hidden labour there is nothing to reveal.\r\nShe was ignorant even of the pleasure she at last took in remaining for\r\nhours beside Jean\'s bed, reading to him those newspapers which brought\r\nthem, however, only sadness. Never had the slightest warmth come to\r\nher hand when it brushed against his; never even had thought of the\r\nmorrow left her in a dreamy mood, with a wish to be loved again. And\r\nyet it was only in that room that she forgot, and felt consoled. When\r\nshe was there, busying herself with her gentle activeness, her heart\r\ngrew calmer; it seemed to her as though her brother would soon come\r\nback again, that everything would be arranged, and that it would end\r\nby their all being happy together, never to part again. And she would\r\nspeak of all this without feeling in any wise embarrassed, so natural\r\ndid it seem to her that things should end in this way; and never did\r\nshe think of questioning herself any further, utterly ignorant as she\r\nwas that she had chastely bestowed her heart.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, however, as she was about to return to the ambulance,\r\nthe terror that froze her at sight of a Prussian captain and two other\r\nofficers whom she found in the kitchen revealed to her the great\r\naffection that she felt for Jean. These officers had evidently heard of\r\nthe wounded man\'s presence at the farm, and had come to fetch him--he\r\nwould inevitably be dragged away, carried off into captivity in the\r\ndepths of some German fortress. She listened, trembling, with her heart\r\nbeating loudly.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a stout man, who spoke French with scarcely any foreign\r\naccent, was violently upbraiding old Fouchard: \'It cannot go on like\r\nthis,\' he said; \'you are playing the fool with us! I came in person to\r\nwarn you that should it occur again I shall make you responsible, and\r\ntake steps to punish you.\'\r\n\r\nThe old man, although he was really very cool and collected, affected\r\nthe bewilderment of one who fails to understand, with his mouth agape\r\nand his arms hanging: \'What is it, sir, what is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t get my blood up; you know very well that the three cows you sold\r\nus last Sunday were rotten--yes, rotten--or rather diseased; killed by\r\nsome disgusting complaint--for the meat has quite poisoned my men, and\r\ntwo of them must now be dead.\'\r\n\r\nAt this Fouchard put on an air of virtuous indignation: \'Rotten?\r\nMy cows rotten! Such beautiful meat; meat fit to be given to an\r\n_accouch\xc3\xa9e_ to restore her to health and strength!\' Then he whimpered\r\nand thumped himself on the chest, and declared that he was an honest\r\nman, and would rather cut off some of his own flesh than sell any bad\r\nmeat. He was known, and for thirty years that he had been a butcher\r\nthere was nobody in the world who could say that he had not always\r\ngiven good weight and good quality. \'Those cows were as healthy as\r\nthey could be, sir, and if your men have had the stomach-ache, it must\r\nsurely be because they ate too much; unless some villains dropped some\r\npoison in the pot----\'\r\n\r\nHe poured forth such a flood of words, indulged in such ridiculous\r\nsuppositions that the captain, quite beside himself, hastily\r\ninterrupted him: \'That will do! You are warned, so take care! And now\r\nanother matter: We suspect all of you here, in this village, of lending\r\nassistance to the Francs-tireurs of the Dieulet Woods, who killed\r\nanother of our sentries only the night before last. You hear me? well,\r\nmind you take care!\'\r\n\r\nWhen the Prussians had gone away old Fouchard shrugged his shoulders\r\nand sneered with profound contempt. Diseased animals indeed? why of\r\ncourse he sold them diseased animals, he didn\'t sell them anything\r\nelse! All the carrion that the peasants brought him, whatever died\r\nof disease and was picked up in the ditches--wasn\'t that good enough\r\nfor those dirty hounds? Turning towards Henriette, whose fears had\r\nbeen relieved on discovering what purpose it was that had brought the\r\nPrussians there, he tipped her a wink and muttered with a chuckle of\r\ntriumph: \'And to think, little one, that some folks say I\'m not a\r\npatriot. Why don\'t they do as I do, cram those brutes with bad meat and\r\npocket their silver? Not a patriot, indeed! Why, I shall have killed\r\nmore of them with my rotten cows than many soldiers will have killed\r\nwith their chassepots!\'\r\n\r\nHowever, when Jean came to hear of the affair he felt very uneasy.\r\nIf the German authorities suspected the inhabitants of Remilly of\r\nharbouring the Francs-tireurs of the Dieulet Woods they might at any\r\ntime make a perquisition and discover him. The idea of compromising\r\nthose who had sheltered him, of causing Henriette the slightest worry,\r\nwas more than he could bear, and he was anxious to leave the farm at\r\nonce. So pressing, however, were the young woman\'s entreaties, that\r\nshe prevailed on him to stay a few days longer, for his wound was\r\ncicatrising but slowly, and his legs were not yet strong enough to\r\nenable him to join one of the campaigning regiments either in the North\r\nor on the Loire.\r\n\r\nThen, until mid-December, came the most nipping, dismal, heartrending\r\ndays of their solitude. The cold had become so intense that the stove\r\nno longer warmed the big, bare room. Whenever they looked out of the\r\nwindow at the thick snow covering the ground they bethought themselves\r\nof Maurice, buried over yonder in frozen, lifeless Paris, whence no\r\ncertain tidings reached them. The same questions were ever on their\r\nlips: What was he doing? Why did he give no sign of life? They did\r\nnot dare to express their horrible fears--he might be wounded, ill,\r\nperhaps dead. The vague, scanty information which from time to time\r\nstill reached them through the newspapers was not of a nature to\r\nreassure them. After various reports of so-called successful _sorties_,\r\ninvariably contradicted as time went on, there had come a rumour of a\r\ngreat victory gained at Champigny, on December 2, by General Ducrot.\r\nBut they afterwards learned that he had been obliged to recross the\r\nMarne on the morrow, abandoning the positions he had conquered to the\r\nfoe. And now at each hour the bonds that were strangling Paris pressed\r\nmore and more tightly round her, famine was beginning, potatoes as\r\nwell as cattle and horses had been requisitioned, gas was no longer\r\nsupplied to private consumers, and the streets were soon plunged\r\nat night-time into perfect darkness, through which, ere long, the\r\nbombarding shells were to wing their lurid flight. And now Jean and\r\nHenriette never warmed themselves, never ate without being haunted by\r\nthoughts of Maurice and those two millions of living beings shut up in\r\nthat gigantic tomb.\r\n\r\nFrom all sides, moreover, from Northern as from Central France, the\r\ntidings were becoming more grievous. In the North the Twenty-second\r\nArmy Corps, formed of Mobile Guards, dep\xc3\xb4t companies, officers and\r\nsoldiers who had escaped the disasters of Sedan and Metz, had been\r\nobliged to abandon Amiens and fall back in the direction of Arras; and\r\nRouen in its turn had just fallen into the enemy\'s hands, no serious\r\neffort to defend it having been made by that handful of demoralised,\r\ndisbanded men. In Central France, the victory of Coulmiers, gained on\r\nNovember 3 by the Army of the Loire, had given birth to ardent hopes:\r\nOrleans having been reoccupied and the Bavarians put to flight, a\r\nforward march would ensue by way of Etampes, and Paris would speedily\r\nbe delivered. But on December 5, Prince Frederick Charles recaptured\r\nOrleans, and cut the Army of the Loire in two, three of its corps\r\nwithdrawing towards Vierzon and Bourges whilst the two others under\r\nthe orders of General Chanzy fell back, step by step, as far as Le\r\nMans, during an entire week of incessant marching and fighting. The\r\nPrussians were everywhere--at Dijon as well as at Dieppe, on the road\r\nto Le Mans as well as at Vierzon. And then, too, almost every morning\r\nthere resounded the distant crash of some stronghold capitulating\r\nunder the shells. Strasburg had succumbed already on September 28,\r\nafter forty-six days of siege and thirty-seven days of bombardment,\r\nits ramparts pounded, its monuments riddled by nearly two hundred\r\nthousand projectiles. The citadel of Laon had previously blown\r\nup, Toul also had capitulated; and then came a dismal procession\r\nof surrenders:--Soissons, with one hundred and twenty-eight guns;\r\nSchelestadt, with one hundred and twenty; Verdun, which mounted one\r\nhundred and thirty-six; Neuf Brisach, one hundred; La F\xc3\xa8re, seventy;\r\nMontm\xc3\xa9dy, sixty-five. Thionville, mounting its two hundred and fifty\r\ncannon, was in flames; Phalsburg, defended by five and sixty guns, only\r\nopened its gates during the twelfth week of its furious resistance.\r\nIt seemed as though the whole of France were burning, crumbling, and\r\nsinking amid the rageful cannonade.[44]\r\n\r\nOne morning when Jean insisted on starting off Henriette caught hold of\r\nhis hands and detained him with a despairing grasp. \'No, no,\' said she,\r\n\'do not leave me all alone, I beg of you; you are still too weak, wait\r\nfor a few days, only for a few days longer; I promise that I will let\r\nyou start when the doctor says you are strong enough to fight.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGOLIATH THE SPY--AN AWFUL VENGEANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat icy December evening Silvine and Prosper were alone with Charlot\r\nin the large kitchen of the farmhouse, she sewing and he engaged in\r\nmaking himself a fine whip. It was seven o\'clock; they had dined at\r\nsix without waiting for old Fouchard, who must have been detained at\r\nRaucourt, where there was a scarcity of meat; and Henriette, whose turn\r\nit was that night to sit up watching at the ambulance, had just gone\r\noff after instructing Silvine to fill Jean\'s stove with coals before\r\nshe went to bed.\r\n\r\nOut of doors the sky hung very blackly over the white snow. Not a\r\nsound came from the buried village, and in the room nothing could be\r\nheard save Prosper\'s knife as he diligently cut rosettes and lozenges\r\nin the bark of the dog-wood whip-stock. At times he paused and looked\r\nat Charlot, who, overcome by drowsiness, was nodding his big fair\r\nhead. When the child had at last fallen asleep it seemed as though the\r\nsilence had become yet more intense. The mother had gently pushed the\r\ncandle aside so that the light might not fall upon her little one\'s\r\neyelids; and, still plying her needle, she sank at last into a deep\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Prosper, after again hesitating, made up his mind to\r\nspeak: \'I say, Silvine, I\'ve something to tell you. Yes, I was waiting\r\nto be alone with you to tell you about it.\'\r\n\r\nThese words sufficed to render her anxious, and she raised her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'This is what it is. Forgive me for distressing you, but it is best\r\nthat you should be warned. Close by the church this morning, at\r\nRemilly, I saw Goliath just as I see you now, full in the face, so that\r\nthere was no mistaking him.\'\r\n\r\nShe became quite livid, her hands trembled, and she could only stammer\r\na hollow plaint: \'Oh! my God, my God!\'\r\n\r\nProsper continued talking in his prudent way, relating what he had\r\nlearnt during the day by questioning one and another of the villagers.\r\nNot one of them now entertained a doubt but that Goliath was a spy and\r\nhad formerly taken up his abode in the district in order to become\r\nacquainted with its roads and resources, and the most trifling details\r\nof its inhabitants\' mode of life. Folks remembered his stay at old\r\nFouchard\'s farm, the abrupt fashion in which he had taken himself\r\noff, and the situations which he had afterwards held over towards\r\nBeaumont and Raucourt. And now he had come back again, holding an\r\nequivocal position at the Commandature of Sedan and once more scouring\r\nthe surrounding villages, as though it were his business to denounce\r\ncertain folks and tax others, and exercise a surveillance respecting\r\nthe requisitions with which the inhabitants were being overwhelmed.\r\nThat morning he had terrorised Remilly with respect to the delivery of\r\nsome flour which was not being supplied with sufficient promptitude or\r\nin sufficient quantities.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you are warned,\' repeated Prosper as he finished his narrative,\r\n\'so you will know what to do when he comes here.\'\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him with a cry of terror: \'You think he will come here\r\nthen?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it seems to me sure enough. Especially if he\'s at all\r\ninquisitive, for he has never seen the little one, though he must know\r\nthat he exists. And besides there\'s you whom he may wish to see again.\'\r\n\r\nShe silenced him with an entreating gesture. Charlot, awakened by the\r\ntalking, had raised his head. With a vague expression in his eyes, as\r\nthough he were emerging from a dream, he recalled an insulting phrase\r\nwhich some village joker had taught him, and with the grave air of\r\nthe three-year-old urchin that he was, declared: \'They\'re pigs, the\r\nPrussians.\'\r\n\r\nAt this his mother distractedly caught him in her arms and sat him on\r\nher lap. Ah! the poor little fellow, at once her joy and her despair\r\nwhom she loved with her whole soul, but whom she could not look at\r\nwithout weeping, this son of hers whom to her grief she often heard\r\ncalled the Prussian by the youngsters of his own age who played with\r\nhim on the road. She kissed him as if to drive his words back into his\r\nmouth. \'Who taught you such naughty words? You mustn\'t say them, my\r\ndarling.\'\r\n\r\nWith childish obstinacy, however, Charlot stifled a laugh and made all\r\nhaste to repeat: \'The Prussians are pigs!\'\r\n\r\nThen, on seeing his mother burst into tears, he also began to cry,\r\nwinding his arms round her neck. Ah, Lord! what new misfortune was in\r\nstore for her! Was it not sufficient that she had lost in Honor\xc3\xa9 the\r\nonly hope of her life, the certainty of forgetting and of becoming\r\nhappy once more? At present that other man must needs reappear to make\r\nher misery complete.\r\n\r\n\'Come,\' she murmured, \'come to by-by, my darling. Mother loves you very\r\ndearly all the same, for you don\'t know that you grieve her.\'\r\n\r\nThen she went off, leaving Prosper for a moment alone. He, in order not\r\nto embarrass her by his glances, had pretended to be wholly absorbed in\r\ncarving his whip-stock.\r\n\r\nHowever, before putting Charlot to bed, Silvine habitually took him to\r\nsay good-night to Jean, with whom he was great friends. That evening,\r\nas she entered the room candle in hand, she perceived the wounded\r\nman sitting up in bed with his eyes wide open. So he wasn\'t asleep,\r\nthen? Well, no, he had been ruminating on all sorts of matters, in the\r\nsilence of that wintry night. And whilst she crammed the stove with\r\ncoals, he played for a moment with Charlot who rolled about on the\r\nbed like a kitten. Jean was acquainted with Silvine\'s story and had\r\na friendly feeling for this brave, docile girl, so severely tried by\r\nmisfortune, now in mourning for the only man she had ever loved, with\r\nno other consolation remaining to her than that little child whose\r\nbirth had proved her everlasting torment. And thus, when, after closing\r\nthe stove, she drew near to the bed to take Charlot in her arms again,\r\nJean, detecting by the redness of her eyes that she had been weeping,\r\nbegan to question her. What was the matter, then? Had somebody been\r\ngrieving her again? But she would not answer: later on, if it were\r\nworth while, she would perhaps tell him all about it. Ah! good Lord!\r\nhad not her life now become a life of ceaseless grief?\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of taking Charlot away when all at once a sound\r\nof voices and footsteps was heard in the yard. Jean listened in\r\nsurprise. \'What\'s up? It can\'t be Fouchard coming back, I didn\'t hear\r\nthe cartwheels.\'\r\n\r\nWhilst lying in that lonely, distant room he had ended by acquiring a\r\nknowledge of all the inner life of the farm, the slightest sounds of\r\nwhich had become familiar to him. Still lending an ear, he promptly\r\nresumed: \'Ah, yes, it\'s those fellows, the Francs-tireurs of the\r\nDieulet Woods, who have come for some grub.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quick, I must make haste to give them their bread,\' muttered Silvine\r\nas she went off again, leaving him in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFists were hammering loudly on the kitchen door, whilst Prosper,\r\nannoyed at finding himself alone, was hesitating and parleying. He\r\nhardly liked to open the door when the master was away, for fear of any\r\ndamage that might be done, the responsibility of which would have been\r\nthrown upon his shoulders. Luckily, however, just at that moment, old\r\nFouchard\'s cart came down the sloping road, the clatter of the horse\'s\r\ntrot being deadened by the snow. And thus it was the old fellow himself\r\nwho received the men.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! all right, it\'s you three. What have you brought me in that\r\nbarrow?\'\r\n\r\nSambuc, with his spare bandit figure quite lost in a blue woollen\r\nblouse considerably too large for him, did not even hear Fouchard, such\r\nwas his exasperation with Prosper, that honest brother of his, as he\r\nput it, who had only just made up his mind to unlock the door.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' shouted the Franc-tireur, \'do you take us for beggars that you\r\nleave us outside in such weather as this.\'\r\n\r\nProsper, however, remained quite calm and shrugged his shoulders\r\nwithout answering a word; and whilst he went out to take the horse\r\nand cart to the stables it was again old Fouchard who intervened. \'So\r\nyou\'ve brought me two dead sheep,\' said he, leaning over the barrow.\r\n\'It\'s lucky that it\'s freezing, or they wouldn\'t smell at all pleasant.\'\r\n\r\nAt this, Cabasse and Ducat, Sambuc\'s two lieutenants who accompanied\r\nhim on all his expeditions, began protesting. \'Oh!\' said the first with\r\nhis loud-mouthed Proven\xc3\xa7al vivacity, \'they haven\'t been dead more than\r\nthree days. They came from the Raffins farm, where there\'s a lot of\r\nnasty illness among the animals.\'\r\n\r\n\'_\'Procumbit humi bos_,\' declaimed his comrade, the ex-process-server,\r\nwho had lost caste through his immorality and who was addicted to\r\nquoting Latin.\r\n\r\nTossing his head, old Fouchard went on disparaging the merchandise,\r\nwhich, said he, was \'altogether too far gone.\' However, on entering\r\nthe kitchen with the three men, he ended by exclaiming: \'Well, well,\r\nthey\'ll have to content themselves with it. It\'s lucky that they\r\nhaven\'t a cutlet left at Raucourt. A man eats anything when he\'s\r\nhungry, eh?\' And then, in reality quite delighted, he called to Silvine\r\nwho was coming back after putting Charlot to bed: \'Bring some glasses,\r\nwe\'ll drink a drop to Bismarck kicking the bucket.\'\r\n\r\nIn this fashion did Fouchard keep up an intercourse with the\r\nFrancs-tireurs of the Dieulet Woods who, for nearly three months now\r\nhad been crawling out of their impenetrable thickets at nightfall,\r\nprowling along the roads, killing and rifling such Prussians as they\r\nwere able to surprise, and falling back on the farms and levying\r\ncontributions on the peasants whenever there was a scarcity of German\r\n\'game.\' They were the terror of the villages, the more so as each time\r\na convoy was attacked, each time a sentry was butchered, the German\r\nauthorities avenged themselves on the neighbouring localities, accusing\r\ntheir inhabitants of connivance, fining them, carrying off their mayors\r\nas prisoners, and burning their homesteads. And if the peasants,\r\ndespite all their longing to do so, failed to betray Sambuc and his\r\nband, it was simply through fear of being hit by a bullet at some turn\r\nof a pathway, in the event of the attempt to capture the Francs-tireurs\r\nresulting in failure.\r\n\r\nFouchard for his part had the extraordinary idea of doing business with\r\nthese fellows. Beating the country as they did in all directions, the\r\nditches as well as the cattle-sheds and sheep-cots, they had become\r\nhis purveyors of diseased meat. Not an ox nor a sheep died within a\r\nradius of three leagues but they came at night to pick it up and take\r\nit to him. And he paid them in provisions, especially in bread, big\r\nbatches of loaves which Silvine baked expressly for them. Moreover,\r\nalthough the old fellow scarcely liked the Francs-tireurs, he had a\r\nsecret admiration for them, cunning rogues that they were, plying\r\ntheir calling without caring a rap for anybody; and, although he was\r\nrealising a fortune by his dealings with the Prussians, he laughed\r\ninwardly, with the laugh of a savage, whenever he learnt that another\r\nof them had been found by the wayside with his throat cut.\r\n\r\n\'To your health!\' said he, chinking glasses with the three men, and,\r\nafter wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he added: \'I say,\r\nwhat a row they\'ve been making about those two Uhlans whom they found\r\nnear Villecourt with their heads missing. You know that Villecourt\r\nhas been burning since yesterday; it\'s a sentence, as they say, that\r\nthey\'ve passed on the village to punish it for having harboured you.\r\nYou must be prudent, mind; and don\'t come back here for a time. Your\r\nbread shall be taken to you.\' Shrugging his shoulders, Sambuc began\r\nto sneer. Pooh! the Prussians might run as fast as they liked, they\r\nwouldn\'t catch him! Then all at once he flew into a violent passion,\r\nand, thumping on the table, exclaimed: \'Thunder! yes, it\'s nice to get\r\nhold of the Uhlans, no doubt, but it\'s the other chap that I\'d like\r\nto say a word to--you know him, the spy, that fellow who worked for\r\nyou----\'\r\n\r\n\'Goliath,\' said Fouchard.\r\n\r\nQuite startled, Silvine, who had just taken up her work again, ceased\r\nsewing and listened.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the man, Goliath! Ah! the brigand! he knows the Dieulet Woods\r\nas well as I know my pocket, and he\'s quite capable of getting us\r\ncaught one of these mornings. In fact, he bragged to-day at the Malta\r\nCross that he\'d settle our business for us within a week. The dirty\r\nrogue! it was certainly he who guided the Bavarians through the woods,\r\non the day before the fight at Beaumont--wasn\'t it, you fellows, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'As sure as that\'s a candle lighting us!\' declared Cabasse.\r\n\r\n\'_Per amica silentia lun\xc3\xa6_,\' added Ducat, whose quotations were not\r\nalways apposite.\r\n\r\nWith another thump of his fist, Sambuc made the table shake. \'He is\r\njudged and condemned, the brigand! If you should happen to know where\r\nhe\'s going at any time, just warn me, and his head shall join those of\r\nthe Uhlans in the Meuse--yes, thunder! I\'ll answer for it!\'\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Silvine, who was very pale, gazed fixedly at the\r\nFrancs-tireurs.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, these are not things to talk about,\' resumed Fouchard,\r\nprudently. \'Here\'s to your health, and good-evening!\'\r\n\r\nThey finished emptying the second bottle. Silvine had already stowed\r\nthe bread away in a sack; and Prosper, who had now returned from the\r\nstable, helped to hoist it on to the barrow in place of the two dead\r\nsheep. However, he turned his back without so much as answering when\r\nhis brother and the others went off, disappearing with the barrow\r\nthrough the snow, and repeating: \'Good-night, everyone--to the pleasure\r\nof meeting again.\'\r\n\r\nThe very next day, whilst old Fouchard was sitting alone after\r\nbreakfast, he saw Goliath himself walk in, tall and fat, with the same\r\npink face and quiet smile as formerly. If the old man was startled by\r\nthis sudden apparition, at all events he did not allow it to be seen,\r\nbut sat there blinking, whilst the other stepped forward and gave him a\r\nfair and square shake of the hand. \'Good day to you, father Fouchard!\'\r\n\r\nNot till then did the old fellow appear to recognise his visitor.\r\n\'Hallo! is it you, my lad! Why, you\'ve grown even bigger than you were.\r\nHow fat you are!\'\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he scanned him from head to foot. Clad in a kind of\r\ncapote of thick blue cloth, with a cap of the same material on his\r\nhead, Goliath had the prosperous appearance of a man well pleased with\r\nhimself. He spoke without any foreign accent, in the drawling fashion\r\nof the peasants of the district: \'Why, yes, it\'s I, father Fouchard--I\r\ndidn\'t like to pass this way without bidding you good-day.\'\r\n\r\nThe old man remained mistrustful. What was the real motive of this\r\nfellow\'s visit? Had he heard of the Francs-tireurs coming to the farm\r\non the previous evening? That was a point to be ascertained. At all\r\nevents, however, since the scamp had presented himself in a polite\r\nfashion, the best policy was to give him an equally polite greeting.\r\n\r\n\'Well, my lad, it\'s very kind of you, I\'m sure, and as you\'ve come\r\nwe\'ll drink a glass together.\'\r\n\r\nHe went in person to fetch a couple of glasses and a bottle of wine.\r\nThe consumption of so much liquor made his heart fairly bleed; but then\r\nin business it was necessary to stand treat. And, now, much the same\r\nscene as that of the previous evening was enacted: they chinked glasses\r\nwith similar gestures and similar words.\r\n\r\n\'To your health, father Fouchard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s to yours, my lad!\'\r\n\r\nThey drank, and Goliath complacently tarried there, looking around\r\nhim like a man who is well pleased to orate old times and things.\r\nHowever, he did not speak of the past, nor, for the matter of that,\r\ndid he refer to the present. The conversation mainly turned on the\r\nsevere cold weather, which would interfere with the work in the\r\nfields; though fortunately there was some good in the snow, for it\r\nkilled the grubs. Scarcely did the spy indulge in an expression of\r\nvague chagrin with reference to the covert hatred, terror, and scorn\r\nwith which he had been received in the other houses of Remilly. Every\r\nman has his country, hasn\'t he? And it is only natural that he should\r\nserve it as he thinks fit. However, French people had funny ideas about\r\ncertain things. Whilst he talked on in this strain the old man looked\r\nat him and listened to him; and on finding him so reasonable and so\r\nconciliatory, so placid, too, with his broad smiling face, he concluded\r\nthat this honest fellow had certainly not come to the farm with any\r\nevil intentions.\r\n\r\n\'And so you\'re all alone to-day, father Fouchard?\' said Goliath at last.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no--Silvine\'s giving the cows their feed. Would you like to see\r\nher?\'\r\n\r\nGoliath began to laugh. \'Well, yes. To tell you the plain truth, it was\r\nto see Silvine that I came.\'\r\n\r\nThis answer raised a great load from old Fouchard\'s mind. Springing\r\nfrom his chair, he called in a loud voice: \'Silvine! Silvine! Here\'s\r\nsome one for you.\' And thereupon he went off, henceforth without any\r\nfears, since the girl was there to protect the house. When a man still\r\nhankers after a woman like that, after so many years, he is as good as\r\ndone for.\r\n\r\nWhen Silvine came in, she was in no wise surprised to find herself in\r\npresence of Goliath, who had retained his seat and looked at her with\r\nhis good-natured smile, albeit he felt somewhat uncomfortable. She\r\nhad been expecting him, and on crossing the threshold gave no sign of\r\nemotion save that she stopped short with a sudden stiffening of her\r\nentire frame. Charlot, who had run after her, threw himself among her\r\nskirts, astonished to see this man, whom he did not know.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief interval of silence, an embarrassment of a few\r\nseconds\' duration.\r\n\r\n\'So that\'s the little one?\' Goliath ended by asking in his conciliatory\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' Silvine answered harshly.\r\n\r\nThe silence fell again. He had left Remilly prior to her\r\n_accouchement_, and, although he knew very well that there was a child,\r\nhe now saw it for the first time. He therefore wished to explain his\r\nconduct, like a practical-minded man who is convinced that he has\r\nsome good reasons to urge on his behalf. \'Come, Silvine,\' said he, \'I\r\ncan understand very well that you have harboured a grudge against me.\r\nAnd yet it\'s not altogether just. If I went off as I did, if I caused\r\nyou all that grief, you ought to have bethought yourself that it was\r\nperhaps because I wasn\'t my own master. When a man has superiors and is\r\nunder orders he must obey them, mustn\'t he? They might have ordered me\r\non a journey a hundred leagues away on foot, and I should have gone.\r\nAnd naturally I couldn\'t speak out. It pained my heart, and no mistake,\r\nto have to go off like that without a parting word. I won\'t say that I\r\nwas certain I should come back again; however, I always expected to do\r\nso, and you see, here I am----\'\r\n\r\nShe had turned her head aside and was looking through the window at the\r\nsnow in the courtyard, as though determined not to listen. Disturbed by\r\nher contempt, her stubborn silence, he paused in his explanations to\r\nexclaim: \'Do you know you are prettier than ever?\'\r\n\r\nShe did in fact look very beautiful, with her creamy pallor and those\r\nsuperb large eyes lighting up her face. Her heavy tresses of jet black\r\nhair crowned her head as with a diadem of eternal mourning.\r\n\r\n\'Come,\' said Goliath, \'be a little more amiable! You must know that I\r\ndon\'t want to harm you. If I didn\'t still love you I shouldn\'t have\r\ncome back, of course not. But now that I\'m here and everything is\r\nsettling down we\'ll be good friends again; we\'ll make it all up, won\'t\r\nwe?\'\r\n\r\nShe abruptly drew back and looked him full in the face: \'Never!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why never? Aren\'t you virtually my wife already, isn\'t that child\r\nours?\'\r\n\r\nWithout taking her eyes off him, she slowly answered: \'Listen; it\r\nis best to have done with it at once. You knew Honor\xc3\xa9; I loved him,\r\nI never loved any one but him. And he is dead; you killed him over\r\nyonder. Never again will I be yours--never!\'\r\n\r\nShe had raised her hand, and she swore her vow in a voice ringing with\r\nsuch bitter hatred that for a moment he remained quite amazed, merely\r\nmuttering: \'Yes, I knew it. Honor\xc3\xa9 is dead. He was a very nice fellow\r\ncertainly, but it can\'t be helped; others are dead too. Such is war.\r\nAnd, besides, it seemed to me that as he was dead there could be no\r\nfurther obstacle--for you must let me remind you, Silvine, I was not\r\nbrutal with you----\'\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence, however; such a look of wild\r\ndistracting agony appeared upon her face, to which she raised her hands\r\nas though to lacerate it.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! it is that--yes, that which drives me mad!\' she exclaimed. \'That\r\nI should have yielded when I did not love you! I cannot remember, I\r\nwas so sad, so ill after Honor\xc3\xa9\'s departure, and you talked about him\r\nand appeared to like him. \'Twas that perhaps which brought it to pass.\r\nO God! how many nights have I spent in weeping over my fault!--Yet\r\nhe came back, and forgave me, and told me that if you Prussians did\r\nnot kill him, he would marry me all the same, as soon as he got his\r\ndischarge. And you think that after that I could consent to become\r\nyours? Ah, no! under the axe I should still answer no, no, never!\'\r\n\r\nThis time Goliath became gloomy. He divined that her fierce resolution\r\nwas a firm one. But, on the other hand, he considered himself to\r\nbe the master, and if he did not as yet seek to impose his will by\r\nviolent means, it was because he was naturally inclined to prudence,\r\ninstinctively prone to artifice and patience. This big-fisted Colossus\r\nwas not partial to blows. And accordingly he bethought himself of\r\nanother means of forcing her to submit.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said he, \'since you won\'t take me I shall take the little\r\none.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\nCharlot, momentarily forgotten, had remained among his mother\'s skirts,\r\nmaking an effort not to burst out sobbing in the midst of the quarrel.\r\nGoliath, who had at last risen from his chair, drew near. \'Eh! you are\r\nmy little boy, aren\'t you? A little Prussian, eh? Come, and let me take\r\nyou away.\'\r\n\r\nBut Silvine, quivering from head to foot, had already caught the child\r\nin her arms and was pressing him to her bosom: \'He a Prussian? No, he\'s\r\nFrench, born in France!\'\r\n\r\n\'French! Why look at him and look at me! He\'s my very portrait. Is he\r\nat all like you?\'\r\n\r\nIt was only then that she really saw that tall fair fellow in front\r\nof her, with his curly beard and hair, broad pink face, and big, blue\r\neyes, glistening with the brilliancy of porcelain. And what he said was\r\nindeed true--the little one had the same yellow, curly crop of hair,\r\nthe same fat cheeks, the same light eyes as himself; in a word, all\r\nthe physical characteristics of the race dwelling over yonder. She\r\nherself felt that she was of a different nature, with her heavy locks\r\nof raven hair, which, in her disordered state, were slipping from her\r\nchignon over her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'I brought him into the world; he is mine!\' she resumed in a tone of\r\nfury; \'he\'s a French boy who will never know a word of your dirty\r\nGerman; yes, a French boy who will one day go and kill you all to\r\navenge those of ours whom you have killed!\'\r\n\r\nStill clinging to his mother\'s neck, Charlot had now begun to cry and\r\ncall: \'Mammy, mammy, I\'m frightened, take me away!\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Goliath, who doubtless did not wish to provoke a scandal,\r\ndrew back and contented himself with declaring in a stern voice:\r\n\'Listen carefully to what I\'m going to tell you, Silvine. I know\r\neverything that goes on here. You receive the Francs-tireurs of the\r\nDieulet Woods, your farm-hand\'s brother, that fellow Sambuc, a brigand\r\nwhom you supply with bread! And I know too that the farm-hand, that man\r\nProsper, is a Chasseur d\'Afrique, a deserter, who belongs to us; and I\r\nam also aware that you are hiding a wounded man, another soldier who on\r\na word from me would be sent to a fortress in Germany. There! you see\r\nthat I am well informed.\'\r\n\r\nSilent and terrified, she was attentively listening to him now, whilst\r\nCharlot, with his mouth close to her neck, repeated in his faltering,\r\ninfantile voice: \'Oh! mammy, mammy, take me away, I\'m frightened!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' resumed Goliath, \'I\'m certainly not malicious, and I\'ve no\r\nliking for quarrels, as you must know, but I swear to you that I\'ll\r\nhave them all arrested, old Fouchard and the others, every one of\r\nthem, if you don\'t give me a favourable answer. And I will take the\r\nlittle one away and send him to Germany, to my mother, who will be very\r\npleased to have him; for, since you want to break off everything, he\r\nbelongs to me. So you hear me, eh? I shall only have to come and take\r\nhim when there is nobody left here. I am the master, mind, and I do\r\nwhat I please. Come, what is your decision?\'\r\n\r\nShe gave no answer, however; she was pressing the child yet more\r\nclosely to her bosom, as though she feared that Goliath might there\r\nand then tear him away from her; and into her large eyes there came an\r\nexpression of mingled terror and execration.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he resumed, \'I\'ll allow you three days for reflection. I shall\r\ncome for your answer on Monday evening; see that the window of your\r\nroom, overlooking the orchard, is left open. If on Monday evening\r\nat seven o\'clock I do not find it open, I will have all your folks\r\narrested the very next day, and I\'ll come back to fetch the little one.\r\nSo till Monday, Silvine.\'\r\n\r\nHe went off quietly, whilst she remained standing there, her head\r\nbuzzing with such terrible, such monstrous ideas that it was as though\r\nshe had suddenly become an idiot. And thus, throughout the whole day,\r\na tempest warred within her. At first she instinctively thought of\r\ncarrying her child away in her arms, of going off straight before\r\nher, no matter whither. But then, what would become of her when night\r\nfell; how would she be able to earn a living for him and for herself?\r\nBesides, the Prussians scouring the roads might arrest her and possibly\r\nbring her back. Then the idea occurred to her of speaking to Jean,\r\nof warning Prosper and even Fouchard, but again she hesitated and\r\nrecoiled. Was she sure enough of their friendship to be certain that\r\nshe would not be sacrificed to their tranquillity? No, no, she would\r\nsay nothing to anybody; she alone would extricate herself from this\r\ndanger, which she herself had created by the stubbornness of her\r\nrefusal. But what scheme could she devise? in what manner could she\r\nprevent that misfortune? for all her native honesty revolted at the\r\nthought; she would never have forgiven herself if through her fault a\r\ncatastrophe should fall on so many people, and especially on Jean, who\r\nshowed himself so kind to little Charlot.\r\n\r\nHours elapsed, the following day went by, and yet she had not been\r\nable to devise any plan. She applied herself to her work as usual,\r\nswept the kitchen, attended to the cows, cooked the _soupe_. And\r\nhour by hour, amid her absolute silence--the frightful silence which\r\nshe still stubbornly maintained--her hatred of Goliath ascended with\r\nincreasing force to her brain and poisoned it. He was her sin, her\r\ndamnation, the serpent who had tempted her to her fall. But for him\r\nshe would have waited for Honor\xc3\xa9, and Honor\xc3\xa9 would be still alive and\r\nshe would be happy. In what an arrogant tone had he declared that he\r\nwas the master? Forsooth it was true, there were no more gendarmes, no\r\nmore judges to whom she could appeal for protection--might had become\r\nright. Oh! to be stronger than he was, to seize him when he came, he\r\nwho talked of seizing others! She was now entirely bound up in her\r\nchild, the flesh of her flesh; his chance father went for nothing, had\r\nindeed never counted. She was not a wife, and when she thought of that\r\nman only a feeling of anger inflamed her, the rancour of one who had\r\nbeen vanquished. Rather than surrender her child to him she would have\r\nkilled the boy and herself afterwards. And she had told him plainly,\r\nshe would have liked to have seen that child already grown to manhood\r\nand capable of defending her; and she pictured him in years to come,\r\narmed with a rifle, and riddling the bodies of all that hateful race\r\nover yonder. Yes, indeed, a Frenchman the more, a Frenchman to slay the\r\nPrussians!\r\n\r\nHowever, only one day now remained to her, and she must come to a\r\ndecision. An atrocious idea had at the very outset passed through her\r\npoor, ailing, disordered brain: she might warn the Francs-tireurs,\r\ngive Sambuc the information he desired. But the idea remained fugitive\r\nand indeterminate, and she brushed it aside as being too monstrous\r\neven for examination; after all, was not that man her child\'s father?\r\nShe could not have him murdered. Then, however, the idea came back\r\nagain, slowly enveloping her, growing, little by little, more and more\r\nimportunate; and now it was imposing itself upon her with all the\r\nvictorious strength of its simplicity and absoluteness. If Goliath were\r\ndead, Jean, Prosper, and Fouchard would have nothing more to fear. She\r\nherself would retain possession of Charlot, and nobody would ever again\r\nchallenge her right to the child. And there was something else, too,\r\nsomething deep-rooted that ascended from the innermost recesses of her\r\nbeing: a needment to have done with it all, to efface the paternity of\r\nthe child by suppressing its father, a savage joy at the thought that\r\nshe would emerge from the issue with her transgression amputated as\r\nit were, and as the one parent, the sole possessor of the child, whom\r\nhenceforth she would share with no man. All day long did she dwell\r\nupon this plan, no longer possessing the energy to repulse it, but\r\never and ever brought back to the details of the ambuscade that would\r\nbe necessary, planning and arranging its most trifling incidents. So\r\nnow, then, the idea had become a fixed one, an idea which once sown is\r\nbound to germinate, and which one ceases to discuss; and when at last\r\nshe began to put this idea to execution, to obey this impulse of the\r\ninevitable, she proceeded on her course like one in a dream, carried\r\nalong by another\'s will, by a force which she had never felt within her\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, old Fouchard, who felt uneasy, had sent word to the\r\nFrancs-tireurs that their sack of loaves would be carried to the\r\nBoisville quarries, a very lonely spot, not much more than a mile\r\naway; and, as Prosper had other things to see to, he despatched\r\nSilvine thither with a barrow. Was not fate thus deciding the issue?\r\nShe interpreted it, indeed, as a decree of Destiny, and spoke out,\r\ngiving Sambuc an appointment for the following evening, in a clear,\r\ncalm voice, as though she were not able to act otherwise. On the\r\nmorrow there were further signs, positive proofs that people and even\r\nthings had willed the crime. First, old Fouchard was abruptly summoned\r\nto Raucourt, and left word that they were to dine without him, for\r\nhe foresaw that he would be unable to get back before eight o\'clock.\r\nThen, too, Henriette, whose turn to sit up watching at the ambulance\r\nonly came on Tuesdays, received notice, late in the day, that she must\r\nthat evening take the place of the person on duty, who had fallen ill.\r\nAccordingly, as Jean never left his room, no matter what noise he\r\nheard, there only remained Prosper whose intervention was to be feared.\r\nHe was certainly not in favour of combining with others to slaughter\r\na solitary man. However, when he saw his brother and the latter\'s two\r\nlieutenants arrive at the farm, the disgust with which these rascals\r\ninspired him became blended with his execration of the Prussians. He\r\nwas certainly not going to interfere to save one of those dirty rogues,\r\neven though he might be sent to his account in a foul way, and he\r\npreferred to go to bed and bury his head under the clothes, so that he\r\nmight not hear anything and might not be tempted to act like a soldier.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter to seven, and Charlot seemed determined not to go to\r\nsleep, though as a rule his head fell upon the table as soon as he had\r\neaten his _soupe_. \'Come, go to by-by, my darling,\' repeated Silvine,\r\nwho had carried him into Henriette\'s room, \'you see how comfortable you\r\nare on friend\'s big bed.\'\r\n\r\nBut the child, enlivened by this treat, tossed about and laughed to\r\nsuffocation: \'No, no, stay with me, mammy--play with me, mammy----\'\r\n\r\nSilvine evinced great patience and gentleness, tenderly caressing the\r\nchild and repeating: \'There, go to sleep, darling. Go to sleep to\r\nplease mammy.\'\r\n\r\nAnd at last, with a laugh on his lips, the youngster fell asleep. She\r\nhad not taken the trouble to undress him, and after wrapping him up\r\nwarmly she went off without locking the door, knowing that as a rule he\r\nslept very soundly.\r\n\r\nNever had Silvine felt so calm, so clear and alert of mind. She\r\ndisplayed a promptness of decision, and a lightness of motion as though\r\nshe were detached from her body and were acting under the impulsion of\r\nthat other being within her which she did not know. She had already let\r\nin Sambuc, together with Cabasse and Ducat, cautioning them to observe\r\nthe greatest prudence; and she led them into her room and posted them\r\non the right and left of the window, which she opened, notwithstanding\r\nthe intense cold. It was a dark night; the room was but faintly\r\nillumined by the reflection of the snow. A death-like silence lay over\r\nthe country-side; long minutes went by. At last, on detecting a light\r\nfootfall which was approaching, Silvine went off into the kitchen,\r\nwhere she seated herself and waited, quite motionless, with her large\r\neyes fixed upon the candle flame.\r\n\r\nThen another long interval elapsed; Goliath prowled around the farm\r\nbefore he would risk approaching. He fancied, however, that he knew\r\nthe young woman well, and had therefore ventured to come with merely a\r\nrevolver in his belt. Nevertheless, an instinctive uneasiness warned\r\nhim, and he at first pushed the window wide open, and thrust his head\r\ninto the room, softly calling: \'Silvine! Silvine!\'\r\n\r\nAs he had found the window open it must be that she had thought the\r\nmatter over and was disposed to consent. This greatly pleased him,\r\nthough he would have preferred to have found her there to greet him\r\nand allay his uneasiness. But doubtless old Fouchard had summoned her\r\naway to finish some work. \'Silvine! Silvine!\' he again called, slightly\r\nraising his voice.\r\n\r\nStill no reply, not a sound. And thereupon he sprang over the\r\nwindow-sill and entered the room, intending to wait there for the girl;\r\nso bitter cold did he find it out of doors.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a furious scuffle; the stamping and slipping\r\nof feet resounded amid stifled oaths and gurgling groans. Sambuc\r\nand the others had rushed upon Goliath, but although they were\r\nthree to one they could not master the Colossus, whose strength was\r\nincreased tenfold by his sense of peril. The cracking of joints, all\r\nthe panting effort of gripping and straining, could be heard in the\r\ndarkness. Fortunately the spy\'s revolver had fallen. \'The ropes, the\r\nropes!\' stammered Cabasse in a choking voice, whilst Ducat passed\r\nSambuc the coil of cord with which they had taken the precaution to\r\nprovide themselves. Then came a savage operation, performed to the\r\naccompaniment of blows and kicks, Goliath\'s legs tied together, to\r\nbegin with; then his arms fastened to his sides, then his whole body\r\nbound in a fumbling, random fashion wherever his despairing efforts\r\nwould allow, and with so much winding and knotting that at last he was\r\nas though caught in a net, the meshes of which cut into his flesh. He\r\nwas still calling out and Ducat kept on repeating: \'Hold your jaw!\'\r\nBut all at once the cries ceased, for Cabasse had brutally gagged the\r\nprisoner with an old blue handkerchief which he tied behind his head.\r\nThen they at last drew breath and carried him like a parcel into the\r\nkitchen, where they laid him upon the large table beside the candle.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! the dirty Prussian!\' swore Sambuc as he wiped his forehead. \'What\r\na lot of trouble he\'s given! I say, Silvine, light another candle so\r\nthat we may get a good squint at the pig.\'\r\n\r\nWith dilated eyes and a white face, Silvine had risen to her feet.\r\nShe said not a word, but lighted a candle and placed it on the other\r\nside of Goliath\'s head, which appeared to view brilliantly illumined,\r\nas though between two funeral tapers. And at that moment Silvine\'s\r\neyes encountered those of her child\'s father; he was supplicating\r\nher, frantic, seized with an intense dread; but she did not appear to\r\nunderstand him; she stepped back to the sideboard and remained standing\r\nthere with a frigid, stubborn demeanour.\r\n\r\n\'The beggar bit half my finger off!\' growled Cabasse, whose hand was\r\nbleeding. \'I must do for him.\'\r\n\r\nHe was already raising the revolver which he had picked up in Silvine\'s\r\nroom when Sambuc disarmed him: \'No, no--no humbug, please! We are not\r\nbrigands, we are judges. Do you hear, you dirty Prussian? We are going\r\nto try you; and you needn\'t be alarmed, we respect the rights of the\r\ndefence. Only, you won\'t be allowed to defend yourself, for you\'d\r\nsimply deafen us if we took your muzzle off. By-and-by, though, I\'ll\r\nprovide you with a lawyer and a fine one too!\'\r\n\r\nHe took three chairs, placed them in a row, and in this way formed\r\nwhat he called the tribunal, his own place in the centre, with his\r\nlieutenants flanking him on right and left. They all three sat down,\r\nand then he, Sambuc, stood up again and began speaking with a derisive\r\ndrawl, which he gradually set aside till at last his voice swelled\r\nwith vengeful anger.\r\n\r\n\'I am here both as presiding judge and as public prosecutor,\' said he.\r\n\'This is not quite as it should be perhaps, but there are not enough\r\nof us to manage otherwise, so I accuse you of having come to spy on us\r\nhere in France, and of paying for the bread which you ate at our tables\r\nwith the most filthy treachery. For you were the first cause of the\r\ndisaster, you, the traitor, who after the fight at Nouart guided the\r\nBavarians, at night time, through the Dieulet Woods as far as Beaumont.\r\nOnly a man who had long lived in the district could have been so well\r\nacquainted with the smallest paths; and our minds are made up on the\r\npoint; you were seen guiding the artillery along those awful forest\r\npathways which the rain had turned into rivers of mud, and where the\r\ndifficulties were so great that eight horses had to be harnessed to\r\neach gun. On looking at those roads to-day one can hardly credit it;\r\none asks oneself how an army corps ever managed to pass along them.\r\nHad it not been for you and for your crime in coming to amuse yourself\r\namong us and then betraying us, the surprise of Beaumont wouldn\'t have\r\ntaken place, we shouldn\'t have gone to Sedan, and perhaps we should\r\nthen have ended by licking you. And I don\'t speak of the disgusting\r\ncalling which you are still plying, of your cheek in coming back here\r\nin triumph, denouncing and frightening the poor country people. You\r\nare the most ignoble blackguard there can be, and I ask that you be\r\nsentenced to the penalty of death!\'\r\n\r\nSilence prevailed. Sambuc had seated himself again; at last he said: \'I\r\nappoint Ducat to defend you. He was a process-server once, and would\r\nhave made his way in the world had he only been able to bridle his\r\npassions. You see that I deny you nothing and that we behave fairly.\'\r\n\r\nGoliath, unable to move a finger, turned his eyes upon his improvised\r\ndefender. Nothing now appeared alive in him save his eyes, eyes burning\r\nwith ardent supplication, under his livid brow, moist with the sweat of\r\nanguish, despite the cold.\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen,\' began Ducat, rising from his chair, \'my client is\r\ncertainly the most disgusting scoundrel there can be, and I would\r\nnot undertake to defend him were it not that I have one point to\r\nurge in his favour, which is that all the people of his country are\r\nof precisely the same stamp. Look at him: you can tell by his eyes\r\nthat he is greatly astonished at what I say. He has no perception\r\nof his crime. In France we only touch our spies with tongs, whereas\r\nover yonder spying is an honoured profession, a meritorious fashion\r\nof serving one\'s country. I will even venture to say, gentlemen, that\r\npossibly they are not wrong. Our noble sentiments do us honour, but\r\nthey have unfortunately brought us defeat. If I may so express myself,\r\n_quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat_--you will take that into account,\r\ngentlemen.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon he sat down again whilst Sambuc resumed: \'And you, Cabasse,\r\nhave you anything to say for or against the prisoner?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have to say,\' shouted the Proven\xc3\xa7al, \'that all this is a lot of\r\nunnecessary fuss about settling that beggar\'s account. I have had no\r\nfew worries in my time, but I don\'t like trifling with legal matters,\r\nit brings bad luck. To death! to death with him!\'\r\n\r\nSambuc solemnly rose to his feet again: \'So that is the sentence which\r\nyou both pronounce--death?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, death!\'\r\n\r\nThe chairs were pushed back and Sambuc approached Goliath, saying: \'You\r\nare sentenced, you are about to die.\'\r\n\r\nThe two candles were burning with tall flames, like death-bed tapers,\r\non either side of Goliath\'s distorted face. He was making such an\r\neffort to beg for mercy, to shriek forth the words which were stifling\r\nhim, that the blue handkerchief over his mouth became saturated with\r\nfoam; and it was a terrible sight indeed--that man reduced to silence,\r\nalready as mute as a corpse, and about to die with all that torrent of\r\nexplanations and prayers pent in his throat.\r\n\r\nCabasse cocked the revolver. \'Shall I smash his skull?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! no, no!\' shouted Sambuc, \'he would be only too glad.\' And stepping\r\nup to Goliath he added: \'You are not a soldier; you don\'t deserve the\r\nhonour of being despatched with a bullet. No, you shall die like the\r\ndirty hog of a spy that you are!\' Then turning round he said politely:\r\n\'By your leave, Silvine, I should very much like to have a tub.\'\r\n\r\nSilvine had not once stirred during the trial-scene. With rigid\r\nfeatures, she stood there waiting, her mind elsewhere, absorbed in the\r\nfixed idea that had been goading her on for two days past. And when she\r\nwas asked for a tub she simply complied with the request, vanished for\r\na moment into the adjacent store-house, and came back with the large\r\ntub in which she usually washed Charlot\'s linen.\r\n\r\n\'There, put it under the table, close to the edge,\' said Sambuc.\r\n\r\nShe placed it as requested, and as she was rising up her eyes again\r\nmet Goliath\'s. In the wretched man\'s glance a final prayer for mercy\r\nwas mingled with an expression of revolt--the revolt of one who would\r\nnot die. But at that moment nothing womanly was left in her, nothing\r\nbut her unswerving desire for that death which she awaited like\r\ndeliverance. She again drew back to the sideboard and remained there.\r\n\r\nOpening the table-drawer, Sambuc had just taken from it a large\r\nkitchen-knife, the one that was used for cutting bacon. \'As you are a\r\nhog,\' said he, \'I\'m going to bleed you like a hog.\'\r\n\r\nHe proceeded in a leisurely manner, discussing the slaughtering with\r\nCabasse and Ducat in order that it might be accomplished in proper\r\nfashion. And a dispute even arose through Cabasse declaring that in his\r\npart of the country, Provence, pigs were bled hanging head-downwards,\r\nwhereat Ducat expressed great indignation, holding this method to be\r\nboth barbarous and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\'Bring him close to the edge of the table with his head well over the\r\ntub so as not to stain the floor.\'\r\n\r\nThey drew him forward, and Sambuc then set about his task in a quiet,\r\ncleanly fashion. With one stroke of the large bacon knife he slit the\r\nwretched man\'s throat crosswise, and the blood from the severed carotid\r\nat once began dripping into the tub with a gentle plashing like that\r\nof a fountain. He had made but a small incision, so that only a few\r\ndrops spurted forth, impelled by the action of the heart. If, in this\r\nway, death came more slowly, none of its convulsions were seen, for\r\nthe ropes were strong and the body remained quite motionless. There\r\nwas not a start, not a groan. It was only by the dying man\'s face that\r\none could observe the progress of his agony--his face furrowed by\r\nfright, whence the blood departed drop by drop, leaving the skin quite\r\ncolourless, as white as linen. And the eyes were emptying also. They\r\nbecame dim and at last their light departed from them.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Silvine, we shall want a sponge all the same.\'\r\n\r\nShe gave no answer, however. She stood there as though rooted to the\r\ntiled floor, with her arms all unconsciously folded across her bosom,\r\nand with her throat gripped as by an iron collar. But all at once\r\nshe noticed that Charlot was there, hanging to her skirts. No doubt\r\nhe had awakened and managed to open the doors, and nobody had seen or\r\nheard him creep into the kitchen like the inquisitive child he was.\r\nHow long had he been there, half hidden behind his mother? He also was\r\nlooking on. From under his shock of yellow hair, those big blue eyes of\r\nhis were watching the dripping blood, the little red streamlet which\r\nwas slowly filling the tub. Possibly the sight amused him. Perhaps he\r\nhad at first failed to understand it; and then, maybe, some sense of\r\nhorror had dawned upon him, an instinctive consciousness that he was\r\nwitnessing an abomination. At all events, he suddenly raised a wild cry\r\nof affright: \'Oh! mammy, mammy, I\'m afraid--take me away!\'\r\n\r\nAnd this cry gave Silvine a shock of such violence that she reeled.\r\nThis was the last straw; something gave way, crumbled to pieces within\r\nher; horror was at last sweeping away that strength and excitement,\r\nborn of her fixed idea, which had buoyed her up for two days past.\r\nShe became a woman once more, burst into tears, and made a mad, wild\r\ngesture as she took up Charlot and distractedly pressed him to her\r\nheart. And then she rushed away with him at a terrified gallop, unable\r\nto see or hear more, feeling nought but an imperious need to go and\r\nannihilate herself, it mattered not where, in the first secluded hole\r\nthat she might fall into.\r\n\r\nAt that same moment Jean had just made up his mind to open his door.\r\nAlthough as a rule he never troubled himself about the sounds wafted\r\nto him from in and around the house, he had ended, that evening, by\r\nfeeling surprised at all the comings and goings and bursts of shouting\r\nthat he heard. And it was into his quiet room that Silvine now swept,\r\ndishevelled, sobbing, shaken by such a paroxysm of wretchedness that\r\nhe could not at first catch the disjointed words which she stammered\r\nthrough her clenched teeth. And again and again did she make the\r\nsame wild gesture as though to drive away the atrocious scene. At\r\nlast, however, Jean understood her, and then he also--in his mind\'s\r\neye--beheld the ambuscade, the slaughtering, the mother standing by\r\nwith the little one among her skirts, both gazing at the father, whose\r\nblood was trickling from his cut throat; and at the thought of so much\r\nhorror he felt icy cold, his heart was fairly overturned with anguish.\r\n\r\nAh! War, abominable War, which transformed all these poor folks into\r\nferocious wild beasts, which sowed the seed of such fearful hatred--the\r\nson bespattered with his father\'s blood, perpetuating the enmity of\r\nraces, growing up in execration of the paternal family which some day\r\nor other he might perhaps help to exterminate! Ah! the villainous seeds\r\nwhence only frightful harvests could spring!\r\n\r\nSilvine, who had fallen on a chair, covered Charlot, who clung,\r\nsobbing, to her neck, with frantic kisses, again and again repeating\r\nthe same phrase, the one cry that rose from her bleeding heart: \'Ah! my\r\npoor little one, nobody will say any more that you are a Prussian! Ah!\r\nmy poor little one, nobody will say any more that you are a Prussian!\'\r\n\r\nMeantime old Fouchard had arrived and was in the kitchen. He had rapped\r\non the door like the master he was, and the others had decided they\r\nmust let him in. And, truly, the surprise he experienced was scarcely\r\na pleasant one--that corpse lying upon his table, with the tub full\r\nof blood underneath. He was of anything but an enduring nature, and\r\nnaturally he waxed wrathful at the sight.\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t you do your dirty work out of doors, you filthy beasts?\' he\r\nshouted. \'Do you take my house for a manure pit, that you come here and\r\nspoil my furniture in that style?\' Then as Sambuc began to apologise\r\nand explain matters, the old fellow, growing alarmed and more and more\r\nirritated, continued: \'What the ---- can I do with your corpse? Do you\r\nthink it at all reasonable to stick a corpse in a man\'s house like\r\nthat, without knowing if he can dispose of it? Suppose a patrol came\r\nin, I should be in a nice fix! But you fellows don\'t care a rap, you\r\nnever considered that this business might cost me my skin. Well, curse\r\nyou, you\'ll have to deal with me if you don\'t carry your corpse away\r\nat once! You hear me! So make haste, take it up by the head, or by the\r\nlegs, or in whatever way you like, but don\'t dawdle, and mind that\r\nthere\'s not so much as a hair of that fellow\'s head left here in three\r\nminutes from now!\'\r\n\r\nIn the end Sambuc prevailed on Fouchard to provide him with a sack,\r\nthough it made the old fellow\'s heart bleed to give anything away. As\r\nit was, he chose one of the most damaged sacks that he could find,\r\ndeclaring that one full of holes even was still far too good for a\r\nPrussian. Then Cabasse and Ducat had all the trouble in the world\r\nto get Goliath into the sack, the body being so broad and so long;\r\nand, pack it as they would, they could not prevent the feet from\r\nprotruding. At last it was carried into the yard and placed on the\r\nbarrow which was used for conveying the bandits\' bread to them.\r\n\r\n\'Upon my word of honour,\' declared Sambuc as he went off, \'we are going\r\nto fling him into the Meuse.\'\r\n\r\n\'And mind,\' insisted Fouchard, \'mind you fasten two big stones to his\r\nlegs so that he mayn\'t come up again.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the little _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ went off over the pale snow,\r\nvanishing into the pitchy night, unheard, save for a faint, plaintive\r\ncreaking of the barrow.\r\n\r\nEver afterwards Sambuc would swear by his father\'s memory that he had\r\nfastened the two big stones to the legs of the corpse. Nevertheless\r\nit came to the surface again, and three days later the Prussians\r\ndiscovered it among the rushes at Pont-Maugis; and their fury was\r\nextreme when they pulled out of the sack this dead spy of theirs, who\r\nhad been bled like a porker. There were terrible threats, all sorts of\r\nvexatory measures, and perquisitions. Some of the villagers no doubt\r\nlet their tongues wag too freely, for one evening a party of soldiers\r\ncame and arrested both the mayor of Remilly and old Fouchard on the\r\ncharge of keeping up an intercourse with the Francs-tireurs, to whom\r\nGoliath\'s death was naturally imputed. And in this extremity Fouchard\r\nreally cut a fine figure, exhibiting all the stubborn impassiveness of\r\nan old peasant who knows the value of silence and a calm demeanour.\r\nHe allowed himself to be marched off, without evincing the slightest\r\nuneasiness, and without even asking for any explanations. The other\r\nfolks would soon see how he would dish the Prussians. It was whispered\r\nthrough the district that he had already made a large fortune by his\r\ndealings with the enemy, bags upon bags of silver, which he had buried\r\naway somewhere, one by one, according as his profits increased.\r\n\r\nWhen Henriette heard of all this dreadful business, she felt terribly\r\nuneasy. Jean, fearing lest he might endanger those who sheltered\r\nhim, again wished to go off, though the doctor still considered him\r\ntoo weak. Henriette, however, insisted upon his remaining another\r\nfortnight; her sadness had become deeper still at the thought that\r\nbefore long their separation must become an absolute necessity. On the\r\nday of old Fouchard\'s arrest Jean had managed to escape a like fate\r\nby hiding among the forage in the barn; but was he not in danger of\r\nbeing taken and led away captive at any moment, in the event of further\r\nperquisitions, which were quite possible? Moreover, Henriette was\r\nanxious concerning her uncle\'s fate; and she resolved that she would\r\ngo to Sedan one morning to see the Delaherches, on whom, it was said, a\r\nvery influential Prussian officer was quartered.\r\n\r\n\'Silvine,\' said she, as she was about to start, \'take good care of our\r\npatient; mind you give him his broth at noon and his draught at four\r\no\'clock.\'\r\n\r\nThe servant, wholly absorbed in her daily toil, had become the same\r\ncourageous, docile girl as formerly, superintending everything at the\r\nfarm in its master\'s absence, whilst Charlot gambolled and laughed\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be uneasy, madame,\' she answered, \'he shall want for nothing.\r\nI\'m here to take good care of him.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEROR\'S SWAY--GIDDY GILBERTE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Delaherches\' house in the Rue Maqua at Sedan, life had started\r\non a new lease after the terrible shocks of the battle and the\r\ncapitulation, and for nearly four months now the days had been slowly\r\nslipping by under the gloomy, oppressive sway of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one corner of the vast factory buildings which\r\nremained closed as though untenanted; it was the room which Colonel de\r\nVineuil still occupied, a room overlooking the street at one end of the\r\nprincipal apartments. Whilst other windows were often thrown open and\r\ngave egress to sounds of coming and going, to all the buzz and stir of\r\nlife, those of this particular chamber remained condemned, dead as it\r\nwere, with their shutters invariably closed. The colonel had complained\r\nof his eyes paining him, especially when exposed to the daylight. No\r\none knew whether he told the truth or not, but to humour him a lamp was\r\nkept burning, day and night, at his bedside. Although Major Bouroche\r\nhad only found a crack in his ankle, the wound refused to heal, and\r\nall sorts of complications having ensued he had been compelled to\r\nremain in bed during two long months. He was now able to get up; but\r\nhis mental prostration remained very great, and he had been attacked\r\nby a mysterious ailment which proved so tenacious and invading that he\r\nspent his days lying upon a couch in front of a large wood fire. He\r\nwas wasting away, becoming a mere shadow; yet the doctor who attended\r\nhim and whom his condition greatly surprised could find no lesion to\r\naccount for this slow death. Such indeed it was; like the flame of a\r\nlamp whose oil is almost exhausted, the colonel was fading away.\r\n\r\nMadame Delaherche senior had shut herself up with him on the morrow of\r\nthe capitulation. Doubtless they had briefly and once for all come to\r\nan understanding as to their desire to cloister themselves together in\r\nthat room, so long as any Prussians should be billeted in the house.\r\nSeveral Germans had spent a few nights there, and a captain, Herr\r\nvon Gartlauben, was quartered there permanently. However, neither\r\nthe colonel nor the old lady had ever again spoken of these matters.\r\nShe rose every morning at daybreak, despite her eight-and-seventy\r\nyears, and came and seated herself in an armchair in front of her old\r\nfriend, on the other side of the fireplace; and there, by the steady\r\nlamp-light, she would sit knitting stockings for the children of the\r\npoor, whilst the colonel, with his eyes fixed on the embers, remained\r\nunoccupied, in a state of increasing stupor, seemingly living and\r\ndying from one and the same thought. They certainly did not exchange\r\ntwenty words a day; he silenced her with a wave of the hand whenever\r\nshe involuntarily alluded to any news from the outside world--news that\r\nshe picked up when she occasionally went about the house. And thus no\r\nfurther tidings penetrated to that chamber, no news of the siege of\r\nParis, of the defeats on the Loire, the daily renewed afflictions of\r\nthe invasion. And yet, although the colonel in his voluntary entombment\r\nrefused to look upon the light of day, although he closed his eyes and\r\nstopped his ears, it was all of no avail; some rumour of the frightful\r\ndisasters, the deadly mourning, must have stolen through chink and\r\ncrevice into the room, have been wafted to him by the very air he\r\nbreathed; for hour by hour he was as though poisoned afresh and drew\r\nnearer and nearer unto death.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the broad daylight, Delaherche, with his need of life was\r\nbestirring himself and endeavouring to reopen his factory. There was so\r\nmuch confusion, however, with regard both to workmen and customers that\r\nhe had as yet only been able to set a few looms going; and by way of\r\nemploying his gloomy, enforced leisure it had occurred to him to make a\r\ncomplete inventory of his belongings and to study certain improvements\r\nwhich he had long thought of introducing into his business. To assist\r\nhim in this work he had at his elbow a young fellow, a customer\'s\r\nson, who had stranded in his house after the battle. Edmond Lagarde,\r\nwho had grown up at Passy in his father\'s little drapery shop, and\r\nwho at three-and-twenty years of age--though he looked hardly more\r\nthan eighteen--was a sergeant in the 5th of the Line, had fought so\r\nvaliantly and stubbornly on the day of the battle that he had only\r\ncome into the town by the M\xc3\xa9nil gate at about five o\'clock, and then\r\nwith his left arm broken by one of the last bullets that the enemy\r\nhad fired. Since the other wounded had been removed from the sheds,\r\nDelaherche had good-naturedly kept the young fellow with him, so that\r\nEdmond formed one of the family, eating, sleeping, and living in the\r\nhouse, and, now that his wound was healed, acting as secretary to the\r\nmanufacturer, pending the time when he might get back to Paris. Thanks\r\nto Delaherche\'s protection and his own formal promise that he would not\r\nabscond, the Prussian authorities did not interfere with him. He was\r\nfair, with blue eyes, as pretty as a girl, and so shy and timid that he\r\nwas for ever blushing. His mother had brought him up, stinting herself\r\nand expending the profits of their little business in paying for his\r\nterms at college. He was extremely fond of Paris, which he spoke of\r\nwith passionate regretfulness, when talking with Gilberte, who had\r\nnursed this wounded Ch\xc3\xa9rubin[45] like a comrade.\r\n\r\nFinally, the house had yet another new inmate, Herr von Gartlauben, a\r\ncaptain in the Landwehr, whose regiment was now quartered at Sedan in\r\nplace of the regular troops. Despite his modest rank, the captain was\r\na personage of importance, for he was nephew to the Governor-General\r\nof Champagne whom the Germans had set up at Rheims, and who exercised\r\nunlimited power over the entire region. Herr von Gartlauben also prided\r\nhimself upon being fond of Paris, upon having lived there, and upon\r\nbeing acquainted both with its courtesies and its refinements; and\r\nindeed he affected the irreproachable bearing of a well-bred man, a\r\npolish under which he strove to conceal his natural coarseness. Tall\r\nand fat, he was always tightly buttoned up in his uniform, and lied\r\noutrageously about his age, being quite in despair that he should have\r\nalready reached five-and-forty. Had he been more intelligent he might\r\nhave proved a terrible customer, but his vanity kept him in a state\r\nof imperturbable self-satisfaction, and he was quite incapable of\r\nimagining that anybody could trifle with him.\r\n\r\nLater on, he proved a veritable saviour for Delaherche. But how doleful\r\nwere the earlier days following upon the capitulation! Overrun, peopled\r\nwith German soldiers, Sedan trembled with the fear of pillage. Then,\r\nhowever, the victorious troops streamed back to the valley of the Seine\r\nagain, only a garrison being left behind, and the town sank into the\r\ndeadly quiet of a necropolis; the houses invariably closed, the shops\r\nshut, the streets deserted as soon as the twilight fell, and from\r\nthat moment re-echoing only the heavy footsteps and hoarse calls of\r\nthe patrols. Not a newspaper, not a letter arrived. In the ignorance\r\nand anguish that prevailed respecting the fresh disasters which were\r\nfelt to be at hand, the town was like a walled-up dungeon, suddenly\r\nshut off from the rest of France. To render their misery complete\r\nthe townsfolk were threatened with a dearth of provisions; and one\r\nmorning indeed they awoke with no bread and no meat. It was as though\r\na swarm of locusts had passed that way, the whole district having been\r\nstripped bare by the hundreds of thousands of men who for a week past\r\nhad been pouring through it like a torrent. Having only two days\'\r\nprovisions left, the town had to apply to Belgium for sustenance; and\r\nnow everything came from the neighbouring country, across the open\r\nfrontier whence the customs\' service had disappeared, carried off in\r\nthe catastrophe like everything else. Then, too, there were endless\r\nvexatious measures, a struggle which began afresh every morning\r\nbetween the Prussian Commandature established at the Sub-Prefecture\r\nand the Municipal Council sitting _en permanence_ at the Town Hall.\r\nThe resistance which the members of the latter offered was heroic, but\r\nit was in vain that they argued and contested the ground inch by inch;\r\nthe inhabitants were fast succumbing beneath the enemy\'s ever-growing\r\ndemands, the fancifulness and excessive frequency of the requisitions.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier days Delaherche suffered a good deal from the\r\nsoldiers and officers who were billeted on him. Men from all the\r\nvarious German states defiled through his house smoking their big\r\npipes. Not a day passed but two or three thousand soldiers, infantry,\r\ncavalry, artillery, fell unexpectedly upon the town, and although\r\nthey were by right only entitled to shelter and firing, it was often\r\nnecessary to run about and procure provisions for them. They left the\r\nrooms which they occupied in a repulsively filthy state. The officers\r\noften came home drunk, and proved more insufferable even than their\r\nmen. Discipline, however, so restrained the foreigners, that acts\r\nof violence and pillage were of rare occurrence. In all Sedan only\r\ntwo women were reported to have been violated. It was not till later\r\non, when Paris supplied proof of its determination to resist, that\r\nthe Germans made their domination severely felt, exasperated as they\r\nwere at finding the struggle prolonged, anxious too with regard to\r\nthe demeanour of the provinces, fearing a rising _en masse_ of the\r\npopulation, and a general, wolfish warfare such as the Francs-tireurs\r\nhad already declared against them.\r\n\r\nDelaherche had just been lodging a major of cuirassiers, who slept\r\nin his boots and went away leaving his room one mass of filth, when\r\nCaptain von Gartlauben presented himself at the factory one evening in\r\nthe second fortnight of September, when the rain was pouring down like\r\na deluge. The first hour was somewhat unpleasant. The captain began\r\nbawling, demanded the best room in the house, and dragged his sabre\r\nwith a clatter up the stairs. Having caught sight of Gilberte, however,\r\nhe became decorous in his behaviour, shut himself up in his room, and\r\nin passing in and out would depart from his rigid demeanour to bow to\r\nher politely. He was treated with great deference, for it was known\r\nthat a word from him to the colonel commanding Sedan would suffice to\r\nsecure the abatement of a requisition or the release of a prisoner.\r\nHis uncle, the Governor-General at Rheims, had recently launched a\r\nferocious proclamation, decreeing not only the state of siege, but\r\nalso the penalty of death for every person shown to have assisted the\r\n\'enemy,\' whether as a spy, or by leading the German troops astray when\r\nappointed to guide them, or by destroying the bridges and cannons, or\r\nby damaging the telegraph wires and the railway lines. The \'enemy\' of\r\ncourse was the French; and the hearts of the inhabitants bounded with\r\nindignation when, on the gate of the Commandature, they read the large\r\nwhite placard, which converted their anguish and their hopes into\r\ncrimes. It was already terribly hard to be informed of the fresh German\r\nvictories by the cheers of the garrison. In this wise every day almost\r\nbrought its affliction; the soldiers would light large fires, sing, and\r\nget drunk throughout the night, whilst the inhabitants, compelled to be\r\nwithin doors by nine o\'clock, listened to the revelry from the depths\r\nof their dark houses, distracted by the uncertainty in which they\r\nwere plunged, but divining some fresh misfortune. It was on one of\r\nthese occasions, about the middle of October, that Herr von Gartlauben\r\nfor the first time gave proof of some delicacy of feeling. Since the\r\nmorning Sedan had been awakening to hope again, for there were rumours\r\nabroad of a great victory achieved by the army of the Loire on its way\r\nto relieve Paris. Ofttime already, however, the best of news had become\r\ntransformed into tidings of disaster, and in the same way it was learnt\r\nthat evening that the Bavarian army had secured possession of Orleans.\r\nSome soldiers in one of the houses of the Rue Maqua, just in front\r\nof the factory, thereupon began brawling so loudly that the captain,\r\nseeing Gilberte greatly affected, went and silenced the men, being\r\nhimself of opinion that such an uproar was uncalled for.\r\n\r\nThe month went by, and Herr von Gartlauben had occasion to render a\r\nfew more little services. The Prussian authorities had reorganised\r\nthe various governmental departments and a German sub-prefect had\r\nbeen installed at Sedan, though this did not prevent the vexatious\r\nmeasures from continuing, albeit the new functionary showed himself\r\ncomparatively reasonable. Among the many difficulties which constantly\r\narose between the Commandature and the Municipal Council, a frequent\r\ncause of trouble was the requisition of vehicles; and quite a to-do\r\narose one morning when Delaherche was unable to send his calash and\r\npair to the Sub-Prefecture. The mayor was momentarily arrested, and the\r\nmanufacturer would have been sent to keep him company in the citadel,\r\nhad it not been for Captain von Gartlauben, whose intervention at once\r\nappeased the wrath of the authorities. On another occasion, at his\r\nintercession, the town was granted a delay for the payment of a fine of\r\nthirty thousand francs imposed upon it as a punishment for its alleged\r\ndilatoriness in rebuilding the Villette bridge, a bridge destroyed\r\nby the Prussians themselves--altogether a deplorable business, which\r\nhalf ruined Sedan and turned it topsy-turvy. It was, however, more\r\nparticularly after the fall of Metz that Delaherche contracted a debt\r\nof gratitude towards the captain. The frightful tidings fell like a\r\nthunderbolt upon the inhabitants, annihilating their last hopes; and\r\nthe very next week the town was again burdened with passing troops,\r\nall the torrent of men that streamed down from Metz--Prince Frederick\r\nCharles\'s army directing its course towards the Loire, General von\r\nManteuffel\'s army marching on Amiens and Rouen, and other corps on\r\ntheir way to reinforce the besiegers around Paris. For several days\r\nthe houses were full of soldiers, the bakers\' and butchers\' shops were\r\nswept bare to the last crumb, the last bone, whilst the paving of the\r\nstreets exhaled a greasy stench such as might have followed the passage\r\nof vast migrating flocks and herds. The factory in the Rue Maqua alone\r\ndid not suffer from this irruption of human cattle, protected as it\r\nwas by a friendly hand, and required to shelter merely a few well-bred\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIt thus happened that Delaherche ended by departing from his frosty\r\ndemeanour. The middle-class families of the town had shut themselves\r\nup in their most remote rooms, avoiding all intercourse with the\r\nofficers quartered upon them. But with his irrepressible longing to\r\ntalk, please, and enjoy life, this part of the antagonist sulking after\r\ndefeat caused the manufacturer intense suffering. His large bleak,\r\nsilent, house, whose inmates lived apart from one another, swayed by\r\nunbending rancour, made him feel quite miserable. And so one day he\r\nbegan by stopping Herr von Gartlauben on the stairs to thank him for\r\nthe services he had rendered. Then, little by little, they fell into\r\nthe habit of exchanging a few words whenever they met; and at last\r\nthe Prussian captain found himself one evening in the manufacturer\'s\r\nprivate room, smoking a cigar and chatting in friendly fashion, whilst\r\ncomfortably seated beside the fireplace, where some large oak logs were\r\nburning. Gilberte did not show herself during the first fortnight,\r\nand the captain pretended to be ignorant of her very existence,\r\nalthough at the slightest sound he would at once glance towards the\r\ndoor of the adjoining room. He seemed desirous of making his host\r\nforget that he was one of the conquerors, showed himself unprejudiced\r\nand liberal-minded, and was always ready to laugh and jest whenever\r\nthe conversation turned on any ridiculous requisitions. One day, for\r\ninstance, when a demand had been made for a coffin and a bandage,\r\nthis bandage and coffin vastly amused him. With regard to other\r\nthings, coal, oil, milk, sugar, butter, bread, meat, to say nothing of\r\nclothing, stoves, and lamps--in a word all the necessaries of daily\r\nlife, he simply shrugged his shoulders: What would you have? These\r\ndemands were vexatious, no doubt, and he even admitted that they were\r\nexcessive; but then this was wartime and the troops must needs live in\r\nthe occupied territory. Delaherche, whom the incessant requisitions\r\nexasperated, spoke out frankly concerning them, passing them in review\r\nevery evening, in much the same way as he might have gone through his\r\nhousehold accounts. Still they only had one lively discussion together,\r\nwhich was in reference to a fine of a million francs which the Prussian\r\nprefect of Rethel had levied upon the department of the Ardennes under\r\npretence of compensating Germany for the losses she was alleged to\r\nhave sustained by the operations of the French fleet and the expulsion\r\nof the German subjects resident in France. Of this amount Sedan was\r\nrequired to contribute 42,000 francs, and Delaherche did his utmost\r\nto make his lodger understand that this was an iniquitous demand, the\r\ntown being differently circumstanced to others, since it had already\r\nundergone such excessive suffering. The result of all these discussions\r\nwas to increase the intimacy of the two men; the manufacturer, on his\r\nside, was delighted at having been able to shake off his thoughts by\r\npouring forth a flood of words, whilst the Prussian was pleased with\r\nhimself for having given proof of a truly Parisian urbanity.\r\n\r\nOne evening Gilberte came into the room with her gay giddy air, and\r\nat sight of the captain stopped short, affecting surprise. Herr von\r\nGartlauben rose from his chair, and with commendable tact withdrew\r\nalmost immediately. But on the following day he found Gilberte already\r\ninstalled in the room, and thereupon settled himself in his usual seat\r\nby the fireside. Some delightful evenings followed, invariably spent in\r\nthis private room instead of in the drawing-room, wherein lay a nice\r\ndistinction with regard to the character of the intercourse. Later on\r\neven, when the young woman had consented to play the piano to gratify\r\nthe captain, who was extremely fond of music, she alone would step\r\ninto the adjoining _salon_, leaving the door open. During those bitter\r\nwinter evenings the old oaks of the Ardennes crackled and blazed in the\r\nlofty fireplace, and about ten o\'clock they would drink a cup of tea,\r\nwhilst chatting together in the warm atmosphere of that cosy room. And,\r\nplainly enough, Herr von Gartlauben had fallen head over heels in love\r\nwith that sprightly young woman, who flirted with him just as in days\r\ngone by she had flirted with Captain Beaudoin\'s friends at Charleville.\r\nHe now took additional care of his person, displayed exaggerated\r\ngallantry, and contented himself with the slightest favour, above all\r\nthings anxious that he might not be taken for a barbarian--one of those\r\ngross-minded soldiers who cannot treat a woman with respect.\r\n\r\nThus life had, so to say, a double aspect in that vast, black house\r\nof the Rue Maqua. Whilst Edmond, the wounded Ch\xc3\xa9rubin with the pretty\r\nface, returned monosyllabic answers to Delaherche\'s ceaseless chatter\r\nat meal-time, and blushed like a hobbledehoy if Gilberte merely asked\r\nhim to pass the salt; whilst Herr von Gartlauben, with enraptured eyes,\r\nsat in the study of an evening listening to one of Mozart\'s sonatas,\r\nwhich the young woman was playing for his especial benefit in the\r\ndrawing-room, the adjacent apartment, where Colonel de Vineuil and\r\nMadame Delaherche senior spent their time, remained quite silent, with\r\nthe shutters always closed, the lamp always burning, as though it were\r\na tomb lighted by a taper. December had buried Sedan under the snow,\r\nand the despair-fraught tidings from the scene of war were as though\r\nstifled by the bitter cold. After General Ducrot\'s defeat at Champigny,\r\nafter the loss of Orleans, there remained but one sombre hope, that the\r\nsoil of France might become an avenging soil, an exterminating soil\r\nto devour and swallow up the victors. Ah! that the snow might fall\r\nin thicker and thicker flakes, that the ground might rend and open\r\nunder the biting frost, so that the whole of Germany might be entombed\r\nwithin it! And now a fresh sorrow was wringing old Madame Delaherche\'s\r\nheart. Whilst passing Gilberte\'s door one night when her son was from\r\nhome, called away to Belgium by some business matter or other, she had\r\nheard a low murmur of voices, mingled with suppressed laughter. She\r\nstaggered back into her own room, quite aghast, overcome by the horror\r\nof the abominable thing which she suspected. The voice she had heard\r\ncould have been none other than the Prussian\'s; she had already fancied\r\nthat she had detected glances of intelligence passing between him and\r\nGilberte, and the thought of this supreme shame utterly overwhelmed\r\nher. Ah! that woman whom her son had brought into the house despite\r\nall her remonstrances, that abandoned woman whom she had already\r\npardoned once by not speaking out after Captain Beaudoin\'s death! Yet\r\nit was all certainly beginning again, and this time the infamy was\r\nunparalleled! What should she do? Such monstrous behaviour could not\r\nbe allowed to continue. The seclusion in which the old lady lived now\r\nbecame fraught with more poignant sorrow, and she spent long days in\r\nwaging a frightful combat with herself. She would enter the colonel\'s\r\nroom looking yet more gloomy than had been her wont, and sit there for\r\nhours in silence, with tears in her eyes; and he would gaze at her and\r\ninterpret her increased sadness as signifying that France had sustained\r\nyet another defeat.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this crisis that Henriette arrived one\r\nmorning at the house in the Rue Maqua with the view of enlisting the\r\nDelaherches\' sympathies in favour of uncle Fouchard. She had heard\r\npeople speak smilingly of Gilberte\'s all-powerful influence over\r\nCaptain von Gartlauben, and consequently felt somewhat embarrassed when\r\non ascending the stairs she encountered Madame Delaherche senior, who\r\nwas returning to the colonel\'s room. However, she deemed it advisable\r\nto acquaint the old lady with the object of her visit.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! madame,\' said she, \'if you would only be kind enough to assist\r\nme! My uncle is in a terrible position; they talk of sending him to\r\nGermany.\'\r\n\r\nMuch as the old lady liked Henriette, she could not restrain an angry\r\ngesture: \'But I am powerless to help you, my dear child. It is of\r\nno use applying to me.\' And then, despite the young woman\'s evident\r\ndistress, she added: \'Your visit is very ill-timed; my son is going to\r\nBrussels this evening. Besides, he has no more influence than I have.\r\nApply to my daughter-in-law, she can do everything.\'\r\n\r\nThen off she went, leaving Henriette thunderstruck, fully convinced\r\nthat she was falling into the midst of a family drama. On the previous\r\nevening, indeed, Madame Delaherche senior had resolved to communicate\r\nher suspicions to her son before his departure for Belgium, whither\r\nhe was going to negotiate a large purchase of coal, in the hope of\r\nbeing able to start his power-looms again. She would never allow that\r\nabominable intrigue to be carried on during his absence, under the same\r\nroof as herself. And before speaking out she only wished to make quite\r\ncertain that he would not again defer his departure as he had been\r\ndoing, day after day, during an entire week. The course she proposed\r\nto take meant, she realised it, the downfall of the entire house, the\r\nPrussian driven away, the young woman also thrown into the street and\r\nher name ignominiously placarded on the walls, as had been threatened\r\nwould be done with regard to every Frenchwoman who might yield to the\r\nadvances of a German.\r\n\r\nWhen Gilberte perceived Henriette she gave a cry of delight. \'Ah! how\r\nglad I am to see you! It seems so long since you went away, and all\r\nthese dreadful things make one feel so old!\'\r\n\r\nShe led her into her room, made her sit down on a couch there and\r\nensconced herself close beside her: \'Come, you must breakfast with us,\'\r\nshe said. \'But first of all let us have a chat together. You must have\r\nso many things to tell me? I know that you have had no news of your\r\nbrother. Poor Maurice! how I pity him, shut up in Paris like that,\r\nwith no gas, no wood, and perhaps no bread! And that soldier, too,\r\nyour brother\'s friend, whom you are nursing? You see that people have\r\nalready been chattering to me. Is it on his account you\'ve come?\'\r\n\r\nGreatly perturbed, Henriette did not at first answer her friend. After\r\nall, was it not really on Jean\'s account that she had come there, to\r\nmake certain indeed that her dear patient would not be molested when\r\nher uncle had been set at liberty? To hear Gilberte speak of him,\r\nhowever, had filled her with confusion, and she no longer dared to\r\nreveal the true motive of her visit; her conscience pricked her--she\r\nrecoiled from the thought of enlisting in Jean\'s behalf such an\r\nequivocal influence as that with which she credited Gilberte. \'And so,\'\r\nrepeated the latter, with a malicious air, \'it\'s for that soldier that\r\nyou need our assistance?\' Then as Henriette, brought to bay, at last\r\nbegan speaking of old Fouchard\'s arrest, she promptly interrupted her:\r\n\'Oh! yes--how foolish of me to have forgotten; why I was talking of the\r\nmatter only this morning. You have done well to come, my dear; your\r\nuncle\'s case must be seen to at once, for the last information that I\r\nhave had is not at all favourable. They wish to make an example.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I thought of you,\' continued Henriette in a hesitating way. \'I\r\nthought that you might give me some good advice, perhaps be able to\r\nintercede----\'\r\n\r\nGilberte burst out laughing: \'Why, you silly, I\'ll have your uncle set\r\nat liberty within three days! Haven\'t you heard that I have a Prussian\r\ncaptain quartered here who does whatever I ask? You hear, my dear, he\r\ncan refuse me nothing!\'\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon, like a madcap enjoying the triumph of her coquetry,\r\nshe laughed louder than ever, holding and patting the hands of her\r\nfriend, who could not utter a word of thanks, so disturbed she was, so\r\ntormented by the fear that Gilberte\'s words might be intended as an\r\navowal. And yet how serene and blithe the young woman appeared!\r\n\r\n\'Let me attend to it all,\' added Gilberte. \'I\'ll send you home happy\r\nthis evening.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the dining-room Henriette was greatly struck by the\r\ndelicate feminine beauty of Edmond, whom she had never previously seen.\r\nHe enchanted her, as one is enchanted by the sight of a pretty object.\r\nWas it possible that this lad had really fought, and that the Germans\r\nhad been so cruel as to break his arm? The legend of his great bravery\r\nrendered him all the more charming, and, whilst the servant was serving\r\nmutton chops and baked potatoes, Delaherche, who had given Henriette\r\nthe cordial greeting of a man to whom the sight of a new face is a\r\ngodsend, did not cease praising his secretary; Edmond, said he, had\r\nproved as industrious and well-behaved as he was handsome. And thus\r\nthe repast in the warm spacious dining-room promptly took a turn of\r\ndelightful intimacy.\r\n\r\n\'And so you came over with a view of enlisting our services in father\r\nFouchard\'s case?\' resumed the manufacturer. \'I\'m sorry that I\'m obliged\r\nto go away this evening. But my wife will settle the matter for you;\r\nshe\'s irresistible; she has only to ask for a thing to get it.\' He said\r\nthis laughing, in all simplicity, as though flattered that Gilberte\r\nshould possess such influence, which he was at times vain enough to\r\nascribe to himself. Then, all at once, he asked: \'By the way, my dear,\r\nhas Edmond told you of his discovery?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; what discovery?\' asked Gilberte gaily, turning her beautiful\r\ncaressing eyes upon the young sergeant.\r\n\r\nThe latter blushed as was his wont whenever a pretty woman looked at\r\nhim: \'Oh! madame, it\'s merely a question of some old lace. You were\r\nregretting the other day that you had none to trim your mauve wrapper\r\nwith, and I was lucky enough yesterday to come upon five yards of old\r\nBruges, something really handsome and cheap as well. The dealer is\r\ncoming to show it to you by-and-by.\'\r\n\r\nShe was delighted. \'How nice of you!\' said she; \'you deserve a reward.\'\r\n\r\nThen, whilst a _terrine_ of _foie-gras_, purchased in Belgium, was\r\nbeing served, the conversation took another turn; some allusion was\r\nmade to the fish which were dying in the Meuse, poisoned by the\r\ncorrupt state of the water; and Delaherche then spoke of the danger\r\nof pestilence to which Sedan would be exposed as soon as there should\r\nbe a thaw. There, had been several cases of disease of an epidemical\r\ncharacter already in November. Six thousand francs had been spent\r\nin cleansing the town after the battle; the knapsacks, cartridge\r\npouches, in fact all the suspicious wreckage that could be found had\r\nbeen burnt in heaps, but as soon as the weather became at all damp the\r\nmost abominable stenches were wafted from the surrounding country-side,\r\nwhere such a multitude of corpses had been half-buried, with merely a\r\nfew inches of earth thrown over them. Many of the fields were quite\r\nbumpy with graves, and an internal pressure cracked and split the soil\r\nwhence all the gases of putrefaction issued and spread around. And only\r\na few days previously another source of infection had been discovered\r\nin the Meuse, although the carcases of more than twelve hundred horses\r\nhad already been removed from it. It had been generally believed that\r\nnot a corpse remained in the river, but, one day, on gazing into it\r\nattentively, at a point where it was only six or seven feet deep, a\r\nrural guard espied some whitish objects which he at first took for\r\nstones. They proved, however, to be corpses, corpses in layers, bodies\r\nwhich had been ripped open and which, as inflation was impossible,\r\nhad not risen to the surface. They had therefore been lying among the\r\nherbage in that water during nearly four months. Arms, legs, and heads\r\nwere brought up with boat-hooks; and at times the mere strength of the\r\ncurrent would suffice to detach a hand. The water became turbid, and\r\nbig bubbles of gas rose to the surface and burst, poisoning the air\r\naround with a disgusting stench.\r\n\r\n\'It will be all right so long as it freezes,\' observed Delaherche. \'But\r\nas soon as the snow disappears there will have to be a thorough search\r\nand cleansing, or else we shall all be carried off.\' Then, upon his\r\nwife begging him with a laugh to talk of some less unpleasant subject\r\nat table, he concluded with the remark: \'Well, we shall have to do\r\nwithout fish from the Meuse for a long time.\'\r\n\r\nThey had finished their meal, and the coffee was being served, when the\r\nmaid announced that Herr von Gartlauben requested permission to see\r\nthem for a moment. This caused quite a flutter, for the captain had\r\nnever previously presented himself at that hour of the day. Delaherche,\r\nhowever, deemed the circumstance a fortunate one, since it would enable\r\nhim to introduce Henriette to the Prussian officer, and accordingly\r\ngave orders to admit him. On perceiving a second young woman in the\r\nroom, the captain exaggerated his already excessive politeness. He even\r\naccepted a cup of coffee, which he drank without sugar, not because he\r\nliked it unsweetened, but because he had sometimes seen people drink\r\nit in this fashion in Paris. It appeared, moreover, that if he had so\r\npressingly solicited admission it was simply from his desire to lose\r\nno time in informing Madame that he had just secured a pardon for one\r\nof her _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_, an unlucky workman employed at the factory, who had\r\nbeen imprisoned in consequence of a scuffle with a Prussian soldier.\r\n\r\nGilberte at once profited by the opportunity to speak about father\r\nFouchard\'s case: \'Captain,\' said she, \'I present you one of my dearest\r\nfriends. She desires to place herself under your protection; she is the\r\nniece of the farmer who was recently arrested at Remilly, as you know,\r\nin connection with that Franc-tireur affair.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! yes, the affair of the spy, the unfortunate fellow who was found\r\nin a sack. Oh! it\'s a serious matter, very serious indeed! I am afraid\r\nI can do nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! you would please me so much!\' said Gilberte, looking at him with\r\nher caressing eyes and thrilling him with a sensation of beatitude.\r\nThen he bowed to her with an air of gallant compliance. Whatever she\r\nmight desire, he was at her orders.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be very grateful to you, sir,\' said Henriette painfully,\r\nseized as she was with an insurmountable feeling of discomfort, at the\r\nsudden thought of her husband, her poor Weiss, shot over yonder at\r\nBazeilles.\r\n\r\nHowever, Edmond, who had discreetly taken himself off on the arrival of\r\nthe captain, had just returned into the room to whisper a few words in\r\nGilberte\'s ear. She rose in a vivacious way, mentioned the lace which\r\nthe dealer had just brought, and after apologising for leaving them,\r\nfollowed the young fellow out of the room. Left alone with the two\r\nmen, Henriette was now able to isolate herself, and took a seat in the\r\nembrasure of a window, whilst they remained at table, talking in loud\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\'You will accept a nip of brandy, captain, eh? You see I don\'t stand\r\non ceremony with you. I tell you all I think because I am aware that\r\nyou have a liberal mind. Well! I assure you that it is very wrong of\r\nyour prefect to bleed the town of those forty-two thousand francs. Just\r\nthink of all our sacrifices since the outset! In the first place, on\r\nthe eve of the battle, the entire French army, exhausted and famished,\r\nfell on our hands. Then came your men, and they had long teeth too.\r\nMerely the troops that have passed through the place, the requisitions,\r\nthe damage which had to be repaired, the needful expenses of all\r\nkinds, have cost us a million and a half of francs. We may put down\r\nas much for the havoc wrought by the battle, the destruction caused\r\nby your artillery fire and the conflagrations, and that will bring us\r\nto three millions. Then I estimate that the losses sustained by local\r\ntrade and industry amount to quite two millions. What do you say to\r\nthat? There we have a total of five millions of francs for a town of\r\nthirteen thousand inhabitants! And now under some pretext or other you\r\nask us for a further contribution of forty-two thousand francs. Come,\r\nis it reasonable, is it just?\'\r\n\r\nHerr von Gartlauben nodded his head and contented himself with\r\nanswering: \'What can you expect? Such is war, such is war!\'\r\n\r\nThe spell of waiting continued, Gilberte did not return, and\r\nHenriette\'s ears were ringing; all kinds of vague, sad thoughts were\r\nrendering her drowsy, as she sat there in the embrasure of the window,\r\nwhilst Delaherche declared upon his word of honour that Sedan could\r\nnever have weathered the crisis, caused by the absolute dearth of\r\nspecie, had it not been for the timely creation of a local fiduciary\r\ncurrency--the paper-money issued by the Caisse du Cr\xc3\xa9dit Industriel,\r\nwhich had saved the town from a financial disaster.\r\n\r\n\'You will take another drop of brandy, captain, eh?\' he added: and\r\nthen passing to another subject: \'Ah! it wasn\'t France that declared\r\nthe war, it was the Empire. The Emperor greatly deceived me. He is\r\naltogether done for; we would rather let ourselves be dismembered than\r\ntake him back. There was only one man who saw clearly into things last\r\nJuly, and that was Monsieur Thiers, whose journey just now through the\r\ncapitals of Europe is another great act of wisdom and patriotism. The\r\nhopes of all reasonable people accompany him--may he succeed!\'\r\n\r\nWith a wave of the hand he sought to convey his meaning, for he would\r\nhave deemed it altogether unseemly to speak of his desire for peace\r\nbefore a Prussian, however friendly the latter might be. Such a desire\r\nwas, however, strong within him, as it was in all the old conservative\r\nand _pl\xc3\xa9biscite_-voting _bourgeoisie_. They would soon be at an end\r\nof their blood and treasure; it was necessary to give in; and such\r\nbeing the opinion, there arose from all the occupied provinces a\r\ncovert rancour against Paris for resisting so stubbornly. And in this\r\nwise Delaherche, alluding to Gambetta\'s fiery proclamations, added\r\nin a lower voice: \'No, no; we cannot be on the side of the furious\r\nmadmen![46] It\'s becoming a massacre--I for my part side with Monsieur\r\nThiers, who wishes the elections to take place. As for their Republic,\r\nwell, that doesn\'t inconvenience me; we\'ll keep it if necessary, till\r\nwe get something better.\'\r\n\r\nWith extreme politeness, Herr von Gartlauben continued wagging his head\r\nin an approving way, and repeating: \'No doubt, no doubt.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette, whose discomfort had increased, felt unable to remain there\r\nany longer. She experienced a kind of irritation, for which she could\r\nassign no definite reason, a pressing desire to find herself elsewhere;\r\nand so she at last quietly rose from her seat, and left the room in\r\nsearch of Gilberte, whose return had been so long delayed. And she was\r\nstupefied when she found her friend lying on a sofa in tears, a prey\r\nto poignant and unaccountable emotion. \'What is the matter? What has\r\nhappened to you?\' asked Henriette.\r\n\r\nBut the young woman\'s tears only fell the faster, and she would not\r\nspeak; such was her confusion, moreover, that it seemed as though all\r\nthe blood in her heart had rushed to her cheeks. At last, however,\r\nthrowing herself into Henriette\'s outstretched arms, hiding her face\r\nagainst her friend\'s bosom, she stammered: \'Oh! my darling, if you only\r\nknew--I shall never dare to tell you--and yet I have no one but you;\r\nyou alone can perhaps tell me what is best to do.\' She shuddered and\r\nstammered yet more violently: \'I was here with Edmond. And then, just\r\nthis minute, the old lady came in and caught me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Caught you? What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he had his arm round my waist and was kissing me.\' And then,\r\nembracing Henriette, clasping her convulsively in her trembling arms,\r\nshe told her all. \'Oh, my darling! don\'t judge me too severely, it\r\nwould be more than I could bear. I know I promised you it should never\r\nhappen again, but you have seen Edmond--you know how brave he is and\r\nhow good-looking--as pretty as a girl. Besides, think of it, the poor\r\nyoung fellow; wounded, ill, so far away from his mother, too! And\r\nthen he has never had any money to spend on enjoyment: as it was, his\r\nparents had to stint themselves to give him an education. I assure you,\r\nI could not find it in my heart to be harsh with him.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette listened dumbfounded, unable to recover from her amazement.\r\n\'But, my dear,\' she said at last, \'everybody thinks it is the Prussian\r\ncaptain who has succeeded in pleasing you.\'\r\n\r\nAt this Gilberte sprang to her feet, and, wiping her eyes, broke out\r\ninto protestations: \'The Prussian! Oh, dear no, indeed! He\'s frightful;\r\nhe\'s hateful to me! What can people take me for? How can anyone think\r\nme capable of such infamy? No, no, never; I would rather die!\'\r\n\r\nHer feeling of revolt had rendered her quite grave, imparting a pained,\r\nirritated expression to her beauty which quite transfigured her. But\r\nall at once her coquettish gaiety, her thoughtless giddiness, came back\r\nwith a laugh which she was unable to repress: \'Well, it\'s true I amuse\r\nmyself with him. He adores me, you know, and I merely have to look at\r\nhim to make him obey me. If you only knew how amusing it is to make\r\ngame of that big fat fellow, who always seems to fancy that he is about\r\nto be rewarded for his attentions.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s a very dangerous game to play,\' said Henriette, seriously.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think so? Why, what risk do I run? When it dawns upon him that\r\nI have merely been trifling with him, he will be unable to do anything\r\nbeyond flying into a passion and taking himself off. And, besides, he\r\nwill never realise it! You don\'t know the man, my dear; he\'s one of\r\nthose creatures whom women can flirt with as far as they like without\r\nany fear of danger. I know it intuitively. He is far too vain; he will\r\nnever admit that I have trifled with him. And all that he will get from\r\nme will be permission to carry off my souvenir, with the consolation\r\nof thinking that he has done the proper thing and behaved himself like\r\na well-bred man who long resided in Paris.\' She was getting quite\r\ngay again, and added: \'Meantime he will have father Fouchard set at\r\nliberty, and his only reward for doing so will be a cup of tea from my\r\nhands.\'\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, her fears returned to her, and fresh tears\r\ngathered in her eyes. \'And the old lady; good heavens! What will\r\nhappen? She is not at all fond of me, and she is capable of telling the\r\nwhole story to my husband.\'\r\n\r\nHenriette had at last recovered her self-possession. Wiping Gilberte\'s\r\neyes, she said; \'Listen, my dear, I haven\'t the strength to scold you,\r\nand yet you know how I blame such conduct. But people had frightened\r\nme so terribly about your Prussian, I feared such horrid things,\r\nthat this flirtation with the young sergeant comes as a relief. Quiet\r\nyourself, everything may be set right.\'\r\n\r\nThis was sensible advice, the more so as Delaherche almost immediately\r\ncame in with his mother, and explained that, having made up his mind\r\nto take the train to Brussels that same evening, he had just sent for\r\nthe vehicle which was to convey him across the Belgian frontier. He\r\nhad therefore come to bid his wife good-bye. Then, turning towards\r\nHenriette, he added: \'You may be at rest. On leaving me just now,\r\nthe captain promised me that he would attend to that matter of\r\nyour uncle\'s, and whilst I am away my wife will do whatever may be\r\nnecessary.\'\r\n\r\nSince Madame Delaherche senior had entered the room Gilberte, with her\r\nheart oppressed, had not taken her eyes off her. Did she mean to speak\r\nout and tell what she had seen and thus prevent her son from starting?\r\nOn her side the old lady had fixed her eyes upon her daughter-in-law\r\nfrom the moment she had crossed the threshold. However, she remained\r\nsilent, experiencing perhaps a relief akin to that which Henriette had\r\nfelt. Since it was that young Frenchman who had fought so bravely,\r\nought she not to forgive as she had already forgiven, in the case of\r\nCaptain Beaudoin? Her eyes softened, and she averted her head. Her\r\nson might go; if need were, Edmond would protect Gilberte against the\r\nPrussian. And at this thought she even indulged in a faint smile,\r\nshe whose stern features had not once relaxed since the good news of\r\nCoulmiers.[47]\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye,\' she said, embracing Delaherche; \'settle your business and\r\nmake haste back.\'\r\n\r\nThen she retired, slowly betaking herself to the prison-like room\r\nacross the landing, where the colonel, ever with the same expression of\r\nstupor on his face, was gazing into the dimness which surrounded the\r\ncircle of pale light falling from the lamp.\r\n\r\nHenriette went back to Remilly that same evening, and three days later,\r\nin the morning, she was delighted to see old Fouchard walk into the\r\nfarm, as calmly as though he had merely come back from driving some\r\nbargain in the neighbourhood. He sat down and ate some bread and\r\ncheese. And to all the questions that he was plied with, he responded\r\nin a calm, deliberate way like a man who had never felt in the least\r\ndegree uneasy respecting the issue of his affair. Why should they\r\nhave kept him prisoner? He had done nothing wrong. It wasn\'t he who\r\nhad killed the Prussian spy, was it? So he had contented himself with\r\nsaying to the authorities; \'Find out all about it if you can, but for\r\nmy part I know nothing.\' And they had been obliged to release him, and\r\nthe mayor as well, since they had no proofs against either of them.\r\nBut at the same time, cunning, scoffing peasant that he was, his eyes\r\ntwinkled with inward merriment, in his mute delight at having got the\r\nbetter of those dirty scamps, of whom he was growing quite sick and\r\ntired now that they had begun cavilling about the quality of his meat.\r\n\r\nDecember was drawing to an end, and Jean insisted on leaving. His leg\r\nwas now firm and strong again, and the doctor declared that he might go\r\nand fight. For Henriette this was a source of great affliction, which\r\nshe strove to hide. They had had no news of Paris since the disastrous\r\nbattle of Champigny. They simply knew that Maurice\'s regiment, exposed\r\nto a murderous fire, had on that occasion lost many men. There was\r\never the same unbroken silence on his part; no letter, not a line\r\nreached them, although they knew that some families of Raucourt and\r\nSedan had received messages by circuitous routes. Perhaps the pigeon\r\nbearing the tidings which they so ardently longed for had encountered\r\nsome voracious hawk, or had fallen on the verge of a wood, killed by a\r\nPrussian bullet. Above everything else, however, they were haunted by\r\nthe fear that Maurice might be dead. In their case the silence of the\r\ngreat city over yonder, mute in the grip of the investment, had become\r\nlike the silence of the tomb. They had now lost all hope of tidings,\r\nand so, when Jean expressed his formal desire to be gone, Henriette\r\ngave utterance to a stifled plaint: \'My God, so it is all over, I shall\r\nbe entirely alone!\'\r\n\r\nJean\'s desire was to join the Army of the North, which General\r\nFaidherbe had lately reformed. This army was defending three\r\ndepartments, the Nord, the Pas-de-Calais, and the Somme, which had\r\nbecome separated from the rest of France since General von Manteuffel\'s\r\ncorps had pushed forward to Dieppe; and Jean\'s plan, susceptible of\r\neasy accomplishment, was to make his way to Bouillon, and pass round by\r\nway of Belgium. He knew that the formation of the Twenty-third Army\r\nCorps was being completed by gathering together all the old soldiers\r\nof Sedan and Metz that could be found. He had heard it reported also\r\nthat General Faidherbe was resuming the offensive, and when he read of\r\nthe engagement of Pont-Noyelle[48]--that drawn battle which the French\r\nalmost won--he definitely fixed his departure for the ensuing Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was again in this instance Dr. Dalichamp who offered his gig and his\r\nservices as driver, so that Jean might get more easily to Bouillon. The\r\ndoctor\'s courage and goodness of heart were inexhaustible. At Raucourt,\r\nwhose inhabitants were being decimated by typhus, brought there by\r\nthe Bavarians, he had patients in almost every house, in addition to\r\nthose in the two ambulances which he attended, that of Raucourt itself\r\nand that of Remilly. His ardent patriotism, the impulse which always\r\nprompted him to protest against all needless violence, had twice led\r\nto his arrest by the Prussians, who had, however, promptly set him at\r\nliberty again. And he was laughing with genuine satisfaction on the\r\nmorning when he arrived in his trap to drive Jean away, delighted,\r\nindeed, at being able to facilitate the escape of another of those\r\nvanquished soldiers of Sedan, those poor brave fellows whom he tended\r\nwith all his professional skill and assisted with his purse. Jean, whom\r\nthe pecuniary question greatly worried, for he knew very well that\r\nHenriette was by no means rich, had readily accepted the fifty francs\r\noffered him by the doctor to defray the expenses of his journey.\r\n\r\nOld Fouchard behaved handsomely at the leave-taking. He sent Silvine\r\nto the cellar for two bottles of wine, desiring that everyone should\r\ndrain a glass to the extermination of the Germans. He was henceforth a\r\nwell-to-do man, with his \'pile\' securely hidden away somewhere; and,\r\neasy in mind since the Francs-tireurs of the Dieulet Woods, tracked\r\nlike wild beasts, had disappeared from the neighbourhood, he now had\r\nbut one desire, that of enjoying the approaching peace as soon as it\r\nshould be concluded. In a fit of generosity, moreover, he had even\r\ngiven wages to Prosper, by way of attaching him to the farm, which the\r\nyoung man, however, had no desire to leave. And Fouchard not merely\r\nchinked glasses with Prosper, but also with Silvine, whom he had at\r\none moment thought of marrying, so well behaved and so intent on her\r\nwork did he now find her. But what use would it be? He divined that\r\nshe would never go astray again, that she would still be there when\r\nCharlot had grown up and in his turn went for a soldier. And when he\r\nhad chinked glasses with the doctor, with Henriette and with Jean, the\r\nold fellow exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'There! To everybody\'s health, and may everybody prosper and feel no\r\nworse than I do!\'\r\n\r\nHenriette had insisted upon accompanying Jean as far as Sedan. He was\r\ndressed for the occasion in civilian attire, wearing an overcoat and\r\nlow hat which the doctor had lent him. The sun shone brightly over the\r\nsnow that morning, although it was terribly cold. Their intention had\r\nbeen to drive through the town without stopping, but when Jean learnt\r\nthat his colonel was still staying with the Delaherches, he felt a\r\nstrong desire to go and pay his respects to him, and at the same time\r\nthank the manufacturer for his kindness. A final grief awaited him,\r\nhowever, in that town of disaster and affliction. When they reached the\r\nfactory in the Rue Maqua, they found the house turned topsy-turvy by a\r\ntragic occurrence. Gilberte was in a state of wild grief; old Madame\r\nDelaherche was weeping big silent tears, and her son, who had come up\r\nfrom his loom-shops, where work had in some measure been resumed, was\r\ngiving vent to exclamations of surprise. The colonel had just been\r\nfound dead, lying all of a heap upon the floor of his room, where that\r\neternal lamp was still burning. A doctor, summoned in all haste, had\r\nbeen unable to understand the case, finding no probable cause, neither\r\nheart-trouble nor congestion, to which he could ascribe this sudden\r\ndeath. M. de Vineuil had expired thunderstruck as it were, though none\r\ncould tell whence the bolt had fallen. And it was only on the morrow\r\nthat a fragment of an old newspaper was picked up in the room, a scrap\r\nwhich had served to cover a book, and which contained an account of the\r\nsurrender of Metz!\r\n\r\n\'My dear,\' said Gilberte to Henriette, \'just now when Captain\r\nGartlauben came down stairs, he uncovered as he passed the door of\r\nthe room where my uncle\'s body is lying--Edmond saw him do so--he is\r\ncertainly a well-bred man, isn\'t he?\'\r\n\r\nJean had never yet embraced Henriette. Before getting into the gig\r\nagain with the doctor, he wished to thank her for all her care and\r\nkindness, for having nursed and loved him like a brother. But he could\r\nnot find the words he sought, and suddenly opening his arms he kissed\r\nher, sobbing. Quite distracted, she returned his kiss. And when the\r\nhorse started off the corporal turned round and they waved their\r\nhands to one another whilst repeating in faltering accents, \'Good-bye,\r\ngood-bye!\'\r\n\r\nThat night, Henriette, who had returned to Remilly, was on duty at the\r\nambulance. During her long vigil she was again seized with a bitter\r\naccess of tears, and she wept--wept exceedingly, stifling her sorrow\r\nbetween her clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINSIDE PARIS: SIEGE AND COMMUNE--THE BARRICADES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving overthrown the Empire at Sedan, the two German armies again\r\nbegan rolling their waves of men towards Paris, the army of the\r\nMeuse approaching the capital on its northern side by the valley of\r\nthe Marne, whilst the army of the Crown Prince of Prussia, after\r\ncrossing the Seine at Villeneuve-St. Georges, directed its course\r\ntowards Versailles, skirting the city upon the south. And on that warm\r\nSeptember morning, when General Ducrot, to whom the barely formed\r\nFourteenth Army Corps had been confided, resolved to attack the second\r\nof the hostile armies on its flank march, Maurice, who was camping with\r\nhis new regiment, the 115th of the Line, in the woods on the left of\r\nMeudon, only received orders to march when the disaster was already\r\na certainty. A few shells had sufficed; a frightful panic had broken\r\nout among a battalion of newly recruited Zouaves, and the rest of the\r\ntroops had been carried off in such helter-skelter fashion that the\r\ngallop of retreat did not cease till the men were behind the ramparts\r\nof Paris, where the alarm was intense. All the positions in advance of\r\nthe southern forts were lost; and that evening the last link connecting\r\nthe city with France, the telegraph wire of the Western Railway line,\r\nwas severed. Paris was cut off from the world.\r\n\r\nIt was a frightfully sad evening for Maurice. Had the Prussians been\r\nmore enterprising they might have camped that night on the Place du\r\nCarrousel. But they were extremely prudent folks, and had resolved\r\nto conduct the siege in the classical manner. The exact lines of the\r\ninvestment had already been settled--the cordon of the army of the\r\nMeuse on the north, from Croissy to the Marne, by way of Epinay; and\r\nthe cordon of the Crown Prince of Prussia\'s army on the south, from\r\nChennevi\xc3\xa8res to Ch\xc3\xa2tillon and Bougival; whilst general headquarters\r\nwith King William, Count von Bismarck, and General von Moltke,\r\nexercised authority from Versailles. The gigantic blockade, which folks\r\nhad refused to believe in, was already an accomplished fact. The city,\r\nwith its bastioned _enceinte_ upwards of twenty miles in circumference,\r\nits fifteen forts and six detached redoubts, found itself, as it were,\r\nimprisoned. And the army of the defence was only composed of the\r\nThirteenth Corps, which General Vinoy had saved and brought back to\r\nthe capital, and the Fourteenth, still in progress of formation, and\r\nconfided to General Ducrot--the pair of them comprising some eighty\r\nthousand soldiers, besides whom there were fourteen thousand sailors,\r\nnaval gunners, and marines, fifteen thousand men belonging to various\r\nvolunteer corps, and one hundred and fifteen thousand Mobile Guards,\r\nin addition to three hundred thousand National Guards apportioned\r\namong the nine sections of the ramparts. But although there was thus\r\nalmost a nation of defenders, the disciplined, tried soldiers were\r\nfew in number. Men were being equipped and drilled; Paris had become\r\none immense entrenched camp. The defensive preparations were being\r\nfeverishly pushed forward, roads were intercepted, the houses in the\r\nmilitary zone were razed to the ground, the two hundred guns of heavy\r\ncalibre, and the two thousand five hundred others were utilised; other\r\ncannon were cast, quite an arsenal springing into existence, thanks to\r\nthe great patriotic efforts of Dorian, the Minister of Public Works.\r\nAfter the rupture of the negotiations of Ferri\xc3\xa8res, when Jules Favre\r\nhad acquainted the inhabitants with Count von Bismarck\'s demands--the\r\ncession of Alsace, the surrender of the garrison of Strasburg, and the\r\npayment of a war indemnity of five milliards of francs,[49]--a cry of\r\nrage resounded, and everyone acclaimed the continuation of the war, the\r\nprolongation of resistance as a condition indispensable to the very\r\nexistence of France. Even should there be no hope of victory, it was\r\nthe duty of Paris to defend herself so that the country might live.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, at the close of September, Maurice was sent with a fatigue\r\nparty to the other end of the city, and a fresh hope buoyed him up as\r\nhe threaded the streets and crossed the squares. It seemed to him\r\nthat since the rout of Ch\xc3\xa2tillon all hearts had been rising for the\r\nmighty task that had to be accomplished. Ah! that Paris, which he had\r\nknown so intent upon enjoyment, so near to the most grievous faults,\r\nhow simple he found it now--cheerfully brave, and ready for every\r\nsacrifice! Everybody was in uniform; those who, as a rule, took the\r\nleast interest in national affairs, now wore the _k\xc3\xa9pi_ of the National\r\nGuard. Like some gigantic clock whose works have broken, social life,\r\nindustry, trade, business, had suddenly come to a standstill, and\r\nthere remained but one passion--the resolution to conquer. It was the\r\nonly subject that men talked of, that inflamed both their hearts and\r\ntheir heads, at the public meetings, during the guard-room vigils,\r\nand amid the crowds that incessantly gathered in the streets, barring\r\nboth foot and roadways. Men\'s minds were carried away by the illusions\r\nthus diffused; excessive tension was exposing them to the dangers\r\nof generous folly. Quite a crisis of sickly neurosis was already\r\ndeclaring itself, an epidemic fever of exaggerated fears as well as of\r\nexaggerated confidence, amid which a mere nothing sufficed to set the\r\nhuman animal loose. In the Rue des Martyrs, Maurice witnessed a scene\r\nwhich passionately excited him--a furious mob rushing to the assault of\r\na lofty house, one of whose upmost windows had remained throughout the\r\nnight brightly illumined by a lamp, which had evidently been intended\r\nas a signal to the Prussians stationed at Bellevue. Haunted by this\r\nbelief in signals, some citizens virtually lived upon the housetops,\r\nwatching all that went on around them. On the previous day, too, an\r\nunfortunate man had narrowly escaped being drowned in the ornamental\r\nwater in the Tuileries Garden, because he had spread a map of the city\r\non a seat and consulted it.\r\n\r\nAll Maurice\'s confidence in the things in which he had formerly\r\nbelieved was shattered, and he, once so open-minded, was also\r\nsuccumbing to the mania of suspicion. Certainly he no longer despaired\r\nas he had done on the night of the panic of Ch\xc3\xa2tillon, when he had\r\nanxiously wondered whether the French army would ever regain sufficient\r\nvirility to fight; no, the _sortie_ of September 30 in the direction\r\nof L\'Hay and Chevilly, that of October 13 when the Mobiles had\r\ncarried Bagneux, and that of October 21 when his regiment momentarily\r\nsecured possession of the park of La Malmaison, had restored all his\r\nconfidence, that flame of hope which a spark sufficed to rekindle\r\nand which consumed him. Although the Prussians had hitherto checked\r\nit upon every point, the army had none the less fought valiantly,\r\nand it might yet conquer. Maurice\'s sufferings, however, were caused\r\nby Paris itself, which darted from extreme illusion to the deepest\r\ndiscouragement, ever haunted as it was, amid its thirst for victory,\r\nby an all-absorbing fear of treachery. After the Emperor and Marshal\r\nMacMahon, would not General Trochu and General Ducrot prove commanders\r\nof scant ability, unconscious artisans of defeat? The same movement\r\nwhich had swept the Empire away--all the impatience of violent-minded\r\nmen eager to assume power and save France--was now threatening the\r\nGovernment of National Defence. Jules Favre and its other members were\r\nindeed already more unpopular than the fallen ministers of Napoleon\r\nIII. Since they would not conquer the Prussians, it was their duty\r\nto make way for others, for the revolutionaries, who were certain\r\nof conquering by decreeing the _lev\xc3\xa9e en masse_, and by employing\r\nthe inventors who offered to undermine the suburbs of the city or to\r\nannihilate the enemy with a torrent of Greek fire.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the rising of October 31 Maurice was thus consumed by\r\nthat malady of the siege days compounded of distrust and illusion.\r\nHe now lent a willing ear to fancies at which he would formerly have\r\nsmiled. Why should they not be realisable? Were not imbecility and\r\ncrime limitless? Was there not a possibility of a miracle amid all\r\nthe catastrophes overturning the world? There was a flood of rancour\r\nwithin him which had been gathering since that night when, in front\r\nof Mulhausen, he had heard of the disaster of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler; and his\r\nheart bled at the thought of Sedan--Sedan, that raw wound, still sore,\r\nwhich opened and bled afresh at the tidings of the slightest reverse.\r\nCast into a scaring, nightmare-like existence, no longer knowing if he\r\nwere yet alive, he still suffered from the shock of each defeat; his\r\nphysical strength had been impoverished, his head weakened by that long\r\nperiod of hungry days and sleepless nights; and the idea that so much\r\nsuffering would but lead to another and an irremediable disaster fairly\r\nmaddened him, transformed him, a man of culture, into a being governed\r\nmerely by instinct, fallen into childhood once more, and ever swayed\r\nand carried away by the impulse of the moment. Anything, everything,\r\ndestruction, extermination rather than surrender a copper of the\r\nfortune or an inch of the territory of France! The evolution at work\r\nwithin him, which, under the blow of the first reverses, had swept\r\naway his faith in the Napoleonic legend--that sentimental Bonapartism\r\nwhich he had imbibed from his grandfather\'s epic narratives--was now\r\nreaching completion. He no longer even believed in the theoretical,\r\norderly Republic, he was already inclining to revolutionary violence\r\nand to the necessity of terror as the only means of sweeping away the\r\nimbeciles and traitors who were butchering their own country. And so\r\nhe was heart and soul with the insurrectionists on October 31, when\r\nsuch disastrous tidings came pouring upon Paris in fast succession--the\r\nloss of Le Bourget, so gallantly carried by the Volunteers of the Press\r\non the night of the 27th; the arrival of M. Thiers at Versailles on\r\nhis return from his journey to the European capitals, whence he had\r\ncome, so it was reported, to treat for peace in the name of Napoleon\r\nIII.; and finally the surrender of Metz, which, after the vague\r\nrumours which had been current, now became a frightful certainty,\r\na supreme sledge-hammer blow, another but infinitely more shameful\r\nSedan. And, on the morrow, when Maurice learnt of the occurrences at\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville--the insurrectionists momentarily victorious, the\r\nmembers of the Government detained captive until the small hours of the\r\nmorning and then only saved by a veering of the population, which, at\r\nfirst exasperated with them, had ultimately become anxious at thought\r\nof the triumph of the rising--he regretted the failure of the attempt,\r\nthe failure to establish that Commune which might possibly have brought\r\nthem salvation, with its call to arms, and its proclamation of the\r\ncountry in danger arousing all the classical memories of a free people\r\ndetermined not to perish. Thiers, for his part, did not even dare to\r\nenter the city, and on the rupture of the negotiations the Parisians\r\nall but illuminated.\r\n\r\nThen the month of November went by amid feverish impatience. Some\r\ntrifling engagements were fought, in which Maurice took no part. He\r\nwas now camping in the direction of St. Ouen, and at each opportunity\r\nhe applied for leave, to satisfy his incessant craving for news. Like\r\nhim, Paris was waiting anxiously. Political passions seemed to have\r\nbeen somewhat appeased by the election of the district mayors, though\r\nit was noticeable that most of the successful candidates belonged to\r\nthe extreme parties, an ominous symptom for the future. And that for\r\nwhich Paris was so anxiously waiting during this long lull, was the\r\ngreat _sortie_ so incessantly called for, the _sortie_ which was\r\nto bring victory and deliverance. Of this, again, there was not the\r\nslightest doubt; they would hurl back the Prussians and pass over them.\r\nPreparations were being made on the peninsula of Gennevilliers, the\r\npoint which was considered most favourable for the projected effort.\r\nBut one morning there came a fit of mad delight at the good news of\r\nCoulmiers--Orleans retaken, the Army of the Loire marching upon Paris,\r\nand already camping, it was said, at Etampes. Then everything was\r\nchanged; the Gennevilliers scheme, Trochu\'s long meditated plan, was\r\nabruptly set aside since it would merely be necessary to join hands\r\nwith the army of succour across the Marne. The military forces had by\r\nthis time been reorganised, and three armies had been created--one\r\ncomposed of the battalions of the National Guard under the orders\r\nof General Cl\xc3\xa9ment Thomas; the second, which General Ducrot was to\r\nconduct to the great attack, formed of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth\r\nArmy Corps, reinforced by the best men that could be picked out of the\r\nother forces; and finally the third, the reserve army, composed almost\r\nentirely of Mobile Guards, and confided to General Vinoy. And when on\r\nNovember 28 Maurice came to bivouac with his regiment--the 115th of\r\nthe Line--in the wood of Vincennes, he entertained no doubt of the\r\nsuccess of the effort. The three corps of the second army were all\r\nencamped there, and the men told one another that their appointment\r\nwith the Army of the Loire was for the morrow at Fontainebleau.\r\nThen, immediately afterwards, came the customary ill-luck, the\r\nusual blunders, a sudden rising of the Marne which prevented the\r\npontoon-bridges from being thrown across it, and regrettable orders\r\nwhich delayed the movements of the troops. On the following night the\r\n115th of the Line was one of the first regiments to cross the river,\r\nand as early as ten o\'clock, under a terrible fusillade, Maurice\r\nentered the village of Champigny. He was wild with excitement, and\r\nhis chassepot burnt his fingers despite the bitter cold. Ever since\r\nhe had been on the march he had had but one desire, to continue going\r\nonward like that, onward, ever onward until he met his comrades of\r\nthe provinces over yonder. But, beyond Champigny and Bry, the army\r\nhad come upon the park-walls of C\xc5\x93uilly and Villiers, walls more than\r\nfive hundred yards in length, which the enemy had transformed into\r\nimpregnable fortresses. They proved the limit, the obstacle that\r\nbravery was powerless to surmount. From that moment all was hesitation\r\nand retreat; the third corps\' movements having been delayed, the first\r\nand second, whose advance was already arrested, continued defending\r\nChampigny during a couple of days, but eventually had to abandon\r\nit during the night of December 2, having merely achieved a barren\r\nvictory. That night the whole army returned to encamp under the trees\r\nof the wood of Vincennes, which were white with rime; and Maurice, who\r\ncould no longer even feel his feet, so numbed they were by the cold,\r\nlay with his face upon the frozen ground, and wept.\r\n\r\nAh! the sad dreary days which followed after the collapse of that great\r\neffort! The great _sortie_, so long in preparation, the irresistible\r\nonslaught which was to have delivered Paris, had failed; and three days\r\nlater a letter from General von Moltke announced that the Army of the\r\nLoire had again been defeated and compelled to abandon Orleans. The\r\nfetters encompassing the city were being drawn tighter and tighter, as\r\nit were, and henceforth there was no possibility of breaking through\r\nthem. Yet Paris, in the delirium of despair, seemed to acquire a fresh\r\nresistive strength. Famine was beginning to threaten the inhabitants.\r\nSince the middle of October meat had been rationed. In December not a\r\nbeast remained of the great droves of oxen and flocks of sheep which\r\nhad been turned into the Bois de Boulogne amid the clouds of dust\r\nraised by their continuous tramping; and now the horses were being\r\nslaughtered. The Government supplies, and the private stores of flour\r\nand grain which had been requisitioned, had been calculated to yield\r\nsufficient bread for four months. When the flour was all consumed it\r\nbecame necessary to erect mills in the railway stations. There was also\r\na dearth of fuel, and such little as remained was reserved for grinding\r\nthe grain, baking the bread, and manufacturing weapons. And yet Paris,\r\nwithout gas, with her streets lighted merely by petroleum lamps, few\r\nand far between, Paris shivering under her icy mantle, Paris, whose\r\nblack bread and horseflesh were doled out to her in infinitesimal\r\nquantities, continued hoping--hoping despite everything, talking of\r\nFaidherbe in the north, of Chanzy on the Loire, and of Bourbaki in\r\nthe east, as though some prodigy were about to bring these commanders\r\nvictorious under the ramparts. The crowds which waited in the snow\r\noutside the bakers\' and butchers\' shops still chatted gaily at times\r\nover the news of some great imaginary victory. Indeed, after the short\r\nfit of despondency which followed upon each defeat, the same tenacious\r\nillusions would spring to life again, and flare yet higher and higher\r\namong that mass of people whom suffering and hunger filled with\r\nhallucinations. One day, a soldier who had spoken of surrender, was\r\nalmost massacred by the bystanders on the Place du Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Eau. The\r\ntroops, whose courage was exhausted and who felt the end approaching,\r\nasked for peace, but the inhabitants still clamoured for the _sortie\r\nen masse_, the torrential _sortie_, when the entire population, men,\r\nwomen, and even children, were to rush upon the Prussians, like a vast\r\noverflowing stream which throws everything down and sweeps it away.\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice now kept apart from his comrades, avoiding them, and\r\nexperiencing a growing hatred of his soldier\'s calling which penned him\r\nup idle and useless under the shelter of Mont Val\xc3\xa9rien. And thus he\r\navailed himself of every opportunity that presented itself, invented\r\nall possible pretexts to obtain leave, and hurried with more haste\r\nthan ever into that Paris where his heart had fixed its abode. He only\r\nfound peace of mind when he was in the midst of the thronging masses;\r\nhe tried to force himself to hope as the mob hoped. He often went to\r\nwitness the ascent of the balloons which every few days were sent up\r\nfrom the Northern and Orleans railway stations, with a freight of\r\ncarrier pigeons, despatches, and letters. The balloons ascended and\r\nwere lost to sight in the cheerless wintry sky; and the hearts of the\r\nonlookers became heavy with anguish whenever the wind wafted them in\r\nthe direction of Germany. Many of them must have been lost. Maurice had\r\nwritten twice to his sister Henriette, but he did not know if she had\r\nreceived his letters. His recollections of her and of Jean were now\r\nso far away from him, in the depths of that vast world whence nothing\r\ncame, that he now thought of those dear ones but seldom, and then as\r\nof affections which he had left behind him in some other life. There\r\nwas no room for them in his being now, it was filled to overflowing\r\nwith the ceaseless tempest of despondency and excitement amid which\r\nhe lived. Then, in the early days of January, he found fresh food\r\nfor his exasperation in the bombardment of the districts on the left\r\nbank of the Seine. He had ended by ascribing the dilatoriness of the\r\nGermans in this respect to humanitarian reasons, though it was simply\r\ndue to the difficulties they encountered in conveying their siege-guns\r\nthrough France and getting them into position. And now that a shell\r\nhad killed two little girls at the Val-de-Gr\xc3\xa2ce hospital, Maurice felt\r\nunbounded scorn and hatred for those barbarians who murdered children\r\nand threatened to burn down the public museums and libraries. However,\r\nafter the first few days of fright, Paris had resumed, under the bombs,\r\nits life of unfaltering heroism.\r\n\r\nSince the reverse of Champigny, there had only been one more abortive\r\nattempt at a _sortie_, made in the direction of Le Bourget, and on\r\nthe evening when the plateau of Avron had to be evacuated, under the\r\nfire of the heavy guns pounding away at the forts, Maurice shared the\r\nviolent fit of exasperation which spread throughout the city. At this\r\njuncture the growing discontent which threatened to sweep away General\r\nTrochu and the Government of National Defence acquired such intensity\r\nthat the rulers of the city were compelled to attempt a supreme and\r\nhopeless effort. Why indeed did they refuse to lead the three hundred\r\nthousand National Guards into the field, the National Guards who did\r\nnot cease offering themselves and claiming their share of peril? It\r\nwas the torrential _sortie_ clamoured for since the very outset,\r\nParis opening her flood-gates and drowning the Prussians beneath the\r\ncolossal torrent of her people. Despite the certainty of a fresh\r\ndefeat, it became necessary to accede to this gallant prayer; but in\r\norder to limit the slaughter, the commanders contented themselves with\r\nadjoining to the regular troops the fifty-nine marching battalions of\r\nthe National Guard. And the eve of January 19 was like a _f\xc3\xaate_: an\r\nenormous crowd thronged the Boulevards and the Champs-Elys\xc3\xa9es, watching\r\nthe regiments as they marched along headed by their bands, and singing\r\npatriotic refrains. Children and women accompanied them, and men sprang\r\nupon the benches to shout their ardent prayers for victory. Then, on\r\nthe morrow, the entire population betook itself to the neighbourhood\r\nof the Arc-de-Triomphe, and a wild hope inflamed it when in the course\r\nof the morning the tidings arrived of the occupation of Montretout.\r\nEpic-like narratives circulated concerning the irresistible dash of the\r\nNational Guards; the Prussians were overcome, Versailles itself would\r\nbe captured before the evening. And then, what a collapse there was\r\nwhen the inevitable repulse became known at nightfall! Whilst the left\r\nwing of the army was occupying Montretout, the central column, after\r\nmaking its way beyond the outer wall of Buzenval Park, was shattered\r\nin its efforts to carry a second inner wall which it encountered.\r\nThere had been a thaw, moreover, a persistent fine rain had drenched\r\nthe roads, and the guns, those guns cast by public subscription, the\r\npride and the hope of Paris, were unable to come up. On the right, too,\r\nGeneral Ducrot\'s column, brought into action much too late, was still\r\nlagging into the rear. The effort could be carried no further, and\r\nGeneral Trochu had to give orders for a general retreat. Montretout was\r\nabandoned, St. Cloud was abandoned and set on fire by the Prussians.\r\nAnd when black night had fallen the whole horizon was illumined by the\r\nglow of that immense conflagration.\r\n\r\nThis time Maurice himself felt that it was all over. During four hours,\r\nunder the galling fire from the Prussian entrenchments, he had remained\r\nin the park of Buzenval with some of the National Guards, whose\r\ncourage he greatly praised when he returned into the city a few days\r\nafterwards. They had indeed conducted themselves bravely. That being\r\nso, was not the defeat necessarily due to the imbecility and treachery\r\nof the commanders? In the Rue de Rivoli he met bands of men shouting\r\n\'Down with Trochu!\' and \'Vive la Commune!\' Another awakening of the\r\nrevolutionary passions had come, a fresh propulsion of public opinion\r\nof such a disquieting character that, to avoid being swept away, the\r\nGovernment of National Defence thought it necessary to compel General\r\nTrochu to resign his command and set General Vinoy in his place. That\r\nsame day, at a public meeting at Belleville, Maurice again heard a\r\ndemand for an attack _en masse_. It was a mad idea, and he knew it,\r\nyet his heart again began beating more rapidly, in presence of this\r\nobstinate resolve to fight and conquer. When all is ended, should\r\nnot the impossible be attempted? Throughout the night he dreamt of\r\nprodigies.\r\n\r\nThen another long week went by. Paris was suffering uncomplainingly.\r\nThe shops were no longer opened, the few foot passengers no longer\r\nmet a single vehicle in the deserted streets. Forty thousand horses\r\nhad been eaten; dogs, cats, and rats were fetching high prices. Since\r\nthe dearth of wheat had set in, the bread, partially compounded of\r\nrice and oats, was black, viscous, and difficult of digestion; and the\r\ninterminable \'waits\' outside the bakers\' shops to obtain the three\r\nhundred grammes of bread[50] to which each person\'s daily ration was\r\nlimited, were becoming mortal. Ah! those grievous \'waits\' of the siege\r\ndays, those poor women shivering under the downpour, with their feet in\r\nthe icy slush--all the heroic wretchedness of the great city still bent\r\nupon not surrendering. The death-rate had increased threefold,[51]\r\nthe theatres had been turned into ambulances. At nightfall the once\r\nluxurious fashionable quarters fell into a dreary quietness, into dense\r\nobscurity, like districts of some accursed city smitten by pestilence.\r\nAnd amid the silence and obscurity, you heard but the far-off,\r\ncontinuous crash of the bombardment, and saw but the flashes of the\r\nguns setting the wintry sky aglow.\r\n\r\nAll at once, on January 26, Paris became aware that for a couple of\r\ndays past Jules Favre had been negotiating with Count von Bismarck for\r\nan armistice; and at the same time it learnt that there only remained\r\nsufficient bread for another ten days, barely the period requisite\r\nfor the revictualling of the city. Capitulation had become a brutal\r\nnecessity. In its stupor at thus at last learning the truth, Paris\r\nmournfully allowed the Government to act as it listed. That same day,\r\nat midnight, the last cannon shot was fired. And, on the 29th, when\r\nthe Germans had occupied the forts, Maurice came inside the ramparts\r\nwith the 115th and encamped in the neighbourhood of Montrouge. Then\r\nbegan an aimless kind of life, made up of idleness and feverish unrest.\r\nDiscipline was greatly relaxed, the soldiers disbanded and roamed\r\nabout, waiting to be sent home again. He, however, remained in a wild\r\nexcited state, prompt to taking offence at the slightest provocation,\r\nhis disquietude ever ready to turn into exasperation. He devoured the\r\nrevolutionary newspapers, and that three weeks\' armistice, concluded\r\nfor the sole purpose of allowing France to elect an Assembly which\r\nwas to pronounce upon the conclusion of peace or the continuance of\r\nwar, seemed to him a delusion and a snare, a final, supreme act of\r\ntreachery. Even if Paris were forced to capitulate, he, like Gambetta,\r\nwas in favour of continuing the war on the Loire and in the North. The\r\ndisasters which overtook the Army of the East, forgotten, compelled to\r\ntake refuge in Switzerland, enraged him. And then the result of the\r\nelections brought his fury to a climax; it was just as he had foreseen,\r\nthe cowardly provinces, irritated by the resistance of Paris, hankered\r\nfor peace at any price, so that they might bring back the monarchy,\r\neven under the Prussian guns. After the first sittings of the Assembly\r\nat Bordeaux, Thiers, elected in six-and-twenty departments, chosen\r\nchief of the executive by acclamation, became in his eyes a monster,\r\nthe man of every lie and every crime. And nothing could now calm\r\nhim--the peace which was concluded by the monarchical Assembly seemed\r\nto him a climax of shame; he became delirious at the mere thought of\r\nthose harsh conditions, the indemnity of five milliards of francs, Metz\r\ngiven up, Alsace abandoned, the gold and the blood of France pouring\r\nforth from that wound opened in her flank, and never to be healed!\r\n\r\nThen, during the last days of February, Maurice made up his mind to\r\ndesert. One clause of the treaty specified that the soldiers encamped\r\nin Paris should be disarmed and sent home. He did not wait for this,\r\nhowever; it seemed to him that it would rend his heart asunder if he\r\nwere compelled to quit that glorious Paris, which hunger alone had been\r\nable to subdue. So he took himself off, and rented, in a six-storeyed\r\nhouse in the Rue des Orties, atop of the Butte des Moulins,[52] a\r\nlittle furnished room, akin to a belvedere, whence he could gaze over\r\nthe sea of roofs and chimneys, from the Tuileries to the Bastille. An\r\nold fellow-student of the Law School had lent him a hundred francs.\r\nMoreover, as soon as he had secured a lodging, he entered himself\r\nin one of the battalions of the National Guard, resolved to content\r\nhimself with the pay of a franc and a half per day allowed to the\r\ncitizen soldiery. The idea of leading a quiet, egotistical life in\r\nthe provinces horrified him. Even the letters which he received from\r\nhis sister Henriette, to whom he had written directly the armistice\r\nwas concluded, angered him with their pressing entreaties, the ardent\r\ndesire they expressed that he would come and rest at Remilly. He\r\nrefused to do so--he would only go there later on, when no Prussians\r\nwere left there.\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice now led a vagabond, lazy life, in a state of increasing\r\nfeverishness. He no longer suffered from hunger; he had devoured the\r\nfirst white bread he could procure with delight. Paris, where there\r\nhad never been any dearth either of wine or brandy, was now living\r\nin plenty, sinking, too, into incorrigible dipsomania. Still, it was\r\nalways a prison, with its gates guarded by the Germans, and so many\r\ncomplicated formalities in force that people were unable to leave.\r\nThere had as yet been no resumption of social life; there was still\r\nno work, no business transactions were engaged in, and cooped within\r\nthe ramparts there was a whole people waiting in suspense and doing\r\nnothing, losing its last habits of regular, orderly life, whilst it\r\nvegetated in the bright sunshine of that budding springtime. During the\r\nsiege there had at least been the military service to tire men\'s limbs\r\nand occupy their minds, whereas now the population, in the isolation\r\nin which it still found itself, had all at once slipped into a life of\r\nabsolute idleness. Maurice, like most others, lounged about from morn\r\nto eve, breathing the vitiated atmosphere, now thoroughly impregnated\r\nwith all the germs of madness which for months past had been ascending\r\nfrom the mob. The unlimited liberty which prevailed completed the\r\nuniversal destruction. Maurice read the papers, attended the public\r\nmeetings, shrugged his shoulders at the more preposterous speeches,\r\nbut, nevertheless, returned home with his brain full of violent ideas,\r\nready to engage in any desperate deed for the defence of what he\r\nbelieved to be truth and justice. And in his little room, whence he\r\noverlooked the city, he still indulged in dreams of victory, telling\r\nhimself that France, the Republic, might yet be saved, so long as the\r\ntreaty of peace was not finally signed.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians were to enter Paris on March 1, and when this became\r\nknown a long howl of execration and wrath went up from every heart.\r\nMaurice never attended a public meeting now without hearing the\r\nAssembly, Thiers, and the Men of the Fourth of September charged\r\nwith the responsibility of this crowning affront, from which, it was\r\nasserted, they had not tried to spare the heroic city.[53] He himself\r\nbecame so frenzied one evening that he made a speech and shouted that\r\nall Paris ought to go and die upon the ramparts, rather than allow a\r\nsingle Prussian to enter the capital. Amid this population, maddened by\r\nlong months of misery and hunger, reduced to absolute idleness, unable\r\nto shake off its painful thoughts, consumed by suspicion, and fearful\r\nof phantoms of its own creation, the insurrectionary movement grew\r\nand spread, made all its preparations in the full light of day. It was\r\none of those moral crises which have followed upon all great sieges,\r\nwhen excessive patriotism, deceived in its hopes and expectations,\r\nafter vainly inflaming men\'s minds, becomes changed into a blind\r\nlonging for violence and destruction. The Central Committee, elected\r\nby the delegates of the National Guard, had just protested against\r\nany attempt at disarming the citizen soldiery. A great demonstration\r\nhad followed on the Place de la Bastille, with red flags, incendiary\r\nspeeches, an immense concourse of people, and, as a climax, the murder\r\nof a wretched detective, who was flung into the canal and stoned until\r\nhe drowned. And forty-eight hours later, on the night of February 26,\r\nMaurice, aroused by the beating of the \'assembly\' and the ringing\r\nof the tocsin, met bands of men and women dragging cannon along the\r\nBoulevard des Batignolles. And he too, with a score of other men,\r\nharnessed himself to one of the guns, on hearing that the people\r\nhad been to fetch this artillery from the Place Wagram, so that the\r\nAssembly might not hand it over to the Prussians. There were altogether\r\na hundred and seventy pieces, and for lack of horses the people dragged\r\nthem along with ropes, pushed them with their fists till they brought\r\nthem to the summit of Montmartre, with the fierce impetuosity of some\r\nbarbarian horde saving its idols from destruction. When on March 1\r\nthe Prussians had to content themselves with occupying the district\r\nof the Champs-Elys\xc3\xa9es, penned up there within barriers like a herd of\r\nanxious conquerors, Paris put on a lugubrious aspect and did not stir;\r\nits streets were deserted, its houses closed--the whole city remained\r\nlifeless, shrouded, as it were, in a huge veil of mourning.\r\n\r\nTwo more weeks went by, and Maurice no longer knew how he was living\r\nduring this long wait for the indeterminate, monstrous something whose\r\napproach he could divine. Peace was now definitely concluded, the\r\nAssembly was to take up its quarters at Versailles on March 20; but\r\nto Maurice it seemed that nothing was yet ended, that some frightful\r\n_revanche_ was at hand. Whilst he was dressing on the morning of March\r\n18, he received a letter from Henriette, in which she again begged\r\nhim to join her at Remilly, affectionately threatening to go to fetch\r\nhim if he should delay his coming much longer. And then she referred\r\nto Jean, and related how, after leaving her at the end of December to\r\njoin the Army of the North, he had fallen ill of a low fever and had\r\nbeen nursed in a Belgian hospital; and he had written to her, only the\r\nprevious week, to say that in spite of his weakness he was about to\r\nstart for Paris with the intention of seeking active service again.\r\nHenriette concluded by asking her brother to give her full particulars\r\nconcerning Jean as soon as he had seen him. Then Maurice, with this\r\nletter lying open before his eyes, fell into a tender reverie.\r\nHenriette, Jean, his fondly loved sister, his brother bound to him by\r\nties of mutual misery and succour; ah! how far those dear ones were\r\nfrom his daily thoughts, now that the tempest was ever raging within\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nHowever, as his sister informed him that she had been unable to give\r\nJean his address in the Rue des Orties, he determined to try and find\r\nhis friend that same day, by applying at the War Office. But he was\r\nbarely out of the house, just crossing the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 in fact, when\r\ntwo comrades of his battalion acquainted him with what had happened\r\nduring the night and early morning at Montmartre. And all three then\r\nstarted off thither at the double-quick, half out of their senses.\r\n\r\nAh! that 18th of March, with what fatal excitement did it inflame\r\nMaurice! Later on he could not clearly remember what he had done or\r\nsaid that day. Looking backward, he first beheld himself galloping\r\nalong in a state of fury--fury at thought of the surprise which the\r\ntroops had attempted that morning before daybreak, with the view\r\nof recapturing the guns of Montmartre, and thus disarming Paris.\r\nEvidently enough, Thiers, who had recently arrived from Bordeaux, had\r\nfor two days past been planning this stroke, the object of which was\r\nto enable the Assembly to proclaim the monarchy at Versailles. Next\r\nMaurice beheld himself at Montmartre at about nine o\'clock, fired by\r\nthe narratives of victory which were recounted to him--how the troops\r\nhad come stealing up in the darkness; how the arrival of the teams\r\nwhich were to have removed the guns had been delayed; how the National\r\nGuards had thereupon rushed to arms; and how the soldiers, loth to\r\nfire on women and children, had eventually hoisted the butt-ends of\r\ntheir chassepots and fraternised with the people. Then he beheld\r\nhimself roaming through Paris at random, already realising by midday\r\nthat the city belonged to the Commune, although there had been no\r\nbattle. Thiers and the ministers, however, had fled from the Ministry\r\nof Foreign Affairs, where they had been assembled in council, the\r\nGovernment rushed helter-skelter to Versailles, and the thirty thousand\r\ntroops of the garrison were led away in all haste, though not without\r\nleaving over five thousand deserters on the road. Then Maurice beheld\r\nhimself at about half-past five at a corner on the outer Boulevards,\r\nloitering among a group of ruffians and listening without any feeling\r\nof indignation to the abominable story of the murder of Generals\r\nLecomte and Cl\xc3\xa9ment Thomas. Generals, indeed! He remembered those of\r\nSedan, incapable humbugs who only thought of taking all the blanket to\r\nthemselves! One the more or one the less, verily, that was a matter of\r\nlittle consequence! And he had spent the remainder of the day in the\r\nsame wildly excited state, no longer capable of seeing things as they\r\nreally were, transported by this insurrection which the very paving\r\nstones seemed to have favoured, which, in the unforeseen fatality of\r\nits triumph, had spread and at one stroke secured power, placing the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville, at ten o\'clock that same night, in the hands of the\r\nmembers of the Central Committee, who were amazed to find themselves\r\nassembled there.\r\n\r\nConfused as were these memories in Maurice\'s mind, he retained a\r\nprecise recollection of one incident--his unexpected meeting with Jean.\r\nThe latter had reached Paris three days previously, penniless, still\r\nwan and enfeebled by the fever which during two long months had kept\r\nhim in a hospital at Brussels; and meeting a former captain of his\r\nold regiment, Captain Ravaud, he had at once joined the company which\r\nthis officer now commanded in the 124th of the Line. He had secured\r\nhis old rank of corporal, and on the evening of the insurrection he\r\nhad just left the Prince-Eug\xc3\xa8ne barracks with his squad, the last of\r\nthe regiment, in view of reaching the left bank of the Seine, where\r\nthe entire army had received orders to concentrate, when he and his\r\nmen were suddenly stopped by the crowd assembled on the Boulevard St.\r\nMartin. Shouts were raised, and there was a talk of disarming the\r\nsoldiers. With perfect coolness, however, Jean requested the mob to let\r\nhim alone; all this business did not concern him, said he; he simply\r\nwished to carry out his orders without hurting anyone. But all at once\r\na glad cry of surprise rang out, and Maurice, who was among the crowd\r\nand had drawn near, threw himself on his friend\'s neck, embracing him\r\nfraternally.\r\n\r\n\'What! is it you?\' said the young fellow, \'My sister wrote to me about\r\nyou, and I wished to go to the Ministry this morning to inquire after\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nBig tears of joy had gathered in Jean\'s eyes. \'Ah! my poor youngster;\r\nhow pleased I am to see you!\' he replied. \'I myself have been wanting\r\nto find you, but where could I go and look for you in this confounded\r\nbig place?\'\r\n\r\nThe crowd, meantime, was still growling angrily, and Maurice turned\r\nround to appease it. \'Let me talk to them, citizens!\' said he. \'They\r\nare good fellows and I\'ll answer for them.\' Then, grasping his friend\'s\r\nhands, he added in a lower voice: \'You will stay with us, won\'t you?\'\r\n\r\nJean\'s face assumed an expression of deep surprise. \'Stay with\r\nyou--what do you mean?\'\r\n\r\nThen for a moment he listened to Maurice while the latter railed\r\nagainst the Government and the army, recalled all that they had\r\nsuffered together in past times, and explained that the people was\r\nat last about to become the master and would punish both traitors\r\nand cowards and save the Republic. And by degrees, as Jean strove to\r\nunderstand it all, his calm peasant\'s face darkened with increasing\r\nsorrow: \'Ah! no, no, youngster, I can\'t stay, if it\'s for such fine\r\nwork as that--besides, my captain ordered me to take my men to\r\nVaugirard, and I am going there. If thunderbolts were falling, there I\r\nshould go all the same. It\'s only natural, you know it is, yourself.\'\r\nHe had begun to laugh in his simple way, and added: \'It\'s you that must\r\ncome with us.\'\r\n\r\nBut with a gesture of furious dissent Maurice released his hold on\r\nJean\'s hands. And for a few seconds they stood there face to face--one\r\na prey to all the exasperation born of that fit of insanity which had\r\ntaken possession of Paris, that malady of distant origin, sprung from\r\nthe bad leaven of the late reign; the other, strong in his practical\r\ncommon-sense and ignorance, still healthy because he had grown apart\r\nin the soil of labour and thrift. Yet they were brothers, a strong tie\r\nbound them together, and they felt as though they were being wrenched\r\nasunder when a swaying of the crowd suddenly parted them.\r\n\r\n\'Till we meet again, Maurice!\'\r\n\r\n\'Till we meet again, Jean!\'\r\n\r\nIt was a regiment of infantry, the 79th of the Line, which, debouching\r\nin a compact mass from a side street, had just thrown the mob back upon\r\nthe footways. There was again some shouting and hooting, but none were\r\nbold enough to bar the road to the soldiers, whose officers were urging\r\nthem along. And the little squad of the 124th, thus extricated from the\r\nmob, was able to follow in the wake of the regiment without further\r\nhindrance.\r\n\r\n\'Till we meet again, Jean!\'\r\n\r\n\'Till we meet again, Maurice!\'\r\n\r\nAgain did they wave their hands, yielding to the fatality of that\r\nviolent parting, but with their hearts still full of one another.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing days Maurice at first forgot this incident, so\r\nabsorbing were the extraordinary events which now followed one\r\nupon another in fast succession. On the 19th Paris awoke without a\r\nGovernment; still, it was more surprised than frightened on learning\r\nhow panic had carried off the army, the public services, and the\r\nministers to Versailles during the night; and, as the weather was\r\nmagnificent that fine March Sunday, the city simply streamed into the\r\nstreets to gaze at the barricades. A large white placard emanating from\r\nthe Central Committee, and convoking the population for the Communal\r\nelections, appeared a very sensible production. People merely expressed\r\nsurprise at finding it signed by names so utterly unknown. At the dawn\r\nof the Commune, indeed, Paris, in the bitter memory of all that it had\r\nsuffered, in the suspicions also which ever haunted it, was hostile to\r\nVersailles. Absolute anarchy, moreover, prevailed; the district mayors\r\nand the Central Committee contending for authority, and the former\r\nmaking ineffectual efforts at conciliation, whilst the latter, as yet\r\nuncertain whether it could rely upon the entire federated National\r\nGuard, modestly limited its demands to municipal liberty. The shots\r\nfired at the pacific demonstration of the Place Vend\xc3\xb4me, the few\r\nvictims who then fell, staining the pavement with their blood, sent\r\nthe first thrill of terror circulating through the city. And whilst\r\nthe triumphant insurrection was at last taking possession of all the\r\nministries and public departments, equal rage and alarm prevailed\r\nat Versailles, where the Government was hastily gathering together\r\nsufficient military forces to repel the attack which it felt to be\r\nimminent. The most reliable troops of the armies of the North and of\r\nthe Loire were speedily summoned; and, ten days having sufficed to\r\ncollect a force of nearly eighty thousand men, confidence returned\r\nso rapidly that already on April 2 a couple of divisions opened\r\nhostilities by taking the suburbs of Puteaux and Courbevoie from the\r\nFederals.[54]\r\n\r\nIt was only on the morrow that Maurice, who had set out with his\r\nbattalion to effect the capture of Versailles, again beheld Jean\'s\r\nsorrowful countenance rise up amid his feverish souvenirs. The attack\r\nof the Versaillese had stupefied and exasperated the National Guard,\r\nand three columns of the latter, some fifty thousand men, had poured\r\nforth from Paris early that morning, rushing towards Versailles by\r\nway of Bougival and Meudon with the design of seizing the monarchical\r\nAssembly and the murderer Thiers! \'Twas the torrential _sortie_, the\r\n_sortie_ so ardently demanded during the siege, and Maurice wondered\r\nwhere he should again see Jean, whether it would not be over yonder\r\namong the corpses on the battlefield? But the rout came too promptly\r\nfor his surmises; his battalion had barely reached the Plateau des\r\nBerg\xc3\xa8res, on the road to Reuil, when some shells, fired from the fort\r\nof Mont Val\xc3\xa9rien, fell among the ranks. For a moment perfect stupor\r\nprevailed; some of the men had imagined that the fort was held by their\r\ncomrades, whilst others averred that the commander had promised that he\r\nwould not fire. Then a mad terror took possession of the Federals, the\r\nbattalions disbanded and scurried back into Paris, whilst the head of\r\nthe column, cut off by a turning movement which General Vinoy promptly\r\neffected, only reached Reuil to be cut to pieces there.\r\n\r\nMaurice, who had escaped from the slaughter unharmed, and was thrilled\r\nwith the emotion of fighting, now nourished intense hatred for that\r\nso-called government of law and order, which, beaten by the Prussians\r\nin every encounter, could only muster up courage to conquer Paris.\r\nAnd the German armies were still there, encamped on the north-eastern\r\nside of the city from St. Denis to Charenton, and gazing on that fine\r\nspectacle of a nation\'s Downfall! In the gloomy passion for destruction\r\nwhich was gaining upon him, Maurice approved of the first violent\r\nmeasures to which the Commune resorted, the erection of barricades in\r\nthe streets and squares, the arrest of the hostages, the Archbishop,\r\nthe priests, and the ex-functionaries. Atrocities were already being\r\nperpetrated on either side; Versailles shot its prisoners, whilst\r\nParis decreed that for the head of each of its soldiers the heads of\r\nthree hostages should fall; and the little reason which Maurice still\r\nretained, after so many shocks and so much havoc, was speedily swept\r\naway by the blast of fury now blowing from every side. In his eyes the\r\nCommune appeared as the Avenger of all the shame and degradation that\r\nhad been endured, as the Liberator armed with the knife to amputate\r\nand the flame to purify. All this was not quite clear in his mind; the\r\ncultured being yet lingering within him merely evoked the old classical\r\nmemories of triumphant free cities, and federations of rich provinces\r\nimposing their will upon the world. Should Paris prove victorious, he\r\npictured her crowned with an aureole of glory, building up a new France\r\nwhere justice and liberty would reign supreme, and organising a new\r\nsociety after first sweeping away the rotten remnants of the old. To\r\ntell the truth, when the elections were over, he felt some surprise\r\non reading the names of the members of the Commune; so extraordinary\r\nwas the mingling of Moderates, Revolutionaries, and Socialists of all\r\nsects, to whom the mighty task was confided. He knew several of these\r\nmen, and esteemed them to be of very limited attainments. And would not\r\neven the best of them come into collision and neutralise one another\'s\r\nefforts, representing as they did such conflicting principles? However,\r\non the day when the Commune was solemnly installed in office at the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville, whilst the guns were booming and the trophies of red\r\nflags were flapping in the breeze, he strove to forget everything,\r\nbuoyed up once more by boundless hope. And, fanned by the lies of some\r\nand the unquestioning faith of others, his illusions were all revived\r\nin this acute stage of his malady, which was now fast reaching a climax.\r\n\r\nMaurice spent the entire month of April in the neighbourhood of\r\nNeuilly, firing away at the Versaillese. The spring was an early one,\r\nand the lilacs were already blooming; they fought amid the tender\r\ngreenery of the villa gardens, and some National Guards would return\r\nhome at nightfall with nosegays in their gun-barrels. The troops\r\nassembled at Versailles were now so numerous that they had been divided\r\ninto two armies, the first actively engaged under Marshal MacMahon, and\r\nthe second forming a reserve force, commanded by General Vinoy. The\r\nCommune, on its side, had about one hundred thousand mobilised National\r\nGuards, and nearly as many men in the sedentary battalions, but of all\r\nthese not more than fifty thousand really fought. And day by day the\r\nplan of the Versaillese became more and more evident; after taking\r\nNeuilly they had occupied the ch\xc3\xa2teau of B\xc3\xa9con and then Asni\xc3\xa8res, but\r\nsimply with a view of bringing the line of investment closer to the\r\ncity, which they purposed entering by the Point-du-Jour, as soon as\r\nthey could force the rampart there by means of the converging fire of\r\nMont-Val\xc3\xa9rien and the fort of Issy. Mont-Val\xc3\xa9rien belonged to them, and\r\nall their efforts were directed towards capturing the fort of Issy, in\r\nattacking which they availed themselves of some of the works which had\r\nbeen thrown up by the Prussians during the late siege.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of April the cannonade and fusillade went on without\r\na pause. At Levallois and Neuilly an endless combat was kept up, a\r\nskirmishing fire which rattled uninterruptedly by day and night alike.\r\nHeavy guns, mounted upon armour-plated carriages, travelled along\r\nthe circular railway line, and fired over the roofs of Levallois at\r\nAsni\xc3\xa8res. But it was at Vanves and at Issy that the cannonade proved\r\nfiercest, all the window-panes on that side of Paris rattled as they\r\nhad done during the most terrible days of the German siege. And on\r\nMay 9, when, after a first alert, the fort of Issy finally fell into\r\nthe possession of the Versaillese, the defeat of the Commune became a\r\ncertainty, and a fit of panic impelled its members to the most evil\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nMaurice approved of the creation of a Committee of Public Safety. Pages\r\nof history returned to his mind; had not the hour struck for energetic\r\nmeasures to be adopted if the country were to be saved? Of all the\r\nmany acts of violence, there was but one which wrung his heart with\r\na secret anguish--the destruction of the Vend\xc3\xb4me Column. In vain did\r\nhe reproach himself for this feeling, this childish weakness as he\r\ndeemed it; his grandfather\'s voice still rang in his ears telling him\r\ntales of battle--Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram,\r\nthe Moskowa--all those epic narratives which thrilled him yet. But it\r\nwas different when the question was one of demolishing the house of\r\nthat murderer, Thiers, of detaining the hostages as a guarantee and a\r\nmenace, for were not acts like these fitting reprisals now that the\r\nrage of Versailles against Paris had increased to such a pitch that\r\nthe city was being bombarded, and that shells were plunging through\r\nthe house-roofs and killing women? That sombre longing for destruction\r\nmounted to his brain as the end of his dream drew nigh. If the\r\nprinciple of justice and retribution were destined to be annihilated\r\nin bloodshed might the ground open and everything be transformed by\r\none of those cosmical convulsions that have renewed the life of the\r\nworld! Might Paris fall, burn like a huge sacrificial pyre rather\r\nthan be again delivered over to its vice and its misery, to that old\r\nrotten social system that had ever upheld abominable injustice! And he\r\ndreamed another great gloomy dream--the giant city reduced to cinders,\r\nnaught left but smoking embers on both banks of the river, a nameless,\r\nunparalleled catastrophe whence a new people would arise. And thus\r\nhe took a more and more feverish interest in the wild reports which\r\ncirculated: whole districts undermined, the catacombs chokefull of\r\ngunpowder, everything ready to blow up the public monuments; electric\r\nwires connecting the mines so that a single spark would at the same\r\nmoment ignite them all; vast stores of inflammable products gathered\r\ntogether, especially petroleum, enough to turn the streets and squares\r\ninto rivers and seas of flame. The Commune had sworn it--if the\r\nVersaillese should enter the city, not one of them would pass beyond\r\nthe barricades blocking the crossways, the pavements would open, the\r\nedifices would crumble, Paris would flare from end to end and swallow\r\nup a world!\r\n\r\nAnd if Maurice began clinging to this wild dream, it was because of\r\nhis secret discontent with the Commune itself. He despaired of the men\r\ncomposing it, felt them to be incompetent, pulled this way and that by\r\nconflicting views and interests, growing more and more exasperated,\r\nlosing their heads, and lapsing into imbecility as their peril\r\ngradually increased. Of all the social reforms to which the Commune was\r\npledged, it had been unable to realise a single one; and it was already\r\ncertain that it would leave no durable work behind it. But the great\r\nevil from which it suffered was the rivalry tearing it asunder, the\r\nmutual suspicion which consumed each of its members. Many of them, the\r\nModerates, the timid ones, had already ceased taking any part in the\r\ndeliberations. The others acted on the spur of the moment, as events\r\nmight suggest, trembled at the prospect of a possible dictatorship, had\r\nreached indeed that phase when the factions of revolutionary assemblies\r\nexterminate one another in the hope of saving the Commonwealth.\r\nAfter Cluseret, after Dombrowski, it became Rossel\'s turn to be\r\nsuspected. Delescluze, appointed civil delegate at War, could himself\r\ndo nothing, despite his great authority. And on the other hand the\r\nsocial effort, of which there had been just a faint glimpse, subsided\r\nto insignificance, proved utterly abortive amid the hourly increasing\r\nisolation of these men, rendered powerless by dissension and reduced\r\nto acts of despair.\r\n\r\nTerror was rising in Paris. Irritated, at first, against Versailles,\r\nshuddering at memory of the sufferings of the siege, the city was\r\nnow detaching itself from the Commune. The compulsory enrolment,\r\nthe decree incorporating every man under forty years of age in the\r\ninsurrectionary forces, had angered people of calm minds and caused a\r\nflight _en masse_; some folks went off by way of St. Denis, disguised\r\nand provided with spurious Alsatian passports,[55] others with the\r\nhelp of ropes and ladders let themselves down into the ditch of the\r\nfortifications on dark nights. The wealthy people of the middle class\r\nhad long since taken themselves off. Not a factory, not a workshop\r\nhad reopened its doors. There was no trade, no work, the old life of\r\nidleness continued during that anxious wait for the inevitable ending.\r\nAnd the people--the poorer classes--still lived upon the paltry pay\r\nallowed to each National Guard--that franc and a half per diem paid\r\nfrom the millions which were now being requisitioned from the Bank of\r\nFrance, that franc and a half for the sake of which alone many men\r\nstill continued fighting, and which was really one of the primary\r\ncauses, the why and wherefore of the insurrection. Entire districts had\r\nbecome depopulated, the shops were shut, the house-fronts lifeless. And\r\nin the deserted streets under the warm sun of that lovely month of May,\r\nthere was nothing to look at but the funerals of Federals who had been\r\nkilled in action--processions unaccompanied by any priest, but fraught\r\nwith a barbaric pomp, the hearses draped with red flags and followed\r\nby crowds wearing \'button-holes\' of _immortelles_. The churches,\r\nclosed for purposes of worship, became transformed every evening into\r\npolitical club-rooms. Only revolutionary newspapers were published,\r\nall the others had been suppressed. And all this was tantamount to\r\nthe destruction of Paris, that great, ill-fated Paris which, like the\r\nRepublican capital it was, still retained a feeling of repulsion for\r\nthe Assembly, even while its terror of the Commune, and its impatience\r\nto be delivered from it, grew and spread amid all the alarming rumours\r\nthat circulated--rumours of the daily arrest of hostages, and of\r\nbarrels of gunpowder lowered into the sewers, where men were said to\r\nwatch with lighted torches waiting for a signal.\r\n\r\nAnd at this stage Maurice, who hitherto had never been inclined to\r\ndrink, found himself caught and submerged as it were in the universal\r\nintoxication. At present, when he was on duty at some advanced post\r\nor spent the night in a guard-room, it frequently happened that he\r\naccepted a nip of brandy. And if he took a second nip excitement\r\nfollowed, fanned by the breath of his comrades as it blew past his\r\nface, reeking with alcoholic fumes. The drunkenness had become chronic,\r\nan all-invading epidemic, bequeathed by the first siege, aggravated\r\nby the second; for if the population had lacked bread it had always\r\npossessed brandy and wine in profusion, and had so saturated itself\r\nwith drink, that the merest drop now sufficed to make it delirious.\r\nFor the first time in his life, on the evening of Sunday, May 21,\r\nMaurice came back drunk to his lodging in the Rue des Orties, where he\r\nstill slept from time to time. He had again spent the day at Neuilly,\r\nfiring at the Versaillese and drinking with his comrades in the hope\r\nof surmounting the intense weariness which was overpowering him. Then\r\nwith his head in a fog and his limbs exhausted, he had come and thrown\r\nhimself on the bed in his little room, led thither by instinct, for he\r\nnever remembered how he had managed to make the journey. And on the\r\nfollowing morning the sun was already high in the heavens when the\r\ntumult of alarm bells, drums, and bugles at last aroused him. On the\r\nprevious evening, finding a gate of the ramparts at the Point-du-Jour\r\nabandoned, the Versaillese had entered Paris unopposed.\r\n\r\nHastily dressing, and taking his gun, which he slung over his shoulder,\r\nMaurice went down into the street, and, scarcely had he reached the\r\ndistrict municipal offices, when a cluster of scared comrades whom he\r\nmet there acquainted him with the events of the evening and the night,\r\nin so confused a way, however, that it was at first difficult for him\r\nto understand the position. The fort of Issy and the great battery at\r\nMontretout had been pounding away at the ramparts for ten days past,\r\nand with such effect that the St. Cloud gate of the fortifications\r\nhad at last become untenable. An assault had therefore been resolved\r\nupon, and was to have taken place on the morning of May 22. But on\r\nthe afternoon of the 21st, at about five o\'clock, a passer-by, seeing\r\nthat nobody remained guarding the St. Cloud gate, simply beckoned to\r\nthe Versaillese posted in the trenches, which were scarcely fifty\r\nyards away. Two companies of the 37th of the Line thereupon at once\r\nentered the city, and behind them followed the whole of the Fourth\r\nCorps, commanded by General Douay. The troops poured into Paris in a\r\nceaseless stream throughout the night. At seven in the evening General\r\nVerg\xc3\xa9\'s division set out towards the Grenelle bridge, and even pushed\r\nforward as far as the Trocad\xc3\xa9ro. At nine o\'clock General Clinchant\r\ncaptured Passy and La Muette. At three in the morning the First Corps\r\nwas camping in the Bois de Boulogne; and at about the same hour General\r\nBruat\'s division crossed the Seine to carry the S\xc3\xa8vres gate and\r\nfacilitate the entrance of the Second Corps, which, under the orders of\r\nGeneral de Cissey, occupied the Grenelle district an hour later. Thus\r\non the morning of the 22nd the army of Versailles held the Trocad\xc3\xa9ro\r\nand La Muette on the right bank of the river, and Grenelle on the left\r\nbank; and this to the stupor, wrath, and consternation of the Commune,\r\nwhose members were already accusing one another of treachery in their\r\nagony at the idea that annihilation was now inevitable.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was Maurice\'s first feeling when he at last understood the\r\nsituation. The end had come, and no course remained but to meet death\r\nboldly. Meantime, however, the alarm bells were pealing, the drums were\r\nbeating more loudly, women and even children were helping to build\r\nbarricades, and the streets were filling with all the feverish stir and\r\nbustle of the battalions hastily assembled and hurrying to their posts\r\nof combat. And at midday hope again sprang from the breasts of the\r\nexcited, determined soldiers of the Commune when they found that the\r\nVersaillese had scarcely stirred from their positions. This army, which\r\nthey had feared to find at the Tuileries in a couple of hours\' time,\r\nman\xc5\x93uvred with extraordinary caution, profiting by the stern lessons of\r\ndefeat, and exaggerating the tactics which it had learnt at such dire\r\ncost from the Germans.[56] Meantime the Committee of Public Safety, and\r\nDelescluze, the delegate at War, organised and directed the defence\r\nfrom their quarters at the H\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville. It was noised abroad that\r\nthey had disdainfully repulsed a supreme attempt at conciliation. These\r\ntidings inflamed the courage of their partisans; the triumph of Paris\r\nonce more seemed assured, and on all sides the resistance was to be as\r\nfierce as the attack had been implacable--such was the hatred, fed by\r\nlies and atrocities, which burnt in the hearts of either army.\r\n\r\nMaurice spent that day in the neighbourhood of the Champ de Mars and\r\nthe Invalides, falling back slowly from street to street whilst firing\r\nupon the troops. He had not been able to find his own battalion, and\r\nwas fighting in company with some comrades who were strangers to him,\r\nand who had led him to the left bank of the river without his even\r\nnoticing it. Towards four o\'clock they defended a barricade blocking\r\nthe Rue de l\'Universit\xc3\xa9, at the point where it reaches the Esplanade\r\ndes Invalides; and they did not abandon this position until the\r\ntwilight fell and they learned that Bruat\'s division, stealing along\r\nby way of the quay, had secured possession of the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif. As\r\nit was, they narrowly escaped being caught, and only reached the Rue\r\nde Lille with great difficulty, after making a long round through the\r\nRue St. Dominique and the Rue Bellechasse. When night fell the army of\r\nVersailles occupied a line starting from the Vanves gate, on the left\r\nbank of the Seine, and passing by way of the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif across\r\nthe river to the Elys\xc3\xa9e palace, the church of St. Augustin, and the St.\r\nLazare railway station, until it finally reached the Asni\xc3\xa8res gate on\r\nthe north-west.\r\n\r\nIt was the morrow, May 23, a beautiful spring Tuesday, bright with warm\r\nsunshine, which proved the terrible day for Maurice. The few hundred\r\nFederals of various battalions, among whom he found himself, still\r\nheld the whole district from the quay to the Rue St. Dominique. Most\r\nof them, however, had bivouacked in the gardens of the large mansions\r\nlining the Rue de Lille, and he himself had fallen fast asleep on a\r\nlawn adjoining the palace of the Legion of Honour. He fancied that\r\nthe troops would emerge from the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif at dawn to drive\r\nhim and his comrades behind the strong barricades which had been\r\nthrown up in the Rue du Bac, but several hours went by and there were\r\nno signs of an attack. The combatants merely continued exchanging\r\nrandom shots from one to the other end of the streets. All this,\r\nhowever, formed part of the plan of the Versaillese, which was now\r\nbeing slowly, cautiously carried out. Firmly resolved not to attempt\r\na front attack upon the formidable fortress into which the insurgents\r\nhad converted the Tuileries terrace, they had decided upon a double\r\nadvance along the ramparts on either side of the river in view of\r\ncapturing Montmartre on the north and the Observatory on the south to\r\nbegin with, and thence swooping down upon the city, surrounding the\r\ncentral quarters and seizing upon them at one great stroke. Towards two\r\no\'clock Maurice heard a comrade say that the tricolour flag was waving\r\nover Montmartre. Simultaneously attacked by three army corps, whose\r\nbattalions had climbed the height on its northern and western sides,\r\nthe great battery of the Galette windmill had been captured; and the\r\nvictors were now streaming down into Paris, carrying in turn the Place\r\nSt. Georges, the church of Notre Dame de Lorette, the municipal offices\r\nin the Rue Drouot, and the Grand Opera House; whilst on the left bank\r\nthe turning movement, starting from the Montparnasse Cemetery, was\r\nnow reaching the Place d\'Enfer and the Horse Market. At these tidings\r\nof the rapid progress made by the army the Communists gave way to\r\nstupor, wrath, and fright. What! Montmartre had been carried in a\r\ncouple of hours--Montmartre, the glorious, impregnable citadel of the\r\ninsurrection! Maurice noticed that the ranks were thinning around him,\r\nthat trembling comrades were slinking away to wash their hands and slip\r\non a blouse, in their fear of the troops\' reprisals. It was rumoured,\r\ntoo, that they would soon be turned by way of the Croix-Rouge crossway,\r\nthe attack on which was now being prepared. The barricades in the Rue\r\nMartignac and the Rue Bellechasse had already been carried, and the\r\ninsurgents were beginning to espy the red trousers of the soldiers at\r\nthe end of the Rue de Lille. And now the Communist force upon this\r\npoint became limited to the men of conviction, the desperate ones;\r\nMaurice and some fifty others who were resolved to die after killing\r\nas many as possible of those bloodthirsty Versaillese who treated the\r\nFederals as bandits, dragging those whom they made prisoners to the\r\nrear of their line of battle and shooting them down there. Since the\r\nprevious day the execrable feelings of hatred animating either side had\r\nyet increased; it was now a war of extermination between those rebels\r\ndying for their dream, and that army hot with reactionary passions and\r\nexasperated at still having to fight.\r\n\r\nAt about five o\'clock, whilst Maurice and his comrades were finally\r\nretreating to seek the shelter of the barricades in the Rue du Bac,\r\nmaking their way from door to door down the Rue de Lille and still\r\nfiring as they went, the young fellow suddenly perceived a mass of\r\ndense black smoke pouring out of an open window of the palace of the\r\nLegion of Honour. It was the first of the conflagrations kindled\r\nin Paris; and in the furious insanity that now possessed him he\r\nexperienced a fierce delight. The hour had come: might the whole city\r\nflare like a huge sacrificial pyre, might fire purify the world! But\r\nall at once he was overcome with astonishment. Five or six men had just\r\nrushed out of the palace, led by a big fellow in whom he recognised\r\nChouteau, his former comrade in the 106th of the Line. Maurice had\r\ncaught sight of the scamp once before, just after the 18th of March,\r\nwhen he was already wearing the gold-laced cap of an officer. Since\r\nthen he must have risen in rank, for his uniform was now covered\r\nwith galloons. Maybe he was attached to the staff of some Communist\r\ngeneral who shirked fighting; and indeed Maurice suddenly remembered\r\nthat a comrade had told him various anecdotes of this fellow Chouteau,\r\nwho had been quartered at this very palace of the Legion of Honour,\r\nwhere in the company of his mistress he had led a life of continual\r\njollity, lying booted and spurred in the sumptuous beds, and smashing\r\nthe plate-glass mirrors with shots from his revolver just by way of a\r\nlark. It was asserted, too, that his mistress, under pretence of going\r\nto market, drove out every morning in a gala carriage, in which she\r\ncarried away bales of linen, clocks, and even articles of furniture.\r\nThus, when Maurice caught sight of the rogue running away with his men,\r\nand still carrying a can of petroleum, he experienced a sensation of\r\nuneasiness, a frightful doubt, a wavering of all the blind faith which\r\nhad been buoying him up. Was it possible that the great work could be\r\nevil, since it had such a man as Chouteau for its artisan?\r\n\r\nSeveral hours elapsed and still he fought, but in a distressful\r\nfashion, conscious of no feeling save a sombre determination to die.\r\nIf he had erred, might he atone for his error with his blood! The\r\nbarricade at which he found himself barred the Rue de Lille at the\r\npoint where this street was intersected by the Rue du Bac. It was a\r\nformidable one, strongly built of sandbags and barrels of earth and\r\nfaced by a deep ditch. Maurice was holding it with barely a dozen\r\nFederals, all of them reclining among the sandbags, and with unerring\r\naim picking off every soldier who showed himself. Without moving,\r\nwithout even speaking a word, such was the dogged sullenness of his\r\ndespair, the young fellow continued exhausting his cartridges until\r\nnight closed in, watching meantime the growth of the clouds of smoke\r\nwhich were pouring out of the palace of the Legion of Honour, and were\r\nswept down into the street by the wind. The flames were not yet visible\r\nin the waning daylight. Another conflagration had broken out in a\r\nneighbouring mansion. And all at once a comrade ran up to Maurice and\r\nwarned him that the soldiers, not daring to advance down the street,\r\nwere approaching through the gardens and houses skirting it, cutting\r\ntheir way through the walls with picks. The end was at hand; the\r\ntroops might emerge on that very spot at any moment. And, indeed, on a\r\nshot being fired from a window above him, he looked up and again saw\r\nChouteau and his men, who were now frantically climbing the stairs of\r\nthe corner houses on either hand, carrying lighted torches as well as\r\ncans of petroleum. Half an hour later, the whole crossway was flaring\r\nunder the black sky, and Maurice, still reclining behind the barrels\r\nand the bags, profited by the vivid light to shoot down any of the\r\nsoldiers who were imprudent enough to leave the shelter of the doorways\r\nand show themselves in the street.\r\n\r\nHow long did he keep on firing? He no longer had any consciousness\r\nof time or place. It might be nine o\'clock, ten o\'clock perhaps. The\r\nabominable work in which he was engaged now gave him a sensation of\r\nnausea, as though he were drunk with some loathsome wine which kept on\r\nrising from his stomach. Now that the houses were flaming all around,\r\nan intense heat, a burning, asphyxiating atmosphere was beginning to\r\nenvelop him. The crossway, barred on every side by piles of paving\r\nstones, had become an intrenched camp which the conflagrations defended\r\nwith shower after shower of brands. And were not these the orders?\r\nTo set each district on fire as, one by one, its barricades were\r\nabandoned, to check the advance of the troops by a devouring line of\r\nfurnaces, to burn down progressively each portion of Paris which they,\r\nthe insurgents, might be forced to surrender? And Maurice already\r\nrealised that the houses of the Rue du Bac were not the only ones that\r\nwere burning. Behind him an immense ruddy glow suffused the sky, and he\r\ncould hear a distant roar as though the whole city were catching fire.\r\nAlong the Seine, on the right bank, some other gigantic conflagrations\r\nmust be bursting forth. He had long since seen Chouteau hurry away,\r\nfleeing the bullets. One by one, moreover, the most desperate of his\r\ncomrades took themselves off, terrified by the idea that they might\r\nnow at any moment be outflanked; and at last he remained there all\r\nalone, and was still lying between two sandbags with the one thought of\r\ndefending the front of the barricade, when all at once some soldiers,\r\nhaving made their way through the courtyards and gardens of the Rue de\r\nLille, came out by a house in the Rue du Bac and swooped down from the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nFor two long days, amid the excitement of that supreme struggle,\r\nMaurice had not given a thought to Jean; nor had Jean since entering\r\nParis with his regiment, which had been adjoined to General Bruat\'s\r\ndivision, for a single moment remembered his friend Maurice. On\r\nthe previous day, the corporal had spent his time firing upon the\r\ninsurgents on the Champ de Mars and the Esplanade des Invalides; and\r\non this, the second, the terrible day of the fighting, he had not left\r\nthe Place du Palais Bourbon till about noon, when he and his comrades\r\nwere sent forward to capture the barricades of the neighbourhood as\r\nfar as the Rue des Saints-P\xc3\xa8res. He, usually so calm, had gradually\r\nbecome quite exasperated by that fratricidal war, somewhat influenced\r\nin this respect by his comrades, all of whom ardently longed for a\r\nrest after so much fatigue and privation. The men who had spent long\r\nmonths as prisoners of war in Germany, and who had only been brought\r\nback to France to be re-incorporated in the army, felt thoroughly\r\nenraged with Paris; and Jean, for his part, was further incensed by\r\nall that he had heard of the abominations of the Commune--deeds which\r\nstruck at his belief in the rights of ownership, and at his desire for\r\norderly government. He was still the sensible, sober-minded peasant,\r\npersonifying the very foundation of the nation, desirous of peace in\r\norder that one might again begin working, earning money, and recruiting\r\nhealth and strength. And in the growing wrath which now carried away\r\nall thought even of his most tender affections, he was especially\r\nmaddened by the deeds of the incendiaries. What! burn down houses, burn\r\ndown palaces, simply because one was not the stronger; no, no, anything\r\nbut that! Only bandits could do such things. And he, who only the day\r\nbefore had been grieved by the summary executions of the Communists\r\ncaptured by the troops, had now lost all control over himself and was\r\nlike a madman, striking and shouting fiercely, with his eyes starting\r\nfrom their sockets.\r\n\r\nIt was with a rush that he debouched into the Rue du Bac, followed by\r\nthe few men of his squad. At first he could distinguish no one, and\r\nfancied that the barricade had been altogether abandoned. Then, over\r\nyonder, between two sandbags, he caught sight of a Communist who was\r\nmoving, levelling his gun again, about to fire down the Rue de Lille.\r\nAnd, thereupon, under the furious propulsion of Destiny, he ran up and\r\nnailed the man to the barricade with a thrust of his bayonet.\r\n\r\nMaurice had not had time to turn. He gave a shriek and raised his head.\r\nThe conflagrations lighted up both men with a blinding blaze.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! Jean, my old friend, Jean, is it you?\'\r\n\r\nDie? Yes, willingly; he was desperately impatient for death. But to die\r\nby his brother\'s hand was too hard; it marred his death--poisoned it\r\nwith an abominable bitterness.\r\n\r\n\'Is it you then, Jean--my old Jean?\'\r\n\r\nJean looked at him, thunderstruck, abruptly sobered. They were alone;\r\nthe other soldiers had already started in pursuit of some runaways. All\r\naround them the conflagrations were flaring yet higher, the windows\r\nwere vomiting great red flames, and one could hear the crash of the\r\nburning ceilings as they sank inside the houses. Then Jean fell down\r\nnear Maurice, sobbing, feeling him, trying to raise him up so as to\r\nascertain whether he might not still be able to save him.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! my poor youngster, my poor youngster!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF BABYLON--THE BITTER END\r\n\r\nWhen after innumerable stoppages the train coming from Sedan at last\r\nreached the St. Denis station at about nine o\'clock, a great red blaze\r\nwas already lighting up the sky towards the south, as though all Paris\r\nwere on fire. This glow had begun to spread as the night fell and was\r\nnow slowly covering the horizon, ensanguining a flight of little\r\nclouds which were travelling eastward into the gloom which the contrast\r\nrendered more intense.\r\n\r\nHenriette was the very first to spring out of the train, all anxiety at\r\nsight of those fiery reflections, which the passengers had perceived\r\nacross the black fields, from the windows of their carriages, as they\r\ncame nearer and nearer to the capital. Moreover, some Prussian soldiers\r\nwho had occupied the station were compelling everybody to alight,\r\nwhilst a couple of them continued shouting in guttural French: \'Paris\r\nis burning! The train goes no farther, all out here--Paris is burning!\r\nParis is burning!\'\r\n\r\nHenrietta\'s anguish was terrible. Good Heavens! had she arrived too\r\nlate, then? Maurice not having answered her last two letters, the\r\nalarming reports from Paris had filled her with mortal anxiety, and she\r\nhad abruptly made up her mind to leave Remilly. She had been growing\r\nsadder and sadder during the last few months at uncle Fouchard\'s; the\r\nsoldiery occupying the district had become more and more harsh and\r\nexacting as Paris prolonged its resistance; and now that the regiments\r\nwere one by one returning to Germany, the constant passage of troops\r\nagain sorely tried both the towns and the villages. That morning, on\r\nrising at daybreak to go and take the train at Sedan, she had found the\r\ncourtyard of the farm full of cavalry soldiers who had slept there,\r\nlying pell-mell on the ground, wrapped in their long cloaks. They were\r\nso numerous that it was hardly possible to cross the yard. Then, as a\r\nbugle suddenly sounded, they all rose up in silence, draped in the long\r\nfolds of their mantles and in such serried array that she fancied she\r\nwas witnessing some resurrection on a battlefield in response to the\r\ncall of the last trump. And now she found more Prussians at St. Denis\r\ndistressing her with their repeated shouts: \'All out here, the train\r\ngoes no farther; Paris is burning, Paris is burning!\'\r\n\r\nQuite beside herself, Henriette darted out of the carriage carrying her\r\nlittle valise, and asked for information. For two days past fighting\r\nhad been going on in Paris, the railway line was cut, and the Prussians\r\nwere posted on the look-out. Nevertheless she was determined to reach\r\nthe city, and noticing, on the platform, the Prussian captain in\r\ncommand of the company which occupied the station, she ran up to him\r\nand said: \'I wish, to join my brother, whom I am very anxious about,\r\nsir. Enable me to continue my journey I beg of you----\' And then she\r\nstopped short in surprise, for she had just recognised the captain, on\r\nwhose face the light of a gas lamp was falling. \'What! is it you, Otto?\r\nHelp me, I beg of you, since chance has again brought us together.\'\r\n\r\nOtto Gunther--Weiss\'s cousin--had not changed. Tightly buttoned up\r\nin his captain\'s uniform, he was still the same stern, well-groomed,\r\nsmart officer. On his side, he did not at first recognise that slight,\r\nlittle woman with the fair hair and gentle face partially hidden by a\r\ncrape bonnet. But at last, by the brave, frank light of her eyes, he\r\nremembered her and made a gesture of surprise.\r\n\r\n\'You know that I have a brother who is a soldier,\' continued Henriette\r\nin a feverish voice. \'He has remained in Paris, and I am afraid he may\r\nhave become mixed up in that horrible struggle, so I beg of you, Otto,\r\nenable me to continue my journey.\'\r\n\r\nHe then made up his mind to answer: \'But I assure you that I can do\r\nnothing. The trains have not been running since yesterday. I think the\r\nrails have been taken up near the ramparts. And I have neither vehicle\r\nnor horse nor man to drive you----\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, stammering plaintive words in her grief at finding\r\nhim so callous, so determined not to assist her. \'Oh, God! so you won\'t\r\ndo anything? Oh, God! whom shall I apply to?\'\r\n\r\nYet these Prussians were still the all-powerful masters; with a word\r\nthey could have turned the town topsy-turvy, have requisitioned a\r\nhundred vehicles, have caused a thousand horses to be brought from\r\ntheir stables! But nevertheless he refused assistance with that haughty\r\nair of the conqueror whose rule it was not to intervene in the affairs\r\nof the vanquished, deeming them unclean and of a nature to tarnish his\r\nlately won laurels.\r\n\r\n\'At all events,\' resumed Henriette at last, striving to calm\r\nherself--\'at all events you know what is happening, and can surely tell\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nA slight, barely perceptible smile passed over his lips. \'Paris is\r\nburning. Come over here, it can be seen plainly.\'\r\n\r\nHe walked before her, passed out of the station, and followed the rails\r\nfor a hundred paces or so, until they reached a little iron foot-bridge\r\ncrossing the line. And when they had climbed its narrow stairway and\r\nfound themselves up above, leaning over the handrail, the whole vast\r\nlevel plain was spread out before them.\r\n\r\n\'You see, Paris is burning.\'\r\n\r\nIt might have been about half-past nine. The red glow setting the\r\nsky on fire was still spreading. The little ruddy clouds in the east\r\nhad now vanished, and in the zenith all was inky blackness save for\r\noccasional reflections of the distant flames. The whole line of\r\nthe horizon was on fire; but here and there could be distinguished\r\nconflagrations of greater intensity than others, sheaves of bright\r\npurple flames spurting up continuously amid great whirling smoke-clouds\r\nand streaking the darkness with their fearful splendour. And it seemed,\r\ntoo, as though the conflagrations were marching on and on, as though\r\nsome gigantic forest were catching fire from tree to tree, as though\r\nthe earth itself would end by blazing, set alight by that huge pile of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\'There,\' explained Otto, \'that black mass standing out against the red\r\nbackground is Montmartre. Nothing is burning as yet on the left, at La\r\nVillette and Belleville. It is the central quarters which must have\r\nbeen set alight, and the fire keeps on gaining ground. Look there, on\r\nthe right! There\'s another conflagration breaking out! You can see the\r\nflames, a mass of seething flames from which a fiery smoke is rising.\r\nAnd see too, over there are other fires, and others, others still!\'\r\n\r\nHe did not raise his voice or display any excitement, and the\r\nenormity of his quiet delight quite terrified Henriette. Ah! those\r\nPrussians who gazed upon that awful spectacle! She divined all the\r\ninsulting significance of his calmness and his faint smile; they\r\nundoubtedly implied that he had long foreseen and been waiting for this\r\nunparalleled disaster.\r\n\r\nAt last Paris was burning; Paris, whose water-spouts the German shells\r\nhad merely managed to chip off! All his rancour was satisfied now; he\r\nhad his revenge for the inordinate duration of the siege, the bitter\r\ncold, the ever-recurring difficulties of the war, the memory of which\r\nstill filled his countrymen with irritation. Whatever might be the\r\nglory of the triumph, with its conquered provinces and its indemnity\r\nof five milliards, all paled before this spectacle of the destruction\r\nof Paris--Paris seized with furious madness, burning itself down and\r\nflying away in flame and smoke during that clear spring-tide night.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! it was a certainty!\' he added in a lower voice. \'A big business!\'\r\n\r\nAt sight of the immensity of the catastrophe, increasing grief was\r\noppressing Henriette almost to the point of suffocation. For a few\r\nminutes she forgot her personal misfortunes; what were they beside\r\nthis expiation of an entire people? The thought of the human lives\r\nwhich would be destroyed by the devouring flames, the sight of the city\r\nblazing on the horizon, casting around it the hellish glow of accursed\r\ncapitals doomed to destruction for their sins, wrung involuntary cries\r\nof anguish from her heart. Clasping her hands she asked: \'What can we\r\nhave done, O God! to be punished thus?\'\r\n\r\nOtto immediately raised his arm with an apostrophic gesture. He was\r\nabout to speak with all the vehemence of that stern, frigid, military\r\nProtestantism so prone to quoting the Scriptures. But on glancing at\r\nthe young woman and meeting her beautiful, clear, reasoning eyes, he\r\nstayed his tongue. Besides, his gesture had sufficed; it had expressed\r\nall his racial hatred, his conviction that he was there in France as a\r\njusticiar sent by the God of Battles to chastise a perverted people.\r\nParis was burning in punishment of its centuries of evil life, its long\r\ncareer of crime and lust. Once again would the Teutons save the world,\r\nsweeping away the final specks of Latin corruption.\r\n\r\nHe let his arm fall and simply said: \'It is the end of everything.\r\nAnother district is lighting up, over there, on the left--you see it,\r\ndon\'t you?--that long line spreading out like a stream of live embers.\'\r\n\r\nThen both ceased speaking; a terrified silence prevailed. Waves of\r\nflame were now incessantly rising, streaming and spurting high into\r\nthe heavens. Not a moment went by but that sea of fire extended its\r\nlimits--an incandescent tossing, billowy ocean it was, with smoke\r\narising from its midst, and gathering over the city in a huge, dark\r\ncoppery pall, which a faint wind wafted across the black night. And as\r\nit slowly travelled across the sky it barred the vault above with an\r\nabominable rain of soot and cinders.\r\n\r\nAll at once Henriette started as though awakening from a nightmare;\r\nand, again seized with anguish at the thought of her brother, she for\r\nthe last time addressed the captain in a tone of entreaty: \'So you can\r\ndo nothing for me; you refuse to help me to get into Paris?\'\r\n\r\nWith another wave of his arm Otto swept the horizon. \'What would it\r\navail you, since there will be nothing but ruins left there to-morrow\r\nmorning?\'\r\n\r\nAnd that was all; without even saying a word of farewell she\r\ndescended from the foot-bridge, fleeing with her little valise; whilst\r\nhe remained there motionless for a long time yet, his slim, stiff\r\nfigure barely distinguishable in the darkness, as with a sensation of\r\nmonstrous enjoyment he feasted his eyes upon that spectacle of Babylon\r\nin flames.\r\n\r\nAs Henriette was leaving the station she was lucky enough to come\r\nacross a stout woman who had just arranged with a flyman to drive her\r\ninto Paris; and Henriette pleaded so piteously and shed such touching\r\ntears that this person at last consented to take her with her. The\r\nflyman, a dark little fellow, whipped up his horse and drove them\r\naway without opening his lips during the whole journey. The stout\r\nwoman, however, did not cease chattering, telling Henriette that on\r\nclosing and leaving her shop in the Rue de Richelieu a couple of days\r\npreviously she had unwisely left some shares and debentures there, in\r\na secret hiding-place in a wall. And as a natural consequence, ever\r\nsince the city had begun flaming a couple of hours previously, she\r\nhad been possessed by the desire to go back again, and secure those\r\nvaluable papers, even though she might have to march through the fire\r\nto do so. When they reached the city gate, where they found a party\r\nof sleepy National Guards, the vehicle was allowed to pass on without\r\nmuch difficulty, especially as the stout woman unblushingly declared\r\nthat she had merely been to St. Denis to fetch her niece to assist her\r\nin nursing her husband, who had been wounded by the Versaillese. Once\r\nin the Paris streets, however, they encountered terrible obstacles;\r\nat each moment they came upon barricades barring the roadways and\r\nwere obliged to take a circuitous course. At last, on reaching the\r\nBoulevard Poissonni\xc3\xa8re the driver would go no further, and the two\r\nwomen were forced to continue their journey on foot, along the Rue\r\ndu Sentier and the Rue des Je\xc3\xbbneurs and through the district of the\r\nBourse. Whilst they were drawing near to the fortifications, the fiery\r\nsky had illumined their road with as vivid a light as that of daytime.\r\nAnd therefore, in the quarter of the city which they had now reached\r\nthey were astonished to find the streets dim and deserted, with nothing\r\nto disturb their stillness save the vague echo of a distant roar.\r\nNear the Bourse, however, they heard some reports of fire-arms, and\r\nhad to glide along cautiously close beside the house-fronts. And when\r\nthey reached the Rue de Richelieu and the stout woman found her shop\r\nstanding, altogether undamaged, she was so delighted that she insisted\r\nupon showing Henriette her way along the Rue du Hasard and the Rue\r\nSainte-Anne. In the latter street, which a battalion of Federals still\r\noccupied, some of the men would not at first allow them to pass, and\r\nit was four o\'clock and already light, when Henriette, exhausted with\r\nemotion and fatigue, at last reached the old house in the Rue des\r\nOrties and found its door wide open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaurice, meantime, on the barricade of the Rue du Bac, had managed\r\nto raise himself to his knees between the two sandbags, and Jean,\r\nwho feared that he had pinned him to the ground, was suddenly buoyed\r\nup again by hope. \'Are you still alive, my poor youngster?\' said he.\r\n\'Shall I have that luck, dirty brute that I am? Wait a moment, let me\r\nlook at you.\'\r\n\r\nThen, by the vivid light of the conflagrations, he cautiously examined\r\nthe wound. The bayonet had transpierced the arm near the right\r\nshoulder, and the misfortune was that it had afterwards entered the\r\nbody between two of the ribs, and had probably injured the lung. Still,\r\nthe wounded man, whose arm hung down, inert, was apparently able to\r\nbreathe without any great difficulty.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t distress yourself like that, my poor old fellow,\' said Maurice.\r\n\'I am quite content to die; I would rather have done with it all. You\r\ndid quite enough for me whilst we were together. Had it not been for\r\nyou I should long since have died like this by the roadside.\'\r\n\r\nOn hearing him speak in this fashion, Jean was again seized with\r\nviolent grief: \'Will you be quiet? You saved me twice from the clutches\r\nof the Prussians. It was my turn to risk my life for you, and here\r\nI\'ve been and massacred you. Thunder! I must have been fuddled not to\r\nrecognise you, fuddled like a hog with having drunk too much blood.\'\r\n\r\nTears had started from his eyes at memory of their leave-taking\r\nover yonder at Remilly, that parting when they had asked each other\r\nwhether they would ever meet again, and if so where and under what\r\ncircumstances of grief or joy. Had they, then, spent so many hungry\r\ndays and sleepless nights together, with death staring them in the\r\nface, all to no avail? Had their hearts mingled during those weeks\r\nof valorous life simply that all might end in this abomination, this\r\nmonstrous, senseless fratricide? No, no, Jean\'s heart revolted at the\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\'Let me see to it, youngster,\' said he; \'I _must_ save you.\'\r\n\r\nFirst of all he must take him away, for the troops finished off all the\r\nwounded insurgents they found. They were alone together, fortunately;\r\nstill there was not a moment to be lost. Taking his knife, he quickly\r\nripped open the sleeve of Maurice\'s uniform, and took the garment off\r\nhim. Blood was flowing, so he made all haste to bandage the arm firmly\r\nwith some strips of lining which he tore away from the tunic he had\r\nremoved. Next he plugged the body-wound and fastened the arm tightly\r\nover it with a bit of cord which he fortunately found in his pocket.\r\nBarbarous as was this dressing, it was effective, for it rendered the\r\ninjured parts immovable and prevented h\xc3\xa6morrhage.\r\n\r\n\'Can you walk?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think so.\'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Jean did not dare to lead him away like that in his\r\nshirt-sleeves. And a sudden inspiration coming to him he ran off into\r\nan adjacent street, where he had seen the corpse of a soldier lying,\r\nand speedily came back with a military great-coat and cap. He threw the\r\nformer upon Maurice\'s shoulders, and helped him to pass his uninjured\r\narm through the left sleeve. Then, when he had set the cap upon his\r\nhead, he exclaimed: \'There, now you are one of us! Where shall we go?\'\r\n\r\nThat was the question, and all Jean\'s anguish of mind returned again\r\njust as he was awakening to hope and courage. Where could he find a\r\nsecure shelter-place? The houses were searched; all the Communists\r\ntaken with arms in their hands or whose appearance indicated that they\r\nhad been fighting were summarily shot. Moreover, neither of them knew a\r\nsoul in that neighbourhood to whom they might apply for shelter, or any\r\nsafe place in which they might hide their heads. \'After all, my room\r\nwould be the best,\' at last said Maurice; \'the house is in a retired\r\nspot, and nobody is likely to come there. But it is on the other side\r\nof the river, in the Rue des Orties.\'\r\n\r\nIn his irresolution and despair Jean continued mumbling oaths:\r\n\'Thunder! how can we manage it?\'\r\n\r\nIt was no use to think of crossing the Pont-Royal, which the\r\nconflagrations were lighting up as with a vivid noontide glow. On\r\nthis point shots were at every moment being fired from either bank of\r\nthe river. And besides, once across this bridge, they would have run\r\nagainst an impassable barrier--the Tuileries in flames, and the Louvre\r\nguarded and barricaded.\r\n\r\n\'Then we are done for; there\'s no means of crossing,\' declared Jean,\r\nwho knew something of Paris, having lived there for six months or so on\r\nhis return from the Italian war.[57]\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, an idea occurred to him. If, as in former times,\r\nthere were any boats moored at the water\'s edge near the Pont-Royal,\r\nthey might embark in one of them, and in this wise cross the river.\r\nIt would be a long and dangerous job, and by no means an easy one;\r\nbut they had no choice in the matter, and must make up their minds at\r\nonce. \'Listen, youngster,\' said Jean; \'let\'s get away from here at any\r\nrate; it\'s a dangerous spot. I shall account for my absence by telling\r\nmy lieutenant that the Communards captured me, but that I managed to\r\nescape.\'\r\n\r\nGrasping Maurice\'s uninjured arm, he helped him to walk to the end of\r\nthe Rue du Bac, between the burning houses, which were now flaring\r\nfrom basement to garret like so many huge torches. A shower of burning\r\nbrands fell upon them as they passed along, and the heat was so intense\r\nthat all the hair upon their faces was singed. And when they came out\r\non the quay, they stopped short for a moment, fairly blinded by the\r\nfrightful blaze of the conflagrations, which were throwing up huge\r\nsheaves of flame upon both banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no lack of candles,\' growled Jean, worried by this broad light.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was only when he had helped Maurice down the steps leading\r\nto the shore, just below the Pont-Royal, that he felt tolerably safe.\r\nHere, at the water\'s edge, there was a clump of big trees which\r\nscreened them from view, and during nearly a quarter of an hour they\r\nremained on this spot anxiously watching some black, shadowy forms\r\nwhich were flitting hither and thither on the quay across the river.\r\nShots were being fired; all at once a loud shriek resounded, and then\r\nthey heard a plunge, followed by a sudden spurt of foam. Plainly enough\r\nthe bridge was guarded.\r\n\r\n\'Suppose we spend the night in that shanty,\' suggested Maurice,\r\npointing to a wooden hut used as an office of the navigation service.\r\n\r\n\'Pooh! we should be caught to-morrow morning,\' said Jean, who clung to\r\nhis idea. He had found there quite a flotilla of little boats, but\r\nthey were moored to the quay by means of padlocked chains; and how\r\nwould he be able to detach one of them and also procure some oars?\r\nAt last he luckily found an old pair of sculls, and was even able to\r\nforce open a padlock, which had no doubt been imperfectly secured.\r\nThereupon, after helping Maurice to lie down in the bow of the boat, he\r\ncautiously shoved off, hugging the shore, in the shadow of the swimming\r\nbaths and the pinnaces. Neither of them spoke, terrified as they were\r\nby the awful spectacle which now unfolded itself. The horror seemed\r\nto increase as they slowly floated down the stream and their horizon\r\nwidened. By the time they had reached the Solferino bridge they could\r\nat one glance behold both flaming quays.\r\n\r\nOn the left, the Tuileries was burning. The Communists had fired both\r\nends of the palace, the Pavillon de Flore and the Pavillon de Marsan,\r\nat nightfall; and the flames were now rapidly gaining the central\r\nPavillon de l\'Horloge, where a formidable mine had been prepared,\r\nbarrels upon barrels of gunpowder being piled up in the Hall of the\r\nMarshals. At this moment the intervening buildings were belching from\r\ntheir shattered windows great whirling coils of ruddy smoke, through\r\nwhich darted blue flakes of fire. The roofs were kindling, riddled with\r\nfiery crevices, and opening like volcanic soil as the brazier within\r\nassailed them. No other portion of the palace, however, burnt like the\r\nPavillon de Flore,[58] where the torch had been first applied, and\r\nwhich was flaring away, with a formidable roar, from its ground floor\r\nto its lofty roof. The petroleum with which the floorings and the\r\nhangings had been soaked imparted such intensity to the flames that the\r\niron work of the massive balconies could be seen writhing and twisting,\r\nwhilst the monumental chimneys, with their great sculptured suns,\r\nbecame red hot and burst asunder.\r\n\r\nThen, on the right bank, came first of all the palace of the Legion of\r\nHonour, set on fire at five o\'clock in the evening. It had now been\r\nalight for nearly seven hours, and was being consumed by a great blaze,\r\nlike some huge pile of wood, every log of which is kindled, and fast\r\nburning to ashes. Next came the palace of the Council of State, the\r\nmost enormous, the most frightful of those immense conflagrations,\r\nthe whole gigantic parallelogram of stone, with its two colonnaded\r\nstoreys, vomiting flame upon flame of lurid fire. The four blocks of\r\nbuilding encompassing the spacious interior courtyard had been ignited\r\nat one and the same moment, and the petroleum poured by the cask-full\r\nupon the four staircases at the four corners had streamed down them,\r\nrolling perfect torrents of hell-fire from the highest to the lowest\r\nstep. On the fa\xc3\xa7ade overlooking the river, the sharp line of the attic\r\nstorey stood out blackly above the red tongues of flame which were\r\nlicking its base; whilst the colonnades, the entablatures, the friezes,\r\nall the sculptured ornaments acquired startling vividness amid the\r\nblinding furnace-like glow beneath. Here especially there was such a\r\nrage, such a strength of fire, that the colossal monument was as though\r\nupheaved, and quaked and rumbled on its foundations; only the carcase\r\nof its massive walls being able to withstand this eruptive violence,\r\nwhich hurled the zinc of the roofs towards the sky. Then, near at hand,\r\nwas the Orsay barracks, a whole side of which was burning in a lofty\r\nwhite column like a tower of light. And in the rear there were yet\r\nother conflagrations, seven houses in the Rue du Bac, two-and-twenty\r\nhouses in the Rue de Lille, all setting the horizon aglow, with flames\r\nrising up in relief against other flames, in a sanguinary, endless sea\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\n\'Good Lord, can it be possible!\' muttered Jean, with a grip at his\r\nthroat; \'the river itself will soon catch alight!\'\r\n\r\nIt already seemed, indeed, as though the boat were floating down a\r\nburning stream. With the reflections of those huge braziers dancing\r\nin the water, it might have been thought that the Seine was rolling\r\nlive coals. Red flashes darted fitfully over its surface, amid a great\r\nrippling of yellow brands. And they were still slowly going down stream\r\nbetween the flaming palaces, carried on by the current of that fiery\r\nwater, as though journeying through some accursed city, burning upon\r\neither side of a highway of molten lava.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Maurice in his turn, struck with madness again, at sight of\r\nthe havoc he had longed for. \'May everything blaze and everything blow\r\nup!\'\r\n\r\nBut Jean silenced him with a gesture of terror as though he feared\r\nthat such blasphemy might bring them misfortune. Was it possible that\r\nthis young fellow whom he was so fond of, who was so highly educated,\r\nwho had formerly displayed such delicate susceptibility, could have\r\ncome to entertain such ideas as these? And he rowed on faster, for by\r\nthis time he had passed the Solferino bridge, and found himself in a\r\nbroad open space of water. The light had now become so intense that\r\nit seemed as though the river were illumined by the midday sunrays\r\nstreaming down from overhead without casting a shadow. The pettiest\r\ndetails could be distinguished with wonderful precision--the ripples of\r\nthe water, the heaps of gravel on the banks, the little trees planted\r\nalong the quays. And the bridges shone out with a dazzling whiteness,\r\nso distinct that you might have counted their very stones. They looked\r\nlike narrow gangways as yet undamaged, thrown across the fiery water\r\nfrom one conflagration to the other. Every now and then a loud crash\r\nwould resound amid the continuous, roaring clamour. Squalls of soot\r\nwere sweeping down; the wind was laden with pestiferous stenches. And\r\nthe terror of it all was that Paris--the distant districts yonder along\r\nthe Seine--had disappeared. The conflagrations on either hand blazed\r\nwith such fierce, dazzling resplendency that beyond them, upstream and\r\ndownstream alike, all was a black abyss. Only an enormous darkness,\r\nnihility, could be seen, as though the fire had already reached and\r\ndevoured all the rest of Paris, as though the city had already vanished\r\ninto eternal night. And the sky too was obliterated, destroyed; the\r\nflames climbed so high that they extinguished the stars.\r\n\r\nExcited by the delirium of fever, Maurice raised a wild laugh: \'A fine\r\n_f\xc3\xaate_ at the Council of State and the Tuileries! The fa\xc3\xa7ades have been\r\nilluminated, the chandeliers are sparkling, and the women dance. Ah!\r\ndance, dance in your smouldering skirts and your flaming chignons!\'\r\nWith a wave of his uninjured arm he evoked the gala gatherings of\r\nSodom and Gomorrah, the music, the flowers, the monstrous pleasures,\r\nthe palaces bursting with such lust and debauchery, illumining their\r\nabominations with such a wealth of tapers that they set themselves\r\nablaze! All at once there was a frightful uproar. It was the fire,\r\ncoming from either end of the Tuileries, which was at last reaching the\r\nHall of the Marshals.[59] The barrels of gunpowder caught alight, and\r\nthe Pavillon de l\'Horloge blew up with the violence of a powder-mill.\r\nAn immense sheaf of fire arose, a plume which waved and spread over the\r\nblack sky--the flaming \'bouquet\' of those frightful fireworks.\r\n\r\n\'Bravo, dancers!\' cried Maurice, as at the end of a spectacular\r\nperformance when all becomes dark on the stage again.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in distracted phrases, did Jean stammeringly beseech him\r\nnot to talk like that. No, no! one should never wish for evil. If this\r\nwere the end of everything, would not they themselves perish? And he\r\nwas now all eagerness to land and escape the terrible spectacle. Still\r\nhe prudently rowed on until they had passed the Concorde bridge, so\r\nas to put into shore below the Quai de la Conf\xc3\xa9rence, beyond the bend\r\nof the Seine. And at that critical moment, instead of allowing the\r\nboat to drift away, he lost some minutes in mooring it, such was his\r\ninstinctive respect for other people\'s property. His plan was to reach\r\nthe Rue des Orties by way of the Place de la Concorde and the Rue St.\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9. After making Maurice sit down on the shore, he climbed the\r\nsteps of the quay to examine the surroundings, and was again seized\r\nwith anxiety on realising the difficulty they would have to surmount\r\nall the obstacles assembled together on that point. Here indeed was\r\nthe fortress which the Commune had deemed impregnable, the Tuileries\r\nterrace bristling with cannon, the Rue Royale, the Rue St. Florentin,\r\nand the Rue de Rivoli barred by lofty, massively built barricades. And\r\nthe spectacle explained the tactics that had been adopted by the army\r\nof Versailles, whose lines that night formed an immense arc, having the\r\nPlace de la Concorde for its vertex, and starting, on the right bank of\r\nthe river, from the goods station of the Northern Railway Company, and\r\non the left bank from a bastion of the ramparts near the Arcueil gate.\r\nDawn, however, would now soon be rising, the Communists had evacuated\r\nthe Tuileries and the barricades, and the troops had just taken\r\npossession of the district in the midst of other conflagrations--twelve\r\nmore houses which had been burning ever since nine in the evening at\r\nthe crossway of the Faubourg St. Honor\xc3\xa9 and the Rue Royale.\r\n\r\nWhen Jean descended to the shore again he found Maurice drowsy,\r\nstupefied as it were by the reaction following upon his delirious\r\noutburst. \'It won\'t be easy,\' said the corporal. \'Can you still walk,\r\nyoungster?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, don\'t worry; I shall always get there, dead or alive.\'\r\n\r\nHe had considerable difficulty, however, in climbing the stone steps;\r\nand once up above, on the quay, leaning on his companion\'s arm, he\r\nwalked on slowly with the step of a somnambulist. Although the\r\ndaylight was not yet breaking, a kind of livid dawn--the light cast\r\nby the neighbouring conflagrations--illumined the vast Place. It was\r\nsilent, deserted, and they crossed it with their hearts oppressed\r\nby the mournful spectacle of havoc they beheld. Beyond the Concorde\r\nbridge, and at the farther end of the Rue Royale, they could dimly\r\ndiscern the phantom-like piles of the Palais Bourbon and the Madeleine,\r\nbattered by the cannonade. A portion of the Tuileries terrace also had\r\nfallen, breached by the guns. On the Place itself the bronze tritons,\r\nnaiads, and dolphins of the fountains had been riddled with bullets,\r\nthe colossal trunk of the statue of Lille lay upon the pavement, cut\r\nin halves by a shell; whilst the crape-veiled statue of Strasburg,\r\nnear at hand, seemed to be mourning the ruin which surrounded it And\r\nin a trench, near the uninjured obelisk, there was a broken gas pipe,\r\nwhich had accidentally caught fire, and whence a long jet of flame was\r\nspurting with a strident sound.\r\n\r\nJean was careful not to approach the barricade blocking the\r\nentry of the Rue Royale, between the Ministry of Marine and the\r\nGarde-Meuble,[60] both of which had been preserved from the fire. He\r\ncould hear the gruff voices of soldiers behind the barrels of earth\r\nand the sandbags of which this barricade was constructed. Its front\r\nwas defended by a ditch, full of stagnant water, on which the corpse\r\nof a Federal was floating, and through an embrasure one could perceive\r\nthe houses of the St. Honor\xc3\xa9 crossway still burning in spite of the\r\nfire-pumps[61] which had come in from the suburbs, and whose snorting\r\ncould be plainly heard. To right and left, the little trees and the\r\nkiosks of the news vendors were broken, riddled with bullets, and all\r\nat once loud cries of horror arose, for, on descending into a cellar,\r\nthe firemen had there discovered the charred corpses of seven inmates\r\nof one of the burning houses.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lofty, skilfully built barricade barring the Rue St.\r\nFlorentin and the Rue de Rivoli appeared yet more formidable than the\r\nother one, Jean somehow instinctively divined that it would be less\r\ndifficult for him and Maurice to pass that way. Indeed, the barricade\r\nwas evacuated, although the troops had not yet dared to occupy it.\r\nHeavy guns were slumbering there in abandonment. There was not a living\r\nthing left behind that invincible rampart, save a stray dog, which ran\r\noff in alarm. However, whilst Jean was hastily walking up the Rue St.\r\nFlorentin sustaining Maurice, who had become very weak, his fears were\r\nsuddenly realised, for they came upon a company of the 88th of the Line\r\nwhich had turned the barricade.\r\n\r\n\'Sir,\' said Jean to the captain, \'this is a comrade of mine whom those\r\nbrigands have wounded. I\'m taking him to the ambulance.\'\r\n\r\nThe military great-coat thrown over Maurice\'s shoulders saved him, and\r\nJean\'s heart was beating almost to the point of bursting as they at\r\nlast turned into the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9, along which they took their way.\r\nThe dawn was scarcely breaking as yet, and the reports of fire-arms\r\nfrequently resounded in the side streets, for fighting was still going\r\non throughout the district. By a miracle, however, they managed to\r\nreach the corner of the Rue des Frondeurs without any other unpleasant\r\nmeeting. And now they made way but slowly; those last three or four\r\nhundred yards seemed to be interminable. Whilst going up the Rue des\r\nFrondeurs they fell in with a band of Communards, who fortunately took\r\nto their heels in alarm, fancying that an entire regiment was at hand.\r\nAnd then they only had to take a few steps along the Rue d\'Argenteuil\r\nto find themselves at last in the Rue des Orties.\r\n\r\nAh! that Rue des Orties! with what feverish impatience had Jean been\r\nlonging to reach it during four interminable hours! It seemed to\r\nthem like deliverance when they entered it at last. It was black,\r\ndeserted, and silent, as though a hundred leagues away from the field\r\nof fratricidal battle. The house where Maurice lived, an old, narrow,\r\nlofty building, where there was no door-porter, was fast asleep, as\r\nstill as the grave.\r\n\r\n\'The keys are in my trousers pocket,\' stammered Maurice, \'the big one\r\nis that of the street-door, the little one opens my room, right at the\r\ntop of the stairs.\'\r\n\r\nThen he was overcome, and fainted away in the arms of Jean, whose\r\nanxiety and embarrassment were extreme. He was so upset, indeed, that\r\nhe forgot to shut the street-door after him. And then he had to grope\r\nhis way up those strange stairs, carrying Maurice in his arms and\r\nstriving not to stumble for fear lest the noise should bring some of\r\nthe lodgers to their doors. Then, up above, he lost himself, and had to\r\nseat the wounded man on a stair, and search for the door of his room\r\nwith the help of some matches which he fortunately had about him. And\r\nwhen he had at last found the door and opened it, he came back to fetch\r\nMaurice, and carried him off, and laid him on the little iron bedstead,\r\nin front of the window, overlooking Paris, which he threw wide open in\r\nhis need of air and light. The dawn was now breaking, and he dropped\r\nupon his knees beside the bed, sobbing, stunned, and strengthless, as\r\nthe fearful thought awoke within him that he had killed his friend.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes must have elapsed, and, when he looked up, he hardly\r\nfelt any surprise at beholding Henriette. After all, it was perfectly\r\nnatural; her brother was dying, and she had come. He had not even\r\nseen her enter the room; for all he knew, she might have been there\r\nfor hours. And now, sinking upon a chair, he watched her as she\r\ndistractedly hovered here and there, stricken with mortal grief at\r\nsight of her brother lying on that bed, unconscious and covered with\r\nblood. Then all at once Jean\'s memory came back to him and he asked:\r\n\'Did you shut the street-door after you?\'\r\n\r\nShe could not speak, her emotion was too great, but she nodded her head\r\naffirmatively; and then, as she at last stepped up to him to place her\r\nhands in his, in the need she felt of affection and help, he again\r\nspoke: \'You know, it was I who killed him.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not understand, did not believe him. He felt her little hands\r\nlying calmly in his own.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it was I who killed him--Yes, on a barricade over yonder. He was\r\nfighting on one side and I on the other.\'\r\n\r\nThe little hands began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\'We were all mad drunk as it were; we none of us knew what we were\r\ndoing--and it was I who killed him.\'\r\n\r\nThen Henriette, quivering and ghastly pale, gazing at him fixedly with\r\neyes of terror, withdrew her hands. O God! was everything to perish,\r\nwould nothing survive in her crushed heart? Ah! that Jean, she had been\r\nthinking of him that very evening, happy in the vague hope that she\r\nmight perhaps see him again. And it was he who had done that abominable\r\nthing; and yet he had again saved Maurice, since it was he who had\r\nbrought him thither through so many dangers. She could no longer place\r\nher hands in his without a revolt of her whole being; but she raised a\r\ncry in which rang out the last hope of her warring heart: \'Oh! I will\r\ncure him, I must cure him _now_!\'\r\n\r\nShe had become very expert in nursing and dressing wounds during her\r\nlong vigils at the ambulance of Remilly. And she at once wished to\r\nexamine her brother, whom she undressed without rousing him from his\r\nfainting fit. But while she was unfastening the rude bandage, which\r\nJean had devised, the young fellow began to stir, raising a faint cry\r\nas he opened his big feverish eyes. He at once recognised her and\r\nsmiled at her: \'So you are here! Ah! how glad I am to see you again\r\nbefore I die!\'\r\n\r\nShe silenced him with a loving gesture of confidence. \'Die, no, I won\'t\r\nlet you die, I mean you to live. Don\'t talk, let me attend to you.\'\r\n\r\nHer face became clouded, however, and her eyes grew dim when she had\r\nexamined his transpierced arm and injured ribs. Then, taking possession\r\nof the room, she searched about till she found a little oil, and began\r\ntearing some old shirts into bands, whilst Jean went down to fill\r\na pitcher with water. He, poor fellow, no longer spoke a word, but\r\nwatched her whilst she washed the wounds and skilfully dressed them,\r\nquite incapable of helping her, altogether annihilated as it were\r\nsince her arrival. However, he observed her anxiety, and when she had\r\nfinished he offered to go and fetch a doctor. But she had an acute\r\nperception of the position: no, no, not the first chance doctor, who\r\nmight perhaps betray her brother. Then at last, upon Jean talking of\r\nrejoining his regiment, it was agreed that he should return as soon as\r\nhe could manage and endeavour to bring a doctor with him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he did not take himself off; it was as though he could\r\nnot make up his mind to leave that room, where all told of his unhappy\r\ndeed. After being closed for a moment, the window had again been\r\nopened, and the wounded man, lying in bed, with his head propped up by\r\npillows, could gaze out upon the roofs of Paris, whither the glances of\r\nthe others also strayed, in the heavy silence which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nFrom that height of the Butte des Moulins one half of the city lay\r\nstretched out below them--first, the central districts from the\r\nFaubourg St. Honor\xc3\xa9 to the Bastille, then the long sweep of the Seine\r\nand the distant buildings swarming on its left bank, a sea of roofs,\r\ntree-tops, steeples, domes and towers. The light was now growing\r\nstronger; the abominable night, one of the most frightful in history,\r\nwas ended. But in the pure light of the rising sun, under the rosy\r\nsky, the fires continued blazing. In front of them they could see the\r\nTuileries, which was still burning, the Orsay barracks, the palaces of\r\nthe Council of State and the Legion of Honour, the flames from which,\r\npaling in the broad light, imparted a great quivering as it were to the\r\nheavens. And beyond the houses of the Rue de Lille and the Rue du Bac,\r\nother houses must now be flaring, for pillars of flakes were rising\r\nfrom the crossway of the Croix-Rouge, and from the Rue Vavin and the\r\nRue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, yet farther away. Close by, on the right,\r\nthe conflagrations of the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 were running their course,\r\nwhilst on the left the fires tardily kindled at the Palais-Royal\r\nand the new Louvre, where the torch had not been applied until near\r\nmorning, were prematurely dying out. And, at first, neither Maurice\r\nnor Jean could account for some thick black smoke which the westerly\r\nbreeze was slowly driving past the window. Since three in the morning,\r\nhowever, the Ministry of Finances in the Rue de Rivoli had also been\r\nburning. No lofty flames shot up from it, everything was turning into\r\ndense, whirling masses of soot, so prodigious was the collection of\r\npapers of all kinds gathered together there, under the low ceilings\r\nof the lath-and-plaster partitioned rooms. And thus, if the tragic\r\nimpression of the night--the fear of total destruction, the Seine\r\nrolling live embers and Paris blazing at its four corners--had passed\r\naway when the great city awoke, there was in lieu thereof a dreary,\r\ndespair-fraught gloominess hanging over the districts that had yet been\r\nspared, a gloominess which slowly travelled along with that dense,\r\ncontinuous, ever-spreading smoke-cloud from the Ministry of Finances.\r\nAnd presently, the sun, which had risen bright and clear, was hidden by\r\nthe cloud, and only that pall of mourning could be seen aloft in the\r\ntawny sky.\r\n\r\nWith a slow wave of the hand which embraced the boundless horizon,\r\nMaurice, again delirious, muttered: \'Is everything burning? Ah! how\r\nlong it takes!\'\r\n\r\nTears were welling in Henriette\'s eyes as though her burden of misery\r\nwere rendered yet heavier by those immense disasters in which her\r\nbrother had his share. And Jean, who dared neither take her hand again,\r\nnor even embrace his friend, thereupon hurried off like one who is\r\nlosing his senses. \'Good-bye; I will be back soon.\'\r\n\r\nHe was only able to return, however, in the evening at about eight\r\no\'clock, after night had fallen. In spite of his great anxiety he was\r\nin some measure happy, for his regiment was no longer taking any part\r\nin the fighting, but had been transferred from the first to the second\r\nline, with orders to guard this very district. His company camping on\r\nthe Place du Carrousel, he hoped that he would be able to run up every\r\nevening to see how Maurice was getting on. And he did not come back\r\nalone; as luck would have it, he had met the surgeon-major of his old\r\nregiment, the 106th, and having failed to find any other doctor he\r\nbrought this one with him, reflecting that this terrible man with the\r\nlion\'s head was, after all, a good and worthy fellow.\r\n\r\nWhen Bouroche, not knowing what wounded man it was whom the corporal so\r\npressingly begged him to succour, and growling at having had to climb\r\nso many flights of stairs, realised that he had a Communard before him,\r\nhe at first flew into a violent passion: \'Thunder! Are you playing\r\nthe fool with me? Brigands who are weary of thieving, murdering, and\r\nburning! That bandit\'s affair is clear enough; I\'ll cure him precious\r\nquick, yes, with three bullets in his head!\'\r\n\r\nBut on perceiving Henriette, so intensely pale in her black dress,\r\nand with her lovely fair hair falling over her shoulders, he suddenly\r\nbecame calm again. \'It is my brother, sir,\' said she; \'he was one of\r\nyour soldiers at Sedan.\'\r\n\r\nBouroche did not answer, but uncovered the wounds and examined them\r\nin silence; then, taking some phials from his pocket, he made a fresh\r\ndressing, explaining to the young woman what she would have to do.\r\nAnd then, in his gruff voice, he all at once asked the wounded man:\r\n\'Why were you on the side of those ruffians? Why did you do such an\r\nabominable thing?\'\r\n\r\nMaurice had been gazing at him with glittering eyes, but without\r\npronouncing a word. And now, amid his fever, he answered in a burning\r\nvoice: \'Because there is too much suffering in the world; too much\r\niniquity and too much shame!\'\r\n\r\nBouroche waved his arm as though to say that such ideas might carry\r\na man very far indeed. Then he seemed to be on the point of speaking\r\nagain, but decided to hold his peace. And as he went out he simply\r\nadded: \'I will come back again.\'\r\n\r\nOn the landing, however, he told Henriette plainly that he could answer\r\nfor nothing. The lung was seriously injured, and h\xc3\xa6morrhage might\r\nsupervene and kill the wounded man in a moment. When Henriette returned\r\ninto the room she strove to smile, despite the blow which the doctor\'s\r\nwords had dealt her in the heart. Would she not save him, would she not\r\nprevent that frightful thing, the eternal separation of all three of\r\nthem, now gathered together in that chamber and ardently longing for\r\nlife? Throughout the day she had not once left the little room, an old\r\nwoman occupying a neighbouring attic having obligingly undertaken her\r\nerrands. And now she came and resumed her seat on a chair beside the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nGiving way, however, to his feverish excitement, Maurice had begun\r\nto question Jean, anxious to learn what was happening. The corporal\r\ndid not tell him everything; he avoided all allusion to the furious\r\nwrath which was rising up against the expiring Commune throughout\r\ndelivered Paris. It was now Wednesday, and for two long days, since\r\nthe Sunday evening, the inhabitants had been living in their cellars\r\nquaking with fear. And on the Wednesday morning, when they were at\r\nlast able to venture out, the spectacle they beheld--the streets torn\r\nup, the remnants of barricades, the corpses, the pools of blood, and\r\nespecially the awful conflagrations--inflamed them with vengeful fury.\r\nThe chastisement was to prove a terrible one. The houses were searched,\r\nall suspicious characters of either sex were at once handed over to the\r\nfiring parties to be summarily shot. By six o\'clock on the evening of\r\nthat day the army of Versailles was in possession of one half of the\r\ncity, its lines running from the park of Montsouris to the Northern\r\nRailway station by way of the main thoroughfares. And the remaining\r\nmembers of the Commune, some twenty men or so, had now been compelled\r\nto take refuge at the municipal offices of the Eleventh Arrondissement,\r\non the Boulevard Voltaire.\r\n\r\nSilence fell, and at last, as Maurice gazed at the city through the\r\nopen window, by which the warm night air streamed into the room, he\r\nmuttered: \'At all events, the work goes on--Paris still burns!\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly: the flames had shone out once more as soon as night had\r\nfallen, and a villainous glow was again tinging the sky with a purple\r\nhue. During the afternoon, the powder magazine near the Luxembourg\r\npalace had exploded with so frightful a crash, that a rumour had spread\r\nthat it was the Panth\xc3\xa9on crumbling into the Catacombs. Moreover, the\r\nfires of the previous night had continued burning throughout the\r\nday--the palace of the Council of State and the Tuileries were still\r\nflaming, whilst the Ministry of Finances still belched its wreathing\r\nclouds of smoke. Over and over again had it been necessary to close\r\nthe window, in order to shut out a cloud of black butterflies, scraps\r\nupon scraps of charred paper, which the violence of the fire whirled\r\nupward into the sky, whence they fell again in a fine rain. All Paris\r\nwas covered with these fragments,[62] some of which, carried off by the\r\nwind, were picked up even in Normandy, twenty leagues away. And now\r\nnot merely were the western and southern quarters flaring--the houses\r\nof the Rue Royale, those of the Croix-Rouge crossway, and of the Rue\r\nNotre-Dame-des-Champs--but all the eastern side of the city also seemed\r\nto be in flames. The huge brazier of the H\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville glowed on the\r\nhorizon with a gigantic sacrificial pyre. And flaring like torches\r\nin the same direction there were the municipal offices of the Fourth\r\nArrondissement, the Lyric theatre, and over thirty houses in adjacent\r\nstreets; to say nothing of the Porte-St. Martin theatre, which on the\r\nnorth shone out all alone, ruddy with fire, like a rick standing out in\r\nthe midst of dusky fields. Here and there private vengeance was busy\r\nat work, and desperate efforts were made to hasten the destruction\r\nof various buildings in order that certain records preserved in them\r\nmight be annihilated. But among the majority of the insurgents there\r\nwas no longer any question of defending themselves, or of arresting the\r\nadvance of the troops by the fires. Madness reigned, conflagrations\r\nwere kindled in haphazard fashion, for the mere sake of destroying; and\r\nthe cathedral of Notre Dame, the H\xc3\xb4tel-Dieu hospital, and the Palais de\r\nJustice were only saved by a lucky chance.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! War! hateful War!\' said Henriette in an undertone, as she gazed on\r\nthat city of havoc, suffering, and agony.\r\n\r\nWas not this indeed the inevitable last act of the tragedy--the\r\noutbreak of that madness which had germinated on those fatal fields\r\nof defeat around Sedan and Metz; the outbreak too of that epidemic\r\nof destructiveness engendered by the siege of Paris, the supreme\r\nconvulsion of a nation threatened with dissolution amid butchery\r\nand ruin? Maurice, however, without taking his eyes off the burning\r\ndistricts over yonder, stammered with difficulty: \'No, no, don\'t curse\r\nWar--War is good, it has its task----\'\r\n\r\nBut Jean interrupted him with a cry of mingled hatred and remorse:\r\n\'Good God! you talk like that when I see you lying there, all through\r\nmy fault. No, no, you mustn\'t defend War again; it is an abominable\r\nthing!\'\r\n\r\nThe wounded man feebly waved his hand: \'What does it matter about me?\r\nThere are plenty of others. This blood-letting was perhaps necessary.\r\nWar is life, and there can be no life unless there be death also.\'\r\n\r\nThen Maurice closed his eyes, exhausted by the effort which these few\r\nwords had cost him. Henriette signed to Jean not to continue arguing.\r\nCalm though her nature was, the nature of a feeble yet a valiant woman,\r\nwith limpid eyes in which the heroic soul of her grandfather lived\r\nanew, she also was now upheaved by a feeling of protest, of anger with\r\nthe suffering human race.\r\n\r\nTwo more days, Thursday and Friday, went by amid the same scenes of\r\nconflagration and massacre. The uproar of the cannonade was incessant.\r\nThe batteries of Montmartre captured by the army of Versailles were now\r\nfiring without a pause upon those which the Federals had established at\r\nBelleville and the P\xc3\xa8re-Lachaise cemetery; and the latter were on their\r\nside firing at random upon Paris. Shells had fallen both in the Rue\r\nde Richelieu and on the Place Vend\xc3\xb4me. On the evening of the 25th the\r\nwhole of the city on the left bank of the Seine was in the hands of the\r\ntroops; but on the right bank the barricades on the Place du Ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nd\'Eau and the Place de la Bastille were still holding out. There were,\r\non these points, two veritable fortresses defended by a galling,\r\nincessant fire. At twilight, amid the disbanding of the last members\r\nof the Commune, Delescluze took his cane, and, like a promenader out\r\nfor a stroll, came quietly to the barricade blocking the Boulevard\r\nVoltaire to fall and die there like a hero. At dawn on the morrow, May\r\n20, the Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Eau and the Bastille positions were carried by the\r\ntroops, and then only La Villette, Belleville, and Charonne remained in\r\nthe power of the Communists, who were becoming less and less numerous,\r\nuntil there remained at last merely a handful of brave men resolved\r\nto die. And during two more days these prolonged their resistance,\r\nfighting with the fury of despair.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday evening, while Jean, having managed to get away from the\r\nPlace du Carrousel, was on his way to the Rue des Orties, he witnessed,\r\nin the lower part of the Rue de Richelieu, a summary execution which\r\nfilled him with horror. Two courts-martial had been sitting since the\r\nWednesday, one at the Luxembourg palace, the other at the Ch\xc3\xa2telet\r\ntheatre. The men condemned by the former tribunal were executed in the\r\npalace gardens, whilst those sentenced by the latter were dragged to\r\nthe Lobau barracks, where firing parties, kept under arms throughout\r\nthe day, shot them down almost at point-blank range, in the inner\r\ncourtyard. And here especially did the butchery prove frightful: men,\r\nmere boys, condemned to death on the flimsiest evidence--because their\r\nhands were black with powder, or simply because they were wearing\r\nregulation shoes; innocent men, too, falsely denounced, victims of\r\nprivate malice shouting out explanations to which their military judges\r\nwould not listen; droves of prisoners huddled together pell-mell\r\nin front of the gun-barrels, so many poor wretches brought in for\r\nexecution at the same time, that the men of the firing-party had\r\nnot bullets enough for all of them, and despatched those whom their\r\ndischarge had merely wounded with the butt-ends of their guns. From\r\nmorning till evening blood streamed and tumbrils carried away the\r\ncorpses. And then, too, here and there through the conquered city, amid\r\nthe frequent outbursts of vengeful fury, there were other executions in\r\nfront of the barricades, against the blank walls of deserted streets,\r\nand on the steps of the public buildings.\r\n\r\nIt was under such circumstances that Jean saw some inhabitants of the\r\nneighbourhood dragging a woman and two men before the officers of\r\na detachment of troops guarding the Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre Fran\xc3\xa7ais. The civilian\r\npopulation indeed showed itself even more ferocious than the soldiers,\r\nand the newspapers that had resumed publication clamoured for\r\nextermination. The violent throng which Jean encountered was especially\r\nwrathful with the woman, a _p\xc3\xa9troleuse_ it was said, one of those\r\ncreatures the fear of whom now haunted the public imagination, who\r\nwere accused of prowling about in the evening, slinking along past the\r\nhouses of well-to-do people and flinging canfuls of flaming petroleum\r\ninto the cellars. This one, so the crowd shouted, had been surprised\r\nwhilst crouching before a vent-hole in the Rue St. Anne. And despite\r\nher protests and her sobs she was flung with the two men into the\r\nditch of a barricade, which had not yet been filled up; and there, in\r\nthat black hole, all three of them were shot like wolves caught in\r\na trap. Promenaders stood by looking on; among them a lady leaning\r\non her husband\'s arm, whilst a pastry-cook\'s boy, who was carrying a\r\npie to some house in the neighbourhood, lingered whistling a hunting\r\nrefrain.[63]\r\n\r\nAs Jean, with his heart frozen, was hastening on towards the Rue des\r\nOrties a sudden recollection dawned upon him. Was not that Chouteau,\r\nformerly of his squad in the 106th, whom he had seen watching that\r\nexecution--clad in the honest white blouse of a workman and waving his\r\narm in an approving fashion? Jean knew what part that bandit, traitor,\r\nrobber, and murderer had played! For a moment he felt inclined to\r\nretrace his steps, denounce the scoundrel, and have him shot upon the\r\ncorpses of the three others. How sad to think that the most guilty\r\nshould ever escape punishment, and air their impunity in the sunlight,\r\nwhilst thousands of innocents lie rotting in the ground!\r\n\r\nHearing his steps upon the stairs, Henriette came to meet him on the\r\nlanding: \'Be prudent, he is in a state of terrible excitement to-day,\'\r\nsaid she; \'the major has been again and gives me but little hope.\'\r\nBouroche indeed had shaken his head ominously, declaring that he was\r\nas yet unable to promise anything. Still, perhaps the sufferer\'s youth\r\nwould triumph over the complications which he feared.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! it\'s you,\' said Maurice feverishly as soon as he caught sight of\r\nJean. \'I was waiting for you to come. What is going on? How do matters\r\nstand?\' And sitting up in bed, with his back resting on the pillow,\r\nin front of the window which he had compelled his sister to re-open,\r\nhe pointed to the city, which another furnace-like glow was now\r\nillumining: \'It\'s beginning again, eh? Paris is burning, and this time\r\nit will all burn.\'\r\n\r\nSince sunset, indeed, all the distant districts up the Seine had been\r\nillumined by the conflagration of the Grenier d\'Abondance.[64] At the\r\nTuileries and the Council of State, the roofs and ceilings must have\r\nbeen falling in, imparting fresh vigour to the braziers of smouldering\r\nbeams, for here and there the fires burst forth again, and flakes and\r\nsparks arose. In this way, too, many houses where it was thought the\r\nfires had gone out suddenly began flaming again once more. For three\r\ndays past, the night had no sooner gathered in, than the city kindled\r\nafresh; it seemed as though the darkness breathed upon the paling\r\nembers, fanning them again into flames, which it scattered to the four\r\ncorners of the horizon. Ah! that hellish city, which began to redden\r\nas soon as the twilight came, burning and burning for seven days,\r\nillumining with its monstrous torches the nights of the Bloody Week!\r\nAnd on that Friday night, when the magazines of La Villette burned\r\ndown, so intense was the light thrown over the immense city, that one\r\nmight have thought it fired upon every side, invaded and submerged by\r\nthe flames. Under the ensanguined sky, the lurid districts rolled their\r\nwaves of shimmering roofs as far as the eye could see.\r\n\r\n\'The end has come,\' repeated Maurice. \'Paris is burning!\'\r\n\r\nHe excited himself with these words, repeating them a score of times\r\nin the febrile longing to talk that had come over him after the heavy\r\nsomnolence which for three days had kept him almost mute. However, the\r\nsound of stifled sobbing made him turn his head.\r\n\r\n\'What! Is it you, little sister, you so brave? You are crying because I\r\nam about to die?\'\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him, protesting: \'No, no, you will not die.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is better so, it is necessary! Ah! nothing of much account\r\nwill be lost in me. Before the war I caused you so much worry. I cost\r\nyou dearly both in heart and purse. All those senseless things I was\r\nguilty of--all those acts of folly I committed and which would have\r\nbrought me to a bad end, perhaps--who knows?--to imprisonment, the\r\ngutter----\'\r\n\r\nAgain did she violently interrupt him: \'Be quiet, be quiet! You have\r\natoned for it all!\'\r\n\r\nHe became silent and reflected for a moment: \'Well, yes, I shall\r\nhave atoned, perhaps--when I am dead. Ah! my old Jean, you all the\r\nsame rendered us a first-rate service when you gave me that bayonet\r\nthrust----\'\r\n\r\nBut Jean, whose eyes were swollen with tears, also protested: \'Don\'t\r\nsay that. Do you want me to go and batter my brains out against a\r\nwall?\'\r\n\r\nIn a burning voice, Maurice continued: \'Do you remember what you said\r\nto me after Sedan, that it sometimes benefited one to receive a good\r\nblow? And you added, too, that when there was any rottenness anywhere,\r\nwhen one had a diseased limb past healing, it was far better to lop it\r\noff with an axe than to die of it as one dies of the cholera. I have\r\noften thought of those words since then, since I have been alone, shut\r\nup in this mad, miserable Paris. And you see, it\'s I that am the rotten\r\nlimb that you have lopped off----\'\r\n\r\nHis excitement was increasing; he no longer listened to the entreaties\r\nof Henriette and Jean, whom he altogether terrified. Amid his fever he\r\ncontinued talking almost deliriously, with a profusion of symbolical\r\nterms and vivid imagery. It was the healthy portion of France, that\r\nwhich was endowed with common-sense and a well-balanced mind, the\r\npeasant portion, which had remained nearest to the soil, which was now\r\nsuppressing the crazed, exasperated portion--that which the Empire\r\nhad corrupted, which had been driven mad by enjoyment and senseless\r\nfancies; and it had been necessary that France should thus carve into\r\nher own flesh, thus mutilate herself, scarce knowing what she was\r\ndoing. Yes, that bath of blood, of French blood, had been necessary; it\r\nwas the abominable holocaust, the living sacrifice offered up amidst\r\npurifying fire. And now the Calvary was ascended, the most awful of\r\nagonies had been reached, the crucified nation was expiating its sins\r\nand was about to be born again.\r\n\r\n\'And you, my old friend Jean, you are the one with the simple mind and\r\nthe stout heart. Go, go; take your pick and take your trowel, go and\r\nturn the soil over in the fields, and build the house anew! But as for\r\nme, you have done well to lop me off, since I was the ulcer clinging to\r\nyour bones!\'\r\n\r\nHe was again delirious, and wished to rise and lean out of the window.\r\n\'Paris is burning,\' he gasped once more; \'nothing of it will remain.\r\nAh! I desired it, longed for it; that flame which carries everything\r\naway, which heals everything--it is doing good work. Let me go down;\r\nlet me help finish the work of humanity and liberty!\'\r\n\r\nJean had the greatest difficulty in getting him back into bed again,\r\nwhilst Henriette in tears spoke to him of their childhood, and\r\nentreated him, in the name of their affection, to be calm. And meantime\r\nthe fiery glow above the vast city had spread even farther; the sea of\r\nflames was now gaining the dark, distant limits of the horizon, and\r\nthe sky looked like the vaulted roof of some giant, red-hot oven.\r\nMeantime, athwart the lurid light of the fires, the dense smoke rising\r\nfrom the Ministry of Finances, which since two days previously had been\r\nstubbornly burning without a flame, still slowly travelled by like a\r\nsombre pall of mourning.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, which was Saturday, a sudden improvement took place\r\nin Maurice\'s condition; he was much calmer, the fever had subsided,\r\nand Jean was greatly delighted to find Henriette smiling, and again\r\ndreaming of their intimacy in the happy future, which seemed still\r\npossible. Was Destiny indeed about to pardon? She spent her nights\r\nin watching; she did not stir from that room where her active\r\nCinderella-like gentleness, her nimble, silent ministrations were like\r\na continuous caress. And, that evening, Jean lingered in the company of\r\nhis friends, with a pleasure that astonished him and made him tremble.\r\nThe troops had captured Belleville and the Buttes-Chaumont during the\r\nday, so that the P\xc3\xa8re-Lachaise cemetery, transformed into an entrenched\r\ncamp, was now the only point where the resistance continued. It seemed\r\nto Jean that the whole terrible business was now over, and he even\r\nasserted that no more prisoners were being shot. He merely alluded to\r\nthe flocks of captives who were being despatched to Versailles. Passing\r\nalong the quay that morning, he had met one of those convoys--men in\r\nblouses, men in coats, and men in their shirt-sleeves, with women of\r\nevery age, some with the wrinkled, scraggy visages of furies, and\r\nothers in the flower of their youth, girls barely fifteen, but all\r\nblended in a great, long, rolling wave of wretchedness and revolt,\r\nwhich the soldiers urged along in the bright sunlight, and which\r\nthe good folks of Versailles, it was said, greeted with jeering and\r\nhooting, and belaboured with sticks and parasols.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, however, Jean was terrified. It was the last day of\r\nthat hateful week. Since the triumphal rising of the sun on that warm,\r\nclear holiday morning he had felt the thrill of the supreme convulsion\r\npassing through the city. It was only now that people learned of the\r\nrepeated massacres of the hostages--the archbishop, the priest of\r\nthe Madeleine, and the others who had been shot at La Roquette on\r\nthe Wednesday; the Dominican monks of Arcueil, who had been picked\r\noff on the run like hares on the Thursday; the other priests and the\r\ngendarmes, who, to the number of forty-seven, had been despatched on\r\nthe ramparts near the Rue Haxo on the Friday; and now the fury of the\r\nreprisals had burst forth once more, and the troops were executing _en\r\nmasse_ the last prisoners that they made. Throughout that beautiful\r\nSunday, the sound of platoon firing rang out without cessation from\r\nthe courtyard of the Lobau barracks, where all was blood and smoke and\r\ngroaning. At La Roquette two hundred and twenty-seven poor wretches,\r\ncaptured here and there, were shot down in a heap. At the P\xc3\xa8re-Lachaise\r\ncemetery, bombarded for four days and at last conquered tomb by tomb,\r\none hundred and forty-eight captives were flung against a wall, the\r\nplaster of which was bespattered with big tears of blood; and three of\r\nthese men, who had been merely wounded by the discharge were promptly\r\nrecaptured and finished off, when they endeavoured to escape. Among\r\nthose twelve thousand unhappy beings who lost their lives through the\r\nCommune, how many innocents there were for each rogue who met his\r\ndeserts! It was said that orders to stop the executions had come from\r\nVersailles; but the butchery still continued, and Thiers, amid all\r\nthe pure glory he achieved by the Liberation of the Territory, was\r\nto become, for many, the legendary Assassin of Paris; whilst Marshal\r\nMacMahon, the beaten general of Fr\xc5\x93schweiler, whose proclamation of\r\nvictory was to be seen on every wall, was to pass into history as\r\nthe Conqueror of P\xc3\xa8re-Lachaise. And Paris, strolling forth into the\r\nbright sunshine in its Sunday best, put on that day a festive air;\r\ndense crowds obstructed the reconquered streets, promenaders strolled\r\ncheerfully to view the smoking ruins, and mothers, holding their\r\nlittle children by the hand, stopped for a moment and listened with an\r\nexpression of interest to the deadened reports of the firing at the\r\nLobau barracks.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the Sunday evening, just as daylight was waning, Jean climbed\r\nthe dark staircase of the house in the Rue des Orties, a frightful\r\npresentiment was oppressing his heart.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room and at once saw that the inevitable end had come.\r\nMaurice lay dead upon the little bed, killed by h\xc3\xa6morrhage, as Major\r\nBouroche had feared. The red farewell of the setting sun was stealing\r\nin by the open window, and two candles were already burning on the\r\ntable near the head of the bed. And Henriette, on her knees, in her\r\nwidow\'s robe which she had not quitted, was weeping there in silence.\r\n\r\nHearing the door open, she raised her head and shuddered as she saw\r\nJean come in. He, in his despair, darted forward to take her hands that\r\nhe might in a loving grasp mingle his own grief with hers. But he felt\r\nthat the little hands were trembling, that all her quivering form was\r\nrecoiling from him in revolt, that she was tearing herself away from\r\nhim for ever. Was it not indeed all over between them now? Maurice\'s\r\ngrave parted them like a bottomless abyss. And then he also could only\r\nfall upon his knees at the bedside, sobbing softly.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a brief silence, Henriette spoke: \'I had turned my\r\nback,\' she said, \'and was holding a bowl of broth, when all at once he\r\ngave a cry--I only had time to rush up to him and he died, calling me\r\nand calling you amid a stream of blood.\'\r\n\r\nHer brother, O God! Her fondly loved Maurice, adored prior to birth\r\neven, her second self, whom she had reared, saved, her sole affection\r\nsince she had seen her poor Weiss fall riddled with bullets against\r\nthat wall at Bazeilles! So War was taking her whole heart; she was to\r\nremain alone in the world, a widow, brotherless, with none to love her!\r\n\r\n\'Ah! good Lord!\' cried Jean sobbing, \'it\'s my fault. My dear little\r\nfellow, for whom I would have laid down my life, and whom I killed like\r\nthe brute I am! What will become of us? Can you _ever_ forgive me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment their eyes met and they were overwhelmed by that\r\nwhich they now, at last, could clearly read in them. All the past\r\narose: the secluded little room at Remilly where they had spent such\r\nsad and yet such pleasant days. He bethought himself of that dream\r\nof his, that dream which had stolen upon him quite unconsciously,\r\nwhich even later had been barely outlined--life together over yonder,\r\nmarriage, a little house, a field to till, which would suffice for\r\nthe needs of a couple of modest, simple tastes. And now the dream had\r\nbecome an ardent desire, a penetrating conviction that with such a\r\nwoman as she was, so loving and so industrious, life would have proved\r\nan earthly Paradise. And she who had had no inkling of this dream\r\nin the chaste, unconscious bestowal of her heart, could now clearly\r\nsee and understand everything. That remote marriage, she herself had\r\nunknowingly desired it. The germinating seed had covertly sprouted,\r\nand now it was love that she felt for that man by the side of whom she\r\nhad at first merely felt comforted. And their eyes told it to them,\r\nand they now loved openly, at the moment when they must part for ever!\r\nThat frightful sacrifice had yet to be accomplished, the last rending,\r\ntheir happiness--still possible the day before--now crumbling to ashes\r\nlike everything else, swept away by the stream of blood which had just\r\ncarried off their brother.\r\n\r\nWith a long and painful effort of the knees Jean raised himself to his\r\nfeet again. \'Farewell!\' Henriette remained motionless on the tiled\r\nfloor. \'Farewell!\'\r\n\r\nHowever, Jean had drawn near to Maurice, that he might look upon him\r\nfor the last time. He gazed upon his lofty forehead, which seemed\r\nloftier still in death, his long thin face and his sightless eyes,\r\nonce rather wild but whence all the madness had now departed. Jean\r\nlonged to embrace his dear little fellow, as he had so often called\r\nhim, but dared not. He beheld himself covered with his brother\'s blood,\r\nand recoiled before the horror of Destiny. Ah! what a death amid the\r\nDownfall of a world! On that last day, when nothing but a few shreds\r\nwas left of the expiring Commune, this additional victim had been\r\nrequired! Thirsting for Justice, the poor fellow had departed amid the\r\nsupreme convulsion of his great black dream: that grandiose, monstrous\r\nconception of the destruction of the old social system, of Paris burnt,\r\nof the soil turned up and purified so that there might spring from it\r\nthe idyll of another Golden Age!\r\n\r\nWith his heart full of anguish Jean turned to the window and looked\r\nout on Paris. The beautiful day was serenely drawing to its close, and\r\nthe sun, now on a level with the horizon, was illumining the city with\r\na bright red glow. It looked not unlike a sun of blood poised upon a\r\nboundless sea. The panes of thousands of windows were scintillating as\r\nthough on fire, inflamed by invisible bellows; the roofs glowed like\r\nbeds of live coals; yellow walls, lofty rust-coloured monuments flared\r\nand sparkled in the evening air like brisk faggot fires. And was not\r\nthis the final pyrotechnical sheaf, the gigantic purple \'bouquet\'--all\r\nParis burning like a giant hurdle, like some ancient forest of dead,\r\ndry trees, fleeting away into the heavens in soaring flames and sparks.\r\nThe fires were burning still, volumes of ruddy smoke continued to rise,\r\nand a loud confused clamour could be heard, perhaps the last groans of\r\nthe men shot down at the Lobau barracks, or perhaps the gay chatter\r\nof the women and the laughter of the children dining in the open air\r\noutside the wine-shops, after their pleasant promenade. From the\r\npillaged houses and public buildings, from the torn-up streets, from\r\nthe depths of all the havoc and suffering, the buzz and stir of life\r\nstill sounded amidst the blaze of that regal sunset, whilst Paris was\r\ndwindling into embers.\r\n\r\nAnd Jean then experienced an extraordinary sensation. It seemed to\r\nhim even in the slowly declining light as though another aurora were\r\nalready rising above the flaming city. And yet this was apparently the\r\nend of all, for Destiny had proved implacable, accumulating disaster\r\nupon disaster, such as no nation had ever before experienced: the\r\ncontinual defeats; the lost provinces; the milliards to be paid; the\r\nmost frightful of civil wars drowned in a flood of gore; street after\r\nstreet in ruins and littered with corpses; no money left, no honour\r\nleft, a whole world to be built afresh. And in it all he, for his own\r\npart, was losing his lacerated heart--no Maurice left, no Henriette,\r\nall the happy life that might have been swept away in the storm. And\r\nyet beyond the furnace, roaring still, in the depths of the great\r\ntranquil heavens so supremely limpid, perennial hope was rising once\r\nmore. \'Twas the certainty of rejuvenescence, the rejuvenescence of\r\neternal nature and of eternal humanity, the renewal promised unto those\r\nwho hope and toil; the tree which throws out a new and powerful stem\r\nwhen the rotten branch, whose poisonous sap was blighting the leaves,\r\nhas been lopped away.\r\n\r\n\'Farewell!\' Jean repeated in a sob.\r\n\r\nHenriette did not raise her head; her face was hidden by her joined\r\nhands: \'Farewell!\'\r\n\r\nThe ravaged field was lying waste, the burnt house was level with\r\nthe ground; and Jean, the most humble and the most woeful, went off\r\nmarching towards the future--to the great and laborious task of\r\nbuilding up a new France.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR\'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing translation of \'La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle\' has been subjected to some\r\nrevision since its first issue in book form, many verbal alterations\r\nhaving been made throughout. Exception has been taken, however, to\r\ncertain passages and expressions which I have not thought fit to\r\nmodify. For instance, an English officer has pointed out to me that\r\nthe description of the artillery practice on p. 261 can hardly be\r\ncorrect, as the French guns must have been fired by friction-tubes,\r\nand not by matches. If there be any error here, it is, however, M.\r\nZola\'s and not mine, so that I have allowed the passage to remain as\r\nit originally stood. Objection has also been taken to the description\r\nof the execution of the captured Communists at the Lobau barracks (p.\r\n526), and the expression \'shot down almost at point-blank range\' has\r\nbeen severely criticised. It is certainly awkward, but the meaning I\r\nwished to convey was that a space of no more than seven or eight feet\r\nintervened between the rifles of the firing party and the men summarily\r\nsentenced to be shot. I may add that I personally witnessed some of\r\nthese executions.\r\n\r\nI should further like to say that I am extremely grateful to my\r\ncritics and correspondents for their suggestions, several of which I\r\nhave utilised in revising the translation for this new edition. The\r\njudgment passed by the Press on my work was on the whole extremely\r\nflattering, and no doubt largely conduced to the success of the book\r\nin this country. \'The Downfall\' in its French and English forms has,\r\nI believe, become the most popular of all M. Zola\'s novels. No fewer\r\nthan 176,000 copies of the original have been sold in the space of one\r\nyear, yielding the author the handsome sum of 4,200_l._ in addition to\r\nthe 1,600_l._ paid to him for the serial rights in France, and about\r\n2,000_l._ derived from the rights of translation.\r\n\r\n E.

The Cent-Gardes\r\nwere the imperial bodyguard, picked men of the heavy cavalry, 100\r\nstrong as their name implied.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[16] Abel, not F\xc3\xa9lix Douay.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[17] The Germans brought about 40,000 men into action to overcome these\r\n5,000 Frenchmen.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[18] The Chasseurs d\'Afrique thus designate their squads, in imitation\r\nof the Arabs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[19] On August 14 the Emperor left Metz, Bazaine\'s army commenced its\r\nretreat, and an indecisive action took place at Courcelles and Pange;\r\non the 16th Prince Frederick Charles attacked Bazaine at Mars-la-Tour,\r\nand stopped his retreat; and on the 18th the French were again attacked\r\nat Gravelotte, and, after nine hours\' fighting, driven back towards\r\nMetz.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[20] The mendacious War Minister, Count de Palikao, had the effrontery\r\nto assert before the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif that this engagement had really\r\ntaken place, whereas it had no existence, save in the imagination of\r\nsome unscrupulous French journalist.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[21] The marching powers of the German infantry are well known. Before\r\na Prussian recruit is entered in a foot regiment he is carefully\r\nexamined in order to see whether his feet will bear the strain of long\r\nmarches, and the greatest attention is paid to the fit of the excellent\r\nboots with which he is provided. In war time, moreover, whenever\r\npracticable, the knapsacks are conveyed in a cart attached to each\r\ncompany, in order to facilitate rapid motion. Such care is sure to reap\r\nits reward.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[22] Meaning the surgeon. French army surgeons are commonly\r\ndesignated by their military rank, without reference to their medical\r\nqualifications.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[23] In point of fact the Royal Prussian head quarters were at\r\nBar-le-Duc on August 25, and it was there that the Crown Prince heard\r\nthat MacMahon had made at first for Rheims, and then had struck off in\r\na northerly direction. Count Moltke immediately decided that the army\r\nof the Crown Prince of Saxony, which on August 22 had started on its\r\nwestward march from before Metz by Verdun and St. Menehould, should\r\nadvance to meet MacMahon, and hold him in the Argonne; whilst the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia\'s forces hastened northward by forced marches in view\r\nof sweeping round the right flank of the French, and hemming them in\r\nagainst the Belgian frontier. On August 26 the Saxons were marching\r\nfor Stenay on the Meuse and the Prussians to Clermont-en-Argonne and\r\nGrand-Pr\xc3\xa9.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[24] In the engagements fought this day (August 30) between the Germans\r\nand De Failly\'s corps and other portions of MacMahon\'s army, 7,000 of\r\nthe French were taken prisoners, and a quantity of their camp equipage\r\nand twenty guns were captured.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[25] Equivalent to our Charlie.\r\n\r\n[26] Napoleon III. had very short legs, and on foot he looked\r\ncomparatively insignificant. But the length of his trunk gave him a\r\ncommanding presence when he was on horseback, and he then appeared\r\ntaller than the majority of his officers.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[27] In order that the reader may form some idea of Bazeilles, it\r\nmay be mentioned that in 1870 it was a large village of over 2,000\r\ninhabitants. The great majority of these were weavers. There were a few\r\ncloth manufactories and fulleries there, together with some ironworks\r\nwith furnaces, plate-rolling mills, etc. Balan, between Bazeilles and\r\nSedan, had a population of 1,500; whilst Sedan itself counted over\r\n13,000 inhabitants, but nearly half of these had fled to Belgium prior\r\nto the battle.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[28] This incident will not surprise those who remember how, during the\r\nbombardment of Paris, the urchins used to lie about waiting for the\r\nshells, and, after each explosion, pounce upon the splinters with the\r\nview of selling them as \'souvenirs of the siege.\'--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[29] The sergeants of the French Artillery are usually styled\r\nquartermasters. This was Honor\xc3\xa9\'s rank. We have quartermaster sergeants\r\nin our own service.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[30] For enlightenment on this point and many others we must wait for\r\nthe publication of Marshal MacMahon\'s memoirs, the portion of which\r\ndealing with the Franco-German war was written some years ago, three\r\ncopies of it being then printed for private use.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[31] A celebrated French surgeon of the first half of the present\r\ncentury.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[32] Literally the Hollow of Givonne. It should not be confounded with\r\nGivonne proper, which lies some miles to the north.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[33] Licorice-root water, a favourite drink among Parisian\r\nchildren.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[34] The shooting of the civilian inhabitants who took part in\r\ndefending the village was in accordance with the cruel, but recognised,\r\nusages of war; but for the deliberate burning of their bodies there\r\ncan be no excuse. However, some English newspaper correspondents,\r\non the German side, asserted at the time that the occurrence was\r\naccidental, both French and Bavarian corpses being burnt by the falling\r\nhouses.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[35] M. Zola has omitted to mention that, whilst Count von Bismarck\r\nand the Emperor were together, they came out of the house and sat\r\ntalking for a couple of hours in the open air, on chairs that were\r\nplaced there for them. Meantime, the staff officers present remained\r\nlying on a patch of grass not far off. When Count von Bismarck had left\r\nhim, the Emperor returned into the house, which curiously enough was\r\ntenanted not by a French family, but by that of a Luxemburg weaver,\r\nspeaking both French and German. After considerable delay Napoleon\r\nwas escorted to the ch\xc3\xa2teau of Bellevue by a detachment of Prussian\r\nCuirassiers.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[36] When we remember that the Marseillaise is typical of the French\r\nRevolution, which was the origin of the power of the Bonapartes, the\r\nsignificance of both these engravings, in the circumstances in which\r\nthe Emperor found himself, was truly remarkable. He stood there, as it\r\nwere, betwixt Alpha and Omega.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[37] The length of the French league is about 2 miles 6 furlongs.\r\n\r\n[38] In time of peace a bottle of the common wine, here priced at seven\r\nfrancs, had cost about twelve sous, whilst the usual charge for a\r\nliqueur glass of so-called brandy was no more than three sous.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[39] It may be explained that M. Zola borrows this simile from the\r\nRoman ritual, and refers to the Stations of the Cross.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[40] M. Zola, as was to be expected, invariably alludes to these\r\nbattles by the names adopted in France. In England, however, we\r\ngenerally employ the names which the Germans gave to these engagements.\r\nIt should therefore be explained that the battle of Borny is also that\r\nof Courcelles; that R\xc3\xa9zonville is also Mars-la-Tour; and St. Priv\xc3\xa2t,\r\nGravelotte. These battles have been referred to in the notes to chap.\r\nIII., Part I (note 19).--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[41] The \'combined army,\' so the Germans called it.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[42] M. Zola\'s assertion that Bazaine made no attempt to break through\r\nthe German lines (subsequent, of course, to Sept. 1) is not correct,\r\nfor after a delay of five weeks he made one apparently serious\r\neffort--in the direction of Thionville, on Oct. 7. Then, however, he\r\nremained idle for twenty days and had to capitulate. The translator,\r\nwho was present at the marshal\'s trial as an English newspaper\r\ncorrespondent, and heard and sifted all the evidence, has never\r\nentertained a doubt as to the justice of the court\'s finding. We shot\r\nAdmiral Byng for dereliction of duty insignificant in comparison with\r\nthe charges brought home to Bazaine. Certainly the latter had ability\r\nas a soldier; he had, partly by merit, but also considerably by favour,\r\nrisen from the ranks to be a marshal of France; however, his private\r\ncharacter was execrable, his greed well-nigh as insatiable as that of\r\nMarlborough, and his instinctive cruelty of disposition, as exemplified\r\nin Mexico, notorious. Like Marshals Magnan and St. Arnaud, he was a\r\ntype of the unscrupulous military adventurer.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[43] The leaders of this rising (most of the phases of which were\r\nwitnessed by the translator, who was then in Paris) were Gustave\r\nFlourens, Blanqui, and various officers of the National Guard who\r\nafterwards became members of the Commune. During the afternoon and\r\nevening M. Ernest Picard, General Trochu, and M. Jules Ferry managed\r\nto escape from the H\xc3\xb4tel-de-Ville and succeeded in delivering their\r\ncolleagues of the Government at 3 a.m. on Nov. 1.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[44] The eleven fortified places here enumerated were garrisoned by\r\nover 45,000 men of the regular army, all of whom became prisoners of\r\nwar.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[45] An allusion of course to Beaumarchais\' immortal creation of the\r\nboy-lover.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[46] Gambetta was called a furious madman by Thiers.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[47] The engagement fought on Nov. 9 when D\'Aurelle de Paladines with\r\nthe army of the Loire defeated Von der Tann\'s Bavarians, with the\r\nresult that the French for a brief period again secured possession of\r\nOrleans.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[48] Fought on December 22-23.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[49] One hundred and twenty millions sterling.\r\n\r\n[50] Equivalent to rather more than 10\xc2\xbd ozs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[51] During the last week in December the number of deaths from natural\r\ncauses alone was already 3,280, and during the week ending January\r\n21 it had risen to 4,465, an average of 115 per thousand! And at\r\nthe same time the wounded were dying off \'like rotten sheep\' in the\r\nambulances.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[52] Neither the Rue des Orties nor the hill known as the Butte des\r\nMoulins now exists, both having been swept away to make room for\r\nthe Avenue de l\'Op\xc3\xa9ra, the lower portion of which runs across the\r\nspot where the Butte, with its few dingy, narrow streets formerly\r\nrose.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[53] Thiers did try to spare it, and Count von Bismarck in the Emperor\r\nWilliam\'s name offered to forego the triumphal entry if Belfort were\r\nsurrendered to Germany. But this proposal was rejected by Thiers, to\r\nhis everlasting credit.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[54] This appellation was for brevity\'s sake bestowed on the Federated\r\nNational Guards serving the Commune, whilst the Government troops were\r\nhabitually called the Versaillese.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[55] The translator enabled several French friends to get out of Paris\r\nat this time by lending them, in turn, his English passport.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[56] This is not quite accurate. The excessive prudence of the French\r\ncommanders at the outset was mainly due to the fear that their men\r\nmight fraternise with the National Guards. This fear was altogether\r\nunfounded, as the troops, most of whom had gone through the war, were\r\nenraged with the Communists, whose rising had delayed their discharge.\r\nNevertheless, the officers remembered what had happened at the outset\r\nof the insurrection, and in the earlier stages of the street-fighting\r\nseldom allowed their men to come within speaking distance of the\r\nNational Guards. Officers of high rank admitted this to the translator\r\nat the time.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[57] The Magenta and Solferino campaign of 1859.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[58] Containing the throne-room and the Prince Imperial\'s\r\napartments.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[59] The place of revelry where Napoleon III. and his wife, his\r\nmistresses, his sycophants, his corrupt ministers and his incompetent\r\ncommanders, had danced and made merry for well-nigh twenty\r\nyears.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[60] The State depository for the crown jewels, plate, works of art,\r\nvaluable articles of furniture, &c., not used in the palaces.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[61] Hand-pumps were then used by the French firemen. I do not think\r\nthere was a single steam fire-engine in Paris at that time. I well\r\nremember assisting in the pumping both in the Rue Royale and at the\r\nPalais de Justice, during those terrible last days of the Commune which\r\nM. Zola here so forcibly and accurately describes.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[62] I remember that both the Place de la Concorde and the Esplanade\r\ndes Invalides were littered with these papers, some in fragments quite\r\ncharred and black, and others but slightly burnt at the corners. Among\r\nthe less damaged documents I noticed were some curious petitions of the\r\nold _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_ of the Revolution beseeching Louis XVIII. to give them\r\nback their ancestral estates.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[63] Among those who witnessed this scene, or at all events one very\r\nsimilar on the same spot, were the translator\'s father and brother, Mr.\r\nHenry and Mr. Arthur Vizetelly.\r\n\r\n[64] A vast magazine where cereals and oil, especially the latter, were\r\nstored in considerable quantities.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Downfall, by \xc3\x89mile Zola\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DOWNFALL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 56799-0.txt or 56799-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/6/7/9/56799/\r\n\r\nProduced by Clare Graham & Marc D\'Hooghe at Free Literature\r\n(Images generously made available by the Internet Archive.)\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
