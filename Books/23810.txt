It was a matter of\r\nunusual interest to them that a plantation of four thousand acres had\r\nbeen left unincumbered to the disposal of a handsome, inconsolable,\r\nchildless Creole widow of thirty. A _b\xeatise_ of some sort might safely\r\nbe looked for. But time passing, the anticipated folly failed to\r\nreveal itself; and the only wonder was that Th\xe9r\xe8se Lafirme so\r\nsuccessfully followed the methods of her departed husband.\r\n\r\nOf course Th\xe9r\xe8se had wanted to die with her J\xe9r\xf4me, feeling that life\r\nwithout him held nothing that could reconcile her to its further\r\nendurance. For days she lived alone with her grief; shutting out the\r\nappeals that came to her from the demoralized "hands," and unmindful\r\nof the disorder that gathered about her. Till Uncle Hiram came one day\r\nwith a respectful tender of sympathy, offered in the guise of a\r\nreckless misquoting of Scripture--and with a grievance.\r\n\r\n"Mistuss," he said, "I \'lowed \'twar best to come to de house an\' tell\r\nyou; fur Massa he alluz did say \'Hi\'urm, I counts on you to keep a eye\r\nopen endurin\' my appersunce;\' you ricollic, marm?" addressing an\r\nexpanse of black bordered cambric that veiled the features of his\r\nmistress. "Things is a goin\' wrong; dat dey is. I don\'t wants to name\r\nno names \'doubt I\'se \'bleeged to; but dey done start a kiarrin\' de\r\ncotton seed off de place, and dats how."\r\n\r\nIf Hiram\'s information had confined itself to the bare statement of\r\nthings "goin\' wrong," such intimation, of its nature vague and\r\nsusceptible of uncertain interpretation, might have failed to rouse\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se from her lethargy of grief. But that wrong doing presented as\r\na tangible abuse and defiance of authority, served to move her to\r\naction. She felt at once the weight and sacredness of a trust, whose\r\nacceptance brought consolation and awakened unsuspected powers of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Uncle Hiram\'s parting prediction "de cotton \'ll be a goin\'\r\nnaxt" no more seed was hauled under cover of darkness from\r\nPlace-du-Bois.\r\n\r\nThe short length of this Louisiana plantation stretched along Cane\r\nRiver, meeting the water when that stream was at its highest, with a\r\nthick growth of cotton-wood trees; save where a narrow convenient\r\nopening had been cut into their midst, and where further down the pine\r\nhills started in abrupt prominence from the water and the dead level\r\nof land on either side of them. These hills extended in a long line of\r\ngradual descent far back to the wooded borders of Lac du Bois; and\r\nwithin the circuit which they formed on the one side, and the\r\nirregular half circle of a sluggish bayou on the other, lay the\r\ncultivated open ground of the plantation--rich in its exhaustless\r\npowers of reproduction.\r\n\r\nAmong changes which the railroad brought soon after J\xe9r\xf4me Lafirme\'s\r\ndeath, and which were viewed by many as of questionable benefit, was\r\none which drove Th\xe9r\xe8se to seek another domicile. The old homestead\r\nthat nestled to the hill side and close to the water\'s edge, had been\r\nabandoned to the inroads of progressive civilization; and Mrs. Lafirme\r\nhad rebuilt many rods away from the river and beyond sight of the\r\nmutilated dwelling, converted now into a section house. In building,\r\nshe avoided the temptations offered by modern architectural\r\ninnovations, and clung to the simplicity of large rooms and broad\r\nverandas: a style whose merits had stood the test of easy-going and\r\ncomfort-loving generations.\r\n\r\nThe negro quarters were scattered at wide intervals over the land,\r\nbreaking with picturesque irregularity into the systematic division of\r\nfield from field; and in the early spring-time gleaming in their new\r\ncoat of whitewash against the tender green of the sprouting cotton and\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se loved to walk the length of the wide verandas, armed with her\r\nfield-glass, and to view her surrounding possessions with comfortable\r\nsatisfaction. Then her gaze swept from cabin to cabin; from patch to\r\npatch; up to the pine-capped hills, and down to the station which\r\nsquatted a brown and ugly intruder within her fair domain.\r\n\r\nShe had made pouting resistance to this change at first, opposing it\r\nstep by step with a conservatism that yielded only to the resistless.\r\nShe pictured a visionary troop of evils coming in the wake of the\r\nrailroad, which, in her eyes no conceivable benefits could mitigate.\r\nThe occasional tramp, she foresaw as an army; and the travelers whom\r\nchance deposited at the store that adjoined the station, she dreaded\r\nas an endless procession of intruders forcing themselves upon her\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire, the young nephew of Mrs. Lafirme, whose duty on the\r\nplantation was comprehended in doing as he was bid, qualified by a\r\npropensity for doing as he liked, rode up from the store one day in\r\nthe reckless fashion peculiar to Southern youth, breathless with the\r\ninformation that a stranger was there wishing audience with her.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se at once bristled with objections. Here was a confirmation of\r\nher worst dread. But encouraged by Gr\xe9goire\'s reiteration "he \'pear to\r\nme like a nice sort o\' person," she yielded a grudging assent to the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nShe sat within the wide hall-way beyond the glare and heat that were\r\nbeating mercilessly down upon the world out of doors, engaged in a\r\nlight work not so exacting as to keep her thoughts and glance from\r\nwandering. Looking through the wide open back doors, the picture which\r\nshe saw was a section of the perfect lawn that encircled the house for\r\nan acre around, and from which Hiram was slowly raking the leaves cast\r\nfrom a clump of tall magnolias. Beneath the spreading shade of an\r\numbrella-China tree, lay the burly Hector, but half awake to the\r\npossible nearness of tramps; and Betsy, a piece of youthful ebony in\r\nblue cottonade, was crossing leisurely on her way to the poultry yard;\r\nunheeding the scorching sun-rays that she thought were sufficiently\r\nparried by the pan of chick feed that she balanced adroitly on her\r\nbushy black head.\r\n\r\nAt the front, the view at certain seasons would have been clear and\r\nunbroken: to the station, the store, and out-lying hills. But now she\r\ncould see beyond the lawn only a quivering curtain of rich green which\r\nthe growing corn spread before the level landscape, and above whose\r\nswaying heads appeared occasionally the top of an advancing white\r\nsun-shade.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was of a roundness of figure suggesting a future of excessive\r\nfullness if not judiciously guarded; and she was fair, with a warm\r\nwhiteness that a passing thought could deepen into color. The waving\r\nblonde hair, gathered in an abundant coil on top of her head, grew\r\naway with a pretty sweep from the temples, the low forehead and nape\r\nof the white neck that showed above a frill of soft lace. Her eyes\r\nwere blue, as certain gems are; that deep blue that lights, and glows,\r\nand tells things of the soul. When David Hosmer presented himself,\r\nthey were intense only with expectancy and the color was in her cheek\r\nlike the blush in a shell.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall individual of perhaps forty; thin and sallow. His black\r\nhair was streaked abundantly with grey, and his face marked with\r\npremature lines; left there by care, no doubt, and, by a too close\r\nattention to what men are pleased to call the main chances of life.\r\n\r\n"A serious one," was Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s first thought in looking at him. "A man\r\nwho has never learned to laugh or who has forgotten how." Though\r\nplainly feeling the effects of the heat, he did not seem to appreciate\r\nthe relief offered by the grateful change into this shadowy, sweet\r\nsmelling, cool retreat; used as he was to ignore the comforting things\r\nof life when presented to him as irrelevant to that dominant main\r\nchance. He accepted under protest a glass of ice water from the\r\nwide-eyed Betsy, and suffered a fan to be thrust into his hand,\r\nseemingly to save his time or his timidity by its possibly unheeded\r\nrejection.\r\n\r\n"Lor\'-zee folks," exclaimed the observant Betsy on re-entering the\r\nkitchen, "dey\'se a man in yonda, look like he gwine eat somebody up. I\r\nwas fur gittin\' \'way quick me."\r\n\r\nIt can be readily imagined that Hosmer lost little time in preliminary\r\nsmall talk. He introduced himself vaguely as from the West; then\r\nperceiving the need of being more specific as from Saint Louis. She\r\nhad guessed he was no Southerner. He had come to Mrs. Lafirme on the\r\npart of himself and others with a moneyed offer for the privilege of\r\ncutting timber from her land for a given number of years. The amount\r\nnamed was alluring, but here was proposed another change and she felt\r\nplainly called on for resistance.\r\n\r\nThe company which he represented had in view the erection of a sawmill\r\nsome two miles back in the woods, close beside the bayou and at a\r\nconvenient distance from the lake. He was not wordy, nor was he eager\r\nin urging his plans; only in a quiet way insistent in showing points\r\nto be considered in her own favor which she would be likely herself to\r\noverlook.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lafirme, a clever enough business woman, was moved by no undue\r\nhaste to give her answer. She begged for time to think the matter\r\nover, which Hosmer readily agreed to; expressing a hope that a\r\nfavorable answer be sent to him at Natchitoches, where he would await\r\nher convenience. Then resisting rather than declining all further\r\nhospitality, he again took his way through the scorching fields.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se wanted but time to become familiar with this further change.\r\nAlone she went out to her beloved woods, and at the hush of mid-day,\r\nbade a tearful farewell to the silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt the Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Hosmer sat alone in his little office of roughly fashioned pine\r\nboard. So small a place, that with his desk and his clerk\'s desk, a\r\nnarrow bed in one corner, and two chairs, there was scant room for a\r\nman to more than turn himself comfortably about. He had just\r\ndispatched his clerk with the daily bundle of letters to the\r\npost-office, two miles away in the Lafirme store, and he now turned\r\nwith the air of a man who had well earned his moment of leisure, to\r\nthe questionable relaxation of adding columns and columns of figures.\r\n\r\nThe mill\'s unceasing buzz made pleasant music to his ears and stirred\r\nreflections of a most agreeable nature. A year had gone by since Mrs.\r\nLafirme had consented to Hosmer\'s proposal; and already the business\r\nmore than gave promise of justifying the venture. Orders came in from\r\nthe North and West more rapidly than they could be filled. That\r\n"Cypresse Funerall" which stands in grim majesty through the dense\r\nforests of Louisiana had already won its just recognition; and\r\nHosmer\'s appreciation of a successful business venture was showing\r\nitself in a little more pronounced stoop of shoulder, a deepening of\r\npre-occupation and a few additional lines about mouth and forehead.\r\n\r\nHardly had the clerk gone with his letters than a light footstep\r\nsounded on the narrow porch; the quick tap of a parasol was heard on\r\nthe door-sill; a pleasant voice asking, "Any admission except on\r\nbusiness?" and Th\xe9r\xe8se crossed the small room and seated herself\r\nbeside Hosmer\'s desk before giving him time to arise.\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand and arm,--bare to the elbow--across his work, and\r\nsaid, looking at him reproachfully:--\r\n\r\n"Is this the way you keep a promise?"\r\n\r\n"A promise?" he questioned, smiling awkwardly and looking furtively at\r\nthe white arm, then very earnestly at the ink-stand beyond.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Didn\'t you promise to do no work after five o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"But this is merely pastime," he said, touching the paper, yet leaving\r\nit undisturbed beneath the fair weight that was pressing it down. "My\r\nwork is finished: you must have met Henry with the letters."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose he went through the woods; we came on the hand-car. Oh,\r\ndear! It\'s an ungrateful task, this one of reform," and she leaned\r\nback, fanning leisurely, whilst he proceeded to throw the contents of\r\nhis desk into hopeless disorder by pretended efforts at arrangement.\r\n\r\n"My husband used sometimes to say, and no doubt with reason," she\r\ncontinued, "that in my eagerness for the rest of mankind to do right,\r\nI was often in danger of losing sight of such necessity for myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there could be no fear of that," said Hosmer with a short laugh.\r\nThere was no further pretext for continued occupation with his pens\r\nand pencils and rulers, so he turned towards Th\xe9r\xe8se, rested an arm on\r\nthe desk, pulled absently at his black moustache, and crossing his\r\nknee, gazed with deep concern at the toe of his boot, and set of his\r\ntrouser about the ankle.\r\n\r\n"You are not what my friend Homeyer would call an individualist," he\r\nventured, "since you don\'t grant a man the right to follow the\r\npromptings of his character."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m no individualist, if to be one is to permit men to fall into\r\nhurtful habits without offering protest against it. I\'m losing faith\r\nin that friend Homeyer, who I strongly suspect is a mythical apology\r\nfor your own short-comings."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he\'s no myth; but a friend who is fond of going into such\r\nthings and allows me the benefit of his deeper perceptions."\r\n\r\n"You having no time, well understood. But if his influence has had the\r\nmerit of drawing your thoughts from business once in a while we won\'t\r\nquarrel with it."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lafirme," said Hosmer, seeming moved to pursue the subject, and\r\naddressing the spray of white blossoms that adorned Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s black\r\nhat, "you admit, I suppose, that in urging your views upon me, you\r\nhave in mind the advancement of my happiness?"\r\n\r\n"Well understood."\r\n\r\n"Then why wish to substitute some other form of enjoyment for the one\r\nwhich I find in following my inclinations?"\r\n\r\n"Because there is an unsuspected selfishness in your inclinations that\r\nworks harm to yourself and to those around you. I want you to know,"\r\nshe continued warmly, "the good things of life that cheer and warm,\r\nthat are always at hand."\r\n\r\n"Do you think the happiness of Melicent or--or others could be\r\nmaterially lessened by my fondness for money getting?" he asked dryly,\r\nwith a faint elevation of eyebrow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, in proportion as it deprives them of a charm which any man\'s\r\nsociety loses, when pursuing one object in life, he grows insensible\r\nto every other. But I\'ll not scold any more. I\'ve made myself\r\ntroublesome enough for one day. You haven\'t asked about Melicent. It\'s\r\ntrue," she laughed, "I haven\'t given you much chance. She\'s out on the\r\nlake with Gr\xe9goire."\r\n\r\n"Ah?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the pirogue. A dangerous little craft, I\'m afraid; but she\r\ntells me she can swim. I suppose it\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Melicent will look after herself."\r\n\r\nHosmer had great faith in his sister Melicent\'s ability to look after\r\nherself; and it must be granted that the young lady fully justified\r\nhis belief in her.\r\n\r\n"She enjoys her visit more than I thought she would," he said.\r\n\r\n"Melicent\'s a dear girl," replied Th\xe9r\xe8se cordially, "and a wise one\r\ntoo in guarding herself against a somber influence that I know," with\r\na meaning glance at Hosmer, who was preparing to close his desk.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly perceived the picture of a handsome boy, far back in one\r\nof the pigeon-holes, and with the familiarity born of country\r\nintercourse, she looked intently at it, remarking upon the boy\'s\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n"A child whom I loved very much," said Hosmer. "He\'s dead," and he\r\nclosed the desk, turning the key in the lock with a sharp click which\r\nseemed to add--"and buried."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se then approached the open door, leaned her back against its\r\ncasing, and turned her pretty profile towards Hosmer, who, it need not\r\nbe supposed, was averse to looking at it--only to being caught in the\r\nact.\r\n\r\n"I want to look in at the mill before work closes," she said; and not\r\nwaiting for an answer she went on to ask--moved by some association of\r\nideas:--\r\n\r\n"How is Jo\xe7int doing?"\r\n\r\n"Always unruly, the foreman tells me. I don\'t believe we shall be able\r\nto keep him."\r\n\r\nHosmer then spoke a few words through the telephone which connected\r\nwith the agent\'s desk at the station, put on his great slouch hat, and\r\nthrusting keys and hands into his pocket, joined Th\xe9r\xe8se in the\r\ndoor-way.\r\n\r\nQuitting the office and making a sharp turn to the left, they came in\r\ndirect sight of the great mill. She quickly made her way past the huge\r\npiles of sawed timber, not waiting for her companion, who loitered at\r\neach step of the way, with observant watchfulness. Then mounting the\r\nsteep stairs that led to the upper portions of the mill, she went at\r\nonce to her favorite spot, quite on the edge of the open platform that\r\noverhung the dam. Here she watched with fascinated delight the great\r\nlogs hauled dripping from the water, following each till it had\r\nchanged to the clean symmetry of sawed planks. The unending work made\r\nher giddy. For no one was there a moment of rest, and she could well\r\nunderstand the open revolt of the surly Jo\xe7int; for he rode the day\r\nlong on that narrow car, back and forth, back and forth, with his\r\nheart in the pine hills and knowing that his little Creole pony was\r\nroaming the woods in vicious idleness and his rifle gathering an\r\nunsightly rust on the cabin wall at home.\r\n\r\nThe boy gave but ugly acknowledgment to Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s amiable nod; for he\r\nthought she was one upon whom partly rested the fault of this\r\nintrusive Industry which had come to fire the souls of indolent\r\nfathers with a greedy ambition for gain, at the sore expense of\r\nrevolting youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the Pirogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n"You got to set mighty still in this pirogue," said Gr\xe9goire, as with\r\na long oar-stroke he pulled out into mid stream.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," answered Melicent complacently, arranging herself\r\nopposite him in the long narrow boat: all sense of danger which the\r\nsituation might arouse being dulled by the attractiveness of a new\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nHer resemblance to Hosmer ended with height and slenderness of figure,\r\nolive tinted skin, and eyes and hair which were of that dark brown\r\noften miscalled black; but unlike his, her face was awake with an\r\neagerness to know and test the novelty and depth of unaccustomed\r\nsensation. She had thus far lived an unstable existence, free from the\r\nweight of responsibilities, with a notion lying somewhere deep in her\r\nconsciousness that the world must one day be taken seriously; but that\r\ncontingency was yet too far away to disturb the harmony of her days.\r\n\r\nShe had eagerly responded to her brother\'s suggestion of spending a\r\nsummer with him in Louisiana. Hitherto, having passed her summers\r\nNorth, West, or East as alternating caprice prompted, she was ready at\r\na word to fit her humor to the novelty of a season at the South. She\r\nenjoyed in advance the startling effect which her announced intention\r\nproduced upon her intimate circle at home; thinking that her whim\r\ndeserved the distinction of eccentricity with which they chose to\r\ninvest it. But Melicent was chiefly moved by the prospect of an\r\nuninterrupted sojourn with her brother, whom she loved blindly, and to\r\nwhom she attributed qualities of mind and heart which she thought the\r\nworld had discovered to use against him.\r\n\r\n"You got to set mighty still in this pirogue."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; you told me so before," and she laughed.\r\n\r\n"W\'at are you laughin\' at?" asked Gr\xe9goire with amused but uncertain\r\nexpectancy.\r\n\r\n"Laughing at you, Gr\xe9goire; how can I help it?" laughing again.\r\n\r\n"Betta wait tell I do somethin\' funny, I reckon. Ain\'t this a putty\r\nsight?" he added, referring to the dense canopy of an overarching\r\ntree, beneath which they were gliding, and whose extreme branches\r\ndipped quite into the slow moving water.\r\n\r\nThe scene had not attracted Melicent. For she had been engaged in\r\nobserving her companion rather closely; his personality holding her\r\nwith a certain imaginative interest.\r\n\r\nThe young man whom she so closely scrutinized was slightly undersized,\r\nbut of close and brawny build. His hands were not so refinedly white\r\nas those of certain office bred young men of her acquaintance, yet\r\nthey were not coarsened by undue toil: it being somewhat an axiom with\r\nhim to do nothing that an available "nigger" might do for him.\r\n\r\nClose fitting, high-heeled boots of fine quality incased his feet, in\r\nwhose shapeliness he felt a pardonable pride; for a young man\'s\r\nexcellence was often measured in the circle which he had frequented,\r\nby the possession of such a foot. A peculiar grace in the dance and a\r\ntalent for bold repartee were further characteristics which had made\r\nGr\xe9goire\'s departure keenly felt among certain belles of upper Red\r\nRiver. His features were handsome, of sharp and refined cut; and his\r\neyes black and brilliant as eyes of an alert and intelligent animal\r\nsometimes are. Melicent could not reconcile his voice to her liking;\r\nit was too softly low and feminine, and carried a note of pleading or\r\npathos, unless he argued with his horse, his dog, or a "nigger," at\r\nwhich times, though not unduly raised, it acquired a biting quality\r\nthat served the purpose of relieving him from further form of\r\ninsistence.\r\n\r\nHe pulled rapidly and in silence down the bayou, that was now so\r\nentirely sheltered from the open light of the sky by the meeting\r\nbranches above, as to seem a dim leafy tunnel fashioned by man\'s\r\ningenuity. There were no perceptible banks, for the water spread out\r\non either side of them, further than they could follow its flashings\r\nthrough the rank underbrush. The dull plash of some object falling\r\ninto the water, or the wild call of a lonely bird were the only sounds\r\nthat broke upon the stillness, beside the monotonous dipping of the\r\noars and the occasional low undertones of their own voices. When\r\nGr\xe9goire called the girl\'s attention to an object near by, she fancied\r\nit was the protruding stump of a decaying tree; but reaching for his\r\nrevolver and taking quiet aim, he drove a ball into the black upturned\r\nnozzle that sent it below the surface with an angry splash.\r\n\r\n"Will he follow us?" she asked, mildly agitated.\r\n\r\n"Oh no; he\'s glad \'nough to git out o\' the way. You betta put down yo\'\r\nveil," he added a moment later.\r\n\r\nBefore she could ask a reason--for it was not her fashion to obey at\r\nword of command--the air was filled with the doleful hum of a gray\r\nswarm of mosquitoes, which attacked them fiercely.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t tell me the bayou was the refuge of such savage\r\ncreatures," she said, fastening her veil closely about face and neck,\r\nbut not before she had felt the sharpness of their angry sting.\r\n\r\n"I reckoned you\'d \'a knowed all about it: seems like you know\r\neverything." After a short interval he added, "you betta take yo\' veil\r\noff."\r\n\r\nShe was amused at Gr\xe9goire\'s authoritative tone and she said to him\r\nlaughing, yet obeying his suggestion, which carried a note of command:\r\n"you shall tell me always, why I should do things."\r\n\r\n"All right," he replied; "because they ain\'t any mo\' mosquitoes;\r\nbecause I want you to see somethin\' worth seein\' afta while; and\r\nbecause I like to look at you," which he was doing, with the innocent\r\nboldness of a forward child. "Ain\'t that \'nough reasons?"\r\n\r\n"More than enough," she replied shortly.\r\n\r\nThe rank and clustering vegetation had become denser as they went on,\r\nforming an impenetrable tangle on either side, and pressing so closely\r\nabove that they often needed to lower their heads to avoid the blow of\r\nsome drooping branch. Then a sudden and unlooked for turn in the bayou\r\ncarried them out upon the far-spreading waters of the lake, with the\r\nbroad canopy of the open sky above them.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Melicent, in surprise. Her exclamation was like a sigh of\r\nrelief which comes at the removal of some pressure from body or brain.\r\n\r\nThe wildness of the scene caught upon her erratic fancy, speeding it\r\nfor a quick moment into the realms of romance. She was an Indian\r\nmaiden of the far past, fleeing and seeking with her dusky lover some\r\nwild and solitary retreat on the borders of this lake, which offered\r\nthem no seeming foot-hold save such as they would hew themselves with\r\naxe or tomahawk. Here and there, a grim cypress lifted its head above\r\nthe water, and spread wide its moss covered arms inviting refuge to\r\nthe great black-winged buzzards that circled over and about it in\r\nmid-air. Nameless voices--weird sounds that awake in a Southern forest\r\nat twilight\'s approach,--were crying a sinister welcome to the\r\nsettling gloom.\r\n\r\n"This is a place thet can make a man sad, I tell you," said Gr\xe9goire,\r\nresting his oars, and wiping the moisture from his forehead. "I\r\nwouldn\'t want to be yere alone, not fur any money."\r\n\r\n"It is an awful place," replied Melicent with a little appreciative\r\nshudder; adding "do you consider me a bodily protection?" and feebly\r\nsmiling into his face.\r\n\r\n"Oh; I ain\'t \'fraid o\' any thing I can see an on\'erstan\'. I can han\'le\r\nmos\' any thing thet\'s got a body. But they do tell some mighty queer\r\ntales \'bout this lake an\' the pine hills yonda."\r\n\r\n"Queer--how?"\r\n\r\n"W\'y, ole McFarlane\'s buried up there on the hill; an\' they\'s folks\r\n\'round yere says he walks about o\' nights; can\'t res\' in his grave fur\r\nthe niggas he\'s killed."\r\n\r\n"Gracious! and who was old McFarlane?"\r\n\r\n"The meanest w\'ite man thet ever lived, seems like. Used to own this\r\nplace long befo\' the Lafirmes got it. They say he\'s the person that\r\nMrs. W\'at\'s her name wrote about in Uncle Tom\'s Cabin."\r\n\r\n"Legree? I wonder if it could be true?" Melicent asked with interest.\r\n\r\n"Thet\'s w\'at they all say: ask any body."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll take me to his grave, won\'t you Gr\xe9goire," she entreated.\r\n\r\n"Well, not this evenin\'--I reckon not. It\'ll have to be broad day, an\'\r\nthe sun shinin\' mighty bright w\'en I take you to ole McFarlane\'s\r\ngrave."\r\n\r\nThey had retraced their course and again entered the bayou, from which\r\nthe light had now nearly vanished, making it needful that they watch\r\ncarefully to escape the hewn logs that floated in numbers upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t suppose you were ever sad, Gr\xe9goire," Melicent said gently.\r\n\r\n"Oh my! yes;" with frank acknowledgment. "You ain\'t ever seen me w\'en\r\nI was real lonesome. \'Tain\'t so bad sence you come. But times w\'en I\r\ngit to thinkin\' \'bout home, I\'m boun\' to cry--seems like I can\'t he\'p\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why did you ever leave home?" she asked sympathetically.\r\n\r\n"You see w\'en father died, fo\' year ago, mother she went back to\r\nFrance, t\'her folks there; she never could stan\' this country--an\'\r\nlef\' us boys to manage the place. Hec, he took charge the firs\' year\r\nan\' run it in debt. Placide an\' me did\'n\' have no betta luck the naxt\r\nyear. Then the creditors come up from New Orleans an\' took holt.\r\nThat\'s the time I packed my duds an\' lef\'."\r\n\r\n"And you came here?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at firs\'. You see the Santien boys had a putty hard name in\r\nthe country. Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se, she\'d fallen out with father years ago\r\n\'bout the way, she said, he was bringin\' us up. Father, he wasn\'t the\r\nman to take nothin\' from nobody. Never \'lowed any of us to come down\r\nyere. I was in Texas, goin\' to the devil I reckon, w\'en she sent for\r\nme, an\' yere I am."\r\n\r\n"And here you ought to stay, Gr\xe9goire."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they ain\'t no betta woman in the worl\' then Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se, w\'en\r\nyou do like she wants. See \'em yonda waitin\' fur us? Reckon they\r\nthought we was drowned."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA Small Interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Melicent came to visit her brother, Mrs. Lafirme persuaded him to\r\nabandon his uncomfortable quarters at the mill and take up his\r\nresidence in the cottage, which stood just beyond the lawn of the big\r\nhouse. This cottage had been furnished _de pied en cap_ many years\r\nbefore, in readiness against an excess of visitors, which in days gone\r\nby was not of infrequent occurrence at Place-du-Bois. It was\r\nMelicent\'s delighted intention to keep house here. And she foresaw no\r\nobstacle in the way of procuring the needed domestic aid in a place\r\nwhich was clearly swarming with idle women and children.\r\n\r\n"Got a cook yet, Mel?" was Hosmer\'s daily enquiry on returning home,\r\nto which Melicent was as often forced to admit that she had no cook,\r\nbut was not without abundant hope of procuring one.\r\n\r\nBetsy\'s Aunt Cynthy had promised with a sincerity which admitted not\r\nof doubt, that "de Lord willin\'\xa0" she would "be on han\' Monday, time\r\nto make de mornin\' coffee." Which assurance had afforded Melicent a\r\nSunday free of disturbing doubts concerning the future of her\r\nundertaking. But who may know what the morrow will bring forth? Cynthy\r\nhad been "tuck sick in de night." So ran the statement of the wee\r\npickaninny who appeared at Melicent\'s gate many hours later than\r\nmorning coffee time: delivering his message in a high voice of\r\ncomplaint, and disappearing like a vision without further word.\r\n\r\nUncle Hiram, then called to the breach, had staked his patriarchal\r\nhonor on the appearance of his niece Suze on Tuesday. Melicent and\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se meeting Suze some days later in a field path, asked the cause\r\nof her bad faith. The girl showed them all the white teeth which\r\nnature had lavished on her, saying with the best natured laugh in the\r\nworld: "I don\' know how come I didn\' git dere Chewsday like I\r\npromise."\r\n\r\nIf the ladies were not disposed to consider that an all-sufficient\r\nreason, so much the worse, for Suze had no other to offer.\r\n\r\nFrom Mose\'s wife, Minervy, better things might have been expected. But\r\nafter a solemn engagement to take charge of Melicent\'s kitchen on\r\nWednesday, the dusky matron suddenly awoke to the need of "holpin\'\r\nMose hoe out dat co\'n in the stiff lan."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se, seeing that the girl was really eager to play in the brief\r\nrole of housekeeper had used her powers, persuasive and authoritative,\r\nto procure servants for her, but without avail. She herself was not\r\nwithout an abundance of them, from the white-haired Hiram, whose\r\nposition on the place had long been a sinecure, down to the little\r\nbrown legged tot Mandy, much given to falling asleep in the sun, when\r\nnot chasing venturesome poultry off forbidden ground, or stirring\r\ngentle breezes with an enormous palm leaf fan about her mistress\r\nduring that lady\'s after dinner nap.\r\n\r\nWhen pressed to give a reason for this apparent disinclination of the\r\nnegroes to work for the Hosmers, Nathan, who was at the moment being\r\ninterviewed on the front veranda by Th\xe9r\xe8se and Melicent, spoke out.\r\n\r\n"Dey \'low \'roun\' yere, dat you\'s mean to de black folks, ma\'am: dat\r\nwhat dey says--I don\' know me."\r\n\r\n"Mean," cried Melicent, amazed, "in what way, pray?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, all sort o\' ways," he admitted, with a certain shy brazenness;\r\ndetermined to go through with the ordeal.\r\n\r\n"Dey \'low you wants to cut de little gals\' plaits off, an\' sich--I\r\ndon\' know me."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose, Nathan," said Th\xe9r\xe8se attempting but poorly to hide\r\nher amusement at Melicent\'s look of dismay, "that Miss Hosmer would\r\nbother herself with darkies\' plaits?"\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s w\'at I tink m\'sef. Anyways, I\'ll sen\' Ar\'minty \'roun\'\r\nto-morrow, sho."\r\n\r\nMelicent was not without the guilty remembrance of having one day\r\nplayfully seized one of the small Mandy\'s bristling plaits, daintily\r\nbetween finger and thumb, threatening to cut them all away with the\r\nscissors which she carried. Yet she could not but believe that there\r\nwas some deeper motive underlying this systematic reluctance of the\r\nnegroes to give their work in exchange for the very good pay which she\r\noffered. Th\xe9r\xe8se soon enlightened her with the information that the\r\nnegroes were very averse to working for Northern people whose speech,\r\nmanners, and attitude towards themselves were unfamiliar. She was\r\ngiven the consoling assurance of not being the only victim of this\r\nboycott, as Th\xe9r\xe8se recalled many examples of strangers whom she knew\r\nto have met with a like cavalier treatment at the darkies\' hands.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Araminty never appeared.\r\n\r\nHosmer and Melicent were induced to accept Mrs. Lafirme\'s generous\r\nhospitality; and one of that lady\'s many supernumeraries was detailed\r\neach morning to "do up" Miss Melicent\'s rooms, but not without the\r\nprevious understanding that the work formed part of Miss T\'r\xe8se\'s\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nNothing which had happened during the year of his residence at\r\nPlace-du-Bois had furnished Hosmer such amusement as these\r\nmisadventures of his sister Melicent, he having had no like experience\r\nwith his mill hands.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that his good humor was partly due to the\r\nacceptable arrangement which assured him the daily society of Th\xe9r\xe8se,\r\nwhose presence was growing into a need with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn the Pine Woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Gr\xe9goire said to Melicent that there was no better woman in the\r\nworld than his Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se, "W\'en you do like she wants," the\r\nstatement was so incomplete as to leave one in uncomfortable doubt of\r\nthe expediency of venturing within the influence of so exacting a\r\nnature. True, Th\xe9r\xe8se required certain conduct from others, but she\r\nwas willing to further its accomplishment by personal efforts, even\r\nsacrifices--that could leave no doubt of the pure unselfishness of her\r\nmotive. There was hardly a soul at Place-du-Bois who had not felt the\r\nforce of her will and yielded to its gentle influence.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Jo\xe7int as she had last seen him, stayed with her, till\r\nit gave form to a troubled desire moving her to see him again and\r\nspeak with him. He had always been an unruly subject, inclined to a\r\nsurreptitious defiance of authority. Repeatedly had he been given work\r\non the plantation and as many times dismissed for various causes.\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se would have long since removed him had it not been for his old\r\nfather Morico, whose long life spent on the place had established a\r\nclaim upon her tolerance.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon, when the shadows of the magnolias were\r\nstretching in grotesque lengths across the lawn, Th\xe9r\xe8se stood waiting\r\nfor Uncle Hiram to bring her sleek bay Beauregard around to the front.\r\nThe dark close fitting habit which she wore lent brilliancy to her\r\nsoft blonde coloring; and there was no mark of years about her face or\r\nfigure, save the settling of a thoughtful shadow upon the eyes, which\r\njoys and sorrows that were past and gone had left there.\r\n\r\nAs she rode by the cottage, Melicent came out on the porch to wave a\r\nlaughing good-bye. The girl was engaged in effacing the simplicity of\r\nher rooms with certain bizarre decorations that seemed the promptings\r\nof a disordered imagination. Yards of fantastic calico had been\r\nbrought up from the store, which Gr\xe9goire with hammer and tacks was\r\namiably forming into impossible designs at the prompting of the girl.\r\nThe little darkies had been enlisted to bring their contributions of\r\npalm branches, pine cones, ferns, and bright hued bird wings--and a\r\nrow of those small recruits stood on the porch, gaping in wide-mouthed\r\nadmiration at a sight that stirred within their breasts such remnant\r\nof savage instinct as past generations had left there in dormant\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\nOne of the small audience permitted her attention to be drawn for a\r\nmoment from the gorgeous in-door spectacle, to follow the movements of\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\n"Jis\' look Miss T\'r\xe8se how she go a lopin\' down de lane. Dere she\r\ngo--dere she go--now she gone," and she again became contemplative.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se, after crossing the railroad, for a space kept to the brow of\r\nthe hill where stretched a well defined road, which by almost\r\nimperceptible degrees led deeper and always higher into the woods.\r\nPresently, leaving this road and turning into a bridle path where an\r\nunpracticed eye would have discovered no sign of travel, she rode on\r\nuntil reaching a small clearing among the pines, in the center of\r\nwhich stood a very old and weather beaten cabin.\r\n\r\nHere she dismounted, before Morico knew of her presence, for he sat\r\nwith his back partly turned to the open door. As she entered and\r\ngreeted him, he arose from his chair, all trembling with excitement at\r\nher visit; the long white locks, straggling and unkept, falling about\r\nhis brown visage that had grown old and weather beaten with his cabin.\r\nSinking down into his seat--the hide covered chair that had been worn\r\nsmooth by years of usefulness--he gazed well pleased at Th\xe9r\xe8se, who\r\nseated herself beside him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, this is quite the handsomest you have made yet, Morico," she said\r\naddressing him in French, and taking up the fan that he was curiously\r\nfashioning of turkey feathers.\r\n\r\n"I am taking extra pains with it," he answered, looking complacently\r\nat his handiwork and smoothing down the glossy feathers with the ends\r\nof his withered old fingers. "I thought the American lady down at the\r\nhouse might want to buy it."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se could safely assure him of Melicent\'s willingness to seize on\r\nthe trophy.\r\n\r\nThen she asked why Jo\xe7int had not been to the house with news of him.\r\n"I have had chickens and eggs for you, and no way of sending them."\r\n\r\nAt mention of his son\'s name, the old man\'s face clouded with\r\ndispleasure and his hand trembled so that he was at some pains to\r\nplace the feather which he was at the moment adding to the widening\r\nfan.\r\n\r\n"Jo\xe7int is a bad son, madame, when even you have been able to do\r\nnothing with him. The trouble that boy has given me no one knows; but\r\nlet him not think I am too old to give him a sound drubbing."\r\n\r\nJo\xe7int meanwhile had returned from the mill and seeing Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s horse\r\nfastened before his door, was at first inclined to skulk back into the\r\nwoods; but an impulse of defiance moved him to enter, and gave to his\r\nugly countenance a look that was far from agreeable as he mumbled a\r\ngreeting to Th\xe9r\xe8se. His father he did not address. The old man looked\r\nfrom son to visitor with feeble expectancy of some good to come from\r\nher presence there.\r\n\r\nJo\xe7int\'s straight and coarse black hair hung in a heavy mop over his\r\nlow retreating forehead, almost meeting the ill-defined line of\r\neyebrow that straggled above small dusky black eyes, that with the\r\nrest of his physique was an inheritance from his Indian mother.\r\n\r\nApproaching the safe or _garde manger_, which was the most prominent\r\npiece of furniture in the room, he cut a wedge from the round loaf of\r\nheavy soggy corn bread that he found there, added a layer of fat pork,\r\nand proceeded to devour the unpalatable morsel with hungry relish.\r\n\r\n"That is but poor fare for your old father, Jo\xe7int," said Th\xe9r\xe8se,\r\nlooking steadily at the youth.\r\n\r\n"Well, I got no chance me, fu\' go fine nuttin in de \'ood" (woods), he\r\nanswered purposely in English, to annoy his father who did not\r\nunderstand the language.\r\n\r\n"But you are earning enough to buy him something better; and you know\r\nthere is always plenty at the house that I am willing to spare him."\r\n\r\n"I got no chance me fu\' go to de \'ouse neider," he replied\r\ndeliberately, after washing down the scant repast with a long draught\r\nfrom the tin bucket which he had replenished at the cistern before\r\nentering. He swallowed the water regardless of the "wiggles" whose\r\npresence was plainly visible.\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" asked Morico scanning Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s face appealingly.\r\n\r\n"He only says that work at the mill keeps him a good deal occupied,"\r\nshe said with attempted carelessness.\r\n\r\nAs she finished speaking, Jo\xe7int put on his battered felt hat, and\r\nstrode out the back door; his gun on his shoulder and a yellow cur\r\nfollowing close at his heels.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se remained a while longer with the old man, hearing\r\nsympathetically the long drawn story of his troubles, and cheering him\r\nas no one else in the world was able to do, then she went away.\r\n\r\nJo\xe7int was not the only one who had seen Beauregard fastened at\r\nMorico\'s door. Hosmer was making a tour of inspection that afternoon\r\nthrough the woods, and when he came suddenly upon Th\xe9r\xe8se some moments\r\nafter she had quitted the cabin, the meeting was not so wholly\r\naccidental as that lady fancied it was.\r\n\r\nIf there could be a situation in which Hosmer felt more than in\r\nanother at ease in Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s company, it was the one in which he found\r\nhimself. There was no need to seek occupation for his hands, those\r\nmembers being sufficiently engaged with the management of his horse.\r\nHis eyes found legitimate direction in following the various details\r\nwhich a rider is presumed to observe; and his manner freed from the\r\nnecessity of self direction took upon itself an ease which was\r\noccasional enough to mark it as noteworthy.\r\n\r\nShe told him of her visit. At mention of Jo\xe7int\'s name he reddened:\r\nthen followed the acknowledgment that the youth in question had caused\r\nhim to lose his temper and forget his dignity during the afternoon.\r\n\r\n"In what way?" asked Th\xe9r\xe8se. "It would be better to dismiss him than\r\nto rail at him. He takes reproof badly and is extremely treacherous."\r\n\r\n"Mill hands are not plentiful, or I should send him off at once. Oh,\r\nhe is an unbearable fellow. The men told me of a habit he has of\r\nletting the logs roll off the carriage, causing a good deal of\r\nannoyance and delay in replacing them. I was willing enough to believe\r\nit might be accidental, until I caught him today in the very act. I am\r\nthankful not to have knocked him down."\r\n\r\nHosmer felt exhilarated. The excitement of his encounter with Jo\xe7int\r\nhad not yet died away; this softly delicious atmosphere; the subtle\r\naroma of the pines; his unlooked for meeting with Th\xe9r\xe8se--all\r\ncombined to stir him with unusual emotions.\r\n\r\n"What a splendid creature Beauregard is," he said, smoothing the\r\nanimal\'s glossy mane with the end of his riding whip. The horses were\r\nwalking slowly in step, and close together.\r\n\r\n"Of course he is," said Th\xe9r\xe8se proudly, patting the arched neck of\r\nher favorite. "Beauregard is a blooded animal, remember. He quite\r\nthrows poor Nelson in the shade," looking pityingly at Hosmer\'s\r\nheavily built iron-grey.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cast any slurs on Nelson, Mrs. Lafirme. He\'s done me service\r\nthat\'s worthy of praise--worthy of better treatment than he gets."\r\n\r\n"I know. He deserves the best, poor fellow. When you go away you\r\nshould turn him out to pasture, and forbid any one to use him."\r\n\r\n"It would be a good idea; but--I\'m not so certain about going away."\r\n\r\n"Oh I beg your pardon. I fancied your movements were directed by some\r\nunchangeable laws."\r\n\r\n"Like the planets in their orbits? No, there is no absolute need of my\r\ngoing; the business which would have called me away can be done as\r\nreadily by letter. If I heed my inclination it certainly holds me\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand that. It\'s natural enough that I should be fond of\r\nthe country; but you--I don\'t believe you\'ve been away for three\r\nmonths, have you? and city life certainly has its attractions."\r\n\r\n"It\'s beastly," he answered decidedly. "I greatly prefer the\r\ncountry--this country; though I can imagine a condition under which it\r\nwould be less agreeable; insupportable, in fact."\r\n\r\nHe was looking fixedly at Th\xe9r\xe8se, who let her eyes rest for an\r\ninstant in the unaccustomed light of his, while she asked "and the\r\ncondition?"\r\n\r\n"If you were to go away. Oh! it would take the soul out of my life."\r\n\r\nIt was now her turn to look in all directions save the one in which\r\nhis glance invited her. At a slight and imperceptible motion of the\r\nbridle, well understood by Beauregard, the horse sprang forward into a\r\nquick canter, leaving Nelson and his rider to follow as they could.\r\n\r\nHosmer overtook her when she stopped to let her horse drink at the\r\nside of the hill where the sparkling spring water came trickling from\r\nthe moist rocks, and emptied into the long out-scooped trunk of a\r\ncypress, that served as trough. The two horses plunged their heads\r\ndeep in the clear water; the proud Beauregard quivering with\r\nsatisfaction, as arching his neck and shaking off the clinging\r\nmoisture, he waited for his more deliberate companion.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it give one a sympathetic pleasure," said Th\xe9r\xe8se, "to see\r\nthe relish with which they drink?"\r\n\r\n"I never thought of it," replied Hosmer, cynically. His face was\r\nunusually flushed, and diffidence was plainly seizing him again.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was now completely mistress of herself, and during the\r\nremainder of the ride she talked incessantly, giving him no chance for\r\nmore than the briefest answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMelicent Talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"David Hosmer, you are the most supremely unsatisfactory man\r\nexisting."\r\n\r\nHosmer had come in from his ride, and seating himself in the large\r\nwicker chair that stood in the center of the room, became at once\r\nabsorbed in reflections. Being addressed, he looked up at his sister,\r\nwho sat sidewards on the edge of a table slightly removed, swaying a\r\ndainty slippered foot to and fro in evident impatience.\r\n\r\n"What crime have I committed now, Melicent, against your code?" he\r\nasked, not fully aroused from his reverie.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve committed nothing; your sin is one of omission. I absolutely\r\nbelieve you go through the world with your eyes, to all practical\r\npurposes, closed. Don\'t you notice anything; any change?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I do," said Hosmer, relying on a knowledge lent him by\r\nprevious similar experiences, and taking in the clinging artistic\r\ndrapery that enfolded her tall spare figure, "you\'ve a new gown on. I\r\ndidn\'t think to mention it, but I noticed it all the same."\r\n\r\nThis admission of a discernment that he had failed to make evident,\r\naroused Melicent\'s uncontrolled mirth.\r\n\r\n"A new gown!" and she laughed heartily. "A threadbare remnant! A thing\r\nthat holds by shreds and tatters."\r\n\r\nShe went behind her brother\'s chair, taking his face between her\r\nhands, and turning it upward, kissed him on the forehead. With his\r\nhead in such position, he could not fail to observe the brilliant\r\nfolds of muslin that were arranged across the ceiling to simulate the\r\ncanopy of a tent. Still holding his face, she moved it sidewards, so\r\nthat his eyes, knowing now what office was expected of them, followed\r\nthe line of decorations about the room.\r\n\r\n"It\'s immense, Mel; perfectly immense. When did you do it all?"\r\n\r\n"This afternoon, with Gr\xe9goire\'s help," she answered, looking proudly\r\nat her work. "And my poor hands are in such condition! But really,\r\nDave," she continued, seating herself on the side of his chair, with\r\nan arm about his neck, and he leaning his head back on the improvised\r\ncushion, "I wonder that you ever got on in business, observing things\r\nas little as you do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s different."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t believe you see half that you ought to," adding\r\nnaively, "How did you and Mrs. Lafirme happen to come home together\r\nthis evening?"\r\n\r\nThe bright lamp-light made the flush quite evident that arose to his\r\nface under her near gaze.\r\n\r\n"We met in the woods; she was coming from Morico\'s."\r\n\r\n"David, do you know that woman is an angel. She\'s simply the most\r\nperfect creature I ever knew."\r\n\r\nMelicent\'s emphasis of speech was a thing so recurrent, so singularly\r\nher own, as to startle an unaccustomed hearer.\r\n\r\n"That opinion might carry some weight, Mel, if I hadn\'t heard it\r\nscores of times from you, and of as many different women."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you have not. Mrs. Lafirme is exceptional. Really, when she\r\nstands at the end of the veranda, giving orders to those darkies, her\r\nface a little flushed, she\'s positively a queen."\r\n\r\n"As far as queenliness may be compatible with the angelic state,"\r\nreplied Hosmer, but not ill pleased with Melicent\'s exaggerated praise\r\nof Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\nNeither had heard a noiseless step approaching, and they only became\r\naware of an added human presence, when Mandy\'s small voice was heard\r\nto issue from Mandy\'s small body which stood in the mingled light and\r\nshadow of the door-way.\r\n\r\n"Aunt B\'lindy \'low supper on de table gittin\' cole."\r\n\r\n"Come here, Mandy," cried Melicent, springing after the child. But\r\nMandy was flying back through the darkness. She was afraid of\r\nMelicent.\r\n\r\nLaughing heartily, the girl disappeared into her bedroom, to make some\r\nneeded additions to her toilet; and Hosmer, waiting for her, returned\r\nto his interrupted reflections. The words which he had spoken during a\r\nmoment of emotion to Th\xe9r\xe8se, out in the piny woods, had served a\r\ndouble purpose with him. They had shown him more plainly than he had\r\nquite been certain of, the depth of his feeling for her; and also had\r\nthey settled his determination. He was not versed in the reading of a\r\nwoman\'s nature, and he found himself at a loss to interpret Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s\r\nactions. He recalled how she had looked away from him when he had\r\nspoken the few tender words that were yet whirling in his memory; how\r\nshe had impetuously ridden ahead,--leaving him to follow alone; and\r\nher incessant speech that had forced him into silence. All of which\r\nmight or might not be symptoms in his favor. He remembered her kind\r\nsolicitude for his comfort and happiness during the past year; but he\r\nas readily recalled that he had not been the only recipient of such\r\nfavors. His reflections led to no certainty, except that he loved her\r\nand meant to tell her so.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se\'s door being closed, and moreover locked, Aunt Belindy, the\r\nstout negress who had superintended the laying of supper, felt free to\r\ngive low speech to her wrath as she went back and forth between\r\ndining-room and kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Suppa gittin\' dat cole \'tain\' gwine be fittin\' fu\' de dogs te\' tech.\r\nBelieve half de time w\'ite folks ain\'t got no feelin\'s, no how. If dey\r\nspeck I\'se gwine stan\' up heah on my two feet all night, dey\'s foolin\'\r\ndey sef. I ain\'t gwine do it. Git out dat doo\' you Mandy! you want me\r\ndash dis heah coffee pot at you--blockin\' up de doo\'s dat away? W\'ar\r\ndat good fu\' nuttin Betsy? Look yonda, how she done flung dem dere\r\nknife an forks on de table. Jis let Miss T\'r\xe8se kotch\'er. Good God\r\nA\'mighty, Miss T\'r\xe8se mus\' done gone asleep. G\'long dar an\' see."\r\n\r\nThere was no one on the plantation who would have felt at liberty to\r\nenter Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s bedroom without permission, the door being closed; yet\r\nshe had taken the needless precaution of bringing lock and bolt to the\r\ndouble security of her moment of solitude. The first announcement of\r\nsupper had found her still in her riding habit, with head thrown back\r\nupon the cushion of her lounging chair, and her mind steeped in a\r\nsemi-stupor that it would be injustice to her brighter moments to call\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was a warm-hearted woman, and a woman of clear mental vision;\r\na combination not found so often together as to make it ordinary.\r\nBeing a woman of warm heart, she had loved her husband with the\r\ndevotion which good husbands deserve; but being a clear-headed woman,\r\nshe was not disposed to rebel against the changes which Time brings,\r\nwhen so disposed, to the human sensibilities. She was not steeped in\r\nthat agony of remorse which many might consider becoming in a widow of\r\nfive years\' standing at the discovery that her heart which had fitted\r\nwell the holding of a treasure, was not narrowed to the holding of a\r\nmemory,--the treasure being gone.\r\n\r\nMandy\'s feeble knock at the door was answered by her mistress in\r\nperson who had now banished all traces of her ride and its resultant\r\ncogitations.\r\n\r\nThe two women, with Hosmer and Gr\xe9goire, sat out on the veranda after\r\nsupper as their custom was during these warm summer evenings. There\r\nwas no attempt at sustained conversation; they talked by snatches to\r\nand at one another, of the day\'s small events; Melicent and Gr\xe9goire\r\nhaving by far the most to say. The girl was half reclining in the\r\nhammock which she kept in a slow, unceasing motion by the impetus of\r\nher slender foot; he sitting some distance removed on the steps.\r\nHosmer was noticeably silent; even Jo\xe7int as a theme failing to rouse\r\nhim to more than a few words of dismissal. His will and tenacity were\r\ncontrolling him to one bent. He had made up his mind that he had\r\nsomething to say to Mrs. Lafirme, and he was impatient at any enforced\r\ndelay in the telling.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire slept now in the office of the mill, as a measure of\r\nprecaution. To-night, Hosmer had received certain late telegrams that\r\nnecessitated a return to the mill, and his iron-grey was standing\r\noutside in the lane with Gr\xe9goire\'s horse, awaiting the pleasure of\r\nhis rider. When Gr\xe9goire quitted the group to go and throw the saddles\r\nacross the patient animals, Melicent, who contemplated an additional\r\nhour\'s chat with Th\xe9r\xe8se, crossed over to the cottage to procure a\r\nlight wrap for her sensitive shoulders against the chill night air.\r\nHosmer, who had started to the assistance of Gr\xe9goire, seeing that\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se had remained alone, standing at the top of the stairs,\r\napproached her. Remaining a few steps below her, and looking up into\r\nher face, he held out his hand to say good-night, which was an unusual\r\nproceeding, for they had not shaken hands since his return to\r\nPlace-du-Bois three months before. She gave him her soft hand to hold\r\nand as the warm, moist palm met his, it acted like a charged electric\r\nbattery turning its subtle force upon his sensitive nerves.\r\n\r\n"Will you let me talk to you to-morrow?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps; if I have time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you will make the time. I can\'t let the day go by without telling\r\nyou many things that you ought to have known long ago." The battery\r\nwas still doing its work. "And I can\'t let the night go by without\r\ntelling you that I love you."\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire called out that the horses were ready. Melicent was\r\napproaching in her diaphanous envelope, and Hosmer reluctantly let\r\ndrop Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s hand and left her.\r\n\r\nAs the men rode away, the two women stood silently following their\r\ndiminishing outlines into the darkness and listening to the creaking\r\nof the saddles and the dull regular thud of the horses\' feet upon the\r\nsoft earth, until the sounds grew inaudible, when they turned to the\r\ninner shelter of the veranda. Melicent once more possessed herself of\r\nthe hammock in which she now reclined fully, and Th\xe9r\xe8se sat near\r\nenough beside her to intertwine her fingers between the tense cords.\r\n\r\n"What a great difference in age there must be between you and your\r\nbrother," she said, breaking the silence.\r\n\r\n"Yes--though he is younger and I older than you perhaps think. He was\r\nfifteen and the only child when I was born. I am twenty-four, so he of\r\ncourse is thirty-nine."\r\n\r\n"I certainly thought him older."\r\n\r\n"Just imagine, Mrs. Lafirme, I was only ten when both my parents died.\r\nWe had no kindred living in the West, and I positively rebelled\r\nagainst being separated from David; so you see he\'s had the care of me\r\nfor a good many years."\r\n\r\n"He appears very fond of you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not only that, but you\'ve no idea how splendidly he\'s done for me\r\nin every way. Looked after my interest and all that, so that I\'m\r\nperfectly independent. Poor Dave," she continued, heaving a profound\r\nsigh, "he\'s had more than his share of trouble, if ever a man had. I\r\nwonder when his day of compensation will come."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think," ventured Th\xe9r\xe8se, "that we make too much of our\r\nindividual trials. We are all so prone to believe our own burden\r\nheavier than our neighbor\'s."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps--but there can be no question about the weight of David\'s.\r\nI\'m not a bit selfish about him though; poor fellow, I only wish he\'d\r\nmarry again."\r\n\r\nMelicent\'s last words stung Th\xe9r\xe8se like an insult. Her native pride\r\nrebelled against the reticence of this man who had shared her\r\nconfidence while keeping her in ignorance of so important a feature of\r\nhis own life. But her dignity would not permit a show of disturbance;\r\nshe only asked:--\r\n\r\n"How long has his wife been dead?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Melicent, in dismay. "I thought you knew of course;\r\nwhy--she isn\'t dead at all--they were divorced two years ago."\r\n\r\nThe girl felt intuitively that she had yielded to an indiscretion of\r\nspeech. She could not know David\'s will in the matter, but since he\r\nhad all along left Mrs. Lafirme in ignorance of his domestic trials,\r\nshe concluded it was not for her to enlighten that lady further. Her\r\nnext remark was to call Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s attention to the unusual number of\r\nglow-worms that were flashing through the darkness, and to ask the\r\nsign of it, adding "every thing seems to be the sign of something down\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Belindy might tell you," replied Th\xe9r\xe8se, "I only know that I\r\nfeel the signs of being very sleepy after that ride through the woods\r\nto-day. Don\'t mind if I say good night?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. Good night, dear Mrs. Lafirme. Let me stay here till\r\nDavid comes back; I should die of fright, to go to the cottage alone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nPainful Disclosures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se possessed an independence of thought exceptional enough when\r\nconsidered in relation to her life and its surrounding conditions. But\r\nas a woman who lived in close contact with her fellow-beings she was\r\nlittle given to the consideration of abstract ideas, except in so far\r\nas they touched the individual man. If ever asked to give her opinion\r\nof divorce, she might have replied that the question being one which\r\ndid not immediately concern her, its remoteness had removed it from\r\nthe range of her inquiry. She felt vaguely that in many cases it might\r\nbe a blessing; conceding that it must not infrequently be a necessity,\r\nto be appealed to however only in an extremity beyond which endurance\r\ncould scarcely hold. With the prejudices of her Catholic education\r\ncoloring her sentiment, she instinctively shrank when the theme\r\nconfronted her as one having even a remote reference to her own clean\r\nexistence. There was no question with her of dwelling upon the matter;\r\nit was simply a thing to be summarily dismissed and as far as possible\r\neffaced from her remembrance.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se had not reached the age of thirty-five without learning that\r\nlife presents many insurmountable obstacles which must be accepted,\r\nwhether with the callousness of philosophy, the revolt of weakness or\r\nthe dignity of self-respect. The following morning, the only sign\r\nwhich she gave of her mental disturbance, was an appearance that might\r\nhave succeeded a night of unrefreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nHosmer had decided that his interview with Mrs. Lafirme should not be\r\nleft further to the caprice of accident. An hour or more before noon\r\nhe rode up from the mill knowing it to be a time when he would likely\r\nfind her alone. Not seeing her he proceeded to make inquiry of the\r\nservants; first appealing to Betsy.\r\n\r\n"I don\' know whar Miss T\'r\xe8se," with a rising inflection on the\r\n"whar." "I yain\'t seed her sence mornin\', time she sont Unc\' Hi\'um\r\nyonda to old Morico wid de light bread an\' truck," replied the verbose\r\nBetsy. "Aunt B\'lindy, you know whar Miss T\'r\xe8se?"\r\n\r\n"How you want me know? standin\' up everlastin\' in de kitchen a bakin\'\r\nlight-bread fu\' lazy trash det betta be in de fiel\' wurkin\' a crap\r\nlike people, stid o\' \'pendin\' on yeda folks."\r\n\r\nMandy, who had been a silent listener, divining that she had perhaps\r\nbetter make known certain information that was exclusively her own\r\npiped out:--\r\n\r\n"Miss T\'r\xe8se shet up in de parla; \'low she want we all lef \'er\r\n\'lone."\r\n\r\nHaving as it were forced an entrance into the stronghold where Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nhad supposed herself secure from intrusion, Hosmer at once seated\r\nhimself beside her.\r\n\r\nThis was a room kept for the most part closed during the summer days\r\nwhen the family lived chiefly on the verandas or in the wide open hall\r\nThere lingered about it the foreign scent of cool clean matting,\r\nmingled with a faint odor of rose which came from a curious Japanese\r\njar that stood on the ample hearth. Through the green half-closed\r\nshutters the air came in gentle ripples, sweeping the filmy curtains\r\nback and forth in irregular undulations. A few tasteful pictures hung\r\nupon the walls, alternating with family portraits, for the most part\r\nstiff and unhandsome, except in the case of such as were of so remote\r\ndate that age gave them a claim upon the interest and admiration of a\r\nfar removed generation.\r\n\r\nIt was not entirely clear to the darkies whether this room were not a\r\nsort of holy sanctuary, where one should scarce be permitted to\r\nbreathe, except under compulsion of a driving necessity.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lafirme," began Hosmer, "Melicent tells me that she made you\r\nacquainted last night with the matter which I wished to talk to you\r\nabout to-day."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Th\xe9r\xe8se replied, closing the book which she had made a pretense\r\nof reading, and laying it down upon the window-sill near which she\r\nsat; adding very simply, "Why did you not tell me long ago, Mr.\r\nHosmer?"\r\n\r\n"God knows," he replied; the sharp conviction breaking upon him, that\r\nthis disclosure had some how changed the aspect of life for him.\r\n"Natural reluctance to speak of a thing so painful--native\r\nreticence--I don\'t know what. I hope you forgive me; that you will let\r\nit make no difference in whatever regard you may have for me."\r\n\r\n"I had better tell you at once that there must be no repetition of--of\r\nwhat you told me last night."\r\n\r\nHosmer had feared it. He made no protest in words; his revolt was\r\ninward and showed itself only in an added pallor and increased\r\nrigidity of face lines. He arose and went to a near window, peering\r\nfor a while aimlessly out between the partly open slats.\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of your being a Catholic," he said, finally turning\r\ntowards her with folded arms.\r\n\r\n"Because you have never seen any outward signs of it. But I can\'t\r\nleave you under a false impression: religion doesn\'t influence my\r\nreason in this."\r\n\r\n"Do you think then that a man who has had such misfortune, should be\r\ndebarred the happiness which a second marriage could give him?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor a woman either, if it suit her moral principle, which I hold\r\nto be something peculiarly one\'s own."\r\n\r\n"That seems to me to be a prejudice," he replied. "Prejudices may be\r\nset aside by an effort of the will," catching at a glimmer of hope.\r\n\r\n"There are some prejudices which a woman can\'t afford to part with,\r\nMr. Hosmer," she said a little haughtily, "even at the price of\r\nhappiness. Please say no more about it, think no more of it."\r\n\r\nHe seated himself again, facing her; and looking at him all her\r\nsympathetic nature was moved at sight of his evident trouble.\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it. I would like to know every thing in your life," she\r\nsaid, feelingly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very good of you," he said, holding a hand for a moment over his\r\nclosed eyes. Then looking up abruptly, "It was a painful enough\r\nexperience, but I never dreamed that it could have had this last blow\r\nin reserve for me."\r\n\r\n"When did you marry?" she asked, wishing to start him with the story\r\nwhich she fancied he would feel better for the telling.\r\n\r\n"Ten years ago. I am a poor hand to analyze character: my own or\r\nanother\'s. My reasons for doing certain things have never been quite\r\nclear to me; or I have never schooled myself to inquiry into my own\r\nmotives for action. I have been always thoroughly the business man. I\r\ndon\'t make a boast of it, but I have no reason to be ashamed of the\r\nadmission. Socially, I have mingled little with my fellow-beings,\r\nespecially with women, whose society has had little attraction for me;\r\nperhaps, because I have never been thrown much into it, and I was\r\nnearly thirty when I first met my wife."\r\n\r\n"Was it in St. Louis?" Th\xe9r\xe8se asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I had been inveigled into going on a river excursion," he said,\r\nplunging into the story, "Heaven knows how. Perhaps I was feeling\r\nunwell--I really can\'t remember. But at all events I met a friend who\r\nintroduced me early in the day to a young girl--Fanny Larimore. She\r\nwas a pretty little thing, not more than twenty, all pink and white\r\nand merry blue eyes and stylish clothes. Whatever it was, there was\r\nsomething about her that kept me at her side all day. Every word and\r\nmovement of hers had an exaggerated importance for me. I fancied such\r\nthings had never been said or done quite in the same way before."\r\n\r\n"You were in love," sighed Th\xe9r\xe8se. Why the sigh she could not have\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n"I presume so. Well, after that, I found myself thinking of her at the\r\nmost inopportune moments. I went to see her again and again--my first\r\nimpression deepened, and in two weeks I had asked her to marry me. I\r\ncan safely say, we knew nothing of each other\'s character. After\r\nmarriage, matters went well enough for a while." Hosmer here arose,\r\nand walked the length of the room.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lafirme," he said, "can\'t you understand that it must be a\r\npainful thing for a man to disparage one woman to another: the woman\r\nwho has been his wife to the woman he loves? Spare me the rest."\r\n\r\n"Please have no reservations with me; I shall not misjudge you in any\r\ncase," an inexplicable something was moving her to know what remained\r\nto be told.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t long before she attempted to draw me into what she called\r\nsociety," Hosmer continued. "I am little versed in defining shades of\r\ndistinction between classes, but I had seen from the beginning that\r\nFanny\'s associates were not of the best social rank by any means. I\r\nhad vaguely expected her to turn from them, I suppose, when she\r\nmarried. Naturally, I resisted anything so distasteful as being\r\ndragged through rounds of amusement that had no sort of attraction\r\nwhatever for me. Besides, my business connections were extending, and\r\nthey claimed the greater part of my time and thoughts.\r\n\r\n"A year after our marriage our boy was born." Here Hosmer ceased\r\nspeaking for a while, seemingly under pressure of a crowding of\r\npainful memories.\r\n\r\n"The child whose picture you have at the office?" asked Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Yes," and he resumed with plain effort: "It seemed for a while that\r\nthe baby would give its mother what distraction she sought so\r\npersistently away from home; but its influence did not last and she\r\nsoon grew as restless as before. Finally there was nothing that united\r\nus except the child. I can\'t really say that we were united through\r\nhim, but our love for the boy was the one feeling that we had in\r\ncommon. When he was three years old, he died. Melicent had come to\r\nlive with us after leaving school. She was a high-spirited girl full\r\nof conceits as she is now, and in her exaggerated way became filled\r\nwith horror of what she called the m\xe9salliance I had made. After a\r\nmonth she went away to live with friends. I didn\'t oppose her. I saw\r\nlittle of my wife, being often away from home; but as feebly observant\r\nas I was, I had now and again marked a peculiarity of manner about her\r\nthat vaguely troubled me. She seemed to avoid me and we grew more and\r\nmore divided.\r\n\r\n"One day I returned home rather early. Melicent was with me. We found\r\nFanny in the dining-room lying on the sofa. As we entered, she looked\r\nat us wildly and in striving to get up grasped aimlessly at the back\r\nof a chair. I felt on a sudden as if there were some awful calamity\r\nthreatening my existence. I suppose, I looked helplessly at Melicent,\r\nmanaging to ask her what was the matter with my wife. Melicent\'s black\r\neyes were flashing indignation. \'Can\'t you see she\'s been drinking.\r\nGod help you,\' she said. Mrs. Lafirme, you know now the reason which\r\ndrove me away from home and kept me away. I never permitted my wife to\r\nwant for the comforts of life during my absence; but she sued for\r\ndivorce some years ago and it was granted, with alimony which I\r\ndoubled. You know the miserable story now. Pardon me for dragging it\r\nto such a length. I don\'t see why I should have told it after all."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se had remained perfectly silent; rigid at times, listening to\r\nHosmer often with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nHe waited for her to speak, but she said nothing for a while till\r\nfinally: "Your--your wife is still quite young--do her parents live\r\nwith her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, she has none. I suppose she lives alone."\r\n\r\n"And those habits; you don\'t know if she continues them?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say she does. I know nothing of her, except that she receipts\r\nfor the amount paid her each month."\r\n\r\nThe look of painful thought deepened on Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s face but her\r\nquestions having been answered, she again became silent.\r\n\r\nHosmer\'s eyes were imploring her for a look, but she would not answer\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you a word to say to me?" he entreated.\r\n\r\n"No, I have nothing to say, except what would give you pain."\r\n\r\n"I can bear anything from you," he replied, at a loss to guess her\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n"The kindest thing I can say, Mr. Hosmer, is, that I hope you have\r\nacted blindly. I hate to believe that the man I care for, would\r\ndeliberately act the part of a cruel egotist."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"I have learned one thing through your story, which appears very plain\r\nto me," she replied. "You married a woman of weak character. You\r\nfurnished her with every means to increase that weakness, and shut her\r\nout absolutely from your life and yourself from hers. You left her\r\nthen as practically without moral support as you have certainly done\r\nnow, in deserting her. It was the act of a coward." Th\xe9r\xe8se spoke the\r\nlast words with intensity.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that a man owes nothing to himself?" Hosmer asked, in\r\nresistance to her accusation.\r\n\r\n"Yes. A man owes to his manhood, to face the consequences of his own\r\nactions."\r\n\r\nHosmer had remained seated. He did not even with glance follow Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nwho had arisen and was moving restlessly about the room. He had so\r\nlong seen himself as a martyr; his mind had become so habituated to\r\nthe picture, that he could not of a sudden look at a different one,\r\nbelieving that it could be the true one. Nor was he eager to accept a\r\nview of the situation that would place him in his own eyes in a\r\ncontemptible light. He tried to think that Th\xe9r\xe8se must be wrong; but\r\neven admitting a doubt of her being right, her words carried an\r\nelement of truth that he was not able to shut out from his conscience.\r\nHe felt her to be a woman with moral perceptions keener than his own\r\nand his love, which in the past twenty-four hours had grown to\r\noverwhelm him, moved him now to a blind submission.\r\n\r\n"What would you have me do, Mrs. Lafirme?"\r\n\r\n"I would have you do what is right," she said eagerly, approaching\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"O, don\'t present me any questions of right and wrong; can\'t you see\r\nthat I\'m blind?" he said, self accusingly. "What ever I do, must be\r\nbecause you want it; because I love you."\r\n\r\nShe was standing beside him and he took her hand.\r\n\r\n"To do a thing out of love for you, would be the only comfort and\r\nstrength left me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that," she entreated. "Love isn\'t everything in life; there\r\nis something higher."\r\n\r\n"God in heaven, there shouldn\'t be!" he exclaimed, passionately\r\npressing her hand to his forehead, his cheek, his lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t make it harder for me," Th\xe9r\xe8se said softly, attempting to\r\nwithdraw her hand.\r\n\r\nIt was her first sign of weakness, and he seized on it for his\r\nadvantage. He arose quickly--unhesitatingly--and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\nFor a moment that was very brief, there was danger that the task of\r\nrenunciation would not only be made harder, but impossible, for both;\r\nfor it was in utter blindness to everything but love for each other,\r\nthat their lips met.\r\n\r\nThe great plantation bell was clanging out the hour of noon; the hour\r\nfor sweet and restful enjoyment; but to Hosmer, the sound was like the\r\nvoice of a derisive demon, mocking his anguish of spirit, as he\r\nmounted his horse, and rode back to the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTreats of Melicent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelicent knew that there were exchanges of confidence going on between\r\nher brother and Mrs. Lafirme, from which she was excluded. She had\r\nnoted certain lengthy conferences held in remote corners of the\r\nverandas. The two had deliberately withdrawn one moonlight evening to\r\npace to and fro the length of gravel walk that stretched from door\r\nfront to lane; and Melicent had fancied that they rather lingered when\r\nunder the deep shadow of the two great live-oaks that overarched the\r\ngate. But that of course was fancy; a young girl\'s weakness to think\r\nthe world must go as she would want it to.\r\n\r\nShe was quite sure of having heard Mrs. Lafirme say "I will help you."\r\nCould it be that David had fallen into financial straights and wanted\r\nassistance from Th\xe9r\xe8se? No, that was improbable and furthermore,\r\ndistasteful, so Melicent would not burden herself with the suspicion.\r\nIt was far more agreeable to believe that affairs were shaping\r\nthemselves according to her wishes regarding her brother and her\r\nfriend. Yet her mystification was in no wise made clearer, when David\r\nleft them to go to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nMelicent was not ready or willing to leave with him. She had not had\r\nher "visit out" as she informed him, when he proposed it to her. To\r\nremain in the cottage during his absence was out of the question, so\r\nshe removed herself and all her pretty belongings over to the house,\r\ntaking possession of one of the many spare rooms. The act of removal\r\nfurnished her much entertainment of a mild sort, into which, however,\r\nshe successfully infused something of her own intensity by making the\r\noccasion one to bring a large detachment of the plantation force into\r\nher capricious service.\r\n\r\nMelicent was going out, and she stood before her mirror to make sure\r\nthat she looked properly. She was black from head to foot. From the\r\ngreat ostrich plume that nodded over her wide-brimmed hat, to the\r\npointed toe of the patent leather boot that peeped from under her\r\ngown--a filmy gauzy thing setting loosely to her slender shapely\r\nfigure. She laughed at the somberness of her reflection, which she at\r\nonce set about relieving with a great bunch of geraniums--big and\r\nscarlet and long-stemmed, that she thrust slantwise through her belt.\r\n\r\nMelicent, always charming, was very pretty when she laughed. She\r\nthought so herself and laughed a second time into the depths of her\r\ndark handsome eyes. One corner of the large mouth turned saucily\r\nupward, and the lips holding their own crimson and all that the cheeks\r\nwere lacking, parted only a little over the gleaming whiteness of her\r\nteeth. As she looked at herself critically, she thought that a few\r\nmore pounds of flesh would have well become her. It had been only the\r\nother day that her slimness was altogether to her liking; but at\r\npresent she was in love with plumpness as typified in Mrs. Lafirme.\r\nHowever, on the whole, she was not ill pleased with her appearance,\r\nand gathering up her gloves and parasol, she quitted the room.\r\n\r\nIt was "broad day," one of the requirements which Gr\xe9goire had named\r\nas essential for taking Melicent to visit old McFarlane\'s grave. But\r\nthe sun was not "shining mighty bright," the second condition, and\r\nwhose absence they were willing enough to overlook, seeing that the\r\nmonth was September.\r\n\r\nThey had climbed quite to the top of the hill, and stood on the very\r\nbrink of the deep toilsome railroad cut all fringed with matted grass\r\nand young pines, that had but lately sprung there. Up and down the\r\ntrack, as far as they could see on either side the steel rails\r\nglittered on into gradual dimness. There were patches of the field\r\nbefore them, white with bursting cotton which scores of negroes, men,\r\nwomen and children were dexterously picking and thrusting into great\r\nbags that hung from their shoulders and dragged beside them on the\r\nground; no machine having yet been found to surpass the sufficiency of\r\nfive human fingers for wrenching the cotton from its tenacious hold.\r\nElsewhere, there were squads "pulling fodder" from the dry corn\r\nstalks; hot and distasteful work enough. In the nearest field, where\r\nthe cotton was young and green, with no show of ripening, the overseer\r\nrode slowly between the rows, sprinkling plentifully the dry powder of\r\nparis green from two muslin bags attached to the ends of a short pole\r\nthat lay before him across the saddle.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire\'s presence would be needed later in the day, when the cotton\r\nwas hauled to gin to be weighed; when the mules were brought to\r\nstable, to see them properly fed and cared for, and the gearing all\r\nput in place. In the meanwhile he was deliciously idle with Melicent.\r\n\r\nThey retreated into the woods, soon losing sight of everything but the\r\ntrees that surrounded them and the underbrush, that was scant and\r\nscattered over the turf which the height of the trees permitted to\r\ngrow green and luxuriant.\r\n\r\nThere, on the far slope of the hill they found McFarlane\'s grave,\r\nwhich they knew to be such only by the battered and weather-worn cross\r\nof wood, that lurched disreputably to one side--there being no hand in\r\nall the world that cared enough to make it straight--and from which\r\nall lettering had long since been washed away. This cross was all that\r\nmarked the abiding place of that mist-like form, so often seen at dark\r\nto stalk down the hill with threatening stride, or of moonlight nights\r\nto cross the lake in a pirogue, whose substance though visible was\r\nnought; with sound of dipping oars that made no ripple on the lake\'s\r\nsmooth surface. On stormy nights, some more gifted with spiritual\r\ninsight than their neighbors, and with hearing better sharpened to\r\ndelicate intonations of the supernatural, had not only seen the mist\r\nfigure mounted and flying across the hills, but had heard the panting\r\nof the blood-hounds, as the invisible pack swept by in hot pursuit of\r\nthe slave so long ago at rest.\r\n\r\nBut it was "broad day," and here was nothing sinister to cause\r\nMelicent the least little thrill of awe. No owl, no bat, no ill-omened\r\ncreature hovering near; only a mocking bird high up in the branches of\r\na tall pine tree, gushing forth his shrill staccatoes as blithely as\r\nthough he sang paeans to a translated soul in paradise.\r\n\r\n"Poor old McFarlane," said Melicent, "I\'ll pay a little tribute to his\r\nmemory; I dare say his spirit has listened to nothing but abuse of\r\nhimself there in the other world, since it left his body here on the\r\nhill;" and she took one of the long-stemmed blood-red flowers and laid\r\nit beside the toppling cross.\r\n\r\n"I reckon he\'s in a place w\'ere flowers don\'t git much waterin\', if\r\nthey got any there."\r\n\r\n"Shame to talk so cruelly; I don\'t believe in such places."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t believe in hell?" he asked in blank surprise.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I\'m a Unitarian."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s new to me," was his only comment.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe in spirits, Gr\xe9goire? I don\'t--in day time."\r\n\r\n"Neva mine \'bout spirits," he answered, taking her arm and leading her\r\noff, "let\'s git away f\'om yere."\r\n\r\nThey soon found a smooth and gentle slope where Melicent sat herself\r\ncomfortably down, her back against the broad support of a tree trunk,\r\nand Gr\xe9goire lay prone upon the ground with--his head in Melicent\'s\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nWhen Melicent first met Gr\xe9goire, his peculiarities of speech, so\r\nunfamiliar to her, seemed to remove him at once from the possibility\r\nof her consideration. She was not then awake to certain fine\r\npsychological differences distinguishing man from man; precluding the\r\npossibility of naming and classifying him in the moral as one might in\r\nthe animal kingdom. But short-comings of language, which finally\r\nseemed not to detract from a definite inheritance of good breeding,\r\ntouched his personality as a physical deformation might, adding to it\r\ncertainly no charm, yet from its pathological aspect not without a\r\nspecies of fascination, for a certain order of misregulated mind.\r\n\r\nShe bore with him, and then she liked him. Finally, whilst indulging\r\nin a little introspection; making a diagnosis of various symptoms,\r\nindicative by no means of a deep-seated malady, she decided that she\r\nwas in love with Gr\xe9goire. But the admission embraced the\r\nunderstanding with herself, that nothing could come of it. She\r\naccepted it as a phase of that relentless fate which in pessimistic\r\nmoments she was inclined to believe pursued her.\r\n\r\nIt could not be thought of, that she should marry a man whose\r\neccentricity of speech would certainly not adapt itself to the\r\nrequirements of polite society.\r\n\r\nHe had kissed her one day. Whatever there was about the kiss--possibly\r\nan over exuberance--it was not to her liking, and she forbade that he\r\never repeat it, under pain of losing her affection. Indeed, on the few\r\noccasions when Melicent had been engaged, kissing had been excluded as\r\nsuperfluous to the relationship, except in the case of the young\r\nlieutenant out at Fort Leavenworth who read Tennyson to her, as an\r\nangel might be supposed to read, and who in moments of rapturous\r\nself-forgetfulness, was permitted to kiss her under the ear: a\r\nproceeding not positively distasteful to Melicent, except in so much\r\nas it tickled her.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire\'s hair was soft, not so dark as her own, and possessed an\r\ninclination to curl about her slender fingers.\r\n\r\n"Gr\xe9goire," she said, "you told me once that the Santien boys were a\r\nhard lot; what did you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no," he answered, laughing good-humoredly up into her eyes, "you\r\ndid\'n year me right. W\'at I said was that we had a hard name in the\r\ncountry. I don\' see w\'y eitha, excep\' we all\'ays done putty much like\r\nwe wanted. But my! a man can live like a saint yere at Place-du-Bois,\r\nthey ain\'t no temptations o\' no kine."\r\n\r\n"There\'s little merit in your right doing, if you have no temptations\r\nto withstand," delivering the time worn aphorism with the air and tone\r\nof a pretty sage, giving utterance to an inspired truth.\r\n\r\nMelicent felt that she did not fully know Gr\xe9goire; that he had always\r\nbeen more or less under restraint with her, and she was troubled by\r\nsomething other than curiosity to get at the truth concerning him. One\r\nday when she was arranging a vase of flowers at a table on the back\r\nporch, Aunt Belindy, who was scouring knives at the same table, had\r\nfollowed Gr\xe9goire with her glance, when he walked away after\r\nexchanging a few words with Melicent.\r\n\r\n"God! but dats a diffunt man sence you come heah."\r\n\r\n"Different?" questioned the girl eagerly, and casting a quick sideward\r\nlook at Aunt Belindy.\r\n\r\n"Lord yas honey, \'f you warn\'t heah dat same Mista Gr\xe9gor \'d be in\r\nCentaville ev\'y Sunday, a raisin\' Cain. Humph--I knows \'im."\r\n\r\nMelicent would not permit herself to ask more, but picked up her vase\r\nof flowers and walked with it into the house; her comprehension of\r\nGr\xe9goire in no wise advanced by the newly acquired knowledge that he\r\nwas liable to "raise Cain" during her absence--a proceeding which she\r\ncould not too hastily condemn, considering her imperfect apprehension\r\nof what it might imply.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she would not allow her doubts to interfere with the\r\nkindness which she lavished on him, seeing that he loved her to\r\ndesperation. Was he not at this very moment looking up into her eyes,\r\nand talking of his misery and her cruelty? turning his face downward\r\nin her lap--as she knew to cry--for had she not already seen him lie\r\non the ground in an agony of tears, when she had told him he should\r\nnever kiss her again?\r\n\r\nAnd so they lingered in the woods, these two curious lovers, till the\r\nshadows grew so deep about old McFarlane\'s grave that they passed it\r\nby with hurried step and averted glance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nFace to Face.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a day of close and intense September heat, it had rained during\r\nthe night. And now the morning had followed chill and crisp, yet with\r\npossibilities of a genial sunshine breaking through the mist that had\r\nrisen at dawn from the great sluggish river and spread itself through\r\nthe mazes of the city.\r\n\r\nThe change was one to send invigorating thrills through the blood, and\r\nto quicken the step; to make one like the push and jostle of the\r\nmultitude that thronged the streets; to make one in love with\r\nintoxicating life, and impatient with the grudging dispensation that\r\nhad given to mankind no wings wherewith to fly.\r\n\r\nBut with no reacting warmth in his heart, the change had only made\r\nHosmer shiver and draw his coat closer about his chest, as he pushed\r\nhis way through the hurrying crowd.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis Exposition was in progress with all its many allurements\r\nthat had been heralded for months through the journals of the State.\r\n\r\nHence, the unusual press of people on the streets this bright\r\nSeptember morning. Home people, whose air of ownership to the\r\nsurroundings classified them at once, moving unobservantly about their\r\naffairs. Women and children from the near and rich country towns, in\r\nfor the Exposition and their fall shopping; wearing gowns of ultra\r\nfashionable tendencies; leaving in their toilets nothing to\r\nexpediency; taking no chances of so much as a ribbon or a loop set in\r\ndisaccordance with the book.\r\n\r\nThere were whole families from across the bridge, hurrying towards the\r\nExposition. Fathers and mothers, babies and grandmothers, with baskets\r\nof lunch and bundles of provisional necessities, in for the day.\r\n\r\nNothing would escape their observation nor elude their criticism, from\r\nthe creations in color lining the walls of the art gallery, to the\r\nmost intricate mechanism of inventive genius in the basement. All\r\nwould pass inspection, with drawing of comparison between the present,\r\nthe past year and the "year before," likely in a nasal drawl with the\r\nR\'s brought sharply out, leaving no doubt as to their utterance.\r\n\r\nThe newly married couple walking serenely through the crowd, young,\r\nsmiling, up-country, hand-in-hand; well pleased with themselves, with\r\ntheir new attire and newer jewelry, would likely have answered\r\nHosmer\'s "beg pardon" with amiability if he had knocked them down. But\r\nhe had only thrust them rather violently to one side in his eagerness\r\nto board the cable car that was dashing by, with no seeming\r\nwillingness to stay its mad flight. He still possessed the agility in\r\nhis unpracticed limbs to swing himself on the grip, where he took a\r\nfront seat, well buttoned up as to top-coat, and glad of the bodily\r\nrest that his half hour\'s ride would bring him.\r\n\r\nThe locality in which he descended presented some noticeable changes\r\nsince he had last been there. Formerly, it had been rather a quiet\r\nstreet, with a leisurely horse car depositing its passengers two\r\nblocks away to the north from it; awaking somewhat of afternoons when\r\nhordes of children held possession. But now the cable had come to\r\ndisturb its long repose, adding in the office, nothing to its\r\nattractiveness.\r\n\r\nThere was the drug store still at the corner, with the same\r\nproprietor, tilted back in his chair as of old, and as of old reading\r\nhis newspaper with only the change which a newly acquired pair of\r\nspectacles gave to his appearance. The "drug store boy" had unfolded\r\ninto manhood, plainly indicated by the mustache that in adding\r\nadornment and dignity to his person, had lifted him above the menial\r\noffice of window washing. A task relegated to a mustacheless urchin\r\nwith a leaning towards the surreptitious abstraction of caramels and\r\nchewing gum in the intervals of such manual engagements as did not\r\nrequire the co-operation of a strategic mind.\r\n\r\nWhere formerly had been the vacant lot "across the street," the Sunday\r\nafternoon elysium of the youthful base ball fiend from Biddle Street,\r\nnow stood a row of brand new pressed-brick "flats." Marvelous must\r\nhave been the architectural ingenuity which had contrived to unite so\r\nmany dwellings into so small a space. Before each spread a length of\r\nclosely clipped grass plot, and every miniature front door wore its\r\nfantastic window furnishing; each set of decorations having seemingly\r\nfired the next with efforts of surpassing elaboration.\r\n\r\nThe house at which Hosmer rang--a plain two-storied red brick,\r\nstanding close to the street--was very old-fashioned in face of its\r\nmodern opposite neighbors, and the recently metamorphosed dwelling\r\nnext door, that with added porches and appendages to tax man\'s faculty\r\nof conjecture, was no longer recognizable for what it had been. Even\r\nthe bell which he pulled was old-fashioned and its tingle might be\r\nheard throughout the house long after the servant had opened the door,\r\nif she were only reasonably alert to the summons. Its reverberations\r\nwere but dying away when Hosmer asked if Mrs. Larimore were in. Mrs.\r\nLarimore was in; an admission which seemed to hold in reserve a\r\ndefiant "And what if she is, sir."\r\n\r\nHosmer was relieved to find the little parlor into which he was\r\nushered, with its adjoining dining-room, much changed. The carpets\r\nwhich he and Fanny had gone out together to buy during the early days\r\nof their housekeeping, were replaced by rugs that lay upon the bare,\r\nwell polished floors. The wall paper was different; so were the\r\nhangings. The furniture had been newly re-covered. Only the small\r\nhousehold gods were as of old: things--trifles--that had never much\r\noccupied or impressed him, and that now, amid their altered\r\nsurroundings stirred no sentiment in him of either pleased or sad\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nIt had not been his wish to take his wife unawares, and he had\r\npreviously written her of his intended coming, yet without giving her\r\na clue for the reason of it.\r\n\r\nThere was an element of the bull-dog in Hosmer. Having made up his\r\nmind, he indulged in no regrets, in no nursing of if\'s and and\'s, but\r\nstood like a brave soldier to his post, not a post of danger,\r\ntrue--but one well supplied with discomfiting possibilities.\r\n\r\nAnd what had Homeyer said of it? He had railed of course as usual, at\r\nthe submission of a human destiny to the exacting and ignorant rule of\r\nwhat he termed moral conventionalities. He had startled and angered\r\nHosmer with his denunciation of Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s sophistical guidance.\r\nRather--he proposed--let Hosmer and Th\xe9r\xe8se marry, and if Fanny were\r\nto be redeemed--though he pooh-poohed the notion as untenable with\r\ncertain views of what he called the rights to existence: the existence\r\nof wrongs--sorrows--diseases--death--let them all go to make up the\r\nconglomerate whole--and let the individual man hold on to his\r\npersonality. But if she must be redeemed--granting this point to their\r\nlittleness, let the redemption come by different ways than those of\r\nsacrifice: let it be an outcome from the capability of their united\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nHosmer did not listen to his friend Homeyer. Love was his god now, and\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was Love\'s prophet.\r\n\r\nSo he was sitting in this little parlor waiting for Fanny to come.\r\n\r\nShe came after an interval that had been given over to the indulgence\r\nof a little feminine nervousness. Through the open doors Hosmer could\r\nhear her coming down the back stairs; could hear that she halted\r\nmid-way. Then she passed through the dining-room, and he arose and\r\nwent to meet her, holding out his hand, which she was not at once\r\nready to accept, being flustered and unprepared for his manner in\r\nwhichever way it might direct itself.\r\n\r\nThey sat opposite each other and remained for a while silent; he with\r\nastonishment at sight of the "merry blue eyes" faded and sunken into\r\ndeep, dark round sockets; at the net-work of little lines all traced\r\nabout the mouth and eyes, and spreading over the once rounded cheeks\r\nthat were now hollow and evidently pale or sallow, beneath a layer of\r\nrouge that had been laid on with an unsparing hand. Yet was she still\r\npretty, or pleasing, especially to a strong nature that would find an\r\nappeal in the pathetic weakness of her face. There was no guessing at\r\nwhat her figure might be, it was disguised under a very fashionable\r\ndress, and a worsted shawl covered her shoulders, which occasionally\r\nquivered as with an inward chill. She spoke first, twisting the end of\r\nthis shawl.\r\n\r\n"What did you come for, David? why did you come now?" with peevish\r\nresistance to the disturbance of his coming.\r\n\r\n"I know I have come without warrant," he said, answering her\r\nimplication. "I have been led to see--no matter how--that I made\r\nmistakes in the past, and what I want to do now is to right them, if\r\nyou will let me."\r\n\r\nThis was very unexpected to her, and it startled her, but neither with\r\npleasure nor pain; only with an uneasiness which showed itself in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Have you been ill?" he asked suddenly as the details of change in her\r\nappearance commenced to unfold themselves to him.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not since last winter, when I had pneumonia so bad. They\r\nthought I was going to die. Dr. Franklin said I would \'a died if Belle\r\nWorthington hadn\'t \'a took such good care of me. But I don\'t see what\r\nyou mean coming now. It\'ll be the same thing over again: I don\'t see\r\nwhat\'s the use, David."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t talk about the use, Fanny. I want to take care of you for\r\nthe rest of your life--or mine--as I promised to do ten years ago; and\r\nI want you to let me do it."\r\n\r\n"It would be the same thing over again," she reiterated, helplessly.\r\n\r\n"It will not be the same," he answered positively. "I will not be the\r\nsame, and that will make all the difference needful."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what you want to do it for, David. Why we\'d haf to get\r\nmarried over again and all that, wouldn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he answered with a faint smile. "I\'m living in the South\r\nnow, in Louisiana, managing a sawmill down there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t like the South. I went down to Memphis, let\'s see, it was\r\nlast spring, with Belle and Lou Dawson, after I\'d been sick; and I\r\ndon\'t see how a person can live down there."\r\n\r\n"You would like the place where I\'m living. It\'s a fine large\r\nplantation, and the lady who owns it would be the best of friends to\r\nyou. She knew why I was coming, and told me to say she would help to\r\nmake your life a happy one if she could."\r\n\r\n"It\'s her told you to come," she replied in quick resentment. "I don\'t\r\nsee what business it is of hers."\r\n\r\nFanny Larimore\'s strength of determination was not one to hold against\r\nHosmer\'s will set to a purpose, during the hour or more that they\r\ntalked, he proposing, she finally acquiescing. And when he left her,\r\nit was with a gathering peace in her heart to feel that his nearness\r\nwas something that would belong to her again; but differently as he\r\nassured her. And she believed him, knowing that he would stand to his\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nHer life was sometimes very blank in the intervals of street\r\nperambulations and matin\xe9es and reading of morbid literature. That\r\nelation which she had felt over her marriage with Hosmer ten years\r\nbefore, had soon died away, together with her weak love for him, when\r\nshe began to dread him and defy him. But now that he said he was ready\r\nto take care of her and be good to her, she felt great comfort in her\r\nknowledge of his honesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nFanny\'s Friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the day following Hosmer\'s visit, that Mrs. Lorenzo\r\nWorthington, familiarly known to her friends as Belle Worthington, was\r\noccupied in constructing a careful and extremely elaborate street\r\ntoilet before her dressing bureau which stood near the front window of\r\none of the "flats" opposite Mrs. Larimore\'s. The Nottingham curtain\r\nscreened her effectually from the view of passers-by without hindering\r\nher frequent observance of what transpired in the street.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of this lady\'s figure was draped, or better,\r\nseemingly supported, by an abundance of stiffly starched white\r\npetticoats that rustled audibly at her slightest movement. Her neck\r\nwas bare, as were the well shaped arms that for the past five minutes\r\nhad been poised in mid-air, in the arrangement of a front of\r\nexquisitely soft blonde curls, which she had taken from her "top\r\ndrawer" and was adjusting, with the aid of a multitude of tiny\r\ninvisible hair-pins, to her own very smoothly brushed hair. Yellow\r\nhair it was, with a suspicious darkness about the roots, and a\r\nstreakiness about the back, that to an observant eye would have more\r\nthan hinted that art had assisted nature in coloring Mrs.\r\nWorthington\'s locks.\r\n\r\nDressed, and evidently waiting with forced patience for the\r\ntermination of these overhead maneuvers of her friend, sat Lou,--Mrs.\r\nJack Dawson,--a woman whom most people called handsome. If she were\r\nhandsome, no one could have told why, for her beauty was a thing which\r\ncould not be defined. She was tall and thin, with hair, eyes, and\r\ncomplexion of a brownish neutral tint, and bore in face and figure, a\r\nstamp of defiance which probably accounted for a certain eccentricity\r\nin eschewing hair dyes and cosmetics. Her face was full of little\r\nirregularities; a hardly perceptible cast in one eye; the nose drawn a\r\nbit to one side, and the mouth twitched decidedly to the other when\r\nshe talked or laughed. It was this misproportion which gave a piquancy\r\nto her expression and which in charming people, no doubt made them\r\nbelieve her handsome.\r\n\r\nMrs. Worthington\'s coiffure being completed, she regaled herself with\r\na deliberate and comprehensive glance into the street, and the outcome\r\nof her observation was the sudden exclamation.\r\n\r\n"Well I\'ll be switched! come here quick Lou. If there ain\'t Fanny\r\nLarimore getting on the car with Dave Hosmer!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawson approached the window, but without haste; and in no wise\r\nsharing her friend\'s excitement, gave utterance to her calm opinion.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve made it up, I\'ll bet you what you want."\r\n\r\nSurprise seemed for the moment to have deprived Mrs. Worthington of\r\nfurther ability to proceed with her toilet, for she had fallen into a\r\nchair as limply as her starched condition would permit, her face full\r\nof speculation.\r\n\r\n"See here, Belle Worthington, if we\'ve got to be at the \'Lympic at two\r\no\'clock, you\'d better be getting a move on yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; but I declare, you might knock me down with a feather."\r\n\r\nA highly overwrought figure of speech on the part of Mrs. Worthington,\r\nseeing that the feather which would have prostrated her must have met\r\na resistance of some one hundred and seventy-five pounds of solid\r\navoirdupois.\r\n\r\n"After all she said about him, too!" seeking to draw her friend into\r\nsome participation in her own dumbfoundedness.\r\n\r\n"Well, you ought to know Fanny Larimore\'s a fool, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but I just can\'t get over it; that\'s all there is about it."\r\nAnd Mrs. Worthington went about completing the adornment of her person\r\nin a state of voiceless stupefaction.\r\n\r\nIn full garb, she presented the figure of a splendid woman; trim and\r\ntight in a black silk gown of expensive quality, heavy with jets which\r\nhung and shone, and jangled from every available point of her person.\r\nNot a thread of her yellow hair was misplaced. She shone with\r\ncleanliness, and her broad expressionless face and meaningless blue\r\neyes were set to a good-humored readiness for laughter, which would be\r\nwholesome if not musical. She exhaled a fragrance of patchouly or\r\njockey-club, or something odorous and "strong" that clung to every\r\narticle of her apparel, even to the yellow kid gloves which she would\r\nnow be forced to put on during her ride in the car. Mrs. Dawson,\r\nattired with equal richness and style, showed more of individuality in\r\nher toilet.\r\n\r\nAs they quitted the house she observed to her friend:\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d let up on that smell; it\'s enough to sicken a body."\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t like it, Lou," was Mrs. Worthington\'s apologetic and\r\nhalf disconcerted reply, "and I was careful as could be. Give you my\r\nword, I didn\'t think you could notice it."\r\n\r\n"Notice it? Gee!" responded Mrs. Dawson.\r\n\r\nThese were two ladies of elegant leisure, the conditions of whose\r\nlives, and the amiability of whose husbands, had enabled them to\r\ndevelop into finished and professional time-killers.\r\n\r\nTheir intimacy with each other, as also their close acquaintance with\r\nFanny Larimore, dated from a couple of years after that lady\'s\r\nmarriage, when they had met as occupants of the same big up-town\r\nboarding house. The intercourse had never since been permitted to die\r\nout. Once, when the two former ladies were on a visit to Mrs.\r\nLarimore, seeing the flats in course of construction, they were at\r\nonce assailed with the desire to abandon their hitherto nomadic life,\r\nand settle to the responsibilities of housekeeping; a scheme which\r\nthey carried into effect as soon as the houses became habitable.\r\n\r\nThere was a Mr. Lorenzo Worthington; a gentleman employed for many\r\nyears past in the custom house. Whether he had been overlooked, which\r\nhis small unobtrusive, narrow-chested person made possible--or whether\r\nhis many-sided usefulness had rendered him in a manner indispensable\r\nto his employers, does not appear; but he had remained at his post\r\nduring the various changes of administration that had gone by since\r\nhis first appointment.\r\n\r\nDuring intervals of his work--intervals often occurring of afternoon\r\nhours, when he had been given night work--he was fond of sitting at\r\nthe sunny kitchen window, with his long thin nose, and shortsighted\r\neyes plunged between the pages of one of his precious books: a small\r\nhoard of which he had collected at some cost and more self-denial.\r\n\r\nOne of the grievances of his life was the necessity under which he\r\nfound himself of protecting his treasure from the Philistine abuse and\r\ncontempt of his wife. When they moved into the flat, Mrs. Worthington,\r\nduring her husband\'s absence, had ranged them all, systematically\r\nenough, on the top shelf of the kitchen closet to "get them out of the\r\nway." But at this he had protested, and taken a positive stand, to\r\nwhich his wife had so far yielded as to permit that they be placed on\r\nthe top shelf of the bedroom closet; averring that to have them laying\r\naround was a thing that she would not do, for they spoilt the looks of\r\nany room.\r\n\r\nHe had not foreseen the possibility of their usefulness being a\r\ntemptation to his wife in so handy a receptacle.\r\n\r\nSeeking once a volume of Ruskin\'s Miscellanies, he discovered that it\r\nhad been employed to support the dismantled leg of a dressing bureau.\r\nOn another occasion, a volume of Schopenhauer, which he had been at\r\nmuch difficulty and expense to procure, Emerson\'s Essays, and two\r\nother volumes much prized, he found had served that lady as weights to\r\nhold down a piece of dry goods which she had sponged and spread to dry\r\non an available section of roof top.\r\n\r\nHe was glad enough to transport them all back to the safer refuge of\r\nthe kitchen closet, and pay the hired girl a secret stipend to guard\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington regarded women as being of peculiar and unsuitable\r\nconformation to the various conditions of life amid which they are\r\nplaced; with strong moral proclivities, for the most part subservient\r\nto a weak and inadequate mentality.\r\n\r\nIt was not his office to remodel them; his r\xf4le was simply to endure\r\nwith patience the vagaries of an order of human beings, who after all,\r\noffered an interesting study to a man of speculative habit, apart from\r\ntheir usefulness as propagators of the species.\r\n\r\nAs regards this last qualification, Mrs. Worthington had done less\r\nthan her fair share, having but one child, a daughter of twelve, whose\r\ntraining and education had been assumed by an aunt of her father\'s, a\r\nnun of some standing in the Sacred Heart Convent.\r\n\r\nQuite a different type of man was Jack Dawson, Lou\'s husband. Short,\r\nround, young, blonde, good looking and bald--as what St. Louis man\r\npast thirty is not? he rejoiced in the agreeable calling of a\r\ntraveling salesman.\r\n\r\nOn the occasions when he was at home; once in two weeks--sometimes\r\nseldomer--never oftener--the small flat was turned inside out and\r\nupside down. He filled it with noise and merriment. If a theater party\r\nwere not on hand, it was a spin out to Forest park behind a fast team,\r\nclosing with a wine supper at a road-side restaurant. Or a card party\r\nwould be hastily gathered to which such neighbors as were congenial\r\nwere bid in hot haste; deficiencies being supplied from his large\r\ncircle of acquaintances who happened not to be on the road, and who at\r\nthe eleventh hour were rung up by telephone. On such occasions Jack\'s\r\nvoice would be heard loud in anecdote, introduced in some such wise as\r\n"When I was in Houston, Texas, the other day," or "Tell you what it\r\nis, sir, those fellers over in Albuquerque are up to a thing or two."\r\n\r\nOne of his standing witticisms was to inquire in a stage whisper of\r\nBelle or Lou--whether the little gal over the way had taken the pledge\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman and his wife were on the most amiable of terms\r\ntogether, barring the small grievance that he sometimes lost money at\r\npoker. But as losing was exceptional with him, and as he did not make\r\nit a matter of conscience to keep her at all times posted as to the\r\nfluctuations of his luck, this grievance had small occasion to show\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWhat he thought of his wife, might best be told in his own language:\r\nthat Lou was up to the mark and game every time; feminine\r\ncharacteristics which he apparently held in high esteem.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies in question had almost reached the terminus of their\r\nride, when Mrs. Worthington remarked incidentally to her friend, "It\r\nwas nothing in the God\'s world but pure sass brought those two fellers\r\nto see you last night, Lou."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawson bit her lip and the cast in her eye became more\r\naccentuated, as it was apt to do when she was ruffled.\r\n\r\n"I notice you didn\'t treat \'em any too cool yourself," she retorted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they weren\'t my company, or I\'d a give \'em a piece of my mind\r\npretty quick. You know they\'re married, and they know you\'re married,\r\nand they hadn\'t a bit o\' business there."\r\n\r\n"They\'re perfect gentlemen, and I don\'t see what business \'tis of\r\nyours, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Oh that\'s a horse of another color," replied Mrs. Worthington,\r\nbridling and relapsing into injured silence for the period of ten\r\nseconds, when she resumed, "I hope they ain\'t going to poke themselves\r\nat the matin\xe9e."\r\n\r\n"Likely they will \'s long as they gave us the tickets."\r\n\r\nOne of the gentlemen was at the matin\xe9e: Mr. Bert Rodney, but he\r\ncertainly had not "poked" himself there. He never did any thing vulgar\r\nor in bad taste. He had only "dropped in!" Exquisite in dress and\r\nmanner, a swell of the upper circles, versed as was no one better in\r\nthe code of gentlemanly etiquette--he was for the moment awaiting\r\ndisconsolately the return of his wife and daughter from Narragansett.\r\n\r\nHe took a vacant seat behind the two ladies, and bending forward began\r\nto talk to them in his low and fascinating drawl.\r\n\r\nMrs. Worthington, who often failed to accomplish her fierce designs,\r\nwas as gracious towards him as if she had harbored no desire to give\r\nhim a piece of her mind; but she was resolute in her refusal to make\r\none of a proposed supper party.\r\n\r\nA quiet sideward look from Mrs. Dawson, told Mr. Rodney as plainly as\r\nwords, that in the event of his _partie-carr\xe9e_ failing him, he might\r\ncount upon her for a _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe Self-Assumed Burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wedding was over. Hosmer and Fanny had been married in the small\r\nlibrary of their Unitarian minister whom they had found intent upon\r\nthe shaping of his Sunday sermon.\r\n\r\nOut of deference, he had been briefly told the outward circumstances\r\nof the case, which he knew already; for these two had been formerly\r\nmembers of his congregation, and gossip had not been reluctant in\r\ntelling their story. Hosmer, of course, had drifted away from his\r\nknowledge, and in late years, he had seen little of Fanny, who when\r\nmoved to attend church at all usually went to the Redemptorist\'s Rock\r\nChurch with her friend Belle Worthington. This lady was a good\r\nCatholic to the necessary extent of hearing a mass on Sundays,\r\nabstaining from meat on Fridays and Ember days, and making her\r\n"Easters." Which concessions were not without their attendant\r\ndiscomforts, counterbalanced, however, by the soothing assurance which\r\nthey gave her of keeping on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThe minister had been much impressed with the significance of this\r\nre-marriage which he was called upon to perform, and had offered some\r\nfew and well chosen expressions of salutary advice as to its future\r\nguidance. The sexton and housekeeper had been called in as witnesses.\r\nThen Hosmer had taken Fanny back home in a cab as she requested,\r\nbecause of her eyes that were red and swollen.\r\n\r\nInside the little hall-way he took her in his arms and kissed her,\r\ncalling her "my child." He could not have told why, except that it\r\nexpressed the responsibility he accepted of bearing all things that a\r\nfather must bear from the child to whom he has given life.\r\n\r\n"I should like to go out for an hour, Fanny; but if you would rather\r\nnot, I shall stay."\r\n\r\n"No, David, I want to be alone," she said, turning into the little\r\nparlor, with eyes big and heavy from weariness and inward clashing\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nAlong the length of Lindell avenue from Grand avenue west to Forest\r\npark, reaches for two miles on either side of the wide and well kept\r\ngravel drive a smooth stone walk, bordered its full extent with a\r\ndouble row of trees which were young and still uncertain, when Hosmer\r\nwalked between them.\r\n\r\nHad it been Sunday, he would have found himself making one of a\r\nfashionable throng of promenaders; it being at that time a fad with\r\nsociety people to walk to Forest park and back of a Sunday afternoon.\r\nDriving was then considered a respectable diversion only on the six\r\nwork days of the week.\r\n\r\nBut it was not Sunday and this inviting promenade was almost deserted.\r\nAn occasional laborer would walk clumsily by; apathetic; swinging his\r\ntin bucket and bearing some implement of toil with the yellow clay yet\r\nclinging to it. Or it might be a brace of strong-minded girls walking\r\nwith long and springing stride, which was then fashionable; looking\r\nnot to the right nor left; indulging in no exchange of friendly and\r\ngirlish chatter, but grimly intent upon the purpose of their walk.\r\n\r\nA steady line of vehicles was pushing on towards the park at the\r\nmoderate speed which the law required. On both sides the wide\r\nboulevard tasteful dwellings, many completed, but most of them in\r\ncourse of construction, were in constant view. Hosmer noted every\r\nthing, but absently; and yet he was not pre-occupied with thought. He\r\nfelt himself to be hurrying away from something that was fast\r\novertaking him, and his faculties for the moment were centered in the\r\nmere act of motion. It is said that motion is pleasurable to man. No\r\ndoubt, in connection with a healthy body and free mind, movement\r\nbrings to the normal human being a certain degree of enjoyment. But\r\nwhere the healthful conditions are only physical, rapid motion changes\r\nfrom a source of pleasure to one of mere expediency.\r\n\r\nSo long as Hosmer could walk he kept a certain pressing consciousness\r\nat bay. He would have liked to run if he had dared. Since he had\r\nentered the park there were constant trains of cars speeding somewhere\r\noverhead; he could hear them at near intervals clashing over the stone\r\nbridge. And there was not a train which passed that he did not long to\r\nbe at the front of it to measure and let out its speed. What a mad\r\nflight he would have given it, to make men hold their breath with\r\nterror! How he would have driven it till its end was death and\r\nchaos!--so much the better.\r\n\r\nThere suddenly formed in Hosmer\'s mind a sentence--sharp and distinct.\r\nWe are all conscious of such quick mental visions whether of words or\r\npictures, coming sometimes from a hidden and untraceable source,\r\nmaking us quiver with awe at this mysterious power of mind manifesting\r\nitself with the vividness of visible matter.\r\n\r\n"It was the act of a coward."\r\n\r\nThose were the words which checked him, and forbade him to go farther:\r\nwhich compelled him to turn about and face the reality of his\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nIt is no unusual sight, that of a man lying full length in the soft\r\ntender grass of some retired spot of Forest park--with his face hidden\r\nin his folded arms. To the few who may see him, if they speculate at\r\nall about him he sleeps or he rests his body after a day\'s fatigue.\r\n"Am I never to be the brave man?" thought Hosmer, "always the coward,\r\nflying even from my own thoughts?"\r\n\r\nHow hard to him was this unaccustomed task of dealing with moral\r\ndifficulties, which all through his life before, however lightly they\r\nhad come, he had shirked and avoided! He realized now, that there was\r\nto be no more of that. If he did not wish his life to end in\r\ndisgraceful shipwreck, he must take command and direction of it upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe had felt himself capable of stolid endurance since love had\r\ndeclared itself his guide and helper. But now--only to-day--something\r\nbeside had crept into his heart. Not something to be endured, but a\r\nthing to be strangled and thrust away. It was the demon of hate; so\r\nnew, so awful, so loathsome, he doubted that he could look it in the\r\nface and live.\r\n\r\nHere was the problem of his new existence.\r\n\r\nThe woman who had formerly made his life colorless and empty he had\r\nquietly turned his back upon, carrying with him a pity that was not\r\nuntender. But the woman who had unwittingly robbed him of all\r\npossibility of earthly happiness--he hated her. The woman who for the\r\nremainder of a life-time was to be in all the world the nearest thing\r\nto him, he hated her. He hated this woman of whom he must be careful,\r\nto whom he must be tender, and loyal and generous. And to give no sign\r\nor word but of kindness; to do no action that was not considerate, was\r\nthe task which destiny had thrust upon his honor.\r\n\r\nHe did not ask himself if it were possible of accomplishment. He had\r\nflung hesitancy away, to make room for the all-powerful "Must be."\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly back to his home. There was no need to run now;\r\nnothing pursued him. Should he quicken his pace or drag himself ever\r\nso slowly, it could henceforth make no difference. The burden from\r\nwhich he had fled was now banded upon him and not to be loosed, unless\r\nhe fling himself with it into forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nSevering Old Ties.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning from the matin\xe9e, Belle and her friend Lou Dawson, before\r\nentering their house, crossed over to Fanny\'s. Mrs. Worthington tried\r\nthe door and finding it fastened, rang the bell, then commenced to\r\nbeat a tattoo upon the pane with her knuckles; an ingenuous manner\r\nwhich she had of announcing her identity. Fanny opened to them\r\nherself, and the three walked into the parlor.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen you for a coon\'s age, Fanny," commenced Belle, "where\r\non earth have you been keeping yourself?"\r\n\r\n"You saw me yesterday breakfast time, when you came to borrow the\r\nwrapper pattern," returned Fanny, in serious resentment to her\r\nfriend\'s exaggeration.\r\n\r\n"And much good the old wrapper pattern did me: a mile too small every\r\nway, no matter how much I let out the seams. But see here--"\r\n\r\n"Belle\'s the biggest idiot about her size: there\'s no convincing her\r\nshe\'s not a sylph."\r\n\r\n"_Thank_ you, Mrs. Dawson."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a fact. Didn\'t you think Furgeson\'s scales were all wrong\r\nthe other day because you weighed a hundred and eighty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"O that\'s the day I had that heavy rep on."\r\n\r\n"Heavy nothing. We were coming over last night, Fanny, but we had\r\ncompany," continued Mrs. Dawson.\r\n\r\n"Who d\'you have?" asked Fanny mechanically and glad of the respite.\r\n\r\n"Bert Rodney and Mr. Grant. They\'re so anxious to meet you. I\'d \'a\r\nsent over for you, but Belle--"\r\n\r\n"See here, Fanny, what the mischief was Dave Hosmer doing here to-day,\r\nand going down town with you and all that sort o\' thing?"\r\n\r\nFanny flushed uneasily. "Have you seen the evening paper?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you want us to see the paper? we just come from the matin\xe9e."\r\n\r\n"David came yesterday," Fanny said working nervously at the window\r\nshade. "He\'d wrote me a note the postman brought right after you left\r\nwith the pattern. When you saw us getting on the car, we were going\r\ndown to Dr. Martin\'s, and we\'ve got married again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawson uttered a long, low whistle by way of comment. Mrs.\r\nWorthington gave vent to her usual "Well I\'ll be switched," which she\r\nwas capable of making expressive of every shade of astonishment, from\r\nthe lightest to the most pronounced; at the same time unfastening the\r\nbridle of her bonnet which plainly hindered her free respiration after\r\nsuch a shock.\r\n\r\n"Say that Fanny isn\'t sly, after that, Belle."\r\n\r\n"Sly? My God, she\'s a fool! If ever a woman had a snap! and to go to\r\nwork and let a man get around her like that."\r\n\r\nMrs. Worthington seemed powerless to express herself in anything but\r\ndisconnected exclamations.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do, Fanny?" asked Lou, who having aired all the\r\nastonishment which she cared to show, in her whistle, was collected\r\nenough to want her natural curiosity satisfied.\r\n\r\n"David\'s living down South. I guess we\'ll go down there pretty soon.\r\nSoon\'s he can get things fixed up here."\r\n\r\n"Where--down South?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. Somewheres in Louisiana."\r\n\r\n"It\'s to be hoped in New Orleans," spoke Belle didactically, "that\'s\r\nthe only decent place in Louisiana where a person could live."\r\n\r\n"No, \'tain\'t in New Orleans. He\'s got a saw mill somewheres down\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth! a saw mill?" shrieked Belle. Lou was looking\r\ncalmly resigned to the startling news.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I ain\'t going to live in a saw mill. I wisht you\'d all let me\r\nalone, any way," she returned pettishly. "There\'s a lady keeps a\r\nplantation, and that\'s where he lives."\r\n\r\n"Well of all the rigmaroles! a lady, and a saw mill and a plantation.\r\nIt\'s my opinion that man could make you believe black\'s white, Fanny\r\nLarimore."\r\n\r\nAs Hosmer approached his house, he felt mechanically in his pocket for\r\nhis latch key; so small a trick having come back to him with the old\r\nhabit of misery. Of course he found no key. His ring startled Fanny,\r\nwho at once sprang from her seat to open the door for him; but having\r\ntaken a few steps, she hesitated and irresolutely re-seated herself.\r\nIt was only his second ring that the servant unamiably condescended to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re going to take Fanny away from us, Mr. Hosmer," said Belle,\r\nwhen he had greeted them and seated himself beside Mrs. Dawson on the\r\nsmall sofa that stood between the door and window. Fanny sat at the\r\nadjoining window, and Mrs. Worthington in the center of the room;\r\nwhich was indeed so small a room that any one of them might have\r\nreached out and almost touched the hand of the others.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Fanny has agreed to go South with me," he answered briefly.\r\n"You\'re looking well, Mrs. Worthington."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Law yes, I\'m never sick. As I tell Mr. Worthington, he\'ll never\r\nget rid of me, unless he hires somebody to murder me. But I tell you\r\nwhat, you came pretty near not having any Fanny to take away with you.\r\nShe was the sickest woman! Did you tell him about it, Fanny? Come to\r\nthink of it, I guess the climate down there\'ll be the very thing to\r\nbring her round."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawson without offering apology interrupted her friend to inquire\r\nof Hosmer if his life in the South were not of the most interesting,\r\nand begging that he detail them something of it; with a look to\r\nindicate that she felt the deepest concern in anything that touched\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA masculine presence had always the effect of rousing Mrs. Dawson into\r\nan animation which was like the glow of a slumbering ember, when a\r\nstrong pressure of air is brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\nHosmer had always considered her an amiable woman, with rather\r\ndelicate perceptions; frivolous, but without the vulgarisms of Mrs.\r\nWorthington, and consequently a less objectionable friend for Fanny.\r\nHe answered, looking down into her eyes, which were full of\r\nattentiveness.\r\n\r\n"My life in the South is not one that you would think interesting. I\r\nlive in the country where there are no distractions such as you ladies\r\ncall amusements--and I work pretty hard. But it\'s the sort of life\r\nthat one grows attached to and finds himself longing for again if he\r\nhave occasion to change it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it must be very satisfying," she answered; for the moment\r\nperfectly sincere.\r\n\r\n"Oh very!" exclaimed Mrs. Worthington, with a loud and aggressive\r\nlaugh. "It would just suit you to a T, Lou, but how it\'s going to\r\nsatisfy Fanny! Well, I\'ve got nothing to say about it, thanks be; it\r\ndon\'t concern me."\r\n\r\n"If Fanny finds that she doesn\'t like it after a fair trial, she has\r\nthe privilege of saying so, and we shall come back again," he said\r\nlooking at his wife whose elevation of eyebrow, and droop of mouth\r\ngave her the expression of martyred resignation, which St. Lawrence\r\nmight have worn, when invited to make himself comfortable on the\r\ngridiron--so had Mrs. Worthington\'s words impressed her with the force\r\nof their prophetic meaning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawson politely hoped that Hosmer would not leave before Jack\r\ncame home; it would distress Jack beyond everything to return and find\r\nthat he had missed an old friend whom he thought so much of.\r\n\r\nHosmer could not say precisely when they would leave. He was in\r\npresent negotiation with a person who wanted to rent the house,\r\nfurnished; and just as soon as he could arrange a few business\r\ndetails, and Fanny could gather such belongings as she wished to take\r\nwith her they would go.\r\n\r\n"You seem mighty struck on Dave Hosmer, all of a sudden," remarked\r\nMrs. Worthington to her friend, as the two crossed over the street. "A\r\nfeller without any more feelings than a stick; it\'s what I always said\r\nabout him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I always did like Hosmer," replied Mrs. Dawson. "But I thought he\r\nhad more sense than to tie himself to that little gump again, after\r\nhe\'d had the luck to get rid of her."\r\n\r\nA few days later Jack came home. His return was made palpable to the\r\nentire neighborhood; for no cab ever announced itself with quite the\r\ndash and clatter and bang of door that Jack\'s cabs did.\r\n\r\nThe driver had staggered behind him under the weight of the huge\r\nyellow valise, and had been liberally paid for the service.\r\n\r\nImmediately the windows were thrown wide open, and the lace curtains\r\ndrawn aside until no smallest vestige of them remained visible from\r\nthe street. A condition of things which Mrs. Worthington upstairs\r\nbitterly resented, and naturally, spoiling as it necessarily did, the\r\ngeneral _coup d\'oeil_ of the flat to passers-by. But Mrs. Dawson had\r\nwon her husband\'s esteem by just such acts as this one of amiable\r\npermission to ventilate the house according to methods of his own and\r\nessentially masculine; regardless of dust that might be flying, or sun\r\nthat might be shining with disastrous results to the parlor carpet.\r\n\r\nClouds of tobacco smoke were seen to issue from the open windows.\r\nThose neighbors whose openings commanded a view of the Dawson\'s\r\nalley-gate might have noted the hired girl starting for the grocery\r\nwith unusual animation of step, and returning with her basket well\r\nstocked with beer and soda bottles--a provision made against a need\r\nfor "dutch-cocktails," likely to assail Jack during his hours of\r\ndomesticity.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the same hired girl, breathless from the multiplicity\r\nof errands which she had accomplished during the day, appeared at the\r\nHosmers with a message that Mrs. Dawson wanted them to "come over."\r\n\r\nThey were preparing to leave on the morrow, but concluded that they\r\ncould spare a few moments in which to bid adieu to their friends.\r\n\r\nJack met them at the very threshold, with warm and hearty\r\nhand-shaking, and loud protest when he learned that they had not come\r\nto spend the evening and that they were going away next day.\r\n\r\n"Great Scott! you\'re not leaving to-morrow? And I ain\'t going to have\r\na chance to get even with Mrs. Hosmer on that last deal? By Jove, she\r\nknows how to do it," he said, addressing Hosmer and holding Fanny\r\nfamiliarly by the elbow. "Drew to the middle, sir, and hang me, if she\r\ndidn\'t fill. Takes a woman to do that sort o\' thing; and me a laying\r\nfor her with three aces. Hello there, girls! here\'s Hosmer and Fanny,"\r\nin response to which summons his wife and Mrs. Worthington issued from\r\nthe depths of the dining-room, where they had been engaged in\r\npreparing certain refreshments for the expected guests.\r\n\r\n"See here, Lou, we\'ll have to fix it up some way to go and see them\r\noff to-morrow. If you\'d manage to lay over till Thursday I could join\r\nyou as far as Little Rock. But no, that\'s a fact," he added\r\nreflectively, "I\'ve got to be in Cincinnati on Thursday."\r\n\r\nThey had all entered the parlor, and Mrs. Worthington suggested that\r\nHosmer go up and make a visit to her husband, whom he would find up\r\nthere "poring over those everlasting books."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what\'s got into Mr. Worthington lately," she said, "he\'s\r\ngetting that religious. If it ain\'t the Bible he\'s poring over, well\r\nit\'s something or other just as bad."\r\n\r\nThe brightly burning light guided Hosmer to the kitchen, where he\r\nfound Lorenzo Worthington seated beside his student lamp at the table,\r\nwhich was covered with a neat red cloth. On the gas-stove was spread a\r\nsimilar cloth and the floor was covered with a shining oil-cloth.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington was startled, having already forgotten that his wife\r\nhad told him of Hosmer\'s return to St. Louis.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Hosmer, is this you? come, come into the parlor, this is no\r\nplace," shaking Hosmer\'s hand and motioning towards the parlor.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s very nice and cozy here, and I have only a moment to stay,"\r\nsaid Hosmer, seating himself beside the table on which the other had\r\nlaid his book, with his spectacles between the pages to mark his\r\nplace. Mr. Worthington then did a little hemming and hawing\r\npreparatory to saying something fitting the occasion; not wishing to\r\nbe hasty in offering the old established form of congratulation, in a\r\ncase whose peculiarity afforded him no precedential guide. Hosmer came\r\nto his relief by observing quite naturally that he and his wife had\r\ncome over to say good-bye, before leaving for the South, adding "no\r\ndoubt Mrs. Worthington has told you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, and I\'m sure we\'re very sorry to lose you; that is, Mrs.\r\nLarimore--I should say Mrs. Hosmer. Isabella will certainly regret her\r\ndeparture, I see them always together, you know."\r\n\r\n"You cling to your old habit, I see, Mr. Worthington," said Hosmer,\r\nindicating his meaning by a motion of the hand towards the book on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to a certain extent. Always within the forced limits, you\r\nunderstand. At this moment I am much interested in tracing the history\r\nof various religions which are known to us; those which have died out,\r\nas well as existing religions. It is curious, indeed, to note the\r\ncircumstances of their birth, their progress and inevitable death;\r\nseeming to follow the course of nations in such respect. And the\r\nsimilitude which stamps them all, is also a feature worthy of study.\r\nYou would perhaps be surprised, sir, to discover the points of\r\nresemblance which indicate in them a common origin. To observe the\r\nslight differences, indeed technical differences, distinguishing the\r\nIslam from the Hebrew, or both from the Christian religion. The creeds\r\nare obviously ramifications from the one deep-rooted trunk which we\r\ncall religion. Have you ever thought of this, Mr. Hosmer?"\r\n\r\n"No, I admit that I\'ve not gone into it. Homeyer would have me think\r\nthat all religions are but mythological creations invented to satisfy\r\na species of sentimentality--a morbid craving in man for the unknown\r\nand undemonstrable."\r\n\r\n"That is where he is wrong; where I must be permitted to differ from\r\nhim. As you would find, my dear sir, by following carefully the\r\nhistory of mankind, that the religious sentiment is implanted, a true\r\nand legitimate attribute of the human soul--with peremptory right to\r\nits existence. Whatever may be faulty in the creeds--that makes no\r\ndifference, the foundation is there and not to be dislodged. Homeyer,\r\nas I understand him from your former not infrequent references, is an\r\nIconoclast, who would tear down and leave devastation behind him;\r\nbuilding up nothing. He would deprive a clinging humanity of the\r\nsupports about which she twines herself, and leave her helpless and\r\nsprawling upon the earth."\r\n\r\n"No, no, he believes in a natural adjustment," interrupted Hosmer. "In\r\nan innate reserve force of accommodation. What we commonly call laws\r\nin nature, he styles accidents--in society, only arbitrary methods of\r\nexpediency, which, when they outlive their usefulness to an advancing\r\nand exacting civilization, should be set aside. He is a little\r\nimpatient to always wait for the inevitable natural adjustment."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear Mr. Hosmer, the world is certainly to-day not prepared to\r\nstand the lopping off and wrenching away of old traditions. She must\r\ntake her stand against such enemies of the conventional. Take religion\r\naway from the life of man--"\r\n\r\n"Well, I knew it--I was just as sure as preaching," burst out Mrs.\r\nWorthington, as she threw open the door and confronted the two\r\nmen--resplendent in "baby blue" and much steel ornamentation. "As I\r\ntell Mr. Worthington, he ought to turn Christian Brother or something\r\nand be done with it."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my dear; Mr. Hosmer and I have merely been interchanging a\r\nfew disjointed ideas."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound they were disjointed. I guess Fanny wants you, Mr.\r\nHosmer. If you listen to Mr. Worthington he\'ll keep you here till\r\ndaylight with his ideas."\r\n\r\nHosmer followed Mrs. Worthington down-stairs and into Mrs. Dawson\'s.\r\nAs he entered the parlor he heard Fanny laughing gaily, and saw that\r\nshe stood near the sideboard in the dining-room, just clicking her\r\nglass of punch to Jack Dawson\'s, who was making a gay speech on the\r\noccasion of her new marriage.\r\n\r\nThey did not leave when they had intended. Need the misery of that one\r\nday be told?\r\n\r\nBut on the evening of the following day, Fanny peered with pale,\r\nhaggard face from the closed window of the Pullman car as it moved\r\nslowly out of Union dep\xf4t, to see Lou and Jack Dawson smiling and\r\nwaving good-bye, Belle wiping her eyes and Mr. Worthington looking\r\nblankly along the line of windows, unable to see them without his\r\nspectacles, which he had left between the pages of his Schopenhauer on\r\nthe kitchen table at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFanny\'s First Night at Place-du-Bois.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey South had not been without attractions for Fanny. She had\r\nthat consciousness so pleasing to the feminine mind of being well\r\ndressed; for her husband had been exceedingly liberal in furnishing\r\nher the means to satisfy her fancy in that regard. Moreover the change\r\nholding out a promise of novelty, irritated her to a feeble\r\nexpectancy. The air, that came to her in puffs through the car window,\r\nwas deliciously soft and mild; steeped with the rich languor of the\r\nIndian summer, that had already touched the tree tops, the sloping\r\nhill-side, and the very air, with russet and gold.\r\n\r\nHosmer sat beside her, curiously inattentive to his newspaper;\r\nobservant of her small needs, and anticipating her timid half\r\nexpressed wishes. Was there some mysterious power that had so soon\r\ntaught the man such methods to a woman\'s heart, or was he not rather\r\non guard and schooling himself for the r\xf4le which was to be acted out\r\nto the end? But as the day was approaching its close, Fanny became\r\ntired and languid; a certain mistrust was creeping into her heart with\r\nthe nearing darkness. It had grown sultry and close, and the view from\r\nthe car window was no longer cheerful, as they whirled through\r\nforests, gloomy with trailing moss, or sped over an unfamiliar country\r\nwhose features were strange and held no promise of a welcome for her.\r\n\r\nThey were nearing Place-du-Bois, and Hosmer\'s spirits had risen almost\r\nto the point of gaiety as he began to recognize the faces of those who\r\nloitered about the stations at which they stopped. At the Centerville\r\nstation, five miles before reaching their own, he had even gone out on\r\nthe platform to shake hands with the rather mystified agent who had\r\nnot known of his absence. And he had waved a salute to the little\r\nFrench priest of Centerville who stood out in the open beside his\r\nhorse, booted, spurred and all equipped for bad weather, waiting for\r\ncertain consignments which were to come with the train, and who\r\nanswered Hosmer\'s greeting with a sober and uncompromising sweep of\r\nthe hand. When the whistle sounded for Place-du-Bois, it was nearly\r\ndark. Hosmer hurried Fanny on to the platform, where stood Henry, his\r\nclerk. There were a great many negroes loitering about, some of whom\r\noffered him a cordial "how\'dy Mr. Hosma," and pushing through was\r\nGr\xe9goire, meeting them with the ease of a courtier, and acknowledging\r\nHosmer\'s introduction of his wife, with a friendly hand shake.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se sent the buggy down fur you," he said, "we had rain this\r\nmornin\' and the road\'s putty heavy. Come this way. Mine out fur that\r\nba\'el, Mrs. Hosma, it\'s got molasses in. Hiurm bring that buggy ova\r\nyere."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the news, Gr\xe9goire?" asked Hosmer, as they waited for Hiram to\r\nturn the horses about.\r\n\r\n"Jus\' about the same\'s ev\'a. Miss Melicent wasn\'t ver\' well a few days\r\nback; but she\'s some betta. I reckon you\'re all plum wore out," he\r\nadded, taking in Fanny\'s listless attitude, and thinking her very\r\npretty as far as he could discover in the dim light.\r\n\r\nThey drove directly to the cottage, and on the porch Th\xe9r\xe8se was\r\nwaiting for them. She took Fanny\'s two hands and pressed them warmly\r\nbetween her own; then led her into the house with an arm passed about\r\nher waist. She shook hands with Hosmer, and stood for a while in\r\ncheerful conversation, before leaving them.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was fully equipped for their reception, with Minervy in\r\npossession of the kitchen and the formerly reluctant Suze as\r\nhousemaid: though Th\xe9r\xe8se had been silent as to the methods which she\r\nhad employed to prevail with these unwilling damsels.\r\n\r\nHosmer then went out to look after their baggage, and when he\r\nreturned, Fanny sat with her head pillowed on the sofa, sobbing\r\nbitterly. He knelt beside her, putting his arm around her, and asked\r\nthe cause of her distress.\r\n\r\n"Oh it\'s so lonesome, and dreadful, I don\'t believe I can stand it,"\r\nshe answered haltingly through her tears.\r\n\r\nAnd here was he thinking it was so home-like and comforting, and\r\ntasting the first joy that he had known since he had gone away.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all strange and new to you, Fanny; try to bear up for a day or\r\ntwo. Come now, don\'t be a baby--take courage. It will all seem quite\r\ndifferent by and by, when the sun shines."\r\n\r\nA knock at the door was followed by the entrance of a young colored\r\nboy carrying an armful of wood.\r\n\r\n"Miss T\'r\xe8se sont me kin\'le fiar fu\' Miss Hosma; \'low he tu\'nin\'\r\ncole," he said depositing his load on the hearth; and Fanny, drying\r\nher eyes, turned to watch him at his work.\r\n\r\nHe went very deliberately about it, tearing off thin slathers from the\r\nfat pine, and arranging them into a light frame-work, beneath a\r\ntopping of kindling and logs that he placed on the massive brass\r\nandirons. He crawled about on hands and knees, picking up the stray\r\nbits of chips and moss that had fallen from his arms when he came in.\r\nThen sitting back on his heels he looked meditatively into the blaze\r\nwhich he had kindled and scratched his nose with a splinter of pine\r\nwood. When Hosmer presently left the room, he rolled his big black\r\neyes towards Fanny, without turning his head, and remarked in a tone\r\nplainly inviting conversation "yo\' all come f\'om way yonda?"\r\n\r\nHe was intensely black, and if Fanny had been a woman with the\r\nslightest sense of humor, she could not but have been amused at the\r\npicture which he presented in the revealing fire-light with his elfish\r\nand ape like body much too small to fill out the tattered and\r\nill-fitting garments that hung about it. But she only wondered at him\r\nand his rags, and at his motive for addressing her.\r\n\r\n"We\'re come from St. Louis," she replied, taking him with a\r\nseriousness which in no wise daunted him.\r\n\r\n"Yo\' all brung de rain," he went on sociably, leaving off the\r\nscratching of his nose, to pass his black yellow-palmed hand slowly\r\nthrough the now raging fire, a feat which filled her with\r\nconsternation. After prevailing upon him to desist from this\r\nsalamander like exhibition, she was moved to ask if he were not very\r\npoor to be thus shabbily clad.\r\n\r\n"No \'um," he laughed, "I got some sto\' close yonda home. Dis yere coat\r\nw\'at Mista Gr\xe9gor gi\'me," looking critically down at its length, which\r\nswept the floor as he remained on his knees. "He done all to\'e tu\r\npieces time he gi\' him tu me, whar he scuffle wid Jo\xe7int yonda tu de\r\nmill. Mammy \'low she gwine mek him de same like new w\'en she kin kotch\r\nde time."\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Minervy bearing a tray temptingly arranged with a\r\ndainty supper, served to silence the boy, who at seeing her, threw\r\nhimself upon all fours and appeared to be busy with the fire. The\r\nwoman, a big raw-boned field hand, set her burden awkwardly down on a\r\ntable, and after staring comprehensively around, addressed the boy in\r\na low rich voice, "Dar ain\'t no mo\' call to bodda wid dat fiar, you\r\nSampson; how come Miss T\'r\xe8se sont you lazy piece in yere tu buil\'\r\nfiar?"\r\n\r\n"Don\' know how come," he replied, vanishing with an air of the utmost\r\nself-depreciation.\r\n\r\nHosmer and Fanny took tea together before the cheerful fire and he\r\ntold her something of methods on the plantation, and made her further\r\nacquainted with the various people whom she had thus far encountered.\r\nShe listened apathetically; taking little interest in what he said,\r\nand asking few questions. She did express a little bewilderment at the\r\nservant problem. Mrs. Lafirme, during their short conversation, had\r\ndeplored her inability to procure more than two servants for her; and\r\nFanny could not understand why it should require so many to do the\r\nwork which at home was accomplished by one. But she was tired--very\r\ntired, and early sought her bed, and Hosmer went in quest of his\r\nsister whom he had not yet seen.\r\n\r\nMelicent had been told of his marriage some days previously, and had\r\nbeen thrown into such a state of nerves by the intelligence, as to\r\nseriously alarm those who surrounded her and whose experience with\r\nhysterical girls had been inadequate.\r\n\r\nPoor Gr\xe9goire had betaken himself with the speed of the wind to the\r\nstore to procure bromide, valerian, and whatever else should be\r\nthought available in prevailing with a malady of this distressing\r\nnature. But she was "some betta," as he told Hosmer, who found her\r\nwalking in the darkness of one of the long verandas, all enveloped in\r\nfilmy white wool. He was a little prepared for a cool reception from\r\nher, and ten minutes before she might have received him with a studied\r\nindifference. But her mood had veered about and touched the point\r\nwhich moved her to fall upon his neck, and in a manner, condole with\r\nhim; seasoning her sympathy with a few tears.\r\n\r\n"Whatever possessed you, David? I have been thinking, and thinking,\r\nand I can see no reason which should have driven you to do this thing.\r\nOf course I can\'t meet her; you surely don\'t expect it?"\r\n\r\nHe took her arm and joined her in her slow walk.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do expect it, Melicent, and if you have the least regard for\r\nme, I expect more. I want you to be good to her, and patient, and show\r\nyourself her friend. No one can do such things more amiably than you,\r\nwhen you try."\r\n\r\n"But David, I had hoped for something so different."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t have expected me to marry Mrs. Lafirme, a Catholic," he\r\nsaid, making no pretense of misunderstanding her.\r\n\r\n"I think that woman would have given up religion--anything for you."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t know her, little sister."\r\n\r\nIt must have been far in the night when Fanny awoke suddenly. She\r\ncould not have told whether she had been awakened by the long, wailing\r\ncry of a traveler across the narrow river, vainly trying to rouse the\r\nferryman; or the creaking of a heavy wagon that labored slowly by in\r\nthe road and moved Hector to noisy enquiry. Was it not rather the\r\npattering rain that the wind was driving against the window panes? The\r\nlamp burned dimly upon the high old-fashioned mantel-piece and her\r\nhusband had thoughtfully placed an improvised screen before it, to\r\nprotect her against its disturbance. He himself was not beside her,\r\nnor was he in the room. She slid from her bed and moved softly on her\r\nbare feet over to the open sitting-room door.\r\n\r\nThe fire had all burned away. Only the embers lay in a glowing heap,\r\nand while she looked, the last stick that lay across the andirons,\r\nbroke through its tapering center and fell amongst them, stirring a\r\nfitful light by which she discovered her husband seated and bowed like\r\na man who has been stricken. Uncomprehending, she stood a moment\r\nspeechless, then crept back noiselessly to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n"Neva to See You!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se judged it best to leave Fanny a good deal to herself during\r\nher first days on the plantation, without relinquishing a certain\r\nwatchful supervision of her comfort, and looking in on her for a few\r\nmoments each day. The rain which had come with them continued fitfully\r\nand Fanny remained in doors, clad in a warm handsome gown, her small\r\nslippered feet cushioned before the fire, and reading the latest novel\r\nof one of those prolific female writers who turn out their unwholesome\r\nintellectual sweets so tirelessly, to be devoured by the girls and\r\nwomen of the age.\r\n\r\nMelicent, who always did the unexpected, crossed over early on the\r\nmorning after Fanny\'s arrival; penetrated to her sleeping room and\r\nembraced her effusively, even as she lay in bed, calling her "poor\r\ndear Fanny" and cautioning her against getting up on such a morning.\r\n\r\nThe tears which had come to Fanny on arriving, and which had dried on\r\nher cheek when she turned to gaze into the cheer of the great wood\r\nfire, did not return. Everybody seemed to be making much of her, which\r\nwas a new experience in her life; she having always felt herself as of\r\nlittle consequence, and in a manner, overlooked. The negroes were\r\noverawed at the splendor of her toilettes and showed a respect for her\r\nin proportion to the money value which these toilettes reflected. Each\r\nmorning Gr\xe9goire left at her door his compliments with a huge bouquet\r\nof brilliant and many colored crysanthemums, and enquiry if he could\r\nserve her in any way. And Hosmer\'s time, that was not given to work,\r\nwas passed at her side; not in brooding or pre-occupied silence, but\r\nin talk that invited her to friendly response.\r\n\r\nWith Th\xe9r\xe8se, she was at first shy and diffident, and over watchful of\r\nherself. She did not forget that Hosmer had told her "The lady knows\r\nwhy I have come" and she resented that knowledge which Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\npossessed of her past intimate married life.\r\n\r\nMelicent\'s attentions did not last in their ultra-effusiveness, but\r\nshe found Fanny less objectionable since removed from her St. Louis\r\nsurroundings; and the evident consideration with which she had been\r\naccepted at Place-du-Bois seemed to throw about her a halo of\r\nsufficient distinction to impel the girl to view her from a new and\r\ndifferent stand-point.\r\n\r\nBut the charm of plantation life was letting go its hold upon\r\nMelicent. Gr\xe9goire\'s adoration alone, and her feeble response to it\r\nwere all that kept her.\r\n\r\n"I neva felt anything like this befo\'," he said, as they stood\r\ntogether and their hands touched in reaching for a splendid rose that\r\nhung invitingly from its tall latticed support out in mid lawn. The\r\nsun had come again and dried the last drop of lingering moisture on\r\ngrass and shrubbery.\r\n\r\n"W\'en I\'m away f\'om you, even fur five minutes, \'t seems like I mus\'\r\nhurry quick, quick, to git back again; an\' w\'en I\'m with you,\r\neverything \'pears all right, even if you don\'t talk to me or look at\r\nme. Th\' otha day, down at the gin," he continued, "I was figurin\' on\r\nsome weights an\' wasn\'t thinkin\' about you at all, an\' all at once I\r\nremember\'d the one time I\'d kissed you. Goodness! I couldn\'t see the\r\nfigures any mo\', my head swum and the pencil mos\' fell out o\' my han\'.\r\nI neva felt anything like it: hones\', Miss Melicent, I thought I was\r\ngoin\' to faint fur a minute."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very unwise, Gr\xe9goire," she said, taking the roses that he\r\nhanded her to add to the already large bunch. "You must learn to think\r\nof me calmly: our love must be something like a sacred memory--a sweet\r\nrecollection to help us through life when we are apart."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I\'m goin\' to stan\' it. Neva to see you! neva--my\r\nGod!" he gasped, paling and crushing between his nervous fingers the\r\nflower she would have taken from him.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing in this world that one cannot grow accustomed to,\r\ndear," spoke the pretty philosopher, picking up her skirts daintily\r\nwith one hand and passing the other through his arm--the hand which\r\nheld the flowers, whose peculiar perfume ever afterwards made Gr\xe9goire\r\nshiver through a moment of pain that touched very close upon rapture.\r\n\r\nHe was more occupied than he liked during those busy days of\r\nharvesting and ginning, that left him only brief and snatched\r\nintervals of Melicent\'s society. If he could have rested in the\r\ncomfort of being sure of her, such moments of separation would have\r\nhad their compensation in reflective anticipation. But with his\r\nundisciplined desires and hot-blooded eagerness, her half-hearted\r\nacknowledgments and inadequate concessions, closed her about with a\r\nchilling barrier that staggered him with its problematic nature.\r\nFeeling himself her equal in the aristocracy of blood, and her master\r\nin the knowledge and strength of loving, he resented those half\r\nunderstood reasons which removed him from the possibility of being\r\nanything to her. And more, he was angry with himself for acquiescing\r\nin that self understood agreement. But it was only in her absence that\r\nthese thoughts disturbed him. When he was with her, his whole being\r\nrejoiced in her existence and there was no room for doubt or dread.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself regenerated through love, and as having no part in\r\nthat other Gr\xe9goire whom he only thought of to dismiss with\r\nunrecognition.\r\n\r\nThe time came when he could ill conceal his passion from others.\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se became conscious of it, through an unguarded glance. The\r\nunhappiness of the situation was plain to her; but to what degree she\r\ncould not guess. It was certainly so deplorable that it would have\r\nbeen worth while to have averted it. Yet, she felt great faith in the\r\npower of time and absence to heal such wounds even to the extent of\r\nleaving no tell-tale scar.\r\n\r\n"Gr\xe9goire, my boy," she said to him, speaking in French, and laying\r\nher hand on his, when they were alone together. "I hope that your\r\nheart is not too deep in this folly."\r\n\r\nHe reddened and asked, "What do you mean, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, that unfortunately, you are in love with Melicent. I do not\r\nknow how much longer she will remain here, but taking any possibility\r\nfor granted, let me advise you to leave the place for a while; go back\r\nto your home, or take a little trip to the city."\r\n\r\n"No, I could not."\r\n\r\n"Force yourself to it."\r\n\r\n"And lose days, perhaps weeks, of being near her? No, no, I could not\r\ndo that, aunt. There will be plenty time for that in the rest of my\r\nlife," he said, trying to speak calmly and forcing his voice to a\r\nharshness which the nearness of tears made needful.\r\n\r\n"Does she know? Have you told her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she knows how much I love her."\r\n\r\n"And she does not love you," said Th\xe9r\xe8se, seeming rather to assert\r\nthan to question.\r\n\r\n"No, she does not. No matter what she says--she does not. I can feel\r\nthat here," he answered, striking his breast. "Oh aunt, it is terrible\r\nto think of her going away; forever, perhaps; of never seeing her. I\r\ncould not stand it." And he stood the strain no longer, but sobbed and\r\nwept with his aunt\'s consoling arms around him.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se, knowing that Melicent would not tarry much longer with them,\r\nthought it not needful to approach her on the subject. Had it been\r\notherwise, she would not have hesitated to beg the girl to desist from\r\nthis unprofitable amusement of tormenting a human heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA Talk Under the Cedar Tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay by day, Fanny threw off somewhat of the homesickness which had\r\nweighted her at coming. Not by any determined effort of the will, nor\r\nby any resolve to make the best of things. Outside influences meeting\r\nhalf-way the workings of unconscious inward forces, were the agents\r\nthat by degrees were gently ridding her of the acute pressure of\r\ndissatisfaction, which up to the present, she had stolidly borne\r\nwithout any personal effort to cast it off.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se affected her forcibly. This woman so wholesome, so fair and\r\nstrong; so un-American as to be not ashamed to show tenderness and\r\nsympathy with eye and lip, moved Fanny like a new and pleasing\r\nexperience. When Th\xe9r\xe8se touched her caressingly, or gently stroked\r\nher limp hand, she started guiltily, and looked furtively around to\r\nmake sure that none had witnessed an exhibition of tenderness that\r\nmade her flush, and the first time found her unresponsive. A second\r\ntime, she awkwardly returned the hand pressure, and later, these\r\nmildly sensuous exchanges prefaced the outpouring of all Fanny\'s woes,\r\ngreat and small.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that I always done what was right, Mrs. Laferm, but I\r\nguess David\'s told you just what suited him about me. You got to\r\nremember there\'s always two sides to a story."\r\n\r\nShe had been to the poultry yard with Th\xe9r\xe8se, who had introduced her\r\nto its feathery tenants, making her acquainted with stately Brahmas\r\nand sleek Plymouth-Rocks and hardy little "Creole chickens"--not much\r\nto look at, but very palatable when converted into _fricass\xe9e_.\r\n\r\nReturning, they seated themselves on the bench that encircled a\r\nmassive cedar--spreading and conical. Hector, who had trotted\r\nattendance upon them during their visit of inspection, cast himself\r\nheavily down at his mistress\' feet and after glancing knowingly up\r\ninto her face, looked placidly forth at Sampson, gathering garden\r\ngreens on the other side of a low dividing fence.\r\n\r\n"You see if David\'d always been like he is now, I don\'t know but\r\nthings\'d been different. Do you suppose he ever went any wheres with\r\nme, or even so much as talked to me when he came home? There was\r\nalways that everlasting newspaper in his pocket, and he\'d haul it out\r\nthe first thing. Then I used to read the paper too sometimes, and when\r\nI\'d go to talk to him about what I read, he\'d never even looked at the\r\nsame things. Goodness knows what he read in the paper, I never could\r\nfind out; but here\'d be the edges all covered over with figuring. I\r\nbelieve it\'s the only thing he ever thought or dreamt about; that\r\neternal figuring on every bit of paper he could lay hold of, till I\r\nwas tired picking them up all over the house. Belle Worthington used\r\nto say it\'d of took an angel to stand him. I mean his throwing papers\r\naround that way. For as far as his never talking went, she couldn\'t\r\nfind any fault with that; Mr. Worthington was just as bad, if he\r\nwasn\'t worse. But Belle\'s not like me; I don\'t believe she\'d let poor\r\nMr. Worthington talk in the house if he wanted to."\r\n\r\nShe gradually drifted away from her starting point, and like most\r\npeople who have usually little to say, became very voluble, when once\r\nshe passed into the humor of talking. Th\xe9r\xe8se let her talk unchecked.\r\nIt seemed to do her good to chatter about Belle and Lou, and Jack\r\nDawson, and about her home life, of which she unknowingly made such a\r\npitiable picture to her listener.\r\n\r\n"I guess David never let on to you about himself," she said moodily,\r\nhaving come back to the sore that rankled: the dread that Th\xe9r\xe8se had\r\nlaid all the blame of the rupture on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You\'re mistaken, Mrs. Hosmer. It was a knowledge of his own\r\nshort-comings that prompted your husband to go back and ask your\r\nforgiveness. You must grant, there\'s nothing in his conduct now that\r\nyou could reproach him with. And," she added, laying her hand gently\r\non Fanny\'s arm, "I know you\'ll be strong, and do your share in this\r\nreconciliation--do what you can to please him."\r\n\r\nFanny flushed uneasily under Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s appealing glance.\r\n\r\n"I\'m willing to do anything that David wants," she replied, "I made up\r\nmy mind to that from the start. He\'s a mighty good husband now, Mrs.\r\nLaferm. Don\'t mind what I said about him. I was afraid you thought\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," returned Th\xe9r\xe8se kindly, "I know all about it. Don\'t\r\nworry any farther over what I may think. I believe in you and in him,\r\nand I know you\'ll both be brave and do what\'s right."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anything so very hard for David to do," she said,\r\ndepressed with a sense of her inadequate strength to do the task which\r\nshe had set herself. "He\'s got no faults to give up. David never did\r\nhave any faults. He\'s a true, honest man; and I was a coward to say\r\nthose things about him."\r\n\r\nMelicent and Gr\xe9goire were coming across the lawn to join the two, and\r\nFanny, seeing them approach, suddenly chilled and wrapt herself about\r\nin her mantle of reserve.\r\n\r\n"I guess I better go," she said, offering to rise, but Th\xe9r\xe8se held\r\nout a detaining hand.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to go and sit alone in the cottage; stay here with me\r\ntill Mr. Hosmer comes back from the mill."\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire\'s face was a study. Melicent, who did what she wanted with\r\nhim, had chosen this afternoon, for some inscrutable reason, to make\r\nhim happy. He carried her shawl and parasol; she herself bearing a\r\nveritable armful of flowers, leaves, red berried sprigs, a tangle of\r\nrichest color. They had been in the woods and she had bedecked him\r\nwith garlands and festoons of autumn leaves, till he looked a very\r\nSatyr; a character which his flushed, swarthy cheeks, and glittering\r\nanimal eyes did not belie.\r\n\r\nThey were laughing immoderately, and their whole bearing still\r\nreflected their exuberant gaiety as they joined Th\xe9r\xe8se and Fanny.\r\n\r\n"What a \'Mater Dolorosa\' Fanny looks!" exclaimed Melicent, throwing\r\nherself into a picturesque attitude on the bench beside Th\xe9r\xe8se, and\r\nresting her feet on Hector\'s broad back.\r\n\r\nFanny offered no reply, but to look helplessly resigned; an expression\r\nwhich Melicent knew of old, and which had always the effect of\r\nirritating her. Not now, however, for the curve of the bench around\r\nthe great cedar tree removed her from the possibility of contemplating\r\nFanny\'s doleful visage, unless she made an effort to that end, which\r\nshe was certainly not inclined to do.\r\n\r\n"No, Gr\xe9goire," she said, flinging a rose into his face when he would\r\nhave seated himself beside her, "go sit by Fanny and do something to\r\nmake her laugh; only don\'t tickle her; David mightn\'t like it. And\r\nhere\'s Mrs. Lafirme looking almost as glum. Now, if David would only\r\njoin us with that \'pale cast of thought\' that he bears about usually,\r\nwhat a merry go round we\'d have."\r\n\r\n"When Melicent looks at the world laughing, she wants it to laugh back\r\nat her," said Th\xe9r\xe8se, reflecting something of the girl\'s gaiety.\r\n\r\n"As in a looking-glass, well isn\'t that square?" she returned, falling\r\ninto slang, in her recklessness of spirit.\r\n\r\nEndeavoring to guard her treasure of flowers from Th\xe9r\xe8se, who was\r\nwithout ceremony making a critical selection among them of what\r\npleased her, Melicent slid around the bench, bringing herself close to\r\nGr\xe9goire and begging his protection against the Vandalism of his aunt.\r\nShe looked into his eyes for an instant as though asking him for love\r\ninstead of so slight a favor and he grasped her arm, pressing it till\r\nshe cried out from the pain: which act, on his side, served to drive\r\nher again around to Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Guess what we are going to do to-morrow: you and I and all of us;\r\nGr\xe9goire and David and Fanny and everybody?"\r\n\r\n"Going to Bedlam along with you?" Th\xe9r\xe8se asked.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lafirme is in need of a rebuke, which I shall proceed to\r\nadminister," thrusting a crumpled handful of rose leaves down the neck\r\nof Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s dress, and laughing joyously in her scuffle to accomplish\r\nthe punishment.\r\n\r\n"No, madam; I don\'t go to Bedlam; I drive others there. Ask Gr\xe9goire\r\nwhat we\'re going to do. Tell them, Gr\xe9goire."\r\n\r\n"They ain\'t much to tell. We\'a goin\' hoss back ridin\'."\r\n\r\n"Not me; I can\'t ride," wailed Fanny.\r\n\r\n"You can get up Torpedo for Mrs. Hosmer, can\'t you, Gr\xe9goire?" asked\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. W\'y you could ride ole Torpedo, Mrs. Hosma, if you nova\r\nsaw a hoss in yo\' life. A li\'l chile could manage him."\r\n\r\nFanny turned to Th\xe9r\xe8se for further assurance and found all that she\r\nlooked for.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go up on the hill and see that dear old Morico, and I shall\r\ntake along a comb, and comb out that exquisite white hair of his and\r\nthen I shall focus him, seated in his low chair and making one of\r\nthose cute turkey fans."\r\n\r\n"Ole Morico ain\'t goin\' to let you try no monkeyshines on him; I tell\r\nyou that befo\' han\'," said Gr\xe9goire, rising and coming to Melicent to\r\nrid him of his sylvan ornamentations, for it was time for him to leave\r\nthem. When he turned away, Melicent rose and flung all her flowery\r\nwealth into Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s lap, and following took his arm.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" asked Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Going to help Gr\xe9goire feed the mules," she called back looking over\r\nher shoulder; the sinking sun lighting her handsome mischievous face.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se proceeded to arrange the flowers with some regard to graceful\r\nsymmetry; and Fanny did not regain her talkative spirit that\r\nMelicent\'s coming had put to flight, but sat looking silent and\r\nlistlessly into the distance.\r\n\r\nAs Th\xe9r\xe8se glanced casually up into her face she saw it warmed by a\r\nsudden faint glow--an unusual animation, and following her gaze, she\r\nsaw that Hosmer had returned and was entering the cottage.\r\n\r\n"I guess I better be going," said Fanny rising, and this time Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nno longer detained her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se Crosses the River.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo shirk any serious duties of life would have been entirely foreign\r\nto Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s methods or even instincts. But there did come to her\r\nmoments of rebellion--or repulsion, against the small demands that\r\npresented themselves with an unfailing recurrence; and from such, she\r\nat times indulged herself with the privilege of running away. When\r\nFanny left her alone--a pathetic little droop took possession of the\r\ncorners of her mouth that might not have come there if she had not\r\nbeen alone. She laid the flowers, only half arranged, on the bench\r\nbeside her, as a child would put aside a toy that no longer interested\r\nit. She looked towards the house and could see the servants going back\r\nand forth. She knew if she entered, she would be met by appeals from\r\none and the other. The overseer would soon be along, with his crib\r\nkeys, and stable keys; his account of the day\'s doings and\r\nconsultations for to-morrow\'s work, and for the moment, she would have\r\nnone of it.\r\n\r\n"Come, Hector--come, old boy," she said rising abruptly; and crossing\r\nthe lawn she soon gained the gravel path that led to the outer road.\r\nThis road brought her by a mild descent to the river bank. The water,\r\nseldom stationary for any long period, was at present running low and\r\nsluggishly between its red banks.\r\n\r\nTied to the landing was a huge flat-boat, that was managed by the aid\r\nof a stout cable reaching quite across the river; and beside it\r\nnestled a small light skiff. In this Th\xe9r\xe8se seated herself, and\r\nproceeded to row across the stream, Hector plunging into the water and\r\nswimming in advance of her.\r\n\r\nThe banks on the opposite shore were almost perpendicular; and their\r\nsummit to be reached only by the artificial road that had been cut\r\ninto them: broad and of easy ascent. This river front was a standing\r\nworry to Th\xe9r\xe8se, for when the water was high and rapid, the banks\r\ncaved constantly, carrying away great sections from the land. Almost\r\nevery year, the fences in places had to be moved back, not only for\r\nsecurity, but to allow a margin for the road that on this side\r\nfollowed the course of the small river.\r\n\r\nHigh up and perilously near the edge, stood a small cabin. It had once\r\nbeen far removed from the river, which had now, however, eaten its way\r\nclose up to it--leaving no space for the road-way. The house was\r\nsomewhat more pretentious than others of its class, being fashioned of\r\nplaned painted boards, and having a brick chimney that stood fully\r\nexposed at one end. A great rose tree climbed and spread generously\r\nover one side, and the big red roses grew by hundreds amid the dark\r\ngreen setting of their leaves.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of this cabin Th\xe9r\xe8se stopped, calling out, "_Grosse\r\ntante!--oh, Grosse tante!_"\r\n\r\nThe sound of her voice brought to the door a negress--coal black and\r\nso enormously fat that she moved about with evident difficulty. She\r\nwas dressed in a loosely hanging purple calico garment of the mother\r\nHubbard type--known as a _volante_ amongst Louisiana Creoles; and on\r\nher head was knotted and fantastically twisted a bright _tignon_. Her\r\nglistening good-natured countenance illumined at the sight of Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"_Quo faire to pas woulez rentrer, Tite ma\xeetresse?_" and Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nanswered in the same Creole dialect: "Not now, _Grosse tante_--I shall\r\nbe back in half an hour to drink a cup of coffee with you." No English\r\nwords can convey the soft music of that speech, seemingly made for\r\ntenderness and endearment.\r\n\r\nAs Th\xe9r\xe8se turned away from the gate, the black woman re-entered the\r\nhouse, and as briskly as her cumbersome size would permit, began\r\npreparations for her mistress\' visit. Milk and butter were taken from\r\nthe safe; eggs, from the India rush basket that hung against the wall;\r\nand flour, from the half barrel that stood in convenient readiness in\r\nthe corner: for _Tite ma\xeetresse_ was to be treated to a dish of\r\n_croquignoles_. Coffee was always an accomplished fact at hand in the\r\nchimney corner.\r\n\r\n_Grosse tante_, or more properly, Marie Louise, was a Creole--Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s\r\nnurse and attendant from infancy, and the only one of the family\r\nservants who had come with her mistress from New Orleans to\r\nPlace-du-Bois at that lady\'s marriage with J\xe9r\xf4me Lafirme. But her\r\never increasing weight had long since removed her from the possibility\r\nof usefulness, otherwise than in supervising her small farm yard. She\r\nhad little use for "_ces n\xe9ges Am\xe9ricains_," as she called the\r\nplantation hands--a restless lot forever shifting about and changing\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIt was seldom now that she crossed the river; only two occasions being\r\nconsidered of sufficient importance to induce her to such effort. One\r\nwas in the event of her mistress\' illness, when she would install\r\nherself at her bedside as a fixture, not to be dislodged by any less\r\ninducement than Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s full recovery. The other was when a dinner\r\nof importance was to be given: then Marie Louise consented to act as\r\n_chef de cuisine_, for there was no more famous cook than she in the\r\nState; her instructor having been no less a personage than old Lucien\r\nSantien--a _gourmet_ famed for his ultra Parisian tastes.\r\n\r\nSeated at the base of a great China-berry on whose gnarled protruding\r\nroots she rested an arm languidly, Th\xe9r\xe8se looked out over the river\r\nand gave herself up to doubts and misgivings. She first took exception\r\nwith herself for that constant interference in the concerns of other\r\npeople. Might not this propensity be carried too far at times? Did the\r\ngood accruing counterbalance the personal discomfort into which she\r\nwas often driven by her own agency? What reason had she to know that a\r\npolicy of non-interference in the affairs of others might not after\r\nall be the judicious one? As much as she tried to vaguely generalize,\r\nshe found her reasoning applying itself to her relation with Hosmer.\r\n\r\nThe look which she had surprised in Fanny\'s face had been a painful\r\nrevelation to her. Yet could she have expected other, and should she\r\nhave hoped for less, than that Fanny should love her husband and he in\r\nturn should come to love his wife?\r\n\r\nHad she married Hosmer herself! Here she smiled to think of the storm\r\nof indignation that such a marriage would have roused in the parish.\r\nYet, even facing the impossibility of such contingency, it pleased her\r\nto indulge in a short dream of what might have been.\r\n\r\nIf it were her right instead of another\'s to watch for his coming and\r\nrejoice at it! Hers to call him husband and lavish on him the love\r\nthat awoke so strongly when she permitted herself, as she was doing\r\nnow, to invoke it! She felt what capability lay within her of rousing\r\nthe man to new interests in life. She pictured the dawn of an\r\nunsuspected happiness coming to him: broadening; illuminating; growing\r\nin him to answer to her own big-heartedness.\r\n\r\nWere Fanny, and her own prejudices, worth the sacrifice which she and\r\nHosmer had made? This was the doubt that bade fair to unsettle her;\r\nthat called for a sharp, strong out-putting of the will before she\r\ncould bring herself to face the situation without its accessions of\r\npersonalities. Such communing with herself could not be condemned as a\r\nweakness with Th\xe9r\xe8se, for the effect which it left upon her strong\r\nnature was one of added courage and determination.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached Marie Louise\'s cabin again, twilight, which is so\r\nbrief in the South, was giving place to the night.\r\n\r\nWithin the cabin, the lamp had already been lighted, and Marie Louise\r\nwas growing restless at Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s long delay.\r\n\r\n"Ah _Grosse tante_, I\'m so tired," she said, falling into a chair near\r\nthe door; not relishing the warmth of the room after her quick walk,\r\nand wishing to delay as long as possible the necessity of sitting at\r\ntable. At another time she might have found the dish of golden brown\r\n_croquignoles_ very tempting with its accessory of fragrant coffee;\r\nbut not to-day.\r\n\r\n"Why do you run about so much, _Tite ma\xeetresse_? You are always going\r\nthis way and that way; on horseback, on foot--through the house. Make\r\nthose lazy niggers work more. You spoil them. I tell you if it was old\r\nmistress that had to deal with them, they would see something\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\nShe had taken all the pins from Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s hair which fell in a\r\ngleaming, heavy mass; and with her big soft hands she was stroking her\r\nhead as gently as if those hands had been of the whitest and most\r\ndelicate.\r\n\r\n"I know that look in your eyes, it means headache. It\'s time for me to\r\nmake you some more _eau s\xe9dative_--I am sure you haven\'t any more;\r\nyou\'ve given it away as you give away every thing."\r\n\r\n"_Grosse tante_," said Th\xe9r\xe8se seated at table and sipping her coffee;\r\n_Grosse tante_ also drinking her cup--but seated apart, "I am going to\r\ninsist on having your cabin moved back; it is silly to be so stubborn\r\nabout such a small matter. Some day you will find yourself out in the\r\nmiddle of the river--and what am I going to do then?--no one to nurse\r\nme when I am sick--no one to scold me--nobody to love me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, _Tite ma\xeetresse_, all the world loves you--it isn\'t\r\nonly Marie Louise. But no. You must remember the last time poor\r\nMonsieur J\xe9r\xf4me moved me, and said with a laugh that I can never\r\nforget, \'well, _Grosse tante_, I know we have got you far enough this\r\ntime out of danger,\' away back in Dumont\'s field you recollect? I said\r\nthen, Marie Louise will move no more; she\'s too old. If the good God\r\ndoes not want to take care of me, then it\'s time for me to go."\r\n\r\n"Ah but, _Grosse tante_, remember--God does not want all the trouble\r\non his own shoulders," Th\xe9r\xe8se answered humoring the woman, in her\r\nconception of the Deity. "He wants us to do our share, too."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have done my share. Nothing is going to harm Marie Louise. I\r\nthought about all that, do not fret. So the last time P\xe8re Antoine\r\npassed in the road--going down to see that poor Pierre Pardou at the\r\nMouth--I called him in, and he blessed the whole house inside and out,\r\nwith holy water--notice how the roses have bloomed since then--and\r\ngave me medals of the holy Virgin to hang about. Look over the door,\r\n_Tite ma\xeetresse_, how it shines, like a silver star."\r\n\r\n"If you will not have your cabin removed, _Grosse tante_, then come\r\nlive with me. Old Hatton has wanted work at Place-du-Bois, the longest\r\ntime. We will have him build you a room wherever you choose, a pretty\r\nlittle house like those in the city."\r\n\r\n"_Non--non, Tite ma\xeetresse, Marie Louise \'pr\xe8 cr\xe9ver icite av\xe9 tous\r\nson butin, si faut_" (no, no, _Tite ma\xeetresse_, Marie Louise will die\r\nhere with all her belongings if it must be).\r\n\r\nThe servants were instructed that when their mistress was not at home\r\nat a given hour, her absence should cause no delay in the household\r\narrangements. She did not choose that her humor or her movements be\r\nhampered by a necessity of regularity which she owed to no one. When\r\nshe reached home supper had long been over.\r\n\r\nNearing the house she heard the scraping of Nathan\'s violin, the noise\r\nof shuffling feet and unconstrained laughter. These festive sounds\r\ncame from the back veranda. She entered the dining-room, and from its\r\nobscurity looked out on a curious scene. The veranda was lighted by a\r\nlamp suspended from one of its pillars. In a corner sat Nathan;\r\nserious, dignified, scraping out a monotonous but rhythmic minor\r\nstrain to which two young negroes from the lower quarters--famous\r\ndancers--were keeping time in marvelous shuffling and pigeon-wings;\r\ntwisting their supple joints into astonishing contortions and the\r\nsweat rolling from their black visages. A crowd of darkies stood at a\r\nrespectful distance an appreciative and encouraging audience. And\r\nseated on the broad rail of the veranda were Melicent and Gr\xe9goire,\r\npatting Juba and singing a loud accompaniment to the breakdown.\r\n\r\nWas this the Gr\xe9goire who had only yesterday wept such bitter tears on\r\nhis aunt\'s bosom?\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se turning away from the scene, the doubt assailed her whether it\r\nwere after all worth while to strive against the sorrows of life that\r\ncan be so readily put aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOne Afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Torpedo\'s characteristics in days gone by, at\r\nthis advanced period in his history he possessed none so striking as a\r\nstoical inaptitude for being moved. Another of his distinguishing\r\ntraits was a propensity for grazing which he was prone to indulge at\r\ninopportune moments. Such points taken in conjunction with a gait\r\nclosely resembling that of the camel in the desert, might give much\r\ncause to wonder at Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s motive in recommending him as a suitable\r\nmount for the unfortunate Fanny, were it not for his wide-spread\r\nreputation of angelic inoffensiveness.\r\n\r\nThe ride which Melicent had arranged and in which she held out such\r\npromises of a "lark" proved after all but a desultory affair. For with\r\nFanny making but a sorry equestrian debut and Hosmer creeping along at\r\nher side; Th\xe9r\xe8se unable to hold Beauregard within conventional\r\nlimits, and Melicent and Gr\xe9goire vanishing utterly from the scene,\r\nsociability was a feature entirely lacking to the excursion.\r\n\r\n"David, I can\'t go another step: I just can\'t, so that settles it."\r\n\r\nThe look of unhappiness in Fanny\'s face and attitude, would have moved\r\nthe proverbial stone.\r\n\r\n"I think if you change horses with me, Fanny, you\'ll find it more\r\ncomfortable, and we\'ll turn about and go home."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t get on that horse\'s back, David Hosmer, if I had to die\r\nright here in the woods, I wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you could manage to walk back that distance then? I can\r\nlead the horses," he suggested as a _pis aller_.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll haf to; but goodness knows if I\'ll ever get there\r\nalive."\r\n\r\nThey were far up on the hill, which spot they had reached by painfully\r\nslow and labored stages, each refraining from mention of a discomfort\r\nthat might interfere with the supposed enjoyment of the other, till\r\nFanny\'s note of protest.\r\n\r\nHosmer cast about him for some expedient that might lighten the\r\nunpleasantness of the situation, when a happy thought occurred to him.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll try to bear up, a few yards further, you can dismount at\r\nold Morico\'s cabin and I\'ll hurry back and get the buggy. It can be\r\ndriven this far anyway: and it\'s only a short walk from here through\r\nthe woods."\r\n\r\nSo Hosmer set her down before Morico\'s door: her long riding skirt,\r\nborrowed for the occasion, twisting awkwardly around her legs, and\r\nevery joint in her body aching.\r\n\r\nPartly by pantomimic signs interwoven with a few French words which he\r\nhad picked up within the last year, Hosmer succeeded in making himself\r\nunderstood to the old man, and rode away leaving Fanny in his care.\r\n\r\nMorico fussily preceded her into the house and placed a great clumsy\r\nhome-made rocker at her disposal, into which she cast herself with\r\nevery appearance of bodily distress. He then busied himself in tidying\r\nup the room out of deference to his guest; gathering up the scissors,\r\nwaxen thread and turkey feathers which had fallen from his lap in his\r\ndisturbance, and laying them on the table. He knocked the ashes from\r\nhis corn-cob pipe which he now rested on a projection of the brick\r\nchimney that extended into the room and that served as mantel-piece.\r\nAll the while he cast snatched glances at Fanny, who sat pale and\r\ntired. Her appearance seemed to move him to make an effort towards\r\nrelieving it. He took a key from his pocket and unlocking a side of\r\nthe _garde manger_, drew forth a small flask of whisky. Fanny had\r\nclosed her eyes and was not aware of his action, till she heard him at\r\nher elbow saying in his feeble quavering voice:--\r\n\r\n"_Tenez madame; goutez un peu: \xe7a va vous faire du bien,_" and opening\r\nher eyes she saw that he held a glass half filled with strong "toddy"\r\nfor her acceptance.\r\n\r\nShe thrust out her hand to ward it away as though it had been a\r\nreptile that menaced her with its sting.\r\n\r\nMorico looked nonplussed and a little abashed: but he had much faith\r\nin the healing qualities of his remedy and urged it on her anew. She\r\ntrembled a little, and looked away with rather excited eyes.\r\n\r\n"_Je vous assure madame, \xe7a ne peut pas vous faire du mal._"\r\n\r\nFanny took the glass from his hand, and rising went and placed it on\r\nthe table, then walked to the open door and looked eagerly out, as\r\nthough hoping for the impossibility of her husband\'s return.\r\n\r\nShe did not seat herself again, but walked restlessly about the room,\r\nintently examining its meager details. The circuit of inspection\r\nbringing her again to the table, she picked up Morico\'s turkey fan,\r\nlooking at it long and critically. When she laid it down, it was to\r\nseize the glass of "toddy" which she unhesitatingly put to her lips\r\nand drained at a draught. All uneasiness and fatigue seemed to leave\r\nher on the instant as though by magic. She went back to her chair and\r\nreseated herself composedly. Her eyes now rested on her old host with\r\na certain quizzical curiosity strange to them.\r\n\r\nHe was plainly demoralized by her presence, and still made pretense of\r\noccupying himself with the arrangement of the room.\r\n\r\nPresently she said to him: "Your remedy did me more good than I\'d\r\nexpected," but not understanding her, he only smiled and looked at her\r\nblankly.\r\n\r\nShe laughed good-humoredly back at him, then went to the table and\r\npoured from the flask which he had left standing there, liquor to the\r\ndepth of two fingers, this time drinking it more deliberately. After\r\nthat she tried to talk to Morico and thought it very amusing that he\r\ncould not understand her.\r\n\r\nPresently Jo\xe7int came home and accepted her presence there very\r\nindifferently. He went to the _garde manger_ to stay his hunger, much\r\nas he had done on the occasion of Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s visit; talked in grum\r\nabrupt utterances to his father, and disappeared into the adjoining\r\nroom where Fanny could hear him and occasionally see him polishing and\r\noiling his cherished rifle.\r\n\r\nMorico, more accustomed to foreign sounds in the woods than she, was\r\nthe first to detect the approach of Gr\xe9goire, whom he went out\r\nhurriedly to meet, glad of the relief from the supposed necessity of\r\nentertaining his puzzling visitor. When he was fairly out of the room,\r\nshe arose quickly, approached the table and reaching for the flask of\r\nliquor, thrust it hastily into her pocket, then went to join him. At\r\nthe moment that Gr\xe9goire came up, Jo\xe7int issued from a side door and\r\nstood looking at the group.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mrs. Hosma, yere I am. I reckon you was tired waitin\'. The\r\nbuggy\'s yonda in the road."\r\n\r\nHe shook hands cordially with Morico saying something to him in French\r\nwhich made the old man laugh heartily.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t David come? I thought he said he was coming; that\'s the\r\nway he does," said Fanny complainingly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a po\' compliment to me, Mrs. Hosrma. Can\'t you stan\' my\r\ncompany for that li\'le distance?" returned Gr\xe9goire gallantly. "Mr.\r\nHosma had a good deal to do w\'en he got back, that\'s w\'y he sent me.\r\nAn\' we betta hurry up if we expec\' to git any suppa\' to-night. Like as\r\nnot you\'ll fine your kitchen cleaned out."\r\n\r\nFanny looked her inquiry for his meaning.\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t you know this is \'Tous-saint\' eve--w\'en the dead git out\r\no\' their graves an\' walk about? You wouldn\'t ketch a nigga out o\' his\r\ncabin to-night afta dark to save his soul. They all gittin\' ready now\r\nto hustle back to the quartas."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense," said Fanny, drawing on her gloves, "you ought to\r\nhave more sense than to repeat such things."\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire laughed, looking surprised at her unusual energy of speech\r\nand manner. Then he turned to Jo\xe7int, whose presence he had thus far\r\nignored, and asked in a peremptory tone:\r\n\r\n"W\'at did Woodson say \'bout watchin\' at the mill to-night? Did you ask\r\nhim like I tole you?"\r\n\r\n"Yaas, me ax um: ee\' low ee an\' goin\'. Say how Sylveste d\'wan\' watch\r\nlak alluz. Say ee an\' goin\'. Me don\' blem \'im neida, don\' ketch me\r\nout de \'ouse night lak dat fu no man."\r\n\r\n"_Sacr\xe9 imb\xe9cile_," muttered Gr\xe9goire, between his teeth, and\r\nvouchsafed him no other answer, but nodded to Morico and turned away.\r\nFanny followed with a freedom of movement quite unlike that of her\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nMorico went into the house and coming back hastily to the door called\r\nto Jo\xe7int:\r\n\r\n"Bring back that flask of whisky that you took off the table."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a liar: you know I have no use for whisky. That\'s one of your\r\ndamned tricks to make me buy you more." And he seated himself on an\r\nover-turned tub and with his small black eyes half closed, looked\r\nmoodily out into the solemn darkening woods. The old man showed no\r\nresentment at the harshness and disrespect of his son\'s speech, being\r\nevidently used to such. He passed his hand slowly over his white long\r\nhair and turned bewildered into the house.\r\n\r\n"Is it just this same old thing year in and year out, Gr\xe9goire? Don\'t\r\nany one ever get up a dance, or a card party or anything?"\r\n\r\n"Jus\' as you say; the same old thing f\'om one yea\'s en\' to the otha. I\r\nused to think it was putty lonesome myse\'f w\'en I firs\' come yere.\r\nThen you see they\'s no neighbo\'s right roun\' yere. In Natchitoches\r\nnow; that\'s the place to have a right down good time. But see yere; I\r\ndidn\' know you was fon\' o\' dancin\' an\' such things."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, I just dearly love to dance. But it\'s as much as my\r\nlife\'s worth to say that before David; he\'s such a stick; but I guess\r\nyou know that by this time," with a laugh, as he had never heard from\r\nher before--so unconstrained; at the same time drawing nearer to him\r\nand looking merrily into his face.\r\n\r\n"The little lady\'s been having a \'toddy\' at Morico\'s, that makes her\r\nlively," thought Gr\xe9goire. But the knowledge did not abash him in the\r\nleast. He accommodated himself at once to the situation with that\r\nadaptability common to the American youth, whether of the South,\r\nNorth, East or West.\r\n\r\n"Where abouts did you leave David when you come away?" she asked with\r\na studied indifference.\r\n\r\n"Hol\' on there, Buckskin--w\'ere you takin\' us? W\'y, I lef\' him at the\r\nsto\' mailin\' lettas."\r\n\r\n"Had the others all got back? Mrs. Laferm? Melicent? did they all stop\r\nat the store, too?"\r\n\r\n"Who? Aunt Thr\xe9r\xe8se? no, she was up at the house w\'en I lef\'--I reckon\r\nMiss Melicent was there too. Talkin\' \'bout fun,--it\'s to git into one\r\no\' them big spring wagons on a moonlight night, like they do in\r\nCentaville sometimes; jus\' packed down with young folks--and start out\r\nfur a dance up the coast. They ain\'t nothin\' to beat it as fah as fun\r\ngoes."\r\n\r\n"It must be just jolly. I guess you\'re a pretty good dancer,\r\nGr\xe9goire?"\r\n\r\n"Well--\'taint fur me to say. But they ain\'t many can out dance me: not\r\nin Natchitoches pa\'ish, anyway. I can say that much."\r\n\r\nIf such a thing could have been, Fanny would have startled Gr\xe9goire\r\nmore than once during the drive home. Before its close she had\r\nobtained a promise from him to take her up to Natchitoches for the\r\nvery next entertainment,--averring that she didn\'t care what David\r\nsaid. If he wanted to bury himself that was his own look out. And if\r\nMrs. Laferm took people to be angels that they could live in a place\r\nlike that, and give up everything and not have any kind of enjoyment\r\nout of life, why, she was mistaken and that\'s all there was to it. To\r\nall of which freely expressed views Gr\xe9goire emphatically assented.\r\n\r\nHosmer had very soon disembarrassed himself of Torpedo, knowing that\r\nthe animal would unerringly find his way to the corn crib by supper\r\ntime. He continued his own way now untrammelled, and at an agreeable\r\nspeed which soon brought him to the spring at the road side. Here he\r\nfound Th\xe9r\xe8se, half seated against a projection of rock, in her hand a\r\nbunch of ferns which she had evidently dismounted to gather, and\r\nholding Beauregard\'s bridle while he munched at the cool wet tufts of\r\ngrass that grew everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs Hosmer rode up at a rapid pace, he swung himself from his horse\r\nalmost before the animal came to a full stop. He removed his hat,\r\nmopped his forehead, stamped about a little to relax his limbs and\r\nturned to answer the enquiry with which Th\xe9r\xe8se met him.\r\n\r\n"Left her at Morico\'s. I\'ll have to send the buggy back for her."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t forgive myself for such a blunder," said Th\xe9r\xe8se regretfully,\r\n"indeed I had no idea of that miserable beast\'s character. I never was\r\non him you know--only the little darkies, and they never complained:\r\nthey\'d as well ride cows as not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s mainly from her being unaccustomed to riding, I believe."\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Hosmer and Th\xe9r\xe8se had met alone since\r\nhis return from St. Louis. They looked at each other with full\r\nconsciousness of what lay in the other\'s mind. Th\xe9r\xe8se felt that\r\nhowever adroitly another woman might have managed the situation, for\r\nherself, it would have been a piece of affectation to completely\r\nignore it at this moment.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hosmer, perhaps I ought to have said something before this, to\r\nyou--about what you\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, congratulated me--complimented me," he replied with a\r\npretense at a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, the latter, perhaps. I think we all like to have our good and\r\nright actions recognized for their worth."\r\n\r\nHe flushed, looked at her with a smile, then laughed out-right--this\r\ntime it was no pretense.\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve been a good boy; have done as my mistress bade me and now I\'m\r\nto receive a condescending little pat on the head--and of course must\r\nsay thank you. Do you know, Mrs. Lafirme--and I don\'t see why a woman\r\nlike you oughtn\'t to know it--it\'s one of those things to drive a man\r\nmad, the sweet complaisance with which women accept situations, or\r\ninflict situations that it takes the utmost of a man\'s strength to\r\nendure."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Hosmer," said Th\xe9r\xe8se plainly discomposed, "you must\r\nconcede you decided it was the right thing to do."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t do it because I thought it was right, but because you\r\nthought it was right. But that makes no difference."\r\n\r\n"Then remember your wife is going to do the right thing herself--she\r\nadmitted as much to me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you fool yourself, as Melicent says, about what Mrs. Hosmer\r\nmeans to do. I take no account of it. But you take it so easily; so as\r\na matter of course. That\'s what exasperates me. That you, you, you,\r\nshouldn\'t have a suspicion of the torture of it; the loathsomeness of\r\nit. But how could you--how could any woman understand it? Oh forgive\r\nme, Th\xe9r\xe8se--I wouldn\'t want you to. There\'s no brute so brutal as a\r\nman," he cried, seeing the pain in her face and knowing he had caused\r\nit. "But you know you promised to help me--oh I\'m talking like an\r\nidiot."\r\n\r\n"And I do," returned Th\xe9r\xe8se, "that is, I want to, I mean to."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t tell me again that I have done right. Only look at me\r\nsometimes a little differently than you do at Hiram or the gate post.\r\nLet me once in a while see a look in your face that tells me that you\r\nunderstand--if it\'s only a little bit."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se thought it best to interrupt the situation; so, pale and\r\nsilently she prepared to mount her horse. He came to her assistance of\r\ncourse, and when she was seated she drew off her loose riding glove\r\nand held out her hand to him. He pressed it gratefully, then touched\r\nit with his lips; then turned it and kissed the half open palm.\r\n\r\nShe did not leave him this time, but rode at his side in silence with\r\na frown and little line of thought between her blue eyes.\r\n\r\nAs they were nearing the store she said diffidently: "Mr. Hosmer, I\r\nwonder if it wouldn\'t be best for you to put the mill in some one\r\nelse\'s charge--and go away from Place-du-Bois."\r\n\r\n"I believe you always speak with a purpose, Mrs. Lafirme: you have\r\nsomebody\'s ultimate good in view, when you say that. Is it your own,\r\nor mine or whose is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! not mine."\r\n\r\n"I will leave Place-du-Bois, certainly, if you wish it."\r\n\r\nAs she looked at him she was forced to admit that she had never seen\r\nhim look as he did now. His face, usually serious, had a whole\r\nunwritten tragedy in it. And she felt altogether sore and puzzled and\r\nexasperated over man\'s problematic nature.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it should be left entirely to me to say. Doesn\'t your\r\nown reason suggest a proper course in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"My reason is utterly unable to determine anything in which you are\r\nconcerned. Mrs. Lafirme," he said checking his horse and laying a\r\nrestraining hand on her bridle, "let me speak to you one moment. I\r\nknow you are a woman to whom one may speak the truth. Of course, you\r\nremember that you prevailed upon me to go back to my wife. To you it\r\nseemed the right thing--to me it seemed certainly hard--but no more\r\nnor less than taking up the old unhappy routine of life, where I had\r\nleft it when I quitted her. I reasoned much like a stupid child who\r\nthinks the colors in his kaleidoscope may fall twice into the same\r\ndesign. In place of the old, I found an entirely new situation--horrid,\r\nsickening, requiring such a strain upon my energies to live through\r\nit, that I believe it\'s an absurdity to waste so much moral force for\r\nso poor an aim--there would be more dignity in putting an end to my\r\nlife. It doesn\'t make it any the more bearable to feel that the cause\r\nof this unlooked for change lies within myself--my altered feelings.\r\nBut it seems to me that I have the right to ask you not to take\r\nyourself out of my life; your moral support; your bodily atmosphere. I\r\nhope not to give way to the weakness of speaking of these things\r\nagain: but before you leave me, tell me, do you understand a little\r\nbetter why I need you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand now; and I thank you for talking so openly to me.\r\nDon\'t go away from Place-du-Bois: it would make me very wretched."\r\n\r\nShe said no more and he was glad of it, for her last words held almost\r\nthe force of action for him; as though she had let him feel for an\r\ninstant her heart beat against his own with an echoing pain.\r\n\r\nTheir ways now diverged. She went in the direction of the house and he\r\nto the store where he found Gr\xe9goire, whom he sent for his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOne Night.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Gr\xe9goire was right: do you know those nasty creatures have gone and\r\nleft every speck of the supper dishes unwashed? I\'ve got half a mind\r\nto give them both warning to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nFanny had come in from the kitchen to the sitting-room, and the above\r\nhomily was addressed to her husband who stood lighting his cigar. He\r\nhad lately taken to smoking.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better do nothing of the kind; you wouldn\'t find it easy to\r\nreplace them. Put up a little with their vagaries: this sort of thing\r\nonly happens once a year."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it won\'t be something else just as ridiculous\r\nto-morrow? And that idiot of a Minervy; what do you suppose she told\r\nme when I insisted on her staying to wash up things? She says, last\r\nwhatever you call it, her husband wanted to act hard-headed and staid\r\nout after dark, and when he was crossing the bayou, the spirits jerked\r\nhim off his horse and dragged him up and down in the water, till he\r\nwas nearly drowned. I don\'t see what you\'re laughing at; I guess you\'d\r\nlike to make out that they\'re in the right."\r\n\r\nHosmer was perfectly aware that Fanny had had a drink, and he rightly\r\nguessed that Morico had given it to her. But he was at a loss to\r\naccount for the increasing symptoms of intoxication that she showed.\r\nHe tried to persuade her to go to bed; but his efforts to that end\r\nremained unheeded, till she had eased her mind of an accumulation of\r\ngrievances, mostly fancied. He had much difficulty in preventing her\r\nfrom going over to give Melicent a piece of her mind about her lofty\r\nairs and arrogance in thinking herself better than other people. And\r\nshe was very eager to tell Th\xe9r\xe8se that she meant to do as she liked,\r\nand would stand no poking of noses in her business. It was a good\r\nwhile before she fell into a heavy sleep, after shedding a few maudlin\r\ntears over the conviction that he intended to leave her again, and\r\nclinging to his neck with beseeching enquiry whether he loved her.\r\n\r\nHe went out on the veranda feeling much as if he had been wrestling\r\nwith a strong adversary who had mastered him, and whom he was glad to\r\nbe freed of, even at the cost of coming inglorious from the conflict.\r\nThe night was so dark, so hushed, that if ever the dead had wished to\r\nstep from their graves and take a stroll above ground, they could not\r\nhave found a more fitting hour. Hosmer walked very long in the\r\nsoothing quiet. He would have liked to walk the night through. The\r\nlast three hours had been like an acute physical pain, that was over\r\nfor the moment, and that being over, left his mind free to return to\r\nthe delicious consciousness, that he had needed to be reminded of,\r\nthat Th\xe9r\xe8se loved him after all. When his measured tread upon the\r\nveranda finally ceased to mark the passing hours, a quiet that was\r\nalmost pulseless fell upon the plantation. Place-du-Bois slept.\r\nPerhaps the only night in the year that some or other of the negroes\r\ndid not lurk in fence corners, or make exchange of nocturnal visits.\r\n\r\nBut out in the hills there was no such unearthly stillness reigning.\r\nThose restless wood-dwellers, that never sleep, were sending startling\r\ngruesome calls to each other. Bats were flapping and whirling and\r\ndarting hither and thither; the gliding serpent making quick rustle\r\namid the dry, crisp leaves, and over all sounded the murmur of the\r\ngreat pine trees, telling their mystic secrets to the night.\r\n\r\nA human creature was there too, feeling a close fellowship with these\r\nspirits of night and darkness; with no more fear in his heart than the\r\nunheeded serpent crossing his path. Every inch of the ground he knew.\r\nHe wanted no daylight to guide him. Had his eyes been blinded he would\r\nno doubt have bent his body close to earth and scented his way along\r\nlike the human hound that he was. Over his shoulder hung the polished\r\nrifle that sent dull and sudden gleamings into the dark. A large tin\r\npail swung from his hand. He was very careful of this pail--or its\r\ncontents, for he feared to lose a drop. And when he accidentally\r\nstruck an intervening tree and spilled some upon the ground, he\r\nmuttered a curse against his own awkwardness.\r\n\r\nTwice since leaving his cabin up in the clearing, he had turned to\r\ndrive back his yellow skulking dog that followed him. Each time the\r\nbrute had fled in abject terror, only to come creeping again into his\r\nmaster\'s footsteps, when he thought himself forgotten. Here was a\r\ncompanion whom neither Jo\xe7int nor his mission required. Exasperated,\r\nhe seated himself on a fallen tree and whistled softly. The dog, who\r\nhad been holding back, dashed to his side, trembling with eagerness,\r\nand striving to twist his head around to lick the hand that patted\r\nhim. Jo\xe7int\'s other hand glided quickly into his pocket, from which he\r\ndrew forth a coil of thin rope that he flung deftly over the animal\'s\r\nhead, drawing it close and tight about the homely, shaggy throat. So\r\nquickly was the action done, that no sound was uttered, and Jo\xe7int\r\ncontinued his way untroubled by his old and faithful friend, whom he\r\nleft hanging to the limb of a tree.\r\n\r\nHe was following the same path that he traversed daily to and from the\r\nmill, and which soon brought him out into the level with its soft\r\ntufted grass and clumps of squat thorn trees. There was no longer the\r\nprotecting wood to screen him; but of such there was no need, for the\r\ndarkness hung about him like the magic mantle of story. Nearing the\r\nmill he grew cautious, creeping along with the tread of a stealthy\r\nbeast, and halting at intervals to listen for sounds that he wished\r\nnot to hear. He knew there was no one on guard tonight. A movement in\r\nthe bushes near by, made him fall quick and sprawling to earth. It was\r\nonly Gr\xe9goire\'s horse munching the soft grass. Jo\xe7int drew near and\r\nlaid his hand on the horse\'s back. It was hot and reeking with sweat.\r\nHere was a fact to make him more wary. Horses were not found in such\r\ncondition from quietly grazing of a cool autumn night. He seated\r\nhimself upon the ground, with his hands clasped about his knees, all\r\ndoubled up in a little heap, and waited there with the patience of the\r\nsavage, letting an hour go by, whilst he made no movement.\r\n\r\nThe hour past, he stole towards the mill, and began his work of\r\nsprinkling the contents of his pail here and there along the dry\r\ntimbers at well calculated distances, with care that no drop should be\r\nlost. Then, he drew together a great heap of crisp shavings and\r\nslathers, plentifully besprinkling it with what remained in the can.\r\nWhen he had struck a match against his rough trousers and placed it\r\ncarefully in the midst of this small pyramid, he found that he had\r\ndone his work but too surely. The quick flame sprang into life,\r\nseizing at once all it could reach. Leaping over intervals; effacing\r\nthe darkness that had shrouded him; seeming to mock him as a fool and\r\npoint him out as a target for heaven and earth to hurl destruction at\r\nif they would. Where should he hide himself? He only thought now of\r\nhow he might have done the deed differently, and with safety to\r\nhimself. He stood with great beams and loose planks surrounding him;\r\nquaking with a premonition of evil. He wanted to fly in one direction;\r\nthen thought it best to follow the opposite; but a force outside of\r\nhimself seemed to hold him fast to one spot. When turning suddenly\r\nabout, he knew it was too late, he felt that all was lost, for there\r\nwas Gr\xe9goire, not twenty paces away--covering him with the muzzle of a\r\npistol and--cursed luck--his own rifle along with the empty pail in\r\nthe raging fire.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was passing a restless night. She had lain long awake,\r\ndwelling on the insistent thoughts that the day\'s happenings had given\r\nrise to. The sleep which finally came to her was troubled by\r\ndreams--demoniac--grotesque. Hosmer was in a danger from which she was\r\nstriving with physical effort to rescue him, and when she dragged him\r\npainfully from the peril that menaced him, she turned to see that it\r\nwas Fanny whom she had saved--laughing at her derisively, and Hosmer\r\nhad been left to perish. The dream was agonizing; like an appalling\r\nnightmare. She awoke in a fever of distress, and raised herself in bed\r\nto shake off the unnatural impression which such a dream can leave.\r\nThe curtains were drawn aside from the window that faced her bed, and\r\nlooking out she saw a long tongue of flame, reaching far up into the\r\nsky--away over the tree tops and the whole Southern horizon a glow.\r\nShe knew at once that the mill was burning, and it was the affair of a\r\nmoment with her to spring from her bed and don slippers and wrapper.\r\nShe knocked on Melicent\'s door to acquaint her with the startling\r\nnews; then hurried out into the back yard and rang the plantation\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nNext she was at the cottage rousing Hosmer. But the alarm of the bell\r\nhad already awakened him, and he was dressed and out on the porch\r\nalmost as soon as Th\xe9r\xe8se had called. Melicent joined them, highly\r\nagitated, and prepared to contribute her share towards any scene that\r\nmight be going forward. But she found little encouragement for heroics\r\nwith Hosmer. In saddling his horse rather hastily he was as unmoved as\r\nthough preparing for an uneventful morning canter. He stood at the\r\nfoot of the stairs preparing to mount when Gr\xe9goire rode up as if\r\npursued by furies; checking his horse with a quick, violent wrench\r\nthat set it quivering in its taut limbs.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Hosmer, "I guess it\'s done for. How did it happen? who\r\ndid it?"\r\n\r\n"Jo\xe7int\'s work," answered Gr\xe9goire bitingly.\r\n\r\n"The damned scoundrel," muttered Hosmer, "where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Don\' botha \'bout Jo\xe7int; he ain\'t goin\' to set no mo\' mill afire,"\r\nsaying which, he turned his horse and the two rode furiously away.\r\n\r\nMelicent grasped Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s arm convulsively.\r\n\r\n"What does he mean?" she asked in a frightened whisper.\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t know," Th\xe9r\xe8se faltered. She had clasped her hands\r\nspasmodically together, at Gr\xe9goire\'s words, trembling with horror of\r\nwhat must be their meaning.\r\n\r\n"May be he arrested him," suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n"I hope so. Come; let\'s go to bed: there\'s no use staying out here in\r\nthe cold and dark."\r\n\r\nHosmer had left the sitting-room door open, and Th\xe9r\xe8se entered. She\r\napproached Fanny\'s door and knocked twice: not brusquely, but\r\nsufficiently loud to be heard from within, by any one who was awake.\r\nNo answer came, and she went away, knowing that Fanny slept.\r\n\r\nThe unusual sound of the bell, ringing two hours past midnight--that\r\nvery deadest hour of the night--had roused the whole plantation. On\r\nall sides squads of men and a few venturesome women were hurrying\r\ntowards the fire; the dread of supernatural encounters overcome for\r\nthe moment by such strong reality and by the confidence lent them in\r\neach other\'s company.\r\n\r\nThere were many already gathered around the mill, when Gr\xe9goire and\r\nHosmer reached it. All effort to save anything had been abandoned as\r\nuseless. The books and valuables had been removed from the office. The\r\nfew householders--mill-hands--whose homes were close by, had carried\r\ntheir scant belongings to places of safety, but everything else was\r\ngiven over to the devouring flames.\r\n\r\nThe heat from this big raging fire was intense, and had driven most of\r\nthe gaping spectators gradually back--almost into the woods. But\r\nthere, to one side, where the fire was rapidly gaining, and making\r\nitself already uncomfortably felt, stood a small awe-stricken group\r\ntalking in whispers; their ignorance and superstition making them\r\nirresolute to lay a hand upon the dead Jo\xe7int. His body lay amongst\r\nthe heavy timbers, across a huge beam, with arms outstretched and head\r\nhanging down upon the ground. The glazed eyes were staring up into the\r\nred sky, and on his swarthy visage was yet the horror which had come\r\nthere, when he looked in the face of death.\r\n\r\n"In God\'s name, what are you doing?" cried Hosmer. "Can\'t some of you\r\ncarry that boy\'s body to a place of safety?"\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire had followed, and was looking down indifferently at the dead.\r\n"Come, len\' a han\' there; this is gittin\' too durn hot," he said,\r\nstooping to raise the lifeless form. Hosmer was preparing to help him.\r\nBut there was some one staggering through the crowd; pushing men to\r\nright and left. With now a hand upon the breast of both Hosmer and\r\nGr\xe9goire, and thrusting them with such force and violence, as to lay\r\nthem prone amongst the timbers. It was the father. It was old Morico.\r\nHe had awakened in the night and missed his boy. He had seen the fire;\r\nindeed close enough that he could hear its roaring; and he knew\r\neverything. The whole story was plain to him as if it had been told by\r\na revealing angel. The strength of his youth had come back to speed\r\nhim over the ground.\r\n\r\n"Murderers!" he cried looking about him with hate in his face. He did\r\nnot know who had done it; no one knew yet, and he saw in every man he\r\nlooked upon the possible slayer of his child.\r\n\r\nSo here he stood over the prostrate figure; his old gray jeans hanging\r\nloosely about him; wild eyed--with bare head clasped between his\r\nclaw-like hands, which the white disheveled hair swept over. Hosmer\r\napproached again, offering gently to help him carry his son away.\r\n\r\n"Stand back," he hurled at him. But he had understood the offer. His\r\nboy must not be left to burn like a log of wood. He bent down and\r\nstrove to lift the heavy body, but the effort was beyond his strength.\r\nSeeing this he stooped again and this time grasped it beneath the\r\narms; then slowly, draggingly, with halting step, began to move\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\nThe fire claimed no more attention. All eyes were fastened upon this\r\nweird picture; a sight which moved the most callous to offer again and\r\nagain assistance, that was each time spurned with an added defiance.\r\n\r\nHosmer stood looking on, with folded arms; moved by the grandeur and\r\nmajesty of the scene. The devouring element, loosed in its awful\r\nrecklessness there in the heart of this lonely forest. The motley\r\ngroup of black and white standing out in the great red light,\r\npowerless to do more than wait and watch. But more was he stirred to\r\nthe depths of his being, by the sight of this human tragedy enacted\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nOnce, the old man stops in his backward journey. Will he give over?\r\nhas his strength deserted him? is the thought that seizes every\r\non-looker. But no--with renewed effort he begins again his slow\r\nretreat, till at last a sigh of relief comes from the whole watching\r\nmultitude. Morico with his burden has reached a spot of safety. What\r\nwill he do next? They watch in breathless suspense. But Morico does\r\nnothing. He only stands immovable as a carved image. Suddenly there is\r\na cry that reaches far above the roar of fire and crash of falling\r\ntimbers: "_Mon fils! mon gar\xe7on!_" and the old man totters and falls\r\nbackward to earth, still clinging to the lifeless body of his son. All\r\nhasten towards him. Hosmer reaches him first. And when he gently lifts\r\nthe dead Jo\xe7int, the father this time makes no hinderance, for he too\r\nhas gone beyond the knowledge of all earthly happenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMelicent Leaves Place-du-Bois.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been no witness to the killing of Jo\xe7int; but there were few\r\nwho did not recognize Gr\xe9goire\'s hand in the affair. When met with the\r\naccusation, he denied it, or acknowledged it, or evaded the charge\r\nwith a jest, as he felt for the moment inclined. It was a deed\r\ncharacteristic of any one of the Santien boys, and if not altogether\r\nlaudable--Jo\xe7int having been at the time of the shooting unarmed--yet\r\nwas it thought in a measure justified by the heinousness of his\r\noffense, and beyond dispute, a benefit to the community.\r\n\r\nHosmer reserved the expression of his opinion. The occurrence once\r\nover, with the emotions which it had awakened, he was inclined to look\r\nat it from one of those philosophic stand-points of his friend\r\nHomeyer. Heredity and pathology had to be considered in relation with\r\nthe slayer\'s character. He saw in it one of those interesting problems\r\nof human existence that are ever turning up for man\'s contemplation,\r\nbut hardly for the exercise of man\'s individual judgment. He was\r\nconscious of an inward repulsion which this action of Gr\xe9goire\'s\r\nawakened in him,--much the same as a feeling of disgust for an animal\r\nwhose instinct drives it to the doing of violent deeds,--yet he made\r\nno difference in his manner towards him.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was deeply distressed over this double tragedy: feeling keenly\r\nthe unhappy ending of old Morico. But her chief sorrow came from the\r\ncallousness of Gr\xe9goire, whom she could not move even to an avowal of\r\nregret. He could not understand that he should receive any thing but\r\npraise for having rid the community of so offensive and dangerous a\r\npersonage as Jo\xe7int; and seemed utterly blind to the moral aspect of\r\nhis deed.\r\n\r\nAn event at once so exciting and dramatic as this conflagration, with\r\nthe attendant deaths of Morico and his son, was much discussed amongst\r\nthe negroes. They were a good deal of one opinion in regard to Jo\xe7int\r\nhaving been only properly served in getting "w\'at he done ben lookin\'\r\nfu\' dis long time." Gr\xe9goire was rather looked upon as a clever\r\ninstrument in the Lord\'s service; and the occurrence pointed a moral\r\nwhich they were not likely to forget.\r\n\r\nThe burning of the mill entailed much work upon Hosmer, to which he\r\nturned with a zest--an absorption that for the time excluded\r\neverything else.\r\n\r\nMelicent had shunned Gr\xe9goire since the shooting. She had avoided\r\nspeaking with him--even looking at him. During the turmoil which\r\nclosely followed upon the tragic event, this change in the girl had\r\nescaped his notice. On the next day he suspected it only. But the\r\nthird day brought him the terrible conviction. He did not know that\r\nshe was making preparations to leave for St. Louis, and quite\r\naccidentally overheard Hosmer giving an order to one of the unemployed\r\nmill hands to call for her baggage on the following morning before\r\ntrain time.\r\n\r\nAs much as he had expected her departure, and looked painfully forward\r\nto it, this certainty--that she was leaving on the morrow and without\r\na word to him--bewildered him. He abandoned at once the work that was\r\noccupying him.\r\n\r\n"I didn\' know Miss Melicent was goin\' away to-morrow," he said in a\r\nstrange pleading voice to Hosmer.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," Hosmer answered, "I thought you knew. She\'s been talking\r\nabout it for a couple of days."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\' know nothin\' \'tall \'bout it," he said, turning away and\r\nreaching for his hat, but with such nerveless hand that he almost\r\ndropped it before placing it on his head.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going to the house," Hosmer called after him, "tell\r\nMelicent that Woodson won\'t go for her trunks before morning. She\r\nthought she\'d need to have them ready to-night."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if I go to the house. I don\' know if I\'m goin\' to the house or\r\nnot," he replied, walking listlessly away.\r\n\r\nHosmer looked after the young man, and thought of him for a moment: of\r\nhis soft voice and gentle manner--perplexed that he should be the same\r\nwho had expressed in confidence the single regret that he had not been\r\nable to kill Jo\xe7int more than once.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire went directly to the house, and approached that end of the\r\nveranda on which Melicent\'s room opened. A trunk had already been\r\npacked and fastened and stood outside, just beneath the low-silled\r\nwindow that was open. Within the room, and also beneath the window,\r\nwas another trunk, before which Melicent kneeled, filling it more or\r\nless systematically from an abundance of woman\'s toggery that lay in a\r\ncumbrous heap on the floor beside her. Gr\xe9goire stopped at the window\r\nto tell her, with a sad attempt at indifference:\r\n\r\n"Yo\' brotha says don\'t hurry packin\'; Woodson ain\'t goin\' to come fur\r\nyour trunks tell mornin\'."\r\n\r\n"All right, thank you," glancing towards him for an instant carelessly\r\nand going on with her work.\r\n\r\n"I didn\' know you was goin\' away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s absurd: you knew all along I was going away," she returned,\r\nwith countenance as expressionless as feminine subtlety could make it.\r\n\r\n"W\'y don\'t you let somebody else do that? Can\'t you come out yere a\r\nw\'ile?"\r\n\r\n"No, I prefer doing it myself; and I don\'t care to go out."\r\n\r\nWhat could he do? what could he say? There were no convenient depths\r\nin his mind from which he might draw at will, apt and telling speeches\r\nto taunt her with. His heart was swelling and choking him, at sight of\r\nthe eyes that looked anywhere, but in his own; at sight of the lips\r\nthat he had one time kissed, pressed into an icy silence. She went on\r\nwith her task of packing, unmoved. He stood a while longer, silently\r\nwatching her, his hat in his hands that were clasped behind him, and a\r\nstupor of grief holding him vise-like. Then he walked away. He felt\r\nsomewhat as he remembered to have felt oftentimes as a boy, when ill\r\nand suffering, his mother would put him to bed and send him a cup of\r\nbouillon perhaps, and a little negro to sit beside him. It seemed very\r\ncruel to him now that some one should not do something for him--that\r\nhe should be left to suffer this way. He walked across the lawn over\r\nto the cottage, where he saw Fanny pacing slowly up and down the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nShe saw him approach and stood in a patch of sunlight to wait for him.\r\nHe really had nothing to say to her as he stood grasping two of the\r\nbalustrades and looking up at her. He wanted somebody to talk to him\r\nabout Melicent.\r\n\r\n"Did you know Miss Melicent was goin\' away?"\r\n\r\nHad it been Hosmer or Th\xe9r\xe8se asking her the question she would have\r\nreplied simply "yes," but to Gr\xe9goire she said "yes; thank Goodness,"\r\nas frankly as though she had been speaking to Belle Worthington. "I\r\ndon\'t see what\'s kept her down here all this time, anyway."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like her?" he asked, stupefied at the strange possibility\r\nof any one not loving Melicent to distraction.\r\n\r\n"No. You wouldn\'t either, if you knew her as well as I do. If she\r\nlikes a person she goes on like a lunatic over them as long as it\r\nlasts; then good-bye John! she\'ll throw them aside as she would an old\r\ndress."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe she thinks a heap of Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se."\r\n\r\n"All right; you\'ll see how much she thinks of Aunt Th\xe9r\xe8se. And the\r\npeople she\'s been engaged to! There ain\'t a worse flirt in the city of\r\nSt. Louis; and always some excuse or other to break it off at the last\r\nminute. I haven\'t got any use for her, Lord knows. There ain\'t much\r\nlove lost between us."\r\n\r\n"Well, I reckon she knows they ain\'t anybody born, good enough fur\r\nher?" he said, thinking of those engagements that she had shattered.\r\n\r\n"What was David doing?" Fanny asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Writin\' lettas at the sto\'."\r\n\r\n"Did he say when he was coming?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Do you guess he\'ll come pretty soon?"\r\n\r\n"No, I reckon not fur a good w\'ile."\r\n\r\n"Is Melicent with Mrs. Laferm?"\r\n\r\n"No; she\'s packin\' her things."\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll go sit with Mrs. Laferm, d\'you think she\'ll mind?"\r\n\r\n"No, she\'ll be glad to have you."\r\n\r\nFanny crossed over to go join Th\xe9r\xe8se. She liked to be with her when\r\nthere was no danger of interruption from Melicent, and Gr\xe9goire went\r\nwandering aimlessly about the plantation.\r\n\r\nHe staked great hopes on what the night might bring for him. She would\r\nmelt, perhaps, to the extent of a smile or one of her old glances. He\r\nwas almost cheerful when he seated himself at table; only he and his\r\naunt and Melicent. He had never seen her look so handsome as now, in a\r\nwoolen gown that she had not worn before, of warm rich tint, that\r\nbrought out a certain regal splendor that he had not suspected in her.\r\nA something that she seemed to have held in reserve till this final\r\nmoment. But she had nothing for him--nothing. All her conversation was\r\naddressed to Th\xe9r\xe8se; and she hurried away from table at the close of\r\nthe meal, under pretext of completing her arrangements for departure.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t she mean to speak to me?" he asked fiercely of Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gr\xe9goire, I see so much trouble around me; so many sad mistakes,\r\nand I feel so powerless to right them; as if my hands were tied. I\r\ncan\'t help you in this; not now. But let me help you in other ways.\r\nWill you listen to me?"\r\n\r\n"If you want to help me, Aunt," he said stabbing his fork into a piece\r\nof bread before him, "go and ask her if she doesn\'t mean to talk to\r\nme: if she won\'t come out on the gallery a minute."\r\n\r\n"Gr\xe9goire wants to know if you won\'t go out and speak to him a moment,\r\nMelicent," said Th\xe9r\xe8se entering the girl\'s room. "Do as you wish, of\r\ncourse. But remember you are going away to-morrow; you\'ll likely never\r\nsee him again. A friendly word from you now, may do more good than you\r\nimagine. I believe he\'s as unhappy at this moment as a creature can\r\nbe!"\r\n\r\nMelicent looked at her horrified. "I don\'t understand you at all, Mrs.\r\nLafirme. Think what he\'s done; murdered a defenseless man! How can you\r\nhave him near you--seated at your table? I don\'t know what nerves you\r\nhave in your bodies, you and David. There\'s David, hobnobbing with\r\nhim. Even that Fanny talking to him as if he were blameless. Never! If\r\nhe were dying I wouldn\'t go near him."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you a spark of humanity in you?" asked Th\xe9r\xe8se, flushing\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is something physical," she replied, shivering, "let me\r\nalone."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se went out to Gr\xe9goire, who stood waiting on the veranda. She\r\nonly took his hand and pressed it telling him good-night, and he knew\r\nthat it was a dismissal.\r\n\r\nThere may be lovers, who, under the circumstances, would have felt\r\nsufficient pride to refrain from going to the dep\xf4t on the following\r\nmorning, but Gr\xe9goire was not one of them. He was there. He who only a\r\nweek before had thought that nothing but her constant presence could\r\nreconcile him with life, had narrowed down the conditions for his\r\nlife\'s happiness now to a glance or a kind word. He stood close to the\r\nsteps of the Pullman car that she was about to enter, and as she\r\npassed him he held out his hand, saying "Good-bye." But he held his\r\nhand to no purpose. She was much occupied in taking her valise from\r\nthe conductor who had hoisted her up, and who was now shouting in\r\nstentorian tones "All aboard," though there was not a soul with the\r\nslightest intention of boarding the train but herself.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward to wave good-bye to Hosmer, and Fanny, and Th\xe9r\xe8se,\r\nwho were on the platform; then she was gone.\r\n\r\nGr\xe9goire stood looking stupidly at the vanishing train.\r\n\r\n"Are you going back with us?" Hosmer asked him. Fanny and Th\xe9r\xe8se had\r\nwalked ahead.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied, looking at Hosmer with ashen face, "I got to go fine\r\nmy hoss."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWith Loose Rein.\r\n\r\n\r\n"De Lord be praised fu\' de blessin\'s dat he showers down \'pon us," was\r\nUncle Hiram\'s graceful conclusion of his supper, after which he pushed\r\nhis empty plate aside regretfully, and addressed Aunt Belindy.\r\n"\xa0\'Pears to me, Belindy, as you reached a pint wid dem bacon an\' greens\r\nto-night, dat you never tetched befo\'. De pint o\' de flavorin\' is w\'at\r\nI alludes to."\r\n\r\n"All de same, dat ain\'t gwine to fetch no mo\'," was the rather uncivil\r\nreply to this neat compliment to her culinary powers.\r\n\r\n"Dah!" cried the youthful Betsy, who formed one of the trio gathered\r\ntogether in the kitchen at Place-du-Bois. "Jis listen (to) Unc\' Hiurm!\r\nAunt B\'lindy neva tetched a han\' to dem bacon an\' greens. She tole me\r\nout o\' her own mouf to put\'em on de fiar; she warn\'t gwine pesta wid\r\n\'em."\r\n\r\n"Warn\'t gwine pesta wid \'em?" administering a cuff on the ear of the\r\ntoo communicative Betsy, that sent her sprawling across the table.\r\n"T\'inks I\'se gwine pesta wid you--does you? Messin\' roun\' heah in de\r\nkitchin\' an\' ain\'t tu\'ned down a bed or drawed a bah, or done a lick\r\no\' yo\' night wurk yit."\r\n\r\n"I is done my night wurk, too," returned Betsy whimpering but\r\ndefiantly, as she retreated beyond reach of further blows from Aunt\r\nBelindy\'s powerful right hand.\r\n\r\n"Dat harshness o\' yourn, Belindy, is wat\'s a sourin\' yo\' tempa, an\' a\r\nturnin\' of it intur gall an\' wormwood. Does you know wat de Scripture\r\ntells us of de wrathful woman?"\r\n\r\n"Whar I got time to go a foolin\' wid Scripture? W\'at I wants to know;\r\nwhar dat Pierson boy, he don\'t come. He ben gone time \'nough to walk\r\nto Natch\'toches an\' back."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t dat him I years yonda tu de crib?" suggestod Betsy, coming to\r\njoin Aunt Belindy in the open doorway.\r\n\r\n"You heahs mos\' too much fu\' yo\' own good, you does, gal."\r\n\r\nBut Betsy was right. For soon a tall, slim negro, young and coal\r\nblack, mounted the stairs and came into the kitchen, where he\r\ndeposited a meal bag filled with various necessities that he had\r\nbrought from Centerville. He was one of the dancers who had displayed\r\ntheir skill before Melicent and Gr\xe9goire. Uncle Hiram at once accosted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pierson, we jest a ben a wonderin\' consarnin\' you. W\'at was de\r\n\'casion o\' dat long delay?"\r\n\r\n"De \'casion? W\'y man alive, I couldn\'t git a dog gone soul in de town\r\nto wait on me."\r\n\r\n"Dat boy kin lie, yas," said Aunt Belindy, "God A\'mighty knows ever\r\ntime I ben to Centaville dem sto\' keepas ain\'t done a blessed t\'ing\r\nbut settin\' down."\r\n\r\n"Settin\' down--Lord! dey warn\'t settin\' down to-day; you heah me."\r\n\r\n"W\'at dey doin\' ef dey ain\'t settin\' down, Unc\' Pierson?" asked Betsy\r\nwith amiable curiosity.\r\n\r\n"You jis drap dat \'uncle,\' you," turning wrathfully upon the girl,\r\n"sence w\'en you start dat new trick?"\r\n\r\n"Lef de chile \'lone, Pierson, lef \'er alone. Come heah, Betsy, an\' set\r\nby yo\' Uncle Hiurm."\r\n\r\nFrom the encouraging nearness of Uncle Hiram, she ventured to ask\r\n"w\'at you \'low dey doin\' ef dey ain\'t settin\' down?" this time without\r\nadding the offensive title.\r\n\r\n"Dey flyin\' \'roun\', Lord! dey hidin\' dey sef! dey gittin\' out o\' de\r\nway, I tell you. Gr\xe9gor jis ben a raisin\' ole Cain in Centaville."\r\n\r\n"I know\'d it; could a\' tole you dat mese\'f. My Lan\'! but dats a piece,\r\ndat Gr\xe9gor," Aunt Belindy enunciated between paroxysms of laughter,\r\nseating herself with her fat arms resting on her knees, and her whole\r\nbearing announcing pleased anticipation.\r\n\r\n"Dat boy neva did have no car\' fur de salvation o\' his soul," groaned\r\nUncle Hiram.\r\n\r\n"W\'at he ben a doin\' yonda?" demanded Aunt Belindy impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Pierson, assuming a declamatory air and position in the\r\nmiddle of the large kitchen, "he lef\' heah--w\'at time he lef heah,\r\nAunt B\'lindy?"\r\n\r\n"He done lef\' fo\' dinna, \'caze I seed \'im a lopin\' to\'ads de riva,\r\ntime I flung dat Sampson boy out o\' de doo\', bringin\' dem greens in\r\nheah \'dout washin\' of \'em."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so; it war good dinna time w\'en he come a lopin\' in town. Dat\r\nhoss look like he ben swimmin\' in Cane Riva, he done ride him so hard.\r\nHe fling he se\'f down front o\' Grammont\'s sto\' an\' he come a stompin\'\r\nin, look like gwine hu\'t somebody. Ole Grammont tell him, \'How you\r\ncome on, Gr\xe9gor? Come ova tu de house an\' eat dinna wid us: de ladies\r\nbe pleas tu see you.\'\xa0"\r\n\r\n"Humph," muttered Aunt Belindy, "dem Grammont gals be glad to see any\r\nt\'ing dat got breeches on; lef \'lone good lookin\' piece like dat\r\nGr\xe9gor."\r\n\r\n"Gr\xe9gor, he neva sey, \'Tank you dog,\' jis\' fling he big dolla down on\r\nde counta an\' \'low \'don\'t want no dinna: gimme some w\'iskey.\'\xa0"\r\n\r\n"Yas, yas, Lord," from Aunt Belindy.\r\n\r\n"Ole Grammont, he push de bottle to\'ads \'im, an\' I \'clar to Goodness\r\nef he didn\' mos fill dat tumbla to de brim, an\' drink it down, neva\r\nblink a eye.

He now shook his old\r\nwhite head, and heaved a deep sigh. "All dat gwine come hard an\' heavy\r\non de madam. She don\'t desarve it--God knows, she don\'t desarve it."\r\n\r\n"How you, ole like you is, kin look fu\' somethin\' diffunt, Unc\'\r\nHiurm?" observed Aunt Belindy philosophically. "Don\'t you know Gr\xe9gor\r\ngwine be Gr\xe9gor tell he die? Dat\'s all dar is \'bout it."\r\n\r\nBetsy arose with the sudden recollection that she had let the time\r\npass for bringing in Miss Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s hot water, and Pierson went to the\r\nstove to see what Aunt Belindy had reserved for him in the shape of\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe Reason Why.\r\n\r\n\r\nSampson, the young colored boy who had lighted Fanny\'s fire on the\r\nfirst day of her arrival at Place-du-Bois, and who had made such\r\ninsinuating advances of friendliness towards her, had continued to\r\nattract her notice and good will. He it was who lighted her fires on\r\nsuch mornings as they were needed. For there had been no winter. In\r\nmid-January, the grass was fresh and green; trees and plants were\r\nputting forth tender shoots, as if in welcome to spring; roses were\r\nblossoming, and it was a veritable atmosphere of Havana rather than of\r\ncentral Louisiana that the dwellers at Place-du-Bois were enjoying.\r\nBut finally winter made tardy assertion of its rights. One morning\r\nbroke raw and black with an icy rain falling, and young Sampson\r\narriving in the early bleakness to attend to his duties at the\r\ncottage, presented a picture of human distress to move the most\r\nhardened to pity. Though dressed comfortably in the clothing with\r\nwhich Fanny had apparelled him--he was ashen. Save for the chattering\r\nof his teeth, his body seemed possessed of a paralytic inability to\r\nmove. He knelt before the empty fire-place as he had done on that\r\nfirst day, and with deep sighs and groans went about his work. Then he\r\nremained long before the warmth that he had kindled; even lying full\r\nlength upon the soft rug, to bask in the generous heat that permeated\r\nand seemed to thaw his stiffened limbs.\r\n\r\nNext, he went quietly into the bedroom to attend to the fire there.\r\nHosmer and Fanny were still sleeping. He approached a decorated basket\r\nthat hung against the wall; a receptacle for old newspapers and odds\r\nand ends. He drew something from his rather capacious coat pocket,\r\nand, satisfying himself that Hosmer slept, thrust it in the bottom of\r\nthe basket, well covered by the nondescript accumulation that was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe house was very warm and cheerful when they arose, and after\r\nbreakfasting Hosmer felt unusually reluctant to quit his fire-side and\r\nface the inclement day; for an unaccustomed fatigue hung upon his\r\nlimbs and his body was sore, as from the effect of bruises. But he\r\nwent, nevertheless, well encased in protective rubber; and as he\r\nturned away from the house, Fanny hastened to the hanging basket, and\r\nfumbling nervously in its depths, found what the complaisant Sampson\r\nhad left for her.\r\n\r\nThe cold rain had gradually changed into a fine mist, that in\r\ndescending, spread an icy coat upon every object that it touched. When\r\nHosmer returned at noon, he did not leave the house again.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Th\xe9r\xe8se knocked at Fanny\'s door. She was\r\nenveloped in a long hooded cloak, her face glowing from contact with\r\nthe sharp moist air, and myriad crystal drops clinging to her fluffy\r\nblonde hair that looked very golden under the dark hood that covered\r\nit. She wanted to learn how Fanny accepted this unpleasant change of\r\natmospheric conditions, intending to bear her company for the\r\nremainder of the day if she found her depressed, as was often the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n"Why, I didn\'t know you were home," she said, a little startled, to\r\nHosmer who opened the door to her. "I came over to show Mrs. Hosmer\r\nsomething pretty that I don\'t suppose she ever saw before." It was a\r\nbranch from a rose-tree, bearing two open blossoms and a multitude of\r\nbuds, creamy pink, all encased in an icy transparency that gleamed\r\nlike diamonds. "Isn\'t it exquisite?" she said, holding the spray up\r\nfor Fanny\'s admiration. But she saw at a glance that the spirit of\r\nDisorder had descended and settled upon the Hosmer household.\r\n\r\nThe usually neat room was in a sad state of confusion. Some of the\r\npictures had been taken from the walls, and were leaning here and\r\nthere against chairs and tables. The mantel ornaments had been removed\r\nand deposited at random and in groups about the room. On the hearth\r\nwas a pail of water in which swam a huge sponge; and Fanny sat beside\r\nthe center-table that was piled with her husband\'s wearing apparel,\r\nholding in her lap a coat which she had evidently been passing under\r\ninspection. Her hair had escaped from its fastenings; her collar was\r\nhooked awry; her face was flushed and her whole bearing indicated her\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nHosmer took the frozen spray from Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s hand, and spoke a little\r\nabout the beauty of the trees, especially the young cedars that he had\r\npassed out in the hills on his way home.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all well and good to talk about flowers and things, Mrs.\r\nLaferm--sit down please--but when a person\'s got the job that I\'ve got\r\non my hands, she\'s something else to think about. And David here\r\nsmoking one cigar after another. He knows all I\'ve got to do, and goes\r\nand sends those darkies home right after dinner."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se was so shocked that for a while she could say nothing; till\r\nfor Hosmer\'s sake she made a quick effort to appear at ease.\r\n\r\n"What have you to do, Mrs. Hosmer? Let me help you, I can give you the\r\nwhole afternoon," she said with an appearance of being ready for any\r\nthing that was at hand to be done.\r\n\r\nFanny turned the coat over in her lap, and looked down helplessly at a\r\nstain on the collar, that she had been endeavoring to remove; at the\r\nsame time pushing aside with patient repetition the wisp of hair that\r\nkept falling over her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Belle Worthington\'ll be here before we know it; her and her husband\r\nand that Lucilla of hers. David knows how Belle Worthington is, just\r\nas well as I do; there\'s no use saying he don\'t. If she was to see a\r\nspeck of dirt in this house or on David\'s clothes, or anything, why\r\nwe\'d never hear the last of it. I got a letter from her," she\r\ncontinued, letting the coat fall to the floor, whilst she endeavored\r\nto find her pocket.\r\n\r\n"Is she coming to visit you?" asked Th\xe9r\xe8se who had taken up a feather\r\nbrush, and was dusting and replacing the various ornaments that were\r\nscattered through the room.\r\n\r\n"She\'s going down to Muddy Graw (Mardi-Gras) her and her husband and\r\nLucilla and she\'s going to stop here a while. I had that letter--I\r\nguess I must of left it in the other room."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," Th\xe9r\xe8se hastened to say, seeing that her whole energies\r\nwere centered on finding the letter.\r\n\r\n"Let me look," said Hosmer, making a movement towards the bedroom\r\ndoor, but Fanny had arisen and holding out a hand to detain him she\r\nwent into the room herself, saying she knew where she\'d left it.\r\n\r\n"Is this the reason you\'ve kept yourself shut up here in the house so\r\noften?" Th\xe9r\xe8se asked of Hosmer, drawing near him. "Never telling me a\r\nword of it," she went on, "it wasn\'t right; it wasn\'t kind."\r\n\r\n"Why should I have put any extra burden on you?" he answered, looking\r\ndown at her, and feeling a joy in her presence there, that seemed like\r\na guilty indulgence in face of his domestic shame.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stay," Th\xe9r\xe8se said. "Leave me here. Go to your office or over\r\nto the house--leave me alone with her."\r\n\r\nFanny returned, having found the letter, and spoke with increased\r\nvehemence of the necessity of having the house in perfect trim against\r\nthe arrival of Belle Worthington, from whom they would never hear the\r\nlast, and so forth.\r\n\r\n"Well, your husband is going out, and that will give us a chance to\r\nget things righted," said Th\xe9r\xe8se encouragingly. "You know men are\r\nalways in the way at such times."\r\n\r\n"It\'s what he ought to done before; and left Suze and Minervy here,"\r\nshe replied with grudging acquiescence.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated visits to the bedroom, under various pretexts, Fanny\r\ngrew utterly incapable to do more than sit and gaze stupidly at\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se, who busied herself in bringing the confusion of the\r\nsitting-room into some order.\r\n\r\nShe continued to talk disjointedly of Belle Worthington and her well\r\nknown tyrannical characteristics in regard to cleanliness; finishing\r\nby weeping mildly at the prospect of her own inability to ever reach\r\nthe high standard required by her exacting friend.\r\n\r\nIt was far in the afternoon--verging upon night, when Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nsucceeded in persuading her that she was ill and should go to bed. She\r\ngladly seized upon the suggestion of illness; assuring Th\xe9r\xe8se that\r\nshe alone had guessed her affliction: that whatever was thought\r\nsingular in her behavior must be explained by that sickness which was\r\npast being guessed at--then she went to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was late when Hosmer left his office; a rough temporary shanty, put\r\ntogether near the ruined mill.\r\n\r\nHe started out slowly on his long cold ride. His physical malaise of\r\nthe morning had augmented as the day went on, and he was beginning to\r\nadmit to himself that he was "in for it."\r\n\r\nBut the cheerless ride was lightened by a picture that had been with\r\nhim through the afternoon, and that moved him in his whole being, as\r\nthe moment approached when it might be changed to reality. He knew\r\nFanny\'s habits; knew that she would be sleeping now. Th\xe9r\xe8se would not\r\nleave her there alone in the house--of that he was sure. And he\r\npictured Th\xe9r\xe8se at this moment seated at his fire-side. He would find\r\nher there when he entered. His heart beat tumultuously at the thought.\r\nIt was a very weak moment with him, possibly, one in which his\r\nunnerved condition stood for some account. But he felt that when he\r\nsaw her there, waiting for him, he would cast himself at her feet and\r\nkiss them. He would crush her white hands against his bosom. He would\r\nbury his face in her silken hair. She should know how strong his love\r\nwas, and he would hold her in his arms till she yield back tenderness\r\nto his own. But--Th\xe9r\xe8se met him on the steps. As he was mounting\r\nthem, she was descending; wrapped in her long cloak, her pretty head\r\ncovered by the dark hood.\r\n\r\n"Oh, are you going?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe heard the note of entreaty in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered, "I shouldn\'t have left her before you came; but I\r\nknew you were here; I heard your horse\'s tread a moment ago. She\'s\r\nasleep. Good night. Take courage and have a brave heart," she said,\r\npressing his hand a moment in both hers, and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe room was as he had pictured it; order restored and the fire\r\nblazing brightly. On the table was a pot of hot tea and a tempting\r\nlittle supper laid. But he pushed it all aside and buried his face\r\ndown upon the table into his folded arms, groaning aloud. Physical\r\nsuffering; thwarted love, and at the same time a feeling of\r\nself-condemnation, made him wish that life were ended for him.\r\n\r\nFanny awoke close upon morning, not knowing what had aroused her. She\r\nwas for a little while all bewildered and unable to collect herself.\r\nShe soon learned the cause of her disturbance. Hosmer was tossing\r\nabout and his outstretched arm lay across her face, where it had\r\nevidently been flung with some violence. She took his hand to move it\r\naway, and it burned her like a coal of fire. As she touched him he\r\nstarted and began to talk incoherently. He evidently fancied himself\r\ndictating a letter to some insurance company, in no pleased terms--of\r\nwhich Fanny caught but snatches. Then:\r\n\r\n"That\'s too much, Mrs. Lafirme; too much--too much--Don\'t let Gr\xe9goire\r\nburn--take him from the fire, some one. Thirty day\'s credit--shipment\r\nmade on tenth," he rambled on at intervals in his troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nFanny trembled with apprehension as she heard him. Surely he has brain\r\nfever she thought, and she laid her hand gently on his burning\r\nforehead. He covered it with his own, muttering "Th\xe9r\xe8se, Th\xe9r\xe8se--so\r\ngood--let me love you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nPerplexing Things.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Lucilla!"\r\n\r\nThe pale, drooping girl started guiltily at her mother\'s sharp\r\nexclamation, and made an effort to throw back her shoulders. Then she\r\nbit her nails nervously, but soon desisted, remembering that that\r\nalso, as well as yielding to a relaxed tendency of the spinal column,\r\nwas a forbidden indulgence.\r\n\r\n"Put on your hat and go on out and get a breath of fresh air; you\'re\r\nas white as milk-man\'s cream."\r\n\r\nLucilla rose and obeyed her mother\'s order with the precision of a\r\nsoldier, following the directions of his commander.\r\n\r\n"How submissive and gentle your daughter is," remarked Th\xe9r\xe8se.\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s got to be, and she knows it. Why, I haven\'t got to do\r\nmore than look at that girl most times for her to understand what I\r\nwant. You didn\'t notice, did you, how she straightened up when I\r\ncalled \'Lucilla\' to her? She knows by the tone of my voice what she\'s\r\ngot to do."\r\n\r\n"Most mothers can\'t boast of having such power over their daughters."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not the woman to stand any shenanigans from a child of\r\nmine. I could name you dead loads of women that are just completely\r\nwalked over by their children. It\'s a blessing that boy of Fanny\'s\r\ndied, between you and I; its what I\'ve always said. Why, Mrs. Laferm,\r\nshe couldn\'t any more look after a youngster than she could after a\r\nbaby elephant. By the by, what do you guess is the matter with her,\r\nany way?"\r\n\r\n"How, the matter?" Th\xe9r\xe8se asked; the too ready blood flushing her\r\nface and neck as she laid down her work and looked up at Mrs.\r\nWorthington.\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s acting mighty queer, that\'s all I can say for her."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been able to see her for some time," Th\xe9r\xe8se returned,\r\ngoing back to her sewing, "but I suppose she got a little upset and\r\nnervous over her husband; he had a few days of very serious illness\r\nbefore you came."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve seen her in all sorts of states and conditions, and I\'ve\r\nnever seen her like that before. Why, she does nothing in the God\'s\r\nworld but whine and sniffle, and wish she was dead; it\'s enough to\r\ngive a person the horrors. She can\'t make out she\'s sick; I never saw\r\nher look better in my life. She must of gained ten pounds since she\r\ncome down here."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Th\xe9r\xe8se, "she was looking so well, and--and I thought\r\neverything was going well with her too, but--" and she hesitated to go\r\non.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what you want to say. You can\'t help that. No use\r\nbothering your brains about that--now you just take my advice,"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Worthington brusquely.\r\n\r\nThen she laughed so loud and suddenly that Th\xe9r\xe8se, being already\r\nnervous, pricked her finger with her needle till the blood came; a\r\nmishap which decided her to lay aside her work.\r\n\r\n"If you never saw a fish out of water, Mrs. Laferm, do take a peep at\r\nMr. Worthington astride that horse; it\'s enough to make a cat expire!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Worthington was on the whole rather inclined to take her husband\r\nseriously. As often as he might excite her disapproval, it was seldom\r\nthat he aroused her mirth. So it may be gathered that his appearance\r\nin this unfamiliar r\xf4le of horseman was of the most mirth-provoking.\r\n\r\nHe and Hosmer were dismounting at the cottage, which decided Mrs.\r\nWorthington to go and look after them; Fanny for the time being--in\r\nher opinion--not having "the gumption to look after a sick kitten."\r\n\r\n"This is what I call solid comfort," she said looking around the well\r\nappointed sitting-room, before quitting it.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be a mighty happy woman, Mrs. Laferm; only I\'d think\r\nyou\'d die of lonesomeness, sometimes."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se laughed, and told her not to forget that she expected them all\r\nover in the evening.\r\n\r\n"You can depend on me; and I\'ll do my best to drag Fanny over;\r\nso-long."\r\n\r\nWhen left alone, Th\xe9r\xe8se at once relapsed into the gloomy train of\r\nreflections that had occupied her since the day she had seen with her\r\nbodily eyes something of the wretched life that she had brought upon\r\nthe man she loved. And yet that wretchedness in its refinement of\r\ncruelty and immorality she could not guess and was never to know.\r\nStill, she had seen enough to cause her to ask herself with a shudder\r\n"was I right--was I right?"\r\n\r\nShe had always thought this lesson of right and wrong a very plain\r\none. So easy of interpretation that the simplest minded might solve it\r\nif they would. And here had come for the first time in her life a\r\nstaggering doubt as to its nature. She did not suspect that she was\r\nsubmitting one of those knotty problems to her unpracticed judgment\r\nthat philosophers and theologians delight in disagreeing upon, and her\r\ninability to unravel it staggered her. She tried to convince herself\r\nthat a very insistent sting of remorse which she felt, came from\r\nselfishness--from the pain that her own heart suffered in the\r\nknowledge of Hosmer\'s unhappiness. She was not callous enough to quiet\r\nher soul with the balm of having intended the best. She continued to\r\nask herself only "was I right?" and it was by the answer to that\r\nquestion that she would abide, whether in the stony content of\r\naccomplished righteousness, or in an enduring remorse that pointed to\r\na goal in whose labyrinthine possibilities her soul lost itself and\r\nfainted away.\r\n\r\nLucilla went out to get a breath of fresh air as her mother had\r\ncommanded, but she did not go far to seek it. Not further than the end\r\nof the back veranda, where she stood for some time motionless, before\r\nbeginning to occupy herself in a way which Aunt Belindy, who was\r\nwatching her from the kitchen window, considered highly problematical.\r\nThe negress was wiping a dish and giving it a fine polish in her\r\nabsence of mind. When her curiosity could no longer contain itself she\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n"W\'ats dat you\'se doin\' dah, you li\'le gal? Come heah an\' le\' me see."\r\nLucilla turned with the startled look which seemed to be usual with\r\nher when addressed.\r\n\r\n"Le\' me see," repeated Aunt Belindy pleasantly.\r\n\r\nLucilla approached the window and handed the woman a small square of\r\nstiff writing paper which was stuck with myriad tiny pin-holes; some\r\nof which she had been making when interrupted by Aunt Belindy.\r\n\r\n"W\'at in God A\'Mighty\'s name you call dat \'ar?" the darkey asked\r\nexamining the paper critically, as though expecting the riddle would\r\nsolve itself before her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Those are my acts I\'ve been counting," the girl replied a little\r\ngingerly.\r\n\r\n"Yo\' ax? I don\' see nuttin\' \'cep\' a piece o\' papah plum fill up wid\r\nholes. W\'at you call ax?"\r\n\r\n"Acts--acts. Don\'t you know what acts are?"\r\n\r\n"How you want me know? I neva ben to no school whar you larn all dat."\r\n\r\n"Why, an act is something you do that you don\'t want to do--or\r\nsomething you don\'t want to do, that you do--I mean that you don\'t do.\r\nOr if you want to eat something and don\'t. Or an aspiration; that\'s an\r\nact, too."\r\n\r\n"Go long! W\'ats dat--aspiration?"\r\n\r\n"Why, to say any kind of little prayer; or if you invoke our Lord, or\r\nour Blessed Lady, or one of the saints, that\'s an aspiration. You can\r\nmake them just as quick as you can think--you can make hundreds and\r\nhundreds in a day."\r\n\r\n"My Lan\'! Dat\'s w\'at you\'se studyin\' \'bout w\'en you\'se steppin\' \'roun\'\r\nheah like a droopy pullet? An\' I t\'ought you was studyin\' \'bout dat\r\nbeau you lef\' yonda to Sent Lous."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t say such things to me; I\'m going to be a religious."\r\n\r\n"How dat gwine henda you have a beau ef you\'se religious?"\r\n\r\n"The religious never get married," turning very red, "and don\'t live\r\nin the world like others."\r\n\r\n"Look heah, chile, you t\'inks I\'se fool? Religion--no religion, whar\r\nyou gwine live ef you don\' live in de word? Gwine live up in de moon?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a very ignorant person," replied Lucilla, highly offended. "A\r\nreligious devotes her life to God, and lives in the convent."\r\n\r\n"Den w\'y you neva said \'convent\'? I knows all \'bout convent. W\'at you\r\ngwine do wid dem ax w\'en de papah done all fill up?" handing the\r\nsingular tablet back to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh," replied Lucilla, "when I have thousands and thousands I gain\r\ntwenty-five years\' indulgence."\r\n\r\n"Is dat so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the girl; and divining that Aunt Belindy had not\r\nunderstood, "twenty-five years that I don\'t have to go to purgatory.\r\nYou see most people have to spend years and years in purgatory, before\r\nthey can get to Heaven."\r\n\r\n"How you know dat?"\r\n\r\nIf Aunt Belindy had asked Lucilla how she knew that the sun shone, she\r\ncould not have answered with more assurance "because I know" as she\r\nturned and walked rather scornfully away.\r\n\r\n"W\'at dat kine o\' fool talk dey larns gals up yonda tu Sent Lous? An\'\r\nhuh ma a putty woman; yas, bless me; all dress up fittin\' to kill.\r\nDon\' \'pear like she studyin\' \'bout ax."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nA Social Evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Joseph Duplan with their little daughter Ninette, who had\r\nbeen invited to Place-du-Bois for supper, as well as for the evening,\r\nwere seated with Th\xe9r\xe8se in the parlor, awaiting the arrival of the\r\ncottage guests. They had left their rather distant plantation, Les\r\nCh\xeani\xe8res, early in the afternoon, wishing as usual to make the most\r\nof these visits, which, though infrequent, were always so much\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe room was somewhat altered since that summer day when Th\xe9r\xe8se had\r\nsat in its cool shadows, hearing the story of David Hosmer\'s life.\r\nOnly with such difference, however, as the change of season called\r\nfor; imparting to it a rich warmth that invited to sociability and\r\nfriendly confidences. In the depths of the great chimney glowed with a\r\nsteady and dignified heat, the huge back-log, whose disposal Uncle\r\nHiram had superintended in person; and the leaping flames from the dry\r\nhickories that surrounded it, lent a very genial light to the\r\ngrim-visaged Lafirmes who looked down from their elevation on the\r\ninteresting group gathered about the hearth.\r\n\r\nConversation had never once flagged with these good friends; for,\r\naside from much neighborhood gossip to be told and listened to, there\r\nwas the always fertile topic of "crops" to be discussed in all its\r\nbearings, that touched, in its local and restricted sense, the labor\r\nquestion, cultivation, freight rates, and the city merchant.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Duplan there was a good deal to be said about the unusual\r\nmortality among "Plymouth-Rocks" owing to an alarming prevalence of\r\n"pip," which malady, however, that lady found to be gradually yielding\r\nto a heroic treatment introduced into her _basse-cour_ by one Coulon,\r\na piney wood sage of some repute as a mystic healer.\r\n\r\nThis was a delicate refined little woman, somewhat old-fashioned and\r\nstranded in her incapability to keep pace with the modern conduct of\r\nlife; but giving her views with a pretty self-confidence, that showed\r\nher a ruler in her peculiar realm.\r\n\r\nThe young Ninette had extended herself in an easy chair, in an\r\nattitude of graceful abandonment, the earnest brown eyes looking\r\neagerly out from under a tangle of auburn hair, and resting with\r\nabsorbed admiration upon her father, whose words and movements she\r\nfollowed with unflagging attentiveness. The fastidious little miss was\r\nclad in a dainty gown that reached scarcely below the knees; revealing\r\nthe shapely limbs that were crossed and extended to let the well shod\r\nfeet rest upon the polished brass fender.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se had given what information lay within her range, concerning\r\nthe company which was expected. But her confidences had plainly been\r\ninsufficient to prepare Mrs. Duplan for the startling effect produced\r\nby Mrs. Worthington on that little woman in her black silk of a\r\nby-gone fashion; so splendid was Mrs. Worthington\'s erect and imposing\r\nfigure, so blonde her blonde hair, so bright her striking color and so\r\ncomprehensive the sweep of her blue and scintillating gown. Yet was\r\nMrs. Worthington not at ease, as might be noticed in the unnatural\r\nquaver of her high-pitched voice and the restless motion of her hands,\r\nas she seated herself with an arm studiedly resting upon the table\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nHosmer had met the Duplans before; on the occasion of a former visit\r\nto Place-du-Bois and again at Les Ch\xeani\xe8res when he had gone to see\r\nthe planter on business connected with the lumber trade.\r\n\r\nFanny was a stranger to them and promised to remain such; for she\r\nacknowledged her presentation with a silent bow and retreated as far\r\nfrom the group as a decent concession to sociability would permit.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se with her pretty Creole tact was not long in bringing these\r\nseemingly incongruent elements into some degree of harmony. Mr. Duplan\r\nin his courteous and rather lordly way was presently imparting to Mrs.\r\nWorthington certain reminiscences of a visit to St. Louis twenty-five\r\nyears before, when he and Mrs. Duplan had rather hastily traversed\r\nthat interesting town during their wedding journey. Mr. Duplan\'s\r\nmanner had a singular effect upon Mrs. Worthington, who became\r\ndignified, subdued, and altogether unnatural in her endeavor to adjust\r\nherself to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington seated himself beside Mrs. Duplan and was soon trying\r\nto glean information, in his eager short-sighted way, of psychological\r\ninterest concerning the negro race; such effort rather bewildering\r\nthat good lady, who could not bring herself to view the negro as an\r\ninteresting or suitable theme to be introduced into polite\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nHosmer sat and talked good-naturedly to the little girls, endeavoring\r\nto dispel the shyness with which they seemed inclined to view each\r\nother--and Th\xe9r\xe8se crossed the room to join Fanny.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'re feeling better," she ventured, "you should have let me\r\nhelp you while Mr. Hosmer was ill."\r\n\r\nFanny looked away, biting her lip, the sudden tears coming to her\r\neyes. She answered with unsteady voice, "Oh, I was able to look after\r\nmy husband myself, Mrs. Laferm."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se reddened at finding herself so misunderstood. "I meant in your\r\nhousekeeping, Mrs. Hosmer; I could have relieved you of some of that\r\nworry, whilst you were occupied with your husband."\r\n\r\nFanny continued to look unhappy; her features taking on that peculiar\r\ndownward droop which Th\xe9r\xe8se had come to know and mistrust.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to New Orleans with Mrs. Worthington?" she asked, "she\r\ntold me she meant to try and persuade you."\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m not going. Why?" looking suspiciously in Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Well," laughed Th\xe9r\xe8se, "only for the sake of asking, I suppose. I\r\nthought you\'d enjoy Mardi-Gras, never having seen it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going anywheres unless David goes along," she said, with an\r\nimpertinent ring in her voice, and with a conviction that she was\r\nadministering a stab and a rebuke. She had come prepared to watch her\r\nhusband and Mrs. Lafirme, her heart swelling with jealous suspicion as\r\nshe looked constantly from one to the other, endeavoring to detect\r\nsigns of an understanding between them. Failing to discover such, and\r\nloth to be robbed of her morbid feast of misery, she set her failure\r\ndown to their pre-determined subtlety. Th\xe9r\xe8se was conscious of a\r\nchange in Fanny\'s attitude, and felt herself unable to account for it\r\notherwise than by whim, which she knew played a not unimportant r\xf4le\r\nin directing the manner of a large majority of women. Moreover, it was\r\nnot a moment to lose herself in speculation concerning this woman\'s\r\ncapricious behavior. Her guests held the first claim upon her\r\nattentions. Indeed, here was Mrs. Worthington even now loudly\r\ndemanding a pack of cards. "Here\'s a gentleman never heard of\r\nsix-handed euchre. If you\'ve got a pack of cards, Mrs. Laferm, I guess\r\nI can show him quick enough that it can be done."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t doubt Mrs. Worthington\'s ability to make any startling\r\nand pleasing revelations," rejoined the planter good humoredly, and\r\ngallantly following Mrs. Worthington who had risen with the view of\r\nputting into immediate effect her scheme of initiating these slow\r\npeople into the unsuspected possibilities of euchre; a game which,\r\nhowever adaptable in other ways, could certainly not be indulged in by\r\nseven persons. After each one proffering, as is usual on such\r\noccasions, his readiness to assume the character of on-looker, Mr.\r\nWorthington\'s claim to entire indifference, if not inability--confirmed\r\nby his wife--was accepted as the most sincere, and that gentleman was\r\nexcluded and excused.\r\n\r\nHe watched them as they seated themselves at table, even lending\r\nassistance, in his own awkward way, to range the chairs in place. Then\r\nhe followed the game for a while, standing behind Fanny to note the\r\noutcome of her reckless offer of "five on hearts," with only three\r\ntrumps in hand, and every indication of little assistance from her\r\npartners, Mr. Duplan and Belle Worthington.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the room was a long, low, well-filled book-case. Here\r\nhad been the direction of Mr. Worthington\'s secret and stolen glances\r\nthe entire evening. And now towards this point he finally transported\r\nhimself by gradual movements which he believed appeared unstudied and\r\nindifferent. He was confronted by a good deal of French--to him an\r\nunfamiliar language. Here a long row of Balzac; then, the Waverley\r\nNovels in faded red cloth of very old date. Racine, Moliere, Bulwer\r\nfollowing in more modern garb; Shakespeare in a compass that promised\r\nvery small type. His quick trained glance sweeping along the shelves,\r\ncontracted into a little frown of resentment while he sent his hand\r\nimpetuously through his scant locks, standing them quite on end.\r\n\r\nOn the very lowest shelf were five imposing volumes in dignified black\r\nand gold, bearing the simple inscription "Lives of the Saints--Rev. A.\r\nButler." Upon one of them, Mr. Worthington seized, opening it at\r\nhazard. He had fallen upon the history of St. Monica, mother of the\r\ngreat St. Austin--a woman whose habits it appears had been so closely\r\nguarded in her childhood by a pious nurse, that even the quenching of\r\nher natural thirst was permitted only within certain well defined\r\nbounds. This mentor used to say "you are now for drinking water, but\r\nwhen you come to be mistress of the cellar, water will be despised,\r\nbut the habit of drinking will stick by you." Highly interesting, Mr.\r\nWorthington thought, as he brushed his hair all down again the right\r\nway and seated himself the better to learn the fortunes of the good\r\nSt. Monica who, curiously enough, notwithstanding those early\r\nincentives to temperance, "insensibly contracted an inclination to\r\nwine," drinking "whole cups of it with pleasure as it came in her\r\nway." A "dangerous intemperance" which it finally pleased Heaven to\r\ncure through the instrumentality of a maid servant taunting her\r\nmistress with being a "wine bibber."\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington did not stop with the story of Saint Monica. He lost\r\nhimself in those details of asceticism, martyrdom, superhuman\r\npossibilities which man is capable of attaining under peculiar\r\nconditions of life--something he had not yet "gone into."\r\n\r\nThe voices at the card table would certainly have disturbed a man with\r\nless power of mind concentration. For Mrs. Worthington in this\r\nfamiliar employment was herself again--_con fuoco_. Here was Mr.\r\nDuplan in high spirits; his wife putting forth little gushes of\r\nbird-like exaltation as the fascinations of the game revealed\r\nthemselves to her. Even Hosmer and Th\xe9r\xe8se were drawn for the moment\r\nfrom their usual preoccupation. Fanny alone was the ghost of the\r\nfeast. Her features never relaxed from their settled gloom. She played\r\nat hap-hazard, listlessly throwing down the cards or letting them fall\r\nfrom her hands, vaguely asking what were trumps at inopportune\r\nmoments; showing that inattentiveness so exasperating to an eager\r\nplayer and which oftener than once drew a sharp rebuke from Belle\r\nWorthington.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you wish we could play," said Ninette to her companion from her\r\ncomfortable perch beside the fire, and looking longingly towards the\r\ncard table.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," replied Lucilla briefly, gazing into the fire, with hands\r\nfolded in her lap. Thin hands, showing up very white against the dull\r\ncolored "convent uniform" that hung in plain, severe folds about her\r\nand reached to her very ankles.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you? I play often at home when company comes. And I play\r\ncribbage and _vingt-et-un_ with papa and win lots of money from him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s wrong."\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t; papa wouldn\'t do it if it was wrong," she answered\r\ndecidedly. "Do you go to the convent?" she asked, looking critically\r\nat Lucilla and drawing a little nearer, so as to be confidential.\r\n"Tell me about it," she continued, when the other had replied\r\naffirmatively. "Is it very dreadful? you know they\'re going to send me\r\nsoon."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s the best place in the world," corrected Lucilla as eagerly\r\nas she could.\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma says she was just as happy as could be there, but you see\r\nthat\'s so awfully long ago. It must have changed since then."\r\n\r\n"The convent never changes: it\'s always the same. You first go to\r\nchapel to mass early in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Ugh!" shuddered Ninette.\r\n\r\n"Then you have studies," continued Lucilla. "Then breakfast, then\r\nrecreation, then classes, and there\'s meditation."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," interrupted Ninette, "I believe anything most would suit\r\nyou, and mamma when she was little; but if I don\'t like it--see here,\r\nif I tell you something will you promise never, never, to tell?"\r\n\r\n"Is it any thing wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not very; it isn\'t a real mortal sin. Will you promise?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Lucilla; curiosity getting something the better of her\r\npious scruples.\r\n\r\n"Cross your heart?"\r\n\r\nLucilla crossed her heart carefully, though a little reluctantly.\r\n\r\n"Hope you may die?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" exclaimed the little convent girl aghast.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw," laughed Ninette, "never mind. But that\'s what Polly\r\nalways says when she wants me to believe her: \'hope I may die, Miss\r\nNinette.\' Well, this is it: I\'ve been saving up money for the longest\r\ntime, oh ever so long. I\'ve got eighteen dollars and sixty cents, and\r\nwhen they send me to the convent, if I don\'t like it, I\'m going to run\r\naway." This last and startling revelation was told in a tragic whisper\r\nin Lucilla\'s ear, for Betsy was standing before them with a tray of\r\nchocolate and coffee that she was passing around.\r\n\r\n"I yeard you," proclaimed Betsy with mischievous inscrutable\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t," said Ninette defiantly, and taking a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n"Yas, I did, I yeard you," walking away.\r\n\r\n"See here, Betsy," cried Ninette recalling the girl, "you\'re not going\r\nto tell, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Dun know ef I isn\'t gwine tell. Dun know ef I isn\'t gwine tell Miss\r\nDuplan dis yere ver\' minute."\r\n\r\n"Oh Betsy," entreated Ninette, "I\'ll give you this dress if you don\'t.\r\nI don\'t want it any more."\r\n\r\nBetsy\'s eyes glowed, but she looked down unconcernedly at the pretty\r\ngown.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t spec it fit me. An\' you know Miss T\'r\xe8se ain\'t gwine let me go\r\nflyin\' roun\' wid my laigs stickin\' out dat away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let the ruffle down, Betsy," eagerly proposed Ninette.\r\n\r\n"Betsy!" called Th\xe9r\xe8se a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Yas, \'um--I ben waitin\' fu\' de cups."\r\n\r\nLucilla had made many an aspiration--many an "act" the while. This\r\nwhole evening of revelry, and now this last act of wicked conspiracy\r\nseemed to have tainted her soul with a breath of sin which she would\r\nnot feel wholly freed from, till she had cleansed her spirit in the\r\nwaters of absolution.\r\n\r\nThe party broke up at a late hour, though the Duplans had a long\r\ndistance to go, and, moreover, had to cross the high and turbid river\r\nto reach their carriage which had been left on the opposite bank,\r\nowing to the difficulty of the crossing.\r\n\r\nMr. Duplan took occasion of a moment aside to whisper to Hosmer with\r\nthe air of a connoisseur, "fine woman that Mrs. Worthington of yours."\r\n\r\nHosmer laughed at the jesting implication, whilst disclaiming it, and\r\nFanny looked moodily at them both, jealously wondering at the cause of\r\ntheir good humor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duplan, under the influence of a charming evening passed in such\r\nagreeable and distinguished company, was full of amiable bustle in\r\nleaving and had many pleasant parting words to say to each, in her\r\npretty broken English.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, ma\'am," said Mrs. Worthington to that lady, who had taken\r\nadmiring notice of the beautiful silver "Holy Angels" medal that hung\r\nfrom Lucilla\'s neck and rested against the dark gown. "Lucilla takes\r\nafter Mr. Worthington as far as religion goes--kind of different\r\nthough, for I must say it ain\'t often he darkens the doors of a\r\nchurch."\r\n\r\nMrs. Worthington always spoke of her husband present as of a husband\r\nabsent. A peculiarity which he patiently endured, having no talent for\r\nrepartee, that he had at one time thought of cultivating. But that\r\ntime was long past.\r\n\r\nThe Duplans were the first to leave. Then Th\xe9r\xe8se stood for a while on\r\nthe veranda in the chill night air watching the others disappear\r\nacross the lawn. Mr. and Mrs. Worthington and Lucilla had all shaken\r\nhands with her in saying good night. Fanny followed suit limply and\r\ngrudgingly. Hosmer buttoned his coat impatiently and only lifted his\r\nhat to Th\xe9r\xe8se as he helped his wife down the stairs.\r\n\r\nPoor Fanny! she had already taken exception at that hand pressure\r\nwhich was to come and for which she watched, and now her whole small\r\nbeing was in a jealous turmoil--because there had been none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTidings That Sting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se felt that the room was growing oppressive. She had been\r\nsitting all morning alone before the fire, passing in review a great\r\nheap of household linen that lay piled beside her on the floor,\r\nalternating this occupation with occasional careful and tender offices\r\nbestowed upon a wee lamb that had been brought to her some hours\r\nbefore, and that now lay wounded and half lifeless upon a pile of\r\ncoffee sacks before the blaze.\r\n\r\nA fire was hardly needed, except to dispel the dampness that had even\r\nmade its insistent way indoors, covering walls and furniture with a\r\nclammy film. Outside, the moisture was dripping from the glistening\r\nmagnolia leaves and from the pointed polished leaves of the live-oaks,\r\nand the sun that had come out with intense suddenness was drawing it\r\nsteaming from the shingled roof-tops.\r\n\r\nWhen Th\xe9r\xe8se, finally aware of the closeness of the room, opened the\r\ndoor and went out on the veranda, she saw a man, a stranger, riding\r\ntowards the house and she stood to await his approach. He belonged to\r\nwhat is rather indiscriminately known in that section of the State as\r\nthe "piney-woods" genus. A rawboned fellow, lank and long of leg; as\r\nungroomed with his scraggy yellow hair and beard as the scrubby little\r\nTexas pony which he rode. His big soft felt hat had done unreasonable\r\nservice as a head-piece; and the "store clothes" that hung upon his\r\nlean person could never in their remotest freshness have masqueraded\r\nunder the character of "all wool." He was in transit, as the bulging\r\nsaddle-bags that hung across his horse indicated, as well as the rough\r\nbrown blanket strapped behind him to the animal\'s back. He rode up\r\nclose to the rail of the veranda near which Th\xe9r\xe8se stood, and nodded\r\nto her without offering to raise or touch his hat. She was prepared\r\nfor the drawl with which he addressed her, and even guessed at what\r\nhis first words would be.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Mrs. Laferm I \'low?"\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se acknowledged her identity with a bow.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Jimson; Rufe Jimson," he went on, settling himself on the\r\npony and folding his long knotty hands over the hickory switch that he\r\ncarried in guise of whip.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to speak to me? won\'t you dismount?" Th\xe9r\xe8se asked.\r\n\r\n"I hed my dinner down to the store," he said taking her proposal as an\r\ninvitation to dine, and turning to expectorate a mouth full of tobacco\r\njuice before continuing. "Capital sardines them air," passing his hand\r\nover his mouth and beard in unctuous remembrance of the oily dainties.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just from Cornstalk, Texas, on mu way to Grant. An\' them roads as\r\nI\'ve traversed isn\'t what I\'d call the best in a fair and square\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\nHis manner bore not the slightest mark of deference. He spoke to\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se as he might have spoken to one of her black servants, or as he\r\nwould have addressed a princess of royal blood if fate had ever\r\nbrought him into such unlikely contact, so clearly was the sense of\r\nhuman equality native to him.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se knew her animal, and waited patiently for his business to\r\nunfold itself.\r\n\r\n"I reckon thar hain\'t no ford hereabouts?" he asked, looking at her\r\nwith a certain challenge.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; its even difficult crossing in the flat," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Wall, I hed calc\'lated continooing on this near side. Reckon I could\r\nmake it?" challenging her again to an answer.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no road on this side," she said, turning away to fasten more\r\nsecurely the escaped branches of a rose-bush that twined about a\r\ncolumn near which she stood.\r\n\r\nWhether there were a road on this side or on the other side, or no\r\nroad at all, appeared to be matter of equal indifference to Mr.\r\nJimson, so far as his manner showed. He continued imperturbably "I\r\n\'lowed to stop here on a little matter o\' business. \'Tis some out o\'\r\nmu way; more\'n I\'d calc\'lated. You couldn\'t tell the ixact distance\r\nfrom here to Colfax, could you?"\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se rather impatiently gave him the desired information, and\r\nbegged that he would disclose his business with her.\r\n\r\n"Wall," he said, "onpleasant news \'ll keep most times tell you\'re\r\nready fur it. Thet\'s my way o\' lookin\' at it."\r\n\r\n"Unpleasant news for me?" she inquired, startled from her indifference\r\nand listlessness.\r\n\r\n"Rather onpleasant ez I take it. I hain\'t a makin\' no misstatement to\r\npersume thet Gr\xe9gor Sanchun was your nephew?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," responded Th\xe9r\xe8se, now thoroughly alarmed, and approaching\r\nas close to Mr. Rufe Jimson as the dividing rail would permit, "What\r\nof him, please?"\r\n\r\nHe turned again to discharge an accumulation of tobacco juice into a\r\nthick border of violets, and resumed.\r\n\r\n"You see a hot-blooded young feller, ez wouldn\'t take no more \'an give\r\nno odds, stranger or no stranger in the town, he couldn\'t ixpect civil\r\ntreatment; leastways not from Colonel Bill Klayton. Ez I said to\r\nTozier--"\r\n\r\n"Please tell me as quickly as possible what has happened," demanded\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se with trembling eagerness; steadying herself with both hands on\r\nthe railing before her.\r\n\r\n"You see it all riz out o\' a little altercation \'twixt him and Colonel\r\nKlayton in the colonel\'s store. Some says he\'d ben drinkin\'; others\r\ndenies it. Howsomever they did hev words risin\' out o\' the colonel\r\naddressing your nephew under the title o\' \'Frenchy\'; which most takes\r\nez a insufficient cause for rilin\'."\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead?" gasped Th\xe9r\xe8se, looking at the dispassionate Texan with\r\nhorrified eyes.\r\n\r\n"Wall, yes," an admission which he seemed not yet willing to leave\r\nunqualified; for he went on "It don\'t do to alluz speak out open an\'\r\nabove boards, leastways not thar in Cornstalk. But I\'ll \'low to you,\r\nit\'s my opinion the colonel acted hasty. It\'s true \'nough, the young\r\nfeller hed drawed, but ez I said to Tozier, thet\'s no reason to\r\npersume it was his intention to use his gun."\r\n\r\nSo Gr\xe9goire was dead. She understood it all now. The manner of his\r\ndeath was plain to her as if she had seen it, out there in some\r\ndisorderly settlement. Killed by the hand of a stranger with whom\r\nperhaps the taking of a man\'s life counted as little as it had once\r\ncounted with his victim. This flood of sudden and painful intelligence\r\nstaggered her, and leaning against the column she covered her eyes\r\nwith both hands, for a while forgetting the presence of the man who\r\nhad brought the sad tidings.\r\n\r\nBut he had never ceased his monotonous unwinding. "Thar hain\'t no\r\nmanner o\' doubt, marm," he was saying, "thet he did hev the sympathy\r\no\' the intire community--ez far ez they was free to express\r\nit--barrin\' a few. Fur he was a likely young chap, that warn\'t no two\r\nopinions o\' that. Free with his money--alluz ready to set up fur a\r\nfriend. Here\'s a bit o\' writin\' thet\'ll larn you more o\' the\r\npertic\'lars," drawing a letter from his pocket, "writ by the Catholic\r\npriest, by name of O\'Dowd. He \'lowed you mought want proyer meetin\'s\r\nand sich."\r\n\r\n"Masses," corrected Th\xe9r\xe8se, holding out her hand for the letter. With\r\nthe other hand she was wiping away the tears that had gathered thick\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Thar\'s a couple more little tricks thet he sont," continued Rufe\r\nJimson, apparently dislocating his joints to reach the depths of his\r\ntrouser pocket, from which he drew a battered pocket book wrapped\r\naround with an infinity of string. From the grimy folds of this\r\nreceptacle he took a small paper parcel which he placed in her hand.\r\nIt was partly unfastened, and as she opened it fully, the pent-up\r\ntears came blindingly--for before her lay a few curling rings of soft\r\nbrown hair, and a pair of scapulars, one of which was pierced by a\r\ntell-tale bullet hole.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you dismount?" she presently asked again, this time a little\r\nmore kindly.\r\n\r\n"No, marm," said the Texan, jerking his hitherto patient pony by the\r\nbridle till it performed feats of which an impartial observer could\r\nscarcely have suspected it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t reckon I could make Colfax before dark, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," she said, turning away, "I\'m much obliged to you, Mr.\r\nJimson, for having taken this trouble--if the flat is on the other\r\nside, you need only call for it."\r\n\r\n"Wall, good day, marm--I wish you luck," he added, with a touch of\r\ngallantry which her tears and sweet feminine presence had inspired.\r\nThen turning, he loped his horse rapidly forward, leaning well back in\r\nthe saddle and his elbows sawing the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nMelicent Hears the News.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was talked about and wept about at Place-du-Bois, that Gr\xe9goire\r\nshould be dead. It seemed to them all so unbelievable. Yet, whatever\r\nhesitancy they had in accepting the fact of his death, was perforce\r\nremoved by the convincing proof of Father O\'Dowd\'s letter.\r\n\r\nNone could remember but sweetness and kindness of him. Even Nathan,\r\nwho had been one day felled to earth by a crowbar in Gr\xe9goire\'s hand,\r\nhad come himself to look at that deed as not altogether blamable in\r\nlight of the provocation that had called it forth.\r\n\r\nFanny remembered those bouquets which had been daily offered to her\r\nforlornness at her arrival; and the conversations in which they had\r\nunderstood each other so well. The conviction that he was gone away\r\nbeyond the possibility of knowing him further, moved her to tears.\r\nHosmer, too, was grieved and shocked, without being able to view the\r\nevent in the light of a calamity.\r\n\r\nNo one was left unmoved by the tidings which brought a lowering cloud\r\neven upon the brow of Aunt Belindy, to rest there the whole day. Deep\r\nwere the mutterings she hurled at a fate that could have been so\r\nshort-sighted as to remove from earth so bright an ornament as\r\nGr\xe9goire. Her grief further spent much of itself upon the inoffensive\r\nBetsy, who, for some inscrutable reason was for twenty-four hours\r\ndebarred entrance to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se seated at her desk, devoted a morning to the writing of\r\nletters, acquainting various members of the family with the unhappy\r\nintelligence. She wrote first to Madame Santien, living now her lazy\r\nlife in Paris, with eyes closed to the duties that lay before her and\r\nheart choked up with an egoism that withered even the mother\r\ninstincts. It was very difficult to withhold the reproach which she\r\nfelt inclined to deal her; hard to refrain from upbraiding a\r\nselfishness which for a life-time had appeared to Th\xe9r\xe8se as criminal.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter less nice, less difficult, to write to the\r\nbrothers--one up on the Red River plantation living as best he could;\r\nthe other idling on the New Orleans streets. But it was after all a\r\nshort and simple story to tell. There was no lingering illness to\r\ndescribe; no moment even of consciousness in which harrowing last\r\nwords were to be gathered and recorded. Only a hot senseless quarrel\r\nto be told about; the speeding of a bullet with very sure aim,\r\nand--quick death.\r\n\r\nOf course, masses must be said. Father O\'Dowd was properly instructed.\r\nP\xe8re Antoine in Centerville was addressed on the subject. The Bishop\r\nof Natchitoches, respectfully asked to perform this last sad office\r\nfor the departed soul. And the good old priest and friend at the New\r\nOrleans Cathedral, was informed of her desires. Not that Th\xe9r\xe8se held\r\nvery strongly to this saying of masses for the dead; but it had been a\r\ncustom holding for generations in the family and which she was not\r\ndisposed to abandon now, even if she had thought of it.\r\n\r\nThe last letter was sent to Melicent. Th\xe9r\xe8se made it purposely short\r\nand pointed, with a bare statement of facts--a dry, unemotional\r\ntelling, that sounded heartless when she read it over; but she let it\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelicent was standing in her small, quaint sitting-room, her back to\r\nthe fire, and her hands clasped behind her. How handsome was this\r\nMelicent! Pouting now, and with eyes half covered by the dark shaded\r\nlids, as they gazed moodily out at the wild snowflakes that were\r\nhurrying like crazy things against the warm window pane and meeting\r\ntheir end there. A loose tea-gown clung in long folds about her. A\r\ndull colored thing, save for the two broad bands of sapphire plush\r\nhanging straight before, from throat to toe. Melicent was plainly\r\ndejected; not troubled, nor sad, only dejected, and very much bored; a\r\ncondition that had made her yawn several times while she looked at the\r\nfalling snow.\r\n\r\nShe was philosophizing a little. Wondering if the world this morning\r\nwere really the unpleasant place that it appeared, or if these\r\nconditions of unpleasantness lay not rather within her own mental\r\nvision; a train of thought that might be supposed to have furnished\r\nher some degree of entertainment had she continued in its pursuit. But\r\nshe chose rather to dwell on her causes of unhappiness, and thus\r\nconvince herself that that unhappiness was indeed outside of her and\r\naround her and not by any possibility to be avoided or circumvented.\r\nThere lay now a letter in her desk from David, filled with admonitions\r\nif not reproof which she felt to be not entirely unjust, on the\r\ndisagreeable subject of Expenses. Looking around the pretty room she\r\nconceded to herself that here had been temptations which she could not\r\nreasonably have been expected to withstand. The temptation to lodge\r\nherself in this charming little flat; furnish it after her own liking;\r\nand install that delightful little old poverty-stricken English woman\r\nas keeper of Proprieties, with her irresistible white starched caps\r\nand her altogether delightful way of inquiring daily after that "poor,\r\ndear, kind Mr. Hosmer." It had all cost a little more than she had\r\nforeseen. But the worst of it, the very worst of it was, that she had\r\nalready begun to ask herself if, for instance, it were not very\r\nirritating to see every day, that same branching palm, posing by the\r\nwindow, in that same yellow jardini\xe8re. If those draperies that\r\nconfronted her were not becoming positively offensive in the monotony\r\nof their solemn folds. If the cuteness and quaintness of the\r\npoverty-stricken little English woman were not after all a source of\r\nentertainment that she would willingly forego on occasion. The answer\r\nto these questions was a sigh that ended in another yawn.\r\n\r\nThen Melicent threw herself into a low easy chair by the table, took\r\nup her visiting book, and bending lazily with her arms resting on her\r\nknees, began to turn over its pages. The names which she saw there\r\nrecalled to her mind an entertainment at which she had assisted on the\r\nprevious afternoon. A progressive euchre party; and the remembrance of\r\nwhat she had there endured now filled her soul with horror.\r\n\r\nShe thought of those hundred cackling women--of course women are never\r\ncackling, it was Melicent\'s exaggerated way of expressing\r\nherself--packed into those small overheated rooms, around those\r\ntwenty-five little tables; and how by no chance had she once found\r\nherself with a congenial set. And how that Mrs. Van Wycke had cheated!\r\nIt was plain to Melicent that she had taken advantage of having fat\r\nMiss Bloomdale for a partner, who went to euchre parties only to show\r\nher hands and rings. And little Mrs. Brinke playing against her.\r\nLittle Mrs. Brinke! A woman who only the other day had read an\r\noriginal paper entitled: "An Hour with Hegel" before her philosophy\r\nclass; who had published that dry mystical affair "Light on the\r\nInscrutable in Dante." How could such a one by any possibility be\r\nsupposed to observe the disgusting action of Mrs. Van Wycke in\r\nthrowing off on her partner\'s trump and swooping down on the last\r\ntrick with her right bower? Melicent would have thought it beneath her\r\nto more than look her contempt as Mrs. Van Wycke rose with a\r\ntriumphant laugh to take her place at a higher table, dragging the\r\nplastic Bloomdale with her. But she did mutter to herself now, "nasty\r\nthief."\r\n\r\n"Johannah," Melicent called to her maid who sat sewing in the next\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss."\r\n\r\n"You know Mrs. Van Wycke?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Van Wycke, Miss? the lady with the pinted nose that I caught\r\na-feeling of the curtains?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, when she calls again I\'m not at home. Do you understand? not at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss."\r\n\r\nIt was gratifying enough to have thus summarily disposed of Mrs. Van\r\nWycke; but it was a source of entertainment which was soon ended.\r\nMelicent continued to turn over the pages of her visiting book during\r\nwhich employment she came to the conclusion that these people whom she\r\nfrequented were all very tiresome. All, all of them, except Miss Drake\r\nwho had been absent in Europe for the past six months. Perhaps Mrs.\r\nManning too, who was so seldom at home when Melicent called. Who when\r\nat home, usually rushed down with her bonnet on, breathless with "I\r\ncan only spare you a moment, dear. It\'s very sweet of you to come."\r\nShe was always just going to the "Home" where things had got into such\r\na muddle whilst she was away for a week. Or it was that "Hospital"\r\nmeeting where she thought certain members were secretly conniving at\r\nher removal from the presidency which she had held for so many years.\r\nShe was always reading minutes at assemblages which Melicent knew\r\nnothing about; or introducing distinguished guests to Guild room\r\nmeetings. Altogether Melicent saw very little of Mrs. Manning.\r\n\r\n"Johannah, don\'t you hear the bell?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss," said Johannah, coming into the room and depositing a gown\r\non which she had been working, on the back of a chair. "It\'s that\r\npostman," she said, as she fastened her needle to the bosom of her\r\ndress. "And such a one as he is, thinking that people must fly when he\r\nso much as touches the bell, and going off a writing of \'no answer to\r\nbell,\' and me with my hand on the very door-knob."\r\n\r\n"I notice that always happens when I\'m out, Johannah; he\'s ringing\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nIt was Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s letter, and as Melicent turned it about and looked\r\ncritically at the neatly written address, it was not without a hope\r\nthat the reading of it might furnish her a moment\'s diversion. She did\r\nnot faint. The letter did not "fall from her nerveless clasp." She\r\nrather held it very steadily. But she grew a shade paler and looked\r\nlong into the fire. When she had read it three times she folded it\r\nslowly and carefully and locked it away in her desk.\r\n\r\n"Johannah."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss."\r\n\r\n"Put that gown away; I shan\'t need it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss; and all the beautiful passmantry that you bought?"\r\n\r\n"It makes no difference, I shan\'t use it. What\'s become of that black\r\ncamel\'s-hair that Mrs. Gauche spoiled so last winter?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s laid away, Miss, the same in the cedar chest as the day it came\r\nhome from her hands and no more fit, that I\'d be a shame meself and no\r\nclaims to a dress-maker. And there\'s many a lady that she never would\r\nhave seen a cent, let alone making herself pay for the spiling of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Johannah, never mind. Get it out, we\'ll see what can be\r\ndone with it. I\'ve had some painful news, and I shall wear mourning\r\nfor a long, long time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss, it\'s not Mr. David! nor yet one of those sweet relations in\r\nUtica? leastways not I hope that beautiful Miss Gertrude, with such\r\nhair as I never see for the goldness of it and not dyed, except me\r\ncousin that\'s a nun, that her mother actually cried when it was cut\r\noff?"\r\n\r\n"No, Johannah; only a very dear friend."\r\n\r\nThere were a few social engagements to be cancelled; and regrets to be\r\nsent out, which she attended to immediately. Then she turned again to\r\nlook long into the fire. That crime for which she had scorned him, was\r\nwiped out now by expiation. For a long time--how long she could not\r\nyet determine--she would wrap herself in garb of mourning and move\r\nabout in sorrowing--giving evasive answer to the curious who\r\nquestioned her. Now might she live again through those summer months\r\nwith Gr\xe9goire--those golden afternoons in the pine woods--whose aroma\r\neven now came back to her. She might look again into his loving brown\r\neyes; feel beneath her touch the softness of his curls. She recalled a\r\nday when he had said, "Neva to see you--my God!" and how he had\r\ntrembled. She recalled--strangely enough and for the first time--that\r\none kiss, and a little tremor brought the hot color to her cheek.\r\n\r\nWas she in love with Gr\xe9goire now that he was dead? Perhaps. At all\r\nevents, for the next month, Melicent would not be bored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nA Step Too Far.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho of us has not known the presence of Misery? Perhaps as those\r\nfortunate ones whom he has but touched as he passed them by. It may be\r\nthat we see but a promise of him as we look into the prophetic faces\r\nof children; into the eyes of those we love, and the awfulness of\r\nlife\'s possibilities presses into our souls. Do we fly him? hearing\r\nhim gain upon us panting close at our heels, till we turn from the\r\ndesperation of uncertainty to grapple with him? In close scuffle we\r\nmay vanquish him. Fleeing, we may elude him. But what if he creep into\r\nthe sanctuary of our lives, with his subtle omnipresence, that we do\r\nnot see in all its horror till we are disarmed; thrusting the burden\r\nof his companionship upon us to the end! However we turn he is there.\r\nHowever we shrink he is there. However we come or go, or sleep or wake\r\nhe is before us. Till the keen sense grows dull with apathy at looking\r\non him, and he becomes like the familiar presence of sin.\r\n\r\nInto such callousness had Hosmer fallen. He had ceased to bruise his\r\nsoul in restless endeavor of resistance. When the awful presence bore\r\ntoo closely upon him, he would close his eyes and brave himself to\r\nendurance. Yet Fate might have dealt him worse things.\r\n\r\nBut a man\'s misery is after all his own, to make of it what he will or\r\nwhat he can. And shall we be fools, wanting to lighten it with our\r\nplatitudes?\r\n\r\nMy friend, your trouble I know weighs. That you should be driven by\r\nearthly needs to drag the pinioned spirit of your days through rut and\r\nmire. But think of the millions who are doing the like. Or is it your\r\nboy, that part of your own self and that other dearer self, who is\r\nwalking in evil ways? Why, I know a man whose son was hanged the other\r\nday; hanged on the gibbet; think of it. If you be quivering while the\r\nsurgeon cuts away that right arm, remember the poor devil in the\r\nhospital yesterday who had both his sawed off.\r\n\r\nOh, have done, with your mutilated men and your sons on gibbets! What\r\nare they to me? My hurt is greater than all, because it is my own. If\r\nit be only that day after day I must look with warm entreaty into eyes\r\nthat are cold. Let it be but that peculiar trick of feature which I\r\nhave come to hate, seen each morning across the breakfast table. That\r\nrecurrent pin-prick: it hurts. The blow that lays the heart in twain:\r\nit kills. Let be mine which will; it is the one that counts.\r\n\r\nIf Misery kill a man, that ends it. But Misery seldom deals so\r\nsummarily with his victims. And while they are spared to earth, we\r\nfind them usually sustaining life after the accepted fashion.\r\n\r\nHosmer was seated at table, having finished his breakfast. He had also\r\nfinished glancing over the contents of a small memorandum book, which\r\nhe replaced in his pocket. He then looked at his wife sitting opposite\r\nhim, but turned rather hastily to gaze with a certain entreaty into\r\nthe big kind eyes of the great shaggy dog who stood--the shameless\r\nbeggar--at his side.\r\n\r\n"I knew there was something wrong," he said abruptly, with his eyes\r\nstill fixed on the dog, and his fingers thrust into the animal\'s\r\nmatted wool, "Where\'s the mail this morning?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if that stupid boy\'s gone for it or not. I told him. You\r\ncan\'t depend on any one in a place like this."\r\n\r\nFanny had scarcely touched the breakfast before her, and now pushed\r\naside her cup still half filled with coffee.\r\n\r\n"Why, how\'s that? Sampson seems to do the right thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sampson; but he ain\'t here. That boy of Minervy\'s been doing his\r\nwork all morning."\r\n\r\nMinervy\'s boy was even now making his appearance, carrying a good\r\nsized bundle of papers and letters, with which he walked boldly up to\r\nHosmer, plainly impressed with the importance of this new r\xf4le.\r\n\r\n"Well, colonel; so you\'ve taken Sampson\'s place?" Hosmer observed,\r\nreceiving the mail from the boy\'s little black paws.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Major, suh. Maje; dats my name. I ain\'t tuck Sampson\'s\r\nplace: no, suh."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s having a day off--" Hosmer went on, smiling quizzingly at\r\nthe dapper little darkey, and handing him a red apple from the dish of\r\nfruit standing in the center of the table. Maje received it with a\r\nvery unmilitary bob of acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n"He yonda home \'cross de riva, suh. He ben too late fu\' kotch de\r\nflat\'s mornin\' An\' he holla an\' holla. He know dey warn\'t gwine cross\r\ndat flat \'gin jis\' fu\' Sampson."\r\n\r\nHosmer had commenced to open his letters. Fanny with her elbows on the\r\ntable, asked the boy--with a certain uneasiness in her voice--"Ain\'t\r\nhe coming at all to-day? Don\'t he know all the work he\'s got to do?\r\nHis mother ought to make him."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t reckon. Dat away Sampson: he git mad he stay mad," with which\r\nassurance Maje vanished through the rear door, towards the region of\r\nthe kitchen, to seek more substantial condiments than the apple which\r\nhe still clutched firmly.\r\n\r\nOne of the letters was for Fanny, which her husband handed her. When\r\nhe had finished reading his own, he seemed disposed to linger, for he\r\ntook from the fruit dish the mate to the red apple he had given Maje,\r\nand commenced to peel it with his clasp knife.\r\n\r\n"What has our friend Belle Worthington to say for herself?" he\r\ninquired good humoredly. "How does she get on with those Creoles down\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"You know as well as I do, Belle Worthington ain\'t going to mix with\r\nCreoles. She can\'t talk French if she wanted to. She says Muddy-Graw\r\ndon\'t begin to compare with the Veiled Prophets. It\'s just what I\r\nthought--with their \'Muddy-Graw,\'\xa0" Fanny added, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Coming from such high authority, we\'ll consider that verdict a final\r\nclincher," Hosmer laughed a little provokingly.\r\n\r\nFanny was looking again through the several sheets of Belle\r\nWorthington\'s letter. "She says if I\'ll agree to go back with her,\r\nshe\'ll pass this way again."\r\n\r\n"Well, why don\'t you? A little change wouldn\'t hurt."\r\n\r\n"\xa0\'Tain\'t because I want to stay here, Lord knows. A God-forsaken\r\nplace like this. I guess you\'d be glad enough," she added, with voice\r\nshaking a little at her own boldness.\r\n\r\nHe closed his knife, placed it in his pocket, and looked at his wife,\r\ncompletely puzzled.\r\n\r\nThe power of speech had come to her, for she went on, in an unnatural\r\ntone, however, and fumbling nervously with the dishes before her. "I\'m\r\nfool enough about some things, but I ain\'t quite such a fool as that."\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about, Fanny?"\r\n\r\n"That woman wouldn\'t ask anything better than for me to go to St.\r\nLouis."\r\n\r\nHosmer was utterly amazed. He leaned his arms on the table, clasping\r\nhis hands together and looked at his wife.\r\n\r\n"That woman? Belle Worthington? What _do_ you mean, any way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean Belle Worthington," she said excitedly, with two deep\r\nred spots in her cheeks. "I\'m talking about Mrs. Laferm."\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into his pockets and leaned back in his chair. No\r\namazement now, but very pale, and with terrible concentration of\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, don\'t talk about Mrs. Lafirme," he said very slowly, not\r\ntaking his eyes from her face.\r\n\r\n"I will talk about her, too. She ain\'t worth talking about," she\r\nblurted incoherently. "It\'s time for somebody to talk about a woman\r\npassing herself off for a saint, and trying to take other women\'s\r\nhusbands--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" cried Hosmer maddened with sudden fury, and rising\r\nviolently from his chair.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t shut up," Fanny cried excitedly back at him; rising also.\r\n"And what\'s more I won\'t stay here and have you making love under my\r\nvery eyes to a woman that\'s no better than she ought to be."\r\n\r\nShe meant to say more, but Hosmer grasped her arm with such a grasp,\r\nthat had it been her throat she would never have spoken more. The\r\nother hand went to his pocket, with fingers clutching the clasp knife\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"By heaven--I\'ll--kill you!" every word weighted with murder, panted\r\nclose in her terrified face. What she would have uttered died upon her\r\npale lips, when her frightened eyes beheld the usually calm face of\r\nher husband distorted by a passion of which she had not dreamed.\r\n\r\n"David," she faltered, "let go my arm."\r\n\r\nHer voice broke the spell that held him, and brought him again to his\r\nsenses. His fingers slowly relaxed their tense hold. A sigh that was\r\nsomething between a moan and a gasp came with his deliverance and\r\nshook him. All the horror now was in his own face as he seized his hat\r\nand hurried speechless away.\r\n\r\nFanny remained for a little while dazed. Hers was not the fine nature\r\nthat would stay cruelly stunned after such a scene. Her immediate\r\nterror being past, the strongest resultant emotion was one of\r\nself-satisfaction at having spoken out her mind.\r\n\r\nBut there was a stronger feeling yet, moving and possessing her;\r\ncrowding out every other. A pressing want that only Sampson\'s coming\r\nwould relieve, and which bade fair to drive her to any extremity if it\r\nwere not appeased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nA Fateful Solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nHosmer passed the day with a great pain at his heart. His hasty and\r\nviolent passion of the morning had added another weight for his spirit\r\nto drag about, and which he could not cast off. No feeling of\r\nresentment remained with him; only wonder at his wife\'s misshapen\r\nknowledge and keen self-rebuke of his own momentary forgetfulness.\r\nEven knowing Fanny as he did, he could not rid himself of the haunting\r\ndread of having wounded her nature cruelly. He felt much as a man who\r\nin a moment of anger inflicts an irreparable hurt upon some small,\r\nweak, irresponsible creature, and must bear regret for his madness.\r\nThe only reparation that lay within his power--true, one that seemed\r\ninadequate--was an open and manly apology and confession of wrong. He\r\nwould feel better when it was made. He would perhaps find relief in\r\ndiscovering that the wound he had inflicted was not so deep--so\r\ndangerous as he feared.\r\n\r\nWith such end in view he came home early in the afternoon. His wife\r\nwas not there. The house was deserted. Even the servants had\r\ndisappeared. It took but a moment for him to search the various rooms\r\nand find them one after the other, unoccupied. He went out on the\r\nporch and looked around. The raw air chilled him. The wind was blowing\r\nviolently, bringing dashes of rain along with it from massed clouds\r\nthat hung leaden between sky and earth. Could she have gone over to\r\nthe house? It was unlikely, for he knew her to have avoided Mrs.\r\nLafirme of late, with a persistence that had puzzled him to seek its\r\ncause, which had only fully revealed itself in the morning Yet, where\r\nelse could she be? An undefined terror was laying hold of him. His\r\nsensitive nature, in exaggerating its own heartlessness, was blindly\r\noverestimating the delicacy of hers. To what may he not have driven\r\nher? What hitherto untouched chord may he not have started into\r\npainful quivering? Was it for him to gauge the endurance of a woman\'s\r\nspirit? Fanny was not now the wife whom he hated; his own act of the\r\nmorning had changed her into the human being, the weak creature whom\r\nhe had wronged.\r\n\r\nIn quitting the house she must have gone unprepared for the inclement\r\nweather, for there hung her heavy wrap in its accustomed place, with\r\nher umbrella beside it. He seized both and buttoning his own great\r\ncoat about him, hurried away and over to Mrs. Lafirme\'s. He found that\r\nlady in the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Fanny here?" he asked abruptly, with no word of greeting.\r\n\r\n"No," she answered looking up at him, and seeing the evident\r\nuneasiness in his face. "Isn\'t she at home? Is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, everything is wrong," he returned desperately, "But the immediate\r\nwrong is that she has disappeared--I must find her."\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se arose at once and called to Betsy who was occupied on the\r\nfront veranda.\r\n\r\n"Yas, um," the girl answered to her mistress\' enquiry. "I seed ma\'am\r\nHosma goin\' to\'ads de riva good hour \'go. She mus\' crost w\'en Nathan\r\ntuck dat load ova. I yain\'t seed \'er comin\' back yit."\r\n\r\nHosmer left the house hastily, hardly reassured by Betsy\'s\r\ninformation. Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s glance--speculating and uneasy--followed his\r\nhurrying figure till it disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nThe crossing was an affair of extreme difficulty, and which Nathan was\r\nreluctant to undertake until he should have gathered a "load" that\r\nwould justify him in making it. In his estimation, Hosmer did not meet\r\nsuch requirement, even taken in company with the solitary individual\r\nwho had been sitting on his horse with Egyptian patience for long\r\nunheeded moments, the rain beating down upon his back, while he waited\r\nthe ferryman\'s pleasure. But Nathan\'s determination was not proof\r\nagainst the substantial inducements which Hosmer held out to him; and\r\nsoon they were launched, all hands assisting in the toilsome passage.\r\n\r\nThe water, in rising to an unaccustomed height, had taken on an added\r\nand tremendous swiftness. The red turbid stream was eddying and\r\nbulging and hurrying with terrific swiftness between its shallow\r\nbanks, striking with an immensity of power against the projection of\r\nland on which stood Marie Louise\'s cabin, and rebounding in great\r\ncircling waves that spread and lost themselves in the seething\r\nturmoil. The cable used in crossing the unwieldly flat had long been\r\nsubmerged and the posts which held it wrenched from their fastenings.\r\nThe three men, each with his long heavy oar in hand began to pull up\r\nstream, using a force that brought the swelling veins like iron\r\ntracings upon their foreheads where the sweat had gathered as if the\r\nday were midsummer. They made their toilsome way by slow inches, that\r\nfinally landed them breathless and exhausted on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been the inducement to call Fanny out on such a day\r\nand such a venture? The answer came only too readily from Hosmer\'s\r\nreproaching conscience. And now, where to seek her? There was nothing\r\nto guide him; to indicate the course she might have taken. The rain\r\nwas falling heavily and in gusts and through it he looked about at the\r\nsmall cabins standing dreary in their dismantled fields. Marie\r\nLouise\'s was the nearest at hand and towards it he directed his steps.\r\n\r\nThe big good-natured negress had seen his approach from the window,\r\nfor she opened the door to him before he had time to knock, and\r\nentering he saw Fanny seated before the fire holding a pair of very\r\nwet smoking feet to dry. His first sensation was one of relief at\r\nfinding her safe and housed. His next, one of uncertainty as to the\r\nkind and degree of resentment which he felt confident must now show\r\nitself. But this last was soon dispelled, for turning, she greeted him\r\nwith a laugh. He would have rather a blow. That laugh said so many\r\nthings--too many things. True, it removed the dread which had been\r\nhaunting him all day, but it shattered what seemed to have been now\r\nhis last illusion regarding this woman. That unsounded chord which he\r\nfeared he had touched was after all but one in harmony with the rest\r\nof her common nature. He saw too at a glance that her dominant passion\r\nhad been leading and now controlled her. And by one of those rapid\r\ntrains of thought in which odd and detached fancies, facts,\r\nimpressions and observations form themselves into an orderly sequence\r\nleading to a final conviction--all was made plain to him that before\r\nhad puzzled him. She need not have told him her reason for crossing\r\nthe river, he knew it. He dismissed at once the attitude with which he\r\nhad thought to approach her. Here was no forgiveness to be asked of\r\ndulled senses. No bending in expiation of faults committed. He was\r\nhere as master.\r\n\r\n"Fanny, what does this mean?" he asked in cold anger; with no heat\r\nnow, no passion.\r\n\r\n"Yaas, me tell madame, she goin\' fur ketch cole si she don\' mine out.\r\nDat not fur play dat kine wedder, no. Teck chair, M\'sieur; dry\r\nyou\'se\'f leet beet. Me mek you one cup coffee."\r\n\r\nHosmer declined the good Marie Louise\'s kind proffer of coffee, but he\r\nseated himself and waited for Fanny to speak.\r\n\r\n"You know if you want a thing done in this place, you\'ve got to do it\r\nyourself. I\'ve heard you say it myself, time and time again about\r\nthose people at the mill," she said.\r\n\r\n"Could it have been so urgent as to call you out on a day like this,\r\nand with such a perilous crossing? Couldn\'t you have found some one\r\nelse to come for you?"\r\n\r\n"Who? I\'d like to know. Just tell me who? It\'s nothing to you if we\'re\r\nwithout servants, but I\'m not going to stand it. I ain\'t going to let\r\nSamp_son_ act like that without knowing what he means," said Fanny\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n"Dat Samp_son_, he one leet dev\'," proffered Marie Louise, with\r\nlaudable design of shifting blame upon the easy shoulders of Sampson,\r\nin event of the domestic jar which she anticipated. "No use try do\r\nnuttin\' \'id Sampson, M\'sieur."\r\n\r\n"I had to know something, one way or the other," Fanny said in a tone\r\nwhich carried apology, rather by courtesy than by what she considered\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nHosmer walked to the window where he looked out upon the dreary,\r\ndesolate scene, little calculated to cheer him. The river was just\r\nbelow; and from this window he could gaze down upon the rushing\r\ncurrent as it swept around the bend further up and came striking\r\nagainst this projection with a force all its own. The rain was falling\r\nstill; steadily, blindingly, with wild clatter against the shingled\r\nroof so close above their heads. It coursed in little swift rivulets\r\ndown the furrows of the almost perpendicular banks. It mingled in a\r\ndemon dance with the dull, red water. There was something inviting to\r\nHosmer in the scene. He wanted to be outside there making a part of\r\nit. He wanted to feel that rain and wind beating upon him. Within, it\r\nwas stifling, maddening; with his wife\'s presence there, charging the\r\nroom with an atmosphere of hate that was possessing him and beginning\r\nto course through his veins as it had never done before.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to go home?" he asked bluntly, turning half around.\r\n\r\n"You must be crazy," she replied, with a slow, upward glance out the\r\nwindow, then down at her feet that were still poised on the low stool\r\nthat Marie Louise had placed for her.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better come." He could not have said what moved him, unless it\r\nwere recklessness and defiance.\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'re dreaming, or something, David. You go on home if you\r\nwant. Nobody asked you to come after me any way. I\'m able to take care\r\nof myself, I guess. Ain\'t you going to take the umbrella?" she added,\r\nseeing him start for the door empty handed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it doesn\'t matter about the rain," he answered without a look\r\nback as he went out and slammed the door after him.\r\n\r\n"M\'sieur look lak he not please," said Marie Louise, with plain regret\r\nat the turn of affairs. "You see he no lak you go out in dat kine\r\nwedder, me know dat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother," was Fanny\'s careless reply. "This suits me well enough;\r\nI don\'t care how long it lasts."\r\n\r\nShe was in Marie Louise\'s big rocker, balancing comfortably back and\r\nforth with a swing that had become automatic. She felt "good," as she\r\nwould have termed it herself; her visit to Sampson\'s hut having not\r\nbeen without results tending to that condition. The warmth of the room\r\nwas very agreeable in contrast to the bleakness of out-doors. She felt\r\nfree and moved to exercise a looseness of tongue with the amiable old\r\nnegress which was not common with her. The occurrences of the morning\r\nwere gradually withdrawing themselves into a distant perspective that\r\nleft her in the attitude of a spectator rather than that of an actor.\r\nAnd she laughed and talked with Marie Louise, and rocked, and rocked\r\nherself on into drowsiness.\r\n\r\nHosmer had no intention of returning home without his wife. He only\r\nwanted to be out under the sky; he wanted to breathe, to use his\r\nmuscles again. He would go and help cross the flat if need be; an\r\noccupation that promised him relief in physical effort. He joined\r\nNathan, whom he found standing under a big live-oak, disputing with an\r\nold colored woman who wanted to cross to get back to her family before\r\nsupper time.\r\n\r\n"You didn\' have no call to come ova in de fus\' place," he was saying\r\nto her, "you womens is alluz runnin\' back\'ards and for\'ards like\r\nskeard rabbit in de co\'n fiel\'."\r\n\r\n"I don\' stan\' no sich talk is dat f\'om you. Ef you kiant tin\' to yo\'\r\nbusiness o\' totin\' folks w\'en dey wants, you betta quit. You done\r\ncheat Mose out o\' de job, anyways; we all knows dat."\r\n\r\n"Mine out, woman, you gwine git hu\'t. Jis\' le\'me see Mose han\'le dat\r\n\'ar flat onct: Jis\' le\'me. He lan\' you down to de Mouf \'fo\' you knows\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you, Nathan," said Hosmer, looking at his watch, "say you\r\nwait a quarter of an hour and if no one else comes, we\'ll cross Aunt\r\nAgnes anyway."\r\n\r\n"Dat \'nudda t\'ing ef you wants to go back, suh."\r\n\r\nAunt Agnes was grumbling now at Hosmer\'s proposal that promised to\r\nkeep her another quarter of an hour from her expectant family, when a\r\nbig lumbering creaking wagon drove up, with its load of baled cotton\r\nall covered with tarpaulins.\r\n\r\n"Dah!" exclaimed Nathan at sight of the wagon, "ef I\'d \'a listened to\r\nyo\' jawin\'--what?"\r\n\r\n"Ef you\'d listen to me, you\'d \'tin\' to yo\' business betta \'an you\r\ndoes," replied Aunt Agnes, raising a very battered umbrella over her\r\ngrotesquely apparelled figure, as she stepped from under the shelter\r\nof the tree to take her place in the flat.\r\n\r\nBut she still met with obstacles, for the wagon must needs go first.\r\nWhen it had rolled heavily into place with much loud and needless\r\nswearing on the part of the driver who, being a white man, considered\r\nHosmer\'s presence no hindrance, they let go the chain, and once again\r\npulled out. The crossing was even more difficult now, owing to the\r\nextra weight of the wagon.\r\n\r\n"I guess you earn your money, Nathan," said Hosmer bending and\r\nquivering with the efforts he put forth.\r\n\r\n"Yas, suh, I does; an\' dis job\'s wuf mo\' \'an I gits fu\' it."\r\n\r\n"All de same you done lef\' off wurking crap sence you start it,"\r\nmumbled Aunt Agnes.\r\n\r\n"You gwine git hu\'t, woman; I done tole you dat; don\' wan\' listen,"\r\nreturned Nathan with halting breath.\r\n\r\n"Who gwine hu\'t me?"\r\n\r\nWhether from tardy gallantry or from pre-occupation with his arduous\r\nwork, Nathan offered no reply to this challenge, and his silence left\r\nAunt Agnes in possession of the field.\r\n\r\nThey were in full mid-stream. Hosmer and the teamster were in the fore\r\nend of the boat; Nathan in the rear, and Aunt Agnes standing in the\r\ncenter between the wagon and the protecting railing, against which she\r\nleaned her clasped hands that still upheld the semblance of umbrella.\r\n\r\nThe ill-mated horses stood motionless, letting fall their dejected\r\nheads with apathetic droop. The rain was dripping from their\r\nglistening coats, and making a great patter as it fell upon the\r\ntarpaulins covering the cotton bales.\r\n\r\nSuddenly came an exclamation: "Gret God!" from Aunt Agnes, so genuine\r\nin its amazement and dismay, that the three men with one accord looked\r\nquickly up at her, then at the point on which her terrified gaze was\r\nfixed. Almost on the instant of the woman\'s cry, was heard a shrill,\r\npiercing, feminine scream.\r\n\r\nWhat they saw was the section of land on which stood Marie Louise\'s\r\ncabin, undermined--broken away from the main body and gradually\r\ngliding into the water. It must have sunk with a first abrupt wrench,\r\nfor the brick chimney was shaken from its foundation, the smoke\r\nissuing in dense clouds from its shattered sides, the house toppling\r\nand the roof caving. For a moment Hosmer lost his senses. He could but\r\nlook, as if at some awful apparition that must soon pass from sight\r\nand leave him again in possession of his reason. The leaning house was\r\nhalf submerged when Fanny appeared at the door, like a figure in a\r\ndream; seeming a natural part of the awfulness of it. He only gazed\r\non. The two negroes uttered loud lamentations.\r\n\r\n"Pull with the current!" cried the teamster, first to regain his\r\npresence of mind. It had needed but this, to awaken Hosmer to the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"Leave off," he cried at Nathan, who was wringing his hands. "Take\r\nhold that oar or I\'ll throw you overboard." The trembling ashen negro\r\nobeyed on the instant.\r\n\r\n"Hold fast--for God\'s sake--hold fast!" he shouted to Fanny, who was\r\nclinging with swaying figure to the door post. Of Marie Louise there\r\nwas no sign.\r\n\r\nThe caved bank now remained fixed; but Hosmer knew that at any instant\r\nit was liable to disappear before his riveted gaze.\r\n\r\nHow heavy the flat was! And the horses had caught the contagion of\r\nterror and were plunging madly.\r\n\r\n"Whip those horses and their load into the river," called Hosmer,\r\n"we\'ve got to lighten at any price."\r\n\r\n"Them horses an\' cotton\'s worth money," interposed the alarmed\r\nteamster.\r\n\r\n"Force them into the river, I say; I\'ll pay you twice their value."\r\n\r\n"You \'low to pay fur the cotton, too?"\r\n\r\n"Into the river with them or I\'ll brain you!" he cried, maddened at\r\nthe weight and delay that were holding them back.\r\n\r\nThe frightened animals seemed to ask nothing more than to plunge into\r\nthe troubled water; dragging their load with them.\r\n\r\nThey were speeding rapidly towards the scene of catastrophe; but to\r\nHosmer they crawled--the moments were hours. "Hold on! hold fast!" he\r\ncalled again and again to his wife. But even as he cried out, the\r\ndetached section of earth swayed, lurched to one side--plunged to the\r\nother, and the whole mass was submerged--leaving the water above it in\r\nwild agitation.\r\n\r\nA cry of horror went up from the spectators--all but Hosmer. He cast\r\naside his oar--threw off his coat and hat; worked an instant without\r\navail at his wet clinging boots, and with a leap was in the water,\r\nswimming towards the spot where the cabin had gone down. The current\r\nbore him on without much effort of his own. The flat was close up with\r\nhim; but he could think of it no longer as a means of rescue. Detached\r\npieces of timber from the ruined house were beginning to rise to the\r\nsurface. Then something floating softly on the water: a woman\'s dress,\r\nbut too far for him to reach it.\r\n\r\nWhen Fanny appeared again, Hosmer was close beside her. His left arm\r\nwas quickly thrown about her. She was insensible, and he remembered\r\nthat it was best so, for had she been in possession of her reason, she\r\nmight have struggled and impeded his movements. He held her\r\nfast--close to him and turned to regain the shore. Another horrified\r\nshriek went up from the occupants of the flat-boat not far away, and\r\nHosmer knew no more--for a great plunging beam struck him full upon\r\nthe forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen consciousness came back to him, he found that he lay extended in\r\nthe flat, which was fastened to the shore. The confused sound of many\r\nvoices mingled with a ringing din that filled his ears. A warm stream\r\nwas trickling down over his cheek. Another body lay beside him. Now\r\nthey were lifting him. Th\xe9r\xe8se\'s face was somewhere--very near, he saw\r\nit dimly and that it was white--and he fell again into insensibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTo Him Who Waits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with the spring and all its promises. Full with the\r\nsound of it, the smell of it, the deliciousness of it. Such sweet air;\r\nsoft and strong, like the touch of a brave woman\'s hand. The air of an\r\nearly March day in New Orleans. It was folly to shut it out from nook\r\nor cranny. Worse than folly the lady thought who was making futile\r\nendeavors to open the car window near which she sat. Her face had\r\ngrown pink with the effort. She had bit firmly into her red nether\r\nlip, making it all the redder; and then sat down from the\r\nunaccomplished feat to look ruefully at the smirched finger tips of\r\nher Parisian gloves. This flavor of Paris was well about her; in the\r\nfolds of her graceful wrap that set to her fine shoulders. It was\r\nplainly a part of the little black velvet toque that rested on her\r\nblonde hair. Even the umbrella and one small valise which she had just\r\nlaid on the seat opposite her, had Paris written plain upon them.\r\n\r\nThese were impressions which the little grey-garbed conventional\r\nfigure, some seats removed, had been noting since the striking lady\r\nhad entered the car. Points likely to have escaped a man, who--unless\r\na minutely observant one,--would only have seen that she was handsome\r\nand worthy of an admiration that he might easily fancy rising to\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nBeside herself and the little grey-garbed figure was an interesting\r\nfamily group at the far end of the car. A husband, but doubly a\r\nfather, surrounded and sat upon by a small band of offspring. A\r\nwife--presumably a mother--absorbed with the view of the outside world\r\nand the elaborate gold chain that hung around her neck.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large valise, an overcoat, a cane and an umbrella\r\ndisposed on another seat, bespoke a further occupant, likely to be at\r\npresent in the smoking car.\r\n\r\nThe train pushed out from the dep\xf4t. The porter finally made tardy\r\nhaste to the assistance of the lady who had been attempting to open\r\nthe window, and when the fresh morning air came blowing in upon her\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se leaned back in her seat with a sigh of content.\r\n\r\nThere was a full day\'s journey before her. She would not reach\r\nPlace-du-Bois before dark, but she did not shrink from those hours\r\nthat were to be passed alone. She rather welcomed the quiet of them\r\nafter a visit to New Orleans full of pleasant disturbances. She was\r\neager to be home again. She loved Place-du-Bois with a love that was\r\nreal; that had grown deep since it was the one place in the world\r\nwhich she could connect with the presence of David Hosmer. She had\r\noften wondered--indeed was wondering now--if the memory of those\r\nhappenings to which he belonged would ever grow strange and far away\r\nto her. It was a trick of memory with which she indulged herself on\r\noccasion, this one of retrospection. Beginning with that June day when\r\nshe had sat in the hall and watched the course of a white sunshade\r\nover the tops of the bending corn.\r\n\r\nSuch idle thoughts they were with their mingling of bitter and\r\nsweet--leading nowhere. But she clung to them and held to them as if\r\nto a refuge which she might again and again return to.\r\n\r\nThe picture of that one terrible day of Fanny\'s death, stood out in\r\nsharp prominent lines; a touch of the old agony always coming back as\r\nshe remembered how she had believed Hosmer dead too--lying so pale and\r\nbleeding before her. Then the parting which had held not so much of\r\nsorrow as of awe and bewilderment in it: when sick, wounded and broken\r\nhe had gone away at once with the dead body of his wife; when the two\r\nhad clasped hands without words that dared be uttered.\r\n\r\nBut that was a year ago. And Th\xe9r\xe8se thought many things might come\r\nabout in a year. Anyhow, might not such length of time be hoped to rub\r\nthe edge off a pain that was not by its nature lasting?\r\n\r\nThat time of acute trouble seemed to have thrown Hosmer back upon his\r\nold diffidence. The letter he wrote her after a painful illness which\r\nprostrated him on his arrival in St. Louis, was stiff and formal, as\r\nmen\'s letters are apt to be, though it had breathed an untold story of\r\nloyalty which she had felt at the time, and still cherished. Other\r\nletters--a few--had gone back and forth between them, till Hosmer had\r\ngone away to the sea-shore with Melicent, to recuperate, and June\r\ncoming, Th\xe9r\xe8se had sailed from New Orleans for Paris, whither she had\r\npassed six months.\r\n\r\nThings had not gone well at Place-du-Bois during her absence, the\r\nimpecunious old kinsman whom she had left in charge, having a decided\r\npreference for hunting the _Gros-Bec_ and catching trout in the lake\r\nto supervising the methods of a troublesome body of blacks. So Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\nhad had much to engage her thoughts from the morbid channel into which\r\nthose of a more idle woman might have drifted.\r\n\r\nShe went occasionally enough to the mill. There at least she was\r\nalways sure to hear Hosmer\'s name--and what a charm the sound of it\r\nhad for her. And what a delight it was to her eyes when she caught\r\nsight of an envelope lying somewhere on desk or table of the office,\r\naddressed in his handwriting. That was a weakness which she could not\r\npardon herself; but which staid with her, seeing that the same\r\ntrifling cause never failed to awaken the same unmeasured delight. She\r\nhad even trumped up an excuse one day for carrying off one of Hosmer\'s\r\nbusiness letters--indeed of the dryest in substance, and which, when\r\nhalf-way home, she had torn into the smallest bits and scattered to\r\nthe winds, so overcome was she by a sense of her own absurdity.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se had undergone the ordeal of having her ticket scrutinized,\r\ncommented upon and properly punched by the suave conductor. The little\r\nconventional figure had given over the contemplation of Parisian\r\nstyles and betaken herself to the absorbing pages of a novel which she\r\nread through smoked glasses. The husband and father had peeled and\r\ndistributed his second outlay of bananas amongst his family. It was at\r\nthis moment that Th\xe9r\xe8se, looking towards the door, saw Hosmer enter\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\nShe must have felt his presence somewhere near; his being there and\r\ncoming towards her was so much a part of her thoughts. She held out\r\nher hand to him and made place beside her, as if he had left her but a\r\nhalf hour before. All the astonishment was his. But he pressed her\r\nhand and took the seat she offered him.\r\n\r\n"You knew I was on the train?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, how should I?"\r\n\r\nThen naturally followed question and answer.\r\n\r\nYes, he was going to Place-du-Bois.\r\n\r\nNo, the mill did not require his presence; it had been very well\r\nmanaged during his absence.\r\n\r\nYes, she had been to New Orleans. Had had a very agreeable visit.\r\nBeautiful weather for city dwellers. But such dryness. So disastrous\r\nto the planters.\r\n\r\nYes--quite likely there would be rain next month: there usually was in\r\nApril. But indeed there was need of more than April showers for that\r\nstiff land--that strip along the bayou, if he remembered? Oh, he\r\nremembered quite well, but for all that he did not know what she was\r\ntalking about. She did not know herself. Then they grew silent; not\r\nfrom any feeling of the absurdity of such speech between them, for\r\neach had but listened to the other\'s voice. They became silently\r\nabsorbed by the consciousness of each other\'s nearness. She was\r\nlooking at his hand that rested on his knee, and thinking it fuller\r\nthan she remembered it before. She was aware of some change in him\r\nwhich she had not the opportunity to define; but this firmness and\r\nfullness of the hand was part of it. She looked up into his face then,\r\nto find the same change there, together with a new content. But what\r\nshe noted beside was the dull scar on his forehead, coming out like a\r\nred letter when his eyes looked into her own. The sight of it was like\r\na hurt. She had forgotten it might be there, telling its story of pain\r\nthrough the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n"Th\xe9r\xe8se," Hosmer said finally, "won\'t you look at me?"\r\n\r\nShe was looking from the window. She did not turn her head, but her\r\nhand went out and met his that was on the seat close beside her. He\r\nheld it firmly; but soon with an impatient movement drew down the\r\nloose wristlet of her glove and clasped his fingers around her warm\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n"Th\xe9r\xe8se," he said again; but more unsteadily, "look at me."\r\n\r\n"Not here," she answered him, "not now, I mean." And presently she\r\ndrew her hand away from him and held it for a moment pressed firmly\r\nover her eyes. Then she looked at him with brave loving glance.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been so long," she said, with the suspicion of a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Too long," he returned, "I couldn\'t have borne it but for you--the\r\nthought of you always present with me; helping me to take myself out\r\nof the past. That was why I waited--till I could come to you free.\r\nHave you an idea, I wonder, how you have been a promise, and can be\r\nthe fulfillment of every good that life may give to a man?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t know," she said a little hopelessly, taking his hand\r\nagain, "I have seen myself at fault in following what seemed the only\r\nright. I feel as if there were no way to turn for the truth. Old\r\nsupports appear to be giving way beneath me. They were so secure\r\nbefore. It commenced, you remember--oh, you know when it must have\r\nbegun. But do you think, David, that it\'s right we should find our\r\nhappiness out of that past of pain and sin and trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Th\xe9r\xe8se," said Hosmer firmly, "the truth in its entirety isn\'t given\r\nto man to know--such knowledge, no doubt, would be beyond human\r\nendurance. But we make a step towards it, when we learn that there is\r\nrottenness and evil in the world, masquerading as right and\r\nmorality--when we learn to know the living spirit from the dead\r\nletter. I have not cared to stop in this struggle of life to question.\r\nYou, perhaps, wouldn\'t dare to alone. Together, dear one, we will work\r\nit out. Be sure there is a way--we may not find it in the end, but we\r\nwill at least have tried."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne month after their meeting on the train, Hosmer and Th\xe9r\xe8se had\r\ngone together to Centerville where they had been made one, as the\r\nsaying goes, by the good P\xe8re Antoine; and without more ado, had\r\ndriven back to Place-du-Bois: Mr. and Mrs. Hosmer. The event had\r\ncaused more than the proverbial nine days\' talk. Indeed, now, two\r\nmonths after, it was still the absorbing theme that occupied the\r\ndwellers of the parish: and such it promised to remain till supplanted\r\nby something of sufficient dignity and importance to usurp its place.\r\n\r\nBut of the opinions, favorable and other, that were being exchanged\r\nregarding them and their marriage, Hosmer and Th\xe9r\xe8se heard little and\r\nwould have cared less, so absorbed were they in the overmastering\r\nhappiness that was holding them in thralldom. They could not yet bring\r\nthemselves to look at it calmly--this happiness. Even the intoxication\r\nof it seemed a thing that promised to hold. Through love they had\r\nsought each other, and now the fulfillment of that love had brought\r\nmore than tenfold its promise to both. It was a royal love; a generous\r\nlove and a rich one in its revelation. It was a magician that had\r\ntouched life for them and changed it into a glory. In giving them to\r\neach other, it was moving them to the fullness of their own\r\ncapabilities. Much to do in two little months; but what cannot love\r\ndo?\r\n\r\n"Could it give a woman more than this?" Th\xe9r\xe8se was saying softly to\r\nherself. Her hands were clasped as in prayer and pressed together\r\nagainst her bosom. Her head bowed and her lips touching the\r\nintertwined fingers. She spoke of her own emotion; of a certain sweet\r\nturmoil that was stirring within her, as she stood out in the soft\r\nJune twilight waiting for her husband to come. Waiting to hear the new\r\nring in his voice that was like a song of joy. Waiting to see that new\r\nstrength and courage in his face, of whose significance she lost\r\nnothing. To see the new light that had come in his eyes with\r\nhappiness. All gifts which love had given her.\r\n\r\n"Well, at last," she said, going to the top of the steps to meet him\r\nwhen he came. Her welcome was in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"At last," he echoed, with a sigh of relief; pressing her hand which\r\nshe held out to him and raising it to his lips.\r\n\r\nHe did not let it go, but passed it through his arm, and together they\r\nturned to walk up and down the veranda.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t expect me at noon, did you?" he asked, looking down at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"No; you said you\'d be likely not to come; but I hoped for you all the\r\nsame. I thought you\'d manage it some way."\r\n\r\n"No," he answered her, laughing, "my efforts failed. I used even\r\nstrategy. Held out the temptation of your delightful Creole dishes and\r\nall that. Nothing was of any avail. They were all business and I had\r\nto be all business too, the whole day long. It was horribly stupid."\r\n\r\nShe pressed his arm significantly.\r\n\r\n"And do you think they will put all that money into the mill, David?\r\nInto the business?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it, dear. But they\'re shrewd fellows: didn\'t commit\r\nthemselves in any way. Yet I could see they were impressed. We rode\r\nfor hours through the woods this morning and they didn\'t leave a stick\r\nof timber unscrutinized. We were out on the lake, too, and they were\r\nlike ferrets into every cranny of the mill."\r\n\r\n"But won\'t that give you more to do?"\r\n\r\n"No, it will give me less: division of labor, don\'t you see? It will\r\ngive me more time to be with you."\r\n\r\n"And to help with the plantation," his wife suggested.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Madame Th\xe9r\xe8se," he laughed, "I\'ll not rob you of your\r\noccupation. I\'ll put no bungling hand into your concerns. I know a\r\nsound piece of timber when I see it; but I should hardly be able to\r\ntell a sample of Sea Island cotton from the veriest low middling."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s absurd, David. Do you know you\'re getting to talk such\r\nnonsense since we\'re married; you remind me sometimes of Melicent."\r\n\r\n"Of Melicent? Heaven forbid! Why, I have a letter from her," he said,\r\nfeeling in his breast pocket. "The size and substance of it have\r\nactually weighted my pocket the whole day."\r\n\r\n"Melicent talking weighty things? That\'s something new," said Th\xe9r\xe8se\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n"Is Melicent ever anything else than new?" he enquired.\r\n\r\nThey went and sat together on the bench at the corner of the veranda,\r\nwhere the fading Western light came over their shoulders. A quizzical\r\nsmile came into his eyes as he unfolded his sister\'s letter--with\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se still holding his arm and sitting very close to him.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, glancing over the first few pages--his wife\r\nfollowing--"she\'s given up her charming little flat and her quaint\r\nlittle English woman: concludes I was right about the expense, etc.,\r\netc. But here comes the gist of the matter," he said, reading from the\r\nletter--"\xa0\'I know you won\'t object to the trip, David, I have my heart\r\nso set on it. The expense will be trifling, seeing there are four of\r\nus to divide carriage hire, restaurant and all that: and it counts.\r\n\r\n"\xa0\'If you only knew Mrs. Griesmann I\'d feel confident of your consent.\r\nYou\'d be perfectly fascinated with her. She\'s one of those highly\r\ngifted women who knows everything. She\'s very much interested in me.\r\nThinks to have found that I have a quick comprehensive intellectualism\r\n(she calls it) that has been misdirected. I think there is something\r\nin that, David; you know yourself I never did care really for society.\r\nShe says it\'s impossible to ever come to a true knowledge of life as\r\nit is--which should be every one\'s aim--without studying certain\r\nfundamental truths and things.\'\xa0"\r\n\r\n"Oh," breathed Th\xe9r\xe8se, overawed.\r\n\r\n"But wait--but listen," said Hosmer, "\xa0\'Natural History and all\r\nthat--and we\'re going to take that magnificent trip through the\r\nWest--the Yosemite and so forth. It appears the flora of California is\r\nespecially interesting and we\'re to carry those delicious little tin\r\nboxes strapped over our shoulders to hold specimens. Her son and\r\ndaughter are both, in their way, striking. He isn\'t handsome; rather\r\nthe contrary; but so serene and collected--so intensely bitter--his\r\nmother tells me he\'s a pessimist. And the daughter really puts me to\r\nshame, child as she is, with the amount of her knowledge. She labels\r\nall her mother\'s specimens in Latin. Oh, I feel there\'s so much to be\r\nlearned. Mrs. Griesmann thinks I ought to wear glasses during the\r\ntrip. Says we often require them without knowing it ourselves--that\r\nthey are so restful. She has some theory about it. I\'m trying a pair,\r\nand see a great deal better through them than I expected to. Only they\r\ndon\'t hold on very well, especially when I laugh.\r\n\r\n"\xa0\'Who do you suppose seized on to me in Vandervoort\'s the other day,\r\nbut that impertinent Mrs. Belle Worthington! Positively took me by the\r\ncoat and commenced to gush about dear sister Th\xe9r\xe8se. She said: "I\r\ntell you what, my dear--" called me my dear at the highest pitch, and\r\nthat odious Mrs. Van Wycke behind us listening and pretending to\r\nexamine a lace handkerchief. "That Mrs. Lafirme\'s a trump," she\r\nsaid--"too good for most any man. Hope you won\'t take offense, but I\r\nmust say, your brother David\'s a perfect stick--it\'s what I always\r\nsaid." Can you conceive of such shocking impertinence?\'\r\n\r\n"Well; Belle Worthington does possess the virtue of candor," said\r\nHosmer amused and folding the letter. "That\'s about all there is,\r\nexcept a piece of scandal concerning people you don\'t know; that\r\nwouldn\'t interest you."\r\n\r\n"But it would interest me," Th\xe9r\xe8se insisted, with a little wifely\r\nresentment that her husband should have a knowledge of people that\r\nexcluded her.\r\n\r\n"Then you shall hear it," he said, turning to the letter again. "Let\'s\r\nsee--\'conceive--shocking impertinence--\' oh, here it is.\r\n\r\n"\xa0\'Don\'t know if you have learned the horrible scandal; too dreadful\r\nto talk about. I shall send you the paper. I always knew that Lou\r\nDawson was a perfidious creature--and Bert Rodney! You never did like\r\nhim, David; but he was always so much the gentleman in his\r\nmanners--you must admit that. Who could have dreamed it of him. Poor\r\nMrs. Rodney is after all the one to be pitied. She is utterly\r\nprostrated. Refuses to see even her most intimate friends. It all came\r\nof those two vile wretches thinking Jack Dawson out of town when he\r\nwasn\'t; for he was right there following them around in their\r\nperambulations. And the outcome is that Mr. Rodney has his beauty\r\nspoiled they say forever; the shot came very near being fatal. But\r\npoor, poor Mrs. Rodney!\r\n\r\n"\xa0\'Well, good-bye, you dearest David mine. How I wish you both knew\r\nMrs. Griesmann. Give that sweet sister Th\xe9r\xe8se as many kisses as she\r\nwill stand for me.\r\n\r\n                                   Melicent.\'\xa0"\r\n\r\nThis time Hosmer put the letter into his pocket, and Th\xe9r\xe8se asked\r\nwith a little puzzled air: "What do you suppose is going to become of\r\nMelicent, anyway, David?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, love, unless she marries my friend Homeyer."\r\n\r\n"Now, David, you are trying to mystify me. I believe there\'s a streak\r\nof perversity in you after all."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is; and here comes Mandy to say that \'suppa\'s gittin\'\r\ncole.\'\xa0"\r\n\r\n"Aunt B\'lindy \'low suppa on de table gittin\' cole," said Mandy,\r\nretreating at once from the fire of their merriment.\r\n\r\nTh\xe9r\xe8se arose and held her two hands out to her husband.\r\n\r\nHe took them but did not rise; only leaned further back on the seat\r\nand looked up at her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, supper\'s a bore; don\'t you think so?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," she replied. "I\'m hungry, and so are you. Come, David."\r\n\r\n"But look, Th\xe9r\xe8se, just when the moon has climbed over the top of\r\nthat live-oak? We can\'t go now. And then Melicent\'s request; we must\r\nthink about that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, surely not, David," she said, drawing back.\r\n\r\n"Then let me tell you something," and he drew her head down and\r\nwhispered something in her pink ear that he just brushed with his\r\nlips. It made Th\xe9r\xe8se laugh and turn very rosy in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nCan that be Hosmer? Is this Th\xe9r\xe8se? Fie, fie. It is time we were\r\nleaving them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of At Fault, by Kate Chopin\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AT FAULT ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 23810-8.txt or 23810-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/8/1/23810/\r\n\r\nProduced by Bernard Koloski\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
