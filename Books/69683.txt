He set\r\ndown his suitcase and knocked on the door. There was no answer. Manuel,\r\nstanding in the hallway, felt there was some one in the room. He felt it\r\nthrough the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetana,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, listening.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s there, all right, Manuel thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetana,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and banged the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d said some one in the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe, Manolo,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to work,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nSomething in the door clicked several times and it swung open. Manuel\r\nwent in, carrying his suitcase.\r\n\r\nA little man sat behind a desk at the far side of the room. Over his\r\nhead was a bull\xe2\x80\x99s head, stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls\r\nwere framed photographs and bull-fight posters.\r\n\r\nThe little man sat looking at Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they\xe2\x80\x99d killed you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nManuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk. The little man sat looking\r\nat him across the desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many corridas you had this year?\xe2\x80\x9d Retana asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust that one?\xe2\x80\x9d the little man asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read about it in the papers,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. He leaned back in the\r\nchair and looked at Manuel.\r\n\r\nManuel looked up at the stuffed bull. He had seen it often before. He\r\nfelt a certain family interest in it. It had killed his brother, the\r\npromising one, about nine years ago. Manuel remembered the day. There\r\nwas a brass plate on the oak shield the bull\xe2\x80\x99s head was mounted on.\r\nManuel could not read it, but he imagined it was in memory of his\r\nbrother. Well, he had been a good kid.\r\n\r\nThe plate said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bull \xe2\x80\x98Mariposa\xe2\x80\x99 of the Duke of Veragua, which\r\naccepted 9 varas for 7 caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia,\r\nNovillero, April 27, 1909.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana saw him looking at the stuffed bull\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will make a scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all bad in the legs. What do they say about them at the Caf\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just got in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou still have your bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Manuel, leaning back behind the big desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTake off your cap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel sat down; his cap off, his face was changed. He looked pale, and\r\nhis coleta pinned forward on his head, so that it would not show under\r\nthe cap, gave him a strange look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look well,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just got out of the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard they\xe2\x80\x99d cut your leg off,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel. \xe2\x80\x9cIt got all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of\r\ncigarettes toward Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a cigarette,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel lit it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmoke?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, offering the match to Retana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana waved his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI never smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana watched him smoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you get a job and go to work?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to work,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a bull-fighter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t any bull-fighters any more,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a bull-fighter,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, while you\xe2\x80\x99re in there,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\nManuel laughed.\r\n\r\nRetana sat, saying nothing and looking at Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in a nocturnal if you want,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to substitute for anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. That was the way\r\nthey all got killed. That was the way Salvador got killed. He tapped\r\nwith his knuckles on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put me on next week?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll they want is Litri and Rubito and\r\nLa Torre. Those kids are good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d come to see me get it,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said, hopefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you are any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m offering to put you on to-morrow night,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can work\r\nwith young Hernandez and kill two novillos after the Chariots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose novillos?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Whatever stuff they\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the corrals. What the\r\nveterinaries won\xe2\x80\x99t pass in the daytime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to substitute,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can take it or leave it,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. He leaned forward over the\r\npapers. He was no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel had made to\r\nhim for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone. He would like\r\nto get him to substitute for Larita because he could get him cheaply. He\r\ncould get others cheaply too. He would like to help him though. Still he\r\nhad given him the chance. It was up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do I get?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked. He was still playing with the idea of\r\nrefusing. But he knew he could not refuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred and fifty pesetas,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. He had thought of five\r\nhundred, but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pay Villalta seven thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not Villalta,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe draws it, Manolo,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said in explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel. He stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me three hundred, Retana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana agreed. He reached in the drawer for a paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I have fifty now?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Retana. He took a fifty peseta note out of his pocket-book\r\nand laid it, spread out flat, on the table.\r\n\r\nManuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about a cuadrilla?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the boys that always work for me nights,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about picadors?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not much,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have one good pic,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet him then,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and get him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot out of this,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not paying for any cuadrilla out of\r\nsixty duros.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana said nothing but looked at Manuel across the big desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have one good pic,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nRetana said nothing but looked at Manuel from a long way off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nRetana was still considering him, leaning back in his chair, considering\r\nhim from a long way away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99re the regular pics,\xe2\x80\x9d he offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know your regular pics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana did not smile. Manuel knew it was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I want is an even break,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said reasoningly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I go out\r\nthere I want to be able to call my shots on the bull. It only takes one\r\ngood picador.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was talking to a man who was no longer listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want something extra,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and get it. There will\r\nbe a regular cuadrilla out there. Bring as many of your own pics as you\r\nwant. The charlotada is over by 10.30.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you feel about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you to-morrow night,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana said.\r\n\r\nManuel picked up his suitcase and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut the door,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana called.\r\n\r\nManuel looked back. Retana was sitting forward looking at some papers.\r\nManuel pulled the door tight until it clicked.\r\n\r\nHe went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of\r\nthe street. It was very hot in the street and the light on the white\r\nbuildings was sudden and hard on his eyes. He walked down the shady side\r\nof the steep street toward the Puerta del Sol. The shade felt solid and\r\ncool as running water. The heat came suddenly as he crossed the\r\nintersecting streets. Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nJust before the Puerta del Sol he turned into a caf\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet in the caf\xc3\xa9. There were a few men sitting at tables against\r\nthe wall. At one table four men played cards. Most of the men sat\r\nagainst the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups and liqueur-glasses before\r\nthem on the tables. Manuel went through the long room to a small room in\r\nback. A man sat at a table in the corner asleep. Manuel sat down at one\r\nof the tables.\r\n\r\nA waiter came in and stood beside Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Zurito?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in before lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d the waiter answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t be back before\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nThe waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big\r\ncoffee-glass and a liqueur-glass on it. In his left hand he held a\r\nbottle of brandy. He swung these down to the table and a boy who had\r\nfollowed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny,\r\nspouted pots with long handles.\r\n\r\nManuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned\r\nforward on his head. He winked at the coffee-boy as he poured out the\r\nbrandy into the little glass beside Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s coffee. The coffee-boy\r\nlooked at Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s pale face curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fighting here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the waiter, corking up the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter stood there, holding the bottle on one hip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou in the Charlie Chaplins?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. In the ordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they were going to have Chaves and Hernandez,\xe2\x80\x9d the waiter\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Me and another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Chaves or Hernandez?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHernandez, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Chaves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Looie,\xe2\x80\x9d the waiter called to the next room, \xe2\x80\x9cChaves got cogida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them\r\ninto his coffee. He stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and\r\nwarming in his empty stomach. He drank off the brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me another shot of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full, slopping\r\nanother drink into the saucer. Another waiter had come up in front of\r\nthe table. The coffee-boy was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Chaves hurt bad?\xe2\x80\x9d the second waiter asked Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said, \xe2\x80\x9cRetana didn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hell of a lot he cares,\xe2\x80\x9d the tall waiter said. Manuel had not seen\r\nhim before. He must have just come up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you stand in with Retana in this town, you\xe2\x80\x99re a made man,\xe2\x80\x9d the tall\r\nwaiter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you aren\xe2\x80\x99t in with him, you might just as well go out\r\nand shoot yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said it,\xe2\x80\x9d the other waiter who had come in said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said it\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right I said it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall waiter. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking\r\nabout when I talk about that bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for Villalta,\xe2\x80\x9d the first waiter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that ain\xe2\x80\x99t all,\xe2\x80\x9d the tall waiter said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for\r\nMarcial Lalanda. Look what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for Nacional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said it, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the short waiter.\r\n\r\nManuel looked at them, standing talking in front of his table. He had\r\ndrunk his second brandy. They had forgotten about him. They were not\r\ninterested in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that bunch of camels,\xe2\x80\x9d the tall waiter went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever\r\nsee this Nacional II?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seen him last Sunday didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d the original waiter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a giraffe,\xe2\x80\x9d the short waiter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d the tall waiter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are Retana\xe2\x80\x99s boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, give me another shot of that,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. He had poured the\r\nbrandy the waiter had slopped over in the saucer into his glass and\r\ndrank it while they were talking.\r\n\r\nThe original waiter poured his glass full mechanically, and the three of\r\nthem went out of the room talking.\r\n\r\nIn the far corner the man was still asleep, snoring slightly on the\r\nintaking breath, his head back against the wall.\r\n\r\nManuel drank his brandy. He felt sleepy himself. It was too hot to go\r\nout into the town. Besides there was nothing to do. He wanted to see\r\nZurito. He would go to sleep while he waited. He kicked his suitcase\r\nunder the table to be sure it was there. Perhaps it would be better to\r\nput it back under the seat, against the wall. He leaned down and shoved\r\nit under. Then he leaned forward on the table and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke there was some one sitting across the table from him. It\r\nwas a big man with a heavy brown face like an Indian. He had been\r\nsitting there some time. He had waved the waiter away and sat reading\r\nthe paper and occasionally looking down at Manuel, asleep, his head on\r\nthe table. He read the paper laboriously, forming the words with his\r\nlips as he read. When it tired him he looked at Manuel. He sat heavily\r\nin the chair, his black Cordoba hat tipped forward.\r\n\r\nManuel sat up and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Zurito,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d the big man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel rubbed his forehead with the back of his\r\nfist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought maybe you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. How is everything with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both silent. Zurito, the picador, looked at Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s white\r\nface. Manuel looked down at the picador\xe2\x80\x99s enormous hands folding the\r\npaper to put away in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got a favor to ask you, Manos,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nManosduros was Zurito\xe2\x80\x99s nickname. He never heard it without thinking of\r\nhis huge hands. He put them forward on the table self-consciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a drink,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel.\r\n\r\nThe waiter came and went and came again. He went out of the room looking\r\nback at the two men at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Manolo?\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito set down his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you pic two bulls for me to-morrow night?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked, looking\r\nup at Zurito across the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zurito. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not pic-ing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel looked down at his glass. He had expected that answer; now he had\r\nit. Well, he had it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Manolo, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not pic-ing.\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito looked at his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too old,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the nocturnal to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. I figured if I had just one good pic, I could get away with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much are you getting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred pesetas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get more than that for pic-ing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any right to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you keep on doing it for?\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you cut off\r\nyour coleta, Manolo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pretty near as old as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got to do it. If I can fix it so that I\r\nget an even break, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I want. I got to stick with it, Manos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried keeping away from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how you feel. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. You ought to get out and stay\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going good lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito looked at his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I was going great when I got hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito said nothing. He tipped the cognac out of his saucer into his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe papers said they never saw a better faena,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nZurito looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know when I get going I\xe2\x80\x99m good,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too old,\xe2\x80\x9d the picador said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ten years older than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me it\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not too old,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nThey sat silent, Manuel watching the picador\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going great till I got hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have seen me, Manos,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen me lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito looked at Manuel, avoiding his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to quit it, Manolo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going good now, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito leaned forward, his hands on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pic for you and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go big to-morrow night,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll quit. See? Will you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito leaned back, relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to quit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo monkey business. You got to cut the\r\ncoleta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have to quit,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou watch me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito stood up. He felt tired from arguing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to quit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your coleta myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito called the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zurito. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on up to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel reached under the seat for his suitcase. He was happy. He knew\r\nZurito would pic for him. He was the best picador living. It was all\r\nsimple now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on up to the house and we\xe2\x80\x99ll eat,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nManuel stood in the patio de caballos waiting for the Charlie Chaplins\r\nto be over. Zurito stood beside him. Where they stood it was dark. The\r\nhigh door that led into the bull-ring was shut. Above them they heard a\r\nshout, then another shout of laughter. Then there was silence. Manuel\r\nliked the smell of the stables about the patio de caballos. It smelt\r\ngood in the dark. There was another roar from the arena and then\r\napplause, prolonged applause, going on and on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ever seen these fellows?\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito asked, big and looming beside\r\nManuel in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re pretty funny.\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said. He smiled to himself in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe high, double, tight-fitting door into the bull-ring swung open and\r\nManuel saw the ring in the hard light of the arc-lights, the plaza, dark\r\nall the way around, rising high; around the edge of the ring were\r\nrunning and bowing two men dressed like tramps, followed by a third in\r\nthe uniform of a hotel bell-boy who stooped and picked up the hats and\r\ncanes thrown down onto the sand and tossed them back up into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe electric light went on in the patio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll climb onto one of those ponies while you collect the kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBehind them came the jingle of the mules, coming out to go into the\r\narena and be hitched onto the dead bull.\r\n\r\nThe members of the cuadrilla, who had been watching the burlesque from\r\nthe runway between the barrera and the seats, came walking back and\r\nstood in a group talking, under the electric light in the patio. A\r\ngood-looking lad in a silver-and-orange suit came up to Manuel and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Hernandez,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and put out his hand.\r\n\r\nManuel shook it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re regular elephants we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re big ones with horns,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou drew the worst lot,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bigger they are, the more meat for\r\nthe poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that one?\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an old one,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou line up your cuadrilla, so I can\r\nsee what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got some good kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez said. He was very cheerful. He\r\nhad been on twice before in nocturnals and was beginning to get a\r\nfollowing in Madrid. He was happy the fight would start in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the pics?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re back in the corrals fighting about who gets the beautiful\r\nhorses,\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez grinned.\r\n\r\nThe mules came through the gate in a rush, the whips snapping, bells\r\njangling and the young bull ploughing a furrow of sand.\r\n\r\nThey formed up for the paseo as soon as the bull had gone through.\r\n\r\nManuel and Hernandez stood in front. The youths of the cuadrillas were\r\nbehind, their heavy capes furled over their arms. In back, the four\r\npicadors, mounted, holding their steel-tipped push-poles erect in the\r\nhalf-dark of the corral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder Retana wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give us enough light to see the horses\r\nby,\xe2\x80\x9d one picador said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happier if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too good a look at these\r\nskins,\xe2\x80\x9d another pic answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing I\xe2\x80\x99m on barely keeps me off the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d the first picador\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99re horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, they\xe2\x80\x99re horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked, sitting their gaunt horses in the dark.\r\n\r\nZurito said nothing. He had the only steady horse of the lot. He had\r\ntried him, wheeling him in the corrals and he responded to the bit and\r\nthe spurs. He had taken the bandage off his right eye and cut the\r\nstrings where they had tied his ears tight shut at the base. He was a\r\ngood, solid horse, solid on his legs. That was all he needed. He\r\nintended to ride him all through the corrida. He had already, since he\r\nhad mounted, sitting in the half-dark in the big, quilted saddle,\r\nwaiting for the paseo, pic-ed through the whole corrida in his mind. The\r\nother picadors went on talking on both sides of him. He did not hear\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe two matadors stood together in front of their three peones, their\r\ncapes furled over their left arms in the same fashion. Manuel was\r\nthinking about the three lads in back of him. They were all three\r\nMadrile\xc3\xb1os, like Hernandez, boys about nineteen. One of them, a gypsy,\r\nserious, aloof, and dark-faced, he liked the look of. He turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name, kid?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the gypsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFuentes,\xe2\x80\x9d the gypsy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good name,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy smiled, showing his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take the bull and give him a little run when he comes out,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d the gypsy said. His face was serious. He began to think\r\nabout just what he would do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she goes,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said to Hernandez.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeads up, swinging with the music, their right arms swinging free, they\r\nstepped out, crossing the sanded arena under the arc-lights, the\r\ncuadrillas opening out behind, the picadors riding after, behind came\r\nthe bull-ring servants and the jingling mules. The crowd applauded\r\nHernandez as they marched across the arena. Arrogant, swinging, they\r\nlooked straight ahead as they marched.\r\n\r\nThey bowed before the president, and the procession broke up into its\r\ncomponent parts. The bull-fighters went over to the barrera and changed\r\ntheir heavy mantles for the light fighting capes. The mules went out.\r\nThe picadors galloped jerkily around the ring, and two rode out the gate\r\nthey had come in by. The servants swept the sand smooth.\r\n\r\nManuel drank a glass of water poured for him by one of Retana\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeputies, who was acting as his manager and sword-handler. Hernandez\r\ncame over from speaking with his own manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got a good hand, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel complimented him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey like me,\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez said happily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did the paseo go?\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel asked Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a wedding,\xe2\x80\x9d said the handler. \xe2\x80\x9cFine. You came out like Joselito\r\nand Belmonte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito rode by, a bulky equestrian statue. He wheeled his horse and\r\nfaced him toward the toril on the far side of the ring where the bull\r\nwould come out. It was strange under the arc-light. He pic-ed in the hot\r\nafternoon sun for big money. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like this arc-light business. He\r\nwished they would get started.\r\n\r\nManuel went up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPic him, Manos,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCut him down to size for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pic him, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito spat on the sand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make him jump out of\r\nthe ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLean on him, Manos,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lean on him,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s holding it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming now,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nZurito sat there, his feet in the box-stirrups, his great legs in the\r\nbuckskin-covered armor gripping the horse, the reins in his left hand,\r\nthe long pic held in his right hand, his broad hat well down over his\r\neyes to shade them from the lights, watching the distant door of the\r\ntoril. His horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears quivered. Zurito patted him with his left hand.\r\n\r\nThe red door of the toril swung back and for a moment Zurito looked into\r\nthe empty passageway far across the arena. Then the bull came out in a\r\nrush, skidding on his four legs as he came out under the lights, then\r\ncharging in a gallop, moving softly in a fast gallop, silent except as\r\nhe woofed through wide nostrils as he charged, glad to be free after the\r\ndark pen.\r\n\r\nIn the first row of seats, slightly bored, leaning forward to write on\r\nthe cement wall in front of his knees, the substitute bull-fight critic\r\nof _El Heraldo_ scribbled: \xe2\x80\x9cCampagnero, Negro, 42, came out at 90 miles\r\nan hour with plenty of gas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel, leaning against the barrera, watching the bull, waved his hand\r\nand the gypsy ran out, trailing his cape. The bull, in full gallop,\r\npivoted and charged the cape, his head down, his tail rising. The gypsy\r\nmoved in a zigzag, and as he passed, the bull caught sight of him and\r\nabandoned the cape to charge the man. The gyp sprinted and vaulted the\r\nred fence of the barrera as the bull struck it with his horns. He tossed\r\ninto it twice with his horns, banging into the wood blindly.\r\n\r\nThe critic of _El Heraldo_ lit a cigarette and tossed the match at the\r\nbull, then wrote in his note-book, \xe2\x80\x9clarge and with enough horns to\r\nsatisfy the cash customers, Campagnero showed a tendency to cut into the\r\nterrane of the bull-fighters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel stepped out on the hard sand as the bull banged into the fence.\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw Zurito sitting the white horse close\r\nto the barrera, about a quarter of the way around the ring to the left.\r\nManuel held the cape close in front of him, a fold in each hand, and\r\nshouted at the bull. \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! Huh!\xe2\x80\x9d The bull turned, seemed to brace\r\nagainst the fence as he charged in a scramble, driving into the cape as\r\nManuel side-stepped, pivoted on his heels with the charge of the bull,\r\nand swung the cape just ahead of the horns. At the end of the swing he\r\nwas facing the bull again and held the cape in the same position close\r\nin front of his body, and pivoted again as the bull recharged. Each\r\ntime, as he swung, the crowd shouted.\r\n\r\nFour times he swung with the bull, lifting the cape so it billowed full,\r\nand each time bringing the bull around to charge again. Then, at the end\r\nof the fifth swing, he held the cape against his hip and pivoted, so the\r\ncape swung out like a ballet dancer\xe2\x80\x99s skirt and wound the bull around\r\nhimself like a belt, to step clear, leaving the bull facing Zurito on\r\nthe white horse, come up and planted firm, the horse facing the bull,\r\nits ears forward, its lips nervous, Zurito, his hat over his eyes,\r\nleaning forward, the long pole sticking out before and behind in a sharp\r\nangle under his right arm, held half-way down, the triangular iron point\r\nfacing the bull.\r\n\r\n_El Heraldo\xe2\x80\x99s_ second-string critic, drawing on his cigarette, his eyes\r\non the bull, wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cthe veteran Manolo designed a series of acceptable\r\nveronicas, ending in a very Belmontistic recorte that earned applause\r\nfrom the regulars, and we entered the tercio of the cavalry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZurito sat his horse, measuring the distance between the bull and the\r\nend of the pic. As he looked, the bull gathered himself together and\r\ncharged, his eyes on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s chest. As he lowered his head to hook,\r\nZurito sunk the point of the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above\r\nthe bull\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, leaned all his weight on the shaft, and with his\r\nleft hand pulled the white horse into the air, front hoofs pawing, and\r\nswung him to the right as he pushed the bull under and through so the\r\nhorns passed safely under the horse\xe2\x80\x99s belly and the horse came down,\r\nquivering, the bull\xe2\x80\x99s tail brushing his chest as he charged the cape\r\nHernandez offered him.\r\n\r\nHernandez ran sideways, taking the bull out and away with the cape,\r\ntoward the other picador. He fixed him with a swing of the cape,\r\nsquarely facing the horse and rider, and stepped back. As the bull saw\r\nthe horse he charged. The picador\xe2\x80\x99s lance slid along his back, and as\r\nthe shock of the charge lifted the horse, the picador was already\r\nhalf-way out of the saddle, lifting his right leg clear as he missed\r\nwith the lance and falling to the left side to keep the horse between\r\nhim and the bull. The horse, lifted and gored, crashed over with the\r\nbull driving into him, the picador gave a shove with his boots against\r\nthe horse and lay clear, waiting to be lifted and hauled away and put on\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nManuel let the bull drive into the fallen horse; he was in no hurry, the\r\npicador was safe; besides, it did a picador like that good to worry.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d stay on longer next time. Lousy pics! He looked across the sand at\r\nZurito a little way out from the barrera, his horse rigid, waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the bull, \xe2\x80\x9cTomar!\xe2\x80\x9d holding the cape in both hands so\r\nit would catch his eye. The bull detached himself from the horse and\r\ncharged the cape, and Manuel, running sideways and holding the cape\r\nspread wide, stopped, swung on his heels, and brought the bull sharply\r\naround facing Zurito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCampagnero accepted a pair of varas for the death of one rosinante,\r\nwith Hernandez and Manolo at the quites,\xe2\x80\x9d _El Heraldo\xe2\x80\x99s_ critic wrote.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe pressed on the iron and clearly showed he was no horse-lover. The\r\nveteran Zurito resurrected some of his old stuff with the pike-pole,\r\nnotably the suerte\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOl\xc3\xa9 Ol\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d the man sitting beside him shouted. The shout was lost in the\r\nroar of the crowd, and he slapped the critic on the back. The critic\r\nlooked up to see Zurito, directly below him, leaning far out over his\r\nhorse, the length of the pic rising in a sharp angle under his armpit,\r\nholding the pic almost by the point, bearing down with all his weight,\r\nholding the bull off, the bull pushing and driving to get at the horse,\r\nand Zurito, far out, on top of him, holding him, holding him, and slowly\r\npivoting the horse against the pressure, so that at last he was clear.\r\nZurito felt the moment when the horse was clear and the bull could come\r\npast, and relaxed the absolute steel lock of his resistance, and the\r\ntriangular steel point of the pic ripped in the bull\xe2\x80\x99s hump of shoulder\r\nmuscle as he tore loose to find Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s cape before his muzzle. He\r\ncharged blindly into the cape and the boy took him out into the open\r\narena.\r\n\r\nZurito sat patting his horse and looking at the bull charging the cape\r\nthat Hernandez swung for him out under the bright light while the crowd\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that one?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got him that time,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of a closely turned pass of the cape the bull slid to\r\nhis knees. He was up at once, but far out across the sand Manuel and\r\nZurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of blood, smooth against the\r\nblack of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got him that time,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good bull,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they gave me another shot at him, I\xe2\x80\x99d kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll change the thirds on us,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at him now,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got to go over there,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said, and started on a run for the\r\nother side of the ring, where the monos were leading a horse out by the\r\nbridle toward the bull, whacking him on the legs with rods and all, in a\r\nprocession, trying to get him toward the bull, who stood, dropping his\r\nhead, pawing, unable to make up his mind to charge.\r\n\r\nZurito, sitting his horse, walking him toward the scene, not missing any\r\ndetail, scowled.\r\n\r\nFinally the bull charged, the horse leaders ran for the barrera, the\r\npicador hit too far back, and the bull got under the horse, lifted him,\r\nthrew him onto his back.\r\n\r\nZurito watched. The monos, in their red shirts, running out to drag the\r\npicador clear. The picador, now on his feet, swearing and flopping his\r\narms. Manuel and Hernandez standing ready with their capes. And the\r\nbull, the great, black bull, with a horse on his back, hooves dangling,\r\nthe bridle caught in the horns. Black bull with a horse on his back,\r\nstaggering short-legged, then arching his neck and lifting, thrusting,\r\ncharging to slide the horse off, horse sliding down. Then the bull into\r\na lunging charge at the cape Manuel spread for him.\r\n\r\nThe bull was slower now, Manuel felt. He was bleeding badly. There was a\r\nsheen of blood all down his flank.\r\n\r\nManuel offered him the cape again. There he came, eyes open, ugly,\r\nwatching the cape. Manuel stepped to the side and raised his arms,\r\ntightening the cape ahead of the bull for the veronica.\r\n\r\nNow he was facing the bull. Yes, his head was going down a little. He\r\nwas carrying it lower. That was Zurito.\r\n\r\nManuel flopped the cape; there he comes; he side-stepped and swung in\r\nanother veronica. He\xe2\x80\x99s shooting awfully accurately, he thought. He\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\nenough fight, so he\xe2\x80\x99s watching now. He\xe2\x80\x99s hunting now. Got his eye on me.\r\nBut I always give him the cape.\r\n\r\nHe shook the cape at the bull; there he comes; he side-stepped. Awful\r\nclose that time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to work that close to him.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the cape was wet with blood where it had swept along the\r\nbull\xe2\x80\x99s back as he went by.\r\n\r\nAll right, here\xe2\x80\x99s the last one.\r\n\r\nManuel, facing the bull, having turned with him each charge, offered the\r\ncape with his two hands. The bull looked at him. Eyes watching, horns\r\nstraight forward, the bull looked at him, watching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said, \xe2\x80\x9cToro!\xe2\x80\x9d and leaning back, swung the cape forward.\r\nHere he comes. He side-stepped, swung the cape in back of him, and\r\npivoted, so the bull followed a swirl of cape and then was left with\r\nnothing, fixed by the pass, dominated by the cape. Manuel swung the cape\r\nunder his muzzle with one hand, to show the bull was fixed, and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThere was no applause.\r\n\r\nManuel walked across the sand toward the barrera, while Zurito rode out\r\nof the ring. The trumpet had blown to change the act to the planting of\r\nthe banderillos while Manuel had been working with the bull. He had not\r\nconsciously noticed it. The monos were spreading canvas over the two\r\ndead horses and sprinkling sawdust around them.\r\n\r\nManuel came up to the barrera for a drink of water. Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man handed\r\nhim the heavy porous jug.\r\n\r\nFuentes, the tall gypsy, was standing holding a pair of banderillos,\r\nholding them together, slim, red sticks, fish-hook points out. He looked\r\nat Manuel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy trotted out. Manuel set down the jug and watched. He wiped his\r\nface with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe critic of _El Heraldo_ reached for the bottle of warm champagne that\r\nstood between his feet, took a drink, and finished his paragraph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94the aged Manolo rated no applause for a vulgar series of lances with\r\nthe cape and we entered the third of the palings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlone in the centre of the ring the bull stood, still fixed. Fuentes,\r\ntall, flat-backed, walking toward him arrogantly, his arms spread out,\r\nthe two slim, red sticks, one in each hand, held by the fingers, points\r\nstraight forward. Fuentes walked forward. Back of him and to one side\r\nwas a peon with a cape. The bull looked at him and was no longer fixed.\r\n\r\nHis eyes watched Fuentes, now standing still. Now he leaned back,\r\ncalling to him. Fuentes twitched the two banderillos and the light on\r\nthe steel points caught the bull\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\nHis tail went up and he charged.\r\n\r\nHe came straight, his eyes on the man. Fuentes stood still, leaning\r\nback, the banderillos pointing forward. As the bull lowered his head to\r\nhook, Fuentes leaned backward, his arms came together and rose, his two\r\nhands touching, the banderillos two descending red lines, and leaning\r\nforward drove the points into the bull\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, leaning far in over\r\nthe bull\xe2\x80\x99s horns and pivoting on the two upright sticks, his legs tight\r\ntogether, his body curving to one side to let the bull pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOl\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d from the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe bull was hooking wildly, jumping like a trout, all four feet off the\r\nground. The red shaft of the banderillos tossed as he jumped.\r\n\r\nManuel standing at the barrera, noticed that he hooked always to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to drop the next pair on the right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the kid who\r\nstarted to run out to Fuentes with the new banderillos.\r\n\r\nA heavy hand fell on his shoulder. It was Zurito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel, kid?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nManuel was watching the bull.\r\n\r\nZurito leaned forward on the barrera, leaning the weight of his body on\r\nhis arms. Manuel turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going good,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\nManuel shook his head. He had nothing to do now until the next third.\r\nThe gypsy was very good with the banderillos. The bull would come to him\r\nin the next third in good shape. He was a good bull. It had all been\r\neasy up to now. The final stuff with the sword was all he worried over.\r\nHe did not really worry. He did not even think about it. But standing\r\nthere he had a heavy sense of apprehension. He looked out at the bull,\r\nplanning his faena, his work with the red cloth that was to reduce the\r\nbull, to make him manageable.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy was walking out toward the bull again, walking heel-and-toe,\r\ninsultingly, like a ball-room dancer, the red shafts of the banderillos\r\ntwitching with his walk. The bull watched him, not fixed now, hunting\r\nhim, but waiting to get close enough so he could be sure of getting him,\r\ngetting the horns into him.\r\n\r\nAs Fuentes walked forward the bull charged. Fuentes ran across the\r\nquarter of a circle as the bull charged and, as he passed running\r\nbackward, stopped, swung forward, rose on his toes, arms straight out,\r\nand sunk the banderillos straight down into the tight of the big\r\nshoulder muscles as the bull missed him.\r\n\r\nThe crowd were wild about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat kid won\xe2\x80\x99t stay in this night stuff long,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man said to\r\nZurito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey watched.\r\n\r\nFuentes was standing with his back against the barrera. Two of the\r\ncuadrilla were back of him, with their capes ready to flop over the\r\nfence to distract the bull.\r\n\r\nThe bull, with his tongue out, his barrel heaving, was watching the\r\ngypsy. He thought he had him now. Back against the red planks. Only a\r\nshort charge away. The bull watched him.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy bent back, drew back his arms, the banderillos pointing at the\r\nbull. He called to the bull, stamped one foot. The bull was suspicious.\r\nHe wanted the man. No more barbs in the shoulder.\r\n\r\nFuentes walked a little closer to the bull. Bent back. Called again.\r\nSomebody in the crowd shouted a warning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s too damn close,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch him,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man said.\r\n\r\nLeaning back, inciting the bull with the banderillos, Fuentes jumped,\r\nboth feet off the ground. As he jumped the bull\xe2\x80\x99s tail rose and he\r\ncharged. Fuentes came down on his toes, arms straight out, whole body\r\narching forward, and drove the shafts straight down as he swung his body\r\nclear of the right horn.\r\n\r\nThe bull crashed into the barrera where the flopping capes had attracted\r\nhis eye as he lost the man.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy came running along the barrera toward Manuel, taking the\r\napplause of the crowd. His vest was ripped where he had not quite\r\ncleared the point of the horn. He was happy about it, showing it to the\r\nspectators. He made the tour of the ring. Zurito saw him go by, smiling,\r\npointing at his vest. He smiled.\r\n\r\nSomebody else was planting the last pair of banderillos. Nobody was\r\npaying any attention.\r\n\r\nRetana\xe2\x80\x99s man tucked a baton inside the red cloth of a muleta, folded the\r\ncloth over it, and handed it over the barrera to Manuel. He reached in\r\nthe leather sword-case, took out a sword, and holding it by its leather\r\nscabbard, reached it over the fence to Manuel. Manuel pulled the blade\r\nout by the red hilt and the scabbard fell limp.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Zurito. The big man saw he was sweating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you get him, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\nManuel nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in good shape,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like you want him,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man assured him.\r\n\r\nManuel nodded.\r\n\r\nThe trumpeter, up under the roof, blew for the final act, and Manuel\r\nwalked across the arena toward where, up in the dark boxes, the\r\npresident must be.\r\n\r\nIn the front row of seats the substitute bull-fight critic of _El\r\nHeraldo_ took a long drink of the warm champagne. He had decided it was\r\nnot worth while to write a running story and would write up the corrida\r\nback in the office. What the hell was it anyway? Only a nocturnal. If he\r\nmissed anything he would get it out of the morning papers. He took\r\nanother drink of the champagne. He had a date at Maxim\xe2\x80\x99s at twelve. Who\r\nwere these bull-fighters anyway? Kids and bums. A bunch of bums. He put\r\nhis pad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward Manuel, standing\r\nvery much alone in the ring, gesturing with his hat in a salute toward a\r\nbox he could not see high up in the dark plaza. Out in the ring the bull\r\nstood quiet, looking at nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dedicate this bull to you, Mr. President, and to the public of\r\nMadrid, the most intelligent and generous of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d was what Manuel\r\nwas saying. It was a formula. He said it all. It was a little long for\r\nnocturnal use.\r\n\r\nHe bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed his hat over his shoulder,\r\nand, carrying the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right,\r\nwalked out toward the bull.\r\n\r\nManuel walked toward the bull. The bull looked at him; his eyes were\r\nquick. Manuel noticed the way the banderillos hung down on his left\r\nshoulder and the steady sheen of blood from Zurito\xe2\x80\x99s pic-ing. He noticed\r\nthe way the bull\xe2\x80\x99s feet were. As he walked forward, holding the muleta\r\nin his left hand and the sword in his right, he watched the bull\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\nThe bull could not charge without gathering his feet together. Now he\r\nstood square on them, dully.\r\n\r\nManuel walked toward him, watching his feet. This was all right. He\r\ncould do this. He must work to get the bull\xe2\x80\x99s head down, so he could go\r\nin past the horns and kill him. He did not think about the sword, not\r\nabout killing the bull. He thought about one thing at a time. The coming\r\nthings oppressed him, though. Walking forward, watching the bull\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\nhe saw successively his eyes, his wet muzzle, and the wide,\r\nforward-pointing spread of his horns. The bull had light circles about\r\nhis eyes. His eyes watched Manuel. He felt he was going to get this\r\nlittle one with the white face.\r\n\r\nStanding still now and spreading the red cloth of the muleta with the\r\nsword, pricking the point into the cloth so that the sword, now held in\r\nhis left hand, spread the red flannel like the jib of a boat, Manuel\r\nnoticed the points of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s horns. One of them was splintered from\r\nbanging against the barrera. The other was sharp as a porcupine quill.\r\nManuel noticed while spreading the muleta that the white base of the\r\nhorn was stained red. While he noticed these things he did not lose\r\nsight of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s feet. The bull watched Manuel steadily.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s on the defensive now, Manuel thought. He\xe2\x80\x99s reserving himself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to bring him out of that and get his head down. Always get his head\r\ndown. Zurito had his head down once, but he\xe2\x80\x99s come back. He\xe2\x80\x99ll bleed\r\nwhen I start him going and that will bring it down.\r\n\r\nHolding the muleta, with the sword in his left hand widening it in front\r\nof him, he called to the bull.\r\n\r\nThe bull looked at him.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back insultingly and shook the wide-spread flannel.\r\n\r\nThe bull saw the muleta. It was a bright scarlet under the arc-light.\r\nThe bull\xe2\x80\x99s legs tightened.\r\n\r\nHere he comes. Whoosh! Manuel turned as the bull came and raised the\r\nmuleta so that it passed over the bull\xe2\x80\x99s horns and swept down his broad\r\nback from head to tail. The bull had gone clean up in the air with the\r\ncharge. Manuel had not moved.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the pass the bull turned like a cat coming around a corner\r\nand faced Manuel.\r\n\r\nHe was on the offensive again. His heaviness was gone. Manuel noted the\r\nfresh blood shining down the black shoulder and dripping down the bull\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleg. He drew the sword out of the muleta and held it in his right hand.\r\nThe muleta held low down in his left hand, leaning toward the left, he\r\ncalled to the bull. The bull\xe2\x80\x99s legs tightened, his eyes on the muleta.\r\nHere he comes, Manuel thought. Yuh!\r\n\r\nHe swung with the charge, sweeping the muleta ahead of the bull, his\r\nfeet firm, the sword following the curve, a point of light under the\r\narcs.\r\n\r\nThe bull recharged as the pase natural finished and Manuel raised the\r\nmuleta for a pase de pecho. Firmly planted, the bull came by his chest\r\nunder the raised muleta. Manuel leaned his head back to avoid the\r\nclattering banderillo shafts. The hot, black bull body touched his chest\r\nas it passed.\r\n\r\nToo damn close, Manuel thought. Zurito, leaning on the barrera, spoke\r\nrapidly to the gypsy, who trotted out toward Manuel with a cape. Zurito\r\npulled his hat down low and looked out across the arena at Manuel.\r\n\r\nManuel was facing the bull again, the muleta held low and to the left.\r\nThe bull\xe2\x80\x99s head was down as he watched the muleta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was Belmonte doing that stuff, they\xe2\x80\x99d go crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nZurito said nothing. He was watching Manuel out in the centre of the\r\narena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did the boss dig this fellow up?\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s going damn quick,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man said.\r\n\r\nZurito turned on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock on that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the barrera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just kidding, man,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock on the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana\xe2\x80\x99s man leaned forward and knocked three times on the barrera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch the faena,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\nOut in the centre of the ring, under the lights, Manuel was kneeling,\r\nfacing the bull, and as he raised the muleta in both hands the bull\r\ncharged, tail up.\r\n\r\nManuel swung his body clear and, as the bull recharged, brought around\r\nthe muleta in a half-circle that pulled the bull to his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that one\xe2\x80\x99s a great bull-fighter,\xe2\x80\x9d Retana\xe2\x80\x99s man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zurito.\r\n\r\nManuel stood up and, the muleta in his left hand, the sword in his\r\nright, acknowledged the applause from the dark plaza.\r\n\r\nThe bull had humped himself up from his knees and stood waiting, his\r\nhead hung low.\r\n\r\nZurito spoke to two of the other lads of the cuadrilla and they ran out\r\nto stand back of Manuel with their capes. There were four men back of\r\nhim now. Hernandez had followed him since he first came out with the\r\nmuleta. Fuentes stood watching, his cape held against his body, tall, in\r\nrepose, watching lazy-eyed. Now the two came up. Hernandez motioned them\r\nto stand one at each side. Manuel stood alone, facing the bull.\r\n\r\nManuel waved back the men with the capes. Stepping back cautiously, they\r\nsaw his face was white and sweating.\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t they know enough to keep back? Did they want to catch the bull\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye with the capes after he was fixed and ready? He had enough to worry\r\nabout without that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThe bull was standing, his four feet square, looking at the muleta.\r\nManuel furled the muleta in his left hand. The bull\xe2\x80\x99s eyes watched it.\r\nHis body was heavy on his feet. He carried his head low, but not too\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nManuel lifted the muleta at him. The bull did not move. Only his eyes\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s all lead, Manuel thought. He\xe2\x80\x99s all square. He\xe2\x80\x99s framed right. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\nHe thought in bull-fight terms. Sometimes he had a thought and the\r\nparticular piece of slang would not come into his mind and he could not\r\nrealize the thought. His instincts and his knowledge worked\r\nautomatically, and his brain worked slowly and in words. He knew all\r\nabout bulls. He did not have to think about them. He just did the right\r\nthing. His eyes noted things and his body performed the necessary\r\nmeasures without thought. If he thought about it, he would be gone.\r\n\r\nNow, facing the bull, he was conscious of many things at the same time.\r\nThere were the horns, the one splintered, the other smoothly sharp, the\r\nneed to profile himself toward the left horn, lance himself short and\r\nstraight, lower the muleta so the bull would follow it, and, going in\r\nover the horns, put the sword all the way into a little spot about as\r\nbig as a five-peseta piece straight in back of the neck, between the\r\nsharp pitch of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. He must do all this and must then\r\ncome out from between the horns. He was conscious he must do all this,\r\nbut his only thought was in words: \xe2\x80\x9cCorto y derecho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorto y derecho,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, furling the muleta. Short and straight.\r\nCorto y derecho, he drew the sword out of the muleta, profiled on the\r\nsplintered left horn, dropped the muleta across his body, so his right\r\nhand with the sword on the level with his eye made the sign of the\r\ncross, and, rising on his toes, sighted along the dipping blade of the\r\nsword at the spot high up between the bull\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\n\r\nCorto y derecho he lanced himself on the bull.\r\n\r\nThere was a shock, and he felt himself go up in the air. He pushed on\r\nthe sword as he went up and over, and it flew out of his hand. He hit\r\nthe ground and the bull was on him. Manuel, lying on the ground, kicked\r\nat the bull\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle with his slippered feet. Kicking, kicking, the bull\r\nafter him, missing him in his excitement, bumping him with his head,\r\ndriving the horns into the sand. Kicking like a man keeping a ball in\r\nthe air, Manuel kept the bull from getting a clean thrust at him.\r\n\r\nManuel felt the wind on his back from the capes flopping at the bull,\r\nand then the bull was gone, gone over him in a rush. Dark, as his belly\r\nwent over. Not even stepped on.\r\n\r\nManuel stood up and picked up the muleta. Fuentes handed him the sword.\r\nIt was bent where it had struck the shoulder-blade. Manuel straightened\r\nit on his knee and ran toward the bull, standing now beside one of the\r\ndead horses. As he ran, his jacket flopped where it had been ripped\r\nunder his armpit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet him out of there,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel shouted to the gypsy. The bull had\r\nsmelled the blood of the dead horse and ripped into the canvas-cover\r\nwith his horns. He charged Fuentes\xe2\x80\x99s cape, with the canvas hanging from\r\nhis splintered horn, and the crowd laughed. Out in the ring, he tossed\r\nhis head to rid himself of the canvas. Hernandez, running up from behind\r\nhim, grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly lifted it off the horn.\r\n\r\nThe bull followed it in a half-charge and stopped still. He was on the\r\ndefensive again. Manuel was walking toward him with the sword and\r\nmuleta. Manuel swung the muleta before him. The bull would not charge.\r\n\r\nManuel profiled toward the bull, sighting along the dipping blade of the\r\nsword. The bull was motionless, seemingly dead on his feet, incapable of\r\nanother charge.\r\n\r\nManuel rose to his toes, sighting along the steel, and charged.\r\n\r\nAgain there was the shock and he felt himself being borne back in a\r\nrush, to strike hard on the sand. There was no chance of kicking this\r\ntime. The bull was on top of him. Manuel lay as though dead, his head on\r\nhis arms, and the bull bumped him. Bumped his back, bumped his face in\r\nthe sand. He felt the horn go into the sand between his folded arms. The\r\nbull hit him in the small of the back. His face drove into the sand. The\r\nhorn drove through one of his sleeves and the bull ripped it off. Manuel\r\nwas tossed clear and the bull followed the capes.\r\n\r\nManuel got up, found the sword and muleta, tried the point of the sword\r\nwith his thumb, and then ran toward the barrera for a new sword.\r\n\r\nRetana\xe2\x80\x99s man handed him the sword over the edge of the barrera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWipe off your face,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nManuel, running again toward the bull, wiped his bloody face with his\r\nhandkerchief. He had not seen Zurito. Where was Zurito?\r\n\r\nThe cuadrilla had stepped away from the bull and waited with their\r\ncapes. The bull stood, heavy and dull again after the action.\r\n\r\nManuel walked toward him with the muleta. He stopped and shook it. The\r\nbull did not respond. He passed it right and left, left and right before\r\nthe bull\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle. The bull\xe2\x80\x99s eyes watched it and turned with the swing,\r\nbut he would not charge. He was waiting for Manuel.\r\n\r\nManuel was worried. There was nothing to do but go in. Corto y derecho.\r\nHe profiled close to the bull, crossed the muleta in front of his body\r\nand charged. As he pushed in the sword, he jerked his body to the left\r\nto clear the horn. The bull passed him and the sword shot up in the air,\r\ntwinkling under the arc-lights, to fall red-hilted on the sand.\r\n\r\nManuel ran over and picked it up. It was bent and he straightened it\r\nover his knee.\r\n\r\nAs he came running toward the bull, fixed again now, he passed Hernandez\r\nstanding with his cape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all bone,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said encouragingly.\r\n\r\nManuel nodded, wiping his face. He put the bloody handkerchief in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThere was the bull. He was close to the barrera now. Damn him. Maybe he\r\nwas all bone. Maybe there was not any place for the sword to go in. The\r\nhell there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t! He\xe2\x80\x99d show them.\r\n\r\nHe tried a pass with the muleta and the bull did not move. Manuel\r\nchopped the muleta back and forth in front of the bull. Nothing doing.\r\n\r\nHe furled the muleta, drew the sword out, profiled and drove in on the\r\nbull. He felt the sword buckle as he shoved it in, leaning his weight on\r\nit, and then it shot high in the air, end-over-ending into the crowd.\r\nManuel had jerked clear as the sword jumped.\r\n\r\nThe first cushions thrown down out of the dark missed him. Then one hit\r\nhim in the face, his bloody face looking toward the crowd. They were\r\ncoming down fast. Spotting the sand. Somebody threw an empty\r\nchampagne-bottle from close range. It hit Manuel on the foot. He stood\r\nthere watching the dark, where the things were coming from. Then\r\nsomething whished through the air and struck by him. Manuel leaned over\r\nand picked it up. It was his sword. He straightened it over his knee and\r\ngestured with it to the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, the dirty bastards! Dirty bastards! Oh, the lousy, dirty bastards!\r\nHe kicked into a cushion as he ran.\r\n\r\nThere was the bull. The same as ever. All right, you dirty, lousy\r\nbastard!\r\n\r\nManuel passed the muleta in front of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s black muzzle.\r\n\r\nNothing doing.\r\n\r\nYou won\xe2\x80\x99t! All right. He stepped close and jammed the sharp peak of the\r\nmuleta into the bull\xe2\x80\x99s damp muzzle.\r\n\r\nThe bull was on him as he jumped back and as he tripped on a cushion he\r\nfelt the horn go into him, into his side. He grabbed the horn with his\r\ntwo hands and rode backward, holding tight onto the place. The bull\r\ntossed him and he was clear. He lay still. It was all right. The bull\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHe got up coughing and feeling broken and gone. The dirty bastards!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the sword,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFuentes came up with the muleta and the sword.\r\n\r\nHernandez put his arm around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on to the infirmary, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a damn fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away from me,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet to hell away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe twisted free. Hernandez shrugged his shoulders. Manuel ran toward the\r\nbull.\r\n\r\nThere was the bull standing, heavy, firmly planted.\r\n\r\nAll right, you bastard! Manuel drew the sword out of the muleta, sighted\r\nwith the same movement, and flung himself onto the bull. He felt the\r\nsword go in all the way. Right up to the guard. Four fingers and his\r\nthumb into the bull. The blood was hot on his knuckles, and he was on\r\ntop of the bull.\r\n\r\nThe bull lurched with him as he lay on, and seemed to sink; then he was\r\nstanding clear. He looked at the bull going down slowly over on his\r\nside, then suddenly four feet in the air.\r\n\r\nThen he gestured at the crowd, his hand warm from the bull blood.\r\n\r\nAll right, you bastards! He wanted to say something, but he started to\r\ncough. It was hot and choking. He looked down for the muleta. He must go\r\nover and salute the president. President hell! He was sitting down\r\nlooking at something. It was the bull. His four feet up. Thick tongue\r\nout. Things crawling around on his belly and under his legs. Crawling\r\nwhere the hair was thin. Dead bull. To hell with the bull! To hell with\r\nthem all! He started to get to his feet and commenced to cough. He sat\r\ndown again, coughing. Somebody came and pushed him up.\r\n\r\nThey carried him across the ring to the infirmary, running with him\r\nacross the sand, standing blocked at the gate as the mules came in, then\r\naround under the dark passageway, men grunting as they took him up the\r\nstairway, and then laid him down.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and two men in white were waiting for him. They laid him out\r\non the table. They were cutting away his shirt. Manuel felt tired. His\r\nwhole chest felt scalding inside. He started to cough and they held\r\nsomething to his mouth. Everybody was very busy.\r\n\r\nThere was an electric light in his eyes. He shut his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe heard some one coming very heavily up the stairs. Then he did not\r\nhear it. Then he heard a noise far off. That was the crowd. Well,\r\nsomebody would have to kill his other bull. They had cut away all his\r\nshirt. The doctor smiled at him. There was Retana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Retana!\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. He could not hear his voice.\r\n\r\nRetana smiled at him and said something. Manuel could not hear it.\r\n\r\nZurito stood beside the table, bending over where the doctor was\r\nworking. He was in his picador clothes, without his hat.\r\n\r\nZurito said something to him. Manuel could not hear it.\r\n\r\nZurito was speaking to Retana. One of the men in white smiled and handed\r\nRetana a pair of scissors. Retana gave them to Zurito. Zurito said\r\nsomething to Manuel. He could not hear it.\r\n\r\nTo hell with this operating-table! He\xe2\x80\x99d been on plenty of\r\noperating-tables before. He was not going to die. There would be a\r\npriest if he was going to die.\r\n\r\nZurito was saying something to him. Holding up the scissors.\r\n\r\nThat was it. They were going to cut off his coleta. They were going to\r\ncut off his pigtail.\r\n\r\nManuel sat up on the operating-table. The doctor stepped back, angry.\r\nSome one grabbed him and held him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing like that, Manos,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe heard suddenly, clearly, Zurito\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I was joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going good,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any luck. That was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel lay back. They had put something over his face. It was all\r\nfamiliar. He inhaled deeply. He felt very tired. He was very, very\r\ntired. They took the thing away from his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going good,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was going great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRetana looked at Zurito and started for the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Zurito said.\r\n\r\nRetana shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nManuel opened his eyes and looked at Zurito.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t I going good, Manos?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, for confirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zurito. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were going great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s assistant put the cone over Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s face and he inhaled\r\ndeeply. Zurito stood awkwardly, watching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN ANOTHER COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more.\r\nIt was cold in the fall in Milan and the dark came very early. Then the\r\nelectric lights came on, and it was pleasant along the streets looking\r\nin the windows. There was much game hanging outside the shops, and the\r\nsnow powdered in the fur of the foxes and the wind blew their tails. The\r\ndeer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small birds blew in the wind\r\nand the wind turned their feathers. It was a cold fall and the wind came\r\ndown from the mountains.\r\n\r\nWe were all at the hospital every afternoon, and there were different\r\nways of walking across the town through the dusk to the hospital. Two of\r\nthe ways were alongside canals, but they were long. Always, though, you\r\ncrossed a bridge across a canal to enter the hospital. There was a\r\nchoice of three bridges. On one of them a woman sold roasted chestnuts.\r\nIt was warm, standing in front of her charcoal fire, and the chestnuts\r\nwere warm afterward in your pocket. The hospital was very old and very\r\nbeautiful, and you entered through a gate and walked across a courtyard\r\nand out a gate on the other side. There were usually funerals starting\r\nfrom the courtyard. Beyond the old hospital were the new brick\r\npavilions, and there we met every afternoon and were all very polite and\r\ninterested in what was the matter, and sat in the machines that were to\r\nmake so much difference.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came up to the machine where I was sitting and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndid you like best to do before the war? Did you practise a sport?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, football.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be able to play football again better than\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy knee did not bend and the leg dropped straight from the knee to the\r\nankle without a calf, and the machine was to bend the knee and make it\r\nmove as in riding a tricycle. But it did not bend yet, and instead the\r\nmachine lurched when it came to the bending part. The doctor said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwill all pass. You are a fortunate young man. You will play football\r\nagain like a champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the next machine was a major who had a little hand like a baby\xe2\x80\x99s. He\r\nwinked at me when the doctor examined his hand, which was between two\r\nleather straps that bounced up and down and flapped the stiff fingers,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will I too play football, captain-doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d He had been a\r\nvery great fencer, and before the war the greatest fencer in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe doctor went to his office in a back room and brought a photograph\r\nwhich showed a hand that had been withered almost as small as the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s, before it had taken a machine course, and after was a little\r\nlarger. The major held the photograph with his good hand and looked at\r\nit very carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cA wound?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn industrial accident,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery interesting, very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said, and handed it back\r\nto the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have confidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major.\r\n\r\nThere were three boys who came each day who were about the same age I\r\nwas. They were all three from Milan, and one of them was to be a lawyer,\r\nand one was to be a painter, and one had intended to be a soldier, and\r\nafter we were finished with the machines, sometimes we walked back\r\ntogether to the Caf\xc3\xa9 Cova, which was next door to the Scala. We walked\r\nthe short way through the communist quarter because we were four\r\ntogether. The people hated us because we were officers, and from a\r\nwine-shop some one would call out, \xe2\x80\x9cA basso gli ufficiali!\xe2\x80\x9d as we\r\npassed. Another boy who walked with us sometimes and made us five wore a\r\nblack silk handkerchief across his face because he had no nose then and\r\nhis face was to be rebuilt. He had gone out to the front from the\r\nmilitary academy and been wounded within an hour after he had gone into\r\nthe front line for the first time. They rebuilt his face, but he came\r\nfrom a very old family and they could never get the nose exactly right.\r\nHe went to South America and worked in a bank. But this was a long time\r\nago, and then we did not any of us know how it was going to be\r\nafterward. We only knew then that there was always the war, but that we\r\nwere not going to it any more.\r\n\r\nWe all had the same medals, except the boy with the black silk bandage\r\nacross his face, and he had not been at the front long enough to get any\r\nmedals. The tall boy with a very pale face who was to be a lawyer had\r\nbeen a lieutenant of Arditi and had three medals of the sort we each had\r\nonly one of. He had lived a very long time with death and was a little\r\ndetached. We were all a little detached, and there was nothing that held\r\nus together except that we met every afternoon at the hospital.\r\nAlthough, as we walked to the Cova through the tough part of town,\r\nwalking in the dark, with light and singing coming out of the\r\nwine-shops, and sometimes having to walk into the street when the men\r\nand women would crowd together on the sidewalk so that we would have had\r\nto jostle them to get by, we felt held together by there being something\r\nthat had happened that they, the people who disliked us, did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves all understood the Cova, where it was rich and warm and not\r\ntoo brightly lighted, and noisy and smoky at certain hours, and there\r\nwere always girls at the tables and the illustrated papers on a rack on\r\nthe wall. The girls at the Cova were very patriotic, and I found that\r\nthe most patriotic people in Italy were the caf\xc3\xa9 girls\xe2\x80\x94and I believe\r\nthey are still patriotic.\r\n\r\nThe boys at first were very polite about my medals and asked me what I\r\nhad done to get them. I showed them the papers, which were written in\r\nvery beautiful language and full of _fratellanza_ and _abnegazione_, but\r\nwhich really said, with the adjectives removed, that I had been given\r\nthe medals because I was an American. After that their manner changed a\r\nlittle toward me, although I was their friend against outsiders. I was a\r\nfriend, but I was never really one of them after they had read the\r\ncitations, because it had been different with them and they had done\r\nvery different things to get their medals. I had been wounded, it was\r\ntrue; but we all knew that being wounded, after all, was really an\r\naccident. I was never ashamed of the ribbons, though, and sometimes,\r\nafter the cocktail hour, I would imagine myself having done all the\r\nthings they had done to get their medals; but walking home at night\r\nthrough the empty streets with the cold wind and all the shops closed,\r\ntrying to keep near the street lights, I knew that I would never have\r\ndone such things, and I was very much afraid to die, and often lay in\r\nbed at night by myself, afraid to die and wondering how I would be when\r\nI went back to the front again.\r\n\r\nThe three with the medals were like hunting-hawks; and I was not a hawk,\r\nalthough I might seem a hawk to those who had never hunted; they, the\r\nthree, knew better and so we drifted apart. But I stayed good friends\r\nwith the boy who had been wounded his first day at the front, because he\r\nwould never know now how he would have turned out; so he could never be\r\naccepted either, and I liked him because I thought perhaps he would not\r\nhave turned out to be a hawk either.\r\n\r\nThe major, who had been the great fencer, did not believe in bravery,\r\nand spent much time while we sat in the machines correcting my grammar.\r\nHe had complimented me on how I spoke Italian, and we talked together\r\nvery easily. One day I had said that Italian seemed such an easy\r\nlanguage to me that I could not take a great interest in it; everything\r\nwas so easy to say. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, do you not\r\ntake up the use of grammar?\xe2\x80\x9d So we took up the use of grammar, and soon\r\nItalian was such a difficult language that I was afraid to talk to him\r\nuntil I had the grammar straight in my mind.\r\n\r\nThe major came very regularly to the hospital. I do not think he ever\r\nmissed a day, although I am sure he did not believe in the machines.\r\nThere was a time when none of us believed in the machines, and one day\r\nthe major said it was all nonsense. The machines were new then and it\r\nwas we who were to prove them. It was an idiotic idea, he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ntheory, like another.\xe2\x80\x9d I had not learned my grammar, and he said I was a\r\nstupid impossible disgrace, and he was a fool to have bothered with me.\r\nHe was a small man and he sat straight up in his chair with his right\r\nhand thrust into the machine and looked straight ahead at the wall while\r\nthe straps thumped up and down with his fingers in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do when the war is over if it is over?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak grammatically!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I hope to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more of a fool you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He seemed very angry. \xe2\x80\x9cA man must\r\nnot marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Signor Maggiore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me \xe2\x80\x98Signor Maggiore.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must not a man marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot marry. He cannot marry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is to lose\r\neverything, he should not place himself in a position to lose that. He\r\nshould not place himself in a position to lose. He should find things he\r\ncannot lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke very angrily and bitterly, and looked straight ahead while he\r\ntalked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should he necessarily lose it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. He was looking at the wall. Then he\r\nlooked down at the machine and jerked his little hand out from between\r\nthe straps and slapped it hard against his thigh. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nalmost shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t argue with me!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he called to the attendant\r\nwho ran the machines. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and turn this damned thing off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back into the other room for the light treatment and the\r\nmassage. Then I heard him ask the doctor if he might use his telephone\r\nand he shut the door. When he came back into the room, I was sitting in\r\nanother machine. He was wearing his cape and had his cap on, and he came\r\ndirectly toward my machine and put his arm on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and patted me on the shoulder with his good\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not be rude. My wife has just died. You must forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I said, feeling sick for him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am _so_ sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood there biting his lower lip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot resign myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked straight past me and out through the window. Then he began to\r\ncry. \xe2\x80\x9cI am utterly unable to resign myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and choked. And\r\nthen crying, his head up looking at nothing, carrying himself straight\r\nand soldierly, with tears on both his cheeks and biting his lips, he\r\nwalked past the machines and out the door.\r\n\r\nThe doctor told me that the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who was very young and whom he\r\nhad not married until he was definitely invalided out of the war, had\r\ndied of pneumonia. She had been sick only a few days. No one expected\r\nher to die. The major did not come to the hospital for three days. Then\r\nhe came at the usual hour, wearing a black band on the sleeve of his\r\nuniform. When he came back, there were large framed photographs around\r\nthe wall, of all sorts of wounds before and after they had been cured by\r\nthe machines. In front of the machine the major used were three\r\nphotographs of hands like his that were completely restored. I do not\r\nknow where the doctor got them. I always understood we were the first to\r\nuse the machines. The photographs did not make much difference to the\r\nmajor because he only looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HILLS LIKE WHITE ELEPHANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this\r\nside there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two\r\nlines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there\r\nwas the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of\r\nbamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies.\r\nThe American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside\r\nthe building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come\r\nin forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went\r\non to Madrid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we drink?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and\r\nput it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hot,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s drink beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDos cervezas,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said into the curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBig ones?\xe2\x80\x9d a woman asked from the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Two big ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the\r\nfelt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and\r\nthe girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white\r\nin the sun and the country was brown and dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look like white elephants,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one,\xe2\x80\x9d the man drank his beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because you say I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve painted something on it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnis del Toro. It\xe2\x80\x99s a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould we try it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man called \xe2\x80\x9cListen\xe2\x80\x9d through the curtain. The woman came out from the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour reales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want two Anis del Toro.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want it with water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it good with water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want them with water?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, with water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt tastes like licorice,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said and put the glass down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way with everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything tastes of licorice. Especially all the\r\nthings you\xe2\x80\x99ve waited so long for, like absinthe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cut it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou started it,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was being amused. I was having a\r\nfine time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s try and have a fine time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white\r\nelephants. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to try this new drink. That\xe2\x80\x99s all we do, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94look at\r\nthings and try new drinks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked across at the hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re lovely hills,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t really look like white\r\nelephants. I just meant the coloring of their skin through the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould we have another drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe beer\xe2\x80\x99s nice and cool,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nreally an operation at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, Jig. It\xe2\x80\x99s really not anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nto let the air in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl did not say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with you all the time. They just let the\r\nair in and then it\xe2\x80\x99s all perfectly natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what will we do afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine afterward. Just like we were before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that bothers us. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s made\r\nus unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of\r\ntwo of the strings of beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right and be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know we will. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known lots of people\r\nthat have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd afterward they were all so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you do it if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. But I know it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\nsimple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing to do. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do it if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t really want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I do it you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy and things will be like they were and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you now. You know I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are\r\nlike white elephants, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll love it. I love it now but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t think about it. You know\r\nhow I get when I worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do it you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever worry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that because it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I care about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about me. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it and then everything\r\nwill be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do it if you feel that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stood up and walked to the end of the station. Across, on the\r\nother side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro.\r\nFar away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved\r\nacross the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we could have all this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we could have everything\r\nand every day we make it more impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said we could have everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can have everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can have the whole world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can go everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we can\xe2\x80\x99t. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t ours any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. And once they take it away, you never get it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on back in the shade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any way,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just know things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor that isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know. Could we have another\r\nbeer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.

I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means\r\nanything to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it mean anything to you? We could get along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it does. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody but you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\none else. And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right for you to say that, but I do know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you do something for me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you please please please please please please please stop\r\ntalking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the\r\nstation. There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had\r\nspent nights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll scream,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said.\r\n\r\nThe woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put\r\nthem down on the damp felt pads. \xe2\x80\x9cThe train comes in five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the train is coming in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better take the bags over to the other side of the station,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nman said.

Then come back and we\xe2\x80\x99ll finish the beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to\r\nthe other tracks. He looked up the tracks but could not see the train.\r\nComing back, he walked through the barroom, where people waiting for the\r\ntrain were drinking. He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the\r\npeople. They were all waiting reasonably for the train. He went out\r\nthrough the bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and smiled at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel better?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel fine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE KILLERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE door of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s lunch-room opened and two men came in. They sat down\r\nat the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the men said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to eat, Al?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Al. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I want to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOutside it was getting dark. The street-light came on outside the\r\nwindow. The two men at the counter read the menu. From the other end of\r\nthe counter Nick Adams watched them. He had been talking to George when\r\nthey came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have a roast pork tenderloin with apple sauce and mashed\r\npotatoes,\xe2\x80\x9d the first man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell do you put it on the card for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d George explained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can get that at six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked at the clock on the wall behind the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clock says twenty minutes past five,\xe2\x80\x9d the second man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s twenty minutes fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to hell with the clock,\xe2\x80\x9d the first man said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got to\r\neat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give you any kind of sandwiches,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have ham\r\nand eggs, bacon and eggs, liver and bacon, or a steak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me chicken croquettes with green peas and cream sauce and mashed\r\npotatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything we want\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner, eh?

He wore a derby hat\r\nand a black overcoat buttoned across the chest. His face was small and\r\nwhite and he had tight lips. He wore a silk muffler and gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me bacon and eggs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other man. He was about the same size\r\nas Al. Their faces were different, but they were dressed like twins.\r\nBoth wore overcoats too tight for them. They sat leaning forward, their\r\nelbows on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot anything to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d Al asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilver beer, bevo, ginger-ale,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean you got anything to _drink_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust those I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a hot town,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver hear of it?\xe2\x80\x9d Al asked his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do here nights?\xe2\x80\x9d Al asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey eat the dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey all come here and eat the\r\nbig dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think that\xe2\x80\x99s right?\xe2\x80\x9d Al asked George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty bright boy, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other little man. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he, Al?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dumb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Al.

He set down two side-dishes of fried potatoes and\r\nclosed the wicket into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is yours?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Al.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHam and eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. He leaned forward and took the ham and\r\neggs. Both men ate with their gloves on. George watched them eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are _you_ looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d Max looked at George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell you were. You were looking at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the boy meant it for a joke, Max,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said.\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t have to laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said to him. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t have to laugh\r\nat all, see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d Max turned to Al. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright.

Nick went around behind the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of your damn business,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s out in the kitchen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nigger that cooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you think you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know damn well where we are,\xe2\x80\x9d the man called Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo we look\r\nsilly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk silly,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell do you argue with this\r\nkid for?

Use your head, bright boy. What would we do to a nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge opened the slit that opened back into the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x9cSam,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in here a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door to the kitchen opened and the nigger came in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. The two men at the counter took a look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, nigger. You stand right there,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said.\r\n\r\nSam, the nigger, standing in his apron, looked at the two men sitting at\r\nthe counter. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Al got down from his stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going back to the kitchen with the nigger and bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on back to the kitchen, nigger. You go with him, bright boy.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlittle man walked after Nick and Sam, the cook, back into the kitchen.\r\nThe door shut after them. The man called Max sat at the counter opposite\r\nGeorge. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at George but looked in the mirror that ran along\r\nback of the counter. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s had been made over from a saloon into a\r\nlunch-counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said, looking into the mirror, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsay something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Al,\xe2\x80\x9d Max called, \xe2\x80\x9cbright boy wants to know what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d Al\xe2\x80\x99s voice came from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMax looked into the mirror all the time he was talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Al, bright boy says he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say what he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hear you, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said from the kitchen. He had propped\r\nopen the slit that dishes passed through into the kitchen with a catsup\r\nbottle. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said from the kitchen to George. \xe2\x80\x9cStand\r\na little further along the bar. You move a little to the left, Max.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas like a photographer arranging for a group picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk to me, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nhappen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge did not say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to kill a Swede. Do you know a\r\nbig Swede named Ole Andreson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe comes here to eat every night, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes he comes here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe comes here at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know all that, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk about something else.\r\nEver go to the movies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to go to the movies more. The movies are fine for a bright\r\nboy like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to kill Ole Andreson for? What did he ever do to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never had a chance to do anything to us. He never even seen us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s only going to see us once,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to kill him for, then?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re killing him for a friend. Just to oblige a friend, bright boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Al from the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk too goddam much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I got to keep bright boy amused. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I, bright boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk too damn much,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe nigger and my bright boy are\r\namused by themselves. I got them tied up like a couple of girl friends\r\nin the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you were in a convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were in a kosher convent. That\xe2\x80\x99s where you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked up at the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anybody comes in you tell them the cook is off, and if they keep\r\nafter it, you tell them you\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and cook yourself. Do you get\r\nthat, bright boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you going to do with us afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll depend,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of those things you never know\r\nat the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked up at the clock. It was a quarter past six. The door from\r\nthe street opened. A street-car motorman came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, George,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I get supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam\xe2\x80\x99s gone out,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in about half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better go up the street,\xe2\x80\x9d the motorman said. George looked at the\r\nclock. It was twenty minutes past six.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was nice, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a regular little\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew I\xe2\x80\x99d blow his head off,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Max. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t that. Bright boy is nice. He\xe2\x80\x99s a nice boy. I\r\nlike him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt six-fifty-five George said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo other people had been in the lunch-room. Once George had gone out to\r\nthe kitchen and made a ham-and-egg sandwich \xe2\x80\x9cto go\xe2\x80\x9d that a man wanted to\r\ntake with him. Inside the kitchen he saw Al, his derby hat tipped back,\r\nsitting on a stool beside the wicket with the muzzle of a sawed-off\r\nshotgun resting on the ledge. Nick and the cook were back to back in the\r\ncorner, a towel tied in each of their mouths. George had cooked the\r\nsandwich, wrapped it up in oiled paper, put it in a bag, brought it in,\r\nand the man had paid for it and gone out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBright boy can do everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can cook and everything.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d make some girl a nice wife, bright boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, Ole Andreson, isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give him ten minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said.\r\n\r\nMax watched the mirror and the clock. The hands of the clock marked\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then five minutes past seven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Al,\xe2\x80\x9d said Max. \xe2\x80\x9cWe better go. He\xe2\x80\x99s not coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter give him five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nIn the five minutes a man came in, and George explained that the cook\r\nwas sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the hell don\xe2\x80\x99t you get another cook?\xe2\x80\x9d the man asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nrunning a lunch-counter?\xe2\x80\x9d He went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Al,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the two bright boys and the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. We\xe2\x80\x99re through with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Al. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sloppy. You talk too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what the hell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Max. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got to keep amused, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk too much, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Al said. He came out from the\r\nkitchen. The cut-off barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge under\r\nthe waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat. He straightened his coat\r\nwith his gloved hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long, bright boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to George. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got a lot of luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Max said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to play the races, bright boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two of them went out the door. George watched them, through the\r\nwindow, pass under the arc-light and cross the street. In their tight\r\novercoats and derby hats they looked like a vaudeville team. George went\r\nback through the swinging-door into the kitchen and untied Nick and the\r\ncook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, the cook. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\nmore of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick stood up. He had never had a towel in his mouth before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell?\xe2\x80\x9d He was trying to swagger it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were going to kill Ole Andreson,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were going to\r\nshoot him when he came in to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOle Andreson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook felt the corners of his mouth with his thumbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all gone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re gone now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cook. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like any of it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d George said to Nick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou better go see Ole Andreson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better not have anything to do with it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam, the cook,\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou better stay way out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMixing up in this ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to get you anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d the cook said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nstay out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go see him,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said to George. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle boys always know what they want to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives up at Hirsch\xe2\x80\x99s rooming-house,\xe2\x80\x9d George said to Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOutside the arc-light shone through the bare branches of a tree. Nick\r\nwalked up the street beside the car-tracks and turned at the next\r\narc-light down a side-street. Three houses up the street was Hirsch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrooming-house. Nick walked up the two steps and pushed the bell. A woman\r\ncame to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Ole Andreson here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he\xe2\x80\x99s in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick followed the woman up a flight of stairs and back to the end of a\r\ncorridor. She knocked on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s somebody to see you, Mr. Andreson,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Nick Adams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick opened the door and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on\r\nthe bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter\r\nand he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He\r\ndid not look at Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was up at Henry\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said, \xe2\x80\x9cand two fellows came in and tied up\r\nme and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey put us out in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were going to\r\nshoot you when you came in to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOle Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge thought I better come and tell you about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything I can do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ole Andreson said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what they were like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what they were like,\xe2\x80\x9d Ole Andreson said. He looked\r\nat the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for coming to tell me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick looked at the big man lying on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want me to go and see the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Ole Andreson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there something I could do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it was just a bluff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t just a bluff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOle Andreson rolled over toward the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, talking toward the wall, \xe2\x80\x9cI just can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake up my mind to go out. I been in here all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you get out of town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Ole Andreson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m through with all that running around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you fix it up some way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I got in wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d He talked in the same flat voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything to do. After a while I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up my mind to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better go back and see George,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Andreson. He did not look toward Nick. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for\r\ncoming around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick went out. As he shut the door he saw Ole Andreson with all his\r\nclothes on, lying on the bed looking at the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been in his room all day,\xe2\x80\x9d the landlady said downstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well. I said to him: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Andreson, you ought to go out\r\nand take a walk on a nice fall day like this,\xe2\x80\x99 but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry he don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully nice\r\nman. He was in the ring, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d never know it except from the way his face is,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said.\r\nThey stood talking just inside the street door. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just as gentle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night, Mrs. Hirsch,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not Mrs. Hirsch,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe owns the place. I just look\r\nafter it for her. I\xe2\x80\x99m Mrs. Bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night, Mrs. Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said.\r\n\r\nNick walked up the dark street to the corner under the arc-light, and\r\nthen along the car-tracks to Henry\xe2\x80\x99s eating-house. George was inside,\r\nback of the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see Ole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nick. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in his room and he won\xe2\x80\x99t go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook opened the door from the kitchen when he heard Nick\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even listen to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell him about it?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. I told him but he knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess they will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have got mixed up in something in Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awful thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\nThey did not say anything. George reached down for a towel and wiped the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what he did?\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDouble-crossed somebody. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they kill them for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out of this town,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand to think about him waiting in the room and knowing he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to get it. It\xe2\x80\x99s too damned awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cyou better not think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHE TI DICE LA PATRIA?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE road of the pass was hard and smooth and not yet dusty in the early\r\nmorning. Below were the hills with oak and chestnut trees, and far away\r\nbelow was the sea. On the other side were snowy mountains.\r\n\r\nWe came down from the pass through wooded country. There were bags of\r\ncharcoal piled beside the road, and through the trees we saw\r\ncharcoal-burners\xe2\x80\x99 huts. It was Sunday and the road, rising and falling,\r\nbut always dropping away from the altitude of the pass, went through the\r\nscrub woods and through villages.\r\n\r\nOutside the villages there were fields with vines. The fields were brown\r\nand the vines coarse and thick. The houses were white, and in the\r\nstreets the men, in their Sunday clothes, were playing bowls. Against\r\nthe walls of some of the houses there were pear trees, their branches\r\ncandelabraed against the white walls. The pear trees had been sprayed,\r\nand the walls of the houses were stained a metallic blue-green by the\r\nspray vapor. There were small clearings around the villages where the\r\nvines grew, and then the woods.\r\n\r\nIn a village, twenty kilometres above Spezia, there was a crowd in the\r\nsquare, and a young man carrying a suitcase came up to the car and asked\r\nus to take him in to Spezia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are only two places, and they are occupied,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. We had an\r\nold Ford coup\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ride on the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes nothing. I must go to Spezia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould we take him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be going anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said. The young man handed in a\r\nparcel through the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook after this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Two men tied his suitcase on the back of the\r\ncar, above our suitcases. He shook hands with every one, explained that\r\nto a Fascist and a man as used to travelling as himself there was no\r\ndiscomfort, and climbed up on the running-board on the left-hand side of\r\nthe car, holding on inside, his right arm through the open window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can start,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The crowd waved. He waved with his free hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we could start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he nice?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\nThe road followed a river. Across the river were mountains. The sun was\r\ntaking the frost out of the grass. It was bright and cold and the air\r\ncame cold through the open wind-shield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think he likes it out there?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy was looking up the road.\r\nHis view out of his side of the car was blocked by our guest. The young\r\nman projected from the side of the car like the figurehead of a ship. He\r\nhad turned his coat collar up and pulled his hat down and his nose\r\nlooked cold in the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll get enough of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the side our bum\r\ntire\xe2\x80\x99s on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99d leave us if we blew out,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get his\r\ntravelling-clothes dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept the way he leans out on the\r\nturns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woods were gone; the road had left the river to climb; the radiator\r\nwas boiling; the young man looked annoyedly and suspiciously at the\r\nsteam and rusty water; the engine was grinding, with both Guy\xe2\x80\x99s feet on\r\nthe first-speed pedal, up and up, back and forth and up, and, finally,\r\nout level. The grinding stopped, and in the new quiet there was a great\r\nchurning bubbling in the radiator. We were at the top of the last range\r\nabove Spezia and the sea. The road descended with short, barely rounded\r\nturns. Our guest hung out on the turns and nearly pulled the top-heavy\r\ncar over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him not to,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Guy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his sense of\r\nself-preservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great Italian sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest Italian sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe came down around curves, through deep dust, the dust powdering the\r\nolive trees. Spezia spread below along the sea. The road flattened\r\noutside the town. Our guest put his head in the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Guy.\r\n\r\nWe slowed up, at the side of the road. The young man got down, went to\r\nthe back of the car and untied the suitcase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stop here, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t get into trouble carrying passengers,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cMy package.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI handed him the package. He reached in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do I owe you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man said, not \xe2\x80\x9cthank you,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthank you very\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthank you a thousand times,\xe2\x80\x9d all of which you formerly said\r\nin Italy to a man when he handed you a time-table or explained about a\r\ndirection. The young man uttered the lowest form of the word \xe2\x80\x9cthanks\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand looked after us suspiciously as Guy started the car. I waved my hand\r\nat him. He was too dignified to reply. We went on into Spezia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a young man that will go a long way in Italy,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guy, \xe2\x80\x9che went twenty kilometres with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A MEAL IN SPEZIA\r\n\r\nWe came into Spezia looking for a place to eat. The street was wide and\r\nthe houses high and yellow. We followed the tram-track into the centre\r\nof town. On the walls of the houses were stencilled eye-bugging\r\nportraits of Mussolini, with hand-painted \xe2\x80\x9cvivas,\xe2\x80\x9d the double V in black\r\npaint with drippings of paint down the wall. Side-streets went down to\r\nthe harbor. It was bright and the people were all out for Sunday. The\r\nstone paving had been sprinkled and there were damp stretches in the\r\ndust. We went close to the curb to avoid a tram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s eat somewhere simple,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\nWe stopped opposite two restaurant signs. We were standing across the\r\nstreet and I was buying the papers. The two restaurants were side by\r\nside. A woman standing in the doorway of one smiled at us and we crossed\r\nthe street and went in.\r\n\r\nIt was dark inside and at the back of the room three girls were sitting\r\nat a table with an old woman. Across from us, at another table, sat a\r\nsailor. He sat there neither eating nor drinking. Further back, a young\r\nman in a blue suit was writing at a table. His hair was pomaded and\r\nshining and he was very smartly dressed and clean-cut looking.\r\n\r\nThe light came through the doorway, and through the window where\r\nvegetables, fruit, steaks, and chops were arranged in a show-case. A\r\ngirl came and took our order and another girl stood in the doorway. We\r\nnoticed that she wore nothing under her house dress. The girl who took\r\nour order put her arm around Guy\xe2\x80\x99s neck while we were looking at the\r\nmenu. There were three girls in all, and they all took turns going and\r\nstanding in the doorway. The old woman at the table in the back of the\r\nroom spoke to them and they sat down again with her.\r\n\r\nThere was no doorway leading from the room except into the kitchen. A\r\ncurtain hung over it. The girl who had taken our order came in from the\r\nkitchen with spaghetti. She put it on the table and brought a bottle of\r\nred wine and sat down at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Guy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wanted to eat some place simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t simple. This is complicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you Germans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth Germans,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe South Germans are a gentle, lovable\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the mechanics of this place?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I have to let her\r\nput her arm around my neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cMussolini has abolished the brothels. This is a\r\nrestaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl wore a one-piece dress. She leaned forward against the table\r\nand put her hands on her breasts and smiled. She smiled better on one\r\nside than on the other and turned the good side toward us. The charm of\r\nthe good side had been enhanced by some event which had smoothed the\r\nother side of her nose in, as warm wax can be smoothed. Her nose,\r\nhowever, did not look like warm wax. It was very cold and firmed, only\r\nsmoothed in. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe adores you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak Italian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIch spreche Deutsch,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and stroked Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to the lady in your native tongue, Guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPotsdam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will stay here now for a little while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this so dear Spezia?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her we have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guy. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her we are very ill, and have\r\nno money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend is a misogynist,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9can old German misogynist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you shut your mouth and get us out of here?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said. The lady\r\nhad placed another arm around his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him he is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you get us out of here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quarrelling,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not love one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are Germans,\xe2\x80\x9d I said proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cold South Germans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him he is a beautiful boy,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady said. Guy is thirty-eight and\r\ntakes some pride in the fact that he is taken for a travelling salesman\r\nin France. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a beautiful boy,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says so?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy asked, \xe2\x80\x9cyou or her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does. I\xe2\x80\x99m just your interpreter. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what you got me in on\r\nthis trip for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guy. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to leave you here\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Spezia\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpezia,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking about Spezia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely place,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my country,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSpezia is my home and Italy is my\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says that Italy is her country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her it looks like her country,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you for dessert?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFruit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBananas are all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got skins on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he takes bananas,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady said. She embraced Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, keeping his face out of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is pleased because you take bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her I don\xe2\x80\x99t take bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Signor does not take bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, crestfallen, \xe2\x80\x9che doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her I take a cold bath every morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Signor takes a cold bath every morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo understand,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady said.\r\n\r\nAcross from us, the property sailor had not moved. No one in the place\r\npaid any attention to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want the bill,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. You must stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d the clean-cut young man said from the table where he was\r\nwriting, \xe2\x80\x9clet them go. These two are worth nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady took my hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t stay? You won\xe2\x80\x99t ask him to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to get to Pisa, or if possible,\r\nFirenze, to-night. We can amuse ourselves in those cities at the end of\r\nthe day. It is now the day. In the day we must cover distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stay a little while is nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo travel is necessary during the light of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d the clean-cut young man said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother to talk with these\r\ntwo. I tell you they are worth nothing and I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring us the bill,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. She brought the bill from the old woman and\r\nwent back and sat at the table. Another girl came in from the kitchen.\r\nShe walked the length of the room and stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother with these two,\xe2\x80\x9d the clean-cut young man said in a wearied\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and eat. They are worth nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe paid the bill and stood up. All the girls, the old woman, and the\r\nclean-cut young man sat down at table together. The property sailor sat\r\nwith his head in his hands. No one had spoken to him all the time we\r\nwere at lunch. The girl brought us our change that the old woman counted\r\nout for her and went back to her place at the table. We left a tip on\r\nthe table and went out. When we were seated in the car ready to start,\r\nthe girl came out and stood in the door. We started and I waved to her.\r\nShe did not wave, but stood there looking after us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AFTER THE RAIN\r\n\r\nIt was raining hard when we passed through the suburbs of Genoa and,\r\neven going very slowly behind the tram-cars and the motor trucks, liquid\r\nmud splashed on to the sidewalks, so that people stepped into doorways\r\nas they saw us coming. In San Pier d\xe2\x80\x99Arena, the industrial suburb\r\noutside of Genoa, there is a wide street with two car-tracks and we\r\ndrove down the centre to avoid sending the mud on to the men going home\r\nfrom work. On our left was the Mediterranean. There was a big sea\r\nrunning and waves broke and the wind blew the spray against the car. A\r\nriver-bed that, when we had passed, going into Italy, had been wide,\r\nstony and dry, was running brown, and up to the banks. The brown water\r\ndiscolored the sea and as the waves thinned and cleared in breaking, the\r\nlight came through the yellow water and the crests, detached by the\r\nwind, blew across the road.\r\n\r\nA big car passed us, going fast, and a sheet of muddy water rose up and\r\nover our wind-shield and radiator. The automatic wind-shield cleaner\r\nmoved back and forth, spreading the film over the glass. We stopped and\r\nate lunch at Sestri. There was no heat in the restaurant and we kept our\r\nhats and coats on. We could see the car outside, through the window. It\r\nwas covered with mud and was stopped beside some boats that had been\r\npulled up beyond the waves. In the restaurant you could see your breath.\r\n\r\nThe _pasta asciuta_ was good; the wine tasted of alum, and we poured\r\nwater in it. Afterward the waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes.\r\nA man and a woman sat at the far end of the restaurant. He was\r\nmiddle-aged and she was young and wore black. All during the meal she\r\nwould blow out her breath in the cold damp air. The man would look at it\r\nand shake his head. They ate without talking and the man held her hand\r\nunder the table. She was good-looking and they seemed very sad. They had\r\na travelling-bag with them.\r\n\r\nWe had the papers and I read the account of the Shanghai fighting aloud\r\nto Guy. After the meal, he left with the waiter in search for a place\r\nwhich did not exist in the restaurant, and I cleaned off the\r\nwind-shield, the lights and the license plates with a rag. Guy came back\r\nand we backed the car out and started. The waiter had taken him across\r\nthe road and into an old house. The people in the house were suspicious\r\nand the waiter had remained with Guy to see nothing was stolen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how, me not being a plumber, they expected me to\r\nsteal anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\nAs we came up on a headland beyond the town, the wind struck the car and\r\nnearly tipped it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good it blows us away from the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey drowned Shelley somewhere along here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was down by Viareggio,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what we came to\r\nthis country for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of it to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can get past Ventimiglia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to drive this coast at night.\xe2\x80\x9d It was early\r\nafternoon and the sun was out. Below, the sea was blue with whitecaps\r\nrunning toward Savona. Back, beyond the cape, the brown and blue waters\r\njoined. Out ahead of us, a tramp steamer was going up the coast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you still see Genoa?\xe2\x80\x9d Guy asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat next big cape ought to put it out of sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see it a long time yet. I can still see Portofino Cape behind\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinally we could not see Genoa. I looked back as we came out and there\r\nwas only the sea, and below in the bay, a line of beach with\r\nfishing-boats and above, on the side of the hill, a town and then capes\r\nfar down the coast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s been gone a long time now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sure till we got way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sign with a picture of an S-turn and Svolta Pericolosa. The\r\nroad curved around the headland and the wind blew through the crack in\r\nthe wind-shield. Below the cape was a flat stretch beside the sea. The\r\nwind had dried the mud and the wheels were beginning to lift dust. On\r\nthe flat road we passed a Fascist riding a bicycle, a heavy revolver in\r\na holster on his back. He held the middle of the road on his bicycle and\r\nwe turned out for him. He looked up at us as we passed. Ahead there was\r\na railway crossing, and as we came toward it the gates went down.\r\n\r\nAs we waited, the Fascist came up on his bicycle. The train went by and\r\nGuy started the engine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d the bicycle man shouted from behind the car. \xe2\x80\x9cYour number\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got out with a rag. The number had been cleaned at lunch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can read it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot read it. It is dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wiped it off with the rag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five lire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could have read it. It\xe2\x80\x99s only dirty from the state\r\nof the roads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like Italian roads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty lire.\xe2\x80\x9d He spat in the road. \xe2\x80\x9cYour car is dirty and you are dirty\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. And give me a receipt with your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out a receipt-book, made in duplicate, and perforated, so one\r\nside could be given to the customer, and the other side filled in and\r\nkept as a stub. There was no carbon to record what the customer\xe2\x80\x99s ticket\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me fifty lire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote in indelible pencil, tore out the slip and handed it to me. I\r\nread it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is for twenty-five lire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and changed the twenty-five to fifty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now the other side. Make it fifty in the part you keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled a beautiful Italian smile and wrote something on the receipt\r\nstub, holding it so I could not see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore your number gets dirty again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe drove for two hours after it was dark and slept in Mentone that\r\nnight. It seemed very cheerful and clean and sane and lovely. We had\r\ndriven from Ventimiglia to Pisa and Florence, across the Romagna to\r\nRimini, back through Forli, Imola, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza and Genoa,\r\nto Ventimiglia again. The whole trip had only taken ten days. Naturally,\r\nin such a short trip, we had no opportunity to see how things were with\r\nthe country or the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FIFTY GRAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHOW are you going yourself, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seen this, Walcott?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust in the gym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a lot of luck with that boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t hit you, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d Soldier said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to hell he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit you with a handful of bird-shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBird-shot\xe2\x80\x99d be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind bird-shot any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks easy to hit,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says, \xe2\x80\x9che ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to last long. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to last\r\nlike you and me, Jerry. But right now he\xe2\x80\x99s got everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll left-hand him to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cSure. I got a chance to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandle him like you handled Kid Lewis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKid Lewis,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat kike!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three of us, Jack Brennan, Soldier Bartlett, and I were in\r\nHandley\xe2\x80\x99s. There were a couple of broads sitting at the next table to\r\nus. They had been drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, kike?\xe2\x80\x9d one of the broads says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean,\r\nkike, you big Irish bum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKikes,\xe2\x80\x9d this broad goes on. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about kikes, these\r\nbig Irishmen. What do you mean, kikes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKikes,\xe2\x80\x9d this broad goes on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever saw you ever buy a drink? Your\r\nwife sews your pockets up every morning. These Irishmen and their kikes!\r\nTed Lewis could lick you too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you give away a lot of things free too, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went out. That was Jack. He could say what he wanted to when he\r\nwanted to say it.\r\n\r\nJack started training out at Danny Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s health-farm over in Jersey.\r\nIt was nice out there but Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it much. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like being\r\naway from his wife and the kids, and he was sore and grouchy most of the\r\ntime. He liked me and we got along fine together; and he liked Hogan,\r\nbut after a while Soldier Bartlett commenced to get on his nerves. A\r\nkidder gets to be an awful thing around a camp if his stuff goes sort of\r\nsour. Soldier was always kidding Jack, just sort of kidding him all the\r\ntime. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very funny and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good, and it began to get\r\nto Jack. It was sort of stuff like this. Jack would finish up with the\r\nweights and the bag and pull on the gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to work?\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99d say to Soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. How you want me to work?\xe2\x80\x9d Soldier would ask. \xe2\x80\x9cWant me to treat\r\nyou rough like Walcott? Want me to knock you down a few times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack would say. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it any, though.\r\n\r\nOne morning we were all out on the road. We\xe2\x80\x99d been out quite a way and\r\nnow we were coming back. We\xe2\x80\x99d go along fast for three minutes and then\r\nwalk a minute, and then go fast for three minutes again. Jack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\never what you would call a sprinter. He\xe2\x80\x99d move around fast enough in the\r\nring if he had to, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any too fast on the road. All the time\r\nwe were walking Soldier was kidding him. We came up the hill to the\r\nfarmhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cyou better go back to town, Soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better go back to town and stay there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of hearing you talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d says Soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be a damn sight sicker when Walcott gets through with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe I will. But I know I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Soldier went off on the train to town that same morning. I went down\r\nwith him to the train. He was good and sore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just kidding him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. We were waiting on the platform. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t pull that stuff with me, Jerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s nervous and crabby,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow, Soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell he is. The hell he\xe2\x80\x99s ever been a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cso long, Soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train had come in. He climbed up with his bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long, Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou be in town before the fight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee you then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went in and the conductor swung up and the train went out. I rode\r\nback to the farm in the cart. Jack was on the porch writing a letter to\r\nhis wife. The mail had come and I got the papers and went over on the\r\nother side of the porch and sat down to read. Hogan came out the door\r\nand walked over to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he have a jam with Soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a jam,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just told him to go back to town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could see it coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never liked Soldier much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He don\xe2\x80\x99t like many people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty cold one,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s always been fine to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got no kick on him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a cold one, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHogan went in through the screen door and I sat there on the porch and\r\nread the papers. It was just starting to get fall weather and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice\r\ncountry there in Jersey, up in the hills, and after I read the paper\r\nthrough I sat there and looked out at the country and the road down\r\nbelow against the woods with cars going along it, lifting the dust up.\r\nIt was fine weather and pretty nice-looking country. Hogan came to the\r\ndoor and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Hogan, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you got anything to shoot out\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly sparrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeen the paper?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Hogan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSande booted three of them in yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got that on the telephone last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou follow them pretty close, Hogan?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I keep in touch with them,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he still play them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you see him doing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then Jack came around the corner with the letter in his hand. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwearing a sweater and an old pair of pants and boxing shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot a stamp, Hogan?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll mail it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t you used to play the ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you did. I knew I used to see you out at Sheepshead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you lay off them for?\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack sat down on the porch by me. He leaned back against a post. He shut\r\nhis eyes in the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant a chair?\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nice day,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty nice out in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d a damn sight rather be in town with the wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you only got another week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe sat there on the porch. Hogan was inside at the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think about the shape I\xe2\x80\x99m in?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got a week to get around into\r\nform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stall me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right in a couple of days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cI got the insomnia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s on your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI miss the wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave her come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m too old for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take a long walk before you turn in and get you good and tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired!\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was that way all week. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep at night and he\xe2\x80\x99d get up in\r\nthe morning feeling that way, you know, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t shut your hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s stale as poorhouse cake,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never seen Walcott,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll tear him in two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x99s got to get it sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like this, though,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll think he never trained. It\r\ngives the farm a black eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear what the reporters said about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I! They said he was awful. They said they oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to let him\r\nfight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re always wrong, ain\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this time they\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell do they know about whether a man\xe2\x80\x99s right or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re not such fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll they did was pick Willard at Toledo.

All he needs is to have Corbett pick him to win for\r\nit to be all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Corbett\xe2\x80\x99ll pick him,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. He\xe2\x80\x99ll pick him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep any either. The next morning was the last\r\nday before the fight. After breakfast we were out on the porch again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think about, Jack, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I worry,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI worry about property I got up in the Bronx,\r\nI worry about property I got in Florida. I worry about the kids. I worry\r\nabout the wife. Sometimes I think about fights. I think about that kike\r\nTed Lewis and I get sore. I got some stocks and I worry about them. What\r\nthe hell don\xe2\x80\x99t I think about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow night it\xe2\x80\x99ll all be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cThat always helps a lot, don\xe2\x80\x99t it? That just fixes\r\neverything all up, I suppose. Sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was sore all day. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t do any work. Jack just moved around a\r\nlittle to loosen up. He shadow-boxed a few rounds. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even look\r\ngood doing that. He skipped the rope a little while. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sweat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d be better not to do any work at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. We were standing\r\nwatching him skip rope. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t he ever sweat at all any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t sweat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s got the con? He never had any trouble making\r\nweight, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any con. He just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got anything inside any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to sweat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan.\r\n\r\nJack came over, skipping the rope. He was skipping up and down in front\r\nof us, forward and back, crossing his arms every third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you buzzards talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to work any more,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nstale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be awful?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says and skips away down the floor,\r\nslapping the rope hard.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon John Collins showed up out at the farm. Jack was up in\r\nhis room. John, came out in a car from town. He had a couple of friends\r\nwith him. The car stopped and they all got out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp in his room, lying down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLying down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the two fellows that were with John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re friends of his,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell,\xe2\x80\x9d said John. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Irishman could never sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell,\xe2\x80\x9d John said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s never right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had him for ten years and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s never been right yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fellows who were with him laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to shake hands with Mr. Morgan and Mr. Steinfelt,\xe2\x80\x9d John\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mr. Doyle. He\xe2\x80\x99s been training Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go up and see the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d the fellow called Morgan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at him,\xe2\x80\x9d Steinfelt said.\r\n\r\nWe all went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Hogan?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s out in the barn with a couple of his customers,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got many people out here now?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty quiet, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were outside Jack\xe2\x80\x99s room. John knocked on the door. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell\xe2\x80\x99s he sleeping in the daytime for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn turned the handle and we all went in. Jack was lying asleep on the\r\nbed. He was face down and his face was in the pillow. Both his arms were\r\naround the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Jack!\xe2\x80\x9d John said to him.\r\n\r\nJack\xe2\x80\x99s head moved a little on the pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cJack!\xe2\x80\x9d John says, leaning\r\nover him. Jack just dug a little deeper in the pillow. John touched him\r\non the shoulder. Jack sat up and looked at us. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t shaved and he\r\nwas wearing an old sweater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist! Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you let me sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d he says to John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be sore,\xe2\x80\x9d John says. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to wake you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Morgan and Steinfelt,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan asks him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the hell would I feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Steinfelt says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, don\xe2\x80\x99t I,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d he says to John. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re my manager.\r\nYou get a big enough cut. Why the hell don\xe2\x80\x99t you come out here when the\r\nreporters was out! You want Jerry and me to talk to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had Lew fighting in Philadelphia,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell\xe2\x80\x99s that to me?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re my manager. You get a\r\nbig enough cut, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You aren\xe2\x80\x99t making me any money in\r\nPhiladelphia, are you? Why the hell aren\xe2\x80\x99t you out here when I ought to\r\nhave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHogan was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHogan,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cHogan\xe2\x80\x99s as dumb as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoldier Bathlett was out here wukking with you for a while, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSteinfelt said to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was out here,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was out here all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d John said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you go and find Hogan and tell him\r\nwe want to see him in about half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the hell can\xe2\x80\x99t he stick around?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cStick around, Jerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorgan and Steinfelt looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet down, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d John said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better go find Hogan,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, if you want to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of these guys are going\r\nto send you away, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go find Hogan,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHogan was out in the gym in the barn. He had a couple of his health-farm\r\npatients with the gloves on. They neither one wanted to hit the other,\r\nfor fear the other would come back and hit him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said when he saw me come in. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can stop the\r\nslaughter. You gentlemen take a shower and Bruce will rub you down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey climbed out through the ropes and Hogan came over to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Collins is out with a couple of friends to see Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw them come up in the car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are the two fellows with John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re what you call wise boys,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know them\r\ntwo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Happy Steinfelt and Lew Morgan. They got a pool-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI been away a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Happy Steinfelt\xe2\x80\x99s a big operator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard his name,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty smooth boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a couple of\r\nsharpshooters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to see us in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see us until a half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on in the office,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with those sharpshooters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter about thirty minutes or so Hogan and I went upstairs. We knocked\r\non Jack\xe2\x80\x99s door. They were talking inside the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d somebody said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with that stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you want to see me I\xe2\x80\x99m down\r\nin the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe heard the door unlock. Steinfelt opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on in, Hogan,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all going to have a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went in. Jack was sitting on the bed. John and Morgan were sitting on\r\na couple of chairs. Steinfelt was standing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty mysterious lot of boys,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Danny,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Danny,\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan says and shakes hands.\r\n\r\nJack doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. He just sits there on the bed. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t with\r\nthe others. He\xe2\x80\x99s all by himself. He was wearing an old blue jersey and\r\npants and had on boxing shoes. He needed a shave. Steinfelt and Morgan\r\nwere dressers. John was quite a dresser too. Jack sat there looking\r\nIrish and tough.\r\n\r\nSteinfelt brought out a bottle and Hogan brought in some glasses and\r\neverybody had a drink. Jack and I took one and the rest of them went on\r\nand had two or three each.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter save some for your ride back,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry. We got plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan said.\r\n\r\nJack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t drunk anything since the one drink. He was standing up and\r\nlooking at them. Morgan was sitting on the bed where Jack had sat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a drink, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d John said and handed him the glass and the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never liked to go to these wakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed. Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh.\r\n\r\nThey were all feeling pretty good when they left. Jack stood on the\r\nporch when they got into the car. They waved to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said.\r\n\r\nWe had supper. Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything all during the meal except,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you pass me this?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWill you pass me that?\xe2\x80\x9d The two health-farm\r\npatients ate at the same table with us. They were pretty nice fellows.\r\nAfter we finished eating we went out on the porch. It was dark early.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to take a walk, Jerry?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nWe put on our coats and started out. It was quite a way down to the main\r\nroad and then we walked along the main road about a mile and a half.\r\nCars kept going by and we would pull out to the side until they were\r\npast. Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. After we had stepped out into the bushes\r\nto let a big car go by Jack said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with this walking. Come on\r\nback to Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went along a side road that cut up over the hill and cut across the\r\nfields back to Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s. We could see the lights of the house up on the\r\nhill. We came around to the front of the house and there standing in the\r\ndoorway was Hogan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a good walk?\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, Hogan. Have you got any liquor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend it up to the room,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to sleep to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on up to the room, Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nUpstairs Jack sat on the bed with his head in his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it a life?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nHogan brought in a quart of liquor and two glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant some ginger-ale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think I want to do, get sick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. He went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about you, Jerry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have one with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nJack poured out a couple of drinks. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to take it\r\nslow and easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut some water in it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that\xe2\x80\x99s better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a couple of drinks without saying anything. Jack started to pour\r\nme another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said.

About nine-thirty\r\nI heard Jack getting up in the next room. When I heard him go downstairs\r\nI went down after him. Jack was sitting at the breakfast table. Hogan\r\nhad come in and was standing beside the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep well?\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a thick tongue but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got a\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was good liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it on the bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time you want to go into town?\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. Hogan went out.\r\n\r\nI sat down at the table. Jack was eating a grape-fruit. When he\xe2\x80\x99d find a\r\nseed he\xe2\x80\x99d spit it out in the spoon and dump it on the plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I was pretty stewed last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou drank some liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I said a lot of fool things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Hogan?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.

He was holding\r\nthe spoon and sort of poking at the grape-fruit with it.\r\n\r\nThe girl came in with some ham and eggs and took away the grape-fruit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me another glass of milk,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said to her. She went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you had fifty grand on Walcott,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too good about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething might happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants the title bad.

It\xe2\x80\x99s worth a lot of money to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty grand is a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t win. You know I can\xe2\x80\x99t win anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as you\xe2\x80\x99re in there you got a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all through.

He was\r\ninside the booth telephoning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s called her up since he\xe2\x80\x99s out here,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe writes her every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d Hogan says, \xe2\x80\x9ca letter only costs two cents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHogan said good-by to us and Bruce, the nigger rubber, drove us down to\r\nthe train in the cart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Mr. Brennan,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruce said at the train, \xe2\x80\x9cI sure hope you knock\r\nhis can off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. He gave Bruce two dollars. Bruce had worked on him\r\na lot. He looked kind of disappointed. Jack saw me looking at Bruce\r\nholding the two dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all in the bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHogan charged me for the rubbing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the train going into town Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk. He sat in the corner of\r\nthe seat with his ticket in his hat-band and looked out of the window.\r\nOnce he turned and spoke to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told the wife I\xe2\x80\x99d take a room at the Shelby to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust around the corner from the Garden.

In town we took a taxi up to the Shelby. A\r\nboy came out and took our bags and we went in to the desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much are the rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only have double rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d the clerk says. \xe2\x80\x9cI can give you a nice\r\ndouble room for ten dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s too steep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give you a double room for seven dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a bath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well bunk with me, Jerry,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep down at my brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean for you to pay it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want to get my\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you register, please?\xe2\x80\x9d the clerk says. He looked at the names.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber 238, Mister Brennan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went up in the elevator. It was a nice big room with two beds and a\r\ndoor opening into a bath-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nThe boy who brought us up pulled up the curtains and brought in our\r\nbags. Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any move, so I gave the boy a quarter. We washed\r\nup and Jack said we better go out and get something to eat.\r\n\r\nWe ate a lunch at Jimmey Handley\xe2\x80\x99s place. Quite a lot of the boys were\r\nthere. When we were about half through eating, John came in and sat down\r\nwith us. Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you on the weight, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked him. Jack was putting away\r\na pretty good lunch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could make it with my clothes on,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. He never had to worry\r\nabout taking off weight. He was a natural welter-weight and he\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\ngotten fat. He\xe2\x80\x99d lost weight out at Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you never had to worry about,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nWe went around to the garden to weigh in after lunch. The match was made\r\nat a hundred forty-seven pounds at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Jack stepped on the\r\nscales with a towel around him. The bar didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. Walcott had just\r\nweighed and was standing with a lot of people around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see what you weigh, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d Freedman, Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s manager said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, weigh _him_ then,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack jerked his head toward Walcott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop the towel,\xe2\x80\x9d Freedman said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you make it?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked the fellows who were weighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and forty-three pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d the fat man who was weighing said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re down fine, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d Freedman says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeigh _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nWalcott came over. He was a blond with wide shoulders and arms like a\r\nheavyweight. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much legs. Jack stood about half a head\r\ntaller than he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His face was plenty marked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d Walcott says. He dropped the towel from around his waist and\r\nstood on the scales. He had the widest shoulders and back you ever saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and forty-six pounds and twelve ounces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalcott stepped off and grinned at Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d John says to him, \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x99s spotting you about four pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that when I come in, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Walcott says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go and\r\neat now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went back and Jack got dressed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty tough-looking boy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nJack says to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks as though he\xe2\x80\x99d been hit plenty of times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t hard to hit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked when Jack was dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack to the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou looked after everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d John says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all looked after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to lie down a while,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come around for you about a quarter to seven and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp at the hotel Jack took off his shoes and his coat and lay down for a\r\nwhile. I wrote a letter. I looked over a couple of times and Jack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleeping. He was lying perfectly still but every once in a while his\r\neyes would open. Finally he sits up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant to play some cribbage, Jerry?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe went over to his suitcase and got out the cards and the cribbage\r\nboard. We played cribbage and he won three dollars off me. John knocked\r\nat the door and came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant to play some cribbage, John?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked him.\r\n\r\nJohn put his kelly down on the table. It was all wet. His coat was wet\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it raining?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pouring,\xe2\x80\x9d John says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe taxi I had, got tied up in the traffic\r\nand I got out and walked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, play some cribbage,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to go and eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to eat yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they played cribbage for about half an hour and Jack won a dollar and\r\na half off him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose we got to go eat,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. He went to the window and\r\nlooked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it still raining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s eat in the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll play you once more to see who pays for the\r\nmeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little while Jack gets up and says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou buy the meal, John,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand we went downstairs and ate in the big dining-room.\r\n\r\nAfter we ate we went upstairs and Jack played cribbage with John again\r\nand won two dollars and a half off him. Jack was feeling pretty good.\r\nJohn had a bag with him with all his stuff in it. Jack took off his\r\nshirt and collar and put on a jersey and a sweater, so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch\r\ncold when he came out, and put his ring clothes and his bathrobe in a\r\nbag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou all ready?\xe2\x80\x9d John asks him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call up and have them get a taxi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPretty soon the telephone rang and they said the taxi was waiting.\r\n\r\nWe rode down in the elevator and went out through the lobby, and got in\r\na taxi and rode around to the Garden. It was raining hard but there was\r\na lot of people outside on the streets. The Garden was sold out. As we\r\ncame in on our way to the dressing-room I saw how full it was. It looked\r\nlike half a mile down to the ring. It was all dark. Just the lights over\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, with this rain, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t try and pull this fight\r\nin the ball park,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey got a good crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fight that would draw a lot more than the Garden could hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t tell about the weather,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nJohn came to the door of the dressing-room and poked his head in. Jack\r\nwas sitting there with his bathrobe on, he had his arms folded and was\r\nlooking at the floor. John had a couple of handlers with him. They\r\nlooked over his shoulder. Jack looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just gone down,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\nWe started down. Walcott was just getting into the ring. The crowd gave\r\nhim a big hand. He climbed through between the ropes and put his two\r\nfists together and smiled, and shook them at the crowd, first at one\r\nside of the ring, then at the other, and then sat down. Jack got a good\r\nhand coming down through the crowd. Jack is Irish and the Irish always\r\nget a pretty good hand. An Irishman don\xe2\x80\x99t draw in New York like a Jew or\r\nan Italian but they always get a good hand. Jack climbed up and bent\r\ndown to go through the ropes and Walcott came over from his corner and\r\npushed the rope down for Jack to go through. The crowd thought that was\r\nwonderful. Walcott put his hand on Jack\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and they stood there\r\njust for a second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be one of these popular champions,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cTake your goddam hand off my shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Walcott says.\r\n\r\nThis is all great for the crowd. How gentlemanly the boys are before the\r\nfight! How they wish each other luck!\r\n\r\nSolly Freedman came over to our corner while Jack is bandaging his hands\r\nand John is over in Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s corner. Jack puts his thumb through the\r\nslit in the bandage and then wrapped his hand nice and smooth. I taped\r\nit around the wrist and twice across the knuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey,\xe2\x80\x9d Freedman says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you get all that tape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s soft, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a hick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFreedman stands there all the time while Jack bandages the other hand,\r\nand one of the boys that\xe2\x80\x99s going to handle him brings the gloves and I\r\npull them on and work them around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Freedman,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asks, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat nationality is this Walcott?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Solly says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of a Dane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a Bohemian,\xe2\x80\x9d the lad who brought the gloves said.\r\n\r\nThe referee called them out to the centre of the ring and Jack walks\r\nout. Walcott comes out smiling. They met and the referee put his arm on\r\neach of their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, popularity,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says to Walcott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call yourself \xe2\x80\x98Walcott\xe2\x80\x99 for?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you know\r\nhe was a nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d says the referee, and he gives them the same old line. Once\r\nWalcott interrupts him. He grabs Jack\xe2\x80\x99s arm and says, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I hit when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got me like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hands off me,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no moving-pictures of\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went back to their corners. I lifted the bathrobe off Jack and he\r\nleaned on the ropes and flexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed\r\nhis shoes in the rosin. The gong rang and Jack turned quick and went\r\nout. Walcott came toward him and they touched gloves and as soon as\r\nWalcott dropped his hands Jack jumped his left into his face twice.\r\nThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody ever boxed better than Jack. Walcott was after him,\r\ngoing forward all the time with his chin on his chest. He\xe2\x80\x99s a hooker and\r\nhe carries his hands pretty low. All he knows is to get in there and\r\nsock. But every time he gets in there close, Jack has the left hand in\r\nhis face. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as though it\xe2\x80\x99s automatic. Jack just raises the left\r\nhand up and it\xe2\x80\x99s in Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s face. Three or four times Jack brings the\r\nright over but Walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up on the head.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s just like all these hookers. The only thing he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of is\r\nanother one of the same kind. He\xe2\x80\x99s covered everywhere you can hurt him.\r\nHe don\xe2\x80\x99t care about a left-hand in his face.\r\n\r\nAfter about four rounds Jack has him bleeding bad and his face all cut\r\nup, but every time Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s got in close he\xe2\x80\x99s socked so hard he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\ntwo big red patches on both sides just below Jack\xe2\x80\x99s ribs. Every time he\r\ngets in close, Jack ties him up, then gets one hand loose and uppercuts\r\nhim, but when Walcott gets his hands loose he socks Jack in the body so\r\nthey can hear it outside in the street. He\xe2\x80\x99s a socker.\r\n\r\nIt goes along like that for three rounds more. They don\xe2\x80\x99t talk any.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re working all the time. We worked over Jack plenty too, in between\r\nthe rounds. He don\xe2\x80\x99t look good at all but he never does much work in the\r\nring. He don\xe2\x80\x99t move around much and that left-hand is just automatic.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like it was connected with Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s face and Jack just had to\r\nwish it in every time. Jack is always calm in close and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t waste\r\nany juice. He knows everything about working in close too and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting away with a lot of stuff. While they were in our corner I\r\nwatched him tie Walcott up, get his right hand loose, turn it and come\r\nup with an uppercut that got Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s nose with the heel of the glove.\r\nWalcott was bleeding bad and leaned his nose on Jack\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder so as to\r\ngive Jack some of it too, and Jack sort of lifted his shoulder sharp and\r\ncaught him against the nose, and then brought down the right hand and\r\ndid the same thing again.\r\n\r\nWalcott was sore as hell. By the time they\xe2\x80\x99d gone five rounds he hated\r\nJack\xe2\x80\x99s guts. Jack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sore; that is, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any sorer than he\r\nalways was. He certainly did used to make the fellows he fought hate\r\nboxing. That was why he hated Kid Lewis so. He never got the Kid\xe2\x80\x99s goat.\r\nKid Lewis always had about three new dirty things Jack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. Jack\r\nwas as safe as a church all the time he was in there, as long as he was\r\nstrong. He certainly was treating Walcott rough. The funny thing was it\r\nlooked as though Jack was an open classic boxer. That was because he had\r\nall that stuff too.\r\n\r\nAfter the seventh round Jack says, \xe2\x80\x9cMy left\xe2\x80\x99s getting heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom then he started to take a beating. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t show at first. But\r\ninstead of him running the fight it was Walcott was running it, instead\r\nof being safe all the time now he was in trouble. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep him\r\nout with the left hand now. It looked as though it was the same as ever,\r\nonly now instead of Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s punches just missing him they were just\r\nhitting him. He took an awful beating in the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the round?\xe2\x80\x9d Jack asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eleventh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy legs are going bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalcott had been just hitting him for a long time. It was like a\r\nbaseball catcher pulls the ball and takes some of the shock off. From\r\nnow on Walcott commenced to land solid. He certainly was a\r\nsocking-machine. Jack was just trying to block everything now. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow what an awful beating he was taking. In between the rounds I worked\r\non his legs. The muscles would flutter under my hands all the time I was\r\nrubbing them. He was sick as hell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s it go?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked John, turning around, his face all swollen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can last,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want this bohunk to stop me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was going just the way he thought it would. He knew he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t beat\r\nWalcott. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong any more. He was all right though. His money\r\nwas all right and now he wanted to finish it off right to please\r\nhimself. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be knocked out.\r\n\r\nThe gong rang and we pushed him out. He went out slow. Walcott came\r\nright out after him. Jack put the left in his face and Walcott took it,\r\ncame in under it and started working on Jack\xe2\x80\x99s body. Jack tried to tie\r\nhim up and it was just like trying to hold on to a buzz-saw. Jack broke\r\naway from it and missed with the right. Walcott clipped him with a\r\nleft-hook and Jack went down. He went down on his hands and knees and\r\nlooked at us. The referee started counting. Jack was watching us and\r\nshaking his head. At eight John motioned to him. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear on\r\naccount of the crowd. Jack got up. The referee had been holding Walcott\r\nback with one arm while he counted.\r\n\r\nWhen Jack was on his feet Walcott started toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch yourself, Jimmy,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard Solly Freedman yell to him.\r\n\r\nWalcott came up to Jack looking at him. Jack stuck the left hand at him.\r\nWalcott just shook his head. He backed Jack up against the ropes,\r\nmeasured him and then hooked the left very light to the side of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead and socked the right into the body as hard as he could sock, just\r\nas low as he could get it. He must have hit him five inches below the\r\nbelt. I thought the eyes would come out of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s head. They stuck way\r\nout. His mouth come open.\r\n\r\nThe referee grabbed Walcott. Jack stepped forward. If he went down there\r\nwent fifty thousand bucks. He walked as though all his insides were\r\ngoing to fall out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t low,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd were yelling so you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. They were right in front of us. The referee\r\nlooks at John and then he shakes his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, you polak son-of-a-bitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says to Walcott.\r\n\r\nJohn was hanging onto the ropes. He had the towel ready to chuck in.\r\nJack was standing just a little way out from the ropes. He took a step\r\nforward. I saw the sweat come out on his face like somebody had squeezed\r\nit and a big drop went down his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on and fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says to Walcott.\r\n\r\nThe referee looked at John and waved Walcott on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in there, you slob,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\nWalcott went in. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do either. He never thought Jack\r\ncould have stood it. Jack put the left in his face. There was such a\r\nhell of a lot of yelling going on. They were right in front of us.\r\nWalcott hit him twice. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s face was the worst thing I ever saw,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlook on it! He was holding himself and all his body together and it all\r\nshowed on his face. All the time he was thinking and holding his body in\r\nwhere it was busted.\r\n\r\nThen he started to sock. His face looked awful all the time. He started\r\nto sock with his hands low down by his side, swinging at Walcott.\r\nWalcott covered up and Jack was swinging wild at Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s head. Then he\r\nswung the left and it hit Walcott in the groin and the right hit Walcott\r\nright bang where he\xe2\x80\x99d hit Jack. Way low below the belt. Walcott went\r\ndown and grabbed himself there and rolled and twisted around.\r\n\r\nThe referee grabbed Jack and pushed him toward his corner. John jumps\r\ninto the ring. There was all this yelling going on. The referee was\r\ntalking with the judges and then the announcer got into the ring with\r\nthe megaphone and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWalcott on a foul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe referee is talking to John and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I do? Jack\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the foul. Then when he\xe2\x80\x99s groggy he fouls him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d lost it anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\nJack\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on the chair. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got his gloves off and he\xe2\x80\x99s holding\r\nhimself in down there with both hands. When he\xe2\x80\x99s got something\r\nsupporting it his face doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look so bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo over and say you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d John says into his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack stands up and the sweat comes out all over his face. I put the\r\nbathrobe around him and he holds himself in with one hand under the\r\nbathrobe and goes across the ring. They\xe2\x80\x99ve picked Walcott up and they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nworking on him. There\xe2\x80\x99re a lot of people in Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s corner. Nobody\r\nspeaks to Jack. He leans over Walcott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to foul you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalcott doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. He looks too damned sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re the champion now,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you get a\r\nhell of a lot of fun out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave the kid alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Solly Freedman says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Solly,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I fouled your boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFreedman just looks at him.\r\n\r\nJack went to his corner walking that funny jerky way and we got him down\r\nthrough the ropes and through the reporters\xe2\x80\x99 tables and out down the\r\naisle. A lot of people want to slap Jack on the back. He goes out\r\nthrough all that mob in his bathrobe to the dressing-room. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npopular win for Walcott. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the money was bet in the Garden.\r\n\r\nOnce we got inside the dressing-room Jack lay down and shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to get to the hotel and get a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all busted inside,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry as hell, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says.\r\n\r\nHe lies there with his eyes shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey certainly tried a nice double-cross,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friends Morgan and Steinfelt,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got nice friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lies there, his eyes are open now. His face has still got that awful\r\ndrawn look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny how fast you can think when it means that much money,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re some boy, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d John says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A SIMPLE ENQUIRY\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, the snow was higher than the window. The sunlight came in\r\nthrough the window and shone on a map on the pine-board wall of the hut.\r\nThe sun was high and the light came in over the top of the snow. A\r\ntrench had been cut along the open side of the hut, and each clear day\r\nthe sun, shining on the wall, reflected heat against the snow and\r\nwidened the trench. It was late March. The major sat at a table against\r\nthe wall. His adjutant sat at another table.\r\n\r\nAround the major\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were two white circles where his snow-glasses\r\nhad protected his face from the sun on the snow. The rest of his face\r\nhad been burned and then tanned and then burned through the tan. His\r\nnose was swollen and there were edges of loose skin where blisters had\r\nbeen. While he worked at the papers he put the fingers of his left hand\r\ninto a saucer of oil and then spread the oil over his face, touching it\r\nvery gently with the tips of his fingers. He was very careful to drain\r\nhis fingers on the edge of the saucer so there was only a film of oil on\r\nthem, and after he had stroked his forehead and his cheeks, he stroked\r\nhis nose very delicately between his fingers. When he had finished he\r\nstood up, took the saucer of oil and went into the small room of the hut\r\nwhere he slept. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a little sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\nadjutant. In that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwill finish up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, signor maggiore,\xe2\x80\x9d the adjutant answered. He leaned back in his\r\nchair and yawned. He took a paper-covered book out of the pocket of his\r\ncoat and opened it; then laid it down on the table and lit his pipe. He\r\nleaned forward on the table to read and puffed at his pipe. Then he\r\nclosed the book and put it back in his pocket. He had too much\r\npaper-work to get through. He could not enjoy reading until it was done.\r\nOutside, the sun went behind a mountain and there was no more light on\r\nthe wall of the hut. A soldier came in and put some pine branches,\r\nchopped into irregular lengths, into the stove. \xe2\x80\x9cBe soft, Pinin,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nadjutant said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe major is sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPinin was the major\xe2\x80\x99s orderly. He was a dark-faced boy, and he fixed the\r\nstove, putting the pine wood in carefully, shut the door, and went into\r\nthe back of the hut again. The adjutant went on with his papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonani,\xe2\x80\x9d the major called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignor maggiore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Pinin in to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPinin!\xe2\x80\x9d the adjutant called. Pinin came into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe major wants\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d the adjutant said.\r\n\r\nPinin walked across the main room of the hut toward the major\xe2\x80\x99s door. He\r\nknocked on the half-opened door. \xe2\x80\x9cSignor maggiore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d the adjutant heard the major say, \xe2\x80\x9cand shut the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInside the room the major lay on his bunk. Pinin stood beside the bunk.\r\nThe major lay with his head on the rucksack that he had stuffed with\r\nspare clothing to make a pillow. His long, burned, oiled face looked at\r\nPinin. His hands lay on the blankets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are nineteen?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, signor maggiore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have ever been in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, signor maggiore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn love\xe2\x80\x94with a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been with girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not ask that. I asked if you had been in love\xe2\x80\x94with a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, signor maggiore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love with this girl now? You don\xe2\x80\x99t write her. I read all\r\nyour letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in love with her,\xe2\x80\x9d Pinin said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not write her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonani,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said in the same tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you hear me\r\ntalking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer from the next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can not hear,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are quite sure that you love\r\na girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d the major looked at him quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are not corrupt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, corrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be superior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPinin looked at the floor. The major looked at his brown face, down and\r\nup him, and at his hands. Then he went on, not smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally want\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the major paused. Pinin looked at the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat your\r\ngreat desire isn\xe2\x80\x99t really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Pinin looked at the floor. The major leaned\r\nhis head back on the rucksack and smiled. He was really relieved: life\r\nin the army was too complicated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngood boy, Pinin. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be superior and be careful some one else\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t come along and take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPinin stood still beside the bunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. His hands were folded on the\r\nblankets. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t touch you. You can go back to your platoon if you\r\nlike. But you had better stay on as my servant. You\xe2\x80\x99ve less chance of\r\nbeing killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want anything of me, signor maggiore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the major said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on and get on with whatever you were doing.\r\nLeave the door open when you go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPinin went out, leaving the door open. The adjutant looked up at him as\r\nhe walked awkwardly across the room and out the door. Pinin was flushed\r\nand moved differently than he had moved when he brought in the wood for\r\nthe fire. The adjutant looked after him and smiled. Pinin came in with\r\nmore wood for the stove. The major, lying on his bunk, looking at his\r\ncloth-covered helmet and his snow-glasses that hung from a nail on the\r\nwall, heard him walk across the floor. The little devil, he thought, I\r\nwonder if he lied to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TEN INDIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER one Fourth of July, Nick, driving home late from town in the big\r\nwagon with Joe Garner and his family, passed nine drunken Indians along\r\nthe road. He remembered there were nine because Joe Garner, driving\r\nalong in the dusk, pulled up the horses, jumped down into the road and\r\ndragged an Indian out of the wheel rut. The Indian had been asleep, face\r\ndown in the sand. Joe dragged him into the bushes and got back up on the\r\nwagon-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes nine of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said, \xe2\x80\x9cjust between here and the edge of\r\ntown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Garner.\r\n\r\nNick was on the back seat with the two Garner boys. He was looking out\r\nfrom the back seat to see the Indian where Joe had dragged him alongside\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it Billy Tabeshaw?\xe2\x80\x9d Carl asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis pants looked mighty like Billy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll Indians wear the same kind of pants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said. \xe2\x80\x9cPa was down into the road and\r\nback up again before I seen a thing. I thought he was killing a snake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of Indians\xe2\x80\x99ll kill snakes to-night, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Garner said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Garner.\r\n\r\nThey drove along. The road turned off from the main highway and went up\r\ninto the hills. It was hard pulling for the horses and the boys got down\r\nand walked. The road was sandy. Nick looked back from the top of the\r\nhill by the schoolhouse. He saw the lights of Petoskey and, off across\r\nLittle Traverse Bay, the lights of Harbour Springs. They climbed back in\r\nthe wagon again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to put some gravel on that stretch,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Garner said. The\r\nwagon went along the road through the woods. Joe and Mrs. Garner sat\r\nclose together on the front seat. Nick sat between the two boys. The\r\nroad came out into a clearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight here was where Pa ran over the skunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was further on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference where it was,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said without turning his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cOne place is just as good as another to run over a skunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw two skunks last night,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown by the lake. They were looking for dead fish along the beach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were coons probably,\xe2\x80\x9d Carl said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were skunks. I guess I know skunks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d Carl said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got an Indian girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop talking that way, Carl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Garner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they smell about the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe Garner laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stop laughing, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Garner said. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have Carl talk that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got an Indian girl, Nickie?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has too, Pa,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said. \xe2\x80\x9cPrudence Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s his girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe goes to see her every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick, sitting between the two boys in the dark, felt hollow\r\nand happy inside himself to be teased about Prudence Mitchell. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carl. \xe2\x80\x9cI see them together every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarl can\xe2\x80\x99t get a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot even a squaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarl was quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarl ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good with girls,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all right, Carl,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Garner said. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls never got a man\r\nanywhere. Look at your pa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you would say,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Garner moved close to Joe as the\r\nwagon jolted. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you had plenty of girls in your time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet Pa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever have had a squaw for a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou better watch out to keep Prudie,\r\nNick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife whispered to him and Joe laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Frank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you say it, Garner,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife warned. Joe laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNickie can have Prudence,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Garner said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Garner said.\r\n\r\nThe horses were pulling heavily in the sand. Joe reached out in the dark\r\nwith the whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, pull into it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pull harder than this to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey trotted down the long hill, the wagon jolting. At the farmhouse\r\neverybody got down. Mrs. Garner unlocked the door, went inside, and came\r\nout with a lamp in her hand. Carl and Nick unloaded the things from the\r\nback of the wagon. Frank sat on the front seat to drive to the barn and\r\nput up the horses. Nick went up the steps and opened the kitchen door.\r\nMrs. Garner was building a fire in the stove. She turned from pouring\r\nkerosene on the wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Mrs. Garner,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for taking me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh shucks, Nickie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a wonderful time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe like to have you. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you stay and eat some supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better go. I think Dad probably waited for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get along then. Send Carl up to the house, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Nickie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mrs. Garner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick went out the farmyard and down to the barn. Joe and Frank were\r\nmilking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a swell time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Nick,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Garner called. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to stay and\r\neat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Will you tell Carl his mother wants him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Good-night, Nickie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick walked barefoot along the path through the meadow below the barn.\r\nThe path was smooth and the dew was cool on his bare feet. He climbed a\r\nfence at the end of the meadow, went down through a ravine, his feet wet\r\nin the swamp mud, and then climbed up through the dry beech woods until\r\nhe saw the lights of the cottage. He climbed over the fence and walked\r\naround to the front porch. Through the window he saw his father sitting\r\nby the table, reading in the light from the big lamp. Nick opened the\r\ndoor and went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nickie,\xe2\x80\x9d his father said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas it a good day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a swell time, Dad. It was a swell Fourth of July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do with your shoes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left them in the wagon at Garner\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on out to the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s father went ahead with the lamp. He stopped and lifted the lid of\r\nthe ice-box. Nick went on into the kitchen. His father brought in a\r\npiece of cold chicken on a plate and a pitcher of milk and put them on\r\nthe table before Nick. He put down the lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some pie too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill that hold you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s grand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father sat down in a chair beside the oilcloth-covered table. He\r\nmade a big shadow on the kitchen wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho won the ball game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetoskey. Five to three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father sat watching him eat and filled his glass from the\r\nmilk-pitcher. Nick drank and wiped his mouth on his napkin. His father\r\nreached over to the shelf for the pie. He cut Nick a big piece. It was\r\nhuckleberry pie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do, Dad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went out fishing in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly perch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father sat watching Nick eat the pie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went for a walk up by the Indian camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians were all in town getting drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see anybody at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw your friend, Prudie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was in the woods with Frank Washburn. I ran onto them. They were\r\nhaving quite a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father was not looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what they were doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d his father said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just heard them threshing around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know it was them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it with her?\xe2\x80\x9d Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank Washburn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they\xe2\x80\x94were they\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father got up from the table and went out the kitchen screen door.\r\nWhen he came back Nick was looking at his plate. He had been crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some more?\xe2\x80\x9d His father picked up the knife to cut the pie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better have another piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father cleared off the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were they in the woods?\xe2\x80\x9d Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp back of the camp.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick looked at his plate. His father said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nbetter go to bed, Nick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick went into his room, undressed, and got into bed. He heard his\r\nfather moving around in the living-room. Nick lay in the bed with his\r\nface in the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart\xe2\x80\x99s broken,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I feel this way my heart must be\r\nbroken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a while he heard his father blow out the lamp and go into his own\r\nroom. He heard a wind come up in the trees outside and felt it come in\r\ncool through the screen. He lay for a long time with his face in the\r\npillow, and after a while he forgot to think about Prudence and finally\r\nhe went to sleep. When he awoke in the night he heard the wind in the\r\nhemlock trees outside the cottage and the waves of the lake coming in on\r\nthe shore, and he went back to sleep. In the morning there was a big\r\nwind blowing and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was\r\nawake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A CANARY FOR ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE train passed very quickly a long, red stone house with a garden and\r\nfour thick palm-trees with tables under them in the shade. On the other\r\nside was the sea. Then there was a cutting through red stone and clay,\r\nand the sea was only occasionally and far below against rocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought him in Palermo,\xe2\x80\x9d the American lady said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe only had an hour\r\nashore and it was Sunday morning. The man wanted to be paid in dollars\r\nand I gave him a dollar and a half. He really sings very beautifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very hot in the train and it was very hot in the _lit salon_\r\ncompartment. There was no breeze came through the open window. The\r\nAmerican lady pulled the window-blind down and there was no more sea,\r\neven occasionally. On the other side there was glass, then the corridor,\r\nthen an open window, and outside the window were dusty trees and an\r\noiled road and flat fields of grapes, with gray-stone hills behind them.\r\n\r\nThere was smoke from many tall chimneys\xe2\x80\x94coming into Marseilles, and the\r\ntrain slowed down and followed one track through many others into the\r\nstation. The train stayed twenty-five minutes in the station at\r\nMarseilles and the American lady bought a copy of _The Daily Mail_ and a\r\nhalf-bottle of Evian water. She walked a little way along the station\r\nplatform, but she stayed near the steps of the car because at Cannes,\r\nwhere it stopped for twelve minutes, the train had left with no signal\r\nof departure and she had only gotten on just in time. The American lady\r\nwas a little deaf and she was afraid that perhaps signals of departure\r\nwere given and that she did not hear them.\r\n\r\nThe train left the station in Marseilles and there was not only the\r\nswitch-yards and the factory smoke but, looking back, the town of\r\nMarseilles and the harbor with stone hills behind it and the last of the\r\nsun on the water. As it was getting dark the train passed a farmhouse\r\nburning in a field. Motor-cars were stopped along the road and bedding\r\nand things from inside the farmhouse were spread in the field. Many\r\npeople were watching the house burn. After it was dark the train was in\r\nAvignon. People got on and off. At the news-stand Frenchmen, returning\r\nto Paris, bought that day\xe2\x80\x99s French papers. On the station platform were\r\nnegro soldiers. They wore brown uniforms and were tall and their faces\r\nshone, close under the electric light. Their faces were very black and\r\nthey were too tall to stare. The train left Avignon station with the\r\nnegroes standing there. A short white sergeant was with them.\r\n\r\nInside the _lit salon_ compartment the porter had pulled down the three\r\nbeds from inside the wall and prepared them for sleeping. In the night\r\nthe American lady lay without sleeping because the train was a _rapide_\r\nand went very fast and she was afraid of the speed in the night. The\r\nAmerican lady\xe2\x80\x99s bed was the one next to the window. The canary from\r\nPalermo, a cloth spread over his cage, was out of the draft in the\r\ncorridor that went into the compartment wash-room. There was a blue\r\nlight outside the compartment, and all night the train went very fast\r\nand the American lady lay awake and waited for a wreck.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the train was near Paris, and after the American lady had\r\ncome out from the wash-room, looking very wholesome and middle-aged and\r\nAmerican in spite of not having slept, and had taken the cloth off the\r\nbirdcage and hung the cage in the sun, she went back to the\r\nrestaurant-car for breakfast. When she came back to the _lit salon_\r\ncompartment again, the beds had been pushed back into the wall and made\r\ninto seats, the canary was shaking his feathers in the sunlight that\r\ncame through the open window, and the train was much nearer Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe loves the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d the American lady said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll sing now in a little\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canary shook his feathers and pecked into them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always loved\r\nbirds,\xe2\x80\x9d the American lady said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m taking him home to my little girl.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s singing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canary chirped and the feathers on his throat stood out, then he\r\ndropped his bill and pecked into his feathers again. The train crossed a\r\nriver and passed through a very carefully tended forest. The train\r\npassed through many outside of Paris towns. There were tram-cars in the\r\ntowns and big advertisements for the Belle Jardini\xc3\xa8re and Dubonnet and\r\nPernod on the walls toward the train. All that the train passed through\r\nlooked as though it were before breakfast. For several minutes I had not\r\nlistened to the American lady, who was talking to my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your husband American too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re both Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that was because I wore braces,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. I had started to say\r\nsuspenders and changed it to braces in the mouth, to keep my English\r\ncharacter. The American lady did not hear. She was really quite deaf;\r\nshe read lips, and I had not looked toward her. I had looked out of the\r\nwindow. She went on talking to my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re Americans. American men make the best husbands,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nAmerican lady was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was why we left the Continent, you know.\r\nMy daughter fell in love with a man in Vevey.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were\r\nsimply madly in love.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped again. \xe2\x80\x9cI took her away, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she get over it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the American lady. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything\r\nand she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep at all. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried so very hard, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to take an interest in anything. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about things. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her marrying a foreigner.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. \xe2\x80\x9cSome one, a very\r\ngood friend, told me once, \xe2\x80\x98No foreigner can make an American girl a\r\ngood husband.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe American lady admired my wife\xe2\x80\x99s travelling-coat, and it turned out\r\nthat the American lady had bought her own clothes for twenty years now\r\nfrom the same maison de couturier in the Rue Saint Honor\xc3\xa9. They had her\r\nmeasurements, and a vendeuse who knew her and her tastes picked the\r\ndresses out for her and they were sent to America. They came to the\r\npost-office near where she lived up-town in New York, and the duty was\r\nnever exorbitant because they opened the dresses there in the\r\npost-office to appraise them and they were always very simple-looking\r\nand with no gold lace nor ornaments that would make the dresses look\r\nexpensive. Before the present vendeuse, named Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se, there had been\r\nanother vendeuse, named Am\xc3\xa9lie. Altogether there had only been these two\r\nin the twenty years. It had always been the same couturier. Prices,\r\nhowever, had gone up. The exchange, though, equalized that. They had her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s measurements now too. She was grown up and there was not much\r\nchance of their changing now.\r\n\r\nThe train was now coming into Paris. The fortifications were levelled\r\nbut grass had not grown. There were many cars standing on tracks\xe2\x80\x94brown\r\nwooden restaurant-cars and brown wooden sleeping-cars that would go to\r\nItaly at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night, if that train still left at five; the\r\ncars were marked Paris-Rome, and cars, with seats on the roofs, that\r\nwent back and forth to the suburbs with, at certain hours, people in all\r\nthe seats and on the roofs, if that were the way it were still done, and\r\npassing were the white walls and many windows of houses. Nothing had\r\neaten any breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans make the best husbands,\xe2\x80\x9d the American lady said to my wife. I\r\nwas getting down the bags. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican men are the only men in the world\r\nto marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long ago did you leave Vevey?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago this fall. It\xe2\x80\x99s her, you know, that I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the canary\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the man your daughter was in love with a Swiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the American lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was from a very good family in Vevey.\r\nHe was going to be an engineer. They met there in Vevey. They used to go\r\non long walks together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Vevey,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were there on our honeymoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you really? That must have been lovely. I had no idea, of course,\r\nthat she\xe2\x80\x99d fall in love with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very lovely place,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the American lady. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it lovely? Where did you stop\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe stayed at the Trois Couronnes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a fine old hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the American lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a very fine room and in the fall the\r\ncountry was lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you there in the fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my wife.\r\n\r\nWe were passing three cars that had been in a wreck. They were\r\nsplintered open and the roofs sagged in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a wreck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe American lady looked and saw the last car. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of just\r\nthat all night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have terrific presentiments about things\r\nsometimes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never travel on a _rapide_ again at night. There must be\r\nother comfortable trains that don\xe2\x80\x99t go so fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the train was in the dark of the Gare de Lyons, and then stopped\r\nand porters came up to the windows. I handed bags through the windows,\r\nand we were out on the dim longness of the platform, and the American\r\nlady put herself in charge of one of three men from Cook\xe2\x80\x99s who said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a moment, madame, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll look for your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe porter brought a truck and piled on the baggage, and my wife said\r\ngood-by and I said good-by to the American lady, whose name had been\r\nfound by the man from Cook\xe2\x80\x99s on a typewritten page in a sheaf of\r\ntypewritten pages which he replaced in his pocket.\r\n\r\nWe followed the porter with the truck down the long cement platform\r\nbeside the train. At the end was a gate and a man took the tickets.\r\n\r\nWe were returning to Paris to set up separate residences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AN ALPINE IDYLL\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was hot coming down into the valley even in the early morning. The\r\nsun melted the snow from the skis we were carrying and dried the wood.\r\nIt was spring in the valley but the sun was very hot. We came along the\r\nroad into Galtur carrying our skis and rucksacks. As we passed the\r\nchurchyard a burial was just over. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cGr\xc3\xbcss Gott,\xe2\x80\x9d to the priest\r\nas he walked past us coming out of the churchyard. The priest bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny a priest never speaks to you,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think they\xe2\x80\x99d like to say \xe2\x80\x98Gr\xc3\xbcss Gott.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never answer,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\nWe stopped in the road and watched the sexton shovelling in the new\r\nearth. A peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside\r\nthe grave. The sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back. The\r\npeasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on\r\nfilling in the grave\xe2\x80\x94spreading the earth evenly as a man spreading\r\nmanure in a garden. In the bright May morning the grave-filling looked\r\nunreal. I could not imagine any one being dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine being buried on a day like this,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went on up the road past the houses of the town to the inn. We had\r\nbeen skiing in the Silvretta for a month, and it was good to be down in\r\nthe valley. In the Silvretta the skiing had been all right, but it was\r\nspring skiing, the snow was good only in the early morning and again in\r\nthe evening. The rest of the time it was spoiled by the sun. We were\r\nboth tired of the sun. You could not get away from the sun. The only\r\nshadows were made by rocks or by the hut that was built under the\r\nprotection of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade the sweat froze\r\nin your underclothing. You could not sit outside the hut without dark\r\nglasses. It was pleasant to be burned black but the sun had been very\r\ntiring. You could not rest in it. I was glad to be down away from snow.\r\nIt was too late in the spring to be up in the Silvretta. I was a little\r\ntired of skiing. We had stayed too long. I could taste the snow water we\r\nhad been drinking melted off the tin roof of the hut. The taste was a\r\npart of the way I felt about skiing. I was glad there were other things\r\nbeside skiing, and I was glad to be down, away from the unnatural high\r\nmountain spring, into this May morning in the valley.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn, his chair tipped back against\r\nthe wall. Beside him sat the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSki-heil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeil!\xe2\x80\x9d we said and leaned the skis against the wall and took off our\r\npacks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it up above?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSch\xc3\xb6n. A little too much sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There\xe2\x80\x99s too much sun this time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook sat on in his chair. The innkeeper went in with us and unlocked\r\nhis office and brought out our mail. There was a bundle of letters and\r\nsome papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get some beer,\xe2\x80\x9d John said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. We\xe2\x80\x99ll drink it inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proprietor brought two bottles and we drank them while we read the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe better have some more beer,\xe2\x80\x9d John said. A girl brought it this time.\r\nShe smiled as she opened the bottles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany letters,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProsit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said and went out, taking the empty bottles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten what beer tasted like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d John said. \xe2\x80\x9cUp in the hut I used to think about it a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to ever do anything too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We were up there too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo damn long,\xe2\x80\x9d John said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good doing a thing too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sun came through the open window and shone through the beer bottles\r\non the table. The bottles were half full. There was a little froth on\r\nthe beer in the bottles, not much because it was very cold. It collared\r\nup when you poured it into the tall glasses. I looked out of the open\r\nwindow at the white road. The trees beside the road were dusty. Beyond\r\nwas a green field and a stream. There were trees along the stream and a\r\nmill with a water wheel. Through the open side of the mill I saw a long\r\nlog and a saw in it rising and falling. No one seemed to be tending it.\r\nThere were four crows walking in the green field. One crow sat in a tree\r\nwatching. Outside on the porch the cook got off his chair and passed\r\ninto the hall that led back into the kitchen. Inside, the sunlight shone\r\nthrough the empty glasses on the table. John was leaning forward with\r\nhis head on his arms.\r\n\r\nThrough the window I saw two men come up the front steps. They came into\r\nthe drinking room. One was the bearded peasant in the high boots. The\r\nother was the sexton. They sat down at the table under the window. The\r\ngirl came in and stood by their table. The peasant did not seem to see\r\nher. He sat with his hands on the table. He wore his old army clothes.\r\nThere were patches on the elbows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sexton. The peasant did not pay any\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchnapps,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a quarter litre of red wine,\xe2\x80\x9d the sexton told the girl.\r\n\r\nThe girl brought the drinks and the peasant drank the schnapps. He\r\nlooked out of the window. The sexton watched him. John had his head\r\nforward on the table. He was asleep.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper came in and went over to the table. He spoke in dialect\r\nand the sexton answered him. The peasant looked out of the window. The\r\ninnkeeper went out of the room. The peasant stood up. He took a folded\r\nten-thousand kronen note out of a leather pocket-book and unfolded it.\r\nThe girl came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlles?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me buy the wine,\xe2\x80\x9d the sexton said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlles,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant repeated to the girl. She put her hand in the\r\npocket of her apron, brought it out full of coins and counted out the\r\nchange. The peasant went out the door. As soon as he was gone the\r\ninnkeeper came into the room again and spoke to the sexton. He sat down\r\nat the table. They talked in dialect. The sexton was amused. The\r\ninnkeeper was disgusted. The sexton stood up from the table. He was a\r\nlittle man with a mustache. He leaned out of the window and looked up\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the L\xc3\xb6wen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked again and then the innkeeper came over to our table. The\r\ninnkeeper was a tall man and old. He looked at John asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we were up early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you want to eat soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny time,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you want. The girl will bring the eating-card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl brought the menu. John woke up. The menu was written in ink on\r\na card and the card slipped into a wooden paddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the speise-karte,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to John. He looked at it. He was\r\nstill sleepy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you have a drink with us?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the innkeeper. He sat down.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose peasants are beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw that one at a funeral coming into town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a beast. All these peasants are beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what just happened about\r\nthat one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d The innkeeper spoke to the sexton. \xe2\x80\x9cFranz,\r\ncome over here.\xe2\x80\x9d The sexton came, bringing his little bottle of wine and\r\nhis glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentlemen are just come down from the Wiesbadenerh\xc3\xbctte,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ninnkeeper said. We shook hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you drink?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz shook his finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother quarter litre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand dialect?\xe2\x80\x9d the innkeeper asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going to tell us about the peasant we saw filling the grave,\r\ncoming into town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d John said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt goes too fast for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat peasant,\xe2\x80\x9d the innkeeper said, \xe2\x80\x9cto-day he brought his wife in to be\r\nburied. She died last November.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecember,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes nothing. She died last December then, and he notified the\r\ncommune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecember eighteenth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring her over to be buried until the snow was\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives on the other side of the Paznaun,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\r\nbelongs to this parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring her out at all?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He can only come, from where he lives, on skis until the snow\r\nmelts. So to-day he brought her in to be buried and the priest, when he\r\nlooked at her face, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bury her. You go on and tell it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to the sexton. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak German, not dialect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very funny with the priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the report to\r\nthe commune she died of heart trouble. We knew she had heart trouble\r\nhere. She used to faint in church sometimes. She did not come for a long\r\ntime. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong to climb. When the priest uncovered her face he\r\nasked Olz, \xe2\x80\x98Did your wife suffer much?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Olz. \xe2\x80\x98When I came in\r\nthe house she was dead across the bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest looked at her again. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How did her face get that way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 Olz said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better find out,\xe2\x80\x99 the priest said, and put the blanket back. Olz\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. The priest looked at him. Olz looked back at the\r\npriest. \xe2\x80\x98You want to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I must know,\xe2\x80\x99 the priest said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where it\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d the innkeeper said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to this. Go on\r\nFranz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Olz, \xe2\x80\x98when she died I made the report to the commune and I\r\nput her in the shed across the top of the big wood. When I started to\r\nuse the big wood she was stiff and I put her up against the wall. Her\r\nmouth was open and when I came into the shed at night to cut up the big\r\nwood, I hung the lantern from it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why did you do that?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Olz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Did you do that many times?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Every time I went to work in the shed at night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It was very wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 said the priest. \xe2\x80\x98Did you love your wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ja, I loved her,\xe2\x80\x99 Olz said. \xe2\x80\x98I loved her fine.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you understand it all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the innkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand it all\r\nabout his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about eating?\xe2\x80\x9d John asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou order,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s true?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese peasants are beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he go now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to drink at my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s, the L\xc3\xb6wen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drink with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drink with me, after he knew about his wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe innkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d said John. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about eating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A PURSUIT RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CAMPBELL had been in a pursuit race with a burlesque show ever\r\nsince Pittsburgh. In a pursuit race, in bicycle racing, riders start at\r\nequal intervals to ride after one another. They ride very fast because\r\nthe race is usually limited to a short distance and if they slow their\r\nriding another rider who maintains his pace will make up the space that\r\nseparated them equally at the start. As soon as a rider is caught and\r\npassed he is out of the race and must get down from his bicycle and\r\nleave the track. If none of the riders are caught the winner of the race\r\nis the one who has gained the most distance. In most pursuit races, if\r\nthere are only two riders, one of the riders is caught inside of six\r\nmiles. The burlesque show caught William Campbell at Kansas City.\r\n\r\nWilliam Campbell had hoped to hold a slight lead over the burlesque show\r\nuntil they reached the Pacific coast. As long as he preceded the\r\nburlesque show as advance man he was being paid. When the burlesque show\r\ncaught up with him he was in bed. He was in bed when the manager of the\r\nburlesque troupe came into his room and after the manager had gone out\r\nhe decided that he might as well stay in bed. It was very cold in Kansas\r\nCity and he was in no hurry to go out. He did not like Kansas City. He\r\nreached under the bed for a bottle and drank. It made his stomach feel\r\nbetter. Mr. Turner, the manager of the burlesque show, had refused a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nWilliam Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Mr. Turner had been a little strange.\r\nMr. Turner had knocked on the door. Campbell had said: \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nMr. Turner came into the room he saw clothing on a chair, an open\r\nsuitcase, the bottle on a chair beside the bed, and some one lying in\r\nthe bed completely covered by the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMister Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Turner said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t fire me,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said from underneath the covers.\r\nIt was warm and white and close under the covers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t fire me\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got down off my bicycle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Turner said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said, speaking directly against the sheet\r\nand feeling the texture with his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Turner said. He turned off the electric light. The\r\nelectric light had been burning all night. It was now ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a drunken fool. When did you get into this town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got into this town last night,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said, speaking\r\nagainst the sheet. He found he liked to talk through a sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\never talk through a sheet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to be funny. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not being funny. I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking through a sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re talking through a sheet all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go now, Mr. Turner,\xe2\x80\x9d Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t work for you any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. He pulled down the sheet and\r\nlooked at Mr. Turner. \xe2\x80\x9cI know enough so I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind looking at you at\r\nall. Do you want to hear what I know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause really I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything at\r\nall. I was just talking.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled the sheet up over his face again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlove it under a sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr. Turner stood beside the bed. He was\r\na middle-aged man with a large stomach and a bald head and he had many\r\nthings to do. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to stop off here, Billy, and take a cure,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fix it up if you want to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take a cure,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ntake a cure at all. I am perfectly happy. All my life I have been\r\nperfectly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question!\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell breathed in and out through the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been stewed, Billy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I done my work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. I just asked you how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been stewed, Billy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my wolf back,\xe2\x80\x9d he touched the sheet with his\r\ntongue. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had him for a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. My dear wolf. Every time I take a drink he goes outside the\r\nroom. He can\xe2\x80\x99t stand alcohol. The poor little fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d He moved his\r\ntongue round and round on the sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely wolf. He\xe2\x80\x99s just like\r\nhe always was.\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell shut his eyes and took a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to take a cure, Billy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Turner said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t mind the\r\nKeeley. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Keeley,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t far from London.\xe2\x80\x9d He shut\r\nhis eyes and opened them, moving the eyelashes against the sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\njust love sheets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He looked at Mr. Turner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, you think I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re drunk and you\xe2\x80\x99ve had dt\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell held the sheet around his head. \xe2\x80\x9cDear sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. He breathed against it gently. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty sheet. You love me, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, sheet? It\xe2\x80\x99s all in the price of the room. Just like in Japan. No,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen Billy, dear Sliding Billy, I have a surprise for you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not drunk. I\xe2\x80\x99m hopped to the eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Turner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a look.\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell pulled up the right sleeve of his pyjama\r\njacket under the sheet, then shoved the right forearm out. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d On the forearm, from just above the wrist to the elbow, were\r\nsmall blue circles around tiny dark blue punctures. The circles almost\r\ntouched one another. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the new development,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI drink a little now once in a while, just to drive the wolf out\r\nof the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey got a cure for that, \xe2\x80\x98Sliding Billy\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Turner said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a cure for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just quit like that, Billy,\xe2\x80\x9d Turner said. He sat on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful of my sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just quit at your age and take to pumping yourself full of\r\nthat stuff just because you got in a jam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a law against it. If that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I mean you got to fight it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBilly Campbell caressed the sheet with his lips and his tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nsheet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can kiss this sheet and see right through it at the\r\nsame time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut it out about the sheet. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just take to that stuff, Billy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilliam Campbell shut his eyes. He was beginning to feel a slight\r\nnausea. He knew that this nausea would increase steadily, without there\r\never being the relief of sickness, until something were done against it.\r\nIt was at this point that he suggested that Mr. Turner have a drink. Mr.\r\nTurner declined. William Campbell took a drink from the bottle. It was a\r\ntemporary measure. Mr. Turner watched him. Mr. Turner had been in this\r\nroom much longer than he should have been, he had many things to do;\r\nalthough living in daily association with people who used drugs, he had\r\na horror of drugs, and he was very fond of William Campbell; he did not\r\nwish to leave him. He was very sorry for him and he felt a cure might\r\nhelp. He knew there were good cures in Kansas City. But he had to go. He\r\nstood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Billy,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you something.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re called \xe2\x80\x98Sliding Billy.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s because you can slide. I\xe2\x80\x99m called\r\njust Billy. That\xe2\x80\x99s because I never could slide at all. I can\xe2\x80\x99t slide,\r\nBilly. I can\xe2\x80\x99t slide. It just catches. Every time I try it, it catches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe shut his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t slide, Billy. It\xe2\x80\x99s awful when you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nslide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cSliding Billy\xe2\x80\x9d Turner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what?\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t saying. It must have been a\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were saying about sliding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been about sliding. But listen, Billy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you a secret. Stick to sheets, Billy. Keep away from women and\r\nhorses and, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stopped \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94eagles, Billy. If you love horses\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get horse-s\xe2\x80\x94, and if you love eagles you\xe2\x80\x99ll get eagle-s\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstopped and put his head under the sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cSliding Billy\xe2\x80\x9d Turner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love women you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a dose,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nlove horses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you said that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout horses and eagles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. And if you love sheets.\xe2\x80\x9d He breathed on the sheet and stroked\r\nhis nose against it. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about sheets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just\r\nstarted to love this sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Turner said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a lot to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d William Campbell said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s got to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right, Billy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was never so happy in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine. You go along. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just lie here for a little while. Around\r\nnoon I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Turner came up to William Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s room at noon William\r\nCampbell was sleeping and as Mr. Turner was a man who knew what things\r\nin life were very valuable he did not wake him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TO-DAY IS FRIDAY\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Three Roman soldiers are in a drinking-place at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\n    at night. There are barrels around the wall. Behind the wooden\r\n    counter is a Hebrew wine-seller. The three Roman soldiers are a\r\n    little cock-eyed._\r\n\r\n_1st Roman Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94You tried the red?\r\n\r\n_2d Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94No, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t tried it.\r\n\r\n_1st Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94You better try it.\r\n\r\n_2d Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94All right, George, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a round of the red.\r\n\r\n_Hebrew Wine-seller_\xe2\x80\x94Here you are, gentlemen.

I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsaying whether he was good or not. What I mean is, when the time comes.\r\nWhen they first start nailing him, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t none of them wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop it if they could.\r\n\r\n_1st Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you follow it, George?\r\n\r\n_Wine-seller_\xe2\x80\x94No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take any interest in it, Lootenant.\r\n\r\n_1st Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94I was surprised how he acted.\r\n\r\n_3d Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94The part I don\xe2\x80\x99t like is the nailing them on. You know,\r\nthat must get to you pretty bad.\r\n\r\n_2d Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94It isn\xe2\x80\x99t that that\xe2\x80\x99s so bad, as when they first lift \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nup. [_He makes a lifting gesture with his two palms together._] When the\r\nweight starts to pull on \xe2\x80\x99em. That\xe2\x80\x99s when it gets \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\n_3d Roman Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94It takes some of them pretty bad.\r\n\r\n_1st Soldier_\xe2\x80\x94Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I seen \xe2\x80\x99em?

Outside, the snow\r\nwas turning to rain. Inside, the electric stove seemed to give no heat\r\nand rising from his writing-table, he sat down upon the stove. How good\r\nit felt! Here, at last, was life.\r\n\r\nHe reached for another orange. Far away in Paris, Mascart had knocked\r\nDanny Frush cuckoo in the second round. Far off in Mesopotamia,\r\ntwenty-one feet of snow had fallen.

He laid down the booklet.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile, stretched flat on a bed in a darkened room in his house\r\nin Triana, Manuel Garcia Maera lay with a tube in each lung, drowning\r\nwith the pneumonia. All the papers in Andalucia devoted special\r\nsupplements to his death, which had been expected for some days. Men and\r\nboys bought full-length colored pictures of him to remember him by, and\r\nlost the picture they had of him in their memories by looking at the\r\nlithographs. Bull-fighters were very relieved he was dead, because he\r\ndid always in the bull-ring the things they could only do sometimes.\r\nThey all marched in the rain behind his coffin and there were one\r\nhundred and forty-seven bull-fighters followed him out to the cemetery,\r\nwhere they buried him in the tomb next to Joselito. After the funeral\r\nevery one sat in the caf\xc3\xa9s out of the rain, and many colored pictures of\r\nMaera were sold to men who rolled them up and put them away in their\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOW I LAY ME\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT night we lay on the floor in the room and I listened to the\r\nsilk-worms eating. The silk-worms fed in racks of mulberry leaves and\r\nall night you could hear them eating and a dropping sound in the leaves.\r\nI myself did not want to sleep because I had been living for a long time\r\nwith the knowledge that if I ever shut my eyes in the dark and let\r\nmyself go, my soul would go out of my body. I had been that way for a\r\nlong time, ever since I had been blown up at night and felt it go out of\r\nme and go off and then come back. I tried never to think about it, but\r\nit had started to go since, in the nights, just at the moment of going\r\noff to sleep, and I could only stop it by a very great effort. So while\r\nnow I am fairly sure that it would not really have gone out, yet then,\r\nthat summer, I was unwilling to make the experiment.\r\n\r\nI had different ways of occupying myself while I lay awake. I would\r\nthink of a trout stream I had fished along when I was a boy and fish its\r\nwhole length very carefully in my mind; fishing very carefully under all\r\nthe logs, all the turns of the bank, the deep holes and the clear\r\nshallow stretches, sometimes catching trout and sometimes losing them. I\r\nwould stop fishing at noon to eat my lunch; sometimes on a log over the\r\nstream; sometimes on a high bank under a tree, and I always ate my lunch\r\nvery slowly and watched the stream below me while I ate. Often I ran out\r\nof bait because I would take only ten worms with me in a tobacco tin\r\nwhen I started. When I had used them all I had to find more worms, and\r\nsometimes it was very difficult digging in the bank of the stream where\r\nthe cedar trees kept out the sun and there was no grass but only the\r\nbare moist earth and often I could find no worms. Always though I found\r\nsome kind of bait, but one time in the swamp I could find no bait at all\r\nand had to cut up one of the trout I had caught and use him for bait.\r\n\r\nSometimes I found insects in the swamp meadows, in the grass or under\r\nferns, and used them. There were beetles and insects with legs like\r\ngrass stems, and grubs in old rotten logs; white grubs with brown\r\npinching heads that would not stay on the hook and emptied into nothing\r\nin the cold water, and wood ticks under logs where sometimes I found\r\nangle-worms that slipped into the ground as soon as the log was raised.\r\nOnce I used a salamander from under an old log. The salamander was very\r\nsmall and neat and agile and a lovely color. He had tiny feet that tried\r\nto hold on to the hook, and after that one time I never used a\r\nsalamander, although I found them very often. Nor did I use crickets,\r\nbecause of the way they acted about the hook.\r\n\r\nSometimes the stream ran through an open meadow, and in the dry grass I\r\nwould catch grasshoppers and use them for bait and sometimes I would\r\ncatch grasshoppers and toss them into the stream and watch them float\r\nalong swimming on the stream and circling on the surface as the current\r\ntook them and then disappear as a trout rose. Sometimes I would fish\r\nfour or five different streams in the night; starting as near as I could\r\nget to their source and fishing them down stream. When I had finished\r\ntoo quickly and the time did not go, I would fish the stream over again,\r\nstarting where it emptied into the lake and fishing back up stream,\r\ntrying for all the trout I had missed coming down. Some nights too I\r\nmade up streams, and some of them were very exciting, and it was like\r\nbeing awake and dreaming. Some of those streams I still remember and\r\nthink that I have fished in them, and they are confused with streams I\r\nreally know. I gave them all names and went to them on the train and\r\nsometimes walked for miles to get to them.\r\n\r\nBut some nights I could not fish, and on those nights I was cold-awake\r\nand said my prayers over and over and tried to pray for all the people I\r\nhad ever known. That took up a great amount of time, for if you try to\r\nremember all the people you have ever known, going back to the earliest\r\nthing you remember\xe2\x80\x94which was, with me, the attic of the house where I\r\nwas born and my mother and father\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-cake in a tin box hanging\r\nfrom one of the rafters, and, in the attic, jars of snakes and other\r\nspecimens that my father had collected as a boy and preserved in\r\nalcohol, the alcohol sunken in the jars so the backs of some of the\r\nsnakes and specimens were exposed and had turned white\xe2\x80\x94if you thought\r\nback that far, you remembered a great many people. If you prayed for all\r\nof them, saying a Hail Mary and an Our Father for each one, it took a\r\nlong time and finally it would be light, and then you could go to sleep,\r\nif you were in a place where you could sleep in the daylight.\r\n\r\nOn those nights I tried to remember everything that had ever happened to\r\nme, starting with just before I went to the war and remembering back\r\nfrom one thing to another. I found I could only remember back to that\r\nattic in my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s house. Then I would start there and remember\r\nthis way again, until I reached the war.\r\n\r\nI remembered, after my grandfather died we moved away from that house\r\nand to a new house designed and built by my mother. Many things that\r\nwere not to be moved were burned in the back-yard and I remember those\r\njars from the attic being thrown in the fire, and how they popped in the\r\nheat and the fire flamed up from the alcohol. I remember the snakes\r\nburning in the fire in the back-yard. But there were no people in that,\r\nonly things. I could not remember who burned the things even, and I\r\nwould go on until I came to people and then stop and pray for them.\r\n\r\nAbout the new house I remembered how my mother was always cleaning\r\nthings out and making a good clearance. One time when my father was away\r\non a hunting trip she made a good thorough cleaning out in the basement\r\nand burned everything that should not have been there. When my father\r\ncame home and got down from his buggy and hitched the horse, the fire\r\nwas still burning in the road beside the house. I went out to meet him.\r\nHe handed me his shotgun and looked at the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been cleaning out the basement, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d my mother said from the\r\nporch. She was standing there smiling, to meet him. My father looked at\r\nthe fire and kicked at something. Then he leaned over and picked\r\nsomething out of the ashes. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a rake, Nick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me. I went to\r\nthe basement and brought a rake and my father raked very carefully in\r\nthe ashes. He raked out stone axes and stone skinning knives and tools\r\nfor making arrow-heads and pieces of pottery and many arrow-heads. They\r\nhad all been blackened and chipped by the fire. My father raked them all\r\nout very carefully and spread them on the grass by the road. His shotgun\r\nin its leather case and his game-bags were on the grass where he had\r\nleft them when he stepped down from the buggy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the gun and the bags in the house, Nick, and bring me a paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. My mother had gone inside the house. I took the shotgun, which was\r\nheavy to carry and banged against my legs, and the two game-bags and\r\nstarted toward the house. \xe2\x80\x9cTake them one at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d my father said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try and carry too much at once.\xe2\x80\x9d I put down the game-bags and\r\ntook in the shotgun and brought out a newspaper from the pile in my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s office. My father spread all the blackened, chipped stone\r\nimplements on the paper and then wrapped them up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best arrow-heads\r\nwent all to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He walked into the house with the paper\r\npackage and I stayed outside on the grass with the two game-bags. After\r\na while I took them in. In remembering that, there were only two people,\r\nso I would pray for them both.\r\n\r\nSome nights, though, I could not remember my prayers even. I could only\r\nget as far as \xe2\x80\x9cOn earth as it is in heaven\xe2\x80\x9d and then have to start all\r\nover and be absolutely unable to get past that. Then I would have to\r\nrecognize that I could not remember and give up saying my prayers that\r\nnight and try something else. So on some nights I would try to remember\r\nall the animals in the world by name and then the birds and then fishes\r\nand then countries and cities and then kinds of food and the names of\r\nall the streets I could remember in Chicago, and when I could not\r\nremember anything at all any more I would just listen. And I do not\r\nremember a night on which you could not hear things. If I could have a\r\nlight I was not afraid to sleep, because I knew my soul would only go\r\nout of me if it were dark. So, of course, many nights I was where I\r\ncould have a light and then I slept because I was nearly always tired\r\nand often very sleepy. And I am sure many times too that I slept without\r\nknowing it\xe2\x80\x94but I never slept knowing it, and on this night I listened\r\nto the silk-worms. You can hear silk-worms eating very clearly in the\r\nnight and I lay with my eyes open and listened to them.\r\n\r\nThere was only one other person in the room and he was awake too. I\r\nlistened to him being awake, for a long time. He could not lie as\r\nquietly as I could because, perhaps, he had not had as much practice\r\nbeing awake. We were lying on blankets spread over straw and when he\r\nmoved the straw was noisy, but the silk-worms were not frightened by any\r\nnoise we made and ate on steadily. There were the noises of night seven\r\nkilometres behind the lines outside but they were different from the\r\nsmall noises inside the room in the dark. The other man in the room\r\ntried lying quietly. Then he moved again. I moved too, so he would know\r\nI was awake. He had lived ten years in Chicago. They had taken him for a\r\nsoldier in nineteen fourteen when he had come back to visit his family,\r\nand they had given him to me for an orderly because he spoke English. I\r\nheard him listening, so I moved again in the blankets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you sleep, Signor Tenente?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou feel all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. I feel good. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to talk a while?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. What can you talk about in this damn place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis place is pretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about out in Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you all that once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about how you got married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the letter you got Monday\xe2\x80\x94from her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. She writes me all the time. She\xe2\x80\x99s making good money with the\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nice place when you go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. She runs it fine. She\xe2\x80\x99s making a lot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think we\xe2\x80\x99ll wake them up, talking?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. They can\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Anyway, they sleep like pigs. I\xe2\x80\x99m different,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWant a smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe smoked skilfully in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke much, Signor Tenente.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just about cut it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit don\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good and I suppose you get so you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t miss it. Did you ever hear a blind man won\xe2\x80\x99t smoke because he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see the smoke come out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s all bull, myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just heard it somewhere.\r\nYou know how you hear things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were both quiet and I listened to the silk-worms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear those damn silk-worms?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can hear them chew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Signor Tenente, is there something really the matter that you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep? I never see you sleep. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept nights ever since\r\nI been with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, John,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got in pretty bad shape along early\r\nlast spring and at night it bothers me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have ever got in this war. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntoo nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it will get better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Signor Tenente, what did you get in this war for, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, John. I wanted to, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to talk out loud,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey sleep just like pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t understand the English\r\nlanguage, anyway. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know a damn thing. What are you going to do\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s over and we go back to the States?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get a job on a paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Chicago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever read what this fellow Brisbane writes? My wife cuts it out\r\nfor me and sends it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever meet him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet that fellow. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine writer. My wife don\xe2\x80\x99t read\r\nEnglish but she takes the paper just like when I was home and she cuts\r\nout the editorials and the sport page and sends them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are your kids?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re fine. One of the girls is in the fourth grade now. You know,\r\nSignor Tenente, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the kids I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be your orderly\r\nnow. They\xe2\x80\x99d have made me stay in the line all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I. They\xe2\x80\x99re fine kids but I want a boy. Three girls and no boy.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you try and go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep now. I\xe2\x80\x99m wide awake now, Signor Tenente. Say, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nworried about you not sleeping though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine a young fellow like you not to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get all right. It just takes a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to get all right. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t get along that don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. Do\r\nyou worry about anything? You got anything on your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, John, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to get married, Signor Tenente. Then you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to get married. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you pick out some nice Italian girl\r\nwith plenty of money. You could get any one you want. You\xe2\x80\x99re young and\r\nyou got good decorations and you look nice. You been wounded a couple of\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk the language well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk it fine. To hell with talking the language. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\ntalk to them. Marry them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know some girls, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you marry the one with the most money. Over here, the way they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbrought up, they\xe2\x80\x99ll all make you a good wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think about it, Signor Tenente. Do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man ought to be married. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never regret it. Every man ought to\r\nbe married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try and sleep a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Signor Tenente. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it again. But you remember what I\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remember it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow let\xe2\x80\x99s sleep a while, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you sleep, Signor Tenente.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard him roll in his blankets on the straw and then he was very quiet\r\nand I listened to him breathing regularly. Then he started to snore. I\r\nlistened to him snore for a long time and then I stopped listening to\r\nhim snore and listened to the silk-worms eating. They ate steadily,\r\nmaking a dropping in the leaves. I had a new thing to think about and I\r\nlay in the dark with my eyes open and thought of all the girls I had\r\never known and what kind of wives they would make. It was a very\r\ninteresting thing to think about and for a while it killed off\r\ntrout-fishing and interfered with my prayers. Finally, though, I went\r\nback to trout-fishing, because I found that I could remember all the\r\nstreams and there was always something new about them, while the girls,\r\nafter I had thought about them a few times, blurred and I could not call\r\nthem into my mind and finally they all blurred and all became rather the\r\nsame and I gave up thinking about them almost altogether. But I kept on\r\nwith my prayers and I prayed very often for John in the nights and his\r\nclass was removed from active service before the October offensive. I\r\nwas glad he was not there, because he would have been a great worry to\r\nme. He came to the hospital in Milan to see me several months after and\r\nwas very disappointed that I had not yet married, and I know he would\r\nfeel very badly if he knew that, so far, I have never married. He was\r\ngoing back to America and he was very certain about marriage and knew it\r\nwould fix up everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TRANSCRIBER NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nMisspelled words and printer errors have been corrected.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
