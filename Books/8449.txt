But I had swung fairly into my story; its\r\npeople were about me all the time; I dwelt amid its events and places, and\r\nI did not see how I could welcome my guest among them, or abandon them for\r\nhim. Still, when he actually arrived, and I took his hand as he stepped\r\nfrom the train, I found it less difficult to say that I was glad to see\r\nhim than I expected. In fact, I was glad, for I could not look upon his\r\nface without feeling a glow of kindness for him. I had not the least\r\ntrouble in identifying him, for he was so unlike all the Americans who\r\ndismounted from the train with him, and who all looked hot, worried, and\r\nanxious. He was a man no longer young, but in what we call the heyday of\r\nlife, when our own people are so absorbed in making provision for the\r\nfuture that they may be said not to live in the present at all. This\r\nAltrurian\xe2\x80\x99s whole countenance, and especially his quiet, gentle eyes,\r\nexpressed a vast contemporaneity, with bounds of leisure removed to the\r\nend of time; or, at least, this was the effect of something in them which\r\nI am obliged to report in rather fantastic terms. He was above the middle\r\nheight, and he carried himself vigorously. His face was sunburned, or\r\nsea-burned, where it was not bearded; and, although I knew from my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s letter that he was a man of learning and distinction in his own\r\ncountry, I should never have supposed him a person of scholarly life, he\r\nwas so far from sicklied over with anything like the pale cast of thought.\r\nWhen he took the hand I offered him in my half-hearted welcome he gave it\r\na grasp that decided me to confine our daily greetings to something much\r\nless muscular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me have your bag,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as we do when we meet people at the train,\r\nand he instantly bestowed a rather heavy valise upon me, with a smile in\r\nhis benignant eyes, as if it had been the greatest favor. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got\r\nany checks?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in very good English, but with an accent new to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbought two.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave them to me, and I passed them to our hotel porter,\r\nwho was waiting there with the baggage-cart. Then I proposed that we\r\nshould walk across the meadow to the house, which is a quarter of a mile\r\nor so from the station. We started, but he stopped suddenly and looked\r\nback over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be troubled about your trunks,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe porter will get them to the house all right. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be in your\r\nroom by the time we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s putting them into the wagon himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he always does that. He\xe2\x80\x99s a strong young fellow. He\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it.\r\nYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d I could not finish saying he need not mind the porter; he\r\nwas rushing back to the station, and I had the mortification of seeing him\r\ntake an end of each trunk and help the porter toss it into the wagon; some\r\nlighter pieces he put in himself, and he did not stop till all the baggage\r\nthe train had left was disposed of.\r\n\r\nI stood holding his valise, unable to put it down in my embarrassment at\r\nthis eccentric performance, which had been evident not to me alone, but to\r\nall the people who arrived by the train, and all their friends who came\r\nfrom the hotel to meet them. A number of these passed me on the tally-ho\r\ncoach; and a lady, who had got her husband with her for over Sunday, and\r\nwas in very good spirits, called gayly down to me: \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend seems fond\r\nof exercise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, dryly; the sparkling repartee which ought to have come\r\nto my help failed to show up. But it was impossible to be vexed with the\r\nAltrurian when he returned to me, unruffled by his bout with the baggage\r\nand serenely smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI fancied that good fellow was ashamed of my\r\nhelping him. I hope it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem a reflection upon him in any way before\r\nyour people? I ought to have thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess we can make it right with him. I dare say he felt more surprised\r\nthan disgraced. But we must make haste a little now; your train was half\r\nan hour late, and we shall not stand so good a chance for supper if we are\r\nnot there pretty promptly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with evasive lightness, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst come, first served, you\r\nknow. That\xe2\x80\x99s human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, and he looked at me as one does who suspects another\r\nof joking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted; but I hurried to add: \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I want to\r\nhave time after supper to show you a bit of our landscape. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nenjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d I knew he had arrived in Boston that morning by steamer, and I\r\nnow thought it high time to ask him: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think of America,\r\nanyway?\xe2\x80\x9d I ought really to have asked him this the moment he stepped from\r\nthe train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m intensely interested,\xe2\x80\x9d and I perceived that he spoke\r\nwith a certain reservation. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the most advanced country of its time,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve always been very curious to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last sentence raised my dashed spirits again, and I said, confidently:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must find our system of baggage-checks delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d I said this\r\nbecause it is one of the first things we brag of to foreigners, and I had\r\nthe habit of it. \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-way,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to add, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you meant to\r\nsay you _brought_ two checks when I asked you for them at the train just\r\nnow? But you really said you _bought_ them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI gave half a dollar apiece for them at the\r\nstation in Boston. I saw other people doing it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, noting my\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it the custom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet, on most of our roads. They were tipping\r\nthe baggage-man, to make sure that he checked their baggage in time and\r\nput it on the train. I had to do that myself when I came up; otherwise it\r\nmight have got along here some time next day. But the system is perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor man looked quite worn out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am glad I\r\ngave him something. He seemed to have several hundred pieces of baggage to\r\nlook after, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t embarrassed like your porter by my helping him\r\nput my trunks into the car. May I confess that the meanness of the\r\nstation, its insufficient facilities, its shabby waiting-rooms, and its\r\nwhole crowded and confused appearance gave me rather a bad impression?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d I had to own, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s shameful; but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found\r\nanother station in the city so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose this particular road is too\r\npoor to employ more baggage-men or build new stations; they seemed rather\r\nshabby all the way up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I was obliged to confess, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s one of the richest roads in\r\nthe country. The stock stands at about 180. But I\xe2\x80\x99m really afraid we shall\r\nbe late to supper if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get on,\xe2\x80\x9d I broke off; though I was not\r\naltogether sorry to arrive after the porter had disposed of the baggage. I\r\ndreaded another display of active sympathy on the part of my strange\r\ncompanion; I have often felt sorry myself for the porters of hotels, but I\r\nhave never thought of offering to help them handle the heavy trunks that\r\nthey manage.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian was delighted with the hotel; and in fact it did look\r\nextremely pretty, with its branching piazzas full of well-dressed people,\r\nand its green lawns where the children were playing. I led the way to the\r\nroom which I had taken for him next my own; it was simply furnished, but\r\nit was sweet with matting, fresh linen, and pure whitewashed walls. I\r\nflung open the window-blinds and let him get a glimpse of the mountains\r\npurpling under the sunset, the lake beneath, and the deeply foliaged\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlorious! glorious!\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I modestly assented. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think that\xe2\x80\x99s rather fine.\xe2\x80\x9d He stood\r\ntranced before the window, and I thought I had better say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t give you much time to get the dust of travel off; the dining-room\r\ndoors close at eight, and we must hurry down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pulling off his coat.\r\n\r\nI waited impatiently at the foot of the stairs, avoiding the question I\r\nmet on the lips and in the eyes of my acquaintance. The fame of my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s behavior at the station must have spread through the whole place;\r\nand everybody wished to know who he was. I answered simply he was a\r\ntraveler from Altruria; and in some cases I went further and explained\r\nthat the Altrurians were peculiar.\r\n\r\nIn much less time than it seemed my friend found me; and then I had a\r\nlittle compensation for my suffering in his behalf. I could see that,\r\nwhatever people said of him, they felt the same mysterious liking at\r\nsight of him that I had felt. He had made a little change in his dress,\r\nand I perceived that the women thought him not only good-looking but\r\nwell-dressed. They followed him with their eyes as we went into the\r\ndining-room, and I was rather proud of being with him, as if I somehow\r\nshared the credit of his clothes and good looks. The Altrurian himself\r\nseemed most struck with the head-waiter, who showed us to our places, and\r\nwhile we were waiting for our supper I found a chance to explain that he\r\nwas a divinity student from one of the fresh-water colleges, and was\r\nserving here during his summer vacation. This seemed to interest my friend\r\nso much that I went on to tell him that many of the waitresses, whom he\r\nsaw standing there subject to the order of the guests, were country\r\nschool-mistresses in the winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is as it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the kind of thing I\r\nexpected to meet with in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I responded, in my flattered national vanity, \xe2\x80\x9cif America means\r\nanything at all it means the honor of work and the recognition of personal\r\nworth everywhere. I hope you are going to make a long stay with us. We\r\nlike to have travelers visit us who can interpret the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions as well as read their letter. As a rule Europeans never quite\r\nget our point of view. Now a great many of these waitresses are ladies, in\r\nthe true sense of the word--selfrespectful, intelligent, refined, and fit\r\nto grace--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was interrupted by the noise my friend made in suddenly pushing back his\r\nchair and getting to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nill, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not hear me. He had run half down the dining-hall toward the\r\nslender young girl who was bringing us our supper. I had ordered rather\r\ngenerously, for my friend had owned to a good appetite, and I was hungry\r\nmyself with waiting for him, so that the tray the girl carried was piled\r\nup with heavy dishes. To my dismay I saw, rather than heard at that\r\ndistance, the Altrurian enter into a polite controversy with her, and\r\nthen, as if overcoming all her scruples by sheer strength of will, possess\r\nhimself of the tray and make off with it toward our table. The poor child\r\nfollowed him, blushing to her hair; the head-waiter stood looking\r\nhelplessly on; the guests, who at that late hour were fortunately few,\r\nwere simply aghast at the scandal; the Altrurian alone seemed to think\r\nhis conduct the most natural thing in the world. He put the tray on the\r\nside-table near us, and in spite of our waitress\xe2\x80\x99s protests insisted upon\r\narranging the little bird-bath dishes before our plates. Then at last he\r\nsat down, and the girl, flushed and tremulous, left the room, as I could\r\nnot help suspecting, to have a good cry in the kitchen. She did not come\r\nback, and the head-waiter, who was perhaps afraid to send another in her\r\nplace, looked after our few wants himself. He kept a sharp eye on my\r\nfriend, as if he were not quite sure he was safe, but the Altrurian\r\nresumed the conversation with all that lightness of spirits which I\r\nnoticed in him after he helped the porter with the baggage. I did not\r\nthink it the moment to take him to task for what he had just done; I was\r\nnot even sure that it was the part of a host to do so at all, and between\r\nthe one doubt and the other I left the burden of talk to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming young creature!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw anything prettier\r\nthan the way she had of refusing my help, absolutely without coquetry or\r\naffectation of any kind. She is, as you said, a perfect lady, and she\r\ngraces her work, as I am sure she would grace any exigency of life. She\r\nquite realizes my ideal of an American girl, and I see now what the spirit\r\nof your country must be from such an expression of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wished to tell him that while a country school-teacher who waits at\r\ntable in a summer hotel is very much to be respected in her sphere, she is\r\nnot regarded with that high honor which some other women command among us;\r\nbut I did not find this very easy, after what I had said of our esteem for\r\nlabor; and while I was thinking how I could hedge, my friend went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked England greatly, and I liked the English, but I could not like\r\nthe theory of their civilization or the aristocratic structure of their\r\nsociety. It seemed to me iniquitous, for we believe that inequality and\r\niniquity are the same in the last analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this I found myself able to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is something terrible,\r\nsomething shocking, in the frank brutality with which Englishmen affirm\r\nthe essential inequality of men. The affirmation of the essential equality\r\nof men was the first point of departure with us when we separated from\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cHow grandly it is expressed in your\r\nglorious Declaration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have read our Declaration of Independence, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Altrurian has read that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on smoothly, and I hoped to render what I was going to say\r\nthe means of enlightening him without offence concerning the little\r\nmistake he had just made with the waitress, \xe2\x80\x9cof course we don\xe2\x80\x99t take that\r\nin its closest literality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know it was rather the political than the social traditions of\r\nEngland that we broke with, in the Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you break with monarchy and nobility,\r\nand ranks and classes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we broke with all those things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I found them a part of the social as well as the political structure\r\nin England. You have no kings or nobles here. Have you any ranks or\r\nclasses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not exactly in the English sense. Our ranks and classes, such as we\r\nhave, are what I may call voluntary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I understand. I suppose that from time to time certain ones among you\r\nfeel the need of serving, and ask leave of the commonwealth to subordinate\r\nthemselves to the rest of the state and perform all the lowlier offices in\r\nit. Such persons must be held in peculiar honor. Is it something like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s quite like that. In fact I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nlet you trust to your own observation of our life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, with a simplicity so fine that it was\r\na long time before I could believe it quite real, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall approach\r\nit so much more intelligently with a little instruction from you. You say\r\nthat your social divisions are voluntary. But do I understand that those\r\nwho serve among you do not wish to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose they would serve if they could help it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, with a look of horror, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that\r\nthey are slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! oh no!\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe war put an end to that. We are all free now,\r\nblack and white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they do not wish to serve, and are not held in peculiar honor for\r\nserving--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that my word \xe2\x80\x98voluntary\xe2\x80\x99 has misled you,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nword exactly. The divisions among us are rather a process of natural\r\nselection. You will see, as you get better acquainted with the workings of\r\nour institutions, that there are no arbitrary distinctions here but the\r\nfitness of the work for the man and the man for the work determines the\r\nsocial rank that each one holds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is fine!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Altrurian, with a glow of enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nI suppose that these intelligent young people who teach school in winter\r\nand serve at table in the summer are in a sort of provisional state,\r\nwaiting for the process of natural selection to determine whether they\r\nshall finally be teachers or waiters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it might be stated in some such terms,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented, though I was not\r\naltogether easy in my mind. It seemed to me that I was not quite candid\r\nwith this most candid spirit. I added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know we are a sort of\r\nfatalists here in America. We are great believers in the doctrine that it\r\nwill all come out right in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cif the process of\r\nnatural selection works so perfectly among you as you say. But I am afraid\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this matter of your domestic service yet. I believe you\r\nsaid that all honest work is honored in America. Then no social slight\r\nattaches to service, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that, exactly. The fact is, a certain social slight\r\ndoes attach to service, and that is one reason why I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like to\r\nhave students wait at table. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant for them to remember it\r\nin after-life, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant for their children to remember\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the slight would descend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would. One wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to think one\xe2\x80\x99s father or mother had\r\nbeen at service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian said nothing for a moment. Then he remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems\r\nthat while all honest work is honored among you, there are some kinds of\r\nhonest work that are not honored so much as others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause some occupations are more degrading than others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted, as I thought, a little unreasonably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must leave you to imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, if domestic service is\r\ndegrading in your eyes, and people are not willing servants among you, may\r\nI ask why any are servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a question of bread-and-butter. They are obliged to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, they are forced to do work that is hateful and disgraceful to\r\nthem because they cannot live without?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, not at all liking this sort of pursuit, and feeling\r\nit fair to turn even upon a guest who kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it so with you in\r\nAltruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so once,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not now. In fact, it is like a waking\r\ndream to find one\xe2\x80\x99s self in the presence of conditions here that we\r\noutlived so long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an unconscious superiority in this speech that nettled me, and\r\nstung me to retort: \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not expect to outlive them. We regard them as\r\nfinal, and as indestructibly based in human nature itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, with a delicate and caressing courtesy, \xe2\x80\x9chave I\r\nsaid something offensive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I hastened to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not surprising that you did not\r\nget our point of view exactly. You will by-and-by, and then, I think, you\r\nwill see that it is the true one. We have found that the logic of our\r\nconvictions could not be applied to the problem of domestic service. It is\r\neverywhere a very curious and perplexing problem. The simple old solution\r\nof the problem was to own your servants; but we found that this was not\r\nconsistent with the spirit of our free institutions. As soon as it was\r\nabandoned the anomaly began. We had outlived the primitive period when the\r\nhousekeeper worked with her domestics and they were her help, and were\r\ncalled so; and we had begun to have servants to do all the household work,\r\nand to call them so. This state of things never seemed right to some of\r\nour purest and best people. They fancied, as you seem to have done, that\r\nto compel people through their necessities to do your hateful drudgery,\r\nand to wound and shame them with a name which every American instinctively\r\nresents, was neither republican nor Christian. Some of our thinkers tried\r\nto mend matters by making their domestics a part of their families; and in\r\nthe life of Emerson you\xe2\x80\x99ll find an amusing account of his attempt to have\r\nhis servant eat at the same table with himself and his wife. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwork. He and his wife could stand it, but the servant couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paused, for this was where the laugh ought to have come in. The\r\nAltrurian did not laugh, he merely asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because the servant knew, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, that they were a whole\r\nworld apart in their traditions, and were no more fit to associate than\r\nNew-Englanders and New-Zealanders. In the mere matter of education--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you said that these young girls who wait at table here were\r\nteachers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon; I ought to have explained. By this time it had\r\nbecome impossible, as it now is, to get American girls to take service\r\nexcept on some such unusual terms as we have in a summer hotel; and the\r\ndomestics were already ignorant foreigners, fit for nothing else. In such\r\na place as this it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. It is more as if the girls worked in a\r\nshop or a factory. They command their own time, in a measure, their hours\r\nare tolerably fixed, and they have one another\xe2\x80\x99s society. In a private\r\nfamily they would be subject to order at all times, and they would have no\r\nsocial life. They would be in the family, out not of it. American girls\r\nunderstand this, and so they won\xe2\x80\x99t go out to service in the usual way.\r\nEven in a summer hotel the relation has its odious aspects. The system of\r\ngiving fees seems to me degrading to those who have to take them. To offer\r\na student or a teacher a dollar for personal service--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t right, or I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make it so. In fact, the whole thing is rather anomalous with us.\r\nThe best that you can say of it is that it works, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nelse to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cjust why domestic service is\r\ndegrading in a country where all kinds of work are honored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow, I have done my best to explain. As I intimated\r\nbefore, we distinguish; and in the different kinds of labor we distinguish\r\nagainst domestic service. I dare say it is partly because of the loss of\r\nindependence which it involves. People naturally despise a dependant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian, with that innocence of his which I was\r\nbeginning to find rather trying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it implies weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is weakness considered despicable among you?\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn every community it is despised practically, if not theoretically,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ntried to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing that America has done is to offer the\r\nrace an opportunity--the opportunity for any man to rise above the rest\r\nand to take the highest place, if he is able.\xe2\x80\x9d I had always been proud of\r\nthis fact, and I thought I had put it very well, but the Altrurian did not\r\nseem much impressed by it.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not see how it differs from any country of the past in\r\nthat. But perhaps you mean that to rise carries with it an obligation\r\nto those below \xe2\x80\x98If any is first among you, let him be your servant.\xe2\x80\x99 Is it\r\nsomething like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is not quite like that,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, remembering how very little\r\nour self-made men as a class had done for others. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one is expected\r\nto look out for himself here. I fancy that there would be very little\r\nrising if men were expected to rise for the sake of others, in America.\r\nHow is it with you in Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded, hoping to get out of a\r\ncertain discomfort I felt in that way. \xe2\x80\x9cDo your risen men generally devote\r\nthemselves to the good of the community after they get to the top?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no rising among us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with what seemed a perception of\r\nthe harsh spirit of my question; and he paused a moment before he asked in\r\nhis turn: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do men rise among you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be rather a long story,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, putting it in the\r\nrough, I should say that they rose by their talents, their shrewdness,\r\ntheir ability to seize an advantage and turn it to their own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that considered noble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is considered smart. It is considered at the worst far better than a\r\ndead level of equality. Are all men equal in Altruria? Are they all alike\r\ngifted or beautiful, or short or tall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are only equal in duties and in rights. But, as you said just\r\nnow, that is a very long story. Are they equal in nothing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are equal in opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d breathed the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to feel a little uneasy, and I was not quite sure that this last\r\nassertion of mine would hold water. Everybody but ourselves had now left\r\nthe dining-room, and I saw the head-waiter eying us impatiently. I pushed\r\nback my chair and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to seem to hurry you, but I should like\r\nto show you a very pretty sunset effect we have here before it is too\r\ndark. When we get back, I want to introduce you to a few of my friends. Of\r\ncourse, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that there is a good deal of curiosity about\r\nyou, especially among the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I found that the case in England, largely. It was the women who\r\ncared most to meet me. I understand that in America society is managed\r\neven more by women than it is in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s entirely in their hands,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with the satisfaction we all feel\r\nin the fact. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no other leisure class. The richest men among us are\r\ngenerally hard workers; devotion to business is the rule; but, as soon as\r\na man reaches the point where he can afford to pay for domestic service,\r\nhis wife and daughters expect to be released from it to the cultivation of\r\ntheir minds and the enjoyment of social pleasures. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite right.\r\nThat is what makes them so delightful to foreigners. You must have heard\r\ntheir praises chanted in England. The English find our men rather stupid,\r\nI believe; but they think our women are charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was told that the wives of their nobility were sometimes\r\nAmericans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cThe English think that you regard such\r\nmarriages as a great honor, and that they are very gratifying to your\r\nnational pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose that is so in a measure,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine that it\r\nwill not be long before the English aristocracy derives as largely from\r\nAmerican millionaires as from kings\xe2\x80\x99 mistresses. Not,\xe2\x80\x9d I added,\r\nvirtuously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we approve of aristocracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I understand that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall hope to get your\r\npoint of view in this matter more distinctly by-and-by. As yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nlittle vague about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can gradually make it clear to you,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe left the hotel, and I began to walk my friend across the meadow toward\r\nthe lake. I wished him to see the reflection of the afterglow in its still\r\nwaters, with the noble lines of the mountain-range that glassed itself\r\nthere; the effect is one of the greatest charms of that lovely region, the\r\nsojourn of the sweetest summer in the world, and I am always impatient to\r\nshow it to strangers.\r\n\r\nWe climbed the meadow wall and passed through a stretch of woods to a path\r\nleading down to the shore, and, as we loitered along in the tender gloom\r\nof the forest, the music of the hermit-thrushes rang all round us like\r\ncrystal bells, like silver flutes, like the drip of fountains, like the\r\nchoiring of still-eyed cherubim. We stopped from time to time and\r\nlistened, while the shy birds sang unseen in their covert of shadows; but\r\nwe did not speak till we emerged from the trees and suddenly stood upon\r\nthe naked knoll overlooking the lake.\r\n\r\nThen I explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThe woods used to come down to the shore here, and we\r\nhad their mystery and music to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge; but last winter the owner\r\ncut the timber off. It looks rather ragged now.\xe2\x80\x9d I had to recognize the\r\nfact, for I saw the Altrurian staring about him over the clearing in a\r\nkind of horror. It was a squalid ruin, a graceless desolation, which not\r\neven the pitying twilight could soften. The stumps showed their hideous\r\nmutilation everywhere; the brush had been burned, and the fires had\r\nscorched and blackened the lean soil of the hill-slope and blasted it with\r\nsterility. A few weak saplings, withered by the flames, drooped and\r\nstraggled about; it would be a century before the forces of nature could\r\nrepair the waste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say the owner did this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is the owner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it does seem too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a\r\ngood deal of feeling about it. The neighbors tried to buy him off before\r\nhe began the destruction, for they knew the value of the woods as an\r\nattraction to summer-boarders; the city cottagers, of course, wanted to\r\nsave them, and together they offered for the land pretty nearly as much as\r\nthe timber was worth. But he had got it into his head that the land here\r\nby the lake would sell for building lots if it was cleared, and he could\r\nmake money on that as well as on the trees; and so they had to go. Of\r\ncourse, one might say that he was deficient in public spirit, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nblame him, altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian assented, somewhat to my surprise, I confess.\r\n\r\nI resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no one else to look after his interests, and it was\r\nnot only his right but his duty to get the most he could for himself and\r\nhis own, according to his best light. That is what I tell people when they\r\nfall foul of him for his want of public spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble seems to be, then, in the system that obliges each man to be\r\nthe guardian of his own interests. Is that what you blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I consider it a very perfect system. It is based upon individuality,\r\nand we believe that individuality is the principle that differences\r\ncivilized men from savages, from the lower animals, and makes us a nation\r\ninstead of a tribe or a herd. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of us, no matter how much he\r\ncensured this man\xe2\x80\x99s want of public spirit, but would resent the slightest\r\ninterference with his property rights. The woods were his; he had the\r\nright to do what he pleased with his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand you that, in America, a man may do what is wrong with his\r\nown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may do anything with his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the injury of others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not in person or property. But he may hurt them in taste and\r\nsentiment as much as he likes. Can\xe2\x80\x99t a man do what he pleases with his own\r\nin Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he can only do right with his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he tries to do wrong, or what the community thinks is wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the community takes his own from him.\xe2\x80\x9d Before I could think of\r\nanything to say to this he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish you would explain to me\r\nwhy it was left to this man\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors to try and get him to sell his\r\nportion of the landscape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwho else was there? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nexpected to take up a collection among the summer-boarders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so unreasonable; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. Was\r\nthere no provision for such an exigency in your laws? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the state\r\nempowered to buy him off at the full value of his timber and his land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be rank paternalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt began to get dark, and I suggested that we had better be going back\r\nto the hotel. The talk seemed already to have taken us away from all\r\npleasure in the prospect; I said, as we found our way through the rich,\r\nbalsam-scented twilight of the woods, where one joy-haunted thrush was\r\nstill singing: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that in America the law is careful not to meddle\r\nwith a man\xe2\x80\x99s private affairs, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to legislate personal\r\nvirtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--\xe2\x80\x9csurely you have the institution of marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was really annoyed at this. I returned, sarcastically; \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am glad\r\nto say that there we can meet your expectation; we have marriage, not only\r\nconsecrated by the church, but established and defended by the state.\r\nWhat has that to do with the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you consider marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe citadel of morality, the\r\nfountain of all that is pure and good in your private life, the source of\r\nhome and the image of heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some marriages,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a touch of our national humor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat do not quite fill the bill, but that is certainly our ideal of\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you say that you have not legislated personal virtue in\r\nAmerica?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have laws, I believe, against theft and murder,\r\nand slander and incest, and perjury and drunkenness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it appears to me that you have legislated honesty, regard for human\r\nlife, regard for character, abhorrence of unnatural vice, good faith, and\r\nsobriety. I was told on the train coming up, by a gentleman who was\r\nshocked at the sight of a man beating his horse, that you even had laws\r\nagainst cruelty to animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I am happy to say that they are enforced to such a degree that a\r\nman cannot kill a cat cruelly without being punished for it.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nAltrurian did not follow up his advantage, and I resolved not to be\r\noutdone in magnanimity. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, I will own that you have the best of me on\r\nthose points. I must say you\xe2\x80\x99ve trapped me very neatly, too; I can enjoy a\r\nthing of that kind when it\xe2\x80\x99s well done, and I frankly knock under. But I\r\nhad in mind something altogether different when I spoke. I was thinking of\r\nthose idealists who want to bind us hand and foot and render us the slaves\r\nof a state where the most intimate relations of life shall be penetrated\r\nby legislation and the very hearthstone shall be a tablet of laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t marriage a rather intimate relation of life?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I understood that gentleman on the train to say that you had laws\r\nagainst cruelty to children, and societies established to see them\r\nenforced. You don\xe2\x80\x99t consider such laws an invasion of the home, do you, or\r\na violation of its immunities? I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\ndifference between your civilization and ours is only one of degree, after\r\nall, and that America and Altruria are really one at heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought his compliment a bit hyperbolical, but I saw that it was\r\nhonestly meant, and as we Americans are first of all patriots, and vain\r\nfor our country before we are vain for ourselves, I was not proof against\r\nthe flattery it conveyed to me civically if not personally.\r\n\r\nWe were now drawing near the hotel, and I felt a certain glow of pleasure\r\nin its gay effect on the pretty knoll where it stood. In its artless and\r\naccidental architecture it was not unlike one of our immense coastwise\r\nsteamboats. The twilight had thickened to dusk, and the edifice was\r\nbrilliantly lighted with electrics, story above story, which streamed into\r\nthe gloom around like the lights of saloon and state-room. The corner of\r\nwood making into the meadow hid the station; there was no other building\r\nin sight; the hotel seemed riding at anchor on the swell of a placid sea.\r\nI was going to call the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s attention to this fanciful resemblance\r\nwhen I remembered that he had not been in our country long enough to have\r\nseen a Fall River boat, and I made toward the house without wasting the\r\ncomparison upon him. But I treasured it up in my own mind, intending some\r\nday to make a literary use of it.\r\n\r\nThe guests were sitting in friendly groups about the piazzas or in rows\r\nagainst the walls, the ladies with their gossip and the gentlemen with\r\ntheir cigars. The night had fallen cool after a hot day, and they all had\r\nthe effect of having cast off care with the burden of the week that was\r\npast, and to be steeping themselves in the innocent and simple enjoyment\r\nof the hour. They were mostly middle-aged married folk, but some were old\r\nenough to have sons and daughters among the young people who went and came\r\nin a long, wandering promenade of the piazzas, or wove themselves through\r\nthe waltz past the open windows of the great parlor; the music seemed one\r\nwith the light that streamed far out on the lawn flanking the piazzas.\r\nEvery one was well-dressed and comfortable and at peace, and I felt that\r\nour hotel was in some sort a microcosm of the republic.\r\n\r\nWe involuntarily paused, and I heard the Altrurian murmur: \xe2\x80\x9cCharming,\r\ncharming! This is really delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, with a glow of pride. \xe2\x80\x9cOur hotel here is a\r\ntype of the summer hotel everywhere; it\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic in not having\r\nanything characteristic about it; and I rather like the notion of the\r\npeople in it being so much like the people in all the others that you\r\nwould feel yourself at home wherever you met such a company in such a\r\nhouse. All over the country, north and south, wherever you find a group of\r\nhills or a pleasant bit of water or a stretch of coast, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find some\r\nsuch refuge as this for our weary toilers. We began to discover some time\r\nago that it would not do to cut open the goose that laid our golden eggs,\r\neven if it looked like an eagle, and kept on perching on our banners just\r\nas if nothing had happened. We discovered that, if we continued to kill\r\nourselves with hard work, there would be no Americans pretty soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow delightfully you put it! How quaint! How\r\npicturesque! Excuse me, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help expressing my pleasure in it. Our\r\nown humor is so very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is your humor like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could hardly tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid; I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been much of a humorist\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain a cold doubt of something ironical in the man went through me, but I\r\nhad no means of verifying it, and so I simply remained silent, waiting for\r\nhim to prompt me if he wished to know anything further about our national\r\ntransformation from bees perpetually busy into butterflies occasionally\r\nidle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you had made that discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we\xe2\x80\x99re nothing if not practical, you know, and as soon as we made\r\nthat discovery we stopped killing ourselves and invented the summer\r\nresort. There are very few of our business or professional men now who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t take their four or five weeks\xe2\x80\x99 vacation. Their wives go off early in\r\nthe summer, and, if they go to some resort within three or four hours of\r\nthe city, the men leave town Saturday afternoon and run out, or come up,\r\nand spend Sunday with their families. For thirty-eight hours or so a hotel\r\nlike this is a nest of happy homes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is admirable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are truly a practical\r\npeople. The ladies come early in the summer, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sometimes in the beginning of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they come for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? Why, for rest!\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted, with some little temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you told me awhile ago that as soon as a husband could\r\nafford it he relieved his wife and daughters from all household work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what do the ladies wish to rest from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom care. It is not work alone that kills. They are not relieved from\r\nhousehold care even when they are relieved from household work. There is\r\nnothing so killing as household care. Besides, the sex seems to be born\r\ntired. To be sure, there are some observers of our life who contend that\r\nwith the advance of athletics among our ladies, with boating and bathing,\r\nand lawn-tennis and mountain-climbing and freedom from care, and these\r\nlong summers of repose, our women are likely to become as superior to the\r\nmen physically as they now are intellectually. It is all right. We should\r\nlike to see it happen. It would be part of the national joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, have you a national joke?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, of course! You\r\nhave so much humor. I wish you could give me some notion of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is rather damaging to any joke to explain it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyour only hope of getting at ours is to live into it. One feature of it is\r\nthe confusion of foreigners at the sight of our men\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to\r\nsubordinate themselves to our women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t find that very bewildering,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme a generous and manly trait of the American character. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say\r\nthat it is one of the points at which your civilization and our own touch.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the influence of women in your public affairs\r\nmust be of the greatest advantage to you; it has been so with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned and stared at him, but he remained insensible to my astonishment,\r\nperhaps because it was now too dark for him to see it. \xe2\x80\x9cOur women have no\r\ninfluence in public affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, quietly, after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t? Is it possible? But didn\xe2\x80\x99t I understand you to imply just\r\nnow that your women were better educated than your men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose that, taking all sorts and conditions among us, the women\r\nare as a rule better schooled, if not better educated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, apart from the schooling, they are not more cultivated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a sense you might say they were. They certainly go in for a lot of\r\nthings: art and music, and Browning and the drama, and foreign travel and\r\npsychology, and political economy and Heaven knows what all. They have\r\nmore leisure for it; they have all the leisure there is, in fact; our\r\nyoung men have to go into business. I suppose you may say our women are\r\nmore cultivated than our men; yes, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no questioning that.\r\nThey are the great readers among us. We poor devils of authors would be\r\nbadly off if it were not for our women. In fact, no author could make a\r\nreputation among us without them. American literature exists because\r\nAmerican women appreciate it and love it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely your men read books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them; not many, comparatively. You will often hear a complacent\r\nass of a husband and father say to an author: \xe2\x80\x98My wife and daughters know\r\nyour books, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t find time for anything but the papers nowadays. I\r\nskim them over at breakfast, or when I\xe2\x80\x99m going in to business on the\r\ntrain.\xe2\x80\x99 He isn\xe2\x80\x99t the least ashamed to say that he reads nothing but the\r\nnewspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think that it would be better for him to read books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the presence of four or five thousand journalists with drawn\r\nscalping-knives I should not like to say so. Besides, modesty forbids.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but, really,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think that the literature\r\nof a book is more carefully pondered than the literature of a daily\r\nnewspaper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose even the four or five thousand journalists with drawn\r\nscalping-knives would hardly deny that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it stands to reason, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that the habitual reader of\r\ncarefully pondered literature ought to be more thoughtful than the readers\r\nof literature which is not carefully pondered and which they merely skim\r\nover on their way to business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe we began by assuming the superior culture of our women, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe? You\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly find an American that isn\xe2\x80\x99t proud of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cif your women are generally better schooled\r\nthan your men, and more cultivated and more thoughtful, and are relieved\r\nof household work in such great measure, and even of domestic cares, why\r\nhave they no part in your public affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed, for I thought I had my friend at last. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the best of all\r\npossible reasons: they don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t they want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, out of all patience, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must let you ask the\r\nladies themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d and I turned and moved again toward the hotel, but the\r\nAltrurian gently detained me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The feast is set, the guests are met,\r\n    May\xe2\x80\x99st hear the merry din.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCome in and see the young people dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me a little more about the old people first.\r\nThis digression about the ladies has been very interesting, but I thought\r\nyou were going to speak of the men here. Who are they, or, rather, what\r\nare they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as I said before, they are all business men and professional men;\r\npeople who spend their lives in studies and counting-rooms and offices,\r\nand have come up here for a few weeks or a few days of well-earned repose.\r\nThey are of all kinds of occupations: they are lawyers and doctors, and\r\nclergymen and merchants, and brokers and bankers. There\xe2\x80\x99s hardly any\r\ncalling you Won\xe2\x80\x99t find represented among them. As I was thinking\r\njust now, our hotel is a sort of microcosm of the American republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am most fortunate in finding you here, where I can avail myself of your\r\nintelligence in making my observations of your life under such\r\nadvantageous circumstances. It seems to me that with your help I might\r\npenetrate the fact of American life, possess myself of the mystery of your\r\nnational joke, without stirring beyond the piazza of your hospitable\r\nhotel,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend. I doubted it, but one does not lightly put aside a\r\ncompliment like that to one\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence, and I said I should be very\r\nhappy to be of use to him. He thanked me, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen, to begin with,\r\nI understand that these gentlemen are here because they are all\r\noverworked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. You can have no conception of how hard our business men and\r\nour professional men work. I suppose there is nothing like it anywhere\r\nelse in the world. But, as I said before, we are beginning to find that we\r\ncannot burn the candle at both ends and have it last long. So we put one\r\nend out for a little while every summer. Still, there are frightful wrecks\r\nof men strewn all along the course of our prosperity, wrecks of mind and\r\nbody. Our insane asylums are full of madmen who have broken under the\r\ntremendous strain, and every country in Europe abounds in our dyspeptics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I was rather proud of this terrible fact; there is no doubt but we\r\nAmericans are proud of overworking ourselves; Heaven knows why.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cAwful! Shocking!\xe2\x80\x9d But I thought somehow he had\r\nnot really followed me very attentively in my celebration of our national\r\nviolation of the laws of life and its consequences. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your business men and professional men are beginning to realize\r\nthe folly and wickedness of overwork. Shall I find some of your other\r\nweary workers here, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other weary workers?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked in turn, for I imagined I had gone\r\nover pretty much the whole list.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mechanics and day laborers, your\r\niron-moulders and glass-blowers, your miners and farmers, your printers\r\nand mill-operatives, your trainmen and quarry-hands. Or do they prefer to\r\ngo to resorts of their own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to make sure of such innocence as prompted this inquiry of\r\nmy Altrurian friend. The doubt whether he could really be in earnest was\r\nsomething that I had already felt; and it was destined to beset me, as it\r\ndid now, again and again. My first thought was that, of course, he was\r\ntrying a bit of cheap irony on me, a mixture of the feeble sarcasm and\r\nfalse sentiment that makes us smile when we find it in the philippics of\r\nthe industrial agitators. For a moment I did not know but I had fallen\r\nvictim to a walking delegate on his vacation, who was employing his summer\r\nleisure in going about the country in the guise of a traveler from\r\nAltruria, and foisting himself upon people who would have had nothing to\r\ndo with him in his real character. But in another moment I perceived that\r\nthis was impossible. I could not suppose that the friend who had\r\nintroduced him to me would be capable of seconding so poor a joke, and,\r\nbesides, I could not imagine why a walking delegate should wish to address\r\nhis clumsy satire to me particularly. For the present, at least, there was\r\nnothing for it but to deal with this inquiry as if it were made in good\r\nfaith and in the pursuit of useful information. It struck me as grotesque;\r\nbut it would not have been decent to treat it as if it were so. I was\r\nobliged to regard it seriously, and so I decided to shirk it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat opens up rather a large field, which lies somewhat\r\noutside of the province of my own activities. You know, I am a writer of\r\nromantic fiction, and my time is so fully occupied in manipulating the\r\ndestinies of the good old-fashioned hero and heroine, and trying always to\r\nmake them end in a happy marriage, that I have hardly had a chance to look\r\nmuch into the lives of agriculturists or artisans; and, to tell you the\r\ntruth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they do with their leisure. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty certain,\r\nthough, you won\xe2\x80\x99t meet any of them in this hotel; they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it,\r\nand I fancy they would find themselves out of their element among our\r\nguests. We respect them thoroughly; every American does, and we know that\r\nthe prosperity of the country rests with them; we have a theory that they\r\nare politically sovereign, but we see very little of them, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nassociate with them. In fact, our cultivated people have so little\r\ninterest in them socially that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like to meet them, even in\r\nfiction; they prefer refined and polished ladies and gentlemen, whom they\r\ncan have some sympathy with; and I always go to the upper classes for my\r\ntypes. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do to suppose, though, that we are indifferent to the\r\nworking classes in their place. Their condition is being studied a good\r\ndeal just now, and there are several persons here who will be able to\r\nsatisfy your curiosity on the points you have made, I think. I will\r\nintroduce you to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian did not try to detain me this time. He said he should be\r\nvery glad indeed to meet my friends, and I led the way toward a little\r\ngroup at the corner of the piazza. They were men whom I particularly\r\nliked, for one reason or another; they were intelligent and open-minded,\r\nand they were thoroughly American. One was a banker; another was a\r\nminister; there was a lawyer, and there was a doctor; there was a\r\nprofessor of political economy in one of our colleges; and there was a\r\nretired manufacturer--I do not know what he used to manufacture: cotton or\r\niron, or something like that. They all rose politely as I came up with my\r\nAltrurian, and I fancied in them a sensation of expectancy created by the\r\nrumor of his eccentric behavior which must have spread through the hotel.\r\nBut they controlled this if they had it, and I could see, as the light\r\nfell upon his face from a spray of electrics on the nearest pillar, that\r\nsort of liking kindle in theirs which I had felt myself at first sight of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I wish to introduce my friend, Mr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d and then I\r\npresented them severally to him by name. We all sat down, and I explained:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Homos is from Altruria. He is visiting our country for the first\r\ntime, and is greatly interested in the working of our institutions. He has\r\nbeen asking me some rather hard questions about certain phases of our\r\ncivilization; and the fact is that I have launched him upon you because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite able to cope with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed civilly at this sally of mine, but the professor asked,\r\nwith a sarcasm that I thought I hardly merited, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat point in our polity\r\ncan be obscure to the author of \xe2\x80\x98Glove and Gauntlet\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Airs and\r\nGraces\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed again, not so civilly, I felt, and then the banker asked\r\nmy friend: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it long since you left Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a great while ago,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is really\r\nonly a few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came by way of England, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there is no direct line to America,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems rather odd,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured, with some patriotic grudge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the English have direct lines everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker instructed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tariff has killed our shipbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor. No one took\r\nup this firebrand, and the professor added: \xe2\x80\x9cYour name is Greek, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nMr. Homos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; we are of one of the early Hellenic families,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you think,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer, who, like most lawyers, was a lover\r\nof romance, and was well read in legendary lore especially, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is\r\nany reason for supposing that Altruria is identical with the fabled\r\nAtlantis\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do. We have no traditions of a submergence of the\r\ncontinent, and there are only the usual evidences of a glacial epoch which\r\nyou find everywhere to support such a theory. Besides, our civilization is\r\nstrictly Christian, and dates back to no earlier period than that of the\r\nfirst Christian commune after Christ. It is a matter of history with us\r\nthat one of these communists, when they were dispersed, brought the Gospel\r\nto our continent; he was cast away on our eastern coast on his way to\r\nBritain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we know that,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister intervened, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is perfectly\r\nastonishing that an island so large as Altruria should have been lost to\r\nthe knowledge of the rest of the world ever since the beginning of our\r\nera. You would hardly think that there was a space of the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s surface\r\na mile square which had not been traversed by a thousand keels since\r\nColumbus sailed westward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor suggested in his turn, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nMr. Homos would tell us something about his country, instead of asking us\r\nabout ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I coincided, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we should all find it a good deal easier. At\r\nleast I should; but I brought our friend up in the hope that the professor\r\nwould like nothing better than to train a battery of hard facts upon a\r\ndefenceless stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d Since the professor had given me that little stab,\r\nI was rather anxious to see how he would handle the desire for information\r\nin the Altrurian which I had found so prickly.\r\n\r\nThis turned the laugh on the professor, and he pretended to be as curious\r\nabout Altruria as the rest, and said he would rather hear of it. But the\r\nAltrurian said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will excuse me. Sometime I shall be glad to\r\ntalk of Altruria as long as you like; or, if you will come to us, I shall\r\nbe still happier to show you many things that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make you\r\nunderstand at a distance. But I am in America to learn, not to teach, and\r\nI hope you will have patience with my ignorance. I begin to be afraid that\r\nit is so great as to seem a little incredible. I have fancied in my friend\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, with a smile toward me, \xe2\x80\x9ca suspicion that I was not\r\nentirely single in some of the inquiries I have made, but that I had some\r\nulterior motive, some wish to censure or satirize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested, for it was not polite to admit a conjecture\r\nso accurate. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are so well satisfied with our condition that we have\r\nnothing but pity for the darkened mind of the foreigner, though we believe\r\nin it fully: we are used to the English tourist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friends laughed, and the Altrurian continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to hear\r\nit, for I feel myself at a peculiar disadvantage among you. I am not only\r\na foreigner, but I am so alien to you in all the traditions and habitudes\r\nthat I find it very difficult to get upon common ground with you. Of\r\ncourse, I know theoretically what you are, but to realize it practically\r\nis another thing. I had read so much about America and understood so\r\nlittle that I could not rest without coming to see for myself. Some of the\r\napparent contradictions were so colossal--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have everything on a large scale here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, breaking off\r\nthe ash of his cigar with the end of his little finger, \xe2\x80\x9cand we rather\r\npride ourselves on the size of our inconsistencies, even. I know something\r\nof the state of things in Altruria, and, to be frank with you, I will say\r\nthat it seems to me preposterous. I should say it was impossible, if it\r\nwere not an accomplished fact; but I always feel bound to recognize the\r\nthing done. You have hitched your wagon to a star, and you have made the\r\nstar go; there is never any trouble with wagons, but stars are not easily\r\nbroken to harness, and you have managed to get yours well in hand. As I\r\nsaid, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in you, but I respect you.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought this charming,\r\nmyself; perhaps because it stated my own mind about Altruria so exactly\r\nand in terms so just and generous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, in a murmur of satisfaction, at my ear,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor a bloated bond-holder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered back, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had said it. What an American way of\r\nputting it! Emerson would have liked it himself. After all, he was our\r\nprophet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have thought so from the way we kept stoning him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor, with a soft laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of our contradictions,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the banker, in the same tone of\r\ngentle bonhomie, \xe2\x80\x9chas given you and our friend pause just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian answered, after a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that it is a\r\ncontradiction, for as yet I have not ascertained the facts I was seeking.\r\nOur friend was telling me of the great change that had taken place\r\nin regard to work, and the increased leisure that your professional people\r\nare now allowing themselves; and I was asking him where your working-men\r\nspent their leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went over the list of those he had specified, and I hung my head in\r\nshame and pity; it really had such an effect of mawkish sentimentality.\r\nBut my friends received it in the best possible way. They did not laugh;\r\nthey heard him out, and then they quietly deferred to the banker, who made\r\nanswer for us all:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can be almost as brief as the historian of Iceland in his chapter\r\non snakes: those people have no leisure to spend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept when they go out on a strike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manufacturer, with a\r\ncertain grim humor of his own; I never heard anything more dramatic than\r\nthe account he once gave of the way he broke up a labor union. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nseen a good many of them at leisure then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor chimed in, \xe2\x80\x9cand in my younger days, when I necessarily\r\nhad a good deal of charity practice, I used to find them at leisure when\r\nthey were \xe2\x80\x98laid off.\xe2\x80\x99 It always struck me as such a pretty euphemism. It\r\nseemed to minify the harm of the thing so. It seemed to take all the\r\nhunger and cold and sickness out of the fact. To be simply \xe2\x80\x98laid off\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nso different from losing your work and having to face beggary or\r\nstarvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cnever put anything by. They are\r\nwasteful and improvident, almost to a man; and they learn nothing by\r\nexperience, though they know as well as we do that it is simply a question\r\nof demand and supply, and that the day of overproduction is sure to come,\r\nwhen their work must stop unless the men that give them work are willing\r\nto lose money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them lose it, sometimes, rather than shut down,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nmanufacturer remarked; \xe2\x80\x9close it hand over hand, to keep the men at work;\r\nand then as soon as the tide turned the men would strike for higher wages.\r\nYou have no idea of the ingratitude of those people.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this toward\r\nthe minister, as if he did not wish to be thought hard; and, in fact, he\r\nwas a very kindly man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the minister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is one of the most sinister features of\r\nthe situation. They seem really to regard their employers as their\r\nenemies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it will end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how it would end if I had my way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any labor unions, and there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any strikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, from that judicial mind which I\r\nalways liked in him, \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the strikes are concerned, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand that the abolition of the unions would affect the impersonal\r\nprocess of \xe2\x80\x98laying off.\xe2\x80\x99 The law of demand and supply I respect as much as\r\nany one--it\xe2\x80\x99s something like the constitution; but, all the same, I should\r\nobject extremely to have my income stopped by it every now and then. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nprobably not so wasteful as a working-man generally is; still, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlaid by enough to make it a matter of indifference to me whether my income\r\nwent on or not. Perhaps the professor has.\xe2\x80\x9d The professor did not say, and\r\nwe all took leave to laugh. The lawyer concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how those\r\nfellows stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t, all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cOr their wives and children\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. Some of them die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has become of the good old American\r\nfact that there is always work for those who are willing to work? I notice\r\nthat wherever five thousand men strike in the forenoon, there are five\r\nthousand men to take their places in the afternoon--and not men who are\r\nturning their hands to something new, but men who are used to doing the\r\nvery thing the strikers have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is one of the things that teach the futility of strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nprofessor made haste to interpose, as if he had not quite liked to appear\r\naverse to the interests of the workman; no one likes to do that. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\r\nwere anything at all to be hoped from them, it would be another matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the point, quite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-way, what is the point?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, with my humorous lightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cit was the question how the working\r\nclasses amused their elegant leisure. But it seems to be almost anything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all applauded the neat touch, but the Altrurian eagerly entreated:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; never mind that now. That is a matter of comparatively little\r\ninterest. I would so much rather know something about the status of the\r\nworking-man among you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean his political status? It\xe2\x80\x99s that of every other citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. I suppose that in America you have learned, as we have\r\nin Altruria, that equal political rights are only means to an end, and as\r\nan end have no value or reality. I meant the economic status of the\r\nworking-man, and his social status.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know why we were so long girding up our loins to meet this simple\r\nquestion. I myself could not have hopefully undertaken to answer it; but\r\nthe others were each in their way men of affairs, and practically\r\nacquainted with the facts, except perhaps the professor; but he had\r\ndevoted a great deal of thought to them, and ought to have been qualified\r\nto make some sort of response. But even he was silent; and I had a vague\r\nfeeling that they were all somehow reluctant to formulate their knowledge,\r\nas if it were uncomfortable or discreditable. The banker continued to\r\nsmoke quietly on for a moment; then he suddenly threw his cigar away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to free my mind of cant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a short laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I can\r\nafford it, and I propose to cast all sorts of American cant out of it in\r\nanswering your question. The economic status of the working-man among us\r\nis essentially the same as that of the working-man all over the civilized\r\nworld. You will find plenty of people here, especially about election\r\ntime, to tell you differently, but they will not be telling you the truth,\r\nthough a great many of them think they are. In fact, I suppose most\r\nAmericans honestly believe because we have a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and manhood suffrage, and so on, that our economic conditions\r\nare peculiar, and that our working-man has a status higher and better than\r\nthat of the working-man anywhere else. But he has nothing of the kind. His\r\ncircumstances are better, and provisionally his wages are higher, but it\r\nis only a question of years or decades when his circumstances will be the\r\nsame and his wages the same as the European working-man\xe2\x80\x99s. There is\r\nnothing in our conditions to prevent this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understood from our friend here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, nodding\r\ntoward me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had broken only with the political tradition of\r\nEurope in your Revolution; and he has explained to me that you do not hold\r\nall kinds of labor in equal esteem; but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of labor did he say we did hold in esteem?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the banker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I understood him to say that if America meant anything at all it\r\nmeant the honor of work, but that you distinguished and did not honor some\r\nkinds of work so much as others; for instance, domestic service, or\r\npersonal attendance of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he drew the line there, did he? Well, we\r\nall have to draw the line somewhere. Our friend is a novelist, and I will\r\ntell you in strict confidence that the line he has drawn is imaginary. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t honor any kind of work any more than any other people. If a fellow\r\ngets up, the papers make a great ado over his having been a woodchopper or\r\na bobbin-boy, or something of that kind, but I doubt if the fellow himself\r\nlikes it; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t if he\xe2\x80\x99s got any sense. The rest of us feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_infra dig._, and hope nobody will find out that we ever worked with our\r\nhands for a living. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go further,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, with the effect of\r\nwhistling prudence down the wind, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will challenge any of you to\r\ngainsay me from his own experience or observation. How does esteem usually\r\nexpress itself? When we wish, to honor a man, what do we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. We offer him some sort of social recognition. Well, as soon as a\r\nfellow gets up, if he gets up high enough, we offer him some sort of\r\nsocial recognition; in fact, all sorts; but upon condition that he has\r\nleft off working with his hands for a living. We forgive all you please to\r\nhis past on account of the present. But there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a working-man, I\r\nventure to say, in any city or town, or even large village, in the whole\r\nlength and breadth of the United States who has any social recognition, if\r\nhe is still working at his trade. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean, merely, that he is\r\nexcluded from rich and fashionable society, but from the society of the\r\naverage educated and cultivated people. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying he is fit for it;\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how intelligent and agreeable he might be--and some of\r\nthem are astonishingly intelligent, and so agreeable in their tone of mind\r\nand their original way of looking at things that I like nothing better\r\nthan to talk with them--all of our invisible fences are up against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe minister said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if that sort of exclusiveness is quite\r\nnatural? Children seem to feel no sort of social difference among\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can hardly go to children for a type of social order,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister meekly admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut somehow there is a protest in\r\nus somewhere against these arbitrary distinctions--something that\r\nquestions whether they are altogether right. We know that they must be,\r\nand always have been, and always will be, and yet--well, I will confess\r\nit--I never feel at peace when I face them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cif you come to the question of right and wrong,\r\nthat is another matter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s right. I\xe2\x80\x99m not discussing that\r\nquestion; though I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not proposing to level the fences; I should\r\nbe the last to take my own down. I say simply that you are no more likely\r\nto meet a working-man in American society than you are to meet a colored\r\nman. Now you can judge,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended, turning directly to the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nmuch we honor labor. And I hope I have indirectly satisfied your curiosity\r\nas to the social status of the working-man among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were all silent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the others were occupied like myself in trying to recall some\r\ninstance of a working-man whom they had met in society, and perhaps we\r\nsaid nothing because we all failed.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian spoke at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been so very full and explicit that I feel as if it were almost\r\nunseemly to press any further inquiry; but I should very much like to know\r\nhow your working-men bear this social exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cA man does not care much to\r\nget into society until he has something to eat, and how to get that is\r\nalways the first question with the working-man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it myself. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t complain of not\r\nbeing asked to people\xe2\x80\x99s houses, and the working-men don\xe2\x80\x99t; you can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat; but I should feel it an incalculable loss. We may laugh at the\r\nemptiness of society, or pretend to be sick of it, but there is no doubt\r\nthat society is the flower of civilization, and to be shut out from it is\r\nto be denied the best privilege of a civilized man. There are society\r\nwomen--we have all met them--whose graciousness and refinement of presence\r\nare something of incomparable value; it is more than a liberal education\r\nto have been admitted to it, but it is as inaccessible to the working-man\r\nas--what shall I say? The thing is too grotesquely impossible for any sort\r\nof comparison. Merely to conceive of its possibility is something that\r\npasses a joke; it is a kind of offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain we were silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker continued, \xe2\x80\x9chow the notion of our social\r\nequality originated, but I think it has been fostered mainly by the\r\nexpectation of foreigners, who argued it from our political equality.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it never existed, except in our poorest and most\r\nprimitive communities, in the pioneer days of the West and among the\r\ngold-hunters of California. It was not dreamed of in our colonial society,\r\neither in Virginia or Pennsylvania or New York or Massachusetts; and the\r\nfathers of the republic, who were mostly slave-holders, were practically\r\nas stiff-necked aristocrats as any people of their day. We have not a\r\npolitical aristocracy, that is all; but there is as absolute a division\r\nbetween the orders of men and as little love, in this country as in any\r\ncountry on the globe. The severance of the man who works for his living\r\nwith his hands from the man who does not work for his living with his\r\nhands is so complete, and apparently so final, that nobody even imagines\r\nanything else, not even in fiction. Or, how is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you fellows still put the intelligent, high-spirited, handsome\r\nyoung artisan, who wins the millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, into your books? I\r\nused sometimes to find him there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might still find him in the fiction of the weekly story-papers; but,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I was obliged to own, \xe2\x80\x9che would not go down with my readers. Even in the\r\nstory-paper fiction he would leave off working as soon as he married the\r\nmillionaire\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and go to Europe, or he would stay here and become\r\na social leader, but he would not receive working-men in his gilded\r\nhalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others rewarded my humor with a smile, but the banker said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\r\nwonder you were not ashamed of filling our friend up with that stuff about\r\nour honoring some kinds of labor. It is true that we don\xe2\x80\x99t go about openly\r\nand explicitly despising any kind of honest toil--people don\xe2\x80\x99t do that\r\nanywhere now; but we contemn it in terms quite as unmistakable. The\r\nworking-man acquiesces as completely as anybody else. He does not remain a\r\nworking-man a moment longer that he can help; and after he gets up, if he\r\nis weak enough to be proud of having been one, it is because he feels that\r\nhis low origin is a proof of his prowess in rising to the top against\r\nunusual odds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there is a man in the whole civilized\r\nworld--outside of Altruria, of course---who is proud of working at a\r\ntrade, except the shoemaker Tolstoy, and is a count, and he does not make\r\nvery good shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed again: those shoes of Count Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s are always such an\r\ninfallible joke.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian, however, was cocked and primed with another question; he\r\ninstantly exploded it: \xe2\x80\x9cBut are all the working-men in America eager to\r\nrise above their condition? Is there none willing to remain among the mass\r\nbecause the rest could not rise with him, and from the hope of yet\r\nbringing labor to honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of any. No, the American ideal is not\r\nto change the conditions for all, but for each to rise above the rest if\r\nhe can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it is really so bad as that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the minister, timidly.\r\n\r\nThe banker answered: \xe2\x80\x9cBad? Do you call that bad? I thought it was very\r\ngood. But, good or bad, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it deniable, if you\r\nlook into the facts. There may be working-men willing to remain so for\r\nother working-men\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but I have never met any--perhaps because the\r\nworking-man never goes into society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfailing question of the Altrurian broke the silence which ensued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there many of your working-men who are intelligent and agreeable--of\r\nthe type you mentioned a moment since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better refer you to one of our friends\r\nhere, who has had a great deal more to do with them than I have. He is a\r\nmanufacturer, and he has had to do with all kinds of work-people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for my sins,\xe2\x80\x9d the manufacturer assented; and he added: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\noften confoundedly intelligent, though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t often found them very\r\nagreeable, either in their tone of mind or their original way of looking\r\nat things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker amiably acknowledged his thrust, and the Altrurian asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nthey are opposed to your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we have the same trouble here that you must have heard of in\r\nEngland. As you know now that the conditions are the same here, you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe surprised at the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian pursued--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you expect them always to\r\ncontinue the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manufacturer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t expect them to\r\nchange of themselves, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to change them. It was\r\nexpected that the rise of the trusts and the syndicates would break the\r\nunions, but somehow they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. The situation remains the same. The\r\nunions are not cutting one another\xe2\x80\x99s throats now any more than we are. The\r\nwar is on a larger scale--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I clearly understand the\r\nsituation as regards the working-man in America. He is dependent upon the\r\nemployer for his chance to earn a living, and he is never sure of this. He\r\nmay be thrown out of work by his employer\xe2\x80\x99s disfavor or disaster, and his\r\nwillingness to work goes for nothing; there is no public provision of work\r\nfor him; there is nothing to keep him from want nor the prospect of\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all in the same boat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut some of us have provisioned ourselves rather better and can generally\r\nweather it through till we are picked up,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am always saying the working-man is improvident,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the charities,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut his economical status,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis in a state of\r\nperpetual uncertainty, and to save himself in some measure he has\r\norganized, and so has constituted himself a danger to the public peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very great danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess we can manage him,\xe2\x80\x9d the manufacturer remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd socially he is non-existent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian turned with this question to the banker, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\ncertainly not in society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guest, \xe2\x80\x9cif the working-man\xe2\x80\x99s wages are provisionally so\r\nmuch better here than in Europe, why should they be discontented? What is\r\nthe real cause of their discontent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have always been suspicious, in the company of practical men, of an\r\natmosphere of condescension to men of my calling, if nothing worse. I\r\nfancy they commonly regard artists of all kinds as a sort of harmless\r\neccentrics, and that literary people they look upon as something droll, as\r\nweak and soft, as not quite right. I believed that this particular group,\r\nindeed, was rather abler to conceive of me as a rational person than most\r\nothers, but I knew that if even they had expected me to be as reasonable\r\nas themselves they would not have been greatly disappointed if I were not;\r\nand it seemed to me that I had put myself wrong with them in imparting to\r\nthe Altrurian that romantic impression that we hold labor in honor here. I\r\nhad really thought so, but I could not say so now, and I wished to\r\nretrieve myself somehow. I wished to show that I was a practical man, too,\r\nand so I made answer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the cause of the working-man\xe2\x80\x99s discontent?\r\nIt is very simple: the walking delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI suppose I could not have fairly claimed any great originality for my\r\nnotion that the walking delegate was the cause of the labor troubles: he\r\nis regularly assigned as the reason of a strike in the newspapers, and is\r\nreprobated for his evil agency by the editors, who do not fail to read the\r\nworking-men many solemn lessons and fervently warn them against him, as\r\nsoon as the strike begins to go wrong--as it nearly always does. I\r\nunderstand from them that the walking delegate is an irresponsible tyrant,\r\nwho emerges from the mystery that habitually hides him and from time to\r\ntime orders a strike in mere rancor of spirit and plenitude of power, and\r\nthen leaves the working-men and their families to suffer the consequences,\r\nwhile he goes off somewhere and rolls in the lap of luxury, careless of\r\nthe misery he has created. Between his debauches of vicious idleness and\r\nhis accesses of baleful activity he is employed in poisoning the mind of\r\nthe working-men against his real interests and real friends. This is\r\nperfectly easy, because the American working-man, though singularly shrewd\r\nand sensible in other respects, is the victim of an unaccountable\r\nobliquity of vision which keeps him from seeing his real interests and\r\nreal friends--or, at least, from knowing them when he sees them.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt, I thought, in the mind of any reasonable person\r\nthat the walking delegate was the source of the discontent among our\r\nproletariate, and I alleged him with a confidence which met the approval\r\nof the professor, apparently, for he nodded, as if to say that I had hit\r\nthe nail on the head this time; and the minister seemed to be freshly\r\nimpressed with a notion that could not be new to him. The lawyer and the\r\ndoctor were silent, as if waiting for the banker to speak again; but he\r\nwas silent, too. The manufacturer, to my chagrin, broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sardonic levity which surprised me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nto go a good deal deeper than the walking delegate. He\xe2\x80\x99s a symptom; he\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t the disease. The thing keeps on and on, and it seems to be always\r\nabout wages; but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t about wages at the bottom. Some of those fellows\r\nknow it and some of them don\xe2\x80\x99t, but the real discontent is with the whole\r\nsystem, with the nature of things. I had a curious revelation on that\r\npoint the last time I tried to deal with my men as a union. They were\r\nalways bothering me about this and about that, and there was no end to the\r\nbickering. I yielded point after point, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference.\r\nIt seemed as if the more I gave the more they asked. At last I made up my\r\nmind to try to get at the real inwardness of the matter, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait\r\nfor their committee to come to me--I sent for their leading man, and said\r\nI wanted to have it out with him. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad fellow, and when I got\r\nat him, man to man that way, I found he had sense, and he had ideas--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno use pretending those fellows are fools; he had thought about his side\r\nof the question, anyway. I said: \xe2\x80\x98Now what does it all mean? Do you want\r\nthe earth, or don\xe2\x80\x99t you? When is it going to end?\xe2\x80\x99 I offered him something\r\nto take, but he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t drink, and we compromised on cigars. \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nwhen is it going to end?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, and I pressed it home, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nhim fight off from the point. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean when is it all going to end?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98all. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it. If there\xe2\x80\x99s any way out I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to know it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, if you want to know.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all going to end when you get the same amount of money for the same\r\namount of work as we do.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed uproariously. The thing was deliciously comical; and\r\nnothing, I thought, attested the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s want of humor like his\r\nfailure to appreciate this joke. He did not even smile in asking: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the manufacturer, with cosey enjoyment, \xe2\x80\x9cI asked him if\r\nthe men would take the concern and run it themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d We laughed again;\r\nthis seemed even better than the other joke. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he said, \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99; they\r\nwould not like to do that. And then I asked him just what they would like,\r\nif they could have their own way, and he said they would like to have me\r\nrun the business, and all share alike. I asked him what was the sense of\r\nthat, and why, if I could do something that all of them put together\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paid more than all of them put together; and\r\nhe said that if a man did his best he ought to be paid as much as the best\r\nman. I asked him if that was the principle their union was founded on, and\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 that the very meaning of their union was the protection of\r\nthe weak by the strong and the equalization of earnings among all who do\r\ntheir best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe waited for the manufacturer to go on, but he made a dramatic pause at\r\nthis point, as if to let it sink into our minds; and he did not speak\r\nuntil the Altrurian prompted him with the question, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you\r\nfinally do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw there was only one way out for me, and I told the fellow I did not\r\nthink I could do business on that principle. We parted friends, but the\r\nnext Saturday I locked them out and smashed their union. They came back,\r\nmost of them--they had to--but I\xe2\x80\x99ve treated with them ever since \xe2\x80\x98as\r\nindividuals.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99re much better off in your hands than they were in the union,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manufacturer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe laughed with him, all but the minister, whose mind seemed to have\r\ncaught upon some other point, and who sat absently by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it your opinion, from what you know of the working-man generally,\r\nthat they all have this twist in their heads?\xe2\x80\x9d the professor asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have, until they begin to rise. Then they get rid of it mighty soon.\r\nLet a man save something--enough to get a house of his own, and take a\r\nboarder or two, and perhaps have a little money at interest--and he sees\r\nthe matter in another light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he sees it more clearly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sees it differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d the minister pursued, turning to the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nused to dealing with questions of justice--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather more with questions of law, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d the other returned,\r\npleasantly, putting his feet together before him and looking down at them\r\nin a way he had. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, still, I have a great interest in questions of\r\njustice, and I confess that I find a certain wild equity in this\r\nprinciple, which I see nobody could do business on. It strikes me as\r\nidyllic--it\xe2\x80\x99s a touch of real poetry in the rough-and-tumble prose of our\r\neconomic life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe referred this to me as something I might appreciate in my quality of\r\nliterary man, and I responded in my quality of practical man: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertainly more rhyme than reason in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned again to the minister:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the ideal of the Christian state is the family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minister, with the gratitude that I have seen people\r\nof his cloth show when men of the world conceded premises which the world\r\nusually contests; it has seemed to me pathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if that is the case, why, the logic of the postulate is that the\r\nprosperity of the weakest is the sacred charge and highest happiness of\r\nall the stronger. But the law has not recognized any such principle, in\r\neconomics at least, and if the labor unions are based upon it they are\r\noutlaw, so far as any hope of enforcing it is concerned; and it is bad for\r\nmen to feel themselves outlaw. How is it,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer continued, turning\r\nto the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cin your country? We can see no issue here, if the first\r\nprinciple of organized labor antagonizes the first principle of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand precisely yet what the first principle of business\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that raises another interesting question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse, every business man solves the problem practically according to his\r\ntemperament and education, and I suppose that on first thoughts every\r\nbusiness man would answer you accordingly. But perhaps the personal\r\nequation is something you wish to eliminate from the definition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I would rather not venture upon it first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfessor, what should you say was the first principle of business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor\r\npromptly answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will pass the parson and the doctor and the novelist as witnesses of\r\nno value. They can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have any cognizance of the first principle\r\nof business; their affair is to look after the souls and bodies and\r\nfancies of other people. But what should you say it was?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the\r\nbanker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say it was an enlightened conception of one\xe2\x80\x99s own interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer had no hesitation in answering: \xe2\x80\x9cThe good of Number One,\r\nfirst, last, and all the time. There may be a difference of opinion about\r\nthe best way to get at it; the long way may be the better, or the short\r\nway; the direct way or the oblique way, or the purely selfish way, or the\r\npartly selfish way; but if you ever lose sight of that end you might as\r\nwell shut up shop. That seems to be the first law of nature, as well as\r\nthe first law of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go to nature for our morality,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were not talking of morality,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manufacturer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe were talking\r\nof business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brought the laugh on the minister, but the lawyer cut it short:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really see why the trades-unions are not as\r\nbusiness-like as the syndicates in their dealings with all those outside\r\nof themselves. Within themselves they practise an altruism of the highest\r\norder, but it is a tribal altruism; it is like that which prompts a Sioux\r\nto share his last mouthful with a starving Sioux, and to take the scalp of\r\na starving Apache. How is it with your trades-unions in Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no trades-unions in Altruria,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy Altruria!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had them formerly,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian went on, \xe2\x80\x9cas you have them now. They\r\nclaimed, as I suppose yours do, that they were forced into existence by\r\nthe necessities of the case; that without union the working-man was unable\r\nto meet the capitalist on anything like equal terms, or to withstand his\r\nencroachments and oppressions. But to maintain themselves they had to\r\nextinguish industrial liberty among the working-men themselves, and they\r\nhad to practise great cruelties against those who refused to join them or\r\nwho rebelled against them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey simply destroy them here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, from his judicial mind, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great syndicates\r\nhave no scruples in destroying a capitalist who won\xe2\x80\x99t come into them or\r\nwho tries to go out. They don\xe2\x80\x99t club him or stone him, but they under-sell\r\nhim and freeze him out; they don\xe2\x80\x99t break his head, but they bankrupt him.\r\nThe principle is the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt Mr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very curious to\r\nknow just how they got rid of labor unions in Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had syndicates, too, and finally we had the _reductio ad absurdum_--we\r\nhad a federation of labor unions find a federation of syndicates, that\r\ndivided the nation into two camps. The situation was not only impossible,\r\nbut it was insupportably ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ventured to say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt hasn\xe2\x80\x99t become quite so much of a joke with us yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it in a fair way to become so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor; and he turned to\r\nthe lawyer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should you say was the logic of events among us for the\r\nlast ten or twenty years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing so capricious as the logic of events. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreasoning--you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what it\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at, or where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to fetch\r\nup; all that you can do is to keep out of the way if possible. We may come\r\nto some such condition of things as they have in Altruria, where the faith\r\nof the whole nation is pledged to secure every citizen in the pursuit of\r\nhappiness; or we may revert to some former condition, and the master may\r\nagain own the man; or we may hitch and joggle along indefinitely, as we\r\nare doing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, while he laid a caressing touch on the\r\nAltrurian\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say honestly that everybody works\r\nwith his hands in Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly. We are mindful, as a whole people, of the divine law--\xe2\x80\x98In\r\nthe sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the capitalists? I\xe2\x80\x99m anxious about Number One, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot, of course. But the lawyers, the doctors, the parsons, the\r\nnovelists?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all do their share of hand-work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat seems to dispose of the question of the working-man\r\nin society. But how about your minds? When do you cultivate your minds?\r\nWhen do the ladies of Altruria cultivate their minds, if they have to do\r\ntheir own work, as I suppose they do? Or is it only the men who work, if\r\nthey happen to be the husbands and fathers of the upper classes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian seemed to be sensible of the kindly scepticism which\r\npersisted in our reception of his statements, after all we had read of\r\nAltruria. He smiled indulgently, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that work\r\nin Altruria is the same as it is here. As we all work, the amount that\r\neach one need do is very little, a few hours each day at the most, so that\r\nevery man and woman has abundant leisure and perfect spirits for the\r\nhigher pleasures which the education of their whole youth has fitted them\r\nto enjoy. If you can understand a state of things where the sciences and\r\narts and letters are cultivated for their own sake, and not as a means of\r\nlivelihood--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive of that. We\r\nconsider the pinch of poverty the highest incentive that a man can have.\r\nIf our gifted friend here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating me, \xe2\x80\x9cwere not kept like a\r\ntoad under the harrow, with his nose on the grindstone, and the poorhouse\r\nstaring him in the face--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t mix your metaphors so, anyway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not for that and all the other hardships that literary men\r\nundergo--\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98Toil, envy, want, the patron and the jail\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\nhis novels probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, as if he did not quite follow this joking; and,\r\nto tell the truth, I never find the personal thing in very good taste.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand, then, how extremely difficult it is for me to\r\nimagine a condition of things like yours--although I have it under my very\r\neyes--where the money consideration is the first consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the minister; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s quite the\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, sweetly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can see how easily\r\nI go astray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are so far out in\r\nwhat you say. If you had said that money was always the first motive, I\r\nshould have been inclined to dispute you, too; but when you say that money\r\nis the first consideration, I think you are quite right. Unless a man\r\nsecures his financial basis for his work, he can\xe2\x80\x99t do his work. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnonsense to pretend otherwise. So the money consideration is the first\r\nconsideration. People here have to live by their work, and to live they\r\nmust have money. Of course, we all recognize a difference in the\r\nqualities, as well as in the kinds, of work. The work of the laborer may\r\nbe roughly defined as the necessity of his life; the work of the business\r\nman as the means, and the work of the artist and scientist as the end.\r\nWe might refine upon these definitions and make them closer, but they\r\nwill serve for illustration as they are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there can be\r\nany question as to which is the highest kind of work; some truths are\r\nself-evident. He is a fortunate man whose work is an end, and every\r\nbusiness man sees this, and owns it to himself, at least when he meets\r\nsome man of an aesthetic or scientific occupation. He knows that this\r\nluckier fellow has a joy in his work which he can never feel in business;\r\nthat his success in it can never be embittered by the thought that it is\r\nthe failure of another; that if he does it well, it is pure good; that\r\nthere cannot be any competition in it--there can be only a noble\r\nemulation, as far as the work itself is concerned. He can always look up\r\nto his work, for it is something above him; and a business man often has\r\nto look down upon his business, for it is often beneath him, unless he is\r\na pretty low fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI listened to all this in surprise; I knew that the banker was a\r\ncultivated man, a man of university training, and that he was a reader and\r\na thinker; but he had always kept a certain reserve in his talk, which he\r\nnow seemed to have thrown aside for the sake of the Altrurian, or because\r\nthe subject had a charm that lured him out of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question is of the money consideration, which is the first\r\nconsideration with us all: does it, or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it degrade the work, which\r\nis the life, of those among us whose work is the highest? I understand\r\nthat this is the misgiving which troubles you in view of our conditions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian assented, and I thought it a proof of the banker\xe2\x80\x99s innate\r\ndelicacy that he did not refer the matter, so far as it concerned the\r\naesthetic life and work, to me; I was afraid he was going to do so. But he\r\ncourteously proposed to keep the question impersonal, and he went on to\r\nconsider it himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose any one can satisfy you fully.\r\nBut I should say that it put such men under a double strain, and perhaps\r\nthat is the reason why so many of them break down in a calling that is\r\ncertainly far less exhausting than business. On one side, the artist is\r\nkept to the level of the working-man, of the animal, of the creature whose\r\nsole affair is to get something to eat and somewhere to sleep. This is\r\nthrough his necessity. On the other side, he is exalted to the height of\r\nbeings who have no concern but with the excellence of their work, which\r\nthey were born and divinely authorized to do. This is through his purpose.\r\nBetween the two, I should say that he got mixed, and that his work shows\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone of the others said anything, and, since I had not been personally\r\nappealed to, I felt the freer to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will suppose me to be\r\nspeaking from observation rather than experience--\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cgo on;\xe2\x80\x9d and the rest made haste in\r\nvarious forms to yield me the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say that such a man certainly got mixed, but that his work kept\r\nitself pure from the money consideration, as it were, in spite of him. A\r\npainter or actor, or even a novelist, is glad to get all he can for his\r\nwork, and, such is our fallen nature, he does get all he knows how to get:\r\nbut, when he has once fairly passed into his work, he loses himself in it.\r\nHe does not think whether it will pay or not, whether it will be popular\r\nor not, but whether he can make it good or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is conceivable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he rather do\r\nsomething he would get less for, if he could afford it, than the thing he\r\nknows he will get more for? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the money consideration influence his\r\nchoice of subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOddly enough, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it does,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflection. \xe2\x80\x9cA man makes his choice once for all when he embraces the\r\naesthetic life, or, rather, it is made for him; no other life seems\r\npossible. I know there is a general belief that an artist does the kind of\r\nthing he has made go because it pays; but this only shows the prevalence\r\nof business ideals. If he did not love to do the thing he does, he could\r\nnot do it well, no matter how richly it paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, and he added to the Altrurian:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you see, we are not so bad as one would think. We are illogically\r\nbetter, in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the other assented. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew something of your literature as well as\r\nyour conditions before I left home, and I perceived that by some anomaly\r\nthe one was not tainted by the other. It is a miraculous proof of the\r\ndivine mission of the poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the popular novelist,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer whispered in my ear, but loud\r\nenough for the rest to hear, and they all testified their amusement at my\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian, with his weak sense of humor, passed the joke. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows no\r\nsigns of corruption from greed, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking that, fine as it\r\nis, it might have been much finer if the authors who produced it had been\r\nabsolutely freed to their work, and had never felt the spur of need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they absolutely freed to it in Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the professor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstood you that everybody had to work for his living in Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a mistake. Nobody works for his living in Altruria; he works for\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x99 living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is precisely what our working-men object to doing here,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe manufacturer. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that last interview of mine with the walking\r\ndelegate he had the impudence to ask me why my men should work for my\r\nliving as well as their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that you were giving them the work to do--the very\r\nmeans of life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing those fellows want to think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthey might not have found it such a\r\nhardship to work for your living if their own had been assured, as it is\r\nwith us. If you will excuse my saying it, we should think it monstrous in\r\nAltruria for any man to have another\xe2\x80\x99s means of life in his power; and in\r\nour condition it is hardly imaginable. Do you really have it in your power\r\nto take away a man\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to earn a living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer laughed uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in my power to take away his\r\nlife; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t habitually shoot my fellow-men, and I never dismissed a\r\nman yet without good reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of accusing\r\nyou of such inhumanity. But, you see, our whole system is so very\r\ndifferent that, as I said, it is hard for me to conceive of yours, and I\r\nam very curious to understand its workings. If you shot your fellow-man,\r\nas you say, the law would punish you; but if, for some reason that you\r\ndecided to be good, you took away his means of living, and he actually\r\nstarved to death--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the law would have nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor replied for\r\nthe manufacturer, who did not seem ready to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not the\r\nway things fall out. The man would be supported in idleness, probably,\r\ntill he got another job, by his union, which would take the matter up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought that our friend did not employ union labor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nAltrurian.\r\n\r\nI found all this very uncomfortable, and tried to turn the talk back to a\r\npoint that I felt curious about: \xe2\x80\x9cBut in Altruria, if the literary class\r\nis not exempt from the rule of manual labor, where do they find time and\r\nstrength to write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must realize that our manual labor is never engrossing or\r\nexhausting. It is no more than is necessary to keep the body in health. I\r\ndo not see how you remain well here, you people of sedentary occupations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we all take some sort of exercise. We walk several hours a day, or we\r\nrow, or we ride a bicycle, or a horse, or we fence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to us,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Altrurian, with a growing frankness which\r\nnothing but the sweetness of his manner would have excused, \xe2\x80\x9cexercise for\r\nexercise would appear stupid. The barren expenditure of force that began\r\nand ended in itself, and produced nothing, we should--if you will excuse\r\nmy saying so--look upon as childish, if not insane or immoral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAt this moment the lady who had hailed me so gayly from the top of the\r\ncoach while I stood waiting for the Altrurian to help the porter with the\r\nbaggage, just after the arrival of the train, came up with her husband to\r\nour little group and said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to introduce my husband to you.\r\nHe adores your books.\xe2\x80\x9d She went on much longer to this effect, while the\r\nother men grinned round and her husband tried to look as if it were all\r\ntrue, and her eyes wandered to the Altrurian, who listened gravely. I knew\r\nperfectly well that she was using her husband\xe2\x80\x99s zeal for my fiction to\r\nmake me present my friend; but I did not mind that, and I introduced him\r\nto both of them. She took possession of him at once and began walking him\r\noff down the piazza, while her husband remained with me, and the members\r\nof our late conference drifted apart. I was not sorry to have it broken up\r\nfor the present; it seemed to me that it had lasted quite long enough, and\r\nI lighted a cigar with the husband, and we strolled together in the\r\ndirection his wife had taken.\r\n\r\nHe began, apparently in compliment to literature in my person: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\r\nlike to have a book where I can get at it when we\xe2\x80\x99re not going out to the\r\ntheatre, and I want to quiet my mind down after business. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nmuch what the book is; my wife reads to me till I drop off, and then she\r\nfinishes the book herself and tells me the rest of the story. You see,\r\nbusiness takes it out of you so! Well, I let my wife do most of the\r\nreading, anyway. She knows pretty much everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going in that\r\nline. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any children, and it occupies her mind. She\xe2\x80\x99s up to\r\nall sorts of things--she\xe2\x80\x99s artistic, and she\xe2\x80\x99s musical, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndramatic, and she\xe2\x80\x99s literary. Well, I like to have her. Women are funny,\r\nanyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a good-looking, good-natured, average American of the money-making\r\ntype; I believe he was some sort of a broker, but I do not quite know what\r\nhis business was. As we walked up and down the piazza, keeping a discreet\r\nlittle distance from the corner where his wife had run off to with her\r\ncapture, he said he wished he could get more time with her in the\r\nsummer--but he supposed I knew what business was. He was glad she could\r\nhave the rest, anyway; she needed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-way,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is this friend of yours? The women are all\r\ncrazy about him, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been an even thing between my wife and Miss\r\nGroundsel which would fetch him first. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet on my wife every time,\r\nwhen it comes to a thing like that. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good-looking fellow--some kind\r\nof foreigner, I believe; pretty eccentric, too, I guess. Where is\r\nAltruria, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Well, if we are going to restrict\r\nimmigration, I suppose we sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t see many more Altrurians, and we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter make the most of this one. Heigh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know why this innocent pleasantry piqued me to say: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nunderstand the Altrurians, my dear fellow, nothing could induce them to\r\nemigrate to America. As far as I can make out, they would regard it very\r\nmuch as we should regard settling among the Eskimos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my new acquaintance, with perfect good temper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve explicit authority for my\r\nstatement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are worse than the English used to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat there were any foreigners who looked at us in that light now. I\r\nthought the war settled all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a good many things that the war didn\xe2\x80\x99t settle so\r\ndefinitely as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to thinking, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. But, for that\r\nmatter, I fancy an Altrurian would regard the English as a little lower in\r\nthe scale of savagery than ourselves even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good on the English, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\ncompanion, and he laughed with an easy satisfaction that I envied him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d his wife called to him from where she was sitting with the\r\nAltrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would go for my shawl. I begin to feel the air a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me where,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he confided to me, \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nknows where her shawl is one-quarter of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I left it in the office somewhere. You might ask at the\r\ndesk; or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s in the rack by the dining-room door--or maybe up in\r\nour room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, with another glance at me, as if it were\r\nthe greatest fun in the world, and he started amiably off.\r\n\r\nI went and took a chair by the lady and the Altrurian, and she began at\r\nonce: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come! I have been trying to enlighten Mr.\r\nHomos about some of the little social peculiarities among us that he finds\r\nso hard to understand. He was just now,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwanting to\r\nknow why all the natives out here were not invited to go in and join our\r\nyoung people in the dance, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to tell him that we\r\nconsider it a great favor to let them come and take up so much of the\r\npiazza and look in at the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh of superiority, and twitched her pretty head in\r\nthe direction of the young country girls and country fellows who were\r\nthronging the place that night in rather unusual numbers. They were well\r\nenough looking, and, as it was Saturday night, they were in their best. I\r\nsuppose their dress could have been criticised; the young fellows were\r\nclothed by the ready-made clothing-store, and the young girls after their\r\nown devices from the fashion papers; but their general effect was good,\r\nand their behavior was irreproachable; they were very quiet--if anything,\r\ntoo quiet. They took up a part of the piazza that was yielded them by\r\ncommon usage, and sat watching the hop inside, not so much enviously, I\r\nthought, as wistfully; and for the first time it struck me as odd that\r\nthey should have no part in the gayety. I had often seen them there\r\nbefore, but I had never thought it strange they should be shut out. It had\r\nalways seemed quite normal, but now, suddenly, for one baleful moment, it\r\nseemed abnormal. I suppose it was the talk we had been having about the\r\nworking-men in society which caused me to see the thing as the Altrurian\r\nmust have seen it; but I was, nevertheless, vexed with him for having\r\nasked such a question, after he had been so fully instructed upon the\r\npoint. It was malicious of him, or it was stupid. I hardened my heart, and\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have told him, for one thing, that they were not\r\ndancing because they had not paid the piper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the money consideration enters even into your social pleasures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe evaded this question, as he evaded all straightforward questions\r\nconcerning his country: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no money consideration, you know. But do\r\nI understand that all your social entertainments are paid for by the\r\nguests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not so bad as that, quite. There are a great many that the host\r\npays for. Even here, in a hotel, the host furnishes the music and the room\r\nfree to the guests of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd none are admitted from the outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, people are welcome from all the other hotels and boarding-houses\r\nand the private cottages. The young men are especially welcome; there are\r\nnot enough young men in the hotel to go round, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, we could\r\nsee that some of the pretty girls within were dancing with other girls;\r\nhalf-grown boys were dangling from the waists of tall young ladies and\r\nwaltzing on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that rather droll?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and I felt ashamed of it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you to\r\ndo? The young men are hard at work in the cities, as many as can get work\r\nthere, and the rest are out West, growing up with the country. There are\r\ntwenty young girls for every young man at all the summer resorts in the\r\nEast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would happen if these young farmers--I suppose they are\r\nfarmers--were invited in to take part in the dance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Mrs. Makely, I think I shall have to give him back to you,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe lady laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I want him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian entreated, with unwonted perception of the humor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that I must be very trying with my questions; but do not abandon\r\nme to the solitude of my own conjectures. They are dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, with another laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will try to\r\ntell you what would happen if those farmers, or farm-hands, or whatever\r\nthey are, were asked in. The mammas would be very indignant, and the young\r\nladies would be scared, and nobody would know what to do, and the dance\r\nwould stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the young ladies prefer to dance with one another and with little\r\nboys--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they prefer to dance with young men of their own station; they would\r\nrather not dance at all than dance with people beneath them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything against these natives here; they are very civil and decent. But\r\nthey have not the same social traditions as the young ladies; they would\r\nbe out of place with them, and they would feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can see that they are not fit to associate with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAltrurian, with a gleam of commonsense that surprised me, \xe2\x80\x9cand that as\r\nlong as your present conditions endure they never can be. You must excuse\r\nthe confusion which the difference between your political ideals and your\r\neconomic ideals constantly creates in me. I always think of you\r\npolitically first, and realize you as a perfect democracy; then come these\r\nother facts, in which I cannot perceive that you differ from the\r\naristocratic countries of Europe in theory, or practice. It is very\r\npuzzling. Am I right in supposing that the effect of your economy is to\r\nestablish insuperable inequalities among you, and to forbid the hope of\r\nthe brotherhood which your policy proclaims?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely looked at me as if she were helpless to grapple with his\r\nmeaning, and, for fear of worse, I thought best to evade it. I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe that anybody is troubled by those distinctions. We are used\r\nto them, and everybody acquiesces in them, which is a proof that they are\r\na very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely now came to my support. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Americans are very high-spirited,\r\nin every class, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe one of those nice farm-boys would like\r\nbeing asked in any better than the young ladies. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how\r\nproud some of them are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that they suffer from being excluded as inferiors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I assure you they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel themselves inferior! They consider\r\nthemselves as good as anybody. There are some very interesting characters\r\namong them. Now, there is a young girl sitting at the first window, with\r\nher profile outlined by the light, whom I feel it an honor to speak to.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s her brother, standing there with her--that tall, gaunt young man\r\nwith a Roman face; it\xe2\x80\x99s such a common type here in the mountains. Their\r\nfather was a soldier, and he distinguished himself so in one of the last\r\nbattles that he was promoted. He was badly wounded, but he never took a\r\npension; he just came back to his farm and worked on till he died. Now the\r\nson has the farm, and he and his sister live there with their mother. The\r\ndaughter takes in sewing, and in that way they manage to make both ends\r\nmeet. The girl is really a first-rate seamstress, and so cheap! I give her\r\na good deal of my work in the summer, and we are quite friends. She\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nfond of reading; the mother is an invalid, but she reads aloud while the\r\ndaughter sews, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how many books they get through. When\r\nshe comes for sewing, I like to talk with her about them; I always have\r\nher sit down; it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to realize that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lady. I\xe2\x80\x99m a good deal\r\ncriticised, I know, and I suppose I do spoil her a little; it puts notions\r\ninto such people\xe2\x80\x99s heads, if you meet them in that way; they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty\r\nfree and independent as it is. But when I\xe2\x80\x99m with Lizzie I forget that\r\nthere is any difference between us; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help loving the child. You\r\nmust take Mr. Homos to see them, Mr. Twelvemough. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword hung up over the head of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed; it\xe2\x80\x99s very touching. But\r\nthe poor little place is so bare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely sighed, and there fell a little pause, which she broke with a\r\nquestion she had the effect of having kept back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing I should like to ask you, too, Mr. Homos. Is it true\r\nthat everybody in Altruria does some kind of manual labor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, quite as if he had been an American.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies, too? Or perhaps you have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought this rather offensive, but I could not see that the Altrurian\r\nhad taken it ill. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we had better try to understand each other\r\nclearly before I answer that question. You have no titles of nobility as\r\nthey have in England--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! I hope we have outgrown those superstitions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nMakely, with a republican fervor that did my heart good. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a word\r\nthat we apply first of all to the moral qualities of a person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said just now that you sometimes forgot that your seamstress was\r\nnot a lady. Just what did you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant--I suppose I meant--that she had not the\r\nsurroundings of a lady; the social traditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it has something to do with social as well as moral qualities--with\r\nranks and classes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClasses, yes; but, as you know, we have no ranks in America.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nAltrurian took off his hat and rubbed an imaginable perspiration from his\r\nforehead. He sighed deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely assented, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is. All foreigners find it so.\r\nIn fact, it is something that you have to live into the notion of; it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be explained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my dear madam, will you tell me without further question what\r\nyou understand by a lady, and let me live into the notion of it at my\r\nleisure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it would be so much easier to\r\ntell you _who_ was or who was not a lady. However, your acquaintance is so\r\nlimited yet that I must try to do something in the abstract and impersonal\r\nfor you. In the first place, a lady must be above the sordid anxieties in\r\nevery way. She need not be very rich, but she must have enough, so that\r\nshe need not be harassed about making both ends meet, when she ought to be\r\ndevoting herself to her social duties. The time is past with us when a\r\nlady could look after the dinner, and perhaps cook part of it herself, and\r\nthen rush in to receive her guests and do the amenities. She must have a\r\ncertain kind of house, so that her entourage won\xe2\x80\x99t seem cramped and mean,\r\nand she must have nice frocks, of course, and plenty of them. She needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe of the smart set; that isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all necessary; but she can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to\r\nbe out of the fashion. Of course, she must have a certain training. She\r\nmust have cultivated tastes; she must know about art and literature and\r\nmusic, and all those kind of things, and, though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary to go\r\nin for anything in particular, it won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her to have a fad or two. The\r\nnicest kind of fad is charity; and people go in for that a great deal. I\r\nthink sometimes they use it to work up with, and there are some who use\r\nreligion in the same way; I think it\xe2\x80\x99s horrid; but it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly safe;\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t accuse them of doing it. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say, though, that mere\r\nchurch association doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count socially so much as it used to. Charity\r\nis a great deal more insidious. But you see how hard it is to define\r\na lady. So much has to be left to the nerves, in all these things. And\r\nthen it\xe2\x80\x99s changing all the time; Europe\xe2\x80\x99s coming in, and the old American\r\nideals are passing away. Things that people did ten years ago would be\r\nimpossible now, or at least ridiculous. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be considered vulgar,\r\nquite, but you would certainly be considered a back number, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalmost as bad. Really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I can tell you\r\nwhat a lady is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed together at her frank confession. The Altrurian asked: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\ndo I understand that one of her conditions is that she shall have nothing\r\nwhatever to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to _do_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cA lady is busy from morning till\r\nnight. She always goes to bed perfectly worn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith making herself agreeable and her house attractive, with going to\r\nlunches and teas and dinners and concerts and theatres and art\r\nexhibitions, and charity meetings and receptions, and with writing a\r\nthousand and one notes about them, and accepting and declining, and giving\r\nlunches and dinners, and making calls and receiving them, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat all. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most hideous slavery!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice rose into something\r\nlike a shriek; one could see that her nerves were going at the mere\r\nthought of it all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have a moment to yourself; your life isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyour own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the lady isn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to do any useful kind of work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Work_! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you call all that work, and _useful_? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I envy the\r\ncook in my kitchen at times; I envy the woman that scrubs my floors. Stop!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask why I don\xe2\x80\x99t go into my kitchen, or get down on my knees with the\r\nmop. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible. You simply can\xe2\x80\x99t. Perhaps you could if you were\r\nvery _grande dame_, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re anywhere near the line of necessity, or\r\never have been, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Besides, if we did do our own household work,\r\nas I understand your Altrurian ladies do, what would become of the servant\r\nclass? We should be taking away their living, and that would be wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would certainly be wrong to take away the living of a\r\nfellow-creature,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian gravely admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cand I see the obstacle\r\nin your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, with exhaustion in her voice, but a\r\nreturning amiability; his forbearance must have placated her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what the use of your society life is?\xe2\x80\x9d he ventured, after a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUse? Why should it have any? It kills time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are shut up to a hideous slavery without use, except to kill\r\ntime, and you cannot escape from it without taking away the living of\r\nthose dependent on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is a difficulty that meets us at every turn. It\r\nis something that Matthew Arnold urged with great effect in his paper on\r\nthat crank of a Tolstoy. He asked what would become of the people who need\r\nthe work if we served and waited on ourselves, as Tolstoy preached. The\r\nquestion is unanswerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true; in your conditions, it is unanswerable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAltrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, under the circumstances, we do pretty\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to censure you. And if you believe that your\r\nconditions are the best--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe them the best in the best of all possible worlds,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\ndevoutly; and it struck me that, if ever we came to have a national\r\nchurch, some such affirmation as that concerning our economical conditions\r\nought to be in the confession of faith.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s mind had not followed mine so far. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your young girls,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked of Mrs. Makely--\xe2\x80\x9chow is their time occupied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean after they come out in society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to reflect. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it is very differently occupied.\r\nOf course, they have their own amusements; they have their dances, and\r\nlittle clubs, and their sewing-societies. I suppose that even an Altrurian\r\nwould applaud their sewing for the poor?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely asked, rather\r\nsatirically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; and then he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it taking work away from\r\nsome needy seamstress, though? But I suppose you excuse it to the\r\nthoughtlessness of youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely did not say, and he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I find it so hard to\r\nunderstand is how you ladies can endure a life of mere nervous exertion,\r\nsuch as you have been describing to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you keep well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ keep well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with the greatest amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that when you get above the working classes, till you reach\r\nthe very rich, you would find a perfectly well woman in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that rather extreme?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s shamefully moderate,\xe2\x80\x9d and she seemed to\r\ndelight in having made out such a bad case for her sex. You can\xe2\x80\x99t stop a\r\nwoman of that kind when she gets started; I had better left it alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are forbidden by motives of humanity\r\nfrom doing any sort of manual labor, which you must leave to those who\r\nlive by it, I suppose you take some sort of exercise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, shaking her head gayly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe prefer to take\r\nmedicine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must approve of that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cas you consider\r\nexercise for its own sake insane or immoral. But, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nentreated, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re giving me away at a tremendous rate. I have just been\r\ntelling Mr. Homos that you ladies go in for athletics so much now in your\r\nsummer outings that there is danger of your becoming physically as well as\r\nintellectually superior to us poor fellows. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take that consolation\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the heart to, after the\r\npretty way you\xe2\x80\x99ve put it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t call it very athletic, sitting around on\r\nhotel piazzas all summer long, as nineteen-twentieths of us do. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that there is a Remnant, as Matthew Arnold calls them, who do\r\ngo in for tennis and boating and bathing and tramping and climbing.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused, and then she concluded, gleefully: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you ought to see what\r\nwrecks they get home in the fall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe joke was on me; I could not help laughing, though I felt rather\r\nsheepish before the Altrurian. Fortunately, he did not pursue the inquiry;\r\nhis curiosity had been given a slant aside from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have the summer for rest, however they\r\nuse it. Do they generally leave town? I understood Mr. Twelvemough to say\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a deferential glance at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may say it is the universal custom in the class that can afford\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. She proceeded as if she felt a tacit censure in his\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the least use for us to stay and fry through our\r\nsummers in the city simply because our fathers and brothers had to.\r\nBesides, we are worn out, at the end of the season, and they want us to\r\ncome away as much as we want to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I have always heard that the Americans are beautiful in their\r\nattitude toward women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are perfect dears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cand here comes one of the\r\nbest of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment her husband came up and laid her shawl across her\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose character is it you\xe2\x80\x99re blasting?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, jocosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere in the world did you find it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, meaning the shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was where you left it--on the sofa, in the side parlor. I had to take\r\nmy life in my hand when I crossed among all those waltzers in there. There\r\nmust have been as many as three couples on the floor. Poor girls! I pity\r\nthem, off at these places. The fellows in town have a good deal better\r\ntime. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got their clubs, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the theatre, and when the\r\nweather gets too much for them they can run off down to the shore for the\r\nnight. The places anywhere within an hour\xe2\x80\x99s ride are full of fellows. The\r\ngirls don\xe2\x80\x99t have to dance with one another there, or with little boys. Of\r\ncourse, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right if they like it better.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed at his wife,\r\nand winked at me, and smoked swiftly, in emphasis of his irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the young gentlemen whom the young ladies here usually meet in\r\nsociety are all at work in the cities?\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian asked him, rather\r\nneedlessly, as I had already said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, those who are not out West, growing up with the country, except, of\r\ncourse, the fellows who have inherited a fortune. They\xe2\x80\x99re mostly off on\r\nyachts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do your young men go West to grow up with the country?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the East is _grown_ up. They have got to hustle, and the West is\r\nthe place to hustle. To make money,\xe2\x80\x9d added Makely, in response to a\r\npuzzled glance of the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI almost hate the name of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t hate the thing, Peggy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we must have it, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey used to say about the\r\ngirls who grew into old maids just after the Rebellion that they had lost\r\ntheir chance in the war for the Union. I think quite as many lose their\r\nchance now in the war for the dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars hath slain his thousands, but Mammon hath slain his tens of\r\nthousands,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested, lightly; we all like to recognize the facts, so\r\nlong as we are not expected to do anything about them; then, we deny them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite as bad as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, you are expensive, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cand if we\r\nwant to have you--why, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hustle first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you, you poor things! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done about\r\nit; it\xe2\x80\x99s just got to go on and on; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it\xe2\x80\x99s ever to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian had been following us with that air of polite mystification\r\nwhich I had begun to dread in him. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, in your good society you\r\npostpone, and even forego, the happiness of life in the struggle to be\r\nrich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Makely, \xe2\x80\x9ca fellow don\xe2\x80\x99t like to ask a girl to share\r\na home that isn\xe2\x80\x99t as nice as the home she has left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife put in, rather sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that it\xe2\x80\x99s all a\r\nmistake, and that we\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to share the privations of the man we\r\nloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Makely, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to risk it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed with him, but his wife did not, and in the silence that ensued\r\nthere was nothing to prevent the Altrurian from coming in with another of\r\nhis questions: \xe2\x80\x9cHow far does this state of things extend downward? Does it\r\ninclude the working classes, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d we all answered together, and Mrs. Makely said: \xe2\x80\x9cWith your\r\nAltrurian ideas, I suppose you would naturally sympathize a great deal\r\nmore with the lower classes, and think they had to endure all the\r\nhardships in our system; but if you could realize how the struggle goes on\r\nin the best society, and how we all have to fight for what we get, or\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get, you would be disposed to pity our upper classes, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian.\r\n\r\nMakely remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cI used to hear my father say that slavery was harder on\r\nthe whites than it was on the blacks, and that he wanted it done away with\r\nfor the sake of the masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMakely rather faltered in conclusion, as if he were not quite satisfied\r\nwith his remark, and I distinctly felt a want of proportion in it; but I\r\ndid not wish to say anything. His wife had no reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s no comparison between the two things, but the struggle\r\ncertainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the working classes as it does us. They go on\r\nmarrying and giving in marriage in the old way. They have nothing to lose,\r\nand so they can afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed am dem what don\xe2\x80\x99t expect nuffin! Oh, I tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nworking-man\xe2\x80\x99s country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Makely, through his cigar-smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought\r\nto see them in town, these summer nights, in the parks and squares and\r\ncheap theatres. Their girls are not off for their health, anywhere, and\r\ntheir fellows are not off growing up with the country. Their day\xe2\x80\x99s work is\r\nover, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going in for a good time. And, then, walk through the\r\nstreets where they live, and see them out on the stoops with their wives\r\nand children! I tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make a fellow wish he was poor\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing how strong and well those women\r\nkeep, with their great families and their hard work. Sometimes I really\r\nenvy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they are aware of the\r\nsacrifices which the ladies of the upper classes make in leaving all the\r\nwork to them, and suffering from the nervous debility which seems to be\r\nthe outcome of your society life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not the remotest idea of it. They have no conception of what a\r\nsociety woman goes through with. They think we do nothing. They envy us,\r\ntoo, and sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re so ungrateful and indifferent, if you try to\r\nhelp them, or get on terms with them, that I believe they hate us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that comes from ignorance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they are really any more ignorant of us\r\nthan we are of them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the other half on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that a pity, rather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, but what can you do? You can\xe2\x80\x99t know what people\r\nare like unless you live like them, and then the question is whether the\r\ngame is worth the candle. I should like to know how you manage in\r\nAltruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we have solved the problem in the only way, as you say, that it can\r\nbe solved. We all live alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little, just a very trifling little bit, monotonous?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nMakely asked, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is everything, of course, in being\r\nused to it. To an unregenerate spirit--like mine, for example--it seems\r\nintolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? When you were younger, before you were married, you all lived at\r\nhome together--or, perhaps, you were an only child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no indeed! There were ten of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you all lived alike, and shared equally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but we were a family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not conceive of the human race except as a family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, excuse me, Mr. Homos, that is all nonsense. You cannot have the\r\nfamily feeling without love, and it is impossible to love other people.\r\nThat talk about the neighbor, and all that, is all well enough--\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped herself, as if she dimly remembered who began that talk, and then\r\nwent on: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I accept it as a matter of faith, and the spirit of\r\nit, nobody denies that; but what I mean is, that you must have frightful\r\nquarrels all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to look as if this were where she really\r\nmeant to bring up, and he took her on the ground she had chosen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have quarrels. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe fought like little cats and dogs, at times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMakely and I burst into a laugh at her magnanimous frankness. The\r\nAltrurian remained serious. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, because you lived alike, you knew each\r\nother, and so you easily made up your quarrels. It is quite as simple with\r\nus, in our life as a human family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis notion of a human family seemed to amuse Mrs. Makely more and more;\r\nshe laughed and laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted, at last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot imagine it! No, it is too ludicrous. Just fancy the jars of\r\nan ordinary family multiplied by the population of a whole continent! Why,\r\nyou must be in a perpetual squabble. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have any peace of your\r\nlives. It\xe2\x80\x99s worse, far worse, than our way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are supposing our family to be made up of\r\npeople with all the antagonistic interests of your civilization. As a\r\nmatter of fact--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! _I know human nature_, Mr. Homos!\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly jumped up and\r\ngave him her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sweetly, and as she drifted off\r\non her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm she looked back at us and nodded in gay triumph.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian turned upon me with unabated interest. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you no\r\nprovision in your system for finally making the lower classes understand\r\nthe sufferings and sacrifices of the upper classes in their behalf? Do you\r\nexpect to do nothing to bring them together in mutual kindness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, throwing the end of my cigar away. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to bed--aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night. Are you sure you can find your room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI left my guest abruptly, with a feeling of vexation not very easily\r\ndefinable. His repetition of questions about questions which society has\r\nso often answered, and always in the same way, was not so bad in him as it\r\nwould have been in a person of our civilization; he represented a wholly\r\ndifferent state of things, the inversion of our own, and much could be\r\nforgiven him for that reason, just as in Russia much could be forgiven to\r\nan American if he formulated his curiosity concerning imperialism from a\r\npurely republican experience. I knew that in Altruria, for instance, the\r\npossession of great gifts, of any kind of superiority, involved the sense\r\nof obligation to others, and the wish to identify one\xe2\x80\x99s self with the\r\ngreat mass of men, rather than the ambition to distinguish one\xe2\x80\x99s self from\r\nthem; and that the Altrurians honored their gifted men in the measure they\r\ndid this. A man reared in such a civilization must naturally find it\r\ndifficult to get our point of view; with social inclusion as the ideal, he\r\nwould with difficulty conceive of our ideal of social exclusion; but I\r\nthink we had all been very patient with him; we should have made short\r\nwork with an American who had approached us with the same inquiries.\r\nEven from a foreigner, the citizen of a republic founded on the notion,\r\nelsewhere exploded ever since Cain, that one is his brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper,\r\nthe things he asked seemed inoffensive only because they were puerile;\r\nbut they certainly were puerile. I felt that it ought to have been\r\nself-evident to him that when a commonwealth of sixty million Americans\r\nbased itself upon the great principle of self-seeking, self-seeking was\r\nthe best thing, and, whatever hardship it seemed to work, it must carry\r\nwith it unseen blessings in tenfold measure. If a few hundred thousand\r\nfavored Americans enjoyed the privilege of socially contemning all the\r\nrest, it was as clearly right and just that they should do so as that four\r\nthousand American millionaires should be richer than all the other\r\nAmericans put together. Such a status, growing out of our political\r\nequality and our material prosperity, must evince a divine purpose to any\r\none intimate with the designs of Providence, and it seemed a kind of\r\nimpiety to doubt its perfection. I excused the misgivings which I could\r\nnot help seeing in the Altrurian to his alien traditions, and I was aware\r\nthat my friends had done so, too. But, if I could judge from myself, he\r\nmust have left them all sensible of their effort; and this was not\r\npleasant. I could not blink the fact that although I had openly disagreed\r\nwith him on every point of ethics and economics, I was still responsible\r\nfor him as a guest. It was as if an English gentleman had introduced a\r\nblatant American Democrat into Tory society; or, rather, as if a\r\nSoutherner of the olden time had harbored a Northern Abolitionist and\r\npermitted him to inquire into the workings of slavery among his neighbors.\r\nPeople would tolerate him as my guest for a time, but there must be an end\r\nof their patience with the tacit enmity of his sentiments and the explicit\r\nvulgarity of his ideals, and when the end came I must be attainted with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI did not like the notion of this, and I meant to escape it if I could. I\r\nconfess that I would have willingly disowned him, as I had already\r\ndisavowed his opinions, but there was no way of doing it short of telling\r\nhim to go away, and I was not ready to do that. Something in the man, I do\r\nnot know what, mysteriously appealed to me. He was not contemptibly\r\npuerile without being lovably childlike, and I could only make up my mind\r\nto be more and more frank with him and to try and shield him, as well as\r\nmyself, from the effects I dreaded.\r\n\r\nI fell asleep planning an excursion farther into the mountains, which\r\nshould take up the rest of the week that I expected him to stay with me,\r\nand would keep him from following up his studies of American life where\r\nthey would be so injurious to both of us as they must in our hotel. A\r\nknock at my door roused me, and I sent a drowsy \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d toward it from\r\nthe bedclothes without looking that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d came back in the rich, gentle voice of the Altrurian. I\r\nlifted my head with a jerk from the pillow, and saw him standing against\r\nthe closed door, with my shoes in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sorry I waked you. I\r\nthought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite time, I dare say. But you\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have taken the trouble to bring my shoes in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether disinterested in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI wished you to\r\ncompliment me on them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they are pretty well done, for an\r\namateur?\xe2\x80\x9d He came toward my bed, and turned them about in his hands, so\r\nthat they would catch the light, and smiled down upon me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI blacked them, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou blacked them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, easily. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would go into the baggage-room,\r\nafter we parted last night, to look for a piece of mine that had not been\r\ntaken to my room, and I found the porter there, with his wrist bound up.\r\nHe said he had strained it in handling a lady\xe2\x80\x99s Saratoga--he said a\r\nSaratoga was a large trunk--and I begged him to let me relieve him at the\r\nboots he was blacking. He refused at first, but I insisted upon trying my\r\nhand at a pair, and then he let me go on with the men\xe2\x80\x99s boots; he said he\r\ncould varnish the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 without hurting his wrist. It needed less skill\r\nthan I supposed, and after I had done a few pairs he said I could black\r\nboots as well as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anybody see you?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped, and I felt a cold perspiration break out\r\non me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we had the whole midnight hour to ourselves. The porter\xe2\x80\x99s work with\r\nthe baggage was all over, and there was nothing to interrupt the\r\ndelightful chat we fell into. He is a very intelligent man, and he told me\r\nall about that custom of feeing which you deprecate. He says that the\r\nservants hate it as much as the guests; they have to take the tips now\r\nbecause the landlords figure on them in the wages, and they cannot live\r\nwithout them. He is a fine, manly fellow, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d I broke in, with the strength I found in his assurance that\r\nno one had seen him helping the porter black boots, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak very\r\nseriously with you, and I hope you will not be hurt if I speak very\r\nplainly about a matter in which I have your good solely at heart.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nwas not quite true, and I winced inwardly a little when he thanked me with\r\nthat confounded sincerity of his which was so much like irony; but I went\r\non: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty to you, as my guest, to tell you that this thing of\r\ndoing for others is not such a simple matter here, as your peculiar\r\ntraining leads you to think. You have been deceived by a superficial\r\nlikeness; but, really, I do not understand how you could have read all you\r\nhave done about us and not realize before coming here that America and\r\nAltruria are absolutely distinct and diverse in their actuating\r\nprinciples. They are both republics, I know; but America is a republic\r\nwhere every man is for himself, and you cannot help others as you do at\r\nhome; it is dangerous--it is ridiculous. You must keep this fact in mind,\r\nor you will fall into errors that will be very embarrassing to you in your\r\nstay among us, and,\xe2\x80\x9d I was forced to add, \xe2\x80\x9cto all your friends. Now, I\r\ncertainly hoped, after what I had said to you and what my friends had\r\nexplained of our civilization, that you would not have done a thing of\r\nthis kind. I will see the porter, as soon as I am up, and ask him not to\r\nmention the matter to any one, but, I confess, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to take an\r\napologetic tone with him; your conditions are so alien to ours that they\r\nwill seem incredible to him, and he will think I am stuffing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he will think that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t find the case so bad as it seems to you. I am extremely sorry to\r\nhave done wrong--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wrong in itself. It was only wrong under the\r\ncircumstances. Abstractly, it is quite right to help a fellow-being who\r\nneeds help; no one denies that, even in a country where every one is for\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, at least, I have not\r\ngone radically astray; and I do not think you need take the trouble to\r\nexplain the Altrurian ideas to the porter. I have done that already, and\r\nthey seemed quite conceivable to him; he said that poor folks had to act\r\nupon them, even here, more or less, and that if they did not act upon them\r\nthere would be no chance for them at all. He says they have to help one\r\nanother very much as we do at home, and that it is only the rich folks\r\namong you who are independent. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need speak to him\r\nat all, unless you wish; and I was very careful to guard my offer of help\r\nat the point where I understood from you and your friends that it might do\r\nharm. I asked him if there was not some one who would help him out with\r\nhis boot-blacking for money, because in that case I should be glad to pay\r\nhim; but he said there was no one about who would take the job; that he\r\nhad to agree to black the boots, or else he would not have got the place\r\nof porter, but that all the rest of the help would consider it a disgrace,\r\nand would not help him for love or money. So it seemed quite safe to offer\r\nhim my services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that the matter was almost hopeless, but I asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what he\r\nsaid--didn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest anything else to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian, in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t it occur to you that if none of his fellow-servants were willing\r\nto help him black boots, and if he did it only because he was obliged to,\r\nit was hardly the sort of work for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, with absolute simplicity. He must have\r\nperceived the despair I fell into at this answer, for he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nshould I have minded doing for others what I should have been willing to\r\ndo for myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a great many things we are willing to do for ourselves that we\r\nare not willing to do for others. But even on that principle, which I\r\nthink false and illogical, you could not be justified. A gentleman is not\r\nwilling to black _his own_ boots. It is offensive to his feelings, to his\r\nself-respect; it is something he will not do if he can get anybody else to\r\ndo it for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in America,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not offensive to the\r\nfeelings of a gentleman to let another do for him what he would not do for\r\nhimself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we understand something altogether different by\r\nthe word gentleman in Altruria. I see, now, how I have committed a\r\nmistake. I shall be more careful hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought I had better leave the subject, and, \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-way,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nwould you like to take a little tramp with me to-day farther up into the\r\nmountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, so gratefully that I was\r\nashamed to think why I was proposing the pleasure to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I shall be ready to start as soon as we have had breakfast. I\r\nwill join you down-stairs in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left me at this hint, though really I was half afraid he might stay and\r\noffer to lend me a hand at my toilet, in the expression of his national\r\ncharacter. I found him with Mrs. Makely, when I went down, and she began,\r\nwith a parenthetical tribute to the beauty of the mountains in the morning\r\nlight: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see me up at this unnatural hour. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether it was the excitement of our talk last night, or what it was,\r\nbut my sulphonal wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t act, though I took fifteen grains, and I was up\r\nwith the lark, or should have been, if there had been any lark outside of\r\nliterature to be up with. However, this air is so glorious that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind losing a night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep now and then. I believe that with a little\r\npractice one could get along without any sleep at all here; at least, _I_\r\ncould. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say poor Mr. Makely _can\xe2\x80\x99t_, apparently. He\xe2\x80\x99s making\r\nup for his share of my vigils, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to breakfast without him. Do\r\nyou know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a very bold thing: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the head-waiter to give\r\nyou places at our table; I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll hate it, Mr. Twelvemough, because\r\nyou naturally want to keep Mr. Homos to yourself, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you at\r\nall; but I\xe2\x80\x99m simply not going to _let_ you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pleasure I felt at this announcement was not unmixed, but I tried to\r\nkeep Mrs. Makely from thinking so, and I was immensely relieved when she\r\nfound a chance to say to me, in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI know just how you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfeeling, Mr. Twelvemough, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to help you keep him from doing\r\nanything ridiculous, if I can. I _like_ him, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect\r\nshame to have people laughing at him. I know we can manage him between\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe so far failed, however, that the Altrurian shook hands with the\r\nhead-waiter when he pressed open the wire-netting door to let us into the\r\ndining-room, and made a bow to our waitress of the sort one makes to a\r\nlady. But we thought it best to ignore these little errors of his and\r\nreserve our moral strength for anything more spectacular. Fortunately we\r\ngot through our breakfast with nothing worse than his jumping up and\r\nstooping to hand the waitress a spoon she let fall; but this could easily\r\npass for some attention to Mrs. Makely at a little distance. There were\r\nnot many people down to breakfast yet; but I could see that there was a\r\ngood deal of subdued sensation among the waitresses, standing with folded\r\narms behind their tables, and that the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s handsome face was red\r\nwith anxiety.\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely asked if we were going to church. She said she was driving\r\nthat way, and would be glad to drop us. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make anything of the sermon, with my head\r\nin the state it is, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to compromise on a good action. I want\r\nto carry some books and papers over to Mrs. Camp. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\r\nwill be quite as acceptable, Mr. Homos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should venture to hope it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a tolerant seriousness not\r\naltogether out of keeping with her lightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mrs. Camp?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, not caring to commit myself on the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s mother. You know I told you about them last night. I think she\r\nmust have got through the books I lent her, and I know Lizzie didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto ask me for more, because she saw me talking with you, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto interrupt us. Such a nice girl! I think the Sunday papers must have\r\ncome, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them over, too; Mrs. Camp is always so glad to get\r\nthem, and she is so delightful when she gets going about public events.\r\nBut perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of Sunday papers, Mr. Homos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, madam. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them yet. You know this is\r\nthe first Sunday I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say you won\xe2\x80\x99t see the old Puritan Sabbath,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nMakely, with an abrupt deflection from the question of the Sunday papers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough you ought to, up in these hills. The only thing left of it is\r\nrye-and-Indian bread, and these baked beans and fish-balls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are very good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I dare say they are not the worst of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a woman who tended to levity, and I was a little afraid she might\r\nbe going to say something irreverent; but, if she were, she was\r\nforestalled by the Altrurian asking: \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be very indiscreet, madam,\r\nif I were to ask you some time to introduce me to that family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Camps?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I should be perfectly delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The thought seemed to strike her, and she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not go with me this\r\nmorning, unless you are inflexibly bent on going to church, you and Mr.\r\nTwelvemough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian glanced at me, and I said I should be only too glad, if I\r\ncould carry some books, so that I could compromise on a good action, too.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake one of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d she instantly suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too severe upon it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Camp might,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely consented, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cShe goes\r\nin for rather serious fiction; but I think Lizzie would enjoy a good,\r\nold-fashioned love-story, where everybody got married, as they do in your\r\ncharming books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI winced a little, for every one likes to be regarded seriously, and I did\r\nnot enjoy being remanded to the young-girl public; but I put a bold face\r\non it, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy good action shall be done in behalf of Miss Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Mrs. Makely having left word with the clerk where we\r\nwere gone, so that her husband need not be alarmed when he got up, we were\r\nstriking into the hills on a two-seated buckboard, with one of the best\r\nteams of our hotel, and one of the most taciturn drivers. Mrs. Makely had\r\nthe Altrurian get into the back seat with her, and, after some attempts to\r\nmake talk with the driver, I leaned over and joined in their talk. The\r\nAltrurian was greatly interested, not so much in the landscape--though he\r\nowned its beauty when we cried out over it from point to point--but in the\r\nhuman incidents and features. He noticed the cattle in the fields, and the\r\nhorses we met on the road, and the taste and comfort of the buildings, the\r\nvariety of the crops, and the promise of the harvest. I was glad of the\r\nrespite his questions gave me from the study of the intimate character of\r\nour civilization, for they were directed now at these more material facts,\r\nand I willingly joined Mrs. Makely in answering them. We explained that\r\nthe finest teams we met were from the different hotels or boarding-houses,\r\nor at least from the farms where the people took city people to board; and\r\nthat certain shabby equipages belonged to the natives who lived solely by\r\ncultivating the soil. There was not very much of the soil cultivated, for\r\nthe chief crop was hay, with here and there a patch of potatoes or beans,\r\nand a few acres in sweet-corn. The houses of the natives, when they were\r\nfor their use only, were no better than their turnouts; it was where the\r\ncity boarder had found shelter that they were modern and pleasant. Now and\r\nthen we came to a deserted homestead, and I tried to make the Altrurian\r\nunderstand how farming in New England had yielded to the competition of\r\nthe immense agricultural operations of the West. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nagriculture is really an operation out there, as much as coal-mining is in\r\nPennsylvania, or finance in Wall Street; you have no idea of the vastness\r\nof the scale.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps I swelled a little with pride in my celebration of\r\nthe national prosperity, as it flowed from our Western farms of five and\r\nten and twenty thousand acres; I could not very well help putting on the\r\npedal in these passages. Mrs. Makely listened almost, as eagerly, as the\r\nAltrurian, for, as a cultivated American woman, she was necessarily\r\nquite ignorant of her own country, geographically, politically, and\r\nhistorically. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only people left in the hill country of New England,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9care those who are too old or too lazy to get away. Any young\r\nman of energy would be ashamed to stay, unless he wanted to keep a\r\nboarding-house or live on the city vacationists in summer. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nhe goes West and takes up some of the new land, and comes back in\r\nmiddle-life and buys a deserted farm to spend his summers on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so simple as that? Then we can\r\nhardly wonder at their owners leaving these worn-out farms; though I\r\nsuppose it must be with the pang of exile, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I fancy there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much sentiment involved,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, speaking to the horses before she spoke to the\r\ndriver, as some women will. He pulled them up, and looked round at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Reuben Camp, _now_, over there by that house?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as\r\nif we had been talking of him; that is another way some women have.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, then!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cReuben!\xe2\x80\x9d she called to the young man, who was\r\nprowling about the door-yard of a sad-colored old farm-house, and peering\r\ninto a window here and there. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here a moment--won\xe2\x80\x99t you, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted his head and looked round, and, when he had located the appeal\r\nmade to him, he came down the walk to the gate and leaned over it, waiting\r\nfor further instructions. I saw that it was the young man whom we had\r\nnoticed with the girl Mrs. Makely called Lizzie on the hotel piazza the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know whether I should find Lizzie at home this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s there with mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young fellow, with neither liking\r\nnor disliking in his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but she might be at\r\nchurch. What in the world has happened here? Is there anything unusual\r\ngoing on inside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I was just looking to see if it was all right. The folks wanted I\r\nshould come round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; gone West. They\xe2\x80\x99ve left the old place, because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nliving here any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is quite a case in point,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Homos, here is a\r\nchance to inform yourself at first hand about a very interesting fact of\r\nour civilization\xe2\x80\x9d; and I added, in a low voice, to Mrs. Makely: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nintroduce us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Mr. Camp, this is Mr. Twelvemough, the author--you know his\r\nbooks, of course; and Mr. Homos, a gentleman from Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow opened the gate he leaned on and came out to us. He took\r\nno notice of me, but he seized the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s hand and wrung it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard of _you_\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Makely, were you going to our place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do, then. Mother would give almost anything to see Mr. Homos. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard of Altruria, over our way,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to our friend. \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nreading up all she can about it. She\xe2\x80\x99ll want to talk with you, and she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t give the rest of us much of a chance, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall be glad to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cand to tell her\r\neverything I can. But won\xe2\x80\x99t you explain to me first something about your\r\ndeserted farms here? It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a new thing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new thing to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young fellow, with a short laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to explain about it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see them all through New\r\nEngland. When a man finds he can\xe2\x80\x99t get his funeral expenses out of the\r\nland, he don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like staying to be buried in it, and he pulls up and\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people used to get their living expenses here,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t they now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t use to have Western prices to fight with; and then the\r\nland wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worn out so, and the taxes were not so heavy. How would you\r\nlike to pay twenty to thirty dollars on the thousand, and assessed up to\r\nthe last notch, in the city?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what in the world makes your taxes so heavy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchools and roads. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have schools, and you city folks want\r\ngood roads when you come here in the summer, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Then the season is\r\nshort, and sometimes we can\xe2\x80\x99t make a crop. The frost catches the corn in\r\nthe field, and you have your trouble for your pains. Potatoes are the only\r\nthing we can count on, except grass, and, when everybody raises potatoes,\r\nyou know where the price goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but now, Mr. Camp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, leaning over toward him, and\r\nspeaking in a cosey and coaxing tone, as if he must not really keep the\r\ntruth from an old friend like her, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t it a good deal because the\r\nfarmers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters want pianos, and the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 sons want buggies? I\r\nheard Professor Lumen saying, the other day, that, if the farmers were\r\nwilling to work as they used to work, they could still get a good living\r\noff their farms, and that they gave up their places because they were too\r\nlazy, in many cases, to farm them properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d better not let _me_ hear him saying that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young fellow,\r\nwhile a hot flush passed over his face. He added, bitterly: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he wants\r\nto see how easy it is to make a living up here, he can take this place and\r\ntry for a year or two; he can get it cheap. But I guess he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nit the year round; he\xe2\x80\x99d only want it a few months in the summer, when he\r\ncould enjoy the sightliness of it, and see me working over there on my\r\nfarm, while he smoked on his front porch.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned round and looked at\r\nthe old house in silence a moment. Then, as he went on, his voice lost its\r\nangry ring. \xe2\x80\x9cThe folks here bought this place from the Indians, and they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen here more than two hundred years. Do you think they left it because\r\nthey were too lazy to run it, or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get pianos and buggies out of\r\nit, or were such fools as not to know whether they were well off? It was\r\ntheir _home_; they were born and lived and died here. There is the family\r\nburying-ground over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither Mrs. Makely nor myself was ready with a reply, and we left the\r\nword with the Altrurian, who suggested: \xe2\x80\x9cStill, I suppose they will be\r\nmore prosperous in the West on the new land they take up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow leaned his arms on the wheel by which he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou mean by taking up new land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, out of the public domain--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ any public domain that\xe2\x80\x99s worth having. All the good land is\r\nin the hands of railroads and farm syndicates and speculators; and if you\r\nwant a farm in the West you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to buy it; the East is the only place\r\nwhere folks give them away, because they ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth keeping. If you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got the ready money, you can buy one on credit, and pay ten,\r\ntwenty, and thirty per cent. interest, and live in a dugout on the\r\nplains--till your mortgage matures.\xe2\x80\x9d The young man took his arms from the\r\nwheel and moved a few steps backward, as he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you over at\r\nthe house later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver touched his horses, and we started briskly off again. But I\r\nconfess I had quite enough of his pessimism, and as we drove away I leaned\r\nback toward the Altrurian and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, it is all perfect nonsense to\r\npretend that things are at that pass with us. There are more millionaires\r\nin America, probably, than there are in all the other civilized countries\r\nof the globe, and it is not possible that the farming population should be\r\nin such a hopeless condition. All wealth comes out of the earth, and you\r\nmay be sure they get their full share of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning\r\nof this new party in the West that seems to have held a convention lately?\r\nI read something of it in the train yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is a lot of crazy Hayseeds, who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay back the money\r\nthey have borrowed, or who find themselves unable to meet their interest.\r\nIt will soon blow over. We are always having these political flurries. A\r\ngood crop will make it all right with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it true that they have to pay such rates of interest as our young\r\nfriend mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, seeing the thing in the humorous light which softens for\r\nus Americans so many of the hardships of others, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that man likes\r\nto squeeze his brother man when he gets him in his grip. That\xe2\x80\x99s human\r\nnature, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that he had asked something like that before when I\r\nalleged human nature in defence of some piece of every-day selfishness.\r\nBut I thought best not to notice it, and I went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThe land is so rich\r\nout there that a farm will often pay for itself with a single crop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose it seldom really\r\nhappens that a mortgage is foreclosed, in the way our young friend\r\ninsinuated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that exactly\xe2\x80\x9d; and, having admitted so much, I did not\r\nfeel bound to impart a fact that popped perversely into my mind. I was\r\nonce talking with a Western money-lender, a very good sort of fellow,\r\nfrank and open as the day; I asked him whether the farmers generally paid\r\noff their mortgages, and he answered me that if the mortgage was to the\r\nvalue of a fourth of the land, the farmer might pay it off, but if it were\r\nto a half, or a third even, he never paid it, but slaved on and died in\r\nhis debts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure, however,\xe2\x80\x9d I concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our young friend\r\ntakes a jaundiced view of the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cI must insist upon dropping this\r\neverlasting talk about money. I think it is perfectly disgusting, and I\r\nbelieve it was Mr. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s account of his speculations that kept me awake\r\nlast night. My brain got running on figures till the dark seemed to be all\r\nsown with dollar-marks, like the stars in the Milky Way. I--ugh! What in\r\nthe world is it? Oh, you dreadful little things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely passed swiftly from terror to hysterical laughter as the\r\ndriver pulled up short and a group of barefooted children broke in front\r\nof his horses and scuttled out of the dust into the road-side bushes like\r\na covey of quails. There seemed to be a dozen of them, nearly all the same\r\nin size, but there turned out to be only five or six; or at least no more\r\nshowed their gleaming eyes and teeth through the underbrush in quiet\r\nenjoyment of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that you might have got killed?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, with that\r\nseverity good women feel for people who have just escaped with their\r\nlives. \xe2\x80\x9cHow lovely the dirty little dears are!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in the next\r\nwave of emotion. One bold fellow of six showed a half-length above the\r\nbushes, and she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to play in the\r\nroad when there are so many teams passing? Are all those your brothers and\r\nsisters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ignored the first question. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d I pulled out a\r\nhalf-dozen coppers, and held my hand toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if there is one\r\nfor each.\xe2\x80\x9d They had no difficulty in solving the simple mathematical\r\nproblem except the smallest girl, who cried for fear and baffled longing.\r\nI tossed the coin to her, and a little fat dog darted out at her feet and\r\ncaught it up in his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, good gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d I called out in my light,\r\nhumorous way. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend it for candy?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlittle people thought that a famous joke, and they laughed with the\r\ngratitude that even small favors inspire. \xe2\x80\x9cBring your sister here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said\r\nto the boldest boy, and, when he came up with the little woman, I put\r\nanother copper into her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out that the greedy dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and my gayety met with fresh applause. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked, with some vague purpose of showing the Altrurian the kindliness\r\nthat exists between our upper and lower classes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. I followed the twist of his head, and glimpsed\r\na wooden cottage on the border of the forest, so very new that the\r\nsheathing had not yet been covered with clapboards. I stood up in the\r\nbuckboard and saw that it was a story and a half high, and could have had\r\nfour or five rooms in it. The bare, curtainless windows were set in the\r\nunpainted frames, but the front door seemed not to be hung yet. The people\r\nmeant to winter there, however, for the sod was banked up against the\r\nwooden underpinning; a stovepipe stuck out of the roof of a little wing\r\nbehind. While I gazed a young-looking woman came to the door, as if she\r\nhad been drawn by our talk with the children, and then she jumped down\r\nfrom the threshold, which still wanted a doorstep, and came slowly out to\r\nus. The children ran to her with their coppers, and then followed her back\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely called to her before she reached us: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfrightened. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t drive over any of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very safe place\r\nto bring up children, in the country, and I never feel uneasy about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if they are not under the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, mingling\r\ninstruction and amusement very judiciously in her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they all\r\nyours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly five,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, and she pointed to the alien in her flock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s my sister\xe2\x80\x99s. She lives just below here.\xe2\x80\x9d Her children had grouped\r\nthemselves about her, and she kept passing her hands caressingly over\r\ntheir little heads as she talked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister has nine children, but she\r\nhas the rest at church with her to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like an American,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we\xe2\x80\x99re English. Our husbands work in the quarry. That\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ little\r\npalace.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman nodded her head toward the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with an evident perception\r\nof her pride in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if we ever get money to finish it. Thank you for the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was this gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely indicated me, and I bore the\r\nmerit of my good action as modestly as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thank _you_, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, and she asked Mrs. Makely:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not living about here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, we\xe2\x80\x99re staying at the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the hotel! It must be very dear, there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is expensive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with a note of that satisfaction\r\nin her voice which we all feel in spending a great deal of money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose you can afford it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, whose eye was running\r\nhungrily over Mrs. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s pretty costume. \xe2\x80\x9cSome are poor, and some are\r\nrich. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the world has to be made up, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, very dryly, and the talk languished from this\r\npoint, so that the driver felt warranted in starting up his horses. When\r\nwe had driven beyond earshot she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she was not an American,\r\nas soon as she spoke, by her accent, and then those foreigners have no\r\nself-respect. That was a pretty bold bid for a contribution to finish up\r\nher \xe2\x80\x98little palace\xe2\x80\x99! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give her anything, Mr.\r\nTwelvemough. I was afraid your sympathies had been wrought upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the mischief I had done with the\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian, who has not asked anything for a long time, but had\r\nlistened with eager interest to all that passed, now came up smiling with\r\nhis question: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly tell me what harm would have been done by\r\noffering the woman a little money to help finish up her cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not allow Mrs. Makely to answer, I was so eager to air my political\r\neconomy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe very greatest harm. It would have pauperized her. You have\r\nno idea how quickly they give way to the poison of that sort of thing. As\r\nsoon as they get any sort of help they expect more; they count upon it,\r\nand they begin to live upon it. The sight of those coppers which I gave\r\nher children--more out of joke than charity--demoralized the woman. She\r\ntook us for rich people, and wanted us to build her a house. You have to\r\nguard against every approach to a thing of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat an American would have hinted,\r\nas she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, an American would not have done that, I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful to say. They take\r\nfees, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t ask charity, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d We went on to exult in the noble\r\nindependence of the American character in all classes, at some length. We\r\ntalked at the Altrurian, but he did not seem to hear us. At last he asked,\r\nwith a faint sigh: \xe2\x80\x9cThen, in your conditions, a kindly impulse to aid one\r\nwho needs your help is something to be guarded against as possibly\r\npernicious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you see what difficulties beset us in dealing\r\nwith the problem of poverty. We cannot let people suffer, for that would\r\nbe cruel; and we cannot relieve their need without pauperizing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a terrible quandary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would tell us just how you manage\r\nwith the poor in Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have none,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the comparatively poor--you have some people who are richer than\r\nothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We should regard that as the worst incivism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is incivism?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI interpreted, \xe2\x80\x9cBad citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you will excuse me, Mr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that is\r\nsimply impossible. There _must_ be rich and there _must_ be poor. There\r\nalways have been, and there always will be. That woman said it as well as\r\nanybody. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Christ Himself say, \xe2\x80\x98The poor ye have always with you\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian looked at Mrs. Makely with an amazement visibly heightened\r\nby the air of complacency she put on after delivering this poser: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nreally think Christ meant that you _ought_ always to have the poor with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow else are the sympathies\r\nof the rich to be cultivated? The poverty of some and the wealth of\r\nothers, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what forms the great tie of human brotherhood? If we\r\nwere all comfortable, or all shared alike, there could not be anything\r\nlike charity, and Paul said, \xe2\x80\x98The greatest of these is charity.\xe2\x80\x99 I believe\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 in the new version, but it comes to the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian gave a kind of gasp, and then lapsed into a silence that\r\nlasted until we came in sight of the Camp farm-house. It stood on the\r\ncrest of a road-side upland, and looked down the beautiful valley, bathed\r\nin Sabbath sunlight, and away to the ranges of hills, so far that it was\r\nhard to say whether it was sun or shadow that dimmed their distance.\r\nDecidedly, the place was what the country people call sightly. The old\r\nhouse, once painted a Brandon red, crouched low to the ground, with its\r\nlean-to in the rear, and its flat-arched wood-sheds and wagon-houses\r\nstretching away at the side of the barn, and covering the approach to it\r\nwith an unbroken roof. There were flowers in the beds along the\r\nunderpinning of the house, which stood close to the street, and on one\r\nside of the door was a clump of Spanish willow; an old-fashioned June rose\r\nclimbed over it from the other. An aged dog got stiffly to his feet from\r\nthe threshold stone and whimpered as our buckboard drew up; the poultry\r\npicking about the path and among the chips lazily made way for us, and as\r\nour wheels ceased to crunch upon the gravel we heard hasty steps, and\r\nReuben Camp came round the corner of the house in time to give Mrs. Makely\r\nhis hand and help her spring to the ground, which she did very lightly;\r\nher remarkable mind had kept her body in a sort of sympathetic activity,\r\nand at thirty-five she had the gracile ease and self-command of a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, permitting herself to call him by his first\r\nname, with the emotion which expressed itself more definitely in the words\r\nthat followed, \xe2\x80\x9chow I envy you all this dear, old, homelike place! I never\r\ncome here without thinking of my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s farm in Massachusetts,\r\nwhere I used to go every summer when I was a little girl. If I had a place\r\nlike this, I should never leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Camp, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can have this place cheap, if\r\nyou really want it. Or almost any other place in the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes one feel as if the\r\nfoundations of the great deep were giving way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that\r\nmeans exactly, but I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent to mislaying George\xe2\x80\x99s hatchet\r\nand going back on the Declaration generally; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear you\r\ntalk so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamp seemed to have lost his bitter mood, and he answered, pleasantly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Declaration is all right, as far as it goes, but it don\xe2\x80\x99t help us to\r\ncompete with the Western farm operations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you believe every one was born free and equal, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nMakely asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I believe that; but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you object to free and equal competition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed, and said, as he opened the door for us: \xe2\x80\x9cWalk\r\nright into the parlor, please. Mother will be ready for you in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI guess she\xe2\x80\x99s putting on her best cap for you, Mr. Homos. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na great event for her, your coming here. It is for all of us. We\xe2\x80\x99re glad\r\nto have you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, as simply as the other. He\r\nlooked about the best room of a farm-house that had never adapted itself\r\nto the tastes or needs of the city boarder, and was as stiffly repellent\r\nin its upholstery and as severe in its decoration as hair-cloth chairs and\r\ndark-brown wall-paper of a trellis pattern, with drab roses, could make\r\nit. The windows were shut tight, and our host did not offer to open them.\r\nA fly or two crossed the doorway into the hall, but made no attempt\r\nto penetrate the interior, where we sat in an obscurity that left the\r\nhigh-hung family photographs on the walls vague and uncertain. I made a\r\nmental note of it as a place where it would be very characteristic to have\r\na rustic funeral take place; and I was pleased to have Mrs. Makely drop\r\ninto a sort of mortuary murmur, as she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your mother is as\r\nwell as usual this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d I perceived that this murmur was produced by\r\nthe sepulchral influence of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp, and at that moment a door opened from the room across\r\nthe hall, and his sister seemed to bring in some of the light from it to\r\nus where we sat. She shook hands with Mrs. Makely, who introduced me to\r\nher, and then presented the Altrurian. She bowed very civilly to me, but\r\nwith a touch of severity, such as country people find necessary for the\r\nassertion of their self-respect with strangers. I thought it very pretty,\r\nand instantly saw that I could work it into some picture of character; and\r\nI was not at all sorry that she made a difference in favor of the\r\nAltrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother will be so glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, and, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\nright in?\xe2\x80\x9d she added to us all.\r\n\r\nWe followed her and found ourselves in a large, low, sunny room on\r\nthe southeast corner of the house, which had no doubt once been the\r\nliving-room, but which was now given up to the bedridden invalid; a door\r\nopened into the kitchen behind, where the table was already laid for the\r\nmidday meal, with the plates turned down in the country fashion, and some\r\nnetting drawn over the dishes to keep the flies away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely bustled up to the bedside with her energetic, patronizing\r\ncheerfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mrs. Camp, I am glad to see you looking so well this\r\nmorning. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to run over for several days past, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a moment till this morning, and I knew you didn\xe2\x80\x99t object to\r\nSunday visits.\xe2\x80\x9d She took the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers, and, with the air of\r\nshowing how little she felt any inequality between them, she leaned over\r\nand kissed her, where Mrs. Camp sat propped against her pillows. She had a\r\nlarge, nobly moulded face of rather masculine contour, and at the same\r\ntime the most motherly look in the world. Mrs. Makely bubbled and babbled\r\non, and every one waited patiently till she had done, and turned and said,\r\ntoward the Altrurian: \xe2\x80\x9cI have ventured to bring my friend, Mr. Homos, with\r\nme. He is from Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she turned to me and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Twelvemough\r\nyou know already through his delightful books\xe2\x80\x9d; but, although she paid me\r\nthis perfunctory compliment it was perfectly apparent to me that in the\r\nesteem of this disingenuous woman the distinguished stranger was a far\r\nmore important person than the distinguished author. Whether Mrs. Camp\r\nread my perception of this fact in my face or not I cannot say, but she\r\nwas evidently determined that I should not feel a difference in her. She\r\nheld out her hand to me first, and said that I never could know how many\r\nheavy hours I had helped to lighten for her, and then she turned to the\r\nAltrurian and took his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a long, deep-drawn sigh,\r\nas if that were the supreme moment of her life. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you really from\r\nAltruria? It seems too good to be true!\xe2\x80\x9d Her devout look and her earnest\r\ntone gave the commonplace words a quality that did not inhere in them, but\r\nMrs. Makely took them on their surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she made haste to interpose, before the Altrurian could\r\nsay anything. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is just the way we all feel about it, Mrs. Camp. I\r\nassure you, if it were not for the accounts in the papers and the talk\r\nabout it everywhere, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe there _was_ any such place as\r\nAltruria; and if it were not for Mr. Twelvemough here--who has to keep all\r\nhis inventions for his novels, as a mere matter of business routine--I\r\nmight really suspect him and Mr. Homos of--well, _working_ us, as my\r\nhusband calls it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian smiled politely, but vaguely, as if he had not quite caught\r\nher meaning, and I made answer for both: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure, Mrs. Makely, if you\r\ncould understand my peculiar state of mind about Mr. Homos, you would\r\nnever believe that I was in collusion with him. I find him quite as\r\nincredible as you do. There are moments when he seems so entirely\r\nsubjective with me that I feel as if he were no more definite or tangible\r\nthan a bad conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, and she laughed out her delight in my\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian must have perceived that we were joking, though the Camps\r\nall remained soberly silent. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad as that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough I have noticed that I seem to affect you all with a kind of\r\nmisgiving. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know just what it is; but, if I could remove it, I\r\nshould be very glad to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely very promptly seized her chance: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, in the first\r\nplace, my husband and I were talking it over last night after we left you,\r\nand that was one of the things that kept us awake; it turned into money\r\nafterward. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much that a whole continent, as big as Australia,\r\nremained undiscovered till within such a very few years, as it is the\r\ncondition of things among you: this sort of all living for one another,\r\nand not each one for himself. My husband says that is simply moonshine;\r\nsuch a thing never was and never can be; it is opposed to human nature,\r\nand would take away incentive and all motive for exertion and advancement\r\nand enterprise. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know _what_ he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say against it; but one\r\nthing, he says it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly un-American.\xe2\x80\x9d The Altrurian remained silent,\r\ngravely smiling, and Mrs. Makely added, with her most engaging little\r\nmanner: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel hurt, personally or patriotically, by what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated to you. I know my husband is awfully Philistine, though he\r\n_is_ such a good fellow, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t, by any means, agree with him on all\r\nthose points; but I _would_ like to know what you think of them. The\r\ntrouble is, Mrs. Camp,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to the invalid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Homos\r\nis so dreadfully reticent about his own country, and I am so curious to\r\nhear of it at first hands, that I consider it justifiable to use any means\r\nto make him open up about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no offence,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian answered for himself, \xe2\x80\x9cin what Mr.\r\nMakely says, though, from the Altrurian point of view, there is a good\r\ndeal of error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it seem so strange to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, addressing himself to Mrs.\r\nCamp, \xe2\x80\x9cthat people should found a civilization on the idea of living for\r\none another instead of each for himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor people have always had to live that way,\r\nor they could not have lived at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what I understood your porter to say last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAltrurian to me. He added, to the company generally: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that even\r\nin America there are more poor people than there are rich people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there are more people\r\nindependently rich than there are people independently poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will let that formulation of it stand. If it is true, I do not see why\r\nthe Altrurian system should be considered so very un-American. Then, as to\r\nwhether there is or ever was really a practical altruism, a civic\r\nexpression of it, I think it cannot be denied that among the first\r\nChristians, those who immediately followed Christ, and might be supposed\r\nto be directly influenced by His life, there was an altruism practised as\r\nradical as that which we have organized into a national polity and a\r\nworking economy in Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with the air of advancing a point\r\nnot to be put aside, \xe2\x80\x9cthey had to drop _that_. It was a dead failure. They\r\nfound that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it go at all among cultivated people, and\r\nthat, if Christianity was to advance, they would have to give up all that\r\ncrankish kind of idolatry of the mere letter. At any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\r\nwith the satisfaction we all feel in getting an opponent into close\r\nquarters, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must confess that there is a much greater play of\r\nindividuality here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the Altrurian could reply, young Camp said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to see\r\nAmerican individuality, the real, simon-pure article, you ought to go down\r\nto one of our big factory towns and look at the mill-hands coming home in\r\ndroves after a day\xe2\x80\x99s work, young girls and old women, boys and men, all\r\nfluffed over with cotton, and so dead tired that they can hardly walk.\r\nThey come shambling along with all the individuality of a flock of sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, heroically, as if she were one of these, \xe2\x80\x9cmust\r\nbe sacrificed. Of course, some are not so individual as others. A great\r\ndeal depends upon temperament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal more depends upon capital,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp, with an offensive\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have capital in America, you can have individuality; if you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t, you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister, who had not taken part in the talk before, said, demurely: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems to me you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good deal of individuality, Reub, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot a great deal of capital, either,\xe2\x80\x9d and the two young people laughed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely was one of those fatuous women whose eagerness to make a point\r\nexcludes the consideration even of their own advantage. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, as if speaking for the upper classes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any\r\nindividuality at all. We are as like as so many peas or pins. In fact, you\r\nhave to be so in society. If you keep asserting your own individuality too\r\nmuch, people avoid you. It\xe2\x80\x99s very vulgar and the greatest bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t find individuality so desirable, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAltrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly detest it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady, and evidently she had not the\r\nleast notion where she was in the argument. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I\xe2\x80\x99m never happy\r\nexcept when I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten myself and the whole individual bother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer declaration seemed somehow to close the incident, and we were all\r\nsilent a moment, which I employed in looking about the room, and taking in\r\nwith my literary sense the simplicity and even bareness of its furnishing.\r\nThere was the bed where the invalid lay, and near the head a table with a\r\npile of books and a kerosene-lamp on it, and I decided that she was a good\r\ndeal wakeful, and that she read by that lamp when she could not sleep at\r\nnight. Then there were the hard chairs we sat on, and some home-made\r\nhooked rugs, in rounds and ovals, scattered about the clean floor; there\r\nwas a small melodeon pushed against the wall; the windows had paper\r\nshades, and I recalled that I had not seen any blinds on the outside of\r\nthe house. Over the head of the bed hung a cavalryman\xe2\x80\x99s sword, with its\r\nbelt--the sword that Mrs. Makely had spoken of. It struck me as a room\r\nwhere a great many things might have happened, and I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink, Mrs. Camp, how glad I am to see the inside of your house. It seems\r\nto me so typical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pleased intelligence showed itself in her face, and she answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nit is a real old-fashioned farmhouse. We have never taken boarders, and so\r\nwe have kept it as it was built pretty much, and only made such changes in\r\nit as we needed or wanted for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, following up what I thought a fortunate lead,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat we city people see so little of the farming life when we come into\r\nthe country. I have been here now for several seasons, and this is the\r\nfirst time I have been inside a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Altrurian, with an air of utter astonishment;\r\nand, when I found the fact appeared so singular to him, I began to be\r\nrather proud of its singularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose that most city people come and go, year after year, in the\r\ncountry, and never make any sort of acquaintance with the people who live\r\nthere the year round. We keep to ourselves in the hotels, or, if we go out\r\nat all, it is to make a call upon some city cottager, and so we do not get\r\nout of the vicious circle of our own over-intimacy with ourselves and our\r\nignorance of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you regard that as a great misfortune?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable. There is nothing to bring us together, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsome happy accident, like the present. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a traveler from\r\nAltruria to exploit every day, and so we have no business to come into\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have been welcome in ours long ago, Mr. Twelvemough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nCamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you say really seems dreadful\r\nto me. Why, it is as if you were not the same race or kind of men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has sometimes seemed to me as if our big hotel\r\nthere were a ship anchored off some strange coast. The inhabitants come\r\nout with supplies, and carry on their barter with the ship\xe2\x80\x99s steward, and\r\nwe sometimes see them over the side, but we never speak to them or have\r\nanything to do with them. We sail away at the close of the season, and\r\nthat is the end of it till next summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian turned to Mrs. Camp. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you look at it? How does it\r\nseem to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have thought about it very much; but, now that Mr.\r\nTwelvemough has spoken of it, I can see that it does look that way. And it\r\nseems very strange, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, for we are all the same people, and have\r\nthe same language and religion and country--the country that my husband\r\nfought for and, I suppose I may say, died for; he was never the same man\r\nafter the war. It does appear as if we had some interests in common, and\r\nmight find it out if we ever came together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great advantage, the city people going into the country so much as\r\nthey do now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cThey bring five million dollars into the\r\nState of New Hampshire, alone, every summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked round for the general approval which this fact merited, and\r\nyoung Camp said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it shows how worthless the natives are, that they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make both ends meet, with all that money, but have to give up their\r\nfarms and go West, after all. I suppose you think it comes from wanting\r\nbuggies and pianos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it certainly comes from something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with the\r\ncourage of her convictions.\r\n\r\nShe was evidently not going to be put down by that sour young fellow, and\r\nI was glad of it, though I must say I thought the thing she left to rankle\r\nin his mind from our former meeting had not been said in very good taste.\r\nI thought, too, that she would not fare best in any encounter of wits with\r\nhim, and I rather trembled for the result. I said, to relieve the strained\r\nsituation: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish there was some way of our knowing each other better.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of good-will on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp, \xe2\x80\x9cor at least I can answer for our side that\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t. You come into the country to get as much for your money as\r\nyou can, and we mean to let you have as little as we can. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole\r\nstory, and if Mr. Homos believes anything different, he\xe2\x80\x99s very much\r\nmistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t formed any conclusion in regard to the matter, which is quite\r\nnew to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why is there no basis of\r\nmutual kindness between you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s like everything else with us; it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of supply and\r\ndemand, and there is no room for any mutual kindness in a question of that\r\nkind. Even if there were, there is another thing that would kill it. The\r\nsummer folks, as we call them, look down on the natives, as they call us,\r\nand we know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Camp, I am sure that you cannot say _I_ look down on the\r\nnatives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with an air of argument.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, you do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not unamiably, and he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the right to. We\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to associate with you,\r\nand you know it, and we know it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got more money, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nnicer clothes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got prettier manners. You talk about things that\r\nmost natives never heard of, and you care for things they never saw. I\r\nknow it\xe2\x80\x99s the custom to pretend differently, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pretend\r\ndifferently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI recalled what my friend the banker said about throwing away cant, and I\r\nasked myself if I were in the presence of some such free spirit again. I\r\ndid not see how young Camp could afford it; but then I reflected that he\r\nhad really nothing to lose by it, for he did not expect to make anything\r\nout of us; Mrs. Makely would probably not give up his sister as seamstress\r\nif the girl continued to work so well and so cheaply as she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat some old native took you at your word, and\r\ncame to call upon you at the hotel, with his wife, just as one of the city\r\ncottagers would do if he wanted to make your acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be perfectly delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should receive\r\nthem with the greatest possible cordiality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same kind of cordiality that you would show to the cottagers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that I should feel that I had more in common with the\r\ncottagers. We should be interested in the same things, and we should\r\nprobably know the same people and have more to talk about--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would both belong to the same class, and that tells the whole story.\r\nIf you were out West, and the owner of one of those big twenty-thousand-acre\r\nfarms called on you with his wife, would you act toward them as you\r\nwould toward our natives? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You would all be rich people\r\ntogether, and you would understand one another because you had money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that is not so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty of rich\r\npeople one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to know at all, and who really can\xe2\x80\x99t get into\r\nsociety--who are ignorant and vulgar. And then, when you come to money, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see but what country people are as glad to get it as anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, gladder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Makely, as if this were a final stroke of logic. The\r\nyoung man did not reply, and Mrs. Makely continued: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I will appeal to\r\nyour sister to say whether she has ever seen any difference in my manner\r\ntoward her from what I show to all the young ladies in the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nyoung girl flushed and seemed reluctant to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMrs. Makely, and her tone showed that she was really hurt.\r\n\r\nThe scene appeared to me rather cruel, and I glanced at Mrs. Camp with an\r\nexpectation that she would say something to relieve it. But she did not.\r\nHer large, benevolent face expressed only a quiet interest in the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t regard me as\r\nyou do the young ladies in the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no resentment in her voice or look, but only a sort of regret,\r\nas if, but for this grievance, she could have loved the woman from whom\r\nshe had probably had much kindness. The tears came into Mrs. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, and she turned toward Mrs. Camp. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is this the way you _all_ feel\r\ntoward us?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the invalid, in her turn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, no, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nway all the country people feel. Many of them feel as you would like to\r\nhave them feel; but that is because they do not think. When they think,\r\nthey feel as we do. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourselves any\r\nmore than we can. We\xe2\x80\x99re all bound up together in that, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this apparent relenting Mrs. Makely tricked her beams a little, and\r\nsaid, plaintively, as if offering herself for further condolence: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nthat is what that woman at the little shanty back there said: some have to\r\nbe rich, and some have to be poor; it takes all kinds to make a world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would you like to be one of those that have to be poor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked young\r\nCamp, with an evil grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with unexpected spirit; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am sure\r\nthat I should respect the feelings of all, rich or poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry if we have hurt yours, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Camp, with\r\ndignity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked us certain questions, and we thought you wished us to\r\nreply truthfully. We could not answer you with smooth things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut sometimes you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, and the tears stood in her eyes\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know how fond I am of you all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Camp wore a bewildered look. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we have said more than we\r\nought. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how the children could,\r\nwhen you asked them here, before Mr. Homos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI glanced at the Altrurian, sitting attentive and silent, and a sudden\r\nmisgiving crossed my mind concerning him. Was he really a man, a human\r\nentity, a personality like ourselves, or was he merely a sort of spiritual\r\nsolvent, sent for the moment to precipitate whatever sincerity there was\r\nin us, and show us what the truth was concerning our relations to one\r\nanother? It was a fantastic conception, but I thought it was one that I\r\nmight employ in some sort of purely romantic design, and I was\r\nprofessionally grateful for it. I said, with a humorous gayety: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\r\nall seem to have been compelled to be much more honest than we like; and\r\nif Mr. Homos is going to write an account of his travels when he gets\r\nhome, he can\xe2\x80\x99t accuse us of hypocrisy, at any rate. And I always used to\r\nthink it was one of our virtues! What with Mr. Camp, here, and my friend\r\nthe banker at the hotel, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have much reason to complain\r\neven of our reticence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever he says of us,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Makely, with a pious glance at\r\nthe sword over the bed, \xe2\x80\x9che will have to say that, in spite of our\r\ndivisions and classes, we are all Americans, and, if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t the same\r\nopinions and ideas on minor matters, we all have the same country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d came from Reuben Camp, with shocking\r\npromptness. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we all have the same country. America is one\r\nthing for you, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing for us. America means ease and\r\ncomfort and amusement for you, year in and year out, and if it means work,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s work that you _wish_ to do. For us, America means work that we _have_\r\nto do, and hard work all the time if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make both ends meet.\r\nIt means liberty for you; but what liberty has a man got who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere his next meal is coming from? Once I was in a strike, when I was\r\nworking on the railroad, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen men come and give up their liberty\r\nfor a chance to earn their family\xe2\x80\x99s living. They knew they were right, and\r\nthat they ought to have stood up for their rights; but they had to lie\r\ndown and lick the hand that fed them. Yes, we are all Americans, but I\r\nguess we haven\xe2\x80\x99t all got the same country, Mrs. Makely. What sort of a\r\ncountry has a blacklisted man got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA blacklisted man?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a kind of man I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the mill towns, that the bosses have all\r\ngot on their books as a man that isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be given work on any account;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s to be punished with hunger and cold, and turned into the street,\r\nfor having offended them; and that\xe2\x80\x99s to be made to suffer through his\r\nhelpless family for having offended them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Mr. Camp,\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut isn\xe2\x80\x99t a blacklisted man usually\r\na man who has made himself prominent in some labor trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the young fellow answered, without seeming sensible of the point I\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you can hardly blame the employers for taking it\r\nout of him in any way they can. That\xe2\x80\x99s human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that in America\r\nit is human nature to take away the bread of a man\xe2\x80\x99s family because he has\r\ngone counter to your interest or pleasure on some economical question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Twelvemough seems to think so,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhether it\xe2\x80\x99s human nature or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that they do it, and you can\r\nguess how much a blacklisted man must love the country where such a thing\r\ncan happen to him. What should you call such a thing as blacklisting in\r\nAltruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cdo let us get him to talking about\r\nAltruria on any terms. I think all this about the labor question is so\r\ntiresome; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mrs. Camp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Camp did not answer; but the Altrurian said, in reply to her son: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nshould have no name for such a thing, for with us such a thing would be\r\nimpossible. There is no crime so heinous with us that the punishment would\r\ntake away the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s chance of earning his living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he was a criminal,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Camp, \xe2\x80\x9che would be all right\r\n_here_. The state would give him a chance to earn his living then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he had no other chance of earning his living, and had committed no\r\noffence against the laws--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the state would let him take to the road--like that fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled aside the shade of the window where he sat, and we saw pausing\r\nbefore the house, and glancing doubtfully at the doorstep, where the dog\r\nlay, a vile and loathsome-looking tramp, a blot upon the sweet and\r\nwholesome landscape, a scandal to the sacred day. His rags burlesqued the\r\nform which they did not wholly hide; his broken shoes were covered with\r\ndust; his coarse hair came in a plume through his tattered hat; his red,\r\nsodden face, at once fierce and timid, was rusty with a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s beard.\r\nHe offended the eye like a visible stench, and the wretched carrion seemed\r\nto shrink away from our gaze as if he were aware of his loathsomeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought those fellows were arrested now. It\r\nis too bad to leave them at large. They are dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d Young Camp left\r\nthe room, and we saw him going out toward the tramp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Reuben is going to send\r\nhim about his business. Why, surely, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to feed the horrid\r\ncreature!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as Camp, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s parley with the tramp,\r\nturned with him and disappeared round a corner of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mrs.\r\nCamp, I think that is really a very bad example. It\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging them.\r\nVery likely he\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep in your barn, and set it on fire with his\r\npipe. What do you do with tramps in Altruria, Mr. Homos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian seemed not to have heard her. He said to Mrs. Camp: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\r\nunderstand from something your son let fall that he has not always been at\r\nhome with you here. Does he reconcile himself easily to the country after\r\nthe excitement of town life? I have read that the cities in America are\r\ndraining the country of the young people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was sorry to come home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, with a touch\r\nof fond pride. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was no choice for him after his father died; he\r\nwas always a good boy, and he has not made us feel that we were keeping\r\nhim away from anything better. When his father was alive we let him go,\r\nbecause then we were not so dependent, and I wished him to try his fortune\r\nin the world, as all boys long to do. But he is rather peculiar, and he\r\nseems to have got quite enough of the world. To be sure, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s seen the brightest side of it. He first went to work in the mills\r\ndown at Ponkwasset, but he was \xe2\x80\x98laid off\xe2\x80\x99 there when the hard times came\r\nand there was so much overproduction, and he took a job of railroading,\r\nand was braking on a freight-train when his father left us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely said, smiling: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the brightest\r\noutlook in the world. No wonder he has brought back such gloomy\r\nimpressions. I am sure that if he could have seen life under brighter\r\nauspices he would not have the ideas he has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cOur experiences have a great deal\r\nto do with forming our opinions. But I am not dissatisfied with my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nideas. I suppose Reuben got a good many of his ideas from his father: he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis father all over again. My husband thought slavery was wrong, and he\r\nwent into the war to fight against it. He used to say when the war was\r\nover that the negroes were emancipated, but slavery was not abolished\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world did he mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Makely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand as we do. I tried to carry on the farm\r\nafter he first went, and before Reuben was large enough to help me much\r\nand ought to be in school, and I suppose I overdid. At any rate, that was\r\nwhen I had my first shock of paralysis. I never was very strong, and I\r\npresume my health was weakened by my teaching school so much, and\r\nstudying, before I was married. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor many a year. The place was clear of debt then, but I had to get a\r\nmortgage put on it. The savings-bank down in the village took it, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying the interest ever since. My husband died paying it, and\r\nmy son will pay it all my life, and then I suppose the bank will\r\nforeclose. The treasurer was an old playmate of my husband\xe2\x80\x99s, and he said\r\nthat as long as either of us lived the mortgage could lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow splendid of him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you had been very\r\nfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said that you would not see it as we do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid, patiently.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAre there mortgages on many of the farms in the\r\nneighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Camp. \xe2\x80\x9cWe seem to own them, but in fact they own\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely hastened to say: \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to have\r\nyour property. If you mortgage it close up, you have all your capital\r\nfree, and you can keep turning it over. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you ought to do, Mrs.\r\nCamp. But what was the slavery that Captain Camp said was not abolished\r\nyet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invalid looked at her a moment without replying, and just then the\r\ndoor of the kitchen opened, and Young Camp came in and began to gather\r\nsome food from the table on a plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you bring him to the table, Reub?\xe2\x80\x9d his sister called to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he says he\xe2\x80\x99d rather not come in, as long as we have company. He says\r\nhe isn\xe2\x80\x99t dressed for dinner; left his spike-tail in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed, and his sister with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Camp carried out the plate of victuals to the tramp, and Mrs. Makely\r\nsaid to his mother: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you would make the tramp do some sort of\r\nwork to earn his breakfast on week-days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Camp replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDo the boarders at the hotel always work\r\nto earn their breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with the sharpness of offence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthey always pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that paying for a thing is earning it. Perhaps some one\r\nelse earned the money that pays for it. But I believe there is too much\r\nwork in the world. If I were to live my life over again, I should not work\r\nhalf so hard. My husband and I took this place when we were young married\r\npeople, and began working to pay for it. We wanted to feel that it was\r\nours, that we owned it, and that our children should own it afterward. We\r\nboth worked all day long like slaves, and many a moonlight night we were\r\nup till morning, almost, gathering the stones from our fields and burying\r\nthem in deep graves that we had dug for them. But we buried our youth and\r\nstrength and health in those graves, too, and what for? I don\xe2\x80\x99t own the\r\nfarm that we worked so hard to pay for, and my children won\xe2\x80\x99t. That is\r\nwhat it has all come to. We were rightly punished for our greed, I\r\nsuppose. Perhaps no one has a right to own any portion of the earth.\r\nSometimes I think so, but my husband and I earned this farm, and now the\r\nsavings-bank owns it. That seems strange, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll say\r\nthat the bank paid for it. Well, perhaps so; but the bank didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn it.\r\nWhen I think of that I don\xe2\x80\x99t always think that a person who pays for his\r\nbreakfast has the best right to a breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see the sophistry of all this, but I had not the heart to point it\r\nout; I felt the pathos of it, too. Mrs. Makely seemed not to see the one\r\nnor to feel the other very distinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but surely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou give a tramp his breakfast without making him work for it, you must\r\nsee that it is encouraging idleness. And idleness is very corrupting--the\r\nsight of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to the country people? Well, they have to stand a good deal of\r\nthat. The summer folks that spend four or five months of the year here\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem to do anything from morning till night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you must recollect that they are _resting_! You have no idea how\r\nhard they all work in town during the winter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely urged, with an\r\nair of argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the tramps are resting, too. At any rate, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the sight\r\nof idleness in rags, and begging at back doors, is very corrupting to the\r\ncountry people; I never heard of a single tramp who had started from the\r\ncountry; they all come from the cities. It\xe2\x80\x99s the other kind of idleness\r\nthat tempts our young people. The only tramps that my son says he ever\r\nenvies are the well-dressed, strong young fellows from town that go\r\ntramping through the mountains for exercise every summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ladies both paused. They seemed to have got to the end of their\r\ntether; at least, Mrs. Makely had apparently nothing else to advance, and\r\nI said, lightly: \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is just the kind of tramps that Mr. Homos would\r\nmost disapprove of. He says that in Altruria they would consider exercise\r\nfor exercise\xe2\x80\x99 sake a wicked waste of force and little short of lunacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought my exaggeration might provoke him to denial, but he seemed not\r\nto have found it unjust. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Camp, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nAltruria every one works with his hands, so that the hard work shall not\r\nall fall to any one class; and this manual labor of each is sufficient to\r\nkeep the body in health, as well as to earn a living. After the three,\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 work, which constitutes a day\xe2\x80\x99s work with us, is done, the young\r\npeople have all sorts of games and sports, and they carry them as late\r\ninto life as the temperament of each demands. But what I was saying to Mr.\r\nTwelvemough--perhaps I did not make myself clear--was that we should\r\nregard the sterile putting forth of strength in exercise, if others were\r\neach day worn out with hard manual labor, as insane or immoral. But I can\r\naccount for it differently with you, because I understand that in your\r\nconditions a person of leisure could not do any manual labor without\r\ntaking away the work of some one who needed it to live by; and could not\r\neven relieve an overworked laborer, and give him the money for the work,\r\nwithout teaching him habits of idleness. In Altruria we can all keep\r\nourselves well by doing each his share of hard work, and we can help those\r\nwho are exhausted, when such a thing happens, without injuring them\r\nmaterially or morally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Camp entered at this moment, and the Altrurian hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do go\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely entreated. She added to Camp: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got him to talking\r\nabout Altruria at last, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him stopped for worlds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian looked around at all our faces, and no doubt read our eager\r\ncuriosity in them. He smiled and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\r\nBut I do not think you will find anything so remarkable in our\r\ncivilization, if you will conceive of it as the outgrowth of the\r\nneighborly instinct. In fact, neighborliness is the essence of\r\nAltrurianism. If you will imagine having the same feeling toward all,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained to Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cas you have toward your next-door neighbor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy next-door neighbor!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_ the people next\r\ndoor! We live in a large apartment house, some forty families, and I\r\nassure you I do not know a soul among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a puzzled air, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it\r\n_does_ seem rather hard. One day the people on the same landing with us\r\nlost one of their children, and I should never have been a whit the wiser\r\nif my cook hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened to mention it. The servants all know each\r\nother; they meet in the back elevator, and get acquainted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nencourage it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what kind of families they belong to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have friends in the city whom\r\nyou think of as your neighbors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cI have my visiting-list,\r\nbut I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anybody on _that_ as a neighbor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian looked so blank and baffled that I could hardly help\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I should not know how to explain Altruria to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s anything like neighborliness as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in small places, deliver me from it! I like being\r\nindependent. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I like the city. You\xe2\x80\x99re let alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was down in New York once, and I went through some of the streets and\r\nhouses where the poor people live,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Camp, \xe2\x80\x9cand they seemed to\r\nknow each other and to be quite neighborly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you like to be all messed in with one another that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n demanded the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought it was better than living as we do in the country, so far\r\napart that we never see one another, hardly. And it seems to me better\r\nthan not having any neighbors at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, every one to his taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell\r\nus how people manage with you socially, Mr. Homos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have neither city nor country in your\r\nsense, and so we are neither so isolated nor so crowded together. You feel\r\nthat you lose a great deal in not seeing one another oftener?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nCamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Folks rust out living alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s Human nature to want to get\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I understand Mrs. Makely that it is human nature to want to keep\r\napart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, but to come together independently,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is what we have contrived in our life at home. I should have\r\nto say, in the first place, that--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me just one moment, Mr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely. This perverse\r\nwoman was as anxious to hear about Altruria as any of us, but she was a\r\nwoman who would rather hear the sound of her own voice than any other,\r\neven if she were dying, as she would call it, to hear the other. The\r\nAltrurian stopped politely, and Mrs. Makely went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking\r\nof what Mr. Camp was saying about the blacklisted men, and their all\r\nturning into tramps--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d the young fellow protested, in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it stands to reason that if the tramps have all been blacklisted\r\nmen--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter! What I am trying to get at is this: if a workman has made\r\nhimself a nuisance to the employers, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they a right to punish him in\r\nany way they can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe there\xe2\x80\x99s no law yet against blacklisting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to complain of. The\r\nemployers surely know their own business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey claim to know the men\xe2\x80\x99s, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re always saying;\r\nthey will manage their own affairs in their own way. But no man, or\r\ncompany, that does business on a large scale has any affairs that are not\r\npartly other folks\xe2\x80\x99 affairs, too. All the saying in the world won\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nit different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with a force of argument which she\r\nseemed to think was irresistible, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the workmen had better leave\r\nthings to the employers, and then they won\xe2\x80\x99t get blacklisted. It\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nbroad as it\xe2\x80\x99s long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess that, although I agreed with Mrs. Makely in regard to what the\r\nworkmen had better do, her position had been arrived at by such\r\nextraordinary reasoning that I blushed for her; at the same time, I wanted\r\nto laugh. She continued, triumphantly: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the employers have ever\r\nso much more at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen men have everything at stake--the work of their hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set that against\r\ncapital? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t compare the two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp, and I could see his eye kindle and his jaw\r\nstiffen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose you would say that a man ought to get as much for his work\r\nas an employer gets for his capital. If you think one has as much at stake\r\nas the other, you must think they ought to be paid alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is _just_ what I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp, and Mrs. Makely burst into a\r\npeal of amiable laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that is too preposterous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it preposterous?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, with a quivering nostril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, simply because it _is_\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, but she did not say why, and\r\nalthough I thought so, too, I was glad she did not attempt to do it, for\r\nher conclusions seemed to me much better than her reasons.\r\n\r\nThe old wooden clock in the kitchen began to strike, and she rose briskly\r\nto her feet and went and laid the books she had been holding in her lap on\r\nthe table beside Mrs. Camp\xe2\x80\x99s bed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must really be going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as\r\nshe leaned over and kissed the invalid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your dinner-time, and we\r\nshall barely get back for lunch if we go by the Loop road; and I want very\r\nmuch to have Mr. Homos see the Witch\xe2\x80\x99s Falls on the way. I have got two or\r\nthree of the books here that Mr. Makely brought me last night--I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave time to read them at once--and I\xe2\x80\x99m smuggling in one of Mr.\r\nTwelvemough\xe2\x80\x99s, that he\xe2\x80\x99s too modest to present for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned a\r\ngay glance upon me, and Mrs. Camp thanked me, and a number of civilities\r\nfollowed from all sides. In the process of their exchange, Mrs. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits perceptibly rose, and she came away in high good-humor with the\r\nwhole Camp family. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the Altrurian, as\r\nwe began the long ascent of the Loop road, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must allow that you have\r\nseen some very original characters. But how _warped_ people get living\r\nalone so much! That is the great drawback of the country. Mrs. Camp thinks\r\nthe savings-bank did her a real injury in taking a mortgage on her place,\r\nand Reuben seems to have seen just enough of the outside world to get it\r\nall wrong. But they are the best-hearted creatures in the world, and I\r\nknow you won\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand them. That unsparing country bluntness--don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly delightful? I do like to stir poor Reuben up, and\r\nget him talking. He is a good boy, if he _is_ so wrong-headed, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe most devoted son and brother in the world. Very few young fellows\r\nwould waste their lives on an old farm like that; I suppose, when his\r\nmother dies, he will marry and strike out for himself in some growing\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not seem to think the world held out any very bright inducements\r\nfor him to leave home,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let him get one of these lively, pushing Yankee girls for a wife, and\r\nhe will think very differently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian disappeared that afternoon, and I saw little or nothing of\r\nhim till the next day at supper. Then he said he had been spending the\r\ntime with young Camp, who had shown him something of the farm-work, and\r\nintroduced him to several of the neighbors; he was very much interested in\r\nit all, because at home he was, at present, engaged in farm-work himself,\r\nand he was curious to contrast the American and Altrurian methods. We\r\nbegan to talk of the farming interest again, later in the day, when the\r\nmembers of our little group came together, and I told them what the\r\nAltrurian had been doing. The doctor had been suddenly called back to\r\ntown; but the minister was there, and the lawyer and the professor and the\r\nbanker and the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIt was the banker who began to comment on what I said, and he seemed to be\r\nin the frank humor of the Saturday night before. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhard life, and they have to look sharp if they expect to make both ends\r\nmeet. I would not like to undertake it myself with their resources.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professor smiled, in asking the Altrurian: \xe2\x80\x9cDid your agricultural\r\nfriends tell you anything of the little rural traffic in votes that they\r\ncarry on about election time? That is one of the side means they have of\r\nmaking both ends meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know, you can buy votes among our virtuous yeomen from two\r\ndollars up at the ordinary elections. When party feeling runs high, and\r\nthere are vital questions at stake, the votes cost more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian looked round at us all aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, you mean that Americans\r\nbuy votes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professor smiled again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no; I only mean that they sell them. Well,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder that they rather prefer to blink the fact; but it is a\r\nfact, nevertheless, and pretty notorious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what defence have they for such\r\ntreason? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean those who sell; from what I have seen of the\r\nbareness and hardship of their lives, I could well imagine that there\r\nmight sometimes come a pinch when they would be glad of the few dollars\r\nthat they could get in that way; but what have those who buy to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t a transaction that\xe2\x80\x99s apt to be\r\ntalked about much on either side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is some exaggeration about\r\nthat business; but it certainly exists, and I suppose it is a growing evil\r\nin the country. I fancy it arises, somewhat, from a want of, clear\r\nthinking on the subject. Then there is no doubt but it comes, sometimes,\r\nfrom poverty. A man sells his vote, as a woman sells her person, for\r\nmoney, when neither can turn virtue into cash. They feel that they must\r\nlive, and neither of them would be satisfied if Dr. Johnson told them he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see the necessity. In fact, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t myself, if I were in their\r\nplaces. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have the good of a civilization like ours without having\r\nthe bad; but I am not going to deny that the bad is bad. Some people like\r\nto do that; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t find my account in it. In either case, I confess\r\nthat I think the buyer is worse than the seller--incomparably worse. I\r\nsuppose you are not troubled with either case in Altruria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, with an utter horror, which no repetition of\r\nhis words can give the sense of. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be unimaginable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have cakes and ale, and at times the\r\nginger is hot in the mouth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that we have immunity from error; but upon such terms as\r\nyou have described we have none. It would be impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s voice expressed no contempt, but only a sad patience, a\r\nmelancholy surprise, such as a celestial angel might feel in being\r\nsuddenly confronted with some secret shame and horror of the Pit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cwith us the only way is to take the business\r\nview and try to strike an average somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, turning to the manufacturer,\r\nwho had been quietly smoking, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t some of you capitalists take hold\r\nof farming here in the East, and make a business of it as they do in the\r\nWest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; \xe2\x80\x9cif you mean me, I would rather not invest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He was silent a moment, and then he went on, as if the notion were\r\nbeginning to win upon him: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may come to something like that, though. If\r\nit does, the natural course, I should think, would be through the\r\nrailroads. It would be a very easy matter for them to buy up all the good\r\nfarms along their lines and put tenants on them, and run them in their own\r\ninterest. Really, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad scheme. The waste in the present method\r\nis enormous, and there is no reason why the roads should not own the\r\nfarms, as they are beginning to own the mines. They could manage them\r\nbetter than the small farmers do in every way. I wonder the thing hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noccurred to some smart railroad man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed a little, perceiving the semi-ironical spirit of his talk;\r\nbut the Altrurian must have taken it in dead earnest: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, in that case,\r\nthe number of people thrown out of work would be very great, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nAnd what would become of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they would have whatever their farms brought to make a new start\r\nwith somewhere else; and, besides, that question of what would become of\r\npeople thrown out of work by a given improvement is something that capital\r\ncannot consider. We used to introduce a bit of machinery in the mill,\r\nevery now and then, that threw out a dozen or a hundred people; but we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you never knew what became of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes. Generally not. We took it for granted that they would light on\r\ntheir feet somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the state--the whole people--the government--did nothing for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it became a question of the poor-house, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the jail,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking of the poor-house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cdid our exemplary rural\r\nfriends tell you how they sell out their paupers to the lowest bidder, and\r\nget them boarded sometimes as low as a dollar and a quarter a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, young Mr. Camp told me of that. He seemed to think it was terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear that of young Mr. Camp. From all that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen told before, he seems to reserve his conscience for the use of\r\ncapitalists. What does he propose to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to think the state ought to find work for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, paternalism! Well, I guess the state won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was his opinion, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a hard fate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the only provision the\r\nlaw makes for people who are worn out by sickness or a life of work should\r\nbe something that assorts them with idiots and lunatics, and brings such\r\nshame upon them that it is almost as terrible as death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only way to encourage independence and individuality,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nprofessor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it has its dark side. But anything else would be\r\nsentimental and unbusinesslike, and, in fact, un-American.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure that it would be un-Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister timidly\r\nventured, in the face of such an authority on political economy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, I must leave the question to the reverend clergy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe professor.\r\n\r\nA very unpleasant little silence followed. It was broken by the lawyer,\r\nwho put his feet together, and, after a glance down at them, began to say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much interested this afternoon by a conversation I had with\r\nsome of the young fellows in the hotel. You know most of them are\r\ngraduates, and they are taking a sort of supernumerary vacation this\r\nsummer before they plunge into the battle of life in the autumn. They were\r\ntalking of some other fellows, classmates of theirs, who were not so\r\nlucky, but had been obliged to begin the fight at once. It seems that our\r\nfellows here are all going in for some sort of profession: medicine or law\r\nor engineering or teaching or the church, and they were commiserating\r\nthose other fellows not only because they were not having the\r\nsupernumerary vacation, but because they were going into business. That\r\nstruck me as rather odd, and I tried to find out what it meant, and, as\r\nnearly as I could find out, it meant that most college graduates would not\r\ngo into business if they could help it. They seemed to feel a sort of\r\nincongruity between their education and the business life. They pitied the\r\nfellows that had to go in for it, and apparently the fellows that had to\r\ngo in for it pitied themselves, for the talk seemed to have begun about a\r\nletter that one of the chaps here had got from poor Jack or Jim somebody,\r\nwho had been obliged to go into his father\xe2\x80\x99s business, and was groaning\r\nover it. The fellows who were going to study professions were hugging\r\nthemselves at the contrast between their fate and his, and were making\r\nremarks about business that were, to say the least, unbusinesslike. A few\r\nyears ago we should have made a summary disposition of the matter, and I\r\nbelieve some of the newspapers still are in doubt about the value of a\r\ncollege education to men who have got to make their way. What do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer addressed his question to the manufacturer, who answered, with\r\na comfortable satisfaction, that he did not think those young men if they\r\nwent into business would find that they knew too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they pointed out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the great American fortunes\r\nhad been made by men who had never had their educational advantages, and\r\nthey seemed to think that what we call the education of a gentleman was a\r\nlittle too good for money-making purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthey can console themselves with the reflection\r\nthat going into business isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily making money; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnecessarily making a living, even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them seem to have caught on to that fact; and they pitied Jack or\r\nJim partly because the chances were so much against him. But they pitied\r\nhim mostly because in the life before him he would have no use for his\r\nacademic training, and he had better not gone to college at all. They said\r\nhe would be none the better for it, and would always be miserable when he\r\nlooked back to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer did not reply, and the professor, after a preliminary\r\nhemming, held his peace. It was the banker who took the word: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so\r\nfar as business is concerned, they were right. It is no use to pretend\r\nthat there is any relation between business and the higher education.\r\nThere is no business man who will pretend that there is not often an\r\nactual incompatibility if he is honest. I know that when we get together\r\nat a commercial or financial dinner we talk as if great merchants and\r\ngreat financiers were beneficent geniuses, who evoked the prosperity of\r\nmankind by their schemes from the conditions that would otherwise have\r\nremained barren. Well, very likely they are, but we must all confess that\r\nthey do not know it at the time. What they are consciously looking out for\r\nthen is the main chance. If general prosperity follows, all well and good;\r\nthey are willing to be given the credit for it. But, as I said, with\r\nbusiness as business, the \xe2\x80\x98education of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99 has nothing to do.\r\nThat education is always putting the old Ciceronian question: whether the\r\nfellow arriving at a starving city with a cargo of grain is bound to tell\r\nthe people before he squeezes them that there are half a dozen other\r\nfellows with grain just below the horizon. As a gentleman he would have to\r\ntell them, because he could not take advantage of their necessities; but,\r\nas a business man, he would think it bad business to tell them, or no\r\nbusiness at all. The principle goes all through; I say, business is\r\nbusiness; and I am not going to pretend that business will ever be\r\nanything else. In our business battles we don\xe2\x80\x99t take off our hats to the\r\nother side and say, \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen of the French Guard, have the goodness to\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x99 That may be war, but it is not business. We seize all the\r\nadvantages we can; very few of us would actually deceive; but if a fellow\r\nbelieves a thing, and we know he is wrong, we do not usually take the\r\ntrouble to set him right, if we are going to lose anything by undeceiving\r\nhim. That would not be business. I suppose you think that is dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned smilingly to the minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish--I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minister, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cit could be otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Am I right or\r\nam I wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of the manufacturer, who laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not conducting this discussion. I will not deprive you of the\r\nfloor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to put in, \xe2\x80\x9creminds me of the experience of a\r\nfriend of mine, a brother novelist. He wrote a story where the failure of\r\na business man turned on a point just like that you have instanced. The\r\nman could have retrieved himself if he had let some people believe that\r\nwhat was so was not so, but his conscience stepped in and obliged him to\r\nown the truth. There was a good deal of talk about the case, I suppose,\r\nbecause it was not in real life, and my friend heard divers criticisms. He\r\nheard of a group of ministers who blamed him for exalting a case of common\r\nhonesty, as if it were something extraordinary; and he heard of some\r\nbusiness men who talked it over and said he had worked the case up\r\nsplendidly, but he was all wrong in the outcome--the fellow would never\r\nhave told the other fellows. They said it would not have been business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all laughed except the minister and the Altrurian; the manufacturer\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five years hence, the fellow who is going into business may\r\npity the fellows who are pitying him for his hard fate now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly, but not necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the\r\nbusiness man is on top, as far as money goes; he is the fellow who makes\r\nthe big fortunes; the millionaire lawyers and doctors and ministers are\r\nexceptional. But his risks are tremendous. Ninety-five times out of a\r\nhundred he fails. To be sure, he picks up and goes on, but he seldom gets\r\nthere, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in your system,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great majority of those\r\nwho go into what you call the battle of life are defeated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe killed, wounded, and missing sum up a frightful total,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker\r\nadmitted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut whatever the end is, there is a great deal of prosperity on\r\nthe way. The statistics are correct, but they do not tell the whole truth.\r\nIt is not so bad as it seems. Still, simply looking at the material\r\nchances, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame those young fellows for not wanting to go into\r\nbusiness. And when you come to other considerations! We used to cut the\r\nknot of the difficulty pretty sharply; we said a college education was\r\nwrong, or the hot and hot American spread-eaglers did. Business is the\r\nnational ideal, and the successful business man is the American type. It\r\nis a business man\xe2\x80\x99s country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if I understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very anxious to\r\nhave a clear understanding of the matter, the effect of the university\r\nwith you is to unfit a youth for business life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. It may give him great advantages in it, and that is the theory and\r\nexpectation of most fathers who send their sons to the university. But,\r\nundoubtedly, the effect is to render business life distasteful. The\r\nuniversity nurtures all sorts of lofty ideals, which business has no use\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the effect is undemocratic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is simply unbusinesslike. The boy is a better democrat when he\r\nleaves college than he will be later, if he goes into business. The\r\nuniversity has taught him and equipped him to use his own gifts and powers\r\nfor his advancement; but the first lesson of business, and the last, is to\r\nuse other men\xe2\x80\x99s gifts and powers. If he looks about him at all, he sees\r\nthat no man gets rich simply by his own labor, no matter how mighty a\r\ngenius he is, and that, if you want to get rich, you must make other men\r\nwork for you, and pay you for the privilege of doing so. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker turned to the manufacturer with this question, and the other\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThe theory is, that we give people work,\xe2\x80\x9d and they both laughed.\r\n\r\nThe minister said: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that in Altruria no man works for the profit\r\nof another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; each works for the profit of all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem to have made it go. Nobody can deny\r\nthat. But we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it go here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? I am very curious to know why our system seems so impossible to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is contrary to the American spirit. It is alien to our love of\r\nindividuality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we prize individuality, too, and we think we secure it under our\r\nsystem. Under yours, it seems to me that while the individuality of the\r\nman who makes other men work for him is safe, except from itself, the\r\nindividuality of the workers--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is their lookout. We have found that, upon the whole, it is\r\nbest to let every man look out for himself. I know that, in a certain\r\nlight, the result has an ugly aspect; but, nevertheless, in spite of all,\r\nthe country is enormously prosperous. The pursuit of happiness, which is\r\none of the inalienable rights secured to us by the Declaration, is, and\r\nalways has been, a dream; but the pursuit of the dollar yields tangible\r\nproceeds, and we get a good deal of excitement out of it as it goes on.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that we are the richest nation in the world. Do you call\r\nAltruria a rich country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not quite make out whether the banker was serious or not in all\r\nthis talk; sometimes I suspected him of a fine mockery, but the Altrurian\r\ntook him upon the surface of his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know whether it is or not. The question of wealth does not enter\r\ninto our scheme. I can say that we all have enough, and that no one is\r\neven in the fear of want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is very well. But we should think it was paying too much for it\r\nif we had to give up the hope of ever having more than we wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d and at\r\nthis point the banker uttered his jolly laugh, and I perceived that he had\r\nbeen trying to draw the Altrurian out and practise upon his patriotism. It\r\nwas a great relief to find that he had been joking in so much that seemed\r\na dead give-away of our economical position. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Altruria,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nis your ideal great man? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean personally, but abstractly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWith us there is so little ambition for\r\ndistinction, as you understand it, that your question is hard to answer.\r\nBut I should say, speaking largely, that it was some man who had been able\r\nfor the time being to give the greatest happiness to the greatest\r\nnumber--some artist or poet or inventor or physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was somewhat surprised to have the banker take this preposterous\r\nstatement seriously, respectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is quite conceivable with\r\nyour system. What should you say,\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of the rest of us\r\ngenerally, \xe2\x80\x9cwas our ideal of greatness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one replied at once, or at all, till the manufacturer said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will\r\nlet you continue to run it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is a very curious inquiry, and I have thought it over a good\r\ndeal. I should say that within a generation our ideal has changed twice.\r\nBefore the war, and during all the time from the Revolution onward, it was\r\nundoubtedly the great politician, the publicist, the statesman. As we grew\r\nolder and began to have an intellectual life of our own, I think the\r\nliterary fellows had a pretty good share of the honors that were going--that\r\nis, such a man as Longfellow was popularly considered a type of\r\ngreatness. When the war came, it brought the soldier to the front, and\r\nthere was a period of ten or fifteen years when he dominated the national\r\nimagination. That period passed, and the great era of material prosperity\r\nset in. The big fortunes began to tower up, and heroes of another sort\r\nbegan to appeal to our admiration. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any doubt but\r\nthe millionaire is now the American ideal. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t very pleasant to think\r\nso, even for people who have got on, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t very hopefully be\r\ndenied. It is the man with the most money who now takes the prize in our\r\nnational cake-walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian turned curiously toward me, and I did my best to tell him\r\nwhat a cake-walk was. When I had finished, the banker resumed, only to\r\nsay, as he rose from his chair to bid us good-night: \xe2\x80\x9cIn any average\r\nassembly of Americans the greatest millionaire would take the eyes of all\r\nfrom the greatest statesman, the greatest poet, or the greatest soldier we\r\never had. That,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cwill account to you for many\r\nthings as you travel through our country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time the members of our little group came together, the\r\nmanufacturer began at once upon the banker:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think that our friend the professor, here, would hardly like\r\nthat notion of yours, that business, as business, has nothing to do with\r\nthe education of a gentleman. If this is a business man\xe2\x80\x99s country, and if\r\nthe professor has nothing in stock but the sort of education that business\r\nhas no use for, I should suppose that he would want to go into some other\r\nline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker mutely referred the matter to the professor, who said, with\r\nthat cold grin of his which I hated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we shall wait for business to purge and live cleanly. Then it\r\nwill have some use for the education of a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have touched the quick in both of you,\r\nwhen I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the least notion of doing so. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really like to\r\nprophesy which will adapt itself to the other--education or business. Let\r\nus hope there will be mutual concessions. There are some pessimists who\r\nsay that business methods, especially on the large scale of the trusts and\r\ncombinations, have grown worse instead of better; but this may be merely\r\nwhat is called a \xe2\x80\x98transition state.\xe2\x80\x99 Hamlet must be cruel to be kind; the\r\ndarkest hour comes before dawn--and so on. Perhaps when business gets\r\nthe whole affair of life into its hands, and runs the republic, as its\r\nenemies now accuse it of doing, the process of purging and living cleanly\r\nwill begin. I have known lots of fellows who started in life rather\r\nscampishly; but when they felt secure of themselves, and believed that\r\nthey could afford to be honest, they became so. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why the\r\nsame thing shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen on a large scale. We must never forget that we\r\nare still a very novel experiment, though we have matured so rapidly in\r\nsome respects that we have come to regard ourselves as an accomplished\r\nfact. We are really less so than we were forty years ago, with all the\r\ntremendous changes since the war. Before that we could take certain\r\nmatters for granted. If a man got out of work, he turned his hand to\r\nsomething else; if a man failed in business, he started in again from some\r\nother direction; as a last resort, in both cases, he went West, pre-empted\r\na quarter-section of public land, and grew up with the country. Now the\r\ncountry is grown up; the public land is gone; business is full on all\r\nsides, and the hand that turned itself to something else has lost its\r\ncunning. The struggle for life has changed from a free-fight to an\r\nencounter of disciplined forces, and the free-fighters that are left get\r\nground to pieces between organized labor and organized capital. Decidedly,\r\nwe are in a transition state, and if the higher education tried to adapt\r\nitself to business needs, there are chances that it might sacrifice itself\r\nwithout helping business. After all, how much education does business\r\nneed? Were our great fortunes made by educated men, or men of university\r\ntraining? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but these young fellows are right about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that may all be,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems to me that you give Mr.\r\nHomos, somehow, a wrong impression of our economic life by your\r\ngeneralizations. You are a Harvard man yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I am not a rich man. A million or two, more or less; but what is\r\nthat? I have suffered, at the start and all along, from the question as to\r\nwhat a man with the education of a gentleman ought to do in such and such\r\na juncture. The fellows who have not that sort of education have not that\r\nsort of question, and they go in and win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you admit, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the higher education\r\nelevates a business man\xe2\x80\x99s standard of morals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. That is one of its chief drawbacks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with the deference due even to a man who had only a\r\nmillion or two, more or less, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must allow _you_ to say such things. But\r\nif the case is so bad with the business men who have made the great\r\nfortunes--the business men who have never had the disadvantage of a\r\nuniversity education--I wish you would explain to Mr. Homos why, in every\r\npublic exigency, we instinctively appeal to the business sense of the\r\ncommunity as if it were the fountain of wisdom, probity, and equity.\r\nSuppose there were some question of vital interest--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say financial,\r\nbut political or moral or social--on which it was necessary to rouse\r\npublic opinion, what would be the first thing to do? To call a meeting\r\nover the signatures of the leading business men, because no other names\r\nappeal with such force to the public. You might get up a call signed by\r\nall the novelists, artists, ministers, lawyers, and doctors in the state,\r\nand it would not have a tithe of the effect, with the people at large,\r\nthat a call signed by a few leading merchants, bank presidents, railroad\r\nmen, and trust officers would have. What is the reason? It seems strange\r\nthat I should be asking you to defend yourself against yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear fellow, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker replied, with his\r\ncaressing bonhomie. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I will confess, to begin with, that I do not\r\nexpect to answer your question to your entire satisfaction. I can only do\r\nmy best--on the instalment plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to the Altrurian, and then went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAs I said the other night,\r\nthis is a business man\xe2\x80\x99s country. We are a purely commercial people; money\r\nis absolutely to the fore; and business, which is the means of getting the\r\nmost money, is the American ideal. If you like, you may call it the\r\nAmerican fetish; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind calling it so myself. The fact that business\r\nis our ideal, or our fetish, will account for the popular faith in\r\nbusiness men, who form its priesthood, its hierarchy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nmyself, any other reason for regarding business men as solider than\r\nnovelists or artists or ministers, not to mention lawyers and doctors.\r\nThey are supposed to have long heads; but it appears that ninety-five\r\ntimes out of a hundred they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. They are supposed to be very\r\nreliable; but it is almost invariably a business man of some sort who gets\r\nout to Canada while the state examiner is balancing his books, and it is\r\nusually the longest headed business men who get plundered by him. No, it\r\nis simply because business is our national ideal that the business man is\r\nhonored above all other men among us. In the aristocratic countries they\r\nforward a public object under the patronage of the nobility and gentry; in\r\na plutocratic country they get the business men to indorse it. I suppose\r\nthat the average American citizen feels that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t indorse a thing\r\nunless it was safe; and the average American citizen likes to be safe--he\r\nis cautious. As a matter of fact, business men are always taking risks,\r\nand business is a game of chance, in a certain degree. Have I made myself\r\nintelligible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntirely so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian; and he seemed so thoroughly well\r\nsatisfied that he forbore asking any further question.\r\n\r\nNo one else spoke. The banker lighted a cigar, and resumed at the point\r\nwhere he left off when I ventured to enter upon the defence of his class\r\nwith him. I must say that he had not convinced me at all. At that moment\r\nI would rather have trusted him, in any serious matter of practical\r\nconcern, than all the novelists I ever heard of. But I thought I would\r\nleave the word to him, without further attempt to reinstate him in his\r\nself-esteem. In fact, he seemed to be getting along very well without it,\r\nor else he was feeling that mysterious control from the Altrurian which I\r\nhad already suspected him of using. Voluntarily or involuntarily, the\r\nbanker proceeded with his contribution to the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s stock of\r\nknowledge concerning our civilization:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe, however, that the higher education is any more of a\r\nfailure, as a provision for a business career, than the lower education is\r\nfor the life of labor. I suppose that the hypercritical observer might say\r\nthat in a wholly commercial civilization like ours the business man really\r\nneeded nothing beyond the three R\xe2\x80\x99s, and the working-man needed no R at\r\nall. As a practical affair, there is a good deal to be said in favor of\r\nthat view. The higher education is part of the social ideal which we have\r\nderived from the past, from Europe. It is part of the provision for the\r\nlife of leisure, the life of the aristocrat, which nobody of our\r\ngeneration leads, except women. Our women really have some use for the\r\neducation of a gentleman, but our men have none. How will that do for a\r\ngeneralization?\xe2\x80\x9d the banker asked of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a good deal like one of my own. I\r\nhave always been struck with that phase of our civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker resumed, \xe2\x80\x9ctake the lower education. That is part\r\nof the civic ideal which, I suppose, I may say we evolved from the depths\r\nof our inner consciousness of what an American citizen ought to be. It\r\nincludes instruction in all the R\xe2\x80\x99s, and in several other letters of the\r\nalphabet. It is given free by the state, and no one can deny that it is\r\nthoroughly socialistic in conception and application.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDistinctly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that the text-books are\r\nfurnished by the state, we have only to go a step further and provide a\r\ngood, hot lunch for the children every day, as they do in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I should have much to say\r\nagainst that. It seems as reasonable as anything in the system of\r\neducation which we force upon the working classes. _They_ know perfectly\r\nwell, whether we do or not, that the three R\xe2\x80\x99s will not make their\r\nchildren better mechanics or laborers, and that, if the fight for a mere\r\nliving is to go on from generation to generation, they will have no\r\nleisure to apply the little learning they get in the public schools for\r\ntheir personal culture. In the mean time we deprive the parents of their\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s labor, in order that they may be better citizens for their\r\nschooling, as we imagine; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they are or not. We offer\r\nthem no sort of compensation for their time, and I think we ought to feel\r\nobliged to them for not wanting wages for their children while we are\r\nteaching them to be better citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has been suggested by some of their\r\nleaders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really? Well, that is too good!\xe2\x80\x9d The banker threw back his head and\r\nroared, and we all laughed with him. When we had sobered down again, he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that when a working-man makes all the use he can of his\r\nlower education he becomes a business man, and then he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need the\r\nhigher. Professor, you seem to be left out in the cold by our system,\r\nwhichever way you take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of supply and demand works both ways:\r\nit creates the demand, if the supply comes first; and if we keep on giving\r\nthe sons of business men the education of a gentleman, we may yet make\r\nthem feel the need of it. We shall evolve a new sort of business man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sort that can\xe2\x80\x99t make money, or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly like to, on some\r\nterms?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps we shall work out our democratic\r\nsalvation in that way. When you have educated your new business man to the\r\npoint where he can\xe2\x80\x99t consent to get rich at the obvious cost of others,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got him on the way back to work with his hands. He will sink into\r\nthe ranks of labor, and give the fellow with the lower education a chance.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but you\xe2\x80\x99re right, professor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer had not spoken as yet. Now he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen it is education,\r\nafter all, that is to bridge the chasm between the classes and the masses,\r\nthough it seems destined to go a long way around about it. There was a\r\ntime, I believe, when we expected religion to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it may still be doing it, for all I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to the minister. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be able to\r\ngive us some statistics on the subject with that large congregation of\r\nyours. You preach to more people than any other pulpit in your city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker named one of the principal cities in the East, and the minister\r\nanswered, with, modest pride: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure of that; but our society is\r\ncertainly a very large one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how many of the lower classes are there in it--people who work\r\nfor their living with their hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe minister stirred uneasily in his chair, and at last he said, with\r\nevident unhappiness: \xe2\x80\x9cThey--I suppose--they have their own churches. I\r\nhave never thought that such a separation of the classes was right; and I\r\nhave had some of the very best people--socially and financially--with me\r\nin the wish that there might be more brotherliness between the rich and\r\npoor among us. But as yet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped; the banker pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean there are _no_ working-people\r\nin your congregation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think of any,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the minister, so miserably that the\r\nbanker forbore to press the point.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer broke the awkward pause which followed: \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it\r\nasserted that there is no country in the world where the separation of the\r\nclasses is so absolute as in ours. In fact, I once heard a Russian\r\nrevolutionist, who had lived in exile all over Europe, say that he had\r\nnever seen anywhere such a want of kindness or sympathy between rich and\r\npoor as he had observed in America. I doubted whether he was right. But he\r\nbelieved that, if it ever came to the industrial revolution with us, the\r\nfight would be more uncompromising than any such fight that the world had\r\never seen. There was no respect from low to high, he said, and no\r\nconsideration from high to low, as there were in countries with traditions\r\nand old associations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be something in that. Certainly, so\r\nfar as the two forces have come into conflict here, there has been no\r\ndisposition, on either side, to \xe2\x80\x98make war with the water of roses.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishing, in fact, to see how ruthless the fellows who have just got up\r\nare toward the fellows who are still down. And the best of us have been up\r\nonly a generation or two--and the fellows who are still down know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think would be the outcome of such a conflict?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked,\r\nwith my soul divided between fear of it and the perception of its\r\nexcellence as material. My fancy vividly sketched the outline of a story\r\nwhich should forecast the struggle and its event, somewhat on the plan of\r\nthe Battle of Dorking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should beat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, breaking his cigar-ash off with his\r\nlittle finger; and I instantly cast him, with his ironic calm, for the\r\npart of a great patrician leader in my \xe2\x80\x9cFall of the Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course,\r\nI disguised him somewhat, and travestied his worldly bonhomie with the\r\nbluff sang-froid of the soldier; these things are easily done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think we should beat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the manufacturer, with a\r\ncertain curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all the good jingo reasons: we have got the materials for beating.\r\nThose fellows throw away their strength whenever they begin to fight, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve been so badly generalled, up to the present time, that they have\r\nwanted to fight at the outset of every quarrel. They have been beaten in\r\nevery quarrel, but still they always want to begin by fighting. That is\r\nall right. When they have learned enough to begin by _voting_, then we\r\nshall have to look out. But if they keep on fighting, and always putting\r\nthemselves in the wrong and getting the worst of it, perhaps we can fix\r\nthe voting so we needn\xe2\x80\x99t be any more afraid of that than we are of the\r\nfighting. It\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing how short-sighted they are. They, have no\r\nconception of any cure for their grievances except more wages and fewer\r\nhours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you really think they have any just grievances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not, as a business man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a\r\nworking-man, I should probably think differently. But we will suppose, for\r\nthe sake of argument, that their day is too long and their pay is too\r\nshort. How do they go about to better themselves? They strike. Well, a\r\nstrike is a fight, and in a fight, nowadays, it is always skill and money\r\nthat win. The working-men can\xe2\x80\x99t stop till they have put themselves outside\r\nof the public sympathy which the newspapers say is so potent in their\r\nbehalf; I never saw that it did them the least good. They begin by\r\nboycotting, and breaking the heads of the men who want to work. They\r\ndestroy property, and they interfere with business--the two absolutely\r\nsacred things in the American religion. Then we call out the militia and\r\nshoot a few of them, and their leaders declare the strike off. It is\r\nperfectly simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will it be quite as simple,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, reluctant in behalf of my\r\nprojected romance, to have the matter so soon disposed of--\xe2\x80\x9cwill it be\r\nquite so simple if their leaders ever persuade the working-men to leave\r\nthe militia, as they threaten to do, from time to time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not quite so simple,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, the fight would be\r\ncomparatively simple. In the first place, I doubt--though I won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ncertain about it--whether there are a great many working-men in the\r\nmilitia now. I rather fancy it is made up, for the most part, of clerks\r\nand small tradesmen and book-keepers, and such employ\xc3\xa9s of business as\r\nhave time and money for it. I may be mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one seemed able to say whether he was mistaken or not; and, after\r\nwaiting a moment, he proceeded: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel pretty sure that it is so in the\r\ncity companies and regiments, at any rate, and that if every working-man\r\nleft them it would not seriously impair their effectiveness. But when the\r\nworking-men have left the militia, what have they done? They have\r\neliminated the only thing that disqualifies it for prompt and unsparing\r\nuse against strikers. As long as they are in it we might have our\r\nmisgivings, but if they were once out of it we should have none. And what\r\nwould they gain? They would not be allowed to arm and organize as an\r\ninimical force. _That_ was settled once for all in Chicago, in the case of\r\nthe International Groups. A few squads of policemen would break them up.\r\nWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker exclaimed, with his good-humored laugh, \xe2\x80\x9chow preposterous\r\nthey are when you come to look at it! They are in the majority, the\r\nimmense majority, if you count the farmers, and they prefer to behave as\r\nif they were the hopeless minority. They say they want an eight-hour law,\r\nand every now and then they strike and try to fight it. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\n_vote_ it? They could _make_ it the law in six months by such overwhelming\r\nnumbers that no one would dare to evade or defy it. They can make any law\r\nthey want, but they prefer to break such laws as we have. That \xe2\x80\x98alienates\r\npublic sympathy,\xe2\x80\x99 the newspapers say; but the spectacle of their stupidity\r\nand helpless wilfulness is so lamentable that I could almost pity them. If\r\nthey chose, it would take only a few years to transform our government\r\ninto the likeness of anything they wanted. But they would rather not have\r\nwhat they want, apparently, if they can only keep themselves from getting\r\nit, and they have to work hard to do that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they are misled by the un-American principles\r\nand methods of the Socialists among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. As far as I\r\nunderstand it, the Socialists are the only fellows among them who propose\r\nto vote their ideas into laws, and nothing can be more American than that.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the Socialists stir up the strikes--at least, among our\r\nworking-men; though the newspapers convict them of it, generally without\r\ntrying them. The Socialists seem to accept the strikes as the inevitable\r\noutcome of the situation, and they make use of them as proofs of the\r\nindustrial discontent. But, luckily for the status, our labor leaders are\r\nnot Socialists, for your Socialist, whatever you may say against him, has\r\ngenerally thought himself into a Socialist. He knows that until the\r\nworking-men stop fighting, and get down to voting--until they consent to\r\nbe the majority--there is no hope for them. I am not talking of\r\nanarchists, mind you, but of Socialists, whose philosophy is more law, not\r\nless, and who look forward to an order so just that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister faintly said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think will be the outcome\r\nof it all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had that question the other night, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we? Our legal friend here\r\nseemed to feel that we might rub along indefinitely as we are doing, or\r\nwork out an Altruria of our own; or go back to the patriarchal stage and\r\nown our working-men. He seemed not to have so much faith in the logic of\r\nevents as I have. I doubt if it is altogether a woman\xe2\x80\x99s logic. _Parole\r\nfemmine, fatti maschi,_ and the logic of events isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether words;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s full of hard knocks, too. But I\xe2\x80\x99m no prophet. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forecast the\r\nfuture; I prefer to take it as it comes. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little tract of William\r\nMorris\xe2\x80\x99s, though--I forget just what he calls it--that is full of curious\r\nand interesting speculation on this point. He thinks that, if we keep the\r\nroad we are now going, the last state of labor will be like its first, and\r\nit will be owned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that will ever happen in America,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cPractically, it is owned already in a vastly\r\ngreater measure than we recognize. And where would the great harm be? The\r\nnew slavery would not be like the old. There needn\xe2\x80\x99t be irresponsible\r\nwhipping and separation of families, and private buying and selling. The\r\nproletariate would probably be owned by the state, as it was at one time\r\nin Greece; or by large corporations, which would be much more in keeping\r\nwith the genius of our free institutions; and an enlightened public\r\nopinion would cast safeguards about it in the form of law to guard it from\r\nabuse. But it would be strictly policed, localized, and controlled. There\r\nwould probably be less suffering than there is now, when a man may be\r\ncowed into submission to any terms through the suffering of his family;\r\nwhen he may be starved out and turned out if he is unruly. You may be sure\r\nthat nothing of that kind would happen in the new slavery. We have not had\r\nnineteen hundred years of Christianity for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker paused, and, as the silence continued, he broke it with a\r\nlaugh, which was a prodigious relief to my feelings, and I suppose to the\r\nfeelings of all. I perceived that he had been joking, and I was confirmed\r\nin this when he turned to the Altrurian and laid his hand upon his\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a kind of Altrurian myself. What is the\r\nreason why we should not found a new Altruria here on the lines I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndrawn? Have you never had philosophers--well, call them philanthropists; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind--of my way of thinking among you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cAt one time, just before we emerged from\r\nthe competitive conditions, there was much serious question whether\r\ncapital should not own labor instead of labor owning capital. That was\r\nmany hundred years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to find myself such an advanced thinker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how came you to decide that labor should own capital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe voted it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cour fellows are still fighting it, and getting\r\nbeaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found him later in the evening talking with Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI liked your frankness with my Altrurian friend immensely; and it\r\nmay be well to put the worst foot foremost; but what is the advantage of\r\nnot leaving us a leg to stand upon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least offended at my boldness, as I had feared he might\r\nbe, but he said, with that jolly laugh of his: \xe2\x80\x9cCapital! Well, perhaps I\r\nhave worked my candor a little too hard; I suppose there is such a thing.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that it leaves me in the best possible position to carry\r\nthe war into Altruria when we get him to open up about his native land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! If you can get him to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we were just talking about that. Mrs. Makely has a plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, turning an empty chair near her own toward me. \xe2\x80\x9cSit\r\ndown and listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nI sat down, and Mrs. Makely continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought it all out, and I\r\nwant you to confess that in all practical matters a woman\xe2\x80\x99s brain is\r\nbetter than a man\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Bullion, here, says it is, and I want you to say\r\nso, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it comes down to business a woman is\r\nworth any two of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have just been agreeing,\xe2\x80\x9d I coincided, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the only gentlemen\r\namong us are women. Mrs. Makely, I admit, without further dispute, that\r\nthe most unworldly woman is worldlier than the worldliest man; and that in\r\nall practical matters we fade into dreamers and doctrinaires beside you.\r\nNow, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not mean to let me off so easily. She began to brag herself\r\nup, as women do whenever you make them the slightest concession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you men,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chave been trying for a whole week to get\r\nsomething out of Mr. Homos about his country, and you have left it to a\r\npoor, weak woman, at last, to think how to manage it. I do believe that\r\nyou get so much interested in your own talk, when you are with him, that\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t let him get in a word, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason you haven\xe2\x80\x99t found\r\nout anything about Altruria yet from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn view of the manner in which she had cut in at Mrs. Camp\xe2\x80\x99s, and stopped\r\nHomos on the very verge of the only full and free confession he had ever\r\nbeen near making about Altruria, I thought this was pretty cool; but, for\r\nfear of worse, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, Mrs. Makely. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say that there has been a\r\nshameful want of self-control among us, and that, if we learn anything at\r\nall from him, it will be because you have taught us how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not resist this bit of taffy. She scarcely gave herself time to\r\ngulp it before she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very well to say that now! But where would you have been if I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t set my wits to work? Now, listen! It just popped into my mind, like\r\nan inspiration, when I was thinking of something altogether different. It\r\nflashed upon me in an instant: a good object, and a public occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, finding this explosion and electrical inspiration rather\r\nenigmatical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know, the Union Chapel, over in the village, is in a languishing\r\ncondition, and the ladies have been talking all summer about doing\r\nsomething for it, getting up something--a concert or theatricals or a\r\ndance or something--and applying the proceeds to repainting and papering\r\nthe visible church; it needs it dreadfully. But, of course, those things\r\nare not exactly religious, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know; and a fair is so much trouble;\r\nand _such_ a bore, when you get the articles ready, even; and everybody\r\nfeels swindled; and now people frown on raffles, so there is no use\r\nthinking of them. What you want is something striking. We did think of a\r\nparlor-reading, or perhaps ventriloquism; but the performers all charge so\r\nmuch that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything left after paying expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to expect some sort of prompting at this point; so I said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is just where your Mr. Homos comes in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! How does he come in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, get him to deliver a Talk on Altruria. As soon as he knows it\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\na good object, he will be on fire to do it; and they must live so much in\r\ncommon there that the public occasion will be just the thing that will\r\nappeal to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did seem a good plan to me, and I said so. But Mrs. Makely was so much\r\nin love with it that she was not satisfied with my modest recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood? It\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent! It\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing! And I have thought it out,\r\ndown to the last detail--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there is sufficient general\r\ninterest in the subject, outside of the hotel, to get a full house for\r\nhim? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see him subjected to the mortification of empty\r\nbenches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world are you thinking of? Why, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a farm-house,\r\nanywhere within ten miles, where they haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of Mr. Homos; and\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a servant under this roof, or in any of the boarding-houses,\r\nwho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know something about Altruria and want to know more. It seems\r\nthat your friend has been much oftener with the porters and the\r\nstable-boys than he has been with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had only too great reason to fear so. In spite of my warnings and\r\nentreaties, he had continued to behave toward every human being he met\r\nexactly as if they were equals. He apparently could not conceive of that\r\nsocial difference which difference of occupation creates among us. He\r\nowned that he saw it, and from the talk of our little group he knew it\r\nexisted; but, when I expostulated with him upon some act in gross\r\nviolation of society usage, he only answered that he could not imagine\r\nthat what he saw and knew could actually be. It was quite impossible to\r\nkeep him from bowing with the greatest deference to our waitress; he shook\r\nhands with the head-waiter every morning as well as with me; there was a\r\nfearful story current in the house, that he had been seen running down one\r\nof the corridors to relieve a chambermaid laden with two heavy water-pails\r\nwhich she was carrying to the rooms to fill up the pitchers. This was\r\nprobably not true; but I myself saw him helping in the hotel hay-field one\r\nafternoon, shirt-sleeved like any of the hired men. He said that it was\r\nthe best possible exercise, and that he was ashamed he could give no\r\nbetter excuse for it than the fact that without something of the kind he\r\nshould suffer from indigestion. It was grotesque, and out of all keeping\r\nwith a man of his cultivation and breeding. He was a gentleman and a\r\nscholar, there was no denying, and yet he did things in contravention of\r\ngood form at every opportunity, and nothing I could say had any effect\r\nwith him. I was perplexed beyond measure, the day after I had reproached\r\nhim for his labor in the hay-field, to find him in a group of table-girls,\r\nwho were listening while the head-waiter read aloud to them in the shade\r\nof the house; there was a corner looking toward the stables which was\r\ngiven up to them by tacit consent of the guests during a certain part of\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nI feigned not to see him, but I could not forbear speaking to him about it\r\nafterward. He took it in good part, but he said he had been rather\r\ndisappointed in the kind of literature they liked and the comments they\r\nmade on it; he had expected that with the education they had received, and\r\nwith their experience of the seriousness of life, they would prefer\r\nsomething less trivial. He supposed, however, that a romantic love-story,\r\nwhere a poor American girl marries an English lord, formed a refuge for\r\nthem from the real world which promised them so little and held them so\r\ncheap. It was quite useless for one to try to make him realize his\r\nbehavior in consorting with servants as a kind of scandal.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that his behavior, as I could see, had already begun\r\nto demoralize the objects of his misplaced politeness. At first the\r\nservants stared and resented it, as if it were some tasteless joke; but in\r\nan incredibly short time, when they saw that he meant his courtesy in good\r\nfaith, they took it as their due. I had always had a good understanding\r\nwith the head-waiter, and I thought I could safely smile with him at the\r\nqueer conduct of my friend toward himself and his fellow-servants.\r\nTo my astonishment he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t treat them as if\r\nthey were ladies and gentlemen. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he treat you and your friends so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to answer this, and I could only suffer in silence, and\r\nhope the Altrurian would soon go. I had dreaded the moment when the\r\nlandlord should tell me that his room was wanted; now I almost desired it;\r\nbut he never did. On the contrary, the Altrurian was in high favor with\r\nhim. He said he liked to see a man make himself pleasant with everybody;\r\nand that he did not believe he had ever had a guest in the house who was\r\nso popular all round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t criticise him--with his\r\npeculiar traditions. I presume I should be just so myself if I had been\r\nbrought up in Altruria, which, thank goodness, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But Mr. Homos is\r\na perfect dear, and all the women in the house are in love with him, from\r\nthe cook\xe2\x80\x99s helpers, up and down. No, the only danger is that there won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe room in the hotel parlors for all the people that will want to hear\r\nhim, and we shall have to make the admission something that will be\r\nprohibitive in most cases. We shall have to make it a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that will settle the question as far as the\r\nfarming population is concerned. It\xe2\x80\x99s twice as much as they ever pay for a\r\nreserved seat in the circus, and four times as much as a simple admission.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Mrs. Makely, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very few, though fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it all over, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put the tickets at one\r\ndollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Have you caught your hare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet. And I want you to help me catch him. What do you think\r\nis the best way to go about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker said he would leave us to the discussion of that question, but\r\nMrs. Makely could count upon him in everything if she could only get the\r\nman to talk. At the end of our conference we decided to interview the\r\nAltrurian together.\r\n\r\nI shall always be ashamed of the way that woman wheedled the Altrurian,\r\nwhen we found him the next morning, walking up and down the piazza, before\r\nbreakfast--that is, it was before our breakfast; when we asked him to go\r\nin with us, he said he had just had his breakfast, and was waiting for\r\nReuben Camp, who had promised to take him up as he passed with a load of\r\nhay for one of the hotels in the village.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that reminds me, Mr. Homos,\xe2\x80\x9d the unscrupulous woman began on him at\r\nonce. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to interest you in a little movement we\xe2\x80\x99re getting up for\r\nthe Union Chapel in the village. You know it\xe2\x80\x99s the church where all the\r\ndifferent sects have their services; alternately. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nan original way of doing, but there is sense in it where the people are\r\ntoo poor to go into debt for different churches, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s admirable!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard about it from the\r\nCamps. It is an emblem of the unity which ought to prevail among\r\nChristians of all professions. How can I help you, Mrs. Makely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would approve of it!\xe2\x80\x9d she exulted. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply this:\r\nThe poor little place has got so shabby that _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ almost ashamed to be\r\nseen going into it, for one; and want to raise money enough to give it a\r\nnew coat of paint outside and put on some kind of pretty paper, of an\r\necclesiastical pattern, on the inside. I declare, those staring white\r\nwalls, with the cracks in the plastering zigzagging every _which_ way,\r\ndistract me so that I can\xe2\x80\x99t put my mind on the sermon. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nthat paper, say of a Gothic design, would be a great improvement? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nit would; and it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Twelvemough\xe2\x80\x99s idea, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI learned this fact now for the first time; but, with Mrs. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarning eye upon me, I could not say so, and I made what sounded to me\r\nlike a Gothic murmur of acquiescence. It sufficed for Mrs. Makely\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurpose, at any rate, and she went on, without giving the Altrurian a\r\nchance to say what he thought the educational effect of wall-paper would\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the long and short of it is that we want you to make this money for\r\nus, Mr. Homos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d He started in a kind of horror. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady, I never made any money\r\nin my life. I should think it _wrong_ to make money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Altruria, yes. We all know how it is in your delightful country, and I\r\nassure you that no one could respect your conscientious scruples more than\r\nI do. But you must remember that you are in America now. In America you\r\nhave to make money, or else--get left. And then you must consider the\r\nobject, and all the good you can do, indirectly, by a little Talk on\r\nAltruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, blandly: \xe2\x80\x9cA little Talk on Altruria? How in the world should\r\nI get money by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was only too eager to explain, and she did it with so much volubility\r\nand at such great length that I, who am good for nothing till I have had\r\nmy cup of coffee in the morning, almost perished of an elucidation which\r\nthe Altrurian bore with the sweetest patience.\r\n\r\nWhen she gave him a chance to answer, at last, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very\r\nhappy to do what you wish, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad! You _have_ been so slippery\r\nabout Altruria, you know, that I expected nothing but a point-blank\r\nrefusal. Of course, I knew you would be kind about it. Oh, I can hardly\r\nbelieve my senses! You can\xe2\x80\x99t think what a dear you are.\xe2\x80\x9d I knew she had\r\ngot that word from some English people who had been in the hotel; and she\r\nwas working it rather wildly, but it was not my business to check her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, all you have got to do is to leave the whole thing to me, and\r\nnot bother about it a bit till I send and tell you we are ready to listen.\r\nThere comes Reuben, with his ox-team. Thank you so much, Mr. Homos. No one\r\nneed be ashamed to enter the house of God\xe2\x80\x9d--she said Gawd, in an access of\r\npiety--\xe2\x80\x9cafter we get that paint and paper on it; and we shall have them on\r\nbefore two Sabbaths have passed over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrung the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s hand; I was only afraid she was going to kiss\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one stipulation I should like to make,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d she cut in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is, there shall be no exclusion from my lecture on account of\r\noccupation or condition. That is a thing that I can in no wise\r\ncountenance, even in America; it is far more abhorrent to me even than\r\nmoney-making, though they are each a part and parcel of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was that,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can assure you,\r\nMr. Homos, there shall be nothing of that kind. Every one--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwho it is or what they do--shall hear you who buys a ticket. Now, will\r\nthat do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, and he let her wring his hand again.\r\n\r\nShe pushed hers through my arm as we started for the dining-room, and\r\nleaned over to whisper jubilantly: \xe2\x80\x9cThat will fix it. He will see how much\r\nhis precious lower classes care for Altruria if they have to pay a dollar\r\napiece to hear about it. And I shall keep faith with him to the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not feel that she would keep it in the spirit; but I could only\r\ngroan inwardly and chuckle outwardly at the woman\xe2\x80\x99s depravity.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, though I could not approve of it, a capital joke, and so\r\nit seemed to all the members of the little group whom I had made\r\nespecially acquainted with the Altrurian. It is true that the minister was\r\nsomewhat troubled with the moral question, which did not leave me wholly\r\nat peace; and the banker affected to find a question of taste involved,\r\nwhich he said he must let me settle, however, as the man\xe2\x80\x99s host; if I\r\ncould stand it, he could. No one said anything against the plan to Mrs.\r\nMakely, and this energetic woman made us take two tickets apiece, as soon\r\nas she got them printed, over in the village. She got little hand-bills\r\nprinted, and had them scattered about through the neighborhood, at all the\r\nhotels, boarding-houses, and summer cottages, to give notice of the time\r\nand place of the talk on Altruria. She fixed this for the following\r\nSaturday afternoon, in our hotel parlor; she had it in the afternoon so as\r\nnot to interfere with the hop in the evening; she put tickets on sale at\r\nthe principal houses and at the village drug-store, and she made me go\r\nabout with her and help her sell them at some of the cottages in person.\r\n\r\nI must say I found this extremely distasteful, especially where the people\r\nwere not very willing to buy, and she had to urge them. They all admitted\r\nthe excellence of the object, but they were not so sure about the means.\r\nAt several places the ladies asked who was this Mr. Homos, anyway; and how\r\ndid she know he was really from Altruria? He might be an impostor.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Makely would put me forward, and I would be obliged to give such\r\naccount of him as I could, and to explain just how and why he came to be\r\nmy guest; with the cumulative effect of bringing back all the misgivings\r\nwhich I had myself felt at the outset concerning him, and which I had\r\ndismissed as too fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe tickets went off rather slowly, even in our own hotel; people thought\r\nthem too dear; and some, as soon as they knew the price, said frankly they\r\nhad heard enough about Altruria already, and were sick of the whole thing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely said this was quite what she had expected of those people;\r\nthat they were horrid and stingy and vulgar; and she should see what face\r\nthey would have to ask her to take tickets when _they_ were trying to get\r\nup something. She began to be vexed with herself, she confessed, at the\r\njoke she was playing on Mr. Homos, and I noticed that she put herself\r\nrather defiantly _en evidence_ in his company whenever she could in the\r\npresence of these reluctant ladies. She told me she had not the courage to\r\nask the clerk how many of the tickets he had sold out of those she had\r\nleft at the desk.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the third or fourth, as I was going in to breakfast with her,\r\nthe head-waiter stopped her as he opened the door, and asked modestly if\r\nshe could spare him a few tickets, for he thought he could sell some. To\r\nmy amazement the unprincipled creature said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly. How many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and instantly took a package out of her pocket, where she seemed always to\r\nhave them. He asked, Would twenty be more than she could spare? and she\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Here are twenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d and bestowed the whole\r\npackage upon him.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Reuben Camp came lounging up toward us, where I sat with\r\nher on the corner of the piazza, and said that if she would like to let\r\nhim try his luck with some tickets for the Talk he would see what he could\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have all you want, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nbetter luck than I have. I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly disgusted with people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fished several packages out of her pocket this time, and he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou mean that I can have them all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one, and a band of music into the bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\r\nrecklessly. But she seemed a little daunted when he quietly took them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know there are a hundred here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should like to see what I can do among the natives. Then there is\r\na construction train over at the junction, and I know a lot of the\r\nfellows. I guess some of \xe2\x80\x98em would like to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tickets are a dollar each, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camp. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely turned to me with a kind of gasp as he shambled away. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout having the whole crew of a construction train at the Talk? I dare\r\nsay it won\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant to the ladies who have bought tickets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oh_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with astonishing contempt, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\n_they_ think. But Reuben has got all my tickets, and suppose he keeps them\r\nso long that I won\xe2\x80\x99t have time to sell any, and then throws them back on\r\nmy hands? _I_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can go around now and tell\r\npeople that my tickets are all gone; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go instantly and have the\r\nclerk hold all he has left at a premium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came back looking rather blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a single one left. He says an old native came in this\r\nmorning and took every last one of them--he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember just how\r\nmany. I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to speculate on them; and if Reuben Camp\r\nserves me a trick like that--Why,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspeculate on them myself. I should like to know why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, I\r\nshould just _like_ to make some of those creatures pay double, or treble,\r\nfor the chances they\xe2\x80\x99ve refused. Ah, Mrs. Bulkham,\xe2\x80\x9d she called out to a\r\nlady who was coming down the veranda toward us, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to know\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got rid of all my tickets. _Such_ a relief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bulkham retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bulkham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you understood I wanted one for my\r\ndaughter and myself, if she came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, with a wink of concentrated\r\nwickedness at me. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if you do, you will have to say so now, without\r\nany ifs or ands about it; and if any of the tickets come back--I let\r\nfriends have a few on sale--I will give you two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bulkham, after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; it will be five dollars for the two. I feel bound to get all I\r\ncan for the cause. Shall I put your name down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bulkham, rather crossly; but Mrs. Makely inscribed her\r\nname on her tablets with a radiant amiability, which suffered no eclipse\r\nwhen, within the next fifteen minutes, a dozen other ladies hurried up and\r\nbought in at the same rate.\r\n\r\nI could not stand it, and I got up to go away, feeling extremely\r\n_particeps criminis_. Mrs. Makely seemed to have a conscience as light as\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Reuben Camp or the head-waiter don\xe2\x80\x99t bring back some of those tickets,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall do. I shall have to put chairs into the aisles\r\nand charge five dollars apiece for as many people as I can crowd in there.\r\nI never knew anything so perfectly providential.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envy you the ability to see it in that light, Mrs. Makely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\nfaint at heart. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose Camp crowds the place full of his trainmen, how\r\nwill the ladies that you\xe2\x80\x99ve sold tickets to at five dollars apiece like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! What do I care how they like it! Horrid things! And for repairs on\r\nthe house of Gawd, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as being in church, where everybody is\r\nequal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time passed. Mrs. Makely sold chances to all the ladies in the house;\r\non Friday night Reuben Camp brought her a hundred dollars; the head-waiter\r\nhad already paid in twenty-five. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to ask them if they\r\nspeculated on them,\xe2\x80\x9d she confided to me. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose they would have\r\nthe conscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had secured the large parlor of the hotel, where the young people\r\ndanced in the evening, and where entertainments were held, of the sort\r\nusually given in summer hotels; we had already had a dramatic reading, a\r\ntime with the phonograph, an exhibition of necromancy, a concert by a\r\ncollege glee club, and I do not know what else. The room would hold\r\nperhaps two hundred people, if they were closely seated, and, by her own\r\nshowing, Mrs. Makely had sold above two hundred and fifty tickets and\r\nchances. All Saturday forenoon she consoled herself with the belief that a\r\ngreat many people at the other hotels and cottages had bought seats\r\nmerely to aid the cause, and would not really come; she estimated that at\r\nleast fifty would stay away; but, if Reuben Camp had sold his tickets\r\namong the natives, we might expect every one of them to come and get his\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x99s worth; she did not dare to ask the head-waiter how he had got rid\r\nof his twenty-five tickets.\r\n\r\nThe hour set for the Talk to begin was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, so that people could\r\nhave their naps comfortably over, after the one o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner, and be\r\njust in the right frame of mind for listening. But long before the\r\nappointed time the people who dine at twelve, and never take an afternoon\r\nnap, began to arrive, on foot, in farm-wagons, smart buggies, mud-crusted\r\ncarryalls, and all manner of ramshackle vehicles. They arrived as if\r\ncoming to a circus, old husbands and wives, young couples and their\r\nchildren, pretty girls and their fellows, and hitched their horses to the\r\ntails of their wagons, and began to make a picnic lunch in the shadow of\r\nthe grove lying between the hotel and the station. About two we heard the\r\nsnorting of a locomotive at a time when no train was due, and a\r\nconstruction train came in view, with the men waving their handkerchiefs\r\nfrom the windows, and apparently ready for all the fun there was to be in\r\nthe thing. Some of them had a small flag in each hand, the American Stars\r\nand Stripes and the white flag of Altruria, in compliment to my guest, I\r\nsuppose. A good many of the farmers came over to the hotel to buy tickets,\r\nwhich they said they expected to get after they came, and Mrs. Makely was\r\nobliged to pacify them with all sorts of lying promises. From moment to\r\nmoment she was in consultation with the landlord, who decided to throw\r\nopen the dining-room, which connected with the parlor, so as to allow the\r\nhelp and the neighbors to hear without incommoding the hotel guests. She\r\nsaid that this took a great burden off her mind, and that now she should\r\nfeel perfectly easy, for now no one could complain about being mixed up\r\nwith the servants and the natives, and yet every one could hear perfectly.\r\n\r\nShe could not rest until she had sent for Homos and told him of this\r\nadmirable arrangement. I did not know whether to be glad or not when he\r\ninstantly told her that, if there was to be any such separation of his\r\nauditors, in recognition of our class distinctions, he must refuse to\r\nspeak at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what in the world are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed out, and the tears came\r\ninto her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the money for all your tickets?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a sort of\r\ndisgust for the whole transaction in his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and more, too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a soul, in the hotel or out\r\nof it, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid at least a dollar to hear you; and that makes it\r\nso very embarrassing. Oh, _dear_ Mr. Homos! You won\xe2\x80\x99t be so implacably\r\nhigh-principled as all that! Think that you are doing it for the house of\r\nGawd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman made me sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen no one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9ccan feel aggrieved, or unfairly used,\r\nif I say what I have to say in the open air, where all can listen equally,\r\nwithout any manner of preference or distinction. We will go up to the edge\r\nof the grove overlooking the tennis-court, and hold our meeting there, as\r\nthe Altrurian meetings are always held, with the sky for a roof, and with\r\nno walls but the horizon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Makely. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would ever have thought you were\r\nso practical, Mr. Homos? I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re an Altrurian, after all; I\r\nbelieve you are an American in disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian turned away, without making any response to this flattering\r\nattribution of our nationality to him; but Mrs. Makely had not waited for\r\nany. She had flown off, and I next saw her attacking the landlord, with\r\nsuch apparent success that he slapped himself on the leg and vanished, and\r\nimmediately the porters and bell-boys and all the men-servants began\r\ncarrying out chairs to the tennis-court, which was already well set round\r\nwith benches. In a little while the whole space was covered, and settees\r\nwere placed well up the ground toward the grove.\r\n\r\nBy half-past two the guests of the hotel came out and took the best seats,\r\nas by right, and the different tallyhoes and mountain wagons began to\r\narrive from the other hotels, with their silly hotel cries, and their gay\r\ngroups dismounted and dispersed themselves over the tennis-court until all\r\nthe chairs were taken. It was fine to see how the natives and the trainmen\r\nand the hotel servants, with an instinctive perception of the proprieties,\r\nyielded these places to their superiors, and, after the summer folks were\r\nall seated, scattered themselves on the grass and the pine-needles about\r\nthe border of the grove. I should have liked to instance the fact to the\r\nAltrurian, as a proof that this sort of subordination was a part of human\r\nnature, and that a principle which pervaded our civilization, after the\r\ndemocratic training of our whole national life, must be divinely\r\nimplanted. But there was no opportunity for me to speak with him after the\r\nfact had accomplished itself, for by this time he had taken his place in\r\nfront of a little clump of low pines and was waiting for the assembly to\r\nquiet itself before he began to speak. I do not think there could have\r\nbeen less than five hundred present, and the scene had that accidental\r\npicturesqueness which results from the grouping of all sorts of faces and\r\ncostumes. Many of our ladies had pretty hats and brilliant parasols, but I\r\nmust say that the soberer tone of some of the old farm-wives\xe2\x80\x99 brown\r\ncalicoes and outdated bonnets contributed to enrich the coloring, and\r\nthere was a certain gayety in the sunny glisten of the men\xe2\x80\x99s straw hats\r\neverywhere that was very good.\r\n\r\nThe sky overhead was absolutely stainless, and the light of the cool\r\nafternoon sun streamed upon the slopes of the solemn mountains to the\r\neast. The tall pines in the background blackened themselves against the\r\nhorizon; nearer they showed more and more decidedly their bluish green,\r\nand the yellow of the newly fallen needles painted their aisles deep into\r\nthe airy shadows.\r\n\r\nA little wind stirred their tops, and for a moment, just before the\r\nAltrurian began to speak, drew from them an organ-tone that melted\r\ndelicately away as his powerful voice rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not give you a clear account of the present state of things in my\r\ncountry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian began, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout first telling you something of our\r\nconditions before the time of our Evolution. It seems to be the law of all\r\nlife that nothing can come to fruition without dying and seeming to make\r\nan end. It must be sown in corruption before it can be raised in\r\nincorruption. The truth itself must perish to our senses before it can\r\nlive to our souls; the Son of Man must suffer upon the cross before we can\r\nknow the Son, of God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so with His message to the world, which we received in the old\r\ntime as an ideal realized by the earliest Christians, who loved one\r\nanother and who had all things common. The apostle cast away upon our\r\nheathen coasts won us with the story of this first Christian republic, and\r\nhe established a commonwealth of peace and good-will among us in its\r\nlikeness. That commonwealth perished, just as its prototype perished, or\r\nseemed to perish; and long ages of civic and economic warfare succeeded,\r\nwhen every man\xe2\x80\x99s hand was against his neighbor, and might was the rule\r\nthat got itself called right. Religion ceased to be the hope of this\r\nworld, and became the vague promise of the next. We descended into the\r\nvalley of the shadow, and dwelt amid chaos for ages before we groped again\r\ninto the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first glimmerings were few and indistinct, but men formed themselves\r\nabout the luminous points here and there, and, when these broke and\r\ndispersed into lesser gleams, still men formed themselves about each of\r\nthem. There arose a system of things better, indeed, than that darkness,\r\nbut full of war and lust and greed, in which the weak rendered homage to\r\nthe strong, and served them in the field and in the camp, and the strong\r\nin turn gave the weak protection against the other strong. It was a juggle\r\nin which the weak did not see that their safety was, after all, from\r\nthemselves; but it was an image of peace, however false and fitful, and it\r\nendured for a time. It endured for a limited time, if we measure by the\r\nlife of the race; it endured for an unlimited time if we measure by the\r\nlives of the men who were born and died while it endured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that disorder, cruel and fierce and stupid, which endured because it\r\nsometimes masked itself as order, did at last pass away. Here and there\r\none of the strong overpowered the rest; then the strong became fewer and\r\nfewer, and in their turn they all yielded to a supreme lord, and\r\nthroughout the land there was one rule, as it was called then, or one\r\nmisrule, as we should call it now. This rule, or this misrule, continued\r\nfor ages more; and again, in the immortality of the race, men toiled and\r\nstruggled, and died without the hope of better things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the time came when the long nightmare was burst with the vision of a\r\nfuture in which all men were the law, and not one man, or any less number\r\nof men than all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor dumb beast of humanity rose, and the throne tumbled, and the\r\nsceptre was broken, and the crown rolled away into that darkness of the\r\npast. We thought that heaven had descended to us, and that liberty,\r\nequality, and fraternity were ours. We could not see what should again\r\nalienate us from one another, or how one brother could again oppress\r\nanother. With a free field and no favor we believed we should prosper on\r\ntogether, and there would be peace and plenty for all. We had the republic\r\nagain after so many ages now, and the republic, as we knew it in our dim\r\nannals, was brotherhood and universal happiness. All but a very few, who\r\nprophesied evil of our lawless freedom, were wrapped in a delirium of\r\nhope. Men\xe2\x80\x99s minds and men\xe2\x80\x99s hands were suddenly released to an activity\r\nunheard of before. Invention followed invention; our rivers and seas\r\nbecame the warp of commerce where the steam-sped shuttles carried the woof\r\nof enterprise to and fro with tireless celerity; machines to save labor\r\nmultiplied themselves as if they had been procreative forces, and wares of\r\nevery sort were produced with incredible swiftness and cheapness. Money\r\nseemed to flow from the ground; vast fortunes \xe2\x80\x98rose like an exhalation,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas your Milton says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first we did not know that they were the breath of the nethermost pits\r\nof hell, and that the love of money, which was becoming universal with us,\r\nwas filling the earth with the hate of men. It was long before we came to\r\nrealize that in the depths of our steamships were those who fed the fires\r\nwith their lives, and that our mines from which we dug our wealth were the\r\ngraves of those who had died to the free light and air, without finding\r\nthe rest of death. We did not see that the machines for saving labor were\r\nmonsters that devoured women and children, and wasted men at the bidding\r\nof the power which no man must touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, we thought we must not touch it, for it called itself prosperity\r\nand wealth and the public good, and it said that it gave bread, and it\r\nimpudently bade the toiling myriads consider what would become of them if\r\nit took away their means of wearing themselves out in its service. It\r\ndemanded of the state absolute immunity and absolute impunity, the right\r\nto do its will wherever and however it would, without question from the\r\npeople who were the final law. It had its way, and under its rule we\r\nbecame the richest people under the sun. The Accumulation, as we called\r\nthis power, because we feared to call it by its true name, rewarded its\r\nown with gains of twenty, of a hundred, of a thousand per cent., and to\r\nsatisfy its need, to produce the labor that operated its machines, there\r\ncame into existence a hapless race of men who bred their kind for its\r\nservice, and whose little ones were its prey almost from their cradles.\r\nThen the infamy became too great, and the law, the voice of the people, so\r\nlong guiltily silent, was lifted in behalf of those who had no helper. The\r\nAccumulation came under control for the first time, and could no longer\r\nwork its slaves twenty hours a day amid perils to life and limb from its\r\nmachinery and in conditions that forbade them decency and morality. The\r\ntime of a hundred and a thousand per cent. passed; but still the\r\nAccumulation demanded immunity and impunity, and, in spite of its\r\nconviction of the enormities it had practised, it declared itself the only\r\nmeans of civilization and progress. It began to give out that it was\r\ntimid, though its history was full of the boldest frauds and crimes, and\r\nit threatened to withdraw itself if it were ruled or even crossed; and\r\nagain it had its way, and we seemed to prosper more and more. The land was\r\nfilled with cities where the rich flaunted their splendor in palaces, and\r\nthe poor swarmed in squalid tenements. The country was drained of its life\r\nand force, to feed the centres of commerce and industry. The whole land\r\nwas bound together with a network of iron roads that linked the factories\r\nand founderies to the fields and mines, and blasted the landscape with the\r\nenterprise that spoiled the lives of men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, all at once, when its work seemed perfect and its dominion sure,\r\nthe Accumulation was stricken with consciousness of the lie always at its\r\nheart. It had hitherto cried out for a free field and no favor, for\r\nunrestricted competition; but, in truth, it had never prospered except as\r\na monopoly. Whenever and wherever competition had play there had been\r\nnothing but disaster to the rival enterprises, till one rose over the\r\nrest. Then there was prosperity for that one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Accumulation began to act upon its new consciousness. The iron roads\r\nunited; the warring industries made peace, each kind under a single\r\nleadership. Monopoly, not competition, was seen to be the beneficent means\r\nof distributing the favors and blessings of the Accumulation to mankind.\r\nBut, as before, there was alternately a glut and dearth of things, and\r\nit often happened that when starving men went ragged through the streets\r\nthe storehouses were piled full of rotting harvests that the farmers\r\ntoiled from dawn till dusk to grow, and the warehouses fed the moth with\r\nthe stuffs that the operative had woven his life into at his loom. Then\r\nfollowed, with a blind and mad succession, a time of famine, when money\r\ncould not buy the super-abundance that vanished, none knew how or why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money itself vanished from time to time, and disappeared into the\r\nvaults of the Accumulation, for no better reason than that for which it\r\npoured itself out at other times. Our theory was that the people--that is\r\nto say, the government of the people--made the people\xe2\x80\x99s money, but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the Accumulation made it and controlled it and juggled\r\nwith it; and now you saw it, and now you did not see it. The government\r\nmade gold coins, but the people had nothing but the paper money that the\r\nAccumulation made. But whether there was scarcity or plenty, the failures\r\nwent on with a continuous ruin that nothing could check, while our larger\r\neconomic life proceeded in a series of violent shocks, which we called\r\nfinancial panics, followed by long periods of exhaustion and recuperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no law in our economy, but as the Accumulation had never cared\r\nfor the nature of law, it did not trouble itself for its name in our order\r\nof things. It had always bought the law it needed for its own use, first\r\nthrough the voter at the polls in the more primitive days, and then, as\r\ncivilization advanced, in the legislatures and the courts. But the\r\ncorruption even of these methods was far surpassed when the era of\r\nconsolidation came, and the necessity for statutes and verdicts and\r\ndecisions became more stringent. Then we had such a burlesque of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d a sharp, nasal voice snarled across the rich, full pipe of\r\nthe Altrurian, and we all instantly looked there. The voice came from an\r\nold farmer, holding himself stiffly up, with his hands in his pockets and\r\nhis lean frame bent toward the speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get to\r\nAltrury? We know all about Ameriky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down again, and it was a moment before the crowd caught on. Then a\r\nyell of delight and a roar of volleyed laughter went up from the lower\r\nclasses, in which, I am sorry to say, my friend the banker joined, so far\r\nas the laughter was concerned. \xe2\x80\x9cGood! That\xe2\x80\x99s it! First-rate!\xe2\x80\x9d came from a\r\nhundred vulgar throats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a perfect shame?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI think some of you\r\ngentlemen ought to say something. What will Mr. Homos think of our\r\ncivilization if we let such interruptions go unrebuked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was sitting between the banker and myself, and her indignation made\r\nhim laugh more and more. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it serves him right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee that he is hoist with his own petard? Let him alone. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the hands\r\nof his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian waited for the tumult to die away, and then he said, gently:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old farmer jerked himself to his feet again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like this: I paid\r\nmy dolla\xe2\x80\x99 to hear about a country where there wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t no co\xe2\x80\x99perations nor\r\nno monop\xe2\x80\x99lies nor no buyin\xe2\x80\x99 up cou\xe2\x80\x99ts; and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t agoin\xe2\x80\x99 to have no\r\nallegory shoved down my throat, instead of a true history, noways. I know\r\nall about how it is _here_. Fi\xe2\x80\x99st, run their line through your backya\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nand then kill off your cattle, and keep kerryin\xe2\x80\x99 on it up from cou\xe2\x80\x99t to\r\ncou\xe2\x80\x99t, till there ain\xe2\x80\x99t hide or hair on \xe2\x80\x98em left--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, set down, set down! Let the man go on! He\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all right with\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the construction gang called out; but the farmer stood his\r\nground, and I could hear him through the laughing and shouting keep saying\r\nsomething, from time to time, about not wanting to pay no dolla\xe2\x80\x99 for no\r\ntalk about co\xe2\x80\x99perations and monop\xe2\x80\x99lies that we had right under our own\r\nnoses the whole while, and, you might say, in your very bread-troughs;\r\ntill, at last, I saw Reuben Camp make his way toward him, and, after an\r\nenergetic expostulation, turn to leave him again.\r\n\r\nThen he faltered out, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d and dropped out of sight\r\nin the group he had risen from. I fancied his wife scolding him there, and\r\nall but shaking him in public.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cto have any one\r\nbelieve that I have not been giving you a _bona fide_ account of\r\nconditions in my country before the Evolution, when we first took the name\r\nof Altruria in our great, peaceful campaign against the Accumulation. As\r\nfor offering you any allegory or travesty of your own conditions, I will\r\nsimply say that I do not know them well enough to do so intelligently.\r\nBut, whatever they are, God forbid that the likeness which you seem to\r\nrecognize should ever go so far as the desperate state of things which we\r\nfinally reached. I will not trouble you with details; in fact, I have been\r\nafraid that I had already treated of our affairs too abstractly; but,\r\nsince your own experience furnishes you the means of seizing my meaning, I\r\nwill go on as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand me when I explain that the Accumulation had not\r\nerected itself into the sovereignty with us unopposed. The working-men,\r\nwho suffered most from its oppression had early begun to band themselves\r\nagainst it, with the instinct of self-preservation, first trade by trade\r\nand art by art, and then in congresses and federations of the trades and\r\narts, until finally they enrolled themselves in one vast union, which\r\nincluded all the working-men, whom their necessity or their interest did\r\nnot leave on the side of the Accumulation. This beneficent and generous\r\nassociation of the weak for the sake of the weakest did not accomplish\r\nitself fully till the baleful instinct of the Accumulation had reduced the\r\nmonopolies to one vast monopoly, till the stronger had devoured the weaker\r\namong its members, and the supreme agent stood at the head of our affairs,\r\nin everything but name, our imperial ruler. We had hugged so long the\r\ndelusion of each man for himself that we had suffered all realty to be\r\ntaken from us. The Accumulation owned the land as well as the mines under\r\nit and the shops over it; the Accumulation owned the seas and the ships\r\nthat sailed the seas, and the fish that swam in their depths; it owned\r\ntransportation and distribution, and the wares and products that were to\r\nbe carried to and fro; and, by a logic irresistible and inexorable, the\r\nAccumulation _was_, and we were _not_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Accumulation, too, had forgotten something. It had found it so\r\neasy to buy legislatures and courts that it did not trouble itself about\r\nthe polls. It left us the suffrage, and let us amuse ourselves with the\r\nperiodical election of the political clay images which it manipulated and\r\nmoulded to any shape and effect at its pleasure. The Accumulation knew\r\nthat it was the sovereignty, whatever figure-head we called president or\r\ngovernor or mayor: we had other names for these officials, but I use their\r\nanalogues for the sake of clearness, and I hope my good friend over there\r\nwill not think I am still talking about America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the old farmer called back, without rising, \xe2\x80\x9cwe hain\xe2\x80\x99t got there\r\nquite yit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d said a trainman. \xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time. Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the\r\nAltrurian.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere had been, from the beginning, an almost ceaseless struggle between\r\nthe Accumulation and the proletariate. The Accumulation always said that\r\nit was the best friend of the proletariate, and it denounced, through the\r\npress which it controlled, the proletarian leaders who taught that it was\r\nthe enemy of the proletariate, and who stirred up strikes and tumults of\r\nall sorts, for higher wages and fewer hours. But the friend of the\r\nproletariate, whenever occasion served, treated the proletariate like a\r\ndeadly enemy. In seasons of overproduction, as it was called, it locked\r\nthe workmen out or laid them off, and left their families to starve, or\r\nran light work and claimed the credit of public benefactors for running at\r\nall. It sought every chance to reduce wages; it had laws passed to forbid\r\nor cripple the workmen in their strikes; and the judges convicted them of\r\nconspiracy, and wrested the statutes to their hurt, in cases where there\r\nhad been no thought of embarrassing them, even among the legislators. God\r\nforbid that you should ever come to such a pass in America; but, if you\r\never should, God grant that you may find your way out as simply as we did\r\nat last, when freedom had perished in everything but name among us, and\r\njustice had become a mockery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Accumulation had advanced so smoothly, so lightly, in all its steps\r\nto the supreme power, and had at last so thoroughly quelled the uprisings\r\nof the proletariate, that it forgot one thing: it forgot the despised and\r\nneglected suffrage. The ballot, because it had been so easy to annul its\r\neffect, had been left in the people\xe2\x80\x99s hands; and when, at last, the\r\nleaders of the proletariate ceased to counsel strikes, or any form of\r\nresistance to the Accumulation that could be tormented into the likeness\r\nof insurrection against the government, and began to urge them to attack\r\nit in the political way, the deluge that swept the Accumulation out of\r\nexistence came trickling and creeping over the land. It appeared first in\r\nthe country, a spring from the ground; then it gathered head in the\r\nvillages; then it swelled to a torrent in the cities. I cannot stay to\r\ntrace its course; but suddenly, one day, when the Accumulation\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of\r\na certain power became too gross, it was voted out of that power. You will\r\nperhaps be interested to know that it was with the telegraphs that the\r\nrebellion against the Accumulation began, and the government was forced,\r\nby the overwhelming majority which the proletariate sent to our\r\nparliament, to assume a function which the Accumulation had impudently\r\nusurped. Then the transportation of smaller and more perishable wares--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d a voice called--\xe2\x80\x9cexpress business. Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas legislated a function of the post-office,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all transportation was taken into the hands of the political\r\ngovernment, which had always been accused of great corruption in its\r\nadministration, but which showed itself immaculately pure compared with\r\nthe Accumulation. The common ownership of mines necessarily followed, with\r\nan allotment of lands to any one who wished to live by tilling the land;\r\nbut not a foot of the land was remitted to private hands for the purposes\r\nof selfish pleasure or the exclusion of any other from the landscape. As\r\nall business had been gathered into the grasp of the Accumulation, and the\r\nmanufacture of everything they used and the production of everything that\r\nthey ate was in the control of the Accumulation, its transfer to the\r\ngovernment was the work of a single clause in the statute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Accumulation, which had treated the first menaces of resistance with\r\ncontempt, awoke to its peril too late. When it turned to wrest the\r\nsuffrage from the proletariate, at the first election where it attempted\r\nto make head against them, it was simply snowed under, as your picturesque\r\nphrase is. The Accumulation had no voters, except the few men at its head\r\nand the creatures devoted to it by interest and ignorance. It seemed, at\r\none moment, as if it would offer an armed resistance to the popular will,\r\nbut, happily, that moment of madness passed. Our Evolution was\r\naccomplished without a drop of bloodshed, and the first great political\r\nbrotherhood, the commonwealth of Altruria, was founded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I had time to go into a study of some of the curious phases\r\nof the transformation from a civility in which the people lived _upon_\r\neach other to one in which they lived _for_ each other. There is a famous\r\npassage in the inaugural message of our first Altrurian president which\r\ncompares the new civic consciousness with that of a disembodied spirit\r\nreleased to the life beyond this and freed from all the selfish cares\r\nand greeds of the flesh. But perhaps I shall give a sufficiently clear\r\nnotion of the triumph of the change among us when I say that within half\r\na decade after the fall of the old plutocratic oligarchy one of the chief\r\ndirectors of the Accumulation publicly expressed his gratitude to God\r\nthat the Accumulation had passed away forever. You will realize the\r\nimportance of such an expression in recalling the declarations some of\r\nyour slave-holders have made since the Civil War, that they would not have\r\nslavery restored for any earthly consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now, after this preamble, which has been so much longer than I meant\r\nit to be, how shall I give you a sufficiently just conception of the\r\nexisting Altruria, the actual state from which I come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d came the nasal of the old farmer again, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what we are here\r\nfur. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a copper to know all you went through beforehand.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too dumn like what we have been through ourselves, as fur as heard\r\nfrom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shout of laughter went up from most of the crowd, but the Altrurian did\r\nnot seem to see any fun in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you, as well as I can, what Altruria is\r\nlike; but, in the first place, you will have to cast out of your minds all\r\nimages of civilization with which your experience has filled them. For a\r\ntime the shell of the old Accumulation remained for our social habitation,\r\nand we dwelt in the old competitive and monopolistic forms after the life\r\nhad gone out of them--that is, we continued to live in populous cities,\r\nand we toiled to heap up riches for the moth to corrupt, and we slaved on\r\nin making utterly useless things, merely because we had the habit of\r\nmaking them to sell. For a while we made the old sham things, which\r\npretended to be useful things and were worse than the confessedly useless\r\nthings. I will give you an illustration from the trades, which you will\r\nall understand. The proletariate, in the competitive and monopolistic\r\ntime, used to make a kind of shoes for the proletariate, or the women of\r\nthe proletariate, which looked like fine shoes of the best quality. It\r\ntook just as much work to make these shoes as to make the best fine shoes;\r\nbut they were shams through and through. They wore out in a week, and the\r\npeople called them, because they were bought fresh for every Sunday--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSat\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99y-night shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the old farmer. \xe2\x80\x9cI know \xe2\x80\x98em. My gals buy\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em. Half-dolla\xe2\x80\x99 a pai\xe2\x80\x99, and not wo\xe2\x80\x99th the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Altrurian, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were a cheat and a lie in every way,\r\nand under the new system it was not possible, when public attention\r\nwas called to the fact, to continue the falsehood they embodied. As soon\r\nas the Saturday-night shoes realized itself to the public conscience,\r\nan investigation began, and it was found that the principle of the\r\nSaturday-night shoe underlay half our industries and made half the work\r\nthat was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen an immense reform took place. We renounced, in the most solemn\r\nconvocation of the whole economy, the principle of the Saturday-night\r\nshoe, and those who had spent their lives in producing sham shoes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, rising from his seat near us and addressing the\r\nspeaker, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad to know what became of the worthy and\r\nindustrious operatives who were thrown out of employment by this explosion\r\nof economic virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were set to work making honest shoes;\r\nand, as it took no more time to make a pair of honest shoes which lasted a\r\nyear than it took to make a pair of dishonest shoes that lasted a week,\r\nthe amount of labor in shoemaking was at once enormously reduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that. What became of the\r\nshoemakers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey joined the vast army of other laborers who had been employed,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in the fabrication of fraudulent wares. These\r\nshoemakers--lasters, button-holers, binders, and so on--no longer wore\r\nthemselves out over their machines. One hour sufficed where twelve hours\r\nwere needed before, and the operatives were released to the happy labor of\r\nthe fields, where no one with us toils killingly, from dawn till dusk, but\r\ndoes only as much work as is needed to keep the body in health. We had a\r\ncontinent to refine and beautify; we had climates to change and seasons to\r\nmodify, a whole system of meteorology to readjust, and the public works\r\ngave employment to the multitudes emancipated from the soul-destroying\r\nservice of shams. I can scarcely give you a notion of the vastness of the\r\nimprovements undertaken and carried through, or still in process of\r\naccomplishment. But a single one will, perhaps, afford a sufficient\r\nillustration. Our southeast coast, from its vicinity to the pole, had\r\nalways suffered from a winter of antarctic rigor; but our first president\r\nconceived the plan of cutting off a peninsula, which kept the equatorial\r\ncurrent from making in to our shores; and the work was begun in his term,\r\nthough the entire strip, twenty miles in width and ninety-three in length,\r\nwas not severed before the end of the first Altrurian decade. Since that\r\ntime the whole region of our southeastern coast has enjoyed the climate of\r\nyour Mediterranean countries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not only the makers of fraudulent things who were released to\r\nthese useful and wholesome labors, but those who had spent themselves in\r\ncontriving ugly and stupid and foolish things were set free to the public\r\nemployment. The multitude of these monstrosities and iniquities was as\r\ngreat as that of the shams--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I lost some words, for the professor leaned over and whispered to me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has got _that_ out of William Morris. Depend upon it, the man is a\r\nhumbug. He is not an Altrurian at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess that my heart misgave me; but I signalled the professor to be\r\nsilent, and again gave the Altrurian--if he was an Altrurian--my whole\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the labor of the community was\r\nemancipated from the bondage of the false to the free service of the true,\r\nit was also, by an inevitable implication, dedicated to beauty and rescued\r\nfrom the old slavery to the ugly, the stupid, and the trivial. The thing\r\nthat was honest and useful became, by the operation of a natural law, a\r\nbeautiful thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce we had not time enough to make things beautiful, we were so\r\noverworked in making false and hideous things to sell; but now we had all\r\nthe time there was, and a glad emulation arose among the trades and\r\noccupations to the end that everything done should be done finely as well\r\nas done honestly. The artist, the man of genius, who worked from the love\r\nof his work, became the normal man, and in the measure of his ability and\r\nof his calling each wrought in the spirit of the artist. We got back the\r\npleasure of doing a thing beautifully, which was God\xe2\x80\x99s primal blessing\r\nupon all His working children, but which we had lost in the horrible days\r\nof our need and greed. There is not a working-man within the sound of my\r\nvoice but has known this divine delight, and would gladly know it always\r\nif he only had the time. Well, now we had the time, the Evolution had\r\ngiven us the time, and in all Altruria there was not a furrow driven or a\r\nswath mown, not a hammer struck on house or on ship, not a stitch sewn or\r\na stone laid, not a line written or a sheet printed, not a temple raised\r\nor an engine built, but it was done with an eye to beauty as well as to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as we were freed from the necessity of preying upon one another,\r\nwe found that there was no hurry. The good work would wait to be well\r\ndone; and one of the earliest effects of the Evolution was the disuse of\r\nthe swift trains which had traversed the continent, night and day, that\r\none man might overreach another, or make haste to undersell his rival, or\r\nseize some advantage of him, or plot some profit to his loss. Nine-tenths\r\nof the railroads, which in the old times had ruinously competed, and then,\r\nin the hands of the Accumulation, had been united to impoverish and\r\noppress the people, fell into disuse. The commonwealth operated the few\r\nlines that were necessary for the collection of materials and the\r\ndistribution of manufactures, and for pleasure travel and the affairs of\r\nstate; but the roads that had been built to invest capital, or parallel\r\nother roads, or \xe2\x80\x98make work,\xe2\x80\x99 as it was called, or to develop resources,\r\nor boom localities, were suffered to fall into ruin; the rails were\r\nstripped from the landscape, which they had bound as with shackles, and\r\nthe road-beds became highways for the use of kindly neighborhoods, or\r\nnature recovered them wholly and hid the memory of their former abuse in\r\ngrass and flowers and wild vines. The ugly towns that they had forced into\r\nbeing, as Frankenstein was fashioned, from the materials of the charnel,\r\nand that had no life in or from the good of the community, soon tumbled\r\ninto decay. The administration used parts of them in the construction of\r\nthe villages in which the Altrurians now mostly live; but generally these\r\ntowns were built of materials so fraudulent, in form so vile, that it was\r\njudged best to burn them. In this way their sites were at once purified\r\nand obliterated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had, of course, a great many large cities under the old egoistic\r\nconditions, which increased and fattened upon the country, and fed their\r\ncancerous life with fresh infusions of its blood. We had several cities of\r\nhalf a million, and one of more than a million; we had a score of them\r\nwith a population of a hundred thousand or more. We were very proud of\r\nthem, and vaunted them as a proof of our unparalleled prosperity, though\r\nreally they never were anything but congeries of millionaires and the\r\nwretched creatures who served them and supplied them. Of course, there was\r\neverywhere the appearance of enterprise and activity, but it meant final\r\nloss for the great mass of the business men, large and small, and final\r\ngain for the millionaires. These and their parasites dwelt together, the\r\nrich starving the poor and the poor plundering and misgoverning the rich;\r\nand it was the intolerable suffering in the cities that chiefly hastened\r\nthe fall of the old Accumulation and the rise of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost from the moment of the Evolution the competitive and monopolistic\r\ncentres of population began to decline. In the clear light of the new\r\norder it was seen that they were not fit dwelling-places for men, either\r\nin the complicated and luxurious palaces where the rich fenced themselves\r\nfrom their kind, or in the vast tenements, towering height upon height,\r\nten and twelve stories up, where the swarming poor festered in vice and\r\nsickness and famine. If I were to tell you of the fashion of those cities\r\nof our egoistic epoch, how the construction was one error from the first,\r\nand every correction of an error bred a new defect, I should make you\r\nlaugh, I should make you weep. We let them fall to ruin as quickly as they\r\nwould, and their sites are still so pestilential, after the lapse of\r\ncenturies, that travelers are publicly guarded against them. Ravening\r\nbeasts and poisonous reptiles lurk in those abodes of the riches and the\r\npoverty that are no longer known to our life. A part of one of the less\r\nmalarial of the old cities, however, is maintained by the commonwealth in\r\nthe form of its prosperity, and is studied by antiquarians for the\r\ninstruction, and by moralists for the admonition, it affords. A section of\r\na street is exposed, and you see the foundations of the houses; you see\r\nthe filthy drains that belched into the common sewers, trapped and\r\nretrapped to keep the poison gases down; you see the sewers that rolled\r\ntheir loathsome tides under the streets, amid a tangle of gas-pipes,\r\nsteam-pipes, water-pipes, telegraph-wires, electric lighting-wires,\r\nelectric motor-wires, and grip-cables--all without a plan, but makeshifts,\r\nexpedients, devices, to repair and evade the fundamental mistake of having\r\nany such cities at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are now no cities in Altruria, in your meaning, but there are\r\ncapitals, one for each of the regions of our country and one for the whole\r\ncommonwealth. These capitals are for the transaction of public affairs, in\r\nwhich every citizen of Altruria is schooled, and they are the residences\r\nof the administrative officials, who are alternated every year, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest. A public employment with us is of no greater honor\r\nor profit than any other, for with our absolute economic equality there\r\ncan be no ambition, and there is no opportunity for one citizen to\r\noutshine another. But as the capitals are the centres of all the arts,\r\nwhich we consider the chief of our public affairs, they are oftenest\r\nfrequented by poets, actors, painters, sculptors, musicians, and\r\narchitects. We regard all artists, who are in a sort creators, as the\r\nhuman type which is likest the divine, and we try to conform our whole\r\nindustrial life to the artistic temperament. Even in the labors of the\r\nfield and shop, which are obligatory upon all, we study the inspiration of\r\nthis temperament, and in the voluntary pursuits we allow it full control.\r\nEach, in these, follows his fancy as to what he shall do, and when he\r\nshall do it, or whether he shall do anything at all. In the capitals are\r\nthe universities, theatres, galleries, museums, cathedrals, laboratories\r\nand conservatories, and the appliances of every art and science, as well\r\nas the administration buildings; and beauty as well as use is studied in\r\nevery edifice. Our capitals are as clean and quiet and healthful as the\r\ncountry, and these advantages are secured simply by the elimination of the\r\nhorse, an animal which we should be as much surprised to find in the\r\nstreets of a town as the plesiosaurus or the pterodactyl. All\r\ntransportation in the capitals, whether for pleasure or business, is by\r\nelectricity, and swift electrical expresses connect the capital of each\r\nregion with the villages which radiate from it to the cardinal points.\r\nThese expresses run at the rate of a hundred and fifty miles an hour, and\r\nthey enable the artist, the scientist, the literary man, of the remotest\r\nhamlet, to visit the capital (when he is not actually resident there in\r\nsome public use) every day, after the hours of the obligatory industries;\r\nor, if he likes, he may remain there a whole week or fortnight, giving six\r\nhours a day instead of three to the obligatories, until the time is made\r\nup. In case of very evident merit, or for the purpose of allowing him to\r\ncomplete some work requiring continuous application, a vote of the local\r\nagents may release him from the obligatories indefinitely. Generally,\r\nhowever, our artists prefer not to ask this, but avail themselves of the\r\nstated means we have of allowing them to work at the obligatories, and get\r\nthe needed exercise and variety of occupation in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not think it well to connect the hamlets on the different lines of\r\nradiation from the capital, except by the good country roads which\r\ntraverse each region in every direction. The villages are mainly inhabited\r\nby those who prefer a rural life; they are farming villages; but in\r\nAltruria it can hardly be said that one man is more a farmer than another.\r\nWe do not like to distinguish men by their callings; we do not speak of\r\nthe poet This or the shoemaker That, for the poet may very likely be a\r\nshoemaker in the obligatories, and the shoemaker a poet in the\r\nvoluntaries. If it can be said that one occupation is honored above\r\nanother with us, it is that which we all share, and that is the\r\ncultivation of the earth. We believe that this, when not followed\r\nslavishly, or for gain, brings man into the closest relations to the\r\nDeity, through a grateful sense of the divine bounty, and that it not only\r\nawakens a natural piety in him, but that it endears to the worker that\r\npiece of soil which he tills, and so strengthens his love of home. The\r\nhome is the very heart of the Altrurian system, and we do not think it\r\nwell that people should be away from their homes very long or very often.\r\nIn the competitive and monopolistic times men spent half their days in\r\nracing back and forth across our continent; families were scattered by the\r\nchase for fortune, and there was a perpetual paying and repaying of\r\nvisits. One-half the income of those railroads which we let fall into\r\ndisuse came from the ceaseless unrest. Now a man is born and lives and\r\ndies among his own kindred, and the sweet sense of neighborhood, of\r\nbrotherhood, which blessed the golden age of the first Christian republic\r\nis ours again. Every year the people of each region meet one another on\r\nEvolution day, in the regionic capital; once in four years they all visit\r\nthe national capital. There is no danger of the decay of patriotism among\r\nus; our country is our mother, and we love her as it is impossible to love\r\nthe step-mother that a competitive or monopolistic nation must be to its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only touch upon this feature and that of our system as I chance to\r\nthink of it. If any of you are curious about others, I shall be glad to\r\nanswer questions as well as I can. We have, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian\r\nproceeded, after a little indefinite pause, to let any speak who liked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno money in your sense. As the whole people control affairs, no man works\r\nfor another, and no man pays another. Every one does his share of labor,\r\nand receives his share of food, clothing, and shelter, which is neither\r\nmore nor less than another\xe2\x80\x99s. If you can imagine the justice and\r\nimpartiality of a well-ordered family, you can conceive of the social and\r\neconomic life of Altruria. We are, properly speaking, a family rather than\r\na nation like yours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we are somewhat favored by our insular, or continental,\r\nposition; but I do not know that we are more so than you are. Certainly,\r\nhowever, we are self-sufficing in a degree unknown to most European\r\ncountries; and we have within our borders the materials of every comfort\r\nand the resources of every need. We have no commerce with the egoistic\r\nworld, as we call that outside, and I believe that I am the first\r\nAltrurian to visit foreign countries avowedly in my national character,\r\nthough we have always had emissaries living abroad incognito. I hope that\r\nI may say without offence that they find it a sorrowful exile, and that\r\nthe reports of the egoistic world, with its wars, its bankruptcies, its\r\ncivic commotions, and its social unhappiness, do not make us discontented\r\nwith our own condition. Before the Evolution we had completed the round of\r\nyour inventions and discoveries, impelled by the force that drives you on;\r\nand we have since disused most of them as idle and unfit. But we profit,\r\nnow and then, by the advances you make in science, for we are passionately\r\ndevoted to the study of the natural laws, open or occult, under which all\r\nmen have their being. Occasionally an emissary returns with a sum of\r\nmoney, and explains to the students of the national university the\r\nprocesses by which it is lost and won; and at a certain time there was a\r\nmovement for its introduction among us, not for its use as you know it,\r\nbut for a species of counters in games of chance. It was considered,\r\nhowever, to contain an element of danger, and the scheme was discouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing amuses and puzzles our people more than the accounts our\r\nemissaries give of the changes of fashion in the outside world, and of the\r\nruin of soul and body which the love of dress often works. Our own dress,\r\nfor men and for women, is studied, in one ideal of use and beauty, from\r\nthe antique; caprice and vagary in it would be thought an effect of vulgar\r\nvanity. Nothing is worn that is not simple and honest in texture; we do\r\nnot know whether a thing is cheap or dear, except as it is easy or hard to\r\ncome by, and that which is hard to come by is forbidden as wasteful and\r\nfoolish. The community builds the dwellings of the community, and these,\r\ntoo, are of a classic simplicity, though always beautiful and fit in form;\r\nthe splendors of the arts are lavished upon the public edifices, which we\r\nall enjoy in common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this the greatest rehash of \xe2\x80\x98Utopia,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98New Atlantis,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98City of\r\nthe Sun\xe2\x80\x99 that you ever imagined?\xe2\x80\x9d the professor whispered across me to the\r\nbanker. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is a fraud, and a very bungling fraud at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must expose him, when he gets through,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker whispered\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBut the professor could not wait. He got upon his feet and called out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask the gentleman from Altruria a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian blandly assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it short!\xe2\x80\x9d Reuben Camp\xe2\x80\x99s voice broke in, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome here to listen to your questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professor contemptuously ignored him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you occasionally\r\nreceive emissaries from, as well as send them to, the world outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, now and then castaways land on our coasts, and ships out of their\r\nreckonings put in at our ports for water or provision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are they pleased with your system?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I cannot better answer than by saying that they mostly refuse to\r\nleave us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, just as Bacon reports!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean in the _New Atlantis_?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Altrurian. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; it is\r\nastonishing how well Bacon in that book, and Sir Thomas More in his\r\n_Utopia_, have divined certain phases of our civilization and polity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he rather _has_ you, professor,\xe2\x80\x9d the banker whispered, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all those inspired visionaries,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian continued, while the\r\nprofessor sat grimly silent, watching for another chance, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have borne\r\ntestimony of us in their dreams, conceived of states perfect without the\r\ndiscipline of a previous competitive condition. What I thought, however,\r\nmight specially interest you Americans in Altruria is the fact that our\r\neconomy was evolved from one so like that in which you actually have your\r\nbeing. I had even hoped you might feel that, in all these points of\r\nresemblance, America prophesies another Altruria. I know that to some of\r\nyou all that I have told of my country will seem a baseless fabric, with\r\nno more foundation, in fact, than More\xe2\x80\x99s fairy-tale of another land where\r\nmen dealt kindly and justly by one another, and dwelt, a whole nation, in\r\nthe unity and equality of a family. But why should not a part of that\r\nfable have come true in our polity, as another part of it has come true in\r\nyours? When Sir Thomas More wrote that book, he noted with abhorrence the\r\nmonstrous injustice of the fact that men were hanged for small thefts in\r\nEngland; and in the preliminary conversation between its characters he\r\ndenounced the killing of men for any sort of thefts. Now you no longer put\r\nmen to death for theft; you look back upon that cruel code of your mother\r\nEngland with an abhorrence as great as his own. We, for our part, who have\r\nrealized the Utopian dream of brotherly equality, look back with the same\r\nabhorrence upon a state where some were rich and some poor, some taught\r\nand some untaught, some high and some low, and the hardest toil often\r\nfailed to supply a sufficiency of the food which luxury wasted in its\r\nriots. That state seems as atrocious to us as the state which hanged a man\r\nfor stealing a loaf of bread seems to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we do not regret the experience of competition and monopoly. They\r\ntaught us some things in the operation of the industries. The labor-saving\r\ninventions which the Accumulation perverted to money-making we have\r\nrestored to the use intended by their inventors and the Creator of their\r\ninventors. After serving the advantage of socializing the industries which\r\nthe Accumulation effected for its own purposes, we continued the work in\r\nlarge mills and shops, in the interest of the workers, whom we wished to\r\nguard against the evil effects of solitude. But our mills and shops are\r\nbeautiful as well as useful. They look like temples, and they are temples,\r\ndedicated to that sympathy between the divine and human which expresses\r\nitself in honest and exquisite workmanship. They rise amid leafy boscages\r\nbeside the streams, which form their only power; for we have disused steam\r\naltogether, with all the offences to the eye and ear which its use brought\r\ninto the world. Our life is so simple and our needs are so few that the\r\nhand-work of the primitive toilers could easily supply our wants; but\r\nmachinery works so much more thoroughly and beautifully that we have in\r\ngreat measure retained it. Only, the machines that were once the workmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenemies and masters are now their friends and servants; and, if any man\r\nchooses to work alone with his own hands, the state will buy what he makes\r\nat the same price that it sells the wares made collectively. This secures\r\nevery right of individuality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe farm-work, as well as the mill-work and the shop-work, is done by\r\ncompanies of workers; and there is nothing of that loneliness in our woods\r\nand fields which, I understand, is the cause of so much insanity among\r\nyou. It is not good for man to be alone, was the first thought of his\r\nCreator when he considered him, and we act upon this truth in everything.\r\nThe privacy of the family is sacredly guarded in essentials, but the\r\nsocial instinct is so highly developed with us that we like to eat\r\ntogether in large refectories, and we meet constantly to argue and dispute\r\non questions of aesthetics and metaphysics. We do not, perhaps, read so\r\nmany books as you do, for most of our reading, when not for special\r\nresearch, but for culture and entertainment, is done by public readers, to\r\nlarge groups of listeners. We have no social meetings which are not free\r\nto all; and we encourage joking and the friendly give and take of witty\r\nencounters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little hint from Sparta,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the professor.\r\n\r\nThe banker leaned over to whisper to me: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I have seen of your\r\nfriend when offered a piece of American humor, I should fancy the\r\nAltrurian article was altogether different. Upon the whole, I would rather\r\nnot be present at one of their witty encounters, if I were obliged to stay\r\nit out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian had paused to drink a glass of water, and now he went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we try, in everything that does not inconvenience or injure others,\r\nto let every one live the life he likes best. If a man prefers to dwell\r\napart, and have his meals in private for himself alone or for his family,\r\nit is freely permitted; only he must not expect to be served as in public,\r\nwhere service is one of the voluntaries; private service is not permitted;\r\nthose wishing to live alone must wait upon themselves, cook their own\r\nfood, and care for their own tables. Very few, however, wish to withdraw\r\nfrom the public life, for most of the discussions and debates take place\r\nat our mid-day meal, which falls at the end of the obligatory labors, and\r\nis prolonged indefinitely, or as long as people like to chat and joke or\r\nlisten to the reading of some pleasant book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Altruria _there is no hurry_, for no one wishes to outstrip another,\r\nor in any wise surpass him. We are all assured of enough, and are\r\nforbidden any and every sort of superfluity. If any one, after the\r\nobligatories, wishes to be entirely idle, he may be so, but I cannot now\r\nthink of a single person without some voluntary occupation; doubtless\r\nthere are such persons, but I do not know them. It used to be said, in the\r\nold times, that \xe2\x80\x98it was human nature\xe2\x80\x99 to shirk and malinger and loaf, but\r\nwe have found that it is no such thing. We have found that it is human\r\nnature to work cheerfully, willingly, eagerly, at the tasks which all\r\nshare for the supply of the common necessities. In like manner we have\r\nfound out that it is not human nature to hoard and grudge, but that when\r\nthe fear, and even the imagination, of want is taken away, it is human\r\nnature to give and to help generously. We used to say: \xe2\x80\x98A man will lie, or\r\na man will cheat, in his own interest; that is human nature\xe2\x80\x99; but that is\r\nno longer human nature with us, perhaps because no man has any interest to\r\nserve; he has only the interests of others to serve, while others serve\r\nhis. It is in no wise possible for the individual to separate his good\r\nfrom the common good; he is prosperous and happy only as all the rest are\r\nso; and therefore it is not human nature with us for any one to lie in\r\nwait to betray another or seize an advantage. That would be ungentlemanly,\r\nand in Altruria every man is a gentleman and every woman a lady. If you\r\nwill excuse me here for being so frank, I would like to say something by\r\nway of illustration which may be offensive if you take it personally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at our little group, as if he were addressing himself more\r\nespecially to us, and the banker called out, jollily: \xe2\x80\x9cGo on! I guess we\r\ncan stand it,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead!\xe2\x80\x9d came from all sides, from all kinds of\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely this: that as we look back at the old competitive conditions\r\nwe do not see how any man could be a gentleman in them, since a gentleman\r\nmust think first of others, and these conditions _compelled_ every man to\r\nthink first of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence broken by some conscious and hardy laughter, while we\r\neach swallowed this pill as we could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are competitive conditions?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Makely demanded of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ours are competitive conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Homos is much of a\r\ngentleman to say such a thing to an American audience. Or, wait a moment!\r\nAsk him if the same rule applies to women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose, strengthened by the resentment I felt, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand\r\nthat in your former competitive conditions it was also impossible for a\r\nwoman to be a lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professor gave me an applausive nod as I sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cI envy you the\r\nchance of that little dig,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian was thoughtful a moment, and then he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I should\r\nnot say it was. From what we know historically of those conditions in our\r\ncountry, it appears that the great mass of women were not directly\r\naffected by them. They constituted an altruistic dominion of the egoistic\r\nempire, and, except as they were tainted by social or worldly ambitions,\r\nit was possible for every woman to be a lady, even in competitive\r\nconditions. Her instincts were unselfish, and her first thoughts were\r\nnearly always of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Makely jumped to her feet and clapped violently with her fan on the\r\npalm of her left hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThree cheers for Mr. Homos!\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked, and all\r\nthe women took up the cry, supported by all the natives and the\r\nconstruction gang. I fancied these fellows gave their support largely in a\r\nspirit of burlesque; but they gave it robustly, and from that time on,\r\nMrs. Makely led the applause, and they roared in after her.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to follow closely the course of the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s account\r\nof his country, which grew more and more incredible as he went on, and\r\nimplied every insulting criticism of ours. Some one asked him about war in\r\nAltruria, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe very name of our country implies the absence\r\nof war. At the time of the Evolution our country bore to the rest of our\r\ncontinent the same relative proportion that your country bears to your\r\ncontinent. The egoistic nations to the north and the south of us entered\r\ninto an offensive and defensive alliance to put down, the new altruistic\r\ncommonwealth, and declared war against us. Their forces were met at the\r\nfrontier by our entire population in arms, and full of the martial spirit\r\nbred of the constant hostilities of the competitive and monopolistic epoch\r\njust ended. Negotiations began in the face of the imposing demonstration\r\nwe made, and we were never afterward molested by our neighbors, who\r\nfinally yielded to the spectacle of our civilization and united their\r\npolitical and social fate with ours. At present, our whole continent is\r\nAltrurian. For a long time we kept up a system of coast defences, but it\r\nis also a long time since we abandoned these; for it is a maxim with us\r\nthat where every citizen\xe2\x80\x99s life is a pledge of the public safety, that\r\ncountry can never be in danger of foreign enemies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this, as in all other things, we believe ourselves the true followers\r\nof Christ, whose doctrine we seek to make our life as He made it His. We\r\nhave several forms of ritual, but no form of creed, and our religious\r\ndifferences may be said to be aesthetic and temperamental rather than\r\ntheological and essential. We have no denominations, for we fear in this,\r\nas in other matters, to give names to things lest we should cling to the\r\nnames instead of the things. We love the realities, and for this reason we\r\nlook at the life of a man rather than his profession for proof that he is\r\na religious man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been several times asked, during my sojourn among you, what are\r\nthe sources of compassion, of sympathy, of humanity, of charity with us,\r\nif we have not only no want, or fear of want, but not even any economic\r\ninequality. I suppose this is because you are so constantly struck by the\r\nmisery arising from economic inequality and want, or the fear of want,\r\namong yourselves, that you instinctively look in that direction. But have\r\nyou ever seen sweeter compassion, tenderer sympathy, warmer humanity,\r\nheavenlier charity than that shown in the family where all are\r\neconomically equal and no one can want while any other has to give?\r\nAltruria, I say again, is a family, and, as we are mortal, we are still\r\nsubject to those nobler sorrows which God has appointed to men, and which\r\nare so different from the squalid accidents that they have made for\r\nthemselves. Sickness and death call out the most angelic ministries of\r\nlove; and those who wish to give themselves to others may do so without\r\nhinderance from those cares, and even those duties, resting upon men where\r\neach must look out first for himself and for his own. Oh, believe me,\r\nbelieve me, you can know nothing of the divine rapture of self-sacrifice\r\nwhile you must dread the sacrifice of another in it. You are not _free_,\r\nas we are, to do everything for others, for it is your _duty_ to do rather\r\nfor those of your own household!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I hardly know how to speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and here we all began to prick our ears. I prepared myself as well as I\r\ncould for another affront, though I shuddered when the banker hardily\r\ncalled out: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to say anything you wish, Mr. Homos. I, for\r\none, should like to hear you express yourself fully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was always the unexpected, certainly, that happened from the Altrurian.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHaving come to live rightly upon earth, as\r\nwe believe, or having at least ceased to deny God in our statutes and\r\ncustoms, the fear of death, as it once, weighed upon us, has been lifted\r\nfrom our souls. The mystery of it has so far been taken away that we\r\nperceive it as something just and natural. Now that all unkindness has\r\nbeen banished from among us, we can conceive of no such cruelty as death\r\nonce seemed. If we do not know yet the full meaning of death, we know that\r\nthe Creator of it and of us meant mercy and blessing by it. When one dies\r\nwe grieve, but not as those without hope. We do not say that the dead have\r\ngone to a better place, and then selfishly bewail them, for we have the\r\nkingdom of heaven upon earth already, and we know that wherever they go\r\nthey will be homesick for Altruria; and when we think of the years that\r\nmay pass before we meet them again our hearts ache, as theirs must. But\r\nthe presence of the risen Christ in our daily lives is our assurance that\r\nno one ceases to be, and that we shall see our dead again. I cannot\r\nexplain this to you; I can only affirm it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian spoke very solemnly, and a reverent hush fell upon the\r\nassembly. It was broken by the voice of a woman wailing out: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do you\r\nsuppose, if we lived so, we should feel so, too? That I should know my\r\nlittle girl was living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Altrurian.\r\n\r\nTo my vast astonishment, the manufacturer, who sat the farthest from me in\r\nthe same line with Mrs. Makely, the professor, and the banker, rose and\r\nasked, tremulously: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have--have you had any direct communication with\r\nthe other world? Has any disembodied spirit returned to testify of the\r\nlife beyond the grave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professor nodded significantly across Mrs. Makely to me, and then\r\nfrowned and shook his head. I asked her if she knew what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that spiritualism was that poor man\xe2\x80\x99s foible? He lost his\r\nson in a railroad accident, and ever since--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped and gave her attention to the Altrurian, who was replying to\r\nthe manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not need any such testimony. Our life here makes us sure of the\r\nlife there. At any rate, no externation of the supernatural, no objective\r\nmiracle, has been wrought in our behalf. We have had faith to do what we\r\nprayed for, and the prescience of which I speak has been added unto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer asked, as the bereaved mother had asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I lived\r\nso, should I feel so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Altrurian answered: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman quavered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do believe it! I just _know_ it must be\r\ntrue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer shook his head sorrowfully and sat down, and remained\r\nthere, looking at the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what I have said as to our\r\nrealizing the kingdom of heaven on the earth must seem boastful and\r\narrogant. That is what you pray for every day, but you do not believe it\r\npossible for God\xe2\x80\x99s will to be done on earth as it is done in heaven--that\r\nis, you do not if you are like the competitive and monopolistic people we\r\nonce were. We once regarded that petition as a formula vaguely pleasing\r\nto the Deity, but we no more expected His kingdom to come than we expected\r\nHim to give us each day our daily bread; we knew that if we wanted\r\nsomething to eat we should have to hustle for it, and get there first; I\r\nuse the slang of that far-off time, which, I confess, had a vulgar vigor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now everything is changed, and the change has taken place chiefly\r\nfrom one cause--namely, the disuse of money. At first, it was thought that\r\nsome sort of circulating medium _must_ be used, that life could not be\r\ntransacted without it. But life began to go on perfectly well, when each\r\ndwelt in the place assigned him, which was no better and no worse than any\r\nother; and when, after he had given his three hours a day to the\r\nobligatory labors, he had a right to his share of food, light, heat, and\r\nraiment; the voluntary labors, to which he gave much time or little,\r\nbrought him no increase of those necessaries, but only credit and\r\naffection. We had always heard it said that the love of money was the root\r\nof all evil, but we had taken this for a saying, merely; now we realized\r\nit as an active, vital truth. As soon as money was abolished the power to\r\npurchase was gone, and even if there had been any means of buying beyond\r\nthe daily needs, with overwork, the community had no power to sell to the\r\nindividual. No man owned anything, but every man had the right to anything\r\nthat he could use; when he could not use it, his right lapsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the expropriation of the individual the whole vast catalogue of\r\ncrimes against property shrank to nothing. The thief could only steal from\r\nthe community; but if he stole, what was he to do with his booty? It was\r\nstill possible for a depredator to destroy, but few men\xe2\x80\x99s hate is so\r\ncomprehensive as to include all other men, and when the individual could\r\nno longer hurt some other individual in his property destruction ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the many murders done from love of money, or of what money could buy,\r\nwere at an end. Where there was no want, men no longer bartered their\r\nsouls, or women their bodies, for the means to keep themselves alive. The\r\nvices vanished with the crimes, and the diseases almost as largely\r\ndisappeared. People were no longer sickened by sloth and surfeit, or\r\ndeformed and depleted by overwork and famine. They were wholesomely housed\r\nin healthful places, and they were clad fitly for their labor and fitly\r\nfor their leisure; the caprices of vanity were not suffered to attaint the\r\nbeauty of the national dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the stress of superfluous social and business duties, and the\r\nperpetual fear of want which all classes felt, more or less; with the\r\ntumult of the cities and the solitude of the country, insanity had\r\nincreased among us till the whole land was dotted with asylums and the mad\r\nwere numbered by hundreds of thousands. In every region they were an army,\r\nan awful army of anguish and despair. Now they have decreased to a number\r\nso small, and are of a type so mild, that we can hardly count insanity\r\namong our causes of unhappiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have totally eliminated chance from our economic life. There is still\r\na chance that a man will be tall or short in Altruria, that he will be\r\nstrong or weak, well or ill, gay or grave, happy or unhappy in love, but\r\nnone that he will be rich or poor, busy or idle, live splendidly or\r\nmeanly. These stupid and vulgar accidents of human contrivance cannot\r\nbefall us; but I shall not be able to tell you just how or why, or to\r\ndetail the process of eliminating chance. I may say, however, that it\r\nbegan with the nationalization of telegraphs, expresses, railroads, mines,\r\nand all large industries operated by stock companies. This at once struck\r\na fatal blow at the speculation in values, real and unreal, and at the\r\nstock-exchange, or bourse; we had our own name for that gambler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparadise, or gambler\xe2\x80\x99s hell, whose baleful influence penetrated every\r\nbranch of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were still business fluctuations as long as we had business, but\r\nthey were on a smaller and smaller scale, and with the final lapse of\r\nbusiness they necessarily vanished; all economic chance vanished. The\r\nfounders of the commonwealth understood perfectly that business was the\r\nsterile activity of the function interposed between the demand and the\r\nsupply; that it was nothing structural; and they intended its extinction,\r\nand expected it from the moment that money was abolished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all pretty tiresome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor to our immediate party.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why we oblige ourselves to listen to that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s stuff. As\r\nif a civilized state could exist for a day without money or business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on to give his opinion of the Altrurian\xe2\x80\x99s pretended description,\r\nin a tone so audible that it attracted the notice of the nearest group of\r\nrailroad hands, who were listening closely to Homos, and one of them sang\r\nout to the professor: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you wait and let the first man finish?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nanother yelled: \xe2\x80\x9cPut him out!\xe2\x80\x9d and then they all laughed with a humorous\r\nperception of the impossibility of literally executing the suggestion.\r\n\r\nBy the time all was quiet again I heard the Altrurian saying: \xe2\x80\x9cAs to our\r\nsocial life, I cannot describe it in detail, but I can give you some\r\nnotion of its spirit. We make our pleasures civic and public as far as\r\npossible, and the ideal is inclusive and not exclusive. There are, of\r\ncourse, festivities which all cannot share, but our distribution into\r\nsmall communities favors the possibility of all doing so. Our daily life,\r\nhowever, is so largely social that we seldom meet by special invitation or\r\nengagement. When we do, it is with the perfect understanding that the\r\nassemblage confers no social distinction, but is for a momentary\r\nconvenience. In fact, these occasions are rather avoided, recalling, as\r\nthey do, the vapid and tedious entertainments of the competitive epoch,\r\nthe receptions and balls and dinners of a semi-barbaric people striving\r\nfor social prominence by shutting a certain number in and a certain number\r\nout, and overdressing, overfeeding, and overdrinking. Anything\r\npremeditated in the way of a pleasure we think stupid and mistaken; we\r\nlike to meet suddenly, or on the spur of the moment, out-of-doors, if\r\npossible, and arrange a picnic or a dance or a play; and let people come\r\nand go without ceremony. No one is more host than guest; all are hosts and\r\nguests. People consort much according to their tastes--literary, musical,\r\nartistic, scientific, or mechanical--but these tastes are made approaches,\r\nnot barriers; and we find out that we have many more tastes in common than\r\nwas formerly supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, after all, our life is serious, and no one among us is quite happy,\r\nin the general esteem, unless he has dedicated himself, in some special\r\nway, to the general good. Our ideal is not rights, but duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMazzini!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest distinction which any one can enjoy with us is to have found\r\nout some new and signal way of serving the community; and then it is not\r\ngood form for him to seek recognition. The doing any fine thing is the\r\npurest pleasure it can give; applause flatters, but it hurts, too, and our\r\nbenefactors, as we call them, have learned to shun it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are still far from thinking our civilization perfect; but we are sure\r\nthat our civic ideals are perfect. What we have already accomplished is to\r\nhave given a whole continent perpetual peace; to have founded an economy\r\nin which there is no possibility of want; to have killed out political and\r\nsocial ambition; to have disused money and eliminated chance; to have\r\nrealized the brotherhood of the race, and to have outlived the fear of\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Altrurian suddenly stopped with these words and sat down. He had\r\nspoken a long time, and with a fulness which my report gives little notion\r\nof; but, though most of his cultivated listeners were weary, and a good\r\nmany ladies had left their seats and gone back to the hotel, not one of\r\nthe natives, or the work-people of any sort, had stirred; now they\r\nremained a moment motionless and silent before they rose from all parts of\r\nthe field and shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cGo on! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop! Tell us all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw Reuben Camp climb the shoulders of a big fellow near where the\r\nAltrurian had stood; he waved the crowd to silence with out-spread arms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say anything more; he\xe2\x80\x99s tired. But if any man don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s got his dollar\xe2\x80\x99s worth, let him walk up to the door and the\r\nticket-agent will refund him his money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd laughed, and some one shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cGood for you, Reub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamp continued: \xe2\x80\x9cBut our friend here will shake the hand of any man,\r\nwoman, or child that wants to speak to him; and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t wipe it on the\r\ngrass first, either. He\xe2\x80\x99s a _man_! And I want to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nspend the next week with us, at my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, and we shall be glad to\r\nhave you call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd, the rustic and ruder part of it, cheered and cheered till the\r\nmountain echoes answered; then a railroader called for three times three,\r\nwith a tiger, and got it. The guests of the hotel broke away and went\r\ntoward the house over the long shadows of the meadow. The lower classes\r\npressed forward, on Camp\xe2\x80\x99s invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you ever hear a more disgusting rigmarole?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Makely,\r\nas our little group halted indecisively about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all those imaginary commonwealths to draw upon, from Plato, through\r\nMore, Bacon, and Campanella, down to Bellamy and Morris, he has\r\nconstructed the shakiest effigy ever made of old clothes stuffed with\r\nstraw,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer was silent. The banker said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He grappled\r\npretty boldly with your insinuations. That frank declaration that Altruria\r\nwas all these pretty soap-bubble worlds solidified was rather fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Makely. The lawyer and the minister came\r\ntoward us from where they had been sitting together. She called out to\r\nthem: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the world didn\xe2\x80\x99t one of your gentlemen get up and propose a\r\nvote of thanks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty with me is,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has rendered\r\nAltruria incredible. I have no doubt that he is an Altrurian, but I doubt\r\nvery much if he comes from anywhere in particular, and I find this quite a\r\nblow, for we had got Altruria nicely located on the map, and were\r\nbeginning to get accounts of it in the newspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is just exactly the way I feel about it,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Makely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think there ought to have been a vote of thanks, Mr.\r\nBullion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly. The fellow was immensely amusing, and you must have got a\r\nlot of money by him. It was an oversight not to make him a formal\r\nacknowledgment of some kind. If we offered him money, he would have to\r\nleave it all behind him here when he went home to Altruria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as _we_ do when we go to heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested; the banker did not\r\nanswer, and I instantly felt that in the presence of the minister my\r\nremark was out of taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Makely, who had a leathery\r\ninsensibility to everything but the purpose possessing her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we ought\r\nat least to go and say something to him personally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think we ought,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, and we all walked up to where\r\nthe Altrurian stood, still thickly surrounded by the lower classes, who\r\nwere shaking hands with him and getting in a word with him now and then.\r\n\r\nOne of the construction gang said, carelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo all-rail route to\r\nAltruria, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Homos, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a far sea voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind working my passage, if you think they\xe2\x80\x99d let me\r\nstay after I got there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Altruria. You must let Altruria come to _you_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n returned Homos, with that confounded smile of his that always won my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Reuben Camp, whose thin face was red with excitement,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the word. Have Altruria right here, and right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old farmer, who had several times spoken, cackled out: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\none while, when you was talk\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 about not havin\xe2\x80\x99 no money, but what some\r\non us had had Altrury here for quite a spell, already. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pass more\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nfifty dolla\xe2\x80\x99s through my hands most years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA laugh went up, and then, at sight of Mrs. Makely heading our little\r\nparty, the people round Homos civilly made way for us. She rushed upon\r\nhim, and seized his hand in both of hers; she dropped her fan, parasol,\r\ngloves, handkerchief, and vinaigrette in the grass to do so. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr.\r\nHomos,\xe2\x80\x9d she fluted, and the tears came into her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cit was beautiful,\r\n_beautiful_, every word of it! I sat in a perfect trance from beginning to\r\nend, and I felt that it was all as true as it was beautiful. People all\r\naround me were breathless with interest, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can ever\r\nthank you enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor hastened to say, before the Altrurian could\r\nanswer, and he beamed malignantly upon him through his spectacles while he\r\nspoke, \xe2\x80\x9cit was like some strange romance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I should go so far as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, in his\r\nturn, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it certainly seemed too good to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Altrurian responded, simply, but a little sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cnow that I am\r\naway from it all, and in conditions so different, I sometimes had to ask\r\nmyself, as I went on, if my whole life had not hitherto been a dream, and\r\nAltruria were not some blessed vision of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know how to account for a feeling which I must acknowledge,\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer asked, courteously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was most interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kingdom of God upon earth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minister--\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought not to be\r\nincredible; but that, more than anything else you told us of, gave me\r\npause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou of all men?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Altrurian, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minister, with a certain dejection, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I remember what\r\nI have seen of men, when I reflect what human nature is, how can I believe\r\nthat the kingdom of God will ever come upon the earth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in heaven, where He reigns, who is it does His will? The spirits of\r\nmen?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Altrurian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but conditioned as men are here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they were conditioned as men are there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you two good people get into a theological dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Makely pushed in. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mr. Twelvemough dying to shake hands with\r\nMr. Homos and compliment his distinguished guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr. Homos knows what I must have thought of his talk without my\r\ntelling him,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, skilfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am sorry that I am to lose my\r\ndistinguished guest so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReuben Camp broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my blunder, Mr. Twelvemough. Mr. Homos\r\nand I had talked it over conditionally, and I was not to speak of it till\r\nhe had told you; but it slipped out in the excitement of the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and I shook hands cordially with both of\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the greatest possible advantage for Mr. Homos to see\r\ncertain phases of American life at close range, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly\r\nsee them under better auspices than yours, Camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to drive him through the hill country after haying, and\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take him down and show him one of our big factory\r\ntowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe this was done, but finally the Altrurian went on to New York,\r\nwhere he was to pass the winter. We parted friends; I even offered him\r\nsome introductions; but his acquaintance had become more and more\r\ndifficult, and I was not sorry to part with him. That taste of his for low\r\ncompany was incurable, and I was glad that I was not to be responsible any\r\nlonger for whatever strange thing he might do next. I think he remained\r\nvery popular with the classes he most affected; a throng of natives,\r\nconstruction hands, and table-girls saw him off on his train; and he left\r\nlarge numbers of such admirers in our house and neighborhood, devout in\r\nthe faith that there was such a commonwealth as Altruria, and that he was\r\nreally an Altrurian. As for the more cultivated people who had met him,\r\nthey continued of two minds upon both points.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Traveler from Altruria: Romance, by\r\nWilliam Dean Howells\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A TRAVELER FROM ALTRURIA: ROMANCE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 8449-0.txt or 8449-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/4/4/8449/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Charles Bidwell and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.

We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
