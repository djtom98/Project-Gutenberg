Under the black beaver hat, surmounted by its\r\ntuft of black feathers, the long locks, braided and twisted and coiled\r\nlike the rushes of a basket, composed a rare, if somewhat barbaric,\r\nexample of ingenious art. One could understand such weavings and\r\ncoilings being wrought to last intact for a year, or even a calendar\r\nmonth; but that they should be all demolished regularly at bedtime,\r\nafter a single day of permanence, seemed a reckless waste of successful\r\nfabrication.\r\n\r\nAnd she had done it all herself, poor thing. She had no maid, and it\r\nwas almost the only accomplishment she could boast of. Hence the\r\nunstinted pains.\r\n\r\nShe was a young invalid lady\xe2\x80\x94not so very much of an invalid\xe2\x80\x94sitting in\r\na wheeled chair, which had been pulled up in the front part of a green\r\nenclosure, close to a bandstand, where a concert was going on, during a\r\nwarm June afternoon. It had place in one of the minor parks or private\r\ngardens that are to be found in the suburbs of London, and was the\r\neffort of a local association to raise money for some charity. There\r\nare worlds within worlds in the great city, and though nobody outside\r\nthe immediate district had ever heard of the charity, or the band, or\r\nthe garden, the enclosure was filled with an interested audience\r\nsufficiently informed on all these.\r\n\r\nAs the strains proceeded many of the listeners observed the chaired\r\nlady, whose back hair, by reason of her prominent position, so\r\nchallenged inspection. Her face was not easily discernible, but the\r\naforesaid cunning tress-weavings, the white ear and poll, and the curve\r\nof a cheek which was neither flaccid nor sallow, were signals that led\r\nto the expectation of good beauty in front. Such expectations are not\r\ninfrequently disappointed as soon as the disclosure comes; and in the\r\npresent case, when the lady, by a turn of the head, at length revealed\r\nherself, she was not so handsome as the people behind her had supposed,\r\nand even hoped\xe2\x80\x94they did not know why.\r\n\r\nFor one thing (alas! the commonness of this complaint), she was less\r\nyoung than they had fancied her to be. Yet attractive her face\r\nunquestionably was, and not at all sickly. The revelation of its\r\ndetails came each time she turned to talk to a boy of twelve or\r\nthirteen who stood beside her, and the shape of whose hat and jacket\r\nimplied that he belonged to a well-known public school. The immediate\r\nbystanders could hear that he called her \xe2\x80\x98Mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the end of the recital was reached, and the audience withdrew,\r\nmany chose to find their way out by passing at her elbow. Almost all\r\nturned their heads to take a full and near look at the interesting\r\nwoman, who remained stationary in the chair till the way should be\r\nclear enough for her to be wheeled out without obstruction. As if she\r\nexpected their glances, and did not mind gratifying their curiosity,\r\nshe met the eyes of several of her observers by lifting her own,\r\nshowing these to be soft, brown, and affectionate orbs, a little\r\nplaintive in their regard.\r\n\r\nShe was conducted out of the gardens, and passed along the pavement\r\ntill she disappeared from view, the schoolboy walking beside her. To\r\ninquiries made by some persons who watched her away, the answer came\r\nthat she was the second wife of the incumbent of a neighbouring parish,\r\nand that she was lame. She was generally believed to be a woman with a\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94an innocent one, but a story of some sort or other.\r\n\r\nIn conversing with her on their way home the boy who walked at her\r\nelbow said that he hoped his father had not missed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He have been so comfortable these last few hours that I am sure he\r\ncannot have missed us,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Has_, dear mother\xe2\x80\x94not _have_!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the public-school boy, with\r\nan impatient fastidiousness that was almost harsh. \xe2\x80\x98Surely you know\r\nthat by this time!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis mother hastily adopted the correction, and did not resent his\r\nmaking it, or retaliate, as she might well have done, by bidding him to\r\nwipe that crumby mouth of his, whose condition had been caused by\r\nsurreptitious attempts to eat a piece of cake without taking it out of\r\nthe pocket wherein it lay concealed. After this the pretty woman and\r\nthe boy went onward in silence.\r\n\r\nThat question of grammar bore upon her history, and she fell into\r\nreverie, of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance. It might have been\r\nassumed that she was wondering if she had done wisely in shaping her\r\nlife as she had shaped it, to bring out such a result as this.\r\n\r\nIn a remote nook in North Wessex, forty miles from London, near the\r\nthriving county-town of Aldbrickham, there stood a pretty village with\r\nits church and parsonage, which she knew well enough, but her son had\r\nnever seen. It was her native village, Gaymead, and the first event\r\nbearing upon her present situation had occurred at that place when she\r\nwas only a girl of nineteen.\r\n\r\nHow well she remembered it, that first act in her little tragi-comedy,\r\nthe death of her reverend husband\xe2\x80\x99s first wife. It happened on a spring\r\nevening, and she who now and for many years had filled that first\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s place was then parlour-maid in the parson\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nWhen everything had been done that could be done, and the death was\r\nannounced, she had gone out in the dusk to visit her parents, who were\r\nliving in the same village, to tell them the sad news. As she opened\r\nthe white swing-gate and looked towards the trees which rose westward,\r\nshutting out the pale light of the evening sky, she discerned, without\r\nmuch surprise, the figure of a man standing in the hedge, though she\r\nroguishly exclaimed as a matter of form, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Sam, how you frightened\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was a young gardener of her acquaintance. She told him the\r\nparticulars of the late event, and they stood silent, these two young\r\npeople, in that elevated, calmly philosophic mind which is engendered\r\nwhen a tragedy has happened close at hand, and has not happened to the\r\nphilosophers themselves. But it had its bearing upon their relations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And will you stay on now at the Vicarage, just the same?\xe2\x80\x99 asked he.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly thought of that. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94I suppose!\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything will be just as usual, I imagine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe walked beside her towards her mother\xe2\x80\x99s. Presently his arm stole\r\nround her waist. She gently removed it; but he placed it there again,\r\nand she yielded the point. \xe2\x80\x98You see, dear Sophy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay on; you may want a home; and I shall be ready to offer one\r\nsome day, though I may not be ready just yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Sam, how can you be so fast! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never even said I liked \xe2\x80\x99ee;\r\nand it is all your own doing, coming after me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still, it is nonsense to say I am not to have a try at you like the\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x99 He stooped to kiss her a farewell, for they had reached her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sam; you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, putting her hand over his mouth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be more serious on such a night as this.\xe2\x80\x99 And she bade\r\nhim adieu without allowing him to kiss her or to come indoors.\r\n\r\nThe vicar just left a widower was at this time a man about forty years\r\nof age, of good family, and childless. He had led a secluded existence\r\nin this college living, partly because there were no resident\r\nlandowners; and his loss now intensified his habit of withdrawal from\r\noutward observation. He was still less seen than heretofore, kept\r\nhimself still less in time with the rhythm and racket of the movements\r\ncalled progress in the world without. For many months after his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecease the economy of his household remained as before; the cook, the\r\nhousemaid, the parlour-maid, and the man out-of-doors performed their\r\nduties or left them undone, just as Nature prompted them\xe2\x80\x94the vicar knew\r\nnot which. It was then represented to him that his servants seemed to\r\nhave nothing to do in his small family of one. He was struck with the\r\ntruth of this representation, and decided to cut down his\r\nestablishment. But he was forestalled by Sophy, the parlour-maid, who\r\nsaid one evening that she wished to leave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why?\xe2\x80\x99 said the parson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam Hobson has asked me to marry him, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well\xe2\x80\x94do you want to marry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much. But it would be a home for me. And we have heard that one of\r\nus will have to leave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA day or two after she said: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave just yet, sir, if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it. Sam and I have quarrelled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her. He had hardly ever observed her before, though he\r\nhad been frequently conscious of her soft presence in the room. What a\r\nkitten-like, flexuous, tender creature she was! She was the only one of\r\nthe servants with whom he came into immediate and continuous relation.\r\nWhat should he do if Sophy were gone?\r\n\r\nSophy did not go, but one of the others did, and things went on quietly\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Twycott, the vicar, was ill, Sophy brought up his meals to\r\nhim, and she had no sooner left the room one day than he heard a noise\r\non the stairs. She had slipped down with the tray, and so twisted her\r\nfoot that she could not stand. The village surgeon was called in; the\r\nvicar got better, but Sophy was incapacitated for a long time; and she\r\nwas informed that she must never again walk much or engage in any\r\noccupation which required her to stand long on her feet. As soon as she\r\nwas comparatively well she spoke to him alone. Since she was forbidden\r\nto walk and bustle about, and, indeed, could not do so, it became her\r\nduty to leave. She could very well work at something sitting down, and\r\nshe had an aunt a seamstress.\r\n\r\nThe parson had been very greatly moved by what she had suffered on his\r\naccount, and he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98No, Sophy; lame or not lame, I cannot let\r\nyou go. You must never leave me again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came close to her, and, though she could never exactly tell how it\r\nhappened, she became conscious of his lips upon her cheek. He then\r\nasked her to marry him. Sophy did not exactly love him, but she had a\r\nrespect for him which almost amounted to veneration. Even if she had\r\nwished to get away from him she hardly dared refuse a personage so\r\nreverend and august in her eyes, and she assented forthwith to be his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that one fine morning, when the doors of the church\r\nwere naturally open for ventilation, and the singing birds fluttered in\r\nand alighted on the tie-beams of the roof, there was a marriage-service\r\nat the communion-rails, which hardly a soul knew of. The parson and a\r\nneighbouring curate had entered at one door, and Sophy at another,\r\nfollowed by two necessary persons, whereupon in a short time there\r\nemerged a newly-made husband and wife.\r\n\r\nMr. Twycott knew perfectly well that he had committed social suicide by\r\nthis step, despite Sophy\xe2\x80\x99s spotless character, and he had taken his\r\nmeasures accordingly. An exchange of livings had been arranged with an\r\nacquaintance who was incumbent of a church in the south of London, and\r\nas soon as possible the couple removed thither, abandoning their pretty\r\ncountry home, with trees and shrubs and glebe, for a narrow, dusty\r\nhouse in a long, straight street, and their fine peal of bells for the\r\nwretchedest one-tongued clangour that ever tortured mortal ears. It was\r\nall on her account. They were, however, away from every one who had\r\nknown her former position; and also under less observation from without\r\nthan they would have had to put up with in any country parish.\r\n\r\nSophy the woman was as charming a partner as a man could possess,\r\nthough Sophy the lady had her deficiencies. She showed a natural\r\naptitude for little domestic refinements, so far as related to things\r\nand manners; but in what is called culture she was less intuitive. She\r\nhad now been married more than fourteen years, and her husband had\r\ntaken much trouble with her education; but she still held confused\r\nideas on the use of \xe2\x80\x98was\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98were,\xe2\x80\x99 which did not beget a respect for\r\nher among the few acquaintances she made. Her great grief in this\r\nrelation was that her only child, on whose education no expense had\r\nbeen and would be spared, was now old enough to perceive these\r\ndeficiencies in his mother, and not only to see them but to feel\r\nirritated at their existence.\r\n\r\nThus she lived on in the city, and wasted hours in braiding her\r\nbeautiful hair, till her once apple cheeks waned to pink of the very\r\nfaintest. Her foot had never regained its natural strength after the\r\naccident, and she was mostly obliged to avoid walking altogether. Her\r\nhusband had grown to like London for its freedom and its domestic\r\nprivacy; but he was twenty years his Sophy\xe2\x80\x99s senior, and had latterly\r\nbeen seized with a serious illness. On this day, however, he had seemed\r\nto be well enough to justify her accompanying her son Randolph to the\r\nconcert.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe next time we get a glimpse of her is when she appears in the\r\nmournful attire of a widow.\r\n\r\nMr. Twycott had never rallied, and now lay in a well-packed cemetery to\r\nthe south of the great city, where, if all the dead it contained had\r\nstood erect and alive, not one would have known him or recognized his\r\nname. The boy had dutifully followed him to the grave, and was now\r\nagain at school.\r\n\r\nThroughout these changes Sophy had been treated like the child she was\r\nin nature though not in years. She was left with no control over\r\nanything that had been her husband\xe2\x80\x99s beyond her modest personal income.\r\nIn his anxiety lest her inexperience should be overreached he had\r\nsafeguarded with trustees all he possibly could. The completion of the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s course at the public school, to be followed in due time by Oxford\r\nand ordination, had been all previsioned and arranged, and she really\r\nhad nothing to occupy her in the world but to eat and drink, and make a\r\nbusiness of indolence, and go on weaving and coiling the nut-brown\r\nhair, merely keeping a home open for the son whenever he came to her\r\nduring vacations.\r\n\r\nForeseeing his probable decease long years before her, her husband in\r\nhis lifetime had purchased for her use a semi-detached villa in the\r\nsame long, straight road whereon the church and parsonage faced, which\r\nwas to be hers as long as she chose to live in it. Here she now\r\nresided, looking out upon the fragment of lawn in front, and through\r\nthe railings at the ever-flowing traffic; or, bending forward over the\r\nwindow-sill on the first floor, stretching her eyes far up and down the\r\nvista of sooty trees, hazy air, and drab house-fa\xc3\xa7ades, along which\r\nechoed the noises common to a suburban main thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nSomehow, her boy, with his aristocratic school-knowledge, his grammars,\r\nand his aversions, was losing those wide infantine sympathies,\r\nextending as far as to the sun and moon themselves, with which he, like\r\nother children, had been born, and which his mother, a child of nature\r\nherself, had loved in him; he was reducing their compass to a\r\npopulation of a few thousand wealthy and titled people, the mere veneer\r\nof a thousand million or so of others who did not interest him at all.\r\nHe drifted further and further away from her. Sophy\xe2\x80\x99s _milieu_ being a\r\nsuburb of minor tradesmen and under-clerks, and her almost only\r\ncompanions the two servants of her own house, it was not surprising\r\nthat after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death she soon lost the little artificial\r\ntastes she had acquired from him, and became\xe2\x80\x94in her son\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94a mother\r\nwhose mistakes and origin it was his painful lot as a gentleman to\r\nblush for. As yet he was far from being man enough\xe2\x80\x94if he ever would\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94to rate these sins of hers at their true infinitesimal value beside\r\nthe yearning fondness that welled up and remained penned in her heart\r\ntill it should be more fully accepted by him, or by some other person\r\nor thing. If he had lived at home with her he would have had all of it;\r\nbut he seemed to require so very little in present circumstances, and\r\nit remained stored.\r\n\r\nHer life became insupportably dreary; she could not take walks, and had\r\nno interest in going for drives, or, indeed, in travelling anywhere.\r\nNearly two years passed without an event, and still she looked on that\r\nsuburban road, thinking of the village in which she had been born, and\r\nwhither she would have gone back\xe2\x80\x94O how gladly!\xe2\x80\x94even to work in the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nTaking no exercise, she often could not sleep, and would rise in the\r\nnight or early morning and look out upon the then vacant thoroughfare,\r\nwhere the lamps stood like sentinels waiting for some procession to go\r\nby. An approximation to such a procession was indeed made early every\r\nmorning about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the country vehicles passed up with\r\nloads of vegetables for Covent Garden market. She often saw them\r\ncreeping along at this silent and dusky hour\xe2\x80\x94waggon after waggon,\r\nbearing green bastions of cabbages nodding to their fall, yet never\r\nfalling, walls of baskets enclosing masses of beans and peas, pyramids\r\nof snow-white turnips, swaying howdahs of mixed produce\xe2\x80\x94creeping along\r\nbehind aged night-horses, who seemed ever patiently wondering between\r\ntheir hollow coughs why they had always to work at that still hour when\r\nall other sentient creatures were privileged to rest. Wrapped in a\r\ncloak, it was soothing to watch and sympathize with them when\r\ndepression and nervousness hindered sleep, and to see how the fresh\r\ngreen-stuff brightened to life as it came opposite the lamp, and how\r\nthe sweating animals steamed and shone with their miles of travel.\r\n\r\nThey had an interest, almost a charm, for Sophy, these semirural people\r\nand vehicles moving in an urban atmosphere, leading a life quite\r\ndistinct from that of the daytime toilers on the same road. One morning\r\na man who accompanied a waggon-load of potatoes gazed rather hard at\r\nthe house-fronts as he passed, and with a curious emotion she thought\r\nhis form was familiar to her. She looked out for him again. His being\r\nan old-fashioned conveyance, with a yellow front, it was easily\r\nrecognizable, and on the third night after she saw it a second time.\r\nThe man alongside was, as she had fancied, Sam Hobson, formerly\r\ngardener at Gaymead, who would at one time have married her.\r\n\r\nShe had occasionally thought of him, and wondered if life in a cottage\r\nwith him would not have been a happier lot than the life she had\r\naccepted. She had not thought of him passionately, but her now dismal\r\nsituation lent an interest to his resurrection\xe2\x80\x94a tender interest which\r\nit is impossible to exaggerate. She went back to bed, and began\r\nthinking. When did these market-gardeners, who travelled up to town so\r\nregularly at one or two in the morning, come back? She dimly\r\nrecollected seeing their empty waggons, hardly noticeable amid the\r\nordinary day-traffic, passing down at some hour before noon.\r\n\r\nIt was only April, but that morning, after breakfast, she had the\r\nwindow opened, and sat looking out, the feeble sun shining full upon\r\nher. She affected to sew, but her eyes never left the street. Between\r\nten and eleven the desired waggon, now unladen, reappeared on its\r\nreturn journey. But Sam was not looking round him then, and drove on in\r\na reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 cried she.\r\n\r\nTurning with a start, his face lighted up. He called to him a little\r\nboy to hold the horse, alighted, and came and stood under her window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t come down easily, Sam, or I would!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Did you know I\r\nlived here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mrs. Twycott, I knew you lived along here somewhere. I have\r\noften looked out for \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe briefly explained his own presence on the scene. He had long since\r\ngiven up his gardening in the village near Aldbrickham, and was now\r\nmanager at a market-gardener\xe2\x80\x99s on the south side of London, it being\r\npart of his duty to go up to Covent Garden with waggon-loads of produce\r\ntwo or three times a week. In answer to her curious inquiry, he\r\nadmitted that he had come to this particular district because he had\r\nseen in the Aldbrickham paper, a year or two before, the announcement\r\nof the death in South London of the aforetime vicar of Gaymead, which\r\nhad revived an interest in her dwelling-place that he could not\r\nextinguish, leading him to hover about the locality till his present\r\npost had been secured.\r\n\r\nThey spoke of their native village in dear old North Wessex, the spots\r\nin which they had played together as children. She tried to feel that\r\nshe was a dignified personage now, that she must not be too\r\nconfidential with Sam. But she could not keep it up, and the tears\r\nhanging in her eyes were indicated in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not happy, Mrs. Twycott, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, of course not! I lost my husband only the year before last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I meant in another way. You\xe2\x80\x99d like to be home again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is my home\xe2\x80\x94for life. The house belongs to me. But I\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94She let it out then. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sam. I long for home\xe2\x80\x94_our_ home!\r\nI _should_ like to be there, and never leave it, and die there.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nshe remembered herself. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s only a momentary feeling. I have a son,\r\nyou know, a dear boy. He\xe2\x80\x99s at school now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somewhere handy, I suppose? I see there\xe2\x80\x99s lots on \xe2\x80\x99em along this\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no! Not in one of these wretched holes! At a public school\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthe most distinguished in England.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chok\xe2\x80\x99 it all! of course! I forget, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a lady for\r\nso many years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am not a lady,\xe2\x80\x99 she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x98I never shall be. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman, and that\xe2\x80\x94makes it\xe2\x80\x94O how difficult for me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance thus oddly reopened proceeded apace. She often looked\r\nout to get a few words with him, by night or by day. Her sorrow was\r\nthat she could not accompany her one old friend on foot a little way,\r\nand talk more freely than she could do while he paused before the\r\nhouse. One night, at the beginning of June, when she was again on the\r\nwatch after an absence of some days from the window, he entered the\r\ngate and said softly, \xe2\x80\x98Now, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t some air do you good? I\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\nhalf a load this morning. Why not ride up to Covent Garden with me?\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a nice seat on the cabbages, where I\xe2\x80\x99ve spread a sack. You can\r\nbe home again in a cab before anybody is up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe refused at first, and then, trembling with excitement, hastily\r\nfinished her dressing, and wrapped herself up in cloak and veil,\r\nafterwards sidling downstairs by the aid of the handrail, in a way she\r\ncould adopt on an emergency. When she had opened the door she found Sam\r\non the step, and he lifted her bodily on his strong arm across the\r\nlittle forecourt into his vehicle. Not a soul was visible or audible in\r\nthe infinite length of the straight, flat highway, with its\r\never-waiting lamps converging to points in each direction. The air was\r\nfresh as country air at this hour, and the stars shone, except to the\r\nnorth-eastward, where there was a whitish light\xe2\x80\x94the dawn. Sam carefully\r\nplaced her in the seat, and drove on.\r\n\r\nThey talked as they had talked in old days, Sam pulling himself up now\r\nand then, when he thought himself too familiar. More than once she said\r\nwith misgiving that she wondered if she ought to have indulged in the\r\nfreak. \xe2\x80\x98But I am so lonely in my house,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, \xe2\x80\x98and this makes me\r\nso happy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must come again, dear Mrs. Twycott. There is no time o\xe2\x80\x99 day for\r\ntaking the air like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt grew lighter and lighter. The sparrows became busy in the streets,\r\nand the city waxed denser around them. When they approached the river\r\nit was day, and on the bridge they beheld the full blaze of morning\r\nsunlight in the direction of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, the river glistening towards\r\nit, and not a craft stirring.\r\n\r\nNear Covent Garden he put her into a cab, and they parted, looking into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s faces like the very old friends they were. She reached\r\nhome without adventure, limped to the door, and let herself in with her\r\nlatch-key unseen.\r\n\r\nThe air and Sam\xe2\x80\x99s presence had revived her: her cheeks were quite\r\npink\xe2\x80\x94almost beautiful. She had something to live for in addition to her\r\nson. A woman of pure instincts, she knew there had been nothing really\r\nwrong in the journey, but supposed it conventionally to be very wrong\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, she gave way to the temptation of going with him again,\r\nand on this occasion their conversation was distinctly tender, and Sam\r\nsaid he never should forget her, notwithstanding that she had served\r\nhim rather badly at one time. After much hesitation he told her of a\r\nplan it was in his power to carry out, and one he should like to take\r\nin hand, since he did not care for London work: it was to set up as a\r\nmaster greengrocer down at Aldbrickham, the county-town of their native\r\nplace. He knew of an opening\xe2\x80\x94a shop kept by aged people who wished to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do it, then, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked with a slight\r\nheartsinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d join me. I know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\nSuch a lady as ye\xe2\x80\x99ve been so long, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a wife to a man like\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hardly suppose I could!\xe2\x80\x99 she assented, also frightened at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you could,\xe2\x80\x99 he said eagerly, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99d on\xe2\x80\x99y have to sit in the back\r\nparlour and look through the glass partition when I was away\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94just to keep an eye on things. The lameness wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder\r\nthat . . . I\xe2\x80\x99d keep you as genteel as ever I could, dear Sophy\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\nmight think of it!\xe2\x80\x99 he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be frank,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, putting her hand on his. \xe2\x80\x98If it were\r\nonly myself I would do it, and gladly, though everything I possess\r\nwould be lost to me by marrying again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that! It\xe2\x80\x99s more independent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s good of you, dear, dear Sam. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something else. I have\r\na son . . . I almost fancy when I am miserable sometimes that he is not\r\nreally mine, but one I hold in trust for my late husband. He seems to\r\nbelong so little to me personally, so entirely to his dead father. He\r\nis so much educated and I so little that I do not feel dignified enough\r\nto be his mother . . . Well, he would have to be told.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Unquestionably.\xe2\x80\x99 Sam saw her thought and her fear. \xe2\x80\x98Still, you\r\ncan do as you like, Sophy\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Twycott,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98It is not you who\r\nare the child, but he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know! Sam, if I could, I would marry you, some day. But\r\nyou must wait a while, and let me think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was enough for him, and he was blithe at their parting. Not so she.\r\nTo tell Randolph seemed impossible. She could wait till he had gone up\r\nto Oxford, when what she did would affect his life but little. But\r\nwould he ever tolerate the idea? And if not, could she defy him?\r\n\r\nShe had not told him a word when the yearly cricket-match came on at\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s between the public schools, though Sam had already gone back to\r\nAldbrickham. Mrs. Twycott felt stronger than usual: she went to the\r\nmatch with Randolph, and was able to leave her chair and walk about\r\noccasionally. The bright idea occurred to her that she could casually\r\nbroach the subject while moving round among the spectators, when the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were high with interest in the game, and he would weigh\r\ndomestic matters as feathers in the scale beside the day\xe2\x80\x99s victory.\r\nThey promenaded under the lurid July sun, this pair, so wide apart, yet\r\nso near, and Sophy saw the large proportion of boys like her own, in\r\ntheir broad white collars and dwarf hats, and all around the rows of\r\ngreat coaches under which was jumbled the _d\xc3\xa9bris_ of luxurious\r\nluncheons; bones, pie-crusts, champagne-bottles, glasses, plates,\r\nnapkins, and the family silver; while on the coaches sat the proud\r\nfathers and mothers; but never a poor mother like her. If Randolph had\r\nnot appertained to these, had not centred all his interests in them,\r\nhad not cared exclusively for the class they belonged to, how happy\r\nwould things have been! A great huzza at some small performance with\r\nthe bat burst from the multitude of relatives, and Randolph jumped\r\nwildly into the air to see what had happened. Sophy fetched up the\r\nsentence that had been already shaped; but she could not get it out.\r\nThe occasion was, perhaps, an inopportune one. The contrast between her\r\nstory and the display of fashion to which Randolph had grown to regard\r\nhimself as akin would be fatal. She awaited a better time.\r\n\r\nIt was on an evening when they were alone in their plain suburban\r\nresidence, where life was not blue but brown, that she ultimately broke\r\nsilence, qualifying her announcement of a probable second marriage by\r\nassuring him that it would not take place for a long time to come, when\r\nhe would be living quite independently of her.\r\n\r\nThe boy thought the idea a very reasonable one, and asked if she had\r\nchosen anybody? She hesitated; and he seemed to have a misgiving. He\r\nhoped his stepfather would be a gentleman? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not what you call a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered timidly. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll be much\r\nas I was before I knew your father;\xe2\x80\x99 and by degrees she acquainted him\r\nwith the whole. The youth\xe2\x80\x99s face remained fixed for a moment; then he\r\nflushed, leant on the table, and burst into passionate tears.\r\n\r\nHis mother went up to him, kissed all of his face that she could get\r\nat, and patted his back as if he were still the baby he once had been,\r\ncrying herself the while. When he had somewhat recovered from his\r\nparoxysm he went hastily to his own room and fastened the door.\r\n\r\nParleyings were attempted through the keyhole, outside which she waited\r\nand listened. It was long before he would reply, and when he did it was\r\nto say sternly at her from within: \xe2\x80\x98I am ashamed of you! It will ruin\r\nme! A miserable boor! a churl! a clown! It will degrade me in the eyes\r\nof all the gentlemen of England!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I am wrong! I will struggle against it!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\nBefore Randolph left her that summer a letter arrived from Sam to\r\ninform her that he had been unexpectedly fortunate in obtaining the\r\nshop. He was in possession; it was the largest in the town, combining\r\nfruit with vegetables, and he thought it would form a home worthy even\r\nof her some day. Might he not run up to town to see her?\r\n\r\nShe met him by stealth, and said he must still wait for her final\r\nanswer. The autumn dragged on, and when Randolph was home at Christmas\r\nfor the holidays she broached the matter again. But the young gentleman\r\nwas inexorable.\r\n\r\nIt was dropped for months; renewed again; abandoned under his\r\nrepugnance; again attempted; and thus the gentle creature reasoned and\r\npleaded till four or five long years had passed. Then the faithful Sam\r\nrevived his suit with some peremptoriness. Sophy\xe2\x80\x99s son, now an\r\nundergraduate, was down from Oxford one Easter, when she again opened\r\nthe subject. As soon as he was ordained, she argued, he would have a\r\nhome of his own, wherein she, with her bad grammar and her ignorance,\r\nwould be an encumbrance to him. Better obliterate her as much as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nHe showed a more manly anger now, but would not agree. She on her side\r\nwas more persistent, and he had doubts whether she could be trusted in\r\nhis absence. But by indignation and contempt for her taste he\r\ncompletely maintained his ascendency; and finally taking her before a\r\nlittle cross and altar that he had erected in his bedroom for his\r\nprivate devotions, there bade her kneel, and swear that she would not\r\nwed Samuel Hobson without his consent. \xe2\x80\x98I owe this to my father!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman swore, thinking he would soften as soon as he was\r\nordained and in full swing of clerical work. But he did not. His\r\neducation had by this time sufficiently ousted his humanity to keep him\r\nquite firm; though his mother might have led an idyllic life with her\r\nfaithful fruiterer and greengrocer, and nobody have been anything the\r\nworse in the world.\r\n\r\nHer lameness became more confirmed as time went on, and she seldom or\r\nnever left the house in the long southern thoroughfare, where she\r\nseemed to be pining her heart away. \xe2\x80\x98Why mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I say to Sam that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmarry him? Why mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99 she would murmur plaintively to herself when\r\nnobody was near.\r\n\r\nSome four years after this date a middle-aged man was standing at the\r\ndoor of the largest fruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s shop in Aldbrickham. He was the\r\nproprietor, but to-day, instead of his usual business attire, he wore a\r\nneat suit of black; and his window was partly shuttered. From the\r\nrailway-station a funeral procession was seen approaching: it passed\r\nhis door and went out of the town towards the village of Gaymead. The\r\nman, whose eyes were wet, held his hat in his hand as the vehicles\r\nmoved by; while from the mourning coach a young smooth-shaven priest in\r\na high waistcoat looked black as a cloud at the shop keeper standing\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_December_ 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR CONSCIENCE\xe2\x80\x99 SAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWhether the utilitarian or the intuitive theory of the moral sense be\r\nupheld, it is beyond question that there are a few subtle-souled\r\npersons with whom the absolute gratuitousness of an act of reparation\r\nis an inducement to perform it; while exhortation as to its necessity\r\nwould breed excuses for leaving it undone. The case of Mr. Millborne\r\nand Mrs. Frankland particularly illustrated this, and perhaps something\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThere were few figures better known to the local crossing-sweeper than\r\nMr. Millborne\xe2\x80\x99s, in his daily comings and goings along a familiar and\r\nquiet London street, where he lived inside the door marked eleven,\r\nthough not as householder. In age he was fifty at least, and his habits\r\nwere as regular as those of a person can be who has no occupation but\r\nthe study of how to keep himself employed. He turned almost always to\r\nthe right on getting to the end of his street, then he went onward down\r\nBond Street to his club, whence he returned by precisely the same\r\ncourse about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, on foot; or, if he went to dine, later on in\r\na cab. He was known to be a man of some means, though apparently not\r\nwealthy. Being a bachelor he seemed to prefer his present mode of\r\nliving as a lodger in Mrs. Towney\xe2\x80\x99s best rooms, with the use of\r\nfurniture which he had bought ten times over in rent during his\r\ntenancy, to having a house of his own.\r\n\r\nNone among his acquaintance tried to know him well, for his manner and\r\nmoods did not excite curiosity or deep friendship. He was not a man who\r\nseemed to have anything on his mind, anything to conceal, anything to\r\nimpart. From his casual remarks it was generally understood that he was\r\ncountry-born, a native of some place in Wessex; that he had come to\r\nLondon as a young man in a banking-house, and had risen to a post of\r\nresponsibility; when, by the death of his father, who had been\r\nfortunate in his investments, the son succeeded to an income which led\r\nhim to retire from a business life somewhat early.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when he had been unwell for several days, Doctor Bindon\r\ncame in, after dinner, from the adjoining medical quarter, and smoked\r\nwith him over the fire. The patient\xe2\x80\x99s ailment was not such as to\r\nrequire much thought, and they talked together on indifferent subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a lonely man, Bindon\xe2\x80\x94a lonely man,\xe2\x80\x99 Millborne took occasion to\r\nsay, shaking his head gloomily. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know such loneliness as mine\r\n. . . And the older I get the more I am dissatisfied with myself. And\r\nto-day I have been, through an accident, more than usually haunted by\r\nwhat, above all other events of my life, causes that\r\ndissatisfaction\xe2\x80\x94the recollection of an unfulfilled promise made twenty\r\nyears ago. In ordinary affairs I have always been considered a man of\r\nmy word and perhaps it is on that account that a particular vow I once\r\nmade, and did not keep, comes back to me with a magnitude out of all\r\nproportion (I daresay) to its real gravity, especially at this time of\r\nday. You know the discomfort caused at night by the half-sleeping sense\r\nthat a door or window has been left unfastened, or in the day by the\r\nremembrance of unanswered letters. So does that promise haunt me from\r\ntime to time, and has done to-day particularly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and they smoked on. Millborne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, though fixed\r\non the fire, were really regarding attentively a town in the West of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98I have never quite forgotten it, though during\r\nthe busy years of my life it was shelved and buried under the pressure\r\nof my pursuits. And, as I say, to-day in particular, an incident in the\r\nlaw-report of a somewhat similar kind has brought it back again\r\nvividly. However, what it was I can tell you in a few words, though no\r\ndoubt you, as a man of the world, will smile at the thinness of my skin\r\nwhen you hear it . . . I came up to town at one-and-twenty, from\r\nToneborough, in Outer Wessex, where I was born, and where, before I\r\nleft, I had won the heart of a young woman of my own age. I promised\r\nher marriage, took advantage of my promise, and\xe2\x80\x94am a bachelor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe other nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I left the place, and thought at the time I had done a very clever\r\nthing in getting so easily out of an entanglement. But I have lived\r\nlong enough for that promise to return to bother me\xe2\x80\x94to be honest, not\r\naltogether as a pricking of the conscience, but as a dissatisfaction\r\nwith myself as a specimen of the heap of flesh called humanity. If I\r\nwere to ask you to lend me fifty pounds, which I would repay you next\r\nmidsummer, and I did not repay you, I should consider myself a shabby\r\nsort of fellow, especially if you wanted the money badly. Yet I\r\npromised that girl just as distinctly; and then coolly broke my word,\r\nas if doing so were rather smart conduct than a mean action, for which\r\nthe poor victim herself, encumbered with a child, and not I, had really\r\nto pay the penalty, in spite of certain pecuniary aid that was given.\r\nThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s the retrospective trouble that I am always unearthing;\r\nand you may hardly believe that though so many years have elapsed, and\r\nit is all gone by and done with, and she must be getting on for an old\r\nwoman now, as I am for an old man, it really often destroys my sense of\r\nself-respect still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I can understand it. All depends upon the temperament. Thousands of\r\nmen would have forgotten all about it; so would you, perhaps, if you\r\nhad married and had a family. Did she ever marry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. O no\xe2\x80\x94she never did. She left Toneborough, and later\r\non appeared under another name at Exonbury, in the next county, where\r\nshe was not known. It is very seldom that I go down into that part of\r\nthe country, but in passing through Exonbury, on one occasion, I learnt\r\nthat she was quite a settled resident there, as a teacher of music, or\r\nsomething of the kind. That much I casually heard when I was there two\r\nor three years ago. But I have never set eyes on her since our original\r\nacquaintance, and should not know her if I met her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did the child live?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For several years, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his friend. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot say if\r\nshe is living now. It was a little girl. She might be married by this\r\ntime as far as years go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the mother\xe2\x80\x94was she a decent, worthy young woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; a sensible, quiet girl, neither attractive nor unattractive to\r\nthe ordinary observer; simply commonplace. Her position at the time of\r\nour acquaintance was not so good as mine. My father was a solicitor, as\r\nI think I have told you. She was a young girl in a music-shop; and it\r\nwas represented to me that it would be beneath my position to marry\r\nher. Hence the result.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, all I can say is that after twenty years it is probably too late\r\nto think of mending such a matter. It has doubtless by this time mended\r\nitself. You had better dismiss it from your mind as an evil past your\r\ncontrol. Of course, if mother and daughter are alive, or either, you\r\nmight settle something upon them, if you were inclined, and had it to\r\nspare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t much to spare; and I have relations in narrow\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x94perhaps narrower than theirs. But that is not the point.\r\nWere I ever so rich I feel I could not rectify the past by money. I did\r\nnot promise to enrich her. On the contrary, I told her it would\r\nprobably be dire poverty for both of us. But I did promise to make her\r\nmy wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then find her and do it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor jocularly as he rose to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Bindon. That, of course, is the obvious jest. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nslightest desire for marriage; I am quite content to live as I have\r\nlived. I am a bachelor by nature, and instinct, and habit, and\r\neverything. Besides, though I respect her still (for she was not an\r\natom to blame), I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any shadow of love for her. In my mind she\r\nexists as one of those women you think well of, but find uninteresting.\r\nIt would be purely with the idea of putting wrong right that I should\r\nhunt her up, and propose to do it off-hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it seriously?\xe2\x80\x99 said his surprised friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sometimes think that I would, if it were practicable; simply, as I\r\nsay, to recover my sense of being a man of honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you luck in the enterprise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Doctor Bindon. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nbe out of that chair, and then you can put your impulse to the test.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94after twenty years of silence\xe2\x80\x94I should say, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s advice remained counterpoised, in Millborne\xe2\x80\x99s mind, by the\r\naforesaid mood of seriousness and sense of principle, approximating\r\noften to religious sentiment, which had been evolving itself in his\r\nbreast for months, and even years.\r\n\r\nThe feeling, however, had no immediate effect upon Mr. Millborne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nactions. He soon got over his trifling illness, and was vexed with\r\nhimself for having, in a moment of impulse, confided such a case of\r\nconscience to anybody.\r\n\r\nBut the force which had prompted it, though latent, remained with him\r\nand ultimately grew stronger. The upshot was that about four months\r\nafter the date of his illness and disclosure, Millborne found himself\r\non a mild spring morning at Paddington Station, in a train that was\r\nstarting for the west. His many intermittent thoughts on his broken\r\npromise from time to time, in those hours when loneliness brought him\r\nface to face with his own personality, had at last resulted in this\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe decisive stimulus had been given when, a day or two earlier, on\r\nlooking into a Post-Office Directory, he learnt that the woman he had\r\nnot met for twenty years was still living on at Exonbury under the name\r\nshe had assumed when, a year or two after her disappearance from her\r\nnative town and his, she had returned from abroad as a young widow with\r\na child, and taken up her residence at the former city. Her condition\r\nwas apparently but little changed, and her daughter seemed to be with\r\nher, their names standing in the Directory as \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Leonora Frankland\r\nand Miss Frankland, Teachers of Music and Dancing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Millborne reached Exonbury in the afternoon, and his first\r\nbusiness, before even taking his luggage into the town, was to find the\r\nhouse occupied by the teachers. Standing in a central and open place it\r\nwas not difficult to discover, a well-burnished brass doorplate bearing\r\ntheir names prominently. He hesitated to enter without further\r\nknowledge, and ultimately took lodgings over a toyshop opposite,\r\nsecuring a sitting-room which faced a similar drawing or sitting-room\r\nat the Franklands\xe2\x80\x99, where the dancing lessons were given. Installed\r\nhere he was enabled to make indirectly, and without suspicion,\r\ninquiries and observations on the character of the ladies over the way,\r\nwhich he did with much deliberateness.\r\n\r\nHe learnt that the widow, Mrs. Frankland, with her one daughter,\r\nFrances, was of cheerful and excellent repute, energetic and\r\npainstaking with her pupils, of whom she had a good many, and in whose\r\ntuition her daughter assisted her. She was quite a recognized\r\ntownswoman, and though the dancing branch of her profession was perhaps\r\na trifle worldly, she was really a serious-minded lady who, being\r\nobliged to live by what she knew how to teach, balanced matters by\r\nlending a hand at charitable bazaars, assisting at sacred concerts, and\r\ngiving musical recitations in aid of funds for bewildering happy\r\nsavages, and other such enthusiasms of this enlightened country. Her\r\ndaughter was one of the foremost of the bevy of young women who\r\ndecorated the churches at Easter and Christmas, was organist in one of\r\nthose edifices, and had subscribed to the testimonial of a silver\r\nbroth-basin that was presented to the Reverend Mr. Walker as a token of\r\ngratitude for his faithful and arduous intonations of six months as\r\nsub-precentor in the Cathedral. Altogether mother and daughter appeared\r\nto be a typical and innocent pair among the genteel citizens of\r\nExonbury.\r\n\r\nAs a natural and simple way of advertising their profession they\r\nallowed the windows of the music-room to be a little open, so that you\r\nhad the pleasure of hearing all along the street at any hour between\r\nsunrise and sunset fragmentary gems of classical music as interpreted\r\nby the young people of twelve or fourteen who took lessons there. But\r\nit was said that Mrs. Frankland made most of her income by letting out\r\npianos on hire, and by selling them as agent for the makers.\r\n\r\nThe report pleased Millborne; it was highly creditable, and far better\r\nthan he had hoped. He was curious to get a view of the two women who\r\nled such blameless lives.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wait to gain a glimpse of Leonora. It was when she\r\nwas standing on her own doorstep, opening her parasol, on the morning\r\nafter his arrival. She was thin, though not gaunt; and a good,\r\nwell-wearing, thoughtful face had taken the place of the one which had\r\ntemporarily attracted him in the days of his nonage. She wore black,\r\nand it became her in her character of widow. The daughter next\r\nappeared; she was a smoothed and rounded copy of her mother, with the\r\nsame decision in her mien that Leonora had, and a bounding gait in\r\nwhich he traced a faint resemblance to his own at her age.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he absolutely made up his mind to call on them. But\r\nhis antecedent step was to send Leonora a note the next morning,\r\nstating his proposal to visit her, and suggesting the evening as the\r\ntime, because she seemed to be so greatly occupied in her professional\r\ncapacity during the day. He purposely worded his note in such a form as\r\nnot to require an answer from her which would be possibly awkward to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nNo answer came. Naturally he should not have been surprised at this;\r\nand yet he felt a little checked, even though she had only refrained\r\nfrom volunteering a reply that was not demanded.\r\n\r\nAt eight, the hour fixed by himself, he crossed over and was passively\r\nadmitted by the servant. Mrs. Frankland, as she called herself,\r\nreceived him in the large music-and-dancing room on the first-floor\r\nfront, and not in any private little parlour as he had expected. This\r\ncast a distressingly business-like colour over their first meeting\r\nafter so many years of severance. The woman he had wronged stood before\r\nhim, well-dressed, even to his metropolitan eyes, and her manner as she\r\ncame up to him was dignified even to hardness. She certainly was not\r\nglad to see him. But what could he expect after a neglect of twenty\r\nyears!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you do, Mr. Millborne?\xe2\x80\x99 she said cheerfully, as to any chance\r\ncaller. \xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to receive you here because my daughter has a\r\nfriend downstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your daughter\xe2\x80\x94and mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied hastily, as if the addition had escaped her\r\nmemory. \xe2\x80\x98But perhaps the less said about that the better, in fairness\r\nto me. You will consider me a widow, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Leonora . . . \xe2\x80\x99 He could not get on, her manner was so cold\r\nand indifferent. The expected scene of sad reproach, subdued to\r\ndelicacy by the run of years, was absent altogether. He was obliged to\r\ncome to the point without preamble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite free, Leonora\xe2\x80\x94I mean as to marriage? There is nobody who\r\nhas your promise, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; quite free, Mr. Millborne,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, somewhat surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will tell you why I have come. Twenty years ago I promised to\r\nmake you my wife; and I am here to fulfil that promise. Heaven forgive\r\nmy tardiness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer surprise was increased, but she was not agitated. She seemed to\r\nbecome gloomy, disapproving. \xe2\x80\x98I could not entertain such an idea at\r\nthis time of life,\xe2\x80\x99 she said after a moment or two. \xe2\x80\x98It would\r\ncomplicate matters too greatly. I have a very fair income, and require\r\nno help of any sort. I have no wish to marry . . . What could have\r\ninduced you to come on such an errand now? It seems quite\r\nextraordinary, if I may say so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must\xe2\x80\x94I daresay it does,\xe2\x80\x99 Millborne replied vaguely; \xe2\x80\x98and I must\r\ntell you that impulse\xe2\x80\x94I mean in the sense of passion\xe2\x80\x94has little to do\r\nwith it. I wish to marry you, Leonora; I much desire to marry you. But\r\nit is an affair of conscience, a case of fulfilment. I promised you,\r\nand it was dishonourable of me to go away. I want to remove that sense\r\nof dishonour before I die. No doubt we might get to love each other as\r\nwarmly as we did in old times?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe dubiously shook her head. \xe2\x80\x98I appreciate your motives, Mr.\r\nMillborne; but you must consider my position; and you will see that,\r\nshort of the personal wish to marry, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel, there is no\r\nreason why I should change my state, even though by so doing I should\r\nease your conscience. My position in this town is a respected one; I\r\nhave built it up by my own hard labours, and, in short, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\r\nalter it. My daughter, too, is just on the verge of an engagement to be\r\nmarried, to a young man who will make her an excellent husband. It will\r\nbe in every way a desirable match for her. He is downstairs now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she know\xe2\x80\x94anything about me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, no; God forbid! Her father is dead and buried to her. So that,\r\nyou see, things are going on smoothly, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disturb\r\ntheir progress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and rose to go. At the door, however,\r\nhe came back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still, Leonora,\xe2\x80\x99 he urged, \xe2\x80\x98I have come on purpose; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhat disturbance would be caused. You would simply marry an old friend.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you reconsider? It is no more than right that we should be\r\nunited, remembering the girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and patted with her foot nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98I shall not be leaving Exonbury\r\nyet. You will allow me to see you again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x99 she said reluctantly.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles he had encountered, though they did not reanimate his\r\ndead passion for Leonora, did certainly make it appear indispensable to\r\nhis peace of mind to overcome her coldness. He called frequently. The\r\nfirst meeting with the daughter was a trying ordeal, though he did not\r\nfeel drawn towards her as he had expected to be; she did not excite his\r\nsympathies. Her mother confided to Frances the errand of \xe2\x80\x98her old\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x99 which was viewed by the daughter with strong disfavour. His\r\ndesire being thus uncongenial to both, for a long time Millborne made\r\nnot the least impression upon Mrs. Frankland. His attentions pestered\r\nher rather than pleased her. He was surprised at her firmness, and it\r\nwas only when he hinted at moral reasons for their union that she was\r\never shaken. \xe2\x80\x98Strictly speaking,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, \xe2\x80\x98we ought, as honest\r\npersons, to marry; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it, Leonora.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have looked at it in that light,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x98It struck me at\r\nthe very first. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the force of the argument. I totally\r\ndeny that after this interval of time I am bound to marry you for\r\nhonour\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I would have married you, as you know well enough, at\r\nthe proper time. But what is the use of remedies now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were standing at the window. A scantly-whiskered young man, in\r\nclerical attire, called at the door below. Leonora flushed with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Millborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Frances\xe2\x80\x99s lover. I am so sorry\xe2\x80\x94she is not at home! Ah! they have\r\ntold him where she is, and he has gone to find her . . . I hope that\r\nsuit will prosper, at any rate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, he cannot marry yet; and Frances sees but little of him now he\r\nhas left Exonbury. He was formerly doing duty here, but now he is\r\ncurate of St. John\xe2\x80\x99s, Ivell, fifty miles up the line. There is a tacit\r\nagreement between them, but\xe2\x80\x94there have been friends of his who object,\r\nbecause of our vocation. However, he sees the absurdity of such an\r\nobjection as that, and is not influenced by it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your marriage with me would help the match, instead of hindering it,\r\nas you have said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think it would?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It certainly would, by taking you out of this business altogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy chance he had found the way to move her somewhat, and he followed it\r\nup. This view was imparted to Mrs. Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and it led her\r\nto soften her opposition. Millborne, who had given up his lodging in\r\nExonbury, journeyed to and fro regularly, till at last he overcame her\r\nnegations, and she expressed a reluctant assent.\r\n\r\nThey were married at the nearest church; and the goodwill\xe2\x80\x94whatever that\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94of the music-and-dancing connection was sold to a successor only\r\ntoo ready to jump into the place, the Millbornes having decided to live\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMillborne was a householder in his old district, though not in his old\r\nstreet, and Mrs. Millborne and their daughter had turned themselves\r\ninto Londoners. Frances was well reconciled to the removal by her\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction at the change. It suited him better to travel from\r\nIvell a hundred miles to see her in London, where he frequently had\r\nother engagements, than fifty in the opposite direction where nothing\r\nbut herself required his presence. So here they were, furnished up to\r\nthe attics, in one of the small but popular streets of the West\r\ndistrict, in a house whose front, till lately of the complexion of a\r\nchimney-sweep, had been scraped to show to the surprised wayfarer the\r\nbright yellow and red brick that had lain lurking beneath the soot of\r\nfifty years.\r\n\r\nThe social lift that the two women had derived from the alliance was\r\nconsiderable; but when the exhilaration which accompanies a first\r\nresidence in London, the sensation of standing on a pivot of the world,\r\nhad passed, their lives promised to be somewhat duller than when, at\r\ndespised Exonbury, they had enjoyed a nodding acquaintance with\r\nthree-fourths of the town. Mr. Millborne did not criticise his wife; he\r\ncould not. Whatever defects of hardness and acidity his original\r\ntreatment and the lapse of years might have developed in her, his sense\r\nof a realized idea, of a re-established self-satisfaction, was always\r\nthrown into the scale on her side, and out-weighed all objections.\r\n\r\nIt was about a month after their settlement in town that the household\r\ndecided to spend a week at a watering-place in the Isle of Wight, and\r\nwhile there the Reverend Percival Cope (the young curate aforesaid)\r\ncame to see them, Frances in particular. No formal engagement of the\r\nyoung pair had been announced as yet, but it was clear that their\r\nmutual understanding could not end in anything but marriage without\r\ngrievous disappointment to one of the parties at least. Not that\r\nFrances was sentimental. She was rather of the imperious sort, indeed;\r\nand, to say all, the young girl had not fulfilled her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpectations of her. But he hoped and worked for her welfare as\r\nsincerely as any father could do.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope was introduced to the new head of the family, and stayed with\r\nthem in the Island two or three days. On the last day of his visit they\r\ndecided to venture on a two hours\xe2\x80\x99 sail in one of the small yachts\r\nwhich lay there for hire. The trip had not progressed far before all,\r\nexcept the curate, found that sailing in a breeze did not quite agree\r\nwith them; but as he seemed to enjoy the experience, the other three\r\nbore their condition as well as they could without grimace or\r\ncomplaint, till the young man, observing their discomfort, gave\r\nimmediate directions to tack about. On the way back to port they sat\r\nsilent, facing each other.\r\n\r\nNausea in such circumstances, like midnight watching, fatigue, trouble,\r\nfright, has this marked effect upon the countenance, that it often\r\nbrings out strongly the divergences of the individual from the norm of\r\nhis race, accentuating superficial peculiarities to radical\r\ndistinctions. Unexpected physiognomies will uncover themselves at these\r\ntimes in well-known faces; the aspect becomes invested with the\r\nspectral presence of entombed and forgotten ancestors; and family\r\nlineaments of special or exclusive cast, which in ordinary moments are\r\nmasked by a stereotyped expression and mien, start up with crude\r\ninsistence to the view.\r\n\r\nFrances, sitting beside her mother\xe2\x80\x99s husband, with Mr. Cope opposite,\r\nwas naturally enough much regarded by the curate during the tedious\r\nsail home; at first with sympathetic smiles. Then, as the middle-aged\r\nfather and his child grew each gray-faced, as the pretty blush of\r\nFrances disintegrated into spotty stains, and the soft rotundities of\r\nher features diverged from their familiar and reposeful beauty into\r\nelemental lines, Cope was gradually struck with the resemblance between\r\na pair in their discomfort who in their ease presented nothing to the\r\neye in common. Mr. Millborne and Frances in their indisposition were\r\nstrangely, startlingly alike.\r\n\r\nThe inexplicable fact absorbed Cope\xe2\x80\x99s attention quite. He forgot to\r\nsmile at Frances, to hold her hand; and when they touched the shore he\r\nremained sitting for some moments like a man in a trance.\r\n\r\nAs they went homeward, and recovered their complexions and contours,\r\nthe similarities one by one disappeared, and Frances and Mr. Millborne\r\nwere again masked by the commonplace differences of sex and age. It was\r\nas if, during the voyage, a mysterious veil had been lifted,\r\ntemporarily revealing a strange pantomime of the past.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening he said to her casually: \xe2\x80\x98Is your step-father a\r\ncousin of your mother, dear Frances?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98There is no relationship. He was only an old\r\nfriend of hers. Why did you suppose such a thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not explain, and the next morning started to resume his duties\r\nat Ivell.\r\n\r\nCope was an honest young fellow, and shrewd withal. At home in his\r\nquiet rooms in St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Street, Ivell, he pondered long and\r\nunpleasantly on the revelations of the cruise. The tale it told was\r\ndistinct enough, and for the first time his position was an\r\nuncomfortable one. He had met the Franklands at Exonbury as\r\nparishioners, had been attracted by Frances, and had floated thus far\r\ninto an engagement which was indefinite only because of his inability\r\nto marry just yet. The Franklands\xe2\x80\x99 past had apparently contained\r\nmysteries, and it did not coincide with his judgment to marry into a\r\nfamily whose mystery was of the sort suggested. So he sat and sighed,\r\nbetween his reluctance to lose Frances and his natural dislike of\r\nforming a connection with people whose antecedents would not bear the\r\nstrictest investigation.\r\n\r\nA passionate lover of the old-fashioned sort might possibly never have\r\nhalted to weigh these doubts; but though he was in the church Cope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffections were fastidious\xe2\x80\x94distinctly tempered with the alloys of the\r\ncentury\xe2\x80\x99s decadence. He delayed writing to Frances for some while,\r\nsimply because he could not tune himself up to enthusiasm when worried\r\nby suspicions of such a kind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Millbornes had returned to London, and Frances was\r\ngrowing anxious. In talking to her mother of Cope she had innocently\r\nalluded to his curious inquiry if her mother and her step-father were\r\nconnected by any tie of cousinship. Mrs. Millborne made her repeat the\r\nwords. Frances did so, and watched with inquisitive eyes their effect\r\nupon her elder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is there so startling in his inquiry then?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked. \xe2\x80\x98Can it\r\nhave anything to do with his not writing to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer mother flinched, but did not inform her, and Frances also was now\r\ndrawn within the atmosphere of suspicion. That night when standing by\r\nchance outside the chamber of her parents she heard for the first time\r\ntheir voices engaged in a sharp altercation.\r\n\r\nThe apple of discord had, indeed, been dropped into the house of the\r\nMillbornes. The scene within the chamber-door was Mrs. Millborne\r\nstanding before her dressing-table, looking across to her husband in\r\nthe dressing-room adjoining, where he was sitting down, his eyes fixed\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did you come and disturb my life a second time?\xe2\x80\x99 she harshly\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you pester me with your conscience, till I was driven\r\nto accept you to get rid of your importunity? Frances and I were doing\r\nwell: the one desire of my life was that she should marry that good\r\nyoung man. And now the match is broken off by your cruel interference!\r\nWhy did you show yourself in my world again, and raise this scandal\r\nupon my hard-won respectability\xe2\x80\x94won by such weary years of labour as\r\nnone will ever know!\xe2\x80\x99 She bent her face upon the table and wept\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply from Mr. Millborne. Frances lay awake nearly all\r\nthat night, and when at breakfast-time the next morning still no letter\r\nappeared from Mr. Cope, she entreated her mother to go to Ivell and see\r\nif the young man were ill.\r\n\r\nMrs. Millborne went, returning the same day. Frances, anxious and\r\nhaggard, met her at the station.\r\n\r\nWas all well? Her mother could not say it was; though he was not ill.\r\n\r\nOne thing she had found out, that it was a mistake to hunt up a man\r\nwhen his inclinations were to hold aloof. Returning with her mother in\r\nthe cab Frances insisted upon knowing what the mystery was which\r\nplainly had alienated her lover. The precise words which had been\r\nspoken at the interview with him that day at Ivell Mrs. Millborne could\r\nnot be induced to repeat; but thus far she admitted, that the\r\nestrangement was fundamentally owing to Mr. Millborne having sought her\r\nout and married her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why did he seek you out\xe2\x80\x94and why were you obliged to marry him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked the distressed girl. Then the evidences pieced themselves\r\ntogether in her acute mind, and, her colour gradually rising, she asked\r\nher mother if what they pointed to was indeed the fact. Her mother\r\nadmitted that it was.\r\n\r\nA flush of mortification succeeded to the flush of shame upon the young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s face. How could a scrupulously correct clergyman and lover like\r\nMr. Cope ask her to be his wife after this discovery of her irregular\r\nbirth? She covered her eyes with her hands in a silent despair.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Mr. Millborne they at first suppressed their\r\nanguish. But by and by their feelings got the better of them, and when\r\nhe was asleep in his chair after dinner Mrs. Millborne\xe2\x80\x99s irritation\r\nbroke out. The embittered Frances joined her in reproaching the man who\r\nhad come as the spectre to their intended feast of Hymen, and turned\r\nits promise to ghastly failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why were you so weak, mother, as to admit such an enemy to your\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94one so obviously your evil genius\xe2\x80\x94much less accept him as a\r\nhusband, after so long? If you had only told me all, I could have\r\nadvised you better! But I suppose I have no right to reproach him,\r\nbitter as I feel, and even though he has blighted my life for ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Frances, I did hold out; I saw it was a mistake to have any more to\r\nsay to a man who had been such an unmitigated curse to me! But he would\r\nnot listen; he kept on about his conscience and mine, till I was\r\nbewildered, and said Yes! . . . Bringing us away from a quiet town\r\nwhere we were known and respected\xe2\x80\x94what an ill-considered thing it was!\r\nO the content of those days! We had society there, people in our own\r\nposition, who did not expect more of us than we expected of them. Here,\r\nwhere there is so much, there is nothing! He said London society was so\r\nbright and brilliant that it would be like a new world. It may be to\r\nthose who are in it; but what is that to us two lonely women; we only\r\nsee it flashing past! . . . O the fool, the fool that I was!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow Millborne was not so soundly asleep as to prevent his hearing these\r\nanimadversions that were almost execrations, and many more of the same\r\nsort. As there was no peace for him at home, he went again to his club,\r\nwhere, since his reunion with Leonora, he had seldom if ever been seen.\r\nBut the shadow of the troubles in his household interfered with his\r\ncomfort here also; he could not, as formerly, settle down into his\r\nfavourite chair with the evening paper, reposeful in the celibate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsense that where he was his world\xe2\x80\x99s centre had its fixture. His world\r\nwas now an ellipse, with a dual centrality, of which his own was not\r\nthe major.\r\n\r\nThe young curate of Ivell still held aloof, tantalizing Frances by his\r\nelusiveness. Plainly he was waiting upon events. Millborne bore the\r\nreproaches of his wife and daughter almost in silence; but by degrees\r\nhe grew meditative, as if revolving a new idea. The bitter cry about\r\nblighting their existence at length became so impassioned that one day\r\nMillborne calmly proposed to return again to the country; not\r\nnecessarily to Exonbury, but, if they were willing, to a little old\r\nmanor-house which he had found was to be let, standing a mile from Mr.\r\nCope\xe2\x80\x99s town of Ivell.\r\n\r\nThey were surprised, and, despite their view of him as the bringer of\r\nill, were disposed to accede. \xe2\x80\x98Though I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Millborne\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x98it will end in Mr. Cope\xe2\x80\x99s asking you flatly about the past,\r\nand your being compelled to tell him; which may dash all my hopes for\r\nFrances. She gets more and more like you every day, particularly when\r\nshe is in a bad temper. People will see you together, and notice it;\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may come of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they will see us together,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; but he entered into\r\nno argument when she insisted otherwise. The removal was eventually\r\nresolved on; the town-house was disposed of; and again came the\r\ninvasion by furniture-men and vans, till all the movables and servants\r\nwere whisked away. He sent his wife and daughter to an hotel while this\r\nwas going on, taking two or three journeys himself to Ivell to\r\nsuperintend the refixing, and the improvement of the grounds. When all\r\nwas done he returned to them in town.\r\n\r\nThe house was ready for their reception, he told them, and there only\r\nremained the journey. He accompanied them and their personal luggage to\r\nthe station only, having, he said, to remain in town a short time on\r\nbusiness with his lawyer. They went, dubious and discontented\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nmuch-loved Cope had made no sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we were going down to live here alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Millborne to her\r\ndaughter in the train; \xe2\x80\x98and there was no intrusive tell-tale presence!\r\n. . . But let it be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe house was a lovely little place in a grove of elms, and they liked\r\nit much. The first person to call upon them as new residents was Mr.\r\nCope. He was delighted to find that they had come so near, and (though\r\nhe did not say this) meant to live in such excellent style. He had not,\r\nhowever, resumed the manner of a lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your father spoils all!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mrs. Millborne.\r\n\r\nBut three days later she received a letter from her husband, which\r\ncaused her no small degree of astonishment. It was written from\r\nBoulogne.\r\n\r\nIt began with a long explanation of settlements of his property, in\r\nwhich he had been engaged since their departure. The chief feature in\r\nthe business was that Mrs. Millborne found herself the absolute owner\r\nof a comfortable sum in personal estate, and Frances of a life-interest\r\nin a larger sum, the principal to be afterwards divided amongst her\r\nchildren if she had any. The remainder of his letter ran as hereunder:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have learnt that there are some derelictions of duty which cannot be\r\nblotted out by tardy accomplishment. Our evil actions do not remain\r\nisolated in the past, waiting only to be reversed: like locomotive\r\nplants they spread and re-root, till to destroy the original stem has\r\nno material effect in killing them. I made a mistake in searching you\r\nout; I admit it; whatever the remedy may be in such cases it is not\r\nmarriage, and the best thing for you and me is that you do not see me\r\nmore. You had better not seek me, for you will not be likely to find\r\nme: you are well provided for, and we may do ourselves more harm than\r\ngood by meeting again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98F. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMillborne, in short, disappeared from that day forward. But a searching\r\ninquiry would have revealed that, soon after the Millbornes went to\r\nIvell, an Englishman, who did not give the name of Millborne, took up\r\nhis residence in Brussels; a man who might have been recognized by Mrs.\r\nMillborne if she had met him. One afternoon in the ensuing summer, when\r\nthis gentleman was looking over the English papers, he saw the\r\nannouncement of Miss Frances Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. She had become the\r\nReverend Mrs. Cope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank God!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nBut his momentary satisfaction was far from being happiness. As he\r\nformerly had been weighted with a bad conscience, so now was he\r\nburdened with the heavy thought which oppressed Antigone, that by\r\nhonourable observance of a rite he had obtained for himself the reward\r\nof dishonourable laxity. Occasionally he had to be helped to his\r\nlodgings by his servant from the _Cercle_ he frequented, through having\r\nimbibed a little too much liquor to be able to take care of himself.\r\nBut he was harmless, and even when he had been drinking said little.\r\n\r\n_March_ 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAGEDY OF TWO AMBITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the village-boys came in at the window, accompanied by\r\nbroken laughter from loungers at the inn-door; but the brothers\r\nHalborough worked on.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in a bedroom of the master-millwright\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nengaged in the untutored reading of Greek and Latin. It was no tale of\r\nHomeric blows and knocks, Argonautic voyaging, or Theban family woe\r\nthat inflamed their imaginations and spurred them onward. They were\r\nplodding away at the Greek Testament, immersed in a chapter of the\r\nidiomatic and difficult Epistle to the Hebrews.\r\n\r\nThe Dog-day sun in its decline reached the low ceiling with slanting\r\nsides, and the shadows of the great goat\xe2\x80\x99s-willow swayed and\r\ninterchanged upon the walls like a spectral army manoeuvring. The open\r\ncasement which admitted the remoter sounds now brought the voice of\r\nsome one close at hand. It was their sister, a pretty girl of fourteen,\r\nwho stood in the court below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can see the tops of your heads! What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of staying up there?\r\nI like you not to go out with the street-boys; but do come and play\r\nwith me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey treated her as an inadequate interlocutor, and put her off with\r\nsome slight word. She went away disappointed. Presently there was a\r\ndull noise of heavy footsteps at the side of the house, and one of the\r\nbrothers sat up. \xe2\x80\x98I fancy I hear him coming,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, his eyes on\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nA man in the light drab clothes of an old-fashioned country tradesman\r\napproached from round the corner, reeling as he came. The elder son\r\nflushed with anger, rose from his books, and descended the stairs. The\r\nyounger sat on, till, after the lapse of a few minutes, his brother\r\nre-entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did Rosa see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor anybody?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you done with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s in the straw-shed. I got him in with some trouble, and he has\r\nfallen asleep. I thought this would be the explanation of his absence!\r\nNo stones dressed for Miller Kench, the great wheel of the saw-mills\r\nwaiting for new float-boards, even the poor folk not able to get their\r\nwaggons wheeled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What _is_ the use of poring over this!\xe2\x80\x99 said the younger, shutting up\r\nDonnegan\xe2\x80\x99s _Lexicon_ with a slap. \xe2\x80\x98O if we had only been able to keep\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s nine hundred pounds, what we could have done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How well she had estimated the sum necessary! Four hundred and fifty\r\neach, she thought. And I have no doubt that we could have done it on\r\nthat, with care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis loss of the nine hundred pounds was the sharp thorn of their\r\ncrown. It was a sum which their mother had amassed with great exertion\r\nand self-denial, by adding to a chance legacy such other small amounts\r\nas she could lay hands on from time to time; and she had intended with\r\nthe hoard to indulge the dear wish of her heart\xe2\x80\x94that of sending her\r\nsons, Joshua and Cornelius, to one of the Universities, having been\r\ninformed that from four hundred to four hundred and fifty each might\r\ncarry them through their terms with such great economy as she knew she\r\ncould trust them to practise. But she had died a year or two before\r\nthis time, worn out by too keen a strain towards these ends; and the\r\nmoney, coming unreservedly into the hands of their father, had been\r\nnearly dissipated. With its exhaustion went all opportunity and hope of\r\na university degree for the sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It drives me mad when I think of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua, the elder. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nhere we work and work in our own bungling way, and the utmost we can\r\nhope for is a term of years as national schoolmasters, and possible\r\nadmission to a Theological college, and ordination as despised\r\nlicentiates.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe anger of the elder was reflected as simple sadness in the face of\r\nthe other. \xe2\x80\x98We can preach the Gospel as well without a hood on our\r\nsurplices as with one,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with feeble consolation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Preach the Gospel\xe2\x80\x94true,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua with a slight pursing of mouth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we can\xe2\x80\x99t rise!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us make the best of it, and grind on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe other was silent, and they drearily bent over their books again.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all this gloom, the millwright Halborough, now snoring in\r\nthe shed, had been a thriving master-machinist, notwithstanding his\r\nfree and careless disposition, till a taste for a more than adequate\r\nquantity of strong liquor took hold of him; since when his habits had\r\ninterfered with his business sadly. Already millers went elsewhere for\r\ntheir gear, and only one set of hands was now kept going, though there\r\nwere formerly two. Already he found a difficulty in meeting his men at\r\nthe week\xe2\x80\x99s end, and though they had been reduced in number there was\r\nbarely enough work to do for those who remained.\r\n\r\nThe sun dropped lower and vanished, the shouts of the village children\r\nceased to resound, darkness cloaked the students\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom, and all the\r\nscene outwardly breathed peace. None knew of the fevered youthful\r\nambitions that throbbed in two breasts within the quiet creeper-covered\r\nwalls of the millwright\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nIn a few months the brothers left the village of their birth to enter\r\nthemselves as students in a training college for schoolmasters; first\r\nhaving placed their young sister Rosa under as efficient a tuition at a\r\nfashionable watering-place as the means at their disposal could\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA man in semi-clerical dress was walking along the road which led from\r\nthe railway-station into a provincial town. As he walked he read\r\npersistently, only looking up once now and then to see that he was\r\nkeeping on the foot track and to avoid other passengers. At those\r\nmoments, whoever had known the former students at the millwright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwould have perceived that one of them, Joshua Halborough, was the\r\nperipatetic reader here.\r\n\r\nWhat had been simple force in the youth\xe2\x80\x99s face was energized judgment\r\nin the man\xe2\x80\x99s. His character was gradually writing itself out in his\r\ncountenance. That he was watching his own career with deeper and deeper\r\ninterest, that he continually \xe2\x80\x98heard his days before him,\xe2\x80\x99 and cared to\r\nhear little else, might have been hazarded from what was seen there.\r\nHis ambitions were, in truth, passionate, yet controlled; so that the\r\ngerms of many more plans than ever blossomed to maturity had place in\r\nhim; and forward visions were kept purposely in twilight, to avoid\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nEvents so far had been encouraging. Shortly after assuming the\r\nmastership of his first school he had obtained an introduction to the\r\nBishop of a diocese far from his native county, who had looked upon him\r\nas a promising young man and taken him in hand. He was now in the\r\nsecond year of his residence at the theological college of the\r\ncathedral-town, and would soon be presented for ordination.\r\n\r\nHe entered the town, turned into a back street, and then into a yard,\r\nkeeping his book before him till he set foot under the arch of the\r\nlatter place. Round the arch was written \xe2\x80\x98National School,\xe2\x80\x99 and the\r\nstonework of the jambs was worn away as nothing but boys and the waves\r\nof ocean will wear it. He was soon amid the sing-song accents of the\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nHis brother Cornelius, who was the schoolmaster here, laid down the\r\npointer with which he was directing attention to the Capes of Europe,\r\nand came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s his brother Jos!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered one of the sixth standard boys.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a pa\xe2\x80\x99son, he\xe2\x80\x99s now at college.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Corney is going to be one too, when he\xe2\x80\x99s saved enough money,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAfter greeting his brother, whom he had not seen for several months,\r\nthe junior began to explain his system of teaching geography.\r\n\r\nBut Halborough the elder took no interest in the subject. \xe2\x80\x98How about\r\nyour own studies?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98Did you get the books I sent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCornelius had received them, and he related what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mind you work in the morning. What time do you get up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe younger replied: \xe2\x80\x98Half-past five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half-past four is not a minute too soon this time of the year. There\r\nis no time like the morning for construing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but when\r\nI feel even too dreary to read a novel I can translate\xe2\x80\x94there is\r\nsomething mechanical about it I suppose. Now, Cornelius, you are rather\r\nbehindhand, and have some heavy reading before you if you mean to get\r\nout of this next Christmas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must soon sound the Bishop. I am sure you will get a title without\r\ndifficulty when he has heard all. The sub-dean, the principal of my\r\ncollege, says that the best plan will be for you to come there when his\r\nlordship is present at an examination, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a personal\r\ninterview with him. Mind you make a good impression upon him. I found\r\nin my case that that was everything and doctrine almost nothing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo for a deacon, Corney, if not for a priest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe younger remained thoughtful. \xe2\x80\x98Have you heard from Rosa lately?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nasked; \xe2\x80\x98I had a letter this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. The little minx writes rather too often. She is homesick\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nBrussels must be an attractive place enough. But she must make the most\r\nof her time over there. I thought a year would be enough for her, after\r\nthat high-class school at Sandbourne, but I have decided to give her\r\ntwo, and make a good job of it, expensive as the establishment is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir two rather harsh faces had softened directly they began to speak\r\nof their sister, whom they loved more ambitiously than they loved\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But where is the money to come from, Joshua?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have already got it.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked round, and finding that some boys\r\nwere near withdrew a few steps. \xe2\x80\x98I have borrowed it at five per cent.\r\nfrom the farmer who used to occupy the farm next our field. You\r\nremember him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But about paying him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall pay him by degrees out of my stipend. No, Cornelius, it was no\r\nuse to do the thing by halves. She promises to be a most attractive,\r\nnot to say beautiful, girl. I have seen that for years; and if her face\r\nis not her fortune, her face and her brains together will be, if I\r\nobserve and contrive aright. That she should be, every inch of her, an\r\naccomplished and refined woman, was indispensable for the fulfilment of\r\nher destiny, and for moving onwards and upwards with us; and she\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit, you will see. I\xe2\x80\x99d half starve myself rather than take her away from\r\nthat school now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey looked round the school they were in. To Cornelius it was natural\r\nand familiar enough, but to Joshua, with his limited human sympathies,\r\nwho had just dropped in from a superior sort of place, the sight jarred\r\nunpleasantly, as being that of something he had left behind. \xe2\x80\x98I shall\r\nbe glad when you are out of this,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and in your pulpit, and\r\nwell through your first sermon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may as well say inducted into my fat living, while you are about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, well\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think lightly of the Church. There\xe2\x80\x99s a fine work for\r\nany man of energy in the Church, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll find,\xe2\x80\x99 he said fervidly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Torrents of infidelity to be stemmed, new views of old subjects to be\r\nexpounded, truths in spirit to be substituted for truths in the letter\r\n. . . \xe2\x80\x99 He lapsed into reverie with the vision of his career,\r\npersuading himself that it was ardour for Christianity which spurred\r\nhim on, and not pride of place. He had shouldered a body of doctrine,\r\nand was prepared to defend it tooth and nail, solely for the honour and\r\nglory that warriors win.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the Church is elastic, and stretches to the shape of the time,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll last, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cornelius. \xe2\x80\x98If not\xe2\x80\x94. Only think, I bought\r\na copy of Paley\xe2\x80\x99s _Evidences_, best edition, broad margins, excellent\r\npreservation, at a bookstall the other day for\xe2\x80\x94ninepence; and I thought\r\nthat at this rate Christianity must be in rather a bad way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no!\xe2\x80\x99 said the other almost, angrily. \xe2\x80\x98It only shows that such\r\ndefences are no longer necessary. Men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes can see the truth without\r\nextraneous assistance. Besides, we are in for Christianity, and must\r\nstick to her whether or no. I am just now going right through Pusey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Library of the Fathers_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be a bishop, Joshua, before you have done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the other bitterly, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I might have\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94I might have been! But where is my D.D. or LL.D.; and how be a\r\nbishop without that kind of appendage? Archbishop Tillotson was the son\r\nof a Sowerby clothier, but he was sent to Clare College. To hail Oxford\r\nor Cambridge as _alma mater_ is not for me\xe2\x80\x94for us! My God! when I think\r\nof what we should have been\xe2\x80\x94what fair promise has been blighted by that\r\ncursed, worthless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, hush! . . . But I feel it, too, as much as you. I have seen it\r\nmore forcibly lately. You would have obtained your degree long before\r\nthis time\xe2\x80\x94possibly fellowship\xe2\x80\x94and I should have been on my way to\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other. \xe2\x80\x98We must do the best we can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey looked out of the window sadly, through the dusty panes, so high\r\nup that only the sky was visible. By degrees the haunting trouble\r\nloomed again, and Cornelius broke the silence with a whisper: \xe2\x80\x98He has\r\ncalled on me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe living pulses died on Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s face, which grew arid as a clinker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When was that?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did he get here\xe2\x80\x94so many miles?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Came by railway. He came to ask for money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says he will call on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJoshua replied resignedly. The theme of their conversation spoilt his\r\nbuoyancy for that afternoon. He returned in the evening, Cornelius\r\naccompanying him to the station; but he did not read in the train which\r\ntook him back to the Fountall Theological College, as he had done on\r\nthe way out. That ineradicable trouble still remained as a squalid spot\r\nin the expanse of his life. He sat with the other students in the\r\ncathedral choir next day; and the recollection of the trouble obscured\r\nthe purple splendour thrown by the panes upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon. All was as still in the Close as a cathedral-green\r\ncan be between the Sunday services, and the incessant cawing of the\r\nrooks was the only sound. Joshua Halborough had finished his ascetic\r\nlunch, and had gone into the library, where he stood for a few moments\r\nlooking out of the large window facing the green. He saw walking slowly\r\nacross it a man in a fustian coat and a battered white hat with a\r\nmuch-ruffled nap, having upon his arm a tall gipsy-woman wearing long\r\nbrass earrings. The man was staring quizzically at the west front of\r\nthe cathedral, and Halborough recognized in him the form and features\r\nof his father. Who the woman was he knew not. Almost as soon as Joshua\r\nbecame conscious of these things, the sub-dean, who was also the\r\nprincipal of the college, and of whom the young man stood in more awe\r\nthan of the Bishop himself, emerged from the gate and entered a path\r\nacross the Close. The pair met the dignitary, and to Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s horror\r\nhis father turned and addressed the sub-dean.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between them he could not tell. But as he stood in a cold\r\nsweat he saw his father place his hand familiarly on the sub-dean\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder; the shrinking response of the latter, and his quick\r\nwithdrawal, told his feeling. The woman seemed to say nothing, but when\r\nthe sub-dean had passed by they came on towards the college gate.\r\n\r\nHalborough flew along the corridor and out at a side door, so as to\r\nintercept them before they could reach the front entrance, for which\r\nthey were making. He caught them behind a clump of laurel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jerry, here\xe2\x80\x99s the very chap! Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow, Jos, never\r\nto send your father as much as a twist o\xe2\x80\x99 baccy on such an occasion,\r\nand to leave him to travel all these miles to find ye out!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First, who is this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua Halborough with pale dignity, waving\r\nhis hand towards the buxom woman with the great earrings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dammy, the mis\xe2\x80\x99ess! Your step-mother! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know I\xe2\x80\x99d married? She\r\nhelped me home from market one night, and we came to terms, and struck\r\nthe bargain. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t we, Selinar?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oi, by the great Lord an\xe2\x80\x99 we did!\xe2\x80\x99 simpered the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what sort of a place is this you are living in?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the\r\nmillwright. \xe2\x80\x98A kind of house-of-correction, apparently?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJoshua listened abstractedly, his features set to resignation. Sick at\r\nheart he was going to ask them if they were in want of any necessary,\r\nany meal, when his father cut him short by saying, \xe2\x80\x98Why, we\xe2\x80\x99ve called\r\nto ask ye to come round and take pot-luck with us at the\r\nCock-and-Bottle, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve put up for the day, on our way to see\r\nmis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99s friends at Binegar Fair, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll be lying under canvas\r\nfor a night or two. As for the victuals at the Cock I can\xe2\x80\x99t testify to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em at all; but for the drink, they\xe2\x80\x99ve the rarest drop of Old Tom that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve tasted for many a year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks; but I am a teetotaller; and I have lunched,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua, who\r\ncould fully believe his father\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to the gin, from the odour\r\nof his breath. \xe2\x80\x98You see we have to observe regular habits here; and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be seen at the Cock-and-Bottle just now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O dammy, then don\xe2\x80\x99t come, your reverence. Perhaps you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nstanding treat for those who can be seen there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a penny,\xe2\x80\x99 said the younger firmly. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for nothing. By the bye, who was that spindle-legged,\r\nshoe-buckled parson feller we met by now? He seemed to think we should\r\npoison him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJoshua remarked coldly that it was the principal of his college,\r\nguardedly inquiring, \xe2\x80\x98Did you tell him whom you were come to see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis father did not reply. He and his strapping gipsy wife\xe2\x80\x94if she were\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x94stayed no longer, and disappeared in the direction of the High\r\nStreet. Joshua Halborough went back to the library. Determined as was\r\nhis nature, he wept hot tears upon the books, and was immeasurably more\r\nwretched that afternoon than the unwelcome millwright. In the evening\r\nhe sat down and wrote a letter to his brother, in which, after stating\r\nwhat had happened, and expatiating upon this new disgrace in the gipsy\r\nwife, he propounded a plan for raising money sufficient to induce the\r\ncouple to emigrate to Canada. \xe2\x80\x98It is our only chance,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ncase as it stands is maddening. For a successful painter, sculptor,\r\nmusician, author, who takes society by storm, it is no drawback, it is\r\nsometimes even a romantic recommendation, to hail from outcasts and\r\nprofligates. But for a clergyman of the Church of England! Cornelius,\r\nit is fatal! To succeed in the Church, people must believe in you,\r\nfirst of all, as a gentleman, secondly as a man of means, thirdly as a\r\nscholar, fourthly as a preacher, fifthly, perhaps, as a Christian,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nalways first as a gentleman, with all their heart and soul and\r\nstrength. I would have faced the fact of being a small machinist\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nand have taken my chance, if he\xe2\x80\x99d been in any sense respectable and\r\ndecent. The essence of Christianity is humility, and by the help of God\r\nI would have brazened it out. But this terrible vagabondage and\r\ndisreputable connection! If he does not accept my terms and leave the\r\ncountry, it will extinguish us and kill me. For how can we live, and\r\nrelinquish our high aim, and bring down our dear sister Rosa to the\r\nlevel of a gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s step-daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThere was excitement in the parish of Narrobourne one day. The\r\ncongregation had just come out from morning service, and the whole\r\nconversation was of the new curate, Mr. Halborough, who had officiated\r\nfor the first time, in the absence of the rector.\r\n\r\nNever before had the feeling of the villagers approached a level which\r\ncould be called excitement on such a matter as this. The droning which\r\nhad been the rule in that quiet old place for a century seemed ended at\r\nlast. They repeated the text to each other as a refrain: \xe2\x80\x98O Lord, be\r\nthou my helper!\xe2\x80\x99 Not within living memory till to-day had the subject\r\nof the sermon formed the topic of conversation from the church door to\r\nchurch-yard gate, to the exclusion of personal remarks on those who had\r\nbeen present, and on the week\xe2\x80\x99s news in general.\r\n\r\nThe thrilling periods of the preacher hung about their minds all that\r\nday. The parish being steeped in indifferentism, it happened that when\r\nthe youths and maidens, middle-aged and old people, who had attended\r\nchurch that morning, recurred as by a fascination to what Halborough\r\nhad said, they did so more or less indirectly, and even with the\r\nsubterfuge of a light laugh that was not real, so great was their\r\nshyness under the novelty of their sensations.\r\n\r\nWhat was more curious than that these unconventional villagers should\r\nhave been excited by a preacher of a new school after forty years of\r\nfamiliarity with the old hand who had had charge of their souls, was\r\nthe effect of Halborough\xe2\x80\x99s address upon the occupants of the\r\nmanor-house pew, including the owner of the estate. These thought they\r\nknew how to discount the mere sensational sermon, how to minimize flash\r\noratory to its bare proportions; but they had yielded like the rest of\r\nthe assembly to the charm of the newcomer.\r\n\r\nMr. Fellmer, the landowner, was a young widower, whose mother, still in\r\nthe prime of life, had returned to her old position in the family\r\nmansion since the death of her son\xe2\x80\x99s wife in the year after her\r\nmarriage, at the birth of a fragile little girl. From the date of his\r\nloss to the present time, Fellmer had led an inactive existence in the\r\nseclusion of the parish; a lack of motive seemed to leave him listless.\r\nHe had gladly reinstated his mother in the gloomy house, and his main\r\noccupation now lay in stewarding his estate, which was not large. Mrs.\r\nFellmer, who had sat beside him under Halborough this morning, was a\r\ncheerful, straightforward woman, who did her marketing and her\r\nalms-giving in person, was fond of old-fashioned flowers, and walked\r\nabout the village on very wet days visiting the parishioners. These,\r\nthe only two great ones of Narrobourne, were impressed by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neloquence as much as the cottagers.\r\n\r\nHalborough had been briefly introduced to them on his arrival some days\r\nbefore, and, their interest being kindled, they waited a few moments\r\ntill he came out of the vestry, to walk down the churchyard-path with\r\nhim. Mrs. Fellmer spoke warmly of the sermon, of the good fortune of\r\nthe parish in his advent, and hoped he had found comfortable quarters.\r\n\r\nHalborough, faintly flushing, said that he had obtained very fair\r\nlodgings in the roomy house of a farmer, whom he named.\r\n\r\nShe feared he would find it very lonely, especially in the evenings,\r\nand hoped they would see a good deal of him. When would he dine with\r\nthem? Could he not come that day\xe2\x80\x94it must be so dull for him the first\r\nSunday evening in country lodgings?\r\n\r\nHalborough replied that it would give him much pleasure, but that he\r\nfeared he must decline. \xe2\x80\x98I am not altogether alone,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nsister, who has just returned from Brussels, and who felt, as you do,\r\nthat I should be rather dismal by myself, has accompanied me hither to\r\nstay a few days till she has put my rooms in order and set me going.\r\nShe was too fatigued to come to church, and is waiting for me now at\r\nthe farm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but bring your sister\xe2\x80\x94that will be still better! I shall be\r\ndelighted to know her. How I wish I had been aware! Do tell her,\r\nplease, that we had no idea of her presence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHalborough assured Mrs. Fellmer that he would certainly bear the\r\nmessage; but as to her coming he was not so sure. The real truth was,\r\nhowever, that the matter would be decided by him, Rosa having an almost\r\nfilial respect for his wishes. But he was uncertain as to the state of\r\nher wardrobe, and had determined that she should not enter the\r\nmanor-house at a disadvantage that evening, when there would probably\r\nbe plenty of opportunities in the future of her doing so becomingly.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the farm in long strides. This, then, was the outcome of\r\nhis first morning\xe2\x80\x99s work as curate here. Things had gone fairly well\r\nwith him. He had been ordained; he was in a comfortable parish, where\r\nhe would exercise almost sole supervision, the rector being infirm. He\r\nhad made a deep impression at starting, and the absence of a hood\r\nseemed to have done him no harm. Moreover, by considerable persuasion\r\nand payment, his father and the dark woman had been shipped off to\r\nCanada, where they were not likely to interfere greatly with his\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nRosa came out to meet him. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! you should have gone to church like a\r\ngood girl,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94I wished I had afterwards. But I do so hate church as a rule that\r\neven your preaching was underestimated in my mind. It was too bad of\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl who spoke thus playfully was fair, tall, and sylph-like, in a\r\nmuslin dress, and with just the coquettish _d\xc3\xa9sinvolture_ which an\r\nEnglish girl brings home from abroad, and loses again after a few\r\nmonths of native life. Joshua was the reverse of playful; the world was\r\ntoo important a concern for him to indulge in light moods. He told her\r\nin decided, practical phraseology of the invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Rosa, we must go\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s settled\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ve a dress that can be\r\nmade fit to wear all on the hop like this. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t, of course, think\r\nof bringing an evening dress to such an out-of-the-way place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Rosa had come from the wrong city to be caught napping in those\r\nmatters. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98One never knows what may turn up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done! Then off we go at seven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe evening drew on, and at dusk they started on foot, Rosa pulling up\r\nthe edge of her skirt under her cloak out of the way of the dews, so\r\nthat it formed a great wind-bag all round her, and carrying her satin\r\nshoes under her arm. Joshua would not let her wait till she got indoors\r\nbefore changing them, as she proposed, but insisted on her performing\r\nthat operation under a tree, so that they might enter as if they had\r\nnot walked. He was nervously formal about such trifles, while Rosa took\r\nthe whole proceeding\xe2\x80\x94walk, dressing, dinner, and all\xe2\x80\x94as a pastime. To\r\nJoshua it was a serious step in life.\r\n\r\nA more unexpected kind of person for a curate\xe2\x80\x99s sister was never\r\npresented at a dinner. The surprise of Mrs. Fellmer was unconcealed.\r\nShe had looked forward to a Dorcas, or Martha, or Rhoda at the outside,\r\nand a shade of misgiving crossed her face. It was possible that, had\r\nthe young lady accompanied her brother to church, there would have been\r\nno dining at Narrobourne House that day.\r\n\r\nNot so with the young widower, her son. He resembled a sleeper who had\r\nawaked in a summer noon expecting to find it only dawn. He could\r\nscarcely help stretching his arms and yawning in their faces, so strong\r\nwas his sense of being suddenly aroused to an unforeseen thing. When\r\nthey had sat down to table he at first talked to Rosa somewhat with the\r\nair of a ruler in the land; but the woman lurking in the acquaintance\r\nsoon brought him to his level, and the girl from Brussels saw him\r\nlooking at her mouth, her hands, her contour, as if he could not quite\r\ncomprehend how they got created: then he dropped into the more\r\nsatisfactory stage which discerns no particulars.\r\n\r\nHe talked but little; she said much. The homeliness of the Fellmers, to\r\nher view, though they were regarded with such awe down here, quite\r\ndisembarrassed her. The squire had become so unpractised, had dropped\r\nso far into the shade during the last year or so of his life, that he\r\nhad almost forgotten what the world contained till this evening\r\nreminded him. His mother, after her first moments of doubt, appeared to\r\nthink that he must be left to his own guidance, and gave her attention\r\nto Joshua.\r\n\r\nWith all his foresight and doggedness of aim, the result of that dinner\r\nexceeded Halborough\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. In weaving his ambitions he had\r\nviewed his sister Rosa as a slight, bright thing to be helped into\r\nnotice by his abilities; but it now began to dawn upon him that the\r\nphysical gifts of nature to her might do more for them both than\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual gifts to himself. While he was patiently boring\r\nthe tunnel Rosa seemed about to fly over the mountain.\r\n\r\nHe wrote the next day to his brother, now occupying his own old rooms\r\nin the theological college, telling him exultingly of the unanticipated\r\n_d\xc3\xa9but_ of Rosa at the manor-house. The next post brought him a reply\r\nof congratulation, dashed with the counteracting intelligence that his\r\nfather did not like Canada\xe2\x80\x94that his wife had deserted him, which made\r\nhim feel so dreary that he thought of returning home.\r\n\r\nIn his recent satisfaction at his own successes Joshua Halborough had\r\nwell-nigh forgotten his chronic trouble\xe2\x80\x94latterly screened by distance.\r\nBut it now returned upon him; he saw more in this brief announcement\r\nthan his brother seemed to see. It was the cloud no bigger than a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe following December, a day or two before Christmas, Mrs. Fellmer and\r\nher son were walking up and down the broad gravel path which bordered\r\nthe east front of the house. Till within the last half-hour the morning\r\nhad been a drizzling one, and they had just emerged for a short turn\r\nbefore luncheon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, dear mother,\xe2\x80\x99 the son was saying, \xe2\x80\x98it is the peculiarity of\r\nmy position which makes her appear to me in such a desirable light.\r\nWhen you consider how I have been crippled at starting, how my life has\r\nbeen maimed; that I feel anything like publicity distasteful, that I\r\nhave no political ambition, and that my chief aim and hope lie in the\r\neducation of the little thing Annie has left me, you must see how\r\ndesirable a wife like Miss Halborough would be, to prevent my becoming\r\na mere vegetable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you adore her, I suppose you must have her!\xe2\x80\x99 replied his mother\r\nwith dry indirectness. \xe2\x80\x98But you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that she will not be content to\r\nlive on here as you do, giving her whole mind to a young child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s just where we differ. Her very disqualification, that of being\r\na nobody, as you call it, is her recommendation in my eyes. Her lack of\r\ninfluential connections limits her ambition. From what I know of her, a\r\nlife in this place is all that she would wish for. She would never care\r\nto go outside the park-gates if it were necessary to stay within.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Being in love with her, Albert, and meaning to marry her, you invent\r\nyour practical reasons to make the case respectable. Well, do as you\r\nwill; I have no authority over you, so why should you consult me? You\r\nmean to propose on this very occasion, no doubt. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By no means. I am merely revolving the idea in my mind. If on further\r\nacquaintance she turns out to be as good as she has hitherto\r\nseemed\xe2\x80\x94well, I shall see. Admit, now, that you like her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I readily admit it. She is very captivating at first sight. But as a\r\nstepmother to your child! You seem mighty anxious, Albert, to get rid\r\nof me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all. And I am not so reckless as you think. I don\xe2\x80\x99t make up my\r\nmind in a hurry. But the thought having occurred to me, I mention it to\r\nyou at once, mother. If you dislike it, say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. I will try to make the best of it if you are\r\ndetermined. When does she come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this time there were great preparations in train at the curate\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho was now a householder. Rosa, whose two or three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 stay on two\r\noccasions earlier in the year had so affected the squire, was coming\r\nagain, and at the same time her younger brother Cornelius, to make up a\r\nfamily party. Rosa, who journeyed from the Midlands, could not arrive\r\ntill late in the evening, but Cornelius was to get there in the\r\nafternoon, Joshua going out to meet him in his walk across the fields\r\nfrom the railway.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready in Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s modest abode he started on his way,\r\nhis heart buoyant and thankful, if ever it was in his life. He was of\r\nsuch good report himself that his brother\xe2\x80\x99s path into holy orders\r\npromised to be unexpectedly easy; and he longed to compare experiences\r\nwith him, even though there was on hand a more exciting matter still.\r\nFrom his youth he had held that, in old-fashioned country places, the\r\nChurch conferred social prestige up to a certain point at a cheaper\r\nprice than any other profession or pursuit; and events seemed to be\r\nproving him right.\r\n\r\nHe had walked about half an hour when he saw Cornelius coming along the\r\npath; and in a few minutes the two brothers met. The experiences of\r\nCornelius had been less immediately interesting than those of Joshua,\r\nbut his personal position was satisfactory, and there was nothing to\r\naccount for the singularly subdued manner that he exhibited, which at\r\nfirst Joshua set down to the fatigue of over-study; and he proceeded to\r\nthe subject of Rosa\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the evening, and the probable\r\nconsequences of this her third visit. \xe2\x80\x98Before next Easter she\xe2\x80\x99ll be his\r\nwife, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua with grave exultation.\r\n\r\nCornelius shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98She comes too late!\xe2\x80\x99 he returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here.\xe2\x80\x99 He produced the Fountall paper, and placed his finger on a\r\nparagraph, which Joshua read. It appeared under the report of Petty\r\nSessions, and was a commonplace case of disorderly conduct, in which a\r\nman was sent to prison for seven days for breaking windows in that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It happened during an evening that I was in the street; and the\r\noffender is our father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x94I sent him more money on his promising to stay in Canada?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is home, safe enough.\xe2\x80\x99 Cornelius in the same gloomy tone gave the\r\nremainder of his information. He had witnessed the scene, unobserved of\r\nhis father, and had heard him say that he was on his way to see his\r\ndaughter, who was going to marry a rich gentleman. The only good\r\nfortune attending the untoward incident was that the millwright\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nhad been printed as Joshua Alborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beaten! We are to be beaten on the eve of our expected victory!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe elder brother. \xe2\x80\x98How did he guess that Rosa was likely to marry?\r\nGood Heaven Cornelius, you seem doomed to bring bad news always, do you\r\nnot!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cornelius. \xe2\x80\x98Poor Rosa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was almost in tears, so great was their heart-sickness and shame,\r\nthat the brothers walked the remainder of the way to Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling.\r\nIn the evening they set out to meet Rosa, bringing her to the village\r\nin a fly; and when she had come into the house, and was sitting down\r\nwith them, they almost forgot their secret anxiety in contemplating\r\nher, who knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nNext day the Fellmers came, and the two or three days after that were a\r\nlively time. That the squire was yielding to his impulses\xe2\x80\x94making up his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94there could be no doubt. On Sunday Cornelius read the lessons, and\r\nJoshua preached. Mrs. Fellmer was quite maternal towards Rosa, and it\r\nappeared that she had decided to welcome the inevitable with a good\r\ngrace. The pretty girl was to spend yet another afternoon with the\r\nelder lady, superintending some parish treat at the house in observance\r\nof Christmas, and afterwards to stay on to dinner, her brothers to\r\nfetch her in the evening. They were also invited to dine, but they\r\ncould not accept owing to an engagement.\r\n\r\nThe engagement was of a sombre sort. They were going to meet their\r\nfather, who would that day be released from Fountall Gaol, and try to\r\npersuade him to keep away from Narrobourne. Every exertion was to be\r\nmade to get him back to Canada, to his old home in the\r\nMidlands\xe2\x80\x94anywhere, so that he would not impinge disastrously upon their\r\ncourses, and blast their sister\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of the auspicious marriage\r\nwhich was just then hanging in the balance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rosa had been fetched away by her friends at the manor-house\r\nher brothers started on their expedition, without waiting for dinner or\r\ntea. Cornelius, to whom the millwright always addressed his letters\r\nwhen he wrote any, drew from his pocket and re-read as he walked the\r\ncurt note which had led to this journey being undertaken; it was\r\ndespatched by their father the night before, immediately upon his\r\nliberation, and stated that he was setting out for Narrobourne at the\r\nmoment of writing; that having no money he would be obliged to walk all\r\nthe way; that he calculated on passing through the intervening town of\r\nIvell about six on the following day, where he should sup at the Castle\r\nInn, and where he hoped they would meet him with a carriage-and-pair,\r\nor some other such conveyance, that he might not disgrace them by\r\narriving like a tramp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That sounds as if he gave a thought to our position,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cornelius.\r\n\r\nJoshua knew the satire that lurked in the paternal words, and said\r\nnothing. Silence prevailed during the greater part of their journey.\r\nThe lamps were lighted in Ivell when they entered the streets, and\r\nCornelius, who was quite unknown in this neighbourhood, and who,\r\nmoreover, was not in clerical attire, decided that he should be the one\r\nto call at the Castle Inn. Here, in answer to his inquiry under the\r\ndarkness of the archway, they told him that such a man as he had\r\ndescribed left the house about a quarter of an hour earlier, after\r\nmaking a meal in the kitchen-settle. He was rather the worse for\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua, when Cornelius joined him outside with this\r\nintelligence, \xe2\x80\x98we must have met and passed him! And now that I think of\r\nit, we did meet some one who was unsteady in his gait, under the trees\r\non the other side of Hendford Hill, where it was too dark to see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey rapidly retraced their steps; but for a long stretch of the way\r\nhome could discern nobody. When, however, they had gone about\r\nthree-quarters of the distance, they became conscious of an irregular\r\nfootfall in front of them, and could see a whitish figure in the gloom.\r\nThey followed dubiously. The figure met another wayfarer\xe2\x80\x94the single one\r\nthat had been encountered upon this lonely road\xe2\x80\x94and they distinctly\r\nheard him ask the way to Narrobourne. The stranger replied\xe2\x80\x94what was\r\nquite true\xe2\x80\x94that the nearest way was by turning in at the stile by the\r\nnext bridge, and following the footpath which branched thence across\r\nthe meadows.\r\n\r\nWhen the brothers reached the stile they also entered the path, but did\r\nnot overtake the subject of their worry till they had crossed two or\r\nthree meads, and the lights from Narrobourne manor-house were visible\r\nbefore them through the trees. Their father was no longer walking; he\r\nwas seated against the wet bank of an adjoining hedge. Observing their\r\nforms he shouted, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Narrobourne; who may you be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went up to him, and revealed themselves, reminding him of the plan\r\nwhich he had himself proposed in his note, that they should meet him at\r\nIvell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jerry, I\xe2\x80\x99d forgot it!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Well, what do you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHis tone was distinctly quarrelsome.\r\n\r\nA long conversation followed, which became embittered at the first hint\r\nfrom them that he should not come to the village. The millwright drew a\r\nquart bottle from his pocket, and challenged them to drink if they\r\nmeant friendly and called themselves men. Neither of the two had\r\ntouched alcohol for years, but for once they thought it best to accept,\r\nso as not to needlessly provoke him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A drop of weak gin-and-water. It won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt ye. Drin\xe2\x80\x99 from the\r\nbottle.\xe2\x80\x99 Joshua did so, and his father pushed up the bottom of the\r\nvessel so as to make him swallow a good deal in spite of himself. It\r\nwent down into his stomach like molten lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, that\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x99 said old Halborough. \xe2\x80\x98But \xe2\x80\x99twas raw spirit\xe2\x80\x94ha,\r\nha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should you take me in so!\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua, losing his self-command,\r\ntry as he would to keep calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you took me in, my lad, in banishing me to that cursed country\r\nunder pretence that it was for my good. You were a pair of hypocrites\r\nto say so. It was done to get rid of me\xe2\x80\x94no more nor less. But, by\r\nJerry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a match for ye now! I\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil your souls for preaching. My\r\ndaughter is going to be married to the squire here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the\r\nnews\xe2\x80\x94I saw it in a paper!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is premature\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it is true; and I\xe2\x80\x99m her father, and I shall give her away, or\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a hell of a row, I can assure ye! Is that where the\r\ngennleman lives?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJoshua Halborough writhed in impotent despair. Fellmer had not yet\r\npositively declared himself, his mother was hardly won round; a scene\r\nwith their father in the parish would demolish as fair a palace of\r\nhopes as was ever builded. The millwright rose. \xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s where the\r\nsquire lives I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call. Just arrived from Canady with her\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha! I wish no harm to the gennleman, and the gennleman will\r\nwish no harm to me. But I like to take my place in the family, and\r\nstand upon my rights, and lower people\xe2\x80\x99s pride!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded already! Where\xe2\x80\x99s that woman you took with you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Woman! She was my wife as lawful as the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94a sight more\r\nlawful than your mother was till some time after you were born!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJoshua had for many years before heard whispers that his father had\r\ncajoled his mother in their early acquaintance, and had made somewhat\r\ntardy amends; but never from his father\xe2\x80\x99s lips till now. It was the\r\nlast stroke, and he could not bear it. He sank back against the hedge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is over!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98He ruins us all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe millwright moved on, waving his stick triumphantly, and the two\r\nbrothers stood still. They could see his drab figure stalking along the\r\npath, and over his head the lights from the conservatory of Narrobourne\r\nHouse, inside which Albert Fellmer might possibly be sitting with Rosa\r\nat that moment, holding her hand, and asking her to share his home with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe staggering whitey-brown form, advancing to put a blot on all this,\r\nhad been diminishing in the shade; and now suddenly disappeared beside\r\na weir. There was the noise of a flounce in the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has fallen in!\xe2\x80\x99 said Cornelius, starting forward to run for the\r\nplace at which his father had vanished.\r\n\r\nJoshua, awaking from the stupefied reverie into which he had sunk,\r\nrushed to the other\xe2\x80\x99s side before he had taken ten steps. \xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop,\r\nwhat are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered hoarsely, grasping Cornelius\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pulling him out!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes\xe2\x80\x94so am I. But\xe2\x80\x94wait a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Joshua!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her life and happiness, you know\xe2\x80\x94Cornelius\xe2\x80\x94and your reputation and\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94and our chance of rising together, all three\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe clutched his brother\xe2\x80\x99s arm to the bone; and as they stood breathless\r\nthe splashing and floundering in the weir continued; over it they saw\r\nthe hopeful lights from the manor-house conservatory winking through\r\nthe trees as their bare branches waved to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe floundering and splashing grew weaker, and they could hear gurgling\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x98Help\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m drownded! Rosie\xe2\x80\x94Rosie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll go\xe2\x80\x94we must save him. O Joshua!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes! we must!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill they did not move, but waited, holding each other, each thinking\r\nthe same thought. Weights of lead seemed to be affixed to their feet,\r\nwhich would no longer obey their wills. The mead became silent. Over it\r\nthey fancied they could see figures moving in the conservatory. The air\r\nup there seemed to emit gentle kisses.\r\n\r\nCornelius started forward at last, and Joshua almost simultaneously.\r\nTwo or three minutes brought them to the brink of the stream. At first\r\nthey could see nothing in the water, though it was not so deep nor the\r\nnight so dark but that their father\xe2\x80\x99s light kerseymere coat would have\r\nbeen visible if he had lain at the bottom. Joshua looked this way and\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has drifted into the culvert,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nBelow the foot-bridge of the weir the stream suddenly narrowed to half\r\nits width, to pass under a barrel arch or culvert constructed for\r\nwaggons to cross into the middle of the mead in haymaking time. It\r\nbeing at present the season of high water the arch was full to the\r\ncrown, against which the ripples clucked every now and then. At this\r\npoint he had just caught sight of a pale object slipping under. In a\r\nmoment it was gone.\r\n\r\nThey went to the lower end, but nothing emerged. For a long time they\r\ntried at both ends to effect some communication with the interior, but\r\nto no purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We ought to have come sooner!\xe2\x80\x99 said the conscience-stricken Cornelius,\r\nwhen they were quite exhausted, and dripping wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose we ought,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Joshua heavily. He perceived his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalking-stick on the bank; hastily picking it up he stuck it into the\r\nmud among the sedge. Then they went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we\xe2\x80\x94say anything about this accident?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Cornelius as\r\nthey approached the door of Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use? It can do no good. We must wait until he is found.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went indoors and changed their clothes; after which they started\r\nfor the manor-house, reaching it about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Besides their\r\nsister there were only three guests; an adjoining landowner and his\r\nwife, and the infirm old rector.\r\n\r\nRosa, although she had parted from them so recently, grasped their\r\nhands in an ecstatic, brimming, joyful manner, as if she had not seen\r\nthem for years. \xe2\x80\x98You look pale,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nThe brothers answered that they had had a long walk, and were somewhat\r\ntired. Everybody in the room seemed charged full with some sort of\r\ninteresting knowledge: the squire\xe2\x80\x99s neighbour and his wife looked\r\nwisely around; and Fellmer himself played the part of host with a\r\npreoccupied bearing which approached fervour. They left at eleven, not\r\naccepting the carriage offered, the distance being so short and the\r\nroads dry. The squire came rather farther into the dark with them than\r\nhe need have done, and wished Rosa good-night in a mysterious manner,\r\nslightly apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nWhen they were walking along Joshua said, with desperate attempt at\r\njoviality, \xe2\x80\x98Rosa, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 she began between a gasp and a bound. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind\xe2\x80\x94if it disturbs you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was so excited that she could not speak connectedly at first, the\r\npractised air which she had brought home with her having disappeared.\r\nCalming herself she added, \xe2\x80\x98I am not disturbed, and nothing has\r\nhappened. Only he said he wanted to ask me _something_, some day; and I\r\nsaid never mind that now. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked yet, and is coming to speak\r\nto you about it. He would have done so to-night, only I asked him not\r\nto be in a hurry. But he will come to-morrow, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIt was summer-time, six months later, and mowers and haymakers were at\r\nwork in the meads. The manor-house, being opposite them, frequently\r\nformed a peg for conversation during these operations; and the doings\r\nof the squire, and the squire\xe2\x80\x99s young wife, the curate\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\nat present the admired of most of them, and the interest of all\xe2\x80\x94met\r\nwith their due amount of criticism.\r\n\r\nRosa was happy, if ever woman could be said to be so. She had not\r\nlearnt the fate of her father, and sometimes wondered\xe2\x80\x94perhaps with a\r\nsense of relief\xe2\x80\x94why he did not write to her from his supposed home in\r\nCanada. Her brother Joshua had been presented to a living in a small\r\ntown, shortly after her marriage, and Cornelius had thereupon succeeded\r\nto the vacant curacy of Narrobourne.\r\n\r\nThese two had awaited in deep suspense the discovery of their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody; and yet the discovery had not been made. Every day they expected\r\na man or a boy to run up from the meads with the intelligence; but he\r\nhad never come. Days had accumulated to weeks and months; the wedding\r\nhad come and gone: Joshua had tolled and read himself in at his new\r\nparish; and never a shout of amazement over the millwright\xe2\x80\x99s remains.\r\n\r\nBut now, in June, when they were mowing the meads, the hatches had to\r\nbe drawn and the water let out of its channels for the convenience of\r\nthe mowers. It was thus that the discovery was made. A man, stooping\r\nlow with his scythe, caught a view of the culvert lengthwise, and saw\r\nsomething entangled in the recently bared weeds of its bed. A day or\r\ntwo after there was an inquest; but the body was unrecognizable. Fish\r\nand flood had been busy with the millwright; he had no watch or marked\r\narticle which could be identified; and a verdict of the accidental\r\ndrowning of a person unknown settled the matter.\r\n\r\nAs the body was found in Narrobourne parish, there it had to be buried.\r\nCornelius wrote to Joshua, begging him to come and read the service, or\r\nto send some one; he himself could not do it. Rather than let in a\r\nstranger Joshua came, and silently scanned the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s order handed\r\nhim by the undertaker:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, Henry Giles, Coroner for the Mid-Division of Outer Wessex, do\r\nhereby order the Burial of the Body now shown to the Inquest Jury as\r\nthe Body of an Adult Male Person Unknown . . . ,\xe2\x80\x99 etc.\r\n\r\nJoshua Halborough got through the service in some way, and rejoined his\r\nbrother Cornelius at his house. Neither accepted an invitation to lunch\r\nat their sister\xe2\x80\x99s; they wished to discuss parish matters together. In\r\nthe afternoon she came down, though they had already called on her, and\r\nhad not expected to see her again. Her bright eyes, brown hair, flowery\r\nbonnet, lemon-coloured gloves, and flush beauty, were like an\r\nirradiation into the apartment, which they in their gloom could hardly\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot to tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98of a curious thing which happened to\r\nme a month or two before my marriage\xe2\x80\x94something which I have thought may\r\nhave had a connection with the accident to the poor man you have buried\r\nto-day. It was on that evening I was at the manor-house waiting for you\r\nto fetch me; I was in the winter-garden with Albert, and we were\r\nsitting silent together, when we fancied we heard a cry. We opened the\r\ndoor, and while Albert ran to fetch his hat, leaving me standing there,\r\nthe cry was repeated, and my excited senses made me think I heard my\r\nown name. When Albert came back all was silent, and we decided that it\r\nwas only a drunken shout, and not a cry for help. We both forgot the\r\nincident, and it never has occurred to me till since the funeral to-day\r\nthat it might have been this stranger\xe2\x80\x99s cry. The name of course was\r\nonly fancy, or he might have had a wife or child with a name something\r\nlike mine, poor man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone the brothers were silent till Cornelius said, \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nmark this, Joshua. Sooner or later she\xe2\x80\x99ll know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From one of us. Do you think human hearts are iron-cased safes, that\r\nyou suppose we can keep this secret for ever?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think they are, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. It will out. We shall tell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, and ruin her\xe2\x80\x94kill her? Disgrace her children, and pull down the\r\nwhole auspicious house of Fellmer about our ears? No! May I\xe2\x80\x94drown where\r\nhe was drowned before I do it! Never, never. Surely you can say the\r\nsame, Cornelius!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCornelius seemed fortified, and no more was said. For a long time after\r\nthat day he did not see Joshua, and before the next year was out a son\r\nand heir was born to the Fellmers. The villagers rang the three bells\r\nevery evening for a week and more, and were made merry by Mr. Fellmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nale; and when the christening came on Joshua paid Narrobourne another\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nAmong all the people who assembled on that day the brother clergymen\r\nwere the least interested. Their minds were haunted by a spirit in\r\nkerseymere in the evening they walked together in the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua. \xe2\x80\x98But here are you doing journey-work,\r\nCornelius, and likely to continue at it till the end of the day, as far\r\nas I can see. I, too, with my petty living\xe2\x80\x94what am I after all? . . .\r\nTo tell the truth, the Church is a poor forlorn hope for people without\r\ninfluence, particularly when their enthusiasm begins to flag. A social\r\nregenerator has a better chance outside, where he is unhampered by\r\ndogma and tradition. As for me, I would rather have gone on mending\r\nmills, with my crust of bread and liberty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlmost automatically they had bent their steps along the margin of the\r\nriver; they now paused. They were standing on the brink of the\r\nwell-known weir. There were the hatches, there was the culvert; they\r\ncould see the pebbly bed of the stream through the pellucid water. The\r\nnotes of the church-bells were audible, still jangled by the\r\nenthusiastic villagers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why see\xe2\x80\x94it was there I hid his walking-stick!\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua, looking\r\ntowards the sedge. The next moment, during a passing breeze, something\r\nflashed white on the spot to which the attention of Cornelius was\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nFrom the sedge rose a straight little silver-poplar, and it was the\r\nleaves of this sapling which caused the flicker of whiteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His walking-stick has grown!\xe2\x80\x99 Joshua added. \xe2\x80\x98It was a rough one\xe2\x80\x94cut\r\nfrom the hedge, I remember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt every puff of wind the tree turned white, till they could not bear\r\nto look at it; and they walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see him every night,\xe2\x80\x99 Cornelius murmured . . . \xe2\x80\x98Ah, we read our\r\n_Hebrews_ to little account, Jos! \xce\xa5\xcf\x80\xce\xad\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xb5 \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xcf\x85\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd, \xce\xb1\xce\xb9\xcf\x83\xcf\x87\xcf\x85\xce\xbd\xce\xb7\xcf\x82\r\n\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xcf\x86\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xb7\xcf\x83\xce\xb1\xcf\x82. To have endured the cross, despising the shame\xe2\x80\x94there lay\r\ngreatness! But now I often feel that I should like to put an end to\r\ntrouble here in this self-same spot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have thought of it myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joshua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we shall, some day,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured his brother. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nJoshua moodily.\r\n\r\nWith that contingency to consider in the silence of their nights and\r\ndays they bent their steps homewards.\r\n\r\n_December_ 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WESTERN CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe man who played the disturbing part in the two quiet lives hereafter\r\ndepicted\xe2\x80\x94no great man, in any sense, by the way\xe2\x80\x94first had knowledge of\r\nthem on an October evening, in the city of Melchester. He had been\r\nstanding in the Close, vainly endeavouring to gain amid the darkness a\r\nglimpse of the most homogeneous pile of medi\xc3\xa6val architecture in\r\nEngland, which towered and tapered from the damp and level sward in\r\nfront of him. While he stood the presence of the Cathedral walls was\r\nrevealed rather by the ear than by the eyes; he could not see them, but\r\nthey reflected sharply a roar of sound which entered the Close by a\r\nstreet leading from the city square, and, falling upon the building,\r\nwas flung back upon him.\r\n\r\nHe postponed till the morrow his attempt to examine the deserted\r\nedifice, and turned his attention to the noise. It was compounded of\r\nsteam barrel-organs, the clanging of gongs, the ringing of hand-bells,\r\nthe clack of rattles, and the undistinguishable shouts of men. A lurid\r\nlight hung in the air in the direction of the tumult. Thitherward he\r\nwent, passing under the arched gateway, along a straight street, and\r\ninto the square.\r\n\r\nHe might have searched Europe over for a greater contrast between\r\njuxtaposed scenes. The spectacle was that of the eighth chasm of the\r\nInferno as to colour and flame, and, as to mirth, a development of the\r\nHomeric heaven. A smoky glare, of the complexion of brass-filings,\r\nascended from the fiery tongues of innumerable naphtha lamps affixed to\r\nbooths, stalls, and other temporary erections which crowded the\r\nspacious market-square. In front of this irradiation scores of human\r\nfigures, more or less in profile, were darting athwart and across, up,\r\ndown, and around, like gnats against a sunset.\r\n\r\nTheir motions were so rhythmical that they seemed to be moved by\r\nmachinery. And it presently appeared that they were moved by machinery\r\nindeed; the figures being those of the patrons of swings, see-saws,\r\nflying-leaps, above all of the three steam roundabouts which occupied\r\nthe centre of the position. It was from the latter that the din of\r\nsteam-organs came.\r\n\r\nThrobbing humanity in full light was, on second thoughts, better than\r\narchitecture in the dark. The young man, lighting a short pipe, and\r\nputting his hat on one side and one hand in his pocket, to throw\r\nhimself into harmony with his new environment, drew near to the largest\r\nand most patronized of the steam circuses, as the roundabouts were\r\ncalled by their owners. This was one of brilliant finish, and it was\r\nnow in full revolution. The musical instrument around which and to\r\nwhose tones the riders revolved, directed its trumpet-mouths of brass\r\nupon the young man, and the long plate-glass mirrors set at angles,\r\nwhich revolved with the machine, flashed the gyrating personages and\r\nhobby horses kaleidoscopically into his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt could now be seen that he was unlike the majority of the crowd. A\r\ngentlemanly young fellow, one of the species found in large towns only,\r\nand London particularly, built on delicate lines, well, though not\r\nfashionably dressed, he appeared to belong to the professional class;\r\nhe had nothing square or practical about his look, much that was\r\ncurvilinear and sensuous. Indeed, some would have called him a man not\r\naltogether typical of the middle-class male of a century wherein sordid\r\nambition is the master-passion that seems to be taking the\r\ntime-honoured place of love.\r\n\r\nThe revolving figures passed before his eyes with an unexpected and\r\nquiet grace in a throng whose natural movements did not suggest\r\ngracefulness or quietude as a rule. By some contrivance there was\r\nimparted to each of the hobby-horses a motion which was really the\r\ntriumph and perfection of roundabout inventiveness\xe2\x80\x94a galloping rise and\r\nfall, so timed that, of each pair of steeds, one was on the spring\r\nwhile the other was on the pitch. The riders were quite fascinated by\r\nthese equine undulations in this most delightful holiday-game of our\r\ntimes. There were riders as young as six, and as old as sixty years,\r\nwith every age between. At first it was difficult to catch a\r\npersonality, but by and by the observer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes centred on the prettiest\r\ngirl out of the several pretty ones revolving.\r\n\r\nIt was not that one with the light frock and light hat whom he had been\r\nat first attracted by; no, it was the one with the black cape, grey\r\nskirt, light gloves and\xe2\x80\x94no, not even she, but the one behind her; she\r\nwith the crimson skirt, dark jacket, brown hat and brown gloves.\r\nUnmistakably that was the prettiest girl.\r\n\r\nHaving finally selected her, this idle spectator studied her as well as\r\nhe was able during each of her brief transits across his visual field.\r\nShe was absolutely unconscious of everything save the act of riding:\r\nher features were rapt in an ecstatic dreaminess; for the moment she\r\ndid not know her age or her history or her lineaments, much less her\r\ntroubles. He himself was full of vague latter-day glooms and popular\r\nmelancholies, and it was a refreshing sensation to behold this young\r\nthing then and there, absolutely as happy as if she were in a Paradise.\r\n\r\nDreading the moment when the inexorable stoker, grimily lurking behind\r\nthe glittering rococo-work, should decide that this set of riders had\r\nhad their pennyworth, and bring the whole concern of steam-engine,\r\nhorses, mirrors, trumpets, drums, cymbals, and such-like to pause and\r\nsilence, he waited for her every reappearance, glancing indifferently\r\nover the intervening forms, including the two plainer girls, the old\r\nwoman and child, the two youngsters, the newly-married couple, the old\r\nman with a clay pipe, the sparkish youth with a ring, the young ladies\r\nin the chariot, the pair of journeyman-carpenters, and others, till his\r\nselect country beauty followed on again in her place. He had never seen\r\na fairer product of nature, and at each round she made a deeper mark in\r\nhis sentiments. The stoppage then came, and the sighs of the riders\r\nwere audible.\r\n\r\nHe moved round to the place at which he reckoned she would alight; but\r\nshe retained her seat. The empty saddles began to refill, and she\r\nplainly was deciding to have another turn. The young man drew up to the\r\nside of her steed, and pleasantly asked her if she had enjoyed her\r\nride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with dancing eyes. \xe2\x80\x98It has been quite unlike\r\nanything I have ever felt in my life before!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to fall into conversation with her. Unreserved\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nunreserved\xe2\x80\x94by nature, she was not experienced enough to be reserved by\r\nart, and after a little coaxing she answered his remarks readily. She\r\nhad come to live in Melchester from a village on the Great Plain, and\r\nthis was the first time that she had ever seen a steam-circus; she\r\ncould not understand how such wonderful machines were made. She had\r\ncome to the city on the invitation of Mrs. Harnham, who had taken her\r\ninto her household to train her as a servant, if she showed any\r\naptitude. Mrs. Harnham was a young lady who before she married had been\r\nMiss Edith White, living in the country near the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s cottage; she\r\nwas now very kind to her through knowing her in childhood so well. She\r\nwas even taking the trouble to educate her. Mrs. Harnham was the only\r\nfriend she had in the world, and being without children had wished to\r\nhave her near her in preference to anybody else, though she had only\r\nlately come; allowed her to do almost as she liked, and to have a\r\nholiday whenever she asked for it. The husband of this kind young lady\r\nwas a rich wine-merchant of the town, but Mrs. Harnham did not care\r\nmuch about him. In the daytime you could see the house from where they\r\nwere talking. She, the speaker, liked Melchester better than the lonely\r\ncountry, and she was going to have a new hat for next Sunday that was\r\nto cost fifteen and ninepence.\r\n\r\nThen she inquired of her acquaintance where he lived, and he told her\r\nin London, that ancient and smoky city, where everybody lived who lived\r\nat all, and died because they could not live there. He came into Wessex\r\ntwo or three times a year for professional reasons; he had arrived from\r\nWintoncester yesterday, and was going on into the next county in a day\r\nor two. For one thing he did like the country better than the town, and\r\nit was because it contained such girls as herself.\r\n\r\nThen the pleasure-machine started again, and, to the light-hearted\r\ngirl, the figure of the handsome young man, the market-square with its\r\nlights and crowd, the houses beyond, and the world at large, began\r\nmoving round as before, countermoving in the revolving mirrors on her\r\nright hand, she being as it were the fixed point in an undulating,\r\ndazzling, lurid universe, in which loomed forward most prominently of\r\nall the form of her late interlocutor. Each time that she approached\r\nthe half of her orbit that lay nearest him they gazed at each other\r\nwith smiles, and with that unmistakable expression which means so\r\nlittle at the moment, yet so often leads up to passion, heart-ache,\r\nunion, disunion, devotion, overpopulation, drudgery, content,\r\nresignation, despair.\r\n\r\nWhen the horses slowed anew he stepped to her side and proposed another\r\nheat. \xe2\x80\x98Hang the expense for once,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed till the tears came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you laugh, dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because\xe2\x80\x94you are so genteel that you must have plenty of money, and\r\nonly say that for fun!\xe2\x80\x99 she returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed the young man in unison, and gallantly producing his\r\nmoney she was enabled to whirl on again.\r\n\r\nAs he stood smiling there in the motley crowd, with his pipe in his\r\nhand, and clad in the rough pea-jacket and wideawake that he had put on\r\nfor his stroll, who would have supposed him to be Charles Bradford\r\nRaye, Esquire, stuff-gownsman, educated at Wintoncester, called to the\r\nBar at Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s-Inn, now going the Western Circuit, merely detained in\r\nMelchester by a small arbitration after his brethren had moved on to\r\nthe next county-town?\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe square was overlooked from its remoter corner by the house of which\r\nthe young girl had spoken, a dignified residence of considerable size,\r\nhaving several windows on each floor. Inside one of these, on the first\r\nfloor, the apartment being a large drawing-room, sat a lady, in\r\nappearance from twenty-eight to thirty years of age. The blinds were\r\nstill undrawn, and the lady was absently surveying the weird scene\r\nwithout, her cheek resting on her hand. The room was unlit from within,\r\nbut enough of the glare from the market-place entered it to reveal the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s face. She was what is called an interesting creature rather than\r\na handsome woman; dark-eyed, thoughtful, and with sensitive lips.\r\n\r\nA man sauntered into the room from behind and came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Edith, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Why are you sitting here in the\r\ndark?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am looking at the fair,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the lady in a languid voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh? Horrid nuisance every year! I wish it could be put a stop to\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m. There\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for taste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor a moment he gazed from the window with her, for politeness sake,\r\nand then went out again.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Anna come in?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Harnham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She ought to be in by this time. I meant her to go for ten minutes\r\nonly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I go and look for her, m\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x99 said the house-maid alertly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. It is not necessary: she is a good girl and will come soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, when the servant had gone Mrs. Harnham arose, went up to her\r\nroom, cloaked and bonneted herself, and proceeded downstairs, where she\r\nfound her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to see the fair,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98and I am going to look for Anna. I\r\nhave made myself responsible for her, and must see she comes to no\r\nharm. She ought to be indoors. Will you come with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I saw her on one of those whirligig things,\r\ntalking to her young man as I came in. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you wish, though\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather go a hundred miles the other way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then please do so. I shall come to no harm alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe left the house and entered the crowd which thronged the\r\nmarket-place, where she soon discovered Anna, seated on the revolving\r\nhorse. As soon as it stopped Mrs. Harnham advanced and said severely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anna, how can you be such a wild girl? You were only to be out for ten\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna looked blank, and the young man, who had dropped into the\r\nbackground, came to her assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her,\xe2\x80\x99 he said politely. \xe2\x80\x98It is my fault that she\r\nhas stayed. She looked so graceful on the horse that I induced her to\r\ngo round again. I assure you that she has been quite safe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave her in your hands,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Harnham, turning\r\nto retrace her steps.\r\n\r\nBut this for the moment it was not so easy to do. Something had\r\nattracted the crowd to a spot in their rear, and the wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, caught by its sway, found herself pressed against Anna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance without power to move away. Their faces were within a few\r\ninches of each other, his breath fanned her cheek as well as Anna\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThey could do no other than smile at the accident; but neither spoke,\r\nand each waited passively. Mrs. Harnham then felt a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand clasping\r\nher fingers, and from the look of consciousness on the young fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface she knew the hand to be his: she also knew that from the position\r\nof the girl he had no other thought than that the imprisoned hand was\r\nAnna\xe2\x80\x99s. What prompted her to refrain from undeceiving him she could\r\nhardly tell. Not content with holding the hand, he playfully slipped\r\ntwo of his fingers inside her glove, against her palm. Thus matters\r\ncontinued till the pressure lessened; but several minutes passed before\r\nthe crowd thinned sufficiently to allow Mrs. Harnham to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did they get to know each other, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x99 she mused as she\r\nretreated. \xe2\x80\x98Anna is really very forward\xe2\x80\x94and he very wicked and nice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was so gently stirred with the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s manner and voice, with\r\nthe tenderness of his idle touch, that instead of re-entering the house\r\nshe turned back again and observed the pair from a screened nook.\r\nReally she argued (being little less impulsive than Anna herself) it\r\nwas very excusable in Anna to encourage him, however she might have\r\ncontrived to make his acquaintance; he was so gentlemanly, so\r\nfascinating, had such beautiful eyes. The thought that he was several\r\nyears her junior produced a reasonless sigh.\r\n\r\nAt length the couple turned from the roundabout towards the door of\r\nMrs. Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the young man could be heard saying that he\r\nwould accompany her home. Anna, then, had found a lover, apparently a\r\nvery devoted one. Mrs. Harnham was quite interested in him. When they\r\ndrew near the door of the wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house, a comparatively\r\ndeserted spot by this time, they stood invisible for a little while in\r\nthe shadow of a wall, where they separated, Anna going on to the\r\nentrance, and her acquaintance returning across the square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anna,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Harnham, coming up. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at you! That\r\nyoung man kissed you at parting I am almost sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 stammered Anna; \xe2\x80\x98he said, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94it would do me no\r\nharm, and, and, him a great deal of good!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I thought so! And he was a stranger till to-night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet I warrant you told him your name and every thing about yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He asked me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you his?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes ma\xe2\x80\x99am, he did!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Anna victoriously. \xe2\x80\x98It is Charles Bradford,\r\nof London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if he\xe2\x80\x99s respectable, of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to say against your\r\nknowing him,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked her mistress, prepossessed, in spite of general\r\nprinciples, in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s favour. \xe2\x80\x98But I must reconsider all that,\r\nif he attempts to renew your acquaintance. A country-bred girl like\r\nyou, who has never lived in Melchester till this month, who had hardly\r\never seen a black-coated man till you came here, to be so sharp as to\r\ncapture a young Londoner like him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t capture him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna, in confusion.\r\n\r\nWhen she was indoors and alone Mrs. Harnham thought what a well-bred\r\nand chivalrous young man Anna\xe2\x80\x99s companion had seemed. There had been a\r\nmagic in his wooing touch of her hand; and she wondered how he had come\r\nto be attracted by the girl.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the emotional Edith Harnham went to the usual week-day\r\nservice in Melchester cathedral. In crossing the Close through the fog\r\nshe again perceived him who had interested her the previous evening,\r\ngazing up thoughtfully at the high-piled architecture of the nave: and\r\nas soon as she had taken her seat he entered and sat down in a stall\r\nopposite hers.\r\n\r\nHe did not particularly heed her; but Mrs. Harnham was continually\r\noccupying her eyes with him, and wondered more than ever what had\r\nattracted him in her unfledged maid-servant. The mistress was almost as\r\nunaccustomed as the maiden herself to the end-of-the-age young man, or\r\nshe might have wondered less. Raye, having looked about him awhile,\r\nleft abruptly, without regard to the service that was proceeding; and\r\nMrs. Harnham\xe2\x80\x94lonely, impressionable creature that she was\xe2\x80\x94took no\r\nfurther interest in praising the Lord. She wished she had married a\r\nLondon man who knew the subtleties of love-making as they were\r\nevidently known to him who had mistakenly caressed her hand.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe calendar at Melchester had been light, occupying the court only a\r\nfew hours; and the assizes at Casterbridge, the next county-town on the\r\nWestern Circuit, having no business for Raye, he had not gone thither.\r\nAt the next town after that they did not open till the following\r\nMonday, trials to begin on Tuesday morning. In the natural order of\r\nthings Raye would have arrived at the latter place on Monday afternoon;\r\nbut it was not till the middle of Wednesday that his gown and grey wig,\r\ncurled in tiers, in the best fashion of Assyrian bas-reliefs, were seen\r\nblowing and bobbing behind him as he hastily walked up the High Street\r\nfrom his lodgings. But though he entered the assize building there was\r\nnothing for him to do, and sitting at the blue baize table in the well\r\nof the court, he mended pens with a mind far away from the case in\r\nprogress. Thoughts of unpremeditated conduct, of which a week earlier\r\nhe would not have believed himself capable, threw him into a mood of\r\ndissatisfied depression.\r\n\r\nHe had contrived to see again the pretty rural maiden Anna, the day\r\nafter the fair, had walked out of the city with her to the earthworks\r\nof Old Melchester, and feeling a violent fancy for her, had remained in\r\nMelchester all Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday; by persuasion obtaining\r\nwalks and meetings with the girl six or seven times during the\r\ninterval; had in brief won her, body and soul.\r\n\r\nHe supposed it must have been owing to the seclusion in which he had\r\nlived of late in town that he had given way so unrestrainedly to a\r\npassion for an artless creature whose inexperience had, from the first,\r\nled her to place herself unreservedly in his hands. Much he deplored\r\ntrifling with her feelings for the sake of a passing desire; and he\r\ncould only hope that she might not live to suffer on his account.\r\n\r\nShe had begged him to come to her again; entreated him; wept. He had\r\npromised that he would do so, and he meant to carry out that promise.\r\nHe could not desert her now. Awkward as such unintentional connections\r\nwere, the interspace of a hundred miles\xe2\x80\x94which to a girl of her limited\r\ncapabilities was like a thousand\xe2\x80\x94would effectually hinder this summer\r\nfancy from greatly encumbering his life; while thought of her simple\r\nlove might do him the negative good of keeping him from idle pleasures\r\nin town when he wished to work hard. His circuit journeys would take\r\nhim to Melchester three or four times a year; and then he could always\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\nThe pseudonym, or rather partial name, that he had given her as his\r\nbefore knowing how far the acquaintance was going to carry him, had\r\nbeen spoken on the spur of the moment, without any ulterior intention\r\nwhatever. He had not afterwards disturbed Anna\xe2\x80\x99s error, but on leaving\r\nher he had felt bound to give her an address at a stationer\xe2\x80\x99s not far\r\nfrom his chambers, at which she might write to him under the initials\r\n\xe2\x80\x98C. B.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn due time Raye returned to his London abode, having called at\r\nMelchester on his way and spent a few additional hours with his\r\nfascinating child of nature. In town he lived monotonously every day.\r\nOften he and his rooms were enclosed by a tawny fog from all the world\r\nbesides, and when he lighted the gas to read or write by, his situation\r\nseemed so unnatural that he would look into the fire and think of that\r\ntrusting girl at Melchester again and again. Often, oppressed by absurd\r\nfondness for her, he would enter the dim religious nave of the Law\r\nCourts by the north door, elbow other juniors habited like himself, and\r\nlike him unretained; edge himself into this or that crowded court where\r\na sensational case was going on, just as if he were in it, though the\r\npolice officers at the door knew as well as he knew himself that he had\r\nno more concern with the business in hand than the patient idlers at\r\nthe gallery-door outside, who had waited to enter since eight in the\r\nmorning because, like him, they belonged to the classes that live on\r\nexpectation. But he would do these things to no purpose, and think how\r\ngreatly the characters in such scenes contrasted with the pink and\r\nbreezy Anna.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected feature in that peasant maiden\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was that she had\r\nnot as yet written to him, though he had told her she might do so if\r\nshe wished. Surely a young creature had never before been so reticent\r\nin such circumstances. At length he sent her a brief line, positively\r\nrequesting her to write. There was no answer by the return post, but\r\nthe day after a letter in a neat feminine hand, and bearing the\r\nMelchester post-mark, was handed to him by the stationer.\r\n\r\nThe fact alone of its arrival was sufficient to satisfy his imaginative\r\nsentiment. He was not anxious to open the epistle, and in truth did not\r\nbegin to read it for nearly half-an-hour, anticipating readily its\r\nterms of passionate retrospect and tender adjuration. When at last he\r\nturned his feet to the fireplace and unfolded the sheet, he was\r\nsurprised and pleased to find that neither extravagance nor vulgarity\r\nwas there. It was the most charming little missive he had ever received\r\nfrom woman. To be sure the language was simple and the ideas were\r\nslight; but it was so self-possessed; so purely that of a young girl\r\nwho felt her womanhood to be enough for her dignity that he read it\r\nthrough twice. Four sides were filled, and a few lines written across,\r\nafter the fashion of former days; the paper, too, was common, and not\r\nof the latest shade and surface. But what of those things? He had\r\nreceived letters from women who were fairly called ladies, but never so\r\nsensible, so human a letter as this. He could not single out any one\r\nsentence and say it was at all remarkable or clever; the _ensemble_ of\r\nthe letter it was which won him; and beyond the one request that he\r\nwould write or come to her again soon there was nothing to show her\r\nsense of a claim upon him.\r\n\r\nTo write again and develop a correspondence was the last thing Raye\r\nwould have preconceived as his conduct in such a situation; yet he did\r\nsend a short, encouraging line or two, signed with his pseudonym, in\r\nwhich he asked for another letter, and cheeringly promised that he\r\nwould try to see her again on some near day, and would never forget how\r\nmuch they had been to each other during their short acquaintance.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTo return now to the moment at which Anna, at Melchester, had received\r\nRaye\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nIt had been put into her own hand by the postman on his morning rounds.\r\nShe flushed down to her neck on receipt of it, and turned it over and\r\nover. \xe2\x80\x98It is mine?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see it is?\xe2\x80\x99 said the postman, smiling as he\r\nguessed the nature of the document and the cause of the confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, of course!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Anna, looking at the letter, forcedly\r\ntittering, and blushing still more.\r\n\r\nHer look of embarrassment did not leave her with the postman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture. She opened the envelope, kissed its contents, put away the\r\nletter in her pocket, and remained musing till her eyes filled with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later she carried up a cup of tea to Mrs. Harnham in her\r\nbed-chamber. Anna\xe2\x80\x99s mistress looked at her, and said: \xe2\x80\x98How dismal you\r\nseem this morning, Anna. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not dismal, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad; only I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 She stopped to stifle a sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a letter\xe2\x80\x94and what good is it to me, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t read a word in\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it, child, if necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this is from somebody\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody to read it but myself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnna murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall not tell anybody. Is it from that young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so.\xe2\x80\x99 Anna slowly produced the letter, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Then will you\r\nread it to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was the secret of Anna\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment and flutterings. She could\r\nneither read nor write. She had grown up under the care of an aunt by\r\nmarriage, at one of the lonely hamlets on the Great Mid-Wessex Plain\r\nwhere, even in days of national education, there had been no school\r\nwithin a distance of two miles. Her aunt was an ignorant woman; there\r\nhad been nobody to investigate Anna\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, nobody to care\r\nabout her learning the rudiments; though, as often in such cases, she\r\nhad been well fed and clothed and not unkindly treated. Since she had\r\ncome to live at Melchester with Mrs. Harnham, the latter, who took a\r\nkindly interest in the girl, had taught her to speak correctly, in\r\nwhich accomplishment Anna showed considerable readiness, as is not\r\nunusual with the illiterate; and soon became quite fluent in the use of\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99s phraseology. Mrs. Harnham also insisted upon her getting\r\na spelling and copy book, and beginning to practise in these. Anna was\r\nslower in this branch of her education, and meanwhile here was the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nEdith Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s large dark eyes expressed some interest in the\r\ncontents, though, in her character of mere interpreter, she threw into\r\nher tone as much as she could of mechanical passiveness. She read the\r\nshort epistle on to its concluding sentence, which idly requested Anna\r\nto send him a tender answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear mistress?\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna eagerly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it as well as ever you can, please? Because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear him to think I am not able to do it myself. I should sink into the\r\nearth with shame if he knew that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom some words in the letter Mrs. Harnham was led to ask questions,\r\nand the answers she received confirmed her suspicions. Deep concern\r\nfilled Edith\xe2\x80\x99s heart at perceiving how the girl had committed her\r\nhappiness to the issue of this new-sprung attachment. She blamed\r\nherself for not interfering in a flirtation which had resulted so\r\nseriously for the poor little creature in her charge; though at the\r\ntime of seeing the pair together she had a feeling that it was hardly\r\nwithin her province to nip young affection in the bud. However, what\r\nwas done could not be undone, and it behoved her now, as Anna\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nprotector, to help her as much as she could. To Anna\xe2\x80\x99s eager request\r\nthat she, Mrs. Harnham, should compose and write the answer to this\r\nyoung London man\xe2\x80\x99s letter, she felt bound to accede, to keep alive his\r\nattachment to the girl if possible; though in other circumstances she\r\nmight have suggested the cook as an amanuensis.\r\n\r\nA tender reply was thereupon concocted, and set down in Edith Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. This letter it had been which Raye had received and delighted in.\r\nWritten in the presence of Anna it certainly was, and on Anna\xe2\x80\x99s humble\r\nnote-paper, and in a measure indited by the young girl; but the life,\r\nthe spirit, the individuality, were Edith Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you at least put your name yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98You can manage\r\nto write that by this time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna, shrinking back. \xe2\x80\x98I should do it so bad. He\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nashamed of me, and never see me again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe note, so prettily requesting another from him, had, as we have\r\nseen, power enough in its pages to bring one. He declared it to be such\r\na pleasure to hear from her that she must write every week. The same\r\nprocess of manufacture was accordingly repeated by Anna and her\r\nmistress, and continued for several weeks in succession; each letter\r\nbeing penned and suggested by Edith, the girl standing by; the answer\r\nread and commented on by Edith, Anna standing by and listening again.\r\n\r\nLate on a winter evening, after the dispatch of the sixth letter, Mrs.\r\nHarnham was sitting alone by the remains of her fire. Her husband had\r\nretired to bed, and she had fallen into that fixity of musing which\r\ntakes no count of hour or temperature. The state of mind had been\r\nbrought about in Edith by a strange thing which she had done that day.\r\nFor the first time since Raye\xe2\x80\x99s visit Anna had gone to stay over a\r\nnight or two with her cottage friends on the Plain, and in her absence\r\nhad arrived, out of its time, a letter from Raye. To this Edith had\r\nreplied on her own responsibility, from the depths of her own heart,\r\nwithout waiting for her maid\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration. The luxury of writing to\r\nhim what would be known to no consciousness but his was great, and she\r\nhad indulged herself therein.\r\n\r\nWhy was it a luxury?\r\n\r\nEdith Harnham led a lonely life. Influenced by the belief of the\r\nBritish parent that a bad marriage with its aversions is better than\r\nfree womanhood with its interests, dignity, and leisure, she had\r\nconsented to marry the elderly wine-merchant as a _pis aller_, at the\r\nage of seven-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94some three years before this date\xe2\x80\x94to find\r\nafterwards that she had made a mistake. That contract had left her\r\nstill a woman whose deeper nature had never been stirred.\r\n\r\nShe was now clearly realizing that she had become possessed to the\r\nbottom of her soul with the image of a man to whom she was hardly so\r\nmuch as a name. From the first he had attracted her by his looks and\r\nvoice; by his tender touch; and, with these as generators, the writing\r\nof letter after letter and the reading of their soft answers had\r\ninsensibly developed on her side an emotion which fanned his; till\r\nthere had resulted a magnetic reciprocity between the correspondents,\r\nnotwithstanding that one of them wrote in a character not her own. That\r\nhe had been able to seduce another woman in two days was his crowning\r\nthough unrecognized fascination for her as the she-animal.\r\n\r\nThey were her own impassioned and pent-up ideas\xe2\x80\x94lowered to monosyllabic\r\nphraseology in order to keep up the disguise\xe2\x80\x94that Edith put into\r\nletters signed with another name, much to the shallow Anna\xe2\x80\x99s delight,\r\nwho, unassisted, could not for the world have conceived such pretty\r\nfancies for winning him, even had she been able to write them. Edith\r\nfound that it was these, her own foisted-in sentiments, to which the\r\nyoung barrister mainly responded. The few sentences occasionally added\r\nfrom Anna\xe2\x80\x99s own lips made apparently no impression upon him.\r\n\r\nThe letter-writing in her absence Anna never discovered; but on her\r\nreturn the next morning she declared she wished to see her lover about\r\nsomething at once, and begged Mrs. Harnham to ask him to come.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange anxiety in her manner which did not escape Mrs.\r\nHarnham, and ultimately resolved itself into a flood of tears. Sinking\r\ndown at Edith\xe2\x80\x99s knees, she made confession that the result of her\r\nrelations with her lover it would soon become necessary to disclose.\r\n\r\nEdith Harnham was generous enough to be very far from inclined to cast\r\nAnna adrift at this conjuncture. No true woman ever is so inclined from\r\nher own personal point of view, however prompt she may be in taking\r\nsuch steps to safeguard those dear to her. Although she had written to\r\nRaye so short a time previously, she instantly penned another Anna-note\r\nhinting clearly though delicately the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nRaye replied by a hasty line to say how much he was affected by her\r\nnews: he felt that he must run down to see her almost immediately.\r\n\r\nBut a week later the girl came to her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s room with another\r\nnote, which on being read informed her that after all he could not find\r\ntime for the journey. Anna was broken with grief; but by Mrs. Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsel strictly refrained from hurling at him the reproaches and\r\nbitterness customary from young women so situated. One thing was\r\nimperative: to keep the young man\xe2\x80\x99s romantic interest in her alive.\r\nRather therefore did Edith, in the name of her _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e_, request him\r\non no account to be distressed about the looming event, and not to\r\ninconvenience himself to hasten down. She desired above everything to\r\nbe no weight upon him in his career, no clog upon his high activities.\r\nShe had wished him to know what had befallen: he was to dismiss it\r\nagain from his mind. Only he must write tenderly as ever, and when he\r\nshould come again on the spring circuit it would be soon enough to\r\ndiscuss what had better be done.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that Anna\xe2\x80\x99s own feelings had not been quite in\r\naccord with these generous expressions; but the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s judgment had\r\nruled, and Anna had acquiesced. \xe2\x80\x98All I want is that _niceness_ you can\r\nso well put into your letters, my dear, dear mistress, and that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor the life o\xe2\x80\x99 me make up out of my own head; though I mean the same\r\nthing and feel it exactly when you\xe2\x80\x99ve written it down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the letter had been sent off, and Edith Harnham was left alone,\r\nshe bowed herself on the back of her chair and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it was mine\xe2\x80\x94I wish it was!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Yet how can I say\r\nsuch a wicked thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe letter moved Raye considerably when it reached him. The\r\nintelligence itself had affected him less than her unexpected manner of\r\ntreating him in relation to it. The absence of any word of reproach,\r\nthe devotion to his interests, the self-sacrifice apparent in every\r\nline, all made up a nobility of character that he had never dreamt of\r\nfinding in womankind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God forgive me!\xe2\x80\x99 he said tremulously. \xe2\x80\x98I have been a wicked wretch. I\r\ndid not know she was such a treasure as this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe reassured her instantly; declaring that he would not of course\r\ndesert her, that he would provide a home for her somewhere. Meanwhile\r\nshe was to stay where she was as long as her mistress would allow her.\r\n\r\nBut a misfortune supervened in this direction. Whether an inkling of\r\nAnna\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances reached the knowledge of Mrs. Harnham\xe2\x80\x99s husband or\r\nnot cannot be said, but the girl was compelled, in spite of Edith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentreaties, to leave the house. By her own choice she decided to go\r\nback for a while to the cottage on the Plain. This arrangement led to a\r\nconsultation as to how the correspondence should be carried on; and in\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s inability to continue personally what had been begun in her\r\nname, and in the difficulty of their acting in concert as heretofore,\r\nshe requested Mrs. Harnham\xe2\x80\x94the only well-to-do friend she had in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94to receive the letters and reply to them off-hand, sending them\r\non afterwards to herself on the Plain, where she might at least get\r\nsome neighbour to read them to her, if a trustworthy one could be met\r\nwith. Anna and her box then departed for the Plain.\r\n\r\nThus it befel that Edith Harnham found herself in the strange position\r\nof having to correspond, under no supervision by the real woman, with a\r\nman not her husband, in terms which were virtually those of a wife,\r\nconcerning a condition that was not Edith\xe2\x80\x99s at all; the man being one\r\nfor whom, mainly through the sympathies involved in playing this part,\r\nshe secretly cherished a predilection, subtle and imaginative truly,\r\nbut strong and absorbing. She opened each letter, read it as if\r\nintended for herself, and replied from the promptings of her own heart\r\nand no other.\r\n\r\nThroughout this correspondence, carried on in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the\r\nhigh-strung Edith Harnham lived in the ecstasy of fancy; the vicarious\r\nintimacy engendered such a flow of passionateness as was never\r\nexceeded. For conscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake Edith at first sent on each of his\r\nletters to Anna, and even rough copies of her replies; but later on\r\nthese so-called copies were much abridged, and many letters on both\r\nsides were not sent on at all.\r\n\r\nThough selfish, and, superficially at least, infested with the\r\nself-indulgent vices of artificial society, there was a substratum of\r\nhonesty and fairness in Raye\xe2\x80\x99s character. He had really a tender regard\r\nfor the country girl, and it grew more tender than ever when he found\r\nher apparently capable of expressing the deepest sensibilities in the\r\nsimplest words. He meditated, he wavered; and finally resolved to\r\nconsult his sister, a maiden lady much older than himself, of lively\r\nsympathies and good intent. In making this confidence he showed her\r\nsome of the letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She seems fairly educated,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Raye observed. \xe2\x80\x98And bright in ideas.\r\nShe expresses herself with a taste that must be innate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. She writes very prettily, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she, thanks to these elementary\r\nschools?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One is drawn out towards her, in spite of one\xe2\x80\x99s self, poor thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the discussion was that though he had not been directly\r\nadvised to do it, Raye wrote, in his real name, what he would never\r\nhave decided to write on his own responsibility; namely that he could\r\nnot live without her, and would come down in the spring and shelve her\r\nlooming difficulty by marrying her.\r\n\r\nThis bold acceptance of the situation was made known to Anna by Mrs.\r\nHarnham driving out immediately to the cottage on the Plain. Anna\r\njumped for joy like a little child. And poor, crude directions for\r\nanswering appropriately were given to Edith Harnham, who on her return\r\nto the city carried them out with warm intensification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O!\xe2\x80\x99 she groaned, as she threw down the pen. \xe2\x80\x98Anna\xe2\x80\x94poor good little\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t intelligence enough to appreciate him! How should she?\r\nWhile I\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t bear his child!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was now February. The correspondence had continued altogether for\r\nfour months; and the next letter from Raye contained incidentally a\r\nstatement of his position and prospects. He said that in offering to\r\nwed her he had, at first, contemplated the step of retiring from a\r\nprofession which hitherto had brought him very slight emolument, and\r\nwhich, to speak plainly, he had thought might be difficult of practice\r\nafter his union with her. But the unexpected mines of brightness and\r\nwarmth that her letters had disclosed to be lurking in her sweet nature\r\nhad led him to abandon that somewhat sad prospect. He felt sure that,\r\nwith her powers of development, after a little private training in the\r\nsocial forms of London under his supervision, and a little help from a\r\ngoverness if necessary, she would make as good a professional man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife as could be desired, even if he should rise to the woolsack. Many\r\na Lord Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been less intuitively a lady than she had\r\nshown herself to be in her lines to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x94poor fellow, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 mourned Edith Harnham.\r\n\r\nHer distress now raged as high as her infatuation. It was she who had\r\nwrought him to this pitch\xe2\x80\x94to a marriage which meant his ruin; yet she\r\ncould not, in mercy to her maid, do anything to hinder his plan. Anna\r\nwas coming to Melchester that week, but she could hardly show the girl\r\nthis last reply from the young man; it told too much of the second\r\nindividuality that had usurped the place of the first.\r\n\r\nAnna came, and her mistress took her into her own room for privacy.\r\nAnna began by saying with some anxiety that she was glad the wedding\r\nwas so near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Anna!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Harnham. \xe2\x80\x98I think we must tell him all\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nhave been doing your writing for you?\xe2\x80\x94lest he should not know it till\r\nafter you become his wife, and it might lead to dissension and\r\nrecriminations\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mis\xe2\x80\x99ess, dear mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x94please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him now!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Anna in\r\ndistress. \xe2\x80\x98If you were to do it, perhaps he would not marry me; and\r\nwhat should I do then? It would be terrible what would come to me! And\r\nI am getting on with my writing, too. I have brought with me the\r\ncopybook you were so good as to give me, and I practise every day, and\r\nthough it is so, so hard, I shall do it well at last, I believe, if I\r\nkeep on trying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdith looked at the copybook. The copies had been set by herself, and\r\nsuch progress as the girl had made was in the way of grotesque\r\nfacsimile of her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s hand. But even if Edith\xe2\x80\x99s flowing\r\ncaligraphy were reproduced the inspiration would be another thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do it so beautifully,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Anna, \xe2\x80\x98and say all that I want to\r\nsay so much better than I could say it, that I do hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nme in the lurch just now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other. \xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x94but I thought I ought not to go\r\non!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer strong desire to confide her sentiments led Edith to answer truly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because of its effect upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ have any!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you are married already!\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna with lucid simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mistress hastily; yet glad, despite her\r\nconscience, that two or three outpourings still remained to her. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nyou must concentrate your attention on writing your name as I write it\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSoon Raye wrote about the wedding. Having decided to make the best of\r\nwhat he feared was a piece of romantic folly, he had acquired more zest\r\nfor the grand experiment. He wished the ceremony to be in London, for\r\ngreater privacy. Edith Harnham would have preferred it at Melchester;\r\nAnna was passive. His reasoning prevailed, and Mrs. Harnham threw\r\nherself with mournful zeal into the preparations for Anna\xe2\x80\x99s departure.\r\nIn a last desperate feeling that she must at every hazard be in at the\r\ndeath of her dream, and see once again the man who by a species of\r\ntelepathy had exercised such an influence on her, she offered to go up\r\nwith Anna and be with her through the ceremony\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98to see the end of her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas her mistress put it with forced gaiety; an offer which the girl\r\ngratefully accepted; for she had no other friend capable of playing the\r\npart of companion and witness, in the presence of a gentlemanly\r\nbridegroom, in such a way as not to hasten an opinion that he had made\r\nan irremediable social blunder.\r\n\r\nIt was a muddy morning in March when Raye alighted from a four-wheel\r\ncab at the door of a registry-office in the S.W. district of London,\r\nand carefully handed down Anna and her companion Mrs. Harnham. Anna\r\nlooked attractive in the somewhat fashionable clothes which Mrs.\r\nHarnham had helped her to buy, though not quite so attractive as, an\r\ninnocent child, she had appeared in her country gown on the back of the\r\nwooden horse at Melchester Fair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harnham had come up this morning by an early train, and a young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94a friend of Raye\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94having met them at the door, all four entered\r\nthe registry-office together. Till an hour before this time Raye had\r\nnever known the wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, except at that first casual\r\nencounter, and in the flutter of the performance before them he had\r\nlittle opportunity for more than a brief acquaintance. The contract of\r\nmarriage at a registry is soon got through; but somehow, during its\r\nprogress, Raye discovered a strange and secret gravitation between\r\nhimself and Anna\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\nThe formalities of the wedding\xe2\x80\x94or rather ratification of a previous\r\nunion\xe2\x80\x94being concluded, the four went in one cab to Raye\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings,\r\nnewly taken in a new suburb in preference to a house, the rent of which\r\nhe could ill afford just then. Here Anna cut the little cake which Raye\r\nhad bought at a pastrycook\xe2\x80\x99s on his way home from Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn the\r\nnight before. But she did not do much besides. Raye\xe2\x80\x99s friend was\r\nobliged to depart almost immediately, and when he had left the only\r\nones virtually present were Edith and Raye who exchanged ideas with\r\nmuch animation. The conversation was indeed theirs only, Anna being as\r\na domestic animal who humbly heard but understood not. Raye seemed\r\nstartled in awakening to this fact, and began to feel dissatisfied with\r\nher inadequacy.\r\n\r\nAt last, more disappointed than he cared to own, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs.\r\nHarnham, my darling is so flurried that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she is\r\ndoing or saying. I see that after this event a little quietude will be\r\nnecessary before she gives tongue to that tender philosophy which she\r\nused to treat me to in her letters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had planned to start early that afternoon for Knollsea, to spend\r\nthe few opening days of their married life there, and as the hour for\r\ndeparture was drawing near Raye asked his wife if she would go to the\r\nwriting-desk in the next room and scribble a little note to his sister,\r\nwho had been unable to attend through indisposition, informing her that\r\nthe ceremony was over, thanking her for her little present, and hoping\r\nto know her well now that she was the writer\xe2\x80\x99s sister as well as\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say it in the pretty poetical way you know so well how to adopt,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98for I want you particularly to win her, and both of you to be\r\ndear friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna looked uneasy, but departed to her task, Raye remaining to talk to\r\ntheir guest. Anna was a long while absent, and her husband suddenly\r\nrose and went to her.\r\n\r\nHe found her still bending over the writing-table, with tears brimming\r\nup in her eyes; and he looked down upon the sheet of note-paper with\r\nsome interest, to discover with what tact she had expressed her\r\ngood-will in the delicate circumstances. To his surprise she had\r\nprogressed but a few lines, in the characters and spelling of a child\r\nof eight, and with the ideas of a goose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anna,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, staring; \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It only means\xe2\x80\x94that I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it any better!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, through\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 she insisted, with miserable, sobbing hardihood. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwrite those letters, Charles! I only told _her_ what to write! And not\r\nalways that! But I am learning, O so fast, my dear, dear husband! And\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, for not telling you before?\xe2\x80\x99 She slid to\r\nher knees, abjectly clasped his waist and laid her face against him.\r\n\r\nHe stood a few moments, raised her, abruptly turned, and shut the door\r\nupon her, rejoining Edith in the drawing-room. She saw that something\r\nuntoward had been discovered, and their eyes remained fixed on each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I guess rightly?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, with wan quietude. \xe2\x80\x98_You_ were her\r\nscribe through all this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was necessary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did she dictate every word you ever wrote to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not every word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In fact, very little?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wrote a great part of those pages every week from your own\r\nconceptions, though in her name!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you wrote many of the letters when you were alone, without\r\ncommunication with her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned to the bookcase, and leant with his hand over his face; and\r\nEdith, seeing his distress, became white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have deceived me\xe2\x80\x94ruined me!\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried in her anguish, jumping up and putting her\r\nhand on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delighting me deceptively! Why did you do it\xe2\x80\x94_why_ did you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I began doing it in kindness to her! How could I do otherwise than try\r\nto save such a simple girl from misery? But I admit that I continued it\r\nfor pleasure to myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRaye looked up. \xe2\x80\x98Why did it give you pleasure?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must not tell,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\nHe continued to regard her, and saw that her lips suddenly began to\r\nquiver under his scrutiny, and her eyes to fill and droop. She started\r\naside, and said that she must go to the station to catch the return\r\ntrain: could a cab be called immediately?\r\n\r\nBut Raye went up to her, and took her unresisting hand. \xe2\x80\x98Well, to think\r\nof such a thing as this!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Why, you and I are\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94lovers\xe2\x80\x94devoted lovers\xe2\x80\x94by correspondence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plainly more. It is no use blinking that. Legally I have married\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94God help us both!\xe2\x80\x94in soul and spirit I have married you, and no\r\nother woman in the world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I will not hush! Why should you try to disguise the full truth,\r\nwhen you have already owned half of it? Yes, it is between you and me\r\nthat the bond is\xe2\x80\x94not between me and her! Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more. But, O\r\nmy cruel one, I think I have one claim upon you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe did not say what, and he drew her towards him, and bent over her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it was all pure invention in those letters,\xe2\x80\x99 he said emphatically,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98give me your cheek only. If you meant what you said, let it be lips.\r\nIt is for the first and last time, remember!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe put up her mouth, and he kissed her long. \xe2\x80\x98You forgive me?\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are ruined!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What matter!\xe2\x80\x99 he said shrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x98It serves me right!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe withdrew, wiped her eyes, entered and bade good-bye to Anna, who\r\nhad not expected her to go so soon, and was still wrestling with the\r\nletter. Raye followed Edith downstairs, and in three minutes she was in\r\na hansom driving to the Waterloo station.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his wife. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind the letter, Anna, to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid gently. \xe2\x80\x98Put on your things. We, too, must be off shortly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe simple girl, upheld by the sense that she was indeed married,\r\nshowed her delight at finding that he was as kind as ever after the\r\ndisclosure. She did not know that before his eyes he beheld as it were\r\na galley, in which he, the fastidious urban, was chained to work for\r\nthe remainder of his life, with her, the unlettered peasant, chained to\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nEdith travelled back to Melchester that day with a face that showed the\r\nvery stupor of grief; her lips still tingling from the desperate\r\npressure of his kiss. The end of her impassioned dream had come. When\r\nat dusk she reached the Melchester station her husband was there to\r\nmeet her, but in his perfunctoriness and her preoccupation they did not\r\nsee each other, and she went out of the station alone.\r\n\r\nShe walked mechanically homewards without calling a fly. Entering, she\r\ncould not bear the silence of the house, and went up in the dark to\r\nwhere Anna had slept, where she remained thinking awhile. She then\r\nreturned to the drawing-room, and not knowing what she did, crouched\r\ndown upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have ruined him!\xe2\x80\x99 she kept repeating. \xe2\x80\x98I have ruined him; because I\r\nwould not deal treacherously towards her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the course of half an hour a figure opened the door of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, starting up, for it was dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your husband\xe2\x80\x94who should it be?\xe2\x80\x99 said the worthy merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94my husband!\xe2\x80\x94I forgot I had a husband!\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I missed you at the station,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98Did you see Anna safely\r\ntied up? I hope so, for \xe2\x80\x99twas time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94Anna is married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with Edith\xe2\x80\x99s journey home Anna and her husband were\r\nsitting at the opposite windows of a second-class carriage which sped\r\nalong to Knollsea. In his hand was a pocket-book full of creased sheets\r\nclosely written over. Unfolding them one after another he read them in\r\nsilence, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you doing, dear Charles?\xe2\x80\x99 she said timidly from the other\r\nwindow, and drew nearer to him as if he were a god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reading over all those sweet letters to me signed \xe2\x80\x9cAnna,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 he replied\r\nwith dreary resignation.\r\n\r\n_Autumn_ 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PLEASE HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe interior of St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Church, in Havenpool Town, was slowly\r\ndarkening under the close clouds of a winter afternoon. It was Sunday:\r\nservice had just ended, the face of the parson in the pulpit was buried\r\nin his hands, and the congregation, with a cheerful sigh of release,\r\nwere rising from their knees to depart.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the stillness was so complete that the surging of the\r\nsea could be heard outside the harbour-bar. Then it was broken by the\r\nfootsteps of the clerk going towards the west door to open it in the\r\nusual manner for the exit of the assembly. Before, however, he had\r\nreached the doorway, the latch was lifted from without, and the dark\r\nfigure of a man in a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s garb appeared against the light.\r\n\r\nThe clerk stepped aside, the sailor closed the door gently behind him,\r\nand advanced up the nave till he stood at the chancel-step. The parson\r\nlooked up from the private little prayer which, after so many for the\r\nparish, he quite fairly took for himself; rose to his feet, and stared\r\nat the intruder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sailor, addressing the minister in a\r\nvoice distinctly audible to all the congregation. \xe2\x80\x98I have come here to\r\noffer thanks for my narrow escape from shipwreck. I am given to\r\nunderstand that it is a proper thing to do, if you have no objection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe parson, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, said hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x98I have no\r\nobjection; certainly. It is usual to mention any such wish before\r\nservice, so that the proper words may be used in the General\r\nThanksgiving. But, if you wish, we can read from the form for use after\r\na storm at sea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, sure; I ain\xe2\x80\x99t particular,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe clerk thereupon directed the sailor to the page in the prayer-book\r\nwhere the collect of thanksgiving would be found, and the rector began\r\nreading it, the sailor kneeling where he stood, and repeating it after\r\nhim word by word in a distinct voice. The people, who had remained\r\nagape and motionless at the proceeding, mechanically knelt down\r\nlikewise; but they continued to regard the isolated form of the sailor\r\nwho, in the precise middle of the chancel-step, remained fixed on his\r\nknees, facing the east, his hat beside him, his hands joined, and he\r\nquite unconscious of his appearance in their regard.\r\n\r\nWhen his thanksgiving had come to an end he rose; the people rose also,\r\nand all went out of church together. As soon as the sailor emerged, so\r\nthat the remaining daylight fell upon his face, old inhabitants began\r\nto recognize him as no other than Shadrach Jolliffe, a young man who\r\nhad not been seen at Havenpool for several years. A son of the town,\r\nhis parents had died when he was quite young, on which account he had\r\nearly gone to sea, in the Newfoundland trade.\r\n\r\nHe talked with this and that townsman as he walked, informing them\r\nthat, since leaving his native place years before, he had become\r\ncaptain and owner of a small coasting-ketch, which had providentially\r\nbeen saved from the gale as well as himself. Presently he drew near to\r\ntwo girls who were going out of the churchyard in front of him; they\r\nhad been sitting in the nave at his entry, and had watched his doings\r\nwith deep interest, afterwards discussing him as they moved out of\r\nchurch together. One was a slight and gentle creature, the other a\r\ntall, large-framed, deliberative girl. Captain Jolliffe regarded the\r\nloose curls of their hair, their backs and shoulders, down to their\r\nheels, for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who may them two maids be?\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered to his neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The little one is Emily Hanning; the tall one Joanna Phippard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I recollect \xe2\x80\x99em now, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe advanced to their elbow, and genially stole a gaze at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Emily, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me?\xe2\x80\x99 said the sailor, turning his beaming brown\r\neyes on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I do, Mr. Jolliffe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily shyly.\r\n\r\nThe other girl looked straight at him with her dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The face of Miss Joanna I don\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind so well,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I know her beginnings and kindred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey walked and talked together, Jolliffe narrating particulars of his\r\nlate narrow escape, till they reached the corner of Sloop Lane, in\r\nwhich Emily Hanning dwelt, when, with a nod and smile, she left them.\r\nSoon the sailor parted also from Joanna, and, having no especial errand\r\nor appointment, turned back towards Emily\xe2\x80\x99s house. She lived with her\r\nfather, who called himself an accountant, the daughter, however,\r\nkeeping a little stationery-shop as a supplemental provision for the\r\ngaps of his somewhat uncertain business. On entering Jolliffe found\r\nfather and daughter about to begin tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was tea-time,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Ay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup with\r\nmuch pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe remained to tea and long afterwards, telling more tales of his\r\nseafaring life. Several neighbours called to listen, and were asked to\r\ncome in. Somehow Emily Hanning lost her heart to the sailor that Sunday\r\nnight, and in the course of a week or two there was a tender\r\nunderstanding between them.\r\n\r\nOne moonlight evening in the next month Shadrach was ascending out of\r\nthe town by the long straight road eastward, to an elevated suburb\r\nwhere the more fashionable houses stood\xe2\x80\x94if anything near this ancient\r\nport could be called fashionable\xe2\x80\x94when he saw a figure before him whom,\r\nfrom her manner of glancing back, he took to be Emily. But, on coming\r\nup, he found she was Joanna Phippard. He gave a gallant greeting, and\r\nwalked beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go along,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98or Emily will be jealous!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe seemed not to like the suggestion, and remained. What was said and\r\nwhat was done on that walk never could be clearly recollected by\r\nShadrach; but in some way or other Joanna contrived to wean him away\r\nfrom her gentler and younger rival. From that week onwards, Jolliffe\r\nwas seen more and more in the wake of Joanna Phippard and less in the\r\ncompany of Emily; and it was soon rumoured about the quay that old\r\nJolliffe\xe2\x80\x99s son, who had come home from sea, was going to be married to\r\nthe former young woman, to the great disappointment of the latter.\r\n\r\nJust after this report had gone about, Joanna dressed herself for a\r\nwalk one morning, and started for Emily\xe2\x80\x99s house in the little\r\ncross-street. Intelligence of the deep sorrow of her friend on account\r\nof the loss of Shadrach had reached her ears also, and her conscience\r\nreproached her for winning him away.\r\n\r\nJoanna was not altogether satisfied with the sailor. She liked his\r\nattentions, and she coveted the dignity of matrimony; but she had never\r\nbeen deeply in love with Jolliffe. For one thing, she was ambitious,\r\nand socially his position was hardly so good as her own, and there was\r\nalways the chance of an attractive woman mating considerably above her.\r\nIt had long been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give\r\nhim back again to Emily if her friend felt so very badly about him. To\r\nthis end she had written a letter of renunciation to Shadrach, which\r\nletter she carried in her hand, intending to send it if personal\r\nobservation of Emily convinced her that her friend was suffering.\r\n\r\nJoanna entered Sloop Lane and stepped down into the stationery-shop,\r\nwhich was below the pavement level. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s father was never at home at\r\nthis hour of the day, and it seemed as though Emily were not at home\r\neither, for the visitor could make nobody hear. Customers came so\r\nseldom hither that a five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 absence of the proprietor counted\r\nfor little. Joanna waited in the little shop, where Emily had\r\ntastefully set out\xe2\x80\x94as women can\xe2\x80\x94articles in themselves of slight value,\r\nso as to obscure the meagreness of the stock-in-trade; till she saw a\r\nfigure pausing without the window apparently absorbed in the\r\ncontemplation of the sixpenny books, packets of paper, and prints hung\r\non a string. It was Captain Shadrach Jolliffe, peering in to ascertain\r\nif Emily were there alone. Moved by an impulse of reluctance to meet\r\nhim in a spot which breathed of Emily, Joanna slipped through the door\r\nthat communicated with the parlour at the back. She had frequently done\r\nso before, for in her friendship with Emily she had the freedom of the\r\nhouse without ceremony.\r\n\r\nJolliffe entered the shop. Through the thin blind which screened the\r\nglass partition she could see that he was disappointed at not finding\r\nEmily there. He was about to go out again, when Emily\xe2\x80\x99s form darkened\r\nthe doorway, hastening home from some errand. At sight of Jolliffe she\r\nstarted back as if she would have gone out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t run away, Emily; don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98What can make ye afraid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid, Captain Jolliffe. Only\xe2\x80\x94only I saw you all of a sudden,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94it made me jump!\xe2\x80\x99 Her voice showed that her heart had jumped even\r\nmore than the rest of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I just called as I was passing,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For some paper?\xe2\x80\x99 She hastened behind the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Emily; why do ye get behind there? Why not stay by me? You\r\nseem to hate me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you. How can I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then come out, so that we can talk like Christians.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily obeyed with a fitful laugh, till she stood again beside him in\r\nthe open part of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Captain Jolliffe; because the words belong to\r\nsomebody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I know what you mean. But, Emily, upon my life I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know till\r\nthis morning that you cared one bit about me, or I should not have done\r\nas I have done. I have the best of feelings for Joanna, but I know that\r\nfrom the beginning she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t cared for me more than in a friendly way;\r\nand I see now the one I ought to have asked to be my wife. You know,\r\nEmily, when a man comes home from sea after a long voyage he\xe2\x80\x99s as blind\r\nas a bat\xe2\x80\x94he can\xe2\x80\x99t see who\xe2\x80\x99s who in women. They are all alike to him,\r\nbeautiful creatures, and he takes the first that comes easy, without\r\nthinking if she loves him, or if he might not soon love another better\r\nthan her. From the first I inclined to you most, but you were so\r\nbackward and shy that I thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to bother \xe2\x80\x99ee, and\r\nso I went to Joanna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say any more, Mr. Jolliffe, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, choking. \xe2\x80\x98You are\r\ngoing to marry Joanna next month, and it is wrong to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Emily, my darling!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, and clasped her little figure in his\r\narms before she was aware.\r\n\r\nJoanna, behind the curtain, turned pale, tried to withdraw her eyes,\r\nbut could not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is only you I love as a man ought to love the woman he is going to\r\nmarry; and I know this from what Joanna has said, that she will\r\nwillingly let me off! She wants to marry higher I know, and only said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d to me out of kindness. A fine, tall girl like her isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort\r\nfor a plain sailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife: you be the best suited for that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and kissed her again, her flexible form quivering in the\r\nagitation of his embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder\xe2\x80\x94are you sure\xe2\x80\x94Joanna is going to break off with you? O, are\r\nyou sure? Because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know she would not wish to make us miserable. She will release me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I hope\xe2\x80\x94I hope she will! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay any longer, Captain Jolliffe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe lingered, however, till a customer came for a penny stick of\r\nsealing-wax, and then he withdrew.\r\n\r\nGreen envy had overspread Joanna at the scene. She looked about for a\r\nway of escape. To get out without Emily\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of her visit was\r\nindispensable. She crept from the parlour into the passage, and thence\r\nto the front door of the house, where she let herself noiselessly into\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nThe sight of that caress had reversed all her resolutions. She could\r\nnot let Shadrach go. Reaching home she burnt the letter, and told her\r\nmother that if Captain Jolliffe called she was too unwell to see him.\r\n\r\nShadrach, however, did not call. He sent her a note expressing in\r\nsimple language the state of his feelings; and asked to be allowed to\r\ntake advantage of the hints she had given him that her affection, too,\r\nwas little more than friendly, by cancelling the engagement.\r\n\r\nLooking out upon the harbour and the island beyond he waited and waited\r\nin his lodgings for an answer that did not come. The suspense grew to\r\nbe so intolerable that after dark he went up the High Street. He could\r\nnot resist calling at Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s to learn his fate.\r\n\r\nHer mother said her daughter was too unwell to see him, and to his\r\nquestioning admitted that it was in consequence of a letter received\r\nfrom himself; which had distressed her deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know what it was about, perhaps, Mrs. Phippard?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Phippard owned that she did, adding that it put them in a very\r\npainful position. Thereupon Shadrach, fearing that he had been guilty\r\nof an enormity, explained that if his letter had pained Joanna it must\r\nbe owing to a misunderstanding, since he had thought it would be a\r\nrelief to her. If otherwise, he would hold himself bound by his word,\r\nand she was to think of the letter as never having been written.\r\n\r\nNext morning he received an oral message from the young woman, asking\r\nhim to fetch her home from a meeting that evening. This he did, and\r\nwhile walking from the Town Hall to her door, with her hand in his arm,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all the same as before between us, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Shadrach? Your\r\nletter was sent in mistake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all the same as before,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98if you say it must be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it to be,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured, with hard lineaments, as she thought\r\nof Emily.\r\n\r\nShadrach was a religious and scrupulous man, who respected his word as\r\nhis life. Shortly afterwards the wedding took place, Jolliffe having\r\nconveyed to Emily as gently as possible the error he had fallen into\r\nwhen estimating Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s mood as one of indifference.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA month after the marriage Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s mother died, and the couple were\r\nobliged to turn their attention to very practical matters. Now that she\r\nwas left without a parent, Joanna could not bear the notion of her\r\nhusband going to sea again, but the question was, What could he do at\r\nhome? They finally decided to take on a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop in High Street,\r\nthe goodwill and stock of which were waiting to be disposed of at that\r\ntime. Shadrach knew nothing of shopkeeping, and Joanna very little, but\r\nthey hoped to learn.\r\n\r\nTo the management of this grocery business they now devoted all their\r\nenergies, and continued to conduct it for many succeeding years,\r\nwithout great success. Two sons were born to them, whom their mother\r\nloved to idolatry, although she had never passionately loved her\r\nhusband; and she lavished upon them all her forethought and care. But\r\nthe shop did not thrive, and the large dreams she had entertained of\r\nher sons\xe2\x80\x99 education and career became attenuated in the face of\r\nrealities. Their schooling was of the plainest, but, being by the sea,\r\nthey grew alert in all such nautical arts and enterprises as were\r\nattractive to their age.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of the Jolliffes\xe2\x80\x99 married life, outside their own\r\nimmediate household, had lain in the marriage of Emily. By one of those\r\nodd chances which lead those that lurk in unexpected corners to be\r\ndiscovered, while the obvious are passed by, the gentle girl had been\r\nseen and loved by a thriving merchant of the town, a widower, some\r\nyears older than herself, though still in the prime of life. At first\r\nEmily had declared that she never, never could marry any one; but Mr.\r\nLester had quietly persevered, and had at last won her reluctant\r\nassent. Two children also were the fruits of this union, and, as they\r\ngrew and prospered, Emily declared that she had never supposed that she\r\ncould live to be so happy.\r\n\r\nThe worthy merchant\xe2\x80\x99s home, one of those large, substantial brick\r\nmansions frequently jammed up in old-fashioned towns, faced directly on\r\nthe High Street, nearly opposite to the grocery shop of the Jolliffes,\r\nand it now became the pain of Joanna to behold the woman whose place\r\nshe had usurped out of pure covetousness, looking down from her\r\nposition of comparative wealth upon the humble shop-window with its\r\ndusty sugar-loaves, heaps of raisins, and canisters of tea, over which\r\nit was her own lot to preside. The business having so dwindled, Joanna\r\nwas obliged to serve in the shop herself; and it galled and mortified\r\nher that Emily Lester, sitting in her large drawing-room over the way,\r\ncould witness her own dancings up and down behind the counter at the\r\nbeck and call of wretched twopenny customers, whose patronage she was\r\ndriven to welcome gladly: persons to whom she was compelled to be civil\r\nin the street, while Emily was bounding along with her children and her\r\ngoverness, and conversing with the genteelest people of the town and\r\nneighbourhood. This was what she had gained by not letting Shadrach\r\nJolliffe, whom she had so faintly loved, carry his affection elsewhere.\r\n\r\nShadrach was a good and honest man, and he had been faithful to her in\r\nheart and in deed. Time had clipped the wings of his love for Emily in\r\nhis devotion to the mother of his boys: he had quite lived down that\r\nimpulsive earlier fancy, and Emily had become in his regard nothing\r\nmore than a friend. It was the same with Emily\xe2\x80\x99s feelings for him.\r\nPossibly, had she found the least cause for jealousy, Joanna would\r\nalmost have been better satisfied. It was in the absolute acquiescence\r\nof Emily and Shadrach in the results she herself had contrived that her\r\ndiscontent found nourishment.\r\n\r\nShadrach was not endowed with the narrow shrewdness necessary for\r\ndeveloping a retail business in the face of many competitors. Did a\r\ncustomer inquire if the grocer could really recommend the wondrous\r\nsubstitute for eggs which a persevering bagman had forced into his\r\nstock, he would answer that \xe2\x80\x98when you did not put eggs into a pudding\r\nit was difficult to taste them there\xe2\x80\x99; and when he was asked if his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98real Mocha coffee\xe2\x80\x99 was real Mocha, he would say grimly, \xe2\x80\x98as understood\r\nin small shops.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne summer day, when the big brick house opposite was reflecting the\r\noppressive sun\xe2\x80\x99s heat into the shop, and nobody was present but husband\r\nand wife, Joanna looked across at Emily\xe2\x80\x99s door, where a wealthy\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s carriage had drawn up. Traces of patronage had been visible\r\nin Emily\xe2\x80\x99s manner of late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shadrach, the truth is, you are not a business-man,\xe2\x80\x99 his wife sadly\r\nmurmured. \xe2\x80\x98You were not brought up to shopkeeping, and it is impossible\r\nfor a man to make a fortune at an occupation he has jumped into, as you\r\ndid into this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJolliffe agreed with her, in this as in everything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I care a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end about making a fortune,\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\ncheerfully. \xe2\x80\x98I am happy enough, and we can rub on somehow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked again at the great house through the screen of bottled\r\npickles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rub on\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x98But see how well off Emmy Lester is,\r\nwho used to be so poor! Her boys will go to College, no doubt; and\r\nthink of yours\xe2\x80\x94obliged to go to the Parish School!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShadrach\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had flown to Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody,\xe2\x80\x99 he said good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x98ever did Emily a better turn than\r\nyou did, Joanna, when you warned her off me and put an end to that\r\nlittle simpering nonsense between us, so as to leave it in her power to\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cAye\xe2\x80\x9d to Lester when he came along.\xe2\x80\x99 This almost maddened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of bygones!\xe2\x80\x99 she implored, in stern sadness. \xe2\x80\x98But think,\r\nfor the boys\xe2\x80\x99 and my sake, if not for your own, what are we to do to\r\nget richer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, becoming serious, \xe2\x80\x98to tell the truth, I have always\r\nfelt myself unfit for this business, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never liked to say so.\r\nI seem to want more room for sprawling; a more open space to strike out\r\nin than here among friends and neighbours. I could get rich as well as\r\nany man, if I tried my own way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would! What is your way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To go to sea again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had been the very one to keep him at home, hating the semi-widowed\r\nexistence of sailors\xe2\x80\x99 wives. But her ambition checked her instincts\r\nnow, and she said: \xe2\x80\x98Do you think success really lies that way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure it lies in no other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want to go, Shadrach?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not for the pleasure of it, I can tell \xe2\x80\x99ee. There\xe2\x80\x99s no such pleasure\r\nat sea, Joanna, as I can find in my back parlour here. To speak honest,\r\nI have no love for the brine. I never had much. But if it comes to a\r\nquestion of a fortune for you and the lads, it is another thing. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe only way to it for one born and bred a seafarer as I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it take long to earn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that depends; perhaps not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next morning Shadrach pulled from a chest of drawers the nautical\r\njacket he had worn during the first months of his return, brushed out\r\nthe moths, donned it, and walked down to the quay. The port still did a\r\nfair business in the Newfoundland trade, though not so much as\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this that he invested all he possessed in\r\npurchasing a part-ownership in a brig, of which he was appointed\r\ncaptain. A few months were passed in coast-trading, during which\r\ninterval Shadrach wore off the land-rust that had accumulated upon him\r\nin his grocery phase; and in the spring the brig sailed for\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nJoanna lived on at home with her sons, who were now growing up into\r\nstrong lads, and occupying themselves in various ways about the harbour\r\nand quay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, let them work a little,\xe2\x80\x99 their fond mother said to\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x98Our necessities compel it now, but when Shadrach comes home\r\nthey will be only seventeen and eighteen, and they shall be removed\r\nfrom the port, and their education thoroughly taken in hand by a tutor;\r\nand with the money they\xe2\x80\x99ll have they will perhaps be as near to\r\ngentlemen as Emmy Lester\xe2\x80\x99s precious two, with their algebra and their\r\nLatin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe date for Shadrach\xe2\x80\x99s return drew near and arrived, and he did not\r\nappear. Joanna was assured that there was no cause for anxiety,\r\nsailing-ships being so uncertain in their coming; which assurance\r\nproved to be well grounded, for late one wet evening, about a month\r\nafter the calculated time, the ship was announced as at hand, and\r\npresently the slip-slop step of Shadrach as the sailor sounded in the\r\npassage, and he entered. The boys had gone out and had missed him, and\r\nJoanna was sitting alone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first emotion of reunion between the couple had passed,\r\nJolliffe explained the delay as owing to a small speculative contract,\r\nwhich had produced good results.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was determined not to disappoint \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nown that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this he pulled out an enormous canvas bag, full and rotund as the\r\nmoney-bag of the giant whom Jack slew, untied it, and shook the\r\ncontents out into her lap as she sat in her low chair by the fire. A\r\nmass of sovereigns and guineas (there were guineas on the earth in\r\nthose days) fell into her lap with a sudden thud, weighing down her\r\ngown to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Shadrach complacently. \xe2\x80\x98I told \xe2\x80\x99ee, dear, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it; and\r\nhave I done it or no?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow her face, after the first excitement of possession, did not\r\nretain its glory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a lot of gold, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98And\xe2\x80\x94is this _all_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All? Why, dear Joanna, do you know you can count to three hundred in\r\nthat heap? It is a fortune!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94yes. A fortune\xe2\x80\x94judged by sea; but judged by land\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, she banished considerations of the money for the nonce. Soon\r\nthe boys came in, and next Sunday Shadrach returned thanks to God\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ntime by the more ordinary channel of the italics in the General\r\nThanksgiving. But a few days after, when the question of investing the\r\nmoney arose, he remarked that she did not seem so satisfied as he had\r\nhoped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well you see, Shadrach,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, \xe2\x80\x98_we_ count by hundreds; _they_\r\ncount by thousands\xe2\x80\x99 (nodding towards the other side of the Street).\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have set up a carriage and pair since you left.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, have they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Shadrach, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the world moves. However, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo the best we can with it. But they are rich, and we are poor still!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe greater part of a year was desultorily spent. She moved sadly about\r\nthe house and shop, and the boys were still occupying themselves in and\r\naround the harbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joanna,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, one day, \xe2\x80\x98I see by your movements that it is not\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98My boys will have to live by steering\r\nthe ships that the Lesters own; and I was once above her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJolliffe was not an argumentative man, and he only murmured that he\r\nthought he would make another voyage.\r\n\r\nHe meditated for several days, and coming home from the quay one\r\nafternoon said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could do it for \xe2\x80\x99ee, dear, in one more trip, for certain, if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do what, Shadrach?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enable \xe2\x80\x99ee to count by thousands instead of hundreds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I might take the boys.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Shadrach,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear it! There\xe2\x80\x99s danger at sea. I want them to be\r\nsomething genteel, and no danger to them. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let them risk\r\ntheir lives at sea. O, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever, ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, dear, it shan\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNext day, after a silence, she asked a question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If they were to go with you it would make a great deal of difference,\r\nI suppose, to the profit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twould treble what I should get from the venture single-handed. Under\r\nmy eye they would be as good as two more of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLater on she said: \xe2\x80\x98Tell me more about this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, the boys are almost as clever as master-mariners in handling a\r\ncraft, upon my life! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a more cranky place in the Northern\r\nSeas than about the sandbanks of this harbour, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve practised\r\nhere from their infancy. And they are so steady. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get their\r\nsteadiness and their trustworthiness in half a dozen men twice their\r\nage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is it _very_ dangerous at sea; now, too, there are rumours of\r\nwar?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, well, there be risks. Still . . . \xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe idea grew and magnified, and the mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart was crushed and\r\nstifled by it. Emmy was growing _too_ patronizing; it could not be\r\nborne. Shadrach\xe2\x80\x99s wife could not help nagging him about their\r\ncomparative poverty. The young men, amiable as their father, when\r\nspoken to on the subject of a voyage of enterprise, were quite willing\r\nto embark; and though they, like their father, had no great love for\r\nthe sea, they became quite enthusiastic when the proposal was detailed.\r\n\r\nEverything now hung upon their mother\xe2\x80\x99s assent. She withheld it long,\r\nbut at last gave the word: the young men might accompany their father.\r\nShadrach was unusually cheerful about it: Heaven had preserved him\r\nhitherto, and he had uttered his thanks. God would not forsake those\r\nwho were faithful to him.\r\n\r\nAll that the Jolliffes possessed in the world was put into the\r\nenterprise. The grocery stock was pared down to the least that possibly\r\ncould afford a bare sustenance to Joanna during the absence, which was\r\nto last through the usual \xe2\x80\x98New-f\xe2\x80\x99nland spell.\xe2\x80\x99 How she would endure the\r\nweary time she hardly knew, for the boys had been with her formerly;\r\nbut she nerved herself for the trial.\r\n\r\nThe ship was laden with boots and shoes, ready-made clothing,\r\nfishing-tackle, butter, cheese, cordage, sailcloth, and many other\r\ncommodities; and was to bring back oil, furs, skins, fish, cranberries,\r\nand what else came to hand. But much trading to other ports was to be\r\nundertaken between the voyages out and homeward, and thereby much money\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe brig sailed on a Monday morning in spring; but Joanna did not\r\nwitness its departure. She could not bear the sight that she had been\r\nthe means of bringing about. Knowing this, her husband told her\r\novernight that they were to sail some time before noon next day hence\r\nwhen, awakening at five the next morning, she heard them bustling about\r\ndownstairs, she did not hasten to descend, but lay trying to nerve\r\nherself for the parting, imagining they would leave about nine, as her\r\nhusband had done on his previous voyage. When she did descend she\r\nbeheld words chalked upon the sloping face of the bureau; but no\r\nhusband or sons. In the hastily-scrawled lines Shadrach said they had\r\ngone off thus not to pain her by a leave-taking; and the sons had\r\nchalked under his words: \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, mother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rushed to the quay, and looked down the harbour towards the blue\r\nrim of the sea, but she could only see the masts and bulging sails of\r\nthe _Joanna_; no human figures. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis I have sent them!\xe2\x80\x99 she said\r\nwildly, and burst into tears. In the house the chalked \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnearly broke her heart. But when she had re-entered the front room, and\r\nlooked across at Emily\xe2\x80\x99s, a gleam of triumph lit her thin face at her\r\nanticipated release from the thraldom of subservience.\r\n\r\nTo do Emily Lester justice, her assumption of superiority was mainly a\r\nfigment of Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s brain. That the circumstances of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife were more luxurious than Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s, the former could not conceal;\r\nthough whenever the two met, which was not very often now, Emily\r\nendeavoured to subdue the difference by every means in her power.\r\n\r\nThe first summer lapsed away; and Joanna meagrely maintained herself by\r\nthe shop, which now consisted of little more than a window and a\r\ncounter. Emily was, in truth, her only large customer; and Mrs.\r\nLester\xe2\x80\x99s kindly readiness to buy anything and everything without\r\nquestioning the quality had a sting of bitterness in it, for it was the\r\nuncritical attitude of a patron, and almost of a donor. The long dreary\r\nwinter moved on; the face of the bureau had been turned to the wall to\r\nprotect the chalked words of farewell, for Joanna could never bring\r\nherself to rub them out; and she often glanced at them with wet eyes.\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s handsome boys came home for the Christmas holidays; the\r\nUniversity was talked of for them; and still Joanna subsisted as it\r\nwere with held breath, like a person submerged. Only one summer more,\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x98spell\xe2\x80\x99 would end. Towards the close of the time Emily called\r\non her quondam friend. She had heard that Joanna began to feel anxious;\r\nshe had received no letter from husband or sons for some months.\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s silks rustled arrogantly when, in response to Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s almost\r\ndumb invitation, she squeezed through the opening of the counter and\r\ninto the parlour behind the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_You_ are all success, and _I_ am all the other way!\xe2\x80\x99 said Joanna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But why do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily. \xe2\x80\x98They are to bring back a\r\nfortune, I hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! will they come? The doubt is more than a woman can bear. All three\r\nin one ship\xe2\x80\x94think of that! And I have not heard of them for months!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the time is not up. You should not meet misfortune half-way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing will repay me for the grief of their absence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why did you let them go? You were doing fairly well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I made them go!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, turning vehemently upon Emily. \xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you why! I could not bear that we should be only muddling on, and\r\nyou so rich and thriving! Now I have told you, and you may hate me if\r\nyou will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall never hate you, Joanna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she proved the truth of her words afterwards. The end of autumn\r\ncame, and the brig should have been in port; but nothing like the\r\n_Joanna_ appeared in the channel between the sands. It was now really\r\ntime to be uneasy. Joanna Jolliffe sat by the fire, and every gust of\r\nwind caused her a cold thrill. She had always feared and detested the\r\nsea; to her it was a treacherous, restless, slimy creature, glorying in\r\nthe griefs of women. \xe2\x80\x98Still,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98they _must_ come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe recalled to her mind that Shadrach had said before starting that if\r\nthey returned safe and sound, with success crowning their enterprise,\r\nhe would go as he had gone after his shipwreck, and kneel with his sons\r\nin the church, and offer sincere thanks for their deliverance. She went\r\nto church regularly morning and afternoon, and sat in the most forward\r\npew, nearest the chancel-step. Her eyes were mostly fixed on that step,\r\nwhere Shadrach had knelt in the bloom of his young manhood: she knew to\r\nan inch the spot which his knees had pressed twenty winters before; his\r\noutline as he had knelt, his hat on the step beside him. God was good.\r\nSurely her husband must kneel there again: a son on each side as he had\r\nsaid; George just here, Jim just there. By long watching the spot as\r\nshe worshipped it became as if she saw the three returned ones there\r\nkneeling; the two slim outlines of her boys, the more bulky form\r\nbetween them; their hands clasped, their heads shaped against the\r\neastern wall. The fancy grew almost to an hallucination: she could\r\nnever turn her worn eyes to the step without seeing them there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they did not come. Heaven was merciful, but it was not yet\r\npleased to relieve her soul. This was her purgation for the sin of\r\nmaking them the slaves of her ambition. But it became more than\r\npurgation soon, and her mood approached despair. Months had passed\r\nsince the brig had been due, but it had not returned.\r\n\r\nJoanna was always hearing or seeing evidences of their arrival. When on\r\nthe hill behind the port, whence a view of the open Channel could be\r\nobtained, she felt sure that a little speck on the horizon, breaking\r\nthe eternally level waste of waters southward, was the truck of the\r\n_Joana\xe2\x80\x99s_ mainmast. Or when indoors, a shout or excitement of any kind\r\nat the corner of the Town Cellar, where the High Street joined the\r\nQuay, caused her to spring to her feet and cry: \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis they!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it was not. The visionary forms knelt every Sunday afternoon on the\r\nchancel-step, but not the real. Her shop had, as it were, eaten itself\r\nhollow. In the apathy which had resulted from her loneliness and grief\r\nshe had ceased to take in the smallest supplies, and thus had sent away\r\nher last customer.\r\n\r\nIn this strait Emily Lester tried by every means in her power to aid\r\nthe afflicted woman; but she met with constant repulses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see you!\xe2\x80\x99 Joanna would whisper\r\nhoarsely when Emily came to her and made advances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I want to help and soothe you, Joanna,\xe2\x80\x99 Emily would say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a lady, with a rich husband and fine sons! What can you want\r\nwith a bereaved crone like me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joanna, I want this: I want you to come and live in my house, and not\r\nstay alone in this dismal place any longer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And suppose they come and don\xe2\x80\x99t find me at home? You wish to separate\r\nme and mine! No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank\r\nyou, whatever kindness you do me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, as time went on Joanna could not afford to pay the rent of the\r\nshop and house without an income. She was assured that all hope of the\r\nreturn of Shadrach and his sons was vain, and she reluctantly consented\r\nto accept the asylum of the Lesters\xe2\x80\x99 house. Here she was allotted a\r\nroom of her own on the second floor, and went and came as she chose,\r\nwithout contact with the family. Her hair greyed and whitened, deep\r\nlines channeled her forehead, and her form grew gaunt and stooping. But\r\nshe still expected the lost ones, and when she met Emily on the\r\nstaircase she would say morosely: \xe2\x80\x98I know why you\xe2\x80\x99ve got me here!\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and be disappointed at not finding me at home, and\r\nperhaps go away again; and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be revenged for my taking\r\nShadrach away from \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily Lester bore these reproaches from the grief-stricken soul. She\r\nwas sure\xe2\x80\x94all the people of Havenpool were sure\xe2\x80\x94that Shadrach and his\r\nsons could not return. For years the vessel had been given up as lost.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when awakened at night by any noise, Joanna would rise\r\nfrom bed and glance at the shop opposite by the light from the\r\nflickering lamp, to make sure it was not they.\r\n\r\nIt was a damp and dark December night, six years after the departure of\r\nthe brig _Joanna_. The wind was from the sea, and brought up a fishy\r\nmist which mopped the face like moist flannel. Joanna had prayed her\r\nusual prayer for the absent ones with more fervour and confidence than\r\nshe had felt for months, and had fallen asleep about eleven. It must\r\nhave been between one and two when she suddenly started up. She had\r\ncertainly heard steps in the street, and the voices of Shadrach and her\r\nsons calling at the door of the grocery shop. She sprang out of bed,\r\nand, hardly knowing what clothing she dragged on herself; hastened down\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s large and carpeted staircase, put the candle on the hall-table,\r\nunfastened the bolts and chain, and stepped into the street. The mist,\r\nblowing up the street from the Quay, hindered her seeing the shop,\r\nalthough it was so near; but she had crossed to it in a moment. How was\r\nit? Nobody stood there. The wretched woman walked wildly up and down\r\nwith her bare feet\xe2\x80\x94there was not a soul. She returned and knocked with\r\nall her might at the door which had once been her own\xe2\x80\x94they might have\r\nbeen admitted for the night, unwilling to disturb her till the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was not till several minutes had elapsed that the young man who now\r\nkept the shop looked out of an upper window, and saw the skeleton of\r\nsomething human standing below half-dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has anybody come?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Mrs. Jolliffe, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the young man\r\nkindly, for he was aware how her baseless expectations moved her. \xe2\x80\x98No;\r\nnobody has come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n_June_ 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MELANCHOLY HUSSAR OF THE GERMAN LEGION\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nHere stretch the downs, high and breezy and green, absolutely unchanged\r\nsince those eventful days. A plough has never disturbed the turf, and\r\nthe sod that was uppermost then is uppermost now. Here stood the camp;\r\nhere are distinct traces of the banks thrown up for the horses of the\r\ncavalry, and spots where the midden-heaps lay are still to be observed.\r\nAt night, when I walk across the lonely place, it is impossible to\r\navoid hearing, amid the scourings of the wind over the grass-bents and\r\nthistles, the old trumpet and bugle calls, the rattle of the halters;\r\nto help seeing rows of spectral tents and the _impedimenta_ of the\r\nsoldiery. From within the canvases come guttural syllables of foreign\r\ntongues, and broken songs of the fatherland; for they were mainly\r\nregiments of the King\xe2\x80\x99s German Legion that slept round the tent-poles\r\nhereabout at that time.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ninety years ago. The British uniform of the period, with\r\nits immense epaulettes, queer cocked-hat, breeches, gaiters, ponderous\r\ncartridge-box, buckled shoes, and what not, would look strange and\r\nbarbarous now. Ideas have changed; invention has followed invention.\r\nSoldiers were monumental objects then. A divinity still hedged kings\r\nhere and there; and war was considered a glorious thing.\r\n\r\nSecluded old manor-houses and hamlets lie in the ravines and hollows\r\namong these hills, where a stranger had hardly ever been seen till the\r\nKing chose to take the baths yearly at the sea-side watering-place a\r\nfew miles to the south; as a consequence of which battalions descended\r\nin a cloud upon the open country around. Is it necessary to add that\r\nthe echoes of many characteristic tales, dating from that picturesque\r\ntime, still linger about here in more or less fragmentary form, to be\r\ncaught by the attentive ear? Some of them I have repeated; most of them\r\nI have forgotten; one I have never repeated, and assuredly can never\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nPhyllis told me the story with her own lips. She was then an old lady\r\nof seventy-five, and her auditor a lad of fifteen. She enjoined silence\r\nas to her share in the incident, till she should be \xe2\x80\x98dead, buried, and\r\nforgotten.\xe2\x80\x99 Her life was prolonged twelve years after the day of her\r\nnarration, and she has now been dead nearly twenty. The oblivion which\r\nin her modesty and humility she courted for herself has only partially\r\nfallen on her, with the unfortunate result of inflicting an injustice\r\nupon her memory; since such fragments of her story as got abroad at the\r\ntime, and have been kept alive ever since, are precisely those which\r\nare most unfavourable to her character.\r\n\r\nIt all began with the arrival of the York Hussars, one of the foreign\r\nregiments above alluded to. Before that day scarcely a soul had been\r\nseen near her father\xe2\x80\x99s house for weeks. When a noise like the brushing\r\nskirt of a visitor was heard on the doorstep, it proved to be a\r\nscudding leaf; when a carriage seemed to be nearing the door, it was\r\nher father grinding his sickle on the stone in the garden for his\r\nfavourite relaxation of trimming the box-tree borders to the plots. A\r\nsound like luggage thrown down from the coach was a gun far away at\r\nsea; and what looked like a tall man by the gate at dusk was a yew bush\r\ncut into a quaint and attenuated shape. There is no such solitude in\r\ncountry places now as there was in those old days.\r\n\r\nYet all the while King George and his court were at his favourite\r\nsea-side resort, not more than five miles off.\r\n\r\nThe daughter\xe2\x80\x99s seclusion was great, but beyond the seclusion of the\r\ngirl lay the seclusion of the father. If her social condition was\r\ntwilight, his was darkness. Yet he enjoyed his darkness, while her\r\ntwilight oppressed her. Dr. Grove had been a professional man whose\r\ntaste for lonely meditation over metaphysical questions had diminished\r\nhis practice till it no longer paid him to keep it going; after which\r\nhe had relinquished it and hired at a nominal rent the small,\r\ndilapidated, half farm half manor-house of this obscure inland nook, to\r\nmake a sufficiency of an income which in a town would have been\r\ninadequate for their maintenance. He stayed in his garden the greater\r\npart of the day, growing more and more irritable with the lapse of\r\ntime, and the increasing perception that he had wasted his life in the\r\npursuit of illusions. He saw his friends less and less frequently.\r\nPhyllis became so shy that if she met a stranger anywhere in her short\r\nrambles she felt ashamed at his gaze, walked awkwardly, and blushed to\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\nYet Phyllis was discovered even here by an admirer, and her hand most\r\nunexpectedly asked in marriage.\r\n\r\nThe King, as aforesaid, was at the neighbouring town, where he had\r\ntaken up his abode at Gloucester Lodge and his presence in the town\r\nnaturally brought many county people thither. Among these idlers\xe2\x80\x94many\r\nof whom professed to have connections and interests with the Court\xe2\x80\x94was\r\none Humphrey Gould, a bachelor; a personage neither young nor old;\r\nneither good-looking nor positively plain. Too steady-going to be \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nbuck\xe2\x80\x99 (as fast and unmarried men were then called), he was an\r\napproximately fashionable man of a mild type. This bachelor of thirty\r\nfound his way to the village on the down: beheld Phyllis; made her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance in order to make hers; and by some means or other\r\nshe sufficiently inflamed his heart to lead him in that direction\r\nalmost daily; till he became engaged to marry her.\r\n\r\nAs he was of an old local family, some of whose members were held in\r\nrespect in the county, Phyllis, in bringing him to her feet, had\r\naccomplished what was considered a brilliant move for one in her\r\nconstrained position. How she had done it was not quite known to\r\nPhyllis herself. In those days unequal marriages were regarded rather\r\nas a violation of the laws of nature than as a mere infringement of\r\nconvention, the more modern view, and hence when Phyllis, of the\r\nwatering-place bourgeoisie, was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow, it\r\nwas as if she were going to be taken to heaven, though perhaps the\r\nuninformed would have seen no great difference in the respective\r\npositions of the pair, the said Gould being as poor as a crow.\r\n\r\nThis pecuniary condition was his excuse\xe2\x80\x94probably a true one\xe2\x80\x94for\r\npostponing their union, and as the winter drew nearer, and the King\r\ndeparted for the season, Mr. Humphrey Gould set out for Bath, promising\r\nto return to Phyllis in a few weeks. The winter arrived, the date of\r\nhis promise passed, yet Gould postponed his coming, on the ground that\r\nhe could not very easily leave his father in the city of their sojourn,\r\nthe elder having no other relative near him. Phyllis, though lonely in\r\nthe extreme, was content. The man who had asked her in marriage was a\r\ndesirable husband for her in many ways; her father highly approved of\r\nhis suit; but this neglect of her was awkward, if not painful, for\r\nPhyllis. Love him in the true sense of the word she assured me she\r\nnever did, but she had a genuine regard for him; admired a certain\r\nmethodical and dogged way in which he sometimes took his pleasure;\r\nvalued his knowledge of what the Court was doing, had done, or was\r\nabout to do; and she was not without a feeling of pride that he had\r\nchosen her when he might have exercised a more ambitious choice.\r\n\r\nBut he did not come; and the spring developed. His letters were regular\r\nthough formal; and it is not to be wondered that the uncertainty of her\r\nposition, linked with the fact that there was not much passion in her\r\nthoughts of Humphrey, bred an indescribable dreariness in the heart of\r\nPhyllis Grove. The spring was soon summer, and the summer brought the\r\nKing; but still no Humphrey Gould. All this while the engagement by\r\nletter was maintained intact.\r\n\r\nAt this point of time a golden radiance flashed in upon the lives of\r\npeople here, and charged all youthful thought with emotional interest.\r\nThis radiance was the aforesaid York Hussars.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe present generation has probably but a very dim notion of the\r\ncelebrated York Hussars of ninety years ago. They were one of the\r\nregiments of the King\xe2\x80\x99s German Legion, and (though they somewhat\r\ndegenerated later on) their brilliant uniform, their splendid horses,\r\nand above all, their foreign air and mustachios (rare appendages then),\r\ndrew crowds of admirers of both sexes wherever they went. These with\r\nother regiments had come to encamp on the downs and pastures, because\r\nof the presence of the King in the neighbouring town.\r\n\r\nThe spot was high and airy, and the view extensive, commanding the Isle\r\nof Portland in front, and reaching to St. Aldhelm\xe2\x80\x99s Head eastward, and\r\nalmost to the Start on the west.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, though not precisely a girl of the village, was as interested\r\nas any of them in this military investment. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s home stood\r\nsomewhat apart, and on the highest point of ground to which the lane\r\nascended, so that it was almost level with the top of the church tower\r\nin the lower part of the parish. Immediately from the outside of the\r\ngarden-wall the grass spread away to a great distance, and it was\r\ncrossed by a path which came close to the wall. Ever since her\r\nchildhood it had been Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure to clamber up this fence and\r\nsit on the top\xe2\x80\x94a feat not so difficult as it may seem, the walls in\r\nthis district being built of rubble, without mortar, so that there were\r\nplenty of crevices for small toes.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting up here one day, listlessly surveying the pasture\r\nwithout, when her attention was arrested by a solitary figure walking\r\nalong the path. It was one of the renowned German Hussars, and he moved\r\nonward with his eyes on the ground, and with the manner of one who\r\nwished to escape company. His head would probably have been bent like\r\nhis eyes but for his stiff neck-gear. On nearer view she perceived that\r\nhis face was marked with deep sadness. Without observing her, he\r\nadvanced by the footpath till it brought him almost immediately under\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nPhyllis was much surprised to see a fine, tall soldier in such a mood\r\nas this. Her theory of the military, and of the York Hussars in\r\nparticular (derived entirely from hearsay, for she had never talked to\r\na soldier in her life), was that their hearts were as gay as their\r\naccoutrements.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Hussar lifted his eyes and noticed her on her perch,\r\nthe white muslin neckerchief which covered her shoulders and neck where\r\nleft bare by her low gown, and her white raiment in general, showing\r\nconspicuously in the bright sunlight of this summer day. He blushed a\r\nlittle at the suddenness of the encounter, and without halting a moment\r\nfrom his pace passed on.\r\n\r\nAll that day the foreigner\xe2\x80\x99s face haunted Phyllis; its aspect was so\r\nstriking, so handsome, and his eyes were so blue, and sad, and\r\nabstracted. It was perhaps only natural that on some following day at\r\nthe same hour she should look over that wall again, and wait till he\r\nhad passed a second time. On this occasion he was reading a letter, and\r\nat the sight of her his manner was that of one who had half expected or\r\nhoped to discover her. He almost stopped, smiled, and made a courteous\r\nsalute. The end of the meeting was that they exchanged a few words. She\r\nasked him what he was reading, and he readily informed her that he was\r\nre-perusing letters from his mother in Germany; he did not get them\r\noften, he said, and was forced to read the old ones a great many times.\r\nThis was all that passed at the present interview, but others of the\r\nsame kind followed.\r\n\r\nPhyllis used to say that his English, though not good, was quite\r\nintelligible to her, so that their acquaintance was never hindered by\r\ndifficulties of speech. Whenever the subject became too delicate,\r\nsubtle, or tender, for such words of English as were at his command,\r\nthe eyes no doubt helped out the tongue, and\xe2\x80\x94though this was later\r\non\xe2\x80\x94the lips helped out the eyes. In short this acquaintance,\r\nunguardedly made, and rash enough on her part, developed and ripened.\r\nLike Desdemona, she pitied him, and learnt his history.\r\n\r\nHis name was Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina, and Saarbr\xc3\xbcck his native town, where his\r\nmother was still living. His age was twenty-two, and he had already\r\nrisen to the grade of corporal, though he had not long been in the\r\narmy. Phyllis used to assert that no such refined or well-educated\r\nyoung man could have been found in the ranks of the purely English\r\nregiments, some of these foreign soldiers having rather the graceful\r\nmanner and presence of our native officers than of our rank and file.\r\n\r\nShe by degrees learnt from her foreign friend a circumstance about\r\nhimself and his comrades which Phyllis would least have expected of the\r\nYork Hussars. So far from being as gay as its uniform, the regiment was\r\npervaded by a dreadful melancholy, a chronic home-sickness, which\r\ndepressed many of the men to such an extent that they could hardly\r\nattend to their drill. The worst sufferers were the younger soldiers\r\nwho had not been over here long. They hated England and English life;\r\nthey took no interest whatever in King George and his island kingdom,\r\nand they only wished to be out of it and never to see it any more.\r\nTheir bodies were here, but their hearts and minds were always far away\r\nin their dear fatherland, of which\xe2\x80\x94brave men and stoical as they were\r\nin many ways\xe2\x80\x94they would speak with tears in their eyes. One of the\r\nworst of the sufferers from this home-woe, as he called it in his own\r\ntongue, was Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina, whose dreamy musing nature felt the gloom of\r\nexile still more intensely from the fact that he had left a lonely\r\nmother at home with nobody to cheer her.\r\n\r\nThough Phyllis, touched by all this, and interested in his history, did\r\nnot disdain her soldier\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, she declined (according to her\r\nown account, at least) to permit the young man to overstep the line of\r\nmere friendship for a long while\xe2\x80\x94as long, indeed, as she considered\r\nherself likely to become the possession of another; though it is\r\nprobable that she had lost her heart to Matth\xc3\xa4us before she was herself\r\naware. The stone wall of necessity made anything like intimacy\r\ndifficult; and he had never ventured to come, or to ask to come, inside\r\nthe garden, so that all their conversation had been overtly conducted\r\nacross this boundary.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBut news reached the village from a friend of Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nconcerning Mr. Humphrey Gould, her remarkably cool and patient\r\nbetrothed. This gentleman had been heard to say in Bath that he\r\nconsidered his overtures to Miss Phyllis Grove to have reached only the\r\nstage of a half-understanding; and in view of his enforced absence on\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s account, who was too great an invalid now to attend to his\r\naffairs, he thought it best that there should be no definite promise as\r\nyet on either side. He was not sure, indeed, that he might not cast his\r\neyes elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis account\xe2\x80\x94though only a piece of hearsay, and as such entitled to no\r\nabsolute credit\xe2\x80\x94tallied so well with the infrequency of his letters and\r\ntheir lack of warmth, that Phyllis did not doubt its truth for one\r\nmoment; and from that hour she felt herself free to bestow her heart as\r\nshe should choose. Not so her father; he declared the whole story to be\r\na fabrication. He had known Mr. Gould\xe2\x80\x99s family from his boyhood; and if\r\nthere was one proverb which expressed the matrimonial aspect of that\r\nfamily well, it was \xe2\x80\x98Love me little, love me long.\xe2\x80\x99 Humphrey was an\r\nhonourable man, who would not think of treating his engagement so\r\nlightly. \xe2\x80\x98Do you wait in patience,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98all will be right enough\r\nin time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom these words Phyllis at first imagined that her father was in\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Gould; and her heart sank within her; for in\r\nspite of her original intentions she had been relieved to hear that her\r\nengagement had come to nothing. But she presently learnt that her\r\nfather had heard no more of Humphrey Gould than she herself had done;\r\nwhile he would not write and address her affianced directly on the\r\nsubject, lest it should be deemed an imputation on that bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want an excuse for encouraging one or other of those foreign\r\nfellows to flatter you with his unmeaning attentions,\xe2\x80\x99 her father\r\nexclaimed, his mood having of late been a very unkind one towards her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see more than I say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever set foot outside that\r\ngarden-fence without my permission. If you want to see the camp I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake you myself some Sunday afternoon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhyllis had not the smallest intention of disobeying him in her\r\nactions, but she assumed herself to be independent with respect to her\r\nfeelings. She no longer checked her fancy for the Hussar, though she\r\nwas far from regarding him as her lover in the serious sense in which\r\nan Englishman might have been regarded as such. The young foreign\r\nsoldier was almost an ideal being to her, with none of the\r\nappurtenances of an ordinary house-dweller; one who had descended she\r\nknew not whence, and would disappear she knew not whither; the subject\r\nof a fascinating dream\xe2\x80\x94no more.\r\n\r\nThey met continually now\xe2\x80\x94mostly at dusk\xe2\x80\x94during the brief interval\r\nbetween the going down of the sun and the minute at which the last\r\ntrumpet-call summoned him to his tent. Perhaps her manner had become\r\nless restrained latterly; at any rate that of the Hussar was so; he had\r\ngrown more tender every day, and at parting after these hurried\r\ninterviews she reached down her hand from the top of the wall that he\r\nmight press it. One evening he held it so long that she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nwall is white, and somebody in the field may see your shape against\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe lingered so long that night that it was with the greatest difficulty\r\nthat he could run across the intervening stretch of ground and enter\r\nthe camp in time. On the next occasion of his awaiting her she did not\r\nappear in her usual place at the usual hour. His disappointment was\r\nunspeakably keen; he remained staring blankly at the spot, like a man\r\nin a trance. The trumpets and tattoo sounded, and still he did not go.\r\n\r\nShe had been delayed purely by an accident. When she arrived she was\r\nanxious because of the lateness of the hour, having heard as well as he\r\nthe sounds denoting the closing of the camp. She implored him to leave\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gloomily. \xe2\x80\x98I shall not go in yet\xe2\x80\x94the moment you come\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave thought of your coming all day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you may be disgraced at being after time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that. I should have disappeared from the world some time\r\nago if it had not been for two persons\xe2\x80\x94my beloved, here, and my mother\r\nin Saarbr\xc3\xbcck. I hate the army. I care more for a minute of your company\r\nthan for all the promotion in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus he stayed and talked to her, and told her interesting details of\r\nhis native place, and incidents of his childhood, till she was in a\r\nsimmer of distress at his recklessness in remaining. It was only\r\nbecause she insisted on bidding him good-night and leaving the wall\r\nthat he returned to his quarters.\r\n\r\nThe next time that she saw him he was without the stripes that had\r\nadorned his sleeve. He had been broken to the level of private for his\r\nlateness that night; and as Phyllis considered herself to be the cause\r\nof his disgrace her sorrow was great. But the position was now\r\nreversed; it was his turn to cheer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t grieve, meine Liebliche!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I have got a remedy for\r\nwhatever comes. First, even supposing I regain my stripes, would your\r\nfather allow you to marry a non-commissioned officer in the York\r\nHussars?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flushed. This practical step had not been in her mind in relation\r\nto such an unrealistic person as he was; and a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection was\r\nenough for it. \xe2\x80\x98My father would not\xe2\x80\x94certainly would not,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered\r\nunflinchingly. \xe2\x80\x98It cannot be thought of! My dear friend, please do\r\nforget me: I fear I am ruining you and your prospects!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98You are giving this country of yours just\r\nsufficient interest to me to make me care to keep alive in it. If my\r\ndear land were here also, and my old parent, with you, I could be happy\r\nas I am, and would do my best as a soldier. But it is not so. And now\r\nlisten. This is my plan. That you go with me to my own country, and be\r\nmy wife there, and live there with my mother and me. I am not a\r\nHanoverian, as you know, though I entered the army as such; my country\r\nis by the Saar, and is at peace with France, and if I were once in it I\r\nshould be free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how get there?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked. Phyllis had been rather amazed than\r\nshocked at his proposition. Her position in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house was\r\ngrowing irksome and painful in the extreme; his parental affection\r\nseemed to be quite dried up. She was not a native of the village, like\r\nall the joyous girls around her; and in some way Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina had\r\ninfected her with his own passionate longing for his country, and\r\nmother, and home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how?\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, finding that he did not answer. \xe2\x80\x98Will you buy\r\nyour discharge?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, no,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s impossible in these times. No; I came here\r\nagainst my will; why should I not escape? Now is the time, as we shall\r\nsoon be striking camp, and I might see you no more. This is my scheme.\r\nI will ask you to meet me on the highway two miles off; on some calm\r\nnight next week that may be appointed. There will be nothing unbecoming\r\nin it, or to cause you shame; you will not fly alone with me, for I\r\nwill bring with me my devoted young friend Christoph, an Alsatian, who\r\nhas lately joined the regiment, and who has agreed to assist in this\r\nenterprise. We shall have come from yonder harbour, where we shall have\r\nexamined the boats, and found one suited to our purpose. Christoph has\r\nalready a chart of the Channel, and we will then go to the harbour, and\r\nat midnight cut the boat from her moorings, and row away round the\r\npoint out of sight; and by the next morning we are on the coast of\r\nFrance, near Cherbourg. The rest is easy, for I have saved money for\r\nthe land journey, and can get a change of clothes. I will write to my\r\nmother, who will meet us on the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe added details in reply to her inquiries, which left no doubt in\r\nPhyllis\xe2\x80\x99s mind of the feasibility of the undertaking. But its magnitude\r\nalmost appalled her; and it is questionable if she would ever have gone\r\nfurther in the wild adventure if, on entering the house that night, her\r\nfather had not accosted her in the most significant terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How about the York Hussars?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are still at the camp; but they are soon going away, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is useless for you to attempt to cloak your actions in that way.\r\nYou have been meeting one of those fellows; you have been seen walking\r\nwith him\xe2\x80\x94foreign barbarians, not much better than the French\r\nthemselves! I have made up my mind\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word till I have done,\r\nplease!\xe2\x80\x94I have made up my mind that you shall stay here no longer while\r\nthey are on the spot. You shall go to your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was useless for her to protest that she had never taken a walk with\r\nany soldier or man under the sun except himself. Her protestations were\r\nfeeble, too, for though he was not literally correct in his assertion,\r\nhe was virtually only half in error.\r\n\r\nThe house of her father\xe2\x80\x99s sister was a prison to Phyllis. She had quite\r\nrecently undergone experience of its gloom; and when her father went on\r\nto direct her to pack what would be necessary for her to take, her\r\nheart died within her. In after years she never attempted to excuse her\r\nconduct during this week of agitation; but the result of her\r\nself-communing was that she decided to join in the scheme of her lover\r\nand his friend, and fly to the country which he had coloured with such\r\nlovely hues in her imagination. She always said that the one feature in\r\nhis proposal which overcame her hesitation was the obvious purity and\r\nstraightforwardness of his intentions. He showed himself to be so\r\nvirtuous and kind; he treated her with a respect to which she had never\r\nbefore been accustomed; and she was braced to the obvious risks of the\r\nvoyage by her confidence in him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIt was on a soft, dark evening of the following week that they engaged\r\nin the adventure. Tina was to meet her at a point in the highway at\r\nwhich the lane to the village branched off. Christoph was to go ahead\r\nof them to the harbour where the boat lay, row it round the Nothe\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nLook-out as it was called in those days\xe2\x80\x94and pick them up on the other\r\nside of the promontory, which they were to reach by crossing the\r\nharbour-bridge on foot, and climbing over the Look-out hill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her father had ascended to his room she left the house, and,\r\nbundle in hand, proceeded at a trot along the lane. At such an hour not\r\na soul was afoot anywhere in the village, and she reached the junction\r\nof the lane with the highway unobserved. Here she took up her position\r\nin the obscurity formed by the angle of a fence, whence she could\r\ndiscern every one who approached along the turnpike-road, without being\r\nherself seen.\r\n\r\nShe had not remained thus waiting for her lover longer than a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94though from the tension of her nerves the lapse of even that\r\nshort time was trying\xe2\x80\x94when, instead of the expected footsteps, the\r\nstage-coach could be heard descending the hill. She knew that Tina\r\nwould not show himself till the road was clear, and waited impatiently\r\nfor the coach to pass. Nearing the corner where she was it slackened\r\nspeed, and, instead of going by as usual, drew up within a few yards of\r\nher. A passenger alighted, and she heard his voice. It was Humphrey\r\nGould\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe had brought a friend with him, and luggage. The luggage was\r\ndeposited on the grass, and the coach went on its route to the royal\r\nwatering-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder where that young man is with the horse and trap?\xe2\x80\x99 said her\r\nformer admirer to his companion. \xe2\x80\x98I hope we shan\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait here\r\nlong. I told him half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you got her present safe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s? O, yes. It is in this trunk. I hope it will please her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it will. What woman would not be pleased with such a\r\nhandsome peace-offering?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well\xe2\x80\x94she deserves it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve treated her rather badly. But she has been\r\nin my mind these last two days much more than I should care to confess\r\nto everybody. Ah, well; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more about that. It cannot be that\r\nshe is so bad as they make out. I am quite sure that a girl of her good\r\nwit would know better than to get entangled with any of those\r\nHanoverian soldiers. I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it of her, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end\r\non\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMore words in the same strain were casually dropped as the two men\r\nwaited; words which revealed to her, as by a sudden illumination, the\r\nenormity of her conduct. The conversation was at length cut off by the\r\narrival of the man with the vehicle. The luggage was placed in it, and\r\nthey mounted, and were driven on in the direction from which she had\r\njust come.\r\n\r\nPhyllis was so conscience-stricken that she was at first inclined to\r\nfollow them; but a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection led her to feel that it would\r\nonly be bare justice to Matth\xc3\xa4us to wait till he arrived, and explain\r\ncandidly that she had changed her mind\xe2\x80\x94difficult as the struggle would\r\nbe when she stood face to face with him. She bitterly reproached\r\nherself for having believed reports which represented Humphrey Gould as\r\nfalse to his engagement, when, from what she now heard from his own\r\nlips, she gathered that he had been living full of trust in her. But\r\nshe knew well enough who had won her love. Without him her life seemed\r\na dreary prospect, yet the more she looked at his proposal the more she\r\nfeared to accept it\xe2\x80\x94so wild as it was, so vague, so venturesome. She\r\nhad promised Humphrey Gould, and it was only his assumed faithlessness\r\nwhich had led her to treat that promise as nought. His solicitude in\r\nbringing her these gifts touched her; her promise must be kept, and\r\nesteem must take the place of love. She would preserve her\r\nself-respect. She would stay at home, and marry him, and suffer.\r\n\r\nPhyllis had thus braced herself to an exceptional fortitude when, a few\r\nminutes later, the outline of Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina appeared behind a\r\nfield-gate, over which he lightly leapt as she stepped forward. There\r\nwas no evading it, he pressed her to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the first and last time!\xe2\x80\x99 she wildly thought as she stood\r\nencircled by his arms.\r\n\r\nHow Phyllis got through the terrible ordeal of that night she could\r\nnever clearly recollect. She always attributed her success in carrying\r\nout her resolve to her lover\xe2\x80\x99s honour, for as soon as she declared to\r\nhim in feeble words that she had changed her mind, and felt that she\r\ncould not, dared not, fly with him, he forbore to urge her, grieved as\r\nhe was at her decision. Unscrupulous pressure on his part, seeing how\r\nromantically she had become attached to him, would no doubt have turned\r\nthe balance in his favour. But he did nothing to tempt her unduly or\r\nunfairly.\r\n\r\nOn her side, fearing for his safety, she begged him to remain. This, he\r\ndeclared, could not be. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot break faith with my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\nHad he stood alone he would have abandoned his plan. But Christoph,\r\nwith the boat and compass and chart, was waiting on the shore; the tide\r\nwould soon turn; his mother had been warned of his coming; go he must.\r\n\r\nMany precious minutes were lost while he tarried, unable to tear\r\nhimself away. Phyllis held to her resolve, though it cost her many a\r\nbitter pang. At last they parted, and he went down the hill. Before his\r\nfootsteps had quite died away she felt a desire to behold at least his\r\noutline once more, and running noiselessly after him regained view of\r\nhis diminishing figure. For one moment she was sufficiently excited to\r\nbe on the point of rushing forward and linking her fate with his. But\r\nshe could not. The courage which at the critical instant failed\r\nCleopatra of Egypt could scarcely be expected of Phyllis Grove.\r\n\r\nA dark shape, similar to his own, joined him in the highway. It was\r\nChristoph, his friend. She could see no more; they had hastened on in\r\nthe direction of the town and harbour, four miles ahead. With a feeling\r\nakin to despair she turned and slowly pursued her way homeward.\r\n\r\nTattoo sounded in the camp; but there was no camp for her now. It was\r\nas dead as the camp of the Assyrians after the passage of the\r\nDestroying Angel.\r\n\r\nShe noiselessly entered the house, seeing nobody, and went to bed.\r\nGrief, which kept her awake at first, ultimately wrapped her in a heavy\r\nsleep. The next morning her father met her at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Gould is come!\xe2\x80\x99 he said triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHumphrey was staying at the inn, and had already called to inquire for\r\nher. He had brought her a present of a very handsome looking-glass in a\r\nframe of _repouss\xc3\xa9_ silverwork, which her father held in his hand. He\r\nhad promised to call again in the course of an hour, to ask Phyllis to\r\nwalk with him.\r\n\r\nPretty mirrors were rarer in country-houses at that day than they are\r\nnow, and the one before her won Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s admiration. She looked into\r\nit, saw how heavy her eyes were, and endeavoured to brighten them. She\r\nwas in that wretched state of mind which leads a woman to move\r\nmechanically onward in what she conceives to be her allotted path. Mr.\r\nHumphrey had, in his undemonstrative way, been adhering all along to\r\nthe old understanding; it was for her to do the same, and to say not a\r\nword of her own lapse. She put on her bonnet and tippet, and when he\r\narrived at the hour named she was at the door awaiting him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPhyllis thanked him for his beautiful gift; but the talking was soon\r\nentirely on Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s side as they walked along. He told her of the\r\nlatest movements of the world of fashion\xe2\x80\x94a subject which she willingly\r\ndiscussed to the exclusion of anything more personal\xe2\x80\x94and his measured\r\nlanguage helped to still her disquieted heart and brain. Had not her\r\nown sadness been what it was she must have observed his embarrassment.\r\nAt last he abruptly changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you are pleased with my little present,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98The truth\r\nis that I brought it to propitiate \xe2\x80\x99ee, and to get you to help me out\r\nof a mighty difficulty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was inconceivable to Phyllis that this independent bachelor\xe2\x80\x94whom she\r\nadmired in some respects\xe2\x80\x94could have a difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Phyllis\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you my secret at once; for I have a monstrous secret\r\nto confide before I can ask your counsel. The case is, then, that I am\r\nmarried: yes, I have privately married a dear young belle; and if you\r\nknew her, and I hope you will, you would say everything in her praise.\r\nBut she is not quite the one that my father would have chose for me\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow the paternal idea as well as I\xe2\x80\x94and I have kept it secret. There\r\nwill be a terrible noise, no doubt; but I think that with your help I\r\nmay get over it. If you would only do me this good turn\xe2\x80\x94when I have\r\ntold my father, I mean\xe2\x80\x94say that you never could have married me, you\r\nknow, or something of that sort\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99pon my life it will help to smooth the\r\nway vastly. I am so anxious to win him round to my point of view, and\r\nnot to cause any estrangement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat Phyllis replied she scarcely knew, or how she counselled him as to\r\nhis unexpected situation. Yet the relief that his announcement brought\r\nher was perceptible. To have confided her trouble in return was what\r\nher aching heart longed to do; and had Humphrey been a woman she would\r\ninstantly have poured out her tale. But to him she feared to confess;\r\nand there was a real reason for silence, till a sufficient time had\r\nelapsed to allow her lover and his comrade to get out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she reached home again she sought a solitary place, and\r\nspent the time in half regretting that she had not gone away, and in\r\ndreaming over the meetings with Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina from their beginning to\r\ntheir end. In his own country, amongst his own countrywomen, he would\r\npossibly soon forget her, even to her very name.\r\n\r\nHer listlessness was such that she did not go out of the house for\r\nseveral days. There came a morning which broke in fog and mist, behind\r\nwhich the dawn could be discerned in greenish grey; and the outlines of\r\nthe tents, and the rows of horses at the ropes. The smoke from the\r\ncanteen fires drooped heavily.\r\n\r\nThe spot at the bottom of the garden where she had been accustomed to\r\nclimb the wall to meet Matth\xc3\xa4us, was the only inch of English ground in\r\nwhich she took any interest; and in spite of the disagreeable haze\r\nprevailing she walked out there till she reached the well-known corner.\r\nEvery blade of grass was weighted with little liquid globes, and slugs\r\nand snails had crept out upon the plots. She could hear the usual faint\r\nnoises from the camp, and in the other direction the trot of farmers on\r\nthe road to the town, for it was market-day. She observed that her\r\nfrequent visits to this corner had quite trodden down the grass in the\r\nangle of the wall, and left marks of garden soil on the stepping-stones\r\nby which she had mounted to look over the top. Seldom having gone there\r\ntill dusk, she had not considered that her traces might be visible by\r\nday. Perhaps it was these which had revealed her trysts to her father.\r\n\r\nWhile she paused in melancholy regard, she fancied that the customary\r\nsounds from the tents were changing their character. Indifferent as\r\nPhyllis was to camp doings now, she mounted by the steps to the old\r\nplace. What she beheld at first awed and perplexed her; then she stood\r\nrigid, her fingers hooked to the wall, her eyes staring out of her\r\nhead, and her face as if hardened to stone.\r\n\r\nOn the open green stretching before her all the regiments in the camp\r\nwere drawn up in line, in the mid-front of which two empty coffins lay\r\non the ground. The unwonted sounds which she had noticed came from an\r\nadvancing procession. It consisted of the band of the York Hussars\r\nplaying a dead march; next two soldiers of that regiment in a mourning\r\ncoach, guarded on each side, and accompanied by two priests. Behind\r\ncame a crowd of rustics who had been attracted by the event. The\r\nmelancholy procession marched along the front of the line, returned to\r\nthe centre, and halted beside the coffins, where the two condemned men\r\nwere blindfolded, and each placed kneeling on his coffin; a few minutes\r\npause was now given, while they prayed.\r\n\r\nA firing-party of twenty-four men stood ready with levelled carbines.\r\nThe commanding officer, who had his sword drawn, waved it through some\r\ncuts of the sword-exercise till he reached the downward stroke, whereat\r\nthe firing-party discharged their volley. The two victims fell, one\r\nupon his face across his coffin, the other backwards.\r\n\r\nAs the volley resounded there arose a shriek from the wall of Dr.\r\nGrove\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and some one fell down inside; but nobody among the\r\nspectators without noticed it at the time. The two executed Hussars\r\nwere Matth\xc3\xa4us Tina and his friend Christoph. The soldiers on guard\r\nplaced the bodies in the coffins almost instantly; but the colonel of\r\nthe regiment, an Englishman, rode up and exclaimed in a stern voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Turn them out\xe2\x80\x94as an example to the men!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe coffins were lifted endwise, and the dead Germans flung out upon\r\ntheir faces on the grass. Then all the regiments wheeled in sections,\r\nand marched past the spot in slow time. When the survey was over the\r\ncorpses were again coffined, and borne away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Grove, attracted by the noise of the volley, had rushed\r\nout into his garden, where he saw his wretched daughter lying\r\nmotionless against the wall. She was taken indoors, but it was long\r\nbefore she recovered consciousness; and for weeks they despaired of her\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIt transpired that the luckless deserters from the York Hussars had cut\r\nthe boat from her moorings in the adjacent harbour, according to their\r\nplan, and, with two other comrades who were smarting under\r\nill-treatment from their colonel, had sailed in safety across the\r\nChannel. But mistaking their bearings they steered into Jersey,\r\nthinking that island the French coast. Here they were perceived to be\r\ndeserters, and delivered up to the authorities. Matth\xc3\xa4us and Christoph\r\ninterceded for the other two at the court-martial, saying that it was\r\nentirely by the former\xe2\x80\x99s representations that these were induced to go.\r\nTheir sentence was accordingly commuted to flogging, the death\r\npunishment being reserved for their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to the well-known old Georgian watering-place, who may care\r\nto ramble to the neighbouring village under the hills, and examine the\r\nregister of burials, will there find two entries in these words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Matth:\xe2\x80\x94Tina (Corpl.) in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Regmt. of York Hussars, and Shot\r\nfor Desertion, was Buried June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years. Born in the\r\ntown of Sarrbruk, Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Christoph Bless, belonging to His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Regmt. of York Hussars,\r\nwho was Shot for Desertion, was Buried June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years.\r\nBorn at Lothaargen, Alsatia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir graves were dug at the back of the little church, near the wall.\r\nThere is no memorial to mark the spot, but Phyllis pointed it out to\r\nme. While she lived she used to keep their mounds neat; but now they\r\nare overgrown with nettles, and sunk nearly flat. The older villagers,\r\nhowever, who know of the episode from their parents, still recollect\r\nthe place where the soldiers lie. Phyllis lies near.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIDDLER OF THE REELS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Talking of Exhibitions, World\xe2\x80\x99s Fairs, and what not,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old\r\ngentleman, \xe2\x80\x98I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\r\nnowadays. The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\r\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent\r\nof them all, and now a thing of old times\xe2\x80\x94the Great Exhibition of 1851,\r\nin Hyde Park, London. None of the younger generation can realize the\r\nsense of novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime. A noun\r\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\r\noccasion. It was \xe2\x80\x9cexhibition\xe2\x80\x9d hat, \xe2\x80\x9cexhibition\xe2\x80\x9d razor-strop,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexhibition\xe2\x80\x9d watch; nay, even \xe2\x80\x9cexhibition\xe2\x80\x9d weather, \xe2\x80\x9cexhibition\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nspirits, sweethearts, babies, wives\xe2\x80\x94for the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\r\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what\r\none might call a precipice in Time. As in a geological \xe2\x80\x9cfault,\xe2\x80\x9d we had\r\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\r\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest\r\nwas ever witnessed in this part of the country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\r\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\r\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\r\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\r\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\r\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon. First in\r\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor\xe2\x80\x94if that were his real\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94whom the seniors in our party had known well.\r\n\r\nHe was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s man, they said,\xe2\x80\x94supremely so\xe2\x80\x94externally little else.\r\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\r\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\r\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\r\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\r\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\r\n\r\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\r\nmaidenhood\xe2\x80\x94a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\r\nand wizardly in it. Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather\r\nun-English, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and\r\nrather clammy\xe2\x80\x94made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he\r\ncame fresh to a party, caused him to smell like \xe2\x80\x98boys\xe2\x80\x99-love\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(southernwood) steeped in lamp-oil. On occasion he wore curls\xe2\x80\x94a double\r\nrow\xe2\x80\x94running almost horizontally around his head. But as these were\r\nsometimes noticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not\r\naltogether of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s making. By girls whose love for him had turned\r\nto hatred he had been nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98Mop,\xe2\x80\x99 from this abundance of hair,\r\nwhich was long enough to rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the\r\nname more and more prevailed.\r\n\r\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\r\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\r\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher. There\r\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\r\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between \xe2\x80\x98Mop\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand the career of a second Paganini.\r\n\r\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\r\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\r\npassages ever heard by rustic man. There was a certain lingual\r\ncharacter in the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well\r\nnigh have drawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post. He could make\r\nany child in the parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into\r\ntears in a few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he\r\nalmost entirely affected\xe2\x80\x94country jigs, reels, and \xe2\x80\x98Favourite Quick\r\nSteps\xe2\x80\x99 of the last century\xe2\x80\x94some mutilated remains of which even now\r\nreappear as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they\r\nare recognized only by the curious, or by such old-fashioned and\r\nfar-between people as have been thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in\r\ntheir early life.\r\n\r\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\r\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he did not rise\r\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\r\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries. In their honest love of\r\nthoroughness they despised the new man\xe2\x80\x99s style. Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\r\nthe tranter\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother) used to say there was no \xe2\x80\x98plumness\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94no bowing, no solidity\xe2\x80\x94it was all fantastical. And probably this was\r\ntrue. Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of\r\nchurch-music from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of\r\nMellstock church where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so\r\nmany hundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church\r\nat all. All were devil\xe2\x80\x99s tunes in his repertory. \xe2\x80\x98He could no more play\r\nthe Wold Hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen\r\nserpent,\xe2\x80\x99 the tranter would say. (The brazen serpent was supposed in\r\nMellstock to be a musical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\r\n\r\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the\r\nsouls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and\r\nresponsive organization. Such an one was Car\xe2\x80\x99line Aspent. Though she\r\nwas already engaged to be married before she met him, Car\xe2\x80\x99line, of them\r\nall, was the most influenced by Mop Ollamoor\xe2\x80\x99s heart-stealing melodies,\r\nto her discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury. She was a\r\npretty, invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a\r\ncompanion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then. At\r\nthis time she was not a resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged,\r\nbut lived some miles off at Stickleford, farther down the river.\r\n\r\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\r\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was\r\ndeveloped on one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower\r\nMellstock, she chanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest\r\nherself, and languidly leaned over the parapet. Mop was standing on his\r\ndoor-step, as was his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi-\r\nand demi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit\r\nof passers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\r\nlittle children hanging around him. Car\xe2\x80\x99line pretended to be engrossed\r\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she\r\nwas listening, as he knew. Presently the aching of the heart seized her\r\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\r\ninfinite dance. To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\r\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played. On stealthily\r\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\r\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on\r\nboldly. But when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself\r\nmore and more accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very\r\nnearly danced along. Gaining another glance at him when immediately\r\nopposite, she saw that _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he\r\nsmiled at her emotional state. Her gait could not divest itself of its\r\ncompelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house; and\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\r\n\r\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance\r\nto which she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be\r\nthe musician, Car\xe2\x80\x99line contrived to be present, though it sometimes\r\ninvolved a walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in\r\nStickleford as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and\r\nit would require a neurologist to fully explain them. She would be\r\nsitting quietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father,\r\nthe parish clerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village\r\nstreet, this being the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford,\r\nfive miles eastward. Here, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s warning, and in the midst\r\nof a general conversation between her father, sister, and the young man\r\nbefore alluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her\r\ninfatuation, she would start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if\r\nshe had received a galvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the\r\nceiling; then she would burst into tears, and it was not till some\r\nhalf-hour had passed that she grew calm as usual. Her father, knowing\r\nher hysterical tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this\r\ntrait in his youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of\r\nepileptic fit. Not so her sister Julia. Julia had found out what was\r\nthe cause. At the moment before the jumping, only an exceptionally\r\nsensitive ear situated in the chimney-nook could have caught from down\r\nthe flue the beat of a man\xe2\x80\x99s footstep along the highway without. But it\r\nwas in that footfall, for which she had been waiting, that the origin\r\nof Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x99s involuntary springing lay. The pedestrian was Mop\r\nOllamoor, as the girl well knew; but his business that way was not to\r\nvisit her; he sought another woman whom he spoke of as his Intended,\r\nand who lived at Moreford, two miles farther on. On one, and only one,\r\noccasion did it happen that Car\xe2\x80\x99line could not control her utterance;\r\nit was when her sister alone chanced to be present. \xe2\x80\x98Oh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s going to _her_, and not coming to _me_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\r\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould. But he had soon\r\nfound out her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her\r\ntoo easily hurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious\r\nperformances at Moreford. The two became well acquainted, though only\r\nby stealth, hardly a soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her\r\nlover Ned Hipcroft, being aware of the attachment. Her father\r\ndisapproved of her coldness to Ned; her sister, too, hoped she might\r\nget over this nervous passion for a man of whom so little was known.\r\nThe ultimate result was that Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x99s manly and simple wooer Edward\r\nfound his suit becoming practically hopeless. He was a respectable\r\nmechanic, in a far sounder position than Mop the nominal horse-doctor;\r\nbut when, before leaving her, Ned put his flat and final question,\r\nwould she marry him, then and there, now or never, it was with little\r\nexpectation of obtaining more than the negative she gave him. Though\r\nher father supported him and her sister supported him, he could not\r\nplay the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your body like a\r\nspider\xe2\x80\x99s thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-wind and\r\nyearned for something to cling to. Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\r\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less\r\nplay them.\r\n\r\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\r\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life. It had been uttered in\r\nsuch a tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more;\r\nshe should not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\r\nperspective of the street and lane. He left the place, and his natural\r\ncourse was to London.\r\n\r\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\r\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a\r\nsix days\xe2\x80\x99 trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him. He\r\nwas one of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct\r\nmethod of travel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from\r\ntime immemorial.\r\n\r\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade. More fortunate\r\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the\r\nfirst. During the ensuing four years he was never out of employment. He\r\nneither advanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a\r\nworkman, but he did not shift one jot in social position. About his\r\nlove for Car\xe2\x80\x99line he maintained a rigid silence. No doubt he often\r\nthought of her; but being always occupied, and having no relations at\r\nStickleford, he held no communication with that part of the country,\r\nand showed no desire to return. In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he\r\nmoved about after working-hours with the facility of a woman, doing his\r\nown cooking, attending to his stocking-heels, and shaping himself by\r\ndegrees to a life-long bachelorhood. For this conduct one is bound to\r\nadvance the canonical reason that time could not efface from his heart\r\nthe image of little Car\xe2\x80\x99line Aspent\xe2\x80\x94and it may be in part true; but\r\nthere was also the inference that his was a nature not greatly\r\ndependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\r\n\r\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year\r\nof the Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction\r\nof this huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world\xe2\x80\x99s history, he\r\nworked daily. It was an era of great hope and activity among the\r\nnations and industries. Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a\r\ncentral man in the movement, he plodded on with his usual outward\r\nplacidity. Yet for him, too, the year was destined to have its\r\nsurprises, for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the\r\nopening day was past, the ceremonies had been witnessed, and people\r\nwere flocking thither from all parts of the globe, he received a letter\r\nfrom Car\xe2\x80\x99line. Till that day the silence of four years between himself\r\nand Stickleford had never been broken.\r\n\r\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested\r\na trembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining\r\nhis address, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to\r\nwrite. Four years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she\r\nwas capable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him. Her wilful\r\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\r\nparticularly. As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\r\nNed\xe2\x80\x94she did not know where. She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\r\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend.\r\n\r\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft\xe2\x80\x99s frame on\r\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue. Unquestionably he\r\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\r\nThis from his Car\xe2\x80\x99line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\r\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying\r\nthing. Ned had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot,\r\nthat he probably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.\r\nStill, a certain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise,\r\nrevealed how deeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.\r\nMeasured and methodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that\r\nday, nor the next, nor the next. He was having \xe2\x80\x98a good think.\xe2\x80\x99 When he\r\ndid answer it, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with\r\nthe unmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\r\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\r\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\r\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\r\n\r\nHe told her\xe2\x80\x94and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\r\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his\r\nsentences\xe2\x80\x94that it was all very well for her to come round at this time\r\nof day. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she have him when he wanted her? She had no doubt\r\nlearned that he was not married, but suppose his affections had since\r\nbeen fixed on another? She ought to beg his pardon. Still, he was not\r\nthe man to forget her. But considering how he had been used, and what\r\nhe had suffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to\r\nStickleford and fetch her. But if she would come to him, and say she\r\nwas sorry, as was only fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what\r\na good little woman she was at the core. He added that the request for\r\nher to come to him was a less one to make than it would have been when\r\nhe first left Stickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new\r\nrailway into South Wessex was now open, and there had just begun to be\r\nrun wonderfully contrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on\r\naccount of the Great Exhibition; so that she could come up easily\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so\r\ngenerously, after her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she\r\nfelt frightened at the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet\r\nin a railway-train, having only seen one pass at a distance, she\r\nembraced his offer with all her heart; and would, indeed, own to him\r\nhow sorry she was, and beg his pardon, and try to be a good wife\r\nalways, and make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car\xe2\x80\x99line\r\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she\r\nwould be wearing \xe2\x80\x98my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,\xe2\x80\x99 and Ned gaily\r\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\r\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition. One early\r\nsummer afternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and\r\nhastened towards Waterloo Station to meet her. It was as wet and chilly\r\nas an English June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the\r\nplatform in the drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have\r\nsomething to live for again.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98excursion-train\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an absolutely new departure in the history of\r\ntravel\xe2\x80\x94was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\r\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to\r\nwitness the unwonted sight of so long a train\xe2\x80\x99s passage, even where\r\nthey did not take advantage of the opportunity it offered. The seats\r\nfor the humbler class of travellers in these early experiments in\r\nsteam-locomotion, were open trucks, without any protection whatever\r\nfrom the wind and rain; and damp weather having set in with the\r\nafternoon, the unfortunate occupants of these vehicles were, on the\r\ntrain drawing up at the London terminus, found to be in a pitiable\r\ncondition from their long journey; blue-faced, stiff-necked, sneezing,\r\nrain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the men being hatless; in\r\nfact, they resembled people who had been out all night in an open boat\r\non a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists for pleasure. The\r\nwomen had in some degree protected themselves by turning up the skirts\r\nof their gowns over their heads, but as by this arrangement they were\r\nadditionally exposed about the hips, they were all more or less in a\r\nsorry plight.\r\n\r\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\r\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\r\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\r\nsprigged lilac, as described. She came up to him with a frightened\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\r\nlong exposure to the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Ned!\xe2\x80\x99 she sputtered, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 He clasped her in his arms and kissed\r\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are wet, my poor dear! I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll not get cold,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. And\r\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed\r\nthat by the hand she led a toddling child\xe2\x80\x94a little girl of three or\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94whose hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the\r\nother travellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is this\xe2\x80\x94somebody you know?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Ned curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Ned. She\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94my own!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your own child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well\xe2\x80\x94as God\xe2\x80\x99s in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ned, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have\r\nbeen so hard to explain! I thought that when we met I could tell you\r\nhow she happened to be born, so much better than in writing! I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nso many, many miles!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!\xe2\x80\x99 said Hipcroft, gazing palely\r\nat them from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line gasped. \xe2\x80\x98But he\xe2\x80\x99s been gone away for years!\xe2\x80\x99 she supplicated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I never had a young man before! And I was so onlucky to be catched\r\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like\r\nanything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me, dear Ned?\xe2\x80\x99 she added, beginning to sob outright. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t taken \xe2\x80\x99ee in after all, because\xe2\x80\x94because you can pack us back\r\nagain, if you want to; though \xe2\x80\x99tis hundreds o\xe2\x80\x99 miles, and so wet, and\r\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What the devil can I do!\xe2\x80\x99 Hipcroft groaned.\r\n\r\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented\r\nwas never seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt,\r\npuddled platform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them\r\nnow and then; the pretty attire in which they had started from\r\nStickleford in the early morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on\r\ntheir faces, and fear of him in their eyes; for the child began to look\r\nas if she thought she too had done some wrong, remaining in an appalled\r\nsilence till the tears rolled down her chubby cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my little maid?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ned mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do want to go home!\xe2\x80\x99 she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\r\nheart. \xe2\x80\x98And my totties be cold, an\xe2\x80\x99 I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have no bread an\xe2\x80\x99 butter\r\nno more!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say to it all!\xe2\x80\x99 declared Ned, his own eye moist\r\nas he turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded\r\nthem again point blank. From the child escaped troubled breaths and\r\nsilently welling tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Want some bread and butter, do \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with factitious\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye-e-s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I daresay I can get \xe2\x80\x99ee a bit! Naturally, you must want some.\r\nAnd you, too, for that matter, Car\xe2\x80\x99line.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do feel a little hungered. But I can keep it off,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gruffly. . . . \xe2\x80\x98There come along!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncaught up the child, as he added, \xe2\x80\x98You must bide here to-night, anyhow,\r\nI s\xe2\x80\x99pose! What can you do otherwise? I\xe2\x80\x99ll get \xe2\x80\x99ee some tea and\r\nvictuals; and as for this job, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say! This\r\nis the way out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, which were\r\nnot far off. There he dried them and made them comfortable, and\r\nprepared tea; they thankfully sat down. The ready-made household of\r\nwhich he suddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his\r\nroom, and a paternal one to himself. Presently he turned to the child\r\nand kissed her now blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car\xe2\x80\x99line,\r\nkissed her also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can send \xe2\x80\x99ee back all them miles,\xe2\x80\x99 he growled, \xe2\x80\x98now\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve come all the way o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to join me. But you must trust me,\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line, and show you\xe2\x80\x99ve real faith in me. Well, do you feel better\r\nnow, my little woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\r\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of\r\ntheir marriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could\r\nbe, on account of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the\r\nExhibition when they came back from church, as he had promised. While\r\nstanding near a large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture,\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line started, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form\r\nexactly resembling Mop Ollamoor\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94so exactly, that it seemed impossible\r\nto believe anybody but that artist in person to be the original. On\r\npassing round the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from\r\na direct view, no Mop was to be seen. Whether he were really in London\r\nor not at that time was never known; and Car\xe2\x80\x99line always stoutly denied\r\nthat her readiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour\r\nthat Mop had also gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable\r\nground for doubting.\r\n\r\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\r\nbecame a thing of the past. The park trees that had been enclosed for\r\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\r\ngreen anew. Ned found that Car\xe2\x80\x99line resolved herself into a very good\r\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\r\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap\r\ntea-pot, which often brews better tea than a dear one. One autumn\r\nHipcroft found himself with but little work to do, and a prospect of\r\nless for the winter. Both being country born and bred, they fancied\r\nthey would like to live again in their natural atmosphere. It was\r\naccordingly decided between them that they should leave the pent-up\r\nLondon lodging, and that Ned should seek out employment near his native\r\nplace, his wife and her daughter staying with Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x99s father during\r\nthe search for occupation and an abode of their own.\r\n\r\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x99s spasmodic little frame as she\r\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\r\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud. To return to where she had once\r\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was\r\na triumph which the world did not witness every day.\r\n\r\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest\r\nto Stickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge. Ned thought it a\r\ngood opportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\r\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\r\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a\r\nmoon on the point of rising, Car\xe2\x80\x99line and her little girl walked on\r\ntoward Stickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick\r\nher up at a certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\r\n\r\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\r\nthough they were both becoming wearied. In the course of three miles\r\nthey had passed Heedless-William\xe2\x80\x99s Pond, the familiar landmark by\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s End, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside\r\nhostel on the lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years\r\nabolished. In stepping up towards it Car\xe2\x80\x99line heard more voices within\r\nthan had formerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that\r\nan auction of fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon. The\r\nchild would be the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought,\r\nand she entered.\r\n\r\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car\xe2\x80\x99line had\r\nno sooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight\r\ncame forward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning\r\nagainst the wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink\r\nof the liquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful\r\nand saying, in a moment or two: \xe2\x80\x98Surely, \xe2\x80\x99tis little Car\xe2\x80\x99line Aspent\r\nthat was\xe2\x80\x94down at Stickleford?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\r\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come\r\nin farther and sit down. Once within the room she found that all the\r\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\r\nchair vacant she did the same. An explanation of their position\r\noccurred the next moment. In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining\r\nhis bow and looking just the same as ever. The company had cleared the\r\nmiddle of the room for dancing, and they were about to dance again. As\r\nshe wore a veil to keep off the wind she did not think he had\r\nrecognized her, or could possibly guess the identity of the child; and\r\nto her satisfied surprise she found that she could confront him quite\r\ncalmly\xe2\x80\x94mistress of herself in the dignity her London life had given\r\nher. Before she had quite emptied her glass the dance was called, the\r\ndancers formed in two lines, the music sounded, and the figure began.\r\n\r\nThen matters changed for Car\xe2\x80\x99line. A tremor quickened itself to life in\r\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass. It\r\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin\r\nwhich thrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery\r\nthat she had so well known of yore, and under which she had used to\r\nlose her power of independent will. How it all came back! There was the\r\nfiddling figure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of\r\nhim, and beneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\r\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously. Then a\r\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away,\r\nstretched out his hand and beckoned to her to take the place. She did\r\nnot want to dance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but\r\nshe was entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the\r\ndancing man. The saltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning\r\ninstrument had ever been able to start in her was seizing Car\xe2\x80\x99line just\r\nas it had done in earlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer\r\nhot. Tired as she was she grasped her little girl by the hand, and\r\nplunging in at the bottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.\r\nShe found that her companions were mostly people of the neighbouring\r\nhamlets and farms\xe2\x80\x94Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and\r\nby degrees she was recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing\r\nthat Mop would cease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused,\r\nand her feet also.\r\n\r\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\r\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very\r\nweak and overpowered with hysteric emotion. She refrained from\r\nunveiling, to keep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.\r\nSeveral of the guests having left, Car\xe2\x80\x99line hastily wiped her lips and\r\nalso turned to go; but, according to the account of some who remained,\r\nat that very moment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or\r\nthree begged her to join.\r\n\r\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\r\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling \xe2\x80\x98My Fancy-Lad,\xe2\x80\x99 in D\r\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed. He must have\r\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of\r\nall seductive strains which she was least able to resist\xe2\x80\x94the one he had\r\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\r\nacquaintance. Car\xe2\x80\x99line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\r\nwith the other four.\r\n\r\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\r\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\r\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust. As everybody knows,\r\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the\r\nreel being performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\r\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\r\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the\r\nfirst part without giving her opportunity. And now she began to suspect\r\nthat Mop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever\r\nshe stole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\r\neverything outside his own brain. She continued to wend her way through\r\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\r\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in\r\none too highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in\r\nendless variation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a\r\nsort of blissful torture. The room swam, the tune was endless; and in\r\nabout a quarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped\r\nout exhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\r\n\r\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one. Car\xe2\x80\x99line\r\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she\r\nhad, no power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten\r\nminutes slipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor\r\nbeing of stone, sanded. Then another dancer fell out\xe2\x80\x94one of the men\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwent into the passage, in a frantic search for liquor. To turn the\r\nfigure into a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop\r\nmodulating at the same time into \xe2\x80\x98The Fairy Dance,\xe2\x80\x99 as better suited to\r\nthe contracted movement, and no less one of those foods of love which,\r\nas manufactured by his bow, had always intoxicated her.\r\n\r\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five\r\nminutes were enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly\r\nblown, stamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into\r\nthe next room to get something to drink. Car\xe2\x80\x99line, half-stifled inside\r\nher veil, was left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of\r\neverybody save herself, Mop, and their little girl.\r\n\r\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him\r\nto withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere. Mop\r\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\r\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\r\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\r\nnoisy dance. Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\r\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as\r\nif it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever\r\nsince its banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape\r\nand sound. There was that in the look of Mop\xe2\x80\x99s one dark eye which said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!\xe2\x80\x99 and it bred in\r\nher a paroxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\r\n\r\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in\r\ntruth slavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and\r\nprobed by the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator\xe2\x80\x99s open eye; keeping up\r\nat the same time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it\r\nwas still her own pleasure which led her on. A terrified embarrassment\r\nas to what she could say to him if she were to leave off, had its\r\nunrecognized share in keeping her going. The child, who was beginning\r\nto be distressed by the strange situation, came up and said: \xe2\x80\x98Stop,\r\nmother, stop, and let\xe2\x80\x99s go home!\xe2\x80\x99 as she seized Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Car\xe2\x80\x99line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\r\nface, prone she remained. Mop\xe2\x80\x99s fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin\r\nshriek of finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon\r\nbeer-cask which had formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who\r\ndisconsolately bent over her mother.\r\n\r\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of\r\nair, hearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\r\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car\xe2\x80\x99line by blowing her with the\r\nbellows and opening the window. Ned, her husband, who had been detained\r\nin Casterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture,\r\nand hearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\r\nsurprise, the mention of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name, he entered amid the rest upon\r\nthe scene. Car\xe2\x80\x99line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for\r\na long time nothing could be done with her. While he was sending for a\r\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how\r\nit had all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler\r\nformerly known in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and\r\nhad taken upon himself without invitation to play that evening at the\r\ninn.\r\n\r\nNed demanded the fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s name, and they said Ollamoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Ned, looking round him. \xe2\x80\x98Where is he, and where\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy little girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child. Hipcroft was in\r\nordinary a quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to\r\nbe feared settled in his face now. \xe2\x80\x98Blast him!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat\r\nhis skull in for\xe2\x80\x99n, if I swing for it to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down\r\nthe passage, the people following. Outside the house, on the other side\r\nof the highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its\r\nnot easily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into\r\nthe sky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of\r\nMistover backed by the Yalbury coppices\xe2\x80\x94a place of Dantesque gloom at\r\nthis hour, which would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of\r\nartillery, much less a man and a child.\r\n\r\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\r\nroad. They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\r\nresult to the inn. Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well\xe2\x80\x94what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he\r\nthinks the child his, as a\xe2\x80\x99 do seem to!\xe2\x80\x99 they whispered. \xe2\x80\x98And everybody\r\nelse knowing otherwise!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x99tis mine!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\r\nhis hands. \xe2\x80\x98But she is mine, all the same! Ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I nussed her? Ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI fed her and teached her? Ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I played wi\xe2\x80\x99 her? O, little\r\nCarry\xe2\x80\x94gone with that rogue\xe2\x80\x94gone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t lost your mis\xe2\x80\x99ess, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 they said to console him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s throwed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore to \xe2\x80\x99ee than a child that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She isn\xe2\x80\x99t! She\xe2\x80\x99s not so particular much to me, especially now she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlost the little maid! But Carry\xe2\x80\x99s everything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, ver\xe2\x80\x99 like you\xe2\x80\x99ll find her to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94but shall I? Yet he _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ hurt her\xe2\x80\x94surely he can\xe2\x80\x99t! Well\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line now? I am ready. Is the cart here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\r\nStickleford. Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\r\nand her will seemed shattered. For the child she appeared to show\r\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted. It was\r\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\r\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\r\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\r\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\r\nCar\xe2\x80\x99line herself. Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\r\neither to the fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts or the girl\xe2\x80\x99s; and how he could\r\nhave induced her to go with him remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\r\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\r\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\r\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\r\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\r\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\r\nbefore returning thither.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\r\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\r\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nrascal\xe2\x80\x99s torturing her to maintain him!\xe2\x80\x99 To which his wife would answer\r\npeevishly, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee raft yourself so, Ned! You prevent my getting a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 rest! He won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her!\xe2\x80\x99 and fall asleep again.\r\n\r\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\r\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\r\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer. There,\r\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\r\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\r\nfour-and-forty.\r\n\r\nMay 1893,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRADITION OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widely discussed possibility of an invasion of England through a\r\nChannel tunnel has more than once recalled old Solomon Selby\xe2\x80\x99s story to\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nThe occasion on which I numbered myself among his audience was one\r\nevening when he was sitting in the yawning chimney-corner of the\r\ninn-kitchen, with some others who had gathered there, and I entered for\r\nshelter from the rain. Withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental\r\nnotch in which it habitually rested, he leaned back in the recess\r\nbehind him and smiled into the fire. The smile was neither mirthful nor\r\nsad, not precisely humorous nor altogether thoughtful. We who knew him\r\nrecognized it in a moment: it was his narrative smile. Breaking off our\r\nfew desultory remarks we drew up closer, and he thus began:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his life, and lived out\r\nby the Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise,\r\ntill I moved here shortly afore I was married. The cottage that first\r\nknew me stood on the top of the down, near the sea; there was no house\r\nwithin a mile and a half of it; it was built o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for the\r\nfarm-shepherd, and had no other use. They tell me that it is now pulled\r\ndown, but that you can see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a\r\nfew broken bricks that are still lying about. It was a bleak and dreary\r\nplace in winter-time, but in summer it was well enough, though the\r\ngarden never came to much, because we could not get up a good shelter\r\nfor the vegetables and currant bushes; and where there is much wind\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t thrive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my\r\nmind were eighteen hundred and three, four, and five. This was for two\r\nreasons: I had just then grown to an age when a child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and ears\r\ntake in and note down everything about him, and there was more at that\r\ndate to bear in mind than there ever has been since with me. It was, as\r\nI need hardly tell ye, the time after the first peace, when Bonaparte\r\nwas scheming his descent upon England. He had crossed the great Alp\r\nmountains, fought in Egypt, drubbed the Turks, the Austrians, and the\r\nProossians, and now thought he\xe2\x80\x99d have a slap at us. On the other side\r\nof the Channel, scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our\r\nEnglish shore, the French army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and\r\nfifteen thousand horses had been brought together from all parts, and\r\nwere drilling every day. Bonaparte had been three years a-making his\r\npreparations; and to ferry these soldiers and cannon and horses across\r\nhe had contrived a couple of thousand flat-bottomed boats. These boats\r\nwere small things, but wonderfully built. A good few of \xe2\x80\x99em were so\r\nmade as to have a little stable on board each for the two horses that\r\nwere to haul the cannon carried at the stern. To get in order all\r\nthese, and other things required, he had assembled there five or six\r\nthousand fellows that worked at trades\xe2\x80\x94carpenters, blacksmiths,\r\nwheelwrights, saddlers, and what not. O \xe2\x80\x99twas a curious time!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his multitude of soldiers\r\non the beach, draw \xe2\x80\x99em up in line, practise \xe2\x80\x99em in the manoeuvre of\r\nembarking, horses and all, till they could do it without a single\r\nhitch. My father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as\r\nhe went along the drover\xe2\x80\x99s track over the high downs thereabout he\r\ncould see this drilling actually going on\xe2\x80\x94the accoutrements of the rank\r\nand file glittering in the sun like silver. It was thought and always\r\nsaid by my uncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about\r\nthese matters), that Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm\r\nnight. The grand query with us was, Where would my gentleman land? Many\r\nof the common people thought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how\r\nunlikely it was that any skilful general would make a business of\r\nlanding just where he was expected, said he\xe2\x80\x99d go either east into the\r\nRiver Thames, or west\xe2\x80\x99ard to some convenient place, most likely one of\r\nthe little bays inside the Isle of Portland, between the Beal and St.\r\nAlban\xe2\x80\x99s Head\xe2\x80\x94and for choice the three-quarter-round Cove, screened from\r\nevery mortal eye, that seemed made o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose, out by where we lived,\r\nand which I\xe2\x80\x99ve climmed up with two tubs of brandy across my shoulders\r\non scores o\xe2\x80\x99 dark nights in my younger days. Some had heard that a part\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the French fleet would sail right round Scotland, and come up the\r\nChannel to a suitable haven. However, there was much doubt upon the\r\nmatter; and no wonder, for after-years proved that Bonaparte himself\r\ncould hardly make up his mind upon that great and very particular\r\npoint, where to land. His uncertainty came about in this wise, that he\r\ncould get no news as to where and how our troops lay in waiting, and\r\nthat his knowledge of possible places where flat-bottomed boats might\r\nbe quietly run ashore, and the men they brought marshalled in order,\r\nwas dim to the last degree. Being flat-bottomed, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t require a\r\nharbour for unshipping their cargo of men, but a good shelving beach\r\naway from sight, and with a fair open road toward London. How the\r\nquestion posed that great Corsican tyrant (as we used to call him),\r\nwhat pains he took to settle it, and, above all, what a risk he ran on\r\none particular night in trying to do so, were known only to one man\r\nhere and there; and certainly to no maker of newspapers or printer of\r\nbooks, or my account o\xe2\x80\x99t would not have had so many heads shaken over\r\nit as it has by gentry who only believe what they see in printed lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our\r\nhouse, overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles. In winter and\r\nearly spring father was up a deal at nights, watching and tending the\r\nlambing. Often he\xe2\x80\x99d go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and\r\non the other hand, he\xe2\x80\x99d sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then\r\nturn in to bed. As soon as I was old enough I used to help him, mostly\r\nin the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to\r\nrest. This is what I was doing in a particular month in either the year\r\nfour or five\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t certainly fix which, but it was long before I was\r\ntook away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade. Every\r\nnight at that time I was at the fold, about half a mile, or it may be a\r\nlittle more, from our cottage, and no living thing at all with me but\r\nthe ewes and young lambs. Afeard? No; I was never afeard of being alone\r\nat these times; for I had been reared in such an out-step place that\r\nthe lack o\xe2\x80\x99 human beings at night made me less fearful than the sight\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em. Directly I saw a man\xe2\x80\x99s shape after dark in a lonely place I was\r\nfrightened out of my senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle Job,\r\nthe sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp on the downs above\r\nKing George\xe2\x80\x99s watering-place, several miles to the west yonder. Uncle\r\nJob dropped in about dusk, and went up with my father to the fold for\r\nan hour or two. Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of\r\nsperrits that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d made a run, and for burning \xe2\x80\x99em off when there was danger. After\r\nthat he stretched himself out on the settle to sleep. I went to bed: at\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock father came home, and waking me to go and take his place,\r\naccording to custom, went to bed himself. On my way out of the house I\r\npassed Uncle Job on the settle. He opened his eyes, and upon my telling\r\nhim where I was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as I\r\nshould go up there all alone; and when he had fastened up his stock and\r\nwaist-belt he set off along with me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub\r\nin a little flat bottle that stood in the corner-cupboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was right, and then, to\r\nkeep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the\r\nthatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when\r\nthere was any. To-night, however, there was none. It was one of those\r\nvery still nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within\r\ntwo or three miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the\r\ntide along the shore, coming and going every few moments like a sort of\r\ngreat snore of the sleeping world. Over the lower ground there was a\r\nbit of a mist, but on the hill where we lay the air was clear, and the\r\nmoon, then in her last quarter, flung a fairly good light on the grass\r\nand scattered straw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me strange stories\r\nof the wars he had served in and the wounds he had got. He had already\r\nfought the French in the Low Countries, and hoped to fight \xe2\x80\x99em again.\r\nHis stories lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was\r\nnot a soldier myself, and had seen such service as he told of. The\r\nwonders of his tales quite bewildered my mind, till I fell asleep and\r\ndreamed of battle, smoke, and flying soldiers, all of a kind with the\r\ndoings he had been bringing up to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say. But some faint sounds\r\nover and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw, the bleat of the\r\nlambs, and the tinkle of the sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.\r\nUncle Job was still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep. I looked\r\nout from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me. Two men,\r\nin boat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the hurdles about\r\ntwenty yards off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying, but though\r\nI heard every word o\xe2\x80\x99t, not one did I understand. They spoke in a\r\ntongue that was not ours\xe2\x80\x94in French, as I afterward found. But if I\r\ncould not gain the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find\r\nout a deal of the talkers\xe2\x80\x99 business. By the light o\xe2\x80\x99 the moon I could\r\nsee that one of \xe2\x80\x99em carried a roll of paper in his hand, while every\r\nmoment he spoke quick to his comrade, and pointed right and left with\r\nthe other hand to spots along the shore. There was no doubt that he was\r\nexplaining to the second gentleman the shapes and features of the\r\ncoast. What happened soon after made this still clearer to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I began to be afeared\r\nthat they might light upon us, because uncle breathed so heavily\r\nthrough\xe2\x80\x99s nose. I put my mouth to his ear and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, just as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been asleep at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo French generals\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFrench?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to see where to land their army!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I pointed \xe2\x80\x99em out; but I could say no more, for the pair were coming\r\nat that moment much nearer to where we lay. As soon as they got as near\r\nas eight or ten yards, the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down\r\nto a slanting hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out.\r\nThen suddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and showed it\r\nto be a map.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat be they looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered to Uncle Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA chart of the Channel,\xe2\x80\x9d says the sergeant (knowing about such\r\nthings).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over the map they\r\nhad a long consultation, as they pointed here and there on the paper,\r\nand then hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us. I\r\nnoticed that the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the\r\nother, who seemed much his superior, the second in rank calling him by\r\na sort of title that I did not know the sense of. The head one, on the\r\nother hand, was quite familiar with his friend, and more than once\r\nclapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map had been in the\r\nlantern-light, their faces had always been in shade. But when they rose\r\nfrom stooping over the chart the light flashed upward, and fell smart\r\nupon one of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s features. No sooner had this happened than Uncle Job\r\ngasped, and sank down as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been in a fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it\xe2\x80\x94what is it, Uncle Job?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO good God!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, under the straw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBoney!\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBonaparty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Corsican ogre. O that I had got but my\r\nnew-flinted firelock, that there man should die! But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got my\r\nnew-flinted firelock, and that there man must live. So lie low, as you\r\nvalue your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did lie low, as you mid suppose. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help peeping. And\r\nthen I too, lad as I was, knew that it was the face of Bonaparte. Not\r\nknow Boney? I should think I did know Boney. I should have known him by\r\nhalf the light o\xe2\x80\x99 that lantern. If I had seen a picture of his features\r\nonce, I had seen it a hundred times. There was his bullet head, his\r\nshort neck, his round yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his\r\ngreat glowing eyes. He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and\r\nthere was the forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the\r\ndraughts of him. In moving, his cloak fell a little open, and I could\r\nsee for a moment his white-fronted jacket and one of his epaulets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But none of this lasted long. In a minute he and his general had\r\nrolled up the map, shut the lantern, and turned to go down toward the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cSlipped across in the\r\nnight-time to see how to put his men ashore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe like o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat man\xe2\x80\x99s coolness eyes will never again see! Nephew, I must act in\r\nthis, and immediate, or England\xe2\x80\x99s lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went some little way\r\nto look after them. Half-way down they were joined by two others, and\r\nsix or seven minutes brought them to the shore. Then, from behind a\r\nrock, a boat came out into the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they\r\njumped in; it put off instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between\r\nthe two rocks that stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know. We\r\nclimmed back to where we had been before, and I could see, a little way\r\nout, a larger vessel, though still not very large. The little boat drew\r\nup alongside, was made fast at the stern as I suppose, for the largest\r\nsailed away, and we saw no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp; but\r\nwhat they thought of it I never heard\xe2\x80\x94neither did he. Boney\xe2\x80\x99s army\r\nnever came, and a good job for me; for the Cove below my father\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nwas where he meant to land, as this secret visit showed. We coast-folk\r\nshould have been cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here\r\nto tell this tale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar with his\r\nsimple grave-stone for these ten years past. Thanks to the incredulity\r\nof the age his tale has been seldom repeated. But if anything short of\r\nthe direct testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that\r\nBonaparte had examined these shores for himself with a view to a\r\npracticable landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby\xe2\x80\x99s manner of\r\nnarrating the adventure which befell him on the down.\r\n\r\n_Christmas_ 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW CRUSTED CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a Saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time, and the\r\nscene is the High Street of a well-known market-town. A large carrier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvan stands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon\r\nthe sides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten\r\nletters: \xe2\x80\x98Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.\xe2\x80\x99 These vans, so numerous\r\nhereabout, are a respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of\r\nconveyance, much resorted to by decent travellers not overstocked with\r\nmoney, the better among them roughly corresponding to the old French\r\n_diligences_.\r\n\r\nThe present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon\r\nprecisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret at\r\nthe top of the street. In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops\r\nbegin to arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and\r\nturn away whistling, and care for the packages no more. At twenty\r\nminutes to four an elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts,\r\nslowly mounts, takes up a seat inside, and folds her hands and her\r\nlips. She has secured her corner for the journey, though there is as\r\nyet no sign of a horse being put in, nor of a carrier. At the\r\nthree-quarters, two other women arrive, in whom the first recognizes\r\nthe postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the registrar\xe2\x80\x99s wife, they\r\nrecognizing her as the aged groceress of the same village. At five\r\nminutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster, in a\r\nsoft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; and as the\r\nhour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish clerk and his wife, the\r\nseedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also Mr. Day, the\r\nworld-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who resides in\r\nhis native place, and has never sold a picture outside it, though his\r\npretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow-villagers,\r\nwhose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the outer\r\nneglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively (at the\r\nprice of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in the\r\nparish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nBurthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle;\r\nthe horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up\r\ninto his seat as if he were used to it\xe2\x80\x94which he is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is everybody here?\xe2\x80\x99 he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the\r\npassengers within.\r\n\r\nAs those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster\r\nwas assumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and hindrances the\r\nvan with its human freight was got under way. It jogged on at an easy\r\npace till it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the\r\ntown. The carrier pulled up suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgot the curate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van, but\r\nthe curate was not in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I wonder where that there man is?\xe2\x80\x99 continued the carrier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he ought to be punctual,\xe2\x80\x99 said the carrier. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock sharp\r\nis my time for starting,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to \xe2\x80\x99en. And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNow he\xe2\x80\x99s not here, and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be\r\nas good as his word. Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line\r\nof life?\xe2\x80\x99 He turned to the parish clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was talking an immense deal with him, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, half an hour\r\nago,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that ecclesiastic, as one of whom it was no erroneous\r\nsupposition that he should be on intimate terms with another of the\r\ncloth. \xe2\x80\x98But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say he would be late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the\r\nvan of rays from the curate\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles, followed hastily by his face\r\nand a few white whiskers, and the swinging tails of his long gaunt\r\ncoat. Nobody reproached him, seeing how he was reproaching himself; and\r\nhe entered breathlessly and took his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now be we all here?\xe2\x80\x99 said the carrier again. They started a second\r\ntime, and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the\r\ntown, and had nearly reached the second bridge, behind which, as every\r\nnative remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway\r\ndisappear finally from the view of gazing burghers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99m alive!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the postmistress from the interior of the\r\nconveyance, peering through the little square back-window along the\r\nroad townward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said the carrier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man hailing us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother sudden stoppage. \xe2\x80\x98Somebody else?\xe2\x80\x99 the carrier asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, sure!\xe2\x80\x99 All waited silently, while those who could gaze out did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, who can that be?\xe2\x80\x99 Burthen continued. \xe2\x80\x98I just put it to ye,\r\nneighbours, can any man keep time with such hindrances? Bain\xe2\x80\x99t we full\r\na\xe2\x80\x99ready? Who in the world can the man be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster, his position\r\ncommanding the road more comfortably than that of his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their\r\nnotice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by\r\ntheir stopping, that it had been secured. His clothes were decidedly\r\nnot of a local cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular\r\nmark of difference. In his left hand he carried a small leather\r\ntravelling bag. As soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the\r\ninscription on its side, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the\r\nright conveyance, and asked if they had room.\r\n\r\nThe carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed\r\nthey could carry one more, whereupon the stranger mounted, and took the\r\nseat cleared for him within. And then the horses made another move,\r\nthis time for good, and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls\r\nall told.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You bain\xe2\x80\x99t one of these parts, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the carrier. \xe2\x80\x98I could tell\r\nthat as far as I could see \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am one of these parts,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh? H\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the\r\nnew-comer\xe2\x80\x99s assertion. \xe2\x80\x98I was speaking of Upper Longpuddle more\r\nparticular,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the carrier hardily, \xe2\x80\x98and I think I know most\r\nfaces of that valley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and my father and\r\ngrandfather before me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the passenger quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said the aged groceress in the background, \xe2\x80\x98it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nJohn Lackland\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94he who went to foreign parts\r\nfive-and-thirty years ago with his wife and family? Yet\xe2\x80\x94what do I\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s his father\xe2\x80\x99s voice!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the man,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98John Lackland was my father,\r\nand I am John Lackland\xe2\x80\x99s son. Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was a\r\nboy of eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me and my\r\nsister with them. Kytes\xe2\x80\x99s boy Tony was the one who drove us and our\r\nbelongings to Casterbridge on the morning we left; and his was the last\r\nLongpuddle face I saw. We sailed the same week across the ocean, and\r\nthere we\xe2\x80\x99ve been ever since, and there I\xe2\x80\x99ve left those I went with\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthree.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alive or dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x98And I have come back to the old\r\nplace, having nourished a thought\xe2\x80\x94not a definite intention, but just a\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94that I should like to return here in a year or two, to spend\r\nthe remainder of my days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Married man, Mr. Lackland?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And have the world used \xe2\x80\x99ee well, sir\xe2\x80\x94or rather John, knowing \xe2\x80\x99ee as a\r\nchild? In these rich new countries that we hear of so much, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nrich with the rest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not very rich,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Lackland said. \xe2\x80\x98Even in new countries, you\r\nknow, there are failures. The race is not always to the swift, nor the\r\nbattle to the strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither\r\nswift nor strong. However, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough about me. Now, having answered\r\nyour inquiries, you must answer mine; for being in London, I have come\r\ndown here entirely to discover what Longpuddle is looking like, and who\r\nare living there. That was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring\r\na carriage for driving across.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as usual. Old figures\r\nhave dropped out o\xe2\x80\x99 their frames, so to speak it, and new ones have\r\nbeen put in their places. You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the\r\none to drive your family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaggon when you left. Tony is, I believe, living still, but not at\r\nLongpuddle. He went away and settled at Lewgate, near Mellstock, after\r\nhis marriage. Ah, Tony was a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His character had hardly come out when I knew him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. But \xe2\x80\x99twas well enough, as far as that goes\xe2\x80\x94except as to women. I\r\nshall never forget his courting\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went on:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTONY KYTES, THE ARCH-DECEIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall never forget Tony\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a little, round, firm, tight\r\nface, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough\r\nto hurt his looks in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, though he\xe2\x80\x99d had it badish when he\r\nwas a boy. So very serious looking and unsmiling \xe2\x80\x99a was, that young\r\nman, that it really seemed as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at all without great\r\npain to his conscience. He looked very hard at a small speck in your\r\neye when talking to \xe2\x80\x99ee. And there was no more sign of a whisker or\r\nbeard on Tony Kytes\xe2\x80\x99s face than on the palm of my hand. He used to sing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Tailor\xe2\x80\x99s Breeches\xe2\x80\x9d with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand all the rest of the scandalous stuff. He was quite the women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite, and in return for their likings he loved \xe2\x80\x99em in shoals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly\r\nRichards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon\r\nsaid that they were engaged to be married. One Saturday he had been to\r\nmarket to do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon\r\nin the afternoon. When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be\r\ngoing over in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top\r\nbut Unity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nvery tender toward before he\xe2\x80\x99d got engaged to Milly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As soon as Tony came up to her she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Tony, will you give\r\nme a lift home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I could refuse\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTony,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, in a sort of tender chide, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did ye desert me for\r\nthat other one? In what is she better than I? I should have made \xe2\x80\x99ee a\r\nfiner wife, and a more loving one too. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t girls that are so easily\r\nwon at first that are the best. Think how long we\xe2\x80\x99ve known each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94ever since we were children almost\xe2\x80\x94now haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Tony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that we have,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony, a-struck with the truth o\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony?\r\nNow tell the truth to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI never have, upon my life,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94can you say I\xe2\x80\x99m not pretty, Tony? Now look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He let his eyes light upon her for a long while. \xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays he. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPrettier than she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could\r\nspeak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a\r\nfeather he knew well\xe2\x80\x94the feather in Milly\xe2\x80\x99s hat\xe2\x80\x94she to whom he had been\r\nthinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cUnity,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, as mild as he could, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s Milly coming. Now I\r\nshall catch it mightily if she sees \xe2\x80\x99ee riding here with me; and if you\r\nget down she\xe2\x80\x99ll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing \xe2\x80\x99ee in\r\nthe road, she\xe2\x80\x99ll know we\xe2\x80\x99ve been coming on together. Now, dearest\r\nUnity, will ye, to avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nany more than I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and\r\nlet me cover you over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed? It will\r\nall be done in a minute. Do!\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll think over what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said; and\r\nperhaps I shall put a loving question to you after all, instead of to\r\nMilly. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t true that it is all settled between her and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,\r\nand Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but\r\nfor the loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Tony!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as\r\nhe came near. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been coming home! Just as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive at Upper Longpuddle at all! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to meet you as you asked\r\nme to do, and to ride back with you, and talk over our future\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94since you asked me, and I promised. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come\r\nelse, Mr. Tony!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my dear, I did ask ye\xe2\x80\x94to be sure I did, now I think of it\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nhad quite forgot it. To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course! What can I do else? Surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to\r\nwalk, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve come all this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no! I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your\r\nmother. I saw her there\xe2\x80\x94and she looked as if she might be expecting\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO no; she\xe2\x80\x99s just home. She came across the fields, and so got back\r\nbefore you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony. And there was no help for it but\r\nto take her up beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts,\r\nand birds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields,\r\ntill presently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a\r\nhouse that stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah\r\nJolliver, another young beauty of the place at that time, and the very\r\nfirst woman that Tony had fallen in love with\xe2\x80\x94before Milly and before\r\nUnity, in fact\xe2\x80\x94the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of\r\nMilly. She was a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d not thought much of her of late. The house Hannah was looking from\r\nwas her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Milly\xe2\x80\x94my coming wife, as I may call \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony in his\r\nmodest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, \xe2\x80\x9cI see a young\r\nwoman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me. The fact is,\r\nMilly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s discovered I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised another, and a prettier than she, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrather afeard of her temper if she sees us together. Now, Milly, would\r\nyou do me a favour\xe2\x80\x94my coming wife, as I may say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, dearest Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThen would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of\r\nthe waggon, and hide there out of sight till we\xe2\x80\x99ve passed the house?\r\nShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen us yet. You see, we ought to live in peace and\r\ngood-will since \xe2\x80\x99tis almost Christmas, and \xe2\x80\x99twill prevent angry\r\npassions rising, which we always should do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, to oblige you, Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d Milly said; and though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just\r\nbehind the seat, Unity being snug at the other end. So they drove on\r\ntill they got near the road-side cottage. Hannah had soon seen him\r\ncoming, and waited at the window, looking down upon him. She tossed her\r\nhead a little disdainful and smiled off-hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure! What was I thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony, in a flutter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you seem as if you was staying at your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see I have my bonnet and jacket\r\non? I have only called to see her on my way home. How can you be so\r\nstupid, Tony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94of course you must come along wi\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony,\r\nfeeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes. And he reined\r\nin the horse, and waited till she\xe2\x80\x99d come downstairs, and then helped\r\nher up beside him. He drove on again, his face as long as a face that\r\nwas a round one by nature well could be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is nice, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nTony?\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI like riding with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tony looked back into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a\r\nwhile. In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he\r\nlooked at her the more he liked her, till he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of\r\nhim think why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity\r\nwhile Hannah Jolliver was in question. So they sat a little closer and\r\ncloser, their feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching,\r\nand Tony thought over and over again how handsome Hannah was. He spoke\r\ntenderer and tenderer, and called her \xe2\x80\x9cdear Hannah\xe2\x80\x9d in a whisper at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, not exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? How low you talk, Tony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve a kind of hoarseness. I said, not exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you mean to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as to that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his. He\r\nwondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweet Hannah!\xe2\x80\x9d he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really\r\nable to help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world\r\nbesides. \xe2\x80\x9cSettled it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d says Hannah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony, letting go her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks?\r\nWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been carrying corn, and there\xe2\x80\x99s mice in this waggon, I\r\ndeclare!\xe2\x80\x9d She began to haul up the tails of her gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; \xe2\x80\x99tis the axle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony in an assuring way. \xe2\x80\x9cIt do go like\r\nthat sometimes in dry weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you\r\nlike her better than me? Because\xe2\x80\x94because, although I\xe2\x80\x99ve held off so\r\nindependent, I\xe2\x80\x99ll own at last that I do like \xe2\x80\x99ee, Tony, to tell the\r\ntruth; and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say no if you asked me\xe2\x80\x94you know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had\r\nbeen quite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if\r\nyou can mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very\r\nsoft, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it,\r\nand ask you that question you speak of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThrow over Milly?\xe2\x80\x94all to marry me! How delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Hannah,\r\nquite loud, clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this there was a real squeak\xe2\x80\x94an angry, spiteful squeak, and\r\nafterward a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a\r\nmovement of the empty sacks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSomething\xe2\x80\x99s there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hannah, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, really,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying\r\ninwardly for a way out of this. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell \xe2\x80\x99ee at first, because\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t frighten \xe2\x80\x99ee. But, Hannah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve really a couple of ferrets\r\nin a bag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish it knowed, as \xe2\x80\x99twould be called poaching. Oh, they can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nout, bless ye\xe2\x80\x94you are quite safe! And\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94what a fine day it is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, Hannah, for this time of year? Be you going to market next\r\nSaturday? How is your aunt now?\xe2\x80\x9d And so on, says Tony, to keep her from\r\ntalking any more about love in Milly\xe2\x80\x99s hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he\r\nshould get out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance.\r\nNearing home he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his\r\nhand as if he wished to speak to Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, much\r\nrelieved, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I go and find out what father wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to\r\nget breathing time. He found that his father was looking at him with\r\nrather a stern eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was\r\nalongside him, \xe2\x80\x9cthis won\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end\r\no\xe2\x80\x99t. But don\xe2\x80\x99t go driving about the country with Jolliver\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nand making a scandal. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have such things done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI only asked her\xe2\x80\x94that is, she asked me, to ride home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShe? Why, now, if it had been Milly, \xe2\x80\x99twould have been quite proper;\r\nbut you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMilly\xe2\x80\x99s there too, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMilly? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the corn-sacks! Yes, the truth is, father, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got rather into\r\na nunny-watch, I\xe2\x80\x99m afeard! Unity Sallet is there too\xe2\x80\x94yes, at the other\r\nend, under the tarpaulin. All three are in that waggon, and what to do\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em I know no more than the dead! The best plan is, as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthinking, to speak out loud and plain to one of \xe2\x80\x99em before the rest,\r\nand that will settle it; not but what \xe2\x80\x99twill cause \xe2\x80\x99em to kick up a bit\r\nof a miff, for certain. Now which would you marry, father, if you was\r\nin my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhichever of \xe2\x80\x99em did _not_ ask to ride with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Milly, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say, as she only mounted by my\r\ninvitation. But Milly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen stick to Milly, she\xe2\x80\x99s the best . . . But look at that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His father pointed toward the waggon. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t hold that horse in.\r\nYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left the reins in her hands. Run on and take the\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s head, or there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some accident to them maids!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tony\xe2\x80\x99s horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s tugging at the reins, had\r\nstarted on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get\r\nback to the stable, for he had had a long day out. Without another word\r\nTony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly\r\nthere was nothing so powerful as his father\xe2\x80\x99s recommending her. No; it\r\ncould not be Milly, after all. Hannah must be the one, since he could\r\nnot marry all three. This he thought while running after the waggon.\r\nBut queer things were happening inside it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being\r\nobliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony\r\nwas saying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o\xe2\x80\x99 being\r\nlaughed at, that she was in hiding. She became more and more restless,\r\nand in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoot and white stocking close to her head. It quite frightened her, not\r\nknowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise. But after the\r\nfright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and\r\nshe crept and crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin,\r\nlike a snake, when lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t disgraceful!\xe2\x80\x9d says Milly in a raging whisper to\r\nUnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis,\xe2\x80\x9d says Unity, \xe2\x80\x9cto see you hiding in a young man\xe2\x80\x99s waggon like\r\nthis, and no great character belonging to either of ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are saying!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milly, getting louder. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nengaged to be married to him, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t I a right to be here? What\r\nright have you, I should like to know? What has he been promising you?\r\nA pretty lot of nonsense, I expect! But what Tony says to other women\r\nis all mere wind, and no concern to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be too sure!\xe2\x80\x9d says Unity. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going to have Hannah, and\r\nnot you, nor me either; I could hear that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was\r\nthunderstruck a\xe2\x80\x99most into a swound; and it was just at this time that\r\nthe horse moved on. Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was\r\ndoing; and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so\r\nhorrified that she let go the reins altogether. The horse went on at\r\nhis own pace, and coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down\r\nthe hill to Lower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went\r\nup the bank, the waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon\r\nthe near axles, and out rolled the three maidens into the road in a\r\nheap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough\r\nto see that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches\r\nfrom the brambles of the hedge. But he was rather alarmed when he heard\r\nhow they were going on at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye quarrel, my dears\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t ye!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, taking off his hat out\r\nof respect to \xe2\x80\x99em. And then he would have kissed them all round, as\r\nfair and square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking\r\nto let him, and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak out honest, because I ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony, as soon as\r\nhe could get heard. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked\r\nHannah to be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the\r\nbanns next\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tony had not noticed that Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s father was coming up behind, nor\r\nhad he noticed that Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s face was beginning to bleed from the\r\nscratch of a bramble. Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him,\r\ncrying worse than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter is _not_ willing, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe you willing, Hannah? I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him,\r\nif yer virtue is left to \xe2\x80\x99ee and you run no risk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as sound as a bell for me, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony, flaring\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so\xe2\x80\x99s the others, come to that, though you may think it an\r\nonusual thing in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have spirit, and I do refuse him!\xe2\x80\x9d says Hannah, partly because her\r\nfather was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the\r\ndiscovery, and the scratch on her face. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle did I think when I was\r\nso soft with him just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have me, Hannah?\xe2\x80\x9d says Tony, his jaw hanging down\r\nlike a dead man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever\xe2\x80\x94I would sooner marry no\xe2\x80\x94nobody at all!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped out, though\r\nwith her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he\r\nhad asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face\r\nhad not been scratched by the bramble. And having said that, away she\r\nwalked upon her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tony didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say next. Milly was sobbing her heart out;\r\nbut as his father had strongly recommended her he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\ninclined that way. So he turned to Unity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, will you, Unity dear, be mine?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTake her leavings? Not I!\xe2\x80\x9d says Unity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d scorn it!\xe2\x80\x9d And away walks\r\nUnity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she\xe2\x80\x99d gone some way,\r\nto see if he was following her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in\r\nwatery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Milly,\xe2\x80\x9d he says at last, going up to her, \xe2\x80\x9cit do seem as if\r\nfate had ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody. And what must\r\nbe must be, I suppose. Hey, Milly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like, Tony. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t really mean what you said to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word of it!\xe2\x80\x9d declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted\r\ntogether; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday. I was not\r\nable to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all\r\naccount. Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest,\r\nI think, Mr. Flaxton?\xe2\x80\x99 The speaker turned to the parish clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Flaxton. \xe2\x80\x98And that party was the cause of a very\r\ncurious change in some other people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs; I mean in Steve\r\nHardcome\xe2\x80\x99s and his cousin James\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! the Hardcomes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98How familiar that name is to\r\nme! What of them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe clerk cleared his throat and began:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Tony\xe2\x80\x99s was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been at a good many, as you may suppose\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94turning to the\r\nnewly-arrived one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend\r\nall christening, wedding, and funeral parties\xe2\x80\x94such being our Wessex\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited\r\nwere the said Hardcomes o\xe2\x80\x99 Climmerston\xe2\x80\x94Steve and James\xe2\x80\x94first cousins,\r\nboth of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own\r\naccount. With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives,\r\ntwo young women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly\r\nmaidens, and numbers of friends from Abbot\xe2\x80\x99s-Cernel, and Weatherbury,\r\nand Mellstock, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where\xe2\x80\x94a regular houseful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk\r\nplayed at \xe2\x80\x9cPut\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAll-fours\xe2\x80\x9d in the parlour, though at last they\r\ngave that up to join in the dance. The top of the figure was by the\r\nlarge front window of the room, and there were so many couples that the\r\nlower part of the figure reached through the door at the back, and into\r\nthe darkness of the out-house; in fact, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the end of the\r\nrow at all, and \xe2\x80\x99twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the\r\nlowest couples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the\r\nout-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were\r\nswelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first\r\nfiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for\r\nhe wished to dance. And in another hour the second fiddler laid down\r\nhis, and said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third\r\nfiddler left, and he was a\xe2\x80\x99 old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.\r\nHowever, he managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being\r\nno chair in the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was\r\nobliged to sit upon as much of the little corner-table as projected\r\nbeyond the corner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not a very wide\r\nseat for a man advanced in years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples,\r\nas was natural to their situation. Each pair was very well matched, and\r\nvery unlike the other. James Hardcome\xe2\x80\x99s intended was called Emily\r\nDarth, and both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people,\r\nfond of a quiet life. Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were\r\ndifferent; they were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about\r\nand seeing what was going on in the world. The two couples had arranged\r\nto get married on the same day, and that not long thence; Tony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwedding being a sort of stimulant, as is often the case; I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed\r\nit professionally many times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of\r\ncourtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James\r\nhad for his partner Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s plighted one, Olive, at the same time\r\nthat Stephen was dancing with James\xe2\x80\x99s Emily. It was noticed that in\r\nspite o\xe2\x80\x99 the exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less\r\nthan before. By and by they were treading another tune in the same\r\nchanged order as we had noticed earlier, and though at first each one\r\nhad held the other\xe2\x80\x99s mistress strictly at half-arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, lest there\r\nshould be shown any objection to too close quarters by the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproper man, as time passed there was a little more closeness between\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em; and presently a little more closeness still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the\r\nwrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he\r\nwhirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to\r\nmind what the other was doing. The party began to draw towards its end,\r\nand I saw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on\r\naccount of my morning\xe2\x80\x99s business. But I learnt the rest of it from\r\nthose that knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed\r\npartners, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, the two young men looked at one another,\r\nand in a moment or two went out into the porch together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cJames,\xe2\x80\x9d says Steve, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat were you thinking of when you were dancing\r\nwith my Olive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said James, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps what you were thinking of when you were\r\ndancing with my Emily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve, with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind changing for good and all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt was what I was feeling likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d said James.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I. But what would the girls say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis my belief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly object.\r\nYour Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your Olive to me,\xe2\x80\x9d says James. \xe2\x80\x9cI could feel her heart beating\r\nlike a clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four\r\nwalking home together. And they did so. When they parted that night the\r\nexchange was decided on\xe2\x80\x94all having been done under the hot excitement\r\nof that evening\xe2\x80\x99s dancing. Thus it happened that on the following\r\nSunday morning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide\r\nopen to hear the names published as they had expected, there was no\r\nsmall amazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed. The\r\ncongregation whispered, and thought the parson had made a mistake; till\r\nthey discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way.\r\nAs they had decided, so they were married, each one to the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noriginal property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough,\r\ntill the time came when these young people began to grow a little less\r\nwarm to their respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and\r\nthe two cousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em so mad at the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they\r\nmight have married straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had\r\nfallen in love. \xe2\x80\x99Twas Tony\xe2\x80\x99s party that had done _it_, plain enough,\r\nand they half wished they had never gone there. James, being a quiet,\r\nfireside, perusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and\r\nOlive, his wife, who loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a\r\ndegree; while Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither,\r\nhad a very domestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs,\r\nscarcely ever wished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with\r\nhim to please him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their\r\nacquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James\xe2\x80\x99s wife and\r\nsigh, and James would look at Steve\xe2\x80\x99s wife and do the same. Indeed, at\r\nlast the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind\r\nmentioning it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,\r\nwhimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over their\r\nfoolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance. Still, they were\r\nsensible and honest young fellows enough, and did their best to make\r\nshift with their lot as they had arranged it, and not to repine at what\r\ncould not now be altered or mended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly\r\nlittle outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a\r\nlong while past. This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to\r\nspend their holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the\r\nshore\xe2\x80\x94their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet\r\nsands. I can seem to see \xe2\x80\x99em now! Then they looked at the ships in the\r\nharbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an\r\ninn; and then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the\r\nvelvet sands. As evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats\r\nupon the Esplanade, and listened to the band; and then they said \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall we do next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOf all things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to row in the bay! We could listen to the music from the water as\r\nwell as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing; so should I,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stephen, his tastes being always\r\nlike hers.\r\n\r\nHere the clerk turned to the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange\r\nevening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it\r\nfrom their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige the\r\ngentleman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, if it is wished,\xe2\x80\x99 said the curate. And he took up the\r\nclerk\xe2\x80\x99s tale:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear the\r\nthought of going into a boat. James, too, disliked the water, and said\r\nthat for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band\r\nin the seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s way if she desired a row. The end of the discussion was that\r\nJames and his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s wife Emily agreed to remain where they were\r\nsitting and enjoy the music, while they watched the other two hire a\r\nboat just beneath, and take their water-excursion of half an hour or\r\nso, till they should choose to come back and join the sitters on the\r\nEsplanade; when they would all start homeward together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than\r\nthis arrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the\r\nboatman below and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk\r\ncarefully out upon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable\r\nthem to get alongside the craft. They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and\r\ntake his seat facing her; when they were settled they waved their hands\r\nto the couple watching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls\r\nand pulled off to the tune beat by the band, she steering through the\r\nother boats skimming about, for the sea was as smooth as glass that\r\nevening, and pleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow pretty they look moving on, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily to James (as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been assured). \xe2\x80\x9cThey both enjoy it equally. In everything their\r\nlikings are the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said James.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThey would have made a handsome pair if they had married,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity we should have parted \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk of that, James,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cFor better or for worse we\r\ndecided to do as we did, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band\r\nplayed as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and\r\nOlive shrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea. The\r\ntwo on shore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment,\r\nand take off his coat to get at his work better; but James\xe2\x80\x99s wife sat\r\nquite still in the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered\r\nthe boat. When they had got very small indeed she turned her head to\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShe is waving her handkerchief to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who\r\nthereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The boat\xe2\x80\x99s course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected\r\nher steering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen;\r\nbut now the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon\r\nsee nothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive\xe2\x80\x99s light\r\nmantle and Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s white shirt sleeves behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The two on the shore talked on. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas very curious\xe2\x80\x94our changing\r\npartners at Tony Kytes\xe2\x80\x99s wedding,\xe2\x80\x9d Emily declared. \xe2\x80\x9cTony was of a\r\nfickle nature by all account, and it really seemed as if his character\r\nhad infected us that night. Which of you two was it that first proposed\r\nnot to marry as we were engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d says James. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talked it over,\r\nyou know; and no sooner said than done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas the dancing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople get quite crazy sometimes in a\r\ndance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThey do,\xe2\x80\x9d he owned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cJames\xe2\x80\x94do you think they care for one another still?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Mrs.\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling\r\nmight flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\r\nnothing of any account,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think that Olive is in Steve\xe2\x80\x99s mind a good deal,\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs\r\nMrs. Stephen; \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past\r\nour window at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could\r\ndo anything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured James Hardcome. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it almost time for them to turn and\r\nsweep round to the shore, as the other boating folk have done? I wonder\r\nwhat Olive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that?\r\nShe has hardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt they are talking, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think of where they are going,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggests Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so,\xe2\x80\x9d said James. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Steve could row like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cHe often comes here on business, and generally has\r\na pull round the bay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly see the boat or them,\xe2\x80\x9d says James again; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is\r\ngetting dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the\r\ncoming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up\r\ntheir distant shapes. They had disappeared while still following the\r\nsame straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they\r\nwere intending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return\r\nto earth again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their\r\nagreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned. The\r\nEsplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their\r\nstands and departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding\r\nlights, and the little boats came back to shore one after another,\r\ntheir hirers walking on to the sands by the plank they had climbed to\r\ngo afloat; but among these Stephen and Olive did not appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time they are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am getting quite chilly. I did\r\nnot expect to have to sit so long in the evening air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat,\r\nand insisted on lending it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wrapped it round Emily\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, James,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow cold Olive must be in that thin\r\njacket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He said he was thinking so too. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they are sure to be quite close\r\nat hand by this time, though we can\xe2\x80\x99t see \xe2\x80\x99em. The boats are not all in\r\nyet. Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish\r\nout their hour of hiring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShall we walk by the edge of the water,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cto see if we can\r\ndiscover them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,\r\nlest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that\r\nthey had not kept the appointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite\r\nthe seat; and still the others did not come. James Hardcome at last\r\nwent to the boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might\r\nhave come in under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and\r\nmight have forgotten the appointment at the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAll in?\xe2\x80\x9d asked James.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAll but one boat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lessor. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think where that couple\r\nis keeping to. They might run foul of something or other in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s wife and Olive\xe2\x80\x99s husband waited, with more and more\r\nanxiety. But no little yellow boat returned. Was it possible they could\r\nhave landed further down the Esplanade?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt may have been done to escape paying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boat-owner. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like people who would do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as\r\nthat. But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between\r\nSteve and himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for\r\nthe first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been\r\nrevived by their face-to-face position more strongly than either had\r\nanticipated at starting\xe2\x80\x94the excursion having been so obviously\r\nundertaken for the pleasure of the performance only,\xe2\x80\x94and that they had\r\nlanded at some steps he knew of further down toward the pier, to be\r\nlonger alone together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its\r\nexistence to his companion. He merely said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us walk further\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till\r\nStephen Hardcome\xe2\x80\x99s wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffered arm. Thus the night advanced. Emily was presently so worn out\r\nby fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was,\r\ntoo, a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the\r\nother side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some\r\nunexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have waited\r\nso long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be\r\nkept, though this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an\r\nelopement being enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings,\r\nthe two remaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of\r\nBudmouth-Regis; and when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper\r\nLongpuddle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Along this very road as we do now,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the parish clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure\xe2\x80\x94along this very road,\xe2\x80\x99 said the curate. \xe2\x80\x98However, Stephen\r\nand Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village\r\nsince leaving it in the morning. Emily and James Hardcome went to their\r\nrespective dwellings to snatch a hasty night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, and at daylight\r\nthe next morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the\r\nBudmouth train, the line being just opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence.\r\nIn the course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen\r\nsuch a man and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the\r\nboat kept straight to sea; they had sat looking in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces\r\nas if they were in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were\r\ndoing, or whither they were steering. It was not till late that day\r\nthat more tidings reached James\xe2\x80\x99s ears. The boat had been found\r\ndrifting bottom upward a long way from land. In the evening the sea\r\nrose somewhat, and a cry spread through the town that two bodies were\r\ncast ashore in Lullstead Bay, several miles to the eastward. They were\r\nbrought to Budmouth, and inspection revealed them to be the missing\r\npair. It was said that they had been found tightly locked in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, his lips upon hers, their features still wrapt in the\r\nsame calm and dream-like repose which had been observed in their\r\ndemeanour as they had glided along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the\r\nunfortunate man and woman in putting to sea. They were both above\r\nsuspicion as to intention. Whatever their mutual feelings might have\r\nled them on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of\r\neither. Conjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender\r\nreverie while gazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed\r\nfor him and her alone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual\r\nsentiments were, they had continued thus, oblivious of time and space,\r\ntill darkness suddenly overtook them far from land. But nothing was\r\ntruly known. It had been their destiny to die thus. The two halves,\r\nintended by Nature to make the perfect whole, had failed in that result\r\nduring their lives, though \xe2\x80\x9cin their death they were not divided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTheir bodies were brought home, and buried on one day. I remember that,\r\non looking round the churchyard while reading the service, I observed\r\nnearly all the parish at their funeral.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was so, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The remaining two,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky\r\nwhile relating the lovers\xe2\x80\x99 sad fate), \xe2\x80\x98were a more thoughtful and\r\nfar-seeing, though less romantic, couple than the first. They were now\r\nmutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident\r\nin a position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature\xe2\x80\x99s plan and\r\ntheir own original and calmly-formed intention. James Hardcome took\r\nEmily to wife in the course of a year and a half; and the marriage\r\nproved in every respect a happy one. I solemnized the service, Hardcome\r\nhaving told me, when he came to give notice of the proposed wedding,\r\nthe story of his first wife\xe2\x80\x99s loss almost word for word as I have told\r\nit to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are they living in Longpuddle still?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the new-comer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the clerk. \xe2\x80\x98James has been dead these dozen\r\nyears, and his mis\xe2\x80\x99ess about six or seven. They had no children.\r\nWilliam Privett used to be their odd man till he died.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94William Privett! He dead too?\xe2\x80\x94dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said the other. \xe2\x80\x98All passed\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir. William was much older than I. He\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been over eighty if\r\nhe had lived till now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was something very strange about William\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94very strange\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van. It was the\r\nseedsman\xe2\x80\x99s father, who had hitherto kept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what might that have been?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Lackland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERSTITIOUS MAN\xe2\x80\x99S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man; you could feel\r\nwhen he came near \xe2\x80\x99ee; and if he was in the house or anywhere behind\r\nyour back without your seeing him, there seemed to be something clammy\r\nin the air, as if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow. Well,\r\none Sunday, at a time that William was in very good health to all\r\nappearance, the bell that was ringing for church went very heavy all of\r\na sudden; the sexton, who told me o\xe2\x80\x99t, said he\xe2\x80\x99d not known the bell go\r\nso heavy in his hand for years\xe2\x80\x94it was just as if the gudgeons wanted\r\noiling. That was on the Sunday, as I say. During the week after, it\r\nchanced that William\xe2\x80\x99s wife was staying up late one night to finish her\r\nironing, she doing the washing for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome. Her husband\r\nhad finished his supper and gone to bed as usual some hour or two\r\nbefore. While she ironed she heard him coming down stairs; he stopped\r\nto put on his boots at the stair-foot, where he always left them, and\r\nthen came on into the living-room where she was ironing, passing\r\nthrough it towards the door, this being the only way from the staircase\r\nto the outside of the house. No word was said on either side, William\r\nnot being a man given to much speaking, and his wife being occupied\r\nwith her work. He went out and closed the door behind him. As her\r\nhusband had now and then gone out in this way at night before when\r\nunwell, or unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took no particular\r\nnotice, and continued at her ironing. This she finished shortly after,\r\nand as he had not come in she waited awhile for him, putting away the\r\nirons and things, and preparing the table for his breakfast in the\r\nmorning. Still he did not return, but supposing him not far off, and\r\nwanting to get to bed herself, tired as she was, she left the door\r\nunbarred and went to the stairs, after writing on the back of the door\r\nwith chalk: _Mind and do the door_ (because he was a forgetful man).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on reaching the foot of\r\nthe stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he\r\nhad gone to rest; going up to their chamber she found him in bed\r\nsleeping as sound as a rock. How he could have got back again without\r\nher seeing or hearing him was beyond her comprehension. It could only\r\nhave been by passing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with\r\nthe iron. But this notion did not satisfy her: it was surely impossible\r\nthat she should not have seen him come in through a room so small. She\r\ncould not unravel the mystery, and felt very queer and uncomfortable\r\nabout it. However, she would not disturb him to question him then, and\r\nwent to bed herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He rose and left for his work very early the next morning, before she\r\nwas awake, and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for\r\nan explanation, for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem\r\nonly the more startling. When he came in to the meal he said, before\r\nshe could put her question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of them words chalked\r\non the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She told him, and asked him about his going out the night before.\r\nWilliam declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it,\r\nhaving in fact undressed, lain down, and fallen asleep directly, never\r\nonce waking till the clock struck five, and he rose up to go to his\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she\r\nwas of her own existence, and was little less certain that he did not\r\nreturn. She felt too disturbed to argue with him, and let the subject\r\ndrop as though she must have been mistaken. When she was walking down\r\nLongpuddle street later in the day she met Jim Weedle\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Nancy,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs. Privett,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind letting you know what the reason o\xe2\x80\x99t is. Last night, being Old\r\nMidsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get home\r\ntill near one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Privett. \xe2\x80\x9cOld Midsummer yesterday was it? Faith I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think whe\xe2\x80\x99r \xe2\x80\x99twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I\xe2\x80\x99d too much work to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And we were frightened enough, I can tell \xe2\x80\x99ee, by what we saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did ye see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign parts so young,\r\nthat on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes\r\nof all the folk in the parish who are going to be at death\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nwithin the year can be seen entering the church. Those who get over\r\ntheir illness come out again after a while; those that are doomed to\r\ndie do not return.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you see?\xe2\x80\x9d asked William\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nancy, backwardly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what we saw, or who we\r\nsaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d says Betty Privett, in a quiet way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you put it so,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nancy, hanging fire, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x94thought we\r\ndid see him; but it was darkish, and we was frightened, and of course\r\nit might not have been he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind letting it out, though \xe2\x80\x99tis kept back in\r\nkindness. And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of church again: I know it as well as\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was said. But\r\nthree days after, William Privett was mowing with John Chiles in Mr.\r\nHardcome\xe2\x80\x99s meadow, and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat\r\ntheir bit o\xe2\x80\x99 nunch under a tree, and empty their flagon. Afterwards\r\nboth of \xe2\x80\x99em fell asleep as they sat. John Chiles was the first to wake,\r\nand as he looked towards his fellow-mower he saw one of those great\r\nwhite miller\xe2\x80\x99s-souls as we call \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, a miller-moth\xe2\x80\x94come\r\nfrom William\xe2\x80\x99s open mouth while he slept, and fly straight away. John\r\nthought it odd enough, as William had worked in a mill for several\r\nyears when he was a boy. He then looked at the sun, and found by the\r\nplace o\xe2\x80\x99t that they had slept a long while, and as William did not\r\nwake, John called to him and said it was high time to begin work again.\r\nHe took no notice, and then John went up and shook him, and found he\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at Longpuddle Spring\r\ndipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned away, who should he see\r\ncoming down to the spring on the other side but William, looking very\r\npale and odd. This surprised Philip Hookhorn very much, for years\r\nbefore that time William\xe2\x80\x99s little son\xe2\x80\x94his only child\xe2\x80\x94had been drowned\r\nin that spring while at play there, and this had so preyed upon\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s mind that he\xe2\x80\x99d never been seen near the spring afterwards,\r\nand had been known to go half a mile out of his way to avoid the place.\r\nOn inquiry, it was found that William in body could not have stood by\r\nthe spring, being in the mead two miles off; and it also came out that\r\nthe time at which he was seen at the spring was the very time when he\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A rather melancholy story,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the emigrant, after a minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes. Well, we must take ups and downs together,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nseedsman\xe2\x80\x99s father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a rum start that was\r\nbetween Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and the pa\xe2\x80\x99son and clerk o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nScrimpton?\xe2\x80\x99 said the master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued\r\nliveliness in his eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon\r\nsmall objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his\r\nfeet outside. \xe2\x80\x98Theirs was a queerer experience of a pa\xe2\x80\x99son and clerk\r\nthan some folks get, and may cheer \xe2\x80\x99ee up a little after this dampness\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s been flung over yer soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history, and\r\nshould be happy to hear it, quite recollecting the personality of the\r\nman Satchel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel that you knew;\r\nthis one has not been married more than two or three years, and \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nat the time o\xe2\x80\x99 the wedding that the accident happened that I could tell\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee of, or anybody else here, for that matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,\xe2\x80\x99 said several; a\r\nrequest in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that the Satchel family\r\nwas one he had known well before leaving home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll just mention, as you be a stranger,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the carrier to\r\nLackland, \xe2\x80\x98that Christopher\xe2\x80\x99s stories will bear pruning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe emigrant nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I can soon tell it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the master-thatcher, schooling himself\r\nto a tone of actuality. \xe2\x80\x98Though as it has more to do with the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\r\nand clerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better\r\nchurchman than I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREY SATCHEL AND THE PARSON AND CLERK\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It all arose, you must know, from Andrey being fond of a drop of drink\r\nat that time\xe2\x80\x94though he\xe2\x80\x99s a sober enough man now by all account, so much\r\nthe better for him. Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than\r\nAndrey; how much older I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say; she was not one of our\r\nparish, and the register alone may be able to tell that. But, at any\r\nrate, her being a little ahead of her young man in mortal years,\r\ncoupled with other bodily circumstances\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the women.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his\r\nmind; and \xe2\x80\x99twas with a joyful countenance (they say) that she, with\r\nAndrey and his brother and sister-in-law, marched off to church one\r\nNovember morning as soon as \xe2\x80\x99twas day a\xe2\x80\x99most, to be made one with\r\nAndrey for the rest of her life. He had left our place long before it\r\nwas light, and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at him,\r\nand flung up their hats as he went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses, and, as\r\nit was a wonderful fine day for the time of year, the plan was that as\r\nsoon as they were married they would make out a holiday by driving\r\nstraight off to Port Bredy, to see the ships and the sea and the\r\nsojers, instead of coming back to a meal at the house of the distant\r\nrelation she lived wi\xe2\x80\x99, and moping about there all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps\r\nto church that morning; the truth o\xe2\x80\x99t was that his nearest neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood\r\ngodfather, had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cNot if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a\r\ngodfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the\r\nnext, and therefore I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the most of the blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d So that when\r\nhe started from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all. The\r\nresult was, as I say, that when he and his bride-to-be walked up the\r\nchurch to get married, the pa\xe2\x80\x99son (who was a very strict man inside the\r\nchurch, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very\r\nsharp:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this, my man? You are in liquor. And so early, too. I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed\r\nof you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrey. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can walk straight enough\r\nfor practical purposes. I can walk a chalk line,\xe2\x80\x9d he says (meaning no\r\noffence), \xe2\x80\x9cas well as some other folk: and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (getting hotter)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon\r\nthat if you, Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night\r\nso thoroughly as I have done, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stand at all;\r\nd--- me if you would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This answer made Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Billy\xe2\x80\x94as they used to call him\xe2\x80\x94rather spitish,\r\nnot to say hot, for he was a warm-tempered man if provoked, and he\r\nsaid, very decidedly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I cannot marry you in this state; and I\r\nwill not! Go home and get sober!\xe2\x80\x9d And he slapped the book together like\r\na rat-trap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break, for very\r\nfear that she would lose Andrey after all her hard work to get him, and\r\nbegged and implored the pa\xe2\x80\x99son to go on with the ceremony. But no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Mr. Toogood. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not right and decent. I am sorry for you, my\r\nyoung woman, but you\xe2\x80\x99d better go home again. I wonder how you could\r\nthink of bringing him here drunk like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut if\xe2\x80\x94if he don\xe2\x80\x99t come drunk he won\xe2\x80\x99t come at all, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she says,\r\nthrough her sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help that,\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son; and plead as she might, it did\r\nnot move him. Then she tried him another way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go home, sir, and leave us here, and come back\r\nto the church in an hour or two, I\xe2\x80\x99ll undertake to say that he shall be\r\nas sober as a judge,\xe2\x80\x9d she cries. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll bide here, with your\r\npermission; for if he once goes out of this here church unmarried, all\r\nVan Amburgh\xe2\x80\x99s horses won\xe2\x80\x99t drag him back again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d says the parson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you two hours, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd please, sir, lock the door, so that we can\xe2\x80\x99t escape!\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the parson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let nobody know that we are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The pa\xe2\x80\x99son then took off his clane white surplice, and went away; and\r\nthe others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a\r\nsecret, which it was not a very hard thing to do, the place being so\r\nlonely, and the hour so early. The witnesses, Andrey\xe2\x80\x99s brother and\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s wife, neither one o\xe2\x80\x99 which cared about Andrey\xe2\x80\x99s marrying\r\nJane, and had come rather against their will, said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait\r\ntwo hours in that hole of a place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle\r\nbefore dinner-time. They were altogether so crusty that the clerk said\r\nthere was no difficulty in their doing as they wished. They could go\r\nhome as if their brother\xe2\x80\x99s wedding had actually taken place and the\r\nmarried couple had gone onward for their day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure jaunt to Port\r\nBredy as intended, he, the clerk, and any casual passer-by would act as\r\nwitnesses when the pa\xe2\x80\x99son came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This was agreed to, and away Andrey\xe2\x80\x99s relations went, nothing loath,\r\nand the clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple.\r\nThe bride went up and whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear good clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cif we bide here in the church, folk\r\nmay see us through the winders, and find out what has happened; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twould cause such a talk and scandal that I never should get over it:\r\nand perhaps, too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me! Will\r\nye lock us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tole\r\nhim in there if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman,\r\nand they toled Andrey into the tower, and the clerk locked \xe2\x80\x99em both up\r\nstraightway, and then went home, to return at the end of the two hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church\r\nwhen he saw a gentleman in pink and top-boots ride past his windows,\r\nand with a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met\r\nthat day just on the edge of his parish. The pa\xe2\x80\x99son was one who dearly\r\nloved sport, and much he longed to be there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short, except o\xe2\x80\x99 Sundays and at tide-times in the week, Pa\xe2\x80\x99son\r\nBilly was the life o\xe2\x80\x99 the Hunt. \xe2\x80\x99Tis true that he was poor, and that he\r\nrode all of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old, and\r\nhis tops older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and full o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncracks. But he\xe2\x80\x99d been in at the death of three thousand foxes.\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x94being a bachelor man\xe2\x80\x94every time he went to bed in summer he used to\r\nopen the bed at bottom and crawl up head foremost, to mind \'em of the\r\ncoming winter and the good sport he\xe2\x80\x99d have, and the foxes going to\r\nearth. And whenever there was a christening at the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s, and he had\r\ndinner there afterwards, as he always did, he never failed to christen\r\nthe chiel over again in a bottle of port wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now the clerk was the parson\xe2\x80\x99s groom and gardener and jineral manager,\r\nand had just got back to his work in the garden when he, too, saw the\r\nhunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of \xe2\x80\x99em, noblemen and\r\ngentry, and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the\r\nwhipper-in, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who besides. The clerk loved going to\r\ncover as frantical as the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, so much so that whenever he saw or\r\nheard the pack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the\r\nwinds of heaven. He might be bedding, or he might be sowing\xe2\x80\x94all was\r\nforgot. So he throws down his spade and rushes in to the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, who\r\nwas by this time as frantical to go as he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThat there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise bad, very bad, this\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x9d the clerk says, all of a tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye think I\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\ntrot her round the downs for an hour, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, she does want exercise badly. I\xe2\x80\x99ll trot her round\r\nmyself,\xe2\x80\x9d says the parson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll trot her yerself? Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s the cob, sir. Really that\r\ncob is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long! If\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my putting on the saddle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Take him out, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, never caring\r\nwhat the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately. So,\r\nscrambling into his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he\r\nrode off towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour. No sooner\r\nwas he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off after him. When\r\nthe pa\xe2\x80\x99son got to the meet, he found a lot of friends, and was as jolly\r\nas he could be: the hounds found a\xe2\x80\x99most as soon as they threw off, and\r\nthere was great excitement. So, forgetting that he had meant to go back\r\nat once, away rides the pa\xe2\x80\x99son with the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the hunt, all across\r\nthe fallow ground that lies between Lippet Wood and Green\xe2\x80\x99s Copse; and\r\nas he galloped he looked behind for a moment, and there was the clerk\r\nclose to his heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, clerk\xe2\x80\x94you here?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, here be I,\xe2\x80\x9d says t\xe2\x80\x99other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFine exercise for the horses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir\xe2\x80\x94hee, hee!\xe2\x80\x9d says the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So they went on and on, into Green\xe2\x80\x99s Copse, then across to Higher\r\nJirton; then on across this very turnpike-road to Climmerston Ridge,\r\nthen away towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and down dale, like the very\r\nwind, the clerk close to the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, and the pa\xe2\x80\x99son not far from the\r\nhounds. Never was there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had\r\nthat day; and neither pa\xe2\x80\x99son nor clerk thought one word about the\r\nunmarried couple locked up in the church tower waiting to get j\xe2\x80\x99ined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThese hosses of yours, sir, will be much improved by this!\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nclerk as he rode along, just a neck behind the pa\xe2\x80\x99son. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a happy\r\nthought of your reverent mind to bring \xe2\x80\x99em out to-day. Why, it may be\r\nfrosty in a day or two, and then the poor things mid not be able to\r\nleave the stable for weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThey may not, they may not, it is true. A merciful man is merciful to\r\nhis beast,\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHee, hee!\xe2\x80\x9d says the clerk, glancing sly into the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, a-glancing back into the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes! Why, dammy, there\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nfoxes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHush, clerk, hush! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me hear that word again! Remember our\r\ncalling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, sir, true. But really, good sport do carry away a man so, that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s apt to forget his high persuasion!\xe2\x80\x9d And the next minute the corner\r\nof the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s eye shot again into the corner of the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\npa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s back again to the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cHee, hee!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Toogood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the clerk again, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is better than crying Amen to\r\nyour Ever-and-ever on a winter\xe2\x80\x99s morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, clerk! To everything there\xe2\x80\x99s a season,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pa\xe2\x80\x99son\r\nToogood, quite pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked,\r\nand had chapter and ve\xe2\x80\x99se at his tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end, as a pa\xe2\x80\x99son should.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by the fox\r\nrunning into a\xe2\x80\x99 old woman\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, under her table, and up the\r\nclock-case. The pa\xe2\x80\x99son and clerk were among the first in at the death,\r\ntheir faces a-staring in at the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s winder, and the clock\r\nstriking as he\xe2\x80\x99d never been heard to strik\xe2\x80\x99 before. Then came the\r\nquestion of finding their way home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither the pa\xe2\x80\x99son nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do\r\nthis, for their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground. But they\r\nstarted back-along as well as they could, though they were so done up\r\nthat they could only drag along at a\xe2\x80\x99 amble, and not much of that at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never, never get there!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Mr. Toogood, quite bowed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d groans the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a judgment upon us for our\r\niniquities!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it is,\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs the pa\xe2\x80\x99son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x99twas quite dark afore they entered the pa\xe2\x80\x99sonage gate, having\r\ncrept into the parish as quiet as if they\xe2\x80\x99d stole a hammer, little\r\nwishing their congregation to know what they\xe2\x80\x99d been up to all day long.\r\nAnd as they were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never\r\nonce did they think of the unmarried couple. As soon as ever the horses\r\nhad been stabled and fed, and the pa\xe2\x80\x99son and clerk had had a bit and a\r\nsup theirselves, they went to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next morning when Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Toogood was at breakfast, thinking of the\r\nglorious sport he\xe2\x80\x99d had the day before, the clerk came in a hurry to\r\nthe door and asked to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt has just come into my mind, sir, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve forgot all about the\r\ncouple that we was to have married yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The half-chawed victuals dropped from the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s mouth as if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen shot. \xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cso we have! How very awkward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, sir; very. Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99ve ruined the \xe2\x80\x99ooman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94to be sure\xe2\x80\x94I remember! She ought to have been married before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIf anything has happened to her up in that there tower, and no doctor\r\nor nuss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x98Ah\xe2\x80\x94poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the women.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twill be a quarter-sessions matter for us, not to speak of the\r\ndisgrace to the Church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, clerk, don\xe2\x80\x99t drive me wild!\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the hell\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I marry \xe2\x80\x99em, drunk or sober!\xe2\x80\x9d (Pa\xe2\x80\x99sons used to cuss in them days\r\nlike plain honest men.) \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to the church to see what\r\nhappened to them, or inquired in the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, sir! It only came into my head a moment ago, and I always like\r\nto be second to you in church matters. You could have knocked me down\r\nwith a sparrer\xe2\x80\x99s feather when I thought o\xe2\x80\x99t, sir; I assure \xe2\x80\x99ee you\r\ncould!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and together they went\r\noff to the church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all likely that they are there now,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Toogood,\r\nas they went; \xe2\x80\x9cand indeed I hope they are not. They be pretty sure to\r\nhave \xe2\x80\x99scaped and gone home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the churchyard, and\r\nlooking up at the tower, there they seed a little small white face at\r\nthe belfry-winder, and a little small hand waving. \xe2\x80\x99Twas the bride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGod my life, clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Toogood, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to face\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d And he sank down upon a tombstone. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so\r\ncussed particular!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twas a pity we didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish it when we\xe2\x80\x99d begun,\xe2\x80\x9d the clerk\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nye, the couple must put up with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, clerk, true! Does she look as if anything premature had took\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see her no lower down than her arm-pits, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94how do her face look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt do look mighty white!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must know the worst! Dear me, how the small of my back do\r\nache from that ride yesterday! . . . But to more godly business!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower stairs, and\r\nimmediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like starved mice from a\r\ncupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now, and his bride pale and\r\ncold, but otherwise as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, with a great breath of relief, \xe2\x80\x9cyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen here ever since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d says the bride, sinking down upon a seat in her\r\nweakness. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a morsel, wet or dry, have we had since! It was\r\nimpossible to get out without help, and here we\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you shout, good souls?\xe2\x80\x9d said the pa\xe2\x80\x99son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we were so ashamed at what had led to it,\xe2\x80\x9d sobs Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nfelt that if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives!\r\nOnce or twice Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99ll starve first. I won\xe2\x80\x99t bring disgrace on my name and\r\nyours, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d And so we waited and waited, and walked round and\r\nround; but never did you come till now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTo my regret!\xe2\x80\x9d says the parson. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, we will soon get it\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I should like some victuals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrey, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99twould gie me courage\r\nif it is only a crust o\xe2\x80\x99 bread and a\xe2\x80\x99 onion; for I am that leery that I\r\ncan feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better get it done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bride, a bit anxious in\r\nmanner; \xe2\x80\x9csince we are all here convenient, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk called in a second\r\nwitness who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be likely to gossip about it, and soon the knot\r\nwas tied, and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey\r\nlimper than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Toogood, \xe2\x80\x9cyou two must come to my house, and have a\r\ngood lining put to your insides before you go a step further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the churchyard by\r\none path while the pa\xe2\x80\x99son and clerk went out by the other, and so did\r\nnot attract notice, it being still early. They entered the rectory as\r\nif they\xe2\x80\x99d just come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they\r\nknocked in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was\r\nknown, but it was talked of in time, and they themselves laugh over it\r\nnow; though what Jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis true she saved her name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire\xe2\x80\x99s house as one of the\r\nChristmas fiddlers?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the seedsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster. \xe2\x80\x98It was his father did\r\nthat. Ay, it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and\r\ndrinking.\xe2\x80\x99 Finding that he had the ear of the audience, the\r\nschoolmaster continued without delay:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ANDREY\xe2\x80\x99S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and the players were\r\nto appear at the manor-house as usual that Christmas week, to play and\r\nsing in the hall to the squire\xe2\x80\x99s people and visitors (among \xe2\x80\x99em being\r\nthe archdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who); afterwards\r\ngoing, as we always did, to have a good supper in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall.\r\nAndrew knew this was the custom, and meeting us when we were starting\r\nto go, he said to us: \xe2\x80\x9cLord, how I should like to join in that meal of\r\nbeef, and turkey, and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be\r\ngoing to just now! One more or less will make no difference to the\r\nsquire. I am too old to pass as a singing boy, and too bearded to pass\r\nas a singing girl; can ye lend me a fiddle, neighbours, that I may come\r\nwith ye as a bandsman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be hard upon him, and lent him an old one,\r\nthough Andrew knew no more of music than the Cerne Giant; and armed\r\nwith the instrument he walked up to the squire\xe2\x80\x99s house with the others\r\nof us at the time appointed, and went in boldly, his fiddle under his\r\narm. He made himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books\r\nand moving the candles to the best points for throwing light upon the\r\nnotes; and all went well till we had played and sung \xe2\x80\x9cWhile shepherds\r\nwatch,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cStar, arise,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHark the glad sound.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, a tall gruff old lady, who was much interested in church-music,\r\nsaid quite unexpectedly to Andrew: \xe2\x80\x9cMy man, I see you don\xe2\x80\x99t play your\r\ninstrument with the rest. How is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern\r\nat the fix Andrew was in. We could see that he had fallen into a cold\r\nsweat, and how he would get out of it we did not know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a misfortune, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, bowing as meek as a child.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing along the road I fell down and broke my bow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sorry to hear that,\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t it be mended?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas broke all to splinters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do for you,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then it seemed all over, and we played \xe2\x80\x9cRejoice, ye drowsy mortals\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d in D and two sharps. But no sooner had we got through it than she\r\nsays to Andrew,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sent up into the attic, where we have some old musical\r\ninstruments, and found a bow for you.\xe2\x80\x9d And she hands the bow to poor\r\nwretched Andrew, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know which end to take hold of. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nwe shall have the full accompaniment,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in\r\nthe circle of players in front of his book; for if there was one person\r\nin the parish that everybody was afraid of, \xe2\x80\x99twas this hook-nosed old\r\nlady. However, by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to\r\nmake pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting it\r\ntouch the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving into the\r\ntune with heart and soul. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a question if he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got\r\nthrough all right if one of the squire\xe2\x80\x99s visitors (no other than the\r\narchdeacon) hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut\r\nunder his chin, and the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to crowd\r\nround him, thinking \xe2\x80\x99twas some new way of performing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This revealed everything; the squire\xe2\x80\x99s mother had Andrew turned out of\r\nthe house as a vile impostor, and there was great interruption to the\r\nharmony of the proceedings, the squire declaring he should have notice\r\nto leave his cottage that day fortnight. However, when we got to the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door\r\nby the orders of the squire\xe2\x80\x99s wife, after being turned out at the front\r\nby the orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard about his\r\nleaving his cottage. But Andrew never performed in public as a musician\r\nafter that night; and now he\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone, poor man, as we all shall\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles and\r\nbass-viols,\xe2\x80\x99 said the home-comer, musingly. \xe2\x80\x98Are they still going on\r\nthe same as of old?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless the man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; \xe2\x80\x98why,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve been done away with these twenty year. A young teetotaler plays\r\nthe organ in church now, and plays it very well; though \xe2\x80\x99tis not quite\r\nsuch good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them that\r\ngo with a winch, and the young teetotaler says he can\xe2\x80\x99t always throw\r\nthe proper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did they make the change, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old musicians got\r\ninto a sort of scrape. A terrible scrape \xe2\x80\x99twas too\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, John? I\r\nshall never forget it\xe2\x80\x94never! They lost their character as officers of\r\nthe church as complete as if they\xe2\x80\x99d never had any character at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was very bad for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 The master-thatcher attentively regarded past times as if they\r\nlay about a mile off, and went on:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENT-MINDEDNESS IN A PARISH CHOIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It happened on Sunday after Christmas\xe2\x80\x94the last Sunday ever they played\r\nin Longpuddle church gallery, as it turned out, though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit then. As you may know, sir, the players formed a very good\r\nband\xe2\x80\x94almost as good as the Mellstock parish players that were led by\r\nthe Dewys; and that\xe2\x80\x99s saying a great deal. There was Nicholas\r\nPuddingcome, the leader, with the first fiddle; there was Timothy\r\nThomas, the bass-viol man; John Biles, the tenor fiddler; Dan\xe2\x80\x99l\r\nHornhead, with the serpent; Robert Dowdle, with the clarionet; and Mr.\r\nNicks, with the oboe\xe2\x80\x94all sound and powerful musicians, and\r\nstrong-winded men\xe2\x80\x94they that blowed. For that reason they were very much\r\nin demand Christmas week for little reels and dancing parties; for they\r\ncould turn a jig or a hornpipe out of hand as well as ever they could\r\nturn out a psalm, and perhaps better, not to speak irreverent. In\r\nshort, one half-hour they could be playing a Christmas carol in the\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s hall to the ladies and gentlemen, and drinking tea and coffee\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em as modest as saints; and the next, at The Tinker\xe2\x80\x99s Arms,\r\nblazing away like wild horses with the \xe2\x80\x9cDashing White Sergeant\xe2\x80\x9d to nine\r\ncouple of dancers and more, and swallowing rum-and-cider hot as flame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, this Christmas they\xe2\x80\x99d been out to one rattling randy after\r\nanother every night, and had got next to no sleep at all. Then came the\r\nSunday after Christmas, their fatal day. \xe2\x80\x99Twas so mortal cold that year\r\nthat they could hardly sit in the gallery; for though the congregation\r\ndown in the body of the church had a stove to keep off the frost, the\r\nplayers in the gallery had nothing at all. So Nicholas said at morning\r\nservice, when \xe2\x80\x99twas freezing an inch an hour, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease the Lord I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand this numbing weather no longer: this afternoon we\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nsomething in our insides to make us warm, if it cost a king\xe2\x80\x99s ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he brought a gallon of hot brandy and beer, ready mixed, to church\r\nwith him in the afternoon, and by keeping the jar well wrapped up in\r\nTimothy Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s bass-viol bag it kept drinkably warm till they wanted\r\nit, which was just a thimbleful in the Absolution, and another after\r\nthe Creed, and the remainder at the beginning o\xe2\x80\x99 the sermon. When\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d had the last pull they felt quite comfortable and warm, and as\r\nthe sermon went on\xe2\x80\x94most unfortunately for \xe2\x80\x99em it was a long one that\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x94they fell asleep, every man jack of \xe2\x80\x99em; and there they slept\r\non as sound as rocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas a very dark afternoon, and by the end of the sermon all you\r\ncould see of the inside of the church were the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s two candles\r\nalongside of him in the pulpit, and his spaking face behind \xe2\x80\x99em. The\r\nsermon being ended at last, the pa\xe2\x80\x99son gie\xe2\x80\x99d out the Evening Hymn. But\r\nno choir set about sounding up the tune, and the people began to turn\r\ntheir heads to learn the reason why, and then Levi Limpet, a boy who\r\nsat in the gallery, nudged Timothy and Nicholas, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBegin!\r\nbegin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHey? what?\xe2\x80\x9d says Nicholas, starting up; and the church being so dark\r\nand his head so muddled he thought he was at the party they had played\r\nat all the night before, and away he went, bow and fiddle, at \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nDevil among the Tailors,\xe2\x80\x9d the favourite jig of our neighbourhood at\r\nthat time. The rest of the band, being in the same state of mind and\r\nnothing doubting, followed their leader with all their strength,\r\naccording to custom. They poured out that there tune till the lower\r\nbass notes of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Devil among the Tailors\xe2\x80\x9d made the cobwebs in the\r\nroof shiver like ghosts; then Nicholas, seeing nobody moved, shouted\r\nout as he scraped (in his usual commanding way at dances when the folk\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know the figures), \xe2\x80\x9cTop couples cross hands! And when I make the\r\nfiddle squeak at the end, every man kiss his pardner under the\r\nmistletoe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The boy Levi was so frightened that he bolted down the gallery stairs\r\nand out homeward like lightning. The pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s hair fairly stood on end\r\nwhen he heard the evil tune raging through the church, and thinking the\r\nchoir had gone crazy he held up his hand and said: \xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop, stop!\r\nStop, stop! What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear\xe2\x80\x99n for the noise of their\r\nown playing, and the more he called the louder they played.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the folks came out of their pews, wondering down to the ground,\r\nand saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they mean by such wickedness! We shall be consumed\r\nlike Sodom and Gomorrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the squire came out of his pew lined wi\xe2\x80\x99 green baize, where lots\r\nof lords and ladies visiting at the house were worshipping along with\r\nhim, and went and stood in front of the gallery, and shook his fist in\r\nthe musicians\xe2\x80\x99 faces, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! In this reverent edifice! What!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And at last they heard\xe2\x80\x99n through their playing, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever such an insulting, disgraceful thing\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d says the squire,\r\nwho couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule his passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d says the pa\xe2\x80\x99son, who had come down and stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNot if the Angels of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d says the squire (he was a wickedish\r\nman, the squire was, though now for once he happened to be on the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s side)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot if the Angels of Heaven come down,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cshall\r\none of you villanous players ever sound a note in this church again;\r\nfor the insult to me, and my family, and my visitors, and God Almighty,\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve a-perpetrated this afternoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the unfortunate church band came to their senses, and remembered\r\nwhere they were; and \xe2\x80\x99twas a sight to see Nicholas Pudding come and\r\nTimothy Thomas and John Biles creep down the gallery stairs with their\r\nfiddles under their arms, and poor Dan\xe2\x80\x99l Hornhead with his serpent, and\r\nRobert Dowdle with his clarionet, all looking as little as ninepins;\r\nand out they went. The pa\xe2\x80\x99son might have forgi\xe2\x80\x99ed \xe2\x80\x99em when he learned\r\nthe truth o\xe2\x80\x99t, but the squire would not. That very week he sent for a\r\nbarrel-organ that would play two-and-twenty new psalm-tunes, so exact\r\nand particular that, however sinful inclined you was, you could play\r\nnothing but psalm-tunes whatsomever. He had a really respectable man to\r\nturn the winch, as I said, and the old players played no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, of course, my old acquaintance, the annuitant, Mrs. Winter, who\r\nalways seemed to have something on her mind, is dead and gone?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe home-comer, after a long silence.\r\n\r\nNobody in the van seemed to recollect the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, she must be dead long since: she was seventy when I as a child\r\nknew her,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can recollect Mrs. Winter very well, if nobody else can,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\naged groceress. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s been dead these five-and-twenty year at\r\nleast. You knew what it was upon her mind, sir, that gave her that\r\nhollow-eyed look, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It had something to do with a son of hers, I think I once was told.\r\nBut I was too young to know particulars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe groceress sighed as she conjured up a vision of days long past.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured, \xe2\x80\x98it had all to do with a son.\xe2\x80\x99 Finding that the\r\nvan was still in a listening mood, she spoke on:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINTERS AND THE PALMLEYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To go back to the beginning\xe2\x80\x94if one must\xe2\x80\x94there were two women in the\r\nparish when I was a child, who were to a certain extent rivals in good\r\nlooks. Never mind particulars, but in consequence of this they were at\r\ndaggers-drawn, and they did not love each other any better when one of\r\nthem tempted the other\xe2\x80\x99s lover away from her and married him. He was a\r\nyoung man of the name of Winter, and in due time they had a son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other woman did not marry for many years: but when she was about\r\nthirty a quiet man named Palmley asked her to be his wife, and she\r\naccepted him. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind when the Palmleys were Longpuddle folk,\r\nbut I do well. She had a son also, who was, of course, nine or ten\r\nyears younger than the son of the first. The child proved to be of\r\nrather weak intellect, though his mother loved him as the apple of her\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband died when the child was eight years old, and left\r\nhis widow and boy in poverty. Her former rival, also a widow now, but\r\nfairly well provided for, offered for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake to take the child as\r\nerrand-boy, small as he was, her own son, Jack, being hard upon\r\nseventeen. Her poor neighbour could do no better than let the child go\r\nthere. And to the richer woman\xe2\x80\x99s house little Palmley straightway went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, in some way or other\xe2\x80\x94how, it was never exactly known\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nthriving woman, Mrs. Winter, sent the little boy with a message to the\r\nnext village one December day, much against his will. It was getting\r\ndark, and the child prayed to be allowed not to go, because he would be\r\nafraid coming home. But the mistress insisted, more out of\r\nthoughtlessness than cruelty, and the child went. On his way back he\r\nhad to pass through Yalbury Wood, and something came out from behind a\r\ntree and frightened him into fits. The child was quite ruined by it; he\r\nbecame quite a drivelling idiot, and soon afterward died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the other woman had nothing left to live for, and vowed vengeance\r\nagainst that rival who had first won away her lover, and now had been\r\nthe cause of her bereavement. This last affliction was certainly not\r\nintended by her thriving acquaintance, though it must be owned that\r\nwhen it was done she seemed but little concerned. Whatever vengeance\r\npoor Mrs. Palmley felt, she had no opportunity of carrying it out, and\r\ntime might have softened her feelings into forgetfulness of her\r\nsupposed wrongs as she dragged on her lonely life. So matters stood\r\nwhen, a year after the death of the child, Mrs. Palmley\xe2\x80\x99s niece, who\r\nhad been born and bred in the city of Exonbury, came to live with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This young woman\xe2\x80\x94Miss Harriet Palmley\xe2\x80\x94was a proud and handsome girl,\r\nvery well brought up, and more stylish and genteel than the people of\r\nour village, as was natural, considering where she came from. She\r\nregarded herself as much above Mrs. Winter and her son in position as\r\nMrs. Winter and her son considered themselves above poor Mrs. Palmley.\r\nBut love is an unceremonious thing, and what in the world should happen\r\nbut that young Jack Winter must fall wofully and wildly in love with\r\nHarriet Palmley almost as soon as he saw her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She, being better educated than he, and caring nothing for the village\r\nnotion of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s superiority to her aunt, did not give him much\r\nencouragement. But Longpuddle being no very large world, the two could\r\nnot help seeing a good deal of each other while she was staying there,\r\nand, disdainful young woman as she was, she did seem to take a little\r\npleasure in his attentions and advances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One day when they were picking apples together, he asked her to marry\r\nhim. She had not expected anything so practical as that at so early a\r\ntime, and was led by her surprise into a half-promise; at any rate she\r\ndid not absolutely refuse him, and accepted some little presents that\r\nhe made her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he saw that her view of him was rather as a simple village lad\r\nthan as a young man to look up to, and he felt that he must do\r\nsomething bold to secure her. So he said one day, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going away, to\r\ntry to get into a better position than I can get here.\xe2\x80\x9d In two or three\r\nweeks he wished her good-bye, and went away to Monksbury, to\r\nsuperintend a farm, with a view to start as a farmer himself; and from\r\nthere he wrote regularly to her, as if their marriage were an\r\nunderstood thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now Harriet liked the young man\xe2\x80\x99s presents and the admiration of his\r\neyes; but on paper he was less attractive to her. Her mother had been a\r\nschool-mistress, and Harriet had besides a natural aptitude for\r\npen-and-ink work, in days when to be a ready writer was not such a\r\ncommon thing as it is now, and when actual handwriting was valued as an\r\naccomplishment in itself. Jack Winter\xe2\x80\x99s performances in the shape of\r\nlove-letters quite jarred her city nerves and her finer taste, and when\r\nshe answered one of them, in the lovely running hand that she took such\r\npride in, she very strictly and loftily bade him to practise with a pen\r\nand spelling-book if he wished to please her. Whether he listened to\r\nher request or not nobody knows, but his letters did not improve. He\r\nventured to tell her in his clumsy way that if her heart were more warm\r\ntowards him she would not be so nice about his handwriting and\r\nspelling; which indeed was true enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, in Jack\xe2\x80\x99s absence the weak flame that had been set alight in\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s heart soon sank low, and at last went out altogether. He\r\nwrote and wrote, and begged and prayed her to give a reason for her\r\ncoldness; and then she told him plainly that she was town born, and he\r\nwas not sufficiently well educated to please her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jack Winter\xe2\x80\x99s want of pen-and-ink training did not make him less\r\nthin-skinned than others; in fact, he was terribly tender and touchy\r\nabout anything. This reason that she gave for finally throwing him over\r\ngrieved him, shamed him, and mortified him more than can be told in\r\nthese times, the pride of that day in being able to write with\r\nbeautiful flourishes, and the sorrow at not being able to do so, raging\r\nso high. Jack replied to her with an angry note, and then she hit back\r\nwith smart little stings, telling him how many words he had misspelt in\r\nhis last letter, and declaring again that this alone was sufficient\r\njustification for any woman to put an end to an understanding with him.\r\nHer husband must be a better scholar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He bore her rejection of him in silence, but his suffering was\r\nsharp\xe2\x80\x94all the sharper in being untold. She communicated with Jack no\r\nmore; and as his reason for going out into the world had been only to\r\nprovide a home worthy of her, he had no further object in planning such\r\na home now that she was lost to him. He therefore gave up the farming\r\noccupation by which he had hoped to make himself a master-farmer, and\r\nleft the spot to return to his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As soon as he got back to Longpuddle he found that Harriet had already\r\nlooked wi\xe2\x80\x99 favour upon another lover. He was a young road-contractor,\r\nand Jack could not but admit that his rival was both in manners and\r\nscholarship much ahead of him. Indeed, a more sensible match for the\r\nbeauty who had been dropped into the village by fate could hardly have\r\nbeen found than this man, who could offer her so much better a chance\r\nthan Jack could have done, with his uncertain future and narrow\r\nabilities for grappling with the world. The fact was so clear to him\r\nthat he could hardly blame her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One day by accident Jack saw on a scrap of paper the handwriting of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s new beloved. It was flowing like a stream, well spelt, the\r\nwork of a man accustomed to the ink-bottle and the dictionary, of a man\r\nalready called in the parish a good scholar. And then it struck all of\r\na sudden into Jack\xe2\x80\x99s mind what a contrast the letters of this young man\r\nmust make to his own miserable old letters, and how ridiculous they\r\nmust make his lines appear. He groaned and wished he had never written\r\nto her, and wondered if she had ever kept his poor performances.\r\nPossibly she had kept them, for women are in the habit of doing that,\r\nhe thought, and whilst they were in her hands there was always a chance\r\nof his honest, stupid love-assurances to her being joked over by\r\nHarriet with her present lover, or by anybody who should accidentally\r\nuncover them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The nervous, moody young man could not bear the thought of it, and at\r\nlength decided to ask her to return them, as was proper when\r\nengagements were broken off. He was some hours in framing, copying, and\r\nrecopying the short note in which he made his request, and having\r\nfinished it he sent it to her house. His messenger came back with the\r\nanswer, by word of mouth, that Miss Palmley bade him say she should not\r\npart with what was hers, and wondered at his boldness in troubling her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jack was much affronted at this, and determined to go for his letters\r\nhimself. He chose a time when he knew she was at home, and knocked and\r\nwent in without much ceremony; for though Harriet was so high and\r\nmighty, Jack had small respect for her aunt, Mrs. Palmley, whose little\r\nchild had been his boot-cleaner in earlier days. Harriet was in the\r\nroom, this being the first time they had met since she had jilted him.\r\nHe asked for his letters with a stern and bitter look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At first she said he might have them for all that she cared, and took\r\nthem out of the bureau where she kept them. Then she glanced over the\r\noutside one of the packet, and suddenly altering her mind, she told him\r\nshortly that his request was a silly one, and slipped the letters into\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s work-box, which stood open on the table, locking it, and\r\nsaying with a bantering laugh that of course she thought it best to\r\nkeep \xe2\x80\x99em, since they might be useful to produce as evidence that she\r\nhad good cause for declining to marry him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He blazed up hot. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me those letters!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhos\xe2\x80\x99ever they are I want them back,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be\r\nmade sport of for my penmanship: you\xe2\x80\x99ve another young man now! he has\r\nyour confidence, and you pour all your tales into his ear. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nshowing them to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady Harriet, with calm coolness, like the\r\nheartless woman that she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her manner so maddened him that he made a step towards the work-box,\r\nbut she snatched it up, locked it in the bureau, and turned upon him\r\ntriumphant. For a moment he seemed to be going to wrench the key of the\r\nbureau out of her hand; but he stopped himself, and swung round upon\r\nhis heel and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he was out-of-doors alone, and it got night, he walked about\r\nrestless, and stinging with the sense of being beaten at all points by\r\nher. He could not help fancying her telling her new lover or her\r\nacquaintances of this scene with himself, and laughing with them over\r\nthose poor blotted, crooked lines of his that he had been so anxious to\r\nobtain. As the evening passed on he worked himself into a dogged\r\nresolution to have them back at any price, come what might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the dead of night he came out of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house by the back\r\ndoor, and creeping through the garden hedge went along the field\r\nadjoining till he reached the back of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling. The moon\r\nstruck bright and flat upon the walls, \xe2\x80\x99twas said, and every shiny leaf\r\nof the creepers was like a little looking-glass in the rays. From long\r\nacquaintance Jack knew the arrangement and position of everything in\r\nMrs. Palmley\xe2\x80\x99s house as well as in his own mother\xe2\x80\x99s. The back window\r\nclose to him was a casement with little leaded squares, as it is to\r\nthis day, and was, as now, one of two lighting the sitting-room. The\r\nother, being in front, was closed up with shutters, but this back one\r\nhad not even a blind, and the moonlight as it streamed in showed every\r\narticle of the furniture to him outside. To the right of the room is\r\nthe fireplace, as you may remember; to the left was the bureau at that\r\ntime; inside the bureau was Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s work-box, as he supposed (though\r\nit was really her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s), and inside the work-box were his letters.\r\nWell, he took out his pocket-knife, and without noise lifted the\r\nleading of one of the panes, so that he could take out the glass, and\r\nputting his hand through the hole he unfastened the casement, and\r\nclimbed in through the opening. All the household\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, Mrs.\r\nPalmley, Harriet, and the little maid-servant\xe2\x80\x94were asleep. Jack went\r\nstraight to the bureau, so he said, hoping it might have been\r\nunfastened again\xe2\x80\x94it not being kept locked in ordinary\xe2\x80\x94but Harriet had\r\nnever unfastened it since she secured her letters there the day before.\r\nJack told afterward how he thought of her asleep upstairs, caring\r\nnothing for him, and of the way she had made sport of him and of his\r\nletters; and having advanced so far, he was not to be hindered now. By\r\nforcing the large blade of his knife under the flap of the bureau, he\r\nburst the weak lock; within was the rosewood work-box just as she had\r\nplaced it in her hurry to keep it from him. There being no time to\r\nspare for getting the letters out of it then, he took it under his arm,\r\nshut the bureau, and made the best of his way out of the house,\r\nlatching the casement behind him, and refixing the pane of glass in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winter found his way back to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s as he had come, and being\r\ndog-tired, crept upstairs to bed, hiding the box till he could destroy\r\nits contents. The next morning early he set about doing this, and\r\ncarried it to the linhay at the back of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling. Here by\r\nthe hearth he opened the box, and began burning one by one the letters\r\nthat had cost him so much labour to write and shame to think of,\r\nmeaning to return the box to Harriet, after repairing the slight damage\r\nhe had caused it by opening it without a key, with a note\xe2\x80\x94the last she\r\nwould ever receive from him\xe2\x80\x94telling her triumphantly that in refusing\r\nto return what he had asked for she had calculated too surely upon his\r\nsubmission to her whims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But on removing the last letter from the box he received a shock; for\r\nunderneath it, at the very bottom, lay money\xe2\x80\x94several golden\r\nguineas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; though\r\nit was not, but Mrs. Palmley\xe2\x80\x99s. Before he had got over his qualms at\r\nthis discovery he heard footsteps coming through the house-passage to\r\nwhere he was. In haste he pushed the box and what was in it under some\r\nbrushwood which lay in the linhay; but Jack had been already seen. Two\r\nconstables entered the out-house, and seized him as he knelt before the\r\nfireplace, securing the work-box and all it contained at the same\r\nmoment. They had come to apprehend him on a charge of breaking into the\r\ndwelling-house of Mrs. Palmley on the night preceding; and almost\r\nbefore the lad knew what had happened to him they were leading him\r\nalong the lane that connects that end of the village with this\r\nturnpike-road, and along they marched him between \xe2\x80\x99em all the way to\r\nCasterbridge jail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jack\xe2\x80\x99s act amounted to night burglary\xe2\x80\x94though he had never thought of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and burglary was felony, and a capital offence in those days. His\r\nfigure had been seen by some one against the bright wall as he came\r\naway from Mrs. Palmley\xe2\x80\x99s back window, and the box and money were found\r\nin his possession, while the evidence of the broken bureau-lock and\r\ntinkered window-pane was more than enough for circumstantial detail.\r\nWhether his protestation that he went only for his letters, which he\r\nbelieved to be wrongfully kept from him, would have availed him\r\nanything if supported by other evidence I do not know; but the one\r\nperson who could have borne it out was Harriet, and she acted entirely\r\nunder the sway of her aunt. That aunt was deadly towards Jack Winter.\r\nMrs. Palmley\xe2\x80\x99s time had come. Here was her revenge upon the woman who\r\nhad first won away her lover, and next ruined and deprived her of her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s treasure\xe2\x80\x94her little son. When the assize week drew on, and Jack\r\nhad to stand his trial, Harriet did not appear in the case at all,\r\nwhich was allowed to take its course, Mrs. Palmley testifying to the\r\ngeneral facts of the burglary. Whether Harriet would have come forward\r\nif Jack had appealed to her is not known; possibly she would have done\r\nit for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake; but Jack was too proud to ask a single favour of a\r\ngirl who had jilted him; and he let her alone. The trial was a short\r\none, and the death sentence was passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day o\xe2\x80\x99 young Jack\xe2\x80\x99s execution was a cold dusty Saturday in March.\r\nHe was so boyish and slim that they were obliged in mercy to hang him\r\nin the heaviest fetters kept in the jail, lest his heft should not\r\nbreak his neck, and they weighed so upon him that he could hardly drag\r\nhimself up to the drop. At that time the gover\xe2\x80\x99ment was not strict\r\nabout burying the body of an executed person within the precincts of\r\nthe prison, and at the earnest prayer of his poor mother his body was\r\nallowed to be brought home. All the parish waited at their cottage\r\ndoors in the evening for its arrival: I remember how, as a very little\r\ngirl, I stood by my mother\xe2\x80\x99s side. About eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as we hearkened\r\non our door-stones in the cold bright starlight, we could hear the\r\nfaint crackle of a waggon from the direction of the turnpike-road. The\r\nnoise was lost as the waggon dropped into a hollow, then it was plain\r\nagain as it lumbered down the next long incline, and presently it\r\nentered Longpuddle. The coffin was laid in the belfry for the night,\r\nand the next day, Sunday, between the services, we buried him. A\r\nfuneral sermon was preached the same afternoon, the text chosen being,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.\xe2\x80\x9d . . . Yes,\r\nthey were cruel times!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for Harriet, she and her lover were married in due time; but by all\r\naccount her life was no jocund one. She and her good-man found that\r\nthey could not live comfortably at Longpuddle, by reason of her\r\nconnection with Jack\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes, and they settled in a distant town,\r\nand were no more heard of by us; Mrs. Palmley, too, found it advisable\r\nto join \xe2\x80\x99em shortly after. The dark-eyed, gaunt old Mrs. Winter,\r\nremembered by the emigrant gentleman here, was, as you will have\r\nforeseen, the Mrs. Winter of this story; and I can well call to mind\r\nhow lonely she was, how afraid the children were of her, and how she\r\nkept herself as a stranger among us, though she lived so long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Longpuddle has had her sad experiences as well as her sunny ones,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Lackland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes. But I am thankful to say not many like that, though good and\r\nbad have lived among us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was Georgy Crookhill\xe2\x80\x94he was one of the shady sort, as I have\r\nreason to know,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the registrar, with the manner of a man who\r\nwould like to have his say also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to hear what he was as a boy at school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, as he began so he went on. It never got so far as a hanging\r\nmatter with him, to be sure; but he had some narrow escapes of penal\r\nservitude; and once it was a case of the biter bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF MR. GEORGE CROOKHILL\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One day,\xe2\x80\x99 the registrar continued, \xe2\x80\x98Georgy was ambling out of\r\nMelchester on a miserable screw, the fair being just over, when he saw\r\nin front of him a fine-looking young farmer riding out of the town in\r\nthe same direction. He was mounted on a good strong handsome animal,\r\nworth fifty guineas if worth a crown. When they were going up Bissett\r\nHill, Georgy made it his business to overtake the young farmer. They\r\npassed the time o\xe2\x80\x99 day to one another; Georgy spoke of the state of the\r\nroads, and jogged alongside the well-mounted stranger in very friendly\r\nconversation. The farmer had not been inclined to say much to Georgy at\r\nfirst, but by degrees he grew quite affable too\xe2\x80\x94as friendly as Georgy\r\nwas toward him. He told Crookhill that he had been doing business at\r\nMelchester fair, and was going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that\r\nnight, so as to reach Casterbridge market the next day. When they came\r\nto Woodyates Inn they stopped to bait their horses, and agreed to drink\r\ntogether; with this they got more friendly than ever, and on they went\r\nagain. Before they had nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain,\r\nand as they were now passing through the village of Trantridge, and it\r\nwas quite dark, Georgy persuaded the young farmer to go no further that\r\nnight; the rain would most likely give them a chill. For his part he\r\nhad heard that the little inn here was comfortable, and he meant to\r\nstay. At last the young farmer agreed to put up there also; and they\r\ndismounted, and entered, and had a good supper together, and talked\r\nover their affairs like men who had known and proved each other a long\r\ntime. When it was the hour for retiring they went upstairs to a\r\ndouble-bedded room which Georgy Crookhill had asked the landlord to let\r\nthem share, so sociable were they.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing\r\nand another, running from this to that till the conversation turned\r\nupon disguises, and changing clothes for particular ends. The farmer\r\ntold Georgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it; but\r\nCrookhill professed to be very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon\r\nthe young farmer sank into slumber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was still asleep (I\r\ntell the story as \xe2\x80\x99twas told me), honest Georgy crept out of his bed by\r\nstealth, and dressed himself in the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, in the pockets of\r\nthe said clothes being the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s money. Now though Georgy\r\nparticularly wanted the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s nice clothes and nice horse, owing to\r\na little transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should\r\nnot be too easily recognized, his desires had their bounds: he did not\r\nwish to take his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s money, at any rate more of it than was\r\nnecessary for paying his bill. This he abstracted, and leaving the\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s purse containing the rest on the bedroom table, went\r\ndownstairs. The inn folks had not particularly noticed the faces of\r\ntheir customers, and the one or two who were up at this hour had no\r\nthought but that Georgy was the farmer; so when he had paid the bill\r\nvery liberally, and said he must be off, no objection was made to his\r\ngetting the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s horse saddled for himself; and he rode away upon\r\nit as if it were his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and looking across\r\nthe room saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones\r\nworn by Georgy. At this he sat up in a deep thought for some time,\r\ninstead of hastening to give an alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cThe money, the money is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. But so are the clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He then looked upon the table and saw that the money, or most of it,\r\nhad been left behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and began to dance about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha,\r\nha!\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving\r\nglass and in the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for\r\nall the world as if he were going through the sword exercise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he had dressed himself in Georgy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes and gone downstairs,\r\nhe did not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other; and\r\neven when he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one, he\r\nwas not inclined to cry out. They told him his friend had paid the\r\nbill, at which he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for\r\nbreakfast he mounted Georgy\xe2\x80\x99s horse and rode away likewise, choosing\r\nthe nearest by-lane in preference to the high-road, without knowing\r\nthat Georgy had chosen that by-lane also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of\r\nGeorgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made\r\nthereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village\r\nconstables. It was his friend Georgy, the borrower of his clothes and\r\nhorse. But so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in\r\nrushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the\r\npoor beast he rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help, help!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the constables. \xe2\x80\x9cAssistance in the name of\r\nthe Crown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The young farmer could do nothing but ride forward. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, as coolly as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA deserter\xe2\x80\x94a deserter!\xe2\x80\x9d said they. \xe2\x80\x9cOne who\xe2\x80\x99s to be tried by\r\ncourt-martial and shot without parley. He deserted from the Dragoons at\r\nCheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind him anywhere, and we told \xe2\x80\x99em if we met him we\xe2\x80\x99d hand him on to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em forthwith. The day after he left the barracks the rascal met a\r\nrespectable farmer and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a\r\nfine soldier he would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see\r\nhow well a military uniform would become him. This the simple farmer\r\ndid; when our deserter said that for a joke he would leave the room and\r\ngo to the landlady, to see if she would know him in that dress. He\r\nnever came back, and Farmer Jollice found himself in soldier\xe2\x80\x99s clothes,\r\nthe money in his pockets gone, and, when he got to the stable, his\r\nhorse gone too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d says the young man in Georgy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is this\r\nthe wretched caitiff?\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to Georgy).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Georgy, as innocent as a babe of this matter of the\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s desertion. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the man! He was wearing Farmer Jollice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuit o\xe2\x80\x99 clothes, and he slept in the same room wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, and brought up\r\nthe subject of changing clothes, which put it into my head to dress\r\nmyself in his suit before he was awake. He\xe2\x80\x99s got on mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye hear the villain?\xe2\x80\x9d groans the tall young man to the constables.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with\r\nit that he sees! No, master soldier\xe2\x80\x94that won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! That won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d the constables chimed in. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have the\r\nimpudence to say such as that, when we caught him in the act almost!\r\nBut, thank God, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the handcuffs on him at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe have, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall young man. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must move on.\r\nGood luck to ye with your prisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d And off he went, as fast as his\r\npoor jade would carry him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between \xe2\x80\x99em, and leading\r\nthe horse, marched off in the other direction, toward the village where\r\nthey had been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the\r\ndeserter back, Georgy groaning: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be shot, I shall be shot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey had not gone more than a mile before they met them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHoi, there!\xe2\x80\x9d says the head constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHoi, yerself!\xe2\x80\x9d says the corporal in charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got your man,\xe2\x80\x9d says the constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d says the corporal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHere, between us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the constable. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly you don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize him\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 uniform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook his head and\r\nsaid he was not the absconder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut the absconder changed clothes with Farmer Jollice, and took his\r\nhorse; and this man has \xe2\x80\x99em, d\xe2\x80\x99ye see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not our man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a tall young fellow with\r\na mole on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man\r\ndecidedly has not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI told the two officers of justice that \xe2\x80\x99twas the other!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded\r\nGeorgy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young\r\nfarmer, and not Georgy Crookhill\xe2\x80\x94a fact which Farmer Jollice himself\r\ncorroborated when he arrived on the scene. As Georgy had only robbed\r\nthe robber, his sentence was comparatively light. The deserter from the\r\nDragoons was never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of\r\nthe greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left Georgy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse behind him a few miles ahead, having found the poor creature more\r\nhindrance than aid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable\r\ncharacters of Longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the\r\nordinary inhabitants and the ordinary events, though his local\r\nfellow-travellers preferred the former as subjects of discussion. He\r\nnow for the first time asked concerning young persons of the opposite\r\nsex\xe2\x80\x94or rather those who had been young when he left his native land.\r\nHis informants, adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was\r\nbetter worth telling than the ordinary, would not allow him to dwell\r\nupon the simple chronicles of those who had merely come and gone. They\r\nasked him if he remembered Netty Sargent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Netty Sargent\xe2\x80\x94I do, just remember her. She was a young woman living\r\nwith her uncle when I left, if my childish recollection may be\r\ntrusted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was the maid. She was a oneyer, if you like, sir. Not any harm in\r\nher, you know, but up to everything. You ought to hear how she got the\r\ncopyhold of her house extended. Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mr. Day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He ought,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the world-ignored old painter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him, Mr. Day. Nobody can do it better than you, and you know the\r\nlegal part better than some of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDay apologized, and began:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTY SARGENT\xe2\x80\x99S COPYHOLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely house by the\r\ncopse, just as at the time you knew her; a tall spry young woman. Ah,\r\nhow well one can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time,\r\nand her sly way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye!\r\nWell, she was hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after\r\nher, and by long and by late she was courted by a young man whom\r\nperhaps you did not know\xe2\x80\x94Jasper Cliff was his name\xe2\x80\x94and, though she\r\nmight have had many a better fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas Jasper or nobody for her. He was a selfish customer, always\r\nthinking less of what he was going to do than of what he was going to\r\ngain by his doings. Jasper\xe2\x80\x99s eyes might have been fixed upon Netty, but\r\nhis mind was upon her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house; though he was fond of her in his\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94I admit that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with its garden and\r\nlittle field, was copyhold\xe2\x80\x94granted upon lives in the old way, and had\r\nbeen so granted for generations. Her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s was the last life upon the\r\nproperty; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new\r\nlives, it would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor. But\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas easy to admit\xe2\x80\x94a slight \xe2\x80\x9cfine,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x99twas called, of a few pounds,\r\nwas enough to entitle him to a new deed o\xe2\x80\x99 grant by the custom of the\r\nmanor; and the lord could not hinder it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative\r\nthan a sure house over her head, and Netty\xe2\x80\x99s uncle should have seen to\r\nthe renewal in time, owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the\r\ndropping of the last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire\r\nwas very anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday\r\nwhen the old man came into the church and passed the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s pew, the\r\nSquire would say, \xe2\x80\x9cA little weaker in his knees, a little crookeder in\r\nhis back\xe2\x80\x94and the readmittance not applied for: ha! ha! I shall be able\r\nto make a complete clearing of that corner of the manor some day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it, that old Sargent should\r\nhave been so dilatory; yet some people are like it; and he put off\r\ncalling at the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s agent\xe2\x80\x99s office with the fine week after week,\r\nsaying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have more time next market-day than I have\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d One unfortunate hindrance was that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t very well like\r\nJasper Cliff; and as Jasper kept urging Netty, and Netty on that\r\naccount kept urging her uncle, the old man was inclined to postpone the\r\nre-liveing as long as he could, to spite the selfish young lover. At\r\nlast old Mr. Sargent fell ill, and then Jasper could bear it no longer:\r\nhe produced the fine-money himself, and handed it to Netty, and spoke\r\nto her plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou and your uncle ought to know better. You should press him more.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the money. If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t marry; hang me if I will! For folks won\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a husband that\r\ncan do such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The worried girl took the money and went home, and told her uncle that\r\nit was no house no husband for her. Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the\r\nmoney, for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now\r\nbestir himself; for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he\r\ndid not wish to make her unhappy, since she was so determined. It was\r\nmuch to the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the\r\nmatter at last; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents were\r\nprepared (for on this manor the copy-holders had writings with their\r\nholdings, though on some manors they had none). Old Sargent being now\r\ntoo feeble to go to the agent\xe2\x80\x99s house, the deed was to be brought to\r\nhis house signed, and handed over as a receipt for the money; the\r\ncounterpart to be signed by Sargent, and sent back to the Squire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this purpose at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and Netty put the money into her desk to have it close at\r\nhand. While doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle, and\r\nturning round, saw that he had fallen forward in his chair. She went\r\nand lifted him, but he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained.\r\nNeither medicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself. She had\r\nbeen told that he might possibly go off in that way, and it seemed as\r\nif the end had come. Before she had started for a doctor his face and\r\nextremities grew quite cold and white, and she saw that help would be\r\nuseless. He was stone-dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Netty\xe2\x80\x99s situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its\r\nseriousness. The house, garden, and field were lost\xe2\x80\x94by a few hours\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwith them a home for herself and her lover. She would not think so\r\nmeanly of Jasper as to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution\r\ndeclared in a moment of impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless. Why\r\ncould not her uncle have lived a couple of hours longer, since he had\r\nlived so long? It was now past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock; at five the agent was to\r\ncall, and, if all had gone well, by ten minutes past five the house and\r\nholding would have been securely hers for her own and Jasper\xe2\x80\x99s lives,\r\nthese being two of the three proposed to be added by paying the fine.\r\nHow that wretched old Squire would rejoice at getting the little\r\ntenancy into his hands! He did not really require it, but\r\nconstitutionally hated these tiny copyholds and leaseholds and\r\nfreeholds, which made islands of independence in the fair, smooth ocean\r\nof his estates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to accomplish her\r\nobject in spite of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s negligence. It was a dull December\r\nafternoon: and the first step in her scheme\xe2\x80\x94so the story goes, and I\r\nsee no reason to doubt it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis true as the light,\xe2\x80\x99 affirmed Christopher Twink. \xe2\x80\x98I was just\r\npassing by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door, to make\r\nsure of not being interrupted. Then she set to work by placing her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s small, heavy oak table before the fire; then she went to her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s corpse, sitting in the chair as he had died\xe2\x80\x94a stuffed\r\narm-chair, on casters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and wheeled the chair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with\r\nhis back toward the window, in the attitude of bending over the said\r\noak table, which I knew as a boy as well as I know any piece of\r\nfurniture in my own house. On the table she laid the large family Bible\r\nopen before him, and placed his forefinger on the page; and then she\r\nopened his eyelids a bit, and put on him his spectacles, so that from\r\nbehind he appeared for all the world as if he were reading the\r\nScriptures. Then she unfastened the door and sat down, and when it grew\r\ndark she lit a candle, and put it on the table beside her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came,\r\nand how, when his knock sounded upon the door, she nearly started out\r\nof her skin\xe2\x80\x94at least that\xe2\x80\x99s as it was told me. Netty promptly went to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, under her breath; \xe2\x80\x9cmy uncle is not so\r\nwell to-night, and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he can\xe2\x80\x99t see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty tale,\xe2\x80\x9d says the steward. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve come all this\r\nway about this trumpery little job for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO no, sir\xe2\x80\x94I hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d says Netty. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the business of\r\ngranting the new deed can be done just the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDone? Certainly not. He must pay the renewal money, and sign the\r\nparchment in my presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She looked dubious. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle is so dreadful nervous about law business,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s put it off and put it off for years;\r\nand now to-day really I\xe2\x80\x99ve feared it would verily drive him out of his\r\nmind. His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you\r\nwould be here soon with the parchment writing. He always was afraid of\r\nagents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old fellow\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for him. Well, the thing can\xe2\x80\x99t be done\r\nunless I see him and witness his signature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t see you looking at\r\nhim? I\xe2\x80\x99d soothe his nerves by saying you weren\xe2\x80\x99t strict about the form\r\nof witnessing, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to come in. So that it was done in your\r\nbare presence it would be sufficient, would it not? As he\xe2\x80\x99s such an\r\nold, shrinking, shivering man, it would be a great considerateness on\r\nyour part if that would do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIn my bare presence would do, of course\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I come for. But\r\nhow can I be a witness without his seeing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, in this way, sir; if you\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige me by just stepping here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe conducted him a few yards to the left, till they were opposite the\r\nparlour window. The blind had been left up purposely, and the\r\ncandle-light shone out upon the garden bushes. Within the agent could\r\nsee, at the other end of the room, the back and side of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, and his shoulders and arm, sitting with the book and candle\r\nbefore him, and his spectacles on his nose, as she had placed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s reading his Bible, as you see, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, quite in her\r\nmeekest way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe always was fond of his Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d Netty assured him. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I think\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s nodding over it just at this moment However, that\xe2\x80\x99s natural in an\r\nold man, and unwell. Now you could stand here and see him sign,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir, as he\xe2\x80\x99s such an invalid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the agent, lighting a cigar. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have ready by you\r\nthe merely nominal sum you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay for the admittance, of\r\ncourse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Netty. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it out.\xe2\x80\x9d She fetched the cash, wrapped\r\nin paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the steward\r\ntook from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her\r\nto be signed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s hand is a little paralyzed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what with his\r\nbeing half asleep, too, really I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sort of a signature\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, so that he signs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMight I hold his hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAy, hold his hand, my young woman\xe2\x80\x94that will be near enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued smoking outside\r\nthe window. Now came the ticklish part of Netty\xe2\x80\x99s performance. The\r\nsteward saw her put the inkhorn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chorn,\xe2\x80\x9d says I in my old-fashioned\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94the inkstand, before her uncle, and touch his elbow as to arouse\r\nhim, and speak to him, and spread out the deed; when she had pointed to\r\nshow him where to sign she dipped the pen and put it into his hand. To\r\nhold his hand she artfully stepped behind him, so that the agent could\r\nonly see a little bit of his head, and the hand she held; but he saw\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s hand trace his name on the document. As soon as \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\ndone she came out to the steward with the parchment in her hand, and\r\nthe steward signed as witness by the light from the parlour window.\r\nThen he gave her the deed signed by the Squire, and left; and next\r\nmorning Netty told the neighbours that her uncle was dead in his bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must have undressed him and put him there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must. Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell ye! Well, to cut a\r\nlong story short, that\xe2\x80\x99s how she got back the house and field that\r\nwere, strictly speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every virtue has its reward, they say. Netty had hers for her\r\ningenious contrivance to gain Jasper. Two years after they were married\r\nhe took to beating her\xe2\x80\x94not hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough\r\nto set her in a temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done\r\nto win him, and how she repented of her pains. When the old Squire was\r\ndead, and his son came into the property, this confession of hers began\r\nto be whispered about. But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the\r\nSquire\xe2\x80\x99s son was a pretty young man at that time, and wider-minded than\r\nhis father, having no objection to little holdings; and he never took\r\nany proceedings against her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van descended the\r\nhill leading into the long straggling village. When the houses were\r\nreached the passengers dropped off one by one, each at his or her own\r\ndoor. Arrived at the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and\r\nhaving eaten a light meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had known so\r\nwell in his early days. Though flooded with the light of the rising\r\nmoon, none of the objects wore the attractiveness in this their real\r\npresentation that had ever accompanied their images in the field of his\r\nimagination when he was more than two thousand miles removed from them.\r\nThe peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country, as\r\nseen by the eyes of an absolute foreigner, was lowered in his case by\r\nmagnified expectations from infantine memories. He walked on, looking\r\nat this chimney and that old wall, till he came to the churchyard,\r\nwhich he entered.\r\n\r\nThe head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily decipherable; and\r\nnow for the first time Lackland began to feel himself amid the village\r\ncommunity that he had left behind him five-and-thirty years before.\r\nHere, besides the Sallets, the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the\r\nSargents, and others of whom he had just heard, were names he\r\nremembered even better than those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and\r\nthe Knights, and the Olds. Doubtless representatives of these families,\r\nor some of them, were yet among the living; but to him they would all\r\nbe as strangers. Far from finding his heart ready-supplied with roots\r\nand tendrils here, he perceived that in returning to this spot it would\r\nbe incumbent upon him to re-establish himself from the beginning,\r\nprecisely as though he had never known the place, nor it him. Time had\r\nnot condescended to wait his pleasure, nor local life his greeting.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the village\r\nstreet, and in the fields and lanes about Upper Longpuddle, for a few\r\ndays after his arrival, and then, ghost-like, it silently disappeared.\r\nHe had told some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming\r\nhad been fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with\r\nits inhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose\xe2\x80\x94of coming to spend his\r\nlatter days among them\xe2\x80\x94would probably never be carried out. It is now a\r\ndozen or fifteen years since his visit was paid, and his face has not\r\nagain been seen.\r\n\r\n_March_ 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LIFE\xe2\x80\x99S LITTLE IRONIES ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
