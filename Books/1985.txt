WHICH IS ENTIRELY INTRODUCTORY--CONTAINS AN ACCOUNT OF MISS\r\nCRUMP, HER SUITORS, AND HER FAMILY CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nIn a certain quiet and sequestered nook of the retired village of\r\nLondon--perhaps in the neighbourhood of Berkeley Square, or at any\r\nrate somewhere near Burlington Gardens--there was once a house of\r\nentertainment called the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Crump, the landlord, had,\r\nin the outset of life, performed the duties of Boots in some inn even\r\nmore frequented than his own, and, far from being ashamed of his origin,\r\nas many persons are in the days of their prosperity, had thus solemnly\r\nrecorded it over the hospitable gate of his hotel.\r\n\r\nCrump married Miss Budge, so well known to the admirers of the festive\r\ndance on the other side of the water as Miss Delancy; and they had\r\none daughter, named Morgiana, after that celebrated part in the \xe2\x80\x9cForty\r\nThieves\xe2\x80\x9d which Miss Budge performed with unbounded applause both at\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cSurrey\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Crump sat in a little bar, profusely\r\nornamented with pictures of the dancers of all ages, from Hillisberg,\r\nRose, Parisot, who plied the light fantastic toe in 1805, down to the\r\nSylphides of our day. There was in the collection a charming portrait of\r\nherself, done by De Wilde; she was in the dress of Morgiana, and in the\r\nact of pouring, to very slow music, a quantity of boiling oil into one\r\nof the forty jars. In this sanctuary she sat, with black eyes, black\r\nhair, a purple face and a turban, and morning, noon, or night, as you\r\nwent into the parlour of the hotel, there was Mrs. Crump taking tea\r\n(with a little something in it), looking at the fashions, or reading\r\nCumberland's \xe2\x80\x9cBritish Theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d The Sunday Times was her paper, for she\r\nvoted the Dispatch, that journal which is taken in by most ladies of her\r\nprofession, to be vulgar and Radical, and loved the theatrical gossip in\r\nwhich the other mentioned journal abounds.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Bootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d though a humble, was a very\r\ngenteel house; and a very little persuasion would induce Mr. Crump, as\r\nhe looked at his own door in the sun, to tell you that he had himself\r\nonce drawn off with that very bootjack the top-boots of His Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales and the first gentleman in Europe. While,\r\nthen, the houses of entertainment in the neighbourhood were loud in\r\ntheir pretended Liberal politics, the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\xe2\x80\x9d stuck to the good old\r\nConservative line, and was only frequented by such persons as were of\r\nthat way of thinking. There were two parlours, much accustomed, one for\r\nthe gentlemen of the shoulder-knot, who came from the houses of their\r\nemployers hard by; another for some \xe2\x80\x9cgents who used the 'ouse,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mrs.\r\nCrump would say (Heaven bless her!) in her simple Cockniac dialect, and\r\nwho formed a little club there.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that while Mrs. C. was sipping her eternal tea or\r\nwashing up her endless blue china, you might often hear Miss Morgiana\r\nemployed at the little red-silk cottage piano, singing, \xe2\x80\x9cCome where the\r\nhaspens quiver,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBonny lad, march over hill and furrow,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cMy art\r\nand lute,\xe2\x80\x9d or any other popular piece of the day. And the dear girl sang\r\nwith very considerable skill, too, for she had a fine loud voice, which,\r\nif not always in tune, made up for that defect by its great energy and\r\nactivity; and Morgiana was not content with singing the mere tune, but\r\ngave every one of the roulades, flourishes, and ornaments as she heard\r\nthem at the theatres by Mrs. Humby, Mrs. Waylett, or Madame Vestris.\r\nThe girl had a fine black eye like her mamma, a grand enthusiasm for\r\nthe stage, as every actor's child will have, and, if the truth must be\r\nknown, had appeared many and many a time at the theatre in Catherine\r\nStreet, in minor parts first, and then in Little Pickle, in Desdemona,\r\nin Rosina, and in Miss Foote's part where she used to dance: I have not\r\nthe name to my hand, but think it is Davidson. Four times in the week,\r\nat least, her mother and she used to sail off at night to some place of\r\npublic amusement, for Mrs. Crump had a mysterious acquaintance with\r\nall sorts of theatrical personages; and the gates of her old haunt \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWells,\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cCobourg\xe2\x80\x9d (by the kind permission of Mrs. Davidge), nay,\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cLane\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cMarket\xe2\x80\x9d themselves, flew open before her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen sesame,\xe2\x80\x9d as the robbers' door did to her colleague, Ali Baba\r\n(Hornbuckle), in the operatic piece in which she was so famous.\r\n\r\nBeer was Mr. Crump's beverage, diversified by a little gin, in the\r\nevenings; and little need be said of this gentleman, except that he\r\ndischarged his duties honourably, and filled the president's chair at\r\nthe club as completely as it could possibly be filled; for he could not\r\neven sit in it in his greatcoat, so accurately was the seat adapted to\r\nhim. His wife and daughter, perhaps, thought somewhat slightingly of\r\nhim, for he had no literary tastes, and had never been at a theatre\r\nsince he took his bride from one. He was valet to Lord Slapper at the\r\ntime, and certain it is that his lordship set him up in the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and that stories HAD been told. But what are such to you or me? Let\r\nbygones be bygones; Mrs. Crump was quite as honest as her neighbours,\r\nand Miss had five hundred pounds to be paid down on the day of her\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nThose who know the habits of the British tradesman are aware that he has\r\ngregarious propensities like any lord in the land; that he loves a joke,\r\nthat he is not averse to a glass; that after the day's toil he is happy\r\nto consort with men of his degree; and that as society is not so far\r\nadvanced among us as to allow him to enjoy the comforts of splendid\r\nclub-houses, which are open to many persons with not a tenth part of his\r\npecuniary means, he meets his friends in the cosy tavern parlour, where\r\na neat sanded floor, a large Windsor chair, and a glass of hot something\r\nand water, make him as happy as any of the clubmen in their magnificent\r\nsaloons.\r\n\r\nAt the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\xe2\x80\x9d was, as we have said, a very genteel and select\r\nsociety, called the \xe2\x80\x9cKidney Club,\xe2\x80\x9d from the fact that on Saturday\r\nevenings a little graceful supper of broiled kidneys was usually\r\ndiscussed by the members of the club. Saturday was their grand night;\r\nnot but that they met on all other nights in the week when inclined for\r\nfestivity: and indeed some of them could not come on Saturdays in the\r\nsummer having elegant villas in the suburbs, where they passed the\r\nsix-and-thirty hours of recreation that are happily to be found at the\r\nend of every week.\r\n\r\nThere was Mr. Balls, the great grocer of South Audley Street, a warm\r\nman, who, they say, had his twenty thousand pounds; Jack Snaffle, of the\r\nmews hard by, a capital fellow for a song; Clinker, the ironmonger:\r\nall married gentlemen, and in the best line of business; Tressle, the\r\nundertaker, etc. No liveries were admitted into the room, as may be\r\nimagined, but one or two select butlers and major-domos joined the\r\ncircle; for the persons composing it knew very well how important it\r\nwas to be on good terms with these gentlemen and many a time my lord's\r\naccount would never have been paid, and my lady's large order never have\r\nbeen given, but for the conversation which took place at the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the friendly intercourse subsisting between all the members of the\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe tiptop men of the society were two bachelors, and two as fashionable\r\ntradesmen as any in the town: Mr. Woolsey, from Stultz's, of the famous\r\nhouse of Linsey, Woolsey and Co. of Conduit Street, Tailors; and Mr.\r\nEglantine, the celebrated perruquier and perfumer of Bond Street, whose\r\nsoaps, razors, and patent ventilating scalps are know throughout Europe.\r\nLinsey, the senior partner of the tailors' firm had his handsome mansion\r\nin Regent's Park, drove his buggy, and did little more than lend his\r\nname to the house. Woolsey lived in it, was the working man of the firm,\r\nand it was said that his cut was as magnificent as that of any man in\r\nthe profession. Woolsey and Eglantine were rivals in many ways--rivals\r\nin fashion, rivals in wit, and, above all, rivals for the hand of\r\nan amiable young lady whom we have already mentioned, the dark-eyed\r\nsongstress Morgiana Crump. They were both desperately in love with her,\r\nthat was the truth; and each, in the absence of the other, abused his\r\nrival heartily. Of the hairdresser Woolsey said, that as for Eglantine\r\nbeing his real name, it was all his (Mr. Woolsey's) eye; that he was in\r\nthe hands of the Jews, and his stock and grand shop eaten up by usury.\r\nAnd with regard to Woolsey, Eglantine remarked, that his pretence\r\nof being descended from the Cardinal was all nonsense; that he was a\r\npartner, certainly, in the firm, but had only a sixteenth share; and\r\nthat the firm could never get their moneys in, and had an immense number\r\nof bad debts in their books. As is usual, there was a great deal of\r\ntruth and a great deal of malice in these tales; however, the gentlemen\r\nwere, take them all in all, in a very fashionable way of business, and\r\nhad their claims to Miss Morgiana's hand backed by the parents. Mr.\r\nCrump was a partisan of the tailor; while Mrs. C. was a strong advocate\r\nfor the claims of the enticing perfumer.\r\n\r\nNow, it was a curious fact, that these two gentlemen were each in\r\nneed of the other's services--Woolsey being afflicted with premature\r\nbaldness, or some other necessity for a wig still more fatal--Eglantine\r\nbeing a very fat man, who required much art to make his figure at all\r\ndecent. He wore a brown frock-coat and frogs, and attempted by all sorts\r\nof contrivances to hide his obesity; but Woolsey's remark, that, dress\r\nas he would, he would always look like a snob, and that there was\r\nonly one man in England who could make a gentleman of him, went to the\r\nperfumer's soul; and if there was one thing on earth he longed for (not\r\nincluding the hand of Miss Crump) it was to have a coat from Linsey's,\r\nin which costume he was sure that Morgiana would not resist him.\r\n\r\nIf Eglantine was uneasy about the coat, on the other hand he attacked\r\nWoolsey atrociously on the score of his wig; for though the latter went\r\nto the best makers, he never could get a peruke to sit naturally upon\r\nhim and the unhappy epithet of Mr. Wiggins, applied to him on one\r\noccasion by the barber, stuck to him ever after in the club, and\r\nmade him writhe when it was uttered. Each man would have quitted the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKidneys\xe2\x80\x9d in disgust long since, but for the other--for each had an\r\nattraction in the place, and dared not leave the field in possession of\r\nhis rival.\r\n\r\nTo do Miss Morgiana justice, it must be said, that she did not encourage\r\none more than another; but as far as accepting eau-de-Cologne and\r\nhair-combs from the perfumer--some opera tickets, a treat to Greenwich,\r\nand a piece of real Genoa velvet for a bonnet (it had originally been\r\nintended for a waistcoat), from the admiring tailor, she had been\r\nequally kind to each, and in return had made each a present of a lock\r\nof her beautiful glossy hair. It was all she had to give, poor girl!\r\nand what could she do but gratify her admirers by this cheap and artless\r\ntestimony of her regard? A pretty scene and quarrel took place between\r\nthe rivals on the day when they discovered that each was in possession\r\nof one of Morgiana's ringlets.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the owners and inmates of the little \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n from whom and which, as this chapter is exceedingly discursive and\r\ndescriptive, we must separate the reader for a while, and carry him--it\r\nis only into Bond Street, so no gentleman need be afraid--carry him into\r\nBond Street, where some other personages are awaiting his consideration.\r\n\r\nNot far from Mr. Eglantine's shop in Bond Street, stand, as is very well\r\nknown, the Windsor Chambers. The West Diddlesex Association (Western\r\nBranch), the British and Foreign Soap Company, the celebrated attorneys\r\nKite and Levison, have their respective offices here; and as the names\r\nof the other inhabitants of the chambers are not only painted on the\r\nwalls, but also registered in Mr. Boyle's \xe2\x80\x9cCourt Guide,\xe2\x80\x9d it is quite\r\nunnecessary that they should be repeated here. Among them, on the\r\nentresol (between the splendid saloons of the Soap Company on the first\r\nfloor, with their statue of Britannia presenting a packet of the soap to\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, and America, and the West Diddlesex Western Branch\r\non the basement)--lives a gentleman by the name of Mr. Howard Walker.\r\nThe brass plate on the door of that gentleman's chambers had the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgency\xe2\x80\x9d inscribed beneath his name; and we are therefore at liberty\r\nto imagine that he followed that mysterious occupation. In person Mr.\r\nWalker was very genteel; he had large whiskers, dark eyes (with a slight\r\ncast in them), a cane, and a velvet waistcoat. He was a member of a\r\nclub; had an admission to the opera, and knew every face behind the\r\nscenes; and was in the habit of using a number of French phrases in his\r\nconversation, having picked up a smattering of that language during a\r\nresidence \xe2\x80\x9con the Continent;\xe2\x80\x9d in fact, he had found it very convenient\r\nat various times of his life to dwell in the city of Boulogne, where\r\nhe acquired a knowledge of smoking, ecarte, and billiards, which was\r\nafterwards of great service to him. He knew all the best tables in\r\ntown, and the marker at Hunt's could only give him ten. He had some\r\nfashionable acquaintances too, and you might see him walking arm-in-arm\r\nwith such gentlemen as my Lord Vauxhall, the Marquess of Billingsgate,\r\nor Captain Buff; and at the same time nodding to young Moses, the\r\ndandy bailiff; or Loder, the gambling-house keeper; or Aminadab, the\r\ncigar-seller in the Quadrant. Sometimes he wore a pair of moustaches,\r\nand was called Captain Walker; grounding his claim to that title upon\r\nthe fact of having once held a commission in the service of Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen of Portugal. It scarcely need be said that he had been through\r\nthe Insolvent Court many times. But to those who did not know his\r\nhistory intimately there was some difficulty in identifying him with the\r\nindividual who had so taken the benefit of the law, inasmuch as in\r\nhis schedule his name appeared as Hooker Walker, wine-merchant,\r\ncommission-agent, music-seller, or what not. The fact is, that though he\r\npreferred to call himself Howard, Hooker was his Christian name, and it\r\nhad been bestowed on him by his worthy old father, who was a clergyman,\r\nand had intended his son for that profession. But as the old gentleman\r\ndied in York gaol, where he was a prisoner for debt, he was never able\r\nto put his pious intentions with regard to his son into execution; and\r\nthe young fellow (as he was wont with many oaths to assert) was thrown\r\non his own resources, and became a man of the world at a very early age.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Howard Walker's age was at the time of the commencement of this\r\nhistory, and, indeed, for an indefinite period before or afterwards, it\r\nis impossible to determine. If he were eight-and-twenty, as he asserted\r\nhimself, Time had dealt hardly with him: his hair was thin, there were\r\nmany crows'-feet about his eyes, and other signs in his countenance\r\nof the progress of decay. If, on the contrary, he were forty, as Sam\r\nSnaffle declared, who himself had misfortunes in early life, and vowed\r\nhe knew Mr. Walker in Whitecross Street Prison in 1820, he was a very\r\nyoung-looking person considering his age. His figure was active and\r\nslim, his leg neat, and he had not in his whiskers a single white hair.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be owned that he used Mr. Eglantine's Regenerative\r\nUnction (which will make your whiskers as black as your boot), and, in\r\nfact, he was a pretty constant visitor at that gentleman's emporium;\r\ndealing with him largely for soaps and articles of perfumery, which he\r\nhad at an exceedingly low rate. Indeed, he was never known to pay Mr.\r\nEglantine one single shilling for those objects of luxury, and, having\r\nthem on such moderate terms, was enabled to indulge in them pretty\r\ncopiously. Thus Mr. Walker was almost as great a nosegay as Mr.\r\nEglantine himself: his handkerchief was scented with verbena, his hair\r\nwith jessamine, and his coat had usually a fine perfume of cigars, which\r\nrendered his presence in a small room almost instantaneously remarkable.\r\nI have described Mr. Walker thus accurately, because, in truth, it\r\nis more with characters than with astounding events that this little\r\nhistory deals, and Mr. Walker is one of the principal of our dramatis\r\npersonae.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having introduced Mr. W., we will walk over with him to Mr.\r\nEglantine's emporium, where that gentleman is in waiting, too, to have\r\nhis likeness taken.\r\n\r\nThere is about an acre of plate glass under the Royal arms on Mr.\r\nEglantine's shop-window; and at night, when the gas is lighted, and the\r\nwashballs are illuminated, and the lambent flame plays fitfully over\r\nnumberless bottles of vari-coloured perfumes--now flashes on a case\r\nof razors, and now lightens up a crystal vase, containing a hundred\r\nthousand of his patent tooth-brushes--the effect of the sight may be\r\nimagined. You don't suppose that he is a creature who has those odious,\r\nsimpering wax figures in his window, that are called by the vulgar\r\ndummies? He is above such a wretched artifice; and it is my belief\r\nthat he would as soon have his own head chopped off, and placed as a\r\ntrunkless decoration to his shop-window, as allow a dummy to figure\r\nthere. On one pane you read in elegant gold letters \xe2\x80\x9cEglantinia\xe2\x80\x9d--'tis\r\nhis essence for the handkerchief; on the other is written \xe2\x80\x9cRegenerative\r\nUnction\xe2\x80\x9d--'tis his invaluable pomatum for the hair.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt about it: Eglantine's knowledge of his profession\r\namounts to genius. He sells a cake of soap for seven shillings, for\r\nwhich another man would not get a shilling, and his tooth-brushes go off\r\nlike wildfire at half-a-guinea apiece. If he has to administer rouge or\r\npearl-powder to ladies, he does it with a mystery and fascination which\r\nthere is no resisting, and the ladies believe there are no cosmetics\r\nlike his. He gives his wares unheard-of names, and obtains for them sums\r\nequally prodigious. He CAN dress hair--that is a fact--as few men in\r\nthis age can; and has been known to take twenty pounds in a single\r\nnight from as many of the first ladies of England when ringlets were in\r\nfashion. The introduction of bands, he says, made a difference of two\r\nthousand pounds a year in his income; and if there is one thing in the\r\nworld he hates and despises, it is a Madonna. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm not,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ntradesman--I'm a HARTIST\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Eglantine was born in London)--\xe2\x80\x9cI'm a\r\nhartist; and show me a fine 'ead of air, and I'll dress it for nothink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He vows that it was his way of dressing Mademoiselle Sontag's hair, that\r\ncaused the count her husband to fall in love with her; and he has a lock\r\nof it in a brooch, and says it was the finest head he ever saw, except\r\none, and that was Morgiana Crump's.\r\n\r\nWith his genius and his position in the profession, how comes it, then,\r\nthat Mr. Eglantine was not a man of fortune, as many a less clever has\r\nbeen? If the truth must be told, he loved pleasure, and was in the hands\r\nof the Jews. He had been in business twenty years: he had borrowed a\r\nthousand pounds to purchase his stock and shop; and he calculated that\r\nhe had paid upwards of twenty thousand pounds for the use of the one\r\nthousand, which was still as much due as on the first day when he\r\nentered business. He could show that he had received a thousand dozen\r\nof champagne from the disinterested money-dealers with whom he usually\r\nnegotiated his paper. He had pictures all over his \xe2\x80\x9cstudios,\xe2\x80\x9d which had\r\nbeen purchased in the same bargains. If he sold his goods at an enormous\r\nprice, he paid for them at a rate almost equally exorbitant. There\r\nwas not an article in his shop but came to him through his Israelite\r\nproviders; and in the very front shop itself sat a gentleman who was the\r\nnominee of one of them, and who was called Mr. Mossrose. He was there to\r\nsuperintend the cash account, and to see that certain instalments were\r\npaid to his principals, according to certain agreements entered into\r\nbetween Mr. Eglantine and them.\r\n\r\nHaving that sort of opinion of Mr. Mossrose which Damocles may have had\r\nof the sword which hung over his head, of course Mr. Eglantine hated his\r\nforeman profoundly. \xe2\x80\x9cHE an artist,\xe2\x80\x9d would the former gentleman exclaim;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, he's only a disguised bailiff! Mossrose indeed! The chap's name's\r\nAmos, and he sold oranges before he came here.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mossrose, on his\r\nside, utterly despised Mr. Eglantine, and looked forward to the day when\r\nhe would become the proprietor of the shop, and take Eglantine for a\r\nforeman; and then it would HIS turn to sneer and bully, and ride the\r\nhigh horse.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that there was a skeleton in the great perfumer's\r\nhouse, as the saying is: a worm in his heart's core, and though to all\r\nappearance prosperous, he was really in an awkward position.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Eglantine's relations were with Mr. Walker may be imagined from\r\nthe following dialogue which took place between the two gentlemen at\r\nfive o'clock one summer's afternoon, when Mr. Walker, issuing from his\r\nchambers, came across to the perfumer's shop:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Eglantine at home, Mr. Mossrose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Walker to the foreman, who\r\nsat in the front shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't know--go and look\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning go and be hanged); for Mossrose also\r\nhated Mr. Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you're uncivil I'll break your bones, Mr. AMOS,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Walker,\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see you try, Mr. HOOKER Walker,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the undaunted\r\nshopman; on which the Captain, looking several tremendous canings at\r\nhim, walked into the back room or \xe2\x80\x9cstudio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Tiny my buck?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a soul in town. I 'aven't touched the hirons all day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nEglantine, in rather a desponding way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, just get them ready now, and give my whiskers a turn. I'm going\r\nto dine with Billingsgate and some out-and-out fellows at the 'Regent,'\r\nand so, my lad, just do your best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Eglantine. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect ladies, Captain, every minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good; I don't want to trouble such a great man, I'm sure.\r\nGood-bye, and let me hear from you THIS DAY WEEK, Mr. Eglantine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis day week\xe2\x80\x9d meant that at seven days from that time a certain bill\r\naccepted by Mr. Eglantine would be due, and presented for payment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't be in such a hurry, Captain--do sit down. I'll curl you in one\r\nminute. And, I say, won't the party renew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible--it's the third renewal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I'll make the thing handsome to you;--indeed I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ten pounds do the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! offer my principal ten pounds? Are you mad, Eglantine?--A little\r\nmore of the iron to the left whisker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I meant for commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'll see if that will do. The party I deal with, Eglantine, has\r\npower, I know, and can defer the matter no doubt. As for me, you know,\r\nI'VE nothing to do in the affair, and only act as a friend between you\r\nand him. I give you my honour and soul, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you do, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x9d The last two speeches were lies. The\r\nperfumer knew perfectly well that Mr. Walker would pocket the ten\r\npounds; but he was too easy to care for paying it, and too timid to\r\nquarrel with such a powerful friend. And he had on three different\r\noccasions already paid ten pounds' fine for the renewal of the bill in\r\nquestion, all of which bonuses he knew went to his friend Mr. Walker.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the reader will perceive what was, in part, the meaning of\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cAgency\xe2\x80\x9d on Mr. Walker's door. He was a go-between between\r\nmoney-lenders and borrowers in this world, and certain small sums always\r\nremained with him in the course of the transaction. He was an agent for\r\nwine, too; an agent for places to be had through the influence of\r\ngreat men; he was an agent for half-a-dozen theatrical people, male and\r\nfemale, and had the interests of the latter especially, it was said,\r\nat heart. Such were a few of the means by which this worthy gentleman\r\ncontrived to support himself, and if, as he was fond of high living,\r\ngambling, and pleasures of all kinds, his revenue was not large enough\r\nfor his expenditure--why, he got into debt, and settled his bills that\r\nway. He was as much at home in the Fleet as in Pall Mall, and quite as\r\nhappy in the one place as in the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's the way I take things,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n would this philosopher say. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I've money, I spend; if I've credit,\r\nI borrow; if I'm dunned, I whitewash; and so you can't beat me down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Happy elasticity of temperament! I do believe that, in spite of his\r\nmisfortunes and precarious position, there was no man in England whose\r\nconscience was more calm, and whose slumbers were more tranquil, than\r\nthose of Captain Howard Walker.\r\n\r\nAs he was sitting under the hands of Mr. Eglantine, he reverted to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nladies,\xe2\x80\x9d whom the latter gentleman professed to expect; said he was a\r\nsly dog, a lucky ditto, and asked him if the ladies were handsome.\r\n\r\nEglantine thought there could be no harm in telling a bouncer to a\r\ngentleman with whom he was engaged in money transactions; and so, to\r\ngive the Captain an idea of his solvency and the brilliancy of his\r\nfuture prospects, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI've got a hundred and eighty\r\npounds out with you, which you were obliging enough to negotiate for me.\r\nHave I, or have I not, two bills out to that amount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good fellow, you certainly have; and what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then? Why, I bet you five pounds to one, that in three months\r\nthose bills are paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone! five pounds to one. I take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sudden closing with him made the perfumer rather uneasy; but he was\r\nnot to pay for three months, and so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d too, and went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you say if your bills were paid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mine; Pike's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if Pike's were paid; and the Minories' man paid, and every single\r\nliability I have cleared off; and that Mossrose flung out of winder, and\r\nme and my emporium as free as hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't say so? Is Queen Anne dead? and has she left you a fortune?\r\nor what's the luck in the wind now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's better than Queen Anne, or anybody dying. What should you say to\r\nseeing in that very place where Mossrose now sits (hang him!)--seeing\r\nthe FINEST HEAD OF 'AIR NOW IN EUROPE? A woman, I tell you--a\r\nslap-up lovely woman, who, I'm proud to say, will soon be called Mrs.\r\nHeglantine, and will bring me five thousand pounds to her fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tiny, this IS good luck indeed. I say, you'll be able to do a\r\nbill or two for ME then, hay? You won't forget an old friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I won't. I shall have a place at my board for you, Capting; and\r\nmany's the time I shall 'ope to see you under that ma'ogany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will the French milliner say? She'll hang herself for despair,\r\nEglantine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! not a word about 'ER. I've sown all my wild oats, I tell you.\r\nEglantine is no longer the gay young bachelor, but the sober married\r\nman. I want a heart to share the feelings of mine. I want repose. I'm\r\nnot so young as I was: I feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! you are--you are--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but I sigh for an 'appy fireside; and I'll have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd give up that club which you belong to, hay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The Kidneys?' Oh! of course, no married man should belong to such\r\nplaces: at least, I'LL not; and I'll have my kidneys broiled at home.\r\nBut be quiet, Captain, if you please; the ladies appointed to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it THE lady you expect? eh, you rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get along. It's her and her Ma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Walker determined he wouldn't get along, and would see these\r\nlovely ladies before he stirred.\r\n\r\nThe operation on Mr. Walker's whiskers being concluded, he was arranging\r\nhis toilet before the glass in an agreeable attitude: his neck out,\r\nhis enormous pin settled in his stock to his satisfaction, his eyes\r\ncomplacently directed towards the reflection of his left and favourite\r\nwhisker. Eglantine was laid on a settee, in an easy, though melancholy\r\nposture; he was twiddling the tongs with which he had just operated on\r\nWalker with one hand, and his right-hand ringlet with the other, and he\r\nwas thinking--thinking of Morgiana; and then of the bill which was to\r\nbecome due on the 16th; and then of a light-blue velvet waistcoat with\r\ngold sprigs, in which he looked very killing, and so was trudging round\r\nin his little circle of loves, fears, and vanities. \xe2\x80\x9cHang it!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nWalker was thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI AM a handsome man. A pair of whiskers like mine\r\nare not met with every day. If anybody can see that my tuft is dyed, may\r\nI be--\xe2\x80\x9d When the door was flung open, and a large lady with a curl\r\non her forehead, yellow shawl, a green-velvet bonnet with feathers,\r\nhalf-boots, and a drab gown with tulips and other large exotics painted\r\non it--when, in a word, Mrs. Crump and her daughter bounced into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, Mr. E,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs. Crump, in a gay folatre confidential\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cBut law! there's a gent in the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't mind me, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gent alluded to, in his fascinating\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm a friend of Eglantine's; ain't I, Egg? a chip of the old\r\nblock, hay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHAT you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the perfumer, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn 'air-dresser?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Crump. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought he was; there's\r\nsomething, Mr. E., in gentlemen of your profession so exceeding, so\r\nuncommon distangy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, you do me proud,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman so complimented, with\r\ngreat presence of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me to try my skill upon you, or\r\nupon Miss, your lovely daughter? I'm not so clever as Eglantine, but no\r\nbad hand, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the perfumer, who was uncomfortable\r\nsomehow at the rencontre between the Captain and the object of his\r\naffection. \xe2\x80\x9cHE'S not in the profession, Mrs. C. This is my friend\r\nCaptain Walker, and proud I am to call him my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d And then aside to\r\nMrs. C., \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the first swells on town, ma'am--a regular tiptopper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHumouring the mistake which Mrs. Crump had just made, Mr. Walker thrust\r\nthe curling-irons into the fire in a minute, and looked round at the\r\nladies with such a fascinating grace, that both, now made acquainted\r\nwith his quality, blushed and giggled, and were quite pleased. Mamma\r\nlooked at 'Gina, and 'Gina looked at mamma; and then mamma gave 'Gina a\r\nlittle blow in the region of her little waist, and then both burst out\r\nlaughing, as ladies will laugh, and as, let us trust, they may laugh\r\nfor ever and ever. Why need there be a reason for laughing? Let us laugh\r\nwhen we are laughy, as we sleep when we are sleepy. And so Mrs. Crump\r\nand her demoiselle laughed to their hearts' content; and both fixed\r\ntheir large shining black eyes repeatedly on Mr. Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't leave the room,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming forward with the heated iron\r\nin his hand, and smoothing it on the brown paper with all the dexterity\r\nof a professor (for the fact is, Mr. W. every morning curled his own\r\nimmense whiskers with the greatest skill and care)--\xe2\x80\x9cI won't leave the\r\nroom, Eglantine my boy. My lady here took me for a hairdresser, and so,\r\nyou know, I've a right to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can't stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Crump, all of a sudden, blushing as red as a\r\npeony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have on my peignoir, Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss, looking at the\r\ngentleman, and then dropping down her eyes and blushing too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he can't stay, 'Gina, I tell you: do you think that I would, before\r\na gentleman, take off my--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma means her FRONT!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss, jumping up, and beginning to laugh\r\nwith all her might; at which the honest landlady of the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d who\r\nloved a joke, although at her own expense, laughed too, and said that no\r\none, except Mr. Crump and Mr. Eglantine, had ever seen her without the\r\nornament in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDO go now, you provoking thing, you!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss C. to Mr. Walker;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to hear the hoverture, and it's six o'clock now, and we shall\r\nnever be done against then:\xe2\x80\x9d but the way in which Morgiana said \xe2\x80\x9cDO go,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n clearly indicated \xe2\x80\x9cdon't\xe2\x80\x9d to the perspicacious mind of Mr. Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you 'ad better go,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Eglantine, joining in this\r\nsentiment, and being, in truth, somewhat uneasy at the admiration which\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cswell friend\xe2\x80\x9d excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll see you hanged first, Eggy my boy! Go I won't, until these ladies\r\nhave had their hair dressed: didn't you yourself tell me that Miss\r\nCrump's was the most beautiful hair in Europe? And do you think that\r\nI'll go away without seeing it? No, here I stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty wicked odious provoking man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crump. But, at the\r\nsame time, she took off her bonnet, and placed it on one of the side\r\ncandlesticks of Mr. Eglantine's glass (it was a black-velvet bonnet,\r\ntrimmed with sham lace, and with a wreath of nasturtiums, convolvuluses,\r\nand wallflowers within), and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me the peignoir, Mr.\r\nArchibald, if you please;\xe2\x80\x9d and Eglantine, who would do anything for her\r\nwhen she called him Archibald, immediately produced that garment, and\r\nwrapped round the delicate shoulders of the lady, who, removing a sham\r\ngold chain which she wore on her forehead, two brass hair-combs set with\r\nglass rubies, and the comb which kept her back hair together--removing\r\nthem, I say, and turning her great eyes towards the stranger, and giving\r\nher head a shake, down let tumble such a flood of shining waving heavy\r\nglossy jetty hair, as would have done Mr. Rowland's heart good to see.\r\nIt tumbled down Miss Morgiana's back, and it tumbled over her shoulders,\r\nit tumbled over the chair on which she sat, and from the midst of it her\r\njolly bright-eyed rosy face beamed out with a triumphant smile, which\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cA'n't I now the most angelic being you ever saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Heaven! it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Walker,\r\nwith undisguised admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cISN'T it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Crump, who made her daughter's triumph her own.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeigho! when I acted at 'The Wells' in 1820, before that dear girl was\r\nborn, _I_ had such a head of hair as that, to a shade, sir, to a shade.\r\nThey called me Ravenswing on account of it. I lost my head of hair when\r\nthat dear child was born, and I often say to her, 'Morgiana, you came\r\ninto the world to rob your mother of her 'air.' Were you ever at 'The\r\nWells,' sir, in 1820? Perhaps you recollect Miss Delancy? I am that Miss\r\nDelancy. Perhaps you recollect,--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c'Tink-a-tink, tink-a-tink,\r\n         By the light of the star,\r\n       On the blue river's brink,\r\n         I heard a guitar.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c'I heard a guitar,\r\n         On the blue waters clear,\r\n       And knew by its mu-u-sic,\r\n         That Selim was near!'\r\n\r\nYou remember that in the 'Bagdad Bells'? Fatima, Delancy; Selim,\r\nBenlomond (his real name was Bunnion: and he failed, poor fellow, in\r\nthe public line afterwards). It was done to the tambourine, and dancing\r\nbetween each verse,--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c'Tink-a-tink, tink-a-tink,\r\n         How the soft music swells,\r\n       And I hear the soft clink\r\n         Of the minaret bells!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c'Tink-a--'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d here cried Miss Crump, as if in exceeding pain (and whether Mr.\r\nEglantine had twitched, pulled, or hurt any one individual hair of that\r\nlovely head I don't know)--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are killing me, Mr. Eglantine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this mamma, who was in her attitude, holding up the end of her\r\nboa as a visionary tambourine, and Mr. Walker, who was looking at her,\r\nand in his amusement at the mother's performances had almost forgotten\r\nthe charms of the daughter--both turned round at once, and looked at\r\nher with many expressions of sympathy, while Eglantine, in a voice of\r\nreproach, said, \xe2\x80\x9cKILLED you, Morgiana! I kill YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm better now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, with a smile--\xe2\x80\x9cI'm better, Mr.\r\nArchibald, now.\xe2\x80\x9d And if the truth must be told, no greater coquette than\r\nMiss Morgiana existed in all Mayfair--no, not among the most fashionable\r\nmistresses of the fashionable valets who frequented the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nbelieved herself to be the most fascinating creature that the world ever\r\nproduced; she never saw a stranger but she tried these fascinations upon\r\nhim; and her charms of manner and person were of that showy sort which\r\nis most popular in this world, where people are wont to admire most that\r\nwhich gives them the least trouble to see; and so you will find a tulip\r\nof a woman to be in fashion when a little humble violet or daisy of\r\ncreation is passed over without remark. Morgiana was a tulip among\r\nwomen, and the tulip fanciers all came flocking round her.\r\n\r\nWell, the said \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI'm better now, Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby\r\nsucceeded in drawing everybody's attention to her lovely self. By the\r\nlatter words Mr. Eglantine was specially inflamed; he glanced at Mr.\r\nWalker, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCapting! didn't I tell you she was a CREECHER? See\r\nher hair, sir: it's as black and as glossy as satting. It weighs fifteen\r\npound, that hair, sir; and I wouldn't let my apprentice--that blundering\r\nMossrose, for instance (hang him!)--I wouldn't let anyone but myself\r\ndress that hair for five hundred guineas! Ah, Miss Morgiana, remember\r\nthat you MAY ALWAYS have Eglantine to dress your hair!--remember that,\r\nthat's all.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this the worthy gentleman began rubbing delicately\r\na little of the Eglantinia into those ambrosial locks, which he loved\r\nwith all the love of a man and an artist.\r\n\r\nAnd as for Morgiana showing her hair, I hope none of my readers will\r\nentertain a bad opinion of the poor girl for doing so. Her locks were\r\nher pride; she acted at the private theatre \xe2\x80\x9chair parts,\xe2\x80\x9d where she\r\ncould appear on purpose to show them in a dishevelled state; and that\r\nher modesty was real, and not affected may be proved by the fact that\r\nwhen Mr. Walker, stepping up in the midst of Eglantine's last speech,\r\ntook hold of a lock of her hair very gently with his hand, she cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and started with all her might. And Mr. Eglantine observed\r\nvery gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cCapting! Miss Crump's hair is to be seen and not to be\r\ntouched, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more it is, Mr. Eglantine!\xe2\x80\x9d said her mamma. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, as it's come\r\nto my turn, I beg the gentleman will be so obliging as to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMUST I?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Walker; and as it was half-past six, and he was\r\nengaged to dinner at the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent Club,\xe2\x80\x9d and as he did not wish to make\r\nEglantine jealous, who evidently was annoyed by his staying, he took his\r\nhat just as Miss Crump's coiffure was completed, and saluting her and\r\nher mamma, left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tip-top swell, I can assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eglantine, nodding after him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca regular bang-up chap, and no MISTAKE. Intimate with the Marquess of\r\nBillingsgate, and Lord Vauxhall, and that set.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's very genteel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Crump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw! I'm sure I think nothing of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana.\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Walker walked towards his club, meditating on the beauties\r\nof Morgiana. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat eyes the girl has! they're as\r\nbig as billiard-balls; and five thousand pounds. Eglantine's in luck!\r\nfive thousand pounds--she can't have it, it's impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Mrs. Crump's front arranged, during the time of which\r\noperation Morgiana sat in perfect contentment looking at the last French\r\nfashions in the Courrier des Dames, and thinking how her pink satin\r\nslip would dye, and make just such a mantilla as that represented in the\r\nengraving--no sooner was Mrs. Crump's front arranged, than both ladies,\r\ntaking leave of Mr. Eglantine, tripped back to the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe neighbourhood, where a very neat green fly was already in waiting,\r\nthe gentleman on the box of which (from a livery-stable in the\r\nneighbourhood) gave a knowing touch to his hat, and a salute with his\r\nwhip, to the two ladies, as they entered the tavern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. W.'s inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man--a driver from Mr. Snaffle's\r\nestablishment; \xe2\x80\x9che's been in and out this score of times, and looking\r\ndown the street for you.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the house, in fact, was Mr. Woolsey,\r\nthe tailor, who had hired the fly, and was engaged to conduct the ladies\r\nthat evening to the play.\r\n\r\nIt was really rather too bad to think that Miss Morgiana, after going to\r\none lover to have her hair dressed, should go with another to the play;\r\nbut such is the way with lovely woman! Let her have a dozen admirers,\r\nand the dear coquette will exercise her power upon them all: and as a\r\nlady, when she has a large wardrobe, and a taste for variety in dress,\r\nwill appear every day in a different costume, so will the young and\r\ngiddy beauty wear her lovers, encouraging now the black whiskers, now\r\nsmiling on the brown, now thinking that the gay smiling rattle of an\r\nadmirer becomes her very well, and now adopting the sad sentimental\r\nmelancholy one, according as her changeful fancy prompts her. Let us not\r\nbe too angry with these uncertainties and caprices of beauty; and depend\r\non it that, for the most part, those females who cry out loudest against\r\nthe flightiness of their sisters, and rebuke their undue encouragement\r\nof this man or that, would do as much themselves if they had the chance,\r\nand are constant, as I am to my coat just now, because I have no other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see Doubleyou, 'Gina dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mamma, addressing that\r\nyoung lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHe's in the bar with your Pa, and has his military coat\r\nwith the king's buttons, and looks like an officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Woolsey's style, his great aim being to look like an army\r\ngent, for many of whom he in his capacity of tailor made those splendid\r\nred and blue coats which characterise our military. As for the royal\r\nbutton, had not he made a set of coats for his late Majesty, George\r\nIV.? and he would add, when he narrated this circumstance, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, Prince\r\nBlucher and Prince Swartzenberg's measure's in the house now; and what's\r\nmore, I've cut for Wellington.\xe2\x80\x9d I believe he would have gone to St.\r\nHelena to make a coat for Napoleon, so great was his ardour. He wore a\r\nblue-black wig, and his whiskers were of the same hue. He was brief and\r\nstern in conversations; and he always went to masquerades and balls in a\r\nfield-marshal's uniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks really quite the thing to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Crump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'Gina; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he's such an odious wig, and the dye of his\r\nwhiskers always comes off on his white gloves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has not their own hair, love,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Crump with a\r\nsigh; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Eglantine's is beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery hairdresser's is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Morgiana, rather contemptuously;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what I can't bear is that their fingers is always so very fat and\r\npudgy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, something had gone wrong with the fair Morgiana. Was it that\r\nshe had but little liking for the one pretender or the other? Was it\r\nthat young Glauber, who acted Romeo in the private theatricals, was far\r\nyounger and more agreeable than either? Or was it, that seeing a\r\nREAL GENTLEMAN, such as Mr. Walker, with whom she had had her first\r\ninterview, she felt more and more the want of refinement in her other\r\ndeclared admirers? Certain, however, it is, that she was very reserved\r\nall the evening, in spite of the attentions of Mr. Woolsey; that she\r\nrepeatedly looked round at the box-door, as if she expected someone to\r\nenter; and that she partook of only a very few oysters, indeed, out of\r\nthe barrel which the gallant tailor had sent down to the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\noff which the party supped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woolsey to his ally, Crump, as they sat together\r\nafter the retirement of the ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was dumb all night. She never\r\nonce laughed at the farce, nor cried at the tragedy, and you know she\r\nlaughs and cries uncommon. She only took half her negus, and not above a\r\nquarter of her beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more she did!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Crump, very calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it must\r\nbe the barber as has been captivating her: he dressed her hair for the\r\nplay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang him, I'll shoot him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woolsey. \xe2\x80\x9cA fat foolish effeminate\r\nbeast like that marry Miss Morgiana? Never! I WILL shoot him. I'll\r\nprovoke him next Saturday--I'll tread on his toe--I'll pull his nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo quarrelling at the 'Kidneys!'\xe2\x80\x9d answered Crump sternly; \xe2\x80\x9cthere shall\r\nbe no quarrelling in that room as long as I'm in the chair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate you'll stand my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I will,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are honourable, and I like\r\nyou better than Eglantine. I trust you more than Eglantine, sir. You're\r\nmore of a man than Eglantine, though you ARE a tailor; and I wish with\r\nall my heart you may get Morgiana. Mrs. C. goes the other way, I know:\r\nbut I tell you what, women will go their own ways, sir, and Morgy's\r\nlike her mother in this point, and depend upon it, Morgy will decide for\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woolsey presently went home, still persisting in his plan for the\r\nassassination of Eglantine. Mr. Crump went to bed very quietly, and\r\nsnored through the night in his usual tone. Mr. Eglantine passed some\r\nfeverish moments of jealousy, for he had come down to the club in the\r\nevening, and had heard that Morgiana was gone to the play with his\r\nrival. And Miss Morgiana dreamed, of a man who was--must we say\r\nit?--exceedingly like Captain Howard Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Captain So-and-so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought she. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do love a gentleman dearly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd about this time, too, Mr. Walker himself came rolling home from\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cRegent,\xe2\x80\x9d hiccupping. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch hair!--such eyebrows!--such eyes! like\r\nb-b-billiard-balls, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. IN WHICH MR. WALKER MAKES THREE ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN THE\r\nDWELLING OF MORGIANA.\r\n\r\nThe day after the dinner at the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent Club,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Walker stepped over\r\nto the shop of his friend the perfumer, where, as usual, the young man,\r\nMr. Mossrose, was established in the front premises.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other, the Captain was particularly good-humoured;\r\nand, quite forgetful of the words which had passed between him and Mr.\r\nEglantine's lieutenant the day before, began addressing the latter with\r\nextreme cordiality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good morning to you, Mr. Mossrose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir,\r\nyou look as fresh as your namesake--you do, indeed, now, Mossrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look ash yellow ash a guinea,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Mr. Mossrose, sulkily. He\r\nthought the Captain was hoaxing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the other, nothing cast down, \xe2\x80\x9cI drank rather too\r\nfreely last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more beast you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mossrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mossrose; the same to you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you call me a beast, I'll punch your head off!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young\r\nman, who had much skill in the art which many of his brethren practise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't, my fine fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to give me the lie?\xe2\x80\x9d broke out the indignant Mossrose, who\r\nhated the agent fiercely, and did not in the least care to conceal his\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was his fixed purpose to pick a quarrel with Walker, and to\r\ndrive him, if possible, from Mr. Eglantine's shop. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to give\r\nme the lie, I say, Mr. Hooker Walker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven's sake, Amos, hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Captain, to\r\nwhom the name of Hooker was as poison; but at this moment a customer\r\nstepping in, Mr. Amos exchanged his ferocious aspect for a bland grin,\r\nand Mr. Walker walked into the studio.\r\n\r\nWhen in Mr. Eglantine's presence, Walker, too, was all smiles in a\r\nminute, sank down on a settee, held out his hand to the perfumer, and\r\nbegan confidentially discoursing with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSUCH a dinner, Tiny my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9csuch prime fellows to eat\r\nit, too! Billingsgate, Vauxhall, Cinqbars, Buff of the Blues, and\r\nhalf-a-dozen more of the best fellows in town. And what do you think the\r\ndinner cost a head? I'll wager you'll never guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it two guineas a head?--In course I mean without wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngenteel perfumer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, was it ten guineas a head? I'll guess any sum you please,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Mr. Eglantine: \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know that when you NOBS are together, you\r\ndon't spare your money. I myself, at the \xe2\x80\x9cStar and Garter\xe2\x80\x9d at Richmond,\r\nonce paid--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteenpence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeighteenpence, sir!--I paid five-and-thirty shillings per 'ead. I'd\r\nhave you to know that I can act as a gentleman as well as any other\r\ngentleman, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the perfumer with much dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, eighteenpence was what WE paid, and not a rap more, upon my\r\nhonour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, you're joking. The Marquess of Billinsgate dine for\r\neighteenpence! Why, hang it, if I was a marquess, I'd pay a five-pound\r\nnote for my lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou little know the person, Master Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain,\r\nwith a smile of contemptuous superiority; \xe2\x80\x9cyou little know the real\r\nman of fashion, my good fellow. Simplicity, sir--simplicity's the\r\ncharacteristic of the real gentleman, and so I'll tell you what we had\r\nfor dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurtle and venison, of course:--no nob dines without THEM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha! we're sick of 'em! We had pea soup and boiled tripe! What do you\r\nthink of THAT? We had sprats and herrings, a bullock's heart, a baked\r\nshoulder of mutton and potatoes, pig's-fry and Irish stew. _I_ ordered\r\nthe dinner, sir, and got more credit for inventing it than they ever\r\ngave to Ude or Soyer. The Marquess was in ecstasies, the Earl devoured\r\nhalf a bushel of sprats, and if the Viscount is not laid up with a\r\nsurfeit of bullock's heart, my name's not Howard Walker. Billy, as I\r\ncall him, was in the chair, and gave my health; and what do you think\r\nthe rascal proposed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat DID his Lordship propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat every man present should subscribe twopence, and pay for my share\r\nof the dinner. By Jove! it is true, and the money was handed to me in\r\na pewter-pot, of which they also begged to make me a present. We\r\nafterwards went to Tom Spring's, from Tom's to the 'Finish,' from the\r\n'Finish' to the watch-house--that is, THEY did--and sent for me, just as\r\nI was getting into bed, to bail them all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey're happy dogs, those young noblemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Eglantine; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\r\nbut pleasure from morning till night; no affectation neither--no HOTURE;\r\nbut manly downright straightforward good fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to meet them, Tiny my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did sir, I hope I should show myself to be gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nMr. Eglantine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you SHALL meet them, and Lady Billingsgate shall order her\r\nperfumes at your shop. We are going to dine, next week, all our set,\r\nat Mealy-faced Bob's, and you shall be my guest,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain,\r\nslapping the delighted artist on the back. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my boy, tell me how\r\nYOU spent the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt my club, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Eglantine, blushing rather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not at the play with the lovely black-eyed Miss--What is her\r\nname, Eglantine?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind her name, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eglantine, partly from prudence\r\nand partly from shame. He had not the heart to own it was Crump, and he\r\ndid not care that the Captain should know more of his destined bride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to keep the five thousand to yourself--eh, you rogue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n responded the Captain, with a good-humoured air, although exceedingly\r\nmortified; for, to say the truth, he had put himself to the trouble\r\nof telling the above long story of the dinner, and of promising to\r\nintroduce Eglantine to the lords, solely that he might elicit from that\r\ngentleman's good-humour some further particulars regarding the young\r\nlady with the billiard-ball eyes. It was for the very same reason, too,\r\nthat he had made the attempt at reconciliation with Mr. Mossrose which\r\nhad just so signally failed. Nor would the reader, did he know Mr. W.\r\nbetter, at all require to have the above explanation; but as yet we are\r\nonly at the first chapter of his history, and who is to know what the\r\nhero's motives can be unless we take the trouble to explain?\r\n\r\nWell, the little dignified answer of the worthy dealer in bergamot,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNEVER MIND HER NAME, CAPTAIN!\xe2\x80\x9d threw the gallant Captain quite aback;\r\nand though he sat for a quarter of an hour longer, and was exceedingly\r\nkind; and though he threw out some skilful hints, yet the perfumer was\r\nquite unconquerable; or, rather, he was too frightened to tell: the\r\npoor fat timid easy good-natured gentleman was always the prey of\r\nrogues,--panting and floundering in one rascal's snare or another's. He\r\nhad the dissimulation, too, which timid men have; and felt the presence\r\nof a victimiser as a hare does of a greyhound. Now he would be quite\r\nstill, now he would double, and now he would run, and then came the end.\r\nHe knew, by his sure instinct of fear, that the Captain had, in asking\r\nthese questions, a scheme against him, and so he was cautious, and\r\ntrembled, and doubted. And oh! how he thanked his stars when Lady\r\nGrogmore's chariot drove up, with the Misses Grogmore, who wanted their\r\nhair dressed, and were going to a breakfast at three o'clock!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll look in again, Tiny,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, on hearing the summons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDO, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other: \xe2\x80\x9cTHANK YOU;\xe2\x80\x9d and went into the lady's\r\nstudio with a heavy heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of the way, you infernal villain!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Captain, with\r\nmany oaths, to Lady Grogmore's large footman, with ruby-coloured tights,\r\nwho was standing inhaling the ten thousand perfumes of the shop; and the\r\nlatter, moving away in great terror, the gallant agent passed out, quite\r\nheedless of the grin of Mr. Mossrose.\r\n\r\nWalker was in a fury at his want of success, and walked down Bond Street\r\nin a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cI WILL know where the girl lives!\xe2\x80\x9d swore he. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll spend a\r\nfive-pound note, by Jove! rather than not know where she lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHAT YOU WOULD--I KNOW YOU WOULD!\xe2\x80\x9d said a little grave low voice, all\r\nof a sudden, by his side. \xe2\x80\x9cPooh! what's money to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalker looked down: it was Tom Dale.\r\n\r\nWho in London did not know little Tom Dale? He had cheeks like an apple,\r\nand his hair curled every morning, and a little blue stock, and always\r\ntwo new magazines under his arm, and an umbrella and a little brown\r\nfrock-coat, and big square-toed shoes with which he went PAPPING down\r\nthe street. He was everywhere at once. Everybody met him every day, and\r\nhe knew everything that everybody ever did; though nobody ever knew what\r\nHE did. He was, they say, a hundred years old, and had never dined at\r\nhis own charge once in those hundred years. He looked like a figure out\r\nof a waxwork, with glassy clear meaningless eyes: he always spoke with\r\na grin; he knew what you had for dinner the day before he met you, and\r\nwhat everybody had had for dinner for a century back almost. He was\r\nthe receptacle of all the scandal of all the world, from Bond Street\r\nto Bread Street; he knew all the authors, all the actors, all the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnotorieties\xe2\x80\x9d of the town, and the private histories of each. That is,\r\nhe never knew anything really, but supplied deficiencies of truth and\r\nmemory with ready-coined, never-failing lies. He was the most benevolent\r\nman in the universe, and never saw you without telling you everything\r\nmost cruel of your neighbour, and when he left you he went to do the\r\nsame kind turn by yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! what's money to you, my dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said little Tom Dale, who had\r\njust come out of Ebers's, where he had been filching an opera-ticket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make it in bushels in the City, you know you do---in thousands.\r\nI saw you go into Eglantine's. Fine business that; finest in London.\r\nFive-shilling cakes of soap, my dear boy. I can't wash with such.\r\nThousands a year that man has made--hasn't he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, Tom, I don't know,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU not know? Don't tell me. You know everything--you agents. You KNOW\r\nhe makes five thousand a year--ay, and might make ten, but you know why\r\nhe don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. Don't humbug a poor old fellow like me. Jews--Amos--fifty per\r\ncent., ay? Why can't he get his money from a good Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI HAVE heard something of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walker, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, by\r\nJove, Tom, you know everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU know everything, my dear boy. You know what a rascally trick that\r\nopera creature served him, poor fellow. Cashmere shawls--Storr and\r\nMortimer's--'Star and Garter.' Much better dine quiet off pea-soup and\r\nsprats--ay? His betters have, as you know very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPea-soup and sprats! What! have you heard of that already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho bailed Lord Billingsgate, hey, you rogue?\xe2\x80\x9d and here Tom gave a\r\nknowing and almost demoniacal grin. \xe2\x80\x9cWho wouldn't go to the 'Finish'?\r\nWho had the piece of plate presented to him filled with sovereigns? And\r\nyou deserved it, my dear boy--you deserved it. They said it was only\r\nhalfpence, but I know better!\xe2\x80\x9d and here Tom went off in a cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walker, inspired with a sudden thought, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, who\r\nknow everything, and are a theatrical man, did you ever know a Miss\r\nDelancy, an actress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt 'Sadler's Wells' in '16? Of course I did. Real name was Budge. Lord\r\nSlapper admired her very much, my dear boy. She married a man by the\r\nname of Crump, his Lordship's black footman, and brought him five\r\nthousand pounds; and they keep the 'Bootjack' public-house in Bunker's\r\nBuildings, and they've got fourteen children. Is one of them handsome,\r\neh, you sly rogue--and is it that which you will give five pounds to\r\nknow? God bless you, my dear dear boy. Jones, my dear friend, how are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, seizing on Jones, Tom Dale left Mr. Walker alone, and proceeded\r\nto pour into Mr. Jones's ear an account of the individual whom he had\r\njust quitted; how he was the best fellow in the world, and Jones KNEW\r\nit; how he was in a fine way of making his fortune; how he had been in\r\nthe Fleet many times, and how he was at this moment employed in looking\r\nout for a young lady of whom a certain great marquess (whom Jones knew\r\nvery well, too) had expressed an admiration.\r\n\r\nBut for these observations, which he did not hear, Captain Walker, it\r\nmay be pronounced, did not care. His eyes brightened up, he marched\r\nquickly and gaily away; and turning into his own chambers opposite\r\nEglantine's, shop, saluted that establishment with a grin of triumph.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn't tell me her name, wouldn't you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nthe luck's with me now, and here goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days after, as Mr. Eglantine, with white gloves and a case of\r\neau-de-Cologne as a present in his pocket, arrived at the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\r\nHotel,\xe2\x80\x9d Little Bunker's Buildings, Berkeley Square (for it must\r\nout--that was the place in which Mr. Crump's inn was situated),\r\nhe paused for a moment at the threshold of the little house of\r\nentertainment, and listened, with beating heart, to the sound of\r\ndelicious music that a well-known voice was uttering within.\r\n\r\nThe moon was playing in silvery brightness down the gutter of the humble\r\nstreet. A \xe2\x80\x9chelper,\xe2\x80\x9d rubbing down one of Lady Smigsmag's carriage-horses,\r\neven paused in his whistle to listen to the strain. Mr. Tressle's man,\r\nwho had been professionally occupied, ceased his tap-tap upon the coffin\r\nwhich he was getting in readiness. The greengrocer (there is always a\r\ngreengrocer in those narrow streets, and he goes out in white Berlin\r\ngloves as a supernumerary footman) was standing charmed at his little\r\ngreen gate; the cobbler (there is always a cobbler too) was drunk, as\r\nusual, of evenings, but, with unusual subordination, never sang except\r\nwhen the refrain of the ditty arrived, when he hiccupped it forth with\r\ntipsy loyalty; and Eglantine leaned against the chequers painted on\r\nthe door-side under the name of Crump, and looked at the red illumined\r\ncurtain of the bar, and the vast well-known shadow of Mrs. Crump's\r\nturban within. Now and again the shadow of that worthy matron's hand\r\nwould be seen to grasp the shadow of a bottle; then the shadow of a\r\ncup would rise towards the turban, and still the strain proceeded.\r\nEglantine, I say, took out his yellow bandanna, and brushed the beady\r\ndrops from his brow, and laid the contents of his white kids on his\r\nheart, and sighed with ecstatic sympathy. The song began,--\r\n\r\n         \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the greenwood tree, [1]\r\n          Come where the dark woods be,\r\n          Dearest, O come with me!\r\n     Let us rove--O my love--O my love!\r\n                             O my-y love!\r\n\r\n(Drunken Cobbler without)\r\n                             O my-y love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeast!\xe2\x80\x9d says Eglantine.\r\n\r\n         \xe2\x80\x9cCome--'tis the moonlight hour,\r\n          Dew is on leaf and flower,\r\n          Come to the linden bower,\r\n     Let us rove--O my love--O my love!\r\n   Let us ro-o-ove, lurlurliety; yes, we'll rove, lurlurliety,\r\n   Through the gro-o-ove, lurlurliety--lurlurli-e-i-e-i-e-i!\r\n\r\n(Cobbler, as usual)--\r\n                             Let us ro-o-ove,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU here?\xe2\x80\x9d says another individual, coming clinking up the street, in\r\na military-cut dress-coat, the buttons whereof shone very bright in the\r\nmoonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cYOU here, Eglantine?--You're always here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Eglantine to his rival the tailor (for he\r\nwas the individual in question); and Woolsey, accordingly, put his\r\nback against the opposite door-post and chequers, so that (with poor\r\nEglantine's bulk) nothing much thicker than a sheet of paper could pass\r\nout or in. And thus these two amorous caryatides kept guard as the song\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cDark is the wood, and wide,\r\n           Dangers, they say, betide;\r\n           But, at my Albert's side,\r\n     Nought, I fear, O my love--O my love!\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome the greenwood tree,\r\n           Welcome the forest tree,\r\n           Dearest, with thee, with thee,\r\n     Nought I fear, O my love--O ma-a-y love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEglantine's fine eyes were filled with tears as Morgiana passionately\r\nuttered the above beautiful words. Little Woolsey's eyes glistened, as\r\nhe clenched his fist with an oath, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cShow me any singing that\r\ncan beat THAT. Cobbler, shut your mouth, or I'll break your head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the cobbler, regardless of the threat, continued to perform the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLurlurliety\xe2\x80\x9d with great accuracy; and when that was ended, both on his\r\npart and Morgiana's, a rapturous knocking of glasses was heard in the\r\nlittle bar, then a great clapping of hands, and finally somebody shouted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrava!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrava!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that word Eglantine turned deadly pale, then gave a start, then a\r\nrush forward, which pinned, or rather cushioned, the tailor against the\r\nwall; then twisting himself abruptly round, he sprang to the door of the\r\nbar, and bounced into that apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHOW ARE YOU, MY NOSEGAY?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the same voice which had shouted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrava!\xe2\x80\x9d It was that of Captain Walker.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock the next morning, a gentleman, with the King's button\r\non his military coat, walked abruptly into Mr. Eglantine's shop, and,\r\nturning on Mr. Mossrose, said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell your master I want to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's in his studio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mossrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, fellow, go and fetch him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mossrose, thinking it must be the Lord Chamberlain, or Doctor\r\nPraetorius at least, walked into the studio, where the perfumer was\r\nseated in a very glossy old silk dressing-gown, his fair hair hanging\r\nover his white face, his double chin over his flaccid whity-brown\r\nshirt-collar, his pea-green slippers on the hob, and on the fire the pot\r\nof chocolate which was simmering for his breakfast. A lazier fellow\r\nthan poor Eglantine it would be hard to find; whereas, on the contrary,\r\nWoolsey was always up and brushed, spick-and-span, at seven o'clock; and\r\nhad gone through his books, and given out the work for the journeymen,\r\nand eaten a hearty breakfast of rashers of bacon, before Eglantine had\r\nput the usual pound of grease to his hair (his fingers were always as\r\ndamp and shiny as if he had them in a pomatum-pot), and arranged his\r\nfigure for the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's a gent wants you in the shop,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Mossrose, leaving the\r\ndoor of communication wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay I'm in bed, Mr. Mossrose; I'm out of sperrets, and really can see\r\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's someone from Vindsor, I think; he's got the royal button,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMossrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's me--Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the little man from the shop.\r\n\r\nMr. Eglantine at this jumped up, made a rush to the door leading to his\r\nprivate apartment, and disappeared in a twinkling. But it must not be\r\nimagined that he fled in order to avoid Mr. Woolsey. He only went away\r\nfor one minute just to put on his belt, for he was ashamed to be seen\r\nwithout it by his rival.\r\n\r\nThis being assumed, and his toilet somewhat arranged, Mr. Woolsey was\r\nadmitted into his private room. And Mossrose would have heard every\r\nword of the conversation between those two gentlemen, had not Woolsey,\r\nopening the door, suddenly pounced on the assistant, taken him by\r\nthe collar, and told him to disappear altogether into the shop: which\r\nMossrose did; vowing he would have his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe subject on which Woolsey had come to treat was an important one.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere's no use disguising from one another\r\nthat we are both of us in love with Miss Morgiana, and that our chances\r\nup to this time have been pretty equal. But that Captain whom you\r\nintroduced, like an ass as you were--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ass, Mr. Woolsey! I'd have you to know, sir, that I'm no more a hass\r\nthan you are, sir; and as for introducing the Captain, I did no such\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, he's got a-poaching into our preserves somehow. He's\r\nevidently sweet upon the young woman, and is a more fashionable chap\r\nthan either of us two. We must get him out of the house, sir--we must\r\ncircumwent him; and THEN, Mr. Eglantine, will be time enough for you and\r\nme to try which is the best man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHE the best man?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Eglantine; \xe2\x80\x9cthe little bald unsightly\r\ntailor-creature! A man with no more soul than his smoothing-hiron!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nperfumer, as may be imagined, did not utter this sentiment aloud, but\r\nexpressed himself quite willing to enter into any HAMICABLE arrangement\r\nby which the new candidate for Miss Crump's favour must be thrown over.\r\nIt was accordingly agreed between the two gentlemen that they should\r\ncoalesce against the common enemy; that they should, by reciting many\r\nperfectly well-founded stories in the Captain's disfavour, influence the\r\nminds of Miss Crump's parents, and of herself, if possible, against this\r\nwolf in sheep's clothing; and that, when they were once fairly rid of\r\nhim, each should be at liberty, as before, to prefer his own claim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of a subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little tailor, turning very red,\r\nand hemming and hawing a great deal. \xe2\x80\x9cI've thought, I say, of a pint,\r\nwhich may be resorted to with advantage at the present juncture, and in\r\nwhich each of us may be useful to the other. An exchange, Mr. Eglantine:\r\ndo you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean an accommodation-bill?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eglantine, whose mind ran a\r\ngood deal on that species of exchange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, nonsense, sir! The name of OUR firm is, I flatter myself, a\r\nlittle more up in the market than some other people's names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to insult the name of Archibald Eglantine, sir? I'd have\r\nyou to know that at three months--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Woolsey, mastering his emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cThere's no use\r\na-quarrelling, Mr. E.: we're not in love with each other, I know that.\r\nYou wish me hanged, or as good, I know that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don't, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do, sir; I tell you, you do! and what's more, I wish the same\r\nto you--transported, at any rate! But as two sailors, when a boat's\r\na-sinking, though they hate each other ever so much, will help and bale\r\nthe boat out; so, sir, let US act: let us be the two sailors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBail, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eglantine, as usual mistaking the drift of the\r\nargument. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll bail no man! If you're in difficulties, I think you had\r\nbetter go to your senior partner, Mr Woolsey.\xe2\x80\x9d And Eglantine's cowardly\r\nlittle soul was filled with a savage satisfaction to think that his\r\nenemy was in distress, and actually obliged to come to HIM for succour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're enough to make Job swear, you great fat stupid lazy old barber!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n roared Mr. Woolsey, in a fury.\r\n\r\nEglantine jumped up and made for the bell-rope. The gallant little\r\ntailor laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no need to call in Betsy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm not a-going to eat\r\nyou, Eglantine; you're a bigger man than me: if you were just to fall on\r\nme, you'd smother me! Just sit still on the sofa and listen to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, pro-ceed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber with a gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen! What's the darling wish of your heart? I know it, sir!\r\nyou've told it to Mr. Tressle, sir, and other gents at the club. The\r\ndarling wish of your heart, sir, is to have a slap-up coat turned out of\r\nthe ateliers of Messrs. Linsey, Woolsey and Company. You said you'd give\r\ntwenty guineas for one of our coats, you know you did! Lord Bolsterton's\r\na fatter man than you, and look what a figure we turn HIM out. Can any\r\nfirm in England dress Lord Bolsterton but us, so as to make his Lordship\r\nlook decent? I defy 'em, sir! We could have given Daniel Lambert a\r\nfigure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I want a coat, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Eglantine, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don't deny it,\r\nthere's some people want a HEAD OF HAIR!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's the very point I was coming to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, resuming the\r\nviolent blush which was mentioned as having suffused his countenance\r\nat the beginning of the conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us have terms of mutual\r\naccommodation. Make me a wig, Mr. Eglantine, and though I never yet cut\r\na yard of cloth except for a gentleman, I'll pledge you my word I'll\r\nmake you a coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILL you, honour bright?\xe2\x80\x9d says Eglantine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonour bright,\xe2\x80\x9d says the tailor. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d and in an instant he drew\r\nfrom his pocket one of those slips of parchment which gentlemen of his\r\nprofession carry, and putting Eglantine into the proper position, began\r\nto take the preliminary observations. He felt Eglantine's heart\r\nthump with happiness as his measure passed over that soft part of the\r\nperfumer's person.\r\n\r\nThen pulling down the window-blind, and looking that the door was\r\nlocked, and blushing still more deeply than ever, the tailor seated\r\nhimself in an arm-chair towards which Mr. Eglantine beckoned him, and,\r\ntaking off his black wig, exposed his head to the great perruquier's\r\ngaze. Mr. Eglantine looked at it, measured it, manipulated it, sat\r\nfor three minutes with his head in his hand and his elbow on his knee,\r\ngazing at the tailor's cranium with all his might, walked round it twice\r\nor thrice, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's enough, Mr. Woolsey. Consider the job\r\nas done. And now, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a greatly relieved air--\xe2\x80\x9cand now,\r\nWoolsey, let us 'ave a glass of curacoa to celebrate this hauspicious\r\nmeeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tailor, however, stiffly replied that he never drank in a morning,\r\nand left the room without offering to shake Mr. Eglantine by the hand:\r\nfor he despised that gentleman very heartily, and himself, too, for\r\ncoming to any compromise with him, and for so far demeaning himself as\r\nto make a coat for a barber.\r\n\r\nLooking from his chambers on the other side of the street, that\r\ninevitable Mr. Walker saw the tailor issuing from the perfumer's shop,\r\nand was at no loss to guess that something extraordinary must be in\r\nprogress when two such bitter enemies met together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. WHAT CAME OF MR WALKER'S DISCOVERY OF THE \xe2\x80\x9cBOOTJACK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to state how the Captain came to take up that proud\r\nposition at the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\xe2\x80\x9d which we have seen him occupy on the evening\r\nwhen the sound of the fatal \xe2\x80\x9cBrava!\xe2\x80\x9d so astonished Mr. Eglantine.\r\n\r\nThe mere entry into the establishment was, of course, not difficult. Any\r\nperson by simply uttering the words \xe2\x80\x9cA pint of beer,\xe2\x80\x9d was free of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBootjack;\xe2\x80\x9d and it was some such watchword that Howard Walker employed\r\nwhen he made his first appearance. He requested to be shown into a\r\nparlour, where he might repose himself for a while, and was ushered into\r\nthat very sanctum where the \xe2\x80\x9cKidney Club\xe2\x80\x9d met. Then he stated that the\r\nbeer was the best he had ever tasted, except in Bavaria, and in some\r\nparts of Spain, he added; and professing to be extremely \xe2\x80\x9cpeckish,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n requested to know if there were any cold meat in the house whereof he\r\ncould make a dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't usually dine at this hour, landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, flinging down\r\na half-sovereign for payment of the beer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your parlour looks so\r\ncomfortable, and the Windsor chairs are so snug, that I'm sure I could\r\nnot dine better at the first club in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cONE of the first clubs in London is held in this very room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCrump, very well pleased; \xe2\x80\x9cand attended by some of the best gents in\r\ntown, too. We call it the 'Kidney Club'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless my soul! it is the very club my friend Eglantine has so\r\noften talked to me about, and attended by some of the tip-top tradesmen\r\nof the metropolis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's better men here than Mr. Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Crump, \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nhe's a good man--I don't say he's not a good man--but there's better.\r\nMr. Clinker, sir; Mr. Woolsey, of the house of Linsey, Woolsey and Co--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great army-clothiers!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Walker; \xe2\x80\x9cthe first house in town!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and so continued, with exceeding urbanity, holding conversation with Mr.\r\nCrump, until the honest landlord retired delighted, and told Mrs. Crump\r\nin the bar that there was a tip-top swell in the \xe2\x80\x9cKidney\xe2\x80\x9d parlour, who\r\nwas a-going to have his dinner there.\r\n\r\nFortune favoured the brave Captain in every way. It was just Mr. Crump's\r\nown dinner-hour; and on Mrs. Crump stepping into the parlour to ask the\r\nguest whether he would like a slice of the joint to which the family\r\nwere about to sit down, fancy that lady's start of astonishment at\r\nrecognising Mr. Eglantine's facetious friend of the day before. The\r\nCaptain at once demanded permission to partake of the joint at the\r\nfamily table; the lady could not with any great reason deny this\r\nrequest; the Captain was inducted into the bar; and Miss Crump, who\r\nalways came down late for dinner, was even more astonished than her\r\nmamma, on beholding the occupier of the fourth place at the table. Had\r\nshe expected to see the fascinating stranger so soon again? I think she\r\nhad. Her big eyes said as much, as, furtively looking up at Mr. Walker's\r\nface, they caught his looks; and then bouncing down again towards her\r\nplate, pretended to be very busy in looking at the boiled beef and\r\ncarrots there displayed. She blushed far redder than those carrots, but\r\nher shining ringlets hid her confusion together with her lovely face.\r\n\r\nSweet Morgiana! the billiard-ball eyes had a tremendous effect on the\r\nCaptain. They fell plump, as it were, into the pocket of his heart; and\r\nhe gallantly proposed to treat the company to a bottle of champagne,\r\nwhich was accepted without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nMr. Crump, under pretence of going to the cellar (where he said he had\r\nsome cases of the finest champagne in Europe), called Dick, the boy,\r\nto him, and despatched him with all speed to a wine merchant's, where a\r\ncouple of bottles of the liquor were procured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring up two bottles, Mr. C.,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Walker gallantly said when Crump\r\nmade his move, as it were, to the cellar and it may be imagined after\r\nthe two bottles were drunk (of which Mrs. Crump took at least nine\r\nglasses to her share), how happy, merry, and confidential the whole\r\nparty had become. Crump told his story of the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d and whose boot\r\nit had drawn; the former Miss Delancy expatiated on her past theatrical\r\nlife, and the pictures hanging round the room. Miss was equally\r\ncommunicative; and, in short, the Captain had all the secrets of the\r\nlittle family in his possession ere sunset. He knew that Miss cared\r\nlittle for either of her suitors, about whom mamma and papa had a little\r\nquarrel. He heard Mrs. Crump talk of Morgiana's property, and fell more\r\nin love with her than ever. Then came tea, the luscious crumpet, the\r\nquiet game at cribbage, and the song--the song which poor Eglantine\r\nheard, and which caused Woolsey's rage and his despair.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the evening the tailor was in a greater rage, and the\r\nperfumer in greater despair than ever. He had made his little present\r\nof eau-de-Cologne. \xe2\x80\x9cOh fie!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, with a horse-laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nSMELLS OF THE SHOP!\xe2\x80\x9d He taunted the tailor about his wig, and the honest\r\nfellow had only an oath to give by way of repartee. He told his stories\r\nabout his club and his lordly friends. What chance had either against\r\nthe all-accomplished Howard Walker?\r\n\r\nOld Crump, with a good innate sense of right and wrong, hated the man;\r\nMrs. Crump did not feel quite at her ease regarding him; but Morgiana\r\nthought him the most delightful person the world ever produced.\r\n\r\nEglantine's usual morning costume was a blue satin neck-cloth\r\nembroidered with butterflies and ornamented with a brandy-ball brooch, a\r\nlight shawl waistcoat, and a rhubarb-coloured coat of the sort which, I\r\nbelieve, are called Taglionis, and which have no waist-buttons, and made\r\na pretence, as it were, to have no waists, but are in reality adopted by\r\nthe fat in order to give them a waist. Nothing easier for an obese man\r\nthan to have a waist; he has but to pinch his middle part a little, and\r\nthe very fat on either side pushed violently forward MAKES a waist,\r\nas it were, and our worthy perfumer's figure was that of a bolster cut\r\nalmost in two with a string.\r\n\r\nWalker presently saw him at his shop-door grinning in this costume,\r\ntwiddling his ringlets with his dumpy greasy fingers, glittering with\r\noil and rings, and looking so exceedingly contented and happy that the\r\nestate-agent felt assured some very satisfactory conspiracy had been\r\nplanned between the tailor and him. How was Mr. Walker to learn what the\r\nscheme was? Alas! the poor fellow's vanity and delight were such, that\r\nhe could not keep silent as to the cause of his satisfaction; and rather\r\nthan not mention it at all, in the fulness of his heart he would have\r\ntold his secret to Mr. Mossrose himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get my coat,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Bond Street Alnaschar, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll hire\r\nof Snaffle that easy-going cream-coloured 'oss that he bought from\r\nAstley's, and I'll canter through the Park, and WON'T I pass through\r\nLittle Bunker's Buildings, that's all? I'll wear my grey trousers with\r\nthe velvet stripe down the side, and get my spurs lacquered up, and a\r\nFrench polish to my boot; and if I don't DO for the Captain, and the\r\ntailor too, my name's not Archibald. And I know what I'll do: I'll hire\r\nthe small clarence, and invite the Crumps to dinner at the 'Gar and\r\nStarter'\xe2\x80\x9d (this was his facetious way of calling the \xe2\x80\x9cStar and Garter\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I'll ride by them all the way to Richmond. It's rather a long ride,\r\nbut with Snaffle's soft saddle I can do it pretty easy, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nso the honest fellow built castles upon castles in the air; and the last\r\nmost beautiful vision of all was Miss Crump \xe2\x80\x9cin white satting, with a\r\nhorange flower in her 'air,\xe2\x80\x9d putting him in possession of \xe2\x80\x9cher lovely\r\n'and before the haltar of St. George's, 'Anover Square.\xe2\x80\x9d As for Woolsey,\r\nEglantine determined that he should have the best wig his art could\r\nproduce; for he had not the least fear of his rival.\r\n\r\nThese points then being arranged to the poor fellow's satisfaction, what\r\ndoes he do but send out for half a quire of pink note-paper, and in a\r\nfilagree envelope despatch a note of invitation to the ladies at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\xe2\x80\x9d:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBOWER OF BLOOM, BOND STREET:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThursday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. ARCHIBALD EGLANTINE presents his compliments to Mrs. and Miss\r\nCrump, and requests the HONOUR AND PLEASURE of their company at the\r\n'Star and Garter' at Richmond to an early dinner on Sunday next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIF AGREEABLE, Mr. Eglantine's carriage will be at your door at three\r\no'clock, and I propose to accompany them on horseback, if agreeable\r\nlikewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis note was sealed with yellow wax, and sent to its destination; and\r\nof course Mr. Eglantine went himself for the answer in the evening: and\r\nof course he told the ladies to look out for a certain new coat he was\r\ngoing to sport on Sunday; and of course Mr. Walker happens to call the\r\nnext day with spare tickets for Mrs. Crump and her daughter, when the\r\nwhole secret was laid bare to him--how the ladies were going to Richmond\r\non Sunday in Mr. Snaffle's clarence, and how Mr. Eglantine was to ride\r\nby their side.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker did not keep horses of his own; his magnificent friends at\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cRegent\xe2\x80\x9d had plenty in their stables, and some of these were at\r\nlivery at the establishment of the Captain's old \xe2\x80\x9ccollege\xe2\x80\x9d companion,\r\nMr. Snaffle. It was easy, therefore, for the Captain to renew his\r\nacquaintance with that individual. So, hanging on the arm of my Lord\r\nVauxhall, Captain Walker next day made his appearance at Snaffle's\r\nlivery-stables, and looked at the various horses there for sale or\r\nat bait, and soon managed, by putting some facetious questions to Mr.\r\nSnaffle regarding the \xe2\x80\x9cKidney Club,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. to place himself on a friendly\r\nfooting with that gentleman, and to learn from him what horse Mr.\r\nEglantine was to ride on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe monster Walker had fully determined in his mind that Eglantine\r\nshould FALL off that horse in the course of his Sunday's ride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sing'lar hanimal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Snaffle, pointing to the old horse,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis the celebrated Hemperor that was the wonder of Hastley's some years\r\nback, and was parted with by Mr. Ducrow honly because his feelin's\r\nwouldn't allow him to keep him no longer after the death of the first\r\nMrs. D., who invariably rode him. I bought him, thinking that p'raps\r\nladies and Cockney bucks might like to ride him (for his haction is\r\nwonderful, and he canters like a harm-chair); but he's not safe on any\r\nday except Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why's that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he safer on Sundays than\r\nother days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBECAUSE THERE'S NO MUSIC in the streets on Sundays. The first gent that\r\nrode him found himself dancing a quadrille in Hupper Brook Street to\r\nan 'urdy-gurdy that was playing 'Cherry Ripe,' such is the natur of the\r\nhanimal. And if you reklect the play of the 'Battle of Hoysterlitz,' in\r\nwhich Mrs. D. hacted 'the female hussar,' you may remember how she\r\nand the horse died in the third act to the toon of 'God preserve the\r\nEmperor,' from which this horse took his name. Only play that toon to\r\nhim, and he rears hisself up, beats the hair in time with his forelegs,\r\nand then sinks gently to the ground as though he were carried off by a\r\ncannon-ball. He served a lady hopposite Hapsley 'Ouse so one day, and\r\nsince then I've never let him out to a friend except on Sunday, when, in\r\ncourse, there's no danger. Heglantine IS a friend of mine, and of course\r\nI wouldn't put the poor fellow on a hanimal I couldn't trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little more conversation, my lord and his friend quitted Mr.\r\nSnaffle's, and as they walked away towards the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent,\xe2\x80\x9d his Lordship\r\nmight be heard shrieking with laughter, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cCapital, by jingo!\r\nexthlent! Dwive down in the dwag! Take Lungly. Worth a thousand pound,\r\nby Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d and similar ejaculations, indicative of exceeding delight.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning, at ten o'clock to a moment, Mr. Woolsey called at\r\nMr. Eglantine's with a yellow handkerchief under his arm. It contained\r\nthe best and handsomest body-coat that ever gentleman put on. It fitted\r\nEglantine to a nicety--it did not pinch him in the least, and yet it was\r\nof so exquisite a cut that the perfumer found, as he gazed delighted\r\nin the glass, that he looked like a manly portly high-bred gentleman--a\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the army, at the very least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a full man, Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, delighted, too, with\r\nhis own work; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that can't be helped. You look more like Hercules\r\nthan Falstaff now, sir, and if a coat can make a gentleman, a gentleman\r\nyou are. Let me recommend you to sink the blue cravat, and take the\r\nstripes off your trousers. Dress quiet, sir; draw it mild. Plain\r\nwaistcoat, dark trousers, black neckcloth, black hat, and if there's a\r\nbetter-dressed man in Europe to-morrow, I'm a Dutchman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Woolsey--thank you, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the charmed perfumer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I'll just trouble you to try on this here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wig had been made with equal skill; it was not in the florid style\r\nwhich Mr. Eglantine loved in his own person, but, as the perfumer said,\r\na simple straightforward head of hair. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as if it had grown\r\nthere all your life, Mr. Woolsey; nobody would tell that it was not\r\nyour nat'ral colour\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Woolsey blushed)--\xe2\x80\x9cit makes you look ten year\r\nyounger; and as for that scarecrow yonder, you'll never, I think, want\r\nto wear that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWoolsey looked in the glass, and was delighted too. The two rivals shook\r\nhands and straightway became friends, and in the overflowing of his\r\nheart the perfumer mentioned to the tailor the party which he had\r\narranged for the next day, and offered him a seat in the carriage and\r\nat the dinner at the \xe2\x80\x9cStar and Garter.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to ride?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEglantine, with rather a consequential air. \xe2\x80\x9cSnaffle will mount you, and\r\nwe can go one on each side of the ladies, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Woolsey humbly said he was not a riding man, and gladly consented to\r\ntake a place in the clarence carriage, provided he was allowed to bear\r\nhalf the expenses of the entertainment. This proposal was agreed to by\r\nMr. Eglantine, and the two gentlemen parted to meet once more at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKidneys\xe2\x80\x9d that night, when everybody was edified by the friendly tone\r\nadopted between them.\r\n\r\nMr. Snaffle, at the club meeting, made the very same proposal to Mr.\r\nWoolsey that the perfumer had made; and stated that as Eglantine was\r\ngoing to ride Hemperor, Woolsey, at least, ought to mount too. But he\r\nwas met by the same modest refusal on the tailor's part, who stated that\r\nhe had never mounted a horse yet, and preferred greatly the use of a\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\nEglantine's character as a \xe2\x80\x9cswell\xe2\x80\x9d rose greatly with the club that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nTwo o'clock on Sunday came: the two beaux arrived punctually at the door\r\nto receive the two smiling ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless us, Mr. Eglantine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crump, quite struck by him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever saw you look so handsome in your life.\xe2\x80\x9d He could have flung his\r\narms around her neck at the compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd law, Ma! what has happened\r\nto Mr. Woolsey? doesn't he look ten years younger than yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d Mamma\r\nassented, and Woolsey bowed gallantly, and the two gentlemen exchanged a\r\nnod of hearty friendship.\r\n\r\nThe day was delightful. Eglantine pranced along magnificently on his\r\ncantering armchair, with his hat on one ear, his left hand on his side,\r\nand his head flung over his shoulder, and throwing under-glances at\r\nMorgiana whenever the \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d was in advance of the clarence. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d pricked up his ears a little uneasily passing the Ebenezer\r\nchapel in Richmond, where the congregation were singing a hymn, but\r\nbeyond this no accident occurred; nor was Mr. Eglantine in the least\r\nstiff or fatigued by the time the party reached Richmond, where he\r\narrived time enough to give his steed into the charge of an ostler, and\r\nto present his elbow to the ladies as they alighted from the clarence\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nWhat this jovial party ate for dinner at the \xe2\x80\x9cStar and Garter\xe2\x80\x9d need\r\nnot here be set down. If they did not drink champagne I am very much\r\nmistaken. They were as merry as any four people in Christendom; and\r\nbetween the bewildering attentions of the perfumer, and the manly\r\ncourtesy of the tailor, Morgiana very likely forgot the gallant Captain,\r\nor, at least, was very happy in his absence.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock they began to drive homewards. \xe2\x80\x9cWON'T you come into the\r\ncarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana to Eglantine, with one of her tenderest looks;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick can ride the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d But Archibald was too great a lover of\r\nequestrian exercise. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid to trust anybody on this horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe with a knowing look; and so he pranced away by the side of the little\r\ncarriage. The moon was brilliant, and, with the aid of the gas-lamps,\r\nilluminated the whole face of the country in a way inexpressibly lovely.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the distance, the sweet and plaintive notes of a bugle\r\nwere heard, and the performer, with great delicacy, executed a religious\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cMusic, too! heavenly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana, throwing up her eyes to the\r\nstars. The music came nearer and nearer, and the delight of the company\r\nwas only more intense. The fly was going at about four miles an hour,\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d began cantering to time at the same rapid pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be some gallantry of yours, Mr. Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the romantic\r\nMorgiana, turning upon that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Eglantine treated us to the\r\ndinner, and you have provided us with the music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Woolsey had been a little, a very little, dissatisfied during the\r\ncourse of the evening's entertainment, by fancying that Eglantine, a\r\nmuch more voluble person than himself, had obtained rather an undue\r\nshare of the ladies' favour; and as he himself paid half of the\r\nexpenses, he felt very much vexed to think that the perfumer should take\r\nall the credit of the business to himself. So when Miss Crump asked if\r\nhe had provided the music, he foolishly made an evasive reply to her\r\nquery, and rather wished her to imagine that he HAD performed that\r\npiece of gallantry. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it pleases YOU, Miss Morgiana,\xe2\x80\x9d said this artful\r\nSchneider, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more need any man ask? wouldn't I have all Drury Lane\r\norchestra to please you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bugle had by this time arrived quite close to the clarence carriage,\r\nand if Morgiana had looked round she might have seen whence the music\r\ncame. Behind her came slowly a drag, or private stage-coach, with\r\nfour horses. Two grooms with cockades and folded arms were behind;\r\nand driving on the box, a little gentleman, with a blue bird's-eye\r\nneckcloth, and a white coat. A bugleman was by his side, who performed\r\nthe melodies which so delighted Miss Crump. He played very gently and\r\nsweetly, and \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King\xe2\x80\x9d trembled so softly out of the brazen\r\norifice of his bugle, that the Crumps, the tailor, and Eglantine\r\nhimself, who was riding close by the carriage, were quite charmed and\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, DEAR Mr. Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grateful Morgiana; which made\r\nEglantine stare, and Woolsey was just saying, \xe2\x80\x9cReally, upon my word,\r\nI've nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d when the man on the drag-box said to the\r\nbugleman, \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bugleman began the tune of--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven preserve our Emperor Fra-an-cis,\r\n      Rum tum-ti-tum-ti-titty-ti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound, the \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d reared himself (with a roar from Mr.\r\nEglantine)--reared and beat the air with his fore-paws. Eglantine flung\r\nhis arms round the beast's neck; still he kept beating time with\r\nhis fore-paws. Mrs. Crump screamed: Mr. Woolsey, Dick, the clarence\r\ncoachman, Lord Vauxhall (for it was he), and his Lordship's two grooms,\r\nburst into a shout of laughter; Morgiana cries \xe2\x80\x9cMercy! mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d Eglantine\r\nyells \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWo!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and a thousand ejaculations of hideous\r\nterror; until, at last, down drops the \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d stone dead in the\r\nmiddle of the road, as if carried off by a cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nFancy the situation, ye callous souls who laugh at the misery of\r\nhumanity, fancy the situation of poor Eglantine under the \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d! He\r\nhad fallen very easy, the animal lay perfectly quiet, and the perfumer\r\nwas to all intents and purposes as dead as the animal. He had not\r\nfainted, but he was immovable with terror; he lay in a puddle, and\r\nthought it was his own blood gushing from him; and he would have lain\r\nthere until Monday morning, if my Lord's grooms, descending, had not\r\ndragged him by the coat-collar from under the beast, who still lay\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay 'Charming Judy Callaghan,' will ye?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Snaffle's man,\r\nthe fly-driver; on which the bugler performed that lively air, and up\r\nstarted the horse, and the grooms, who were rubbing Mr. Eglantine down\r\nagainst a lamp-post, invited him to remount.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was too broken for that. The ladies gladly made room for\r\nhim in the clarence. Dick mounted \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor\xe2\x80\x9d and rode homewards. The\r\ndrag, too, drove away, playing \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, what can the matter be?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwith a scowl of furious hate, Mr. Eglantine sat and regarded his rival.\r\nHis pantaloons were split, and his coat torn up the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you hurt much, dear Mr. Archibald?\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana, with unaffected\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-not much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor fellow, ready to burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d added the good-natured girl, \xe2\x80\x9chow could you play such\r\na trick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d Woolsey began, intending to plead innocence; but the\r\nludicrousness of the situation was once more too much for him, and he\r\nburst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! you cowardly beast!\xe2\x80\x9d howled out Eglantine, now driven to\r\nfury--\xe2\x80\x9cYOU laugh at me, you miserable cretur! Take THAT, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nfell upon him with all his might, and well-nigh throttled the tailor,\r\nand pummelling his eyes, his nose, his ears, with inconceivable\r\nrapidity, wrenched, finally, his wig off his head, and flung it into the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nMorgiana saw that Woolsey had red hair. [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. IN WHICH THE HEROINE HAS A NUMBER MORE LOVERS, AND CUTS A\r\nVERY DASHING FIGURE IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nTwo years have elapsed since the festival at Richmond, which, begun so\r\npeaceably, ended in such general uproar. Morgiana never could be brought\r\nto pardon Woolsey's red hair, nor to help laughing at Eglantine's\r\ndisasters, nor could the two gentlemen be reconciled to one another.\r\nWoolsey, indeed, sent a challenge to the perfumer to meet him with\r\npistols, which the latter declined, saying, justly, that tradesmen had\r\nno business with such weapons; on this the tailor proposed to meet\r\nhim with coats off, and have it out like men, in the presence of their\r\nfriends of the \xe2\x80\x9cKidney Club\xe2\x80\x9d. The perfumer said he would be party to no\r\nsuch vulgar transaction; on which, Woolsey, exasperated, made an oath\r\nthat he would tweak the perfumer's nose so surely as he ever entered the\r\nclub-room; and thus ONE member of the \xe2\x80\x9cKidneys\xe2\x80\x9d was compelled to vacate\r\nhis armchair.\r\n\r\nWoolsey himself attended every meeting regularly, but he did not evince\r\nthat gaiety and good-humour which render men's company agreeable in\r\nclubs. On arriving, he would order the boy to \xe2\x80\x9ctell him when that\r\nscoundrel Eglantine came;\xe2\x80\x9d and, hanging up his hat on a peg, would scowl\r\nround the room, and tuck up his sleeves very high, and stretch, and\r\nshake his fingers and wrists, as if getting them ready for that pull\r\nof the nose which he intended to bestow upon his rival. So prepared, he\r\nwould sit down and smoke his pipe quite silently, glaring at all, and\r\njumping up, and hitching up his coat-sleeves, when anyone entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cKidneys\xe2\x80\x9d did not like this behaviour. Clinker ceased to come.\r\nBustard, the poulterer, ceased to come. As for Snaffle, he also\r\ndisappeared, for Woolsey wished to make him answerable for the\r\nmisbehaviour of Eglantine, and proposed to him the duel which the latter\r\nhad declined. So Snaffle went. Presently they all went, except the\r\ntailor and Tressle, who lived down the street, and these two would\r\nsit and pug their tobacco, one on each side of Crump, the landlord, as\r\nsilent as Indian chiefs in a wigwam. There grew to be more and more room\r\nfor poor old Crump in his chair and in his clothes; the \xe2\x80\x9cKidneys\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\ngone, and why should he remain? One Saturday he did not come down to\r\npreside at the club (as he still fondly called it), and the Saturday\r\nfollowing Tressle had made a coffin for him; and Woolsey, with the\r\nundertaker by his side, followed to the grave the father of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKidneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Crump was now alone in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cHow alone?\xe2\x80\x9d says some innocent\r\nand respected reader. Ah! my dear sir, do you know so little of human\r\nnature as not to be aware that, one week after the Richmond affair,\r\nMorgiana married Captain Walker? That did she privately, of course; and,\r\nafter the ceremony, came tripping back to her parents, as young people\r\ndo in plays, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, dear Pa and Ma, I'm married, and\r\nhere is my husband the Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d Papa and mamma did forgive her, as why\r\nshouldn't they? and papa paid over her fortune to her, which she carried\r\nhome delighted to the Captain. This happened several months before the\r\ndemise of old Crump; and Mrs. Captain Walker was on the Continent with\r\nher Howard when that melancholy event took place; hence Mrs. Crump's\r\nloneliness and unprotected condition. Morgiana had not latterly seen\r\nmuch of the old people; how could she, moving in her exalted sphere,\r\nreceive at her genteel new residence in the Edgware Road the old\r\npublican and his wife?\r\n\r\nBeing, then, alone in the world, Mrs. Crump could not abear, she said,\r\nto live in the house where she had been so respected and happy: so she\r\nsold the goodwill of the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack,\xe2\x80\x9d and, with the money arising from\r\nthis sale and her own private fortune, being able to muster some sixty\r\npounds per annum, retired to the neighbourhood of her dear old \xe2\x80\x9cSadler's\r\nWells,\xe2\x80\x9d where she boarded with one of Mrs. Serle's forty pupils. Her\r\nheart was broken, she said; but, nevertheless, about nine months after\r\nMr. Crump's death, the wallflowers, nasturtiums, polyanthuses, and\r\nconvolvuluses began to blossom under her bonnet as usual; in a year she\r\nwas dressed quite as fine as ever, and now never missed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nsome other place of entertainment, one single night, but was as regular\r\nas the box-keeper. Nay, she was a buxom widow still, and an old flame of\r\nhers, Fisk, so celebrated as pantaloon in Grimaldi's time, but now doing\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cheavy fathers\xe2\x80\x9d at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed to her to exchange her name\r\nfor his.\r\n\r\nBut this proposal the worthy widow declined altogether. To say truth,\r\nshe was exceedingly proud of her daughter, Mrs. Captain Walker. They\r\ndid not see each other much at first; but every now and then Mrs. Crump\r\nwould pay a visit to the folks in Connaught Square; and on the days when\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Captain's\xe2\x80\x9d lady called in the City Road, there was not a single\r\nofficial at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d from the first tragedian down to the call-boy,\r\nwho was not made aware of the fact.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Morgiana carried home her fortune in her own\r\nreticule, and, smiling, placed the money in her husband's lap; and hence\r\nthe reader may imagine, who knows Mr. Walker to be an extremely selfish\r\nfellow, that a great scene of anger must have taken place, and many\r\ncoarse oaths and epithets of abuse must have come from him, when he\r\nfound that five hundred pounds was all that his wife had, although he\r\nhad expected five thousand with her. But, to say the truth, Walker was\r\nat this time almost in love with his handsome rosy good-humoured simple\r\nwife. They had made a fortnight's tour, during which they had been\r\nexceedingly happy; and there was something so frank and touching in the\r\nway in which the kind creature flung her all into his lap, saluting\r\nhim with a hearty embrace at the same time, and wishing that it were a\r\nthousand billion billion times more, so that her darling Howard might\r\nenjoy it, that the man would have been a ruffian indeed could he have\r\nfound it in his heart to be angry with her; and so he kissed her in\r\nreturn, and patted her on the shining ringlets, and then counted over\r\nthe notes with rather a disconsolate air, and ended by locking them up\r\nin his portfolio. In fact, SHE had never deceived him; Eglantine\r\nhad, and he in return had out-tricked Eglantine and so warm were his\r\naffections for Morgiana at this time that, upon my word and honour, I\r\ndon't think he repented of his bargain. Besides, five hundred pounds in\r\ncrisp bank-notes was a sum of money such as the Captain was not in the\r\nhabit of handling every day; a dashing sanguine fellow, he fancied there\r\nwas no end to it, and already thought of a dozen ways by which it should\r\nincrease and multiply into a plum. Woe is me! Has not many a simple soul\r\nexamined five new hundred-pound notes in this way, and calculated their\r\npowers of duration and multiplication?\r\n\r\nThis subject, however, is too painful to be dwelt on. Let us hear what\r\nWalker did with his money. Why, he furnished the house in the Edgware\r\nRoad before mentioned, he ordered a handsome service of plate, he\r\nsported a phaeton and two ponies, he kept a couple of smart maids and\r\na groom foot-boy--in fact, he mounted just such a neat unpretending\r\ngentleman-like establishment as becomes a respectable young couple on\r\ntheir outset in life. \xe2\x80\x9cI've sown my wild oats,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to his\r\nacquaintances; \xe2\x80\x9ca few years since, perhaps, I would have longed to cut\r\na dash, but now prudence is the word; and I've settled every farthing of\r\nMrs. Walker's fifteen thousand on herself.\xe2\x80\x9d And the best proof that the\r\nworld had confidence in him is the fact, that for the articles of plate,\r\nequipage, and furniture, which have been mentioned as being in his\r\npossession, he did not pay one single shilling; and so prudent was he,\r\nthat but for turnpikes, postage-stamps, and king's taxes, he hardly had\r\noccasion to change a five-pound note of his wife's fortune.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Mr. Walker had determined to make his fortune. And\r\nwhat is easier in London? Is not the share-market open to all? Do\r\nnot Spanish and Columbian bonds rise and fall? For what are companies\r\ninvented, but to place thousands in the pockets of shareholders and\r\ndirectors? Into these commercial pursuits the gallant Captain now\r\nplunged with great energy, and made some brilliant hits at first\r\nstarting, and bought and sold so opportunely, that his name began to\r\nrise in the City as a capitalist, and might be seen in the printed list\r\nof directors of many excellent and philanthropic schemes, of which there\r\nis never any lack in London. Business to the amount of thousands was\r\ndone at his agency; shares of vast value were bought and sold under his\r\nmanagement. How poor Mr. Eglantine used to hate him and envy him, as\r\nfrom the door of his emporium (the firm was Eglantine and Mossrose now)\r\nhe saw the Captain daily arrive in his pony-phaeton, and heard of the\r\nstart he had taken in life.\r\n\r\nThe only regret Mrs. Walker had was that she did not enjoy enough of her\r\nhusband's society. His business called him away all day; his business,\r\ntoo, obliged him to leave her of evenings very frequently alone; whilst\r\nhe (always in pursuit of business) was dining with his great friends at\r\nthe club, and drinking claret and champagne to the same end.\r\n\r\nShe was a perfectly good-natured and simple soul, never made him a\r\nsingle reproach; but when he could pass an evening at home with her\r\nshe was delighted, and when he could drive with her in the Park she was\r\nhappy for a week after. On these occasions, and in the fulness of her\r\nheart, she would drive to her mother and tell her story. \xe2\x80\x9cHoward drove\r\nwith me in the Park yesterday, Mamma;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHoward has promised to\r\ntake me to the Opera,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth. And that evening the manager, Mr.\r\nGawler, the first tragedian, Mrs. Serle and her forty pupils, all the\r\nbox-keepers, bonnet-women--nay, the ginger-beer girls themselves at \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWells,\xe2\x80\x9d knew that Captain and Mrs. Walker were at Kensington Gardens,\r\nor were to have the Marchioness of Billingsgate's box at the Opera. One\r\nnight--O joy of joys!--Mrs. Captain Walker appeared in a private box\r\nat \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells.\xe2\x80\x9d That's she with the black ringlets and Cashmere shawl,\r\nsmelling-bottle, and black-velvet gown, and bird of paradise in her hat.\r\nGoodness gracious! how they all acted at her, Gawler and all, and how\r\nhappy Mrs. Crump was! She kissed her daughter between all the acts, she\r\nnodded to all her friends on the stage, in the slips, or in the\r\nreal water; she introduced her daughter, Mrs. Captain Walker, to the\r\nbox-opener; and Melvil Delamere (the first comic), Canterfield (the\r\ntyrant), and Jonesini (the celebrated Fontarabian Statuesque), were all\r\non the steps, and shouted for Mrs. Captain Walker's carriage, and waved\r\ntheir hats, and bowed as the little pony-phaeton drove away. Walker, in\r\nhis moustaches, had come in at the end of the play, and was not a little\r\ngratified by the compliments paid to himself and lady.\r\n\r\nAmong the other articles of luxury with which the Captain furnished\r\nhis house we must not omit to mention an extremely grand piano, which\r\noccupied four-fifths of Mrs. Walker's little back drawing-room, and at\r\nwhich she was in the habit of practising continually. All day and all\r\nnight during Walker's absences (and these occurred all night and all\r\nday), you might hear--the whole street might hear--the voice of the lady\r\nat No. 23, gurgling, and shaking, and quavering, as ladies do when they\r\npractise. The street did not approve of the continuance of the noise;\r\nbut neighbours are difficult to please, and what would Morgiana have had\r\nto do if she had ceased to sing? It would be hard to lock a blackbird in\r\na cage and prevent him from singing too. And so Walker's blackbird, in\r\nthe snug little cage in the Edgware Road, sang and was not unhappy.\r\n\r\nAfter the pair had been married for about a year, the omnibus that\r\npasses both by Mrs. Crump's house near \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d and by Mrs. Walker's\r\nstreet off the Edgware Road, brought up the former-named lady almost\r\nevery day to her daughter. She came when the Captain had gone to his\r\nbusiness; she stayed to a two-o'clock dinner with Morgiana; she drove\r\nwith her in the pony-carriage round the Park; but she never stopped\r\nlater than six. Had she not to go to the play at seven? And, besides,\r\nthe Captain might come home with some of his great friends, and he\r\nalways swore and grumbled much if he found his mother-in-law on the\r\npremises. As for Morgiana, she was one of those women who encourage\r\ndespotism in husbands. What the husband says must be right, because he\r\nsays it; what he orders must be obeyed tremblingly. Mrs. Walker gave up\r\nher entire reason to her lord. Why was it? Before marriage she had been\r\nan independent little person; she had far more brains than her Howard.\r\nI think it must have been his moustaches that frightened her, and caused\r\nin her this humility.\r\n\r\nSelfish husbands have this advantage in maintaining with easy-minded\r\nwives a rigid and inflexible behaviour, viz. that if they DO by any\r\nchance grant a little favour, the ladies receive it with such transports\r\nof gratitude as they would never think of showing to a lord and master\r\nwho was accustomed to give them everything they asked for; and hence,\r\nwhen Captain Walker signified his assent to his wife's prayer that she\r\nshould take a singing-master, she thought his generosity almost divine,\r\nand fell upon her mamma's neck, when that lady came the next day, and\r\nsaid what a dear adorable angel her Howard was, and what ought she not\r\nto do for a man who had taken her from her humble situation, and raised\r\nher to be what she was! What she was, poor soul! She was the wife of a\r\nswindling parvenu gentleman. She received visits from six ladies of her\r\nhusband's acquaintances--two attorneys' ladies, his bill-broker's lady,\r\nand one or two more, of whose characters we had best, if you please,\r\nsay nothing; and she thought it an honour to be so distinguished: as\r\nif Walker had been a Lord Exeter to marry a humble maiden, or a noble\r\nprince to fall in love with a humble Cinderella, or a majestic Jove\r\nto come down from heaven and woo a Semele. Look through the world,\r\nrespectable reader, and among your honourable acquaintances, and say if\r\nthis sort of faith in women is not very frequent? They WILL believe in\r\ntheir husbands, whatever the latter do. Let John be dull, ugly, vulgar,\r\nand a humbug, his Mary Ann never finds it out; let him tell his stories\r\never so many times, there is she always ready with her kind smile; let\r\nhim be stingy, she says he is prudent; let him quarrel with his best\r\nfriend, she says he is always in the right; let him be prodigal, she\r\nsays he is generous, and that his health requires enjoyment; let him\r\nbe idle, he must have relaxation; and she will pinch herself and\r\nher household that he may have a guinea for his club. Yes; and every\r\nmorning, as she wakes and looks at the face, snoring on the pillow by\r\nher side--every morning, I say, she blesses that dull ugly countenance,\r\nand the dull ugly soul reposing there, and thinks both are something\r\ndivine. I want to know how it is that women do not find out their\r\nhusbands to be humbugs? Nature has so provided it, and thanks to her.\r\nWhen last year they were acting the \xe2\x80\x9cMidsummer Night's Dream,\xe2\x80\x9d and all\r\nthe boxes began to roar with great coarse heehaws at Titania hugging\r\nBottom's long long ears--to me, considering these things, it seemed that\r\nthere were a hundred other male brutes squatted round about, and treated\r\njust as reasonably as Bottom was. Their Titanias lulled them to sleep\r\nin their laps, summoned a hundred smiling delicate household fairies to\r\ntickle their gross intellects and minister to their vulgar pleasures;\r\nand (as the above remarks are only supposed to apply to honest women\r\nloving their own lawful spouses) a mercy it is that no wicked Puck is\r\nin the way to open their eyes, and point out their folly. Cui bono? let\r\nthem live on in their deceit: I know two lovely ladies who will read\r\nthis, and will say it is just very likely, and not see in the least,\r\nthat it has been written regarding THEM.\r\n\r\nAnother point of sentiment, and one curious to speculate on. Have\r\nyou not remarked the immense works of art that women get through? The\r\nworsted-work sofas, the counterpanes patched or knitted (but these are\r\namong the old-fashioned in the country), the bushels of pincushions,\r\nthe albums they laboriously fill, the tremendous pieces of music they\r\npractise, the thousand other fiddle-faddles which occupy the attention\r\nof the dear souls--nay, have we not seen them seated of evenings in a\r\nsquad or company, Louisa employed at the worsted-work before mentioned,\r\nEliza at the pincushions, Amelia at card-racks or filagree matches, and,\r\nin the midst, Theodosia with one of the candles, reading out a novel\r\naloud? Ah! my dear sir, mortal creatures must be very hard put to it for\r\namusement, be sure of that, when they are forced to gather together in\r\na company and hear novels read aloud! They only do it because they can't\r\nhelp it, depend upon it: it is a sad life, a poor pastime. Mr. Dickens,\r\nin his American book, tells of the prisoners at the silent prison,\r\nhow they had ornamented their rooms, some of them with a frightful\r\nprettiness and elaboration. Women's fancy-work is of this\r\nsort often--only prison work, done because there was no other\r\nexercising-ground for their poor little thoughts and fingers; and hence\r\nthese wonderful pincushions are executed, these counterpanes woven,\r\nthese sonatas learned. By everything sentimental, when I see two kind\r\ninnocent fresh-cheeked young women go to a piano, and sit down opposite\r\nto it upon two chairs piled with more or less music-books (according to\r\ntheir convenience), and, so seated, go through a set of double-barrelled\r\nvariations upon this or that tune by Herz or Kalkbrenner--I say, far\r\nfrom receiving any satisfaction at the noise made by the performance,\r\nmy too susceptible heart is given up entirely to bleeding for the\r\nperformers. What hours, and weeks, nay, preparatory years of study, has\r\nthat infernal jig cost them! What sums has papa paid, what scoldings has\r\nmamma administered (\xe2\x80\x9cLady Bullblock does not play herself;\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Thomas\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she has naturally the finest ear for music ever known!\xe2\x80\x9d);\r\nwhat evidences of slavery, in a word, are there! It is the condition\r\nof the young lady's existence. She breakfasts at eight, she does\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMangnall's Questions\xe2\x80\x9d with the governess till ten, she practises till\r\none, she walks in the square with bars round her till two, then she\r\npractises again, then she sews or hems, or reads French, or Hume's\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory,\xe2\x80\x9d then she comes down to play to papa, because he likes music\r\nwhilst he is asleep after dinner, and then it is bed-time, and the\r\nmorrow is another day with what are called the same \xe2\x80\x9cduties\xe2\x80\x9d to be gone\r\nthrough. A friend of mine went to call at a nobleman's house the other\r\nday, and one of the young ladies of the house came into the room with a\r\ntray on her head; this tray was to give Lady Maria a graceful carriage.\r\nMon Dieu! and who knows but at that moment Lady Bell was at work with\r\na pair of her dumb namesakes, and Lady Sophy lying flat on a\r\nstretching-board? I could write whole articles on this theme but peace!\r\nwe are keeping Mrs. Walker waiting all the while.\r\n\r\nWell, then, if the above disquisitions have anything to do with the\r\nstory, as no doubt they have, I wish it to be understood that, during\r\nher husband's absence, and her own solitary confinement, Mrs. Howard\r\nWalker bestowed a prodigious quantity of her time and energy on the\r\ncultivation of her musical talent; and having, as before stated, a very\r\nfine loud voice, speedily attained no ordinary skill in the use of it.\r\nShe first had for teacher little Podmore, the fat chorus-master at \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWells,\xe2\x80\x9d and who had taught her mother the \xe2\x80\x9cTink-a-tink\xe2\x80\x9d song which has\r\nbeen such a favourite since it first appeared. He grounded her well, and\r\nbade her eschew the singing of all those \xe2\x80\x9cEagle Tavern\xe2\x80\x9d ballads in which\r\nher heart formerly delighted; and when he had brought her to a certain\r\npoint of skill, the honest little chorus-master said she should have a\r\nstill better instructor, and wrote a note to Captain Walker (enclosing\r\nhis own little account), speaking in terms of the most flattering\r\nencomium of his lady's progress, and recommending that she should take\r\nlessons of the celebrated Baroski. Captain Walker dismissed Podmore\r\nthen, and engaged Signor Baroski, at a vast expense; as he did not fail\r\nto tell his wife. In fact, he owed Baroski no less than two hundred and\r\ntwenty guineas when he was--But we are advancing matters.\r\n\r\nLittle Baroski is the author of the opera of \xe2\x80\x9cEliogabalo,\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\noratorio of \xe2\x80\x9cPurgatorio,\xe2\x80\x9d which made such an immense sensation, of songs\r\nand ballet-musics innumerable. He is a German by birth, and shows such\r\nan outrageous partiality for pork and sausages, and attends at church so\r\nconstantly, that I am sure there cannot be any foundation in the story\r\nthat he is a member of the ancient religion. He is a fat little man,\r\nwith a hooked nose and jetty whiskers, and coal-black shining eyes, and\r\nplenty of rings and jewels on his fingers and about his person, and a\r\nvery considerable portion of his shirtsleeves turned over his coat to\r\ntake the air. His great hands (which can sprawl over half a piano, and\r\nproduce those effects on the instrument for which he is celebrated) are\r\nencased in lemon-coloured kids, new, or cleaned daily. Parenthetically,\r\nlet us ask why so many men, with coarse red wrists and big hands,\r\npersist in the white kid glove and wristband system? Baroski's gloves\r\nalone must cost him a little fortune; only he says with a leer, when\r\nasked the question, \xe2\x80\x9cGet along vid you; don't you know dere is a\r\ngloveress that lets me have dem very sheap?\xe2\x80\x9d He rides in the Park; has\r\nsplendid lodgings in Dover Street; and is a member of the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent Club,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n where he is a great source of amusement to the members, to whom he tells\r\nastonishing stories of his successes with the ladies, and for whom he\r\nhas always play and opera tickets in store. His eye glistens and his\r\nlittle heart beats when a lord speaks to him; and he has been known to\r\nspend large sums of money in giving treats to young sprigs of fashion at\r\nRichmond and elsewhere. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my bolyticks,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI am consarevatiff\r\nto de bag-bone.\xe2\x80\x9d In fine, he is a puppy, and withal a man of\r\nconsiderable genius in his profession.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, then, undertook to complete the musical education\r\nof Mrs. Walker. He expressed himself at once \xe2\x80\x9censhanted vid her\r\ngababilities,\xe2\x80\x9d found that the extent of her voice was \xe2\x80\x9cbrodigious,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nguaranteed that she should become a first-rate singer. The pupil was\r\napt, the master was exceedingly skilful; and, accordingly, Mrs. Walker's\r\nprogress was very remarkable: although, for her part, honest Mrs. Crump,\r\nwho used to attend her daughter's lessons, would grumble not a little at\r\nthe new system, and the endless exercises which she, Morgiana, was made\r\nto go through. It was very different in HER time, she said. Incledon\r\nknew no music, and who could sing so well now? Give her a good English\r\nballad: it was a thousand times sweeter than your \xe2\x80\x9cFigaros\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSemiramides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of these objections, however, and with amazing perseverance and\r\ncheerfulness, Mrs. Walker pursued the method of study pointed out to her\r\nby her master. As soon as her husband went to the City in the morning\r\nher operations began; if he remained away at dinner, her labours still\r\ncontinued: nor is it necessary for me to particularise her course of\r\nstudy, nor, indeed, possible; for, between ourselves, none of the\r\nmale Fitz-Boodles ever could sing a note, and the jargon of scales and\r\nsolfeggios is quite unknown to me. But as no man can have seen persons\r\naddicted to music without remarking the prodigious energies they display\r\nin the pursuit, as there is no father of daughters, however ignorant,\r\nbut is aware of the piano-rattling and voice-exercising which go on in\r\nhis house from morning till night, so let all fancy, without further\r\ninquiry, how the heroine of our story was at this stage of her existence\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nWalker was delighted with her progress, and did everything but pay\r\nBaroski, her instructor. We know why he didn't pay. It was his nature\r\nnot to pay bills, except on extreme compulsion; but why did not Baroski\r\nemploy that extreme compulsion? Because, if he had received his money,\r\nhe would have lost his pupil, and because he loved his pupil more than\r\nmoney. Rather than lose her, he would have given her a guinea as well\r\nas her cachet. He would sometimes disappoint a great personage, but he\r\nnever missed his attendance on HER; and the truth must out, that he was\r\nin love with her, as Woolsey and Eglantine had been before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the immortel Chofe!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cdat letell ding sents me mad vid\r\nher big ice! But only vait avile: in six veeks I can bring any voman\r\nin England on her knees to me and you shall see vat I vill do vid my\r\nMorgiana.\xe2\x80\x9d He attended her for six weeks punctually, and yet Morgiana\r\nwas never brought down on her knees; he exhausted his best stock of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgomblimends,\xe2\x80\x9d and she never seemed disposed to receive them with\r\nanything but laughter. And, as a matter of course, he only grew more\r\ninfatuated with the lovely creature who was so provokingly good-humoured\r\nand so laughingly cruel.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Baroski was one of the chief ornaments of the musical\r\nprofession in London; he charged a guinea for a lesson of three-quarters\r\nof an hour abroad, and he had, furthermore, a school at his own\r\nresidence, where pupils assembled in considerable numbers, and of that\r\ncurious mixed kind which those may see who frequent these places of\r\ninstruction. There were very innocent young ladies with their mammas,\r\nwho would hurry them off trembling to the farther corner of the room\r\nwhen certain doubtful professional characters made their appearance.\r\nThere was Miss Grigg, who sang at the \xe2\x80\x9cFoundling,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Johnson,\r\nwho sang at the \xe2\x80\x9cEagle Tavern,\xe2\x80\x9d and Madame Fioravanti (a very doubtful\r\ncharacter), who sang nowhere, but was always coming out at the Italian\r\nOpera. There was Lumley Limpiter (Lord Tweedledale's son), one of the\r\nmost accomplished tenors in town, and who, we have heard, sings with\r\nthe professionals at a hundred concerts; and with him, too, was Captain\r\nGuzzard, of the Guards, with his tremendous bass voice, which all the\r\nworld declared to be as fine as Porto's, and who shared the applause of\r\nBaroski's school with Mr. Bulger, the dentist of Sackville Street, who\r\nneglected his ivory and gold plates for his voice, as every unfortunate\r\nindividual will do who is bitten by the music mania. Then among\r\nthe ladies there were a half-score of dubious pale governesses and\r\nprofessionals with turned frocks and lank damp bandeaux of hair under\r\nshabby little bonnets; luckless creatures these, who were parting with\r\ntheir poor little store of half-guineas to be enabled to say they were\r\npupils of Signor Baroski, and so get pupils of their own among the\r\nBritish youths, or employment in the choruses of the theatres.\r\n\r\nThe prima donna of the little company was Amelia Larkins, Baroski's own\r\narticled pupil, on whose future reputation the eminent master staked his\r\nown, whose profits he was to share, and whom he had farmed, to this end,\r\nfrom her father, a most respectable sheriff's officer's assistant, and\r\nnow, by his daughter's exertions, a considerable capitalist. Amelia is\r\nblonde and blue-eyed, her complexion is as bright as snow, her ringlets\r\nof the colour of straw, her figure--but why describe her figure? Has not\r\nall the world seen her at the Theatres Royal and in America under the\r\nname of Miss Ligonier?\r\n\r\nUntil Mrs. Walker arrived, Miss Larkins was the undisputed princess of\r\nthe Baroski company--the Semiramide, the Rosina, the Tamina, the Donna\r\nAnna. Baroski vaunted her everywhere as the great rising genius of the\r\nday, bade Catalani look to her laurels, and questioned whether Miss\r\nStephens could sing a ballad like his pupil. Mrs. Howard Walker arrived,\r\nand created, on the first occasion, no small sensation. She improved,\r\nand the little society became speedily divided into Walkerites and\r\nLarkinsians; and between these two ladies (as indeed between Guzzard and\r\nBulger before mentioned, between Miss Brunck and Miss Horsman, the two\r\ncontraltos, and between the chorus-singers, after their kind) a great\r\nrivalry arose. Larkins was certainly the better singer; but could\r\nher straw-coloured curls and dumpy high-shouldered figure bear any\r\ncomparison with the jetty ringlets and stately form of Morgiana? Did not\r\nMrs. Walker, too, come to the music-lesson in her carriage, and with a\r\nblack velvet gown and Cashmere shawl, while poor Larkins meekly stepped\r\nfrom Bell Yard, Temple Bar, in an old print gown and clogs, which she\r\nleft in the hall? \xe2\x80\x9cLarkins sing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Crump, sarcastically; \xe2\x80\x9cI'm\r\nsure she ought; her mouth's big enough to sing a duet.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Larkins had\r\nno one to make epigrams in her behoof; her mother was at home tending\r\nthe younger ones, her father abroad following the duties of his\r\nprofession; she had but one protector, as she thought, and that one\r\nwas Baroski. Mrs. Crump did not fail to tell Lumley Limpiter of her own\r\nformer triumphs, and to sing him \xe2\x80\x9cTink-a-tink,\xe2\x80\x9d which we have previously\r\nheard, and to state how in former days she had been called the\r\nRavenswing. And Lumley, on this hint, made a poem, in which he compared\r\nMorgiana's hair to the plumage of the Raven's wing, and Larkinissa's to\r\nthat of the canary; by which two names the ladies began soon to be known\r\nin the school.\r\n\r\nEre long the flight of the Ravenswing became evidently stronger, whereas\r\nthat of the canary was seen evidently to droop. When Morgiana sang, all\r\nthe room would cry \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d when Amelia performed, scarce a hand\r\nwas raised for applause of her, except Morgiana's own, and that the\r\nLarkinses thought was lifted in odious triumph, rather than in sympathy,\r\nfor Miss L. was of an envious turn, and little understood the generosity\r\nof her rival.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day, the crowning victory of the Ravenswing came. In the\r\ntrio of Baroski's own opera of \xe2\x80\x9cEliogabalo,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRosy lips and rosy wine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Miss Larkins, who was evidently unwell, was taking the part of the\r\nEnglish captive, which she had sung in public concerts before royal\r\ndukes, and with considerable applause, and, from some reason, performed\r\nit so ill, that Baroski, slapping down the music on the piano in a fury,\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Howard Walker, as Miss Larkins cannot sing to-day, will\r\nyou favour us by taking the part of Boadicetta?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Walker got up\r\nsmilingly to obey--the triumph was too great to be withstood; and, as\r\nshe advanced to the piano, Miss Larkins looked wildly at her, and stood\r\nsilent for a while, and, at last, shrieked out, \xe2\x80\x9cBENJAMIN!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of\r\nextreme agony, and dropped fainting down on the ground. Benjamin looked\r\nextremely red, it must be confessed, at being thus called by what\r\nwe shall denominate his Christian name, and Limpiter looked round at\r\nGuzzard, and Miss Brunck nudged Miss Horsman, and the lesson concluded\r\nrather abruptly that day; for Miss Larkins was carried off to the next\r\nroom, laid on a couch, and sprinkled with water.\r\n\r\nGood-natured Morgiana insisted that her mother should take Miss Larkins\r\nto Bell Yard in her carriage, and went herself home on foot; but I don't\r\nknow that this piece of kindness prevented Larkins from hating her. I\r\nshould doubt if it did.\r\n\r\nHearing so much of his wife's skill as a singer, the astute Captain\r\nWalker determined to take advantage of it for the purpose of increasing\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cconnection.\xe2\x80\x9d He had Lumley Limpiter at his house before long, which\r\nwas, indeed, no great matter, for honest Lum would go anywhere for a\r\ngood dinner--and an opportunity to show off his voice afterwards,\r\nand Lumley was begged to bring any more clerks in the Treasury of his\r\nacquaintance; Captain Guzzard was invited, and any officers of the\r\nGuards whom he might choose to bring; Bulger received occasional\r\ncards:--in a word, and after a short time, Mrs. Howard Walker's\r\nmusical parties began to be considerably suivies. Her husband had the\r\nsatisfaction to see his rooms filled by many great personages; and once\r\nor twice in return (indeed, whenever she was wanted, or when people\r\ncould not afford to hire the first singers) she was asked to parties\r\nelsewhere, and treated with that killing civility which our English\r\naristocracy knows how to bestow on artists. Clever and wise aristocracy!\r\nIt is sweet to mark your ways, and study your commerce with inferior\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI was just going to commence a tirade regarding the aristocracy\r\nhere, and to rage against that cool assumption of superiority which\r\ndistinguishes their lordships' commerce with artists of all sorts: that\r\npoliteness which, if it condescends to receive artists at all, takes\r\ncare to have them altogether, so that there can be no mistake about\r\ntheir rank--that august patronage of art which rewards it with a silly\r\nflourish of knighthood, to be sure, but takes care to exclude it from\r\nany contact with its betters in society--I was, I say, just going to\r\ncommence a tirade against the aristocracy for excluding artists from\r\ntheir company, and to be extremely satirical upon them, for instance,\r\nfor not receiving my friend Morgiana, when it suddenly came into my head\r\nto ask, was Mrs. Walker fit to move in the best society?--to which query\r\nit must humbly be replied that she was not. Her education was not such\r\nas to make her quite the equal of Baker Street. She was a kind honest\r\nand clever creature; but, it must be confessed, not refined. Wherever\r\nshe went she had, if not the finest, at any rate the most showy gown\r\nin the room; her ornaments were the biggest; her hats, toques, berets,\r\nmarabouts, and other fallals, always the most conspicuous. She drops\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ch's\xe2\x80\x9d here and there. I have seen her eat peas with a knife (and Walker,\r\nscowling on the opposite side of the table, striving in vain to catch\r\nher eye); and I shall never forget Lady Smigsmag's horror when she\r\nasked for porter at dinner at Richmond, and began to drink it out of the\r\npewter pot. It was a fine sight. She lifted up the tankard with one of\r\nthe finest arms, covered with the biggest bracelets ever seen; and had\r\na bird of paradise on her head, that curled round the pewter disc of the\r\npot as she raised it, like a halo. These peculiarities she had, and has\r\nstill. She is best away from the genteel world, that is the fact. When\r\nshe says that \xe2\x80\x9cThe weather is so 'ot that it is quite debiliating;\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nshe laughs, when she hits her neighbour at dinner on the side of the\r\nwaistcoat (as she will if he should say anything that amuses her), she\r\ndoes what is perfectly natural and unaffected on her part, but what\r\nis not customarily done among polite persons, who can sneer at her\r\nodd manners and her vanity, but don't know the kindness, honesty, and\r\nsimplicity which distinguish her. This point being admitted, it follows,\r\nof course, that the tirade against the aristocracy would, in the present\r\ninstance, be out of place--so it shall be reserved for some other\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe Ravenswing was a person admirably disposed by nature to be happy.\r\nShe had a disposition so kindly that any small attention would satisfy\r\nit; was pleased when alone; was delighted in a crowd; was charmed with\r\na joke, however old; was always ready to laugh, to sing, to dance, or to\r\nbe merry; was so tender-hearted that the smallest ballad would make her\r\ncry: and hence was supposed, by many persons, to be extremely affected,\r\nand by almost all to be a downright coquette. Several competitors for\r\nher favour presented themselves besides Baroski. Young dandies used to\r\ncanter round her phaeton in the park, and might be seen haunting her\r\ndoors in the mornings. The fashionable artist of the day made a drawing\r\nof her, which was engraved and sold in the shops; a copy of it was\r\nprinted in a song, \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-eyed Maiden of Araby,\xe2\x80\x9d the words by Desmond\r\nMulligan, Esquire, the music composed and dedicated to MRS. HOWARD\r\nWALKER, by her most faithful and obliged servant, Benjamin Baroski; and\r\nat night her Opera-box was full. Her Opera-box? Yes, the heiress of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBootjack\xe2\x80\x9d actually had an Opera-box, and some of the most fashionable\r\nmanhood of London attended it.\r\n\r\nNow, in fact, was the time of her greatest prosperity; and her husband\r\ngathering these fashionable characters about him, extended his \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n considerably, and began to thank his stars that he had married a woman\r\nwho was as good as a fortune to him.\r\n\r\nIn extending his agency, however, Mr. Walker increased his expenses\r\nproportionably, and multiplied his debts accordingly. More furniture and\r\nmore plate, more wines and more dinner-parties, became necessary; the\r\nlittle pony-phaeton was exchanged for a brougham of evenings; and we may\r\nfancy our old friend Mr. Eglantine's rage and disgust, as he looked from\r\nthe pit of the Opera, to see Mrs. Walker surrounded by what he called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe swell young nobs\xe2\x80\x9d about London, bowing to my Lord, and laughing\r\nwith his Grace, and led to carriage by Sir John.\r\n\r\nThe Ravenswing's position at this period was rather an exceptional\r\none. She was an honest woman, visited by that peculiar class of our\r\naristocracy who chiefly associate with ladies who are NOT honest. She\r\nlaughed with all, but she encouraged none. Old Crump was constantly at\r\nher side now when she appeared in public, the most watchful of mammas,\r\nalways awake at the Opera, though she seemed to be always asleep; but no\r\ndandy debauchee could deceive her vigilance, and for this reason Walker,\r\nwho disliked her (as every man naturally will, must, and should dislike\r\nhis mother-in-law), was contented to suffer her in his house to act as a\r\nchaperon to Morgiana.\r\n\r\nNone of the young dandies ever got admission of mornings to the little\r\nmansion in the Edgware Road; the blinds were always down; and though you\r\nmight hear Morgiana's voice half across the Park as she was practising,\r\nyet the youthful hall-porter in the sugar-loaf buttons was instructed to\r\ndeny her, and always declared that his mistress was gone out, with the\r\nmost admirable assurance.\r\n\r\nAfter some two years of her life of splendour, there were, to be sure, a\r\ngood number of morning visitors, who came with SINGLE knocks, and asked\r\nfor Captain Walker; but these were no more admitted than the dandies\r\naforesaid, and were referred, generally, to the Captain's office,\r\nwhither they went or not at their convenience. The only man who obtained\r\nadmission into the house was Baroski, whose cab transported him thrice\r\na week to the neighbourhood of Connaught Square, and who obtained ready\r\nentrance in his professional capacity.\r\n\r\nBut even then, and much to the wicked little music-master's\r\ndisappointment, the dragon Crump was always at the piano, with her\r\nendless worsted work, or else reading her unfailing Sunday Times; and\r\nBaroski could only employ \xe2\x80\x9cde langvitch of de ice,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called it,\r\nwith his fair pupil, who used to mimic his manner of rolling his eyes\r\nabout afterwards, and perform \xe2\x80\x9cBaroski in love\xe2\x80\x9d for the amusement of her\r\nhusband and her mamma. The former had his reasons for overlooking the\r\nattentions of the little music-master; and as for the latter, had she\r\nnot been on the stage, and had not many hundreds of persons, in jest or\r\nearnest, made love to her? What else can a pretty woman expect who is\r\nmuch before the public? And so the worthy mother counselled her daughter\r\nto bear these attentions with good humour, rather than to make them a\r\nsubject of perpetual alarm and quarrel.\r\n\r\nBaroski, then, was allowed to go on being in love, and was never in the\r\nleast disturbed in his passion; and if he was not successful, at least\r\nthe little wretch could have the pleasure of HINTING that he was, and\r\nlooking particularly roguish when the Ravenswing was named, and assuring\r\nhis friends at the club, that \xe2\x80\x9cupon his vort dere vas no trut IN DAT\r\nREBORT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last one day it happened that Mrs. Crump did not arrive in time for\r\nher daughter's lesson (perhaps it rained and the omnibus was full--a\r\nsmaller circumstance than that has changed a whole life ere now)--Mrs.\r\nCrump did not arrive, and Baroski did, and Morgiana, seeing no great\r\nharm, sat down to her lesson as usual, and in the midst of it down\r\nwent the music-master on his knees, and made a declaration in the most\r\neloquent terms he could muster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't be a fool, Baroski!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady--(I can't help it if her\r\nlanguage was not more choice, and if she did not rise with cold dignity,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cUnhand me, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d)--\xe2\x80\x9cDon't be a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Walker,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut get up and let's finish the lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hard-hearted adorable little greature, vill you not listen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I vill not listen to you, Benjamin!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up\r\nand take a chair, and don't go on in that ridiklous way, don't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Baroski, having a speech by heart, determined to deliver himself\r\nof it in that posture, and begged Morgiana not to turn avay her divine\r\nhice, and to listen to de voice of his despair, and so forth; he seized\r\nthe lady's hand, and was going to press it to his lips, when she said,\r\nwith more spirit, perhaps, than grace,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave go my hand, sir; I'll box your ears if you don't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Baroski wouldn't release her hand, and was proceeding to imprint\r\na kiss upon it; and Mrs. Crump, who had taken the omnibus at a\r\nquarter-past twelve instead of that at twelve, had just opened the\r\ndrawing-room door and was walking in, when Morgiana, turning as red as\r\na peony, and unable to disengage her left hand, which the musician held,\r\nraised up her right hand, and, with all her might and main, gave her\r\nlover such a tremendous slap in the face as caused him abruptly to\r\nrelease the hand which he held, and would have laid him prostrate on\r\nthe carpet but for Mrs. Crump, who rushed forward and prevented him from\r\nfalling by administering right and left a whole shower of slaps, such as\r\nhe had never endured since the day he was at school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat imperence!\xe2\x80\x9d said that worthy lady; \xe2\x80\x9cyou'll lay hands on my\r\ndaughter, will you? (one, two). You'll insult a woman in distress, will\r\nyou, you little coward? (one, two). Take that, and mind your manners,\r\nyou filthy monster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaroski bounced up in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Chofe, you shall hear of dis!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\r\nhe; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall pay me dis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs many more as you please, little Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the widow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugustus\xe2\x80\x9d (to the page), \xe2\x80\x9cwas that the Captain's knock?\xe2\x80\x9d At this\r\nBaroski made for his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cAugustus, show this imperence to the door;\r\nand if he tries to come in again, call a policeman: do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe music-master vanished very rapidly, and the two ladies, instead of\r\nbeing frightened or falling into hysterics, as their betters would have\r\ndone, laughed at the odious monster's discomfiture, as they called him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a man as that set himself up against my Howard!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana,\r\nwith becoming pride; but it was agreed between them that Howard should\r\nknow nothing of what had occurred, for fear of quarrels, or lest he\r\nshould be annoyed. So when he came home not a word was said; and only\r\nthat his wife met him with more warmth than usual, you could not have\r\nguessed that anything extraordinary had occurred. It is not my fault\r\nthat my heroine's sensibilities were not more keen, that she had not the\r\nleast occasion for sal-volatile or symptom of a fainting fit; but so it\r\nwas, and Mr. Howard Walker knew nothing of the quarrel between his wife\r\nand her instructor until--\r\n\r\nUntil he was arrested next day at the suit of Benjamin Baroski for two\r\nhundred and twenty guineas, and, in default of payment, was conducted by\r\nMr. Tobias Larkins to his principal's lock-up house in Chancery Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. IN WHICH MR. WALKER FALLS INTO DIFFICULTIES, AND MRS. WALKER\r\nMAKES MANY FOOLISH ATTEMPTS TO RESCUE HIM.\r\n\r\nI hope the beloved reader is not silly enough to imagine that Mr.\r\nWalker, on finding himself inspunged for debt in Chancery Lane, was\r\nso foolish as to think of applying to any of his friends (those great\r\npersonages who have appeared every now and then in the course of this\r\nlittle history, and have served to give it a fashionable air). No, no;\r\nhe knew the world too well; and that, though Billingsgate would give him\r\nas many dozen of claret as he could carry away under his belt, as the\r\nphrase is (I can't help it, madam, if the phrase is not more genteel),\r\nand though Vauxhall would lend him his carriage, slap him on the back,\r\nand dine at his house,--their lordships would have seen Mr. Walker\r\ndepending from a beam in front of the Old Bailey rather than have helped\r\nhim to a hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAnd why, forsooth, should we expect otherwise in the world? I observe\r\nthat men who complain of its selfishness are quite as selfish as the\r\nworld is, and no more liberal of money than their neighbours; and I am\r\nquite sure with regard to Captain Walker that he would have treated a\r\nfriend in want exactly as he when in want was treated. There was only\r\nhis lady who was in the least afflicted by his captivity; and as for the\r\nclub, that went on, we are bound to say, exactly as it did on the day\r\nprevious to his disappearance.\r\n\r\nBy the way, about clubs--could we not, but for fear of detaining the\r\nfair reader too long, enter into a wholesome dissertation here on the\r\nmanner of friendship established in those institutions, and the noble\r\nfeeling of selfishness which they are likely to encourage in the male\r\nrace? I put out of the question the stale topics of complaint, such as\r\nleaving home, encouraging gormandising and luxurious habits, etc.; but\r\nlook also at the dealings of club-men with one another. Look at the rush\r\nfor the evening paper! See how Shiverton orders a fire in the dog-days,\r\nand Swettenham opens the windows in February. See how Cramley takes\r\nthe whole breast of the turkey on his plate, and how many times Jenkins\r\nsends away his beggarly half-pint of sherry! Clubbery is organised\r\negotism. Club intimacy is carefully and wonderfully removed from\r\nfriendship. You meet Smith for twenty years, exchange the day's news\r\nwith him, laugh with him over the last joke, grow as well acquainted as\r\ntwo men may be together--and one day, at the end of the list of members\r\nof the club, you read in a little paragraph by itself, with all the\r\nhonours,\r\n\r\n     MEMBER DECEASED.\r\n     Smith, John, Esq.;\r\n\r\nor he, on the other hand, has the advantage of reading your own name\r\nselected for a similar typographical distinction. There it is, that\r\nabominable little exclusive list at the end of every club-catalogue--you\r\ncan't avoid it. I belong to eight clubs myself, and know that one year\r\nFitz-Boodle, George Savage, Esq. (unless it should please fate to remove\r\nmy brother and his six sons, when of course it would be Fitz-Boodle, Sir\r\nGeorge Savage, Bart.), will appear in the dismal category. There is that\r\nlist; down I must go in it:--the day will come, and I shan't be seen in\r\nthe bow-window, someone else will be sitting in the vacant armchair:\r\nthe rubber will begin as usual, and yet somehow Fitz will not be there.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's Fitz?\xe2\x80\x9d says Trumpington, just arrived from the Rhine. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't\r\nyou know?\xe2\x80\x9d says Punter, turning down his thumb to the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou led\r\nthe club, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d says Ruff to his partner (the OTHER partner!), and\r\nthe waiter snuffs the candles.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nI hope in the course of the above little pause, every single member of\r\na club who reads this has profited by the perusal. He may belong, I\r\nsay, to eight clubs; he will die, and not be missed by any of the five\r\nthousand members. Peace be to him; the waiters will forget him, and his\r\nname will pass away, and another great-coat will hang on the hook whence\r\nhis own used to be dependent.\r\n\r\nAnd this, I need not say, is the beauty of the club-institutions. If it\r\nwere otherwise--if, forsooth, we were to be sorry when our friends died,\r\nor to draw out our purses when our friends were in want, we should be\r\ninsolvent, and life would be miserable. Be it ours to button up our\r\npockets and our hearts; and to make merry--it is enough to swim down\r\nthis life-stream for ourselves; if Poverty is clutching hold of our\r\nheels, or Friendship would catch an arm, kick them both off. Every man\r\nfor himself, is the word, and plenty to do too.\r\n\r\nMy friend Captain Walker had practised the above maxims so long and\r\nresolutely as to be quite aware when he came himself to be in distress,\r\nthat not a single soul in the whole universe would help him, and he took\r\nhis measures accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen carried to Mr. Bendigo's lock-up house, he summoned that gentleman\r\nin a very haughty way, took a blank banker's cheque out of his\r\npocket-book, and filling it up for the exact sum of the writ, orders Mr.\r\nBendigo forthwith to open the door and let him go forth.\r\n\r\nMr. Bendigo, smiling with exceeding archness, and putting a finger\r\ncovered all over with diamond rings to his extremely aquiline nose,\r\ninquired of Mr. Walker whether he saw anything green about his face?\r\nintimating by this gay and good-humoured interrogatory his suspicion\r\nof the unsatisfactory nature of the document handed over to him by Mr.\r\nWalker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Walker, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and get the cheque cashed, and be\r\nquick about it. Send your man in a cab, and here's a half-crown to pay\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d The confident air somewhat staggers the bailiff, who asked him\r\nwhether he would like any refreshment while his man was absent getting\r\nthe amount of the cheque, and treated his prisoner with great civility\r\nduring the time of the messenger's journey.\r\n\r\nBut as Captain Walker had but a balance of two pounds five and twopence\r\n(this sum was afterwards divided among his creditors, the law expenses\r\nbeing previously deducted from it), the bankers of course declined to\r\ncash the Captain's draft for two hundred and odd pounds, simply writing\r\nthe words \xe2\x80\x9cNo effects\xe2\x80\x9d on the paper; on receiving which reply Walker,\r\nfar from being cast down, burst out laughing very gaily, produced a real\r\nfive-pound note, and called upon his host for a bottle of champagne,\r\nwhich the two worthies drank in perfect friendship and good-humour. The\r\nbottle was scarcely finished, and the young Israelitish gentleman who\r\nacts as waiter in Cursitor Street had only time to remove the flask and\r\nthe glasses, when poor Morgiana with a flood of tears rushed into her\r\nhusband's arms, and flung herself on his neck, and calling him her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdearest, blessed Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d would have fainted at his feet; but that he,\r\nbreaking out in a fury of oaths, asked her how, after getting him into\r\nthat scrape through her infernal extravagance, she dared to show her\r\nface before him? This address speedily frightened the poor thing out\r\nof her fainting fit--there is nothing so good for female hysterics as a\r\nlittle conjugal sternness, nay, brutality, as many husbands can aver who\r\nare in the habit of employing the remedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy extravagance, Howard?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a faint way; and quite put off\r\nher purpose of swooning by the sudden attack made upon her--\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, my\r\nlove, you have nothing to complain of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo complain of, ma'am?\xe2\x80\x9d roared the excellent Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cIs two hundred\r\nguineas to a music-master nothing to complain of? Did you bring me such\r\na fortune as to authorise your taking guinea lessons? Haven't I raised\r\nyou out of your sphere of life and introduced you to the best of the\r\nland? Haven't I dressed you like a duchess? Haven't I been for you such\r\na husband as very few women in the world ever had, madam?--answer me\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Howard, you were always very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't I toiled and slaved for you--been out all day working for you?\r\nHaven't I allowed your vulgar old mother to come to your house--to my\r\nhouse, I say? Haven't I done all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not deny it, and Walker, who was in a rage (and when a man is\r\nin a rage, for what on earth is a wife made but that he should vent his\r\nrage on her?), continued for some time in this strain, and so abused,\r\nfrightened, and overcame poor Morgiana that she left her husband fully\r\nconvinced that she was the most guilty of beings, and bemoaning his\r\ndouble bad fortune, that her Howard was ruined and she the cause of his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, Mr. Walker resumed his equanimity (for he was not\r\none of those men whom a few months of the King's Bench were likely to\r\nterrify), and drank several glasses of punch in company with his host;\r\nwith whom in perfect calmness he talked over his affairs. That he\r\nintended to pay his debt and quit the spunging-house next day is a\r\nmatter of course; no one ever was yet put in a spunging-house that did\r\nnot pledge his veracity he intended to quit it to-morrow. Mr. Bendigo\r\nsaid he should be heartily glad to open the door to him, and in the\r\nmeantime sent out diligently to see among his friends if there were\r\nany more detainers against the Captain, and to inform the Captain's\r\ncreditors to come forward against him.\r\n\r\nMorgiana went home in profound grief, it may be imagined, and could\r\nhardly refrain from bursting into tears when the sugar-loaf page asked\r\nwhether master was coming home early, or whether he had taken his key;\r\nshe lay awake tossing and wretched the whole night, and very early in\r\nthe morning rose up, and dressed, and went out.\r\n\r\nBefore nine o'clock she was in Cursitor Street, and once more joyfully\r\nbounced into her husband's arms; who woke up yawning and swearing\r\nsomewhat, with a severe headache, occasioned by the jollification of the\r\nprevious night: for, strange though it may seem, there are perhaps no\r\nplaces in Europe where jollity is more practised than in prisons for\r\ndebt; and I declare for my own part (I mean, of course, that I went\r\nto visit a friend) I have dined at Mr. Aminadab's as sumptuously as at\r\nLong's.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to account for Morgiana's joyfulness; which was\r\nstrange in her husband's perplexity, and after her sorrow of the\r\nprevious night. Well, then, when Mrs. Walker went out in the morning,\r\nshe did so with a very large basket under her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I carry the\r\nbasket, ma'am?\xe2\x80\x9d said the page, seizing it with much alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his mistress, with equal eagerness: \xe2\x80\x9cit's only--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy, sneering, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlass,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Walker, turning extremely red. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nthe goodness to call a coach, sir, and not to speak till you are\r\nquestioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman disappeared upon his errand: the coach was called\r\nand came. Mrs. Walker slipped into it with her basket, and the page went\r\ndownstairs to his companions in the kitchen, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a-comin'!\r\nmaster's in quod, and missus has gone out to pawn the plate.\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\ncook went out that day, she somehow had by mistake placed in her basket\r\na dozen of table-knives and a plated egg-stand. When the lady's-maid\r\ntook a walk in the course of the afternoon, she found she had occasion\r\nfor eight cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, (marked with her mistress's\r\ncipher), half-a-dozen pair of shoes, gloves, long and short, some silk\r\nstockings, and a gold-headed scent-bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth the new cashmeres is\r\ngone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand there's nothing left in Mrs. Walker's trinket-box\r\nbut a paper of pins and an old coral bracelet.\xe2\x80\x9d As for the page, he\r\nrushed incontinently to his master's dressing-room and examined every\r\none of the pockets of his clothes; made a parcel of some of them, and\r\nopened all the drawers which Walker had not locked before his departure.\r\nHe only found three-halfpence and a bill stamp, and about forty-five\r\ntradesmen's accounts, neatly labelled and tied up with red tape.\r\nThese three worthies, a groom who was a great admirer of Trimmer the\r\nlady's-maid, and a policeman a friend of the cook's, sat down to a\r\ncomfortable dinner at the usual hour, and it was agreed among them all\r\nthat Walker's ruin was certain. The cook made the policeman a present of\r\na china punch-bowl which Mrs. Walker had given her; and the lady's-maid\r\ngave her friend the \xe2\x80\x9cBook of Beauty\xe2\x80\x9d for last year, and the third volume\r\nof Byron's poems from the drawing-room table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm dash'd if she ain't taken the little French clock, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\npage, and so indeed Mrs. Walker had; it slipped in the basket where\r\nit lay enveloped in one of her shawls, and then struck madly and\r\nunnaturally a great number of times, as Morgiana was lifting her store\r\nof treasures out of the hackney-coach. The coachman wagged his head\r\nsadly as he saw her walking as quick as she could under her heavy load,\r\nand disappearing round the corner of the street at which Mr. Balls's\r\ncelebrated jewellery establishment is situated. It is a grand shop, with\r\nmagnificent silver cups and salvers, rare gold-headed canes, flutes,\r\nwatches, diamond brooches, and a few fine specimens of the old masters\r\nin the window, and under the words--\r\n\r\n     BALLS, JEWELLER,\r\n\r\nyou read\r\n\r\n       Money Lent.\r\n\r\nin the very smallest type, on the door.\r\n\r\nThe interview with Mr. Balls need not be described; but it must have\r\nbeen a satisfactory one, for at the end of half an hour Morgiana\r\nreturned and bounded into the coach with sparkling eyes, and told the\r\ndriver to GALLOP to Cursitor Street; which, smiling, he promised to do,\r\nand accordingly set off in that direction at the rate of four miles an\r\nhour. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the philosophic charioteer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a man's\r\nin quod, a woman don't mind her silver spoons;\xe2\x80\x9d and he was so delighted\r\nwith her action, that he forgot to grumble when she came to settle\r\naccounts with him, even though she gave him only double his fare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to the young Hebrew who opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom?\xe2\x80\x9d says the sarcastic youth; \xe2\x80\x9cthere's twenty HIM'S here. You're\r\nprecious early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Captain Walker, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Morgiana haughtily; whereupon\r\nthe youth opening the second door, and seeing Mr. Bendigo in a flowered\r\ndressing-gown descending the stairs, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cPapa, here's a lady for\r\nthe Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI'm come to free him,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, trembling, and holding\r\nout a bundle of bank-notes. \xe2\x80\x9cHere's the amount of your claim, sir--two\r\nhundred and twenty guineas, as you told me last night.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jew took the\r\nnotes, and grinned as he looked at her, and grinned double as he looked\r\nat his son, and begged Mrs. Walker to step into his study and take a\r\nreceipt. When the door of that apartment closed upon the lady and his\r\nfather, Mr. Bendigo the younger fell back in an agony of laughter, which\r\nit is impossible to describe in words, and presently ran out into a\r\ncourt where some of the luckless inmates of the house were already\r\ntaking the air, and communicated something to them which made those\r\nindividuals also laugh as uproariously as he had previously done.\r\n\r\nWell, after joyfully taking the receipt from Mr. Bendigo (how her cheeks\r\nflushed and her heart fluttered as she dried it on the blotting-book!),\r\nand after turning very pale again on hearing that the Captain had had a\r\nvery bad night: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd well he might, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said she (at which Mr.\r\nBendigo, having no person to grin at, grinned at a marble bust of\r\nMr. Pitt, which ornamented his sideboard)--Morgiana, I say, these\r\npreliminaries being concluded, was conducted to her husband's apartment,\r\nand once more flinging her arms round her dearest Howard's neck, told\r\nhim with one of the sweetest smiles in the world, to make haste and\r\nget up and come home, for breakfast was waiting and the carriage at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, love?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, starting up and looking\r\nexceedingly surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that my dearest is free; that the odious little creature is\r\npaid--at least the horrid bailiff is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to Baroski?\xe2\x80\x9d said Walker, turning very red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoward!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, quite indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid--did your mother give you the money?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I had it by me\xe2\x80\x9d replies Mrs. Walker, with a very knowing look.\r\n\r\nWalker was more surprised than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any more by you?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker showed him her purse with two guineas. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all, love,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would give me a draft to pay\r\na whole list of little bills that have somehow all come in within the\r\nlast few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, you shall have the cheque,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Walker, and began\r\nforthwith to make his toilet, which completed, he rang for Mr. Bendigo,\r\nand his bill, and intimated his wish to go home directly.\r\n\r\nThe honoured bailiff brought the bill, but with regard to his being\r\nfree, said it was impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow impossible?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Walker, turning very red: and then very\r\npale. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not pay just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did, and you've got the reshipt; but there's another detainer\r\nagainst the Captain for a hundred and fifty. Eglantine and Mossrose, of\r\nBond Street;--perfumery for five years, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't mean to say you were such a fool as to pay without asking if\r\nthere were any more detainers?\xe2\x80\x9d roared Walker to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was though,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Mr. Bendigo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she'll know better the\r\nnext time: and, besides, Captain, what's a hundred and fifty pounds to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Walker desired nothing so much in the world at that moment as\r\nthe liberty to knock down his wife, his sense of prudence overcame his\r\ndesire for justice: if that feeling may be called prudence on his part,\r\nwhich consisted in a strong wish to cheat the bailiff into the idea that\r\nhe (Walker) was an exceedingly respectable and wealthy man. Many worthy\r\npersons indulge in this fond notion, that they are imposing upon the\r\nworld; strive to fancy, for instance, that their bankers consider\r\nthem men of property because they keep a tolerable balance, pay little\r\ntradesmen's bills with ostentatious punctuality, and so forth--but the\r\nworld, let us be pretty sure, is as wise as need be, and guesses our\r\nreal condition with a marvellous instinct, or learns it with curious\r\nskill. The London tradesman is one of the keenest judges of human nature\r\nextant; and if a tradesman, how much more a bailiff? In reply to the\r\nironic question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a hundred and fifty pounds to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Walker,\r\ncollecting himself, answers, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an infamous imposition, and I owe\r\nthe money no more than you do; but, nevertheless, I shall instruct\r\nmy lawyers to pay it in the course of the morning: under protest, of\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bendigo, bowing and quitting the room, and\r\nleaving Mrs. Walker to the pleasure of a tete-a-tete with her husband.\r\n\r\nAnd now being alone with the partner of his bosom, the worthy gentleman\r\nbegan an address to her which cannot be put down on paper here; because\r\nthe world is exceedingly squeamish, and does not care to hear the whole\r\ntruth about rascals, and because the fact is that almost every other\r\nword of the Captain's speech was a curse, such as would shock the\r\nbeloved reader were it put in print.\r\n\r\nFancy, then, in lieu of the conversation, a scoundrel, disappointed and\r\nin a fury, wreaking his brutal revenge upon an amiable woman, who sits\r\ntrembling and pale, and wondering at this sudden exhibition of wrath.\r\nFancy how he clenches his fists and stands over her, and stamps and\r\nscreams out curses with a livid face, growing wilder and wilder in his\r\nrage; wrenching her hand when she wants to turn away, and only stopping\r\nat last when she has fallen off the chair in a fainting fit, with\r\na heart-breaking sob that made the Jew-boy who was listening at the\r\nkey-hole turn quite pale and walk away. Well, it is best, perhaps, that\r\nsuch a conversation should not be told at length:--at the end of\r\nit, when Mr. Walker had his wife lifeless on the floor, he seized a\r\nwater-jug and poured it over her; which operation pretty soon brought\r\nher to herself, and shaking her black ringlets, she looked up once more\r\nagain timidly into his face, and took his hand, and began to cry.\r\n\r\nHe spoke now in a somewhat softer voice, and let her keep paddling on\r\nwith his hand as before; he COULDN'T speak very fiercely to the poor\r\ngirl in her attitude of defeat, and tenderness, and supplication.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorgiana,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyour extravagance and carelessness have brought me\r\nto ruin, I'm afraid. If you had chosen to have gone to Baroski, a word\r\nfrom you would have made him withdraw the writ, and my property wouldn't\r\nhave been sacrificed, as it has now been, for nothing. It mayn't be yet\r\ntoo late, however, to retrieve ourselves. This bill of Eglantine's is\r\na regular conspiracy, I am sure, between Mossrose and Bendigo here: you\r\nmust go to Eglantine--he's an old--an old flame of yours, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped his hand: \xe2\x80\x9cI can't go to Eglantine after what has passed\r\nbetween us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; but Walker's face instantly began to wear a\r\ncertain look, and she said with a shudder, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, dear, I WILL\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou will go to Eglantine, and ask him to take a bill for the\r\namount of this shameful demand--at any date, never mind what. Mind,\r\nhowever, to see him alone, and I'm sure if you choose you can settle the\r\nbusiness. Make haste; set off directly, and come back, as there may be\r\nmore detainers in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrembling, and in a great flutter, Morgiana put on her bonnet and\r\ngloves, and went towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a fine morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWalker, looking out: \xe2\x80\x9ca walk will do you good; and--Morgiana--didn't you\r\nsay you had a couple of guineas in your pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling all at once, and holding up her face to\r\nbe kissed. She paid the two guineas for the kiss. Was it not a mean act?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that people can love where they do not respect?\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMiss Prim: \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ never would.\xe2\x80\x9d Nobody asked you, Miss Prim: but recollect\r\nMorgiana was not born with your advantages of education and breeding;\r\nand was, in fact, a poor vulgar creature, who loved Mr. Walker, not\r\nbecause her mamma told her, nor because he was an exceedingly eligible\r\nand well-brought-up young man, but because she could not help it, and\r\nknew no better. Nor is Mrs. Walker set up as a model of virtue: ah, no!\r\nwhen I want a model of virtue I will call in Baker Street, and ask for a\r\nsitting of my dear (if I may be permitted to say so) Miss Prim.\r\n\r\nWe have Mr. Howard Walker safely housed in Mr. Bendigo's establishment\r\nin Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane; and it looks like mockery and want of\r\nfeeling towards the excellent hero of this story (or, as should rather\r\nbe said, towards the husband of the heroine) to say what he might have\r\nbeen but for the unlucky little circumstance of Baroski's passion for\r\nMorgiana.\r\n\r\nIf Baroski had not fallen in love with Morgiana, he would not have given\r\nher two hundred guineas' worth of lessons; he would not have so far\r\npresumed as to seize her hand, and attempt to kiss it; if he had not\r\nattempted to kiss her, she would not have boxed his ears; he would not\r\nhave taken out the writ against Walker; Walker would have been free,\r\nvery possibly rich, and therefore certainly respected: he always said\r\nthat a month's more liberty would have set him beyond the reach of\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nThe assertion is very likely a correct one; for Walker had a flashy\r\nenterprising genius, which ends in wealth sometimes; in the King's Bench\r\nnot seldom; occasionally, alas! in Van Diemen's Land. He might have been\r\nrich, could he have kept his credit, and had not his personal expenses\r\nand extravagances pulled him down. He had gallantly availed himself of\r\nhis wife's fortune; nor could any man in London, as he proudly said,\r\nhave made five hundred pounds go so far. He had, as we have seen,\r\nfurnished a house, sideboard, and cellar with it: he had a carriage, and\r\nhorses in his stable, and with the remainder he had purchased shares\r\nin four companies--of three of which he was founder and director, had\r\nconducted innumerable bargains in the foreign stocks, had lived and\r\nentertained sumptuously, and made himself a very considerable income. He\r\nhad set up THE CAPITOL Loan and Life Assurance Company, had discovered\r\nthe Chimborazo gold mines, and the Society for Recovering and Draining\r\nthe Pontine Marshes; capital ten millions; patron HIS HOLINESS THE POPE.\r\nIt certainly was stated in an evening paper that His Holiness had made\r\nhim a Knight of the Spur, and had offered to him the rank of Count; and\r\nhe was raising a loan for His Highness, the Cacique of Panama, who had\r\nsent him (by way of dividend) the grand cordon of His Highness's order\r\nof the Castle and Falcon, which might be seen any day at his office in\r\nBond Street, with the parchments signed and sealed by the Grand Master\r\nand Falcon King-at-arms of His Highness. In a week more Walker would\r\nhave raised a hundred thousand pounds on His Highness's twenty per cent.\r\nloan; he would have had fifteen thousand pounds commission for himself;\r\nhis companies would have risen to par, he would have realised his\r\nshares; he would have gone into Parliament; he would have been made a\r\nbaronet, who knows? a peer, probably! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I appeal to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker\r\nwould say to his friends, \xe2\x80\x9ccould any man have shown better proof of his\r\naffection for his wife than by laying out her little miserable money as\r\nI did? They call me heartless, sir, because I didn't succeed; sir, my\r\nlife has been a series of sacrifices for that woman, such as no man ever\r\nperformed before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA proof of Walker's dexterity and capability for business may be seen\r\nin the fact that he had actually appeased and reconciled one of his\r\nbitterest enemies--our honest friend Eglantine. After Walker's marriage\r\nEglantine, who had now no mercantile dealings with his former agent,\r\nbecame so enraged with him, that, as the only means of revenge in his\r\npower, he sent him in his bill for goods supplied to the amount of\r\none hundred and fifty guineas, and sued him for the amount. But Walker\r\nstepped boldly over to his enemy, and in the course of half an hour they\r\nwere friends.\r\n\r\nEglantine promised to forego his claim; and accepted in lieu of it three\r\nhundred-pound shares of the ex-Panama stock, bearing twenty-five per\r\ncent., payable half-yearly at the house of Hocus Brothers, St. Swithin's\r\nLane; three hundred-pound shares, and the SECOND class of the order\r\nof the Castle and Falcon, with the riband and badge. \xe2\x80\x9cIn four years,\r\nEglantine, my boy, I hope to get you the Grand Cordon of the order,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Walker: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to see you a KNIGHT GRAND CROSS, with a grant of a\r\nhundred thousand acres reclaimed from the Isthmus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo do my poor Eglantine justice, he did not care for the hundred\r\nthousand acres--it was the star that delighted him--ah! how his fat\r\nchest heaved with delight as he sewed on the cross and riband to his\r\ndress-coat, and lighted up four wax candles and looked at himself in\r\nthe glass. He was known to wear a great-coat after that--it was that he\r\nmight wear the cross under it. That year he went on a trip to Boulogne.\r\nHe was dreadfully ill during the voyage, but as the vessel entered\r\nthe port he was seen to emerge from the cabin, his coat open, the star\r\nblazing on his chest; the soldiers saluted him as he walked the streets,\r\nhe was called Monsieur le Chevalier, and when he went home he entered\r\ninto negotiations with Walker to purchase a commission in His Highness's\r\nservice. Walker said he would get him the nominal rank of Captain, the\r\nfees at the Panama War Office were five-and-twenty pounds, which\r\nsum honest Eglantine produced, and had his commission, and a pack of\r\nvisiting cards printed as Captain Archibald Eglantine, K.C.F. Many a\r\ntime he looked at them as they lay in his desk, and he kept the cross in\r\nhis dressing-table, and wore it as he shaved every morning.\r\n\r\nHis Highness the Cacique, it is well known, came to England, and had\r\nlodgings in Regent Street, where he held a levee, at which Eglantine\r\nappeared in the Panama uniform, and was most graciously received by\r\nhis Sovereign. His Highness proposed to make Captain Eglantine his\r\naide-de-camp with the rank of Colonel, but the Captain's exchequer\r\nwas rather low at that moment, and the fees at the \xe2\x80\x9cWar Office\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nperemptory. Meanwhile His Highness left Regent Street, was said by some\r\nto have returned to Panama, by others to be in his native city of Cork,\r\nby others to be leading a life of retirement in the New Cut, Lambeth;\r\nat any rate was not visible for some time, so that Captain Eglantine's\r\nadvancement did not take place. Eglantine was somehow ashamed to mention\r\nhis military and chivalric rank to Mr. Mossrose, when that gentleman\r\ncame into partnership with him; and kept these facts secret, until\r\nthey were detected by a very painful circumstance. On the very day when\r\nWalker was arrested at the suit of Benjamin Baroski, there appeared in\r\nthe newspapers an account of the imprisonment of His Highness the Prince\r\nof Panama for a bill owing to a licensed victualler in Ratcliff Highway.\r\nThe magistrate to whom the victualler subsequently came to complain\r\npassed many pleasantries on the occasion. He asked whether His Highness\r\ndid not drink like a swan with two necks; whether he had brought any\r\nBelles savages with him from Panama, and so forth; and the whole court,\r\nsaid the report, \xe2\x80\x9cwas convulsed with laughter when Boniface produced a\r\ngreen and yellow riband with a large star of the order of the Castle\r\nand Falcon, with which His Highness proposed to gratify him, in lieu of\r\npaying his little bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as he was reading the above document with a bleeding heart that\r\nMr. Mossrose came in from his daily walk to the City. \xe2\x80\x9cVell, Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, \xe2\x80\x9chave you heard the newsh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout His Highness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout your friend Valker; he's arrested for two hundred poundsh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEglantine at this could contain no more; but told his story of how he\r\nhad been induced to accept three hundred pounds of Panama stock for\r\nhis account against Walker, and cursed his stars for his folly. \xe2\x80\x9cVell,\r\nyou've only to bring in another bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger perfumer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cswear he owes you a hundred and fifty pounds, and we'll have a writ out\r\nagainst him this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so a second writ was taken out against Captain Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll have his wife here very likely in a day or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nMossrose to his partner; \xe2\x80\x9cthem chaps always sends their wives, and I\r\nhope you know how to deal with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't value her a fig's hend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eglantine. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll treat her like\r\nthe dust of the hearth. After that woman's conduct to me, I should like\r\nto see her have the haudacity to come here; and if she does, you'll see\r\nhow I'll serve her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe worthy perfumer was, in fact, resolved to be exceedingly\r\nhard-hearted in his behaviour towards his old love, and acted over at\r\nnight in bed the scene which was to occur when the meeting should take\r\nplace. Oh, thought he, but it will be a grand thing to see the proud\r\nMorgiana on her knees to me; and me a-pointing to the door, and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, you've steeled this 'eart against you, you have;--bury the\r\nrecollection of old times, of those old times when I thought my 'eart\r\nwould have broke, but it didn't--no: 'earts are made of sterner stuff. I\r\ndidn't die, as I thought I should; I stood it, and live to see the woman\r\nI despised at my feet--ha, ha, at my feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these thoughts Mr. Eglantine fell asleep; but it\r\nwas evident that the idea of seeing Morgiana once more agitated him\r\nconsiderably, else why should he have been at the pains of preparing\r\nso much heroism? His sleep was exceedingly fitful and troubled; he saw\r\nMorgiana in a hundred shapes; he dreamed that he was dressing her hair;\r\nthat he was riding with her to Richmond; that the horse turned into a\r\ndragon, and Morgiana into Woolsey, who took him by the throat and choked\r\nhim, while the dragon played the key-bugle. And in the morning when\r\nMossrose was gone to his business in the City, and he sat reading the\r\nMorning Post in his study, ah! what a thump his heart gave as the lady\r\nof his dreams actually stood before him!\r\n\r\nMany a lady who purchased brushes at Eglantine's shop would have given\r\nten guineas for such a colour as his when he saw her. His heart beat\r\nviolently, he was almost choking in his stays: he had been prepared for\r\nthe visit, but his courage failed him now it had come. They were both\r\nsilent for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I am come for,\xe2\x80\x9d at last said Morgiana from under her\r\nveil, but she put it aside as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--that is--yes--it's a painful affair, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, giving one look\r\nat her pale face, and then turning away in a flurry. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg to refer\r\nyou to Blunt, Hone, and Sharpus, my lawyers, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, collecting\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't expect this from YOU, Mr. Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, and began\r\nto sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after what's 'appened, I didn't expect a visit from YOU, mem.\r\nI thought Mrs. Capting Walker was too great a dame to visit poor\r\nHarchibald Eglantine (though some of the first men in the country DO\r\nvisit him). Is there anything in which I can oblige you, mem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the poor woman; \xe2\x80\x9chave I no friend left? I never\r\nthought that you, too, would have deserted me, Mr. Archibald.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cArchibald,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced in the old way, had evidently an effect on\r\nthe perfumer; he winced and looked at her very eagerly for a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, mem?\xe2\x80\x9d at last said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this bill against Mr. Walker, for which he is now in prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfumery supplied for five years; that man used more 'air-brushes than\r\nany duke in the land, and as for eau-de-Cologne, he must have bathed\r\nhimself in it. He hordered me about like a lord. He never paid me one\r\nshilling--he stabbed me in my most vital part--but ah! ah! never mind\r\nTHAT: and I said I would be revenged, and I AM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe perfumer was quite in a rage again by this time, and wiped his fat\r\nface with his pocket-handkerchief, and glared upon Mrs. Walker with a\r\nmost determined air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRevenged on whom? Archibald--Mr. Eglantine, revenged on me--on a poor\r\nwoman whom you made miserable! You would not have done so once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! and a precious way you treated me ONCE,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eglantine: \xe2\x80\x9cdon't\r\ntalk to me, mem, of ONCE. Bury the recollection of once for hever!\r\nI thought my 'eart would have broke once, but no: 'earts are made of\r\nsterner stuff. I didn't die, as I thought I should; I stood it--and I\r\nlive to see the woman who despised me at my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Archibald!\xe2\x80\x9d was all the lady could say, and she fell to sobbing\r\nagain: it was perhaps her best argument with the perfumer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Harchibald, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, beginning to swell; \xe2\x80\x9cdon't call\r\nme Harchibald, Morgiana. Think what a position you might have held if\r\nyou'd chose: when, when--you MIGHT have called me Harchibald. Now\r\nit's no use,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with harrowing pathos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, though I've been\r\nwronged, I can't bear to see women in tears--tell me what I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear good Mr. Eglantine, send to your lawyers and stop this horrid\r\nprosecution--take Mr. Walker's acknowledgment for the debt. If he is\r\nfree, he is sure to have a very large sum of money in a few days, and\r\nwill pay you all. Do not ruin him--do not ruin me by persisting now. Be\r\nthe old kind Eglantine you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEglantine took a hand, which Morgiana did not refuse; he thought about\r\nold times. He had known her since childhood almost; as a girl he dandled\r\nher on his knee at the \xe2\x80\x9cKidneys;\xe2\x80\x9d as a woman he had adored her--his\r\nheart was melted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did pay me in a sort of way,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the perfumer with\r\nhimself--\xe2\x80\x9cthese bonds, though they are not worth much, I took 'em for\r\nbetter or for worse, and I can't bear to see her crying, and to trample\r\non a woman in distress. Morgiana,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a loud cheerful voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccheer up; I'll give you a release for your husband: I WILL be the old\r\nkind Eglantine I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe the old kind jackass you vash!\xe2\x80\x9d here roared a voice that made Mr.\r\nEglantine start. \xe2\x80\x9cVy, vat an old fat fool you are, Eglantine, to give up\r\nour just debts because a voman comes snivelling and crying to you--and\r\nsuch a voman, too!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mossrose, for his was the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a woman, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the senior partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; such a woman--vy, didn't she jilt you herself?--hasn't she been\r\ntrying the same game with Baroski; and are you so green as to give up\r\na hundred and fifty pounds because she takes a fancy to come vimpering\r\nhere? I won't, I can tell you. The money's as much mine as it is yours,\r\nand I'll have it or keep Walker's body, that's what I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the presence of his partner, the timid good genius of Eglantine,\r\nwhich had prompted him to mercy and kindness, at once outspread its\r\nfrightened wings and flew away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see how it is, Mrs. W.,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking down; \xe2\x80\x9cit's an affair\r\nof business--in all these here affairs of business Mr. Mossrose is the\r\nmanaging man; ain't you, Mr. Mossrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty business it would be if I wasn't,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mossrose, doggedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you vat I do: I take fifty per shent;\r\nnot a farthing less--give me that, and out your husband goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, Howard will pay you in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVell, den, let him stop at my uncle Bendigo's for a week, and come out\r\nden--he's very comfortable there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shylock with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cHadn't\r\nyou better go to the shop, Mr. Eglantine,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cand look after\r\nyour business? Mrs. Walker can't want you to listen to her all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEglantine was glad of the excuse, and slunk out of the studio; not into\r\nthe shop, but into his parlour; where he drank off a great glass of\r\nmaraschino, and sat blushing and exceedingly agitated, until Mossrose\r\ncame to tell him that Mrs. W. was gone, and wouldn't trouble him any\r\nmore. But although he drank several more glasses of maraschino, and went\r\nto the play that night, and to the Cider-cellars afterwards, neither\r\nthe liquor, nor the play, nor the delightful comic songs at the cellars,\r\ncould drive Mrs. Walker out of his head, and the memory of old times,\r\nand the image of her pale weeping face.\r\n\r\nMorgiana tottered out of the shop, scarcely heeding the voice of Mr.\r\nMossrose, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll take forty per shent\xe2\x80\x9d (and went back to his\r\nduty cursing himself for a soft-hearted fool for giving up so much of\r\nhis rights to a puling woman). Morgiana, I say, tottered out of the\r\nshop, and went up Conduit Street, weeping, weeping with all her eyes.\r\nShe was quite faint, for she had taken nothing that morning but the\r\nglass of water which the pastry-cook in the Strand had given her, and\r\nwas forced to take hold of the railings of a house for support just as\r\na little gentleman with a yellow handkerchief under his arm was issuing\r\nfrom the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Mrs. Walker!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. It was no other than\r\nMr. Woolsey, who was going forth to try a body-coat for a customer. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou ill?--what's the matter?--for God's sake come in!\xe2\x80\x9d and he took her\r\narm under his, and led her into his back-parlour, and seated her, and\r\nhad some wine and water before her in one minute, before she had said\r\none single word regarding herself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was somewhat recovered, and with the interruption of\r\na thousand sobs, the poor thing told as well as she could her little\r\nstory. Mr. Eglantine had arrested Mr. Walker: she had been trying to\r\ngain time for him; Eglantine had refused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hard-hearted cowardly brute to refuse HER anything!\xe2\x80\x9d said loyal Mr.\r\nWoolsey. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI've no reason to love your husband, and I\r\nknow too much about him to respect him; but I love and respect YOU, and\r\nwill spend my last shilling to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d At which Morgiana could only\r\ntake his hand and cry a great deal more than ever. She said Mr. Walker\r\nwould have a great deal of money in a week, that he was the best of\r\nhusbands, and she was sure Mr. Woolsey would think better of him when\r\nhe knew him; that Mr. Eglantine's bill was one hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nbut that Mr. Mossrose would take forty per cent. if Mr. Woolsey could\r\nsay how much that was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll pay a thousand pound to do you good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woolsey, bouncing\r\nup; \xe2\x80\x9cstay here for ten minutes, my dear, until my return, and all shall\r\nbe right, as you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d He was back in ten minutes, and had called\r\na cab from the stand opposite (all the coachmen there had seen and\r\ncommented on Mrs. Walker's woebegone looks), and they were off for\r\nCursitor Street in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThey'll settle the whole debt for twenty\r\npounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and showed an order to that effect from Mr. Mossrose\r\nto Mr. Bendigo, empowering the latter to release Walker on receiving Mr.\r\nWoolsey's acknowledgment for the above sum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no use paying it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Walker, doggedly; \xe2\x80\x9cit would only\r\nbe robbing you, Mr. Woolsey--seven more detainers have come in while my\r\nwife has been away. I must go through the court now; but,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a\r\nwhisper to the tailor, \xe2\x80\x9cmy good sir, my debts of HONOUR are sacred, and\r\nif you will have the goodness to lend ME the twenty pounds, I pledge you\r\nmy word as a gentleman to return it when I come out of quod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mr. Woolsey declined this; for, as soon as he was\r\ngone, Walker, in a tremendous fury, began cursing his wife for dawdling\r\nthree hours on the road. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce, ma'am, didn't you take a cab?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n roared he, when he heard she had walked to Bond Street. \xe2\x80\x9cThose writs\r\nhave only been in half an hour, and I might have been off but for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn't you take--didn't I give you my--my last\r\nshilling?\xe2\x80\x9d and fell back and wept again more bitterly than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said her amiable husband, turning rather red, \xe2\x80\x9cnever mind,\r\nit wasn't your fault. It is but going through the court. It is no great\r\nodds. I forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. IN WHICH MR. WALKER STILL REMAINS IN DIFFICULTIES, BUT SHOWS\r\nGREAT RESIGNATION UNDER HIS MISFORTUNES.\r\n\r\nThe exemplary Walker, seeing that escape from his enemies was hopeless,\r\nand that it was his duty as a man to turn on them and face them, now\r\ndetermined to quit the splendid though narrow lodgings which Mr.\r\nBendigo had provided for him, and undergo the martyrdom of the Fleet.\r\nAccordingly, in company with that gentleman, he came over to Her\r\nMajesty's prison, and gave himself into the custody of the officers\r\nthere; and did not apply for the accommodation of the Rules (by which\r\nin those days the captivity of some debtors was considerably lightened),\r\nbecause he knew perfectly well that there was no person in the wide\r\nworld who would give a security for the heavy sums for which Walker was\r\nanswerable. What these sums were is no matter, and on this head we do\r\nnot think it at all necessary to satisfy the curiosity of the reader. He\r\nmay have owed hundreds--thousands, his creditors only can tell; he paid\r\nthe dividend which has been formerly mentioned, and showed thereby his\r\ndesire to satisfy all claims upon him to the uttermost farthing.\r\n\r\nAs for the little house in Connaught Square, when, after quitting her\r\nhusband, Morgiana drove back thither, the door was opened by the page,\r\nwho instantly thanked her to pay his wages; and in the drawing-room, on\r\na yellow satin sofa, sat a seedy man (with a pot of porter beside him\r\nplaced on an album for fear of staining the rosewood table), and the\r\nseedy man signified that he had taken possession of the furniture in\r\nexecution for a judgment debt. Another seedy man was in the dining-room,\r\nreading a newspaper, and drinking gin; he informed Mrs. Walker that\r\nhe was the representative of another judgment debt and of another\r\nexecution:--\xe2\x80\x9cThere's another on 'em in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctaking an inwentory of the furniture; and he swears he'll have you took\r\nup for swindling, for pawning the plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woolsey, for that worthy man had conducted Morgiana\r\nhome--\xe2\x80\x9csir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking his stick at the young page, \xe2\x80\x9cif you give\r\nany more of your impudence, I'll beat every button off your jacket:\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nas there were some four hundred of these ornaments, the page was silent.\r\nIt was a great mercy for Morgiana that the honest and faithful tailor\r\nhad accompanied her. The good fellow had waited very patiently for her\r\nfor an hour in the parlour or coffee-room of the lock-up house, knowing\r\nfull well that she would want a protector on her way homewards; and his\r\nkindness will be more appreciated when it is stated that, during\r\nthe time of his delay in the coffee-room, he had been subject to the\r\nentreaties, nay, to the insults, of Cornet Fipkin of the Blues, who was\r\nin prison at the suit of Linsey, Woolsey and Co., and who happened to be\r\ntaking his breakfast in the apartment when his obdurate creditor entered\r\nit. The Cornet (a hero of eighteen, who stood at least five feet three\r\nin his boots, and owed fifteen thousand pounds) was so enraged at the\r\nobduracy of his creditor that he said he would have thrown him out of\r\nthe window but for the bars which guarded it; and entertained serious\r\nthoughts of knocking the tailor's head off, but that the latter, putting\r\nhis right leg forward and his fists in a proper attitude, told the\r\nyoung officer to \xe2\x80\x9ccome on;\xe2\x80\x9d on which the Cornet cursed the tailor for a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csnob,\xe2\x80\x9d and went back to his breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe execution people having taken charge of Mr. Walker's house, Mrs.\r\nWalker was driven to take refuge with her mamma near \xe2\x80\x9cSadler's Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the Captain remained comfortably lodged in the Fleet. He had some\r\nready money, and with it managed to make his existence exceedingly\r\ncomfortable. He lived with the best society of the place, consisting of\r\nseveral distinguished young noblemen and gentlemen. He spent the morning\r\nplaying at fives and smoking cigars; the evening smoking cigars and\r\ndining comfortably. Cards came after dinner; and, as the Captain was\r\nan experienced player, and near a score of years older than most of his\r\nfriends, he was generally pretty successful: indeed, if he had received\r\nall the money that was owed to him, he might have come out of prison\r\nand paid his creditors twenty shillings in the pound--that is, if he had\r\nbeen minded to do so. But there is no use in examining into that point\r\ntoo closely, for the fact is, young Fipkin only paid him forty pounds\r\nout of seven hundred, for which he gave him I.O.U.'s; Algernon Deuceace\r\nnot only did not pay him three hundred and twenty which he lost at blind\r\nhookey, but actually borrowed seven and sixpence in money from Walker,\r\nwhich has never been repaid to this day; and Lord Doublequits actually\r\nlost nineteen thousand pounds to him at heads and tails, which he never\r\npaid, pleading drunkenness and his minority. The reader may recollect a\r\nparagraph which went the round of the papers entitled--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffair of honour in the Fleet Prison.--Yesterday morning (behind the\r\npump in the second court) Lord D-bl-qu-ts and Captain H-w-rd W-lk-r (a\r\nnear relative, we understand, of his Grace the Duke of N-rf-lk) had\r\na hostile meeting and exchanged two shots. These two young sprigs of\r\nnobility were attended to the ground by Major Flush, who, by the way,\r\nis FLUSH no longer, and Captain Pam, late of the ---- Dragoons. Play is\r\nsaid to have been the cause of the quarrel, and the gallant Captain is\r\nreported to have handled the noble lord's nose rather roughly at one\r\nstage of the transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Morgiana at \xe2\x80\x9cSadler's Wells\xe2\x80\x9d heard these news, she was ready to\r\nfaint with terror; and rushed to the Fleet Prison, and embraced her lord\r\nand master with her usual expansion and fits of tears: very much to that\r\ngentleman's annoyance, who happened to be in company with Pain and Flush\r\nat the time, and did not care that his handsome wife should be seen\r\ntoo much in the dubious precincts of the Fleet. He had at least so much\r\nshame about him, and had always rejected her entreaties to be allowed to\r\ninhabit the prison with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d would he say, casting his eyes heavenward, and with a\r\nmost lugubrious countenance--\xe2\x80\x9cit is enough, Morgiana, that _I_ should\r\nsuffer, even though your thoughtlessness has been the cause of my ruin.\r\nBut enough of THAT! I will not rebuke you for faults for which I know\r\nyou are now repentant; and I never could bear to see you in the midst\r\nof the miseries of this horrible place. Remain at home with your mother,\r\nand let me drag on the weary days here alone. If you can get me any more\r\nof that pale sherry, my love, do. I require something to cheer me in\r\nsolitude, and have found my chest very much relieved by that wine. Put\r\nmore pepper and eggs, my dear, into the next veal-pie you make me. I\r\ncan't eat the horrible messes in the coffee-room here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Walker's wish, I can't tell why, except that it is the wish of\r\na great number of other persons in this strange world, to make his\r\nwife believe that he was wretched in mind and ill in health; and all\r\nassertions to this effect the simple creature received with numberless\r\ntears of credulity: she would go home to Mrs. Crump, and say how her\r\ndarling Howard was pining away, how he was ruined for HER, and with what\r\nangelic sweetness he bore his captivity. The fact is, he bore it with so\r\nmuch resignation that no other person in the world could see that he\r\nwas unhappy. His life was undisturbed by duns; his day was his own from\r\nmorning till night; his diet was good, his acquaintances jovial, his\r\npurse tolerably well supplied, and he had not one single care to annoy\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crump and Woolsey, perhaps, received Morgiana's account of her\r\nhusband's miseries with some incredulity. The latter was now a daily\r\nvisitor to \xe2\x80\x9cSadler's Wells.\xe2\x80\x9d His love for Morgiana had become a warm\r\nfatherly generous regard for her; it was out of the honest fellow's\r\ncellar that the wine used to come which did so much good to Mr. Walker's\r\nchest; and he tried a thousand ways to make Morgiana happy.\r\n\r\nA very happy day, indeed, it was when, returning from her visit to the\r\nFleet, she found in her mother's sitting-room her dear grand rosewood\r\npiano, and every one of her music-books, which the kind-hearted tailor\r\nhad purchased at the sale of Walker's effects. And I am not ashamed\r\nto say that Morgiana herself was so charmed, that when, as usual, Mr.\r\nWoolsey came to drink tea in the evening, she actually gave him a kiss;\r\nwhich frightened Mr. Woolsey, and made him blush exceedingly. She\r\nsat down, and played him that evening every one of the songs which\r\nhe liked--the OLD songs--none of your Italian stuff. Podmore, the old\r\nmusic-master, was there too, and was delighted and astonished at the\r\nprogress in singing which Morgiana had made; and when the little party\r\nseparated, he took Mr. Woolsey by the hand, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me leave to\r\ntell you, sir, that you're a TRUMP.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Canterfield, the first tragic; \xe2\x80\x9can honour to human\r\nnature. A man whose hand is open as day to melting charity, and whose\r\nheart ever melts at the tale of woman's distress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh, stuff and nonsense, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor; but, upon my\r\nword, Mr. Canterfield's words were perfectly correct. I wish as much\r\ncould be said in favour of Woolsey's old rival, Mr. Eglantine, who\r\nattended the sale too, but it was with a horrid kind of satisfaction\r\nat the thought that Walker was ruined. He bought the yellow satin\r\nsofa before mentioned, and transferred it to what he calls his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csitting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d where it is to this day, bearing many marks of the best\r\nbear's grease. Woolsey bid against Baroski for the piano, very nearly\r\nup to the actual value of the instrument, when the artist withdrew from\r\ncompetition; and when he was sneering at the ruin of Mr. Walker, the\r\ntailor sternly interrupted him by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce are YOU\r\nsneering at? You did it, sir; and you're paid every shilling of your\r\nclaim, ain't you?\xe2\x80\x9d On which Baroski turned round to Miss Larkins,\r\nand said, Mr. Woolsey was a \xe2\x80\x9csnop;\xe2\x80\x9d the very word, though pronounced\r\nsomewhat differently, which the gallant Cornet Fipkin had applied to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWell; so he WAS a snob. But, vulgar as he was, I declare, for my part,\r\nthat I have a greater respect for Mr. Woolsey than for any single\r\nnobleman or gentleman mentioned in this true history.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the names of Messrs. Canterfield and Podmore\r\nthat Morgiana was again in the midst of the widow Crump's favourite\r\ntheatrical society; and this, indeed, was the case. The widow's little\r\nroom was hung round with the pictures which were mentioned at the\r\ncommencement of the story as decorating the bar of the \xe2\x80\x9cBootjack;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nseveral times in a week she received her friends from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nentertained them with such humble refreshments of tea and crumpets as\r\nher modest means permitted her to purchase. Among these persons Morgiana\r\nlived and sang quite as contentedly as she had ever done among the\r\ndemireps of her husband's society; and, only she did not dare to own it\r\nto herself, was a great deal happier than she had been for many a day.\r\nMrs. Captain Walker was still a great lady amongst them. Even in his\r\nruin, Walker, the director of three companies, and the owner of the\r\nsplendid pony-chaise, was to these simple persons an awful character;\r\nand when mentioned they talked with a great deal of gravity of his being\r\nin the country, and hoped Mrs. Captain W. had good news of him. They all\r\nknew he was in the Fleet; but had he not in prison fought a duel with a\r\nviscount? Montmorency (of the Norfolk Circuit) was in the Fleet too;\r\nand when Canterfield went to see poor Montey, the latter had pointed out\r\nWalker to his friend, who actually hit Lord George Tennison across the\r\nshoulders in play with a racket-bat; which event was soon made known to\r\nthe whole green-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had me up one day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montmorency, \xe2\x80\x9cto sing a comic song, and\r\ngive my recitations; and we had champagne and lobster-salad: SUCH nobs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added the player. \xe2\x80\x9cBillingsgate and Vauxhall were there too, and left\r\ncollege at eight o'clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Morgiana was told of the circumstance by her mother, she hoped her\r\ndear Howard had enjoyed the evening, and was thankful that for once he\r\ncould forget his sorrows. Nor, somehow, was she ashamed of herself for\r\nbeing happy afterwards, but gave way to her natural good-humour without\r\nrepentance or self-rebuke. I believe, indeed (alas! why are we made\r\nacquainted with the same fact regarding ourselves long after it is past\r\nand gone?)--I believe these were the happiest days of Morgiana's whole\r\nlife. She had no cares except the pleasant one of attending on her\r\nhusband, an easy smiling temperament which made her regardless of\r\nto-morrow; and, add to this, a delightful hope relative to a certain\r\ninteresting event which was about to occur, and which I shall not\r\nparticularise further than by saying, that she was cautioned against too\r\nmuch singing by Mr. Squills, her medical attendant; and that widow Crump\r\nwas busy making up a vast number of little caps and diminutive cambric\r\nshirts, such as delighted GRANDMOTHERS are in the habit of fashioning.\r\nI hope this is as genteel a way of signifying the circumstance which\r\nwas about to take place in the Walker family as Miss Prim herself could\r\ndesire. Mrs. Walker's mother was about to become a grandmother. There's\r\na phrase! The Morning Post, which says this story is vulgar, I'm sure\r\ncannot quarrel with that. I don't believe the whole Court Guide would\r\nconvey an intimation more delicately.\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Crump's little grandchild was born, entirely to the\r\ndissatisfaction, I must say, of his father; who, when the infant was\r\nbrought to him in the Fleet, had him abruptly covered up in his cloak\r\nagain, from which he had been removed by the jealous prison doorkeepers:\r\nwhy, do you think? Walker had a quarrel with one of them, and the wretch\r\npersisted in believing that the bundle Mrs. Crump was bringing to her\r\nson-in-law was a bundle of disguised brandy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brutes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady; \xe2\x80\x9cand the father's a brute, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe takes no more notice of me than if I was a kitchen-maid, and of\r\nWoolsey than if he was a leg of mutton--the dear blessed little cherub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Crump was a mother-in-law; let us pardon her hatred of her\r\ndaughter's husband.\r\n\r\nThe Woolsey compared in the above sentence both to a leg of mutton and\r\na cherub, was not the eminent member of the firm of Linsey, Woolsey, and\r\nCo., but the little baby, who was christened Howard Woolsey Walker, with\r\nthe full consent of the father; who said the tailor was a deuced good\r\nfellow, and felt really obliged to him for the sherry, for a frock-coat\r\nwhich he let him have in prison, and for his kindness to Morgiana. The\r\ntailor loved the little boy with all his soul; he attended his mother\r\nto her churching, and the child to the font; and, as a present to his\r\nlittle godson on his christening, he sent two yards of the finest white\r\nkerseymere in his shop, to make him a cloak. The Duke had had a pair of\r\ninexpressibles off that very piece.\r\n\r\nHouse-furniture is bought and sold, music-lessons are given, children\r\nare born and christened, ladies are confined and churched--time, in\r\nother words, passes--and yet Captain Walker still remains in prison!\r\nDoes it not seem strange that he should still languish there between\r\npalisaded walls near Fleet Market, and that he should not be restored to\r\nthat active and fashionable world of which he was an ornament? The fact\r\nis, the Captain had been before the court for the examination of his\r\ndebts; and the Commissioner, with a cruelty quite shameful towards\r\na fallen man, had qualified his ways of getting money in most severe\r\nlanguage, and had sent him back to prison again for the space of nine\r\ncalendar months, an indefinite period, and until his accounts could\r\nbe made up. This delay Walker bore like a philosopher, and, far from\r\nrepining, was still the gayest fellow of the tennis-court, and the soul\r\nof the midnight carouse.\r\n\r\nThere is no use in raking up old stories, and hunting through files\r\nof dead newspapers, to know what were the specific acts which made the\r\nCommissioner so angry with Captain Walker. Many a rogue has come before\r\nthe Court, and passed through it since then: and I would lay a wager\r\nthat Howard Walker was not a bit worse than his neighbours. But as he\r\nwas not a lord, and as he had no friends on coming out of prison, and\r\nhad settled no money on his wife, and had, as it must be confessed, an\r\nexceedingly bad character, it is not likely that the latter would\r\nbe forgiven him when once more free in the world. For instance, when\r\nDoublequits left the Fleet, he was received with open arms by his\r\nfamily, and had two-and-thirty horses in his stables before a week\r\nwas over. Pam, of the Dragoons, came out, and instantly got a place as\r\ngovernment courier--a place found so good of late years (and no wonder,\r\nit is better pay than that of a colonel), that our noblemen and gentry\r\neagerly press for it. Frank Hurricane was sent out as registrar of\r\nTobago, or Sago, or Ticonderago; in fact, for a younger son of good\r\nfamily it is rather advantageous to get into debt twenty or thirty\r\nthousand pounds: you are sure of a good place afterwards in the\r\ncolonies. Your friends are so anxious to get rid of you, that they will\r\nmove heaven and earth to serve you. And so all the above companions of\r\nmisfortune with Walker were speedily made comfortable; but HE had no\r\nrich parents; his old father was dead in York jail. How was he to start\r\nin the world again? What friendly hand was there to fill his pocket with\r\ngold, and his cup with sparkling champagne? He was, in fact, an object\r\nof the greatest pity--for I know of no greater than a gentleman of his\r\nhabits without the means of gratifying them. He must live well, and\r\nhe has not the means. Is there a more pathetic case? As for a mere low\r\nbeggar--some labourless labourer, or some weaver out of place--don't\r\nlet us throw away our compassion upon THEM. Psha! they're accustomed\r\nto starve. They CAN sleep upon boards, or dine off a crust; whereas\r\na gentleman would die in the same situation. I think this was poor\r\nMorgiana's way of reasoning. For Walker's cash in prison beginning\r\npresently to run low, and knowing quite well that the dear fellow could\r\nnot exist there without the luxuries to which he had been accustomed,\r\nshe borrowed money from her mother, until the poor old lady was a sec.\r\nShe even confessed, with tears, to Woolsey, that she was in particular\r\nwant of twenty pounds, to pay a poor milliner, whose debt she could not\r\nbear to put in her husband's schedule. And I need not say she carried\r\nthe money to her husband, who might have been greatly benefited by\r\nit--only he had a bad run of luck at the cards; and how the deuce can a\r\nman help THAT?\r\n\r\nWoolsey had repurchased for her one of the Cashmere shawls. She left it\r\nbehind her one day at the Fleet prison, and some rascal stole it there;\r\nhaving the grace, however, to send Woolsey the ticket, signifying the\r\nplace where it had been pawned. Who could the scoundrel have been?\r\nWoolsey swore a great oath, and fancied he knew; but if it was Walker\r\nhimself (as Woolsey fancied, and probably as was the case) who made away\r\nwith the shawl, being pressed thereto by necessity, was it fair to call\r\nhim a scoundrel for so doing, and should we not rather laud the delicacy\r\nof his proceeding? He was poor: who can command the cards? But he did\r\nnot wish his wife should know HOW poor: he could not bear that she\r\nshould suppose him arrived at the necessity of pawning a shawl.\r\n\r\nShe who had such beautiful ringlets, of a sudden pleaded cold in the\r\nhead, and took to wearing caps. One summer evening, as she and the baby\r\nand Mrs. Crump and Woolsey (let us say all four babies together) were\r\nlaughing and playing in Mrs. Crump's drawing-room--playing the most\r\nabsurd gambols, fat Mrs. Crump, for instance, hiding behind the sofa,\r\nWoolsey chuck-chucking, cock-a-doodle-dooing, and performing those\r\nindescribable freaks which gentlemen with philoprogenitive organs will\r\nexecute in the company of children--in the midst of their play the baby\r\ngave a tug at his mother's cap; off it came--her hair was cut close to\r\nher head!\r\n\r\nMorgiana turned as red as sealing-wax, and trembled very much; Mrs.\r\nCrump screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy child, where is your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d and Woolsey, bursting\r\nout with a most tremendous oath against Walker that would send Miss Prim\r\ninto convulsions, put his handkerchief to his face, and actually wept.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe infernal bubble-ubble-ackguard!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, roaring and clenching his\r\nfists.\r\n\r\nAs he had passed the Bower of Bloom a few days before, he saw Mossrose,\r\nwho was combing out a jet-black ringlet, and held it up, as if for\r\nWoolsey's examination, with a peculiar grin. The tailor did not\r\nunderstand the joke, but he saw now what had happened. Morgiana had sold\r\nher hair for five guineas; she would have sold her arm had her husband\r\nbidden her. On looking in her drawers it was found she had sold almost\r\nall her wearing apparel; the child's clothes were all there, however.\r\nIt was because her husband talked of disposing of a gilt coral that\r\nthe child had, that she had parted with the locks which had formed her\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll give you twenty guineas for that hair, you infamous fat coward,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n roared the little tailor to Eglantine that evening. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it up, or I'll\r\nkill you-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mossrose! Mr. Mossrose!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the perfumer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVell, vatsh de matter, vatsh de row, fight avay, my boys; two to one\r\non the tailor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mossrose, much enjoying the sport (for Woolsey,\r\nstriding through the shop without speaking to him, had rushed into the\r\nstudio, where he plumped upon Eglantine).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him about that hair, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat hair! Now keep yourself quiet, Mister Timble, and don't tink for\r\nto bully ME. You mean Mrs. Valker's 'air? Vy, she sold it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the more blackguard you for buying it! Will you take twenty guineas\r\nfor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mossrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mossrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it! will you take forty? There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI vish I'd kep it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hebrew gentleman, with unfeigned regret.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEglantine dressed it this very night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Countess Baldenstiern, the Swedish Hambassador's lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nEglantine (his Hebrew partner was by no means a favourite with the\r\nladies, and only superintended the accounts of the concern). \xe2\x80\x9cIt's this\r\nvery night at Devonshire 'Ouse, with four hostrich plumes, lappets, and\r\ntrimmings. And now, Mr. Woolsey, I'll trouble you to apologise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woolsey did not answer, but walked up to Mr. Eglantine, and snapped\r\nhis fingers so close under the perfumer's nose that the latter started\r\nback and seized the bell-rope. Mossrose burst out laughing, and the\r\ntailor walked majestically from the shop, with both hands stuck between\r\nthe lappets of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Morgiana a short time afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nnot encourage that husband of yours in his extravagance, and sell the\r\nclothes off your poor back that he may feast and act the fine gentleman\r\nin prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is his health, poor dear soul!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Walker: \xe2\x80\x9chis chest.\r\nEvery farthing of the money goes to the doctors, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now listen: I am a rich man\xe2\x80\x9d (it was a great fib, for Woolsey's\r\nincome, as a junior partner of the firm, was but a small one); \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nvery well afford to make him an allowance while he is in the Fleet, and\r\nhave written to him to say so. But if you ever give him a penny, or sell\r\na trinket belonging to you, upon my word and honour I will withdraw\r\nthe allowance, and, though it would go to my heart, I'll never see you\r\nagain. You wouldn't make me unhappy, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd go on my knees to serve you, and Heaven bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must give me this promise.\xe2\x80\x9d And she did. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother, and Podmore, and I have been talking over\r\nmatters, and we've agreed that you may make a very good income for\r\nyourself; though, to be sure, I wish it could have been managed any\r\nother way; but needs must, you know. You're the finest singer in the\r\nuniverse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgiana, highly delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ never heard anything like you, though I'm no judge. Podmore says he\r\nis sure you will do very well, and has no doubt you might get very good\r\nengagements at concerts or on the stage; and as that husband will never\r\ndo any good, and you have a child to support, sing you must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how glad I should be to pay his debts and repay all he has done for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of his giving two hundred guineas to Mr.\r\nBaroski to have me taught. Was not that kind of him? Do you REALLY think\r\nI should succeed?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's Miss Larkins has succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little high-shouldered vulgar thing!\xe2\x80\x9d says Morgiana. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure I\r\nought to succeed if SHE did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sing against Morgiana?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Crump. \xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to see her,\r\nindeed! She ain't fit to snuff a candle to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I don't understand the thing\r\nmyself: but if Morgiana can make a fortune, why shouldn't she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows we want it, Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Crump. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to see her on\r\nthe stage was always the wish of my heart:\xe2\x80\x9d and so it had formerly been\r\nthe wish of Morgiana; and now, with the hope of helping her husband and\r\nchild, the wish became a duty, and she fell to practising once more from\r\nmorning till night.\r\n\r\nOne of the most generous of men and tailors who ever lived now promised,\r\nif further instruction should be considered necessary (though that he\r\ncould hardly believe possible), that he would lend Morgiana any sum\r\nrequired for the payment of lessons; and accordingly she once more\r\nbetook herself, under Podmore's advice, to the singing school. Baroski's\r\nacademy was, after the passages between them, out of the question,\r\nand she placed herself under the instruction of the excellent English\r\ncomposer Sir George Thrum, whose large and awful wife, Lady Thrum,\r\ndragon of virtue and propriety, kept watch over the master and the\r\npupils, and was the sternest guardian of female virtue on or off any\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nMorgiana came at a propitious moment. Baroski had launched Miss Larkins\r\nunder the name of Ligonier. The Ligonier was enjoying considerable\r\nsuccess, and was singing classical music to tolerable audiences; whereas\r\nMiss Butts, Sir George's last pupil, had turned out a complete failure,\r\nand the rival house was only able to make a faint opposition to the new\r\nstar with Miss M'Whirter, who, though an old favourite, had lost her\r\nupper notes and her front teeth, and, the fact was, drew no longer.\r\n\r\nDirectly Sir George heard Mrs. Walker, he tapped Podmore, who\r\naccompanied her, on the waistcoat, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoddy, thank you; we'll\r\ncut the orange boy's throat with that voice.\xe2\x80\x9d It was by the familiar\r\ntitle of orange boy that the great Baroski was known among his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll crush him, Podmore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Thrum, in her deep hollow voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may stop and dine.\xe2\x80\x9d And Podmore stayed to dinner, and ate cold\r\nmutton, and drank Marsala with the greatest reverence for the great\r\nEnglish composer. The very next day Lady Thrum hired a pair of horses,\r\nand paid a visit to Mrs. Crump and her daughter at \xe2\x80\x9cSadler's Wells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these things were kept profoundly secret from Walker, who received\r\nvery magnanimously the allowance of two guineas a week which Woolsey\r\nmade him, and with the aid of the few shillings his wife could bring\r\nhim, managed to exist as best he might. He did not dislike gin when he\r\ncould get no claret, and the former liquor, under the name of \xe2\x80\x9ctape,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n used to be measured out pretty liberally in what was formerly Her\r\nMajesty's prison of the Fleet.\r\n\r\nMorgiana pursued her studies under Thrum, and we shall hear in the next\r\nchapter how it was she changed her name to RAVENSWING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. IN WHICH MORGIANA ADVANCES TOWARDS FAME AND HONOUR, AND IN\r\nWHICH SEVERAL GREAT LITERARY CHARACTERS MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must begin, my dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Thrum, \xe2\x80\x9cby unlearning\r\nall that Mr. Baroski (of whom I do not wish to speak with the slightest\r\ndisrespect) has taught you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorgiana knew that every professor says as much, and submitted to\r\nundergo the study requisite for Sir George's system with perfect good\r\ngrace. Au fond, as I was given to understand, the methods of the two\r\nartists were pretty similar; but as there was rivalry between them, and\r\ncontinual desertion of scholars from one school to another, it was\r\nfair for each to take all the credit he could get in the success of\r\nany pupil. If a pupil failed, for instance, Thrum would say Baroski had\r\nspoiled her irretrievably; while the German would regret \xe2\x80\x9cDat dat yong\r\nvoman, who had a good organ, should have trown away her dime wid dat old\r\nDrum.\xe2\x80\x9d When one of these deserters succeeded, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d would either\r\nprofessor cry, \xe2\x80\x9cI formed her; she owes her fortune to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Both of them\r\nthus, in future days, claimed the education of the famous Ravenswing;\r\nand even Sir George Thrum, though he wished to ecraser the Ligonier,\r\npretended that her present success was his work because once she had\r\nbeen brought by her mother, Mrs. Larkins, to sing for Sir George's\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nWhen the two professors met it was with the most delighted cordiality\r\non the part of both. \xe2\x80\x9cMein lieber Herr,\xe2\x80\x9d Thrum would say (with some\r\nmalice), \xe2\x80\x9cyour sonata in x flat is divine.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d Baroski would\r\nreply, \xe2\x80\x9cdat andante movement in w is worthy of Beethoven. I gif you\r\nmy sacred honour,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth. In fact, they loved each other as\r\ngentlemen in their profession always do.\r\n\r\nThe two famous professors conduct their academies on very opposite\r\nprinciples. Baroski writes ballet music; Thrum, on the contrary, says\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che cannot but deplore the dangerous fascinations of the dance,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwrites more for Exeter Hall and Birmingham. While Baroski drives a cab\r\nin the Park with a very suspicious Mademoiselle Leocadie, or Amenaide,\r\nby his side, you may see Thrum walking to evening church with his lady,\r\nand hymns are sung there of his own composition. He belongs to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthenaeum Club,\xe2\x80\x9d he goes to the Levee once a year, he does\r\neverything that a respectable man should; and if, by the means of this\r\nrespectability, he manages to make his little trade far more profitable\r\nthan it otherwise would be, are we to quarrel with him for it?\r\n\r\nSir George, in fact, had every reason to be respectable. He had been a\r\nchoir-boy at Windsor, had played to the old King's violoncello, had\r\nbeen intimate with him, and had received knighthood at the hand of his\r\nrevered sovereign. He had a snuff-box which His Majesty gave him, and\r\nportraits of him and the young princes all over the house. He had also\r\na foreign order (no other, indeed, than the Elephant and Castle of\r\nKalbsbraten-Pumpernickel), conferred upon him by the Grand Duke when\r\nhere with the allied sovereigns in 1814. With this ribbon round his\r\nneck, on gala days, and in a white waistcoat, the old gentleman looked\r\nsplendid as he moved along in a blue coat with the Windsor button, and\r\nneat black small-clothes, and silk stockings. He lived in an old tall\r\ndingy house, furnished in the reign of George III., his beloved master,\r\nand not much more cheerful now than a family vault. They are awfully\r\nfunereal, those ornaments of the close of the last century--tall gloomy\r\nhorse-hair chairs, mouldy Turkey carpets with wretched druggets to guard\r\nthem, little cracked sticking-plaster miniatures of people in tours and\r\npigtails over high-shouldered mantelpieces, two dismal urns on each side\r\nof a lanky sideboard, and in the midst a queer twisted receptacle\r\nfor worn-out knives with green handles. Under the sideboard stands a\r\ncellaret that looks as if it held half a bottle of currant wine, and\r\na shivering plate-warmer that never could get any comfort out of the\r\nwretched old cramped grate yonder. Don't you know in such houses the\r\ngrey gloom that hangs over the stairs, the dull-coloured old carpet that\r\nwinds its way up the same, growing thinner, duller, and more threadbare\r\nas it mounts to the bedroom floors? There is something awful in the\r\nbedroom of a respectable old couple of sixty-five. Think of the old\r\nfeathers, turbans, bugles, petticoats, pomatum-pots, spencers, white\r\nsatin shoes, false fronts, the old flaccid boneless stays tied up in\r\nfaded riband, the dusky fans, the old forty-years-old baby linen, the\r\nletters of Sir George when he was young, the doll of poor Maria who died\r\nin 1803, Frederick's first corduroy breeches, and the newspaper which\r\ncontains the account of his distinguishing himself at the siege of\r\nSeringapatam. All these lie somewhere, damp and squeezed down into glum\r\nold presses and wardrobes. At that glass the wife has sat many times\r\nthese fifty years; in that old morocco bed her children were born. Where\r\nare they now? Fred the brave captain, and Charles the saucy colleger:\r\nthere hangs a drawing of him done by Mr. Beechey, and that sketch by\r\nCosway was the very likeness of Louisa before--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fitz-Boodle! for Heaven's sake come down. What are you doing in a\r\nlady's bedroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, madam, I had no business there in life; but, having had\r\nquite enough wine with Sir George, my thoughts had wandered upstairs\r\ninto the sanctuary of female excellence, where your Ladyship nightly\r\nreposes. You do not sleep so well now as in old days, though there is no\r\npatter of little steps to wake you overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey call that room the nursery still, and the little wicket still hangs\r\nat the upper stairs: it has been there for forty years--bon Dieu! Can't\r\nyou see the ghosts of little faces peering over it? I wonder whether\r\nthey get up in the night as the moonlight shines into the blank vacant\r\nold room, and play there solemnly with little ghostly horses, and the\r\nspirits of dolls, and tops that turn and turn but don't hum.\r\n\r\nOnce more, sir, come down to the lower storey--that is to the Morgiana\r\nstory--with which the above sentences have no more to do than this\r\nmorning's leading article in The Times; only it was at this house of\r\nSir George Thrum's that I met Morgiana. Sir George, in old days, had\r\ninstructed some of the female members of our family, and I recollect\r\ncutting my fingers as a child with one of those attenuated green-handled\r\nknives in the queer box yonder.\r\n\r\nIn those days Sir George Thrum was the first great musical teacher\r\nof London, and the royal patronage brought him a great number of\r\nfashionable pupils, of whom Lady Fitz-Boodle was one. It was a long long\r\ntime ago: in fact, Sir George Thrum was old enough to remember persons\r\nwho had been present at Mr. Braham's first appearance, and the old\r\ngentleman's days of triumph had been those of Billington and Incledon,\r\nCatalani and Madame Storace.\r\n\r\nHe was the author of several operas (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Camel Driver,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBritons\r\nAlarmed; or, the Siege of Bergen-op-Zoom,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. etc.), and, of course,\r\nof songs which had considerable success in their day, but are forgotten\r\nnow, and are as much faded and out of fashion as those old carpets which\r\nwe have described in the professor's house, and which were, doubtless,\r\nvery brilliant once. But such is the fate of carpets, of flowers, of\r\nmusic, of men, and of the most admirable novels--even this story will\r\nnot be alive for many centuries. Well, well, why struggle against Fate?\r\n\r\nBut, though his heyday of fashion was gone, Sir George still held his\r\nplace among the musicians of the old school, conducted occasionally\r\nat the Ancient Concerts and the Philharmonic, and his glees are\r\nstill favourites after public dinners, and are sung by those old\r\nbacchanalians, in chestnut wigs, who attend for the purpose of amusing\r\nthe guests on such occasions of festivity. The great old people at\r\nthe gloomy old concerts before mentioned always pay Sir George marked\r\nrespect; and, indeed, from the old gentleman's peculiar behaviour to his\r\nsuperiors, it is impossible they should not be delighted with him, so he\r\nleads at almost every one of the concerts in the old-fashioned houses in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nBecomingly obsequious to his superiors, he is with the rest of the world\r\nproperly majestic, and has obtained no small success by his admirable\r\nand undeviating respectability. Respectability has been his great card\r\nthrough life; ladies can trust their daughters at Sir George Thrum's\r\nacademy. \xe2\x80\x9cA good musician, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d says he to the mother of a new pupil,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshould not only have a fine ear, a good voice, and an indomitable\r\nindustry, but, above all, a faultless character--faultless, that is, as\r\nfar as our poor nature will permit. And you will remark that those young\r\npersons with whom your lovely daughter, Miss Smith, will pursue her\r\nmusical studies, are all, in a moral point of view, as spotless as that\r\ncharming young lady. How should it be otherwise? I have been myself the\r\nfather of a family; I have been honoured with the intimacy of the wisest\r\nand best of kings, my late sovereign George III., and I can proudly show\r\nan example of decorum to my pupils in my Sophia. Mrs. Smith, I have the\r\nhonour of introducing to you my Lady Thrum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady would rise at this, and make a gigantic curtsey, such a\r\none as had begun the minuet at Ranelagh fifty years ago; and, the\r\nintroduction ended, Mrs. Smith would retire, after having seen the\r\nportraits of the princes, his late Majesty's snuff-box, and a piece of\r\nmusic which he used to play, noted by himself--Mrs. Smith, I say, would\r\ndrive back to Baker Street, delighted to think that her Frederica had\r\nsecured so eligible and respectable a master. I forgot to say that,\r\nduring the interview between Mrs. Smith and Sir George, the latter would\r\nbe called out of his study by his black servant, and my Lady Thrum would\r\ntake that opportunity of mentioning when he was knighted, and how he\r\ngot his foreign order, and deploring the sad condition of OTHER musical\r\nprofessors, and the dreadful immorality which sometimes arose in\r\nconsequence of their laxness. Sir George was a good deal engaged to\r\ndinners in the season, and if invited to dine with a nobleman, as he\r\nmight possibly be on the day when Mrs. Smith requested the honour of\r\nhis company, he would write back \xe2\x80\x9cthat he should have had the sincerest\r\nhappiness in waiting upon Mrs. Smith in Baker Street, if, previously, my\r\nLord Tweedledale had not been so kind as to engage him.\xe2\x80\x9d This letter,\r\nof course, shown by Mrs. Smith to her friends, was received by them with\r\nproper respect; and thus, in spite of age and new fashions, Sir George\r\nstill reigned pre-eminent for a mile round Cavendish Square. By the\r\nyoung pupils of the academy he was called Sir Charles Grandison;\r\nand, indeed, fully deserved this title on account of the indomitable\r\nrespectability of his whole actions.\r\n\r\nIt was under this gentleman that Morgiana made her debut in public life.\r\nI do not know what arrangements may have been made between Sir George\r\nThrum and his pupil regarding the profits which were to accrue to the\r\nformer from engagements procured by him for the latter; but there was,\r\nno doubt, an understanding between them. For Sir George, respectable as\r\nhe was, had the reputation of being extremely clever at a bargain; and\r\nLady Thrum herself, in her great high-tragedy way, could purchase a pair\r\nof soles or select a leg of mutton with the best housekeeper in London.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Morgiana had been for some six months under his tuition,\r\nhe began, for some reason or other, to be exceedingly hospitable, and\r\ninvited his friends to numerous entertainments: at one of which, as I\r\nhave said, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Walker.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worthy musician's dinners were not good, the old knight\r\nhad some excellent wine in his cellar, and his arrangement of his party\r\ndeserves to be commended.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he meets me and Bob Fitz-Urse in Pall Mall, at whose\r\npaternal house he was also a visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you come and dine with a poor musical composer? I have some\r\nComet hock, and, what is more curious to you, perhaps, as men of wit,\r\none or two of the great literary characters of London whom you would\r\nlike to see--quite curiosities, my dear young friends.\xe2\x80\x9d And we agreed to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nTo the literary men he says: \xe2\x80\x9cI have a little quiet party at home: Lord\r\nRoundtowers, the Honourable Mr. Fitz-Urse of the Life Guards, and a few\r\nmore. Can you tear yourself away from the war of wits, and take a quiet\r\ndinner with a few mere men about town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe literary men instantly purchase new satin stocks and white gloves,\r\nand are delighted to fancy themselves members of the world of fashion.\r\nInstead of inviting twelve Royal Academicians, or a dozen authors, or\r\na dozen men of science to dinner, as his Grace the Duke of ---- and the\r\nRight Honourable Sir Robert ---- are in the habit of doing once a\r\nyear, this plan of fusion is the one they should adopt. Not invite all\r\nartists, as they would invite all farmers to a rent dinner; but they\r\nshould have a proper commingling of artists and men of the world. There\r\nis one of the latter whose name is George Savage Fitz-Boodle, who-- But\r\nlet us return to Sir George Thrum.\r\n\r\nFitz-Urse and I arrive at the dismal old house, and are conducted up the\r\nstaircase by a black servant, who shouts out, \xe2\x80\x9cMissa Fiss-Boodle--the\r\nHONOURABLE Missa Fiss-Urse!\xe2\x80\x9d It was evident that Lady Thrum had\r\ninstructed the swarthy groom of the chambers (for there is nothing\r\nparticularly honourable in my friend Fitz's face that I know of, unless\r\nan abominable squint may be said to be so). Lady Thrum, whose figure is\r\nsomething like that of the shot-tower opposite Waterloo Bridge, makes a\r\nmajestic inclination and a speech to signify her pleasure at receiving\r\nunder her roof two of the children of Sir George's best pupils. A\r\nlady in black velvet is seated by the old fireplace, with whom a stout\r\ngentleman in an exceedingly light coat and ornamental waistcoat is\r\ntalking very busily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great star of the night,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers our host.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Walker, gentlemen--the RAVENSWING! She is talking to the famous\r\nMr. Slang, of the ---- Theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she a fine singer?\xe2\x80\x9d says Fitz-Urse. \xe2\x80\x9cShe's a very fine woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young friends, you shall hear to-night! I, who have heard every\r\nfine voice in Europe, confidently pledge my respectability that the\r\nRavenswing is equal to them all. She has the graces, sir, of a Venus\r\nwith the mind of a Muse. She is a siren, sir, without the dangerous\r\nqualities of one. She is hallowed, sir, by her misfortunes as by her\r\ngenius; and I am proud to think that my instructions have been the means\r\nof developing the wondrous qualities that were latent within her until\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't say so!\xe2\x80\x9d says gobemouche Fitz-Urse.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indoctrinated Mr. Fitz-Urse, Sir George takes another of his\r\nguests, and proceeds to work upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. Bludyer, how do you\r\ndo? Mr. Fitz-Boodle, Mr. Bludyer, the brilliant and accomplished\r\nwit, whose sallies in the Tomahawk delight us every Saturday. Nay, no\r\nblushes, my dear sir; you are very wicked, but oh! SO pleasant. Well,\r\nMr. Bludyer, I am glad to see you, sir, and hope you will have\r\na favourable opinion of our genius, sir. As I was saying to Mr.\r\nFitz-Boodle, she has the graces of a Venus with the mind of a Muse. She\r\nis a siren, without the dangerous qualities of one,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. This\r\nlittle speech was made to half-a-dozen persons in the course of the\r\nevening--persons, for the most part, connected with the public journals\r\nor the theatrical world. There was Mr. Squinny, the editor of the\r\nFlowers of Fashion; Mr. Desmond Mulligan, the poet, and reporter for\r\na morning paper; and other worthies of their calling. For though\r\nSir George is a respectable man, and as high-minded and moral an old\r\ngentleman as ever wore knee-buckles, he does not neglect the little arts\r\nof popularity, and can condescend to receive very queer company if need\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at the dinner-party at which I had the honour of\r\nassisting, and at which, on the right hand of Lady Thrum, sat the oblige\r\nnobleman, whom the Thrums were a great deal too wise to omit (the sight\r\nof a lord does good to us commoners, or why else should we be so anxious\r\nto have one?). In the second place of honour, and on her ladyship's left\r\nhand, sat Mr. Slang, the manager of one of the theatres; a gentleman\r\nwhom my Lady Thrum would scarcely, but for a great necessity's sake,\r\nhave been induced to invite to her table. He had the honour of leading\r\nMrs. Walker to dinner, who looked splendid in black velvet and turban,\r\nfull of health and smiles.\r\n\r\nLord Roundtowers is an old gentleman who has been at the theatres five\r\ntimes a week for these fifty years, a living dictionary of the stage,\r\nrecollecting every actor and actress who has appeared upon it for half a\r\ncentury. He perfectly well remembered Miss Delancy in Morgiana; he knew\r\nwhat had become of Ali Baba, and how Cassim had left the stage, and was\r\nnow the keeper of a public-house. All this store of knowledge he\r\nkept quietly to himself, or only delivered in confidence to his next\r\nneighbour in the intervals of the banquet, which he enjoys prodigiously.\r\nHe lives at an hotel: if not invited to dine, eats a mutton-chop\r\nvery humbly at his club, and finishes his evening after the play at\r\nCrockford's, whither he goes not for the sake of the play, but of the\r\nsupper there. He is described in the Court Guide as of \xe2\x80\x9cSimmer's Hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and of Roundtowers, county Cork. It is said that the round towers really\r\nexist. But he has not been in Ireland since the rebellion; and his\r\nproperty is so hampered with ancestral mortgages, and rent-charges, and\r\nannuities, that his income is barely sufficient to provide the modest\r\nmutton-chop before alluded to. He has, any time these fifty years, lived\r\nin the wickedest company in London, and is, withal, as harmless, mild,\r\ngood-natured, innocent an old gentleman as can readily be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoundy,\xe2\x80\x9d shouts the elegant Mr. Slang, across the table, with a voice\r\nwhich makes Lady Thrum shudder, \xe2\x80\x9cTuff, a glass of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy Lord replies meekly, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Slang, I shall have very much pleasure.\r\nWhat shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Madeira near you, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lady, pointing to a tall\r\nthin decanter of the fashion of the year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadeira! Marsala, by Jove, your Ladyship means!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts Mr. Slang. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno, old birds are not caught with chaff. Thrum, old boy, let's have some\r\nof your Comet hock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lady Thrum, I believe that IS Marsala,\xe2\x80\x9d says the knight, blushing a\r\nlittle, in reply to a question from his Sophia. \xe2\x80\x9cAjax, the hock to Mr.\r\nSlang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm in that,\xe2\x80\x9d yells Bludyer from the end of the table. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I'll\r\njoin you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. ----, I beg your pardon--I shall be very happy to take wine with\r\nyou, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Mr. Bludyer, the celebrated newspaper writer,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers Lady\r\nThrum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBludyer, Bludyer? A very clever man, I dare say. He has a very loud\r\nvoice, and reminds me of Brett. Does your Ladyship remember Brett, who\r\nplayed the 'Fathers' at the Haymarket in 1802?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an old stupid Roundtowers is!\xe2\x80\x9d says Slang, archly, nudging Mrs.\r\nWalker in the side. \xe2\x80\x9cHow's Walker, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband is in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Walker, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGammon! _I_ know where he is! Law bless you!--don't blush. I've been\r\nthere myself a dozen times. We were talking about quod, Lady Thrum. Were\r\nyou ever in college?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at the Commemoration at Oxford in 1814, when the sovereigns were\r\nthere, and at Cambridge when Sir George received his degree of Doctor of\r\nMusic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaud, Laud, THAT'S not the college WE mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is also the college in Gower Street, where my grandson--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the college in QUEER STREET, ma'am, haw, haw! Mulligan, you\r\ndivvle (in an Irish accent), a glass of wine with you. Wine, here, you\r\nwaiter! What's your name, you black nigger? 'Possum up a gum-tree, eh?\r\nFill him up. Dere he go\xe2\x80\x9d (imitating the Mandingo manner of speaking\r\nEnglish)\r\n\r\nIn this agreeable way would Mr. Slang rattle on, speedily making himself\r\nthe centre of the conversation, and addressing graceful familiarities to\r\nall the gentlemen and ladies round him.\r\n\r\nIt was good to see how the little knight, the most moral and calm of\r\nmen, was compelled to receive Mr. Slang's stories and the frightened air\r\nwith which, at the conclusion of one of them, he would venture upon\r\na commendatory grin. His lady, on her part too, had been laboriously\r\ncivil; and, on the occasion on which I had the honour of meeting this\r\ngentleman and Mrs. Walker, it was the latter who gave the signal for\r\nwithdrawing to the lady of the house, by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI think, Lady Thrum,\r\nit is quite time for us to retire.\xe2\x80\x9d Some exquisite joke of Mr. Slang's\r\nwas the cause of this abrupt disappearance. But, as they went upstairs\r\nto the drawing-room, Lady Thrum took occasion to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, in\r\nthe course of your profession you will have to submit to many such\r\nfamiliarities on the part of persons of low breeding, such as I fear Mr.\r\nSlang is. But let me caution you against giving way to your temper\r\nas you did. Did you not perceive that _I_ never allowed him to see my\r\ninward dissatisfaction? And I make it a particular point that you should\r\nbe very civil to him to-night. Your interests--our interests depend upon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are my interests to make me civil to a wretch like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Walker, would you wish to give lessons in morality and behaviour\r\nto Lady Thrum?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, drawing herself up with great\r\ndignity. It was evident that she had a very strong desire indeed to\r\nconciliate Mr. Slang; and hence I have no doubt that Sir George was to\r\nhave a considerable share of Morgiana's earnings.\r\n\r\nMr. Bludyer, the famous editor of the Tomahawk, whose jokes Sir George\r\npretended to admire so much (Sir George who never made a joke in his\r\nlife), was a press bravo of considerable talent and no principle, and\r\nwho, to use his own words, would \xe2\x80\x9cback himself for a slashing article\r\nagainst any man in England!\xe2\x80\x9d He would not only write, but fight on a\r\npinch; was a good scholar, and as savage in his manner as with his\r\npen. Mr. Squinny is of exactly the opposite school, as delicate as\r\nmilk-and-water, harmless in his habits, fond of the flute when the state\r\nof his chest will allow him, a great practiser of waltzing and dancing\r\nin general, and in his journal mildly malicious. He never goes beyond\r\nthe bounds of politeness, but manages to insinuate a great deal that is\r\ndisagreeable to an author in the course of twenty lines of criticism.\r\nPersonally he is quite respectable, and lives with two maiden aunts at\r\nBrompton. Nobody, on the contrary, knows where Mr. Bludyer lives. He has\r\nhouses of call, mysterious taverns, where he may be found at particular\r\nhours by those who need him, and where panting publishers are in the\r\nhabit of hunting him up. For a bottle of wine and a guinea he will write\r\na page of praise or abuse of any man living, or on any subject, or on\r\nany line of politics. \xe2\x80\x9cHang it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cpay me enough and I will\r\nwrite down my own father!\xe2\x80\x9d According to the state of his credit, he\r\nis dressed either almost in rags or else in the extremest flush of the\r\nfashion. With the latter attire he puts on a haughty and aristocratic\r\nair, and would slap a duke on the shoulder. If there is one thing more\r\ndangerous than to refuse to lend him a sum of money when he asks for it,\r\nit is to lend it to him; for he never pays, and never pardons a man to\r\nwhom he owes. \xe2\x80\x9cWalker refused to cash a bill for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he had been heard\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cand I'll do for his wife when she comes out on the stage!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nWalker and Sir George Thrum were in an agony about the Tomahawk; hence\r\nthe latter's invitation to Mr. Bludyer. Sir George was in a great tremor\r\nabout the Flowers of Fashion, hence his invitation to Mr. Squinny. Mr.\r\nSquinny was introduced to Lord Roundtowers and Mr. Fitz-Urse as one of\r\nthe most delightful and talented of our young men of genius; and Fitz,\r\nwho believes everything anyone tells him, was quite pleased to have\r\nthe honour of sitting near the live editor of a paper. I have reason to\r\nthink that Mr. Squinny himself was no less delighted: I saw him giving\r\nhis card to Fitz-Urse at the end of the second course.\r\n\r\nNo particular attention was paid to Mr. Desmond Mulligan. Political\r\nenthusiasm is his forte. He lives and writes in a rapture. He is,\r\nof course, a member of an inn of court, and greatly addicted to\r\nafter-dinner speaking as a preparation for the bar, where as a young man\r\nof genius he hopes one day to shine. He is almost the only man to whom\r\nBludyer is civil; for, if the latter will fight doggedly when there is\r\na necessity for so doing, the former fights like an Irishman, and has a\r\npleasure in it. He has been \xe2\x80\x9con the ground\xe2\x80\x9d I don't know how many\r\ntimes, and quitted his country on account of a quarrel with Government\r\nregarding certain articles published by him in the Phoenix newspaper.\r\nWith the third bottle, he becomes overpoweringly great on the wrongs\r\nof Ireland, and at that period generally volunteers a couple or more of\r\nIrish melodies, selecting the most melancholy in the collection. At five\r\nin the afternoon, you are sure to see him about the House of Commons,\r\nand he knows the \xe2\x80\x9cReform Club\xe2\x80\x9d (he calls it the Refawrum) as well as if\r\nhe were a member. It is curious for the contemplative mind to mark those\r\nmysterious hangers-on of Irish members of Parliament--strange runners\r\nand aides-de-camp which all the honourable gentlemen appear to possess.\r\nDesmond, in his political capacity, is one of these, and besides his\r\ncalling as reporter to a newspaper, is \xe2\x80\x9cour well-informed correspondent\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n of that famous Munster paper, the Green Flag of Skibbereen.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Mulligan's qualities and history I only became subsequently\r\nacquainted. On the present evening he made but a brief stay at the\r\ndinner-table, being compelled by his professional duties to attend the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe above formed the party with whom I had the honour to dine. What\r\nother repasts Sir George Thrum may have given, what assemblies of men\r\nof mere science he may have invited to give their opinion regarding his\r\nprodigy, what other editors of papers he may have pacified or rendered\r\nfavourable, who knows? On the present occasion, we did not quit the\r\ndinner-table until Mr. Slang the manager was considerably excited\r\nby wine, and music had been heard for some time in the drawing-room\r\noverhead during our absence. An addition had been made to the Thrum\r\nparty by the arrival of several persons to spend the evening,--a man to\r\nplay on the violin between the singing, a youth to play on the piano,\r\nMiss Horsman to sing with Mrs. Walker, and other scientific characters.\r\nIn a corner sat a red-faced old lady, of whom the mistress of the\r\nmansion took little notice; and a gentleman with a royal button, who\r\nblushed and looked exceedingly modest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang me!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Bludyer, who had perfectly good reasons for\r\nrecognising Mr Woolsey, and who on this day chose to assume his\r\naristocratic air; \xe2\x80\x9cthere's a tailor in the room! What do they mean by\r\nasking ME to meet tradesmen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelancy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Slang, entering the room with a reel, \xe2\x80\x9chow's\r\nyour precious health? Give us your hand! When ARE we to be married? Make\r\nroom for me on the sofa, that's a duck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along, Slang,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Crump, addressed by the manager by her\r\nmaiden name (artists generally drop the title of honour which people\r\nadopt in the world, and call each other by their simple surnames)--\xe2\x80\x9cget\r\nalong, Slang, or I'll tell Mrs. S.!\xe2\x80\x9d The enterprising manager replies by\r\nsportively striking Mrs. Crump on the side a blow which causes a great\r\ngiggle from the lady insulted, and a most good-humoured threat to box\r\nSlang's ears. I fear very much that Morgiana's mother thought Mr. Slang\r\nan exceedingly gentlemanlike and agreeable person; besides, she was\r\neager to have his good opinion of Mrs. Walker's singing.\r\n\r\nThe manager stretched himself out with much gracefulness on the sofa,\r\nsupporting two little dumpy legs encased in varnished boots on a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAjax, some tea to Mr. Slang,\xe2\x80\x9d said my Lady, looking towards that\r\ngentleman with a countenance expressive of some alarm, I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's right, Ajax, my black prince!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Slang when the negro\r\nbrought the required refreshment; \xe2\x80\x9cand now I suppose you'll be wanted in\r\nthe orchestra yonder. Don't Ajax play the cymbals, Sir George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha! very good--capital!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the knight, exceedingly\r\nfrightened; \xe2\x80\x9cbut ours is not a MILITARY band. Miss Horsman, Mr. Craw,\r\nmy dear Mrs. Ravenswing, shall we begin the trio? Silence, gentlemen, if\r\nyou please; it is a little piece from my opera of the 'Brigand's Bride.'\r\nMiss Horsman takes the Page's part, Mr. Craw is Stiletto the Brigand, my\r\naccomplished pupil is the Bride;\xe2\x80\x9d and the music began.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cTHE BRIDE.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart with joy is beating,\r\n        My eyes with tears are dim;\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cTHE PAGE.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHer heart with joy is beating\r\n        Her eyes are fixed on him;\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cTHE BRIGAND.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart with rage is beating,\r\n        In blood my eye-balls swim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat may have been the merits of the music or the singing, I, of course,\r\ncannot guess. Lady Thrum sat opposite the tea-cups, nodding her head\r\nand beating time very gravely. Lord Roundtowers, by her side, nodded his\r\nhead too, for awhile, and then fell asleep. I should have done the same\r\nbut for the manager, whose actions were worth of remark. He sang with\r\nall the three singers, and a great deal louder than any of them; he\r\nshouted bravo! or hissed as he thought proper; he criticised all the\r\npoints of Mrs. Walker's person. \xe2\x80\x9cShe'll do, Crump, she'll do--a splendid\r\narm--you'll see her eyes in the shilling gallery! What sort of a\r\nfoot has she? She's five feet three, if she's an inch! Bravo--slap\r\nup--capital--hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d And he concluded by saying, with the aid of the\r\nRavenswing, he would put Ligonier's nose out of Joint!\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of Mr. Slang almost reconciled Lady Thrum to the\r\nabruptness of his manners, and even caused Sir George to forget that\r\nhis chorus had been interrupted by the obstreperous familiarity of the\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do YOU think, Mr. Bludyer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor, delighted that\r\nhis protegee should be thus winning all hearts: \xe2\x80\x9cisn't Mrs. Walker a\r\ntip-top singer, eh, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she's a very bad one, Mr. Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the illustrious\r\nauthor, wishing to abbreviate all communications with a tailor to whom\r\nhe owed forty pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Woolsey, fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll--I'll thank you to pay me\r\nmy little bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is true there was no connection between Mrs. Walker's singing and\r\nWoolsey's little bill; that the \xe2\x80\x9cTHEN, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was perfectly illogical on\r\nWoolsey's part; but it was a very happy hit for the future fortunes of\r\nMrs. Walker. Who knows what would have come of her debut but for that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and whether a \xe2\x80\x9csmashing article\xe2\x80\x9d from the Tomahawk might\r\nnot have ruined her for ever?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a relation of Mrs. Walker's?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bludyer, in reply to the\r\nangry tailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's that to you, whether I am or not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Woolsey, fiercely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I'm the friend of Mrs. Walker, sir; proud am I to say so, sir; and,\r\nas the poet says, sir, 'a little learning's a dangerous thing,' sir;\r\nand I think a man who don't pay his bills may keep his tongue quiet at\r\nleast, sir, and not abuse a lady, sir, whom everybody else praises,\r\nsir. You shan't humbug ME any more, sir; you shall hear from my attorney\r\nto-morrow, so mark that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, my dear Mr. Woolsey,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the literary man, \xe2\x80\x9cdon't make a\r\nnoise; come into this window: is Mrs. Walker REALLY a friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've told you so, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case, I shall do my utmost to serve her and, look you,\r\nWoolsey, any article you choose to send about her to the Tomahawk I\r\npromise you I'll put in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILL you, though? then we'll say nothing about the little bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may do on that point,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bludyer, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cexactly as\r\nyou please. I am not to be frightened from my duty, mind that; and mind,\r\ntoo, that I can write a slashing article better than any man in England:\r\nI could crush her by ten lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tables were now turned, and it was Woolsey's turn to be alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! I WAS angry,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you abuse Mrs. Walker,\r\nwho's an angel on earth; but I'm very willing to apologise. I\r\nsay--come--let me take your measure for some new clothes, eh! Mr. B.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll come to your shop,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the literary man, quite appeased.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence! they're beginning another song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe songs, which I don't attempt to describe (and, upon my word and\r\nhonour, as far as I can understand matters, I believe to this day that\r\nMrs. Walker was only an ordinary singer)--the songs lasted a great deal\r\nlonger than I liked; but I was nailed, as it were, to the spot, having\r\nagreed to sup at Knightsbridge barracks with Fitz-Urse, whose carriage\r\nwas ordered at eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. Fitz-Boodle,\xe2\x80\x9d said our old host to me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do me the\r\ngreatest service in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you ask your honourable and gallant friend, the Captain, to drive\r\nhome Mr. Squinny to Brompton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't Mr. Squinny get a cab?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir George looked particularly arch. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneralship, my dear young\r\nfriend--a little harmless generalship. Mr. Squinny will not give much\r\nfor MY opinion of my pupil, but he will value very highly the opinion of\r\nthe Honourable Mr. FitzUrse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moral man, was not the little knight a clever fellow? He had\r\nbought Mr. Squinny for a dinner worth ten shillings, and for a ride in\r\na carriage with a lord's son. Squinny was carried to Brompton, and set\r\ndown at his aunts' door, delighted with his new friends, and exceedingly\r\nsick with a cigar they had made him smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. IN WHICH MR. WALKER SHOWS GREAT PRUDENCE AND FORBEARANCE.\r\n\r\nThe describing of all these persons does not advance Morgiana's story\r\nmuch. But, perhaps, some country readers are not acquainted with the\r\nclass of persons by whose printed opinions they are guided, and are\r\nsimple enough to imagine that mere merit will make a reputation on the\r\nstage or elsewhere. The making of a theatrical success is a much more\r\ncomplicated and curious thing than such persons fancy it to be. Immense\r\nare the pains taken to get a good word from Mr. This of the Star, or Mr.\r\nThat of the Courier, to propitiate the favour of the critic of the day,\r\nand get the editors of the metropolis into a good humour,--above all, to\r\nhave the name of the person to be puffed perpetually before the public.\r\nArtists cannot be advertised like Macassar oil or blacking, and they\r\nwant it to the full as much; hence endless ingenuity must be practised\r\nin order to keep the popular attention awake. Suppose a great actor\r\nmoves from London to Windsor, the Brentford Champion must state that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday Mr. Blazes and suite passed rapidly through our city; the\r\ncelebrated comedian is engaged, we hear, at Windsor, to give some of his\r\ninimitable readings of our great national bard to the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS\r\nAUDIENCE in the realm.\xe2\x80\x9d This piece of intelligence the Hammersmith\r\nObserver will question the next week, as thus:--\xe2\x80\x9cA contemporary, the\r\nBrentford Champion, says that Blazes is engaged to give Shakspearian\r\nreadings at Windsor to \xe2\x80\x9cthe most illustrious audience in the realm.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nquestion this fact very much. We would, indeed, that it were true; but\r\nthe MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AUDIENCE in the realm prefer FOREIGN melodies to\r\nTHE NATIVE WOOD-NOTES WILD of the sweet song-bird of Avon. Mr. Blazes\r\nis simply gone to Eton, where his son, Master Massinger Blazes, is\r\nsuffering, we regret to hear, under a severe attack of the chicken-pox.\r\nThis complaint (incident to youth) has raged, we understand, with\r\nfrightful virulence in Eton School.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd if, after the above paragraphs, some London paper chooses to attack\r\nthe folly of the provincial press, which talks of Mr. Blazes, and\r\nchronicles his movements, as if he were a crowned head, what harm is\r\ndone? Blazes can write in his own name to the London journal, and say\r\nthat it is not HIS fault if provincial journals choose to chronicle\r\nhis movements, and that he was far from wishing that the afflictions of\r\nthose who are dear to him should form the subject of public comment,\r\nand be held up to public ridicule. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had no intention of hurting the\r\nfeelings of an estimable public servant,\xe2\x80\x9d writes the editor; \xe2\x80\x9cand our\r\nremarks on the chicken-pox were general, not personal. We sincerely\r\ntrust that Master Massinger Blazes has recovered from that complaint,\r\nand that he may pass through the measles, the whooping-cough, the fourth\r\nform, and all other diseases to which youth is subject, with comfort to\r\nhimself, and credit to his parents and teachers.\xe2\x80\x9d At his next appearance\r\non the stage after this controversy, a British public calls for Blazes\r\nthree times after the play; and somehow there is sure to be someone with\r\na laurel-wreath in a stage-box, who flings that chaplet at the inspired\r\nartist's feet.\r\n\r\nI don't know how it was, but before the debut of Morgiana, the English\r\npress began to heave and throb in a convulsive manner, as if indicative\r\nof the near birth of some great thing. For instance, you read in one\r\npaper,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnecdote of Karl Maria Von Weber.--When the author of 'Oberon' was in\r\nEngland, he was invited by a noble duke to dinner, and some of the most\r\ncelebrated of our artists were assembled to meet him. The signal being\r\ngiven to descend to the salle-a-manger, the German composer was invited\r\nby his noble host (a bachelor) to lead the way. 'Is it not the fashion\r\nin your country,' said he, simply, 'for the man of the first eminence to\r\ntake the first place? Here is one whose genius entitles him to be first\r\nANYWHERE.' And, so saying, he pointed to our admirable English composer,\r\nSir George Thrum. The two musicians were friends to the last, and Sir\r\nGeorge has still the identical piece of rosin which the author of the\r\n'Freischutz' gave him.\xe2\x80\x9d--The Moon (morning paper), June 2.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge III. a composer.--Sir George Thrum has in his possession the\r\nscore of an air, the words from 'Samson Agonistes,' an autograph of the\r\nlate revered monarch. We hear that that excellent composer has in store\r\nfor us not only an opera, but a pupil, with whose transcendent merits\r\nthe elite of our aristocracy are already familiar.\xe2\x80\x9d--Ibid., June 5.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMusic with a Vengeance.--The march to the sound of which the 49th and\r\n75th regiments rushed up the breach of Badajoz was the celebrated air\r\nfrom 'Britons Alarmed; or, The Siege of Bergen-op-Zoom,' by our famous\r\nEnglish composer, Sir George Thrum. Marshal Davoust said that the\r\nFrench line never stood when that air was performed to the charge of the\r\nbayonet. We hear the veteran musician has an opera now about to\r\nappear, and have no doubt that Old England will now, as then, show its\r\nsuperiority over ALL foreign opponents.\xe2\x80\x9d--Albion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been accused of preferring the produit of the etranger to the\r\ntalent of our own native shores; but those who speak so, little know\r\nus. We are fanatici per la musica wherever it be, and welcome merit dans\r\nchaque pays du monde. What do we say? Le merite n'a point de pays, as\r\nNapoleon said; and Sir George Thrum (Chevalier de l'Ordre de l'Elephant\r\net Chateau de Kalbsbraten-Pumpernickel,) is a maestro whose fame\r\nappartient a l'Europe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have just heard the lovely eleve, whose rare qualities the Cavaliere\r\nhas brought to perfection,--we have heard THE RAVENSWING (pourquoi\r\ncacher un nom que demain un monde va saluer?), and a creature more\r\nbeautiful and gifted never bloomed before dans nos climats. She sang\r\nthe delicious duet of the 'Nabucodonosore,' with Count Pizzicato, with\r\na bellezza, a grandezza, a raggio, that excited in the bosom of the\r\naudience a corresponding furore: her scherzando was exquisite, though we\r\nconfess we thought the concluding fioritura in the passage in Y flat a\r\nleetle, a very leetle sforzata. Surely the words,\r\n\r\n     'Giorno d'orrore,\r\n      Delire, dolore,\r\n      Nabucodonosore,'\r\n\r\nshould be given andante, and not con strepito: but this is a faute bien\r\nlegere in the midst of such unrivalled excellence, and only mentioned\r\nhere that we may have SOMETHING to criticise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hear that the enterprising impresario of one of the royal theatres\r\nhas made an engagement with the Diva; and, if we have a regret, it is\r\nthat she should be compelled to sing in the unfortunate language of our\r\nrude northern clime, which does not preter itself near so well to the\r\nbocca of the cantatrice as do the mellifluous accents of the Lingua\r\nToscana, the langue par excellence of song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ravenswing's voice is a magnificent contra-basso of nine octaves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n etc.--Flowers of Fashion, June 10.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Thrum, the composer, is bringing out an opera and a pupil. The\r\nopera is good, the pupil first-rate. The opera will do much more than\r\ncompete with the infernal twaddle and disgusting slip-slop of Donizetti,\r\nand the milk-and-water fools who imitate him: it will (and we ask the\r\nreaders of the Tomahawk, were we EVER mistaken?) surpass all these; it\r\nis GOOD, of downright English stuff. The airs are fresh and pleasing,\r\nthe choruses large and noble, the instrumentation solid and rich, the\r\nmusic is carefully written. We wish old Thrum and his opera well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis pupil is a SURE CARD, a splendid woman, and a splendid singer. She\r\nis so handsome that she might sing as much out of tune as Miss Ligonier,\r\nand the public would forgive her; and sings so well, that were she as\r\nugly as the aforesaid Ligonier, the audience would listen to her. The\r\nRavenswing, that is her fantastical theatrical name (her real name is\r\nthe same with that of a notorious scoundrel in the Fleet, who invented\r\nthe Panama swindle, the Pontine Marshes' swindle, the Soap swindle--HOW\r\nARE YOU OFF FOR SOAP NOW, Mr. W-lk-r?)--the Ravenswing, we say, will do.\r\nSlang has engaged her at thirty guineas per week, and she appears next\r\nmonth in Thrum's opera, of which the words are written by a great ass\r\nwith some talent--we mean Mr. Mulligan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a foreign fool in the Flowers of Fashion who is doing his best\r\nto disgust the public by his filthy flattery. It is enough to make\r\none sick. Why is the foreign beast not kicked out of the paper?\xe2\x80\x9d--The\r\nTomahawk, June 17.\r\n\r\nThe first three \xe2\x80\x9canecdotes\xe2\x80\x9d were supplied by Mulligan to his paper,\r\nwith many others which need not here be repeated: he kept them up\r\nwith amazing energy and variety. Anecdotes of Sir George Thrum met you\r\nunexpectedly in queer corners of country papers: puffs of the English\r\nschool of music appeared perpetually in \xe2\x80\x9cNotices to Correspondents\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe Sunday prints, some of which Mr. Slang commanded, and in others over\r\nwhich the indefatigable Mulligan had a control. This youth was the soul\r\nof the little conspiracy for raising Morgiana into fame: and humble as\r\nhe is, and great and respectable as is Sir George Thrum, it is my belief\r\nthat the Ravenswing would never have been the Ravenswing she is but for\r\nthe ingenuity and energy of the honest Hibernian reporter.\r\n\r\nIt is only the business of the great man who writes the leading articles\r\nwhich appear in the large type of the daily papers to compose those\r\nastonishing pieces of eloquence; the other parts of the paper are\r\nleft to the ingenuity of the sub-editor, whose duty it is to select\r\nparagraphs, reject or receive horrid accidents, police reports,\r\netc.; with which, occupied as he is in the exercise of his tremendous\r\nfunctions, the editor himself cannot be expected to meddle. The fate\r\nof Europe is his province; the rise and fall of empires, and the great\r\nquestions of State demand the editor's attention: the humble puff,\r\nthe paragraph about the last murder, or the state of the crops, or the\r\nsewers in Chancery Lane, is confided to the care of the sub; and it\r\nis curious to see what a prodigious number of Irishmen exist among the\r\nsub-editors of London. When the Liberator enumerates the services of his\r\ncountrymen, how the battle of Fontenoy was won by the Irish Brigade, how\r\nthe battle of Waterloo would have been lost but for the Irish regiments,\r\nand enumerates other acts for which we are indebted to Milesian heroism\r\nand genius--he ought at least to mention the Irish brigade of the press,\r\nand the amazing services they do to this country.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Irish reporters and soldiers appear to do their duty\r\nright well; and my friend Mr. Mulligan is one of the former. Having the\r\ninterests of his opera and the Ravenswing strongly at heart, and being\r\namongst his brethren an exceedingly popular fellow, he managed matters\r\nso that never a day passed but some paragraph appeared somewhere\r\nregarding the new singer, in whom, for their countryman's sake, all his\r\nbrothers and sub-editors felt an interest.\r\n\r\nThese puffs, destined to make known to all the world the merits of\r\nthe Ravenswing, of course had an effect upon a gentleman very closely\r\nconnected with that lady, the respectable prisoner in the Fleet, Captain\r\nWalker. As long as he received his weekly two guineas from Mr. Woolsey,\r\nand the occasional half-crowns which his wife could spare in her almost\r\ndaily visits to him, he had never troubled himself to inquire what her\r\npursuits were, and had allowed her (though the worthy woman longed with\r\nall her might to betray herself) to keep her secret. He was far from\r\nthinking, indeed, that his wife would prove such a treasure to him.\r\n\r\nBut when the voice of fame and the columns of the public journals\r\nbrought him each day some new story regarding the merits, genius, and\r\nbeauty of the Ravenswing; when rumours reached him that she was the\r\nfavourite pupil of Sir George Thrum; when she brought him five guineas\r\nafter singing at the \xe2\x80\x9cPhilharmonic\xe2\x80\x9d (other five the good soul had spent\r\nin purchasing some smart new cockades, hats, cloaks, and laces, for her\r\nlittle son); when, finally, it was said that Slang, the great manager,\r\noffered her an engagement at thirty guineas per week, Mr. Walker became\r\nexceedingly interested in his wife's proceedings, of which he demanded\r\nfrom her the fullest explanation.\r\n\r\nUsing his marital authority, he absolutely forbade Mrs. Walker's\r\nappearance on the public stage; he wrote to Sir George Thrum a letter\r\nexpressive of his highest indignation that negotiations so important\r\nshould ever have been commenced without his authorisation; and he wrote\r\nto his dear Slang (for these gentlemen were very intimate, and in the\r\ncourse of his transactions as an agent Mr. W. had had many dealings\r\nwith Mr. S.) asking his dear Slang whether the latter thought his friend\r\nWalker would be so green as to allow his wife to appear on the stage,\r\nand he remain in prison with all his debts on his head?\r\n\r\nAnd it was a curious thing now to behold how eager those very creditors\r\nwho but yesterday (and with perfect correctness) had denounced Mr.\r\nWalker as a swindler; who had refused to come to any composition with\r\nhim, and had sworn never to release him; how they on a sudden became\r\nquite eager to come to an arrangement with him, and offered, nay, begged\r\nand prayed him to go free,--only giving them his own and Mrs. Walker's\r\nacknowledgment of their debt, with a promise that a part of the lady's\r\nsalary should be devoted to the payment of the claim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady's salary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Walker, indignantly, to these gentlemen\r\nand their attorneys. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I will allow Mrs. Walker to go on\r\nthe stage?--do you suppose I am such a fool as to sign bills to the full\r\namount of these claims against me, when in a few months more I can walk\r\nout of prison without paying a shilling? Gentlemen, you take Howard\r\nWalker for an idiot. I like the Fleet, and rather than pay I'll stay\r\nhere for these ten years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn other words, it was the Captain's determination to make some\r\nadvantageous bargain for himself with his creditors and the gentlemen\r\nwho were interested in bringing forward Mrs. Walker on the stage. And\r\nwho can say that in so determining he did not act with laudable prudence\r\nand justice?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not, surely, consider, my very dear sir, that half the amount of\r\nMrs. Walker's salaries is too much for my immense trouble and pains in\r\nteaching her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir George Thrum (who, in reply to Walker's note,\r\nthought it most prudent to wait personally on that gentleman). \xe2\x80\x9cRemember\r\nthat I am the first master in England; that I have the best interest in\r\nEngland; that I can bring her out at the Palace, and at every concert\r\nand musical festival in England; that I am obliged to teach her every\r\nsingle note that she utters; and that without me she could no more sing\r\na song than her little baby could walk without its nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe about half what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Captain Walker! would you question my integrity? Who was it\r\nthat made Mrs. Millington's fortune,--the celebrated Mrs. Millington,\r\nwho has now got a hundred thousand pounds? Who was it that brought out\r\nthe finest tenor in Europe, Poppleton? Ask the musical world, ask\r\nthose great artists themselves, and they will tell you they owe their\r\nreputation, their fortune, to Sir George Thrum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very likely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE a good\r\nmaster, I dare say, Sir George; but I am not going to article Mrs.\r\nWalker to you for three years, and sign her articles in the Fleet. Mrs.\r\nWalker shan't sing till I'm a free man, that's flat: if I stay here till\r\nyou're dead she shan't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious powers, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sir George, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you expect me to pay\r\nyour debts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand to give me something handsome\r\nin hand, too; and that's my ultimatum: and so I wish you good morning,\r\nfor I'm engaged to play a match at tennis below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little interview exceedingly frightened the worthy knight, who\r\nwent home to his lady in a delirious state of alarm occasioned by the\r\naudacity of Captain Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. Slang's interview with him was scarcely more satisfactory. He\r\nowed, he said, four thousand pounds. His creditors might be brought to\r\ncompound for five shillings in the pound. He would not consent to allow\r\nhis wife to make a single engagement until the creditors were satisfied,\r\nand until he had a handsome sum in hand to begin the world with. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless\r\nmy wife comes out, you'll be in the Gazette yourself, you know you will.\r\nSo you may take her or leave her, as you think fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her sing one night as a trial,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Slang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she sings one night, the creditors will want their money in full,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan't let her labour, poor thing, for the\r\nprofit of those scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d added the prisoner, with much feeling. And\r\nSlang left him with a much greater respect for Walker than he had ever\r\nbefore possessed. He was struck with the gallantry of the man who could\r\ntriumph over misfortunes, nay, make misfortune itself an engine of good\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker was instructed instantly to have a severe sore throat. The\r\njournals in Mr. Slang's interest deplored this illness pathetically;\r\nwhile the papers in the interest of the opposition theatre magnified it\r\nwith great malice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new singer,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great wonder which\r\nSlang promised us, is as hoarse as a RAVEN!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Thorax pronounces,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n wrote another paper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the quinsy, which has suddenly prostrated\r\nMrs. Ravenswing, whose singing at the Philharmonic, previous to her\r\nappearance at the 'T.R----,' excited so much applause, has destroyed the\r\nlady's voice for ever. We luckily need no other prima donna, when that\r\nplace, as nightly thousands acknowledge, is held by Miss Ligonier.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nLooker-on said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat although some well-informed contemporaries had\r\ndeclared Mrs. W. Ravenswing's complaint to be a quinsy, others, on\r\nwhose authority they could equally rely, had pronounced it to be a\r\nconsumption. At all events, she was in an exceedingly dangerous state;\r\nfrom which, though we do not expect, we heartily trust she may recover.\r\nOpinions differ as to the merits of this lady, some saying that she was\r\naltogether inferior to Miss Ligonier, while other connoisseurs declare\r\nthe latter lady to be by no means so accomplished a person. This point,\r\nwe fear,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Looker-on, \xe2\x80\x9ccan never now be settled; unless,\r\nwhich we fear is improbable, Mrs. Ravenswing should ever so far recover\r\nas to be able to make her debut; and even then, the new singer will\r\nnot have a fair chance unless her voice and strength shall be fully\r\nrestored. This information, which we have from exclusive resources, may\r\nbe relied on,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the Looker-on, \xe2\x80\x9cas authentic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Walker himself, that artful and audacious Fleet prisoner, who\r\nconcocted those very paragraphs against his wife's health which appeared\r\nin the journals of the Ligonier party. The partisans of that lady were\r\ndelighted, the creditors of Mr. Walker astounded, at reading them.\r\nEven Sir George Thrum was taken in, and came to the Fleet prison in\r\nconsiderable alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMum's the word, my good sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time to make\r\narrangements with the creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, these arrangements were finally made. It does not matter how many\r\nshillings in the pound satisfied the rapacious creditors of Morgiana's\r\nhusband. But it is certain that her voice returned to her all of a\r\nsudden upon the Captain's release. The papers of the Mulligan faction\r\nagain trumpeted her perfections; the agreement with Mr. Slang was\r\nconcluded; that with Sir George Thrum the great composer satisfactorily\r\narranged; and the new opera underlined in immense capitals in the\r\nbills, and put in rehearsal with immense expenditure on the part of the\r\nscene-painter and costumier.\r\n\r\nNeed we tell with what triumphant success the \xe2\x80\x9cBrigand's Bride\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nreceived? All the Irish sub-editors the next morning took care to have\r\nsuch an account of it as made Miss Ligonier and Baroski die with envy.\r\nAll the reporters who could spare time were in the boxes to support\r\ntheir friend's work. All the journeymen tailors of the establishment of\r\nLinsey, Woolsey, and Co. had pit tickets given to them, and applauded\r\nwith all their might. All Mr. Walker's friends of the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent Club\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n lined the side-boxes with white kid gloves; and in a little box by\r\nthemselves sat Mrs. Crump and Mr. Woolsey, a great deal too much\r\nagitated to applaud--so agitated, that Woolsey even forgot to fling down\r\nthe bouquet he had brought for the Ravenswing.\r\n\r\nBut there was no lack of those horticultural ornaments. The theatre\r\nservants wheeled away a wheelbarrow-full (which were flung on the stage\r\nthe next night over again); and Morgiana, blushing, panting, weeping,\r\nwas led off by Mr. Poppleton, the eminent tenor, who had crowned her\r\nwith one of the most conspicuous of the chaplets.\r\n\r\nHere she flew to her husband, and flung her arms round his neck. He was\r\nflirting behind the side-scenes with Mademoiselle Flicflac, who had\r\nbeen dancing in the divertissement; and was probably the only man in\r\nthe theatre of those who witnessed the embrace that did not care for it.\r\nEven Slang was affected, and said with perfect sincerity that he wished\r\nhe had been in Walker's place. The manager's fortune was made, at least\r\nfor the season. He acknowledged so much to Walker, who took a week's\r\nsalary for his wife in advance that very night.\r\n\r\nThere was, as usual, a grand supper in the green-room. The terrible Mr.\r\nBludyer appeared in a new coat of the well-known Woolsey cut, and the\r\nlittle tailor himself and Mrs. Crump were not the least happy of the\r\nparty. But when the Ravenswing took Woolsey's hand, and said she never\r\nwould have been there but for him, Mr. Walker looked very grave,\r\nand hinted to her that she must not, in her position, encourage the\r\nattentions of persons in that rank of life. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall pay,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nproudly, \xe2\x80\x9cevery farthing that is owing to Mr. Woolsey, and shall employ\r\nhim for the future. But you understand, my love, that one cannot at\r\none's own table receive one's own tailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlang proposed Morgiana's health in a tremendous speech, which elicited\r\ncheers, and laughter, and sobs, such as only managers have the art of\r\ndrawing from the theatrical gentlemen and ladies in their employ. It\r\nwas observed, especially among the chorus-singers at the bottom of the\r\ntable, that their emotion was intense. They had a meeting the next day\r\nand voted a piece of plate to Adolphus Slang, Esquire, for his eminent\r\nservices in the cause of the drama.\r\n\r\nWalker returned thanks for his lady. That was, he said, the proudest\r\nmoment of his life. He was proud to think that he had educated her for\r\nthe stage, happy to think that his sufferings had not been in vain, and\r\nthat his exertions in her behalf were crowned with full success. In her\r\nname and his own he thanked the company, and sat down, and was once more\r\nparticularly attentive to Mademoiselle Flicflac.\r\n\r\nThen came an oration from Sir George Thrum, in reply to Slang's toast\r\nto HIM. It was very much to the same effect as the speech by Walker,\r\nthe two gentlemen attributing to themselves individually the merit of\r\nbringing out Mrs. Walker. He concluded by stating that he should always\r\nhold Mrs. Walker as the daughter of his heart, and to the last moment of\r\nhis life should love and cherish her. It is certain that Sir George was\r\nexceedingly elated that night, and would have been scolded by his lady\r\non his return home, but for the triumph of the evening.\r\n\r\nMulligan's speech of thanks, as author of the \xe2\x80\x9cBrigand's Bride,\xe2\x80\x9d was, it\r\nmust be confessed, extremely tedious. It seemed there would be no end\r\nto it; when he got upon the subject of Ireland especially, which somehow\r\nwas found to be intimately connected with the interests of music and the\r\ntheatre. Even the choristers pooh-poohed this speech, coming though it\r\ndid from the successful author, whose songs of wine, love, and battle,\r\nthey had been repeating that night.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cBrigand's Bride\xe2\x80\x9d ran for many nights. Its choruses were tuned on\r\nthe organs of the day. Morgiana's airs, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rose upon my Balcony\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the \xe2\x80\x9cLightning on the Cataract\xe2\x80\x9d (recitative and scena) were on\r\neverybody's lips, and brought so many guineas to Sir George Thrum that\r\nhe was encouraged to have his portrait engraved, which still may be\r\nseen in the music-shops. Not many persons, I believe, bought proof\r\nimpressions of the plate, price two guineas; whereas, on the contrary,\r\nall the young clerks in banks, and all the FAST young men of the\r\nuniversities, had pictures of the Ravenswing in their apartments--as\r\nBiondetta (the brigand's bride), as Zelyma (in the \xe2\x80\x9cNuptials of\r\nBenares\xe2\x80\x9d), as Barbareska (in the \xe2\x80\x9cMine of Tobolsk\xe2\x80\x9d), and in all her\r\nfamous characters. In the latter she disguises herself as a Uhlan, in\r\norder to save her father, who is in prison; and the Ravenswing looked so\r\nfascinating in this costume in pantaloons and yellow boots, that Slang\r\nwas for having her instantly in Captain Macheath, whence arose their\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\nShe was replaced at Slang's theatre by Snooks, the rhinoceros-tamer,\r\nwith his breed of wild buffaloes. Their success was immense. Slang gave\r\na supper, at which all the company burst into tears; and assembling\r\nin the green-room next day, they, as usual, voted a piece of plate to\r\nAdolphus Slang, Esquire, for his eminent services to the drama.\r\n\r\nIn the Captain Macheath dispute Mr. Walker would have had his wife\r\nyield; but on this point, and for once, she disobeyed her husband and\r\nleft the theatre. And when Walker cursed her (according to his wont) for\r\nher abominable selfishness and disregard of his property, she burst\r\ninto tears and said she had spent but twenty guineas on herself and baby\r\nduring the year, that her theatrical dressmaker's bills were yet unpaid,\r\nand that she had never asked him how much he spent on that odious French\r\nfigurante.\r\n\r\nAll this was true, except about the French figurante. Walker, as the\r\nlord and master, received all Morgiana's earnings, and spent them as\r\na gentleman should. He gave very neat dinners at a cottage in Regent's\r\nPark (Mr. and Mrs. Walker lived at Green Street, Grosvenor Square), he\r\nplayed a good deal at the \xe2\x80\x9cRegent;\xe2\x80\x9d but as to the French figurante, it\r\nmust be confessed, that Mrs. Walker was in a sad error: THAT lady and\r\nthe Captain had parted long ago; it was Madame Dolores de Tras-os-Montes\r\nwho inhabited the cottage in St. John's Wood now.\r\n\r\nBut if some little errors of this kind might be attributable to the\r\nCaptain, on the other hand, when his wife was in the provinces, he was\r\nthe most attentive of husbands; made all her bargains, and received\r\nevery shilling before he would permit her to sing a note. Thus he\r\nprevented her from being cheated, as a person of her easy temper\r\ndoubtless would have been, by designing managers and needy\r\nconcert-givers. They always travelled with four horses; and Walker was\r\nadored in every one of the principal hotels in England. The waiters flew\r\nat his bell. The chambermaids were afraid he was a sad naughty man, and\r\nthought his wife no such great beauty; the landlords preferred him to\r\nany duke. HE never looked at their bills, not he! In fact his income was\r\nat least four thousand a year for some years of his life.\r\n\r\nMaster Woolsey Walker was put to Doctor Wapshot's seminary, whence,\r\nafter many disputes on the Doctor's part as to getting his half-year's\r\naccounts paid, and after much complaint of ill-treatment on the little\r\nboy's side, he was withdrawn, and placed under the care of the Reverend\r\nMr. Swishtail, at Turnham Green; where all his bills are paid by his\r\ngodfather, now the head of the firm of Woolsey and Co.\r\n\r\nAs a gentleman, Mr. Walker still declines to see him; but he has not,\r\nas far as I have heard, paid the sums of money which he threatened to\r\nrefund; and, as he is seldom at home the worthy tailor can come to Green\r\nStreet at his leisure. He and Mrs. Crump, and Mrs. Walker often take the\r\nomnibus to Brentford, and a cake with them to little Woolsey at school;\r\nto whom the tailor says he will leave every shilling of his property.\r\n\r\nThe Walkers have no other children; but when she takes her airing in the\r\nPark she always turns away at the sight of a low phaeton, in which sits\r\na woman with rouged cheeks, and a great number of overdressed children\r\nand a French bonne, whose name, I am given to understand, is Madame\r\nDolores de Tras-os-Montes. Madame de Tras-os-Montes always puts a great\r\ngold glass to her eye as the Ravenswing's carriage passes, and looks\r\ninto it with a sneer. The two coachmen used always to exchange queer\r\nwinks at each other in the ring, until Madame de Tras-os-Montes lately\r\nadopted a tremendous chasseur, with huge whiskers and a green and gold\r\nlivery; since which time the formerly named gentlemen do not recognise\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe Ravenswing's life is one of perpetual triumph on the stage; and, as\r\nevery one of the fashionable men about town have been in love with her,\r\nyou may fancy what a pretty character she has. Lady Thrum would die\r\nsooner than speak to that unhappy young woman; and, in fact, the Thrums\r\nhave a new pupil, who is a siren without the dangerous qualities of one,\r\nwho has the person of Venus, and the mind of a Muse, and who is coming\r\nout at one of the theatres immediately. Baroski says, \xe2\x80\x9cDe liddle\r\nRafenschwing is just as font of me as effer!\xe2\x80\x9d People are very shy about\r\nreceiving her in society; and when she goes to sing at a concert, Miss\r\nPrim starts up and skurries off in a state of the greatest alarm, lest\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat person\xe2\x80\x9d should speak to her.\r\n\r\nWalker is voted a good, easy, rattling, gentlemanly fellow, and nobody's\r\nenemy but his own. His wife, they say, is dreadfully extravagant: and,\r\nindeed, since his marriage, and in spite of his wife's large income,\r\nhe has been in the Bench several times; but she signs some bills and\r\nhe comes out again, and is as gay and genial as ever. All mercantile\r\nspeculations he has wisely long since given up; he likes to throw a\r\nmain of an evening, as I have said, and to take his couple of bottles at\r\ndinner. On Friday he attends at the theatre for his wife's salary, and\r\ntransacts no other business during the week. He grows exceedingly stout,\r\ndyes his hair, and has a bloated purple look about the nose and cheeks,\r\nvery different from that which first charmed the heart of Morgiana.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Eglantine has been turned out of the Bower of Bloom, and now\r\nkeeps a shop at Tunbridge Wells. Going down thither last year without a\r\nrazor, I asked a fat seedy man lolling in a faded nankeen jacket at the\r\ndoor of a tawdry little shop in the Pantiles, to shave me. He said in\r\nreply, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I do not practise in that branch of the profession!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nturned back into the little shop. It was Archibald Eglantine. But in the\r\nwreck of his fortunes he still has his captain's uniform, and his grand\r\ncross of the order of the Castle and Falcon of Panama.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nG. Fitz-Boodle, Esq., to O. Yorke, Esq.\r\n\r\nZUM TRIERISCHEN HOP, COBLENZ: July 10, 1843.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR YORKE,--The story of the Ravenswing was written a long time\r\nsince, and I never could account for the bad taste of the publishers of\r\nthe metropolis who refused it an insertion in their various magazines.\r\nThis fact would never have been alluded to but for the following\r\ncircumstance:--\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday, as I was dining at this excellent hotel, I remarked a\r\nbald-headed gentleman in a blue coat and brass buttons, who looked\r\nlike a colonel on half-pay, and by his side a lady and a little boy\r\nof twelve, whom the gentleman was cramming with an amazing quantity of\r\ncherries and cakes. A stout old dame in a wonderful cap and ribands was\r\nseated by the lady's side, and it was easy to see they were English, and\r\nI thought I had already made their acquaintance elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe younger of the ladies at last made a bow with an accompanying blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the honour of speaking to Mrs. Ravenswing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Woolsey, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cmy wife has long since left\r\nthe stage:\xe2\x80\x9d and at this the old lady in the wonderful cap trod on my\r\ntoes very severely, and nodded her head and all her ribands in a most\r\nmysterious way. Presently the two ladies rose and left the table, the\r\nelder declaring that she heard the baby crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoolsey, my dear, go with your mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woolsey, patting the\r\nboy on the head. The young gentleman obeyed the command, carrying off a\r\nplate of macaroons with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour son is a fine boy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy step-son, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Woolsey; and added, in a louder voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you, Mr. Fitz-Boodle, at once, but did not mention your name\r\nfor fear of agitating my wife. She don't like to have the memory of old\r\ntimes renewed, sir; her former husband, whom you know, Captain Walker,\r\nmade her very unhappy. He died in America, sir, of this, I fear\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (pointing to the bottle), \xe2\x80\x9cand Mrs. W. quitted the stage a year before I\r\nquitted business. Are you going on to Wiesbaden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went off in their carriage that evening, the boy on the box making\r\ngreat efforts to blow out of the postilion's tasselled horn.\r\n\r\nI am glad that poor Morgiana is happy at last, and hasten to inform\r\nyou of the fact. I am going to visit the old haunts of my youth at\r\nPumpernickel. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nG. F.-B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. AND MRS. FRANK BERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE FIGHT AT SLAUGHTER HOUSE.\r\n\r\nI am very fond of reading about battles, and have most of Marlborough's\r\nand Wellington's at my fingers' ends; but the most tremendous combat I\r\never saw, and one that interests me to think of more than Malplaquet or\r\nWaterloo (which, by the way, has grown to be a downright nuisance, so\r\nmuch do men talk of it after dinner, prating most disgustingly about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Prussians coming up,\xe2\x80\x9d and what not)--I say the most tremendous\r\ncombat ever known was that between Berry and Biggs the gown-boy, which\r\ncommenced in a certain place called Middle Briars, situated in the midst\r\nof the cloisters that run along the side of the playground of Slaughter\r\nHouse School, near Smithfield, London. It was there, madam, that your\r\nhumble servant had the honour of acquiring, after six years' labour,\r\nthat immense fund of classical knowledge which in after life has been so\r\nexceedingly useful to him.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the quarrel were these:--Biggs, the gown-boy (a\r\nman who, in those days, I thought was at least seven feet high, and was\r\nquite thunderstruck to find in after life that he measured no more than\r\nfive feet four), was what we called \xe2\x80\x9csecond cock\xe2\x80\x9d of the school; the\r\nfirst cock was a great big, good-humoured, lazy, fair-haired fellow,\r\nOld Hawkins by name, who, because he was large and good-humoured, hurt\r\nnobody. Biggs, on the contrary, was a sad bully; he had half-a-dozen\r\nfags, and beat them all unmercifully. Moreover, he had a little brother,\r\na boarder in Potky's house, whom, as a matter of course, he hated and\r\nmaltreated worse than anyone else.\r\n\r\nWell, one day, because young Biggs had not brought his brother his\r\nhoops, or had not caught a ball at cricket, or for some other equally\r\ngood reason, Biggs the elder so belaboured the poor little fellow, that\r\nBerry, who was sauntering by, and saw the dreadful blows which the\r\nelder brother was dealing to the younger with his hockey-stick, felt\r\na compassion for the little fellow (perhaps he had a jealousy against\r\nBiggs, and wanted to try a few rounds with him, but that I can't vouch\r\nfor); however, Berry passing by, stopped and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't you think\r\nyou have thrashed the boy enough, Biggs?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke this in a very civil\r\ntone, for he never would have thought of interfering rudely with the\r\nsacred privilege that an upper boy at a public school always has of\r\nbeating a junior, especially when they happen to be brothers.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Biggs, as might be expected, was to hit young Biggs with\r\nthe hockey-stick twice as hard as before, until the little wretch howled\r\nwith pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it's no business of yours, Berry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biggs,\r\nthumping away all the while, and laid on worse and worse.\r\n\r\nUntil Berry (and, indeed, little Biggs) could bear it no longer, and the\r\nformer, bouncing forward, wrenched the stick out of old Biggs's hands,\r\nand sent it whirling out of the cloister window, to the great wonder of\r\na crowd of us small boys, who were looking on. Little boys always like\r\nto see a little companion of their own soundly beaten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Berry, looking into Biggs's face, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI've\r\ngone and done it;\xe2\x80\x9d and he added to the brother, \xe2\x80\x9cScud away, you little\r\nthief; I've saved you this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, young Biggs!\xe2\x80\x9d roared out his brother after a pause; \xe2\x80\x9cor I'll\r\nbreak every bone in your infernal scoundrelly skin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Biggs looked at Berry, then at his brother, then came at his\r\nbrother's order, as if back to be beaten again; but lost heart, and ran\r\naway as fast as his little legs could carry him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll do for him another time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biggs. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, under-boy, take my\r\ncoat;\xe2\x80\x9d and we all began to gather round and formed a ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better wait till after school, Biggs,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Berry, quite cool,\r\nbut looking a little pale. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only five minutes now, and it will\r\ntake you more than that to thrash me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiggs upon this committed a great error; for he struck Berry slightly\r\nacross the face with the back of his hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in a funk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But this was a feeling which Frank Berry did not in the least entertain;\r\nfor, in reply to Biggs's back-hander, and as quick as thought, and with\r\nall his might and main--pong! he delivered a blow upon old Biggs's nose\r\nthat made the claret spirt, and sent the second cock down to the ground\r\nas if he had been shot.\r\n\r\nHe was up again, however, in a minute, his face white and gashed with\r\nblood, his eyes glaring, a ghastly spectacle; and Berry, meanwhile,\r\nhad taken his coat off, and by this time there were gathered in the\r\ncloisters, on all the windows, and upon each other's shoulders, one\r\nhundred and twenty young gentlemen at the very least, for the news had\r\ngone out through the playground of \xe2\x80\x9ca fight between Berry and Biggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Berry was quite right in his remark about the propriety of deferring\r\nthe business, for at this minute Mr. Chip, the second master, came down\r\nthe cloisters going into school, and grinned in his queer way as he saw\r\nthe state of Biggs's face. \xe2\x80\x9cHolloa, Mr. Biggs,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\r\nhave run against a finger-post.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the regular joke with us at\r\nschool, and you may be sure we all laughed heartily: as we always did\r\nwhen Mr. Chip made a joke, or anything like a joke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go\r\nto the pump, sir, and get yourself washed, and not let Doctor Buckle see\r\nyou in that condition.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, Mr. Chip disappeared to his duties in\r\nthe under-school, whither all we little boys followed him.\r\n\r\nIt was Wednesday, a half-holiday, as everybody knows, and boiled-beef\r\nday at Slaughter House. I was in the same boarding-house with Berry,\r\nand we all looked to see whether he ate a good dinner, just as one would\r\nexamine a man who was going to be hanged. I recollected, in after-life,\r\nin Germany, seeing a friend who was going to fight a duel eat five larks\r\nfor his breakfast, and thought I had seldom witnessed greater courage.\r\nBerry ate moderately of the boiled beef--BOILED CHILD we used to call it\r\nat school, in our elegant jocular way; he knew a great deal better than\r\nto load his stomach upon the eve of such a contest as was going to take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nDinner was very soon over, and Mr. Chip, who had been all the while\r\njoking Berry, and pressing him to eat, called him up into his study,\r\nto the great disappointment of us all, for we thought he was going to\r\nprevent the fight; but no such thing. The Reverend Edward Chip took\r\nBerry into his study, and poured him out two glasses of port-wine, which\r\nhe made him take with a biscuit, and patted him on the back, and went\r\noff. I have no doubt he was longing, like all of us, to see the battle;\r\nbut etiquette, you know, forbade.\r\n\r\nWhen we went out into the green, Old Hawkins was there--the great\r\nHawkins, the cock of the school. I have never seen the man since, but\r\nstill think of him as of something awful, gigantic, mysterious: he who\r\ncould thrash everybody, who could beat all the masters; how we longed\r\nfor him to put in his hand and lick Buckle! He was a dull boy, not very\r\nhigh in the school, and had all his exercises written for him. Buckle\r\nknew this, but respected him; never called him up to read Greek plays;\r\npassed over all his blunders, which were many; let him go out of\r\nhalf-holidays into the town as he pleased: how should any man dare to\r\nstop him--the great calm magnanimous silent Strength! They say he licked\r\na Life-Guardsman: I wonder whether it was Shaw, who killed all those\r\nFrenchmen? No, it could not be Shaw, for he was dead au champ d'honneur;\r\nbut he WOULD have licked Shaw if he had been alive. A bargeman I know he\r\nlicked, at Jack Randall's in Slaughter House Lane. Old Hawkins was too\r\nlazy to play at cricket; he sauntered all day in the sunshine about the\r\ngreen, accompanied by little Tippins, who was in the sixth form, laughed\r\nand joked at Hawkins eternally, and was the person who wrote all his\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nInstead of going into town this afternoon, Hawkins remained at Slaughter\r\nHouse, to see the great fight between the second and third cocks.\r\n\r\nThe different masters of the school kept boarding-houses (such as\r\nPotky's, Chip's, Wickens's, Pinney's, and so on), and the playground, or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d as it was called, although the only thing green about the place\r\nwas the broken glass on the walls that separate Slaughter House from\r\nWilderness Row and Goswell Street--(many a time have I seen Mr. Pickwick\r\nlook out of his window in that street, though we did not know him\r\nthen)--the playground, or green, was common to all. But if any stray\r\nboy from Potky's was found, for instance, in, or entering into, Chip's\r\nhouse, the most dreadful tortures were practised upon him: as I can\r\nanswer in my own case.\r\n\r\nFancy, then, our astonishment at seeing a little three-foot wretch, of\r\nthe name of Wills, one of Hawkins's fags (they were both in Potky's),\r\nwalk undismayed amongst us lions at Chip's house, as the \xe2\x80\x9crich and rare\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n young lady did in Ireland. We were going to set upon him and devour or\r\notherwise maltreat him, when he cried out in a little shrill impertinent\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cTELL BERRY I WANT HIM!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all roared with laughter. Berry was in the sixth form, and Wills or\r\nany under-boy would as soon have thought of \xe2\x80\x9cwanting\xe2\x80\x9d him, as I should\r\nof wanting the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nLittle Wills looked round in an imperious kind of way. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\nstamping his foot, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you hear? TELL BERRY THAT HAWKINS WANTS HIM!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for resisting the law of Hawkins, you might as soon think of\r\nresisting immortal Jove. Berry and Tolmash, who was to be his\r\nbottle-holder, made their appearance immediately, and walked out into\r\nthe green where Hawkins was waiting, and, with an irresistible audacity\r\nthat only belonged to himself, in the face of nature and all the\r\nregulations of the place, was smoking a cigar. When Berry and Tolmash\r\nfound him, the three began slowly pacing up and down in the sunshine,\r\nand we little boys watched them.\r\n\r\nHawkins moved his arms and hands every now and then, and was evidently\r\nlaying down the law about boxing. We saw his fists darting out every now\r\nand then with mysterious swiftness, hitting one, two, quick as thought,\r\nas if in the face of an adversary; now his left hand went up, as if\r\nguarding his own head, now his immense right fist dreadfully flapped\r\nthe air, as if punishing his imaginary opponent's miserable ribs. The\r\nconversation lasted for some ten minutes, about which time gown-boys'\r\ndinner was over, and we saw these youths, in their black horned-button\r\njackets and knee-breeches, issuing from their door in the cloisters.\r\nThere were no hoops, no cricket-bats, as usual on a half-holiday. Who\r\nwould have thought of play in expectation of such tremendous sport as\r\nwas in store for us?\r\n\r\nTowering among the gown-boys, of whom he was the head and the tyrant,\r\nleaning upon Bushby's arm, and followed at a little distance by many\r\ncurious pale awe-stricken boys, dressed in his black silk stockings,\r\nwhich he always sported, and with a crimson bandanna tied round his\r\nwaist, came BIGGS. His nose was swollen with the blow given before\r\nschool, but his eyes flashed fire. He was laughing and sneering with\r\nBushby, and evidently intended to make minced meat of Berry.\r\n\r\nThe betting began pretty freely: the bets were against poor Berry. Five\r\nto three were offered--in ginger-beer. I took six to four in raspberry\r\nopen tarts. The upper boys carried the thing farther still: and I know\r\nfor a fact, that Swang's book amounted to four pound three (but he\r\nhedged a good deal), and Tittery lost seventeen shillings in a single\r\nbet to Pitts, who took the odds.\r\n\r\nAs Biggs and his party arrived, I heard Hawkins say to Berry, \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nheaven's sake, my boy, fib with your right, and MIND HIS LEFT HAND!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiddle Briars was voted to be too confined a space for the combat, and\r\nit was agreed that it should take place behind the under-school in\r\nthe shade, whither we all went. Hawkins, with his immense silver\r\nhunting-watch, kept the time; and water was brought from the pump close\r\nto Notley's the pastrycook's, who did not admire fisticuffs at all on\r\nhalf-holidays, for the fights kept the boys away from his shop. Gutley\r\nwas the only fellow in the school who remained faithful to him, and\r\nhe sat on the counter--the great gormandising brute!--eating tarts the\r\nwhole day.\r\n\r\nThis famous fight, as every Slaughter House man knows, lasted for two\r\nhours and twenty-nine minutes, by Hawkins's immense watch. All this time\r\nthe air resounded with cries of \xe2\x80\x9cGo it, Berry!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGo it, Biggs!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPitch\r\ninto him!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGive it him!\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. Shall I describe the hundred and\r\ntwo rounds of the combat?--No!--It would occupy too much space, and the\r\ntaste for such descriptions has passed away. [3]\r\n\r\n1st round. Both the combatants fresh, and in prime order. The weight\r\nand inches somewhat on the gown-boy's side. Berry goes gallantly in,\r\nand delivers a clinker on the gown-boy's jaw. Biggs makes play with his\r\nleft. Berry down.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n4th round. Claret drawn in profusion from the gown-boy's grogshop. (He\r\nwent down, and had his front tooth knocked out, but the blow cut Berry's\r\nknuckles a great deal.)\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n15th round. Chancery. Fibbing. Biggs makes dreadful work with his\r\nleft. Break away. Rally. Biggs down. Betting still six to four on the\r\ngown-boy.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n20th round. The men both dreadfully punished. Berry somewhat shy of his\r\nadversary's left hand.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n29th to 42nd round. The Chipsite all this while breaks away from the\r\ngown-boy's left, and goes down on a knee. Six to four on the gown-boy,\r\nuntil the fortieth round, when the bets became equal.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n102nd and last round. For half-an-hour the men had stood up to each\r\nother, but were almost too weary to strike. The gown-boy's face hardly\r\nto be recognised, swollen and streaming with blood. The Chipsite in\r\na similar condition, and still more punished about his side from his\r\nenemy's left hand. Berry gives a blow at his adversary's face, and falls\r\nover him as he falls.\r\n\r\nThe gown-boy can't come up to time. And thus ended the great fight of\r\nBerry and Biggs.\r\n\r\nAnd what, pray, has this horrid description of a battle and parcel of\r\nschoolboys to do with Men's Wives?\r\n\r\nWhat has it to do with Men's Wives?--A great deal more, madam, than you\r\nthink for. Only read Chapter II., and you shall hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE COMBAT AT VERSAILLES.\r\n\r\nI afterwards came to be Berry's fag, and, though beaten by him daily, he\r\nallowed, of course, no one else to lay a hand upon me, and I got no more\r\nthrashing than was good for me. Thus an intimacy grew up between us,\r\nand after he left Slaughter House and went into the dragoons, the honest\r\nfellow did not forget his old friend, but actually made his appearance\r\none day in the playground in moustaches and a braided coat, and gave\r\nme a gold pencil-case and a couple of sovereigns. I blushed when I took\r\nthem, but take them I did; and I think the thing I almost best recollect\r\nin my life, is the sight of Berry getting behind an immense bay\r\ncab-horse, which was held by a correct little groom, and was waiting\r\nnear the school in Slaughter House Square. He proposed, too, to have me\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cLong's,\xe2\x80\x9d where he was lodging for the time; but this invitation\r\nwas refused on my behalf by Doctor Buckle, who said, and possibly with\r\ncorrectness, that I should get little good by spending my holiday with\r\nsuch a scapegrace.\r\n\r\nOnce afterwards he came to see me at Christ Church, and we made a show\r\nof writing to one another, and didn't, and always had a hearty mutual\r\ngoodwill; and though we did not quite burst into tears on parting, were\r\nyet quite happy when occasion threw us together, and so almost lost\r\nsight of each other. I heard lately that Berry was married, and am\r\nrather ashamed to say, that I was not so curious as even to ask the\r\nmaiden name of his lady.\r\n\r\nLast summer I was at Paris, and had gone over to Versailles to meet a\r\nparty, one of which was a young lady to whom I was tenderly--But, never\r\nmind. The day was rainy, and the party did not keep its appointment;\r\nand after yawning through the interminable Palace picture-galleries, and\r\nthen making an attempt to smoke a cigar in the Palace garden--for which\r\ncrime I was nearly run through the body by a rascally sentinel--I was\r\ndriven, perforce, into the great bleak lonely place before the Palace,\r\nwith its roads branching off to all the towns in the world, which Louis\r\nand Napoleon once intended to conquer, and there enjoyed my favourite\r\npursuit at leisure, and was meditating whether I should go back to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVefour's\xe2\x80\x9d for dinner, or patronise my friend M. Duboux of the \xe2\x80\x9cHotel\r\ndes Reservoirs\xe2\x80\x9d who gives not only a good dinner, but as dear a one as\r\nheart can desire. I was, I say, meditating these things, when a carriage\r\npassed by. It was a smart low calash, with a pair of bay horses and a\r\npostilion in a drab jacket that twinkled with innumerable buttons, and\r\nI was too much occupied in admiring the build of the machine, and\r\nthe extreme tightness of the fellow's inexpressibles, to look at the\r\npersonages within the carriage, when the gentleman roared out \xe2\x80\x9cFitz!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the postilion pulled up, and the lady gave a shrill scream, and\r\na little black-muzzled spaniel began barking and yelling with all his\r\nmight, and a man with moustaches jumped out of the vehicle, and began\r\nshaking me by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive home, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll be with you, my love, in\r\nan instant--it's an old friend. Fitz, let me present you to Mrs. Berry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady made an exceedingly gentle inclination of her black-velvet\r\nbonnet, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPray, my love, remember that it is just dinner-time.\r\nHowever, never mind ME.\xe2\x80\x9d And with another slight toss and a nod to the\r\npostilion, that individual's white leather breeches began to jump up\r\nand down again in the saddle, and the carriage disappeared, leaving me\r\nshaking my old friend Berry by the hand.\r\n\r\nHe had long quitted the army, but still wore his military beard,\r\nwhich gave to his fair pink face a fierce and lion-like look. He was\r\nextraordinarily glad to see me, as only men are glad who live in a small\r\ntown, or in dull company. There is no destroyer of friendships like\r\nLondon, where a man has no time to think of his neighbour, and has\r\nfar too many friends to care for them. He told me in a breath of his\r\nmarriage, and how happy he was, and straight insisted that I must\r\ncome home to dinner, and see more of Angelica, who had invited me\r\nherself--didn't I hear her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Berry asked YOU, Frank; but I certainly did not hear her ask ME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would not have mentioned the dinner but that she meant me to ask\r\nyou. I know she did,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frank Berry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides--hang it--I'm\r\nmaster of the house. So come you shall. No ceremony, old boy--one or two\r\nfriends--snug family party--and we'll talk of old times over a bottle of\r\nclaret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere did not seem to me to be the slightest objection to this\r\narrangement, except that my boots were muddy, and my coat of the morning\r\nsort. But as it was quite impossible to go to Paris and back again in\r\na quarter of an hour, and as a man may dine with perfect comfort to\r\nhimself in a frock-coat, it did not occur to me to be particularly\r\nsqueamish, or to decline an old friend's invitation upon a pretext so\r\ntrivial.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we walked to a small house in the Avenue de Paris, and were\r\nadmitted first into a small garden ornamented by a grotto, a fountain,\r\nand several nymphs in plaster-of-Paris, then up a mouldy old steep stair\r\ninto a hall, where a statue of Cupid and another of Venus welcomed us\r\nwith their eternal simper; then through a salle-a-manger where covers\r\nwere laid for six; and finally to a little saloon, where Fido the dog\r\nbegan to howl furiously according to his wont.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the old pavilions that had been built for a pleasure-house\r\nin the gay days of Versailles, ornamented with abundance of damp Cupids\r\nand cracked gilt cornices, and old mirrors let into the walls, and\r\ngilded once, but now painted a dingy French white. The long low windows\r\nlooked into the court, where the fountain played its ceaseless dribble,\r\nsurrounded by numerous rank creepers and weedy flowers, but in the midst\r\nof which the statues stood with their bases quite moist and green.\r\n\r\nI hate fountains and statues in dark confined places: that cheerless,\r\nendless plashing of water is the most inhospitable sound ever heard. The\r\nstiff grin of those French statues, or ogling Canova Graces, is by no\r\nmeans more happy, I think, than the smile of a skeleton, and not so\r\nnatural. Those little pavilions in which the old roues sported were\r\nnever meant to be seen by daylight, depend on't. They were lighted up\r\nwith a hundred wax-candles, and the little fountain yonder was meant\r\nonly to cool their claret. And so, my first impression of Berry's\r\nplace of abode was rather a dismal one. However, I heard him in the\r\nsalle-a-manger drawing the corks, which went off with a CLOOP, and that\r\nconsoled me.\r\n\r\nAs for the furniture of the rooms appertaining to the Berrys, there\r\nwas a harp in a leather case, and a piano, and a flute-box, and a huge\r\ntambour with a Saracen's nose just begun, and likewise on the table\r\na multiplicity of those little gilt books, half sentimental and half\r\nreligious, which the wants of the age and of our young ladies have\r\nproduced in such numbers of late. I quarrel with no lady's taste in that\r\nway; but heigho! I had rather that Mrs. Fitz-Boodle should read \xe2\x80\x9cHumphry\r\nClinker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBesides these works, there was a \xe2\x80\x9cPeerage,\xe2\x80\x9d of course. What genteel\r\nfamily was ever without one?\r\n\r\nI was making for the door to see Frank drawing the corks, and was\r\nbounced at by the amiable little black-muzzled spaniel, who fastened his\r\nteeth in my pantaloons, and received a polite kick in consequence, which\r\nsent him howling to the other end of the room, and the animal was just\r\nin the act of performing that feat of agility, when the door opened\r\nand madame made her appearance. Frank came behind her, peering over her\r\nshoulder with rather an anxious look.\r\n\r\nMrs. Berry is an exceedingly white and lean person. She has thick\r\neyebrows, which meet rather dangerously over her nose, which is Grecian,\r\nand a small mouth with no lips--a sort of feeble pucker in the face as\r\nit were. Under her eyebrows are a pair of enormous eyes, which she is\r\nin the habit of turning constantly ceiling-wards. Her hair is rather\r\nscarce, and worn in bandeaux, and she commonly mounts a sprig of laurel,\r\nor a dark flower or two, which with the sham tour--I believe that is the\r\nname of the knob of artificial hair that many ladies sport--gives her\r\na rigid and classical look. She is dressed in black, and has invariably\r\nthe neatest of silk stockings and shoes: for forsooth her foot is a fine\r\none, and she always sits with it before her, looking at it, stamping it,\r\nand admiring it a great deal. \xe2\x80\x9cFido,\xe2\x80\x9d she says to her spaniel, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nalmost crushed my poor foot;\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cFrank,\xe2\x80\x9d to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me a\r\nfootstool:\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI suffer so from cold in the feet,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth; but\r\nbe the conversation what it will, she is always sure to put HER FOOT\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nShe invariably wears on her neck the miniature of her late father, Sir\r\nGeorge Catacomb, apothecary to George III.; and she thinks those two men\r\nthe greatest the world ever saw. She was born in Baker Street, Portman\r\nSquare, and that is saying almost enough of her. She is as long, as\r\ngenteel, and as dreary, as that deadly-lively place, and sports, by\r\nway of ornament, her papa's hatchment, as it were, as every tenth Baker\r\nStreet house has taught her.\r\n\r\nWhat induced such a jolly fellow as Frank Berry to marry Miss Angelica\r\nCatacomb no one can tell. He met her, he says, at a ball at Hampton\r\nCourt, where his regiment was quartered, and where, to this day, lives\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cher aunt Lady Pash.\xe2\x80\x9d She alludes perpetually in conversation to that\r\ncelebrated lady; and if you look in the \xe2\x80\x9cBaronetage\xe2\x80\x9d to the pedigree\r\nof the Pash family, you may see manuscript notes by Mrs. Frank Berry,\r\nrelative to them and herself. Thus, when you see in print that Sir John\r\nPash married Angelica, daughter of Graves Catacomb, Esquire, in a neat\r\nhand you find written, AND SISTER OF THE LATE SIR GEORGE CATACOMB, OF\r\nBAKER STREET, PORTMAN SQUARE: \xe2\x80\x9cA.B.\xe2\x80\x9d follows of course. It is a wonder\r\nhow fond ladies are of writing in books, and signing their charming\r\ninitials! Mrs. Berry's before-mentioned little gilt books are scored\r\nwith pencil-marks, or occasionally at the margin with a!--note of\r\ninterjection, or the words \xe2\x80\x9cTOO TRUE, A.B.\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. Much may be\r\nlearned with regard to lovely woman by a look at the books she reads in;\r\nand I had gained no inconsiderable knowledge of Mrs. Berry by the ten\r\nminutes spent in the drawing-room, while she was at her toilet in the\r\nadjoining bedchamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have often heard me talk of George Fitz,\xe2\x80\x9d says Berry, with an\r\nappealing look to madame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery often,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his lady, in a tone which clearly meant \xe2\x80\x9ca great\r\ndeal too much.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, looking at my boots with all\r\nher might, \xe2\x80\x9care we to have your company at dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are, my dear; what else do you think he came for? You\r\nwould not have the man go back to Paris to get his evening coat, would\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least, my love, I hope you will go and put on YOURS, and change\r\nthose muddy boots. Lady Pash will be here in five minutes, and you know\r\nDobus is as punctual as clockwork.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to me with a sort of\r\napology that was as consoling as a box on the ear, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have some friends\r\nat dinner, sir, who are rather particular persons; but I am sure when\r\nthey hear that you only came on a sudden invitation, they will excuse\r\nyour morning dress.--Bah! what a smell of smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this speech madame placed herself majestically on a sofa, put out\r\nher foot, called Fido, and relapsed into an icy silence. Frank had long\r\nsince evacuated the premises, with a rueful look at his wife, but never\r\ndaring to cast a glance at me. I saw the whole business at once: here\r\nwas this lion of a fellow tamed down by a she Van Amburgh, and fetching\r\nand carrying at her orders a great deal more obediently than her little\r\nyowling black-muzzled darling of a Fido.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, to be tamed so easily, and was determined in this\r\ninstance not to be in the least disconcerted, or to show the smallest\r\nsign of ill-humour: so to renouer the conversation, I began about Lady\r\nPash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you mention the name of Pash, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI know a lady\r\nof that name, and a very ugly one it is too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most probably not the same person,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Berry, with\r\na look which intimated that a fellow like me could never have had the\r\nhonour to know so exalted a person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean old Lady Pash of Hampton Court. Fat woman--fair, ain't she?--and\r\nwears an amethyst in her forehead, has one eye, a blond wig, and dresses\r\nin light green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Pash, sir, is MY AUNT,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Berry (not altogether\r\ndispleased, although she expected money from the old lady; but you know\r\nwe love to hear our friends abused when it can be safely done).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed! she was a daughter of old Catacomb's of Windsor, I\r\nremember, the undertaker. They called her husband Callipash, and her\r\nladyship Pishpash. So you see, madam, that I know the whole family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fitz-Simons!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Berry, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not accustomed to\r\nhear nicknames applied to myself and my family; and must beg you,\r\nwhen you honour us with your company, to spare our feelings as much as\r\npossible. Mr. Catacomb had the confidence of his SOVEREIGN, sir, and Sir\r\nJohn Pash was of Charles II.'s creation. The one was my uncle, sir; the\r\nother my grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear madam, I am extremely sorry, and most sincerely apologise\r\nfor my inadvertence. But you owe me an apology too: my name is not\r\nFitz-Simons, but Fitz-Boodle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! of Boodle Hall--my husband's old friend; of Charles I.'s\r\ncreation? My dear sir, I beg you a thousand pardons, and am delighted\r\nto welcome a person of whom I have heard Frank say so much. Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d (to\r\nBerry, who soon entered in very glossy boots and a white waistcoat), \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou know, darling, I mistook Mr. Fitz-Boodle for Mr. Fitz-Simons--that\r\nhorrid Irish horse-dealing person; and I never, never, never can pardon\r\nmyself for being so rude to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe big eyes here assumed an expression that was intended to kill me\r\noutright with kindness: from being calm, still, reserved, Angelica\r\nsuddenly became gay, smiling, confidential, and folatre. She told me she\r\nhad heard I was a sad creature, and that she intended to reform me, and\r\nthat I must come and see Frank a great deal.\r\n\r\nNow, although Mr. Fitz-Simons, for whom I was mistaken, is as low\r\na fellow as ever came out of Dublin, and having been a captain in\r\nsomebody's army, is now a blackleg and horse-dealer by profession; yet,\r\nif I had brought him home to Mrs. Fitz-Boodle to dinner, I should have\r\nliked far better that that imaginary lady should have received him with\r\ndecent civility, and not insulted the stranger within her husband's\r\ngates. And, although it was delightful to be received so cordially\r\nwhen the mistake was discovered, yet I found that ALL Berry's old\r\nacquaintances were by no means so warmly welcomed; for another old\r\nschool-chum presently made his appearance, who was treated in a very\r\ndifferent manner.\r\n\r\nThis was no other than poor Jack Butts, who is a sort of small artist\r\nand picture-dealer by profession, and was a dayboy at Slaughter House\r\nwhen we were there, and very serviceable in bringing in sausages,\r\npots of pickles, and other articles of merchandise, which we could not\r\notherwise procure. The poor fellow has been employed, seemingly, in the\r\nsame office of fetcher and carrier ever since; and occupied that post\r\nfor Mrs. Berry. It was, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Butts, have you finished that drawing for\r\nLady Pash's album?\xe2\x80\x9d and Butts produced it; and, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you match the silk\r\nfor me at Delille's?\xe2\x80\x9d and there was the silk, bought, no doubt, with the\r\npoor fellow's last five francs; and, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you go to the furniture-man in\r\nthe Rue St. Jacques; and bring the canary-seed, and call about my\r\nshawl at that odious dawdling Madame Fichet's; and have you brought the\r\nguitar-strings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButts hadn't brought the guitar-strings; and thereupon Mrs. Berry's\r\ncountenance assumed the same terrible expression which I had formerly\r\nremarked in it, and which made me tremble for Berry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Angelica,\xe2\x80\x9d though said he with some spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cJack Butts isn't\r\na baggage-waggon, nor a Jack-of-all-trades; you make him paint pictures\r\nfor your women's albums, and look after your upholsterer, and your\r\ncanary-bird, and your milliners, and turn rusty because he forgets your\r\nlast message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not turn RUSTY, Frank, as you call it elegantly. I'm very much\r\nobliged to Mr. Butts for performing my commissions--very much obliged.\r\nAnd as for not paying for the pictures to which you so kindly allude,\r\nFrank, _I_ should never have thought of offering payment for so paltry a\r\nservice; but I'm sure I shall be happy to pay if Mr. Butts will send me\r\nin his bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Angelica, this is too much!\xe2\x80\x9d bounced out Berry; but the little\r\nmatrimonial squabble was abruptly ended, by Berry's French man flinging\r\nopen the door and announcing MILADI PASH and Doctor Dobus, which two\r\npersonages made their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe person of old Pash has been already parenthetically described. But\r\nquite different from her dismal niece in temperament, she is as jolly an\r\nold widow as ever wore weeds. She was attached somehow to the Court, and\r\nhas a multiplicity of stories about the princesses and the old King,\r\nto which Mrs. Berry never fails to call your attention in her grave,\r\nimportant way. Lady Pash has ridden many a time to the Windsor hounds;\r\nshe made her husband become a member of the Four-in-hand Club, and has\r\nnumberless stories about Sir Godfrey Webster, Sir John Lade, and the\r\nold heroes of those times. She has lent a rouleau to Dick Sheridan,\r\nand remembers Lord Byron when he was a sulky slim young lad. She says\r\nCharles Fox was the pleasantest fellow she ever met with, and has not\r\nthe slightest objection to inform you that one of the princes was very\r\nmuch in love with her. Yet somehow she is only fifty-two years old, and\r\nI have never been able to understand her calculation. One day or other\r\nbefore her eye went out, and before those pearly teeth of hers were\r\nstuck to her gums by gold, she must have been a pretty-looking body\r\nenough. Yet, in spite of the latter inconvenience, she eats and\r\ndrinks too much every day, and tosses off a glass of maraschino with a\r\ntrembling pudgy hand, every finger of which twinkles with a dozen, at\r\nleast, of old rings. She has a story about every one of those rings, and\r\na stupid one too. But there is always something pleasant, I think, in\r\nstupid family stories: they are good-hearted people who tell them.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. Muchit, nothing need be said of her; she is Pash's\r\ncompanion; she has lived with Lady Pash since the peace. Nor does my\r\nLady take any more notice of her than of the dust of the earth. She\r\ncalls her \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Muchit,\xe2\x80\x9d and considers her a half-witted creature. Mrs.\r\nBerry hates her cordially, and thinks she is a designing toad-eater,\r\nwho has formed a conspiracy to rob her of her aunt's fortune. She never\r\nspoke a word to poor Muchit during the whole of dinner, or offered to\r\nhelp her to anything on the table.\r\n\r\nIn respect to Dobus, he is an old Peninsular man, as you are made to\r\nknow before you have been very long in his company; and, like most army\r\nsurgeons, is a great deal more military in his looks and conversation,\r\nthan the combatant part of the forces. He has adopted the\r\nsham-Duke-of-Wellington air, which is by no means uncommon in veterans;\r\nand, though one of the easiest and softest fellows in existence, speaks\r\nslowly and briefly, and raps out an oath or two occasionally, as it is\r\nsaid a certain great captain does. Besides the above, we sat down to\r\ntable with Captain Goff, late of the ---- Highlanders; the Reverend\r\nLemuel Whey, who preaches at St. Germains; little Cutler, and the\r\nFrenchman, who always WILL be at English parties on the Continent, and\r\nwho, after making some frightful efforts to speak English, subsides and\r\nis heard no more. Young married ladies and heads of families generally\r\nhave him for the purpose of waltzing, and in return he informs his\r\nfriends of the club or the cafe that he has made the conquest of a\r\ncharmante Anglaise. Listen to me, all family men who read this! and\r\nnever LET AN UNMARRIED FRENCHMAN INTO YOUR DOORS. This lecture alone is\r\nworth the price of the book. It is not that they do any harm in one case\r\nout of a thousand, Heaven forbid! but they mean harm. They look on our\r\nSusannas with unholy dishonest eyes. Hearken to two of the grinning\r\nrogues chattering together as they clink over the asphalte of\r\nthe Boulevard with lacquered boots, and plastered hair, and waxed\r\nmoustaches, and turned-down shirt-collars, and stays and goggling eyes,\r\nand hear how they talk of a good simple giddy vain dull Baker\r\nStreet creature, and canvass her points, and show her letters, and\r\ninsinuate--never mind, but I tell you my soul grows angry when I think\r\nof the same; and I can't hear of an Englishwoman marrying a Frenchman\r\nwithout feeling a sort of shame and pity for her. [4]\r\n\r\nTo return to the guests. The Reverend Lemuel Whey is a tea-party man,\r\nwith a curl on his forehead and a scented pocket-handkerchief. He ties\r\nhis white neckcloth to a wonder, and I believe sleeps in it. He brings\r\nhis flute with him; and prefers Handel, of course; but has one or two\r\npet profane songs of the sentimental kind, and will occasionally lift\r\nup his little pipe in a glee. He does not dance, but the honest fellow\r\nwould give the world to do it; and he leaves his clogs in the passage,\r\nthough it is a wonder he wears them, for in the muddiest weather he\r\nnever has a speck on his foot. He was at St. John's College, Cambridge,\r\nand was rather gay for a term or two, he says. He is, in a word, full of\r\nthe milk-and-water of human kindness, and his family lives near Hackney.\r\n\r\nAs for Goff, he has a huge shining bald forehead, and immense bristling\r\nIndian-red whiskers. He wears white wash-leather gloves, drinks fairly,\r\nlikes a rubber, and has a story for after dinner, beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, ye\r\nracklackt Sandy M'Lellan, who joined us in the West Indies. Wal, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n etc. These and little Cutler made up the party.\r\n\r\nNow it may not have struck all readers, but any sharp fellow conversant\r\nwith writing must have found out long ago, that if there had been\r\nsomething exceedingly interesting to narrate with regard to this dinner\r\nat Frank Berry's, I should have come out with it a couple of pages\r\nsince, nor have kept the public looking for so long a time at the\r\ndish-covers and ornaments of the table.\r\n\r\nBut the simple fact must now be told, that there was nothing of the\r\nslightest importance occurred at this repast, except that it gave me an\r\nopportunity of studying Mrs. Berry in many different ways; and, in spite\r\nof the extreme complaisance which she now showed me, of forming, I am\r\nsorry to say, a most unfavourable opinion of that fair lady. Truth to\r\ntell, I would much rather she should have been civil to Mrs. Muchit,\r\nthan outrageously complimentary to your humble servant; and as she\r\nprofessed not to know what on earth there was for dinner, would it not\r\nhave been much more natural for her not to frown, and bob, and wink,\r\nand point, and pinch her lips as often as Monsieur Anatole, her French\r\ndomestic, not knowing the ways of English dinner-tables, placed anything\r\nout of its due order? The allusions to Boodle Hall were innumerable,\r\nand I don't know any greater bore than to be obliged to talk of a place\r\nwhich belongs to one's elder brother. Many questions were likewise asked\r\nabout the dowager and her Scotch relatives, the Plumduffs, about whom\r\nLady Pash knew a great deal, having seen them at Court and at Lord\r\nMelville's. Of course she had seen them at Court and at Lord Melville's,\r\nas she might have seen thousands of Scotchmen besides; but what mattered\r\nit to me, who care not a jot for old Lady Fitz-Boodle? \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you write,\r\nyou'll say you met an old friend of her Ladyship's,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Berry,\r\nand I faithfully promised I would when I wrote; but if the New Post\r\nOffice paid us for writing letters (as very possibly it will soon), I\r\ncould not be bribed to send a line to old Lady Fitz.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I found that Berry, like many simple fellows before him, had\r\nmade choice of an imperious, ill-humoured, and underbred female for a\r\nwife, and could see with half an eye that he was a great deal too much\r\nher slave.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was not over yet, however. Witness that little encounter\r\nbefore dinner; and once or twice the honest fellow replied rather\r\nsmartly during the repast, taking especial care to atone as much\r\nas possible for his wife's inattention to Jack and Mrs. Muchit, by\r\nparticular attention to those personages, whom he helped to everything\r\nround about and pressed perpetually to champagne; he drank but little\r\nhimself, for his amiable wife's eye was constantly fixed on him.\r\n\r\nJust at the conclusion of the dessert, madame, who had bouded Berry\r\nduring dinner-time, became particularly gracious to her lord and master,\r\nand tenderly asked me if I did not think the French custom was a good\r\none, of men leaving table with the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it's a most abominable\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cutler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most abominable practice! Do you hear THAT?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Berry, laughing,\r\nand filling his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure, Frank, when we are alone you always come to the\r\ndrawing-room,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the lady, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! when we're alone, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d says Berry, blushing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now\r\nwe're NOT alone--ha, ha! Anatole, du Bordeaux!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure they sat after the ladies at Carlton House; didn't they, Lady\r\nPash?\xe2\x80\x9d says Dobus, who likes his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHAT they did!\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lady, giving him a jolly nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI racklackt,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaims Captain Goff, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was in the Mauritius, that\r\nMestress MacWhirter, who commanded the Saxty-Sackond, used to say, 'Mac,\r\nif ye want to get lively, ye'll not stop for more than two hours after\r\nthe leddies have laft ye: if ye want to get drunk, ye'll just dine at\r\nthe mass.' So ye see, Mestress Barry, what was Mac's allowance--haw,\r\nhaw! Mester Whey, I'll trouble ye for the o-lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut although we were in a clear majority, that indomitable woman, Mrs.\r\nBerry, determined to make us all as uneasy as possible, and would take\r\nthe votes all round. Poor Jack, of course, sided with her, and Whey said\r\nhe loved a cup of tea and a little music better than all the wine of\r\nBordeaux. As for the Frenchman, when Mrs. Berry said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you\r\nthink, M. le Vicomte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVat you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Blagueval, breaking silence for the first\r\ntime during two hours. \xe2\x80\x9cYase--eh? to me you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApry deeny, aimy-voo ally avec les dam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComment avec les dames?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlly avec les dam com a Parry, ou resty avec les Messew com on\r\nOnglyterre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madame! vous me le demandez?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the little wretch, starting up\r\nin a theatrical way, and putting out his hand, which Mrs. Berry took,\r\nand with this the ladies left the room. Old Lady Pash trotted after her\r\nniece with her hand in Whey's, very much wondering at such practices,\r\nwhich were not in the least in vogue in the reign of George III.\r\n\r\nMrs. Berry cast a glance of triumph at her husband, at the defection;\r\nand Berry was evidently annoyed that three-eighths of his male forces\r\nhad left him.\r\n\r\nBut fancy our delight and astonishment, when in a minute they all three\r\ncame back again; the Frenchman looking entirely astonished, and the\r\nparson and the painter both very queer. The fact is, old downright Lady\r\nPash, who had never been in Paris in her life before, and had no notion\r\nof being deprived of her usual hour's respite and nap, said at once to\r\nMrs. Berry, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Angelica, you're surely not going to keep these\r\nthree men here? Send them back to the dining-room, for I've a thousand\r\nthings to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d And Angelica, who expects to inherit her aunt's\r\nproperty, of course did as she was bid; on which the old lady fell into\r\nan easy chair, and fell asleep immediately,--so soon, that is, as\r\nthe shout caused by the reappearance of the three gentlemen in the\r\ndining-room had subsided.\r\n\r\nI had meanwhile had some private conversation with little Cutler\r\nregarding the character of Mrs. Berry. \xe2\x80\x9cShe's a regular screw,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whispered he; \xe2\x80\x9ca regular Tartar. Berry shows fight, though, sometimes,\r\nand I've known him have his own way for a week together. After dinner\r\nhe is his own master, and hers when he has had his share of wine; and\r\nthat's why she will never allow him to drink any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas it a wicked, or was it a noble and honourable thought which came\r\nto us both at the same minute, to rescue Berry from his captivity? The\r\nladies, of course, will give their verdict according to their gentle\r\nnatures; but I know what men of courage will think, and by their jovial\r\njudgment will abide.\r\n\r\nWe received, then, the three lost sheep back into our innocent fold\r\nagain with the most joyous shouting and cheering. We made Berry (who\r\nwas, in truth, nothing loth) order up I don't know how much more claret.\r\nWe obliged the Frenchman to drink malgre lui, and in the course of\r\na short time we had poor Whey in such a state of excitement, that he\r\nactually volunteered to sing a song, which he said he had heard at some\r\nvery gay supper-party at Cambridge, and which begins:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA pye sat on a pear-tree,\r\n      A pye sat on a pear-tree,\r\n      A pye sat on a pear-tree,\r\n        Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFancy Mrs. Berry's face as she looked in, in the midst of that\r\nBacchanalian ditty, when she saw no less a person than the Reverend\r\nLemuel Whey carolling it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Berry, as brave now as any Petruchio. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin, and sit down, and hear Whey's song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Pash is asleep, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, darling! that's the very reason. Give Mrs. Berry a glass, Jack,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you wake your aunt, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d hissed out madame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNEVER MIND ME, LOVE! I'M AWAKE, AND LIKE IT!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the venerable Lady\r\nPash from the salon. \xe2\x80\x9cSing away, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt which we all set up an audacious cheer; and Mrs. Berry flounced back\r\nto the drawing-room, but did not leave the door open, that her aunt\r\nmight hear our melodies.\r\n\r\nBerry had by this time arrived at that confidential state to which a\r\nthird bottle always brings the well-regulated mind; and he made a clean\r\nconfession to Cutler and myself of his numerous matrimonial annoyances.\r\nHe was not allowed to dine out, he said, and but seldom to ask his\r\nfriends to meet him at home. He never dared smoke a cigar for the life\r\nof him, not even in the stables. He spent the mornings dawdling in\r\neternal shops, the evenings at endless tea-parties, or in reading\r\npoems or missionary tracts to his wife. He was compelled to take physic\r\nwhenever she thought he looked a little pale, to change his shoes and\r\nstockings whenever he came in from a walk. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, opening\r\nhis chest, and shaking his fist at Dobus; \xe2\x80\x9clook what Angelica and that\r\ninfernal Dobus have brought me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it might be a flannel waistcoat into which madame had\r\nforced him; but it was worse: I give you my word of honour it was a\r\nPITCH-PLASTER!\r\n\r\nWe all roared at this, and the doctor as loud as anyone; but he vowed\r\nthat he had no hand in the pitch-plaster. It was a favourite family\r\nremedy of the late apothecary Sir George Catacomb, and had been put on\r\nby Mrs. Berry's own fair hands.\r\n\r\nWhen Anatole came in with coffee, Berry was in such high courage, that\r\nhe told him to go to the deuce with it; and we never caught sight of\r\nLady Pash more, except when, muffled up to the nose, she passed through\r\nthe salle-a-manger to go to her carriage, in which Dobus and the parson\r\nwere likewise to be transported to Paris. \xe2\x80\x9cBe a man, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d says she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand hold your own\xe2\x80\x9d--for the good old lady had taken her nephew's part\r\nin the matrimonial business--\xe2\x80\x9cand you, Mr. Fitz-Boodle, come and see him\r\noften. You're a good fellow, take old one-eyed Callipash's word for it.\r\nShall I take you to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDear kind Angelica, she had told her aunt all I said!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't go, George,\xe2\x80\x9d says Berry, squeezing me by the hand. So I said I\r\nwas going to sleep at Versailles that night; but if she would give a\r\nconvoy to Jack Butts, it would be conferring a great obligation on him;\r\nwith which favour the old lady accordingly complied, saying to him,\r\nwith great coolness, \xe2\x80\x9cGet up and sit with John in the rumble, Mr.\r\nWhat-d'ye-call-'im.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact is, the good old soul despises an artist\r\nas much as she does a tailor.\r\n\r\nJack tripped to his place very meekly; and \xe2\x80\x9cRemember Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe Doctor; and \xe2\x80\x9cDon't forget Thursday!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the divine,--\xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nbachelor's party, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d And so the cavalcade drove thundering down\r\nthe gloomy old Avenue de Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, I forgot to say, had gone away exceedingly ill long\r\nbefore; and the reminiscences of \xe2\x80\x9cThursday\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday\xe2\x80\x9d evoked by\r\nDobus and Whey, were, to tell the truth, parts of our conspiracy; for in\r\nthe heat of Berry's courage, we had made him promise to dine with us all\r\nround en garcon; with all except Captain Goff, who \xe2\x80\x9cracklacted\xe2\x80\x9d that he\r\nwas engaged every day for the next three weeks: as indeed he is, to\r\na thirty-sous ordinary which the gallant officer frequents, when not\r\ninvited elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCutler and I then were the last on the field; and though we were for\r\nmoving away, Berry, whose vigour had, if possible, been excited by the\r\nbustle and colloquy in the night air, insisted upon dragging us back\r\nagain, and actually proposed a grill for supper!\r\n\r\nWe found in the salle-a-manger a strong smell of an extinguished lamp,\r\nand Mrs. Berry was snuffing out the candles on the sideboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts Berry: \xe2\x80\x9ceasy, if you please; we've not done\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot done yet, Mr. Berry!\xe2\x80\x9d groans the lady, in a hollow sepulchral tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs. B., not done yet. We are going to have some supper, ain't we,\r\nGeorge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it's quite time to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fitz-Boodle (who, to say\r\nthe truth, began to tremble himself).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is, sir; you are quite right, sir; you will pardon me,\r\ngentlemen, I have a bad headache, and will retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said that audacious Berry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnatole, tell the\r\ncook to broil a fowl and bring some wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the loving couple had been alone, or if Cutler had not been an\r\nattache to the embassy, before whom she was afraid of making herself\r\nridiculous, I am confident that Mrs. Berry would have fainted away on\r\nthe spot; and that all Berry's courage would have tumbled down lifeless\r\nby the side of her. So she only gave a martyrised look, and left the\r\nroom; and while we partook of the very unnecessary repast, was good\r\nenough to sing some hymn-tunes to an exceedingly slow movement in the\r\nnext room, intimating that she was awake, and that, though suffering,\r\nshe found her consolations in religion.\r\n\r\nThese melodies did not in the least add to our friend's courage. The\r\ndevilled fowl had, somehow, no devil in it. The champagne in the glasses\r\nlooked exceedingly flat and blue. The fact is, that Cutler and I were\r\nnow both in a state of dire consternation, and soon made a move for\r\nour hats, and lighting each a cigar in the hall, made across the little\r\ngreen where the Cupids and nymphs were listening to the dribbling\r\nfountain in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm hanged if I don't have a cigar too!\xe2\x80\x9d says Berry, rushing after us;\r\nand accordingly putting in his pocket a key about the size of a shovel,\r\nwhich hung by the little handle of the outer grille, forth he sallied,\r\nand joined us in our fumigation.\r\n\r\nHe stayed with us a couple of hours, and returned homewards in perfect\r\ngood spirits, having given me his word of honour he would dine with us\r\nthe next day. He put his immense key into the grille, and unlocked it;\r\nbut the gate would not open: IT WAS BOLTED WITHIN.\r\n\r\nHe began to make a furious jangling and ringing at the bell; and in\r\noaths, both French and English, called upon the recalcitrant Anatole.\r\n\r\nAfter much tolling of the bell, a light came cutting across the crevices\r\nof the inner door; it was thrown open, and a figure appeared with a\r\nlamp,--a tall slim figure of a woman, clothed in white from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Berry, and when Cutler and I saw her, we both ran away as\r\nfast as our legs could carry us.\r\n\r\nBerry, at this, shrieked with a wild laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember to-morrow, old\r\nboys,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted he,--\xe2\x80\x9csix o'clock;\xe2\x80\x9d and we were a quarter of a mile off\r\nwhen the gate closed, and the little mansion of the Avenue de Paris was\r\nonce more quiet and dark.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, as we were playing at billiards, Cutler saw Mrs.\r\nBerry drive by in her carriage; and as soon as rather a long rubber was\r\nover, I thought I would go and look for our poor friend, and so went\r\ndown to the Pavilion. Every door was open, as the wont is in France, and\r\nI walked in unannounced, and saw this:\r\n\r\nHe was playing a duet with her on the flute. She had been out but for\r\nhalf-an-hour, after not speaking all the morning; and having seen Cutler\r\nat the billiard-room window, and suspecting we might take advantage\r\nof her absence, she had suddenly returned home again, and had flung\r\nherself, weeping, into her Frank's arms, and said she could not bear to\r\nleave him in anger. And so, after sitting for a little while sobbing on\r\nhis knee, she had forgotten and forgiven every thing!\r\n\r\nThe dear angel! I met poor Frank in Bond Street only yesterday; but he\r\ncrossed over to the other side of the way. He had on goloshes, and is\r\ngrown very fat and pale. He has shaved off his moustaches, and, instead,\r\nwears a respirator. He has taken his name off all his clubs, and lives\r\nvery grimly in Baker Street. Well, ladies, no doubt you say he is right:\r\nand what are the odds, so long as YOU are happy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENNIS HAGGARTY'S WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an odious Irishwoman who with her daughter used to frequent\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d at Leamington some years ago, and who went by the name\r\nof Mrs. Major Gam. Gam had been a distinguished officer in His Majesty's\r\nservice, whom nothing but death and his own amiable wife could overcome.\r\nThe widow mourned her husband in the most becoming bombazeen she could\r\nmuster, and had at least half an inch of lampblack round the immense\r\nvisiting tickets which she left at the houses of the nobility and gentry\r\nher friends.\r\n\r\nSome of us, I am sorry to say, used to call her Mrs. Major Gammon; for\r\nif the worthy widow had a propensity, it was to talk largely of herself\r\nand family (of her own family, for she held her husband's very cheap),\r\nand of the wonders of her paternal mansion, Molloyville, county of Mayo.\r\nShe was of the Molloys of that county; and though I never heard of the\r\nfamily before, I have little doubt, from what Mrs. Major Gam stated,\r\nthat they were the most ancient and illustrious family of that part of\r\nIreland. I remember there came down to see his aunt a young fellow\r\nwith huge red whiskers and tight nankeens, a green coat, and an awful\r\nbreastpin, who, after two days' stay at the Spa, proposed marriage to\r\nMiss S----, or, in default, a duel with her father; and who drove a\r\nflash curricle with a bay and a grey, and who was presented with much\r\npride by Mrs. Gam as Castlereagh Molloy of Molloyville. We all agreed\r\nthat he was the most insufferable snob of the whole season, and were\r\ndelighted when a bailiff came down in search of him.\r\n\r\nWell, this is all I know personally of the Molloyville family; but at\r\nthe house if you met the widow Gam, and talked on any subject in life,\r\nyou were sure to hear of it. If you asked her to have peas at dinner,\r\nshe would say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, after the peas at Molloyville, I really don't\r\ncare for any others,--do I, dearest Jemima? We always had a dish in the\r\nmonth of June, when my father gave his head gardener a guinea (we had\r\nthree at Molloyville), and sent him with his compliments and a quart of\r\npeas to our neighbour, dear Lord Marrowfat. What a sweet place Marrowfat\r\nPark is! isn't it, Jemima?\xe2\x80\x9d If a carriage passed by the window, Mrs.\r\nMajor Gammon would be sure to tell you that there were three carriages\r\nat Molloyville, \xe2\x80\x9cthe barouche, the chawiot, and the covered cyar.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nthe same manner she would favour you with the number and names of the\r\nfootmen of the establishment; and on a visit to Warwick Castle (for this\r\nbustling woman made one in every party of pleasure that was formed from\r\nthe hotel), she gave us to understand that the great walk by the river\r\nwas altogether inferior to the principal avenue of Molloyville Park.\r\nI should not have been able to tell so much about Mrs. Gam and her\r\ndaughter, but that, between ourselves, I was particularly sweet upon a\r\nyoung lady at the time, whose papa lived at the \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal,\xe2\x80\x9d and was under\r\nthe care of Doctor Jephson.\r\n\r\nThe Jemima appealed to by Mrs. Gam in the above sentence was, of course,\r\nher daughter, apostrophised by her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cJemima, my soul's darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n or, \xe2\x80\x9cJemima, my blessed child!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cJemima, my own love!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsacrifices that Mrs. Gam had made for that daughter were, she said,\r\nastonishing. The money she had spent in masters upon her, the illnesses\r\nthrough which she had nursed her, the ineffable love the mother bore\r\nher, were only known to Heaven, Mrs. Gam said. They used to come into\r\nthe room with their arms round each other's waists: at dinner between\r\nthe courses the mother would sit with one hand locked in her daughter's;\r\nand if only two or three young men were present at the time, would be\r\npretty sure to kiss her Jemima more than once during the time whilst the\r\nbohea was poured out.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Gam, if she was not handsome, candour forbids me to say she\r\nwas ugly. She was neither one nor t'other. She was a person who wore\r\nringlets and a band round her forehead; she knew four songs, which\r\nbecame rather tedious at the end of a couple of months' acquaintance;\r\nshe had excessively bare shoulders; she inclined to wear numbers of\r\ncheap ornaments, rings, brooches, ferronnieres, smelling-bottles, and\r\nwas always, we thought, very smartly dressed: though old Mrs. Lynx\r\nhinted that her gowns and her mother's were turned over and over again,\r\nand that her eyes were almost put out by darning stockings.\r\n\r\nThese eyes Miss Gam had very large, though rather red and weak, and used\r\nto roll them about at every eligible unmarried man in the place. But\r\nthough the widow subscribed to all the balls, though she hired a fly\r\nto go to the meet of the hounds, though she was constant at church, and\r\nJemima sang louder than any person there except the clerk, and though,\r\nprobably, any person who made her a happy husband would be invited down\r\nto enjoy the three footmen, gardeners, and carriages at Molloyville, yet\r\nno English gentleman was found sufficiently audacious to propose.\r\nOld Lynx used to say that the pair had been at Tunbridge, Harrogate,\r\nBrighton, Ramsgate, Cheltenham, for this eight years past; where they\r\nhad met, it seemed, with no better fortune. Indeed, the widow looked\r\nrather high for her blessed child: and as she looked with the contempt\r\nwhich no small number of Irish people feel upon all persons who get\r\ntheir bread by labour or commerce; and as she was a person whose\r\nenergetic manners, costume, and brogue were not much to the taste of\r\nquiet English country gentlemen, Jemima--sweet, spotless flower--still\r\nremained on her hands, a thought withered, perhaps, and seedy.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time, the 120th Regiment was quartered at Weedon Barracks,\r\nand with the corps was a certain Assistant-Surgeon Haggarty, a large,\r\nlean, tough, raw-boned man, with big hands, knock-knees, and carroty\r\nwhiskers, and, withal, as honest a creature as ever handled a lancet.\r\nHaggarty, as his name imports, was of the very same nation as Mrs. Gam,\r\nand, what is more, the honest fellow had some of the peculiarities which\r\nbelonged to the widow, and bragged about his family almost as much as\r\nshe did. I do not know of what particular part of Ireland they were\r\nkings; but monarchs they must have been, as have been the ancestors of\r\nso many thousand Hibernian families; but they had been men of no small\r\nconsideration in Dublin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere my father,\xe2\x80\x9d Haggarty said, \xe2\x80\x9cis as well\r\nknown as King William's statue, and where he 'rowls his carriage, too,'\r\nlet me tell ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHence, Haggarty was called by the wags \xe2\x80\x9cRowl the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d and several\r\nof them made inquiries of Mrs. Gam regarding him: \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Gam, when you\r\nused to go up from Molloyville to the Lord Lieutenant's balls, and had\r\nyour townhouse in Fitzwilliam Square, used you to meet the famous Doctor\r\nHaggarty in society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Surgeon Haggarty of Gloucester Street ye mean? The black Papist!\r\nD'ye suppose that the Molloys would sit down to table with a creature of\r\nthat sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, isn't he the most famous physician in Dublin, and doesn't he rowl\r\nhis carriage there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horrid wretch! He keeps a shop, I tell ye, and sends his sons out\r\nwith the medicine. He's got four of them off into the army, Ulick and\r\nPhil, and Terence and Denny, and now it's Charles that takes out the\r\nphysic. But how should I know about these odious creatures? Their mother\r\nwas a Burke, of Burke's Town, county Cavan, and brought Surgeon Haggarty\r\ntwo thousand pounds. She was a Protestant; and I am surprised how she\r\ncould have taken up with a horrid odious Popish apothecary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the extent of the widow's information, I am led to suppose that the\r\ninhabitants of Dublin are not less anxious about their neighbours than\r\nare the natives of English cities; and I think it is very probable that\r\nMrs. Gam's account of the young Haggartys who carried out the medicine\r\nis perfectly correct, for a lad in the 120th made a caricature of\r\nHaggarty coming out of a chemist's shop with an oilcloth basket under\r\nhis arm, which set the worthy surgeon in such a fury that there would\r\nhave been a duel between him and the ensign, could the fiery doctor have\r\nhad his way.\r\n\r\nNow, Dionysius Haggarty was of an exceedingly inflammable temperament,\r\nand it chanced that of all the invalids, the visitors, the young squires\r\nof Warwickshire, the young manufacturers from Birmingham, the young\r\nofficers from the barracks--it chanced, unluckily for Miss Gam and\r\nhimself, that he was the only individual who was in the least smitten\r\nby her personal charms. He was very tender and modest about his love,\r\nhowever, for it must be owned that he respected Mrs. Gam hugely, and\r\nfully admitted, like a good simple fellow as he was, the superiority of\r\nthat lady's birth and breeding to his own. How could he hope that he, a\r\nhumble assistant-surgeon, with a thousand pounds his Aunt Kitty left\r\nhim for all his fortune--how could he hope that one of the race of\r\nMolloyville would ever condescend to marry him?\r\n\r\nInflamed, however, by love, and inspired by wine, one day at a picnic at\r\nKenilworth, Haggarty, whose love and raptures were the talk of the whole\r\nregiment, was induced by his waggish comrades to make a proposal in\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you aware, Mr. Haggarty, that you are speaking to a Molloy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was all the reply majestic Mrs. Gam made when, according to the usual\r\nformula, the fluttering Jemima referred her suitor to \xe2\x80\x9cMamma.\xe2\x80\x9d She left\r\nhim with a look which was meant to crush the poor fellow to earth; she\r\ngathered up her cloak and bonnet, and precipitately called for her fly.\r\nShe took care to tell every single soul in Leamington that the son of\r\nthe odious Papist apothecary had had the audacity to propose for her\r\ndaughter (indeed a proposal, coming from whatever quarter it may,\r\ndoes no harm), and left Haggarty in a state of extreme depression and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nHis down-heartedness, indeed, surprised most of his acquaintances in and\r\nout of the regiment, for the young lady was no beauty, and a doubtful\r\nfortune, and Dennis was a man outwardly of an unromantic turn, who\r\nseemed to have a great deal more liking for beefsteak and whisky-punch\r\nthan for women, however fascinating.\r\n\r\nBut there is no doubt this shy uncouth rough fellow had a warmer and\r\nmore faithful heart hid within him than many a dandy who is as handsome\r\nas Apollo. I, for my part, never can understand why a man falls in love,\r\nand heartily give him credit for so doing, never mind with what or\r\nwhom. THAT I take to be a point quite as much beyond an individual's own\r\ncontrol as the catching of the small-pox or the colour of his hair. To\r\nthe surprise of all, Assistant-Surgeon Dionysius Haggarty was deeply and\r\nseriously in love; and I am told that one day he very nearly killed the\r\nbefore-mentioned young ensign with a carving-knife, for venturing to\r\nmake a second caricature, representing Lady Gammon and Jemima in a\r\nfantastical park, surrounded by three gardeners, three carriages, three\r\nfootmen, and the covered cyar. He would have no joking concerning them.\r\nHe became moody and quarrelsome of habit. He was for some time much more\r\nin the surgery and hospital than in the mess. He gave up the eating, for\r\nthe most part, of those vast quantities of beef and pudding, for which\r\nhis stomach used to afford such ample and swift accommodation; and when\r\nthe cloth was drawn, instead of taking twelve tumblers, and singing\r\nIrish melodies, as he used to do, in a horrible cracked yelling voice,\r\nhe would retire to his own apartment, or gloomily pace the barrack-yard,\r\nor madly whip and spur a grey mare he had on the road to Leamington,\r\nwhere his Jemima (although invisible for him) still dwelt.\r\n\r\nThe season at Leamington coming to a conclusion by the withdrawal of the\r\nyoung fellows who frequented that watering-place, the widow Gam retired\r\nto her usual quarters for the other months of the year. Where these\r\nquarters were, I think we have no right to ask, for I believe she had\r\nquarrelled with her brother at Molloyville, and besides, was a great\r\ndeal too proud to be a burden on anybody.\r\n\r\nNot only did the widow quit Leamington, but very soon afterwards the\r\n120th received its marching orders, and left Weedon and Warwickshire.\r\nHaggarty's appetite was by this time partially restored, but his love\r\nwas not altered, and his humour was still morose and gloomy. I am\r\ninformed that at this period of his life he wrote some poems relative to\r\nhis unhappy passion; a wild set of verses of several lengths, and in\r\nhis handwriting, being discovered upon a sheet of paper in which a\r\npitch-plaster was wrapped up, which Lieutenant and Adjutant Wheezer was\r\ncompelled to put on for a cold.\r\n\r\nFancy then, three years afterwards, the surprise of all Haggarty's\r\nacquaintances on reading in the public papers the following\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried, at Monkstown on the 12th instant, Dionysius Haggarty, Esq.,\r\nof H.M. 120th Foot, to Jemima Amelia Wilhelmina Molloy, daughter of the\r\nlate Major Lancelot Gam, R.M., and granddaughter of the late, and niece\r\nof the present Burke Bodkin Blake Molloy, Esq., Molloyville, county\r\nMayo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the course of true love at last begun to run smooth?\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, as\r\nI laid down the paper; and the old times, and the old leering bragging\r\nwidow, and the high shoulders of her daughter, and the jolly days with\r\nthe 120th, and Doctor Jephson's one-horse chaise, and the Warwickshire\r\nhunt, and--and Louisa S----, but never mind HER,--came back to my mind.\r\nHas that good-natured simple fellow at last met with his reward? Well,\r\nif he has not to marry the mother-in-law too, he may get on well enough.\r\n\r\nAnother year announced the retirement of Assistant-Surgeon Haggarty\r\nfrom the 120th, where he was replaced by Assistant-Surgeon Angus\r\nRothsay Leech, a Scotchman, probably; with whom I have not the least\r\nacquaintance, and who has nothing whatever to do with this little\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nStill more years passed on, during which time I will not say that I kept\r\na constant watch upon the fortunes of Mr. Haggarty and his lady; for,\r\nperhaps, if the truth were known, I never thought for a moment about\r\nthem; until one day, being at Kingstown, near Dublin, dawdling on\r\nthe beach, and staring at the Hill of Howth, as most people at that\r\nwatering-place do, I saw coming towards me a tall gaunt man, with a pair\r\nof bushy red whiskers, of which I thought I had seen the like in former\r\nyears, and a face which could be no other than Haggarty's. It was\r\nHaggarty, ten years older than when we last met, and greatly more grim\r\nand thin. He had on one shoulder a young gentleman in a dirty tartan\r\ncostume, and a face exceedingly like his own peeping from under a\r\nbattered plume of black feathers, while with his other hand he was\r\ndragging a light green go-cart, in which reposed a female infant of some\r\ntwo years old. Both were roaring with great power of lungs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Dennis saw me, his face lost the dull puzzled expression\r\nwhich had seemed to characterise it; he dropped the pole of the go-cart\r\nfrom one hand, and his son from the other, and came jumping forward to\r\ngreet me with all his might, leaving his progeny roaring in the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my sowl,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9csure it's Fitz-Boodle? Fitz, don't you\r\nremember me? Dennis Haggarty of the 120th? Leamington, you know? Molloy,\r\nmy boy, hould your tongue, and stop your screeching, and Jemima's too;\r\nd'ye hear? Well, it does good to sore eyes to see an old face. How fat\r\nyou're grown, Fitz; and were ye ever in Ireland before? and a'n't ye\r\ndelighted with it? Confess, now, isn't it beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question regarding the merits of their country, which I have\r\nremarked is put by most Irish persons, being answered in a satisfactory\r\nmanner, and the shouts of the infants appeased from an apple-stall\r\nhard by, Dennis and I talked of old times; I congratulated him on his\r\nmarriage with the lovely girl whom we all admired, and hoped he had a\r\nfortune with her, and so forth. His appearance, however, did not bespeak\r\na great fortune: he had an old grey hat, short old trousers, an old\r\nwaistcoat with regimental buttons, and patched Blucher boots, such as\r\nare not usually sported by persons in easy life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a sigh, in reply to my queries, \xe2\x80\x9ctimes are changed\r\nsince them days, Fitz-Boodle. My wife's not what she was--the beautiful\r\ncreature you knew her. Molloy, my boy, run off in a hurry to your mamma,\r\nand tell her an English gentleman is coming home to dine; for you'll\r\ndine with me, Fitz, in course?\xe2\x80\x9d And I agreed to partake of that meal;\r\nthough Master Molloy altogether declined to obey his papa's orders with\r\nrespect to announcing the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must announce you myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haggarty, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nit's just dinner-time, and my little cottage is not a hundred yards\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d Accordingly, we all marched in procession to Dennis's little\r\ncottage, which was one of a row and a half of one-storied houses, with\r\nlittle courtyards before them, and mostly with very fine names on the\r\ndoorposts of each. \xe2\x80\x9cSurgeon Haggarty\xe2\x80\x9d was emblazoned on Dennis's gate,\r\non a stained green copper-plate; and, not content with this, on the\r\ndoor-post above the bell was an oval with the inscription of \xe2\x80\x9cNew\r\nMolloyville.\xe2\x80\x9d The bell was broken, of course; the court, or garden-path,\r\nwas mouldy, weedy, seedy; there were some dirty rocks, by way of\r\nornament, round a faded glass-plat in the centre, some clothes and\r\nrags hanging out of most part of the windows of New Molloyville, the\r\nimmediate entrance to which was by a battered scraper, under a broken\r\ntrellis-work, up which a withered creeper declined any longer to climb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall, but snug,\xe2\x80\x9d says Haggarty: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll lead the way, Fitz; put your hat\r\non the flower-pot there, and turn to the left into the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n A fog of onions and turf-smoke filled the whole of the house, and gave\r\nsigns that dinner was not far off. Far off? You could hear it frizzling\r\nin the kitchen, where the maid was also endeavouring to hush the crying\r\nof a third refractory child. But as we entered, all three of Haggarty's\r\ndarlings were in full roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Dennis?\xe2\x80\x9d cried a sharp raw voice, from a dark corner in\r\nthe drawing-room to which we were introduced, and in which a dirty\r\ntablecloth was laid for dinner, some bottles of porter and a cold\r\nmutton-bone being laid out on a rickety grand piano hard by. \xe2\x80\x9cYe're\r\nalways late, Mr. Haggarty. Have you brought the whisky from Nowlan's?\r\nI'll go bail ye've not, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I've brought an old friend of yours and mine to take pot-luck\r\nwith us to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is he to come?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. At which speech I was rather\r\nsurprised, for I stood before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is, Jemima my love,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dennis, looking at me. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nFitz-Boodle: don't you remember him in Warwickshire, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fitz-Boodle! I am very glad to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, rising and\r\ncurtseying with much cordiality.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haggarty was blind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haggarty was not only blind, but it was evident that smallpox\r\nhad been the cause of her loss of vision. Her eyes were bound with a\r\nbandage, her features were entirely swollen, scarred and distorted by\r\nthe horrible effects of the malady. She had been knitting in a corner\r\nwhen we entered, and was wrapped in a very dirty bedgown. Her voice to\r\nme was quite different to that in which she addressed her husband. She\r\nspoke to Haggarty in broad Irish: she addressed me in that most odious\r\nof all languages--Irish-English, endeavouring to the utmost to disguise\r\nher brogue, and to speak with the true dawdling distingue English air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you long in I-a-land?\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor creature in this accent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust faind it a sad ba'ba'ous place, Mr Fitz-Boodle, I'm shu-ah! It was\r\nvary kaind of you to come upon us en famille, and accept a dinner sans\r\nceremonie. Mr. Haggarty, I hope you'll put the waine into aice, Mr.\r\nFitz-Boodle must be melted with this hot weathah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time she conducted the conversation in this polite strain, and\r\nI was obliged to say, in reply to a query of hers, that I did not find\r\nher the least altered, though I should never have recognised her but for\r\nthis rencontre. She told Haggarty with a significant air to get the wine\r\nfrom the cellah, and whispered to me that he was his own butlah; and the\r\npoor fellow, taking the hint, scudded away into the town for a pound of\r\nbeefsteak and a couple of bottles of wine from the tavern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the childhren get their potatoes and butther here?\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nbarefoot girl, with long black hair flowing over her face, which she\r\nthrust in at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them sup in the nursery, Elizabeth, and send--ah! Edwards to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it cook you mane, ma'am?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend her at once!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the unfortunate woman; and the noise of\r\nfrying presently ceasing, a hot woman made her appearance, wiping her\r\nbrows with her apron, and asking, with an accent decidedly Hibernian,\r\nwhat the misthress wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLead me up to my dressing-room, Edwards: I really am not fit to be seen\r\nin this dishabille by Mr. Fitz-Boodle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFait' I can't!\xe2\x80\x9d says Edwards; \xe2\x80\x9csure the masther's at the butcher's, and\r\ncan't look to the kitchen-fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, I must go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Haggarty; and Edwards, putting on a\r\nresigned air, and giving her arm and face a further rub with her apron,\r\nheld out her arm to Mrs. Dennis, and the pair went upstairs.\r\n\r\nShe left me to indulge my reflections for half-an-hour, at the end of\r\nwhich period she came downstairs dressed in an old yellow satin, with\r\nthe poor shoulders exposed just as much as ever. She had mounted a\r\ntawdry cap, which Haggarty himself must have selected for her. She had\r\nall sorts of necklaces, bracelets, and earrings in gold, in garnets,\r\nin mother-of-pearl, in ormolu. She brought in a furious savour of musk,\r\nwhich drove the odours of onions and turf-smoke before it; and she\r\nwaved across her wretched angular mean scarred features an old cambric\r\nhandkerchief with a yellow lace-border.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you would have known me anywhere, Mr. Fitz-Boodle?\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nwith a grin that was meant to be most fascinating. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sure you\r\nwould; for though my dreadful illness deprived me of my sight, it is a\r\nmercy that it did not change my features or complexion at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis mortification had been spared the unhappy woman; but I don't\r\nknow whether, with all her vanity, her infernal pride, folly, and\r\nselfishness, it was charitable to leave her in her error.\r\n\r\nYet why correct her? There is a quality in certain people which is\r\nabove all advice, exposure, or correction. Only let a man or woman have\r\nDULNESS sufficient, and they need bow to no extant authority. A dullard\r\nrecognises no betters; a dullard can't see that he is in the wrong;\r\na dullard has no scruples of conscience, no doubts of pleasing, or\r\nsucceeding, or doing right; no qualms for other people's feelings, no\r\nrespect but for the fool himself. How can you make a fool perceive he is\r\na fool? Such a personage can no more see his own folly than he can see\r\nhis own ears. And the great quality of Dulness is to be unalterably\r\ncontented with itself. What myriads of souls are there of this admirable\r\nsort,--selfish, stingy, ignorant, passionate, brutal; bad sons, mothers,\r\nfathers, never known to do kind actions!\r\n\r\nTo pause, however, in this disquisition, which was carrying us far off\r\nKingstown, New Molloyville, Ireland--nay, into the wide world wherever\r\nDulness inhabits--let it be stated that Mrs. Haggarty, from my brief\r\nacquaintance with her and her mother, was of the order of persons just\r\nmentioned. There was an air of conscious merit about her, very hard to\r\nswallow along with the infamous dinner poor Dennis managed, after\r\nmuch delay, to get on the table. She did not fail to invite me to\r\nMolloyville, where she said her cousin would be charmed to see me; and\r\nshe told me almost as many anecdotes about that place as her mother used\r\nto impart in former days. I observed, moreover, that Dennis cut her\r\nthe favourite pieces of the beefsteak, that she ate thereof with great\r\ngusto, and that she drank with similar eagerness of the various strong\r\nliquors at table. \xe2\x80\x9cWe Irish ladies are all fond of a leetle glass of\r\npunch,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a playful air, and Dennis mixed her a powerful\r\ntumbler of such violent grog as I myself could swallow only with some\r\ndifficulty. She talked of her suffering a great deal, of her sacrifices,\r\nof the luxuries to which she had been accustomed before marriage,--in\r\na word, of a hundred of those themes on which some ladies are in the\r\ncustom of enlarging when they wish to plague some husbands.\r\n\r\nBut honest Dennis, far from being angry at this perpetual, wearisome,\r\nimpudent recurrence to her own superiority, rather encouraged the\r\nconversation than otherwise. It pleased him to hear his wife discourse\r\nabout her merits and family splendours. He was so thoroughly beaten\r\ndown and henpecked, that he, as it were, gloried in his servitude, and\r\nfancied that his wife's magnificence reflected credit on himself. He\r\nlooked towards me, who was half sick of the woman and her egotism, as\r\nif expecting me to exhibit the deepest sympathy, and flung me glances\r\nacross the table as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a gifted creature my Jemima\r\nis, and what a fine fellow I am to be in possession of her!\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\nchildren came down she scolded them, of course, and dismissed them\r\nabruptly (for which circumstance, perhaps, the writer of these pages\r\nwas not in his heart very sorry), and, after having sat a preposterously\r\nlong time, left us, asking whether we would have coffee there or in her\r\nboudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! here, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis, with rather a troubled air, and\r\nin about ten minutes the lovely creature was led back to us again by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdwards,\xe2\x80\x9d and the coffee made its appearance. After coffee her husband\r\nbegged her to let Mr. Fitz-Boodle hear her voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHe longs for some of\r\nhis old favourites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! DO you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she; and was led in triumph to the jingling old\r\npiano, and with a screechy wiry voice, sang those very abominable old\r\nditties which I had heard her sing at Leamington ten years back.\r\n\r\nHaggarty, as she sang, flung himself back in the chair delighted.\r\nHusbands always are, and with the same song, one that they have heard\r\nwhen they were nineteen years old probably; most Englishmen's tunes have\r\nthat date, and it is rather affecting, I think, to hear an old gentleman\r\nof sixty or seventy quavering the old ditty that was fresh when HE was\r\nfresh and in his prime. If he has a musical wife, depend on it he thinks\r\nher old songs of 1788 are better than any he has heard since: in fact\r\nhe has heard NONE since. When the old couple are in high good-humour the\r\nold gentleman will take the old lady round the waist, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\r\ndo sing me one of your own songs,\xe2\x80\x9d and she sits down and sings with her\r\nold voice, and, as she sings, the roses of her youth bloom again for a\r\nmoment. Ranelagh resuscitates, and she is dancing a minuet in powder and\r\na train.\r\n\r\nThis is another digression. It was occasioned by looking at poor\r\nDennis's face while his wife was screeching (and, believe me, the former\r\nwas the more pleasant occupation). Bottom tickled by the fairies could\r\nnot have been in greater ecstasies. He thought the music was divine;\r\nand had further reason for exulting in it, which was, that his wife was\r\nalways in a good humour after singing, and never would sing but in that\r\nhappy frame of mind. Dennis had hinted so much in our little colloquy\r\nduring the ten minutes of his lady's absence in the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir;\xe2\x80\x9d so, at\r\nthe conclusion of each piece, we shouted \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d and clapped our hands\r\nlike mad.\r\n\r\nSuch was my insight into the life of Surgeon Dionysius Haggarty and his\r\nwife; and I must have come upon him at a favourable moment too, for poor\r\nDennis has spoken, subsequently, of our delightful evening at Kingstown,\r\nand evidently thinks to this day that his friend was fascinated by\r\nthe entertainment there. His inward economy was as follows: he had his\r\nhalf-pay, a thousand pounds, about a hundred a year that his father\r\nleft, and his wife had sixty pounds a year from the mother; which the\r\nmother, of course, never paid. He had no practice, for he was absorbed\r\nin attention to his Jemima and the children, whom he used to wash, to\r\ndress, to carry out, to walk, or to ride, as we have seen, and who\r\ncould not have a servant, as their dear blind mother could never be left\r\nalone. Mrs. Haggarty, a great invalid, used to lie in bed till one, and\r\nhave breakfast and hot luncheon there. A fifth part of his income was\r\nspent in having her wheeled about in a chair, by which it was his duty\r\nto walk daily for an allotted number of hours. Dinner would ensue, and\r\nthe amateur clergy, who abound in Ireland, and of whom Mrs. Haggarty\r\nwas a great admirer, lauded her everywhere as a model of resignation and\r\nvirtue, and praised beyond measure the admirable piety with which she\r\nbore her sufferings.\r\n\r\nWell, every man to his taste. It did not certainly appear to me that SHE\r\nwas the martyr of the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances of my marriage with Jemima,\xe2\x80\x9d Dennis said to me, in\r\nsome after conversations we had on this interesting subject, \xe2\x80\x9cwere the\r\nmost romantic and touching you can conceive. You saw what an impression\r\nthe dear girl had made upon me when we were at Weedon; for from the\r\nfirst day I set eyes on her, and heard her sing her delightful song of\r\n'Dark-eyed Maiden of Araby,' I felt, and said to Turniquet of ours, that\r\nvery night, that SHE was the dark-eyed maid of Araby for ME--not that\r\nshe was, you know, for she was born in Shropshire. But I felt that I had\r\nseen the woman who was to make me happy or miserable for life. You know\r\nhow I proposed for her at Kenilworth, and how I was rejected, and how I\r\nalmost shot myself in consequence--no, you don't know that, for I said\r\nnothing about it to anyone, but I can tell you it was a very near thing;\r\nand a very lucky thing for me I didn't do it: for,--would you believe\r\nit?--the dear girl was in love with me all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she really?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, who recollected that Miss Gam's love of those\r\ndays showed itself in a very singular manner; but the fact is, when\r\nwomen are most in love they most disguise it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver head and ears in love with poor Dennis,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed that worthy\r\nfellow, \xe2\x80\x9cwho'd ever have thought it? But I have it from the best\r\nauthority, from her own mother, with whom I'm not over and above good\r\nfriends now; but of this fact she assured me, and I'll tell you when and\r\nhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were quartered at Cork three years after we were at Weedon, and it\r\nwas our last year at home; and a great mercy that my dear girl spoke\r\nin time, or where should we have been now? Well, one day, marching\r\nhome from parade, I saw a lady seated at an open window, by another who\r\nseemed an invalid, and the lady at the window, who was dressed in the\r\nprofoundest mourning, cried out, with a scream, 'Gracious, heavens! it's\r\nMr. Haggarty of the 120th.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Sure I know that voice,' says I to Whiskerton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's a great mercy you don't know it a deal too well,' says he: 'it's\r\nLady Gammon. She's on some husband-hunting scheme, depend on it, for\r\nthat daughter of hers. She was at Bath last year on the same errand, and\r\nat Cheltenham the year before, where, Heaven bless you! she's as well\r\nknown as the \xe2\x80\x9cHen and Chickens.\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'll thank you not to speak disrespectfully of Miss Jemima Gam,' said\r\nI to Whiskerton; 'she's of one of the first families in Ireland, and\r\nwhoever says a word against a woman I once proposed for, insults me,--do\r\nyou understand?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, marry her, if you like,' says Whiskerton, quite peevish: 'marry\r\nher, and be hanged!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry her! the very idea of it set my brain a-whirling, and made me a\r\nthousand times more mad than I am by nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure I walked up the hill to the parade-ground that\r\nafternoon, and with a beating heart too. I came to the widow's house. It\r\nwas called 'New Molloyville,' as this is. Wherever she takes a house for\r\nsix months she calls it 'New Molloyville;' and has had one in Mallow,\r\nin Bandon, in Sligo, in Castlebar, in Fermoy, in Drogheda, and the deuce\r\nknows where besides: but the blinds were down, and though I thought I\r\nsaw somebody behind 'em, no notice was taken of poor Denny Haggarty,\r\nand I paced up and down all mess-time in hopes of catching a glimpse of\r\nJemima, but in vain. The next day I was on the ground again; I was just\r\nas much in love as ever, that's the fact. I'd never been in that way\r\nbefore, look you; and when once caught, I knew it was for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no use in telling you how long I beat about the bush, but when\r\nI DID get admittance to the house (it was through the means of young\r\nCastlereagh Molloy, whom you may remember at Leamington, and who was\r\nat Cork for the regatta, and used to dine at our mess, and had taken a\r\nmighty fancy to me)--when I DID get into the house, I say, I rushed in\r\nmedias res at once; I couldn't keep myself quiet, my heart was too full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Fitz! I shall never forget the day,--the moment I was inthrojuiced\r\ninto the dthrawing-room\xe2\x80\x9d (as he began to be agitated, Dennis's brogue\r\nbroke out with greater richness than ever; but though a stranger may\r\ncatch, and repeat from memory, a few words, it is next to impossible for\r\nhim to KEEP UP A CONVERSATION in Irish, so that we had best give up all\r\nattempts to imitate Dennis). \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw old mother Gam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nfeelings overcame me all at once. I rowled down on the ground, sir, as\r\nif I'd been hit by a musket-ball. 'Dearest madam,' says I, 'I'll die if\r\nyou don't give me Jemima.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Heavens, Mr. Haggarty!' says she, 'how you seize me with surprise!\r\nCastlereagh, my dear nephew, had you not better leave us?' and away he\r\nwent, lighting a cigar, and leaving me still on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Rise, Mr. Haggarty,' continued the widow. 'I will not attempt to deny\r\nthat this constancy towards my daughter is extremely affecting, however\r\nsudden your present appeal may be. I will not attempt to deny that,\r\nperhaps, Jemima may have a similar feeling; but, as I said, I never\r\ncould give my daughter to a Catholic.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'm as good a Protestant as yourself, ma'am,' says I; 'my mother was\r\nan heiress, and we were all brought up her way.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That makes the matter very different,' says she, turning up the whites\r\nof her eyes. 'How could I ever have reconciled it to my conscience to\r\nsee my blessed child married to a Papist? How could I ever have taken\r\nhim to Molloyville? Well, this obstacle being removed, _I_ must put\r\nmyself no longer in the way between two young people. _I_ must sacrifice\r\nmyself; as I always have when my darling girl was in question. YOU shall\r\nsee her, the poor dear lovely gentle sufferer, and learn your fate from\r\nher own lips.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The sufferer, ma'am,' says I; 'has Miss Gam been ill?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What! haven't you heard?' cried the widow. 'Haven't you heard of the\r\ndreadful illness which so nearly carried her from me? For nine weeks,\r\nMr. Haggarty, I watched her day and night, without taking a wink of\r\nsleep,--for nine weeks she lay trembling between death and life; and I\r\npaid the doctor eighty-three guineas. She is restored now; but she is\r\nthe wreck of the beautiful creature she was. Suffering, and, perhaps,\r\nANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT--but we won't mention that NOW--have so pulled\r\nher down. But I will leave you, and prepare my sweet girl for this\r\nstrange, this entirely unexpected visit.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't tell you what took place between me and Jemima, to whom I was\r\nintroduced as she sat in the darkened room, poor sufferer! nor describe\r\nto you with what a thrill of joy I seized (after groping about for it)\r\nher poor emaciated hand. She did not withdraw it; I came out of that\r\nroom an engaged man, sir; and NOW I was enabled to show her that I had\r\nalways loved her sincerely, for there was my will, made three years\r\nback, in her favour: that night she refused me, as I told ye. I would\r\nhave shot myself, but they'd have brought me in non compos; and my\r\nbrother Mick would have contested the will, and so I determined to live,\r\nin order that she might benefit by my dying. I had but a thousand pounds\r\nthen: since that my father has left me two more. I willed every shilling\r\nto her, as you may fancy, and settled it upon her when we married, as we\r\ndid soon after. It was not for some time that I was allowed to see\r\nthe poor girl's face, or, indeed, was aware of the horrid loss she had\r\nsustained. Fancy my agony, my dear fellow, when I saw that beautiful\r\nwreck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something not a little affecting to think, in the conduct of\r\nthis brave fellow, that he never once, as he told his story, seemed to\r\nallude to the possibility of his declining to marry a woman who was not\r\nthe same as the woman he loved; but that he was quite as faithful to\r\nher now, as he had been when captivated by the poor tawdry charms of the\r\nsilly Miss of Leamington. It was hard that such a noble heart as this\r\nshould be flung away upon yonder foul mass of greedy vanity. Was it\r\nhard, or not, that he should remain deceived in his obstinate humility,\r\nand continue to admire the selfish silly being whom he had chosen to\r\nworship?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been appointed surgeon of the regiment,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nDennis, \xe2\x80\x9csoon after, when it was ordered abroad to Jamaica, where it now\r\nis. But my wife would not hear of going, and said she would break her\r\nheart if she left her mother. So I retired on half-pay, and took this\r\ncottage; and in case any practice should fall in my way--why, there is\r\nmy name on the brass plate, and I'm ready for anything that comes. But\r\nthe only case that ever DID come was one day when I was driving my wife\r\nin the chaise; and another, one night, of a beggar with a broken head.\r\nMy wife makes me a present of a baby every year, and we've no debts; and\r\nbetween you and me and the post, as long as my mother-in-law is out of\r\nthe house, I'm as happy as I need be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you and the old lady don't get on well?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't say we do; it's not in nature, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis, with a\r\nfaint grin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe comes into the house, and turns it topsy-turvy. When\r\nshe's here I'm obliged to sleep in the scullery. She's never paid her\r\ndaughter's income since the first year, though she brags about her\r\nsacrifices as if she had ruined herself for Jemima; and besides, when\r\nshe's here, there's a whole clan of the Molloys, horse, foot, and\r\ndragoons, that are quartered upon us, and eat me out of house and home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is Molloyville such a fine place as the widow described it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nI, laughing, and not a little curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a mighty fine place entirely!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis. \xe2\x80\x9cThere's the oak park\r\nof two hundred acres, the finest land ye ever saw, only they've cut all\r\nthe wood down. The garden in the old Molloys' time, they say, was the\r\nfinest ever seen in the West of Ireland; but they've taken all the glass\r\nto mend the house windows: and small blame to them either. There's a\r\nclear rent-roll of thirty-five hundred a year, only it's in the hand of\r\nreceivers; besides other debts, for which there is no land security.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin-in-law, Castlereagh Molloy, won't come into a large\r\nfortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he'll do very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as he can get credit,\r\nhe's not the fellow to stint himself. Faith, I was fool enough to put my\r\nname to a bit of paper for him, and as they could not catch him in Mayo,\r\nthey laid hold of me at Kingstown here. And there was a pretty to do.\r\nDidn't Mrs. Gam say I was ruining her family, that's all? I paid it by\r\ninstalments (for all my money is settled on Jemima); and Castlereagh,\r\nwho's an honourable fellow, offered me any satisfaction in life. Anyhow,\r\nhe couldn't do more than THAT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not: and now you're friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he and his aunt have had a tiff, too; and he abuses her\r\nproperly, I warrant ye. He says that she carried about Jemima from place\r\nto place, and flung her at the head of every unmarried man in England\r\na'most--my poor Jemima, and she all the while dying in love with me!\r\nAs soon as she got over the small-pox--she took it at Fermoy--God bless\r\nher, I wish I'd been by to be her nurse-tender--as soon as she was\r\nrid of it, the old lady said to Castlereagh, 'Castlereagh, go to the\r\nbar'cks, and find out in the Army List where the 120th is.' Off she came\r\nto Cork hot foot. It appears that while she was ill, Jemima's love for\r\nme showed itself in such a violent way that her mother was overcome, and\r\npromised that, should the dear child recover, she would try and bring us\r\ntogether. Castlereagh says she would have gone after us to Jamaica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt she would,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you have a stronger proof of love than that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dennis. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear girl's illness and frightful blindness have, of course, injured her\r\nhealth and her temper. She cannot in her position look to the children,\r\nyou know, and so they come under my charge for the most part; and her\r\ntemper is unequal, certainly. But you see what a sensitive, refined,\r\nelegant creature she is, and may fancy that she's often put out by a\r\nrough fellow like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Dennis left me, saying it was time to go and walk out the children;\r\nand I think his story has matter of some wholesome reflection in it for\r\nbachelors who are about to change their condition, or may console some\r\nwho are mourning their celibacy. Marry, gentlemen, if you like; leave\r\nyour comfortable dinner at the club for cold-mutton and curl-papers at\r\nyour home; give up your books or pleasures, and take to yourselves wives\r\nand children; but think well on what you do first, as I have no doubt\r\nyou will after this advice and example. Advice is always useful in\r\nmatters of love; men always take it; they always follow other people's\r\nopinions, not their own: they always profit by example. When they see a\r\npretty woman, and feel the delicious madness of love coming over them,\r\nthey always stop to calculate her temper, her money, their own money,\r\nor suitableness for the married life.... Ha, ha, ha! Let us fool in this\r\nway no more. I have been in love forty-three times with all ranks and\r\nconditions of women, and would have married every time if they would\r\nhave let me. How many wives had King Solomon, the wisest of men? And is\r\nnot that story a warning to us that Love is master of the wisest? It is\r\nonly fools who defy him.\r\n\r\nI must come, however, to the last, and perhaps the saddest, part of poor\r\nDenny Haggarty's history. I met him once more, and in such a condition\r\nas made me determine to write this history.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June last I happened to be at Richmond, a delightful\r\nlittle place of retreat; and there, sunning himself upon the terrace,\r\nwas my old friend of the 120th: he looked older, thinner, poorer,\r\nand more wretched than I had ever seen him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you have given up\r\nKingstown?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shaking him by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is my lady and your family here at Richmond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a sad shake of the head; and the poor fellow's\r\nhollow eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Denny! what's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. He was squeezing my\r\nhand like a vice as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey've LEFT me!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out with a dreadful shout of passionate\r\ngrief--a horrible scream which seemed to be wrenched out of his heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sinking down on a seat, and clenching his great\r\nfists, and shaking his lean arms wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm a wise man now, Mr.\r\nFitz-Boodle. Jemima has gone away from me, and yet you know how I loved\r\nher, and how happy we were! I've got nobody now; but I'll die soon,\r\nthat's one comfort: and to think it's she that'll kill me after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe story, which he told with a wild and furious lamentation such as is\r\nnot known among men of our cooler country, and such as I don't like now\r\nto recall, was a very simple one. The mother-in-law had taken possession\r\nof the house, and had driven him from it. His property at his marriage\r\nwas settled on his wife. She had never loved him, and told him this\r\nsecret at last, and drove him out of doors with her selfish scorn and\r\nill-temper. The boy had died; the girls were better, he said, brought up\r\namong the Molloys than they could be with him; and so he was quite alone\r\nin the world, and was living, or rather dying, on forty pounds a year.\r\n\r\nHis troubles are very likely over by this time. The two fools who caused\r\nhis misery will never read this history of him; THEY never read godless\r\nstories in magazines: and I wish, honest reader, that you and I went to\r\nchurch as much as they do. These people are not wicked BECAUSE of\r\ntheir religious observances, but IN SPITE of them. They are too dull to\r\nunderstand humility, too blind to see a tender and simple heart under\r\na rough ungainly bosom. They are sure that all their conduct towards my\r\npoor friend here has been perfectly righteous, and that they have given\r\nproofs of the most Christian virtue. Haggarty's wife is considered by\r\nher friends as a martyr to a savage husband, and her mother is the angel\r\nthat has come to rescue her. All they did was to cheat him and desert\r\nhim. And safe in that wonderful self-complacency with which the fools\r\nof this earth are endowed, they have not a single pang of conscience for\r\ntheir villany towards him, consider their heartlessness as a proof and\r\nconsequence of their spotless piety and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The words of this song are copyright, nor will the\r\ncopyright be sold for less than twopence-halfpenny.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A French proverbe furnished the author with the notion of\r\nthe rivalry between the Barber and the Tailor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: As it is very probable that many fair readers may not\r\napprove of the extremely forcible language in which the combat is\r\ndepicted, I beg them to skip it and pass on to the next chapter, and to\r\nremember that it has been modelled on the style of the very best writers\r\nof the sporting papers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Every person who has lived abroad can, of course, point out\r\na score of honourable exceptions to the case above hinted at, and knows\r\nmany such unions in which it is the Frenchman who honours the English\r\nlady by marrying her.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
