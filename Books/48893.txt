Renduel\r\nhad made the acquaintance of the author at Victor Hugo\'s; he had\r\npublished in August, 1833, his first volume of prose, _Young France_,\r\nand now it was a question of launching a work in two volumes, a truly\r\ndaring undertaking for a publisher of that day; especially in the case\r\nof the work of an author but little known and only twenty-two years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n_Mademoiselle de Maupin_ was not, however, destined to see the light so\r\nsoon. For two years Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, more enamored of freedom than of\r\nwork, or preferring the task of making two harmonious rhymes to all the\r\nbeauties of his learned and rhythmic prose, incessantly abandoned and\r\nresumed the promised work. A tradition preserved in the family of the\r\npoet tells how his father often shut him up in his room at that time,\r\nforbidding him to leave it until he had completed a certain number of\r\npages of the _Grotesques_ or of _Mademoiselle de Maupin._ When the\r\nmaternal kindness did not come to his aid, the frolicsome author, who\r\nthen lived with his parents on Place Royale, often found the means\r\nof getting away by the window and so escaping a paternal task. Such\r\nescapades being frequently renewed, it may well be believed that the\r\nnovel made but little progress; 1834 was drawing to a close; only the\r\nfirst of the two volumes was finished; the publisher complained, and\r\nthe author tried to pacify him by notes similar to the following:\r\n\r\n"I have just discovered at a bric-\xc3\xa0-brac dealer\'s a charming picture of\r\nBoucher in a splendid state of preservation; it is an opportunity that\r\nI do not wish to miss, and not having money enough, I take the liberty\r\nof asking you for my balance.[1] You will confer on me a real pleasure\r\nin sending it to me.\r\n\r\n"I am harnessed to _La Maupin_, and that prevents me from prowling\r\nabout and calling on you.\r\n\r\n"With cordial wishes, I am, yours,\r\n\r\n"TH\xc3\x89OPHILE GAUTIER."\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1835, the second volume was written in six weeks on Rue du\r\nDoyenn\xc3\xa9, where the poet, having left the paternal nest, had installed\r\nhimself; the manuscript was delivered to Renduel and we read the\r\nfollowing note in _Le Monde Dramatique_, of September 20th, concerning\r\nthe biography of the strange person who really bore the name of Maupin,\r\na biography signed by Rochefort and published in that number under the\r\ntitle: _Mademoiselle d\'Aubigny-Maupin_: "One of our collaborators,\r\nMonsieur Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, has been busy for a long time on a romance\r\nentitled: _Mademoiselle (de) Maupin._"\r\n\r\nThe work was now soon to appear; it was issued in November, 1835,\r\nin two octavo volumes, printed by Madame Poussin under the title:\r\n_Mademoiselle de Maupin--Double Love._ The first volume bears the date\r\n1835, the second 1836, while the preface is dated May, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe work produced no very great sensation. A few journals spoke of\r\nit, but publicity was not then systematized as it is to-day, and\r\nexcept by some few literary men and the small romantic group of the\r\nauthor\'s friends, _Mademoiselle de Maupin_ was soon forgotten. Let\r\nus remark, nevertheless, that immediately the book appeared, Honor\xc3\xa9\r\nde Balzac wrote Renduel a note, asking for a copy, this note we\r\nhave seen ourselves; from this moment dates the admiration that he\r\nalways professed thereafter for Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier. We learn from\r\nMonsieur Ars\xc3\xa8ne Houssaye, the old and faithful friend of the poet,\r\nthat owing to the failure to sell the work, Renduel determined not\r\nto publish anything more for his author; _La Com\xc3\xa9die de la Mort_,\r\nalready announced upon the covers of the work (as well as _Capitaine\r\nFracasse)_, was, in fact, returned to the author, and only appeared in\r\n1838, when it was published by Desessart, at that time one of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nHoussaye\'s publishers; it was the author of _La Couronne de Bleuets_,\r\nwho introduced his friend to him and secured a favorable consideration\r\nfor his collection of verses.\r\n\r\nHow strange to us and unlikely, even, all this seems, when one recalls\r\nthe exorbitant prices obtained for some years past for rare, stitched\r\ncopies in good condition of the first edition of the work that we are\r\nnow considering. Many have realized one thousand five hundred francs,\r\nthat is to say, the total sums received by the author as royalty on\r\nthe first issue of his work. This sum is verified by his receipts to\r\nRenduel, which are in our hands.\r\n\r\nA curious incident occurred as to _Mademoiselle de Maupin._ After\r\nits appearance, all the opening of the eleventh chapter was inserted\r\nin _Le Monde Dramatique_ of January 4, 1836, without mentioning its\r\nsource, under the title of: _La Com\xc3\xa9die Romanesque._ Since that time,\r\nthose pages have been frequently reprinted, but not a single one of\r\nthese reproductions gives any indication of their origin. It must be\r\nadmitted that Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier himself gave rise to this error in _La\r\nPresse_ of December 17, 1838, in again quoting these lines, inserted\r\nin an unpublished commentary, as an isolated article which had come\r\nunder his notice by chance. He had forgotten this extract, and believed\r\nin good faith to have found in _La Monde Dramatique_ only a newspaper\r\nimprovisation. This first mistake was the starting-point of all that\r\nsucceeded, the most striking of which is the insertion in 1858 of this\r\nfragment from _Mademoiselle de Maupin_ in the first volume of Th\xc3\xa9ophile\r\nGautier\'s work: _Histoire de l\'Art Dramatique in France._ It is useless\r\nto add that no one noticed this fact.\r\n\r\nTime, however, rolled on, and the renown of the poet continued to\r\nincrease; his appearance in _La Presse_ in 1836, and his critical\r\nwork, had made a circle of new readers. Then, _Fortunio, La Com\xc3\xa9die de\r\nla Mort, Une Larme du Diable, Tra Los Mont\xc3\xa8s, Les Grotesques_, etc.,\r\netc., had considerably increased his literary _impedimenta._ So, when\r\nMonsieur Charpentier, the father of the present publisher of Th\xc3\xa9ophile\r\nGautier\'s complete works, had founded the collection to which he gave\r\nhis name, he soon thought of reprinting our author\'s principal works.\r\nMonsieur Charpentier, who succeeded in grouping in his catalogue the\r\nmost select of the remarkable works of his age, was of refined literary\r\ntaste and held among the publishers of his day a place similar to that\r\nthen held by Monsieur Buloz in his capacity of director of _La Revue\r\ndes Deux Mondes_: it was difficult to obtain an interview with either,\r\nand to appear in print in their collections was regarded as a kind of\r\nconsecration.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1845 when four of Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier\'s volumes appeared in the\r\nCharpentier catalogue; they were _Po\xc3\xa9sies Compl\xc3\xa8tes, Nouvelles, Voyage\r\nen Espagne_, and _Mademoiselle de Maupin._ For this reprint, the first\r\nsince the original edition[2], the author modified, but very slightly,\r\nsome phrases of his work, the text of which, from that time, has never\r\nbeen changed.\r\n\r\nHere ends, in reality, the history of this work. Since 1845, the\r\nnumber of editions has continued to increase; we will only quote two\r\nthat appeared in 1878: one in two volumes, 24mo, illustrated with four\r\ndesigns by Eug\xc3\xa8n Giraud, and another in a large 12mo volume, upon\r\nHolland paper, embellished with a portrait of the heroine by Th\xc3\xa9ophile\r\nGautier himself, the portrait dated 1834. Finally, in 1880, there was\r\nadded to a reprint of this edition, a reproduction of the medallion of\r\nthe author by David d\'Anger; this reproduction is erroneously dated\r\n1834, instead of 1835, which is the actual year of its execution.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, as has often been asserted, that this work, whose\r\nincomparable style should have warranted the opening of the doors of\r\nthe Acad\xc3\xa9mie Fran\xc3\xa7aise to the author, was in part the cause of their\r\nremaining stubbornly closed against him?--We do not know; but from\r\nanother tradition preserved in the poet\'s family, it would appear that\r\nthe father himself, when he knew of the completion of the work (only\r\nthe first volume, as we have seen, was written under his eyes), could\r\nnot have been without apprehension as to the part which the book would\r\nplay in the life of his son, and, notwithstanding his admiration for\r\nthe style of the work, he would often have expressed the fear that the\r\nsecond volume would at times influence the future of the author.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the renown of Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, like that of his\r\nillustrious friend, Honor\xc3\xa9 de Balzac, who, likewise, was never a member\r\nof the Acad\xc3\xa9mie, has only increased since his death, and the names of\r\nthese two rare talents are in truth missed among those of the members\r\nof that illustrious body. For Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier at least, the Acad\xc3\xa9mie\r\nitself expressed one day, by the mouth of one of its members, its\r\nregret at not having received him. On October 25, 1872, at its public\r\nsession and at the very hour of the obsequies of the great writer,\r\nMonsieur Camille Doucet pronounced the following words which do honor\r\nto their author, and we are happy to reproduce them here: "Permit me to\r\ndigress a moment. When I speak of the fraternity of Letters, I should\r\nfail, messieurs, if I appeared longer to forget that at this very\r\nhour, upon the threshold of a tomb, which I have left only with regret\r\nto come here to fulfil another duty, Letters mourning, weep for a true\r\npoet dear to all, a brilliant writer whose wit was thoroughly French\r\nand whose heart was still more French. Very many votes have proved to\r\nhim that his place was indicated among us, and so we deplore the more\r\nthe sudden stroke to which Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier succumbs."\r\n\r\nWe will add nothing to these touching lines and will close this notice\r\nby saying a few words as to the present edition of _Mademoiselle de\r\nMaupin._ It is the first reprint, absolutely conforming to the original\r\ntext. The work appears in two volumes, divided like those of 1835,\r\nand the publishers have exerted every effort to satisfy bibliophiles\r\ndesirous of possessing as perfect an edition as possible, both as\r\nregards the exactness of the text and the technical execution of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us say that the designs of E. Toudouze, made especially\r\nfor this work, will render this edition still more complete. It will\r\nrank, we hope, among the most treasured editions of the book.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DE LOVENJOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of his royalties as author of _Young France._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Figaro_, of May 26, 1837, and some other journals,\r\nannounced the sale, at Renduel\'s, of a second edition of this book. It\r\nwas only the first edition that the publisher was trying to get rid of\r\nby this means.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most burlesque incidents of the glorious epoch in which\r\nwe have the good fortune to live side by side with Deutz and General\r\nBugeaud, is, beyond question, the rehabilitation of virtue undertaken\r\nby all the newspapers, of whatever color they may be, red, green, or\r\ntri-colored.\r\n\r\nVirtue is most assuredly a very respectable thing, and we have no\r\nwish to fail in our devotion to the excellent, worthy creature--God\r\nforbid!--We consider that her eyes shine with sufficient brilliancy\r\nthrough her spectacles, that her stockings are reasonably well put on,\r\nthat she takes snuff from her gold snuff-box with all imaginable grace,\r\nthat her little dog courtesies like a dancing-master.--We agree to all\r\nthat.--We are even willing to admit that her figure is not bad for her\r\nage, and that she carries her years as well as any one could. She is\r\na very agreeable grandmother, but she is a grandmother. It seems to\r\nme to be natural to prefer to her, especially when one is twenty years\r\nold, some little immorality, very pert, very coquettish, very wanton,\r\nwith the hair a little out of curl, the skirt rather short than long,\r\nthe foot and eye alluring, the cheek slightly flushed, a smile on the\r\nlips and the heart in the hand.--The most horribly virtuous journalists\r\ncan hardly be of a different opinion; and, if they say the contrary,\r\nit is very probable that they do not think it. To think one thing and\r\nwrite another is something that happens every day, especially among\r\nvirtuous folk.\r\n\r\nI remember the epigrams uttered before the Revolution--I refer to the\r\nRevolution of July--against the ill-fated and virginal Vicomte Sosth\xc3\xa8ne\r\nde la Rochefoucauld, who lengthened the skirts of the dancers at the\r\nOp\xc3\xa9ra and applied with his own patrician hands a chaste plaster around\r\nthe middle of all the statues.--Monsieur le Vicomte Sosth\xc3\xa8ne de la\r\nRochefoucauld is far surpassed.--Modesty has been greatly perfected\r\nsince his day, and we go into refinements that he would never have\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nI, who am not accustomed to look at statues in certain places,\r\nconsidered, as others did, the vine-leaf cut by the scissors of\r\nMonsieur le Charg\xc3\xa9 des Beaux-Arts, the most absurd thing in the world.\r\nIt seems that I was wrong, and that the vine-leaf is one of the most\r\nmeritorious of institutions.\r\n\r\nI have been told, but I refused to believe it, it seemed to me so\r\nextraordinary, that there were people who, when looking at Michael\r\nAngelo\'s fresco of the _Last Judgment_, had seen nothing therein but\r\nthe episode of the lewd priests, and had veiled their faces, crying out\r\nat the abomination of desolation!\r\n\r\nSuch people know nothing of the romance of Rodrigue except the couplet\r\nof the snake.--If there is any nudity in a book or a picture, they go\r\nstraight to it as the swine to the mire, and pay no attention to the\r\nblooming flowers or the golden fruit that hang within reach on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nI confess that I am not virtuous enough for that. Dorine, the\r\nbrazen-faced soubrette, may display before me her swelling bosom, I\r\ncertainly will not draw my handkerchief to cover it so that it cannot\r\nbe seen.--I will look at her bosom as at her face, and if it is fair\r\nand well-shaped I will take pleasure in it.--But I will not touch\r\nElmire\'s dress to see if it is soft, nor will I push her reverently\r\nupon the table as that poor devil of a Tartuffe did.\r\n\r\nThis great affectation of morality that reigns to-day would be very\r\nlaughable if it were not very tiresome.--Every _feuilleton_ becomes a\r\npulpit; every journalist a preacher; only the tonsure and the little\r\nneckband are wanting. The weather is rainy and homiletic; one can\r\ndefend one\'s self against both by going out only in a carriage and\r\nreading Pantagruel between one\'s bottle and one\'s pipe.\r\n\r\nBlessed Jesus! what an outcry! what a frenzy!--Who bit you? who pricked\r\nyou? what the devil\'s the matter with you that you cry so loud, and\r\nwhat has poor vice done to you that you should bear him such a grudge,\r\nhe is such a good fellow, so easy to live with, and asks nothing except\r\nto be allowed to amuse himself and not bore others, if such a thing\r\ncan be? Act with vice like Serre with the gendarme: embrace and have\r\ndone with it all.--Believe me, you will be the better for it.--Eh! _Mon\r\nDieu_! my worthy preachers, what would you do without vice? You would\r\nbe reduced to beggary to-morrow, if the world should become virtuous\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe theatres would be closed to-night.--What would you take for the\r\nsubject of your _feuilleton_?--No more Op\xc3\xa9ra balls to fill your\r\ncolumns,--no more novels to dissect; for balls, novels, plays, are the\r\nreal pomps of Satan, if we are to believe our holy Mother Church.--The\r\nactress would dismiss her protector and could no longer pay you for\r\npuffing her.--Nobody would subscribe to your newspapers; people would\r\nread Saint Augustine, they would go to church, they would tell their\r\nbeads. That would be very praiseworthy, perhaps, but you would gain\r\nnothing by it. If people were virtuous, what would you do with your\r\narticles on the immorality of the age? You see plainly that vice is\r\ngood for something.\r\n\r\nBut it is the fashion nowadays to be virtuous and Christ-like, it is\r\nan attitude people affect; they pose as Saint Jeromes just as they\r\nused to pose as Don Juans; they are pale and wasted, they wear their\r\nhair as the apostles did, they walk with folded hands and eyes glued\r\nto the ground, they assume an expression sugared to perfection; they\r\nhave an open Bible on the mantel, a crucifix and consecrated box-wood\r\nabove their beds; they never swear, they smoke but little, and they\r\nchew almost not at all.--With that they become Christians, they talk\r\nabout the sanctity of art, the lofty mission of the artist, the poesy\r\nof Catholicism, about Monsieur de La Mennais, about the painters of\r\nthe angelic school, about the Council of Trent, about progressive\r\nhumanity, and about a thousand other fine things.--Some infuse a little\r\nrepublicanism into their religion, they are not the least interesting.\r\nThey couple Robespierre and Jesus Christ in the most cheerful way and\r\namalgamate with praiseworthy gravity the Acts of the Apostles and the\r\ndecrees of the _Holy_ Convention--that is the sacramental title; others\r\nadd, for a final ingredient, some Saint-Simonian ideas.--These latter\r\nare complete, they rest upon a square foundation; after them we can\r\nlook for nothing better. Human absurdity can go no farther,--_has ultra\r\nmetas_--etc. They are the Hercules Pillars of Burlesque.\r\n\r\nChristianity is so in vogue by reason of the prevailing hypocrisy, that\r\neven Neo-Christianity enjoys a certain amount of favor. They say that\r\nit can boast thus far one recruit, Monsieur Drouineau included.\r\n\r\nAn extremely interesting variety of the moral journalist, properly\r\nso-called, is the journalist with a female family.\r\n\r\nHe carries his modest sensitiveness to the point of anthropophagy, or\r\nvery nearly that.\r\n\r\nHis mode of procedure, although it seems at the first glance simple and\r\neasy, is none the less clownish and superlatively entertaining, and\r\nin my opinion it deserves to be handed down to posterity--to our last\r\nnephews, as the old fogies of the so-called _Grand Si\xc3\xa8cle_ used to say.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, to pose as a journalist of this variety, you need\r\nsome few preliminary utensils--such as two or three legitimate wives,\r\na few mothers, as many sisters as possible, a full assortment of\r\ndaughters, and cousins innumerable.--The second requisite is a play or\r\nnovel of some sort, a pen, ink, paper, and a printer. Perhaps it would\r\nbe as well to have an idea or two and several subscribers; but you\r\ncan do without them, if you have a large stock of philosophy and the\r\nshareholders\' money.\r\n\r\nWhen you have all these things you can set up as a moral journalist.\r\nThe two following recipes, varied to suit the occasion, will suffice\r\nfor the editorial part.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Models of Virtuous Articles Concerning a First Performance._\r\n\r\n"After the literature of blood, the literature of mud; after the morgue\r\nand the galleys, the alcove and the brothel; after the rags stained\r\nby murder, the rags stained by debauchery; after," etc. (according\r\nto the necessity of the occasion and the available space, you can\r\ncontinue in this vein from six lines to fifty or more),--"this is as\r\nit should be.--This is where neglect of sacred doctrines and romantic\r\nlicentiousness lead: the stage has become a school of prostitution\r\nwhere one dares not venture, save with fear and trembling, with a woman\r\none respects. You come upon the faith of an illustrious name, and you\r\nare obliged to retire at the third act with your young daughter all\r\nconfused and abashed. Your wife hides her blushes behind her fan;\r\nyour sister, your cousin," etc. (The degrees of relationship may be\r\ndiversified at pleasure; it is enough that they be all females.)\r\n\r\nNOTE.--There is one man who has carried morality so far as to say: "I\r\nwill not go to see that play with my mistress."--That man I admire and\r\nlove; I carry him in my heart, as Louis XVIII. carried all France in\r\nhis; for he has conceived the most triumphant, the most monumental,\r\nthe most insane, the most extravagant idea that has passed through the\r\nbrain of man in this blessed nineteenth century, which has seen the\r\nbirth of so many and such amusing ideas.\r\n\r\nThe method of dealing with a book is very expeditious and within the\r\nrange of every intellect:\r\n\r\n"If you choose to read this book, lock yourself securely into your\r\nown room; do not leave it lying on the table. If your wife and your\r\ndaughter should open it, they would be lost.--This is a dangerous\r\nbook, it advises vicious habits. It would have made a great success,\r\nperhaps, in the time of Cr\xc3\xa9billon, in the houses of kept mistresses, at\r\na duchess\'s select supper-parties; but now that morals are purified,\r\nnow that the hand of the people has razed the rotten edifice of\r\naristocracy, and that,--etc., etc.--there must be in every work an\r\nidea--an idea--yes, a moral and religious idea which--an exalted\r\nand profound aim, answering to the needs of humanity; for it is a\r\ndeplorable thing that young writers should sacrifice the most sacred\r\nthings to success, and should expend their talent--a notable talent by\r\nthe way--in lewd descriptions that would make a captain of dragoons\r\nblush."--(The virginity of the captain of dragoons is, after the\r\ndiscovery of America, the most delightful discovery that has been made\r\nfor a long while.)--"The novel we are considering recalls Justine,\r\nthe philosophic Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se, F\xc3\xa9licia, Comp\xc3\xa8re Matthieu, the Contes de\r\nGr\xc3\xa9court, the Priap\xc3\xa9es of the Marquis de Sade." The virtuous journalist\r\nis immensely erudite in the matter of filthy novels;--I am very curious\r\nto know why.\r\n\r\nIt may be obtained at Eug\xc3\xa8ne Renduel\'s, Rue des Grands-Augustins, No.\r\n22. A handsome volume in 8vo. with vignette. Price 7 francs 50 centimes.\r\n\r\n_Ecc\xc3\xb2_,--_ecce_,--see it.\r\n\r\nIt is frightful to think that, through the fault of the newspapers,\r\nthere are many honest manufacturers who have only these two recipes to\r\nlive upon, they and the numerous families they employ.\r\n\r\nApparently I am the most monumentally immoral personage to be found\r\nin Europe or elsewhere; for I can see nothing more licentious in the\r\nnovels and plays of the present day than in the novels and plays of an\r\nearlier time, and I find it difficult to understand why the ears of the\r\ngentlemen of the journals have suddenly become so Jansenically ticklish.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the most innocent newspaper man will dare to say\r\nthat Pigault-Lebrun, Cr\xc3\xa9billon Fils, Louvet, Voisenon, Marmontel, and\r\nall other writers of novels and tales do not surpass in immorality,\r\nsince there is such a thing as immorality, the most dissolute and\r\nlicentious productions of Messieurs Such-an-one and So-and-so, whom I\r\ndo not name out of regard for their modesty.\r\n\r\nOne must be most notoriously false to his convictions not to agree to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nLet not the objection be made that I have cited names little known or\r\nunfavorably known. If I have not mentioned the brilliant, imperishable\r\nnames, it is not because they will not support my assertion with the\r\nweight of their great authority.\r\n\r\nThe novels and tales of Voltaire, aside from the question of merit, are\r\nmost assuredly no more suitable to be given as prizes to little slips\r\nof boarding-school misses than are the immoral tales of our friend the\r\nlycanthropist, or even the moral tales of the insipid Marmontel.\r\n\r\nWhat do we find in the comedies of the great Moli\xc3\xa8re? the sacred\r\ninstitution of marriage--as the catechism and the newspapers call\r\nit--scoffed at and ridiculed in every scene.\r\n\r\nThe husband is old, ugly, and peevish; he wears his wig awry; his coat\r\nis out of fashion; he has a bill-headed cane, a nose smeared with\r\nsnuff, short legs, and a paunch as fat as a budget.--He stammers,\r\nsays nothing but foolish things, and does as many as he says; he sees\r\nnothing, he hears nothing; his wife is kissed before his face, and he\r\nhas no idea what is going on; that state of things lasts until he is\r\nwell and duly proved a cuckold in his own eyes and in the eyes of the\r\nwhole audience, who are mightily edified and applaud in a way to bring\r\nthe walls down.\r\n\r\nThey who applaud the loudest are they who are the most married.\r\n\r\nIn Moli\xc3\xa8re, marriage is named George Dandin or Sganarelle.\r\n\r\nAdultery is Damis or Clitandre; there is no name sweet and charming\r\nenough for it.\r\n\r\nThe adulterer is always young, handsome, well-made, and a marquis\r\nat the very least. He enters from the wings humming the very latest\r\nwaltz; he takes one or two steps on the stage with the most deliberate,\r\nall-conquering air imaginable; he scratches his ear with the pink nail\r\nof his deftly spread little finger; he combs his lovely fair hair with\r\nhis tortoise-shell comb, and arranges his ruffles, which are of great\r\nvolume. His doublet and his hose are almost covered with bows and knots\r\nof ribbon; his neckband is from the best maker; his gloves smell\r\nsweeter than balsam and civet; his plumes cost a louis apiece.\r\n\r\nHow his eye sparkles and his cheek glows! how smiling his mouth! how\r\nwhite his teeth! how soft and well cared for his hand!\r\n\r\nHe speaks, naught issues from his lips save poesy, perfumed gallantries\r\nin the most refined style and with the most charming manner; he has\r\nread the latest novels and knows all about poetry, he is brave, and\r\nquick to draw his sword, he scatters gold with lavish hand.--And so\r\nAng\xc3\xa9lique, Agn\xc3\xa8s, Isabelle, can hardly refrain from leaping on his\r\nneck, well-bred and great ladies though they be; and so the husband is\r\nregularly betrayed in the fifth act, and is very lucky that he was not\r\nin the first.\r\n\r\nThat is how marriage is treated by Moli\xc3\xa8re, one of the loftiest and\r\nmost serious geniuses who ever lived.--Do you think there is anything\r\nstronger in the suits of _Indiana_ and of _Valentine_?\r\n\r\nPaternity is even less respected, if that be possible. Witness Orgon,\r\nG\xc3\xa9ronte, and all the rest of them.\r\n\r\nHow they are robbed by their sons, cheated by their valets! How their\r\navarice, their obstinacy, their idiocy are laid bare, without mercy for\r\ntheir age!--What practical jokes! what mystifications.--How they are\r\ntaken by the shoulder and pushed out of life, poor old fellows, who\r\ntake a long time to die and refuse to give up their money! how much is\r\nsaid about the immortality of parents! what arguments against heredity,\r\nand how much more convincing they are than all this Saint-Simonian\r\ndeclamation!\r\n\r\nA father is an ogre, an Argus, a jailer, a tyrant, something that at\r\nthe best is good for nothing but to delay a marriage for three acts\r\nuntil the final reconciliation.--A father is the ridiculous husband\r\nperfected.--A son is never ridiculous in Moli\xc3\xa8re; for Moli\xc3\xa8re, like all\r\nauthors at all possible epochs, paid his court to the young generation\r\nat the expense of the old.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the Scapins, with their striped cloaks _\xc3\xa0 la Napolitaine_,\r\ntheir caps tilted over their ears, their plumes sweeping the layers of\r\nair,--are not they very pious, very chaste individuals, most worthy of\r\ncanonization?--The galleys are filled with honest folk who have not\r\ndone the fourth part of what they do. The knavery of Trialph is paltry\r\nknavery compared with theirs. And the Lisettes, the Martons, _tudieu_!\r\nwhat hussies!--The girls of the street are far from being as sharp,\r\nas quick at prurient retort as they. How well they understand how to\r\ndeliver a note! what good watch they keep during assignations!--On my\r\nword, they are invaluable girls, serviceable and shrewd advisers.\r\n\r\nIt is a charming company that walks and fidgets through those comedies\r\nand imbroglios.--Duped guardians, cuckold husbands, lewd maids,\r\nkeen-witted valets, young ladies mad with love, dissolute sons,\r\nadulterous wives; are not these quite as bad as the melancholy young\r\nbeaux and poor, weak women, oppressed and impassioned, of the dramas\r\nand novels of the writers in vogue to-day?\r\n\r\nAnd yet the denouements, minus the final blow of the dagger, minus the\r\nregulation cup of poison, are as happy as the time-honored ending of a\r\nfairy tale, and everybody, even the husband, is perfectly satisfied.\r\nIn Moli\xc3\xa8re, virtue is always in disgrace, always being pummelled; it\r\nis virtue that wears horns and turns her back to Mascarille; morality\r\nbarely shows its face once at the end of the play, in the somewhat\r\ncommonplace person of the gendarme Loyal.\r\n\r\nAll this that we have said is not intended to knock a chip off\r\nMoli\xc3\xa8re\'s pedestal; we are not mad enough to attempt to shake that\r\nbronze colossus with our weak arms; we desired simply to show the pious\r\n_feuilletonistes_, who are terrified by recent works and by those of\r\nthe romantic school, that the old classics, whom they urge us every day\r\nto read and imitate, far surpass them in looseness and immorality.\r\n\r\nTo Moli\xc3\xa8re we might easily add Marivaux and La Fontaine, those two\r\nstrongly-contrasted exponents of the French mind, and Regnier and\r\nRabelais and Marot, and many others. But it is not our purpose in\r\nthis place to prepare, from the standpoint of morality, a course in\r\nliterature for the benefit of the virgin minds of the _feuilleton_.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we should not raise such a hubbub for so small a\r\nmatter. Luckily we are not living in the days of the fair Eve, and we\r\ncannot, in good conscience, be as primitive and patriarchal as people\r\nwere in the days of the ark. We are not little girls preparing for our\r\nfirst communion; and when we play crambo, we do not answer _cream-pie_.\r\nWe are passably knowing in our innocence, and our virginity has been\r\non the town for a long while; those are things that one does not have\r\ntwice, and, whatever we may do, we cannot recover them, for there is\r\nnothing in the world that runs faster than a fleeing virginity and a\r\nvanishing illusion.\r\n\r\nAfter all, perhaps there is no great harm in that, and knowledge of\r\neverything is preferable to ignorance of everything. That is a question\r\nthat I leave for those who know more than I, to discuss. The fact\r\nremains that the world has passed the age when one can feign modesty\r\nand chastity, and I consider it too old a greybeard to play the child\r\nand the virgin without making itself ridiculous.\r\n\r\nSince its marriage to civilization, society has lost the right to be\r\nartless and bashful. There are certain blushes that are all right for\r\nthe bridal bed, but can serve no further purpose the next day; for the\r\nyoung wife thinks no more of the maiden, it may be, or if she does\r\nthink of her, it is a most improper thing and gravely endangers her\r\nhusband\'s reputation.\r\n\r\nWhen I chance to read one of the fine sermons that have taken the place\r\nof literary criticism in the public sheets, I sometimes feel great\r\nremorse and dire apprehension, having on my conscience some paltry\r\nequivocal stories, a little too highly spiced, such as a young man of\r\nspirit and animation may have to reproach himself for.\r\n\r\nBeside these Bossuets of the Caf\xc3\xa9 de Paris, these Bourdaloues of the\r\nbalcony at the Op\xc3\xa9ra, these Catos at so much a line, who berate the\r\npresent age in such fine fashion, I esteem myself the most infamous\r\nvillain that ever marred the face of the earth; and yet, God knows,\r\nthe list of my sins, capital as well as venial, with the usual blank\r\nspaces and leads, would barely, even in the hands of the most skilful\r\npublisher, make one or two octavo volumes a day, which is a small\r\nmatter for one who does not claim to be bound for paradise in the other\r\nworld and to win the Monthyon prize or be rose-maiden in this.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when I think that I have met under the table, and elsewhere,\r\ntoo, a considerable number of these dragons of virtue, I return to a\r\nbetter opinion of myself, and I consider that, whatever faults I may\r\nhave, they have another which is, in my eyes, the greatest and worst of\r\nall:--I refer to hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nBy looking carefully one might perhaps find another little vice to\r\nadd; but this is so hideous that I really hardly dare to name it. Come\r\nnearer and I will breathe its name into your ear:--it is envy.\r\n\r\nEnvy, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nIt is envy that crawls and wriggles through all these paternal\r\nhomilies; however careful it may be to hide itself, you can see its\r\nflat little viper\'s head from time to time gleaming above the metaphors\r\nand rhetorical figures; you surprise it licking with its forked tongue\r\nits lips blue with venom, you hear it hissing softly in the shadow of\r\nan insidious epithet.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that it is insufferably conceited to say that any one\r\nenvies you, and that a dandy who boasts of a conquest is almost as\r\nnauseating.--I am not so boastful as to believe that I have enemies or\r\nenvious detractors; that is a piece of good fortune that is not given\r\nto everybody, and I probably shall not enjoy it for a long time; so\r\nI will speak freely and without reservation as one who is perfectly\r\ndisinterested in the matter.\r\n\r\nAn unquestionable fact, and easy of demonstration to those who may\r\ndoubt it, is the natural antipathy of the critic to the poet--of him\r\nwho does nothing to him who does something--of the drone to the bee--of\r\nthe gelding to the stallion.\r\n\r\nYou do not become a critic until the fact is established to your\r\nown satisfaction that you cannot be a poet. Before descending to\r\nthe pitiful r\xc3\xb4le of watching cloaks and counting strokes like a\r\nbilliard-marker or a tennis-court attendant, you have long courted the\r\nMuse, you have tried to seduce her; but you have not sufficient vigor\r\nfor that; your breath has failed you and you have fallen back, pale and\r\nbroken-winded, to the foot of the sacred mountain.\r\n\r\nI can conceive that antipathy. It is painful to see another take his\r\nseat at the banquet to which you are not invited and lie with the woman\r\nwho would have none of you. I pity with all my heart the poor eunuch\r\nwho is compelled to assist at the delights of the Great Turk.\r\n\r\nHe is admitted to the most secret recesses of the Oda; he escorts the\r\nsultanas to the bath; he sees their lovely bodies gleaming in the\r\nsilvery water of the great reservoirs, shedding streams of pearls\r\nand smoother than agate; the most hidden charms are disclosed to him\r\nunveiled. No one is embarrassed by his presence.--He is a eunuch.--The\r\nsultan caresses his favorite before him and kisses her on her\r\npomegranate mouth.--In very truth his is a terribly false position and\r\nhe must be sadly embarrassed to keep himself in countenance.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the critic who sees the poet walking in the garden\r\nof poesy with its nine fair odalisques, and disporting himself\r\nindolently in the shade of tall green laurels. It is very hard for him\r\nnot to pick up stones in the road to throw at him and wound him over\r\nthe wall, if he is skilful enough to do it.\r\n\r\nThe critic who has produced nothing of his own is a coward; he is like\r\nan abb\xc3\xa9 paying court to a layman\'s wife: the layman cannot pay him back\r\nin his own coin or fight with him.\r\n\r\nI think that an account of the different methods of depreciating any\r\nsort of work, resorted to during the last month, would be at least\r\nas interesting as the story of Tiglath-Pileser, or of Gemmagog, who\r\ninvented peaked shoes.\r\n\r\nThere would be enough matter to fill fifteen or sixteen folio volumes,\r\nbut we will have pity on the reader and confine ourselves to a few\r\nlines--a favor for which we demand more than everlasting gratitude.--In\r\na very remote age, lost in the darkness of time--it was fully three\r\nweeks ago--the romance of the Middle Ages flourished principally in\r\nParis and the suburbs. The coat of arms was held in high esteem;\r\n_coiffures \xc3\xa0 la Hennin_ were not despised and party-colored trousers\r\nwere thought well of; the dagger was priceless; the peaked shoe was\r\nadored as a fetich.--There was nothing but ogive windows, turrets,\r\ncolonnettes, stained glass, cathedrals, and fortified ch\xc3\xa2teaux;--the\r\ncharacters were all _damoiselles_ and _damoiseaux_, pages and\r\nvarlets, beggars and swash-bucklers, gallant knights and ferocious\r\ncastellans;--all of which were more innocent certainly than innocent\r\ngames, and did absolutely no harm to anybody.\r\n\r\nThe critic did not wait for the second romance before beginning his\r\nwork of depreciation: as soon as the first appeared, he enveloped\r\nhimself in his robe of camel\'s hair, and sprinkled a bushel of ashes on\r\nhis head; then, in his loud, wailing voice, he began to cry:\r\n\r\n"More Middle Ages, nothing but the Middle Ages! who will deliver me\r\nfrom the Middle Ages, from the Middle Ages which are not the Middle\r\nAges?--Paste-board and terra-cotta Middle Ages, which have nothing of\r\nthe Middle Ages save the name!--Oh! these iron barons, in their iron\r\narmor, with iron hearts in their iron breasts! Oh! the cathedrals with\r\ntheir rose-work always in bloom and their stained glass in flower,\r\nwith their lace-work of granite, with their open-work trefoils, their\r\ntoothed gables, their chasubles of stone embroidered like a bride\'s\r\nveil, with their tapers, their psalms, their glittering priests, with\r\ntheir people on their knees, their rumbling organ, and their angels\r\nsoaring aloft and flapping their wings under the arches!--how they have\r\nspoiled my Middle Ages, my refined, brightly-colored Middle Ages!--how\r\nthey have blotted it from sight under a layer of coarse plaster!--what\r\ndiscordant colors!--Ah! ignorant daubers, who fancy you have created\r\nan effect by splashing red upon blue, white upon black, and green\r\nupon yellow, you have seen only the outer shell of the Middle Ages,\r\nyou have not divined the true meaning of the Middle Ages, the blood\r\ndoes not circulate beneath the skin in which you have clothed your\r\nphantoms, there is no heart in your steel corselets, there are no legs\r\nin your tricot trousers, no stomach or breast behind your emblazoned\r\nskirts; they are clothes that have the shape of men and that is\r\nall.--So, down with the Middle Ages as they are presented to us by the\r\n_fabricators_"--the great word is out, the _fabricators_!--"The Middle\r\nAges meet no need of the present day, we must have something else."\r\n\r\nAnd the public, seeing how the _feuilletonistes_ snarled at the Middle\r\nAges, was seized with an ardent passion for the Middle Ages, which\r\nthey claim to have killed at a single blow. The Middle Ages invaded\r\neverything, assisted by the obstruction of the newspapers:--dramas,\r\nmelodramas, novels, tales, poetry--there were even Middle-Age\r\nvaudevilles, and Momus recited feudal mummeries.\r\n\r\nBeside the romance of the Middle Ages flourished the carrion romance,\r\na very pleasing variety, which nervous _petites-ma\xc3\xaetresses_ and blas\xc3\xa9\r\ncooks consumed in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThe _feuilletonistes_ speedily came flocking to the stench, like\r\ncrows to the carrion, and they tore with the beaks of their pens and\r\ninhumanly put to death that poor species of novel, which asked nothing\r\nmore than to be allowed to prosper and putrefy in peace on the greasy\r\nshelves of the book-stalls. What did they not say? what did they not\r\nwrite?--Literature of the morgue or the galleys, an executioner\'s\r\nnightmare, hallucination of a drunken butcher, or a convict-keeper with\r\nthe jail-fever! They benignly gave us to understand that the authors\r\nwere assassins and vampires, that they had contracted the vicious habit\r\nof killing their fathers and mothers, that they drank blood from human\r\nskulls, that they used the bones of the legs for forks and cut their\r\nbread with a guillotine.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they knew better than any one, from having frequently\r\nbreakfasted with them, that the authors of those charming slaughters\r\nwere excellent young men of family, very easy-going and in the best\r\nsociety, white-gloved and fashionably near-sighted,--with a decided\r\npreference for beefsteak over human cutlets, and more accustomed\r\nto drink Bordeaux wine than the blood of young girls or new-born\r\nchildren.--From having seen and touched their manuscripts, they knew\r\nperfectly well that they were written with ink of great virtue upon\r\nEnglish paper, and not with blood from the guillotine upon the skin of\r\na Christian flayed alive.\r\n\r\nBut whatever they might say or do, the age was after carrion, and the\r\ncharnel-house suited them better than the boudoir; the reader would\r\nbite at no hook that was not baited with a little body already turning\r\nblue.--A state of things easily conceived; put a rose at the end of\r\nyour line and the spiders will have time to spin their webs in the\r\ncrook of your elbow before you catch the tiniest minnow; put on a worm\r\nor a piece of rank cheese, and carp, barbel, perch, eels, will all leap\r\nthree feet out of water to snap at it.--Men are not so different from\r\nfish as people generally seem to believe.\r\n\r\nOne would have said that the newspaper men had become Quakers,\r\nBrahmins, or Pythagoreans, or bulls, they had been suddenly seized with\r\nsuch a horror of red and of blood.--Never had they been known to be\r\nin such a soft and melting mood;--it was cream and buttermilk.--They\r\nadmitted the existence of only two colors, sky-blue and apple-green.\r\nPink was only tolerated, and if the public would have allowed them to\r\ndo as they chose, they would have led it to the banks of the Lignon to\r\nfeed on spinach beside the sheep of Amaryllis. They had changed their\r\nblack frock-coats for the dove-colored jacket of Celadon or Silvander,\r\nand surrounded their goose-feathers with clusters of roses and ribbons\r\nafter the style of a shepherd\'s crook. They let their hair float in the\r\nwind like a child\'s, and had made themselves virgins according to the\r\nrecipe of Marion Delorme, and about as successfully as she.\r\n\r\nThey applied to literature the article in the Decalogue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thou shalt not kill._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe least little dramatic murder was no longer permissible, and the\r\nfifth act had become an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThey considered the poniard extravagant, poison monstrous, the axe\r\nhorrible beyond words. They would have liked dramatic heroes to live\r\nto the age of Melchisedec; and yet it has been a recognized fact, from\r\ntime immemorial, that the object of every tragedy is to have a poor\r\ndevil of a great man, who cannot help himself, murdered in the last\r\nact, just as the object of every comedy is to join in matrimony two\r\nidiots of _jeunes premiers_ of about sixty years each.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that I threw into the fire--after having taken\r\na duplicate, as almost always happens--two superb and magnificent\r\nMiddle-Age dramas, one in verse, the other in prose, in which the\r\nheroes were quartered and boiled on the stage, which would have been\r\nvery entertaining and decidedly unusual.\r\n\r\nTo conform to their ideas, I have since composed an antique tragedy in\r\nfive acts called _H\xc3\xa9liogabale_, the hero of which throws himself into\r\nthe privy, an extremely novel situation and one that has the merit of\r\nintroducing a bit of scenery not yet seen on the stage.--I have also\r\nwritten a modern drama, very much superior to _Antoni,--Arthur,_ or\r\n_L\'Homme Fatal,_ where the providential idea arrives in the shape of\r\na Strasbourg p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 de foie gras, which the hero eats to the last crumb\r\nafter committing various rapes, and that, combined with his remorse,\r\nbrings on a frightful attack of indigestion of which he dies.--A moral\r\nending, if ever there was one, which proves that _God is just_, and\r\nthat vice is always punished and virtue rewarded.\r\n\r\nAs for the monstrosity species, you know how they have dealt with that,\r\nhow they have abused Han d\'Islande the cannibal, Habibrah the obi,\r\nQuasimodo the bell-ringer, and Triboulet, who is only a hunch-back--all\r\nthat family so strangely swarming--all those gigantic deformities whom\r\nmy dear neighbor sends crawling and leaping through the virgin forests\r\nand the cathedrals of his romances. Neither the great strokes _\xc3\xa0 la_\r\nMichael Angelo, nor the curiosities worthy of Callot, nor the effects\r\nof light and shade after the fashion of Goya, could find favor before\r\nthem; they sent him back to his odes when he wrote novels, to his\r\nnovels when he wrote dramas: the ordinary tactics of journalists who\r\nalways praise what you have done at the expense of what you are doing.\r\nA fortunate man, however, is he who is acknowledged to be superior,\r\neven by the _feuilletonistes_, in all his works,--except, of course,\r\nthe particular one with whom they are dealing,--and who need only write\r\na theological treatise or a manual of cooking to have his plays admired.\r\n\r\nConcerning the romance of the heart, the ardent, impassioned romance,\r\nwhose father is Werther the German, and its mother Manon Lescaut\r\nthe French-woman, we had a few words to say, at the beginning of\r\nthis preface, of the moral scurf that has fastened itself upon it in\r\ndesperation, on the pretext of religion and good morals. The critical\r\nlouse is like the body-louse that deserts the dead body for the living.\r\nFrom the corpse of the Middle Ages the critics have passed on to the\r\nliving body of this age, whose skin is tough and hard and might well\r\nbreak their teeth.\r\n\r\nWe think, notwithstanding a deep respect for the modern apostles,\r\nthat the authors of these so-called immoral novels, without being\r\nso thoroughly married as the virtuous journalist, generally have a\r\nmother, and that several of them have sisters and are provided with\r\nan abundance of female relations; but their mothers and sisters do\r\nnot read novels, even immoral novels; they sew and embroider and look\r\nafter the house-keeping.--Their stockings, as Monsieur Planard would\r\nsay, are--entirely white: you can look at them on their legs--they are\r\nnot _blue_, and excellent Chrysale, who hated learned women so, would\r\nsuggest them as models to the skilled Philaminte.\r\n\r\nAs for these gentlemen\'s _wives_, as they have so many of them,\r\nhowever spotless their husbands may be, it seems to my simple mind\r\nthat there are certain things they ought to know.--Indeed, it may well\r\nbe that their husbands have never shown them anything. In that case I\r\nunderstand that they are bent upon keeping them in that useful state of\r\nblessed ignorance. God is great and Mohammed is his prophet!--Women are\r\ninquisitive creatures; may Heaven and morality grant that they gratify\r\ntheir curiosity in a more legitimate way than that adopted by their\r\ngrandmother Eve, and do not go putting questions to the serpent!\r\n\r\nAs for their daughters, if they have been at boarding-school, I fail to\r\nsee what they can learn from these books.\r\n\r\nIt is as absurd to say that a man is a drunkard because he describes\r\nan orgy, or a debauchee because he narrates a debauch, as to claim\r\nthat a man is virtuous because he has written a book on morals; we\r\nsee the contrary every day. It is the character that speaks, not the\r\nauthor; his hero may be an atheist, that does not mean that he is an\r\natheist; he represents brigands as acting and talking like brigands,\r\nbut that does not make him a brigand. On that theory we should have\r\nto guillotine Shakespeare, Corneille, and all the writers of tragedy;\r\nthey have committed more murders than Mandrin and Cartouche; we have\r\nnot done it, however, and, indeed, I do not believe that we shall\r\ndo it for a long time to come, however virtuous and moral criticism\r\nmay become. It is one of the manias of these little shallow-brained\r\nscribblers always to substitute the author for the work, and to resort\r\nto personalities, in order to give some paltry scandalous interest to\r\ntheir miserable rhapsodies, which they are well aware that nobody would\r\nread if they contained only their individual opinions.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly imagine the tendency of all this wailing, or what good\r\npurpose all this indignation and snarling can serve--or who impels\r\nthese Messieurs Geoffroy on a small scale to set themselves up as the\r\nDon Quixotes of morality, and, like genuine literary policemen, to lay\r\nhands upon and club, in the name of virtue, every idea that appears in\r\na book with its mob-cap awry or its petticoats raised a little too\r\nhigh.--It is very strange.\r\n\r\nWhatever they may say, the present age is immoral,--if the word means\r\nanything, which we much doubt,--and we require no other proof of it\r\nthan the quantity of immoral books it produces and the success they\r\nmeet with.--Books follow morals, morals do not follow books.--The\r\nRegency produced Cr\xc3\xa9billon, not Cr\xc3\xa9billon the Regency. Boucher\'s\r\nlittle shepherdesses were painted and immodest because the little\r\nmarchionesses of the day were painted and immodest.--Pictures are\r\npainted after models, not models after pictures. Somebody or other\r\nhas said somewhere or other that literature and the arts have a\r\ngreat influence on morals. Whoever he is, he is unquestionably a\r\ngreat fool.--It is as if some one should say: "Green peas make the\r\nspringtime grow;" on the other hand, green peas grow because it is\r\nspring, and cherries because it is summer. The trees bear fruit, the\r\nfruit assuredly does not bear the trees--the law is everlasting and\r\ninvariable in its variations; the centuries succeed one another and\r\neach bears its fruit, which differs from that of the preceding century;\r\nbooks are the fruit of morals.\r\n\r\nBeside the moral journalists, under this shower of homilies, as if it\r\nwere a summer shower in a park, there has arisen, between the boards of\r\nthe Saint-Simonian stage, a school of little mushrooms of a curious new\r\nvariety, of which we propose to give the natural history.\r\n\r\nThey are the utilitarian critics,--poor fellows whose noses were so\r\nshort that they would not hold spectacles, and who could not see to the\r\nend of their noses.\r\n\r\nWhen an author tossed upon their desk a volume of any sort,--novel\r\nor poetry,--these gentry would lean back nonchalantly in their\r\nchairs, balance them on their hind legs, sway back and forth, puffing\r\nthemselves out with a knowing air, and say:\r\n\r\n"What purpose does this book serve? How can it be applied to securing\r\nthe moral and spiritual well-being of the most numerous and poorest\r\nclass? What! not a word of the needs of society, nothing civilizing\r\nand progressive! How, instead of dealing synthetically with the great\r\nproblems of humanity, and following, through the events of history,\r\nthe phases of the regenerating, providential idea, can you waste\r\ntime writing poetry and novels which lead to nothing, and which do\r\nnothing to help the generation forward in the pathway of the future?\r\nHow can you concern yourself about form and style and rhythm, in\r\npresence of such grave interests?--What do we care for rhythm and\r\nstyle and form? that is all right in its place!" (Poor foxes, they\r\nare too green!)--"Society is suffering, it has a terrible gnawing at\r\nthe vitals;" (translate: no one will subscribe to the utilitarian\r\npapers.) "It is for the poet to seek the cause of the trouble and cure\r\nit. He will find a way by sympathizing heart and soul with humanity;"\r\n(philanthropic poets! that would be something rare and charming.) "We\r\nawait the coming of that poet, we pray for his coming with all our\r\nhearts. When he appears, his will be the acclamations of the multitude,\r\nhis the palm-leaves, his the wreaths, his the Prytaneum."\r\n\r\nVery fine; but as we desire the reader to stay awake to the end of this\r\nblessed preface, we will not continue this very close imitation of the\r\nutilitarian style, which, by its nature, is unusually soporific, and\r\nmight advantageously replace laudanum and the discourses of the Academy.\r\n\r\nNo, fools, no, cretins and goitrous creatures that you are, a book does\r\nnot make gelatine soup;--a novel is not a pair of seamless boots; a\r\nsonnet is not a syringe with a continuous stream; a drama is not a\r\nrailroad,--all essentially civilizing things and tending to assist\r\nhumanity along the pathway of progress.\r\n\r\nBy the bowels of all the popes, past, present, and to come, no, two\r\nhundred thousand times no.\r\n\r\nYou cannot make a nightcap out of a metonymy, or wear comparisons by\r\nway of slippers; you cannot use antithesis as an umbrella; unluckily\r\nwe have not the secret of clapping a few variegated rhymes upon the\r\nstomach as we put on a waistcoat. I have a firm conviction that the ode\r\nis a garment too light for winter, and that one would be no more warmly\r\nclad with the strophe, the antistrophe, and the epode, than the wife of\r\nthe cynic who was contented to have only her virtue as a chemise and\r\nwent about as naked as your hand, as history tells us.\r\n\r\nThe famous Monsieur de la Calpren\xc3\xa8de once had a coat, and when\r\nsome one asked what kind of cloth it was made of, he answered:\r\nSilvandre.--_Silvandre_ was a play of his that had just been produced\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nSuch arguments make one raise his shoulders above his head, higher than\r\nthe Duke of Gloucester\'s.\r\n\r\nPeople who claim to be economists and who wish to rebuild society from\r\ntop to bottom, seriously put forward such trash.\r\n\r\nA novel may be useful in two ways:--one material, the other spiritual,\r\nif we may use such an expression with reference to a novel.--Its\r\nmaterial utility consists, first, of the few thousand francs that go\r\ninto the author\'s pocket, and ballast him so that neither the devil nor\r\nthe wind can whisk him away; to the publisher it is a noble race-horse\r\nwho stamps and rears with his cabriolet of ebony and steel, as Figaro\r\nsays; to the paper manufacturer, one more factory on some stream and\r\noften the means of spoiling a fine site; to the printers, divers\r\nhogsheads of logwood to put their windpipes in shape once a week; to\r\nthe circulating libraries, piles of big sous covered with proletariat\r\nverdigris and a quantity of grease, which if it were carefully\r\ncollected and utilized would render the whale-fishery useless.--The\r\nspiritual utility consists in this: that, while you are reading novels,\r\nyou fall asleep, and you are not reading utilitarian, virtuous, and\r\nprogressive newspapers, or other similar indigestible, stupefying drugs.\r\n\r\nLet any one say after this that novels do not assist civilization.--I\r\nwill say nothing of the tobacco agents, grocers, and dealers in fried\r\npotatoes, who have a very great interest in this branch of literature,\r\nthe paper used therein being, as a general rule, of a superior quality\r\nto that used by the newspapers.\r\n\r\nVerily it is enough to make one split one\'s sides with laughter to hear\r\nmessieurs the republican or Saint-Simonian utilitarians hold forth.--In\r\nthe first place, I should be glad to know the exact meaning of that\r\ngreat lubberly substantive with which they daily lard the empty void\r\nof their columns, and which serves them as a sort of shibboleth and\r\nsacramental term:--Utility; what is the word, and to what is it applied?\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of utilities, and the meaning of the word is always\r\nrelative. What is useful for one is not for another. You are a cobbler,\r\nI am a poet.--It is useful for me to have my first line rhyme with my\r\nsecond.--A dictionary of rhymes is of great utility to me; you have\r\nno use for it in cobbling an old pair of boots, and it is fair to say\r\nthat a cobbler\'s knife would be of no great use to me in writing an\r\node.--Now, you will remark that a cobbler is much above a poet, and\r\nthat we could get along better without the latter than without the\r\nformer. Without undertaking to cry down the illustrious profession of\r\ncobbler, which I honor equally with the profession of constitutional\r\nmonarch, I will humbly confess that I should prefer to have my shoe\r\ndown at heel rather than to have my lines haltingly rhymed, and that\r\nI should be more willing to go without boots than without poems. As I\r\nrarely go out, and walk more readily on my head than on my feet, I wear\r\nout fewer shoes than a virtuous republican who does nothing but run\r\nfrom one government department to another trying to induce somebody to\r\ntoss him an office.\r\n\r\nI know that there are those who prefer windmills to churches, and the\r\nbread that feeds the body to that that feeds the soul. To them I have\r\nnothing to say. They deserve to be economists in this world and also in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIs there anything absolutely useful on this earth and in this life that\r\nwe live? In the first place, there is very little use in one being\r\non the earth and living. I challenge the most erudite of the band\r\nto say of what use we are, unless it be to subscribe neither to the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ nor to a journal of any sort.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the utility of our existence being admitted _a priori_, what\r\nare the really useful things to maintain it? A plate of soup and a bit\r\nof bread twice a day are all that we need to fill the stomach, in the\r\nstrict acceptation of the word. The man for whom a coffin six feet by\r\ntwo will be enough and more than enough after his death, does not need\r\nmuch more space during his life. A hollow cube, seven or eight feet\r\nbroad, long and deep, with a hole to breathe through, a single cell in\r\nthe hive, is all that he needs to lodge him and to keep the rain from\r\nfalling on his back. A quilt, rolled properly about his body, will\r\nprotect him from the cold as well as, yes, better than, Staub\'s most\r\nstylish and elegant frock-coat.\r\n\r\nWith that a man can exist, theoretically. They say that one can live\r\non twenty-five sous a day; but to keep from dying is not living; and I\r\ncannot see wherein a city organized on utilitarian principles would be\r\nmore agreeable to live in than P\xc3\xa8re La Chaise.\r\n\r\nNothing beautiful is indispensable to life.--If flowers should be\r\nsuppressed, the world would not suffer materially; and yet who could\r\nwish that there were no flowers? I would rather give up potatoes than\r\nroses, and I do not believe there is more than one utilitarian in the\r\nworld capable of digging up a bed of tulips to make room for cabbages.\r\n\r\nWhat good purpose does female beauty serve? Provided that a woman is\r\nwell-developed physically, in a condition to receive a man and to\r\nproduce children, she will always be good enough for the economist.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of music? or painting? Who would be foolish enough to\r\nprefer Mozart to Monsieur Carrel, Michael Angelo to the inventor of\r\nwhite mustard?\r\n\r\nNothing is really beautiful but that which cannot be made use of;\r\neverything that is useful is ugly, for it is the expression of some\r\nneed, and the needs of man are vile and disgusting, like his poor, weak\r\nnature.--The most useful part of a house is the privy.\r\n\r\nI myself, with due respect to those gentlemen, am one of those to whom\r\nsuperfluities are necessaries--and my liking for people and things is\r\nin inverse ratio to the services they render me. I prefer a Chinese\r\nvase, covered with dragons and mandarins, which is of no use to me\r\nat all, to a certain other vase, which is useful to me; and that one\r\nof my talents which I prize most highly is my inability to guess\r\nriddles and charades. I would very willingly renounce my privileges\r\nas a Frenchman and a citizen to see an authentic painting by Raphael,\r\nor a beautiful nude woman: the Princess Borghese, for instance, when\r\nshe posed for Canova, or Julia Grisi when she was in her bath. For\r\nmy part I would gladly consent to the return of that cannibal of\r\na Charles X., if he would bring me, from his castle in Bohemia, a\r\nhamper of Tokay or Johannisberg, and I would agree that the suffrage\r\nlaws were broad enough, if some of the streets were more so and other\r\nthings less so.--Although I am not a born _dilettante,_ I prefer the\r\nnoise of squeaking fiddles and bass drums to that of Monsieur le\r\nPr\xc3\xa9sident\'s bell. I would sell my trousers to buy a ring and my daily\r\nbread for sweetmeats.--The most becoming occupation for a polished man\r\nis, it seems to me, to do nothing, or to smoke his pipe or his cigar\r\nanalytically. I also have a high regard for those who play at skittles\r\nand for those who write good poetry. You see that my principles are\r\nvery far from being utilitarian, and that I shall never become editor\r\nof a virtuous newspaper unless I am converted, which would be droll\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nInstead of awarding a Monthyon prize as a reward of virtue, I would\r\nprefer to give, like Sardanapalus, that great philosopher who has been\r\nso misunderstood, a handsome premium to the man who should invent a new\r\nform of pleasure; for enjoyment seems to me the true aim of life and\r\nthe only useful thing in the world. God has so willed it, for it was He\r\nwho made women, perfumes, light, lovely flowers, good wines, prancing\r\nhorses, greyhounds, and Angora cats; nor did he say to his angels:\r\n"Be virtuous," but: "Love;" and he gave us a mouth, more sensitive\r\nthan the rest of the skin, with which to kiss women, eyes uplifted to\r\nsee the light, a subtle sense of smell to inhale the soul of flowers,\r\nwell-knit thighs to press the sides of stallions and fly swifter than\r\nthought without railroad or steamboat, delicate hands with which to\r\ncaress the long head of the greyhound, the velvety back of the cat,\r\nand the gleaming shoulders of creatures of doubtful virtue; in a word,\r\nhe bestowed only upon us the threefold, glorious privilege of drinking\r\nwithout being thirsty, of striking a light, and of making love at all\r\nseasons, which distinguishes us from the brute much more than the\r\ncustom of reading newspapers and drawing maps.\r\n\r\n_Mon Dieu_! what an idiotic thing is this alleged perfectibility of the\r\nhuman race that is being dinned into our ears! One would say in truth\r\nthat man is a machine susceptible of improvements, and that the more\r\ncareful adjustment of a wheel, a counterpoise more conveniently placed,\r\nmight make it work more smoothly and more handily. When they have\r\nsucceeded in giving man a double stomach, so that he can chew his cud\r\nlike an ox, and eyes in the back of his head, like Janus, so that he\r\ncan see those who stick out their tongues at him behind his back, and\r\ncontemplate his _unworthiness_ in a less uncomfortable position than\r\nthat of the Venus Callipyges at Athens, and in planting wings on his\r\nshoulder blades so that he will not be obliged to pay six sous to ride\r\nin an omnibus; when they have given him a new organ, well and good:\r\nthen the word _perfectibility_ will begin to mean something.\r\n\r\nSince all these fine ameliorations, what has been done that was not\r\ndone as well and better before the deluge?\r\n\r\nHave we succeeded in drinking more than they drank in the days of\r\nignorance and barbarism--old style? Alexander, the doubtful friend\r\nof the fair Heph\xc3\xa6stion, was no small drinker, although there was no\r\n_Journal des Connaissances Utiles_ in his day, and I am unable to\r\nconceive how any utilitarian, unless he should become o\xc3\xafnopic and\r\nmore puffed out than the younger Lepeintre or a hippopotamus, could\r\ndrain the great beaker which he called Hercules\' cup. The Mar\xc3\xa9chal\r\nde Bassompierre, who emptied his long boot to the health of the\r\nThirteen Cantons, seems to me a singularly estimable personage in his\r\nway and very hard to improve upon. What economist will enlarge our\r\nstomachs so that they will hold as many beefsteaks as the late Milo\r\nof Crotona, who ate an ox? The bill of fare at V\xc3\xa9four\'s Caf\xc3\xa9 Anglais,\r\nor at any other culinary celebrity\'s that you choose, seems to me very\r\nill-supplied and commonplace compared to the menu of Trimalcion\'s\r\ndinner.--At whose table in these days are a sow and her twelve\r\nshoats served on a single platter? Who has eaten mur\xc3\xa6na and lampreys\r\nfattened on man? Do you really think that Brillat-Savarin has improved\r\nupon Apicius? Could Vitellius\'s big tripe-man find at Chevet\'s the\r\nwherewithal to fill his famous Minerva\'s shield with pheasants\' and\r\npeacocks\' brains, tongues of flamingoes and scarus livers?--The oysters\r\nyou eat at the Rocher de Cancale are such a great delicacy compared\r\nwith the oysters of Lucrin, for which a lake was made expressly.--The\r\nlittle establishments in the suburbs kept by the marquises of the\r\nRegency were wretched little boxes, if we compare them with the villas\r\nof the Roman patricians at Bai\xc3\xa6, Capri, and Tibur. The Cyclopean\r\nsplendor of the great voluptuaries who erected everlasting monuments\r\nfor a day\'s pleasure should cause us to fall flat on our faces before\r\nthe genius of antiquity and erase forever from our dictionaries the\r\nword _perfectibility._\r\n\r\nHas a new capital crime been invented? Unfortunately there are only\r\nseven of them as before, the number of the just man\'s backslidings for\r\none day, which is very moderate.--Indeed, I do not think that after a\r\ncentury of progress, at the rate we are travelling, any lover would be\r\ncapable of renewing the thirteenth labor of Hercules.--Can a man be\r\nagreeable to his divinity a single time oftener than in the days of\r\nSolomon? Many very illustrious scholars and very respectable ladies\r\nanswer that question in the negative, and aver that amiability is on\r\nthe wane. Very good! if that is so, why do you talk of progress?--I\r\nknow that you will tell me that there is an Upper Chamber and a Lower\r\nChamber, that you hope that everybody will soon be an elector and the\r\nnumber of representatives doubled or trebled. Do you think that there\r\nare not enough mistakes in grammar made in the national tribune as it\r\nis, and that the deputies are not numerous enough for the vile work\r\nthey have to do? I can hardly understand the utility of quartering\r\ntwo or three hundred provincials in a wooden barrack, with a ceiling\r\npainted by Monsieur Fragonard, there to botch and bungle nobody knows\r\nhow many absurd or atrocious little laws.--What difference does it\r\nmake whether it is a sabre, a holy-water sprinkler, or an umbrella\r\nthat governs us?--It is a club all the same, and I am amazed that\r\nprogressive men should dispute as to the kind of club that is to make\r\ntheir shoulders tingle, when it would be much more progressive and less\r\nexpensive to break it and throw the pieces to all the devils.\r\n\r\nThe only one of you who has any common sense is a madman, a great\r\ngenius, an imbecile, a divine poet far above Lamartine, Hugo, and\r\nByron; it is Charles Fourrier, the phalansterian, who is all that in\r\nhis single person: he alone is logical and has the courage to carry\r\nhis theory through to its inevitable consequence.--He asserts, without\r\nhesitation, that man will soon have a tail fifteen feet long with an\r\neye at the end of it; that surely is progress and will permit us to\r\ndo a thousand fine things we could not do before, such as killing\r\nelephants without striking a blow, balancing ourselves on trees without\r\nswings, as handily as the most expert ape, doing without sunshade or\r\numbrella by raising the tail above the head like a plume, as squirrels\r\ndo, who get along very well without umbrellas; and other prerogatives\r\ntoo numerous to mention. Several phalansterians claim that they already\r\nhave a little tail that asks nothing better than to grow longer, if\r\nonly God gives them length of days.\r\n\r\nCharles Fourrier has invented as many species of animals as George\r\nCuvier, the great naturalist. He invented horses that will be thrice\r\nthe size of elephants, dogs as large as tigers, fish capable of feeding\r\nmore people than the three small fishes of the Saviour, which the\r\nincredulous Voltaireans believe were _poissons d\'Avril_,[1] and I the\r\ntext of a noble parable. He has built cities beside which Rome, Tyre,\r\nand Babylon are simply mole-hills; he has piled Babels one upon another\r\nand built spiral stairways ascending among the clouds to a greater\r\nheight than all those in John Martinn\'s engravings; he has conceived I\r\ncannot say how many orders of architecture and new sauces; he has drawn\r\na plan for a theatre which would seem immense even to Romans of the\r\nEmpire, and prepared a dinner menu that Lucius or Nomentanus might have\r\ndeemed sufficient for a dinner to their friends; he promises to create\r\nnew forms of pleasure and to develop the organs and the senses; he is\r\nto make women fairer and more voluptuous, men more robust and sturdy;\r\nhe guarantees you children and proposes to reduce the population of the\r\nworld so that every one will be in easy circumstances; which is more\r\nreasonable than to urge paupers to make other paupers, with the idea of\r\nshooting them down in the streets when they breed too fast and sending\r\nthem bullets instead of bread.\r\n\r\nProgress is possible in no other way.--All the rest is bitter mockery,\r\nbuffoonery without wit, which is not even calculated to deceive\r\ngullible fools.\r\n\r\nThe phalanstery is really a step in advance of the abbey of Th\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8me,\r\nand definitely relegates the earthly paradise to the ranks of those\r\nthings that are altogether superannuated and old-fashioned. The\r\nThousand and One Nights and Madame d\'Aulnay\'s Tales alone can contend\r\nsuccessfully with the phalanstery. What fertility! what invention!\r\nThere is material there from which to supply marvels for three thousand\r\ncartloads of romantic or classic poems; and our versifiers, whether\r\nacademicians or not, are paltry inventors compared to Monsieur Charles\r\nFourrier, the inventor of startling attractions.--This idea of making\r\nuse of impulses which people have hitherto sought to repress, is most\r\nassuredly a lofty and powerful idea.\r\n\r\nAh! you say that we are making progress!--Suppose that a volcano\r\nshould open its maw to-morrow at Montmartre, and should make a\r\nwinding-sheet of ashes and a tomb of lava for Paris, as Vesuvius once\r\ndid for Stabia, Pompeii, and Herculaneum, and that, some thousand\r\nyears hence, the antiquaries of that day should make excavations and\r\nexhume the corpse of the dead city, tell me what monument would remain\r\nstanding to bear witness to the splendor of the mighty entombed, the\r\nGothic Notre-Dame?--They would form truly a fine idea of our artistic\r\ndevelopment when they cleared away the rubbish from the Tuileries,\r\nredecorated by Monsieur Fontaine! The statues on Pont Louis XV. would\r\nlook splendid in the museums of those days. And were it not for the\r\npictures of the ancient schools and the statues of antiquity or the\r\nRenaissance crowded together in the gallery of the Louvre, that long\r\nshapeless conduit; were it not for the ceiling by Ingres, which would\r\nshow that Paris was not a Barbary camp or a village of Welches or\r\nTopinamboux, the things that would be unearthed from the ruins would\r\nbe very interesting.--Short swords carried by National Guardsmen,\r\nfiremen\'s helmets, coins struck from pyriform dies, that is the kind\r\nof thing they would find instead of the beautiful, curiously-carved\r\nweapons that the Middle Ages left in the recesses of their towers and\r\nruined tombs, the medallions that fill the Etruscan vases and pave the\r\ncellars of all Roman buildings. As for our wretched veneered furniture,\r\nall the cheap boxes, naked and ugly and shabby, that we call commodes\r\nor secretaries, and all our shapeless, fragile utensils,--I trust that\r\ntime would have been compassionate enough to destroy the last vestige\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nOnce, this whim of erecting a magnificent, pretentious monument took\r\npossession of us. In the first place we were obliged to borrow the plan\r\nfrom the old Romans; and even before it was finished, our Panth\xc3\xa9on\r\ntottered on its legs like a child with the rickets and staggered like a\r\ndrunken man, so that we had to give it crutches of stone, otherwise it\r\nwould have measured its shameful length on the ground, in sight of all\r\nthe world, and would have given the nations something to laugh at for\r\nmore than a hundred francs.--We thought it better to set up an obelisk\r\non one of our squares; we had to go and filch it at Luxor, and we were\r\ntwo years bringing it home. Old Egypt lined its roads with obelisks as\r\nwe line ours with poplars; it carried bundles of them under its arm as\r\nthe market-gardener carries bunches of asparagus, and carved a monolith\r\nfrom the sides of its mountains of granite more easily than we make\r\ntooth-picks or ear-picks. A few centuries ago Raphael was living and\r\nMichael Angelo; now we have Monsieur Paul Delaroche, all because we\r\nare progressing.--You boast of your Op\xc3\xa9ra; ten Op\xc3\xa9ras like yours could\r\ndance a saraband in a Roman circus. Monsieur Martin, himself, with his\r\ntame tiger and his poor gouty lion, sound asleep like a subscriber\r\nto the _Gazette_, makes a very poor showing beside the gladiator of\r\nantiquity. Take your benefit performances that last till two o\'clock\r\nin the morning--what do they amount to when you think of the games\r\nthat lasted a hundred days, of the plays in which real ships really\r\nfought in real water; in which thousands of men conscientiously cut\r\none another in pieces;--aye, turn pale O heroic Franconi!--in which,\r\nwhen the sea retired, the desert arrived with its roaring tigers and\r\nlions, awe-inspiring supernumeraries who did duty but once; in which\r\nthe leading r\xc3\xb4le was taken by some robust, athletic Dacian or Pannonian\r\nwhom they would very often have found it embarrassing to produce at\r\nthe end of the play, his sweetheart being a lovely and dainty Numidian\r\nlioness who had fasted for three days?--Does it not seem to you that\r\nthe rope-dancing elephant was superior to Mademoiselle Georges? Do you\r\nsuppose Mademoiselle Taglioni is a better dancer than Arbuscula, and\r\nPerrot better than Bathyllus? I am convinced that Roscius could have\r\ngiven points to Bocage, excellent actor though he is,--Galeria Coppiola\r\nplayed _ing\xc3\xa9nue_ r\xc3\xb4les when she was more than a hundred years old. It\r\nis fair to say that the oldest of our _jeunes premi\xc3\xa8res_ is but little\r\nmore than sixty, and that Mademoiselle Mars shows no sign of progress\r\nin that direction: they had three or four thousand gods in whom they\r\nbelieved, and we have only one and we hardly believe in him; that is a\r\nstrange kind of progress.--Was not Jupiter a better man than Don Juan\r\nand a much more successful seducer? Verily, I cannot see what we have\r\ndiscovered or even improved.\r\n\r\nAfter the progressive journalists, as if to serve as a foil to them,\r\ncome the blas\xc3\xa9 journalists, who are usually twenty or twenty-two years\r\nold, who have never left their quarter and have as yet lain only with\r\ntheir housekeeper. Everything bores them, tires them out; they are\r\nsated, blas\xc3\xa9, used up, inaccessible. They know beforehand what you\r\nare going to say to them; they have seen, felt, heard, experienced\r\neverything that it is possible to see, feel, hear, and experience; the\r\nhuman heart has no corner so dark that they have not held a lantern\r\nto it. They say to you with marvellous self-possession: "The human\r\nheart is not like that; women are not made so; that character is\r\nfalsely drawn;"--or else: "What\'s this! always love or hatred! always\r\nmen and women! Can\'t you talk about something else? Why, man is worn\r\nthreadbare, and woman, more so, since Monsieur de Balzac took a hand.\r\n\r\n"\'Who will deliver us from men and women?\'\r\n\r\n"Do you think your fable is new, monsieur? it is new after the fashion\r\nof the Pont-Neuf:[2] nothing in the world could be more common; I read\r\nit somewhere or other;--when I was out at nurse or somewhere else;\r\nit\'s been dinned into my ears for ten years.--By the way, monsieur,\r\nunderstand that there\'s nothing I don\'t know, that everything is\r\nworn threadbare for me, and that even if your idea were as virginal\r\nas the Virgin Mary, I would swear, none the less, that I had seen it\r\nprostituting itself on street corners to the vilest scribblers and the\r\nmost contemptible pedants."\r\n\r\nJournalists of that stamp are responsible for Jocko, Le Monstre Vert,\r\nLes Lions de Mysore, and a thousand other charming conceits.\r\n\r\nThey are constantly complaining of being obliged to read books and see\r\nplays. Apropos of a paltry vaudeville, they will talk about flowering\r\nalmond-trees, limes that perfume the air, the breezes of spring, the\r\nodor of the young foliage; they set up for lovers of nature after the\r\nstyle of young Werther, and yet they have never set foot outside of\r\nParis and could not tell a cabbage from a beet.--If it is winter, they\r\nprate about the joys of the domestic fireside, and the crackling fire,\r\nand the andirons, and the slippers, and the reverie and the state\r\nbetween sleeping and waking; they never fail to quote Tibullus\'s famous\r\nline:\r\n\r\n     Quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem,\r\n\r\nby the aid of which they assume a knowing and at the same time\r\ningenuous air, the most fascinating thing imaginable. They pose as men\r\nupon whom the work of men can no longer make any impression, whom the\r\nemotions aroused by the drama leave as cold and hard as the knife with\r\nwhich they cut their quills, but who exclaim, nevertheless, with Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau: "Ah! there\'s the periwinkle!" They profess fierce\r\nantipathy to the colonels at the Gymnase, the American uncles, the\r\ncousins, male and female, the sensitive old grumblers, the romantic\r\nwidows, and try to cure us of the vaudeville by proving every day by\r\nthe _feuilletons_ that all Frenchmen are not born wicked.--In truth,\r\nwe see no great harm in that, but the contrary, and we are glad to\r\nacknowledge that the extinction of the vaudeville or the opera-comique\r\nin France--national style--would be one of the greatest benefactions\r\nthat the press and Heaven could bestow.--But I should be very glad\r\nto know what species of literature these gentlemen would allow to be\r\nestablished in its place. To be sure, it could be no worse.\r\n\r\nOthers preach against false taste and translate Seneca the tragedian.\r\nLastly, and to close the procession, a new battalion of critics has\r\nbeen formed, of a species never before seen.\r\n\r\nTheir formula for estimating a work is the most convenient, the most\r\nelastic, the most malleable, the most peremptory, the most superlative,\r\nand the most successful that a critic ever could have conceived. Zoilus\r\nwould certainly have lost nothing thereby.\r\n\r\nHitherto, when it has seemed desirable to depreciate a work of any\r\nsort or to cast odium upon it in the eyes of the patriarchal and\r\nsimple-minded subscriber, the ordinary method has been to make false\r\nor cunningly isolated quotations; to maim sentences and mutilate\r\nlines in such a way that the author himself would have considered\r\nhimself the most ridiculous creature on earth; to bring accusations of\r\nimaginary plagiarisms; to place passages from his book side by side\r\nwith passages from ancient or modern authors, which had not the least\r\nconnection therewith; to accuse him, after the style of a cook and with\r\ninnumerable solecisms, of not knowing his own language and of degrading\r\nthe French of Racine and Voltaire; to assert in all seriousness that\r\nhis book tended toward anthropophagy, and that readers would infallibly\r\nbecome cannibals or have hydrophobia in the course of the week; but all\r\nthat was paltry, out of date, false and fossilized to the last degree.\r\nBy dint of having dragged along through _feuilletons_ and _Vari\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9s_\r\narticles, the charge of immorality became insufficient, and so unfit\r\nfor service that the _Constitutionnel_, a bashful and progressive\r\njournal, as we know, was almost the only one that had the desperate\r\ncourage to continue to use it.\r\n\r\nSo they invented the criticism of the future, the Prospective\r\ncriticism. Can you imagine, at first thought, what a charming thing it\r\nis and what a prolific imagination it indicates? The recipe is simple\r\nand I can tell you what it is. The book that will be considered fine\r\nand will be praised is the book that has not yet appeared. The one that\r\nhas just appeared is infallibly detestable. The one to appear to-morrow\r\nwill be superb; but it is always to-day. It is the same with this sort\r\nof criticism as with the barber who had these words in huge letters for\r\nhis sign:\r\n\r\n         SHAVING FREE HERE TO-MORROW.\r\n\r\nAll the poor devils who read the placard promised themselves for the\r\nnext day the ineffable, sovereign sweetness of being barbered once in\r\ntheir lives without unloosing their purse-strings: and the hair on\r\ntheir chins easily grew half a foot during the night that preceded\r\nthat blessed day; but when they had the napkin around their necks, the\r\nbarber asked them if they had any money and bade them pay up, or he\r\nwould treat them like nut-pickers or apple-gatherers of Le Perche; and\r\nhe swore a mighty _sacre dieu_ that he would cut their throats with\r\nhis razor unless they paid him; and when the poor devils, whining and\r\nwhimpering, talked about the sign and the sacrosanct inscription:--"Ha!\r\nha! my little fatties!" said the barber, "you don\'t know so much\r\nafter all, and you\'d much better go back to school! The sign says:\r\n\'To-morrow!\' I\'m no such whimsical fool as to shave for nothing to-day;\r\nmy confr\xc3\xa8res would say I was throwing away my trade.--Come another\r\ntime, come the week that has two Sundays together, and you\'ll find\r\neverything all right. May I be called a niggardly fellow and a flat, if\r\nI don\'t shave you for nothing, on the word of an honest barber."\r\n\r\nAuthors who read a prospective article in which an existing work is\r\nattacked always flatter themselves that the book they are writing will\r\nbe the book of the future. They try to accommodate themselves, as\r\nmuch as possible, to the ideas of the critic, and become socialists,\r\nprogressives, moralizers, palingenetics, mystics, pantheists,\r\nbuchezists, thinking in that way to escape the anathema; but the same\r\nthing happens to them that happened to the barber\'s customers:--to-day\r\nis not the eve of to-morrow. The to-morrow that we hear so much about\r\nwill never shine upon the world; for the formula is too convenient to\r\nbe abandoned so soon. Even while decrying the book of which they are\r\njealous and which they would be glad to annihilate, they put on the\r\ngloves of the most generous impartiality. They apparently ask nothing\r\nbetter than to approve and praise it, and yet they never do it. This\r\nrecipe is very superior to the one that we might call retrospective,\r\nwhich consists in vaunting ancient works only--works which no one reads\r\nand no one cares about--at the expense of modern books, which people do\r\nthink about and which wound their self-esteem more directly.\r\n\r\nWe said, before beginning this review of messieurs the critics, that\r\nthe material would fill fifteen or sixteen folio volumes, but that\r\nwe would content ourselves with a few lines; I am beginning to fear\r\nthat those lines will prove to be each two or three thousand fathoms\r\nlong and will resemble those thick, bulky pamphlets that a cannon-ball\r\nwould not make a hole through, which bear the perfidious title: "A\r\nword concerning the Revolution," a word concerning this or that. The\r\nhistory of the doings of the manifold loves of the goddess Madeleine\r\nde Maupin, would run great risk of being elbowed out of the first\r\nbook, and you will understand that two whole volumes are not too much\r\nto sing worthily the adventures of that lovely Bradamante.--That is\r\nwhy, however much we may desire to continue the blazonry of the\r\nillustrious Aristarchuses of the age, we will content ourselves with\r\nthe partial sketch we have drawn, adding a few reflections concerning\r\nthe good-nature of our easy-going confr\xc3\xa8res in Apollo, who, as stupid\r\nas the Cassander of pantomime, stand still to receive the blows from\r\nHarlequin\'s lath and the clown\'s kicks in the stern, without budging\r\nany more than an idol.\r\n\r\nThey resemble a fencing-master, who should fold his arms behind his\r\nback during a bout, and receive all his opponent\'s thrusts in his\r\nunprotected breast without attempting a single parry.\r\n\r\nIt is like the trial of a cause in which the king\'s attorney only is\r\nallowed to speak, or a debate in which no reply is permitted.\r\n\r\nThe critic puts forward this or that theory. He makes a great dash\r\nand ostentatious display. Absurd, detestable, monstrous; it resembles\r\nnothing, it resembles everything. A drama is produced, the critic goes\r\nto see it; he finds that it bears no resemblance to the drama he had\r\nconstructed in his head on the strength of the title; thereupon he\r\nsubstitutes, in his _feuilleton_, his own drama for the author\'s. He\r\ninterlards it with his erudite phrases; he relieves himself of all the\r\nknowledge he has collected the day before in some library, and belabors\r\npeople to whom he ought to go to school, and the least of whom could\r\nteach greater men than he.\r\n\r\nAuthors endure this with a magnanimity, a long-suffering which seems\r\nto me truly inconceivable. After all is said and done, who are these\r\ncritics whose tone is so cutting, whose words are so peremptory, that\r\none would say they were veritable sons of the gods? they are simply\r\nmen who were our school-fellows, and who have evidently profited\r\nless by their studies than we, since they have produced nothing and\r\ncan do nothing but befoul and spoil the work of others like genuine\r\nStymphalian vampires.\r\n\r\nWould it not be worth while to criticise the critics? for those\r\ndisgruntled great men, who are so fond of playing the magnificent\r\nand the fastidious, are far from being infallible like the Holy\r\nFather. There would be matter enough to fill a daily newspaper of the\r\nlargest size. Their errors, historical or otherwise, their distorted\r\nquotations, their mistakes in grammar, their plagiarism, their drivel,\r\ntheir oft-repeated, ill-bred jests, their paucity of ideas, their\r\nlack of intelligence and tact, their ignorance of the simplest\r\nthings which leads them to mistake the Pir\xc3\xa6us for a man and Monsieur\r\nDelaroche for a painter, would furnish authors with ample material for\r\nvengeance, without other labor than that of drawing a line under the\r\npassages and reproducing them word for word; for one does not receive\r\na commission as a great writer with a commission as critic, and to\r\nreproach others for errors in language or taste is not enough to ensure\r\none against making them himself; our critics prove it every day.--If\r\nChateaubriand, Lamartine, and other men of that stamp should become\r\ncritics, I could understand that people might go down on their knees\r\nand worship them; but that Messieurs Z. K. Y. V. Q. X., or any other\r\nletter of the alphabet between Alpha and Omega, should set themselves\r\nup as little Quintilians and scold you in the name of morality and\r\ngood literature--that is what always disgusts me and sends me into\r\nan unparalleled rage. I would like to have a police ordinance issued\r\nprohibiting certain names from attacking certain others. To be sure, a\r\ncat may look at a king, and Saint-Peter\'s at Rome, giant that it is,\r\ncannot prevent the Transteverins from defiling its base in strange\r\nfashion; but I do not believe, nevertheless, that it would be a bad\r\nidea to inscribe upon certain monumental reputations:\r\n\r\n              NO FILTH DEPOSITED HERE.\r\n\r\nCharles X. alone understood the question. By ordering the suppression\r\nof newspapers he conferred a great service upon the arts and\r\ncivilization. Newspapers are in a certain sense courtiers or jobbers,\r\nwho interpose between artists and public, between king and people. We\r\nknow the fine things that resulted therefrom. This perpetual barking\r\nand snarling benumbs inspiration and causes such a feeling of distrust\r\nin the heart and mind, that no one dares place his confidence either\r\nin a poet or in a government; the result being that royalty and poesy,\r\nthe two greatest things in the world, become impossible, to the great\r\ndetriment of the people, who sacrifice their well-being to the paltry\r\npleasure of reading every morning a few vile sheets printed on vile\r\npaper, besmeared with vile ink, and filled with vile stuff. There\r\nwas no criticism of art under Julius II., and I never heard of any\r\n_feuilleton_ on the subject of Daniel de Volterra, Sebastiano del\r\nPiombo, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Ghiberti della Porta, or Benvenuto\r\nCellini; and yet I think that, for people who had no newspapers, who\r\ndid not know the word _art_ or the word _artistic_, they had a fair\r\nshare of talent and acquitted themselves reasonably well at their\r\ntrade. The reading of newspapers hinders the growth of genuine scholars\r\nand genuine artists; it is like daily dissipation that brings you,\r\nenervated and weak, to the bed of the Muses, those harsh, exacting\r\ndamsels who will have none but fresh and lusty lovers. The newspaper\r\nkills the book, as the book has killed architecture, as artillery has\r\nkilled physical courage and muscular strength. No one realizes the\r\npleasures that the newspapers deprive us of. They strip everything of\r\nits virginity; they prevent us from having anything of our own, even\r\nfrom owning a book all by ourselves; they deprive us of the pleasure\r\nof being surprised at the theatre by telling us beforehand how every\r\nplay ends; they deprive us of the pleasure of spreading idle gossip and\r\ntittle-tattle and slander, of inventing false news or peddling genuine\r\nnews for a whole week through every salon in society. They drone\r\nready-made opinions to us, do what we will, and warn us against things\r\nwe might like; by their means, dealers in phosphorous matches, although\r\nthey have poor memories, discuss literature as impertinently as\r\nprovincial academicians; by their means we hear, all day long, in place\r\nof artless opinions or individual nonsense, ill-digested fragments of\r\nnewspapers, which resemble omelets half cooked on one side and burned\r\non the other,--and we are pitilessly stuffed with news three or four\r\nhours old, which children at the breast already know; they deaden our\r\ntaste, they make us like those people who drink spiced brandy, and\r\nthose who swallow lemons and grape-stalks, and lose the flavor of the\r\nmost generous wines and cannot appreciate their delicate, perfumed\r\nbouquet. If Louis-Philippe should suppress all literary and political\r\njournals once for all, I should be infinitely grateful to him and I\r\nwould dash off on the spot a fine, rambling dithyramb, in soaring verse\r\nwith alternate rhymes; signed: "Your most humble and loyal subject,"\r\netc. Pray do not imagine that there would be no further interest in\r\nliterature; in the days when there were no newspapers, a quatrain\r\nengrossed all Paris for a week, and a first performance for six months.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this step would result in the loss of advertisements\r\nand puffs at thirty sous a line, and notoriety would be less sudden\r\nand less overwhelming. But I have thought out a very ingenious way\r\nof replacing advertisements. If, between now and the day when this\r\nmagnificent novel is placed on sale, my gracious sovereign shall\r\nhave suppressed the newspapers, I shall most assuredly make use of\r\nit, and I anticipate wonders therefrom. When the great day arrives,\r\ntwenty-four mounted criers, in the livery of Renduel, with his address\r\non their backs and breasts, carrying banners in their hands with the\r\ntitle of the novel embroidered on both sides, each preceded by a\r\ndrummer and kettle-drummer, will ride through the city, and, halting\r\non all the squares and corners, will shout in a loud, distinct voice:\r\n"To-day, not yesterday or to-morrow, is placed on sale the admirable,\r\nthe inimitable, the divine and more than divine novel by the most\r\nillustrious Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, _Mademoiselle de Maupin_, which Europe,\r\nnot to mention other parts of the world and Polynesia, has been\r\nawaiting so impatiently for a year and more. It is selling at the\r\nrate of five hundred a minute, and editions follow one another from\r\nhalf-hour to half-hour; the nineteenth is already on sale. A detachment\r\nof municipal guards is stationed at the door of the shop, holding back\r\nthe crowd and preventing all confusion." Surely that would be worth as\r\nmuch as three lines in the _D\xc3\xa9bats_ or the _Courrier Fran\xc3\xa7ais_, between\r\nadvertisements of elastic belts, hoop-skirts, nursing-bottles with\r\nindestructible teats, Regnault paste, and remedies for fluor albus.\r\n\r\n_May, 1834._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: April fools--literally, April fishes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: New Bridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE DE MAUPIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nYou complain, my dear friend, of the infrequency of my letters.--What\r\nwould you have me write you except that I am well and that my affection\r\nfor you never changes?--Those are facts that you know perfectly well,\r\nand that are so natural to my age and to the noble qualities that every\r\none recognizes in you, that it is almost absurd to send a paltry sheet\r\nof paper a hundred leagues to say nothing more.--In vain do I cudgel my\r\nbrains, I know of nothing that is worth the trouble of repeating; mine\r\nis the most monotonous life imaginable and nothing happens to break the\r\nmonotony. To-day leads up to to-morrow as yesterday led up to to-day;\r\nand without claiming to be a prophet, I can boldly prophesy in the\r\nmorning what will happen to me in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis is how I arrange my day:--I rise, that goes without saying, and\r\nthat is the beginning of every day; I breakfast, I fence, I go out to\r\nwalk, I come home, I dine, make a few calls or amuse myself reading:\r\nthen I go to bed precisely as I did the day before; I go to sleep, and\r\nas my imagination is not excited by unfamiliar objects, it supplies me\r\nwith none but threadbare, often repeated dreams, as monotonous as my\r\nactual life: all this is not very entertaining, as you see. However,\r\nI reconcile myself to this existence better than I should have done\r\nsix months ago.--I am bored, to be sure, but in a tranquil, resigned\r\nfashion, which does not lack a certain agreeableness, which might well\r\nbe compared to those gray, mild autumn days in which one finds a secret\r\ncharm after the excessive heat of summer.\r\n\r\nThis sort of existence, although I have apparently accepted it, is\r\nhardly suited to me, however, or, at all events, it bears but little\r\nresemblance to the existence I dream of and consider myself well\r\nadapted for.--Perhaps I am mistaken and am in reality adapted for no\r\nother kind of life than this; but I can hardly believe it, for, if it\r\nwere my real destiny, I should more readily have adapted myself to it\r\nand should not be so painfully bruised by its sharp corners in so many\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nYou know what a powerful attraction strange adventures have for me,\r\nhow I adore everything out of the common course, extravagant and\r\ndangerous, and with what avidity I devour novels and tales of travel;\r\nI doubt if there is on this earth a madder, more vagabond fancy than\r\nmine; and yet, by some curious fatality or other, I have never had an\r\nadventure, I have never made a journey. So far as I am concerned, the\r\ntour of the world means the tour of the town in which I live; I touch\r\nmy horizon on every side; I am elbow to elbow with reality. My life is\r\nthat of the shell on the sand-bank, of the ivy clinging to the tree, of\r\nthe cricket on the hearth.--Verily, I am surprised that my feet have\r\nnever taken root.\r\n\r\nCupid is represented with a bandage over his eyes; Destiny should be\r\nrepresented in the same condition.\r\n\r\nI have for a valet a sort of rustic boor, loutish and stupid enough,\r\nwho has travelled as much as the north wind, who has been to the\r\ndevil, to every conceivable place, who has seen with his eyes all the\r\nthings of which I conceive charming ideas, and cares as little about\r\nthem as about a glass of water; he has been in the most extraordinary\r\nsituations; he has had the most amazing adventures that a man can have.\r\nI make him talk sometimes, and I rage inwardly when I think that all\r\nthose fine things have happened to a clown who is capable neither of\r\nsentiment nor reflection, and who is good for nothing but to do what he\r\ndoes, that is to say, brush clothes and clean boots.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that that knave\'s life should have been mine.--For his\r\npart, he considers me very fortunate, and his surprise is unbounded\r\nwhen he sees how melancholy I am.\r\n\r\nAll this is not very interesting, my poor friend, and hardly worth the\r\ntrouble of writing, is it? But as you insist upon it that I must write\r\nto you, I must tell you what I think and what I feel, and must give you\r\nthe history of my ideas, in default of events and acts.--It may be that\r\nthere will be little order and little novelty in what I shall have to\r\nsay to you; but you must blame nobody but yourself for it. You would\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\nYou are the friend of my childhood, I was brought up with you; we lived\r\nour lives in common for a long, long while, and we are accustomed to\r\nexchange our most secret thoughts. I can tell you, therefore, without\r\nblushing, all the absurd things that pass through my unoccupied brain;\r\nI will not add a word, I will not cut out a word, I have no self-love\r\nwith you. So I will be absolutely frank--even in petty, shameful\r\nthings; not before you, certainly, will I cover my nakedness.\r\n\r\nBeneath the shroud of indifferent, depressed ennui to which I have\r\nreferred just now, there stirs sometimes a thought that is benumbed\r\nrather than dead, and I have not always the sad and gentle tranquillity\r\nthat melancholy gives.--I have relapses and fall back into my old\r\nattacks of agitation. Nothing in the world is so fatiguing as those\r\nmotiveless paroxysms, those aimless impulses.--On those days, although\r\nI have no more to do than on any others, I rise very early in the\r\nmorning, before sunrise, I have such a feeling of being in a hurry, of\r\nnot having all the time I need; I dress in hot haste, as if the house\r\nwere on fire, tossing on my clothes at random and bewailing a wasted\r\nminute.--Any one who happened to see me would think that I was going\r\nto keep an assignation or to hunt for money.--Not at all.--I have no\r\nidea where I shall go; but go I must, and I should think my salvation\r\nendangered if I remained at home.--It seems to me as if somebody were\r\ncalling me outside, as if my destiny were passing through the street at\r\nthe moment and the question of my life or death were on the point of\r\nbeing decided.\r\n\r\nI go down with an air of surprise and alarm, clothes in disorder,\r\nhair uncombed: people turn to look and laugh when they meet me, and\r\ntake me for a young rake who has passed the night at the ale-house or\r\nelsewhere. I am drunk to all intent, although I have drunk nothing,\r\nand I have the aspect of a drunken man even to the uncertain gait, now\r\nslow, now fast. I go from street to street like a dog that has lost\r\nhis master, looking in every direction, ill at ease, on the alert,\r\nturning at the slightest sound, gliding into the centre of every\r\ngroup, heedless of the rebuffs of the people I jostle against, and\r\nscrutinizing everything with a clear-sightedness that I do not possess\r\nat other times.--Then all of a sudden it is made clear to me that I am\r\nmistaken, that that surely is not the place, that I must go on farther,\r\nto the other end of the town, Heaven knows where.--And I rush off as\r\nif the devil were after me.--I touch the ground only with the tips of\r\nmy toes and I don\'t weigh an ounce.--Really I must be a strange sight\r\nwith my terrified, frantic manner, my waving arms and the inarticulate\r\ncries I utter.--When I think it over in cold blood, I laugh at myself\r\nwith all my heart, which doesn\'t prevent me, I beg you to believe, from\r\ndoing it all over again on the first occasion.\r\n\r\nIf any one should ask me why I rush about so, I certainly should be\r\nmuch embarrassed to answer. I am in no hurry to arrive, as I am going\r\nnowhere. I am not afraid of being late, as I have no appointment.--No\r\none is waiting for me--and I have no possible reason for hurrying so.\r\n\r\nIs it because an opportunity to love, an adventure, a woman, an idea,\r\na fortune, or anything else is missing in my life, and I am seeking it\r\nunconsciously, impelled by a vague instinct? is my existence struggling\r\nto complete itself? is it a longing to get away from myself and my\r\nsurroundings, the tiresomeness of my life and the wish for something\r\ndifferent? It is one of these, or perhaps all of them together.--At\r\nall events, it is a very unpleasant experience, a feverish irritation\r\nordinarily succeeded by the most complete collapse.\r\n\r\nI often have the idea that, if I had started an hour earlier, or if I\r\nhad quickened my gait, I should have arrived in time; that, while I was\r\npassing through one street, the thing I was looking for passed through\r\nanother, and that a block of carriages was enough to make me miss what\r\nI have been pursuing, regardless of everything else, for so long a\r\ntime.--You cannot imagine the intense melancholy and profound despair\r\ninto which I fall when I see that all this comes to nothing and that\r\nmy youth is passing and no prospect opening before me; thereupon all\r\nmy idle passions mutter in my heart and devour each other for lack of\r\nbetter food, like the wild beasts in a menagerie whom the keeper has\r\nforgotten to feed. Despite the stifled, unacknowledged disappointments\r\nof every day, there is something within me that resists and will not\r\ndie. I have no hope, for, in order to hope, one must have a desire,\r\na certain propensity to wish that things should turn out in one way\r\nrather than another. I desire nothing, for I desire everything. I do\r\nnot hope, or rather I have ceased to hope;--this is too absurd--and\r\nit is absolutely one to me whether a thing is or is not.--I am\r\nwaiting--for what? I don\'t know, but I am waiting.\r\n\r\nIt is a shuddering sort of expectation, overflowing with impatience,\r\nbroken with somersaults and nervous movements, like the suspense of a\r\nlover waiting for his mistress.--Nothing comes;--I fly into a passion\r\nor begin to weep.--I am waiting for heaven to open and an angel to\r\ndescend and make some revelation to me, for a revolution to break out\r\nand the people to give me a throne, for one of Rapha\xc3\xabl\'s virgins to\r\nstep out of its canvas and come and embrace me, for relations that\r\nI don\'t possess to die and leave me the wherewithal to set my fancy\r\nafloat upon a sea of gold, for a hippogriff to snatch me up and bear me\r\naway into unknown regions.--But whatever I am waiting for, it certainly\r\nis nothing commonplace and ordinary.\r\n\r\nIt has gone so far that, when I return home, I never fail to ask: "Has\r\nno one been here? is there no letter for me? nothing new?"--I know\r\nperfectly well that there is nothing, that there can be nothing. That\r\nmakes no difference; I am always much surprised and much disappointed\r\nwhen I receive the regular reply:--"No, monsieur--nothing at all."\r\n\r\nSometimes--very rarely, however--the idea takes a more definite\r\nform.--It will be some lovely woman whom I don\'t know and who doesn\'t\r\nknow me, whom I have met at church or at the theatre and who has not\r\ntaken the slightest notice of me.--I rush all over the house, and until\r\nI have opened the door of the last room--I hardly dare confess it, it\r\nis so utterly absurd--I hope that she has come and is there.--It is\r\nnot conceit on my part.--I am so far from being conceited that several\r\nwomen have taken a most affectionate interest in me--at least so others\r\nhave told me--when I had supposed them to be entirely indifferent to\r\nme and never to have thought much about me.--That comes from another\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nWhen I am not stupefied by ennui and discouragement my mind awakes\r\nand recovers all its former vigor. I hope, I love, I desire, and my\r\ndesires are so violent that I imagine they will force everything to\r\ncome to them, as a powerful magnet attracts bits of iron although they\r\nare at a great distance.--That is why I wait for the things I desire,\r\ninstead of going to them, and I often neglect opportunities that open\r\nmost favorably before my hopes.--Another than I would write the most\r\namorous note you can imagine to his heart\'s divinity, or would seek an\r\nopportunity to approach her.--But I ask the messenger for the reply\r\nto a letter I have not written, and pass my time constructing in my\r\nbrain situations most marvellously adapted to exhibit me to the woman\r\nI love in the most unlooked-for and most favorable light.--I could\r\nmake a book thicker and more ingenious than the Stratagems of Polybius\r\nof all the stratagems I invent to make my way to her presence and\r\nreveal my passion to her. Generally it would be enough to say to one\r\nof my friends: "Present me to Madame So-and-So," and to indulge in a\r\nmythological compliment suitably punctuated with sighs.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to all this, one would naturally think me a fit subject\r\nfor the Petites-Maisons; I am a sensible fellow enough, however, and\r\nI haven\'t carried many mad ideas into execution. All this takes place\r\nin the cellar of my brain, and all these ridiculous ideas are very\r\ncarefully buried in my lowest depths; no one notices anything on the\r\noutside, and I am reputed to be a calm, cold young man, by no means\r\nsusceptible to female charms and indifferent to things affected by most\r\nyoung men of my age; all of which is as far from the truth as society\'s\r\njudgments usually are.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all the things that have happened to dishearten\r\nme, some of my longings have been gratified, and from the small amount\r\nof pleasure their gratification has afforded me, I have come to dread\r\nthe realization of the others. You remember the childish ardor of my\r\nlonging to have a horse of my own? my mother gave me one very recently;\r\nhe is as black as ebony, with a little white star on his face, flowing\r\nmane and tail, glossy coat, slender legs, just exactly the horse I\r\nwanted. When they brought him to me, it gave me such a shock, that I\r\nwas as pale as death, and unable to recover myself, for a good quarter\r\nof an hour; then I mounted him, and started off at a gallop without\r\nsaying a word; I rode straight ahead through the fields for more than\r\nan hour, in a state of ecstasy hard to conceive; I did the same every\r\nday for more than a week, and, upon my word, I don\'t know why I didn\'t\r\nfounder him, or at least break his wind.--Gradually my intense zeal\r\nslackened. I rode my horse at a trot, then at a walk, then I began to\r\nride so indifferently that he would frequently stop without my noticing\r\nit: the pleasure was transformed to a habit much more quickly than I\r\nsupposed.--As for Ferragus--that is the name I gave him--he is really\r\nthe most beautiful creature you can imagine. The hair on his feet\r\nis like the down on a young eagle; he is as active as a goat and as\r\ngentle as a lamb. You will enjoy above all things taking a gallop on\r\nhim when you come here; and, although my passion for equestrianism has\r\ngrown decidedly cool, I am still very fond of him, for he has a very\r\nestimable equine character and I very much prefer him to many human\r\nbeings. If you could hear his neigh of delight when I go to see him in\r\nhis stable, and how intelligent his eyes are when he looks at me! I\r\nconfess that I am touched by those marks of affection, and I put my arm\r\naround his neck and kiss him as affectionately, on my word, as if he\r\nwere a lovely girl.\r\n\r\nI had another longing also, more intense, more ardent, more constantly\r\nawake, more dearly cherished, upon which I had built a fascinating\r\nhouse of cards in my mind, a palace of chimeras, very often demolished,\r\nand reared again with desperate constancy;--it was to have a\r\nmistress--a mistress all my own--like the horse.--I cannot say whether\r\nthe realization of that dream would have cooled my ardor as speedily\r\nas the realization of the other; I doubt it. But perhaps I am wrong,\r\nperhaps I should have grown weary as quickly.--It is a peculiarity of\r\nmy disposition that I crave so frantically what I desire, although I\r\nnever do anything to procure it, that if by chance, or by any other\r\nmeans, I attain the object of my desire, I am so afflicted with moral\r\nweakness and confused to such an extent, that I feel faint and ill,\r\nand have no strength left to enjoy it: so it is that the things that\r\ncome to me without my having wished for them ordinarily afford me more\r\npleasure than those I have most eagerly coveted.\r\n\r\nI am twenty-two years old; I am not virgin.--Alas! nowadays nobody\r\nis so at that age,--either in body--or in heart--which is much\r\nworse.--Aside from those who afford pleasure to men for money, and\r\nwho ought not to count any more than a bad dream, I have had, here\r\nand there, in some dark corner, divers virtuous, or almost virtuous\r\nwomen, neither lovely nor ugly, neither young nor old, such as fall\r\nin the way of a young man who has no settled attachment and whose\r\nheart is disengaged.--With a little good will and a considerable dose\r\nof romantic illusion, you can call that having a mistress, if you\r\nchoose.--So far as I am concerned, it is impossible, and if I should\r\nhave a thousand of that sort I should still consider my longing as far\r\nfrom accomplishment as ever.\r\n\r\nI have had no mistress, therefore, and my sole desire is to have\r\none.--It is a matter that disturbs me strangely; it isn\'t an\r\neffervescent temperament, a boiling of the blood, the first glow of\r\nvirility. It is not woman that I want, it is a woman, a mistress; I\r\nwant her, I will have her, and before long; if I don\'t succeed, I\r\nadmit that I shall never get over it and that I shall retain an inward\r\ntimidity, a secret discouragement that will have a serious influence\r\non the rest of my life.--I shall consider myself lacking in certain\r\nrespects, inharmonious, incomplete--deformed in mind or heart; for,\r\nafter all, what I ask is no more than fair, and nature owes it to\r\nevery man. So long as I fail to gain my end, I shall look upon myself\r\nas nothing more than a child, and I shall not have the confidence in\r\nmyself that I ought to have.--A mistress for myself, that is the _toga\r\nvirilis_ for a young Roman.\r\n\r\nI see so many men, despicable in every respect, with lovely women whose\r\nlackeys they are hardly worthy to be, that a blush rises to my cheeks\r\nfor the women--and for myself.--It gives me a pitiable opinion of\r\nwomen to see them sully themselves with such blackguards who despise\r\nand deceive them, rather than bestow themselves upon some loyal,\r\nsincere young man who would deem himself very fortunate and would adore\r\nthem on bended knees; myself, for example. To be sure, that sort of\r\ncreature frequents salons, struts about in all weathers, and is always\r\nsprawling over the back of some easy-chair, while I stay at home, with\r\nmy face against the window-pane, watching the river steam and the\r\nmist rise, while rearing silently in my heart the perfumed sanctuary,\r\nthe marvellous temple in which I am to set up the future idol of my\r\nsoul.--A chaste and poetical occupation which makes women feel as\r\nlittle kindly toward you as possible.\r\n\r\nWomen have very little liking for contemplative men and take strangely\r\nto those who put their ideas into action. After all, they are not\r\nwrong. Compelled by their education and social position to hold their\r\ntongues and to wait, they naturally prefer those men who come to\r\nthem and talk, for they relieve them from an unnatural and wearisome\r\nsilence: I realize all that; but never as long as I live shall I be\r\nable to make up my mind, as I see many men do, to leave my seat, walk\r\nacross a salon and say unexpectedly to a woman: "Your dress makes you\r\nlook like an angel," or: "Your eyes are particularly bright to-night."\r\n\r\nAll this does not make it any less essential for me to have a mistress.\r\nI don\'t know who it will be, but I see no one among the women I know\r\nwho can fill that dignified and important position properly. I find in\r\nthem but very few of the qualities I must have. Those who are young\r\nenough haven\'t sufficient beauty or charm of mind; those who are young\r\nand beautiful are disgracefully and repulsively virtuous or lack the\r\nnecessary freedom of action; and then there is always some husband or\r\nbrother about, or a mother or an aunt, or I don\'t know what, who has\r\nbig eyes and long ears, and whom one must cajole or throw out of the\r\nwindow.--Every rose has its grub, every woman has heaps of relations\r\nwhom you must get rid of like the caterpillars on a tree, if you want\r\nto pluck the fruit of her beauty some day. There is not one of them,\r\neven to the third cousins in the provinces, whom no one has ever seen,\r\nwho is not determined to maintain his or her dear cousin\'s immaculate\r\npurity in all its snowy whiteness. That is nauseating, and I shall\r\nnever have the necessary patience to tear up all the rank weeds and lop\r\noff the thorns that fatally obstruct the approaches to a pretty woman.\r\n\r\nI don\'t care much for mammas and I care still less for little girls. I\r\nmust confess, too, that married women have very moderate attractions\r\nfor me.--There is a confusion and mixture in the latter case that\r\ndisgust me; I cannot endure the idea of going shares. The woman who has\r\na husband and a lover is a prostitute to one of them, often to both,\r\nand then I could never consent to give place to another. My natural\r\npride would be incapable of stooping to such degradation. Never will\r\nI go away because another man is coming. Though the woman should be\r\ncompromised and ruined, though we should fight with knives, each with\r\none foot on her body--I would remain.--Secret staircases, closets,\r\nwardrobes, and all the machinery of adultery would be poor expedients\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nI am but little enamored of what is known as virgin purity, the\r\ninnocence of the flower of life, purity of heart, and other charming\r\nthings which sound most beautiful in verse; I call it all pure\r\nnonsense, ignorance, imbecility, or hypocrisy.--Virgin purity, which\r\nconsists in sitting on the edge of a chair, with the arms pressed close\r\nagainst the body, the eye on the point of the corset, and in speaking\r\nonly after permission from its grandparents, the innocence which has a\r\nmonopoly of uncurled hair and white dresses, the purity of heart which\r\nwears the corsage high in the neck, because it has as yet no breast or\r\nshoulders, do not seem to me, in very truth, a marvellously tempting\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nI am not at all anxious to teach little fools to say the alphabet of\r\nlove.--I am not old enough or corrupt enough to take any great pleasure\r\nin that. I should have but ill-success, too, for I have never had the\r\nknack of teaching anybody, even the things that I knew best. I prefer\r\nwomen who can read freely, you get to the end of the chapter sooner;\r\nand in all things, but especially in love, what one must consider, is\r\nthe end. In that respect I am much like those people who take a novel\r\nby the tail and read the conclusion first, being prepared then to\r\ngo backward to the first page. That method of reading and loving has\r\nits charm. One relishes the details better when one\'s mind is at ease\r\nconcerning the end, and reversing the natural order of things brings\r\nthe unexpected to pass.\r\n\r\nSo young girls and married women are excluded from the category.\r\nTherefore we must select our divinity from among the widows.--Alas! I\r\nam very much afraid that although we have nothing left but them, we\r\nshall still fail to find what we want.\r\n\r\nIf I should fall in love with one of those pale narcissuses bathed in a\r\nwarm dew of tears and stooping with melancholy grace over the brand-new\r\nmarble gravestone of some husband happily and recently deceased, I\r\nshould certainly be, and in a very short time, as unhappy as the\r\ndefunct spouse in his lifetime. Widows, however young and charming\r\nthey may be, have one terrible inconvenience that other women have\r\nnot; the instant that everything does not go well with them and the\r\nslightest cloud floats across the sky of love, they say at once, with\r\na high and mighty, contemptuous manner: "Oh! how you act to-day! You\r\nare exactly like monsieur: when we quarrelled he never said anything\r\nbut that; it\'s very strange, you have the same tone and the same\r\nexpression; when you are angry, you can\'t imagine how much you resemble\r\nmy husband:--it\'s enough to make one shudder."--It\'s very pleasant to\r\nhave such things thrown in your face point-blank! There are some who\r\ncarry their impudence to the point of praising the departed like an\r\nepitaph and extolling his heart and his leg at the expense of your\r\nleg and your--heart.--With women who have only one or several lovers,\r\none has, at all events, the inestimable advantage of never hearing of\r\none\'s predecessor, which is no trifling consideration. Women have too\r\ngreat an affection for what is proper and legitimate not to be very\r\ncareful to keep quiet under such circumstances, and all those matters\r\nare relegated as speedily as possible to the old records.--It is always\r\nunderstood that one is always a woman\'s first lover.\r\n\r\nI do not consider that there is any serious answer to be made to\r\nsuch a well-founded aversion. It is not that I look upon widows as\r\naltogether unpleasing, when they are young and pretty and haven\'t put\r\noff their mourning. There are the little languishing airs, the little\r\ntricks of letting the arms fall, bending the neck and puffing up\r\nlike a half-fledged turtle-dove; a multitude of charming mannerisms\r\nprettily veiled behind the transparent mask of cr\xc3\xaape, a coquetry of\r\ndespair so skilfully managed, sighs so adroitly husbanded, tears that\r\nfall so in the nick of time and make the eyes so bright!--Certainly,\r\nafter my wine, if not before, the liqueur I love best to drink is a\r\nlovely, clear, limpid tear trembling at the end of a dark or light\r\neyelash.--How is a man to resist that!--We don\'t resist it;--and then\r\nblack is so becoming to women!--The fair skin, poetry aside, turns to\r\nivory, snow, milk, alabaster, to everything pure and white on earth\r\nthat madrigal-makers can use: the dark skin has only a dash of brown,\r\nfull of animation and fire.--Mourning is good fortune for a woman, and\r\nthe reason why I shall never marry is that I am afraid my wife would\r\nget rid of me in order to wear mourning for me.--There are women,\r\nhowever, who do not know how to make the most of their affliction\r\nand who weep in such a way as to make their noses red and to distort\r\ntheir features so that they look like the grotesque figures we see\r\non fountains: that\'s a great stumbling-block. A woman must have many\r\ncharms and much art to weep agreeably; lacking those, she runs the\r\nrisk of not being consoled for a long time.--Nevertheless, great as\r\nthe pleasure may be of making some Artemisia unfaithful to the shade\r\nof her Mausolus, I do not intend to choose definitely, from among\r\nthe lamenting swarm, the one whom I will ask to give me her heart in\r\nexchange for mine.\r\n\r\nI hear you say at that: "Whom will you take, then?--You won\'t have\r\nunmarried girls nor married women, nor widows.--You don\'t love mammas;\r\nI don\'t imagine that you love grandmammas any better.--Whom in the\r\ndevil do you love?"--That is the key to the charade, and if I knew\r\nit I should not torment myself so. Thus far I have never loved any\r\nwoman, but I have loved and I do love _love._ Although I have had no\r\nmistresses and the women I have had have aroused in me nothing but\r\ndesire, I have felt and I know the sensation of love itself: I do not\r\nlove this one or that one, one rather than another, but some one I\r\nhave never seen, who must exist somewhere, and whom I shall find, God\r\nwilling. I know what she looks like, and when I meet her I shall know\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI have very often imagined the place she lives in, the dress she wears,\r\nthe color of her eyes and her hair.--I can hear her voice; I should\r\nknow her step among a thousand others, and if, by chance, any one\r\nshould mention her name, I should turn to look; it is impossible that\r\nshe should not have one of five or six names I have assigned to her in\r\nmy head.\r\n\r\nShe is twenty-six years old--no more, neither less nor more.--She is\r\nnot ignorant and she has not yet become _blas\xc3\xa9._ It is a charming age\r\nat which to make love as it should be made, without puerile nonsense\r\nand without libertinage.--She is of medium height. I don\'t like a giant\r\nor a dwarf. I want to be able to carry my deity from the sofa to the\r\nbed without assistance; but it would be unpleasant to me to have to\r\nhunt for her there. She must be just tall enough to put her mouth to\r\nmine for a kiss by standing on tiptoe. That is the proper height. As\r\nfor her size, she is rather plump than thin. I am a little of a Turk\r\non that point, and it would be very disagreeable to me to find an\r\nangle where I was looking for a rounded outline; a woman\'s skin should\r\nbe well filled out, her flesh hard and firm as the pulp of an almost\r\nripe peach: the mistress I shall have is made in just that way. She\r\nis a blonde with black eyes, the fair skin of a blonde and the rich\r\ncoloring of a brunette, something red and sparkling in her smile. The\r\nlower lip a little thick, the pupil of the eye swimming in a sea of\r\naqueous humor, the throat well-rounded and small, the wrists slender,\r\nthe hands long and plump, the gait undulating like a snake rearing on\r\nits tail, the hips full and flexible, the shoulders broad, the back of\r\nthe neck covered with down;--a refined and yet healthy style of beauty,\r\nanimated and graceful, poetic and human; a sketch by Giorgione executed\r\nby Rubens.\r\n\r\nThis is her costume! she wears a dress of scarlet or black velvet\r\nslashed with white satin or cloth of silver, an open corsage, a huge\r\nruff _\xc3\xa0 la_ Medici, a felt hat, capriciously dented like Helena\r\nSysterman\'s, and long white feathers crisp and curled, a gold chain or\r\na stream of diamonds around her neck, and on all her fingers a number\r\nof large rings of various enamels.\r\n\r\nI would not waive a single ring or bracelet. The dress must be of\r\nvelvet or brocade; if I should allow her to descend to satin, it would\r\nbe the utmost concession I would make. I would rather rumple a silk\r\nskirt than a cotton one, and pull pearls or feathers from a head than\r\nnatural flowers or a simple knot of ribbon; I am aware that the lining\r\nof the cotton skirt is often at least as appetizing as that of the\r\nsilk skirt; but I prefer the latter.--And so, in my dreams, I have\r\ntaken for my mistress many queens, many empresses, many princesses,\r\nmany sultanas, many famous courtesans, but never middle-class women\r\nor shepherdesses; and in my most vagabond desires, I have never taken\r\nadvantage of any one on a carpet of turf or in a bed of Aumale serge.\r\nI consider that beauty is a diamond which should be mounted and set in\r\nsolid gold. I cannot imagine a lovely woman who has not a carriage,\r\nhorses, servants, and everything that one has with a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs a year: there is a certain harmony between beauty and wealth.\r\nOne demands the other; a pretty foot calls for a pretty shoe, a pretty\r\nshoe calls for carpets and a carriage, and so on. A lovely woman with\r\nmean clothes in a wretched house is, to my mind, the most painful\r\nspectacle one can see, and I could never fall in love with her. Only\r\nthe comely and the rich can fall in love without making themselves\r\nridiculous or pitiable.--On that principle few people have the right to\r\nfall in love: I myself should be shut out first of all; however, that\'s\r\nmy opinion.\r\n\r\nIt will be evening when we meet for the first time--during a lovely\r\nsunset;--the sky will have the bright orange-yellow and pale-green\r\ntints that we see in some pictures by the great masters of the old\r\ndays: there will be a broad avenue of chestnuts in flower and venerable\r\nelms all covered with ringdoves,--lovely trees clothed in cool dark\r\ngreen, shadows full of mystery and moisture; here and there a statue or\r\ntwo, some marble vases, standing out in their snowy whiteness against\r\nthe background of verdure, and a sheet of water in which the familiar\r\nswan disports itself,--and in the background a ch\xc3\xa2teau of brick and\r\nstone as in the days of Henri IV., pointed, slate-covered roof, tall\r\nchimneys, weather-cocks on every gable, long, narrow windows.--At one\r\nof the windows, leaning in melancholy mood upon the balcony rail,\r\nstands the queen of my heart in the costume I described to you a moment\r\nago; behind her is a little negro carrying her fan and her parrot.--You\r\nsee that nothing is lacking and that it is all utterly absurd.--The\r\nfair one drops her glove;--I pick it up, kiss it and return it. We\r\nengage in conversation; I display all the wit that I do not possess;\r\nI say some charming things; she answers me, I retort; it is a display\r\nof fireworks, a luminous shower of dazzling repartee.--In short, I\r\nam adorable--and adored.--The supper hour arrives, she invites me to\r\njoin her;--I accept.--What a supper, my dear friend, and what a cook\r\nmy imagination is!--The wine laughs in the crystal goblet, the white\r\nand gold pheasant smokes in a platter bearing her crest: the feast is\r\nprolonged far into the night and you can imagine that I don\'t finish up\r\nthe night at home.--Isn\'t that a fine bit of imaginative work?--Nothing\r\nin the world could be simpler, and upon my word it\'s very surprising\r\nthat it doesn\'t happen ten times rather than once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter I--_What a supper----The wine laughs in the\r\ncrystal goblet, the white and gold pheasant smokes in a platter bearing\r\nher crest: the feast is prolonged far into the night and you can\r\nimagine that I don\'t finish up the night at home._]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is in a great forest.--The hunt sweeps by; the horn rings\r\nout, the pack gives tongue and crosses the path with the swiftness\r\nof lightning; the fair one in a riding habit is mounted on a Turkish\r\nhorse, white as milk, spirited and swift beyond words. Although she is\r\nan excellent horsewoman, he paws and curvets and rears, and she has\r\nall the difficulty in the world in holding him; he takes the bit in\r\nhis teeth and rushes straight toward a precipice with her. I fall from\r\nheaven for the express purpose of saving her, I stop the horse, I catch\r\nthe swooning princess in my arms, I bring her to herself and escort her\r\nto her ch\xc3\xa2teau. What well-born woman would refuse her heart to a man\r\nwho has risked his life for her?--None;--and gratitude is a cross-cut\r\nthat leads very quickly to love.\r\n\r\nYou will agree, at all events, that when I go into romance, I don\'t\r\nstop half-way, and that I am as mad as it is possible for a man to be.\r\nThat is as it should be, for nothing in the world is more sickening\r\nthan rational madness. You will agree also that, when I write letters,\r\nthey are volumes rather than simple notes. I love whatever goes beyond\r\nordinary bounds in everything.--That is why I love you. Don\'t laugh too\r\nmuch at all the nonsense I have scribbled; I lay aside my pen to carry\r\nsome of it into execution; for I recur always to my refrain! I mean to\r\nhave a mistress. I cannot say whether it will be the lady of the park\r\nor the lady of the balcony, but I bid you farewell to go in quest of\r\nher. My mind is made up. Though she whom I seek should hide herself in\r\nthe heart of the kingdom of Cathay or Samarcand, I shall find a way to\r\ndislodge her. I will let you know of the success or non-success of my\r\nundertaking. I hope that it will be success: give me your prayers, my\r\ndear friend. As for myself, I dress up in my best coat, and go out of\r\nthe house determined not to return except with such a mistress as I\r\nhave in my mind.--I have dreamed long enough; now to work.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Tell me something about little D----; what has become of him? no\r\none here knows anything about him; and give my compliments to your good\r\nbrother and all the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, my friend, I have come home again, I have not been to Cathay\r\nor Cashmere or Samarcand;--but it is fair to say that I am no nearer\r\nhaving a mistress than ever.--And yet I took myself by the hand, I\r\nswore a mighty oath that I would go to the end of the world. I have\r\nnot even been to the end of the town. I don\'t know what the matter is\r\nwith me, but I have never been able to keep my word to anybody, even\r\nto myself: it must be that the devil takes a hand in it. If I say: "I\r\nwill go there to-morrow," it is certain that I shall stay at home; if\r\nI propose to go to the wine-shop, I go to church; if I start to go to\r\nchurch, the roads get tangled under my feet like skeins of thread,\r\nand I find myself in an entirely different place. I fast when I have\r\ndetermined to have a debauch, and so it goes. Therefore I am inclined\r\nto believe that what prevents me from having a mistress is that I have\r\ndetermined to have one.\r\n\r\nI must tell you about my expedition, step by step: it is well worth\r\nthe honors of narration. I had passed at least two full hours at my\r\ntoilet that day. I had had my hair combed and curled and my moustaches,\r\nsuch as they are, twisted and waxed a little; and as the excitement\r\nof longing imparted some slight animation to my ordinarily pale face,\r\nreally I was not so bad. At last, after scrutinizing myself attentively\r\nin the mirror in different lights, to see if I was fine enough and if\r\nmy bearing was sufficiently gallant, I went resolutely forth with head\r\nerect, chin well raised, eyes front, one hand on the hip, making the\r\nheels of my boots ring like an _anspessade_, elbowing the bourgeois,\r\nand with a flawlessly triumphant and all-conquering air.\r\n\r\nI was like another Jason setting out to conquer the Golden\r\nFleece.--But, alas! Jason was more fortunate than I: besides the\r\nconquest of the fleece, he made, at the same time, the conquest of a\r\nbeautiful princess, and I--I have neither fleece nor princess.\r\n\r\nI walked through the streets, eying all the women, and hurrying toward\r\nthem and gazing at them at closer quarters when they seemed to me to be\r\nworth the trouble of examining.--Some assumed their high and mighty\r\nvirtuous air and passed without raising their eyes.--Others were\r\nsurprised at first, then smiled if they had white teeth.--Some turned\r\nafter a little time, to look at me when they thought I was not looking\r\nat them, and blushed like cherries when they found themselves face to\r\nface with me.--It was a lovely day; there were quantities of people\r\nout walking.--And yet I must confess, notwithstanding all the respect\r\nI feel for that interesting half of the human race, which is called by\r\ncommon consent the fair sex, it is, as a whole, devilishly ugly: out of\r\na hundred women there is hardly one who is passably good-looking. This\r\none had a moustache; that one had a blue nose; others had red spots\r\nin place of eyebrows; one was not badly built, but she had a pimply\r\nface. The head of another was charming, but she could scratch her ear\r\nwith her shoulder; a third would have put Praxiteles to shame with the\r\ngraceful roundness of certain outlines, but she stumbled along on feet\r\nlike Turkish stirrups. Another exhibited the most magnificent shoulders\r\nimaginable; in revenge, her hands resembled in shape and size those\r\nimmense scarlet gloves that haberdashers use for signs.--Generally\r\nspeaking, what tired-looking faces! how worn and streaked they were,\r\nwithered by degrading petty passions and petty vices! What expressions\r\nof envy, of malevolent curiosity, of avarice, of brazen coquetry! and\r\nhow much uglier is a woman who is not beautiful, than a man who is not\r\nhandsome!\r\n\r\nI saw nobody worth looking at--except a few grisettes;--but they have\r\nmore cotton than silk to rumple, and they don\'t interest me.--In very\r\ntruth, I believe that man, and when I say man I include woman, is the\r\nvilest animal on the face of the earth. That quadruped who walks on his\r\nhind feet seems to me extraordinarily presumptuous to claim the first\r\nplace in creation as his undoubted right. A lion, a tiger, are finer\r\nanimals than men, and in their species many individuals attain all the\r\nbeauty that belongs to it. But such a thing rarely happens among human\r\nbeings.--How many abortions for one Antinous! how many Goths for one\r\nPhyllis!\r\n\r\nI am very much afraid, my dear friend, that I shall never be able to\r\nembrace my ideal, and yet there is nothing extraordinary or unnatural\r\nabout it.--It is not the ideal of a third-form school-boy. I do not ask\r\nfor ivory globes or alabaster pillars, or azure veins; I have not used\r\nin its composition either lilies, or snow, or roses, or jet, or ebony,\r\nor coral, or ambrosia, or pearls or diamonds; I have left the stars\r\nof heaven at rest, and I have not unhung the sun unseasonably. It is\r\nalmost a bourgeois ideal, it is so simple, and it seems to me that with\r\na bag or two of piastres I could find it all ready-made and realized in\r\nthe first bazaar I might happen upon at Constantinople or Smyrna; it\r\nwould probably cost me less than a blooded horse or dog; and to think\r\nthat I shall not get what I want, for I have a feeling that I shall\r\nnot! It is enough to drive a man mad, and I fly into the hottest sort\r\nof a rage against fate.\r\n\r\nYou are not such a mad fool as I, you are fortunate;--you have simply\r\ntaken your life as it came, without tormenting yourself trying to shape\r\nit, and you have dealt with things as they turned up. You haven\'t\r\nsought for happiness, it has come in search of you; you love and are\r\nloved.--I don\'t envy you;--for Heaven\'s sake, don\'t think that! but I\r\nam not so happy as I ought to be when I think of your felicity, and I\r\nsay to myself, with a sigh, that I would like to enjoy felicity of the\r\nsame sort.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my happiness passed by my side and I did not see it, blind that\r\nI was; perhaps a voice spoke, and the uproar of my internal tempests\r\nprevented me from hearing it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have been loved in secret by some humble heart that I have\r\nneglected or broken; perhaps I have myself been the ideal of another,\r\nthe pole-star of a suffering heart,--the dream of a night and the\r\nthought of a day.--If I had looked at my feet, perhaps I should\r\nhave seen there some fair Magdalene with her box of ointment and\r\nher dishevelled hair. I walked along with my arms raised to heaven,\r\nlonging to pluck the stars that fled from me, and scorning to pick\r\nthe little daisy that opened its golden heart in the dewy grass. I\r\nhave made a great mistake: I have asked love for something other than\r\nlove, something that it could not give. I forgot that love was naked,\r\nI failed to grasp the meaning of that magnificent symbol.--I asked him\r\nfor brocade dresses, feathers, diamonds, sublime intellect, learning,\r\npoesy, beauty, youth, supreme power--everything that is not love;--love\r\ncan offer naught but love, and he who seeks to extort anything else\r\nfrom him is unworthy to be loved.\r\n\r\nI have been in too much of a hurry, of course: my hour has not yet\r\ncome; God who lent me my life will not take it back without letting me\r\nlive. What\'s the use of giving a poet a lyre without strings, or man\r\na life without love? God cannot be guilty of such inconsistency; and\r\nI have no doubt that when the allotted moment comes, He will place in\r\nmy path the woman I am to love and by whom I am to be loved.--But why\r\nhas love come to me before a mistress? Why am I thirsty when I have no\r\nfountain at which to quench my thirst? or why can I not fly, like the\r\nbirds of the desert, to the spot where water is to be found? The world\r\nto me is a Sahara without wells or date-trees. I have not in my whole\r\nlife a single shady nook to give me shelter from the sun: I suffer all\r\nthe ardors of passion without its ineffable ecstasy and delight; I know\r\nits torments and have not its pleasures. I am jealous of something that\r\ndoes not exist; I am ill at ease for the shadow of a shade; I heave\r\nsighs that mean nothing; I have sleepless nights embellished by no\r\nadored vision; I shed tears that flow to the ground without being wiped\r\naway; I give the wind kisses that are not returned to me; I wear out my\r\neyes trying to distinguish a vague, deceitful shape in the distance; I\r\nawait what cannot come, and I count the hours with feverish anxiety as\r\nif I had an appointment.\r\n\r\nWhoever you be, angel or demon, virgin or courtesan, shepherdess or\r\nprincess, whether you come from north or south, you whom I do not know\r\nbut whom I love! oh! do not force me to wait longer, or the flame\r\nwill consume the altar, and you will find only a heap of cold ashes in\r\nplace of my heart. Descend from the sphere where you now are; leave the\r\ncrystal sky, O comforting spirit, and cast upon my heart the shadow of\r\nyour great wings. Come, woman that I love, come, and let me clasp about\r\nyou the arms that have been open so long. Ye golden doors of the palace\r\nwhere she dwells, turn on your hinges; raise yourself, latch of her\r\nhumble cottage; untwine yourselves, ye branches of trees and thorns by\r\nthe road-side; be broken, ye enchantments of the turret, ye spells of\r\nmagicians; open, ranks of the common herd, and let her pass.\r\n\r\nIf you come too late, O my ideal! I shall not have the strength to love\r\nyou:--my heart is like a dovecote full of doves. Every hour of the day\r\nsome desire takes flight. The doves return to the dovecote, but my\r\ndesires do not return to my heart.--The azure sky is whitened by their\r\ncountless swarms; they wing their way through space, from world to\r\nworld, from sky to sky, seeking some love to light upon and pass the\r\nnight: haste, O my dream! or you will find naught in the empty nest\r\nsave the shells of the birds that have flown.\r\n\r\nMy friend, my childhood\'s companion, you are the only one to whom I\r\ncan say such things. Write me that you pity me and that you don\'t look\r\nupon me as a hypochondriac; comfort me, I never was in greater need\r\nof it; how greatly to be envied are they who have a passion they can\r\nsatisfy! The drunkard finds no cruelty in any sort of a bottle; he\r\nfalls from the wine-shop to the gutter and is happier on his dung-heap\r\nthan a king on his throne. The sensual man resorts to courtesans in\r\nsearch of ready loves or shameless refinements of indecency: a painted\r\ncheek, a short skirt, an exposed bosom, an obscene jest, he is happy;\r\nhis eye turns white, his lip is moist; he attains the height of his\r\nhappiness, he enjoys the ecstasy of his vulgar lust. The gambler needs\r\nonly a green cloth and a worn and greasy pack of cards to procure the\r\npoignant excitement, the nervous spasms and the diabolical joy of\r\nhis ghastly passion. Such people can satisfy their cravings or find\r\ndistraction;--to me it is impossible.\r\n\r\nThis idea has taken such thorough possession of me that I no longer\r\ncare for the arts, and poetry has now no charm for me; the things that\r\nused to be my delight do not make the least impression on me. I begin\r\nto believe that I am wrong, I demand more of nature and society than\r\nthey can give. What I seek does not exist and I ought not to complain\r\nbecause I cannot find it. However, if the woman we dream of does not\r\ncome within the conditions of human nature, how is it that we love only\r\nher and not others, since we are men and our instinct should draw us\r\nirresistibly toward them? What puts this imaginary woman into our head?\r\nwith what clay do we mould this invisible statue? where do we get the\r\nfeathers we fasten to the back of this chimera? what mystic bird laid\r\nin a dark corner of our soul the unseen egg from which our dream was\r\nhatched? what is this abstract beauty that we feel but cannot define?\r\nwhy, before a woman who may be charming, do we sometimes say that she\r\nis beautiful,--whereas we find her very ugly? Where is the model, the\r\ntype, the interior pattern that serves us as a point of comparison?\r\nfor beauty is always comparative and can be appreciated only by\r\ncontrast.--Was it in the sky that we saw her--in a star--at a ball\r\nin the shadow of a mother, fresh bud of a leafless rose?--was it in\r\nItaly or in Spain? was it here or there, yesterday or long ago? was it\r\nthe admired courtesan, the popular cantatrice, the prince\'s daughter?\r\na proud and noble head bending under a heavy diadem of pearls and\r\nrubies? a young and childish face stooping over the nasturtiums and\r\nvolubilis in the window?--Of what school was the picture from which\r\nthat beauty looked forth, fair and beaming amid dark shadows? Was it\r\nRaphael who caressed the contour that has caught your fancy? Was it\r\nCleomenes who polished the marble that you adore?--are you in love with\r\na Madonna or a Diana?--is your ideal an angel, a sylph, or a woman?\r\n\r\nAlas! it is a little of all of these and it is none of them.\r\n\r\nThat transparent tint, that charming, blooming freshness, that flesh\r\nwherein the blood and the life flow in abundance, that lovely fair\r\nhair falling over the shoulders like a cloak of gold, that sparkling\r\nlaughter, those amorous dimples, that figure undulating like a\r\nflame, that strength, that suppleness, that glistening satin, those\r\nrounded outlines, those plump arms, that full, smooth back, that\r\nwhole appearance of blooming health belongs to Rubens.--Raphael alone\r\ncould have given that pale tinge of amber to such pure features. What\r\nother than he drew the curves of those long, fine black eyebrows,\r\nand spread out the lashes of those modestly lowered lids?--Do you\r\nthink that Allegri had no part in your ideal? From him the lady of\r\nyour thoughts stole the warm, ivory whiteness of complexion that\r\nfascinates you. She stood long before his canvas to catch the secret\r\nof the angelic smile that is always on her lips; she modelled her oval\r\nfeatures upon those of a nymph or a saint. That line of the hip that\r\nundulates so voluptuously is taken from the sleeping Antiope.--Those\r\nplump, well-shaped hands might be claimed by Dana\xc3\xab or Magdalen. Dusty\r\nantiquity itself supplied much material for the composition of your\r\nyoung chimera; those strong and supple loins, about which you twine\r\nyour arms so passionately, were carved by Praxiteles. The divinity left\r\neverything for the express purpose of putting the toes of her charming\r\nfoot outside the ruins of Herculaneum, so that your idol should not be\r\nlame. Nature also has contributed its share. You have seen here and\r\nthere, in the prismatic rays of desire, a beautiful eye behind a blind,\r\nan ivory forehead pressed against a window, a mouth smiling behind a\r\nfan.--You have divined the quality of the arm from the hand, of the\r\nknee from the ankle. What you saw was perfect; you assumed that the\r\nrest was like what you saw and you finished it out with bits of other\r\nbeauties gathered elsewhere.--Not even ideal beauty, as realized by\r\npainters, is sufficient for you, and you must go and ask the poets\r\nfor outlines even more gracefully rounded, shapes more ethereal,\r\ncharms more divine, refinement more exquisite; you begged them to give\r\nbreath and speech to your phantom, all their love, all their musings,\r\nall their joy and their sadness, their melancholy and their morbid\r\nfancies, all their memories and all their hopes, their knowledge and\r\ntheir passion, their mind and their heart; you took all these from them\r\nand you added, to cap the climax of the impossible, your own passion,\r\nyour own mind, your dreams and your thoughts. The star lent its beams,\r\nthe flower its perfume, the palette its colors, the poet his harmony,\r\nthe marble its shape, and you, your longing.--How could a real woman,\r\nwho eats and drinks, who goes to bed at night and gets up in the\r\nmorning--however adorable and instinct with charm she may be--sustain\r\ncomparison with such a creature! We cannot reasonably hope for such\r\na thing, and yet we do hope for it and seek it.--What extraordinary\r\nblindness! it is sublime or absurd. How I pity and admire those who\r\npursue the reality of their dream through everything and die content,\r\nif only they have once kissed their chimera on the lips! But what a\r\nfrightful fate is that of the Columbuses who have not discovered their\r\nworld, and of lovers who have not found their mistress.\r\n\r\nAh! if I were a poet, I would consecrate my verses to those whose\r\nexistence is a failure, whose arrows have not reached the target,\r\nwho have died with the word they had to say still unsaid and without\r\npressing the hand that was destined for them; to all who have been\r\nunsuccessful or have passed by unnoticed, to genius without issue,\r\nstifled fire, the undiscovered pearl at the bottom of the sea, to all\r\nwho have loved without being loved, to all who have suffered and not\r\nbeen pitied;--it would be a noble task.\r\n\r\nHow wise it was of Plato to wish to banish you from his republic,\r\nand what harm you have done us, O poets! Your ambrosia has made our\r\nabsinthe more bitter than ever; and we have found our lives more arid\r\nand more devastated after plunging our eyes into the vistas leading to\r\neternity that you open to us! What a terrible struggle your dreams have\r\nbrought upon our realities! and how our hearts have been stamped upon\r\nand trampled under foot by those rude athletes!\r\n\r\nWe have seated ourselves like Adam at the foot of the walls of the\r\nterrestrial paradise, on the steps of the staircase that leads to the\r\nworld you have created, seeing a light brighter than the sunlight\r\ngleam through the chinks of the door, hearing vaguely some few\r\nscattered notes of a seraphic harmony. Whenever one of the elect enters\r\nor comes out amid a flood of glory, we stretch our necks trying to see\r\nsomething through the open door. It is fairy-like architecture equalled\r\nnowhere save in Arabian tales. Great numbers of pillars, superimposed\r\narches, fluted spiral columns, leaf-work marvellously carved, trefoils\r\nhollowed out of the stone, porphyry, jasper, lapis-lazuli and Heaven\r\nknows what! transparencies and dazzling reflections, a profusion of\r\nstrange stones, sardonyx, chrysoberyl, aquamarines, rainbow-hued\r\nopals, azerodrach, jets of crystal, torches to make the stars turn\r\npale, a gorgeous vapor filled with noise and vertigo--genuine Assyrian\r\nmagnificence!\r\n\r\nThe door closes: you see no more--and you cast down your eyes, filled\r\nwith burning tears, to the poor, bare, lifeless earth, to the ruined\r\nhovels, to the people in rags, to your own soul, an arid rock upon\r\nwhich nothing grows, to all the woes and misfortunes of reality. Ah! if\r\nwe could only fly as far as that, if the steps of that fiery staircase\r\ndid not burn our feet; but alas! none but angels can climb Jacob\'s\r\nladder!\r\n\r\nWhat a fate is that of the poor man at the rich man\'s door! what\r\nghastly irony in a palace opposite a hovel, the ideal opposite the\r\nreal, poetry opposite prose! what deep-rooted hatred must tighten the\r\nknots at the bottom of the poor wretches\' hearts! what a gnashing of\r\nteeth there must be at night on their poor beds, when the wind brings\r\nto their ears the sighing notes of the lutes and viols of love! Poets,\r\npainters, sculptors, musicians, why have you lied to us? Poets, why did\r\nyou tell us your dreams? Painters, why did you place upon your canvas\r\nthe intangible phantom that ascended and descended between your heart\r\nand your brain with the throbbing of your blood, and say to us: "This\r\nis a woman." Sculptors, why did you procure marble from the bowels of\r\nCarrara to make it express for all time, in the eyes of all men, your\r\nmost secret and most fleeting desire? Musicians, why did you listen to\r\nthe song of the stars and the flowers during the night, and note it\r\ndown? Why do you write such lovely ballads that the softest voice that\r\nsays to us: "I love you!" seems to us as hoarse as the rasping of a\r\nsaw or the cawing of a crow?--My curse on you, impostors!--and may the\r\nfire from heaven burn and destroy all pictures, poems, statues, and\r\nconcerted pieces.--Ouf! there\'s a tirade of interminable length and a\r\nlittle out of the ordinary epistolary style.--What a harangue!\r\n\r\nI just gave full swing to the lyric impulse, my dear friend, and I have\r\nbeen talking on stilts for a long, long time. All this is very far\r\nfrom our subject, which is, if I remember rightly, the glorious and\r\ntriumphant history of the Chevalier d\'Albert in pursuit of Dara\xc3\xafde,\r\nthe loveliest princess in the world, as the old romances say. But in\r\ntruth the story is so poor that I am compelled to have recourse to\r\ndigressions and reflections. I hope that it will not always be so, and\r\nthat, before long, the romance of my life will be more involved and\r\ncomplicated than a Spanish imbroglio.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering about from street to street, I decided to call on one\r\nof my friends who was to present me at a house where, according to\r\nwhat he told me, I should see a world of pretty women--a collection\r\nof flesh and blood idealities--the wherewithal to satisfy a score\r\nof poets.--There are some there to suit all tastes:--aristocratic\r\nbeauties with eagle glances, sea-green eyes, straight noses, chins\r\nhaughtily elevated, queenly hands, and the gait of a goddess; silver\r\nlilies mounted upon golden stalks;--modest violets, pale of hue, sweet\r\nof perfume, with melting, downcast eyes, slender neck, transparent\r\nflesh;--animated, piquant beauties; devout beauties, beauties of all\r\nsorts;--for the house is a genuine seraglio, minus the eunuchs and the\r\nKislar aga.--My friend tells me that he has already had five or six\r\naffairs there--quite as many as that;--that seemed to me a prodigious\r\nrecord and I am very much afraid that I shall not have the like\r\nsuccess; De C---- says yes, and that I shall succeed much better than\r\nI shall care to. According to him I have only one fault, which I am\r\ncertain to correct as I grow older and go more into society--he says I\r\nthink too much of woman and not enough of women.--It may well be that\r\nthere\'s some truth in that.--He says that I will be perfectly lovable\r\nwhen I rid myself of that little failing. God grant it! It must be that\r\nwomen feel that I despise them; for a compliment, which they would\r\nconsider adorable and delightful to the last degree in the mouth of\r\nanother, in mine displeases them and makes them angry, as if it were\r\nthe most savage epigram. That probably has something to do with the\r\nfault De C---- refers to.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat a little faster as I went up the stairs, and I had\r\nbarely recovered from my emotion when De C----, taking me by the\r\nelbow, brought me face to face with a woman of about thirty--not\r\nill-looking--dressed with dissembled magnificence and extreme\r\naffectation of childlike simplicity--which did not prevent her being\r\ndaubed with rouge like a carriage-wheel:--it was the lady of the house.\r\n\r\nDe C----, assuming the shrill, mocking voice which is so different from\r\nhis ordinary voice, and which he uses in society when he wants to be\r\nfascinating, said to her, half aloud, with abundant demonstrations of\r\nironical respect, in which the most profound contempt could plainly be\r\ndetected:\r\n\r\n"This is the young man of whom I spoke to you the other day--a man of\r\nvery distinguished merit; he is of unexceptionable birth and I think\r\nthat it cannot be otherwise than agreeable to you to receive him; that\r\nis why I have taken the liberty to present him to you."\r\n\r\n"Assuredly, monsieur, you have done well," rejoined the lady, with\r\na most outrageously affected manner. Then she turned to me, and\r\nafter looking me over out of the corner of her eye, like a clever\r\nconnoisseur, and in a way that made me blush to my ears, she said: "You\r\nmay consider yourself invited once for all, and come as often as you\r\nhave an evening to waste."\r\n\r\nI bowed awkwardly enough, and stammered a few disconnected words which\r\ncould not have given her a very exalted opinion of my talents; other\r\npersons came in and I was delivered from the ennui inseparable from an\r\nintroduction. De C---- led me to a window recess and began to lecture\r\nme vigorously.\r\n\r\n"What the devil! you will get me into a scrape; I announced you as a\r\nperfect ph\xc5\x93nix of wit, a man of unbridled imagination, a lyric poet,\r\neverything that is most transcendent and impassioned, and you stand\r\nthere like a ninny without lisping a word. What a wretched imagination!\r\nI thought your vein was more fruitful; come, come, give your tongue\r\nthe rein, chatter away through thick and thin; you don\'t need to say\r\nsensible, judicious things, on the contrary, they might injure your\r\nchances; talk, that\'s the main thing; talk fast, talk all the time;\r\nattract attention to yourself; throw aside all fear and all modesty;\r\nfix it firmly in your head that all who are here are fools, or almost\r\nthat, and don\'t forget that an orator who wants to succeed cannot\r\ndespise his audience enough.--What do you think of the mistress of the\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\n"I dislike her very much already; and although I talked with her hardly\r\nthree minutes, I was as bored as if I were her husband."\r\n\r\n"Aha! that\'s what you think of her, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes."\r\n\r\n"Is your repugnance for her altogether insurmountable?--So much the\r\nworse; it would have been decent for you to have her, if only for a\r\nmonth; it\'s good form, and a young man with a little money can\'t get\r\ninto society except through her."\r\n\r\n"Very good! I\'ll have her," I said piteously, "since it must be; but is\r\nit as necessary as you seem to think?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! yes, it is absolutely indispensable, and I will tell you why.\r\nMadame de Th\xc3\xa9mines is the fashion now; she has all the absurd foibles\r\nof the day in a superior way,--sometimes those of to-morrow, but never\r\nyesterday\'s: she is thoroughly posted. People will wear what she\r\nwears, and she never wears what any one else has worn. She is rich,\r\ntoo, and her carriages are in the best taste.--She has no wit, but\r\nmuch small-talk; she has very keen fancies and little passion. People\r\namuse her but do not move her; she has a cold heart and a dissolute\r\nhead. As for her soul--if she has one, which is doubtful--it is of\r\nthe blackest, and there is no malice and baseness of which she is\r\nnot capable; but she is extremely adroit and keeps up appearances,\r\njust what is necessary to prevent anything being proved against her.\r\nFor instance, she will lie with a man, but she will never write him\r\nthe simplest kind of a note. Thus her most intimate enemies can find\r\nnothing to say against her except that she applies too much rouge and\r\nthat certain parts of her person are not, in fact, so well rounded as\r\nthey seem to be--which is false."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"What a question!--how does one know that sort of thing except by\r\nfinding out for himself?"\r\n\r\n"Then you have had Madame de Th\xc3\xa9mines?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I have! Why shouldn\'t I have had her? It would have been\r\nmost unseemly of me not to have her.--She has done me some very great\r\nfavors, and I am very grateful to her for them."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand what kind of favors she can have done you."\r\n\r\n"Are you really a fool?" said De C----, gazing at me with the most\r\ncomical expression imaginable.--"Faith, I am much afraid of it;\r\nmust I tell you everything? Madame de Th\xc3\xa9mines is considered, and\r\njustly, to have special information in certain directions, and a young\r\nman whom she has taken and kept for some time can present himself\r\nboldly anywhere, and be sure that he won\'t be long without having\r\nan affair--more likely two than one.--Aside from that ineffable\r\nadvantage, there is another hardly less great; and that is that, as\r\nsoon as the female members of this circle see that you are Madame de\r\nTh\xc3\xa9mines\' official lover, even though they have not the slightest\r\ntaste for you, they will consider it a pleasure and a duty to take you\r\naway from a fashionable woman like her; and, instead of the advances\r\nand man\xc5\x93uvres you would otherwise have to make, you will have an\r\nembarrassment of riches, and you will necessarily become the focus of\r\nall imaginable cajoleries and blandishments.\r\n\r\n"However, if she arouses too strong a repugnance in you, don\'t take\r\nher. You are not exactly obliged to do it, although that would be\r\ncourteous and proper. But make your choice quickly and attack the one\r\nwho pleases you best or seems to offer the most facilities, for by\r\ndelaying you will lose the benefit of novelty, and the advantage it\r\ngives you over all the men here for a few days. All these ladies have\r\nno conception of the passions that are born in private intercourse and\r\ndevelop gradually in respect and silence; they are all for lightning\r\nstrokes and occult sympathies; a wonderfully well-conceived scheme\r\nto avoid the ennui of resistance and all the long and wearisome\r\nrepetitions that sentiment mingles with the romance of love, and\r\nwhich serve only to defer the conclusion to no purpose.--These ladies\r\nare very saving of their time, and it seems so valuable to them\r\nthat they would be in despair at the thought of leaving a single\r\nmoment unemployed.--They have a craving to oblige the human race\r\nwhich one cannot praise too highly, and they love their neighbor as\r\nthemselves--which is most meritorious and perfectly angelic; they are\r\nvery charitable creatures who would not, for anything in the world,\r\ndrive a man to die of despair.\r\n\r\n"There must be three or four of them already who are _impressed_ in\r\nyour favor, and I advise you as a friend to press your advantage warmly\r\nin that direction, instead of amusing yourself prattling with me in a\r\nwindow-recess, which will not materially assist your prospects."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear C----, I am altogether green in such matters, I haven\'t\r\nthe necessary experience of society to distinguish at first glance\r\na woman who is impressed from one who isn\'t; and I might make some\r\nstrange blunders unless you will assist me with your experience."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you are a primitive creature without a name, and I\r\ndidn\'t suppose it was possible to be so pastoral and bucolic in the\r\nblessed age we live in!--What the devil are you doing with that pair of\r\ngreat black eyes of yours, which would produce a most stunning effect\r\nif you knew how to use them?\r\n\r\n"Just look over yonder, in the corner by the fire-place, at that little\r\nwoman in pink playing with her fan: she has been staring at you for\r\na quarter of an hour with most significant assiduity and fixity; no\r\none in the world but she can be indecent in so superior a fashion and\r\ndisplay such noble insolence. The women don\'t like her at all, for\r\nthey despair of ever reaching that height of impudence, but, on the\r\nother hand, she is very popular with the men who find in her all the\r\npiquant flavor of the courtesan.--To be sure, her depravity is of a\r\nfascinating sort, she is full of wit and impulse and caprice.--She\'s an\r\nexcellent mistress for a young man who has prejudices.--Within a week\r\nshe will rid your conscience of all scruples and corrupt your heart to\r\nsuch an extent that you will never make yourself ridiculous or indulge\r\nin elegiacs. She has incredibly positive ideas on every subject;\r\nshe goes to the bottom of everything with astonishing rapidity and\r\naccuracy of insight. The little woman is the incarnation of algebra;\r\nshe is precisely what a dreamer and an enthusiast needs. She will soon\r\ncure you of your misty idealism: therein she will render you a great\r\nservice. She will do it with the greatest pleasure, however, for her\r\ninstinct leads her to disenchant poets."\r\n\r\nMy curiosity being aroused by De C----\'s description, I emerged from\r\nmy retreat, and, gliding from group to group, approached the lady in\r\nquestion and observed her closely,--she may have been twenty-five\r\nor twenty-six years old. She was small, but well shaped, although a\r\nlittle inclined to be stout; she had round, white arms, well-formed\r\nhands and pretty feet, almost too small,--plump, polished shoulders,\r\nbreast but little exposed, but what there was, very satisfactory and\r\naffording a favorable idea of the rest; her hair was extremely glossy\r\nand of a blue-black shade like a jay\'s wing; the corner of the eye\r\nwas turned well up toward the temple, nose thin, nostrils very open,\r\nmouth moist and sensuous, a little crease on the lower lip and an\r\nalmost imperceptible down at the corners. And with it all, vivacity,\r\nanimation, health, and an indefinable suggestion of wantonness adroitly\r\ntempered by coquetry and tact, which made her a very desirable creature\r\nand more than justified the very lively passions she had inspired and\r\ncontinued to inspire every day.\r\n\r\nI desired her; but yet I understood that that woman, agreeable as she\r\nmight be, was not my ideal, or could make me say: "At last I have a\r\nmistress!"\r\n\r\nI returned to De C---- and said: "I like her looks, and perhaps I may\r\ncome to an understanding with her. But, before saying anything definite\r\nwhich will bind me, I would be very glad if you would have the kindness\r\nto point out those indulgent beauties who are so condescending as to be\r\nimpressed with me, so that I may make my choice.--You will also oblige\r\nme, as you are acting as showman on this occasion, by adding a little\r\ndescriptive notice and a list of their good and bad qualities; how I\r\nmust attack them and the tone I must adopt with them in order not to\r\nseem too much like a provincial or a literary man."\r\n\r\n"I most certainly will," said De C----. "Do you see that lovely,\r\nmelancholy swan who manages her neck so gracefully and makes her\r\nsleeves move like wings? she is modesty itself, the most chaste and\r\nvirginal creature in the world; she has a snow-white brow, a heart\r\nof ice, the expression of a madonna, the smile of an Agnes; she has\r\na white dress and a soul of the same color; she wears nothing but\r\norange-blossoms or water-lily leaves in her hair, and is attached to\r\nearth only by a thread. She has never had an evil thought and has no\r\nidea wherein man differs from woman. The Blessed Virgin is a Bacchante\r\nbeside her, all of which does not prevent her having had more lovers\r\nthan any woman I know, and that is certainly saying a good deal.\r\nJust cast your eye on that discreet person\'s throat; it is a little\r\nmasterpiece, and really it is very difficult to show so much without\r\nshowing more; tell me if, with all her reserve and all her prudery,\r\nshe isn\'t ten times more indecent than that good lady at her left, who\r\nbravely displays two hemispheres which, if they were united, would form\r\na life-size globe,--or the other one at her right, _d\xc3\xa9collet\xc3\xa9e_ to the\r\nnavel, who parades her nothingness with fascinating intrepidity?--That\r\nvirginal creature, unless I am very much mistaken, has already figured\r\nout in her head how much love and passion your pallor and your black\r\neyes may be taken to promise; and my reason for saying so is that she\r\nhasn\'t once looked in your direction, visibly at least; for she can\r\nmanage her pupils with such art and roll them into the corner of her\r\neyes so cleverly that nothing escapes her; one would think that she\r\nlooked through the back of her head, for she knows perfectly well what\r\nis going on behind her.--She\'s a female Janus.--If you want to succeed\r\nwith her, you must lay aside anything like a free-and-easy, victorious\r\nmanner. You must talk to her without looking at her, without moving,\r\nin a contrite attitude and in a subdued, respectful voice; in that way\r\nyou can say whatever you choose to her, provided that it is suitably\r\nglossed over, and she will allow you to take the greatest liberties,\r\nat first in words; afterward in deeds. Simply take care to roll your\r\neyes tenderly when hers are cast down, and talk to her about the joys\r\nof platonic love and the communion of souls, while you employ with her\r\nthe least platonic and least ideal pantomime imaginable! She is very\r\nsensual and very sensitive; kiss her as often as you choose, but don\'t\r\nforget, even in the most intimate intercourse, to call her _madame_ at\r\nleast three times per sentence: she fell out with me, because, when I\r\nwas in her bed, I said something or other to her and called her _thou_.\r\nWhat the devil! a woman is not virtuous for nothing!"\r\n\r\n"After what you tell me I have no great desire to try my luck. A\r\nprudish Messalina! an entirely novel and monstrous combination."\r\n\r\n"Old as the world, my dear boy! it is seen every day and nothing is\r\nmore common.--You are wrong not to try your hand with her.--She has one\r\ngreat charm, which is that with her you always seem to be committing a\r\ndeadly sin, and the least kiss seems altogether damnable; while with\r\nothers you think of it as nothing more than a venial sin, and often you\r\ndon\'t think you\'re doing anything wrong at all.--That is why I kept her\r\nlonger than any other mistress.--I should have her still if she had not\r\nleft me herself; she\'s the only woman who ever got ahead of me, and I\r\nlook upon her with a certain amount of respect on that account.--She\r\nhas the most delicate little refinements of pleasure and the great art\r\nof appearing to be forced to grant what she grants very freely; which\r\ngives to each of her favors the fascination of rape. You will find in\r\nsociety ten of her lovers who will swear to you that she is one of the\r\nmost virtuous creatures on earth.--She is precisely the contrary.--It\r\nis an interesting study to analyze that virtue of hers on a pillow.\r\nBeing forewarned, you run no risk, and you won\'t make the blunder of\r\nfalling in love with her in earnest."\r\n\r\n"How old is this adorable creature?" I asked De C----, for it was\r\nimpossible to decide, even after examining her with the most careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"Ah! there you are! how old is she? that\'s a mystery and God only knows\r\nthe clue. For my own part, and I pride myself on telling a woman\'s age\r\nalmost to a minute, I have never succeeded in finding out hers. I can\r\nonly estimate approximately that she is somewhere between eighteen\r\nand thirty-six.--I have seen her in full dress, in d\xc3\xa9shabille, in her\r\nlinen, and I can tell you nothing in that connection: my knowledge is\r\nat fault; the age that you would generally take her to be is eighteen,\r\nand yet that can\'t be her age.--She is a combination of a virgin body\r\nand the soul of a harlot, and she must have had much time or much\r\ngenius to corrupt herself so thoroughly and so speciously; she must\r\nhave a heart of brass in a breast of steel; but she has neither; that\r\nmakes me think that she is thirty-six, but in reality I know nothing\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t she any intimate friend who could enlighten you on the subject?"\r\n\r\n"No; she arrived here two years ago. She came from the provinces or\r\nfrom abroad, I don\'t know which--that is an admirable position for a\r\nwoman who knows how to make the most of it. With such a face as she\r\nhas, she can make herself any age she chooses and date only from the\r\nday she arrived here."\r\n\r\n"That certainly is a most agreeable state of things, especially when\r\nsome impertinent wrinkle doesn\'t give you the lie, and Time, the great\r\ndestroyer, is kind enough to connive at that falsification of the\r\ncertificate of baptism."\r\n\r\nHe pointed out several others, who, he said, would receive favorably\r\nwhatever requests it might please me to prefer to them, and would\r\ntreat me with peculiar philanthropy. But the woman in pink in the\r\nchimney-corner and the modest dove who was her antithesis were\r\nincomparably superior to all the others; and, if they had not all the\r\nqualities I require, they had some of them, at least in appearance.\r\n\r\nI talked all the evening with them, especially with the last, and I\r\ntook pains to cast my ideas in the most respectful mould;--although\r\nshe hardly looked at me, I fancied sometimes that I could see her eyes\r\ngleaming behind the curtain of their lashes, and at some compliments\r\nthat I ventured to address to her, decidedly broad but shrouded in\r\nthe most modest gauze, I noticed just below the skin a tiny blush,\r\nheld back and stifled, not unlike the effect produced by pouring a\r\nred liqueur into a glass that is half opaque.--Her replies were, in\r\ngeneral, sedate and well-weighed, but keen and bright, and they implied\r\nmuch more than they expressed. The whole conversation was interspersed\r\nwith pauses, unfinished phrases; veiled allusions, every syllable had\r\nits meaning, every pause its bearing; nothing could be more diplomatic\r\nor more charming.--And yet, however great my pleasure in it for the\r\nmoment, I could not endure such a conversation very long. One must\r\nbe forever on the alert and on his guard, and what I like best in\r\nconversation is ease, familiarity.--We talked first of music, which led\r\nus naturally to speak of the Opera, then of women, and then of love,\r\na subject in which it is easier than in any other to find excuses for\r\ntransition from general principles to special instances.--We vied with\r\neach other in amatory talk; you would have laughed to hear me. Verily,\r\nAmadis on poor La Roche was no better than a dull pedant beside me.\r\nIt was generosity, abnegation, self-sacrifice enough to put the late\r\nCurtius of Rome to the blush.--Really I didn\'t believe myself capable\r\nof such transcendent humbug and bathos. Can you imagine anything more\r\nridiculous, a more perfect scene for a comedy, than myself indulging in\r\nthe quintessence of platonism? And then my sugary manner, my demure,\r\nhypocritical little ways! _tubleu_! I looked as if I could never touch\r\nanything, and any mother who had heard me argue wouldn\'t have hesitated\r\nto let me lie with her daughter, any husband would have trusted his\r\nwife with me. It was the one evening in all my life when I seemed to be\r\nmost virtuous and was least so. I thought it was more difficult than\r\nthat to be a hypocrite and say things one doesn\'t believe. It must be\r\nvery easy or else I must be strongly predisposed that way, to have\r\nsucceeded so satisfactorily at the first trial.--Really I have some\r\ninspired moments.\r\n\r\nAs for the lady, she made many remarks, very shrewdly worded, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the innocent air with which she made them, denoted\r\na very extensive experience; you can\'t conceive the subtlety of her\r\ndistinctions. The woman would split a hair in three pieces lengthwise,\r\nand make fools of all the angelic and seraphic pundits that ever were.\r\nIndeed, from her way of talking, it was impossible to believe that she\r\nhas the shadow of a body.--It is all immaterial, vaporous, ideal enough\r\nto break your arms; and if De C---- had not warned me beforehand of\r\nthe creature\'s man\xc5\x93uvring, I should certainly have despaired of the\r\nsuccess of my undertaking, and stood shamefacedly aside. How in the\r\ndevil, when a woman tells you for two hours, with the most indifferent\r\nair you can imagine, that love lives only on privation and sacrifice\r\nand other fine things of that sort, can you decently hope to persuade\r\nher to get between two sheets with you some day to stir your blood and\r\nsee if you are made alike?\r\n\r\nIn short, we parted the best of friends, mutually congratulating each\r\nother on the elevation and purity of our sentiments.\r\n\r\nMy conversation with the other was, as you will imagine, of a very\r\ndifferent tenor. We laughed as much as we talked. We made fun, and very\r\nwittily too, of all the women there. When I say: "We made fun, and very\r\nwittily too," I am wrong; I ought to say: "She made fun;" a man never\r\nmakes fun of a woman. I listened and approved, for it is impossible to\r\ndraw with more telling strokes or to apply colors more brilliantly; it\r\nwas the most interesting gallery of caricatures that I have ever seen.\r\nIn spite of the exaggeration, you felt the truth underneath; De C----\r\nwas quite right; that woman\'s mission is to destroy the illusions of\r\npoets. There is an atmosphere of prose about her in which a poetic idea\r\ncannot live. She is charming, sparkling with wit, and yet when you are\r\nwith her you think only of base, vulgar things; as I talked to her I\r\nfelt a crowd of desires, incongruous and impracticable in that place;\r\nI felt like ordering wine and getting tipsy, taking her on my knee\r\nand kissing her neck--like lifting up her skirt to see if her garter\r\nwas above or below the knee, like singing an obscene song at the top\r\nof my voice, smoking a pipe or smashing the windows: the devil knows\r\nwhat.--All the animal, all the brute rose in me; I would willingly\r\nhave spat on Homer\'s Iliad and thrown myself on my knees before a\r\nham.--I understand perfectly to-day the allegory of Circe changing the\r\ncompanions of Ulysses to swine. Circe was probably a wanton like my\r\nlittle woman in pink.\r\n\r\nIt is a shameful thing to say, but I felt a keen delight in the\r\nconsciousness that the brute nature was gaining the upper hand; I did\r\nnot resist it, I assisted it with all my strength, corruption is so\r\nnatural to man and there is so much mud in the clay of which he is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter II--_My conversation with the other was, as\r\nyou will imagine, of a very different tenor. We laughed as much as we\r\ntalked. We made fun, and very wittily too, of all the women there._]\r\n\r\nAnd yet I was afraid for a minute of the gangrene that was gaining upon\r\nme, and I tried to leave my corrupter; but the floor seemed to have\r\nrisen to my knees, and I was as if riveted to my place.\r\n\r\nAt last I made a determined effort and left her, and, it being then\r\nvery late, I returned home in dire perplexity, very much disturbed in\r\nmind and with none too clear an idea what I ought to do.--I wavered\r\nbetween the prude and the wanton.--I found piquancy in the one,\r\nsensuousness in the other; and after a very close and very thorough\r\nexamination of my conscience I discovered, not that I loved them both,\r\nbut that I desired them both, one as much as the other, with sufficient\r\neagerness to indulge in reverie and preoccupation.\r\n\r\nAccording to all appearances, O my friend! I shall have one of those\r\ntwo women, perhaps I shall have them both, and yet I confess that I\r\nam only half satisfied by possessing them; it isn\'t that they\'re not\r\nvery pretty, but at sight of them nothing cried out within me, nothing\r\nthrobbed, nothing said: "It is they;"--I did not recognize them.--And\r\nyet I don\'t imagine that I shall find any one much better off in the\r\nway of birth and beauty, and De C---- advises me to try my hand with\r\nthem. Most certainly I shall do it, and one or the other shall be my\r\nmistress before long or may the devil fly away with me; but way down in\r\nmy heart a still small voice reproaches me for lying to my love and for\r\npausing thus at the first smile of a woman I do not love, instead of\r\nseeking untiringly through the world, in cloisters and all sorts of bad\r\nplaces, in palaces and taverns, the woman who was made for me and whom\r\nGod destines for me, be she princess or serving-maid, nun or courtesan.\r\n\r\nThen I say to myself that I am indulging in chimeras, and that it\'s\r\nvery much the same after all, whether I lie with that woman or another,\r\nthat the earth will not swerve a hair\'s breadth from its course, and\r\nthat the seasons will not change their order on that account; that\r\nnothing in the world is more indifferent to me, and that I am very\r\nsimple to torment myself about such trifles: that is what I say to\r\nmyself.--But it\'s of no use for me to talk, I am not a whit more easy\r\nin my mind or more decided.\r\n\r\nIt may be because I live much alone and the smallest details take on\r\ntoo much importance in a life so monotonous as mine. I give too much\r\nheed to my living and thinking: I hear the throbbing of my arteries,\r\nthe beating of my heart; by dint of close attention I disengage my most\r\nintangible ideas from the confused haze in which they float, and give\r\nthem a body.--If I had more to do I should not notice all these trivial\r\nthings and should not have time to look at my heart under a microscope,\r\nas I do all day long. The din of action would drive away this swarm\r\nof indolent thoughts that are flying about in my head and deafening\r\nme with the buzzing of their wings: instead of pursuing phantoms I\r\nshould come to blows with realities; I should ask women for nothing\r\nbeyond what they can give--pleasure--and I should not try to embrace\r\nsome fanciful ideal decked out in hazy perfections.--This desperate\r\ntension of the eye of my heart toward an invisible object has impaired\r\nmy sight. I am unable to see what is, from having stared at what is\r\nnot, and my eye, so keen for the ideal, is terribly short-sighted for\r\nthe real; so that I have known women whom everybody declared to be\r\nmost ravishing creatures, but who seemed to me very far from that. I\r\nhave greatly admired pictures generally considered to be daubs, and\r\nfantastic or unintelligible verses have given me more pleasure than\r\nthe most courtly productions.--I should not be at all astonished if,\r\nafter addressing so many sighs to the moon and looking at the stars\r\nwith strained gaze, after perpetrating so many elegies and sentimental\r\napostrophes, I should fall in love with some vile girl from the street,\r\nor some ugly old woman; that would be a great come-down!--Reality\r\nwill perhaps take its revenge thus for the little care I have taken\r\nto pay court to it:--wouldn\'t it be a fine thing if I should conceive\r\na romantic passion for a scullery wench or a low, dirty trollop? Can\r\nyou imagine me playing a guitar under a kitchen window and supplanted\r\nby a lackey carrying an old toothless dowager\'s pet cur?--Or perhaps,\r\nfinding nothing in this world worthy of my love, I shall end by adoring\r\nmyself, like the late Narcissus of selfish memory. To protect myself\r\nfrom such a great disaster, I look at myself in every mirror and in\r\nall the streams I pass. To tell the truth, as a result of musing and\r\nmental wandering I am terribly afraid of being led into something\r\nmonstrous and unnatural. That is a serious matter and I must be on my\r\nguard.--Adieu, my friend;--I am going at once to call on the pink lady,\r\nfor fear of relapsing into my usual state of meditation. I do not think\r\nthat we shall trouble ourselves very much about actualities, and if we\r\ndo anything it surely won\'t be in a spiritual direction, although she\r\nis very spirituelle. I carefully roll up and put away in a drawer the\r\npattern of my ideal mistress in order not to try it upon this one. I\r\npropose to enjoy tranquilly such good qualities and merits as she has.\r\nI propose to leave her in a dress adapted to her figure, and not to try\r\nto fit clothes to her that I have cut out, in case of emergency, for\r\nthe lady of my thoughts.--Those are very prudent resolutions, but I\r\ndon\'t know whether I shall keep to them.--Once more, adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the titular lover of the pink lady; that is almost a profession,\r\nan office, and it gives a man a firm footing in society. I no longer\r\nlook like a scholar seeking a mistress among a parcel of grandmothers\r\nand afraid to sing a love-song to a woman unless she\'s a hundred\r\nyears old; I notice, since my installation, that I receive much more\r\nconsideration, that all the women talk to me with jealous coquetry and\r\ngo out of their way to smile on me.--The men, on the other hand, are\r\ncolder, and in the few words we exchange there is a touch of hostility\r\nand constraint; they feel that they have in me an enemy already\r\nformidable, who may become much more so.--I have heard that many of\r\nthem had bitterly criticised my way of carrying myself and said that my\r\nstyle of dress was too effeminate; that my hair was curled and anointed\r\nwith more care than beseemed me; that that fact, taken in connection\r\nwith my beardless face, gave me a most absurd girlish appearance; that\r\nI affected rich materials that smelt of the stage, and that I looked\r\nmore like an actor than a man: a parcel of trite, sneering remarks,\r\nintended to justify themselves in being dirty and wearing wretched,\r\nill-fitting clothes. But all this serves only to make me the whiter,\r\nand all the ladies consider that my hair is the finest in the world,\r\nand that the niceties of my toilet are in the best taste, and they\r\nseem strongly disposed to make up to me for all that I spend for\r\ntheir benefit, for they are not fools enough to believe that all that\r\nelegance has no other aim than my own private embellishment.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house seemed at first a little offended at my choice,\r\nwhich she thought must inevitably fall upon herself, and for some days\r\nshe was decidedly sour--to her rival only, for there was no change in\r\nher manner to me--her spleen manifesting itself in divers little "My\r\ndears," uttered in that dry, abrupt tone that women alone can master,\r\nand in certain uncomplimentary remarks concerning her costume, made\r\nin as loud a voice as possible, such as: "Your hair is done too high\r\nand not at all to correspond with your face," or: "Your waist bags\r\nunder the arms; who in the world made that dress?" or: "You have black\r\nrings under your eyes; it seems to me you are much changed;" and a\r\nthousand other trivial observations to which the other did not fail to\r\nretort with all desirable malignity when opportunity offered; and if\r\nthe opportunity was too slow in offering she made one for her own use\r\nand returned, with interest, what she had received. But soon, another\r\nobject having distracted the attention of the slighted princess, the\r\nlittle war of words ceased and everything resumed its usual order.\r\n\r\nI said baldly that I was the pink lady\'s titular lover; that is not\r\nenough for so accurate a man as you are. You will undoubtedly ask\r\nme what her name is: as for that, I shall not tell you; but, if you\r\nchoose, to shorten the story and in memory of the color of the dress in\r\nwhich I first saw her, we will call her Rosette; it\'s a pretty name; my\r\nlittle dog has the same name.\r\n\r\nYou would like to know from point to point, for you love exactness in\r\nall things, the story of our love-affairs with this fair Bradamante,\r\nand by what successive steps I passed from the general to the\r\nparticular and from the condition of simple spectator to that of actor;\r\nhow, after being one of the audience, I became the lover. I will\r\ngratify your desire with the very greatest pleasure. There is nothing\r\nunpleasant in our romance; it is all rose-colored, and no tears are\r\nshed except tears of pleasure; you will find no long descriptions or\r\nrepetitions, and everything moves on toward the end with the haste\r\nand speed so urgently recommended by Horace;--it is a genuine French\r\nromance.--Do not imagine, however, that I carried the citadel at the\r\nfirst assault. The princess, although very humane to her subjects, is\r\nnot as lavish of her favors at first, as you might think; she knows\r\ntheir value too well not to make you purchase them; she also knows\r\ntoo well how a judicious delay sharpens the appetite and what relish\r\na semi-resistance adds to the pleasure, to abandon herself to you at\r\nfirst, however keen the inclination you have aroused in her.\r\n\r\nTo tell the whole story at length, I must go back a little. I gave you\r\na very circumstantial account of our first interview. I had one or two,\r\nperhaps three others in the same house, and then she invited me to call\r\non her; I did not make her repeat the invitation, as you can believe;\r\nI went there at discreet intervals at first, then a little more\r\nfrequently, then still more so, and finally whenever the fancy seized\r\nme, and I must confess that it seized me at least three or four times a\r\nday.--The lady, after we had been parted a few hours, always received\r\nme as if I had just returned from the East Indies; which fact touched\r\nme as much as anything could and impelled me to show my gratitude in a\r\nmarked manner by the most gallant and tenderest words you can imagine,\r\nto which she replied as best she could.\r\n\r\nRosette--as we have agreed to call her that--is a very bright woman and\r\nhas a most admirable appreciation of man; although she postponed the\r\nend of the chapter for some time, I did not once lose my temper with\r\nher: which is really marvellous, for you know how I fly into a passion\r\nwhen I don\'t get what I want on the instant, and when a woman goes\r\nbeyond the time I have mentally allowed her in which to surrender.--I\r\nhave no idea how she did it at the first interview; she gave me to\r\nunderstand that I should have her, and I was surer of her than if I had\r\nhad her written promise signed by her hand. You will say perhaps that\r\nher bold and free-and-easy manners left the field free to rash hopes.\r\nI do not think that that is the real motive: I have seen some women\r\nwhose prodigious freedom of manner excluded the last vestige of doubt,\r\nwho did not produce that effect upon me, and in whose presence I was\r\nconscious of a timidity and uneasiness that were, to say the least,\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\nThe result is, generally speaking, that I am less amiable with the\r\nwoman I long to possess than with those who are indifferent to me;\r\nit is because of the excitement of waiting for an opportunity and my\r\nuncertainty as to the success of my project; that makes me gloomy and\r\ncasts me into a fit of musing which takes away much of my power of\r\npleasing and my presence of mind. When I see the hours I had set aside\r\nfor another purpose passing one by one, I am filled with anger in spite\r\nof myself, and I cannot keep from saying very sharp, harsh things,\r\nwhich sometimes go as far as brutality and put my affair back a hundred\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nWith Rosette I had no such feeling; never, even at the moment when she\r\nresisted me most stubbornly, did I have the idea that she wanted to\r\nescape from my love. I calmly allowed her to display all her little\r\ncoquetries, and I endured in patience the overlong delays to which it\r\npleased her to subject my ardor; there was something smiling in her\r\nharshness that consoled you for it as much as possible, and in her most\r\nHyrcanian cruelties you could distinguish a background of humanity that\r\nmade it impossible for you to have any very serious fear.--Virtuous\r\nwomen, even when they are not really virtuous at all, have a crabbed,\r\ndisdainful way which is perfectly unendurable to me. They have the\r\nair of being always ready to ring and order their footmen to put you\r\nout; and it seems to me, really, that a man who takes the trouble to\r\npay court to a woman--and it isn\'t always as agreeable as you may\r\nthink--doesn\'t deserve to be looked at in that way.\r\n\r\nDear Rosette has no such glances as that, not she; and I assure you\r\nthat she doesn\'t lose anything by it; she is the only woman with whom\r\nI have ever been myself, and I am conceited enough to say that I have\r\nnever been so agreeable. My wit has displayed itself freely; and, by\r\nthe skill and fire of her retorts, she has led me to discover more than\r\nI had any idea that I possessed, and more perhaps than I really do\r\npossess.--To be sure, I haven\'t done much in the way of lyrics--that\r\nis hardly possible with her; it is not that she has no poetic side,\r\nnotwithstanding what De C---- said of her; but she is so full of life\r\nand strength and movement, she seems to be so well placed in her\r\npresent surroundings, that one has no desire to leave them for a flight\r\namong the clouds. She fills one\'s real life so pleasantly and makes of\r\nit something so entertaining to herself and others, that reverie has\r\nnothing better to offer you.\r\n\r\nA miraculous thing! I have known her nearly two months, and in those\r\ntwo months the only times I have been bored have been when I was not\r\nwith her. You will agree that she can be no inferior woman to produce\r\nsuch a result, for women usually produce exactly the opposite effect on\r\nme and are much more agreeable to me at a distance than near at hand.\r\n\r\nRosette has the best disposition in the world, with men I mean, for\r\nwith women she\'s as wicked as a devil; she is bright, lively, alert,\r\nready for anything, very original in her way of speaking, and has\r\nalways some charming nonsense to tell you that you don\'t expect; she\r\nis a delightful companion, a jolly comrade with whom you sleep, rather\r\nthan a mistress; and if I were a few years older and had fewer romantic\r\nideas, I should be perfectly satisfied, indeed I should deem myself\r\nthe most fortunate mortal on earth. But--but--that conjunction implies\r\nnothing good, and unfortunately that little devil of a restrictive word\r\nis the one most frequently employed in all human tongues;--but I am an\r\nimbecile, an idiot, a downright booby, never content with anything and\r\nalways hunting mares\' nests; and, instead of being altogether happy, I\r\nam only half so;--half, that is a good deal for this world, and yet I\r\nfind it not enough.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the world I have a mistress whom several desire and envy\r\nme, and whom no one would disdain. My desire is gratified, therefore,\r\nin appearance, and I no longer have the right to pick a quarrel with\r\nfate. However, it seems to me that I have no mistress; I can convince\r\nmyself that I have by arguing it out, but I do not feel it, and if\r\nanybody should ask me unexpectedly if I had one, I think I should\r\nanswer no.--However, the possession of a woman who has beauty, youth,\r\nand wit, constitutes what, in all times and in all countries, has\r\nbeen and still is called having a mistress, and I think there is no\r\nother way. That doesn\'t prevent my having the strangest doubts in that\r\nconnection, and it has gone so far that if several people should unite\r\nto convince me that I am not Rosette\'s favored lover, I should end by\r\nbelieving them in the face of the palpable evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nDo not think from what I say that I do not love her or that she is\r\ndispleasing to me in any way; on the contrary, I am very fond of her\r\nand I see in her what everybody else would see in her: a pretty,\r\nalluring creature. I simply do not feel that I possess her, that is\r\nall. And yet no woman ever gave me so much pleasure, and if I have ever\r\nknown bliss, it has been in her arms.--A single one of her kisses, the\r\nmost chaste of her caresses makes me shiver to the soles of my feet\r\nand sends all my blood back to my heart. Explain it all if you can.\r\nThe facts, however, are as I tell them to you. But the human heart is\r\nfull of such absurdities; and if we were obliged to reconcile all the\r\ncontradictions it exhibits, we should have a heavy task on our hands.\r\n\r\nHow does it happen? Verily, I have no idea.\r\n\r\nI see her all day, and all night too, if I choose. I bestow as many\r\ncaresses on her as I please; I have her naked or dressed, in town or\r\nin the country. Her good humor is inexhaustible, and she enters heart\r\nand soul into my whims however eccentric they may be; one evening the\r\nfancy seized me to possess her in the middle of the salon, with all the\r\ncandles lighted, the fire blazing on the hearth, the chairs arranged\r\nin a circle as if for a grand evening reception, she, in a _toilette\r\nde bal_ with her bouquet and her fan, all her diamonds on her fingers\r\nand her neck, feathers in her hair--the most magnificent costume\r\nimaginable--and I dressed like a bear; she consented.--When everything\r\nwas ready, the servants were greatly surprised to receive orders to\r\nclose the doors and admit no one; they acted as if they had not the\r\nslightest comprehension of what it all meant, and went away with a\r\ndazed look that made us laugh heartily. They certainly thought that\r\ntheir mistress was stark mad; but what they thought or did not think\r\nmattered little to us.\r\n\r\nThat was the most burlesque evening of my whole life. Can you imagine\r\nthe appearance I must have presented with my hat and feather under my\r\npaw, rings on every claw, a little silver-hilted sword and a sky-blue\r\nribbon on its hilt? I approached the fair one, and, having made her\r\na most graceful reverence, sat down beside her and besieged her in\r\ndue form. The flattering madrigals, the exaggerated compliments I\r\naddressed to her, all the jargon suited to the occasion assumed a\r\nstrange significance in passing through my bear\'s muzzle; for I had\r\na superb head of painted cardboard which I was soon obliged to throw\r\nunder the table, my deity was so adorable that evening, and I longed\r\nso to kiss her hand and something better than her hand. The skin soon\r\nfollowed the head; for not being accustomed to play the bear, I was\r\nstifled in it, more so than was necessary. Thereupon the ball-dress\r\nhad a fine time as you can imagine; the feathers fell like snow around\r\nmy beauty, the shoulders soon came out of the sleeves, the bosom from\r\nthe corset, the feet from the shoes, the legs from the stockings; the\r\nunstrung necklaces rolled on the floor, and I believe that fresher\r\ndress was never more pitilessly rumpled and torn; the dress was of\r\nsilver gauze and the lining of white satin. Rosette displayed on that\r\noccasion a heroism altogether unusual to her sex, which gave me a most\r\nexalted opinion of her. She looked on at the sack of her costume like\r\nan uninterested witness, and did not for a single instant show the\r\nslightest regret for her dress and her lace; on the contrary, she was\r\nwildly gay, and assisted with her own hands in tearing and breaking\r\nanything that wouldn\'t untie or unclasp quickly enough to suit my\r\ntaste and hers.--Doesn\'t this strike you as worthy to be handed down\r\nin history beside the most brilliant deeds of the heroes of antiquity?\r\nThe greatest proof of love a woman can give her lover is to refrain\r\nfrom saying to him: "Take care and not rumple me or spot my dress,"\r\nespecially if the dress be new.--A new dress is a greater source\r\nof security to a husband than is commonly supposed. It must be that\r\nRosette adores me or else she is blessed with a philosophy superior to\r\nthat of Epictetus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter III--_Thereupon the ball-dress had a fine time as\r\nyou can imagine; * * * and I believe that fresher dress was never more\r\npitilessly rumpled and torn; the dress was of silver gauze and the\r\nlining of white satin. Rosette displayed on that occasion a heroism\r\naltogether unusual to her sex._]\r\n\r\nNevertheless I think that I paid Rosette the full value of her dress\r\nand more, in coin which is none the less esteemed and valued because it\r\ndoes not pass current with tradesmen. Such unexampled heroism surely\r\ndeserved such a recompense. However, like the generous creature she\r\nis, she repaid what I gave her. I had a wild, almost convulsive sort\r\nof pleasure, such as I did not believe myself capable of enjoying. The\r\nresounding kisses mingled with bursts of laughter, the shuddering,\r\nimpatient caresses, all the piquant, tantalizing sensations, the\r\npleasure imperfectly enjoyed because of the costume and the situation,\r\nbut a hundred times keener than if there had been no obstacles,\r\nproduced such an effect on my nerves that I was seized with paroxysms\r\nwhich I had some difficulty in overcoming.--You cannot conceive the\r\nproud, affectionate way in which Rosette gazed at me as she tried to\r\nsoothe me, and the joyful yet anxious manner with which she lavished\r\nattentions upon me: her face glowed with the pleasure that she felt\r\nin producing such an effect upon me, while her eyes, swimming in\r\nsweet tears, bore witness to her alarm at my apparent illness and the\r\ninterest she took in my health.--She had never seemed so beautiful to\r\nme as at that moment. There was something so maternal and so chaste\r\nin her glance that I entirely forgot the more than anacreontic scene\r\nthat had just taken place, and threw myself on my knees at her feet,\r\nasking permission to kiss her hand; which permission she granted with\r\nextraordinary dignity and gravity.\r\n\r\nThat woman certainly isn\'t as depraved as De C---- claims and as she\r\nhas often seemed to me to be; her corruption is in her mind and not in\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nI have cited this scene from among twenty others: it seems to me that\r\nafter such an experience one can, without overweening conceit, believe\r\nhimself a woman\'s lover.--And yet I have not that feeling.--I had no\r\nsooner returned home than that thought took possession of me and began\r\nto work upon me as usual.--I remembered perfectly all that I had said\r\nand heard, all that I had done and seen. The slightest gestures, the\r\nmost insignificant attitudes, all the most trivial details stood out\r\nclearly in my memory: I remembered everything, even to the slightest\r\ninflections of the voice, the most indescribable shades of enjoyment;\r\nbut it did not seem to me that all those things had happened to me\r\nrather than to some one else. I was not sure that it was not all\r\nan illusion, a phantasmagoria, a dream, or that I had not read it\r\nsomewhere or other, or even that it was not a story invented by myself\r\nas I had invented many others. I dreaded being the dupe of my own\r\ncredulity or the plaything of some deception; and notwithstanding the\r\nevidence of my weariness and the material proofs that I had not slept\r\nat home, I could easily have believed that I had gone to bed at my\r\nusual hour and slept till morning.\r\n\r\nI am very unfortunate in my inability to acquire the moral certainty\r\nof something of which I am physically certain. In ordinary cases the\r\ncontrary is the case and the fact proves the idea. I would like well to\r\nprove the fact by the idea; I cannot do it; although it is a strange\r\nthing, it is so. It rests with myself, to a certain extent, to have a\r\nmistress; but I cannot force myself to believe that I have one, even\r\nthough that is the fact. If I have not the necessary faith in me, even\r\nfor a thing so palpable as that, it is just as impossible for me to\r\nbelieve in so simple a fact as for another to believe in the Trinity.\r\nFaith is not to be acquired, it is a pure gift, a special grace from\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nNo one ever longed as I do to live the life of others and to assimilate\r\nanother nature to my own; no one ever had less success. Whatever I may\r\ndo, other men are little more than phantoms to me and I do not feel\r\ntheir existence; but it is not the desire to understand their lives and\r\nshare in them that I lack. It is the power or the want of real sympathy\r\nwith anything on earth. The existence or non-existence of a person or\r\nthing does not interest me enough to affect me in a perceptible and\r\nconvincing way. The sight of a man or a woman who appears before me\r\nin flesh and blood leaves on my mind no more definite trace than the\r\nfanciful vision of a dream: a pale world of shadows and of apparitions,\r\nfalse or true, hovers about me, murmuring low, and in the midst of\r\nthem I feel as utterly alone as possible, for not one of them has any\r\neffect upon me for good or evil, and they seem to me to be of a nature\r\naltogether different from mine. If I speak to them and they make what\r\nseems a sensible reply, I am as surprised as if my dog or my cat should\r\nsuddenly open his mouth and take part in the conversation: the sound\r\nof their voices always astonishes me and I could easily believe that\r\nthey are only fleeting apparitions and I the mirror in which they are\r\nreflected. Inferior or superior, I certainly am not of their kind.\r\nThere are moments when I recognize none but God above me, and others\r\nwhen I deem myself hardly the equal of the earthworm under its stone or\r\nthe mollusk on its sand-bank; but whatever my frame of mind, exalted or\r\nhumble, I have never been able to persuade myself that men were really\r\nmy fellows. When any one calls me _monsieur_, or, in speaking of me,\r\nrefers to me as _that man_, it always seems strange to me. My very name\r\nseems to me but an empty one and not my real name; and yet, no matter\r\nhow low it may be uttered, amid the loudest noise, I turn suddenly with\r\na convulsive and peevish eagerness which I have never been able to\r\nexplain.--Is it the dread of finding in the man who knows my name, and\r\nto whom I am no longer simply one of the common herd, an antagonist or\r\nan enemy?\r\n\r\nIt is when I have been living with a woman that I feel most strongly\r\nhow utterly my nature repels every sort of alliance and mixture. I am\r\nlike a drop of oil in a glass of water. No matter how much you turn it\r\nand shake it, the oil will never mix with the water; it will separate\r\ninto a hundred thousand little globules which will unite again and\r\nrise to the surface the instant it becomes calm: the drop of oil and\r\nthe glass of water epitomize my history. Even lust--that diamond chain\r\nthat binds all human beings together, that consuming fire that melts\r\nthe stone and metal of the heart and causes them to fall in tears as\r\nmaterial fire melts iron and granite--all powerful as it is, has never\r\nbeen able to subdue or move me. And yet my senses are very sharp; but\r\nmy heart is a hostile sister to my body, and the ill-mated couple, like\r\nevery possible couple, lawfully or unlawfully united, lives in a state\r\nof constant warfare.--A woman\'s arms, the strongest of all earthly\r\nbonds, so it is said, are to me very weak fetters, and I have never\r\nbeen farther from my mistress than when she was straining me to her\r\nheart.--I was stifled, that\'s the whole story.\r\n\r\nHow many times have I been angry with myself! What superhuman efforts\r\nhave I made to be different! How I have exhorted myself to be\r\naffectionate, lover-like, passionate! how often I have taken my heart\r\nby the hair and dragged it to my lips in the middle of a kiss! Whatever\r\nI do, it always recoils, wiping the kiss away, as soon as I release my\r\nhold. What torture for that poor heart to look on at the orgies of my\r\nbody and to be constantly compelled to sit through banquets at which it\r\nhas nothing to eat!\r\n\r\nIt was when I was with Rosette that I determined, once for all, to\r\nascertain if I am not hopelessly unsociable, and if I can take enough\r\ninterest in another person\'s existence to believe in it. I exhausted\r\nthe whole category of experiments, and I have not succeeded in solving\r\nmy doubts to any great extent. With her my pleasure is so keen that my\r\nheart often finds itself diverted at least, if not touched, a state of\r\nthings that impairs the accuracy of observations. After all, I have\r\ndiscovered that it didn\'t go below the skin and that my enjoyment\r\nwas confined to the epidermis, the heart participating only through\r\ncuriosity. I have pleasure because I am young and ardent; but the\r\npleasures came from myself and not from another. Its source was in\r\nmyself rather than in Rosette.\r\n\r\nIt is of no use for me to struggle, I cannot go out of myself for a\r\nsingle moment. I am still what I was, that is to say, a very tired,\r\nvery tiresome creature, who disgusts me exceedingly. I have failed\r\nutterly to introduce into my brain the idea of another human being,\r\ninto my heart, another\'s emotion, into my body, another\'s pain or\r\npleasure. I am a prisoner in myself and all escape is impossible: the\r\nprisoner longs to escape, the walls ask nothing better than to crumble,\r\nand the doors to open before him; but some inexplicable fatality keeps\r\nevery stone immovable in its place, every bolt in its groove; it is as\r\nimpossible for me to admit any one to my quarters as to go myself to\r\nothers; I cannot make or receive calls, and I live in the most absolute\r\nsolitude amid the multitude: my bed may not be widowed, but my heart\r\nalways is.\r\n\r\nAh! to be unable to increase one\'s size by a single line, by a single\r\natom; to be unable to admit others\' blood into one\'s veins; to see\r\nalways with one\'s own eyes, never clearer, never farther, never\r\notherwise; to hear sounds with the same ears and the same sensation;\r\nto touch with the same fingers; to perceive changing objects with\r\nan unchangeable organ; to be doomed to the same tone of voice, the\r\nrepetition of the same sounds, the same phrases, the same words, and\r\nnot to be able to fly, to escape one\'s self, to take refuge in some\r\ncorner where no one can follow; to be compelled to keep always to one\'s\r\nself, to dine and lie alone--to be the same man to twenty different\r\nwomen; to play, throughout the most complicated situations of the drama\r\nof your life, a part that is forced upon you, whose lines you know\r\nby heart; to think the same things, to have the same dreams:--what\r\ntorture, what ennui!\r\n\r\nI have longed for the horn of the Tangut brothers, for Fortunatus\'s\r\nhat, Abaris\'s b\xc3\xa2ton, Gyg\xc3\xa8s\'s ring; I would have sold my soul to\r\nsnatch the magic wand from a fairy\'s hand, but I have never longed so\r\nintensely for anything as to meet on the mountain, like Tiresias the\r\nsoothsayer, those serpents who can change the sex of mortals, and what\r\nI most envy in the strange, monstrous gods of the Indies are their\r\nconstant incarnations and innumerable transformations.\r\n\r\nI began by longing to be another man; then, as I reflected that I\r\ncould, by analogy, foresee almost exactly what I should feel and\r\ntherefore not experience the change and the surprise I expected, I\r\nconcluded that I would prefer to be a woman; that idea always occurred\r\nto me when I had a mistress who was not ugly; for an ugly woman is like\r\na man to me, and in my moments of enjoyment I would gladly have changed\r\nmy r\xc3\xb4le, for it is very annoying to know nothing about the effect one\r\nproduces and to judge of others\' pleasure only by one\'s own. Such\r\nreflections and many others have often given me, at moments when it\r\nwas most inappropriate, a meditative, dreamy air, which has caused me\r\nto be accused most unjustly of coldness and infidelity.\r\n\r\nRosette, who, very luckily, doesn\'t know all this, believes me to\r\nbe the most amorous man on earth; she takes that impotent _frenzy_\r\nfor a frenzy of passion, and she does her utmost to humor all the\r\nexperimental caprices that pass through my brain.\r\n\r\nI have done all that I possibly could to convince myself that she\r\nbelongs to me. I have tried to go down into her heart, but I have\r\nalways stopped on the first step of the staircase, at her flesh or her\r\nmouth. Despite the intimacy of our corporeal relations, I feel that we\r\nhave nothing in common. Never has an idea of the same tenor as mine\r\nspread its wings in that youthful, smiling head; never has that heart,\r\noverflowing with life and fire, whose palpitations cause that firm,\r\nwhite breast to rise and fall, beaten in unison with my heart. My soul\r\nhas never coalesced with hers. Cupid, the god with the hawk\'s wings,\r\nhas not kissed Psyche on her fair ivory brow. No!--that woman is not my\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nIf you know all that I have done to compel my heart to share the\r\nlove of my body! with what frenzy I have glued my mouth to hers\r\nand wound my arms in her hair, and how tightly I have embraced her\r\nrounded, supple figure. Like Salmacis of old, enamored of the young\r\nHermaphrodite, I have tried to melt her body and mine together; I have\r\ndrunk her breath and her warm tears that bliss forced from the brimming\r\nchalice of her eyes. The more inextricably our bodies were intertwined,\r\nthe closer our embrace, the less I loved her. My heart, sitting sadly\r\nby, looked on with a pitying air at that deplorable union to which it\r\nwas not bidden, or veiled its face in disgust and wept silently behind\r\nthe skirt of its cloak. All this is attributable perhaps to the fact\r\nthat I do not really love Rosette, worthy to be loved though she be,\r\nand anxious as I am to love her.\r\n\r\nTo rid myself of the idea that I was myself, I transported myself to\r\nmost unusual surroundings, where it was altogether unlikely that I\r\nshould meet myself, and being unable to cast my individuality to the\r\ndogs, I tried to expatriate it so that it would no longer recognize\r\nitself. I have had but moderate success therein, for that devil of\r\na myself follows me persistently; there is no way of getting rid of\r\nhim; I haven\'t the resource of sending word to him, as I do to other\r\nuncomfortable callers, that I am not at home or that I have gone into\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nI have had my mistress in the bath and I have played the Triton as\r\nbest I could.--The sea was a huge marble tub. As for the Nereid, what\r\nshe showed accused the water, transparent though it was, of not being\r\nsufficiently so for the exquisite beauty of what it concealed.--I have\r\nhad her at night, by moonlight, in a gondola with music.\r\n\r\nThat would be very commonplace at Venice, but here it is anything but\r\nthat.--In her carriage, with the horses going at a gallop, amid the\r\nrattling of the wheels, the leaping and jolting, sometimes by the\r\nlight of lanterns, sometimes in the densest darkness.--That doesn\'t\r\nlack a certain stimulating interest and I advise you to try it: but I\r\nforget that you are a venerable patriarch, and that you don\'t indulge\r\nin such refinements.--I have climbed in at her window when I had the\r\nkey to the door in my pocket.--I have made her come to my apartments\r\nin broad daylight, in fact, I have compromised her so thoroughly that\r\nno one--myself excepted, be it understood--now doubts that she is my\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nBy reason of all these inventions which, if I were not so young, would\r\nresemble the expedients of a blas\xc3\xa9 old rake, Rosette adores me far\r\nand away above all others. She sees therein the ardor of a teasing\r\npassion that nothing can restrain, and that is always the same despite\r\nthe changes of time and place. She sees therein the constantly renewed\r\neffect of her charms and the triumph of her beauty, and, in truth, I\r\nwould that she were right, and it is neither my fault nor hers--I must\r\nbe just--that she is not.\r\n\r\nThe only wrong I have done her consists in being myself. If I told her\r\nthat, the child would reply at once that that is my greatest merit in\r\nher eyes; which would be more courteous than sensible.\r\n\r\nOnce--it was in the beginning of our liaison--I believed that I had\r\ngained my end, for a moment I believed that I loved her--I did love\r\nher.--O my friend, I have never lived except during that moment, and\r\nif it had lasted an hour I should have become a god. We had ridden out\r\ntogether in the saddle, I on my dear Ferragus, she on a snow-white mare\r\nthat looks like a unicorn, her feet are so delicate and her body so\r\nslender. We rode along a broad avenue of elms of prodigious height; the\r\nsun poured down upon us, bright and warm, sifting through the serrated\r\nfoliage; ultra-marine patches showed here and there amid the fleecy\r\nclouds, broad bands of pale blue lay along the horizon, changing to a\r\nmost delicate apple-green when they encountered the golden rays of the\r\nsetting sun. The appearance of the sky was unusual and fascinating; the\r\nbreeze wafted to our nostrils an indefinable perfume of wild flowers\r\ndelicious beyond words. From time to time a bird rose in front of us\r\nand flew singing along the avenue. The church-bell of an invisible\r\nvillage softly rang the Angelus, and the silvery notes, which came\r\nbut faintly to our ears because of the distance, were inexpressibly\r\nsweet. Our horses were going at a foot pace, and they walked side by\r\nside in such perfect step that neither of them was an inch ahead of the\r\nother.--My heart dilated and my soul overflowed upon my body. I had\r\nnever been so happy. I did not speak, nor did Rosette, and yet we never\r\nunderstood each other so perfectly. We were so close together that my\r\nleg touched her horse\'s side. I leaned toward her and put my arm about\r\nher waist; she made a similar movement and rested her head against my\r\nshoulder. Our mouths met; O such a chaste, delicious kiss! Our horses\r\nwalked on, the reins lying on their necks. I felt Rosette\'s arms relax\r\nand her body yield more and more. I knew that my own strength was\r\nfailing me, and I was near fainting.--Ah! I promise you that at that\r\nmoment I cared but little whether I was myself or somebody else. We\r\nrode in that way to the end of the avenue, where the sound of footsteps\r\ncaused us abruptly to resume our natural positions; some of our\r\nacquaintances, also in the saddle, rode up and spoke to us. If I had\r\nhad my pistols, I believe I should have fired at them.\r\n\r\nI glared at them with a fierce, lowering expression that must have\r\nseemed very strange to them. After all, I was wrong to be so angry\r\nwith them, for they had unwittingly done me the service of cutting\r\nmy pleasure short at the moment when, by its very intensity, it\r\nwas certain to become pain or to sink under its violence. The\r\nscience of stopping in time is not regarded with all the respect\r\nit deserves.--Sometimes, as you lie with a woman, you put your arm\r\nunder her waist: at first it is a most blissful sensation to feel the\r\npleasant warmth of her body, the soft, velvety flesh of her sides, the\r\npolished ivory of her hips, and to press your hand against her breast\r\nwhich throbs and quivers. The fair one falls asleep in that voluptuous,\r\ncharming posture; the curve of her loins becomes less pronounced,\r\nthe agitation of her bosom is calmed, her sides rise and fall with\r\nthe freer, more regular respiration of sleep, her muscles relax, her\r\nface is hidden by her hair.--Meanwhile the weight upon your arm grows\r\nheavier, you begin to observe that she is a woman, not a sylph; but you\r\nwould not remove your arm for anything on earth. There are many reasons\r\nfor that: the first is that it is dangerous to wake a woman with whom\r\none is lying; one must be prepared to substitute for the blissful dream\r\nshe is probably dreaming, a more blissful reality; the second is that,\r\nif you ask her to raise herself so that you can take away your arm,\r\nyou tell her indirectly that she is heavy and discommodes you--which\r\nis not polite--or else you give her to understand that you are feeble\r\nand overdone--an extremely humiliating admission for you and likely\r\nto lower you greatly in her mind; the third is that, as you have had\r\npleasure in that position, you think that if you retain the position\r\nthe pleasure may be renewed, wherein you are mistaken. The poor arm is\r\ncaught under the mass that crushes it, the blood is checked, the nerves\r\nare distended and numbness pricks you with its countless needles: you\r\nare a sort of Milo of Crotona on a small scale, and the mattress and\r\nthe back of your divinity are a sufficiently accurate representation\r\nof the two parts of the tree that have reunited. Day comes at last to\r\ndeliver you from your martyrdom and you leap out of that instrument\r\nof torture more eagerly than ever husband descended from the nuptial\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nThat is the history of many passions. It is the history of all\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be--despite the interruption or because of the\r\ninterruption--never had such a blissful sensation fallen to my lot: I\r\nfelt that I was really somebody else. Rosette\'s soul in its entirety\r\nhad entered into my body. My soul had left me and filled her heart\r\nas hers had filled mine. They had met, no doubt, during that long\r\nequestrian kiss, as Rosette dubbed it afterward--to my annoyance by the\r\nway--and had penetrated and mingled as inextricably as the souls of two\r\nmortal creatures can upon a morsel of perishable clay.\r\n\r\nAngels surely must kiss like that, and the real paradise is not in\r\nheaven but on the lips of the woman we love.\r\n\r\nI have waited in vain for such a moment and have tried unsuccessfully\r\nto lead up to a repetition of it. We have often ridden together\r\nthrough the avenue of elms at sunset on lovely evenings; the trees had\r\nthe same verdure, the birds sang the same song, but to us the sun\r\nseemed dull, the foliage withered: the song of the birds had a harsh,\r\ndiscordant sound, we were no longer in harmony with it all. We brought\r\nour horses to a walk and we tried the same kiss.--Alas! only our lips\r\nmet and it was only the spectre of the former kiss.--The beautiful,\r\nthe sublime, the divine, the only real kiss I have given and received\r\nin my whole life had flown away forever. Since that day I have always\r\nhad an inexpressibly sad feeling on returning from the forest. Rosette,\r\nlight-hearted madcap that she naturally is, cannot avoid the feeling\r\nand her reverie betrays itself by a sweet little pout, which is at\r\nleast as attractive as a smile.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything but the fumes of wine and a great blaze of candles\r\nenable me to shake off these fits of depression. We both drink like\r\nmen condemned to death, silently and glass after glass, until we have\r\nswallowed the necessary amount; then we begin to laugh and mock most\r\nheartily at what we call our sentimentality.\r\n\r\nWe laugh--because we cannot weep. Ah! who will succeed in sowing a tear\r\nin my parched eye?\r\n\r\nWhy did I enjoy that evening so? It would be very hard for me to say.\r\nI was the same man, Rosette the same woman. It was not my first\r\nexperience on horse-back, nor hers; we had already watched the sun set\r\nand the spectacle had touched us no more than a picture, which one\r\nadmires or not according as the colors are more or less brilliant.\r\nThere is more than one avenue of elms and chestnuts in the world, and\r\nthat was not the first one we had ridden through; what then caused us\r\nto find such a sovereign fascination there, what metamorphosed the dead\r\nleaves into topazes, the green leaves into emeralds, gilded all those\r\nwhirling atoms and changed into pearls all the drops of water scattered\r\nover the greensward, what imparted such sweet melody to the tones of\r\na bell that was usually discordant and to the twittering of countless\r\nyoung birds?--There must have been a very penetrating flavor of poesy\r\nin the air, as even our horses seemed to catch the scent of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet nothing in the world could be more pastoral and more simple:\r\na few trees, a few clouds, five or six clumps of wild thyme, a woman,\r\nand a sunbeam over all like a gold chevron on a coat of arms.--There\r\nwas neither surprise nor bewilderment in my sensations. I knew\r\nperfectly well where I was. I had never been to that precise spot, but\r\nI remembered perfectly the shape of the trees and the position of the\r\nclouds, the white dove that flew across the sky I had seen flying in\r\nthe same direction; the little silvery bell, which I then heard for\r\nthe first time, had often tinkled in my ears, and its voice seemed\r\nto me like the voice of a friend; although I had never been there,\r\nI had many times passed through that avenue with princesses mounted\r\non unicorns; my most voluptuous dreams rode there every evening and\r\nmy desires had exchanged kisses absolutely like the one exchanged by\r\nmyself and Rosette.--There was nothing new to me in that kiss; but it\r\nwas as I had thought it would be. It was perhaps the only time in my\r\nlife that I have not been disappointed and that the real has seemed to\r\nme as beautiful as the ideal.--If I could find a woman, a landscape,\r\na building, anything that corresponded as closely to my desires as\r\nthat moment corresponded to the moment I had dreamed of, I should have\r\nno reason to envy the gods, and I would gladly renounce my box in\r\nparadise.--But, in truth, I do not believe that any man of flesh and\r\nblood could have an hour of such exquisite enjoyment; two kisses like\r\nthat would pump a whole life dry and leave a complete void in a heart\r\nand a body.--But no such consideration as that would stop me; for, not\r\nbeing able to prolong my life indefinitely, I am ready to die, and I\r\nshould prefer to die of pleasure rather than of old age or ennui.\r\n\r\nBut that woman doesn\'t exist.--Yes, she does exist; it may be that only\r\na wall separates us.--Perhaps I jostled her in the street yesterday or\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn what does Rosette fall short of being that woman? In this, that I do\r\nnot believe she is. By what fatality do I always have for mistresses,\r\nwomen that I do not love? Her neck is smooth enough to set off the\r\nmost beautifully-wrought necklaces; her fingers are taper enough to do\r\nhonor to the loveliest and richest rings; the ruby would blush with\r\npleasure to gleam on the pink lobe of her delicate ear; the cestus of\r\nVenus would fit her waist; but Love alone has the secret of tying his\r\nmother\'s scarf.\r\n\r\nAll Rosette\'s merit is in herself, I have attributed nothing to\r\nher that she has not. I have not cast over her beauty the veil of\r\nperfection with which love envelops the loved one;--the veil of Isis is\r\ntransparent beside that veil. Naught but satiety can raise the corner\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nI do not love Rosette; at least my love for her, if I have any, does\r\nnot resemble the ideal I have formed of love. It may be that my ideal\r\nis not a just one, I do not dare to say. Certain it is that it makes me\r\ninsensible to the merits of other women, and I have desired no other\r\nwith any consistency since I have had her. If she has any reason to be\r\njealous, it is of phantoms only, about which she worries very little,\r\nand yet her most formidable rival is my imagination; that is something\r\nwhich, with all her shrewdness, she will probably never discover.\r\n\r\nIf women only knew!--How many infidelities the least fickle lover is\r\nguilty of to the most adored mistress!--It is to be presumed that they\r\npay us back in full and more; but they do as we do and say nothing.\r\nA mistress is a necessary subject, who ordinarily disappears under\r\nflourishes and embroidery. Very often the kisses you give her are not\r\nfor her; you embrace the idea of another woman in her person, and she\r\nprofits not infrequently--if it can be called profiting--by the desires\r\naroused by another. Ah! my poor Rosette, how many times you have served\r\nas a body to my dreams and given reality to your rivals; to how many\r\ninfidelities have you unwittingly been accessory! If you could have\r\nimagined, at times when my arms clasped you so tightly, when my mouth\r\nwas most closely united to yours, that your beauty and your love had\r\nnothing to do with my passion, that the thought of you was a hundred\r\nleagues from my mind; what if some one had told you that those eyes,\r\nveiled with amorous languor, were cast down simply in order not to look\r\nat you and not to banish the illusion that you served only to complete,\r\nand that, instead of being a mistress, you were simply an instrument of\r\nlust, a means of assuaging a desire impossible of realization!\r\n\r\nO divine creatures, ye lovely virgins, slender and diaphanous,\r\nwho lower your periwinkle eyes and clasp your lily hand in the\r\npictures with golden backgrounds of the old German masters, ye\r\nstained-glass saints, ye missal martyrs who smile so sweetly amid\r\nthe convolutions of the arabesques, and come forth so fresh and fair\r\nfrom the flower-bells!--O ye lovely courtesans lying all naked in\r\nyour hair on beds strewn with roses, beneath great purple curtains,\r\nwith your bracelets and necklaces of huge pearls, your fan and your\r\nmirrors, gleaming in the shadow in the fiery rays of the setting\r\nsun!--ye dark-skinned maidens of Titian, who display so wantonly your\r\nundulating hips, your firm, round thighs, your polished breasts and\r\nyour supple and muscular loins!--ye antique goddesses, who rear your\r\nwhite phantoms in the shady corners of gardens!--ye are a part of my\r\nseraglio; I have possessed you all in turn.--Sainte Ursule, I have\r\nkissed your hands on the fair hands of Rosette; I have toyed with the\r\nblack hair of the Muranese and Rosette never had such a hard task to\r\nrearrange her hair: I have been with you more than Acteon was, O virgin\r\nDiana, and I have not been changed to a stag: it was I who replaced\r\nyour handsome Endymion!--What a multitude of rivals whom she does not\r\nsuspect and upon whom she cannot be revenged! yet they are not all\r\npainted or carved!\r\n\r\nWomen, when you notice that your lover is more affectionate than usual,\r\nthat he presses you in his arms with unwonted emotion; when he rests\r\nhis head upon your knees and raises it to look at you with moist and\r\nwandering eyes; when enjoyment serves only to augment his desire and\r\nhe stifles your voice with his kisses as if he dreaded to hear it, be\r\nsure that he simply does not know that you are there; that he has, at\r\nthat moment, an assignation with a chimera which you make palpable, and\r\nwhose part you play.--Many chamber-maids have profited by the love that\r\nqueens inspire.--Many women have profited by the love that goddesses\r\ninspire, and a commonplace reality has often served as the pedestal\r\nfor an ideal idol. That is why poets habitually take dirty trollops for\r\nmistresses.--You can lie ten years with a woman without ever seeing\r\nher; that is the history of many great geniuses, whose ignoble or\r\nobscure connections have caused the world to wonder.\r\n\r\nI have been unfaithful to Rosette in no other way than that. I have\r\nbeen false to her only for pictures and statues and she has been\r\nequally concerned in the treachery. I have not the slightest material\r\nsin upon my conscience with which to reproach myself. I am, in that\r\nrespect, as white as the snow-capped Jungfrau, and yet, while not in\r\nlove with anybody, I would like to be with some one. I do not seek the\r\nopportunity, but I shall not be sorry if it comes; if it should come,\r\nI might not use it, perhaps, for I have an innate conviction that it\r\nwould be the same with another, and I prefer that it should be so\r\nwith Rosette than with any other; for, take away the woman, I still\r\nhave a jolly companion, witty, and very agreeably depraved; and that\r\nconsideration is not one of the least of those that restrain me, for,\r\nin losing the mistress, I might be distressed to find that I had lost\r\nthe friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know that it will soon be five months, yes, fully five months,\r\nfive eternities that I have been the titular Celadon of Madame Rosette?\r\nThat is admirable to the last degree. I would not have believed myself\r\nto be so constant, nor would she, I will wager. We are in very truth a\r\ncouple of plucked pigeons, for only turtle-doves are capable of such\r\naffection. How we have cooed! how we have pecked at each other! what\r\npictures of clinging ivy! what a charming existence _\xc3\xa0 deux!_ Nothing\r\ncould be more touching, and our two poor little hearts might have been\r\nplaced on a dial pierced by the same spit, and as though trembling in a\r\ngust of wind.\r\n\r\nFive months\' t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate, so to speak, for we see each other every\r\nday and almost every night--the door being always closed to visitors;\r\ndoesn\'t it make your flesh creep simply to think of it? Well! to the\r\nglory of the incomparable Rosette be it said, I am not greatly bored,\r\nand those months will doubtless prove to be the most agreeable in my\r\nlife. I do not think it would be possible to entertain more constantly\r\nand more successfully a man who has no passion in his heart, and\r\nGod knows what pitiable idleness it is that is attributable to an\r\nempty heart! You cannot imagine that woman\'s expedients. She began\r\nby taking them from her mind, then from her heart, for she loves me\r\nto adoration.--With what skill she makes the most of the slightest\r\nspark and how well she knows how to fan it into a conflagration!\r\nhow adroitly she guides the slightest impulses of the heart! how\r\nshe transforms languor into tender reverie! and by what roundabout\r\nroads does she bring back to her the mind that is slipping away!--It\r\nis marvellous!--And I admire her as one of the greatest geniuses\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nI have been to her house in very bad humor, sulky, looking for a\r\nquarrel. I have no idea how the witch did it, but in a very few minutes\r\nshe had compelled me to say flattering things to her, although I hadn\'t\r\nthe slightest desire to do it, to kiss her hands and laugh with all my\r\nheart, although I was horribly angry. Can you conceive of such tyranny\r\nas that?--However, adroit as she is, the t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate cannot last much\r\nlonger, and in the course of the last fortnight I have frequently\r\ndone what I never did before--open the books on the chimney and on\r\nthe table and read a few lines during the pauses in the conversation.\r\nRosette has noticed it, it has alarmed her so that she has had hard\r\nwork to dissemble her feelings, and she has taken all the books out of\r\nher room. I confess that I regret them, although I dare not ask for\r\nthem.--The other day--an alarming symptom!--some one called while we\r\nwere together, and instead of flying into a rage as I used to do at the\r\nbeginning, I was conscious of a sort of pleasure. I was almost affable:\r\nI kept up the conversation when Rosette tried to let it languish so\r\nthat monsieur would take his leave, and when he had gone I ventured to\r\nsay that he didn\'t lack wit and that he was a very agreeable fellow.\r\nRosette reminded me that only two months before I had found the same\r\nman intensely stupid and the most annoying idiot on earth, to which I\r\nhad no reply to make, for I did actually say it; and I was right, too,\r\ndespite the apparent contradiction: for the first time he disturbed\r\na charming t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate, and the second he came to the assistance of\r\na conversation that was exhausted and running dry--on one side at\r\nleast--and spared me for that day a tender scene that I was tired of\r\nacting.\r\n\r\nThat is the point at which we now are; it is a serious state of\r\nthings, especially when one of the two is still in love and is\r\nclinging desperately to the remains of the other\'s love. I am in great\r\nperplexity. Although I am not in love with Rosette, I am very, very\r\nfond of her, and I should hate to do anything to cause her pain. I wish\r\nher to believe, as long as possible, that I love her.\r\n\r\nIn gratitude for all the hours to which she has lent wings, in\r\ngratitude for the love she has given me for pleasure, I wish it.--I\r\nshall deceive her; but is not pleasurable deceit preferable to painful\r\ntruth?--for I shall never have the heart to tell her that I do not love\r\nher. The empty shadow of love on which she is feeding seems to her so\r\nadorable and so dear, she embraces the pale spectre with such rapture\r\nand effusion that I do not dare cause it to vanish; and, yet I am\r\nafraid that she will discover at last that it is only a phantom. This\r\nmorning we had an interview which I propose to repeat in dramatic form\r\nfor greater accuracy, and which makes me fear that I cannot prolong our\r\nliaison very long.\r\n\r\nThe scene is Rosette\'s bed. A sunbeam streams through the curtains: it\r\nis ten o\'clock. Rosette has one arm under my neck and lies perfectly\r\nstill for fear of waking me. From time to time she rises a little\r\non her elbow and leans over my face, holding her breath. I see all\r\nthis through my eyelashes, for I have been awake an hour. Rosette\'s\r\nnight-dress has a neck ruffle of Malines lace which is all torn: it\r\nhas been a stormy night; her hair protrudes in disorder from under her\r\nlittle cap. She is as pretty as a woman can be, when one doesn\'t love\r\nher and is lying in bed with her.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE (_seeing that I am awake)._\r\n\r\n      Oh! sleepyhead!\r\n\r\n      I (_yawning_).\r\n\r\n      Ah-h-h!\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Don\'t yawn like that or I won\'t kiss you for a week.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Oh!\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      It seems, monsieur, that you don\'t care much whether I\r\n      kiss you or not.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Yes, I do.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      How indifferently you say it!--All right; you can depend\r\n      upon it that I won\'t touch you with the end of my lips for\r\n      a week to come.--To-day is Tuesday: not till next Tuesday.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Nonsense!\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      What\'s that? nonsense?\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Yes, nonsense! you\'ll kiss me before night, or I shall die.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You die! What a silly fellow!--I have spoiled you,\r\n      monsieur.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      I shall live.--I am not silly and you have not spoiled\r\n      me--quite the contrary. In the first place I demand the\r\n      instant suppression of _monsieur;_ I know you well enough\r\n      for you to call me by my name and speak in the language of\r\n      intimates.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I have spoiled you, D\'Albert.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Very good.--Now put your mouth over here.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      No, next Tuesday.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Well, well! has it come to this, that we exchange\r\n      caresses, calendar in hand? We are both a little too young\r\n      for that.--Come, your mouth, my child, or I shall get a\r\n      crick in my neck.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      No.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Ah! you want me to force you, mignonne; _pardieu_! then I\r\n      will force you. The thing is feasible, although perhaps it\r\n      has never been done.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Impertinent!\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Notice, my lovely one, that I was courteous enough to say\r\n      _perhaps;_ that was very good of me.--But we are getting\r\n      away from the subject. Put down your head. Hoity-toity!\r\n      what is all this, my favorite sultana? and what means the\r\n      sulky expression on your face? It is a pleasure to kiss a\r\n      smile and not a pout.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE. (_stooping to kiss me)._\r\n\r\n      How do you expect me to laugh? you say such harsh things\r\n      to me!\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      My purpose is to say very tender things to you. Why should\r\n      I say harsh things?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I don\'t know; but you do say them.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      You mistake meaningless jests for harshness.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Meaningless! You call it meaningless, do you? everything\r\n      has a meaning in love. I tell you I would rather have you\r\n      beat me than laugh as you do.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Then you would like to see me weep?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You always go from one extreme to the other. No one asks\r\n      you to weep, but to talk reasonably and drop that tone of\r\n      persiflage that becomes you so ill.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      It is impossible for me to talk reasonably and not joke;\r\n      I\'ll beat you, if that\'s what you want!\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Do it.\r\n\r\n      I (_giving her a little tap or two on the shoulder)._\r\n\r\n      I would rather cut off my own head than mar your adorable\r\n      little body and make blue stripes on that lovely white\r\n      back.--However much a woman may enjoy being beaten, my\r\n      goddess, I swear that you shan\'t be.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You don\'t love me any more.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      That doesn\'t follow very logically from what precedes;\r\n      it\'s almost as logical as to say: "It rains, so don\'t give\r\n      me my umbrella;" or: "It\'s cold, open the window."\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You don\'t love me, you have never loved me.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Aha! the plot thickens; you don\'t love me any more and you\r\n      have never loved me. That is rather contradictory; how can\r\n      I cease to do a thing which I never began to do?--You see,\r\n      my little queen, you don\'t know what you are saying and\r\n      you are perfectly ridiculous.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I longed so to have you love me that I helped to deceive\r\n      myself. It is easy to believe what one desires; but now\r\n      I see that I am mistaken. You made a mistake yourself;\r\n      you mistook liking for love and desire for passion. It\'s\r\n      something that happens every day. I bear you no ill will\r\n      for it: it wasn\'t your fault that you weren\'t in love with\r\n      me; my own lack of charm is all that I have to blame.\r\n      I ought to have been prettier, more playful, more of a\r\n      flirt; I ought to have tried to rise to your level, O my\r\n      poet! instead of trying to pull you down to mine: I was\r\n      afraid of losing you among the clouds, and I dreaded lest\r\n      your head should steal your heart from me. I imprisoned\r\n      you in my love and I thought that, if I gave myself to you\r\n      utterly, you would keep a little something of me--\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Move away a little, Rosette; your leg burns me--you\'re\r\n      like a hot coal.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      If I annoy you, I\'ll get up.--Ah! stony heart, drops of\r\n      water pierce the stone, but my tears have no effect on\r\n      you. (_She weeps_).\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      If you weep like that, you will certainly make a bathtub\r\n      of our bed.--A bathtub, did I say? an ocean.--Can you\r\n      swim, Rosette?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Villain!\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Oho! now I am a villain! You flatter me, Rosette, I\r\n      haven\'t that honor. I am a blithesome bourgeois, alas!\r\n      and I have never committed the least crime; I have done a\r\n      foolish thing, perhaps, in loving you to distraction; that\r\n      is all.--Are you absolutely determined to make me repent\r\n      that?--I have loved you and I love you now as much as I\r\n      can. Since I have been your lover I have always walked\r\n      in your shadow: I have given you all my time, my days\r\n      and my nights. I have indulged in no high-flown phrases\r\n      with you because I don\'t care for them except when they\r\n      are written; but I have given you a thousand proofs of my\r\n      affection. I won\'t speak of the most scrupulous fidelity,\r\n      for that goes without saying; but I have lost a pound and\r\n      three-quarters since you have been my mistress. What more\r\n      do you want? Here I am in your bed; I was here yesterday,\r\n      I shall be here to-morrow. Is that the way a man acts\r\n      with a woman he doesn\'t love? I do whatever you want; you\r\n      say: "Go," and I go; "stay," and I stay; I am the most\r\n      admirable lover in the world, it seems to me.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      That is just what I complain of--you are the most perfect\r\n      lover in the world.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      What have you to reproach me for?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Nothing; and I would prefer to have some reason to\r\n      complain of you.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      This is an extraordinary quarrel.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      It\'s much worse than that.--You don\'t love me.--I can\r\n      do nothing about it, nor can you.--What remedy have I\r\n      for that? Certainly I would prefer to have something to\r\n      forgive you for.--I would scold you; you would apologize\r\n      as best you could and we should make up.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      That would be all clear gain for you. The greater the\r\n      crime, the more imposing the reparation.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You know very well, monsieur, that I am not yet reduced to\r\n      that, and that if I chose, at this moment, although you\r\n      don\'t love me and we are quarrelling--\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Yes, I agree that it is purely the result of your kindness\r\n      of heart.--Be a little kind now; that would be better than\r\n      syllogizing over our heads as we are doing.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You want to cut short a conversation that embarrasses you;\r\n      but by your leave, my good friend, we will be content with\r\n      talking.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      That\'s a cheap repast.--I assure you that you are making\r\n      a mistake, for you are distractingly pretty, and I have\r\n      sensations.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Which you can describe some other time.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      Aha! my adorable, you have become a little Hyrcanian\r\n      tigress, have you? your cruelty to-day is beyond\r\n      words!--Have you been taken with the fever to set yourself\r\n      up as a vestal? It would be an amusing whim.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Why not? stranger whims have been known; but this\r\n      much is sure, I shall be a vestal so far as you are\r\n      concerned.--Understand, monsieur, that I give myself only\r\n      to people who love me or who I think love me.--You are in\r\n      neither position.--Allow me to rise.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      If you rise, I shall rise too.--You will have the trouble\r\n      of going back to bed, that\'s all.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Let me go!\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      _Pardieu_, no!\r\n\r\n      Rosette (_struggling)._\r\n\r\n      Oh! you shall let me go!\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      I venture, madame, to assure you of the contrary.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE (_seeing that she is not the stronger)._\r\n\r\n      All right! I will stay! you squeeze my arms so\r\n      tight!--What do you want of me?\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      I think you know.--I would not allow myself to put in\r\n      words what I allow myself to do; I have too much respect\r\n      for decency.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE (_already beyond the power to defend herself_).\r\n\r\n      On condition that you will love me dearly--I surrender.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      It\'s a little late to strike your flag, when the enemy is\r\n      already in the citadel.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE (_half swooning, throwing her arms around my\r\n      neck_).\r\n\r\n      Unconditionally. I rely on your generosity.\r\n\r\n      I.\r\n\r\n      You do well.\r\n\r\nAt this point, my dear friend, I think it would not be amiss to place\r\na line of asterisks, for the rest of the dialogue could hardly be\r\ntranslated except by onomatop\xc5\x93ia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sunbeam has had time, since the opening of the scene, to make the\r\ntour of the bedroom. A pleasant, penetrating odor of linden-trees\r\ncomes up from the garden. It is as beautiful a day as can be imagined;\r\nthe sky is as blue as an Englishwoman\'s eye. We rise, and, after\r\nbreakfasting with a good appetite, we take a long drive in the country.\r\nThe clear air, the beauty of the landscape and the aspect of nature in\r\nher joyous mood instilled enough sentimentality and tenderness into my\r\nsoul to make Rosette agree that, after all, I have something in the\r\nshape of a heart like other men.\r\n\r\nHave you never noticed how the shade of the woods, the plashing of\r\nfountains, the singing of birds, a bright and laughing landscape, the\r\nodor of the leaves and flowers, all the paraphernalia of eclogues\r\nand descriptive poems which we have agreed to despise, none the less\r\nretain a secret influence over us, however depraved we may be, which\r\nit is impossible for us to resist? I will tell you in confidence,\r\nunder seal of the most profound secrecy, that I surprised myself very\r\nrecently in a most provincial state of emotion in connection with a\r\nnightingale\'s song. It was in D----\'s garden; the sky, although it\r\nwas night, was almost as bright as at noonday; it was so measureless\r\nand so transparent that one\'s glance easily penetrated to God. It\r\nseemed to me as if I could see the folds of the angels\' robes on the\r\nwhite windings of the Milky Way. The moon had risen, but a great tree\r\nhid it completely; it riddled the dark foliage with a million little\r\nluminous holes and showered more spangles about than ever glittered\r\nupon a marchioness\'s fan. A silence laden with faint sounds and sighs\r\nfilled the garden--perhaps this resembles pathos, but it is not my\r\nfault;--although I saw nothing save the bluish gleam of the moon, it\r\nseemed to me as if I were surrounded by a whole population of phantoms,\r\nunknown yet adored, and I had no feeling of loneliness, although there\r\nwas no one but myself on the terrace.--I was not thinking, I was not\r\ndreaming, I was blended with my surroundings and I felt myself shiver\r\nwith the foliage, glisten with the water, gleam with the moonbeams,\r\nbloom with the flowers; I was no more myself than the tree, the\r\nstreamlet, or the four-o\'clock. I was all of them at once, and I do\r\nnot think it possible to be more thoroughly removed from one\'s self\r\nthan I was at that moment. Suddenly, as if something extraordinary\r\nhad happened, the leaf ceased to flutter at the end of the branch,\r\nthe drop of water from the fountain remained suspended in the air and\r\ndid not fall. The silvery thread, starting from the edge of the moon,\r\nstopped on the way; my heart alone beat with such resonance that it\r\nseemed to fill the whole vast space with clamor.--My heart ceased to\r\nbeat and there was such a profound silence that you could have heard\r\nthe grass grow, and a word spoken in an undertone two hundred leagues\r\naway. And then the nightingale, who probably was awaiting that moment\r\nto begin his song, emitted from his little throat a note so shrill and\r\npiercing that I heard it with my breast no less than with my ears. The\r\nsound spread quickly through the crystalline expanse, until that moment\r\nas still as death, and created a harmonious atmosphere, wherein the\r\nother notes that followed it flew to and fro, flapping their wings.--I\r\nunderstood what he said as perfectly as if I had known the secret of\r\nthe bird language. The story of the loves I have not found was what the\r\nnightingale sang. Never was a truer story told or told with greater\r\nfulness. He did not omit the smallest detail, the most imperceptible\r\nshade. He told me what I had not been able to tell myself, he explained\r\nwhat I had not been able to understand; he gave voice to my reverie\r\nand compelled the phantom, hitherto dumb, to reply. I knew that I was\r\nbeloved, and a thrill most languorously drawn out informed me that I\r\nshould soon be happy. It seemed to me that I could see the white arms\r\nof my beloved extended toward me through the trills and quavers of his\r\nsong and beneath the shower of notes, in a moonbeam.\r\n\r\nShe rose slowly before me with the perfume of the heart of a\r\nhundred-petalled rose.--I will not try to describe her beauty. It is\r\none of those things that words decline to attempt. How describe the\r\nindescribable? how paint that which has neither form nor color? how\r\nnote down a voice without quality and speechless?--I have never had\r\nso much love in my heart; I would have pressed nature to my bosom, I\r\nembraced the empty void as if my arms were clasped about a virgin form;\r\nI kissed the air that blew upon my lips, I swam in the magnetic fluids\r\nthat exhaled from my glowing body. Ah! if Rosette had been there, what\r\nadorable rhapsodies I would have indulged in! But women never know\r\nenough to arrive at the opportune moment.--The nightingale ceased\r\nto sing; the moon, who could keep awake no longer, pulled her cap of\r\nclouds over her eyes, and I left the garden; for the cool night air was\r\nbeginning to make itself felt.\r\n\r\nAs I was cold, I naturally thought that I should be warmer in Rosette\'s\r\nbed than my own, and I went to lie with her.--I let myself in with my\r\npass-key, for everybody in the house was asleep.--Rosette herself had\r\nfallen asleep, and I had the satisfaction of seeing that it was over a\r\nvolume uncut, of my latest poems. She had both arms under her head, her\r\nmouth half open and smiling, one leg stretched out and the other partly\r\ncurled up, in an attitude instinct with ease and grace; she was so\r\nlovely that I mortally regretted that I was no longer in love with her.\r\n\r\nAs I looked at her I reflected that I was as stupid as an ostrich.\r\nI had what I had so long desired, a mistress as entirely my own as\r\nmy horse and my sword, young, pretty, amorous and clever; with no\r\nstern-principled mother, no father with a decoration, no cross-grained\r\naunt, no swaggering brother, and with the priceless advantage of a\r\nhusband duly sealed and nailed up in a fine oaken casket lined with\r\nlead, the whole covered over with a large block of hewn granite, which\r\nis not to be despised; for, after all, it is a very doubtful pleasure\r\nto be caught in the act in the middle of a blissful paroxysm, and to\r\ncomplete one\'s sensations on the pavement, after describing an arc of\r\n40 to 45 degrees, according to the floor on which you happen to be;--a\r\nmistress as free as the mountain air and rich enough to indulge in\r\nthe most exquisite refinements and luxuries, and, moreover, free from\r\nanything like moral ideas, never talking about her virtue as she tries\r\na new posture, nor of her reputation, any more than if she had never\r\nhad one; with no intimate female friends, and despising all women\r\nalmost as much as if she were a man, entertaining a very low opinion of\r\nplatonic affection and making no secret of it, and always playing with\r\nher heart in the game; a woman who, if her lines had fallen in another\r\nsphere, would indubitably have become the most admirable courtesan on\r\nearth and dimmed the glory of the Aspasias and Imperias!\r\n\r\nNow, that woman, so made, was mine. I did what I chose with her; I\r\nhad the key to her room and her drawer; I broke the seals of her\r\nletters; I had taken away her name and given her another. She was my\r\nchattel, my property. Her youth, her beauty, her love, all belonged\r\nto me; I used them, I abused them. I made her go to bed in the daytime\r\nand sit up at night, if the whim seized me, and she obeyed simply,\r\nwithout any affectation of making a sacrifice, and without assuming\r\nthe air of a resigned victim.--She was attentive, caressing, and--a\r\nmost extraordinary thing!--absolutely faithful; that is to say, if in\r\nthe days when I was lamenting that I had no mistress, six months ago,\r\nany one had given me a glimpse of such happiness, even in the distant\r\nfuture, I should have gone mad with joy and tossed my hat up to knock\r\nat the gates of heaven, in token of my delight. And now that I have\r\nthat happiness, I am cold; I am hardly conscious that I have it, I\r\nam _not_ conscious of it, and my present position makes so little\r\nimpression upon me that I often doubt if I have changed my position at\r\nall. If I should leave Rosette, I am convinced in my inmost soul that,\r\nat the end of a month, perhaps less, I should have so thoroughly and\r\ncarefully forgotten her, that I shouldn\'t know whether I had ever known\r\nher or not! Would she do the same? I think not.\r\n\r\nI reflected, as I say, upon all these things, and impelled by a sort\r\nof repentant feeling, I deposited on the fair sleeper\'s brow that\r\nmost chaste and melancholy kiss that ever young man bestowed upon\r\nyoung woman--just on the stroke of midnight. She moved slightly, the\r\nsmile about her mouth became a little more pronounced, but she did not\r\nwake. I undressed slowly, and, creeping under the clothes, stretched\r\nmyself out by her side like a snake. The coolness of my body startled\r\nher; she opened her eyes, and, without speaking, put her mouth to mine\r\nand twined herself about me so completely that I was warmed in less\r\nthan no time at all. All the poetry of the evening changed to prose,\r\nbut to poetic prose at all events. That night was one of the sweetest\r\nsleepless nights I ever passed. I can hope for no more such.\r\n\r\nWe still have pleasurable moments, but they must be led up to and\r\nprepared for by some outside incident like this, and in the beginning I\r\ndid not need to have my imagination excited by gazing at the moon and\r\nlistening to the nightingale, in order to have all the pleasure one can\r\nhave when one is not really in love. There are as yet no broken threads\r\nin our woof, but there are knots here and there, and the chain is not\r\nnearly so smooth as it was.\r\n\r\nRosette, who is still in love, does what she can to avert all these\r\ninconveniences. Unfortunately there are two things in the world that\r\ncannot be guided: love and ennui.--For my own part I make superhuman\r\nefforts to conquer the drowsiness that steals over me in spite of\r\nmyself, and like the provincials who fall asleep at ten o\'clock in\r\nParisian salons, I keep my eyes as wide open as possible and hold up\r\nmy eyelids with my fingers!--nothing serves the purpose and I take\r\nconjugal liberties that are most unpalatable.\r\n\r\nThe dear child, who found the rural expedition so successful the other\r\nday, took me off to her country estate yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt would not be out of place, perhaps, to give you a little description\r\nof the aforesaid estate, which is very attractive; it will lighten up\r\nall this metaphysics a little, and then, too, we must have a background\r\nfor the characters, and figures will not stand out in relief against\r\nan empty void, or against the vague shade of brown with which painters\r\nfill up the field of their canvas.\r\n\r\nThe approach is very picturesque.--Driving through a broad avenue,\r\nlined with venerable trees, you come to a star, the centre of which is\r\nmarked by a stone obelisk surmounted by a sphere of gilded copper:\r\nfive roads form the points of the star. Then the land suddenly\r\ndescends. The road plunges down into a narrow valley, with a small\r\nstream flowing at the bottom, which is crossed by a bridge of a single\r\nspan; then, ascends the opposite slope, where the village lies, whose\r\nslated church-tower can be seen among the thatched roofs and the\r\nrounded tops of the apple-trees. The view is not very extensive, for it\r\nis limited on both sides by the crest of the hill, but it is bright and\r\npleasant and rests the eye.--Beside the bridge there is a mill and a\r\ntower-shaped structure built of red stone: almost incessant barking and\r\nthe sight of a brach-hound or two and some young terriers with crooked\r\nlegs warming themselves in the sun before the door, would inform you\r\nthat it was the head-keeper\'s abode, if the buzzards and martens nailed\r\nto the shutters could leave you for a moment in doubt. At that point an\r\navenue of sorb-trees begins; the red berries attract clouds of birds;\r\nas there is little passing, there is only a band of white in the middle\r\nof the road; all the rest is covered with short, fine moss, and, in the\r\ndouble rut made by carriage wheels, little grasshoppers, as green as\r\nemeralds, buzz and hop about.\r\n\r\nAfter driving some little distance along this avenue you come to a\r\npainted iron fence, with gilt trimmings, and bristling with spikes\r\nand _chevaux de frise._ Thence the road leads to the ch\xc3\xa2teau--which\r\nis still invisible, for it is buried in verdure like a bird in its\r\nnest--but its progress is leisurely and it frequently turns aside to\r\nvisit a brook and a fountain, a dainty summer-house or a point from\r\nwhich a fine view can be had, crossing and recrossing the stream over\r\nChinese or rustic bridges. The inequality of the land and the dams\r\nbuilt for the purposes of the mill cause several waterfalls some four\r\nor five feet in height, and you can imagine nothing more delightful\r\nthan to hear the splashing of all these cascades close beside you, but\r\ngenerally out of sight, for the osiers and elders that line the bank\r\nform an almost impenetrable curtain. But all that part of the park is,\r\nso to speak, only the antechamber of the other part: unfortunately, a\r\npublic highway passes through the estate and cuts it in two, a drawback\r\nfor which a very ingenious remedy has been devised. Two high crenelated\r\nwalls, provided with barbicans and loopholes in imitation of a ruined\r\nfortress, stand on each side of the road; connected with a tower on\r\nthe ch\xc3\xa2teau side, completely covered by gigantic ivy plants, is a\r\ngenuine drawbridge which is lowered every morning, by iron chains, upon\r\nthe opposite bastion. You drive through a lovely ogive archway inside\r\nthe tower, and thence into the second enclosure, where the trees,\r\nwhich have not been cut for more than a century, are of extraordinary\r\nheight, with gnarled trunks swathed in parasitic plants--the handsomest\r\nand most curious trees I have ever seen. Some have leaves only at\r\nthe very top like broad umbrellas; others taper toward the top like\r\nplumes; others, on the contrary, have a large tuft of foliage near\r\nthe bottom, from which the naked trunk rises toward the sky like a\r\nsecond tree planted in the first; you would say it was the foreground\r\nof a landscape painting or flies painted for a scene on the stage, the\r\ntrees are so curiously misshapen;--ivies that reach from one to another\r\nand hug them so tight as to choke them, mingle their dark hearts with\r\nthe green leaves and seem like their shadow. Nothing can be more\r\npicturesque. The stream widens at that spot, so as to form a little\r\nlake, and it is so shallow that you can see, through the transparent\r\nwater, the lovely aquatic plants that carpet its bed. There are\r\nnymph\xc3\xa6as and lotuses swimming nonchalantly in the purest crystal with\r\nthe reflection of the clouds and the weeping-willows that lean over\r\nthe bank: the ch\xc3\xa2teau is on the other side, and yonder little skiff,\r\npainted apple-green and bright red, will save you a long detour to the\r\nbridge. The ch\xc3\xa2teau is a collection of buildings built at different\r\nperiods with gables of unequal heights and a multitude of little\r\nturrets. One ell is of brick with stone trimmings; another portion is\r\nin the rustic style, with quantities of excrescences and vermiculated\r\nwork. Another ell is entirely modern; it has a flat Italian roof with\r\nvases and a tile balustrade, and a canvas porch in the shape of a tent.\r\nThe windows are all of different sizes and do not correspond; there\r\nare some of all styles, even the trefoil and ogive, for the chapel\r\nis Gothic. Certain parts are trellised, like Chinese houses, with\r\ntrellises painted different colors, covered with climbing honeysuckle,\r\njasmin, nasturtiums, and virgin\'s bower, whose tendrils look familiarly\r\nin at the chamber windows and seem to put out their hands to you as\r\nthey say good-morning.\r\n\r\nDespite this lack of regularity, or rather because of it, it is a\r\nfascinating structure; at least, one does not see it all at a single\r\nglance; there is an opportunity for choice and one is always on the\r\nlookout for something one has not seen.\r\n\r\nThis ch\xc3\xa2teau, with which I was not familiar, for it is twenty leagues\r\nfrom town, pleased me immensely at first sight, and I was extremely\r\ngrateful to Rosette for conceiving the admirable idea of selecting such\r\na nest for our love.\r\n\r\nWe arrived just at nightfall; and, as we were tired, after eating a\r\nhearty supper there was nothing we were so anxious to do as to go to\r\nbed--in separate rooms, mind you, for we intended to sleep in good\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nI was dreaming some rose-colored dream, full of flowers and sweet\r\nperfumes and birds, when I felt a warm breath on my forehead and a kiss\r\ndescend upon it with quivering wings. A slight smacking of the lips\r\nand a pleasant moisture on the spot breathed upon led me to think that\r\nI was not dreaming: I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw was\r\nRosette\'s cool, white neck, as she leaned over the bed to kiss me. I\r\nthrew my arms around her waist and returned her kiss more passionately\r\nthan I had done for a long while.\r\n\r\nShe went and drew the curtain and opened the window, then returned and\r\nsat on the edge of my bed, holding my hand in hers and playing with\r\nmy rings. Her costume was marked by the most coquettish simplicity.\r\nShe was without corsets or skirt, and had absolutely nothing on save\r\na lawn _peignoir_ as white as milk, very ample and full; her hair was\r\nheld in place on top of her head by a little white rose of the sort\r\nthat has only three or four petals; her ivory feet were encased in\r\nembroidered slippers of brilliant, diversified colors, as small as they\r\npossibly could be, although they were too large for her, and without\r\nquarterings like those of the young Roman dames. I regretted, when I\r\nsaw her so, that I was already her lover and hadn\'t the prospect still\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter IV--_She went and drew the curtain and opened the\r\nwindow, then returned and sat on the edge of my bed, holding my hand\r\nin hers and playing with my rings. Her costume was marked by the most\r\ncoquettish simplicity._]\r\n\r\nThe dream I was dreaming at the moment that she waked me in such\r\npleasant fashion was not very far removed from the reality.--My\r\nchamber looked on the little lake I described just now. The window\r\nwas surrounded by jasmin, which shook its stars over my floor in\r\na silvery shower: large, exotic flowers swayed in the wind under\r\nmy balcony as if to waft incense up to me; a vague, sweet perfume,\r\ncomposed of a thousand different perfumes, penetrated to my bed, from\r\nwhich I could see the water gleaming and flashing with millions of\r\nspangles; the birds chattered and warbled and whistled and chirped;\r\nit was a confusion of harmonious sounds like the hum and buzz of a\r\nf\xc3\xaate.--Opposite, on a hill-side lying in the sunlight, was a smooth\r\nfield of a golden green, with fat cattle feeding here and there, under\r\nthe care of a small boy.--Higher up the hill and farther away were\r\ngreat patches of forest of a darker green, above which the bluish smoke\r\nof charcoal-kilns rose in spiral columns.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the picture was calm and fresh and smiling, and\r\nwherever I turned my eyes, I saw only what was young and fair. My\r\nchamber was hung with chintz, with mats on the floor, and blue Japanese\r\njars with rounded bodies and tapering necks, filled with strange\r\nflowers, artistically arranged on \xc3\xa9tag\xc3\xa8res and on the dark-blue marble\r\nchimney-piece; the fire-place also was filled with flowers. Panels\r\nabove the doors, representing rural or pastoral scenes, bright-colored\r\nand daintily executed, sofas and divans in every nook and corner--and\r\na lovely young woman, all in white, whose flesh gave a delicate pink\r\ntinge to the transparent dress where it came in contact with it: one\r\ncan conceive nothing better calculated to give pleasure to the soul as\r\nwell as to the eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd so my gratified, careless glance wandered, with equal pleasure,\r\nfrom a magnificent jar thickly strewn with dragons and mandarins,\r\nto Rosette\'s slipper, and thence to the corner of her shoulder that\r\nglistened under the lawn; it rested on the fluttering stars of the\r\njasmin and the white hairs of the willows on the bank, crossed the\r\nwater and sauntered over the hill-side, then returned to the chamber\r\nto fix itself on the rose-colored ribbons of some shepherdess\'s long\r\ncorset.\r\n\r\nThrough the openings in the foliage the sky showed millions of blue\r\neyes; the water rippled gently and I gave myself up to the enjoyment of\r\nthe moment, plunged in blissful tranquillity, saying nothing, with my\r\nhand still in Rosette\'s tiny hands.\r\n\r\nIt is of no use to talk: happiness is white and pink; it can hardly be\r\nrepresented otherwise. Delicate colors belong to it as of right. It has\r\non its palette only sea-green, sky-blue and light yellow: its pictures\r\nare all light like those of the Chinese painters. Flowers, bright\r\nlight, perfumes, a soft and velvety skin touching yours, a veiled\r\nmelody coming from you know not where,--with those one can be perfectly\r\nhappy; there is no way of being happy otherwise. I myself, who have\r\na horror of the commonplace, who dream only of strange adventures,\r\nviolent passions, frenzied bliss, unusual and difficult situations, I\r\nmust be happy like an animal in that way, and, whatever I may do, I can\r\nfind no other.\r\n\r\nI beg you to believe that I made none of these reflections at the time;\r\nthey have come to me since as I sat here writing to you; at that moment\r\nI thought of nothing but enjoying myself--the only occupation of a\r\nreasonable man.\r\n\r\nI will not describe the life we lead here, it is easily imagined. There\r\nare walks under the great trees, violets and strawberries, kisses\r\nand little blue flowers, luncheons on the grass, readings and books\r\nforgotten under the trees; water parties with the end of a scarf or\r\na white hand dipping in the stream, long ballads and long laughter\r\nrepeated by the echoes of the bank;--the most Arcadian life imaginable!\r\n\r\nRosette overwhelms me with caresses and little attentions; more amorous\r\nthan the dove in May, she twines about me and envelops me in her folds;\r\nshe tries to let me breathe no other atmosphere than her breath and see\r\nno other horizon than her eyes; she maintains a very strict blockade\r\nand allows nothing to go in or out without permission; she has built\r\na little guard-house beside my heart, from which she keeps watch on\r\nit night and day.--She says delightful things to me; she makes very\r\ncomplimentary speeches; she sits on my knee and acts in my presence\r\nexactly like a submissive slave before her lord and master; all of\r\nwhich suits me very well, for I like such little humble ways and I have\r\na leaning toward Oriental despotism; she doesn\'t do the smallest thing\r\nwithout asking my opinion, and seems to have completely laid aside her\r\nown fancy and her will; she tries to divine my thought and anticipate\r\nit; she crushes me with her wit, her affection and her submission; she\r\nis perfect enough to throw out of the window.--How in the devil can I\r\nleave a woman so adorable without seeming to be a monster? It would be\r\nenough to discredit my heart forever.\r\n\r\nOh! how I would like to catch her tripping, to find some grievance\r\nagainst her! how impatiently I await an opportunity for a quarrel!\r\nbut there is no danger that the hussy will give me one! When I speak\r\nsharply to her, in a harsh tone, to bring about a quarrel, she answers\r\nme so sweetly, in such a silvery voice, with her eyes swimming in\r\ntears, and such a sad, loving expression, that I seem to myself to be\r\nmore than a tiger, or at least a crocodile, and, inwardly raging, I am\r\nforced to ask her pardon.\r\n\r\nShe is literally murdering me with love; she puts me to the question\r\nand every day she draws closer the planks between which I am caught.\r\nShe probably wants to drive me to tell her that I detest her, that she\r\nbores me to death, and that, if she doesn\'t leave me in peace, I will\r\nslash her face with my hunting crop. Pardieu! she will succeed, and if\r\nshe continues to be as amiable, it will be before long or may the devil\r\ncarry me off!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this fine show, Rosette is surfeited with me as I\r\nam with her; but as she has done some notoriously foolish things for\r\nme, she doesn\'t want to take to herself the discredit of a rupture\r\nin the eyes of the excellent corporation of sensible women. Every\r\ngreat passion claims to be everlasting, and it is very convenient\r\nto assume the credit of that everlastingness without suffering its\r\ndisadvantages.--Rosette reasons thus:--"Here is a young man who has\r\nhardly a vestige of fondness left for me, and, as he is simple-minded\r\nand easy-going, he doesn\'t dare show it openly and doesn\'t know which\r\nway to turn: it is plain that I bore him, but he will wear his life out\r\nin the toils rather than take it on himself to leave me. As he is a\r\npoet after a fashion, he has his head full of fine phrases about love\r\nand passion, and considers himself bound in conscience to be a Tristan\r\nor an Amadis. Now, as nothing in the world is more insupportable than\r\nthe caresses of a person one is beginning not to love--and to cease to\r\nlove a woman is to hate her intensely--I propose to lavish them on him\r\nin a way to sicken him, and the result will be either that he will send\r\nme to the devil or will begin to love me again as he did on the first\r\nday, which he will take very good care not to do."\r\n\r\nNo reasoning could be better.--Isn\'t it charming to play the part of\r\nthe abandoned Ariadne?--People pity you and admire you, and there are\r\nno imprecations strong enough for the infamous wretch who has been so\r\ninhuman as to abandon such an adorable creature; you assume an air of\r\ngrieved resignation, you put your hand under your chin and your elbow\r\non your knee so as to show off the pretty blue veins in your wrist. You\r\nwear your hair more dishevelled, and your dresses for some little time\r\nare of soberer hue. You avoid mentioning the ingrate\'s name, but you\r\nmake roundabout allusions to him, at the same time heaving beautifully\r\nmodulated little sighs.\r\n\r\nA woman so good, so beautiful, so passionate, who has made such great\r\nsacrifices, who has done nothing worthy of blame, a chosen vessel, a\r\npearl of love, a spotless mirror, a drop of milk, a white rose, an\r\nideal essence to perfume a life;--a woman whom you should have adored\r\non your knees, and who will have to be cut in little pieces after her\r\ndeath, to make relics:--such a woman to be abandoned iniquitously,\r\nvillainously, fraudulently! Why a pirate would do no worse! To give her\r\nher death-blow!--for she certainly will die of it.--One must have a\r\npaving-stone in his breast, instead of a heart, to act so.\r\n\r\nO men! men!\r\n\r\nI say this to myself, but perhaps it\'s not true.\r\n\r\nHowever great actresses women naturally are, I find it hard to believe\r\nthat they carry it as far as that; and, when all is said, are all\r\nRosette\'s demonstrations simply the exact expression of her sentiments\r\nfor me?--However it may be, the continuation of the t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate is\r\nimpossible, and the fair chatelaine has at last issued invitations to\r\nher acquaintances in the neighborhood. We are busily engaged making\r\npreparations to receive the worthy provincials.--Adieu, my dear fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nI was mistaken.--My evil heart, incapable of love, seized upon that\r\nreason to deliver itself from the burden of a gratitude it did not\r\nwish to bear; I joyfully grasped that idea to excuse myself to my own\r\nconscience; I clung fast to it, but nothing could be farther from the\r\ntruth. Rosette was not playing a part, and if ever woman was true, she\r\nis the woman.--Ah! well! I am almost angry with her for the sincerity\r\nof her passion, which is an additional bond and makes a rupture more\r\ndifficult or less excusable; I would prefer her to be false and fickle.\r\n\r\nWhat an extraordinary position! You long to go, but you stay; you\r\nlong to say: "I hate you," but you say: "I love you;"--your past\r\nurges you forward and prevents you from turning back or stopping.\r\nYou are faithful and you regret it. An indefinable sense of shame\r\nprevents your abandoning yourself altogether to other acquaintances\r\nand leads you to compromise with yourself. You give to one all you\r\ncan steal from the other and at the same time keep up appearances; the\r\nopportunities for meeting which formerly came about so naturally are\r\nvery hard to find to-day.--You begin to remember that you have business\r\nof importance.--Such a perplexing situation as that is very painful,\r\nbut it is much less so than my present situation.--When it is a new\r\nfriendship that steals you from the old, it is easier to extricate\r\nyourself. Hope smiles sweetly upon you from the threshold of the house\r\nthat contains your new-born love.--A fairer and rosier illusion hovers\r\non its white wings over the scarce-closed tomb of its sister who has\r\ndied; another flower, blooming more radiantly and of sweeter perfume,\r\nupon whose petals trembles a celestial tear, has suddenly sprung forth\r\nfrom among the withered calyxes of the old bouquet;--lovely, azure-hued\r\nperspectives open before you; avenues of fresh and unpretentious\r\nbeeches stretch away to the horizon; there are gardens with white\r\nstatues here and there, or a bench against an ivy-covered wall, lawns\r\ndotted with marguerites, narrow balconies, on whose rails you lean and\r\ngaze at the moon, and shadows cut by fleeting rays of light;--salons\r\nfrom which the daylight is excluded by heavy curtains;--all the\r\ndarkness and isolation that the passion craves which dares not avow\r\nitself. It is as if your youth had come again. You have, moreover,\r\na complete change of haunts and habits and persons; you feel a sort\r\nof remorse, to be sure; but the desire that flutters and hums about\r\nyour head, like a bee in spring, prevents your hearing its voice; the\r\nvoid in your heart is filled and your memories are effaced by present\r\nimpressions,--But in my case it is different: I love no one and it is\r\nfrom weariness and disgust with myself rather than with her that I wish\r\nI were able to break with Rosette.\r\n\r\nMy former ideas, which had become a little indistinct in my mind, are\r\ncoming to the front again, more foolish than ever.--I am, as formerly,\r\ntortured by the longing to have a mistress, and, as formerly, even in\r\nRosette\'s arms I doubt whether I have ever had one.--I see once more\r\nthe lovely lady at her window, in her park of the time of Louis XIII.,\r\nand the huntress on her white horse gallops along the forest path.--My\r\nideal beauty smiles upon me from her hammock of clouds, I fancy that\r\nI recognize her voice in the song of the birds, in the rustling of\r\nthe foliage; it seems to me that some one is calling me from every\r\ndirection, and that the daughters of the air brush my face with the\r\nfringe of their invisible scarfs. As in the days of my agitation,\r\nI imagine that, if I should set out instantly and go somewhere very\r\nfar away at great speed, I should reach some place where things that\r\nconcern me are taking place and where my destiny is being decided.--I\r\nfeel that somebody is impatiently awaiting my coming in some corner of\r\nthe earth, I don\'t know where. Some suffering soul who cannot come to\r\nme is calling eagerly to me and dreaming of me; that is the reason of\r\nmy uneasiness and of my inability to remain in one place; I am being\r\nviolently drawn away from my centre. Mine is not one of those natures\r\nto which others flock, one of those fixed stars about which other\r\nradiant bodies gravitate; I must needs wander through the expanse of\r\nheaven like an erratic meteor, until I have fallen in with the planet\r\nwhose satellite I am to be, the Saturn about whom I am to pass my ring.\r\nOh! when will that union take place? Until then I cannot hope for rest\r\nor peace of mind, but I shall be like the bewildered, vacillating\r\nneedle of a compass, seeking its pole.\r\n\r\nI allowed my wing to be caught in the deceitful snare, hoping to leave\r\nonly a feather there and to retain the power to fly away when it seemed\r\ngood to me: nothing could be more difficult; I find myself covered by\r\nan invisible net, harder to break than the one forged by Vulcan, and\r\nthe mesh is so fine and close that there are no openings through which\r\nI can escape. The net is large and roomy, however, and I can move about\r\nin it with an appearance of freedom; it is hardly perceptible except\r\nwhen you try to break it; but then it resists and becomes as firm as a\r\nwall of brass.\r\n\r\nHow much time I have lost, O my ideal! without the slightest effort to\r\nrealize thee! How basely I have yielded to the temptation of a night\'s\r\npleasure! and how little I deserve to meet thee!\r\n\r\nSometimes I think of forming another liaison; but I have no one in\r\nview; more frequently I make up my mind that, if I succeed in bringing\r\nabout a rupture, I will never again involve myself in such bonds,\r\nand yet there is nothing to justify that resolution, for the present\r\nconnection has been, to all appearance, a very happy one and I have\r\nno reason in the world for complaining of Rosette.--She has always\r\nbeen kind to me, and has behaved as well as any one could; she has\r\nbeen exemplarily faithful to me and has not given an opening for\r\nsuspicion; the most alert and most anxious jealousy could have had no\r\nword of blame for her and must have slept in security.--A jealous\r\nman could have been jealous only of the past; in that direction, it\r\nis true, there was ample ground for jealousy. But luckily, jealousy\r\nof that sort is a very rare article, and one has quite enough to do\r\nto look after the present without going back to fumble under the\r\nashes of extinct passion for phials of poison and cups of gall.--What\r\nwoman could a man love, if he thought of all that?--You may have a\r\nsort of vague idea that a woman has had several lovers before you;\r\nbut you say to yourself--a man\'s pride has so many tortuous folds and\r\ncounterfolds!--that you are the first she has really loved, and that\r\nit was through a combination of fatal circumstances that she became\r\nconnected with men unworthy of her, or else through a vague craving of\r\na heart that sought to satisfy itself and changed because it had not\r\nmet its affinity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one can really love none but a virgin--a virgin in body and in\r\nmind--a fragile bud that has never been caressed as yet by any zephyr\r\nand whose carefully hidden breast has neither received the drop of rain\r\nnor the pearl of dew; a chaste flower that displays its white robe for\r\nyou alone, a beautiful lily with a silver urn at which no desire has\r\nslaked its thirst and which has been gilded only by your sun, swayed\r\nby no breath but yours, watered by no hand but yours.--The glare of the\r\nnoonday sun is less agreeable than the divine pallor of the dawn, and\r\nall the ardor of an experienced heart that knows what life is, yields\r\nthe palm to the celestial ignorance of a youthful heart just awaking to\r\nlove.--Ah! what a bitter, degrading thought it is that you are wiping\r\naway another\'s kisses, that there may not be a single spot upon that\r\nbrow, those lips, that bosom, those shoulders, that whole body which is\r\nyours now, that has not been reddened and branded by other lips; that\r\nthose divine murmurs which come to the relief of the tongue that can\r\nfind no more words of love, have been heard before; that those excited\r\nsenses did not learn their ecstasy and their delirium from you, and\r\nthat away, away down in one of those recesses of the heart which are\r\nnever visited, there lives an inexorable memory which compares the joys\r\nof an earlier day to the joys of to-day!\r\n\r\nAlthough my natural nonchalance leads me to prefer the high roads to\r\nunbroken paths, and the public watering-trough to the mountain spring,\r\nI absolutely must try to love some virginal creature as spotless as the\r\nsnow, as timid as the sensitive plant, who can only blush and look\r\ndown; it may be that, from that limpid stream, which no diver has as\r\nyet investigated, I shall fish up a pearl of the fairest water, worthy\r\nto be a pendant to Cleopatra\'s; but, in order to do that, I should have\r\nto cast off the bond that binds me to Rosette,--for I am not likely to\r\nrealize that longing with her,--and to tell the truth, I do not feel\r\nstrong enough to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, if I must make the confession, there is at the bottom\r\nof my heart a secret, shameful motive, which dares not show itself in\r\nbroad daylight, but which I must tell you of, since I have promised to\r\nconceal nothing from you, and a confession, to be deserving of credit,\r\nmust be complete;--the motive I speak of has much to do with all this\r\nuncertainty.--If I break with Rosette, some time must necessarily pass\r\nbefore her place is filled, however easy of access the class of women\r\nmay be among whom I shall seek her successor; and I have fallen into\r\na habit of enjoying myself with her which it will be hard for me to\r\nbreak off. To be sure I have the resource of courtesans; I liked them\r\nwell enough in the old days and I did not hesitate to resort to them\r\nunder such circumstances;--but to-day they disgust me beyond measure\r\nand make me ill.--So I must not think of them, and I am so softened\r\nby indulgence, the poison has penetrated so deep into my bones that I\r\ncannot bear the idea of being one or two months without a woman.--That\r\nis pure egoism of the basest kind; but it is my opinion that the most\r\nvirtuous men, if they would be perfectly frank, would have to make\r\nnearly a similar confession.\r\n\r\nThat is the true secret of my captivity and, if it weren\'t for that,\r\nRosette and I would long ago have fallen out for good and all. Indeed\r\nit is such a deathly bore to pay court to a woman, that I haven\'t\r\nthe heart to attempt it. To begin again the charming idiocies I have\r\nalready said so many times, to play the adorable once more, to write\r\nnotes and reply to them; to escort the charmer, in the evening, to\r\nsome place two leagues away; to catch cold in your feet and your head\r\nstanding in front of the window watching a beloved shadow; to sit upon\r\na sofa calculating how many thicknesses of tissue separate you from\r\nyour goddess; to carry bouquets and go the round of the ball-rooms\r\nto reach the point where I now am, is a vast deal of trouble!--It\'s\r\nabout as well to remain in one\'s rut.--What is the use of leaving it,\r\nonly to fall into another exactly like it, after much unnecessary\r\nagitation and untold trouble? If I were in love, the thing would go\r\nof itself and it would all seem perfectly delightful to me; but I am\r\nnot, although I have the most earnest desire to be; for, after all,\r\nthere is nothing but love in the world; and if pleasure, which is only\r\nits shadow, has so many allurements for us, what must the reality be?\r\nIn what an ocean of ineffable bliss, in what seas of pure, unalloyed\r\ndelight must they swim whose hearts Love has pierced with one of his\r\ngold-tipped arrows, and who burn with the delicious warmth of a mutual\r\nflame!\r\n\r\nBeside Rosette I feel that insipid tranquillity, that sort of slothful\r\nwell-being which results from the satisfaction of the senses, but\r\nnothing more; and that is not enough. Often that voluptuous indolence\r\nturns to torpor, and that tranquillity to ennui; thereupon I fall into\r\naimless meditation and dull, spiritless reveries that weary and harass\r\nme;--it is a state of things that I must put an end to at any price.\r\n\r\nOh! if I could only be like some of my friends, who kiss an old glove\r\nwith ecstasy; who are made perfectly happy by a clasp of the hand; who\r\nwould not exchange for a sultana\'s jewel-case a few wretched flowers\r\nhalf-withered by the heat of the ball-room; who cover with tears and\r\nsew into their shirt, where it will rest against the heart, a note\r\nwritten in an inelegant style and so stupid that you would think it\r\nwas copied from the _Parfait Secr\xc3\xa9taire_; who adore women with large\r\nfeet and apologize for them on the ground that they have noble souls!\r\nIf I could follow tremblingly the vanishing folds of a dress, or wait\r\nfor a door to open in order to see a cherished white apparition pass\r\nin a blaze of light; if a word spoken beneath the breath would make\r\nme change color; if I had the virtue to go without my dinner so as to\r\narrive sooner at a rendezvous; if I were capable of killing a rival\r\nor fighting a duel with a husband; if by a special dispensation of\r\nProvidence, I were endowed with the power of considering ugly women\r\nclever, and those who are ugly and stupid as well, pleasant and\r\nagreeable; if I could make up my mind to dance the minuet and to listen\r\nto sonatas played by young ladies on the harpsichord or harp; if my\r\ncapacity should rise to the height of learning ombre and _reversis_;\r\nin short, if I were a man and not a poet--I certainly should be much\r\nhappier than I am; I should be less bored myself and should bore others\r\nless.\r\n\r\nI have never asked but one thing of women--beauty; I am very willing to\r\ngo without intellect and soul.--In my eyes a beautiful woman is always\r\nintellectual;--she knows enough to be beautiful, and I know no other\r\nknowledge as valuable as that.--It takes many sparkling sentences and\r\nkeen shafts of wit to equal the value of the flash of a lovely eye. I\r\nprefer a pretty mouth to a pretty speech, and a well-modeled shoulder\r\nto a virtue, even one of the theological sort; I would give fifty souls\r\nfor a dainty foot, and all poetry and all the poets for the hand of\r\nJoanna of Aragon, or the brow of Foligno\'s virgin.--Above all things\r\nI adore a beautiful figure; to my mind beauty is manifest Divinity,\r\npalpable happiness, heaven come down to earth.--There are certain\r\nundulations of outline, certain turns of the lip, a certain droop of\r\nthe eyelids, certain inclinations of the head, certain elongations of\r\nthe profile which enchant me beyond all expression and fix my attention\r\nfor whole hours.\r\n\r\nBeauty, the only thing that cannot be acquired, inaccessible forever\r\nto those who haven\'t it at first; an ephemeral and fragile flower that\r\ngrows without being sown, a pure gift from heaven!--O beauty, the most\r\nradiant diadem with which chance can crown the human brow--thou art\r\nadmirable and precious like everything that is beyond man\'s reach,\r\nlike the azure of the firmament, like the gold of the star, like the\r\nperfume of the seraphic lily!--Man may change his stool for a throne,\r\nmay conquer the world; many have done it; but who could fail to kneel\r\nbefore thee, thou pure personification of God\'s thoughts?\r\n\r\nI ask only beauty, it is true; but I must have beauty so perfect that\r\nI probably shall never find it. I have seen here and there women who\r\nwere admirably beautiful in some respects but only mediocre in others,\r\nand I have loved them for what was best in them, ignoring the rest; it\r\nis a difficult task, however, and painful, to suppress thus the half\r\nof one\'s mistress, and to amputate mentally the ugly or commonplace\r\nportions of her anatomy, limiting one\'s glances to what points of\r\nbeauty she may have.--Beauty is harmony, and a woman who is equally\r\nugly in all parts is often less disagreeable to look at than one who is\r\nunevenly beautiful. Nothing offends my sight so much as an unfinished\r\nmasterpiece, or beauty in which something is lacking; a grease-spot is\r\nless offensive upon coarse sackcloth than upon rich silk.\r\n\r\nRosette is not ill-favored; she might be considered beautiful, but\r\nshe is far from realizing the ideal of my dreams; she is a statue,\r\nseveral portions of which have been completed. The others are not so\r\nsharply cut from the block; there are some parts brought out with much\r\nskill and charm, and others more carelessly and hurriedly. To ordinary\r\neyes the statue seems entirely completed and perfectly beautiful; but\r\na more careful observer soon discovers places where the work is not\r\nclose enough, and outlines which need to be touched and retouched many\r\ntimes by the workman\'s nail before attaining the purity that belongs to\r\nthem;--it is for love to polish the marble and complete it, which is\r\nequivalent to saying that I shall not be the one to do it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not confine beauty to this or that particular form or\r\ncontour.--The manner, the gesture, the gait, the breath, the coloring,\r\nthe voice, the perfume, everything that is a part of life enters into\r\nthe composition of beauty in my estimation; everything that sings or\r\nshines or perfumes the air is rightfully a part of beauty.--I love rich\r\nbrocades, gorgeous stuffs with their ample and stately folds; I love\r\ngreat flowers and jars of perfume, transparent running water and the\r\ngleaming surface of fine weapons, blooded horses and the great white\r\ndogs that we see in Paul Veronese\'s pictures. I am a genuine heathen in\r\nthat respect, and I do not adore misshapen gods;--although I am not at\r\nheart exactly what is called irreligious, there are few who are in fact\r\nworse Christians than myself. I do not understand the mortification\r\nof the flesh that forms the essence of Christianity, I consider it a\r\nsacrilegious act to lay hands upon God\'s work, and I do not believe\r\nthat the flesh is wicked, since He Himself moulded it with His own\r\nfingers and in His own image. I think but little of the long sober-hued\r\nfrocks from which only a head and two hands emerge, or of the pictures\r\nin which everything is drowned in shadow except some one radiant brow.\r\nI want the sun to shine everywhere, to have as much light and as little\r\nshadow as possible, the bright colors to gleam, the lines to undulate,\r\nthe nude body to exhibit itself proudly and the flesh not to lie\r\nhidden, since it, as well as the spirit, is a never-ending hymn to the\r\npraise of God.\r\n\r\nI can understand perfectly the wild enthusiasm of the Greeks for\r\nbeauty; and for my part I can see nothing absurd in the law that\r\ncompelled the judges to listen to the arguments of the lawyers in some\r\ndark place, lest their noble bearing, the grace of their gestures and\r\nattitudes should prejudice the judges in their favor and throw undue\r\nweight into the scales.\r\n\r\nI would buy nothing of an ugly shopwoman; I give alms more freely to\r\nbeggars whose rags and emaciation have a touch of the picturesque.\r\nThere is a little fever-ridden Italian, as green as an unripe lemon,\r\nwith great black and white eyes that take up half of his face;--you\r\nwould say he was an unframed Murillo or Espagnolet exposed for sale on\r\nthe sidewalk by a second-hand dealer:--he always gets two sous more\r\nthan the others. I would never whip a handsome horse or a handsome dog,\r\nand I would not care for a friend or a servant who is not pleasant\r\nto look at.--It is downright torture to me to look at ugly things or\r\nugly people.--Bad taste in architecture, a piece of furniture of ugly\r\nshape, prevent my enjoying myself in a house, however comfortable and\r\nattractive it may otherwise be. The best wine seems to me almost sour\r\nin an ungraceful glass, and I confess that I would prefer the most\r\nunsubstantial broth on one of Bernard of Palissy\'s enamelled plates\r\nto the most toothsome game on an earthen platter.--The exterior of\r\nthings has always exerted a powerful influence upon me, and that is\r\nwhy I avoid the society of old men; they irritate me and affect me\r\ndisagreeably because they are wrinkled and deformed, although some\r\nof them have some special beauty; and in the pity that I feel for\r\nthem there is much disgust;--of all earthly ruins, the ruin of man is\r\nassuredly the saddest to contemplate.\r\n\r\nIf I were a painter--and I have always regretted that I am not--I\r\nshould people my canvases with none but goddesses, madonnas, nymphs,\r\ncherubim, and loves. To devote one\'s brush to painting portraits,\r\nunless of beautiful people, seems to me a crime against the majesty of\r\nthe art; and, far from seeking to duplicate those mean or ugly faces,\r\nthose insignificant or vulgar heads, I should incline toward ordering\r\nthe originals to be cut off. The ferocity of Caligula, if diverted in\r\nthat direction, would seem to me almost praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nThe only thing on earth that I have desired with any constancy, is to\r\nbe beautiful.--By beautiful, I mean as beautiful as Paris or Apollo.\r\nTo have no deformity, to have features almost regular, that is to\r\nsay, to have the nose in the centre of the face and neither flat nor\r\nhooked, eyes that are neither red nor bloodshot, a mouth of suitable\r\ndimensions, is not to be beautiful: on that theory I should be, and I\r\nconsider myself as far removed from my ideal of virile beauty as if\r\nI were one of the puppets that strike the hour on church-bells; if I\r\nhad a mountain on each shoulder, the crooked legs of a terrier and\r\nthe muzzle of a monkey, I should resemble it as closely. Often and\r\noften I sit and look at myself in the mirror, for hours at a time,\r\nwith incredible fixity and close scrutiny, to see if my face has not\r\nimproved in some degree; I wait for the outlines to make a movement and\r\nstraighten out or take on a more graceful and purer curve, for my eye\r\nto brighten and swim in a more sparkling fluid, for the hollow that\r\nseparates my forehead from my nose to fill up, and for my profile thus\r\nto become as simple and regular as the Greek profile; and I am always\r\ngreatly surprised that it does not happen. I am always in hopes that\r\nsome spring or autumn I shall cast off my present shape as a serpent\r\ncasts his old skin.--To think that I need so little to be handsome and\r\nthat I never shall be! What! half a hair\'s breadth, the hundredth or\r\nthe thousandth part of a hair\'s breadth more or less in one place or\r\nanother, a little less flesh on this bone, a little more on that--a\r\npainter or sculptor would have it all arranged in half an hour. What\r\nwas it that made the atoms of which I am composed crystallize in this\r\nway or that? Why need that outline bulge out here and sink in there,\r\nand why was it necessary that I should be thus and not otherwise?--Upon\r\nmy word if I had chance by the throat, I believe I would strangle\r\nhim.--Because it pleased a vile mass of I don\'t know what to fall from\r\nI don\'t know where and coagulate stupidly into the awkward creature\r\nthat I visibly am, I shall be miserable forever! Isn\'t it the most\r\nabsurd and pitiful thing in the world? How is it that my soul, although\r\neagerly longing to do so, cannot let the poor carcass that it now holds\r\nerect, fall prostrate, and enter into and animate one of those statues\r\nwhose exquisite beauty saddens and ravishes it? There are two or three\r\npeople whom it would give me the greatest pleasure to assassinate,\r\ntaking care, however, not to bruise or mar them, if I knew the word by\r\nwhich souls are made to pass from one to another.--It has always seemed\r\nto me that, in order to do what I wish--and I don\'t know what I do\r\nwish--I needed very great and perfect beauty, and I fancy that if I had\r\nhad it, my life, which is so entangled and harassed, would have been\r\njust the same.\r\n\r\nWe see so many lovely faces in pictures!--why is not one of them\r\nmine?--so many charming faces disappearing under the dust and decay of\r\ntime in the recesses of old galleries! Would it not be better for them\r\nto leave their frames and bloom anew on my shoulders? Would Rapha\xc3\xabl\'s\r\nreputation suffer greatly if one of the angels whom he drew in swarms\r\nflying about in the deep blue of his pictures, should turn his mask\r\nover to me for thirty years? There are so many parts of his frescoes,\r\nand among them some of the most beautiful, that have scaled off and\r\nfallen because of their age! No one would notice. What have the silent\r\nbeauties to do that hang around those walls, and at whom men scarcely\r\ncast an absent-minded glance? and why has not God or chance the wit to\r\ndo what a man does with a few hairs stuck in the end of a stick and\r\npigments of different colors mixed together on a board?\r\n\r\nMy first sensation before one of those marvellous faces whose painted\r\nglance seems to look through you and into infinite space beyond, is\r\nprofound amazement and admiration not unmixed with terror: tears\r\nfill my eyes, my heart beats fast; then, when I have become a little\r\naccustomed to it and have penetrated farther into the secret of its\r\nbeauty, I mentally draw a comparison between it and myself; deep down\r\nin my soul jealousy writhes in knots more intricate than a viper\'s, and\r\nit is with the utmost difficulty that I refrain from throwing myself\r\nupon the canvas and tearing it in pieces.\r\n\r\nTo be beautiful, that is to say, to have in yourself such a charm\r\nthat every one smiles upon you and welcomes you; that every one is\r\nprepossessed in your favor and inclined to be of your opinion, even\r\nbefore you have spoken; that you have only to pass through a street\r\nor show yourself on a balcony to raise up friends or mistresses for\r\nyourself in the crowd. To have no need to be lovable in order to be\r\nloved, to be exempt from all the expenditure of wit and complaisance\r\nwhich ugliness makes incumbent upon you, and to be excused from having\r\nthe thousand and one moral qualities that one must have to supplement\r\nphysical beauty--what a superb, magnificent gift!\r\n\r\nAnd he who should combine supreme strength with supreme beauty, who,\r\nbeneath Antinous\'s skin, should have the muscles of Hercules,--what\r\nmore could he desire? I am sure that with those two things and the\r\nmind that I now have I should be emperor of the world within three\r\nyears!--Another thing that I have longed for almost as much as beauty\r\nand strength is the gift of transporting myself from one place to\r\nanother with the swiftness of thought. Angelic beauty, the strength of\r\nthe tiger and the wings of the eagle, and I should begin to conclude\r\nthat the world is not so badly organized as I used to think.--A\r\nbeautiful mask to charm and fascinate the prey, wings to pounce down\r\nupon it and carry it off, nails to tear it to pieces;--so long as I\r\nhave not those I shall be unhappy.\r\n\r\nAll the passions and all the tastes I have had have been simply\r\ndisguised forms of those three desires. I have loved weapons, horses,\r\nwomen: weapons to replace the muscles I had not; horses to serve as\r\nwings; women, so that I might possess in some one the beauty that I\r\nlacked myself. I sought in preference the most ingeniously deadly\r\nweapons, and those whose wounds were incurable. I have never had\r\noccasion to use any of the krises or yataghans, yet I like to have\r\nthem around me; I take them from their scabbards with an indescribable\r\nsense of security and power, I lay about me in every direction with\r\nthe greatest energy, and if by chance I see the reflection of my face\r\nin a mirror, I am astonished at its ferocious expression.--As for\r\nmy horses, I override them so that they must either founder or say\r\nwhy.--If I hadn\'t given up riding Ferragus he would have died long\r\nago, and it would be a pity, for he\'s a fine beast. What Arabian steed\r\never had limbs so fleet as my desire? In women I have not looked below\r\nthe exterior, and as those whom I have seen thus far are a long way\r\nfrom fulfilling my ideal of beauty, I have fallen back upon pictures\r\nand statues; which, after all, is a pitiful expedient when one\'s\r\nsenses are so inflammable as mine. However, there is something grand\r\nand noble about loving a statue, for it is a perfectly disinterested\r\nlove, you have to dread neither satiety nor distaste with your triumph,\r\nand you cannot reasonably hope for a second miracle like the story of\r\nPygmalion.--The impossible always had a charm for me.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange that I, who am still in the fairest months of youth,\r\nwho have not even used the simplest things, much less abused anything,\r\nhave reached such a degree of satiety that I am tempted only by what\r\nis unusual or difficult of accomplishment?--That satiety follows\r\nenjoyment is a natural law and easily understood. Nothing is more\r\neasily explained than that a man who has eaten heartily of every dish\r\nat a banquet should no longer be hungry and should try to stimulate\r\nhis benumbed palate by the thousand stings of condiments or dry wines;\r\nbut that a man who has just taken his seat at the table and has\r\nhardly tasted the first course, should already be assailed with that\r\nsuperb disgust, should be unable to touch without vomiting any except\r\nhighly-seasoned dishes, and should like only gamey meats, cheese\r\nwith blue streaks running through it, truffles and wine that smells\r\nof the flint, is a phenomenon that can result only from a peculiar\r\nconstitution; it is as if a child of six months should deem his nurse\'s\r\nmilk insipid and refuse to suck anything but brandy. I am as exhausted\r\nas if I had performed all the prodigious feats of Sardanapalus and yet\r\nmy life has been apparently very chaste and peaceful; it is a mistake\r\nto think that possession is the only road leading to satiety. We arrive\r\nthere also through desire, and abstinence is more exhausting than\r\nexcess.--Such a desire as mine is more fatiguing than possession. Its\r\nglance envelops and penetrates the object which it longs to have and\r\nwhich gleams above it, more swiftly and more deeply than if it were\r\nin contact with it. What more could use teach it? what experience can\r\nequal that constant, passionate contemplation?\r\n\r\nI have gone through so much, although I have travelled very little,\r\nthat only the steepest peaks tempt me now. I am attacked by the disease\r\nthat fastens upon nations and powerful men in their old age--the\r\nimpossible. Anything that I can do has not the slightest attraction\r\nfor me. Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, ye great Romans of the Empire, whom\r\nposterity has so ill understood, and whom the pack of ranters pursues\r\nwith its yelping, I suffer with your disease and I pity you with all\r\nthe pity I have left in my heart! I, too, would like to bridge the sea\r\nand pave its waves; I have dreamed of burning cities to illuminate my\r\nf\xc3\xaates; I have longed to be a woman to learn new forms of pleasure. Thy\r\ngolden palace, O Nero, is only a filthy stable beside the palace I\r\nhave built; my wardrobe is better furnished than thine, Heliogabalus,\r\nand much more magnificent.--My circuses are noisier and bloodier than\r\nyours, my perfumes more acrid and more penetrating, my slaves more\r\nnumerous and of better figure; I also have nude courtesans harnessed to\r\nmy chariot, I have walked over men\'s bodies with as disdainful heel as\r\nyou. Colossi of the ancient world, there beats behind my feeble ribs a\r\nheart as great as yours, and if I had been in your places I would have\r\ndone all that you have done and perhaps more. How many Babels have I\r\npiled one upon another to reach the sky, to cudgel the stars and spit\r\nupon all creation! Why am I not God--as I cannot be man?\r\n\r\nOh! I believe that I shall need a hundred thousand centuries of\r\nnothingness to rest from the fatigue of these twenty years of\r\nlife.--God in heaven, what stone will You roll down upon me? into what\r\ndarkness will You plunge me? from what Lethe will You make me drink?\r\nbeneath what mountain will You entomb the Titan? Am I destined to\r\nbreathe a volcano through my mouth and to cause earthquakes when I turn\r\nfrom side to side?\r\n\r\nWhen I think of this, that I was born of a gentle, resigned mother,\r\nsimple in her tastes and manners, I am surprised that I did not burst\r\nher womb when she was carrying me. How does it happen that none of her\r\ncalm, pure thoughts passed into my body with the blood she transmitted\r\nto me? and why must it be that I am the son of her flesh only, not of\r\nher mind? The dove begat a tiger who would like to have all creation\r\nfall a prey to his claws.\r\n\r\nI grew up amid the most chaste and tranquil surroundings. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine an existence in a setting so pure as mine. My\r\nyears were passed in the shadow of my mother\'s easy-chair, with my\r\nlittle sisters and the house-dog. I saw about me only the kindly,\r\nplacid faces of old servants who had grown gray in our service and\r\nwere in a certain sense hereditary, of grave, sententious relations or\r\nfriends, dressed in black, who placed their gloves one after another\r\nin their hat brims; a few aunts of uncertain age, plump and neat and\r\nsedate, with dazzling linen, gray skirts, thread mitts, and hands upon\r\ntheir waist-bands like people of a religious turn of mind; furniture\r\nseverely simple to the point of melancholy, bare oak wainscoting,\r\nleather hangings--a gloomy, sober-hued interior such as some Flemish\r\nmasters have painted. The garden was damp and dark; the box that marked\r\nthe divisions, the ivy that covered the walls, and a few firs with\r\nbare branches were entrusted with the duty of representing verdure\r\nthere and had but ill success; the brick house, with its very high\r\nroof, although roomy and in good condition, had something dull and\r\ndrowsy about it. Certainly nothing could be better adapted to prepare\r\none for a secluded, austere, melancholy life than such a place of\r\nabode. It seemed as if all the children brought up in such a house\r\nmust inevitably end by becoming priests or nuns: ah well! in that\r\natmosphere of purity and repose, amid that gloom and meditation, I\r\nrotted away little by little, without any outward sign, like a medlar\r\non the straw. In the bosom of that upright, pious, saintly family I\r\nreached a horrible depth of depravity.--It was not contact with the\r\nworld, for I had never seen it; nor the fire of passion, for I was\r\nbenumbed in the icy sweat that oozed from those stout walls.--The worm\r\ndid not crawl from the heart of another fruit to my heart. It came to\r\nlife of itself where my pulp was thickest and gnawed and furrowed it\r\nin every direction: but nothing appeared outside and warned me that\r\nI was tainted at the core. I had neither spot nor worm-hole; but I\r\nwas all hollow inside and nothing remained but a thin bright-colored\r\npellicle, which the slightest blow would have broken.--Is it not an\r\ninexplicable thing that a child born of virtuous parents, brought up\r\nwith care and judgment, kept at a distance from everything bad, should\r\nbecome perverted all by himself to such an extent, and reach the point\r\nI have reached? I am sure that, even if you should go back to the sixth\r\ngeneration, you would not find among my ancestors a single atom like\r\nthose of which I am made. I do not belong to my own family; I am not an\r\noffshoot of that noble trunk, but a poisonous toadstool planted among\r\nits mossy roots on some dark, stormy night; and yet no one ever had\r\nmore aspirations, more impulses towards the beautiful than I, no one\r\never tried more obstinately to spread his wings; but every attempt has\r\nmade my fall the greater and the things that should have saved me have\r\nbeen my ruin.\r\n\r\nSolitude has a worse effect upon me than society, although I desire\r\nthe first more than the second. Whatever takes me out of myself is\r\nsalutary; society bores me, but it tears me by force from the vain\r\nreverie whose winding staircase I ascend and descend, with bent head\r\nand folded arms. And so, since one t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate came to an end and there\r\nhave been people here with whom I am compelled to put some constraint\r\nupon myself, I am less subject to my black moods and am less tormented\r\nby those immeasurable longings that pounce upon my heart like a swarm\r\nof vultures, as soon as I am left for a moment without occupation.\r\nThere are some very pretty women and one or two young men who are very\r\npleasant and jovial; but of all this swarm of provincials, the one who\r\nhas the most charm for me is a young cavalier who arrived two or three\r\ndays ago. He took my fancy at the very first, and I became fond of him\r\nsimply from seeing him alight from his horse. It is impossible to be\r\nmore graceful; he is not very tall, but slender and well set-up; there\r\nis something supple and undulating in his gait and his movements,\r\nwhich is pleasing beyond expression; many women would envy him his\r\nhand and foot. His only defect is that he is too beautiful and has too\r\ndelicate features for a man. He is blessed with a pair of the loveliest\r\nand blackest eyes in the world, which have an expression impossible\r\nto define and a glance that it is not easy to sustain; but, as he is\r\nvery young and has no sign of a beard, the softness and perfection\r\nof the lower part of his face temper somewhat the vivacity of those\r\neagle eyes; his glossy, brown hair falls over his neck in great curls\r\nand gives his head a character of its own.--Here then at last is one\r\nof the types of beauty I have dreamed of, made flesh, and actually\r\nbefore my eyes! What a pity that it\'s a man, or what a pity that I am\r\nnot a woman! This Adonis, who, in addition to his lovely face, has a\r\nvery keen intellect of very wide range, still enjoys the privilege of\r\nhaving at the service of his bright remarks and his jests, a voice of a\r\nsilvery and penetrating quality which it is difficult to hear without\r\nemotion.--He is really perfect.--It seems that he shares my taste for\r\nbeautiful things, for his clothes are very rich and well chosen, his\r\nhorse very spirited and a thoroughbred; and, in order that everything\r\nmight be complete and well assorted, he had behind him, riding a pony,\r\na page of some fourteen or fifteen years, fair-haired, pink-cheeked,\r\npretty as a seraph, who was half asleep, and so exhausted by his long\r\nride that his master was obliged to lift him from his saddle and carry\r\nhim to his room in his arms.\r\n\r\nRosette welcomed him very warmly and I think she has formed a plan\r\nto use him to arouse my jealousy and thus kindle the tiny flame that\r\nis sleeping under the ashes of my passion. However redoubtable such\r\na rival may be, I am little inclined to be jealous of him, and I am\r\nso attracted to him that I would gladly abandon my love to secure his\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter V--_A page of some fourteen or fifteen years,\r\nfair-haired, pink-cheeked, pretty as a seraph, who was half asleep, and\r\nso exhausted by his long ride that his master was obliged to lift him\r\nfrom his saddle and carry him to his room in his arms._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, with the permission of the indulgent reader, we propose\r\nto abandon for some little time to his meditations, the worthy\r\npersonage who has thus far occupied the stage all by himself and has\r\nspoken in his own behalf, and to adopt the ordinary form of the novel,\r\nreserving the right, however, to resume the dramatic form hereafter,\r\nif occasion should arise, and to draw still farther upon the species\r\nof epistolary confession that the aforesaid young man addressed to his\r\nfriend, being fully persuaded that, however penetrating and sagacious\r\nwe may be, we certainly cannot know so much about him as he knows about\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe little page was so overdone that he slept in his master\'s arms,\r\nand his little head, with its hair all in disorder, rolled from side\r\nto side as if he were dead. It was some distance from the stoop to the\r\napartment set aside for the new arrival, and the servant who escorted\r\nhim offered to take his turn at carrying the child; but the young\r\ngentleman, to whom the burden seemed no more than a feather-weight,\r\nthanked him and declined to relinquish it; he laid him gently on the\r\ncouch, taking the utmost care to avoid waking him; a mother could have\r\ndone no better. When the servant had retired and the door was closed,\r\nhe knelt beside him and tried to remove his boots; but his little feet\r\nwere so swollen and painful that the operation was a difficult one,\r\nand the pretty sleeper uttered from time to time vague, inarticulate\r\nexclamations, like a person who is on the point of waking; thereupon\r\nthe young gentleman would stop and wait until he was sound asleep\r\nagain. The boots yielded at last and the most important point was\r\ngained; the stockings made little resistance.--This operation at an\r\nend, the master took the child\'s feet and placed them side by side on\r\nthe velvet covering of the sofa; surely they were the two loveliest\r\nfeet in the world, no larger than that, white as new ivory, and\r\nreddened a little by the pressure of the boots in which they had been\r\nimprisoned seventeen hours--feet that were too small for a woman and\r\nlooked as if they had never walked; the part of the leg that could be\r\nseen was round, plump, smooth, transparent, delicately veined, and of\r\nthe most exquisitely graceful shape--a leg worthy of the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter VI--_The pretty sleeper uttered from time to time\r\nvague, inarticulate exclamations, like a person who is on the point of\r\nwaking; thereupon the young gentleman would stop and wait until he was\r\nsound asleep again. The boots yielded at last and the most important\r\npoint was gained; the stockings made little resistance._]\r\n\r\nThe young man, still on his knees, gazed at the two little feet with\r\namorous, admiring intentness; he stooped, raised the left one and\r\nkissed it, then the right one and kissed that; then, from kiss to kiss,\r\nhe ascended the leg to the place where the clothes began.--The page\r\nraised his long lashes slightly and cast an affectionate, sleepy glance\r\nat his master, in which there was no trace of surprise.--"My belt hurts\r\nme," he said, passing his finger under the ribbon; and he fell asleep\r\nagain.--The master loosened the belt, placed a cushion beneath the\r\npage\'s head, and finding that his feet, which had been burning hot,\r\nwere a little cold, he wrapped them carefully in his cloak, drew an\r\narm-chair close to the sofa and sat down. Two hours passed thus, the\r\nyoung man watching the sleeping child and following the shadow of his\r\ndreams on his brow. The only sounds to be heard in the room were his\r\nregular breathing and the ticking of the clock.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a very lovely picture. In the contrast between the two\r\ntypes of beauty there was an opportunity for effect, of which a skilful\r\npainter might have made good use.--The master was as beautiful as a\r\nwoman--the page as lovely as a young girl. The round, rosy face, set\r\nin its frame of hair, resembled a peach among its leaves; it had the\r\nsame fresh and velvety look, although the fatigue of the journey had\r\nlessened somewhat its usual brilliancy; the half-open mouth disclosed\r\ntwo rows of small teeth of a milky whiteness, and beneath the full,\r\ngleaming temples a network of blue veins crossed and recrossed; his\r\neyelashes, like the golden threads around the heads of virgins in\r\nmissals, reached almost to the middle of his cheeks; his long, silky\r\nhair resembled both gold and silver--gold in the shadow, silver in the\r\nlight; his neck was at the same time plump and slender, and gave no\r\nsign of the sex indicated by his clothes; two or three buttons of his\r\ndoublet were unbuttoned to enable him to breathe more freely and as the\r\nfine shirt of Dutch lawn beneath was open, a glimpse was afforded of\r\nan inch or two of firm rounded flesh of admirable whiteness, and the\r\nbeginning of a certain curved line difficult to account for on a young\r\nboy\'s breast; upon looking closely one might have discovered also that\r\nhis hips were a little too fully developed.--The reader will form what\r\nopinion he chooses; these are simple conjectures that we put forward;\r\nwe have no better information on the subject than he, but we hope\r\nto learn something more in a short time, and we promise to keep him\r\nfully informed of our discoveries.--Let the reader, if his sight is\r\nkeener than ours, bury his eyes under the lace of that shirt and decide\r\nconscientiously whether the contour is too swelling or not; but we warn\r\nhim that the curtains are drawn and that there is a sort of half-light\r\nin the room, ill-adapted to that sort of investigation.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman was pale, but his was a golden pallor, full of\r\nstrength and vitality; his eyes swam in a crystalline blue fluid; his\r\nstraight, thin nose imparted a wonderful air of pride and energy to his\r\nprofile, and the flesh was of so fine a texture that it allowed the\r\nlight to pass through it on the edge; his mouth wore the sweetest smile\r\nat certain moments, but ordinarily it was arched at the corners, curving\r\nin rather than out, as in some of the faces we see in the pictures of\r\nthe old Italian masters; a detail that gave a charmingly disdainful\r\nexpression to his face, a _smorfia_ alluring beyond words, an air of\r\nchildish sulkiness and ill humor, very unusual and very fascinating.\r\n\r\nWhat were the bonds that united the master to the page and the page to\r\nthe master? Assuredly there was something more between them than any\r\nconceivable affection between master and servant. Were they friends\r\nor brothers?--In that case, why this masquerading?--It would have been\r\ndifficult for any one witnessing the scene we have just described to\r\nbelieve that those two individuals were just what they seemed to be and\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\n"Dear angel, how he sleeps!" murmured the young man; "I don\'t believe\r\nhe ever travelled so far in his life. Twenty leagues in the saddle,\r\nand he so delicate! I\'m afraid that he will be sick with fatigue. But\r\nno, it will amount to nothing; to-morrow there will be no sign of it;\r\nhe will have recovered his brilliant color and will be fresher than\r\na rose after the rain.--How handsome he is like that! If I weren\'t\r\nafraid of waking him I would eat him up with kisses. What a fascinating\r\ndimple he has in his chin! what fine, white skin!--Sleep soundly, sweet\r\ntreasure.--Ah! I am downright jealous of your mother, and I wish I had\r\nbrought you into the world.--He can\'t be sick? No, his breathing is\r\nregular and he doesn\'t stir.--But I believe some one knocked."\r\n\r\nIn fact, some one had knocked twice, as gently as possible, on the\r\npanel of the door.\r\n\r\nThe young man rose, but, fearing that he might be mistaken, waited for\r\na repetition of the knocking before opening the door.--Two more taps\r\nfollowed, a little more pronounced, and a soft female voice said, in a\r\nvery low tone:--"It is I, Th\xc3\xa9odore."\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore opened the door, but with less eagerness than a young man\r\nnaturally exhibits about admitting a woman whose voice is soft and\r\nwho knocks mysteriously at his door at nightfall.--The open door gave\r\npassage to--whom do you suppose?--to the mistress of the perplexed\r\nD\'Albert, to the Princess Rosette in person, rosier than her name, and\r\nher bosom as deeply moved as ever woman was upon entering a handsome\r\nyouth\'s room in the evening.\r\n\r\n"Th\xc3\xa9odore!" said Rosette.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore lifted his finger and placed it on his lips so as to represent\r\na statue of silence, and, pointing to the sleeping child, led her into\r\nthe adjoining room.\r\n\r\n"Th\xc3\xa9odore," continued Rosette, who seemed to take strange pleasure\r\nin repeating the name, and at the same time to be collecting her\r\nthoughts,--"Th\xc3\xa9odore," she continued, retaining the hand the young man\r\nhad offered her to lead her to her chair, "so you have returned at\r\nlast? What have you been doing all the time? where have you been?--Do\r\nyou know that it is six months since I saw you! Ah! Th\xc3\xa9odore, that is\r\nnot right; we owe some consideration, some pity to those who love us,\r\neven if we do not love them."\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      What have I been doing.--I have no idea.--I have gone\r\n      away and come home, I have waked and slept, I have sung\r\n      and wept, I have been hungry and thirsty, I have been too\r\n      warm and too cold, I have been bored, I have less money\r\n      and am six months older--I have lived, that\'s the whole of\r\n      it.--And how about yourself, what have you been doing?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I have loved you.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Have you done nothing but that?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Absolutely nothing.--I have made a bad use of my time,\r\n      haven\'t I?\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      You might have made a better use of it, my poor Rosette;\r\n      for example, you might have loved some one who could\r\n      return your love.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I am unselfish in love as in everything.--I don\'t lend\r\n      love at interest; it is a pure gift on my part.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      That is a very rare virtue and one that can exist only\r\n      in a noble heart. I have often wished that I could\r\n      love you, especially as you desire it; but there is an\r\n      insurmountable obstacle between us which I cannot tell\r\n      you.--Have you had any other lover since I left you?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I have had one whom I still have.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      What sort of a man is he?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      A poet.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      The devil! who is this poet, and what has he written?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I haven\'t a very clear idea--a volume that nobody knows\r\n      anything about, and that I tried to read one evening.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      So you have an unpublished poet for a lover?--That must\r\n      be interesting.--Is he out at elbows, does he wear dirty\r\n      linen and rumpled stockings?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      No; he dresses very well, washes his hands and has no\r\n      ink-spots on the end of his nose. He\'s a friend of C----;\r\n      I met him at Madame de Th\xc3\xa9mines\',--you know, that tall\r\n      woman, who plays the child and puts on such innocent airs.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      And might one know the name of this eminent personage?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Oh! _Mon Dieu_, yes! he is the Chevalier d\'Albert.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Chevalier d\'Albert! I think that was the young man who was\r\n      on the balcony when I alighted from my horse.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Precisely.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      And who examined me so closely.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Himself.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      He\'s a very good-looking fellow.--And he has not made you\r\n      forget me?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      No. Unfortunately you are not one of those whom one\r\n      forgets.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      He loves you dearly no doubt?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I am not so sure of that.--There are moments when you\r\n      would think he loved me very dearly; but at heart he\r\n      doesn\'t love me, and he is not far from hating me, for\r\n      he is angry with me because he can\'t love me.--He did as\r\n      many others before him have done; he developed a very\r\n      keen taste for passion, and was greatly surprised and\r\n      disappointed when his desire was surfeited.--It is a\r\n      mistake to think that two people must mutually adore each\r\n      other because they have lain together.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      And what do you propose to do with this lover who is not a\r\n      lover?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      What we do with bygone quarters of the moon or with last\r\n      year\'s fashions.--He hasn\'t courage enough to leave me\r\n      the first, and although he does not love me in the true\r\n      sense of the word, he is bound to me by the habit of\r\n      enjoyment, and those are the habits it is hardest to\r\n      break. If I don\'t assist him, he is quite capable of\r\n      conscientiously submitting to be bored with me till the\r\n      last judgment and beyond; for he has within him the germ\r\n      of all noble qualities; and the flowers of his soul ask\r\n      naught but an opportunity to bloom in the sunshine of\r\n      everlasting love.--Really I am very sorry that I did not\r\n      prove to be the sunbeam for him. Of all my lovers whom I\r\n      have not loved, I love him the most; and, if I were not\r\n      as kind-hearted as I am, I would not give him back his\r\n      liberty, but I would still keep him.--But that is what I\r\n      will not do; I am finishing with him at this moment.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      How long will it last?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      A fortnight, three weeks, but at all events not so long\r\n      as if you had not come.--I know that I shall never be\r\n      your mistress.--There is, you say, an unknown reason for\r\n      that, to which I would bow if it were possible for you to\r\n      disclose it to me. Thus I am forbidden to entertain any\r\n      hope in that direction, and yet I cannot make up my mind\r\n      to be another man\'s mistress when you are here; it seems\r\n      to me like a profanation, and as if I should not have the\r\n      right to love you.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Keep this lover for love of me.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      If it will give you pleasure I will do it.--Ah! if you\r\n      could have been mine, how different my life might have\r\n      been from what it has been!--The world has a very false\r\n      idea of me, and I should have lived and died without\r\n      any one suspecting what I am--except you, Th\xc3\xa9odore,\r\n      the only one who has understood me and been cruel to\r\n      me.--I have never wanted any one but you for a lover,\r\n      and I have never had you. O Th\xc3\xa9odore, if you had loved\r\n      me, I should have been virtuous and chaste, I should\r\n      have been worthy of you; instead of that, I shall leave\r\n      behind me--if any one remembers me--the reputation of a\r\n      dissolute woman, a sort of courtesan, who differed from\r\n      her of the gutter only in rank and fortune.--I was born\r\n      with the highest aspirations; but nothing depraves one\r\n      so much as being unloved.--Many people despise me who\r\n      have no idea what I have had to suffer before reaching my\r\n      present position.--Being sure that I shall never belong to\r\n      the man I would prefer above all others, I have allowed\r\n      myself to float with the current, I have not taken the\r\n      trouble to defend a body that could not be yours.--As for\r\n      my heart, no one has had it and no one ever will. It is\r\n      yours, although you have broken it;--and I am different\r\n      from the majority of women who believe themselves virtuous\r\n      provided they have not passed from one bed to another,\r\n      in this respect--although I have prostituted my flesh, I\r\n      have been faithful in heart and soul to the thought of\r\n      you.--At all events I shall have made some few people\r\n      happy, I shall have caused white-robed illusions to dance\r\n      about some pillows. I have innocently deceived more than\r\n      one noble heart. I have been so miserable at being spurned\r\n      by you, that I have always been horrified at the thought\r\n      of compelling any one else to undergo such torture. That\r\n      is the sole worthy motive of adventures which are commonly\r\n      attributed to a spirit of libertinage pure and simple!--I,\r\n      a libertine! O society!--If you knew, Th\xc3\xa9odore, how\r\n      intensely painful it is to feel that your life is a\r\n      failure, that you have let slip your chance of happiness,\r\n      to see that everybody misunderstands you and that it is\r\n      impossible to make people change their opinion of you,\r\n      that your most estimable qualities are tortured into\r\n      defects, your purest essences into deadly poisons, that\r\n      nothing except the evil in you has transpired; to have\r\n      found doors always open to your vices and always closed\r\n      to your virtues, and to have been unable to bring to\r\n      perfection, amid such a wilderness of hemlock and aconite,\r\n      a single lily or a single rose! you know nothing of that,\r\n      Th\xc3\xa9odore.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Alas! alas! Rosette, what you have just said includes the\r\n      history of the whole world; the best part of us is that\r\n      which remains within us and which we cannot display.--It\r\n      is the same with poets.--Their noblest poem is the one\r\n      they have not written; they carry more poems to the grave\r\n      than they leave in their library.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      I shall carry my poem to the grave with me.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      And I mine.--Who has not written one at some time in his\r\n      life? who is so fortunate, or so unfortunate, as not to\r\n      have composed his in his head or in his heart?--Even\r\n      headsmen may have composed poems, all moist with tears of\r\n      the tenderest sensibility; poets perhaps have composed\r\n      some that would be suited to headsmen, so bloody and\r\n      monstrous they are.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Yes.--White roses can fitly be placed on my grave. I have\r\n      had ten lovers, but I am a virgin, and I shall die a\r\n      virgin. Many virgins, on whose graves there is a constant\r\n      snow of jasmine and orange blossoms, were veritable\r\n      Messalinas.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      I know what a noble creature you are, Rosette.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You only in all the world have seen what I am; for you\r\n      have seen me under the influence of a love that is\r\n      perfectly genuine and very deep-rooted, as it is hopeless;\r\n      and no one who has not seen a woman in love can say what\r\n      she is; that is the one thing that consoles me in my\r\n      bitterness of spirit.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      And what does this young man think of you, who is your\r\n      lover to-day in the eyes of the world?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      The mind of a lover is a gulf deeper than the Bay of\r\n      Portugal, and it is very difficult to say what there is\r\n      in the depths of a man; if the lead were attached to a\r\n      line a hundred fathoms long and every fathom unreeled, it\r\n      would still sink without meeting anything to stop it. Yet\r\n      I have touched bottom several times with this man, and\r\n      the lead has sometimes brought up mud, sometimes lovely\r\n      shells, but most frequently mud and fragments of coral\r\n      mixed together.--As to his opinion of me, it has varied\r\n      greatly; he began where others leave off, he despised me;\r\n      young men with vivid imaginations are likely to do that.\r\n      There is always a tremendous fall in the first step they\r\n      take, and the passage from their chimera to reality cannot\r\n      be made without a shock.--He despised me and I entertained\r\n      him; now he esteems me and I bore him. In the early days\r\n      of our liaison he saw only the commonplace side of me, and\r\n      I think that the certainty of meeting with no resistance\r\n      had much to do with his determination. He seemed in great\r\n      haste to have an affair, and I thought at first that it\r\n      was a case of a full heart seeking only an opportunity to\r\n      overflow, one of those vague passions that a man has in\r\n      the May of youth and that impel him, in default of women,\r\n      to throw his arms around the trunks of trees, and to\r\n      kiss the flowers and grass in the fields.--But it wasn\'t\r\n      that;--he simply passed through me to reach something\r\n      else. I was a means to him, and not an end.--Beneath the\r\n      fresh exterior of his twenty years, beneath the first down\r\n      of adolescence, he concealed profound corruption. He was\r\n      tainted to the core; he was a fruit containing nothing\r\n      but ashes. In that young and lusty body was a heart as\r\n      old as Saturn--a heart as incurably wretched as heart\r\n      ever was.--I confess, Th\xc3\xa9odore, that I was frightened and\r\n      that I was almost taken with vertigo as I looked into\r\n      the black depths of that existence. Your sorrows and\r\n      mine are nothing compared to those. If I had loved him\r\n      more I should have killed him. Something irresistibly\r\n      attracts and summons him--something that is not of this\r\n      world or in this world, and he cannot rest day or night;\r\n      and like the heliotrope in a cellar, he twists about to\r\n      turn toward the sun which he cannot see.--He is one of\r\n      those men whose mind was not completely dipped in the\r\n      waters of Lethe before being attached to his body, but\r\n      retains memories of the eternal beauty of the heaven from\r\n      which it comes--memories that work upon it and torment\r\n      it--and remembers that it once had wings and now has feet\r\n      only.--If I were God, I would deprive of poetry for two\r\n      eternities, the angel guilty of such negligence.--Instead\r\n      of being under the necessity of building a castle of\r\n      bright-colored cards in which to shelter a fair, youthful\r\n      fancy for a single spring, it was necessary to erect a\r\n      tower higher than the eight temples of Belus piled one\r\n      upon another. I had not the strength, I pretended not\r\n      to have understood him, and I let him flutter about on\r\n      his wings in search of a peak from which he could take\r\n      flight into boundless space.--He thinks I have noticed\r\n      nothing of all this, because I have fallen in with all his\r\n      caprices without seeming to suspect their object. Being\r\n      unable to cure him, I determined--and I hope that I shall\r\n      receive credit for it some day before God--to give him at\r\n      least the happiness of believing that he was passionately\r\n      loved.--He aroused in me so much pity and interest that I\r\n      was easily able to assume a tone and manner sufficiently\r\n      affectionate to deceive him. I have played my part like a\r\n      consummate actress; I have been playful and melancholy,\r\n      sensible and voluptuous; I have feigned anxiety and\r\n      jealousy; I have shed false tears, and I have summoned\r\n      flocks of ready-made smiles to my lips. I have arrayed\r\n      this counterfeit of love in the richest stuffs; I have\r\n      taken him to drive through the avenues of my parks; I have\r\n      requested all my birds to sing as he passed, and all my\r\n      dahlias and daturas to bend their heads in salutation; I\r\n      have sent him across my lake on the silvery back of my\r\n      darling swan; I have concealed myself inside the manikin\r\n      and bestowed my voice, my wit, my youth and beauty upon it\r\n      and given it such a seductive appearance that the reality\r\n      fell far short of my deception. When the time comes to\r\n      shatter this hollow statue, I shall do it in such a way\r\n      that he will think the wrong is all on my side and so will\r\n      have no remorse. I shall be the one to make the pinhole\r\n      through which the air with which the balloon is filled\r\n      will make its escape.--Is not that sanctified prostitution\r\n      and honorable deception? I have in a glass jar some\r\n      tears that I have collected just as they were about to\r\n      fall.--They are my jewel-case and my diamonds, and I shall\r\n      present them to the angel who comes for me to lead me\r\n      before God.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      They are the loveliest that can glisten on a woman\'s\r\n      neck. A queen\'s jewels are less precious than they. For\r\n      my own part, I believe that the ointment Magdalen poured\r\n      on Christ\'s feet was made of the tears of those she had\r\n      comforted, and I believe, too, that the Milky Way is\r\n      strewn with such tears, and not, as has been said, with\r\n      drops of Juno\'s milk.--Who will do for you what you have\r\n      done for him?\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      No one, alas! since you cannot.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      O dear heart! would that I could!--But do not lose hope.\r\n      You are lovely and still very young. You have many avenues\r\n      of lindens and flowering acacias to pass through before\r\n      reaching the damp road lined with box and leafless trees,\r\n      which leads from the tomb of porphyry in which your happy\r\n      dead years will be buried, to the tomb of rough and\r\n      moss-covered stone where they will hasten to bestow the\r\n      remains of what once was you, and the wrinkled, tottering\r\n      spectres of the days of your old age. You still have much\r\n      of the mountain of life to climb and it will be long\r\n      before you reach the zone where the snow begins. You\r\n      are now only at the level of aromatic plants, of limpid\r\n      cascades over which the iris suspends its tri-colored\r\n      arches, of stately green oaks and sweet-smelling larches.\r\n      Mount a little higher and from that point, with the\r\n      broader horizon spread out before you, perhaps you will\r\n      see the blue smoke rising above the roof beneath which\r\n      he who will love you sleeps. You must not, in the very\r\n      beginning, despair of life, for vistas open in our destiny\r\n      which we had ceased to expect. Man, in his life, has\r\n      often made me think of a pilgrim toiling up the winding\r\n      stairway of a Gothic tower. The long granite serpent winds\r\n      upward in the darkness, every coil a stair. After a few\r\n      circumvolutions the little light that came from the door\r\n      dies out. The shadow of the houses, which are not yet\r\n      passed, does not allow the loopholes to admit the sun:\r\n      the walls are black and moisture oozes from them; you\r\n      seem rather to be going down into a dungeon from which\r\n      you are never to come forth, than ascending to the turret\r\n      which, from below, seemed to you so slender and graceful,\r\n      covered with lace-work and embroidery as if it were about\r\n      starting for the ball.--You hesitate whether you ought\r\n      to go higher, the damp shadows weigh so heavily upon\r\n      your forehead.--A few more turns of the staircase and\r\n      more frequent openings cast their golden trefoils on the\r\n      opposite wall. You begin to see the notched gables of the\r\n      houses, the carving of the entablatures, the strange forms\r\n      of the chimneys; a few steps more and your eye overlooks\r\n      the whole city; it is a forest of steeples, of spires and\r\n      towers, bristling upon all sides, toothed and slashed and\r\n      hollowed, stamped as with dies, and allowing the light to\r\n      shine through their numberless apertures. The domes and\r\n      cupolas raise their rounded forms like a giant\'s breasts\r\n      or the skulls of Titans. The islets formed by houses and\r\n      palaces appear through shadowy or luminous openings. A\r\n      few steps more and you will be on the platform; and then\r\n      you will see, beyond the walls of the city, the green\r\n      fields, the blue hill-sides and the white sails on the\r\n      changing ribbon of the stream. A dazzling light bursts\r\n      upon you, and the swallows fly hither and thither, close\r\n      at hand, with their joyous twitter. The distant sounds\r\n      reach your eyes like a soothing murmur or the hum of a\r\n      swarm of bees; all the bells scatter their necklaces of\r\n      pearls of sound through the air; the breezes bring you\r\n      the odors of the neighboring forest and of the mountain\r\n      flowers: it is all light and melody and perfume. If your\r\n      feet had been weary or discouragement had seized upon\r\n      you, and you had remained on a lower step or had turned\r\n      back and gone down again, that spectacle would have been\r\n      lost to you.--Sometimes, however, the tower has only a\r\n      single opening, in the centre or at the top.--The tower of\r\n      your life is built so.--In that case you must have more\r\n      obstinate courage, perseverance armed with sharper nails,\r\n      to cling, in the darkness, to the protruding stones, and\r\n      to reach the opening, resplendent with light, through\r\n      which the eye embraces the surrounding country; or it\r\n      may be that the loopholes have been filled up, or no one\r\n      has thought to cut them, and then you must go on to the\r\n      summit; but the higher one goes without looking out, the\r\n      more extended the horizon seems, and the greater the\r\n      surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      O Th\xc3\xa9odore, God grant that I may soon reach the point\r\n      where the window is! For a long, long time I have been\r\n      following the winding staircase in the most profound\r\n      darkness; but I am afraid the opening has never been\r\n      cut and I must climb to the very top; and suppose this\r\n      staircase with the countless stairs should end at a\r\n      walled-up doorway, or an arch closed by blocks of stone?\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Do not say that, Rosette, do not think it.--What architect\r\n      would build a stairway that led nowhere? Why imagine that\r\n      the placid Architect of the world was stupider and less\r\n      far-sighted than an ordinary architect? God makes no\r\n      mistakes and forgets nothing. It is incredible that He\r\n      should have amused Himself by playing a trick upon you\r\n      and shutting you up in a long stone tunnel without exit\r\n      or opening. Why should you suppose that He would haggle\r\n      with such poor ants as we are over our paltry momentary\r\n      happiness and the imperceptible grain of millet that falls\r\n      to each of us in this immeasurable universe?--In order to\r\n      do that He must be as savage as a tiger or a judge; and if\r\n      we were so obnoxious to Him, He would simply have to bid\r\n      a comet turn aside a little from its path and annihilate\r\n      us all with a hair of its tail. How the devil can you\r\n      think that God diverts Himself by spitting us all on a\r\n      gold pin as the Emperor Domitian did with flies?--God\r\n      isn\'t a concierge or a church-warden, and although He is\r\n      old, He is not yet in His dotage. All such petty malice\r\n      is beneath Him and He is not foolish enough to show off\r\n      His smartness to us and play tricks on us.--Courage,\r\n      Rosette, courage! If you are out of breath, stop a bit and\r\n      take breath and then continue your upward course; perhaps\r\n      you have only a score more steps to climb to reach the\r\n      embrasure from which you will see your happiness.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      Never! oh never! and if I reach the top of the tower, it\r\n      will only be to hurl myself from it.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      Banish these gloomy thoughts that flutter about you like\r\n      bats, and cast the opaque shadow of their wings on your\r\n      fair brow, my poor afflicted one. If you want me to love\r\n      you, be happy, and do not weep. (_He draws her gently to\r\n      his side and kisses her on the eyes_).\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      What a misfortune for me that I ever knew you! and yet, if\r\n      I could live my life over, I would still prefer to have\r\n      known you.--Your harshness has been sweeter to me than\r\n      the passion of other men; and, although you have made me\r\n      suffer intensely, all the pleasure I have ever had has\r\n      come to me from you; through you I have caught a glimpse\r\n      of what I might have been. You have been a flash of\r\n      light in my darkness, and you have illuminated many dark\r\n      places in my soul; you have opened new perspectives in my\r\n      life.--I owe it to you that I know what love is,--unhappy\r\n      love, it is true; but there is a melancholy and profound\r\n      fascination in loving without being loved, and it is\r\n      pleasant to remember those who forget us. It is a joy\r\n      simply to be able to love, even when one loves alone, and\r\n      many die without having had it, and often they who love\r\n      are not the most to be pitied.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      They suffer and feel their wounds, but at all events\r\n      they live. They have some interest in life; they have\r\n      a star about which they gravitate, a pole toward which\r\n      they ardently extend their hands. They have something to\r\n      long for; they can say to themselves: "If I reach that\r\n      point, if I obtain that, I shall be happy."--They suffer\r\n      frightful agony, but when they die, they can at least say\r\n      to themselves: "I am dying for him."--To die thus is to\r\n      be born again. The really unhappy, the only ones who are\r\n      irreparably so, are they whose wild embrace takes in the\r\n      whole universe, they who want everything and nothing, and\r\n      who would be embarrassed and speechless if an angel or\r\n      fairy should descend to earth and say suddenly to them:\r\n      "Express one wish and it shall be gratified."\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      If a fairy should come I know what I would ask her.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      You know, Rosette, and therein you are happier than I, for\r\n      I do not know. There are in my heart many vague longings,\r\n      which become confounded with one another and give birth\r\n      to others which eventually consume them. My desires are a\r\n      cloud of birds that fly aimlessly this way and that; yours\r\n      is an eagle that has its eyes on the sun and is prevented\r\n      by lack of air from soaring upward on its outspread wings.\r\n      Ah! if I could only know what I want; if the idea that\r\n      haunts me would stand out clear and well-defined from\r\n      the mist that envelops it; if the lucky or unlucky star\r\n      would appear in the depths of my sky; if the light I am to\r\n      follow would shine out through the darkness, a deceitful\r\n      will-o\'-the-wisp or a friendly beacon; if my column of\r\n      fire would go on before me, even though it were through\r\n      a desert without manna and without springs of water; if\r\n      I knew where I am going, even though my path ends at a\r\n      precipice!--I would prefer the wild flights of accursed\r\n      huntsmen through bogs and thickets, to this absurd and\r\n      monotonous stamping and pawing. To live thus is to follow\r\n      a trade like that of the horses with bandages over their\r\n      eyes, who turn the wheel of a well, and travel thousands\r\n      of leagues without seeing anything or changing their\r\n      position.--I have been turning a long while, and the\r\n      bucket ought to be at the top.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      You resemble D\'Albert in many ways, and, when you speak,\r\n      it seems to me sometimes as if he were speaking.--I\r\n      have no doubt that, when you know him better, you will\r\n      become much attached to him; you cannot fail to suit each\r\n      other.--He is tormented as you are, by these same aimless\r\n      impulses; he is head over ears in love but does not know\r\n      with what; he would like to ascend to Heaven, for the\r\n      earth seems to him like a stool hardly fit for one of his\r\n      feet to rest upon, and he has more pride than Lucifer\r\n      before his fall.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      I was afraid at first that he was one of those poets, of\r\n      whom there are so many, who have driven poetry off the\r\n      face of the earth, one of those stringers of false pearls\r\n      who see nothing in the world but the last syllables of\r\n      words, and who, when they have made _ombre_ rhyme with\r\n      _sombre, flame_ with _\xc3\xa2me_, and _Dieu_ with _lieu_, fold\r\n      their arms and legs conscientiously and permit the spheres\r\n      to accomplish their revolutions.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      He is not one of that kind. His verses are beneath him and\r\n      do not contain his thought. You would form a very mistaken\r\n      idea of his nature from what he has written; his real\r\n      poem is himself, and I don\'t know if he will ever produce\r\n      another. He has, in the depths of his mind, a seraglio of\r\n      choice ideas which he surrounds with a triple wall, and\r\n      of which he is more jealous than ever sultan was of his\r\n      odalisques.--He puts in his poetry only those ideas that\r\n      he holds in light esteem, or with which he has become\r\n      disgusted; he makes his verse the door through which he\r\n      expels them and the world receives only those for which he\r\n      has no further use.\r\n\r\n      TH\xc3\x89ODORE.\r\n\r\n      I can understand his jealousy and his modesty.--Just as\r\n      many men do not care for the love they have had until they\r\n      no longer have it, or for their mistresses until they are\r\n      dead.\r\n\r\n      ROSETTE.\r\n\r\n      It is so hard for one to have anything to one\'s self in\r\n      this world! every candle attracts so many moths, every\r\n      treasure attracts so many thieves!--I love the silent men\r\n      who carry their ideas to the grave and do not choose to\r\n      abandon them to the filthy kisses and shameless handling\r\n      of the vulgar crowd. Those lovers please me best who do\r\n      not carve their mistress\'s name on the bark of any tree,\r\n      who confide it to no echo, and who, while they sleep, are\r\n      haunted by the fear that they may utter it in a dream. I\r\n      am one of that number; I have not divulged my thoughts\r\n      and no one shall know my love.--But it is almost eleven\r\n      o\'clock, my dear Th\xc3\xa9odore, and I am preventing your taking\r\n      rest that you must sadly need. When I am obliged to leave\r\n      you I always have a feeling of oppression at my heart, and\r\n      it seems to me as if it were the last time I should ever\r\n      see you. I postpone it as long as I can; but I always have\r\n      to go at last. Good-night, for I am afraid D\'Albert may\r\n      be looking for me; good-night, my dear friend.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore put his arm around her waist and thus escorted her to the\r\ndoor; there he stopped and followed her a long time with his glance;\r\nthe corridor was lighted at intervals by small windows with narrow\r\npanes, through which the moon shone, making alternate light and dark\r\npatches of fantastic shape. At each window Rosette\'s pure, white form\r\ngleamed like a silvery phantom; then it vanished to appear, even more\r\nbrilliant, a little farther away; at last it disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore stood for some moments motionless, with folded arms, as\r\nif buried in profound meditation; then he passed his hand over his\r\nforehead and threw back his hair with a jerk of his head, returned to\r\nhis room, and went to bed after kissing the brow of the page, who was\r\nstill asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the daylight entered Rosette\'s room, D\'Albert made his\r\nappearance, with an eagerness that was not usual with him.\r\n\r\n"Here you are," said Rosette, "I would say very early, if you could\r\never arrive early.--To reward you for your gallantry I present you my\r\nhand to kiss."\r\n\r\nAnd she drew from beneath the sheet of Flemish linen trimmed with lace\r\nthe prettiest little hand that was ever seen at the end of a plump,\r\nwell-shaped arm.\r\n\r\nD\'Albert kissed it with compunction:--"And the other, little sister,\r\nare we not to kiss that too?"\r\n\r\n_"Mon Dieu_, yes! nothing is easier. I am in my Sunday humor to-day;\r\nhere."--And she extended her other hand with which she tapped him\r\nlightly on the lips.--"Am I not the most obliging woman on earth?"\r\n\r\n"You are grace itself, and temples of white marble should be erected to\r\nyou in thickets of myrtle.--Really, I am very much afraid that the same\r\nthing will happen to you that happened to Psyche, and that Venus will\r\nbe jealous of you," said D\'Albert, taking the fair one\'s hands in one\r\nof his and raising them together to his lips.\r\n\r\n"How you say all that without taking breath! any one would think it was\r\nsomething you had learned by heart," said Rosette, with a delicious\r\nlittle pout.\r\n\r\n"No; you deserve to have the phrase turned expressly for you, and\r\nyou were made to pluck the virgin bloom from compliments," rejoined\r\nD\'Albert.\r\n\r\n"Oho! whatever is the matter with you to-day? are you ill that you are\r\nso gallant? I fear you are dying. Do you know that when one\'s character\r\nsuddenly changes, and without any apparent reason, it is an evil omen?\r\nNow it is a well-known fact, to all the women who have taken the pains\r\nto love you, that you are usually as morose as a man can be, and it is\r\nno less certain that at this moment you are as charming as a man can\r\nbe, and inexplicably amiable.--Really, I think you are pale, my poor\r\nD\'Albert: give me your arm and let me feel your pulse;" and she pushed\r\nback his sleeve and counted the pulsations with mock gravity.--"No,\r\nyou are perfectly well and you haven\'t the slightest symptom of fever.\r\nIn that case I must be furiously pretty this morning! Go and find my\r\nmirror so that I can see how far your gallantry is justified."\r\n\r\nD\'Albert brought a small mirror from the toilet-table and placed it on\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n"In truth," said Rosette, "you are not altogether wrong. Why don\'t you\r\nwrite a sonnet on my eyes, _Monsieur le Po\xc3\xa8te._ You have no excuse\r\nfor not doing it. Just see how unfortunate I am! to have eyes like\r\nthese and a poet like this, and to be left without sonnets just as if\r\nI were one-eyed and had a water-carrier for a lover! You don\'t love\r\nme, monsieur; you have never written so much as an acrostic sonnet for\r\nme.--And my mouth, what do you think of that? I have kissed you with\r\nthat mouth and perhaps I will kiss you with it again, my dark-browed\r\nbeauty; and upon my word, it is a favor that you hardly deserve--I am\r\nnot speaking of to-day, for to-day you deserve anything;--but, to talk\r\nabout something beside myself, you are incomparably fresh and comely\r\nthis morning, you look like a brother of Aurora, and, although it is\r\nhardly daylight, you are already arrayed in your best clothes as if for\r\na ball. Can it be that you have designs upon me? and do you meditate\r\ndealing an unexpected and final blow to my virtue? do you propose to\r\nmake a conquest of me? But I forget that you have already done that,\r\nand that it\'s ancient history."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t joke like that, Rosette; you know that I love you."\r\n\r\n"Why, that depends. I don\'t know it; and you?"\r\n\r\n"I know it perfectly well, and from such symptoms that, if you should\r\nhave the kindness to forbid me your door, I should try to prove it\r\nto you, and I venture to flatter myself that I should do it most\r\ntriumphantly."\r\n\r\n"Not that way: however anxious I may be to be convinced, my door will\r\nremain open; I am too pretty to be shut up behind closed doors; the sun\r\nshines for one and all, and my beauty shall be like the sun to-day, if\r\nyou approve."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honor I strongly disapprove; but act as if I approved as\r\nstrongly. I am your very humble slave, and I lay my wishes at your\r\nfeet."\r\n\r\n"That is as jolly as can be; continue to entertain such sentiments and\r\nleave your key in your door to-night."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le Chevalier Th\xc3\xa9odore de S\xc3\xa9rannes,"--said a huge negro,\r\nputting his round, good-humored face between the wings of the\r\nfolding-door, "desires to pay his respects to you and begs that you\r\nwill deign to receive him."\r\n\r\n"Admit Monsieur le Chevalier," said Rosette, pulling the sheet up to\r\nher chin.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore went first to Rosette\'s bed and made a very low and graceful\r\ncourtesy, which she returned with a friendly nod; then he turned to\r\nD\'Albert, whom he also saluted in an off-hand, courteous manner.\r\n\r\n"What were you talking about?" said Th\xc3\xa9odore. "It may be that I\r\ninterrupted an interesting conversation: go on, I beg, and tell me in a\r\nfew words what it is all about."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" Rosette replied with a mischievous smile; "we were talking\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter VII--_"Admit Monsieur le Chevalier," said Rosette,\r\npulling the sheet up to her chin._\r\n\r\n_Th\xc3\xa9odore went first to Rosette\'s bed and made a very low and graceful\r\ncourtesy, which she returned with a friendly nod; then he turned to\r\nD\'Albert, whom he also saluted in an off-hand, courteous manner._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore seated himself at the foot of Rosette\'s bed, for D\'Albert\r\nhad taken his place at her pillow, by right of having arrived first.\r\nThe conversation wandered for some time from subject to subject, very\r\nbright and gay and animated, and that is why we do not report it; we\r\nshould be afraid that it would lose too much in being transcribed. The\r\nmanner, the tone, the vivacity of speech and gesture, the countless\r\nways of uttering a word, the effervescent wit, like the foam of\r\nchampagne which sparkles and evaporates at once, are details that\r\nit is impossible to note down and reproduce. We leave that hiatus\r\nfor the reader to fill, and he will certainly acquit himself of the\r\ntask better than we could do. Let him imagine here five or six pages\r\nfilled with whatever is most capricious, most refined, most curiously\r\noriginal, most ingenious and most sparkling in the way of conversation.\r\n\r\nWe are well aware that we are resorting to an artifice which reminds\r\none a little of that resorted to by Timanthes, who, in despair of ever\r\nbeing able to reproduce Agamemnon\'s face, threw some drapery over his\r\nhead; but we prefer to be timid rather than imprudent.\r\n\r\nIt would not perhaps be amiss to inquire into the motives that had led\r\nD\'Albert to rise so early, and what spur had impelled him to call upon\r\nRosette at as unseasonable an hour as if he had still been in love.--It\r\nwould appear as if it were a slight attack of secret, unconfessed\r\njealousy. To be sure he cared but little for Rosette, indeed he would\r\nhave been very glad to be rid of her,--but he preferred to leave her\r\nvoluntarily and not to be left by her, a thing which always inflicts a\r\ndeep wound on a man\'s pride, although his first flame may be utterly\r\nextinct.--Th\xc3\xa9odore was such a well-favored cavalier that it was\r\ndifficult to view his appearance on the scene while a liaison was in\r\nprogress without apprehending what had in fact happened many times,\r\nthat is to say, that all eyes would turn in his direction and the\r\nhearts follow the eyes; and, strangely enough, although he had taken\r\naway many women, no lover had harbored the enduring resentment that\r\nmen usually feel for those who have supplanted them. There was in his\r\nwhole behavior such winning charm, such unaffected grace, a something\r\nso gentle and so dignified, that even men were touched by it. D\'Albert,\r\nwho had come to Rosette\'s room, intending to speak very sharply to\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore, if he should meet him there, was greatly surprised to find\r\nthat he did not feel the slightest sensation of anger in his presence,\r\nand that he was inclined to receive with warmth the advances he made.\r\nIn half an hour\'s time, you would have said that they had been friends\r\nfrom boyhood, and yet D\'Albert felt in his inmost heart, that if\r\nRosette was destined ever to love, she would love that man, and he had\r\nevery reason to be jealous, for the future at least, for he did not\r\nsuspect anything at present. What would he have thought, had he seen\r\nthe fair creature in a white _peignoir_ gliding like a night-moth on a\r\nmoonbeam into the handsome youth\'s room, and coming out three or four\r\nhours later with mysterious precautions? He might well, in very truth,\r\nhave deemed himself more unfortunate than he really was, for it is a\r\nthing rarely seen that a pretty, lovelorn young woman comes forth from\r\nthe bedroom of a no less attractive young man, exactly the same as when\r\nshe went in.\r\n\r\nRosette listened to Th\xc3\xa9odore with much attention and as one listens to\r\na person one loves; but what he said was so entertaining and upon so\r\nmany different subjects, that her attention was perfectly natural and\r\neasily explained. And so D\'Albert took no offence at it. Th\xc3\xa9odore\'s\r\nmanner toward Rosette was courteous and friendly, but nothing more.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do to-day, Th\xc3\xa9odore?" said Rosette, "suppose we go for a\r\nrow on the river? what do you think? or shall we hunt?"\r\n\r\n"To hunt is less depressing than to glide over the water side by side\r\nwith some tired swan and thrust the water-lily leaves aside to right\r\nand left,--don\'t you think so, D\'Albert?"\r\n\r\n"I think perhaps I should enjoy gliding down the river in the skiff\r\nquite as much as racing madly in the trail of some poor beast; but\r\nwherever you go, I will go; what we have to do now is to allow Madame\r\nRosette to rise and don a suitable costume."\r\n\r\nRosette made a sign of assent and rang for her maid to come and dress\r\nher. The two young men left the room arm in arm, and it was easy to\r\nguess, from seeing them on such good terms, that one was the titular\r\nlover and the other the loved lover of the same person.\r\n\r\nSoon everybody was ready. D\'Albert and Th\xc3\xa9odore were already mounted\r\nin the first court-yard, when Rosette, in a riding-habit, appeared at\r\nthe top of the steps. She had assumed with the costume, a sprightly,\r\nresolute air that was immensely becoming to her; she leaped into the\r\nsaddle with her ordinary agility and gave her horse a smart blow with\r\nher crop, so that he darted away like an arrow. D\'Albert spurred after\r\nher and soon overtook her. Th\xc3\xa9odore allowed them some little start,\r\nbeing sure of catching them up whenever he chose. He seemed to be\r\nwaiting for something and turned back frequently toward the ch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\n\r\n"Th\xc3\xa9odore! Th\xc3\xa9odore! come on! are you riding a wooden horse?" cried\r\nRosette.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore urged his horse to a gallop and diminished the distance\r\nbetween him and Rosette, but did not join her.\r\n\r\nHe continued to look back at the ch\xc3\xa2teau, which they were beginning\r\nto lose sight of; a little cloud of dust, in the centre of which\r\nsomething that they could not as yet distinguish was moving very\r\nrapidly, appeared at the end of the road. In a few moments the cloud\r\nreached Th\xc3\xa9odore\'s side, and, opening like the classic clouds of the\r\nIliad, disclosed the fresh and rosy face of the mysterious page.\r\n\r\n"Come, Th\xc3\xa9odore, come!" cried Rosette again; "give your tortoise the\r\nspur and join us."\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore gave his horse the rein, and in a second, the animal, who was\r\npawing and rearing impatiently, had passed D\'Albert and Rosette by\r\nseveral lengths.\r\n\r\n"Who loves me follows me," said Th\xc3\xa9odore, leaping a fence four feet\r\nhigh. "Well, well, _Monsieur le Po\xc3\xa8te_," he said, when he was on the\r\nother side, "you don\'t jump? but they say your steed has wings."\r\n\r\n"Faith, I prefer to ride around; I have only one head to break after\r\nall; if I had several I would try," D\'Albert replied with a smile.\r\n\r\n"No one loves me then, as no one follows me," said Th\xc3\xa9odore, bringing\r\nthe arched corners of his mouth even lower than usual. The little page\r\nlooked up at him reproachfully with his great blue eyes, and drove his\r\nheels into his horse\'s sides.\r\n\r\nThe horse gave a tremendous leap.\r\n\r\n"Yes! some one," said the child from the other side of the fence.\r\n\r\nRosette cast a strange glance at the boy and blushed up to her eyes;\r\nthen, with a furious blow of the crop on the mare\'s neck, she leaped\r\nthe barrier of green apple wood that barred the path.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I don\'t love you, Th\xc3\xa9odore?"\r\n\r\nThe child darted an oblique, stealthy glance at her and rode up to\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore.\r\n\r\nD\'Albert was in the middle of the path--and saw nothing of all this;\r\nfor, from time immemorial, it has been the privilege of fathers,\r\nhusbands and lovers to see nothing.\r\n\r\n"Isnabel," said Th\xc3\xa9odore, "you are mad, and so are you, Rosette! You\r\ndidn\'t take enough start for your jump, Isnabel, and you, Rosette,\r\njust missed catching your dress on the posts.--You might have killed\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"What difference would it make?" rejoined Rosette, in such a\r\nmelancholy, despairing tone that Isnabel forgave her for having leaped\r\nthe barrier.\r\n\r\nThey rode on for some distance and reached the crossroads where the\r\nhuntsmen and the pack were to meet them. Six arched paths, cut through\r\nthe dense forest, met at a little stone tower with six sides, on\r\neach of which was carved the name of the road that ended there. The\r\ntrees rose so high that they seemed to be trying to spin the woolly,\r\nfleecy clouds that a brisk breeze carried hither and thither over their\r\ntowering tops; tall, thick grass and impenetrable thickets provided\r\nhiding-places and strongholds for the game, and the hunt promised to\r\nbe a successful one. It was a true forest of an earlier age, with\r\noaks more than a hundred years old, such trees as we never see, now\r\nthat we no longer plant trees and have not the patience to wait for\r\nthose that are planted to grow;--a hereditary forest, planted by\r\ngreat-grandfathers for fathers, by fathers for grandsons, with paths\r\nof enormous width, the obelisk surmounted by a ball, the rock-work\r\nfountain, the inevitable pool, and the keepers with powdered wigs,\r\nyellow leather breeches and sky-blue coats;--one of those dense,\r\ndark forests in which the white, glossy coats of Wouvermans\' great\r\nhorses stand out in bold relief, and the flaring mouths of the hunting\r\nhorns _\xc3\xa0 la Dampierre_ that Parrocel loves to paint on the backs of\r\nhis huntsmen.--A multitude of dogs\' tails, shaped like crescents or\r\nreaping-hooks, waved frantically about in a dusty cloud. The signal\r\nwas given, the dogs, straining at their leashes, were uncoupled, and\r\nthe hunt began.--We shall not undertake to describe with precision\r\nthe detours and doublings of the stag through the forest;--we do not\r\neven feel sure whether it was a stag seven years old, and, despite\r\nour investigations on that point, we have not been able to satisfy\r\nourselves--which is really distressing.--Nevertheless we can but think\r\nthat in such a forest, so venerable, so dark, so seignorial, there\r\ncould be none but seven-year stags, and we do not see why the one after\r\nwhich the four principal characters in this romance were galloping on\r\nhorses of different colors, and _non passibus \xc3\xa6quis_, should not have\r\nbeen such a one.\r\n\r\nThe stag ran, like the true stag that he was, and some fifty dogs or\r\nmore that followed at his heels were no slight spur to his natural\r\nswiftness of foot. The pace was so fleet that only an occasional bark\r\ncould be heard.\r\n\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore, being the best mounted and the best rider, kept on the heels\r\nof the pack with incredible zeal. D\'Albert was close behind him.\r\nRosette and the little page Isnabel followed, falling farther and\r\nfarther behind.\r\n\r\nThe interval was soon so great that they could not hope to join their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we stop for a moment and let our horses take breath," said\r\nRosette. "The hunt is going toward the pond and I know a crossroad by\r\nwhich we can reach there as soon as they do."\r\n\r\nIsnabel drew in his little mountain pony, who put down his head, shook\r\nhis forelock down over his eyes and began to paw the gravel with his\r\nhoofs.\r\n\r\nThe little creature presented a most striking contrast to Rosette\'s\r\nmare; he was as black as night, she as white as white satin; his mane\r\nand tail were bristly and unkempt; her mane was tied with blue ribbons\r\nand her tail combed and curled. She looked like a unicorn, he like a\r\nspaniel.\r\n\r\nThere was the same marked difference between the riders as between\r\ntheir steeds.--Rosette\'s hair was as black as Isnabel\'s was fair; her\r\neyebrows were very clearly marked and very prominent; those of the\r\npage were hardly darker than his skin and resembled the down on a\r\npeach.--The coloring of the one was as brilliant and enduring as the\r\nlight at noonday; the other had the transparent blushing hue of early\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we try now to overtake the hunt?" said Isnabel; "the horses\r\nhave had time to recover their breath."\r\n\r\n"Come on!" replied the pretty Amazon, and they galloped away through a\r\nnarrow transverse path leading to the pool; the two horses ran neck and\r\nneck and filled the whole path.\r\n\r\nOn Isnabel\'s side, a gnarled and twisted tree stretched out a huge\r\nbranch like an arm, and seemed to shake its fist at the riders.--The\r\nchild did not see it.\r\n\r\n"Look out!" cried Rosette, "lean forward on your saddle! you will be\r\nunhorsed."\r\n\r\nThe warning came too late; the branch struck Isnabel in the middle of\r\nthe body. The violence of the blow caused him to lose his stirrups,\r\nand, as his horse galloped on and the branch was too stout to bend, he\r\nwas brushed from his saddle and thrown rudely back.\r\n\r\nThe child fainted on the spot.--Rosette, terribly frightened, leaped\r\nfrom her horse and knelt beside the page, who gave no sign of life.\r\n\r\nHis cap had fallen off and his lovely, rippling fair hair lay spread\r\nabout over the gravel in every direction.--His little open palms looked\r\nas if they were made of wax, they were so devoid of color. Rosette\r\nknelt beside him and tried to restore him to consciousness.--She had\r\nno salts or flask with her and her embarrassment was great. At last\r\nshe discovered a deep rut in which the rain-water had collected and\r\nclarified; she dipped her fingers in it, to the great alarm of a little\r\ntoad that was the naiad of that stream, and shook a few drops on the\r\nyoung page\'s blue-veined temples.--He did not seem to feel them, and\r\nthe pearls of water rolled down his white cheeks as a sylph\'s tears\r\nroll down the leaf of a lily. Rosette, thinking that his clothes\r\nmight distress him, unbuckled his belt, unbuttoned his doublet and\r\nopened his shirt to give his lungs freer play.--Thereupon Rosette saw\r\nsomething that would have been the most agreeable of surprises to a\r\nman, but that seemed very far from affording her any pleasure--for her\r\nbrows contracted and her upper lip trembled slightly;--she saw a snowy\r\nwhite breast, which was as yet undeveloped, but which made the fairest\r\npromises and already fulfilled many of them; a smooth and rounded\r\nbreast, as white as ivory, and in the language of the Ronsardists,\r\ndelicious to look at, more delicious to kiss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapter VII--_Rosette, thinking that his clothes might\r\ndistress him, unbuckled his belt, unbuttoned his doublet and opened his\r\nshirt to give his lungs freer play.--Thereupon Rosette saw something\r\nthat would have been the most agreeable of surprises to a man, but that\r\nseemed very far from affording her any pleasure_----]\r\n\r\n"A woman!" she exclaimed, "a woman! ah! Th\xc3\xa9odore!"\r\n\r\nIsnabel--for we will continue to call him by that name, although it\r\nwas not his--began to show some signs of life and languidly raised\r\nhis long eyelashes; he was not wounded in any way, he was simply\r\nstunned.--He soon sat up and, with Rosette\'s assistance, was able to\r\nstand and remount his horse, which had stopped as soon as he felt that\r\nhis rider was gone.\r\n\r\nThey rode slowly to the pool, where they found the remainder of\r\nthe hunting party. Rosette in a few words told Th\xc3\xa9odore what had\r\nhappened.--He changed color several times during her recital, and\r\nthroughout the rest of the ride he kept his horse close beside\r\nIsnabel\'s.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the ch\xc3\xa2teau betimes; the day that had begun so\r\njoyously, had a decidedly melancholy ending.\r\n\r\nRosette was in a meditative mood and D\'Albert seemed as deeply\r\nengrossed in his reflections. The reader will soon learn what had given\r\nrise to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, my dear Silvio, I have not forgotten you; I am not one of those\r\nwho go through life without a backward glance; my past follows me and\r\nencroaches upon my present, and almost upon my future; your friendship\r\nis one of the sunlit spots that stand out most clearly on the blue\r\nhorizon of my later years; often, from the peak on which I stand, I\r\nturn to gaze upon it with a feeling of ineffable melancholy.\r\n\r\nOh! what lovely weather it was!--how angelically pure we were!--Our\r\nfeet hardly touched the ground, we had wings on our shoulders, as it\r\nwere, our desires carried us away and the fair halo of youth around our\r\nforeheads trembled in the breeze of spring.\r\n\r\nDo you remember the little island covered with poplars at the spot\r\nwhere the river forms a little arm?--To reach it we had to cross\r\na long, very narrow plank that bent in the middle, with a strange\r\nsensation; an excellent bridge for goats and little used, in fact,\r\nexcept by them: it was a delightful spot.--Short, thick grass where\r\nthe forget-me-not opened its pretty little blue twinkling eye, a path,\r\nas yellow as nankeen, that served as a belt for the green robe of the\r\nislet and encircled its waist, the constantly moving shadow of aspens\r\nand poplars, were not the least charms of that paradise;--there were\r\ngreat pieces of linen that the women stretched out to whiten in the\r\ndew;--one would have said they were square patches of snow.--And the\r\nlittle dark, sun-burned girl whose great wild eyes sparkled so brightly\r\nunder her long locks, and who ran after the goats, threatening them\r\nwith her osier switch when they were on the point of walking on the\r\nlinen she was watching--do you remember her?--And the sulphur-colored\r\nbutterflies, with their irregular, hesitating flight, and the\r\nkingfisher we tried so many times to catch, that had its nest in the\r\nclump of alders; and the banks sloping to the river, with the steps\r\nroughly hewn in the rock, with their posts and stakes, all green at\r\nthe bottom and almost always closed by a hedge of plants and branches?\r\nHow smooth and clear the water was! how the golden gravel glistened\r\nat the bottom! and how pleasant it was to sit on the bank and dabble\r\nour toes in the stream! The water-lily, with its golden flowers\r\nunfolding gracefully, seemed like green hairs floating on the gleaming\r\nback of some nymph in the bath.--The sky gazed at its reflection in\r\nthat mirror with azure smiles and transparent rifts of pearl-gray\r\nof most bewitching beauty, and at every hour in the day there were\r\nturquoise blues, golden yellows, fleecy whites and flickering shades\r\nin inexhaustible variety.--How I loved those flocks of ducks with the\r\nemerald necks that sailed incessantly from bank to bank and caused an\r\noccasional wrinkle on that glassy surface!\r\n\r\nAnd how well adapted we were to be the figures in that landscape!--how\r\nattached we became to those sweet, restful scenes, and how easily we\r\nharmonized ourselves with them! Springtime without, youth within, the\r\nsun on the turf, a smile on the lips, snow-white blossoms on all the\r\nbushes, fair illusions blooming in our minds, a modest flush upon our\r\ncheeks and on the eglantine, poetry singing in our hearts, invisible\r\nbirds humming among the trees, bright light, cooing doves, perfumes, a\r\nthousand confused murmurs, the beating of the heart, the water stirring\r\na pebble, a wisp of grass or a thought springing up, a drop of water\r\nrolling down the side of a flower, a tear flowing from beneath an\r\neyelid, a sigh of love, the rustling of a leaf;--what evenings we have\r\npassed there, walking slowly, so near the edge that we often had one\r\nfoot in the water and the other on land!\r\n\r\nAlas!--that lasted a very short time, in my case at least; for you,\r\nwhile acquiring the knowledge of a man, were able to retain the\r\ninnocence of a child.--The seed of corruption that was within me\r\ndeveloped very rapidly, and the gangrene pitilessly devoured all that\r\nwas pure and saintlike about me. The only good that remained was my\r\nfriendship for you.\r\n\r\nI am accustomed to conceal nothing from you--neither acts nor thoughts.\r\nI have laid bare before you the most secret fibres of my heart; however\r\nstrange, absurd, eccentric the movements of my mind, I must needs\r\ndescribe them to you; but, in truth, my sensations for some time past\r\nhave been so strange that I hardly dare confess them to myself. I\r\ntold you at some time that I was afraid that by dint of seeking the\r\nbeautiful and straining every nerve to attain it, I should fall into\r\nthe impossible or the horrible.--I have almost reached that point;\r\nwhen, then, shall I get clear of all these currents that cross and\r\nrecross one another and drag me to right and left; when will the deck\r\nof my vessel cease to tremble under my feet and to be swept by the\r\nwaves of every storm? where shall I find a haven in which I can cast\r\nanchor, and an immovable rock out of reach of the waves, whereon I can\r\ndry myself and wring the spray from my hair?\r\n\r\nYou know how ardently I have sought physical beauty, what importance I\r\nattach to physical form, and what affection I have conceived for the\r\nvisible world; it must be because I am too corrupt and too _blas\xc3\xa9_\r\nto believe in moral beauty, and to pursue it with any constancy.--I\r\nhave completely lost the power to distinguish between good and evil,\r\nand, by force of depravity, I have almost reverted to the ignorance\r\nof the savage and the child. In fact, nothing seems praiseworthy or\r\nblameworthy to me, and the most extraordinary actions surprise me but\r\nlittle. My conscience is a deaf mute. Adultery seems to me the most\r\ninnocent thing in the world; I find it quite natural that a girl should\r\nprostitute her person; it seems to me that I would betray my friends\r\nwithout the slightest remorse, and I should not have the slightest\r\nscruple in kicking over a precipice people who annoyed me, if I were\r\nwalking on the brink with them.--I could witness the most atrocious\r\nscenes with indifference, and there is something that is not unpleasant\r\nto me in the sufferings and woes of humanity.--I have the same\r\nsensation of acrimonious, bitter joy when some great disaster falls on\r\nthe world, that one feels when one takes revenge for an old insult.\r\n\r\nO world, what hast thou done to me that I should hate thee so? Who has\r\nso filled me with gall against thee? what did I expect from thee that\r\nI should bear thee such rancor for having deceived me? what high hope\r\ndidst thou disappoint? what eaglet\'s wings didst thou clip?--What doors\r\nshouldst thou have opened that have remained closed, and which of us\r\ntwo has failed the other?\r\n\r\nNothing touches me, nothing moves me;--I no longer feel, when I hear\r\nthe story of a heroic action, the sublime shudder that used to run over\r\nme from head to foot.--Indeed, it all seems to me a little foolish.--No\r\naccent is deep enough to tighten the relaxed fibres of my heart and\r\nmake them vibrate:--I look upon the tears of my fellow-mortals with the\r\nsame eye that I look upon the rain, unless they are of a particularly\r\nbeautiful water and the light is reflected prettily in them and they\r\nare flowing down a lovely cheek.--Dumb animals are almost the only\r\ncreatures for which I have a slight remnant of compassion. I would\r\nallow a peasant or a servant to be soundly whipped, but I could not\r\nstand by and see the same treatment inflicted on a horse or dog in my\r\npresence; and yet I am not evil-minded, I have never injured anybody\r\non earth and I probably never shall; but that is due rather to my\r\nnonchalance and my sovereign contempt for all those people whom I do\r\nnot like, which does not permit me to interest myself even to the\r\nextent of injuring them.--I abhor the whole world in bulk, and there\r\nare only one or two in the whole lot whom I deem worthy to be hated\r\nspecially.--To hate a person is to be as much disturbed about him as\r\nif you loved him;--it is to set him apart, to distinguish him from\r\nthe common herd; it is to be in a state of violent excitement because\r\nof him; it is to think of him by day and dream of him by night; it\r\nis to bite at your pillow and gnash your teeth as you think that he\r\nexists; what more do you do for any one you love? Would you take the\r\nsame amount of trouble to please a mistress that you take to ruin an\r\nenemy?--I doubt it--in order to hate one person intensely, one must\r\nbe in love with some other person. Every great hatred serves as a\r\ncounterpoise to a great love: and whom could I hate, when I love nobody?\r\n\r\nMy hatred is, like my love, a confused, general sentiment that seeks to\r\napply itself to some object and cannot; I have within me a treasure of\r\nhatred and love which I don\'t know what to do with, and which weighs\r\nhorribly upon me. If I can find no place to bestow one or the other\r\nor both of them, I shall burst and break apart, like a bag filled too\r\nfull of money, which rips at the seams and spills its contents.--Oh!\r\nif I could detest some one, if one of the stupid men with whom I live\r\nwould insult me in such a way as to make my old viper\'s blood boil in\r\nmy frozen veins, and force me out of this dull drowsiness in which I am\r\nstagnating; if thou, old witch with the palsied head, wouldst bite me\r\nin the cheek with thy rat\'s teeth and infect me with thy venom and thy\r\nmadness; if some one\'s death could be my life;--if the last heart-beat\r\nof an enemy writhing under my foot could send a delicious thrill\r\nthrough my hair, and the odor of his blood smell sweeter to my thirsty\r\nnostrils than the aroma of flowers, oh! how gladly would I renounce\r\nlove, and how happy I would deem myself!\r\n\r\nDeadly embraces, tiger-bites, the hug of a boa-constrictor, an\r\nelephant\'s foot placed upon a breast that is crushed and flattened\r\nbeneath it, the poisoned tail of the scorpion, the milky juice of the\r\nEuphorbia, the curved kris of the Javanese, blades that gleam at night\r\nand extinguish their gleam in blood--I call upon you now, it is you who\r\nshall replace for me the leafless roses, the moist kisses and the warm\r\nembrace of love!\r\n\r\nI love nothing, as I have said, but alas! I am afraid of loving\r\nsomething.--It would be a hundred thousand times better to hate than\r\nto have such a love!--I have found the type of beauty that I have so\r\nlong dreamed of.--I have found the body of my phantom; I have seen it,\r\nit has spoken to me, I have touched its hand, it exists; it is not a\r\nchimera. I knew that I could not be mistaken and that my presentiments\r\nnever lied.--Yes, Silvio, lam living beside the dream of my life;--my\r\nchamber is here, its chamber is there; I can see from here the curtain\r\ntrembling at its window, and the light of its lamp. Its shadow has just\r\npassed across the curtain: in an hour we shall sup together.\r\n\r\nThose lovely Turkish eyelashes, that clear, profound gaze, that warm\r\nhue of pale amber, that long glossy black hair, that nose, of proud and\r\ndelicate shape, those joints and extremities, supple and slender after\r\nthe manner of Palmegiani, the graceful curves and the pure oval contour\r\nthat give such an air of aristocratic refinement to a face--all that\r\nI longed for and would have been overjoyed to find distributed among\r\nfive or six persons, I have found united in a single person!\r\n\r\nThe thing that I adore most fervently among all earthly things is a\r\nlovely hand.--If you could see the hand of my dream! such perfection!\r\nsuch dazzling whiteness! such soft skin! such penetrating moisture! the\r\nends of the fingers so admirably tapered! the half-moon of the nails\r\nso clearly marked! such polish and such brilliant color! you would say\r\nthey were the inner petals of a rose;--Anne of Austria\'s hands, so\r\nvaunted and famous, were no more than the hands of a turkey-keeper or\r\nscullery-maid compared with these.--And then what grace, what art in\r\nthe slightest movements of the hand! how gracefully the little finger\r\nbends and stays a little apart from its tall brothers!--The thought of\r\nthat hand drives me mad and makes my lips quiver and burn.--I close my\r\neyes to avoid looking at it; but with its delicate fingers it seizes my\r\neyelashes and raises the lids, causing countless visions of ivory and\r\nsnow to pass before me.\r\n\r\nAh! doubtless it is Satan\'s claw gloved in that satin skin; it is some\r\nmocking demon making sport of me; there is witchcraft in it.--It is too\r\nmonstrously impossible.\r\n\r\nThat hand--I propose to go to Italy, to see the pictures of the great\r\nmasters, to study, compare, draw, become a painter in short, in order\r\nto be able to reproduce it as it is, as I see it, as I feel it; it will\r\nperhaps serve the purpose of ridding me of this sort of obsession.\r\n\r\nI longed for beauty; I did not know what I asked for.--It is like\r\ntrying to look at the sun without eyelids, it is like trying to\r\nhandle flames.--I suffer horribly.--To be unable to assimilate this\r\nperfection, to be unable to pass into it and to cause it to pass into\r\nme, to have no means of reproducing it and of making it feel!--When\r\nI see anything beautiful, I want to touch it with my whole self,\r\neverywhere and at the same time. I want to sing of it and paint it, to\r\ncarve it and write of it, to be loved by it as I love it; I want what\r\ncannot be and never can be.\r\n\r\nYour letter made me ill--very ill--forgive me for saying it.--All the\r\npure, tranquil happiness that you enjoy, the walks in the reddening\r\nwoods,--the long conversations, so affectionate and tender, that end\r\nwith a chaste kiss on the forehead; the serene, isolated life; the\r\ndays that pass so quickly that night seems to come before its time,\r\nmake the constant internal agitation in which I live seem even more\r\ntempestuous.--So you are to be married in two months; all the obstacles\r\nare removed, you are sure now of belonging to each other forever.\r\nYour present felicity is augmented by all the happiness in store for\r\nyou. You are happy and you are certain of being happier soon.--What a\r\ndestiny is yours!--Your beloved is beautiful, but what you have loved\r\nin her is not the mortal, palpable beauty, material beauty, but the\r\ninvisible, immortal beauty, the beauty that does not grow old, the\r\nbeauty of the soul.--She is full of charm and innocence; she loves\r\nyou as such souls know how to love.--You never looked to see if the\r\ngolden shade of her hair resembled the golden hair painted by Rubens or\r\nGiorgione; but it pleased you because it was her hair. I will wager,\r\nhappy lover that you are, that you have no idea whether your mistress\r\nis of the Grecian or Asiatic type, English or Italian.--O Silvio! how\r\nrare are the hearts that are content with pure and simple love and\r\ndesire neither a hermitage in the forest nor a garden on an island in\r\nLago Maggiore.\r\n\r\nIf I had the courage to tear myself away from here, I would go and pass\r\na month with you; perhaps I should become purified in the air that\r\nyou breathe, perhaps the shade of your avenues would bring a little\r\ncoolness to my burning brow; but no, it is a paradise in which I must\r\nnot set foot.--Hardly ought I to be allowed to gaze from afar, over\r\nthe wall, at the two fair angels who are walking there, hand in hand,\r\neyes fixed upon eyes. The devil can enter Eden only in the shape of a\r\nserpent, and, dear Adam, for all the happiness on earth, I would not be\r\nthe serpent of your Eve.\r\n\r\nWhat frightful upheaval has taken place in my soul of late! who has\r\ntransformed my blood and changed it to venom? O monstrous thought, that\r\nputtest forth thy pale green twigs and umbels of hemlock in the glacial\r\nshadow of my heart, what poisoned wind deposited there the seed from\r\nwhich thou didst spring? This, then, was what was in store for me, this\r\nis the end of all the roads that I so desperately attempted!--O fate,\r\nhow thou dost mock at me!--All those upward flights of the eagle toward\r\nthe sun, those pure flames aspiring to reach the sky, that divine\r\nmelancholy, that profound, restrained passion, that worship of beauty,\r\nthat refined and curious fancy, that unquenchable and ever-rising\r\nflood from the interior fountain, that ecstasy borne upon wings always\r\nspread, that reverie blooming brighter than the hawthorn in May--all\r\nthe poesy of my youth, all those beautiful and rare gifts were\r\ndestined to serve no other purpose than to place me beneath the lowest\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nI longed to love.--I went about like a madman, calling and invoking\r\nlove;--I writhed in frenzy because of my feeling of helplessness;\r\nI set my blood on fire, I dragged my body about in the gutters of\r\ndebauchery;--I strained to my arid heart until I almost stifled her,\r\na woman, young and beautiful, who loved me.--I ran after the passion\r\nthat avoided me. I prostituted myself, and I acted like a virgin who\r\nshould venture into an evil place, hoping to find a lover among those\r\nwhom depravity led thither, instead of waiting patiently, in dignified,\r\nsilent retirement, until the angel whom God has set aside for me\r\nshould appear in a radiant penumbra, a heavenly flower in her hand.\r\nAll these years that I have wasted in puerile agitation, in running\r\nhither and thither, in seeking to force nature and time, I should have\r\npassed in silence and meditation, in trying to make myself worthy to\r\nbe loved;--that would have been wisely done;--but I had scales over\r\nmy eyes and I marched straight to the precipice. I already have one\r\nfoot suspended over the void, and I believe that I shall soon lift the\r\nother. It is useless for me to resist, I feel that I must roll to the\r\nbottom of this new abyss that has opened within me.\r\n\r\nYes, it was thus that I imagined love. I feel now what I had\r\ndreamed.--Yes, there are the delightful yet terrible sleepless\r\nnights when the roses were thistles and the thistles roses; there\r\nare the sweet misery and the miserable joy, the ineffable trouble\r\nthat encompasses you in a golden cloud and makes objects waver\r\nbefore your eyes as drunkenness does, the ringing in the ears in\r\nwhich you always hear the last syllable of the loved one\'s name, the\r\npallor, the flushes, the sudden shivering, the burning and freezing\r\nperspiration;--all those are there; the poets do not lie.\r\n\r\nWhen I am about to enter the salon where we usually meet, my heart\r\nbeats so violently that you can see it through my clothes and I am\r\nobliged to hold it back with both hands for fear it will escape me.--If\r\nI see my dream at the end of a path and in the park, the distance\r\nvanishes at once and I have no idea what becomes of the road: it must\r\nbe that the devil takes me or that I have wings.--Nothing can distract\r\nmy thoughts: if I read, her image comes between the book and my\r\neyes;--I mount my horse, I gallop over the country, and it always seems\r\nto me that I feel its long hair mingling with mine in the wind, hear\r\nits hurried respiration, and feel its warm breath upon my cheek. The\r\nimage possesses me and follows me everywhere, and I never see it more\r\nclearly than when it is not before my eyes.\r\n\r\nYou pitied me for not being in love--pity me now because I am in love;\r\nand above all because I love what I love. What a misfortune, what a\r\ncrushing blow upon my already blasted life!--what an insensate, guilty,\r\nhateful passion has taken possession of me!--It is a shameful thing for\r\nwhich I shall never cease to blush. It is the most deplorable of all my\r\naberrations, I cannot imagine it, I cannot understand it, everything\r\nwithin me is in confusion and bewilderment; I have no idea who I am\r\nnor who others are, I doubt whether I am a man or a woman, I have a\r\nhorror of myself, I feel strange, inexplicable impulses, and there are\r\nmoments when it seems to me that my reason is going, and when the idea\r\nof my existence abandons me altogether. For a long time I have been\r\nunable to believe in anything; I have listened to myself and watched\r\nmyself closely. I have tried to disentangle the skein that has become\r\nentangled in my soul. At last, through all the veils in which it was\r\nenveloped, I have discovered the ghastly truth--Silvio, I love--Oh! no,\r\nI can never tell you--I love a man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MADEMOISELLE DE MAUPIN VOLUME 1 ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
