To come to\r\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\r\nas in one\'s own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\r\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\r\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\r\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\r\none\'s own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy.  It was\r\none of the great livery-stableman\'s most masterly intuitions to have\r\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\r\nquickly than they want to get to it.\r\n\r\nWhen Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\r\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene.  There was no reason why\r\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\r\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\r\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\r\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\r\nArcher allowed smoking.  But, in the first place, New York was a\r\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was "not the\r\nthing" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not "the\r\nthing" played a part as important in Newland Archer\'s New York as the\r\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\r\nforefathers thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for his delay was a personal one.  He had dawdled\r\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\r\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\r\nrealisation.  This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\r\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\r\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\r\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\r\ndonna\'s stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\r\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  "He loves me--he\r\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\r\nwith notes as clear as dew.\r\n\r\nShe sang, of course, "M\'ama!" and not "he loves me," since an\r\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\r\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\r\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\r\nEnglish-speaking audiences.  This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\r\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\r\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\r\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\r\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\n"M\'ama ... non m\'ama ..." the prima donna sang, and "M\'ama!", with a\r\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\r\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\r\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\r\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\r\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\r\nhouse.  Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\r\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\r\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\r\nby some of the younger members of the family.  On this occasion, the\r\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\r\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\r\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\r\nfixed on the stagelovers.  As Madame Nilsson\'s "M\'ama!" thrilled out\r\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\r\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl\'s cheek, mantled her brow\r\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\r\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\r\nsingle gardenia.  She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\r\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\r\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly.  He drew a breath of\r\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage.\r\n\r\nNo expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\r\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\r\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna.  The foreground, to the footlights,\r\nwas covered with emerald green cloth.  In the middle distance\r\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\r\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\r\nand red roses.  Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\r\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\r\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\r\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\r\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank\'s far-off\r\nprodigies.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\r\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\r\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\r\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul\'s\r\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\r\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\r\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\r\nthe right wing.\r\n\r\n"The darling!" thought Newland Archer, his glance flitting back to the\r\nyoung girl with the lilies-of-the-valley.  "She doesn\'t even guess what\r\nit\'s all about." And he contemplated her absorbed young face with a\r\nthrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation\r\nwas mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity.  "We\'ll\r\nread Faust together ... by the Italian lakes ..." he thought, somewhat\r\nhazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the\r\nmasterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to\r\nreveal to his bride.  It was only that afternoon that May Welland had\r\nlet him guess that she "cared" (New York\'s consecrated phrase of maiden\r\navowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement\r\nring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her at\r\nhis side in some scene of old European witchery.\r\n\r\nHe did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Newland Archer to be a\r\nsimpleton.  He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to\r\ndevelop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own\r\nwith the most popular married women of the "younger set," in which it\r\nwas the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully\r\ndiscouraging it.  If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he\r\nsometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife\r\nshould be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady\r\nwhose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years;\r\nwithout, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred\r\nthat unhappy being\'s life, and had disarranged his own plans for a\r\nwhole winter.\r\n\r\nHow this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain\r\nitself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but\r\nhe was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it\r\nwas that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated,\r\nbutton-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club\r\nbox, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their\r\nopera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product\r\nof the system.  In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer\r\nfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old\r\nNew York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even\r\nseen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number.\r\nSingly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they\r\nrepresented "New York," and the habit of masculine solidarity made him\r\naccept their doctrine on all the issues called moral.  He instinctively\r\nfelt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad\r\nform--to strike out for himself.\r\n\r\n"Well--upon my soul!" exclaimed Lawrence Lefferts, turning his\r\nopera-glass abruptly away from the stage.  Lawrence Lefferts was, on\r\nthe whole, the foremost authority on "form" in New York.  He had\r\nprobably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this\r\nintricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account\r\nfor his complete and easy competence.  One had only to look at him,\r\nfrom the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair\r\nmoustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean\r\nand elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of "form" must be\r\ncongenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so\r\ncarelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace.  As a\r\nyoung admirer had once said of him:  "If anybody can tell a fellow just\r\nwhen to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, it\'s\r\nLarry Lefferts."  And on the question of pumps versus patent-leather\r\n"Oxfords" his authority had never been disputed.\r\n\r\n"My God!" he said; and silently handed his glass to old Sillerton\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, following Lefferts\'s glance, saw with surprise that his\r\nexclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old\r\nMrs. Mingott\'s box.  It was that of a slim young woman, a little less\r\ntall than May Welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about her\r\ntemples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds.  The suggestion\r\nof this headdress, which gave her what was then called a "Josephine\r\nlook," was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather\r\ntheatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large\r\nold-fashioned clasp.  The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed\r\nquite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in\r\nthe centre of the box, discussing with Mrs. Welland the propriety of\r\ntaking the latter\'s place in the front right-hand corner; then she\r\nyielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs.\r\nWelland\'s sister-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who was installed in the\r\nopposite corner.\r\n\r\nMr. Sillerton Jackson had returned the opera-glass to Lawrence\r\nLefferts.  The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear\r\nwhat the old man had to say; for old Mr. Jackson was as great an\r\nauthority on "family" as Lawrence Lefferts was on "form."  He knew all\r\nthe ramifications of New York\'s cousinships; and could not only\r\nelucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between\r\nthe Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of South\r\nCarolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of\r\nPhiladelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to be\r\nconfused with the Manson Chiverses of University Place), but could also\r\nenumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance,\r\nthe fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of Leffertses (the Long\r\nIsland ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths to make foolish\r\nmatches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the\r\nAlbany Chiverses, with whom their New York cousins had always refused\r\nto intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson,\r\nwho, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a Rushworth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this forest of family trees, Mr. Sillerton Jackson\r\ncarried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of\r\nsilver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had\r\nsmouldered under the unruffled surface of New York society within the\r\nlast fifty years.  So far indeed did his information extend, and so\r\nacutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only\r\nman who could have told you who Julius Beaufort, the banker, really\r\nwas, and what had become of handsome Bob Spicer, old Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott\'s father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum\r\nof trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day\r\nthat a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged\r\naudiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship for\r\nCuba.  But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\r\nJackson\'s breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\r\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\r\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\r\nwhat he wanted to know.\r\n\r\nThe club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\r\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts\'s opera-glass.  For a moment he\r\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\r\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\r\ntwist, and said simply:  "I didn\'t think the Mingotts would have tried\r\nit on."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\r\nstrange state of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nIt was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\r\nattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed\r\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\r\nidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\r\ncreated such excitement among the initiated.  Then light dawned on him,\r\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation.  No, indeed; no one\r\nwould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on!\r\n\r\nBut they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\r\nhim left no doubt in Archer\'s mind that the young woman was May\r\nWelland\'s cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as "poor\r\nEllen Olenska."  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe\r\na day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not\r\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying\r\nwith old Mrs. Mingott.  Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\r\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their\r\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\r\nhad produced.  There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man\'s\r\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\r\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\r\nto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing\r\nfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the\r\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,\r\nwas to be announced within a few weeks.  No, he felt as old Sillerton\r\nJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on!\r\n\r\nHe knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue\'s\r\nlimits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would\r\ndare.  He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\r\nspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a\r\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\r\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\r\nwealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to "foreigners" (an\r\nItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to\r\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\r\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\r\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Mingott\'s foreign daughters had become a legend.  They never\r\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\r\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\r\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home.  But the cream-coloured\r\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian\r\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\r\nthroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\r\nTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\r\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\r\nThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like\r\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up.\r\n\r\nEvery one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old\r\nCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,\r\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings.\r\nUnkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her\r\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\r\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\r\nand dignity of her private life.  Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she\r\nwas only twenty-eight, and had "tied up" the money with an additional\r\ncaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young\r\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\r\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\r\ncircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly\r\nwith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\r\nMme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to\r\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\r\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\r\nCatherine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband\'s\r\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\r\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\r\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\r\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\r\ntransient pleasures of the table.  Therefore, for totally different\r\nreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archer\'s, and her wines did\r\nnothing to redeem it.  Her relatives considered that the penury of her\r\ntable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated\r\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\r\n"made dishes" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\r\nher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\r\nbest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  "What\'s the use of\r\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that I\'ve married the girls and can\'t\r\neat sauces?"\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\r\neyes toward the Mingott box.  He saw that Mrs. Welland and her\r\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\r\nMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\r\nand that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\r\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\r\nthe situation.  As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\r\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\r\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York\r\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\r\nwishing to pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nFew things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against\r\n"Taste," that far-off divinity of whom "Form" was the mere visible\r\nrepresentative and vicegerent.  Madame Olenska\'s pale and serious face\r\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\r\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\r\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him.  He hated to think of May\r\nWelland\'s being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\r\nof the dictates of Taste.\r\n\r\n"After all," he heard one of the younger men begin behind him\r\n(everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-Martha scenes), "after\r\nall, just WHAT happened?"\r\n\r\n"Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that."\r\n\r\n"He\'s an awful brute, isn\'t he?" continued the young enquirer, a candid\r\nThorley, who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the lady\'s\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\n"The very worst; I knew him at Nice," said Lawrence Lefferts with\r\nauthority.  "A half-paralysed white sneering fellow--rather handsome\r\nhead, but eyes with a lot of lashes.  Well, I\'ll tell you the sort:\r\nwhen he wasn\'t with women he was collecting china.  Paying any price\r\nfor both, I understand."\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh, and the young champion said:  "Well,\r\nthen----?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then; she bolted with his secretary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see."  The champion\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t last long, though: I heard of her a few months later living\r\nalone in Venice.  I believe Lovell Mingott went out to get her.  He\r\nsaid she was desperately unhappy.  That\'s all right--but this parading\r\nher at the Opera\'s another thing."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," young Thorley hazarded, "she\'s too unhappy to be left at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with an irreverent laugh, and the youth blushed\r\ndeeply, and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing\r\npeople called a "double entendre."\r\n\r\n"Well--it\'s queer to have brought Miss Welland, anyhow," some one said\r\nin a low tone, with a side-glance at Archer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s part of the campaign: Granny\'s orders, no doubt," Lefferts\r\nlaughed.  "When the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly."\r\n\r\nThe act was ending, and there was a general stir in the box.  Suddenly\r\nNewland Archer felt himself impelled to decisive action.  The desire to\r\nbe the first man to enter Mrs. Mingott\'s box, to proclaim to the\r\nwaiting world his engagement to May Welland, and to see her through\r\nwhatever difficulties her cousin\'s anomalous situation might involve\r\nher in; this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and\r\nhesitations, and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the\r\nfarther side of the house.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the box his eyes met Miss Welland\'s, and he saw that she\r\nhad instantly understood his motive, though the family dignity which\r\nboth considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so.\r\nThe persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications\r\nand pale delicacies, and the fact that he and she understood each other\r\nwithout a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any\r\nexplanation would have done.  Her eyes said:  "You see why Mamma\r\nbrought me," and his answered:  "I would not for the world have had you\r\nstay away."\r\n\r\n"You know my niece Countess Olenska?" Mrs. Welland enquired as she\r\nshook hands with her future son-in-law.  Archer bowed without extending\r\nhis hand, as was the custom on being introduced to a lady; and Ellen\r\nOlenska bent her head slightly, keeping her own pale-gloved hands\r\nclasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers.  Having greeted Mrs. Lovell\r\nMingott, a large blonde lady in creaking satin, he sat down beside his\r\nbetrothed, and said in a low tone:  "I hope you\'ve told Madame Olenska\r\nthat we\'re engaged?  I want everybody to know--I want you to let me\r\nannounce it this evening at the ball."\r\n\r\nMiss Welland\'s face grew rosy as the dawn, and she looked at him with\r\nradiant eyes.  "If you can persuade Mamma," she said; "but why should\r\nwe change what is already settled?"  He made no answer but that which\r\nhis eyes returned, and she added, still more confidently smiling:\r\n"Tell my cousin yourself: I give you leave.  She says she used to play\r\nwith you when you were children."\r\n\r\nShe made way for him by pushing back her chair, and promptly, and a\r\nlittle ostentatiously, with the desire that the whole house should see\r\nwhat he was doing, Archer seated himself at the Countess Olenska\'s side.\r\n\r\n"We DID use to play together, didn\'t we?" she asked, turning her grave\r\neyes to his.  "You were a horrid boy, and kissed me once behind a door;\r\nbut it was your cousin Vandie Newland, who never looked at me, that I\r\nwas in love with."  Her glance swept the horse-shoe curve of boxes.\r\n"Ah, how this brings it all back to me--I see everybody here in\r\nknickerbockers and pantalettes," she said, with her trailing slightly\r\nforeign accent, her eyes returning to his face.\r\n\r\nAgreeable as their expression was, the young man was shocked that they\r\nshould reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before\r\nwhich, at that very moment, her case was being tried.  Nothing could be\r\nin worse taste than misplaced flippancy; and he answered somewhat\r\nstiffly:  "Yes, you have been away a very long time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, centuries and centuries; so long," she said, "that I\'m sure I\'m\r\ndead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven;" which, for reasons\r\nhe could not define, struck Newland Archer as an even more\r\ndisrespectful way of describing New York society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt invariably happened in the same way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julius Beaufort, on the night of her annual ball, never failed to\r\nappear at the Opera; indeed, she always gave her ball on an Opera night\r\nin order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares, and\r\nher possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every\r\ndetail of the entertainment in her absence.\r\n\r\nThe Beauforts\' house was one of the few in New York that possessed a\r\nball-room (it antedated even Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s and the Headly\r\nChiverses\'); and at a time when it was beginning to be thought\r\n"provincial" to put a "crash" over the drawing-room floor and move the\r\nfurniture upstairs, the possession of a ball-room that was used for no\r\nother purpose, and left for three-hundred-and-sixty-four days of the\r\nyear to shuttered darkness, with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner\r\nand its chandelier in a bag; this undoubted superiority was felt to\r\ncompensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer, who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms,\r\nhad once said:  "We all have our pet common people--" and though the\r\nphrase was a daring one, its truth was secretly admitted in many an\r\nexclusive bosom.  But the Beauforts were not exactly common; some\r\npeople said they were even worse.  Mrs. Beaufort belonged indeed to one\r\nof America\'s most honoured families; she had been the lovely Regina\r\nDallas (of the South Carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced to\r\nNew York society by her cousin, the imprudent Medora Manson, who was\r\nalways doing the wrong thing from the right motive.  When one was\r\nrelated to the Mansons and the Rushworths one had a "droit de cite" (as\r\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, who had frequented the Tuileries, called it) in\r\nNew York society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying Julius\r\nBeaufort?\r\n\r\nThe question was: who was Beaufort?  He passed for an Englishman, was\r\nagreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty.  He had come\r\nto America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott\'s English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself\r\nan important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were\r\ndissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and\r\nwhen Medora Manson announced her cousin\'s engagement to him it was felt\r\nto be one more act of folly in poor Medora\'s long record of imprudences.\r\n\r\nBut folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two\r\nyears after young Mrs. Beaufort\'s marriage it was admitted that she had\r\nthe most distinguished house in New York.  No one knew exactly how the\r\nmiracle was accomplished.  She was indolent, passive, the caustic even\r\ncalled her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing\r\nyounger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr.\r\nBeaufort\'s heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there\r\nwithout lifting her jewelled little finger.  The knowing people said it\r\nwas Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new\r\ndishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the\r\ndinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the\r\nafter-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her\r\nfriends.  If he did, these domestic activities were privately\r\nperformed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless\r\nand hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the\r\ndetachment of an invited guest, and saying:  "My wife\'s gloxinias are a\r\nmarvel, aren\'t they?  I believe she gets them out from Kew."\r\n\r\nMr. Beaufort\'s secret, people were agreed, was the way he carried\r\nthings off.  It was all very well to whisper that he had been "helped"\r\nto leave England by the international banking-house in which he had\r\nbeen employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest--though\r\nNew York\'s business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral\r\nstandard--he carried everything before him, and all New York into his\r\ndrawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were\r\n"going to the Beauforts\'" with the same tone of security as if they had\r\nsaid they were going to Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s, and with the added\r\nsatisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks and\r\nvintage wines, instead of tepid Veuve Clicquot without a year and\r\nwarmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before the\r\nJewel Song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the third\r\nact, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared,\r\nNew York knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.\r\n\r\nThe Beaufort house was one that New Yorkers were proud to show to\r\nforeigners, especially on the night of the annual ball.  The Beauforts\r\nhad been among the first people in New York to own their own red velvet\r\ncarpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, under\r\ntheir own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and the\r\nball-room chairs.  They had also inaugurated the custom of letting the\r\nladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up to\r\nthe hostess\'s bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the\r\ngas-burner; Beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all\r\nhis wife\'s friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly\r\ncoiffees when they left home.\r\n\r\nThen the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that,\r\ninstead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at the\r\nChiverses\') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed\r\ndrawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d\'or), seeing\r\nfrom afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry,\r\nand beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and\r\ntree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled in\r\nsomewhat late.  He had left his overcoat with the silk-stockinged\r\nfootmen (the stockings were one of Beaufort\'s few fatuities), had\r\ndawdled a while in the library hung with Spanish leather and furnished\r\nwith Buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting on\r\ntheir dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whom\r\nMrs. Beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nArcher was distinctly nervous.  He had not gone back to his club after\r\nthe Opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine,\r\nhad walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back in the\r\ndirection of the Beauforts\' house.  He was definitely afraid that the\r\nMingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have Granny\r\nMingott\'s orders to bring the Countess Olenska to the ball.\r\n\r\nFrom the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that\r\nwould be; and, though he was more than ever determined to "see the\r\nthing through," he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his\r\nbetrothed\'s cousin than before their brief talk at the Opera.\r\n\r\nWandering on to the bouton d\'or drawing-room (where Beaufort had had\r\nthe audacity to hang "Love Victorious," the much-discussed nude of\r\nBouguereau) Archer found Mrs. Welland and her daughter standing near\r\nthe ball-room door.  Couples were already gliding over the floor\r\nbeyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, on\r\ngirlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettes\r\nand ornaments of the young married women\'s coiffures, and on the\r\nglitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.\r\n\r\nMiss Welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on the\r\nthreshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no other\r\nbouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candid\r\nexcitement.  A group of young men and girls were gathered about her,\r\nand there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which Mrs.\r\nWelland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualified\r\napproval.  It was evident that Miss Welland was in the act of\r\nannouncing her engagement, while her mother affected the air of\r\nparental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\nArcher paused a moment.  It was at his express wish that the\r\nannouncement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would have\r\nwished to have his happiness known.  To proclaim it in the heat and\r\nnoise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy\r\nwhich should belong to things nearest the heart.  His joy was so deep\r\nthat this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but he\r\nwould have liked to keep the surface pure too.  It was something of a\r\nsatisfaction to find that May Welland shared this feeling.  Her eyes\r\nfled to his beseechingly, and their look said:  "Remember, we\'re doing\r\nthis because it\'s right."\r\n\r\nNo appeal could have found a more immediate response in Archer\'s\r\nbreast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had been\r\nrepresented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor Ellen Olenska.\r\nThe group about Miss Welland made way for him with significant smiles,\r\nand after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed\r\ninto the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.\r\n\r\n"Now we shan\'t have to talk," he said, smiling into her candid eyes, as\r\nthey floated away on the soft waves of the Blue Danube.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer.  Her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyes\r\nremained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision.\r\n"Dear," Archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on him\r\nthat the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room,\r\nhad in them something grave and sacramental.  What a new life it was\r\ngoing to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one\'s side!\r\n\r\nThe dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered into\r\nthe conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns and\r\ncamellias Newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n"You see I did as you asked me to," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes: I couldn\'t wait," he answered smiling.  After a moment he added:\r\n"Only I wish it hadn\'t had to be at a ball."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know."  She met his glance comprehendingly.  "But after\r\nall--even here we\'re alone together, aren\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dearest--always!" Archer cried.\r\n\r\nEvidently she was always going to understand; she was always going to\r\nsay the right thing.  The discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow,\r\nand he went on gaily:  "The worst of it is that I want to kiss you and\r\nI can\'t."  As he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory,\r\nassured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to him\r\nlaid a fugitive pressure on her lips.  To counteract the audacity of\r\nthis proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of\r\nthe conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke a\r\nlily-of-the-valley from her bouquet.  She sat silent, and the world lay\r\nlike a sunlit valley at their feet.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell my cousin Ellen?" she asked presently, as if she spoke\r\nthrough a dream.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so.  Some\r\ninvincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign\r\nwoman had checked the words on his lips.\r\n\r\n"No--I hadn\'t the chance after all," he said, fibbing hastily.\r\n\r\n"Ah."  She looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining her\r\npoint.  "You must, then, for I didn\'t either; and I shouldn\'t like her\r\nto think--"\r\n\r\n"Of course not.  But aren\'t you, after all, the person to do it?"\r\n\r\nShe pondered on this.  "If I\'d done it at the right time, yes: but now\r\nthat there\'s been a delay I think you must explain that I\'d asked you\r\nto tell her at the Opera, before our speaking about it to everybody\r\nhere.  Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her.  You see, she\'s\r\none of the family, and she\'s been away so long that she\'s\r\nrather--sensitive."\r\n\r\nArcher looked at her glowingly.  "Dear and great angel!  Of course I\'ll\r\ntell her."  He glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded\r\nball-room.  "But I haven\'t seen her yet.  Has she come?"\r\n\r\n"No; at the last minute she decided not to."\r\n\r\n"At the last minute?" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she should\r\never have considered the alternative possible.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  She\'s awfully fond of dancing," the young girl answered simply.\r\n"But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn\'t smart enough\r\nfor a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to take\r\nher home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--" said Archer with happy indifference.  Nothing about his\r\nbetrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to\r\nits utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the "unpleasant" in which they\r\nhad both been brought up.\r\n\r\n"She knows as well as I do," he reflected, "the real reason of her\r\ncousin\'s staying away; but I shall never let her see by the least sign\r\nthat I am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor Ellen\r\nOlenska\'s reputation."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits\r\nwere exchanged.  The New York ritual was precise and inflexible in such\r\nmatters; and in conformity with it Newland Archer first went with his\r\nmother and sister to call on Mrs. Welland, after which he and Mrs.\r\nWelland and May drove out to old Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s to receive that\r\nvenerable ancestress\'s blessing.\r\n\r\nA visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott was always an amusing episode to the\r\nyoung man.  The house in itself was already an historic document,\r\nthough not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family houses\r\nin University Place and lower Fifth Avenue.  Those were of the purest\r\n1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage-rose-garlanded carpets, rosewood\r\nconsoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, and\r\nimmense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old Mrs. Mingott, who\r\nhad built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture of\r\nher prime, and mingled with the Mingott heirlooms the frivolous\r\nupholstery of the Second Empire.  It was her habit to sit in a window\r\nof her sitting-room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for life\r\nand fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors.  She seemed in no\r\nhurry to have them come, for her patience was equalled by her\r\nconfidence.  She was sure that presently the hoardings, the quarries,\r\nthe one-story saloons, the wooden green-houses in ragged gardens, and\r\nthe rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before the\r\nadvance of residences as stately as her own--perhaps (for she was an\r\nimpartial woman) even statelier; and that the cobble-stones over which\r\nthe old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth\r\nasphalt, such as people reported having seen in Paris.  Meanwhile, as\r\nevery one she cared to see came to HER (and she could fill her rooms as\r\neasily as the Beauforts, and without adding a single item to the menu\r\nof her suppers), she did not suffer from her geographic isolation.\r\n\r\nThe immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle\r\nlife like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump\r\nactive little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something\r\nas vast and august as a natural phenomenon.  She had accepted this\r\nsubmergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in\r\nextreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost\r\nunwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of which\r\nthe traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation.  A\r\nflight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a\r\nstill-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a\r\nminiature portrait of the late Mr. Mingott; and around and below, wave\r\nafter wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious\r\narmchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of\r\nthe billows.\r\n\r\nThe burden of Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s flesh had long since made it\r\nimpossible for her to go up and down stairs, and with characteristic\r\nindependence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established\r\nherself (in flagrant violation of all the New York proprieties) on the\r\nground floor of her house; so that, as you sat in her sitting-room\r\nwindow with her, you caught (through a door that was always open, and a\r\nlooped-back yellow damask portiere) the unexpected vista of a bedroom\r\nwith a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa, and a toilet-table with\r\nfrivolous lace flounces and a gilt-framed mirror.\r\n\r\nHer visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this\r\narrangement, which recalled scenes in French fiction, and architectural\r\nincentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed\r\nof.  That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies,\r\nin apartments with all the rooms on one floor, and all the indecent\r\npropinquities that their novels described.  It amused Newland Archer\r\n(who had secretly situated the love-scenes of "Monsieur de Camors" in\r\nMrs. Mingott\'s bedroom) to picture her blameless life led in the\r\nstage-setting of adultery; but he said to himself, with considerable\r\nadmiration, that if a lover had been what she wanted, the intrepid\r\nwoman would have had him too.\r\n\r\nTo the general relief the Countess Olenska was not present in her\r\ngrandmother\'s drawing-room during the visit of the betrothed couple.\r\nMrs. Mingott said she had gone out; which, on a day of such glaring\r\nsunlight, and at the "shopping hour," seemed in itself an indelicate\r\nthing for a compromised woman to do.  But at any rate it spared them\r\nthe embarrassment of her presence, and the faint shadow that her\r\nunhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future.  The visit\r\nwent off successfully, as was to have been expected.  Old Mrs. Mingott\r\nwas delighted with the engagement, which, being long foreseen by\r\nwatchful relatives, had been carefully passed upon in family council;\r\nand the engagement ring, a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws,\r\nmet with her unqualified admiration.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the new setting: of course it shows the stone beautifully, but it\r\nlooks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes," Mrs. Welland had explained,\r\nwith a conciliatory side-glance at her future son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Old-fashioned eyes?  I hope you don\'t mean mine, my dear?  I like all\r\nthe novelties," said the ancestress, lifting the stone to her small\r\nbright orbs, which no glasses had ever disfigured.  "Very handsome,"\r\nshe added, returning the jewel; "very liberal.  In my time a cameo set\r\nin pearls was thought sufficient.  But it\'s the hand that sets off the\r\nring, isn\'t it, my dear Mr. Archer?" and she waved one of her tiny\r\nhands, with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the\r\nwrist like ivory bracelets.  "Mine was modelled in Rome by the great\r\nFerrigiani.  You should have May\'s done: no doubt he\'ll have it done,\r\nmy child.  Her hand is large--it\'s these modern sports that spread the\r\njoints--but the skin is white.--And when\'s the wedding to be?" she\r\nbroke off, fixing her eyes on Archer\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh--" Mrs. Welland murmured, while the young man, smiling at his\r\nbetrothed, replied:  "As soon as ever it can, if only you\'ll back me\r\nup, Mrs. Mingott."\r\n\r\n"We must give them time to get to know each other a little better,\r\nmamma," Mrs. Welland interposed, with the proper affectation of\r\nreluctance; to which the ancestress rejoined:  "Know each other?\r\nFiddlesticks!  Everybody in New York has always known everybody.  Let\r\nthe young man have his way, my dear; don\'t wait till the bubble\'s off\r\nthe wine.  Marry them before Lent; I may catch pneumonia any winter\r\nnow, and I want to give the wedding-breakfast."\r\n\r\nThese successive statements were received with the proper expressions\r\nof amusement, incredulity and gratitude; and the visit was breaking up\r\nin a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the Countess\r\nOlenska, who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected\r\nfigure of Julius Beaufort.\r\n\r\nThere was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies, and Mrs.\r\nMingott held out Ferrigiani\'s model to the banker.  "Ha!  Beaufort,\r\nthis is a rare favour!" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing men\r\nby their surnames.)\r\n\r\n"Thanks.  I wish it might happen oftener," said the visitor in his easy\r\narrogant way.  "I\'m generally so tied down; but I met the Countess\r\nEllen in Madison Square, and she was good enough to let me walk home\r\nwith her."\r\n\r\n"Ah--I hope the house will be gayer, now that Ellen\'s here!" cried Mrs.\r\nMingott with a glorious effrontery.  "Sit down--sit down, Beaufort:\r\npush up the yellow armchair; now I\'ve got you I want a good gossip.  I\r\nhear your ball was magnificent; and I understand you invited Mrs.\r\nLemuel Struthers?  Well--I\'ve a curiosity to see the woman myself."\r\n\r\nShe had forgotten her relatives, who were drifting out into the hall\r\nunder Ellen Olenska\'s guidance.  Old Mrs. Mingott had always professed\r\na great admiration for Julius Beaufort, and there was a kind of kinship\r\nin their cool domineering way and their short-cuts through the\r\nconventions.  Now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the\r\nBeauforts to invite (for the first time) Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, the\r\nwidow of Struthers\'s Shoe-polish, who had returned the previous year\r\nfrom a long initiatory sojourn in Europe to lay siege to the tight\r\nlittle citadel of New York.  "Of course if you and Regina invite her\r\nthe thing is settled.  Well, we need new blood and new money--and I\r\nhear she\'s still very good-looking," the carnivorous old lady declared.\r\n\r\nIn the hall, while Mrs. Welland and May drew on their furs, Archer saw\r\nthat the Countess Olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know already--about May and me," he said, answering her\r\nlook with a shy laugh.  "She scolded me for not giving you the news\r\nlast night at the Opera: I had her orders to tell you that we were\r\nengaged--but I couldn\'t, in that crowd."\r\n\r\nThe smile passed from Countess Olenska\'s eyes to her lips: she looked\r\nyounger, more like the bold brown Ellen Mingott of his boyhood.  "Of\r\ncourse I know; yes.  And I\'m so glad.  But one doesn\'t tell such things\r\nfirst in a crowd."  The ladies were on the threshold and she held out\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye; come and see me some day," she said, still looking at Archer.\r\n\r\nIn the carriage, on the way down Fifth Avenue, they talked pointedly of\r\nMrs. Mingott, of her age, her spirit, and all her wonderful attributes.\r\nNo one alluded to Ellen Olenska; but Archer knew that Mrs. Welland was\r\nthinking:  "It\'s a mistake for Ellen to be seen, the very day after her\r\narrival, parading up Fifth Avenue at the crowded hour with Julius\r\nBeaufort--" and the young man himself mentally added:  "And she ought\r\nto know that a man who\'s just engaged doesn\'t spend his time calling on\r\nmarried women.  But I daresay in the set she\'s lived in they do--they\r\nnever do anything else." And, in spite of the cosmopolitan views on\r\nwhich he prided himself, he thanked heaven that he was a New Yorker,\r\nand about to ally himself with one of his own kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe next evening old Mr. Sillerton Jackson came to dine with the\r\nArchers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to\r\nbe well-informed as to its doings.  Her old friend Mr. Sillerton\r\nJackson applied to the investigation of his friends\' affairs the\r\npatience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his\r\nsister, Miss Sophy Jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained by\r\nall the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother,\r\nbrought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in\r\nhis picture.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whenever anything happened that Mrs. Archer wanted to know\r\nabout, she asked Mr. Jackson to dine; and as she honoured few people\r\nwith her invitations, and as she and her daughter Janey were an\r\nexcellent audience, Mr. Jackson usually came himself instead of sending\r\nhis sister.  If he could have dictated all the conditions, he would\r\nhave chosen the evenings when Newland was out; not because the young\r\nman was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) but\r\nbecause the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on Newland\'s part, a\r\ntendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would also\r\nhave asked that Mrs. Archer\'s food should be a little better.  But then\r\nNew York, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been divided\r\ninto the two great fundamental groups of the Mingotts and Mansons and\r\nall their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and the\r\nArcher-Newland-van-der-Luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel,\r\nhorticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser forms\r\nof pleasure.\r\n\r\nYou couldn\'t have everything, after all.  If you dined with the Lovell\r\nMingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at Adeline\r\nArcher\'s you could talk about Alpine scenery and "The Marble Faun"; and\r\nluckily the Archer Madeira had gone round the Cape.  Therefore when a\r\nfriendly summons came from Mrs. Archer, Mr. Jackson, who was a true\r\neclectic, would usually say to his sister:  "I\'ve been a little gouty\r\nsince my last dinner at the Lovell Mingotts\'--it will do me good to\r\ndiet at Adeline\'s."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughter\r\nin West Twenty-eighth Street.  An upper floor was dedicated to Newland,\r\nand the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below.  In\r\nan unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in\r\nWardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen,\r\ncollected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to "Good\r\nWords," and read Ouida\'s novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere.\r\n(They preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptions\r\nof scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they liked\r\nnovels about people in society, whose motives and habits were more\r\ncomprehensible, spoke severely of Dickens, who "had never drawn a\r\ngentleman," and considered Thackeray less at home in the great world\r\nthan Bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.)\r\nMrs. and Miss Archer were both great lovers of scenery.  It was what\r\nthey principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad;\r\nconsidering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chiefly\r\nfor learned persons who read Ruskin.  Mrs. Archer had been born a\r\nNewland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, were\r\nboth, as people said, "true Newlands"; tall, pale, and slightly\r\nround-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of drooping\r\ndistinction like that in certain faded Reynolds portraits.  Their\r\nphysical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint\r\nhad not stretched Mrs. Archer\'s black brocade, while Miss Archer\'s\r\nbrown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and more\r\nslackly on her virgin frame.\r\n\r\nMentally, the likeness between them, as Newland was aware, was less\r\ncomplete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear.  The\r\nlong habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given\r\nthem the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases\r\n"Mother thinks" or "Janey thinks," according as one or the other wished\r\nto advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while Mrs. Archer\'s\r\nserene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar,\r\nJaney was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from\r\nsprings of suppressed romance.\r\n\r\nMother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and\r\nbrother; and Archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and\r\nuncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by his\r\nsecret satisfaction in it.  After all, he thought it a good thing for a\r\nman to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his sense\r\nof humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the young man was very sure that Mr. Jackson would\r\nrather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\nOf course old Jackson wanted to talk about Ellen Olenska, and of course\r\nMrs. Archer and Janey wanted to hear what he had to tell.  All three\r\nwould be slightly embarrassed by Newland\'s presence, now that his\r\nprospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and the\r\nyoung man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey began, obliquely, by talking about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity the Beauforts asked her," Mrs. Archer said gently.  "But\r\nthen Regina always does what he tells her; and BEAUFORT--"\r\n\r\n"Certain nuances escape Beaufort," said Mr. Jackson, cautiously\r\ninspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time why\r\nMrs. Archer\'s cook always burnt the roe to a cinder. (Newland, who had\r\nlong shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man\'s\r\nexpression of melancholy disapproval.)\r\n\r\n"Oh, necessarily; Beaufort is a vulgar man," said Mrs. Archer.  "My\r\ngrandfather Newland always used to say to my mother:  \'Whatever you do,\r\ndon\'t let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.\'  But at\r\nleast he\'s had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in England\r\ntoo, they say.  It\'s all very mysterious--" She glanced at Janey and\r\npaused.  She and Janey knew every fold of the Beaufort mystery, but in\r\npublic Mrs. Archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for\r\nthe unmarried.\r\n\r\n"But this Mrs. Struthers," Mrs. Archer continued; "what did you say SHE\r\nwas, Sillerton?"\r\n\r\n"Out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit.\r\nThen with Living Wax-Works, touring New England.  After the police\r\nbroke THAT up, they say she lived--"  Mr. Jackson in his turn glanced\r\nat Janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids.\r\nThere were still hiatuses for her in Mrs. Struthers\'s past.\r\n\r\n"Then," Mr. Jackson continued (and Archer saw he was wondering why no\r\none had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife),\r\n"then Lemuel Struthers came along.  They say his advertiser used the\r\ngirl\'s head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair\'s intensely black,\r\nyou know--the Egyptian style.  Anyhow, he--eventually--married her."\r\nThere were volumes of innuendo in the way the "eventually" was spaced,\r\nand each syllable given its due stress.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--at the pass we\'ve come to nowadays, it doesn\'t matter," said\r\nMrs. Archer indifferently.  The ladies were not really interested in\r\nMrs. Struthers just then; the subject of Ellen Olenska was too fresh\r\nand too absorbing to them.  Indeed, Mrs. Struthers\'s name had been\r\nintroduced by Mrs. Archer only that she might presently be able to say:\r\n"And Newland\'s new cousin--Countess Olenska?  Was SHE at the ball too?"\r\n\r\nThere was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, and\r\nArcher knew it and had expected it.  Even Mrs. Archer, who was seldom\r\nunduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son\'s\r\nengagement. ("Especially after that silly business with Mrs.\r\nRushworth," as she had remarked to Janey, alluding to what had once\r\nseemed to Newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the\r\nscar.)\r\n\r\nThere was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the\r\nquestion from whatever point you chose.  Of course such a marriage was\r\nonly what Newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish and\r\nincalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it was\r\nnothing short of a miracle to see one\'s only son safe past the Siren\r\nIsle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity.\r\n\r\nAll this Mrs. Archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew also\r\nthat she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his\r\nengagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--because\r\non the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayed\r\nat home that evening.  "It\'s not that I don\'t approve of the Mingotts\'\r\nesprit de corps; but why Newland\'s engagement should be mixed up with\r\nthat Olenska woman\'s comings and goings I don\'t see," Mrs. Archer\r\ngrumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nShe had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she was\r\nunsurpassed--during the call on Mrs. Welland; but Newland knew (and his\r\nbetrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and Janey\r\nwere nervously on the watch for Madame Olenska\'s possible intrusion;\r\nand when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say\r\nto her son:  "I\'m thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone."\r\n\r\nThese indications of inward disturbance moved Archer the more that he\r\ntoo felt that the Mingotts had gone a little too far.  But, as it was\r\nagainst all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever\r\nallude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: "Oh,\r\nwell, there\'s always a phase of family parties to be gone through when\r\none gets engaged, and the sooner it\'s over the better."  At which his\r\nmother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from\r\nher grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes.\r\n\r\nHer revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to "draw" Mr.\r\nJackson that evening on the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly done\r\nhis duty as a future member of the Mingott clan, the young man had no\r\nobjection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that the\r\nsubject was already beginning to bore him.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the\r\nmournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, and\r\nhad rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff.  He\r\nlooked baffled and hungry, and Archer reflected that he would probably\r\nfinish his meal on Ellen Olenska.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelit\r\nArchers, Newlands and van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on the\r\ndark walls.\r\n\r\n"Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a good dinner, my dear Newland!"\r\nhe said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man in\r\na stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-house\r\nbehind him.  "Well--well--well ... I wonder what he would have said to\r\nall these foreign marriages!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and Mr.\r\nJackson continued with deliberation: "No, she was NOT at the ball."\r\n\r\n"Ah--" Mrs. Archer murmured, in a tone that implied:  "She had that\r\ndecency."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the Beauforts don\'t know her," Janey suggested, with her\r\nartless malice.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisible\r\nMadeira.  "Mrs. Beaufort may not--but Beaufort certainly does, for she\r\nwas seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the whole\r\nof New York."\r\n\r\n"Mercy--" moaned Mrs. Archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness of\r\ntrying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon," Janey\r\nspeculated.  "At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet,\r\nperfectly plain and flat--like a night-gown."\r\n\r\n"Janey!" said her mother; and Miss Archer blushed and tried to look\r\naudacious.\r\n\r\n"It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball," Mrs.\r\nArcher continued.\r\n\r\nA spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:  "I don\'t think it was\r\na question of taste with her.  May said she meant to go, and then\r\ndecided that the dress in question wasn\'t smart enough."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference.  "Poor\r\nEllen," she simply remarked; adding compassionately:  "We must always\r\nbear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Manson gave her.\r\nWhat can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at\r\nher coming-out ball?"\r\n\r\n"Ah--don\'t I remember her in it!" said Mr. Jackson; adding:  "Poor\r\ngirl!" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully\r\nunderstood at the time what the sight portended.\r\n\r\n"It\'s odd," Janey remarked, "that she should have kept such an ugly\r\nname as Ellen.  I should have changed it to Elaine."  She glanced about\r\nthe table to see the effect of this.\r\n\r\nHer brother laughed.  "Why Elaine?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; it sounds more--more Polish," said Janey, blushing.\r\n\r\n"It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Archer distantly.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative.  "Why\r\nshouldn\'t she be conspicuous if she chooses?  Why should she slink\r\nabout as if it were she who had disgraced herself?  She\'s \'poor Ellen\'\r\ncertainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;\r\nbut I don\'t see that that\'s a reason for hiding her head as if she were\r\nthe culprit."\r\n\r\n"That, I suppose," said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, "is the line the\r\nMingotts mean to take."\r\n\r\nThe young man reddened.  "I didn\'t have to wait for their cue, if\r\nthat\'s what you mean, sir.  Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life:\r\nthat doesn\'t make her an outcast."\r\n\r\n"There are rumours," began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know: the secretary," the young man took him up.  "Nonsense,\r\nmother; Janey\'s grown-up.  They say, don\'t they," he went on, "that the\r\nsecretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept\r\nher practically a prisoner?  Well, what if he did?  I hope there isn\'t\r\na man among us who wouldn\'t have done the same in such a case."\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler:\r\n"Perhaps ... that sauce ... just a little, after all--"; then, having\r\nhelped himself, he remarked: "I\'m told she\'s looking for a house.  She\r\nmeans to live here."\r\n\r\n"I hear she means to get a divorce," said Janey boldly.\r\n\r\n"I hope she will!" Archer exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil\r\natmosphere of the Archer dining-room.  Mrs. Archer raised her delicate\r\neye-brows in the particular curve that signified:  "The butler--" and\r\nthe young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such\r\nintimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of his\r\nvisit to old Mrs. Mingott.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, according to immemorial custom, Mrs. Archer and Janey\r\ntrailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, while\r\nthe gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a Carcel lamp with\r\nan engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table with\r\na green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry\r\nband of field-flowers destined to adorn an "occasional" chair in the\r\ndrawing-room of young Mrs. Newland Archer.\r\n\r\nWhile this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, Archer settled Mr.\r\nJackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handed\r\nhim a cigar.  Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit\r\nhis cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and\r\nstretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said:  "You say the\r\nsecretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow?  Well, he was\r\nstill helping her a year later, then; for somebody met \'em living at\r\nLausanne together."\r\n\r\nNewland reddened.  "Living together?  Well, why not?  Who had the right\r\nto make her life over if she hadn\'t?  I\'m sick of the hypocrisy that\r\nwould bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with\r\nharlots."\r\n\r\nHe stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar.  "Women ought to\r\nbe free--as free as we are," he declared, making a discovery of which\r\nhe was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.\r\n\r\nMr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted\r\na sardonic whistle.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said after a pause, "apparently Count Olenski takes your\r\nview; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife\r\nback."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies\r\nhad retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted\r\nthoughtfully to his own study.  A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the\r\nfire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows\r\nof books, its bronze and steel statuettes of "The Fencers" on the\r\nmantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked\r\nsingularly home-like and welcoming.\r\n\r\nAs he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a\r\nlarge photograph of May Welland, which the young girl had given him in\r\nthe first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all the\r\nother portraits on the table.  With a new sense of awe he looked at the\r\nfrank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young\r\ncreature whose soul\'s custodian he was to be.  That terrifying product\r\nof the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who\r\nknew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a\r\nstranger through May Welland\'s familiar features; and once more it was\r\nborne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been\r\ntaught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Countess Olenska had stirred up old settled convictions\r\nand set them drifting dangerously through his mind.  His own\r\nexclamation:  "Women should be free--as free as we are," struck to the\r\nroot of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as\r\nnon-existent.  "Nice" women, however wronged, would never claim the\r\nkind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were\r\ntherefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready to\r\nconcede it to them.  Such verbal generosities were in fact only a\r\nhumbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things\r\ntogether and bound people down to the old pattern.  But here he was\r\npledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed\'s cousin, conduct that,\r\non his own wife\'s part, would justify him in calling down on her all\r\nthe thunders of Church and State.  Of course the dilemma was purely\r\nhypothetical; since he wasn\'t a blackguard Polish nobleman, it was\r\nabsurd to speculate what his wife\'s rights would be if he WERE.  But\r\nNewland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and\r\nMay\'s, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable.\r\nWhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty,\r\nas a "decent" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a\r\nmarriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?  What if, for some one\r\nof the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they should\r\ntire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other?  He reviewed\r\nhis friends\' marriages--the supposedly happy ones--and saw none that\r\nanswered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which\r\nhe pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland.  He perceived\r\nthat such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the\r\nversatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully\r\ntrained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his\r\nmarriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a\r\ndull association of material and social interests held together by\r\nignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.  Lawrence\r\nLefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely\r\nrealised this enviable ideal.  As became the high-priest of form, he\r\nhad formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in the\r\nmost conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men\'s\r\nwives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that "Lawrence\r\nwas so frightfully strict"; and had been known to blush indignantly,\r\nand avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the fact\r\nthat Julius Beaufort (as became a "foreigner" of doubtful origin) had\r\nwhat was known in New York as "another establishment."\r\n\r\nArcher tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite\r\nsuch an ass as Larry Lefferts, nor May such a simpleton as poor\r\nGertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not\r\nof standards.  In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic\r\nworld, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but\r\nonly represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when Mrs. Welland, who\r\nknew exactly why Archer had pressed her to announce her daughter\'s\r\nengagement at the Beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do no\r\nless), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of having\r\nhad her hand forced, quite as, in the books on Primitive Man that\r\npeople of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride is\r\ndragged with shrieks from her parents\' tent.\r\n\r\nThe result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre of\r\nthis elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable\r\nfor her very frankness and assurance.  She was frank, poor darling,\r\nbecause she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothing\r\nto be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this,\r\nshe was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called "the\r\nfacts of life."\r\n\r\nThe young man was sincerely but placidly in love.  He delighted in the\r\nradiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship,\r\nher grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books and\r\nideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance.  (She had\r\nadvanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the Idyls of the King,\r\nbut not to feel the beauty of Ulysses and the Lotus Eaters.) She was\r\nstraightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chiefly\r\nproved by her laughing at HIS jokes); and he suspected, in the depths\r\nof her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joy\r\nto waken.  But when he had gone the brief round of her he returned\r\ndiscouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were\r\nonly an artificial product.  Untrained human nature was not frank and\r\ninnocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive\r\nguile.  And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious\r\npurity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts\r\nand grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to\r\nbe what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might\r\nexercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were those\r\nhabitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day.  But they\r\nwere generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasement\r\nof which Newland Archer felt no trace.  He could not deplore (as\r\nThackeray\'s heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not a\r\nblank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she\r\nwas to give to him.  He could not get away from the fact that if he had\r\nbeen brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find\r\ntheir way about than the Babes in the Wood; nor could he, for all his\r\nanxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnected\r\nwith his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity)\r\nwhy his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of\r\nexperience as himself.\r\n\r\nSuch questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind;\r\nbut he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision\r\nwere due to the inopportune arrival of the Countess Olenska.  Here he\r\nwas, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughts\r\nand cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised\r\nall the special problems he would have preferred to let lie.  "Hang\r\nEllen Olenska!" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began to\r\nundress.  He could not really see why her fate should have the least\r\nbearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to\r\nmeasure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later the bolt fell.\r\n\r\nThe Lovell Mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as "a formal\r\ndinner" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, and\r\na Roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with the\r\nwords "To meet the Countess Olenska," in accordance with the hospitable\r\nAmerican fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, or\r\nat least as their ambassadors.\r\n\r\nThe guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in\r\nwhich the initiated recognised the firm hand of Catherine the Great.\r\nAssociated with such immemorial standbys as the Selfridge Merrys, who\r\nwere asked everywhere because they always had been, the Beauforts, on\r\nwhom there was a claim of relationship, and Mr. Sillerton Jackson and\r\nhis sister Sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were some\r\nof the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant\r\n"young married" set; the Lawrence Leffertses, Mrs. Lefferts Rushworth\r\n(the lovely widow), the Harry Thorleys, the Reggie Chiverses and young\r\nMorris Dagonet and his wife (who was a van der Luyden).  The company\r\nindeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to the\r\nlittle inner group of people who, during the long New York season,\r\ndisported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently\r\nundiminished zest.\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one had\r\nrefused the Mingotts\' invitation except the Beauforts and old Mr.\r\nJackson and his sister.  The intended slight was emphasised by the fact\r\nthat even the Reggie Chiverses, who were of the Mingott clan, were\r\namong those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, in\r\nall of which the writers "regretted that they were unable to accept,"\r\nwithout the mitigating plea of a "previous engagement" that ordinary\r\ncourtesy prescribed.\r\n\r\nNew York society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant in\r\nits resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers,\r\nbutlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings people were\r\nfree; and it was thus possible for the recipients of Mrs. Lovell\r\nMingott\'s invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to\r\nmeet the Countess Olenska.\r\n\r\nThe blow was unexpected; but the Mingotts, as their way was, met it\r\ngallantly.  Mrs. Lovell Mingott confided the case to Mrs. Welland, who\r\nconfided it to Newland Archer; who, aflame at the outrage, appealed\r\npassionately and authoritatively to his mother; who, after a painful\r\nperiod of inward resistance and outward temporising, succumbed to his\r\ninstances (as she always did), and immediately embracing his cause with\r\nan energy redoubled by her previous hesitations, put on her grey velvet\r\nbonnet and said:  "I\'ll go and see Louisa van der Luyden."\r\n\r\nThe New York of Newland Archer\'s day was a small and slippery pyramid,\r\nin which, as yet, hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained.\r\nAt its base was a firm foundation of what Mrs. Archer called "plain\r\npeople"; an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who\r\n(as in the case of the Spicers or the Leffertses or the Jacksons) had\r\nbeen raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans.\r\nPeople, Mrs. Archer always said, were not as particular as they used to\r\nbe; and with old Catherine Spicer ruling one end of Fifth Avenue, and\r\nJulius Beaufort the other, you couldn\'t expect the old traditions to\r\nlast much longer.\r\n\r\nFirmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum\r\nwas the compact and dominant group which the Mingotts, Newlands,\r\nChiverses and Mansons so actively represented.  Most people imagined\r\nthem to be the very apex of the pyramid; but they themselves (at least\r\nthose of Mrs. Archer\'s generation) were aware that, in the eyes of the\r\nprofessional genealogist, only a still smaller number of families could\r\nlay claim to that eminence.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me," Mrs. Archer would say to her children, "all this\r\nmodern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy.  If there is\r\none, neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it; no, nor the\r\nNewlands or the Chiverses either.  Our grandfathers and\r\ngreat-grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants,\r\nwho came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because\r\nthey did so well.  One of your great-grandfathers signed the\r\nDeclaration, and another was a general on Washington\'s staff, and\r\nreceived General Burgoyne\'s sword after the battle of Saratoga.  These\r\nare things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or\r\nclass.  New York has always been a commercial community, and there are\r\nnot more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin\r\nin the real sense of the word."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer and her son and daughter, like every one else in New York,\r\nknew who these privileged beings were: the Dagonets of Washington\r\nSquare, who came of an old English county family allied with the Pitts\r\nand Foxes; the Lannings, who had intermarried with the descendants of\r\nCount de Grasse, and the van der Luydens, direct descendants of the\r\nfirst Dutch governor of Manhattan, and related by pre-revolutionary\r\nmarriages to several members of the French and British aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe Lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively\r\nMiss Lannings, who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family\r\nportraits and Chippendale; the Dagonets were a considerable clan,\r\nallied to the best names in Baltimore and Philadelphia; but the van der\r\nLuydens, who stood above all of them, had faded into a kind of\r\nsuper-terrestrial twilight, from which only two figures impressively\r\nemerged; those of Mr. and Mrs. Henry van der Luyden.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry van der Luyden had been Louisa Dagonet, and her mother had\r\nbeen the granddaughter of Colonel du Lac, of an old Channel Island\r\nfamily, who had fought under Cornwallis and had settled in Maryland,\r\nafter the war, with his bride, Lady Angelica Trevenna, fifth daughter\r\nof the Earl of St. Austrey.  The tie between the Dagonets, the du Lacs\r\nof Maryland, and their aristocratic Cornish kinsfolk, the Trevennas,\r\nhad always remained close and cordial.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had\r\nmore than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of\r\nTrevenna, the Duke of St.  Austrey, at his country-seat in Cornwall and\r\nat St.  Austrey in Gloucestershire; and his Grace had frequently\r\nannounced his intention of some day returning their visit (without the\r\nDuchess, who feared the Atlantic).\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden divided their time between Trevenna, their\r\nplace in Maryland, and Skuytercliff, the great estate on the Hudson\r\nwhich had been one of the colonial grants of the Dutch government to\r\nthe famous first Governor, and of which Mr. van der Luyden was still\r\n"Patroon."  Their large solemn house in Madison Avenue was seldom\r\nopened, and when they came to town they received in it only their most\r\nintimate friends.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would go with me, Newland," his mother said, suddenly\r\npausing at the door of the Brown coupe.  "Louisa is fond of you; and of\r\ncourse it\'s on account of dear May that I\'m taking this step--and also\r\nbecause, if we don\'t all stand together, there\'ll be no such thing as\r\nSociety left."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry van der Luyden listened in silence to her cousin Mrs.\r\nArcher\'s narrative.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to tell yourself in advance that Mrs. van der\r\nLuyden was always silent, and that, though non-committal by nature and\r\ntraining, she was very kind to the people she really liked.  Even\r\npersonal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the\r\nchill that descended on one in the high-ceilinged white-walled Madison\r\nAvenue drawing-room, with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously\r\nuncovered for the occasion, and the gauze still veiling the ormolu\r\nmantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of Gainsborough\'s\r\n"Lady Angelica du Lac."\r\n\r\nMrs. van der Luyden\'s portrait by Huntington (in black velvet and\r\nVenetian point) faced that of her lovely ancestress.  It was generally\r\nconsidered "as fine as a Cabanel," and, though twenty years had elapsed\r\nsince its execution, was still "a perfect likeness." Indeed the Mrs.\r\nvan der Luyden who sat beneath it listening to Mrs. Archer might have\r\nbeen the twin-sister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping\r\nagainst a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain.  Mrs. van der\r\nLuyden still wore black velvet and Venetian point when she went into\r\nsociety--or rather (since she never dined out) when she threw open her\r\nown doors to receive it.  Her fair hair, which had faded without\r\nturning grey, was still parted in flat overlapping points on her\r\nforehead, and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was\r\nonly a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait\r\nhad been painted.  She always, indeed, struck Newland Archer as having\r\nbeen rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a\r\nperfectly irreproachable existence, as bodies caught in glaciers keep\r\nfor years a rosy life-in-death.\r\n\r\nLike all his family, he esteemed and admired Mrs. van der Luyden; but\r\nhe found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the\r\ngrimness of some of his mother\'s old aunts, fierce spinsters who said\r\n"No" on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. van der Luyden\'s attitude said neither yes nor no, but always\r\nappeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips, wavering into the\r\nshadow of a smile, made the almost invariable reply:  "I shall first\r\nhave to talk this over with my husband."\r\n\r\nShe and Mr. van der Luyden were so exactly alike that Archer often\r\nwondered how, after forty years of the closest conjugality, two such\r\nmerged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as\r\ncontroversial as a talking-over.  But as neither had ever reached a\r\ndecision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave, Mrs. Archer\r\nand her son, having set forth their case, waited resignedly for the\r\nfamiliar phrase.\r\n\r\nMrs. van der Luyden, however, who had seldom surprised any one, now\r\nsurprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bell-rope.\r\n\r\n"I think," she said, "I should like Henry to hear what you have told\r\nme."\r\n\r\nA footman appeared, to whom she gravely added: "If Mr. van der Luyden\r\nhas finished reading the newspaper, please ask him to be kind enough to\r\ncome."\r\n\r\nShe said "reading the newspaper" in the tone in which a Minister\'s wife\r\nmight have said:  "Presiding at a Cabinet meeting"--not from any\r\narrogance of mind, but because the habit of a life-time, and the\r\nattitude of her friends and relations, had led her to consider Mr. van\r\nder Luyden\'s least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance.\r\n\r\nHer promptness of action showed that she considered the case as\r\npressing as Mrs. Archer; but, lest she should be thought to have\r\ncommitted herself in advance, she added, with the sweetest look:\r\n"Henry always enjoys seeing you, dear Adeline; and he will wish to\r\ncongratulate Newland."\r\n\r\nThe double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared Mr.\r\nHenry van der Luyden, tall, spare and frock-coated, with faded fair\r\nhair, a straight nose like his wife\'s and the same look of frozen\r\ngentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue.\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden greeted Mrs. Archer with cousinly affability,\r\nproffered to Newland low-voiced congratulations couched in the same\r\nlanguage as his wife\'s, and seated himself in one of the brocade\r\narmchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign.\r\n\r\n"I had just finished reading the Times," he said, laying his long\r\nfinger-tips together.  "In town my mornings are so much occupied that I\r\nfind it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon."\r\n\r\n"Ah, there\'s a great deal to be said for that plan--indeed I think my\r\nuncle Egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the\r\nmorning papers till after dinner," said Mrs. Archer responsively.\r\n\r\n"Yes: my good father abhorred hurry.  But now we live in a constant\r\nrush," said Mr. van der Luyden in measured tones, looking with pleasant\r\ndeliberation about the large shrouded room which to Archer was so\r\ncomplete an image of its owners.\r\n\r\n"But I hope you HAD finished your reading, Henry?" his wife interposed.\r\n\r\n"Quite--quite," he reassured her.\r\n\r\n"Then I should like Adeline to tell you--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s really Newland\'s story," said his mother smiling; and\r\nproceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront\r\ninflicted on Mrs. Lovell Mingott.\r\n\r\n"Of course," she ended, "Augusta Welland and Mary Mingott both felt\r\nthat, especially in view of Newland\'s engagement, you and Henry OUGHT\r\nTO KNOW."\r\n\r\n"Ah--" said Mr. van der Luyden, drawing a deep breath.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu\r\nclock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a\r\nminute-gun.  Archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded\r\nfigures, seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity,\r\nmouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled\r\nthem to wield, when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity\r\nand seclusion, digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of\r\nSkuytercliff, and playing Patience together in the evenings.\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"You really think this is due to some--some intentional interference of\r\nLawrence Lefferts\'s?" he enquired, turning to Archer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m certain of it, sir.  Larry has been going it rather harder than\r\nusual lately--if cousin Louisa won\'t mind my mentioning it--having\r\nrather a stiff affair with the postmaster\'s wife in their village, or\r\nsome one of that sort; and whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins to\r\nsuspect anything, and he\'s afraid of trouble, he gets up a fuss of this\r\nkind, to show how awfully moral he is, and talks at the top of his\r\nvoice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he\r\ndoesn\'t wish her to know.  He\'s simply using Madame Olenska as a\r\nlightning-rod; I\'ve seen him try the same thing often before."\r\n\r\n"The LEFFERTSES!--" said Mrs. van der Luyden.\r\n\r\n"The LEFFERTSES!--" echoed Mrs. Archer.  "What would uncle Egmont have\r\nsaid of Lawrence Lefferts\'s pronouncing on anybody\'s social position?\r\nIt shows what Society has come to."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll hope it has not quite come to that," said Mr. van der Luyden\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, if only you and Louisa went out more!" sighed Mrs. Archer.\r\n\r\nBut instantly she became aware of her mistake.  The van der Luydens\r\nwere morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence.\r\nThey were the arbiters of fashion, the Court of last Appeal, and they\r\nknew it, and bowed to their fate.  But being shy and retiring persons,\r\nwith no natural inclination for their part, they lived as much as\r\npossible in the sylvan solitude of Skuytercliff, and when they came to\r\ntown, declined all invitations on the plea of Mrs. van der Luyden\'s\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer came to his mother\'s rescue.  "Everybody in New York\r\nknows what you and cousin Louisa represent.  That\'s why Mrs. Mingott\r\nfelt she ought not to allow this slight on Countess Olenska to pass\r\nwithout consulting you."\r\n\r\nMrs. van der Luyden glanced at her husband, who glanced back at her.\r\n\r\n"It is the principle that I dislike," said Mr. van der Luyden.  "As\r\nlong as a member of a well-known family is backed up by that family it\r\nshould be considered--final."\r\n\r\n"It seems so to me," said his wife, as if she were producing a new\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"I had no idea," Mr. van der Luyden continued, "that things had come to\r\nsuch a pass."  He paused, and looked at his wife again.  "It occurs to\r\nme, my dear, that the Countess Olenska is already a sort of\r\nrelation--through Medora Manson\'s first husband.  At any rate, she will\r\nbe when Newland marries."  He turned toward the young man.  "Have you\r\nread this morning\'s Times, Newland?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, sir," said Archer, who usually tossed off half a dozen\r\npapers with his morning coffee.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife looked at each other again.  Their pale eyes clung\r\ntogether in prolonged and serious consultation; then a faint smile\r\nfluttered over Mrs. van der Luyden\'s face.  She had evidently guessed\r\nand approved.\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden turned to Mrs. Archer.  "If Louisa\'s health allowed\r\nher to dine out--I wish you would say to Mrs. Lovell Mingott--she and I\r\nwould have been happy to--er--fill the places of the Lawrence\r\nLeffertses at her dinner."  He paused to let the irony of this sink in.\r\n"As you know, this is impossible."  Mrs. Archer sounded a sympathetic\r\nassent.  "But Newland tells me he has read this morning\'s Times;\r\ntherefore he has probably seen that Louisa\'s relative, the Duke of St.\r\nAustrey, arrives next week on the Russia.  He is coming to enter his\r\nnew sloop, the Guinevere, in next summer\'s International Cup Race; and\r\nalso to have a little canvasback shooting at Trevenna."  Mr. van der\r\nLuyden paused again, and continued with increasing benevolence:\r\n"Before taking him down to Maryland we are inviting a few friends to\r\nmeet him here--only a little dinner--with a reception afterward.  I am\r\nsure Louisa will be as glad as I am if Countess Olenska will let us\r\ninclude her among our guests."  He got up, bent his long body with a\r\nstiff friendliness toward his cousin, and added:  "I think I have\r\nLouisa\'s authority for saying that she will herself leave the\r\ninvitation to dine when she drives out presently: with our cards--of\r\ncourse with our cards."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer, who knew this to be a hint that the seventeen-hand\r\nchestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door, rose with a\r\nhurried murmur of thanks.  Mrs. van der Luyden beamed on her with the\r\nsmile of Esther interceding with Ahasuerus; but her husband raised a\r\nprotesting hand.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to thank me for, dear Adeline; nothing whatever.\r\nThis kind of thing must not happen in New York; it shall not, as long\r\nas I can help it," he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he\r\nsteered his cousins to the door.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, every one knew that the great C-spring barouche in\r\nwhich Mrs. van der Luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at\r\nold Mrs. Mingott\'s door, where a large square envelope was handed in;\r\nand that evening at the Opera Mr. Sillerton Jackson was able to state\r\nthat the envelope contained a card inviting the Countess Olenska to the\r\ndinner which the van der Luydens were giving the following week for\r\ntheir cousin, the Duke of St. Austrey.\r\n\r\nSome of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this\r\nannouncement, and glanced sideways at Lawrence Lefferts, who sat\r\ncarelessly in the front of the box, pulling his long fair moustache,\r\nand who remarked with authority, as the soprano paused:  "No one but\r\nPatti ought to attempt the Sonnambula."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIt was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had "lost\r\nher looks."\r\n\r\nShe had appeared there first, in Newland Archer\'s boyhood, as a\r\nbrilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that\r\nshe "ought to be painted." Her parents had been continental wanderers,\r\nand after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and been taken in\r\ncharge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself\r\nreturning to New York to "settle down."\r\n\r\nPoor Medora, repeatedly widowed, was always coming home to settle down\r\n(each time in a less expensive house), and bringing with her a new\r\nhusband or an adopted child; but after a few months she invariably\r\nparted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward, and, having got\r\nrid of her house at a loss, set out again on her wanderings.  As her\r\nmother had been a Rushworth, and her last unhappy marriage had linked\r\nher to one of the crazy Chiverses, New York looked indulgently on her\r\neccentricities; but when she returned with her little orphaned niece,\r\nwhose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for\r\ntravel, people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in\r\nsuch hands.\r\n\r\nEvery one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her\r\ndusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed\r\nunsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her\r\nparents.  It was one of the misguided Medora\'s many peculiarities to\r\nflout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when\r\nshe stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that\r\nthe crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter\r\nthan those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was in crimson\r\nmerino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.\r\n\r\nBut New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old\r\nladies shook their heads over Ellen\'s gaudy clothes, while her other\r\nrelations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits.\r\nShe was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked disconcerting\r\nquestions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts,\r\nsuch as dancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs\r\nto a guitar.  Under the direction of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs.\r\nThorley Chivers, but who, having received a Papal title, had resumed\r\nher first husband\'s patronymic, and called herself the Marchioness\r\nManson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little\r\ngirl received an expensive but incoherent education, which included\r\n"drawing from the model," a thing never dreamed of before, and playing\r\nthe piano in quintets with professional musicians.\r\n\r\nOf course no good could come of this; and when, a few years later, poor\r\nChivers finally died in a madhouse, his widow (draped in strange weeds)\r\nagain pulled up stakes and departed with Ellen, who had grown into a\r\ntall bony girl with conspicuous eyes.  For some time no more was heard\r\nof them; then news came of Ellen\'s marriage to an immensely rich Polish\r\nnobleman of legendary fame, whom she had met at a ball at the\r\nTuileries, and who was said to have princely establishments in Paris,\r\nNice and Florence, a yacht at Cowes, and many square miles of shooting\r\nin Transylvania.  She disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis,\r\nand when a few years later Medora again came back to New York, subdued,\r\nimpoverished, mourning a third husband, and in quest of a still smaller\r\nhouse, people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do\r\nsomething for her.  Then came the news that Ellen\'s own marriage had\r\nended in disaster, and that she was herself returning home to seek rest\r\nand oblivion among her kinsfolk.\r\n\r\nThese things passed through Newland Archer\'s mind a week later as he\r\nwatched the Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on\r\nthe evening of the momentous dinner.  The occasion was a solemn one,\r\nand he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off.  She\r\ncame rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a bracelet\r\nabout her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or\r\nembarrassment the drawing-room in which New York\'s most chosen company\r\nwas somewhat awfully assembled.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave\r\nmouth and smiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the\r\ngeneral verdict on her looks.  It was true that her early radiance was\r\ngone.  The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn, a little\r\nolder-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty.  But\r\nthere was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in\r\nthe carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, which, without\r\nbeing in the least theatrical, struck his as highly trained and full of\r\na conscious power.  At the same time she was simpler in manner than\r\nmost of the ladies present, and many people (as he heard afterward from\r\nJaney) were disappointed that her appearance was not more\r\n"stylish"--for stylishness was what New York most valued.  It was,\r\nperhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared;\r\nbecause she was so quiet--quiet in her movements, her voice, and the\r\ntones of her low-pitched voice.  New York had expected something a good\r\ndeal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was a somewhat formidable business.  Dining with the van der\r\nLuydens was at best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who\r\nwas their cousin was almost a religious solemnity.  It pleased Archer\r\nto think that only an old New Yorker could perceive the shade of\r\ndifference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van\r\nder Luydens\' Duke.  New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even\r\n(except in the Struthers set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but\r\nwhen they presented such credentials as these they were received with\r\nan old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken\r\nin ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett.  It was for just such\r\ndistinctions that the young man cherished his old New York even while\r\nhe smiled at it.\r\n\r\nThe van der Luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of\r\nthe occasion.  The du Lac Sevres and the Trevenna George II plate were\r\nout; so was the van der Luyden "Lowestoft" (East India Company) and the\r\nDagonet Crown Derby.  Mrs. van der Luyden looked more than ever like a\r\nCabanel, and Mrs. Archer, in her grandmother\'s seed-pearls and\r\nemeralds, reminded her son of an Isabey miniature.  All the ladies had\r\non their handsomest jewels, but it was characteristic of the house and\r\nthe occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy old-fashioned\r\nsettings; and old Miss Lanning, who had been persuaded to come,\r\nactually wore her mother\'s cameos and a Spanish blonde shawl.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as\r\nArcher scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond\r\nnecklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously\r\nimmature compared with hers.  It frightened him to think what must have\r\ngone to the making of her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess\'s right, was naturally\r\nthe chief figure of the evening.  But if the Countess Olenska was less\r\nconspicuous than had been hoped, the Duke was almost invisible.  Being\r\na well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal visitor) come to\r\nthe dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby\r\nand baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun,\r\nthat (with his stooping way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading\r\nover his shirt-front) he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner\r\nattire.  He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with a thick nose,\r\nsmall eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did\r\nit was in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of\r\nexpectation about the table, his remarks were lost to all but his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up\r\nto the Countess Olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into\r\nanimated talk.  Neither seemed aware that the Duke should first have\r\npaid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Headly Chivers, and\r\nthe Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac, Mr. Urban\r\nDagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of\r\nmeeting her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out\r\nbetween January and April.  The two chatted together for nearly twenty\r\nminutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone across the wide\r\ndrawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer\'s side.\r\n\r\nIt was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up\r\nand walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of\r\nanother.  Etiquette required that she should wait, immovable as an\r\nidol, while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each\r\nother at her side.  But the Countess was apparently unaware of having\r\nbroken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside\r\nArcher, and looked at him with the kindest eyes.\r\n\r\n"I want you to talk to me about May," she said.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering her he asked:  "You knew the Duke before?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--we used to see him every winter at Nice.  He\'s very fond of\r\ngambling--he used to come to the house a great deal."  She said it in\r\nthe simplest manner, as if she had said:  "He\'s fond of wild-flowers";\r\nand after a moment she added candidly:  "I think he\'s the dullest man I\r\never met."\r\n\r\nThis pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her\r\nprevious remark had caused him.  It was undeniably exciting to meet a\r\nlady who found the van der Luydens\' Duke dull, and dared to utter the\r\nopinion.  He longed to question her, to hear more about the life of\r\nwhich her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse; but\r\nhe feared to touch on distressing memories, and before he could think\r\nof anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject.\r\n\r\n"May is a darling; I\'ve seen no young girl in New York so handsome and\r\nso intelligent.  Are you very much in love with her?"\r\n\r\nNewland Archer reddened and laughed.  "As much as a man can be."\r\n\r\nShe continued to consider him thoughtfully, as if not to miss any shade\r\nof meaning in what he said, "Do you think, then, there is a limit?"\r\n\r\n"To being in love?  If there is, I haven\'t found it!"\r\n\r\nShe glowed with sympathy.  "Ah--it\'s really and truly a romance?"\r\n\r\n"The most romantic of romances!"\r\n\r\n"How delightful!  And you found it all out for yourselves--it was not\r\nin the least arranged for you?"\r\n\r\nArcher looked at her incredulously.  "Have you forgotten," he asked\r\nwith a smile, "that in our country we don\'t allow our marriages to be\r\narranged for us?"\r\n\r\nA dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered, "I\'d forgotten.  You must forgive me if I\r\nsometimes make these mistakes.  I don\'t always remember that everything\r\nhere is good that was--that was bad where I\'ve come from."  She looked\r\ndown at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry," he said impulsively; "but you ARE among friends here,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Yes--I know.  Wherever I go I have that feeling.  That\'s why I came\r\nhome.  I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American\r\nagain, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful\r\nmother, and all the other good people here tonight.  Ah, here\'s May\r\narriving, and you will want to hurry away to her," she added, but\r\nwithout moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the\r\nyoung man\'s face.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests,\r\nand following Madame Olenska\'s glance Archer saw May Welland entering\r\nwith her mother.  In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of\r\nsilver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just\r\nalight from the chase.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Archer, "I have so many rivals; you see she\'s already\r\nsurrounded.  There\'s the Duke being introduced."\r\n\r\n"Then stay with me a little longer," Madame Olenska said in a low tone,\r\njust touching his knee with her plumed fan.  It was the lightest touch,\r\nbut it thrilled him like a caress.\r\n\r\n"Yes, let me stay," he answered in the same tone, hardly knowing what\r\nhe said; but just then Mr. van der Luyden came up, followed by old Mr.\r\nUrban Dagonet.  The Countess greeted them with her grave smile, and\r\nArcher, feeling his host\'s admonitory glance on him, rose and\r\nsurrendered his seat.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow, then, after five--I shall expect you," she said; and then\r\nturned back to make room for Mr. Dagonet.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow--" Archer heard himself repeating, though there had been no\r\nengagement, and during their talk she had given him no hint that she\r\nwished to see him again.\r\n\r\nAs he moved away he saw Lawrence Lefferts, tall and resplendent,\r\nleading his wife up to be introduced; and heard Gertrude Lefferts say,\r\nas she beamed on the Countess with her large unperceiving smile:  "But\r\nI think we used to go to dancing-school together when we were\r\nchildren--."  Behind her, waiting their turn to name themselves to the\r\nCountess, Archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had\r\ndeclined to meet her at Mrs. Lovell Mingott\'s.  As Mrs. Archer\r\nremarked: when the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a\r\nlesson.  The wonder was that they chose so seldom.\r\n\r\nThe young man felt a touch on his arm and saw Mrs. van der Luyden\r\nlooking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the\r\nfamily diamonds.  "It was good of you, dear Newland, to devote yourself\r\nso unselfishly to Madame Olenska.  I told your cousin Henry he must\r\nreally come to the rescue."\r\n\r\nHe was aware of smiling at her vaguely, and she added, as if\r\ncondescending to his natural shyness:  "I\'ve never seen May looking\r\nlovelier.  The Duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Olenska had said "after five"; and at half after the hour\r\nNewland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant\r\nwisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired,\r\nfar down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in.  Small\r\ndress-makers, bird-stuffers and "people who wrote" were her nearest\r\nneighbours; and further down the dishevelled street Archer recognised a\r\ndilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer\r\nand journalist called Winsett, whom he used to come across now and\r\nthen, had mentioned that he lived.  Winsett did not invite people to\r\nhis house; but he had once pointed it out to Archer in the course of a\r\nnocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little\r\nshiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska\'s own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance\r\nonly by a little more paint about the window-frames; and as Archer\r\nmustered its modest front he said to himself that the Polish Count must\r\nhave robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions.\r\n\r\nThe young man had spent an unsatisfactory day.  He had lunched with the\r\nWellands, hoping afterward to carry off May for a walk in the Park.  He\r\nwanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had\r\nlooked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her\r\nto hasten their marriage.  But Mrs. Welland had firmly reminded him\r\nthat the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted\r\nat advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows\r\nand sighed out:  "Twelve dozen of everything--hand-embroidered--"\r\n\r\nPacked in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to\r\nanother, and Archer, when the afternoon\'s round was over, parted from\r\nhis betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild\r\nanimal cunningly trapped.  He supposed that his readings in\r\nanthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after\r\nall a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling; but when he\r\nremembered that the Wellands did not expect the wedding to take place\r\ntill the following autumn, and pictured what his life would be till\r\nthen, a dampness fell upon his spirit.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow," Mrs. Welland called after him, "we\'ll do the Chiverses and\r\nthe Dallases"; and he perceived that she was going through their two\r\nfamilies alphabetically, and that they were only in the first quarter\r\nof the alphabet.\r\n\r\nHe had meant to tell May of the Countess Olenska\'s request--her\r\ncommand, rather--that he should call on her that afternoon; but in the\r\nbrief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to\r\nsay.  Besides, it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the\r\nmatter.  He knew that May most particularly wanted him to be kind to\r\nher cousin; was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of\r\ntheir engagement?  It gave him an odd sensation to reflect that, but\r\nfor the Countess\'s arrival, he might have been, if not still a free\r\nman, at least a man less irrevocably pledged.  But May had willed it\r\nso, and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibility--and\r\ntherefore at liberty, if he chose, to call on her cousin without\r\ntelling her.\r\n\r\nAs he stood on Madame Olenska\'s threshold curiosity was his uppermost\r\nfeeling.  He was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he\r\nconcluded that she was less simple than she seemed.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent\r\nbosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be Sicilian.\r\nShe welcomed him with all her white teeth, and answering his enquiries\r\nby a head-shake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into\r\na low firelit drawing-room.  The room was empty, and she left him, for\r\nan appreciable time, to wonder whether she had gone to find her\r\nmistress, or whether she had not understood what he was there for, and\r\nthought it might be to wind the clock--of which he perceived that the\r\nonly visible specimen had stopped.  He knew that the southern races\r\ncommunicated with each other in the language of pantomime, and was\r\nmortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible.  At length\r\nshe returned with a lamp; and Archer, having meanwhile put together a\r\nphrase out of Dante and Petrarch, evoked the answer: "La signora e\r\nfuori; ma verra subito"; which he took to mean:  "She\'s out--but you\'ll\r\nsoon see."\r\n\r\nWhat he saw, meanwhile, with the help of the lamp, was the faded\r\nshadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known.  He knew that the\r\nCountess Olenska had brought some of her possessions with her--bits of\r\nwreckage, she called them--and these, he supposed, were represented by\r\nsome small slender tables of dark wood, a delicate little Greek bronze\r\non the chimney-piece, and a stretch of red damask nailed on the\r\ndiscoloured wallpaper behind a couple of Italian-looking pictures in\r\nold frames.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer prided himself on his knowledge of Italian art.  His\r\nboyhood had been saturated with Ruskin, and he had read all the latest\r\nbooks: John Addington Symonds, Vernon Lee\'s "Euphorion," the essays of\r\nP. G. Hamerton, and a wonderful new volume called "The Renaissance" by\r\nWalter Pater.  He talked easily of Botticelli, and spoke of Fra\r\nAngelico with a faint condescension.  But these pictures bewildered\r\nhim, for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at (and\r\ntherefore able to see) when he travelled in Italy; and perhaps, also,\r\nhis powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding\r\nhimself in this strange empty house, where apparently no one expected\r\nhim.  He was sorry that he had not told May Welland of Countess\r\nOlenska\'s request, and a little disturbed by the thought that his\r\nbetrothed might come in to see her cousin.  What would she think if she\r\nfound him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting\r\nalone in the dusk at a lady\'s fireside?\r\n\r\nBut since he had come he meant to wait; and he sank into a chair and\r\nstretched his feet to the logs.\r\n\r\nIt was odd to have summoned him in that way, and then forgotten him;\r\nbut Archer felt more curious than mortified.  The atmosphere of the\r\nroom was so different from any he had ever breathed that\r\nself-consciousness vanished in the sense of adventure.  He had been\r\nbefore in drawing-rooms hung with red damask, with pictures "of the\r\nItalian school"; what struck him was the way in which Medora Manson\'s\r\nshabby hired house, with its blighted background of pampas grass and\r\nRogers statuettes, had, by a turn of the hand, and the skilful use of a\r\nfew properties, been transformed into something intimate, "foreign,"\r\nsubtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments.  He tried to\r\nanalyse the trick, to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and\r\ntables were grouped, in the fact that only two Jacqueminot roses (of\r\nwhich nobody ever bought less than a dozen) had been placed in the\r\nslender vase at his elbow, and in the vague pervading perfume that was\r\nnot what one put on handkerchiefs, but rather like the scent of some\r\nfar-off bazaar, a smell made up of Turkish coffee and ambergris and\r\ndried roses.\r\n\r\nHis mind wandered away to the question of what May\'s drawing-room would\r\nlook like.  He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving "very\r\nhandsomely," already had his eye on a newly built house in East\r\nThirty-ninth Street.  The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the\r\nhouse was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger\r\narchitects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone\r\nof which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce;\r\nbut the plumbing was perfect.  Archer would have liked to travel, to\r\nput off the housing question; but, though the Wellands approved of an\r\nextended European honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in Egypt), they were\r\nfirm as to the need of a house for the returning couple.  The young man\r\nfelt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up\r\nevery evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish-yellow\r\ndoorstep, and pass through a Pompeian vestibule into a hall with a\r\nwainscoting of varnished yellow wood.  But beyond that his imagination\r\ncould not travel.  He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but\r\nhe could not fancy how May would deal with it.  She submitted\r\ncheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland\r\ndrawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern\r\nSaxe.  He saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything\r\ndifferent in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that\r\nshe would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased--which\r\nwould be, of course, with "sincere" Eastlake furniture, and the plain\r\nnew bookcases without glass doors.\r\n\r\nThe round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log,\r\nand said consolingly: "Verra--verra."  When she had gone Archer stood\r\nup and began to wander about.  Should he wait any longer?  His position\r\nwas becoming rather foolish.  Perhaps he had misunderstood Madame\r\nOlenska--perhaps she had not invited him after all.\r\n\r\nDown the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a stepper\'s\r\nhoofs; they stopped before the house, and he caught the opening of a\r\ncarriage door.  Parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk.\r\nA street-lamp faced him, and in its light he saw Julius Beaufort\'s\r\ncompact English brougham, drawn by a big roan, and the banker\r\ndescending from it, and helping out Madame Olenska.\r\n\r\nBeaufort stood, hat in hand, saying something which his companion\r\nseemed to negative; then they shook hands, and he jumped into his\r\ncarriage while she mounted the steps.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing Archer\r\nthere; surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to.\r\n\r\n"How do you like my funny house?" she asked.  "To me it\'s like heaven."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away\r\nwith her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve arranged it delightfully," he rejoined, alive to the flatness\r\nof the words, but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming\r\ndesire to be simple and striking.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a poor little place.  My relations despise it.  But at any\r\nrate it\'s less gloomy than the van der Luydens\'."\r\n\r\nThe words gave him an electric shock, for few were the rebellious\r\nspirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der\r\nLuydens gloomy.  Those privileged to enter it shivered there, and spoke\r\nof it as "handsome."  But suddenly he was glad that she had given voice\r\nto the general shiver.\r\n\r\n"It\'s delicious--what you\'ve done here," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"I like the little house," she admitted; "but I suppose what I like is\r\nthe blessedness of its being here, in my own country and my own town;\r\nand then, of being alone in it."  She spoke so low that he hardly heard\r\nthe last phrase; but in his awkwardness he took it up.\r\n\r\n"You like so much to be alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely."  She sat down\r\nnear the fire, said:  "Nastasia will bring the tea presently," and\r\nsigned to him to return to his armchair, adding:  "I see you\'ve already\r\nchosen your corner."\r\n\r\nLeaning back, she folded her arms behind her head, and looked at the\r\nfire under drooping lids.\r\n\r\n"This is the hour I like best--don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nA proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: "I was afraid you\'d\r\nforgotten the hour.  Beaufort must have been very engrossing."\r\n\r\nShe looked amused.  "Why--have you waited long?  Mr. Beaufort took me\r\nto see a number of houses--since it seems I\'m not to be allowed to stay\r\nin this one."  She appeared to dismiss both Beaufort and himself from\r\nher mind, and went on:  "I\'ve never been in a city where there seems to\r\nbe such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques.  What\r\ndoes it matter where one lives?  I\'m told this street is respectable."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not fashionable."\r\n\r\n"Fashionable!  Do you all think so much of that?  Why not make one\'s\r\nown fashions?  But I suppose I\'ve lived too independently; at any rate,\r\nI want to do what you all do--I want to feel cared for and safe."\r\n\r\nHe was touched, as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her\r\nneed of guidance.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what your friends want you to feel.  New York\'s an awfully safe\r\nplace," he added with a flash of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it?  One feels that," she cried, missing the mockery.\r\n"Being here is like--like--being taken on a holiday when one has been a\r\ngood little girl and done all one\'s lessons."\r\n\r\nThe analogy was well meant, but did not altogether please him.  He did\r\nnot mind being flippant about New York, but disliked to hear any one\r\nelse take the same tone.  He wondered if she did not begin to see what\r\na powerful engine it was, and how nearly it had crushed her.  The\r\nLovell Mingotts\' dinner, patched up in extremis out of all sorts of\r\nsocial odds and ends, ought to have taught her the narrowness of her\r\nescape; but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted\r\ndisaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van\r\nder Luyden evening.  Archer inclined to the former theory; he fancied\r\nthat her New York was still completely undifferentiated, and the\r\nconjecture nettled him.\r\n\r\n"Last night," he said, "New York laid itself out for you.  The van der\r\nLuydens do nothing by halves."\r\n\r\n"No: how kind they are!  It was such a nice party.  Every one seems to\r\nhave such an esteem for them."\r\n\r\nThe terms were hardly adequate; she might have spoken in that way of a\r\ntea-party at the dear old Miss Lannings\'.\r\n\r\n"The van der Luydens," said Archer, feeling himself pompous as he\r\nspoke, "are the most powerful influence in New York society.\r\nUnfortunately--owing to her health--they receive very seldom."\r\n\r\nShe unclasped her hands from behind her head, and looked at him\r\nmeditatively.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that perhaps the reason?"\r\n\r\n"The reason--?"\r\n\r\n"For their great influence; that they make themselves so rare."\r\n\r\nHe coloured a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration\r\nof the remark.  At a stroke she had pricked the van der Luydens and\r\nthey collapsed.  He laughed, and sacrificed them.\r\n\r\nNastasia brought the tea, with handleless Japanese cups and little\r\ncovered dishes, placing the tray on a low table.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll explain these things to me--you\'ll tell me all I ought to\r\nknow," Madame Olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his cup.\r\n\r\n"It\'s you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things I\'d looked at\r\nso long that I\'d ceased to see them."\r\n\r\nShe detached a small gold cigarette-case from one of her bracelets,\r\nheld it out to him, and took a cigarette herself.  On the chimney were\r\nlong spills for lighting them.\r\n\r\n"Ah, then we can both help each other.  But I want help so much more.\r\nYou must tell me just what to do."\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of his tongue to reply:  "Don\'t be seen driving about\r\nthe streets with Beaufort--" but he was being too deeply drawn into the\r\natmosphere of the room, which was her atmosphere, and to give advice of\r\nthat sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for\r\nattar-of-roses in Samarkand that one should always be provided with\r\narctics for a New York winter.  New York seemed much farther off than\r\nSamarkand, and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering\r\nwhat might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look\r\nat his native city objectively.  Viewed thus, as through the wrong end\r\nof a telescope, it looked disconcertingly small and distant; but then\r\nfrom Samarkand it would.\r\n\r\nA flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire, stretching her\r\nthin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails.\r\nThe light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her\r\nbraids, and made her pale face paler.\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of people to tell you what to do," Archer rejoined,\r\nobscurely envious of them.\r\n\r\n"Oh--all my aunts?  And my dear old Granny?"  She considered the idea\r\nimpartially.  "They\'re all a little vexed with me for setting up for\r\nmyself--poor Granny especially.  She wanted to keep me with her; but I\r\nhad to be free--"  He was impressed by this light way of speaking of\r\nthe formidable Catherine, and moved by the thought of what must have\r\ngiven Madame Olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of\r\nfreedom.  But the idea of Beaufort gnawed him.\r\n\r\n"I think I understand how you feel," he said.  "Still, your family can\r\nadvise you; explain differences; show you the way."\r\n\r\nShe lifted her thin black eyebrows.  "Is New York such a labyrinth?  I\r\nthought it so straight up and down--like Fifth Avenue.  And with all\r\nthe cross streets numbered!"  She seemed to guess his faint disapproval\r\nof this, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face:\r\n"If you knew how I like it for just THAT--the straight-up-and-downness,\r\nand the big honest labels on everything!"\r\n\r\nHe saw his chance.  "Everything may be labelled--but everybody is not."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps.  I may simplify too much--but you\'ll warn me if I do."  She\r\nturned from the fire to look at him.  "There are only two people here\r\nwho make me feel as if they understood what I mean and could explain\r\nthings to me: you and Mr. Beaufort."\r\n\r\nArcher winced at the joining of the names, and then, with a quick\r\nreadjustment, understood, sympathised and pitied.  So close to the\r\npowers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely\r\nin their air.  But since she felt that he understood her also, his\r\nbusiness would be to make her see Beaufort as he really was, with all\r\nhe represented--and abhor it.\r\n\r\nHe answered gently:  "I understand.  But just at first don\'t let go of\r\nyour old friends\' hands: I mean the older women, your Granny Mingott,\r\nMrs. Welland, Mrs. van der Luyden.  They like and admire you--they want\r\nto help you."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and sighed.  "Oh, I know--I know!  But on condition\r\nthat they don\'t hear anything unpleasant.  Aunt Welland put it in those\r\nvery words when I tried....  Does no one want to know the truth here,\r\nMr. Archer?  The real loneliness is living among all these kind people\r\nwho only ask one to pretend!" She lifted her hands to her face, and he\r\nsaw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.\r\n\r\n"Madame Olenska!--Oh, don\'t, Ellen," he cried, starting up and bending\r\nover her.  He drew down one of her hands, clasping and chafing it like\r\na child\'s while he murmured reassuring words; but in a moment she freed\r\nherself, and looked up at him with wet lashes.\r\n\r\n"Does no one cry here, either?  I suppose there\'s no need to, in\r\nheaven," she said, straightening her loosened braids with a laugh, and\r\nbending over the tea-kettle.  It was burnt into his consciousness that\r\nhe had called her "Ellen"--called her so twice; and that she had not\r\nnoticed it.  Far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white\r\nfigure of May Welland--in New York.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich Italian.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska, again with a hand at her hair, uttered an exclamation\r\nof assent--a flashing "Gia--gia"--and the Duke of St. Austrey entered,\r\npiloting a tremendous blackwigged and red-plumed lady in overflowing\r\nfurs.\r\n\r\n"My dear Countess, I\'ve brought an old friend of mine to see you--Mrs.\r\nStruthers.  She wasn\'t asked to the party last night, and she wants to\r\nknow you."\r\n\r\nThe Duke beamed on the group, and Madame Olenska advanced with a murmur\r\nof welcome toward the queer couple.  She seemed to have no idea how\r\noddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the Duke had taken in\r\nbringing his companion--and to do him justice, as Archer perceived, the\r\nDuke seemed as unaware of it himself.\r\n\r\n"Of course I want to know you, my dear," cried Mrs. Struthers in a\r\nround rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.\r\n"I want to know everybody who\'s young and interesting and charming.\r\nAnd the Duke tells me you like music--didn\'t you, Duke?  You\'re a\r\npianist yourself, I believe?  Well, do you want to hear Sarasate play\r\ntomorrow evening at my house?  You know I\'ve something going on every\r\nSunday evening--it\'s the day when New York doesn\'t know what to do with\r\nitself, and so I say to it:  \'Come and be amused.\'  And the Duke\r\nthought you\'d be tempted by Sarasate.  You\'ll find a number of your\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska\'s face grew brilliant with pleasure.  "How kind!  How\r\ngood of the Duke to think of me!" She pushed a chair up to the\r\ntea-table and Mrs. Struthers sank into it delectably.  "Of course I\r\nshall be too happy to come."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, my dear.  And bring your young gentleman with you."\r\nMrs. Struthers extended a hail-fellow hand to Archer.  "I can\'t put a\r\nname to you--but I\'m sure I\'ve met you--I\'ve met everybody, here, or in\r\nParis or London.  Aren\'t you in diplomacy?  All the diplomatists come\r\nto me.  You like music too?  Duke, you must be sure to bring him."\r\n\r\nThe Duke said "Rather" from the depths of his beard, and Archer\r\nwithdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of\r\nspine as a self-conscious school-boy among careless and unnoticing\r\nelders.\r\n\r\nHe was not sorry for the denouement of his visit: he only wished it had\r\ncome sooner, and spared him a certain waste of emotion.  As he went out\r\ninto the wintry night, New York again became vast and imminent, and May\r\nWelland the loveliest woman in it.  He turned into his florist\'s to\r\nsend her the daily box of lilies-of-the-valley which, to his confusion,\r\nhe found he had forgotten that morning.\r\n\r\nAs he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced\r\nabout the embowered shop, and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses.\r\nHe had never seen any as sun-golden before, and his first impulse was\r\nto send them to May instead of the lilies.  But they did not look like\r\nher--there was something too rich, too strong, in their fiery beauty.\r\nIn a sudden revulsion of mood, and almost without knowing what he did,\r\nhe signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box, and\r\nslipped his card into a second envelope, on which he wrote the name of\r\nthe Countess Olenska; then, just as he was turning away, he drew the\r\ncard out again, and left the empty envelope on the box.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll go at once?" he enquired, pointing to the roses.\r\n\r\nThe florist assured him that they would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nThe next day he persuaded May to escape for a walk in the Park after\r\nluncheon.  As was the custom in old-fashioned Episcopalian New York,\r\nshe usually accompanied her parents to church on Sunday afternoons; but\r\nMrs. Welland condoned her truancy, having that very morning won her\r\nover to the necessity of a long engagement, with time to prepare a\r\nhand-embroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens.\r\n\r\nThe day was delectable.  The bare vaulting of trees along the Mall was\r\nceiled with lapis lazuli, and arched above snow that shone like\r\nsplintered crystals.  It was the weather to call out May\'s radiance,\r\nand she burned like a young maple in the frost.  Archer was proud of\r\nthe glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared\r\naway his underlying perplexities.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley\r\nin one\'s room!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday they came late.  I hadn\'t time in the morning--"\r\n\r\n"But your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much\r\nmore than if you\'d given a standing order, and they came every morning\r\non the minute, like one\'s music-teacher--as I know Gertrude Lefferts\'s\r\ndid, for instance, when she and Lawrence were engaged."\r\n\r\n"Ah--they would!" laughed Archer, amused at her keenness.  He looked\r\nsideways at her fruit-like cheek and felt rich and secure enough to\r\nadd:  "When I sent your lilies yesterday afternoon I saw some rather\r\ngorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to Madame Olenska.  Was that\r\nright?"\r\n\r\n"How dear of you!  Anything of that kind delights her.  It\'s odd she\r\ndidn\'t mention it: she lunched with us today, and spoke of Mr.\r\nBeaufort\'s having sent her wonderful orchids, and cousin Henry van der\r\nLuyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff.  She seems so\r\nsurprised to receive flowers.  Don\'t people send them in Europe?  She\r\nthinks it such a pretty custom."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, no wonder mine were overshadowed by Beaufort\'s," said Archer\r\nirritably.  Then he remembered that he had not put a card with the\r\nroses, and was vexed at having spoken of them.  He wanted to say:  "I\r\ncalled on your cousin yesterday," but hesitated.  If Madame Olenska had\r\nnot spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should.  Yet not\r\nto do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked.  To shake\r\noff the question he began to talk of their own plans, their future, and\r\nMrs. Welland\'s insistence on a long engagement.\r\n\r\n"If you call it long!  Isabel Chivers and Reggie were engaged for two\r\nyears: Grace and Thorley for nearly a year and a half.  Why aren\'t we\r\nvery well off as we are?"\r\n\r\nIt was the traditional maidenly interrogation, and he felt ashamed of\r\nhimself for finding it singularly childish.  No doubt she simply echoed\r\nwhat was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birthday,\r\nand he wondered at what age "nice" women began to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n"Never, if we won\'t let them, I suppose," he mused, and recalled his\r\nmad outburst to Mr. Sillerton Jackson: "Women ought to be as free as we\r\nare--"\r\n\r\nIt would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young\r\nwoman\'s eyes, and bid her look forth on the world.  But how many\r\ngenerations of the women who had gone to her making had descended\r\nbandaged to the family vault?  He shivered a little, remembering some\r\nof the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much-cited instance\r\nof the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because\r\nthey had no use for them.  What if, when he had bidden May Welland to\r\nopen hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness?\r\n\r\n"We might be much better off.  We might be altogether together--we\r\nmight travel."\r\n\r\nHer face lit up.  "That would be lovely," she owned: she would love to\r\ntravel.  But her mother would not understand their wanting to do things\r\nso differently.\r\n\r\n"As if the mere \'differently\' didn\'t account for it!" the wooer\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n"Newland!  You\'re so original!" she exulted.\r\n\r\nHis heart sank, for he saw that he was saying all the things that young\r\nmen in the same situation were expected to say, and that she was making\r\nthe answers that instinct and tradition taught her to make--even to the\r\npoint of calling him original.\r\n\r\n"Original!  We\'re all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the\r\nsame folded paper.  We\'re like patterns stencilled on a wall.  Can\'t\r\nyou and I strike out for ourselves, May?"\r\n\r\nHe had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion, and\r\nher eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration.\r\n\r\n"Mercy--shall we elope?" she laughed.\r\n\r\n"If you would--"\r\n\r\n"You DO love me, Newland!  I\'m so happy."\r\n\r\n"But then--why not be happier?"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t behave like people in novels, though, can we?"\r\n\r\n"Why not--why not--why not?"\r\n\r\nShe looked a little bored by his insistence.  She knew very well that\r\nthey couldn\'t, but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason.\r\n"I\'m not clever enough to argue with you.  But that kind of thing is\r\nrather--vulgar, isn\'t it?" she suggested, relieved to have hit on a\r\nword that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject.\r\n\r\n"Are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?"\r\n\r\nShe was evidently staggered by this.  "Of course I should hate it--so\r\nwould you," she rejoined, a trifle irritably.\r\n\r\nHe stood silent, beating his stick nervously against his boot-top; and\r\nfeeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the\r\ndiscussion, she went on light-heartedly: "Oh, did I tell you that I\r\nshowed Ellen my ring?  She thinks it the most beautiful setting she\r\never saw.  There\'s nothing like it in the rue de la Paix, she said.  I\r\ndo love you, Newland, for being so artistic!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, as Archer, before dinner, sat smoking sullenly in\r\nhis study, Janey wandered in on him.  He had failed to stop at his club\r\non the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the\r\nlaw in the leisurely manner common to well-to-do New Yorkers of his\r\nclass.  He was out of spirits and slightly out of temper, and a\r\nhaunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour\r\nbesieged his brain.\r\n\r\n"Sameness--sameness!" he muttered, the word running through his head\r\nlike a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tall-hatted figures\r\nlounging behind the plate-glass; and because he usually dropped in at\r\nthe club at that hour he had gone home instead.  He knew not only what\r\nthey were likely to be talking about, but the part each one would take\r\nin the discussion.  The Duke of course would be their principal theme;\r\nthough the appearance in Fifth Avenue of a golden-haired lady in a\r\nsmall canary-coloured brougham with a pair of black cobs (for which\r\nBeaufort was generally thought responsible) would also doubtless be\r\nthoroughly gone into.  Such "women" (as they were called) were few in\r\nNew York, those driving their own carriages still fewer, and the\r\nappearance of Miss Fanny Ring in Fifth Avenue at the fashionable hour\r\nhad profoundly agitated society.  Only the day before, her carriage had\r\npassed Mrs. Lovell Mingott\'s, and the latter had instantly rung the\r\nlittle bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home.\r\n"What if it had happened to Mrs. van der Luyden?" people asked each\r\nother with a shudder.  Archer could hear Lawrence Lefferts, at that\r\nvery hour, holding forth on the disintegration of society.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head irritably when his sister Janey entered, and then\r\nquickly bent over his book (Swinburne\'s "Chastelard"--just out) as if\r\nhe had not seen her.  She glanced at the writing-table heaped with\r\nbooks, opened a volume of the "Contes Drolatiques," made a wry face\r\nover the archaic French, and sighed:  "What learned things you read!"\r\n\r\n"Well--?" he asked, as she hovered Cassandra-like before him.\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s very angry."\r\n\r\n"Angry?  With whom?  About what?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Sophy Jackson has just been here.  She brought word that her\r\nbrother would come in after dinner: she couldn\'t say very much, because\r\nhe forbade her to: he wishes to give all the details himself.  He\'s\r\nwith cousin Louisa van der Luyden now."\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, my dear girl, try a fresh start.  It would take an\r\nomniscient Deity to know what you\'re talking about."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a time to be profane, Newland....  Mother feels badly enough\r\nabout your not going to church ..."\r\n\r\nWith a groan he plunged back into his book.\r\n\r\n"NEWLAND!  Do listen.  Your friend Madame Olenska was at Mrs. Lemuel\r\nStruthers\'s party last night: she went there with the Duke and Mr.\r\nBeaufort."\r\n\r\nAt the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the\r\nyoung man\'s breast.  To smother it he laughed.  "Well, what of it?  I\r\nknew she meant to."\r\n\r\nJaney paled and her eyes began to project.  "You knew she meant to--and\r\nyou didn\'t try to stop her?  To warn her?"\r\n\r\n"Stop her?  Warn her?"  He laughed again.  "I\'m not engaged to be\r\nmarried to the Countess Olenska!"  The words had a fantastic sound in\r\nhis own ears.\r\n\r\n"You\'re marrying into her family."\r\n\r\n"Oh, family--family!" he jeered.\r\n\r\n"Newland--don\'t you care about Family?"\r\n\r\n"Not a brass farthing."\r\n\r\n"Nor about what cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think?"\r\n\r\n"Not the half of one--if she thinks such old maid\'s rubbish."\r\n\r\n"Mother is not an old maid," said his virgin sister with pinched lips.\r\n\r\nHe felt like shouting back:  "Yes, she is, and so are the van der\r\nLuydens, and so we all are, when it comes to being so much as brushed\r\nby the wing-tip of Reality." But he saw her long gentle face puckering\r\ninto tears, and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting.\r\n\r\n"Hang Countess Olenska!  Don\'t be a goose, Janey--I\'m not her keeper."\r\n\r\n"No; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so\r\nthat we might all back her up; and if it hadn\'t been for that cousin\r\nLouisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Well--what harm was there in inviting her?  She was the best-looking\r\nwoman in the room; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the\r\nusual van der Luyden banquet."\r\n\r\n"You know cousin Henry asked her to please you: he persuaded cousin\r\nLouisa.  And now they\'re so upset that they\'re going back to\r\nSkuytercliff tomorrow.  I think, Newland, you\'d better come down.  You\r\ndon\'t seem to understand how mother feels."\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Newland found his mother.  She raised a troubled\r\nbrow from her needlework to ask: "Has Janey told you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."  He tried to keep his tone as measured as her own.  "But I can\'t\r\ntake it very seriously."\r\n\r\n"Not the fact of having offended cousin Louisa and cousin Henry?"\r\n\r\n"The fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as Countess\r\nOlenska\'s going to the house of a woman they consider common."\r\n\r\n"Consider--!"\r\n\r\n"Well, who is; but who has good music, and amuses people on Sunday\r\nevenings, when the whole of New York is dying of inanition."\r\n\r\n"Good music?  All I know is, there was a woman who got up on a table\r\nand sang the things they sing at the places you go to in Paris.  There\r\nwas smoking and champagne."\r\n\r\n"Well--that kind of thing happens in other places, and the world still\r\ngoes on."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose, dear, you\'re really defending the French Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard you often enough, mother, grumble at the English Sunday\r\nwhen we\'ve been in London."\r\n\r\n"New York is neither Paris nor London."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, it\'s not!" her son groaned.\r\n\r\n"You mean, I suppose, that society here is not as brilliant?  You\'re\r\nright, I daresay; but we belong here, and people should respect our\r\nways when they come among us.  Ellen Olenska especially: she came back\r\nto get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies."\r\n\r\nNewland made no answer, and after a moment his mother ventured:  "I was\r\ngoing to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin Louisa\r\nfor a moment before dinner."  He frowned, and she continued: "I thought\r\nyou might explain to her what you\'ve just said: that society abroad is\r\ndifferent ... that people are not as particular, and that Madame\r\nOlenska may not have realised how we feel about such things.  It would\r\nbe, you know, dear," she added with an innocent adroitness, "in Madame\r\nOlenska\'s interest if you did."\r\n\r\n"Dearest mother, I really don\'t see how we\'re concerned in the matter.\r\nThe Duke took Madame Olenska to Mrs. Struthers\'s--in fact he brought\r\nMrs. Struthers to call on her.  I was there when they came.  If the van\r\nder Luydens want to quarrel with anybody, the real culprit is under\r\ntheir own roof."\r\n\r\n"Quarrel?  Newland, did you ever know of cousin Henry\'s quarrelling?\r\nBesides, the Duke\'s his guest; and a stranger too.  Strangers don\'t\r\ndiscriminate: how should they?  Countess Olenska is a New Yorker, and\r\nshould have respected the feelings of New York."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if they must have a victim, you have my leave to throw\r\nMadame Olenska to them," cried her son, exasperated.  "I don\'t see\r\nmyself--or you either--offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course you see only the Mingott side," his mother answered, in\r\nthe sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger.\r\n\r\nThe sad butler drew back the drawing-room portieres and announced:\r\n"Mr. Henry van der Luyden."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an\r\nagitated hand.\r\n\r\n"Another lamp," she cried to the retreating servant, while Janey bent\r\nover to straighten her mother\'s cap.\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden\'s figure loomed on the threshold, and Newland Archer\r\nwent forward to greet his cousin.\r\n\r\n"We were just talking about you, sir," he said.\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement.  He drew off\r\nhis glove to shake hands with the ladies, and smoothed his tall hat\r\nshyly, while Janey pushed an arm-chair forward, and Archer continued:\r\n"And the Countess Olenska."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer paled.\r\n\r\n"Ah--a charming woman.  I have just been to see her," said Mr. van der\r\nLuyden, complacency restored to his brow.  He sank into the chair, laid\r\nhis hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the old-fashioned way,\r\nand went on:  "She has a real gift for arranging flowers.  I had sent\r\nher a few carnations from Skuytercliff, and I was astonished.  Instead\r\nof massing them in big bunches as our head-gardener does, she had\r\nscattered them about loosely, here and there ... I can\'t say how.  The\r\nDuke had told me: he said:  \'Go and see how cleverly she\'s arranged her\r\ndrawing-room.\'  And she has.  I should really like to take Louisa to\r\nsee her, if the neighbourhood were not so--unpleasant."\r\n\r\nA dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from Mr. van der\r\nLuyden.  Mrs. Archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which\r\nshe had nervously tumbled it, and Newland, leaning against the\r\nchimney-place and twisting a humming-bird-feather screen in his hand,\r\nsaw Janey\'s gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," Mr. van der Luyden continued, stroking his long grey leg\r\nwith a bloodless hand weighed down by the Patroon\'s great signet-ring,\r\n"the fact is, I dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she\r\nwrote me about my flowers; and also--but this is between ourselves, of\r\ncourse--to give her a friendly warning about allowing the Duke to carry\r\nher off to parties with him.  I don\'t know if you\'ve heard--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer produced an indulgent smile.  "Has the Duke been carrying\r\nher off to parties?"\r\n\r\n"You know what these English grandees are.  They\'re all alike.  Louisa\r\nand I are very fond of our cousin--but it\'s hopeless to expect people\r\nwho are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about\r\nour little republican distinctions.  The Duke goes where he\'s amused."\r\nMr. van der Luyden paused, but no one spoke.  "Yes--it seems he took\r\nher with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\'s.  Sillerton Jackson\r\nhas just been to us with the foolish story, and Louisa was rather\r\ntroubled.  So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess\r\nOlenska and explain--by the merest hint, you know--how we feel in New\r\nYork about certain things.  I felt I might, without indelicacy, because\r\nthe evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me\r\nsee that she would be grateful for guidance.  And she WAS."\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden looked about the room with what would have been\r\nself-satisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions.  On\r\nhis face it became a mild benevolence which Mrs. Archer\'s countenance\r\ndutifully reflected.\r\n\r\n"How kind you both are, dear Henry--always!  Newland will particularly\r\nappreciate what you have done because of dear May and his new\r\nrelations."\r\n\r\nShe shot an admonitory glance at her son, who said: "Immensely, sir.\r\nBut I was sure you\'d like Madame Olenska."\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness.  "I never ask\r\nto my house, my dear Newland," he said, "any one whom I do not like.\r\nAnd so I have just told Sillerton Jackson."  With a glance at the clock\r\nhe rose and added:  "But Louisa will be waiting.  We are dining early,\r\nto take the Duke to the Opera."\r\n\r\nAfter the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence\r\nfell upon the Archer family.\r\n\r\n"Gracious--how romantic!" at last broke explosively from Janey.  No one\r\nknew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments, and her relations had\r\nlong since given up trying to interpret them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer shook her head with a sigh.  "Provided it all turns out for\r\nthe best," she said, in the tone of one who knows how surely it will\r\nnot.  "Newland, you must stay and see Sillerton Jackson when he comes\r\nthis evening: I really shan\'t know what to say to him."\r\n\r\n"Poor mother!  But he won\'t come--" her son laughed, stooping to kiss\r\naway her frown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nSome two weeks later, Newland Archer, sitting in abstracted idleness in\r\nhis private compartment of the office of Letterblair, Lamson and Low,\r\nattorneys at law, was summoned by the head of the firm.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Letterblair, the accredited legal adviser of three generations\r\nof New York gentility, throned behind his mahogany desk in evident\r\nperplexity.  As he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his\r\nhand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows, his\r\ndisrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the Family\r\nPhysician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir--" he always addressed Archer as "sir"--"I have sent for\r\nyou to go into a little matter; a matter which, for the moment, I\r\nprefer not to mention either to Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood."  The\r\ngentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm; for,\r\nas was always the case with legal associations of old standing in New\r\nYork, all the partners named on the office letter-head were long since\r\ndead; and Mr. Letterblair, for example, was, professionally speaking,\r\nhis own grandson.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow.  "For family\r\nreasons--" he continued.\r\n\r\nArcher looked up.\r\n\r\n"The Mingott family," said Mr. Letterblair with an explanatory smile\r\nand bow.  "Mrs. Manson Mingott sent for me yesterday.  Her\r\ngrand-daughter the Countess Olenska wishes to sue her husband for\r\ndivorce.  Certain papers have been placed in my hands."  He paused and\r\ndrummed on his desk.  "In view of your prospective alliance with the\r\nfamily I should like to consult you--to consider the case with\r\nyou--before taking any farther steps."\r\n\r\nArcher felt the blood in his temples.  He had seen the Countess Olenska\r\nonly once since his visit to her, and then at the Opera, in the Mingott\r\nbox.  During this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate\r\nimage, receding from his foreground as May Welland resumed her rightful\r\nplace in it.  He had not heard her divorce spoken of since Janey\'s\r\nfirst random allusion to it, and had dismissed the tale as unfounded\r\ngossip.  Theoretically, the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful\r\nto him as to his mother; and he was annoyed that Mr. Letterblair (no\r\ndoubt prompted by old Catherine Mingott) should be so evidently\r\nplanning to draw him into the affair.  After all, there were plenty of\r\nMingott men for such jobs, and as yet he was not even a Mingott by\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nHe waited for the senior partner to continue.  Mr. Letterblair unlocked\r\na drawer and drew out a packet.  "If you will run your eye over these\r\npapers--"\r\n\r\nArcher frowned.  "I beg your pardon, sir; but just because of the\r\nprospective relationship, I should prefer your consulting Mr. Skipworth\r\nor Mr. Redwood."\r\n\r\nMr. Letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended.  It was unusual\r\nfor a junior to reject such an opening.\r\n\r\nHe bowed.  "I respect your scruple, sir; but in this case I believe\r\ntrue delicacy requires you to do as I ask.  Indeed, the suggestion is\r\nnot mine but Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s and her son\'s.  I have seen Lovell\r\nMingott; and also Mr. Welland.  They all named you."\r\n\r\nArcher felt his temper rising.  He had been somewhat languidly drifting\r\nwith events for the last fortnight, and letting May\'s fair looks and\r\nradiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the\r\nMingott claims.  But this behest of old Mrs. Mingott\'s roused him to a\r\nsense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a\r\nprospective son-in-law; and he chafed at the role.\r\n\r\n"Her uncles ought to deal with this," he said.\r\n\r\n"They have.  The matter has been gone into by the family.  They are\r\nopposed to the Countess\'s idea; but she is firm, and insists on a legal\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent: he had not opened the packet in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Does she want to marry again?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it is suggested; but she denies it."\r\n\r\n"Then--"\r\n\r\n"Will you oblige me, Mr. Archer, by first looking through these papers?\r\nAfterward, when we have talked the case over, I will give you my\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\nArcher withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents.  Since their\r\nlast meeting he had half-unconsciously collaborated with events in\r\nridding himself of the burden of Madame Olenska.  His hour alone with\r\nher by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which\r\nthe Duke of St. Austrey\'s intrusion with Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and the\r\nCountess\'s joyous greeting of them, had rather providentially broken.\r\nTwo days later Archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement\r\nin the van der Luydens\' favour, and had said to himself, with a touch\r\nof tartness, that a lady who knew how to thank all-powerful elderly\r\ngentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need\r\neither the private consolations or the public championship of a young\r\nman of his small compass.  To look at the matter in this light\r\nsimplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim\r\ndomestic virtues.  He could not picture May Welland, in whatever\r\nconceivable emergency, hawking about her private difficulties and\r\nlavishing her confidences on strange men; and she had never seemed to\r\nhim finer or fairer than in the week that followed.  He had even\r\nyielded to her wish for a long engagement, since she had found the one\r\ndisarming answer to his plea for haste.\r\n\r\n"You know, when it comes to the point, your parents have always let you\r\nhave your way ever since you were a little girl," he argued; and she\r\nhad answered, with her clearest look:  "Yes; and that\'s what makes it\r\nso hard to refuse the very last thing they\'ll ever ask of me as a\r\nlittle girl."\r\n\r\nThat was the old New York note; that was the kind of answer he would\r\nlike always to be sure of his wife\'s making.  If one had habitually\r\nbreathed the New York air there were times when anything less\r\ncrystalline seemed stifling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact; but\r\nthey plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered.\r\nThey consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between Count Olenski\'s\r\nsolicitors and a French legal firm to whom the Countess had applied for\r\nthe settlement of her financial situation.  There was also a short\r\nletter from the Count to his wife: after reading it, Newland Archer\r\nrose, jammed the papers back into their envelope, and reentered Mr.\r\nLetterblair\'s office.\r\n\r\n"Here are the letters, sir.  If you wish, I\'ll see Madame Olenska," he\r\nsaid in a constrained voice.\r\n\r\n"Thank you--thank you, Mr. Archer.  Come and dine with me tonight if\r\nyou\'re free, and we\'ll go into the matter afterward: in case you wish\r\nto call on our client tomorrow."\r\n\r\nNewland Archer walked straight home again that afternoon.  It was a\r\nwinter evening of transparent clearness, with an innocent young moon\r\nabove the house-tops; and he wanted to fill his soul\'s lungs with the\r\npure radiance, and not exchange a word with any one till he and Mr.\r\nLetterblair were closeted together after dinner.  It was impossible to\r\ndecide otherwise than he had done: he must see Madame Olenska himself\r\nrather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes.  A great wave of\r\ncompassion had swept away his indifference and impatience: she stood\r\nbefore him as an exposed and pitiful figure, to be saved at all costs\r\nfrom farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate.\r\n\r\nHe remembered what she had told him of Mrs. Welland\'s request to be\r\nspared whatever was "unpleasant" in her history, and winced at the\r\nthought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the New\r\nYork air so pure.  "Are we only Pharisees after all?" he wondered,\r\npuzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human\r\nvileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had\r\nalways been.  He passed for a young man who had not been afraid of\r\nrisks, and he knew that his secret love-affair with poor silly Mrs.\r\nThorley Rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming\r\nair of adventure.  But Mrs. Rushworth was "that kind of woman";\r\nfoolish, vain, clandestine by nature, and far more attracted by the\r\nsecrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he\r\npossessed.  When the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart, but\r\nnow it seemed the redeeming feature of the case.  The affair, in short,\r\nhad been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been\r\nthrough, and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed\r\nbelief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and\r\nrespected and those one enjoyed--and pitied.  In this view they were\r\nsedulously abetted by their mothers, aunts and other elderly female\r\nrelatives, who all shared Mrs. Archer\'s belief that when "such things\r\nhappened" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always\r\ncriminal of the woman.  All the elderly ladies whom Archer knew\r\nregarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous\r\nand designing, and mere simple-minded man as powerless in her clutches.\r\nThe only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to\r\nmarry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him.\r\n\r\nIn the complicated old European communities, Archer began to guess,\r\nlove-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.  Rich\r\nand idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such\r\nsituations; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally\r\nsensitive and aloof would yet, from the force of circumstances, from\r\nsheer defencelessness and loneliness, be drawn into a tie inexcusable\r\nby conventional standards.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home he wrote a line to the Countess Olenska, asking at\r\nwhat hour of the next day she could receive him, and despatched it by a\r\nmessenger-boy, who returned presently with a word to the effect that\r\nshe was going to Skuytercliff the next morning to stay over Sunday with\r\nthe van der Luydens, but that he would find her alone that evening\r\nafter dinner.  The note was written on a rather untidy half-sheet,\r\nwithout date or address, but her hand was firm and free.  He was amused\r\nat the idea of her week-ending in the stately solitude of Skuytercliff,\r\nbut immediately afterward felt that there, of all places, she would\r\nmost feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the "unpleasant."\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was at Mr. Letterblair\'s punctually at seven, glad of the pretext\r\nfor excusing himself soon after dinner.  He had formed his own opinion\r\nfrom the papers entrusted to him, and did not especially want to go\r\ninto the matter with his senior partner.  Mr. Letterblair was a\r\nwidower, and they dined alone, copiously and slowly, in a dark shabby\r\nroom hung with yellowing prints of "The Death of Chatham" and "The\r\nCoronation of Napoleon."  On the sideboard, between fluted Sheraton\r\nknife-cases, stood a decanter of Haut Brion, and another of the old\r\nLanning port (the gift of a client), which the wastrel Tom Lanning had\r\nsold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in\r\nSan Francisco--an incident less publicly humiliating to the family than\r\nthe sale of the cellar.\r\n\r\nAfter a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers, then a young\r\nbroiled turkey with corn fritters, followed by a canvas-back with\r\ncurrant jelly and a celery mayonnaise.  Mr. Letterblair, who lunched on\r\na sandwich and tea, dined deliberately and deeply, and insisted on his\r\nguest\'s doing the same.  Finally, when the closing rites had been\r\naccomplished, the cloth was removed, cigars were lit, and Mr.\r\nLetterblair, leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward,\r\nsaid, spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him:  "The\r\nwhole family are against a divorce.  And I think rightly."\r\n\r\nArcher instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument.  "But\r\nwhy, sir?  If there ever was a case--"\r\n\r\n"Well--what\'s the use?  SHE\'S here--he\'s there; the Atlantic\'s between\r\nthem.  She\'ll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he\'s\r\nvoluntarily returned to her: their damned heathen marriage settlements\r\ntake precious good care of that.  As things go over there, Olenski\'s\r\nacted generously: he might have turned her out without a penny."\r\n\r\nThe young man knew this and was silent.\r\n\r\n"I understand, though," Mr. Letterblair continued, "that she attaches\r\nno importance to the money.  Therefore, as the family say, why not let\r\nwell enough alone?"\r\n\r\nArcher had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with Mr.\r\nLetterblair\'s view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and\r\nsupremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the Pharisaic voice of\r\na society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s for her to decide."\r\n\r\n"H\'m--have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce?"\r\n\r\n"You mean the threat in her husband\'s letter?  What weight would that\r\ncarry?  It\'s no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the\r\nsuit."\r\n\r\n"Unpleasant--!" said Archer explosively.\r\n\r\nMr. Letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows, and the\r\nyoung man, aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in\r\nhis mind, bowed acquiescently while his senior continued:  "Divorce is\r\nalways unpleasant."\r\n\r\n"You agree with me?" Mr. Letterblair resumed, after a waiting silence.\r\n\r\n"Naturally," said Archer.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I may count on you; the Mingotts may count on you; to use\r\nyour influence against the idea?"\r\n\r\nArcher hesitated.  "I can\'t pledge myself till I\'ve seen the Countess\r\nOlenska," he said at length.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Archer, I don\'t understand you.  Do you want to marry into a\r\nfamily with a scandalous divorce-suit hanging over it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that has anything to do with the case."\r\n\r\nMr. Letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young\r\npartner a cautious and apprehensive gaze.\r\n\r\nArcher understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn,\r\nand for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect.  Now that the job\r\nhad been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it; and, to\r\nguard against the possibility, he saw that he must reassure the\r\nunimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the Mingotts.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure, sir, that I shan\'t commit myself till I\'ve reported\r\nto you; what I meant was that I\'d rather not give an opinion till I\'ve\r\nheard what Madame Olenska has to say."\r\n\r\nMr. Letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of\r\nthe best New York tradition, and the young man, glancing at his watch,\r\npleaded an engagement and took leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned New York dined at seven, and the habit of after-dinner\r\ncalls, though derided in Archer\'s set, still generally prevailed.  As\r\nthe young man strolled up Fifth Avenue from Waverley Place, the long\r\nthoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before\r\nthe Reggie Chiverses\' (where there was a dinner for the Duke), and the\r\noccasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler\r\nascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas-lit hall.\r\nThus, as Archer crossed Washington Square, he remarked that old Mr. du\r\nLac was calling on his cousins the Dagonets, and turning down the\r\ncorner of West Tenth Street he saw Mr. Skipworth, of his own firm,\r\nobviously bound on a visit to the Miss Lannings.  A little farther up\r\nFifth Avenue, Beaufort appeared on his doorstep, darkly projected\r\nagainst a blaze of light, descended to his private brougham, and rolled\r\naway to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination.  It was\r\nnot an Opera night, and no one was giving a party, so that Beaufort\'s\r\nouting was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature.  Archer connected it in\r\nhis mind with a little house beyond Lexington Avenue in which\r\nberibboned window curtains and flower-boxes had recently appeared, and\r\nbefore whose newly painted door the canary-coloured brougham of Miss\r\nFanny Ring was frequently seen to wait.\r\n\r\nBeyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed Mrs. Archer\'s\r\nworld lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists, musicians\r\nand "people who wrote."  These scattered fragments of humanity had\r\nnever shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure.  In\r\nspite of odd ways they were said to be, for the most part, quite\r\nrespectable; but they preferred to keep to themselves.  Medora Manson,\r\nin her prosperous days, had inaugurated a "literary salon"; but it had\r\nsoon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it.\r\n\r\nOthers had made the same attempt, and there was a household of\r\nBlenkers--an intense and voluble mother, and three blowsy daughters who\r\nimitated her--where one met Edwin Booth and Patti and William Winter,\r\nand the new Shakespearian actor George Rignold, and some of the\r\nmagazine editors and musical and literary critics.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these\r\npersons.  They were odd, they were uncertain, they had things one\r\ndidn\'t know about in the background of their lives and minds.\r\nLiterature and art were deeply respected in the Archer set, and Mrs.\r\nArcher was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable\r\nand cultivated society had been when it included such figures as\r\nWashington Irving, Fitz-Greene Halleck and the poet of "The Culprit\r\nFay." The most celebrated authors of that generation had been\r\n"gentlemen"; perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had\r\ngentlemanly sentiments, but their origin, their appearance, their hair,\r\ntheir intimacy with the stage and the Opera, made any old New York\r\ncriterion inapplicable to them.\r\n\r\n"When I was a girl," Mrs. Archer used to say, "we knew everybody\r\nbetween the Battery and Canal Street; and only the people one knew had\r\ncarriages.  It was perfectly easy to place any one then; now one can\'t\r\ntell, and I prefer not to try."\r\n\r\nOnly old Catherine Mingott, with her absence of moral prejudices and\r\nalmost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions, might have\r\nbridged the abyss; but she had never opened a book or looked at a\r\npicture, and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala\r\nnights at the Italiens, in the days of her triumph at the Tuileries.\r\nPossibly Beaufort, who was her match in daring, would have succeeded in\r\nbringing about a fusion; but his grand house and silk-stockinged\r\nfootmen were an obstacle to informal sociability.  Moreover, he was as\r\nilliterate as old Mrs. Mingott, and considered "fellows who wrote" as\r\nthe mere paid purveyors of rich men\'s pleasures; and no one rich enough\r\nto influence his opinion had ever questioned it.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer had been aware of these things ever since he could\r\nremember, and had accepted them as part of the structure of his\r\nuniverse.  He knew that there were societies where painters and poets\r\nand novelists and men of science, and even great actors, were as sought\r\nafter as Dukes; he had often pictured to himself what it would have\r\nbeen to live in the intimacy of drawing-rooms dominated by the talk of\r\nMerimee (whose "Lettres a une Inconnue" was one of his inseparables),\r\nof Thackeray, Browning or William Morris.  But such things were\r\ninconceivable in New York, and unsettling to think of.  Archer knew\r\nmost of the "fellows who wrote," the musicians and the painters: he met\r\nthem at the Century, or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that\r\nwere beginning to come into existence.  He enjoyed them there, and was\r\nbored with them at the Blenkers\', where they were mingled with fervid\r\nand dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities; and\r\neven after his most exciting talks with Ned Winsett he always came away\r\nwith the feeling that if his world was small, so was theirs, and that\r\nthe only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where\r\nthey would naturally merge.\r\n\r\nHe was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the\r\nCountess Olenska had lived and suffered, and also--perhaps--tasted\r\nmysterious joys.  He remembered with what amusement she had told him\r\nthat her grandmother Mingott and the Wellands objected to her living in\r\na "Bohemian" quarter given over to "people who wrote."  It was not the\r\nperil but the poverty that her family disliked; but that shade escaped\r\nher, and she supposed they considered literature compromising.\r\n\r\nShe herself had no fears of it, and the books scattered about her\r\ndrawing-room (a part of the house in which books were usually supposed\r\nto be "out of place"), though chiefly works of fiction, had whetted\r\nArcher\'s interest with such new names as those of Paul Bourget,\r\nHuysmans, and the Goncourt brothers.  Ruminating on these things as he\r\napproached her door, he was once more conscious of the curious way in\r\nwhich she reversed his values, and of the need of thinking himself into\r\nconditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be\r\nof use in her present difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nNastasia opened the door, smiling mysteriously.  On the bench in the\r\nhall lay a sable-lined overcoat, a folded opera hat of dull silk with a\r\ngold J. B. on the lining, and a white silk muffler: there was no\r\nmistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of\r\nJulius Beaufort.\r\n\r\nArcher was angry: so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his\r\ncard and going away; then he remembered that in writing to Madame\r\nOlenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he\r\nwished to see her privately.  He had therefore no one but himself to\r\nblame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the\r\ndrawing-room with the dogged determination to make Beaufort feel\r\nhimself in the way, and to outstay him.\r\n\r\nThe banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf, which was draped with\r\nan old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church\r\ncandles of yellowish wax.  He had thrust his chest out, supporting his\r\nshoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large\r\npatent-leather foot.  As Archer entered he was smiling and looking down\r\non his hostess, who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the\r\nchimney.  A table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it, and\r\nagainst the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as\r\ntributes from the Beaufort hot-houses, Madame Olenska sat\r\nhalf-reclined, her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving\r\nthe arm bare to the elbow.\r\n\r\nIt was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were\r\ncalled "simple dinner dresses": a close-fitting armour of whale-boned\r\nsilk, slightly open in the neck, with lace ruffles filling in the\r\ncrack, and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to\r\nshow an Etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band.  But Madame Olenska,\r\nheedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet\r\nbordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur.\r\nArcher remembered, on his last visit to Paris, seeing a portrait by the\r\nnew painter, Carolus Duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the\r\nSalon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with\r\nher chin nestling in fur.  There was something perverse and provocative\r\nin the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing-room, and\r\nin the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect\r\nwas undeniably pleasing.\r\n\r\n"Lord love us--three whole days at Skuytercliff!" Beaufort was saying\r\nin his loud sneering voice as Archer entered.  "You\'d better take all\r\nyour furs, and a hot-water-bottle."\r\n\r\n"Why?  Is the house so cold?" she asked, holding out her left hand to\r\nArcher in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"No; but the missus is," said Beaufort, nodding carelessly to the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"But I thought her so kind.  She came herself to invite me. Granny says\r\nI must certainly go."\r\n\r\n"Granny would, of course.  And I say it\'s a shame you\'re going to miss\r\nthe little oyster supper I\'d planned for you at Delmonico\'s next\r\nSunday, with Campanini and Scalchi and a lot of jolly people."\r\n\r\nShe looked doubtfully from the banker to Archer.\r\n\r\n"Ah--that does tempt me!  Except the other evening at Mrs. Struthers\'s\r\nI\'ve not met a single artist since I\'ve been here."\r\n\r\n"What kind of artists?  I know one or two painters, very good fellows,\r\nthat I could bring to see you if you\'d allow me," said Archer boldly.\r\n\r\n"Painters?  Are there painters in New York?" asked Beaufort, in a tone\r\nimplying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures;\r\nand Madame Olenska said to Archer, with her grave smile:  "That would\r\nbe charming.  But I was really thinking of dramatic artists, singers,\r\nactors, musicians.  My husband\'s house was always full of them."\r\n\r\nShe said the words "my husband" as if no sinister associations were\r\nconnected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the\r\nlost delights of her married life.  Archer looked at her perplexedly,\r\nwondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to\r\ntouch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her\r\nreputation in order to break with it.\r\n\r\n"I do think," she went on, addressing both men, "that the imprevu adds\r\nto one\'s enjoyment.  It\'s perhaps a mistake to see the same people\r\nevery day."\r\n\r\n"It\'s confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,"\r\nBeaufort grumbled.  "And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back\r\non me.  Come--think better of it!  Sunday is your last chance, for\r\nCampanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I\'ve a\r\nprivate room, and a Steinway, and they\'ll sing all night for me."\r\n\r\n"How delicious!  May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\nShe spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice.\r\nBeaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood\r\nstaring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why not now?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too serious a question to decide at this late hour."\r\n\r\n"Do you call it late?"\r\n\r\nShe returned his glance coolly.  "Yes; because I have still to talk\r\nbusiness with Mr. Archer for a little while."\r\n\r\n"Ah," Beaufort snapped.  There was no appeal from her tone, and with a\r\nslight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed\r\nwith a practised air, and calling out from the threshold:  "I say,\r\nNewland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course\r\nyou\'re included in the supper," left the room with his heavy important\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of\r\nhis coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"You know painters, then?  You live in their milieu?" she asked, her\r\neyes full of interest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, not exactly.  I don\'t know that the arts have a milieu here, any\r\nof them; they\'re more like a very thinly settled outskirt."\r\n\r\n"But you care for such things?"\r\n\r\n"Immensely.  When I\'m in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition.  I\r\ntry to keep up."\r\n\r\nShe looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from\r\nher long draperies.\r\n\r\n"I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things.  But\r\nnow I want to try not to."\r\n\r\n"You want to try not to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody\r\nelse here."\r\n\r\nArcher reddened.  "You\'ll never be like everybody else," he said.\r\n\r\nShe raised her straight eyebrows a little.  "Ah, don\'t say that.  If\r\nyou knew how I hate to be different!"\r\n\r\nHer face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask.  She leaned forward,\r\nclasping her knee in her thin hands, and looking away from him into\r\nremote dark distances.\r\n\r\n"I want to get away from it all," she insisted.\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment and cleared his throat.  "I know.  Mr. Letterblair\r\nhas told me."\r\n\r\n"Ah?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the reason I\'ve come.  He asked me to--you see I\'m in the firm."\r\n\r\nShe looked slightly surprised, and then her eyes brightened.  "You mean\r\nyou can manage it for me?  I can talk to you instead of Mr.\r\nLetterblair?  Oh, that will be so much easier!"\r\n\r\nHer tone touched him, and his confidence grew with his\r\nself-satisfaction.  He perceived that she had spoken of business to\r\nBeaufort simply to get rid of him; and to have routed Beaufort was\r\nsomething of a triumph.\r\n\r\n"I am here to talk about it," he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe sat silent, her head still propped by the arm that rested on the\r\nback of the sofa.  Her face looked pale and extinguished, as if dimmed\r\nby the rich red of her dress.  She struck Archer, of a sudden, as a\r\npathetic and even pitiful figure.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re coming to hard facts," he thought, conscious in himself of\r\nthe same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his\r\nmother and her contemporaries.  How little practice he had had in\r\ndealing with unusual situations!  Their very vocabulary was unfamiliar\r\nto him, and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage.  In face of what\r\nwas coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Madame Olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence:  "I\r\nwant to be free; I want to wipe out all the past."\r\n\r\n"I understand that."\r\n\r\nHer face warmed.  "Then you\'ll help me?"\r\n\r\n"First--" he hesitated--"perhaps I ought to know a little more."\r\n\r\nShe seemed surprised.  "You know about my husband--my life with him?"\r\n\r\nHe made a sign of assent.\r\n\r\n"Well--then--what more is there?  In this country are such things\r\ntolerated?  I\'m a Protestant--our church does not forbid divorce in\r\nsuch cases."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\nThey were both silent again, and Archer felt the spectre of Count\r\nOlenski\'s letter grimacing hideously between them.  The letter filled\r\nonly half a page, and was just what he had described it to be in\r\nspeaking of it to Mr. Letterblair: the vague charge of an angry\r\nblackguard.  But how much truth was behind it?  Only Count Olenski\'s\r\nwife could tell.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve looked through the papers you gave to Mr. Letterblair," he said\r\nat length.\r\n\r\n"Well--can there be anything more abominable?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nShe changed her position slightly, screening her eyes with her lifted\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know," Archer continued, "that if your husband chooses\r\nto fight the case--as he threatens to--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--?"\r\n\r\n"He can say things--things that might be unpl--might be disagreeable to\r\nyou: say them publicly, so that they would get about, and harm you even\r\nif--"\r\n\r\n"If--?"\r\n\r\n"I mean: no matter how unfounded they were."\r\n\r\nShe paused for a long interval; so long that, not wishing to keep his\r\neyes on her shaded face, he had time to imprint on his mind the exact\r\nshape of her other hand, the one on her knee, and every detail of the\r\nthree rings on her fourth and fifth fingers; among which, he noticed, a\r\nwedding ring did not appear.\r\n\r\n"What harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nIt was on his lips to exclaim:  "My poor child--far more harm than\r\nanywhere else!"  Instead, he answered, in a voice that sounded in his\r\nears like Mr. Letterblair\'s: "New York society is a very small world\r\ncompared with the one you\'ve lived in.  And it\'s ruled, in spite of\r\nappearances, by a few people with--well, rather old-fashioned ideas."\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, and he continued:  "Our ideas about marriage and\r\ndivorce are particularly old-fashioned.  Our legislation favours\r\ndivorce--our social customs don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Never?"\r\n\r\n"Well--not if the woman, however injured, however irreproachable, has\r\nappearances in the least degree against her, has exposed herself by any\r\nunconventional action to--to offensive insinuations--"\r\n\r\nShe drooped her head a little lower, and he waited again, intensely\r\nhoping for a flash of indignation, or at least a brief cry of denial.\r\nNone came.\r\n\r\nA little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow, and a log\r\nbroke in two and sent up a shower of sparks.  The whole hushed and\r\nbrooding room seemed to be waiting silently with Archer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she murmured at length, "that\'s what my family tell me."\r\n\r\nHe winced a little.  "It\'s not unnatural--"\r\n\r\n"OUR family," she corrected herself; and Archer coloured.  "For you\'ll\r\nbe my cousin soon," she continued gently.\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"And you take their view?"\r\n\r\nHe stood up at this, wandered across the room, stared with void eyes at\r\none of the pictures against the old red damask, and came back\r\nirresolutely to her side.  How could he say:  "Yes, if what your\r\nhusband hints is true, or if you\'ve no way of disproving it?"\r\n\r\n"Sincerely--" she interjected, as he was about to speak.\r\n\r\nHe looked down into the fire.  "Sincerely, then--what should you gain\r\nthat would compensate for the possibility--the certainty--of a lot of\r\nbeastly talk?"\r\n\r\n"But my freedom--is that nothing?"\r\n\r\nIt flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was\r\ntrue, and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt.  How was he\r\nto tell her that, if she really cherished such a plan, the laws of the\r\nState were inexorably opposed to it?  The mere suspicion that the\r\nthought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward\r\nher.  "But aren\'t you as free as air as it is?" he returned.  "Who can\r\ntouch you?  Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been\r\nsettled--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she said indifferently.\r\n\r\n"Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely\r\ndisagreeable and painful?  Think of the newspapers--their vileness!\r\nIt\'s all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can\'t make over society."\r\n\r\n"No," she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he\r\nfelt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.\r\n\r\n"The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is\r\nsupposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention\r\nthat keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are\r\nany," he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his\r\nlips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her\r\nsilence seemed to have laid bare.  Since she would not or could not say\r\nthe one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let\r\nher feel that he was trying to probe into her secret.  Better keep on\r\nthe surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a\r\nwound he could not heal.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my business, you know," he went on, "to help you to see these\r\nthings as the people who are fondest of you see them.  The Mingotts,\r\nthe Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I\r\ndidn\'t show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn\'t be\r\nfair of me, would it?"  He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her\r\nin his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence.\r\n\r\nShe said slowly:  "No; it wouldn\'t be fair."\r\n\r\nThe fire had crumbled down to greyness, and one of the lamps made a\r\ngurgling appeal for attention.  Madame Olenska rose, wound it up and\r\nreturned to the fire, but without resuming her seat.\r\n\r\nHer remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more\r\nfor either of them to say, and Archer stood up also.\r\n\r\n"Very well; I will do what you wish," she said abruptly.  The blood\r\nrushed to his forehead; and, taken aback by the suddenness of her\r\nsurrender, he caught her two hands awkwardly in his.\r\n\r\n"I--I do want to help you," he said.\r\n\r\n"You do help me.  Good night, my cousin."\r\n\r\nHe bent and laid his lips on her hands, which were cold and lifeless.\r\nShe drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat\r\nunder the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter\r\nnight bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nIt was a crowded night at Wallack\'s theatre.\r\n\r\nThe play was "The Shaughraun," with Dion Boucicault in the title role\r\nand Harry Montague and Ada Dyas as the lovers.  The popularity of the\r\nadmirable English company was at its height, and the Shaughraun always\r\npacked the house.  In the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved; in\r\nthe stalls and boxes, people smiled a little at the hackneyed\r\nsentiments and clap-trap situations, and enjoyed the play as much as\r\nthe galleries did.\r\n\r\nThere was one episode, in particular, that held the house from floor to\r\nceiling.  It was that in which Harry Montague, after a sad, almost\r\nmonosyllabic scene of parting with Miss Dyas, bade her good-bye, and\r\nturned to go.  The actress, who was standing near the mantelpiece and\r\nlooking down into the fire, wore a gray cashmere dress without\r\nfashionable loopings or trimmings, moulded to her tall figure and\r\nflowing in long lines about her feet.  Around her neck was a narrow\r\nblack velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back.\r\n\r\nWhen her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the\r\nmantel-shelf and bowed her face in her hands.  On the threshold he\r\npaused to look at her; then he stole back, lifted one of the ends of\r\nvelvet ribbon, kissed it, and left the room without her hearing him or\r\nchanging her attitude.  And on this silent parting the curtain fell.\r\n\r\nIt was always for the sake of that particular scene that Newland Archer\r\nwent to see "The Shaughraun." He thought the adieux of Montague and Ada\r\nDyas as fine as anything he had ever seen Croisette and Bressant do in\r\nParis, or Madge Robertson and Kendal in London; in its reticence, its\r\ndumb sorrow, it moved him more than the most famous histrionic\r\noutpourings.\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy\r\nby reminding him--he could not have said why--of his leave-taking from\r\nMadame Olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier.\r\n\r\nIt would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the\r\ntwo situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned.\r\nNewland Archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young\r\nEnglish actor\'s romantic good looks, and Miss Dyas was a tall\r\nred-haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly\r\nface was utterly unlike Ellen Olenska\'s vivid countenance.  Nor were\r\nArcher and Madame Olenska two lovers parting in heart-broken silence;\r\nthey were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the\r\nlawyer the worst possible impression of the client\'s case.  Wherein,\r\nthen, lay the resemblance that made the young man\'s heart beat with a\r\nkind of retrospective excitement?  It seemed to be in Madame Olenska\'s\r\nmysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities\r\noutside the daily run of experience.  She had hardly ever said a word\r\nto him to produce this impression, but it was a part of her, either a\r\nprojection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something\r\ninherently dramatic, passionate and unusual in herself.  Archer had\r\nalways been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a\r\nsmall part in shaping people\'s lots compared with their innate tendency\r\nto have things happen to them.  This tendency he had felt from the\r\nfirst in Madame Olenska.  The quiet, almost passive young woman struck\r\nhim as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen,\r\nno matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to\r\navoid them.  The exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so\r\nthick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently\r\npassed unperceived.  It was precisely the odd absence of surprise in\r\nher that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very\r\nmaelstrom: the things she took for granted gave the measure of those\r\nshe had rebelled against.\r\n\r\nArcher had left her with the conviction that Count Olenski\'s accusation\r\nwas not unfounded.  The mysterious person who figured in his wife\'s\r\npast as "the secretary" had probably not been unrewarded for his share\r\nin her escape.  The conditions from which she had fled were\r\nintolerable, past speaking of, past believing: she was young, she was\r\nfrightened, she was desperate--what more natural than that she should\r\nbe grateful to her rescuer?  The pity was that her gratitude put her,\r\nin the law\'s eyes and the world\'s, on a par with her abominable\r\nhusband.  Archer had made her understand this, as he was bound to do;\r\nhe had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly New York, on\r\nwhose larger charity she had apparently counted, was precisely the\r\nplace where she could least hope for indulgence.\r\n\r\nTo have to make this fact plain to her--and to witness her resigned\r\nacceptance of it--had been intolerably painful to him.  He felt himself\r\ndrawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity, as if her\r\ndumbly-confessed error had put her at his mercy, humbling yet endearing\r\nher.  He was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret, rather\r\nthan to the cold scrutiny of Mr. Letterblair, or the embarrassed gaze\r\nof her family.  He immediately took it upon himself to assure them both\r\nthat she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce, basing her\r\ndecision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the\r\nproceeding; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes\r\nfrom the "unpleasantness" she had spared them.\r\n\r\n"I was sure Newland would manage it," Mrs. Welland had said proudly of\r\nher future son-in-law; and old Mrs. Mingott, who had summoned him for a\r\nconfidential interview, had congratulated him on his cleverness, and\r\nadded impatiently:  "Silly goose!  I told her myself what nonsense it\r\nwas.  Wanting to pass herself off as Ellen Mingott and an old maid,\r\nwhen she has the luck to be a married woman and a Countess!"\r\n\r\nThese incidents had made the memory of his last talk with Madame\r\nOlenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the\r\nparting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears, and he stood up\r\nto leave the theatre.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, he turned to the side of the house behind him, and saw the\r\nlady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the Beauforts,\r\nLawrence Lefferts and one or two other men.  He had not spoken with her\r\nalone since their evening together, and had tried to avoid being with\r\nher in company; but now their eyes met, and as Mrs. Beaufort recognised\r\nhim at the same time, and made her languid little gesture of\r\ninvitation, it was impossible not to go into the box.\r\n\r\nBeaufort and Lefferts made way for him, and after a few words with Mrs.\r\nBeaufort, who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk,\r\nArcher seated himself behind Madame Olenska.  There was no one else in\r\nthe box but Mr. Sillerton Jackson, who was telling Mrs. Beaufort in a\r\nconfidential undertone about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\'s last Sunday\r\nreception (where some people reported that there had been dancing).\r\nUnder cover of this circumstantial narrative, to which Mrs. Beaufort\r\nlistened with her perfect smile, and her head at just the right angle\r\nto be seen in profile from the stalls, Madame Olenska turned and spoke\r\nin a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," she asked, glancing toward the stage, "he will send her\r\na bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning?"\r\n\r\nArcher reddened, and his heart gave a leap of surprise.  He had called\r\nonly twice on Madame Olenska, and each time he had sent her a box of\r\nyellow roses, and each time without a card.  She had never before made\r\nany allusion to the flowers, and he supposed she had never thought of\r\nhim as the sender.  Now her sudden recognition of the gift, and her\r\nassociating it with the tender leave-taking on the stage, filled him\r\nwith an agitated pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of that too--I was going to leave the theatre in order\r\nto take the picture away with me," he said.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise her colour rose, reluctantly and duskily.  She looked\r\ndown at the mother-of-pearl opera-glass in her smoothly gloved hands,\r\nand said, after a pause: "What do you do while May is away?"\r\n\r\n"I stick to my work," he answered, faintly annoyed by the question.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a long-established habit, the Wellands had left the\r\nprevious week for St. Augustine, where, out of regard for the supposed\r\nsusceptibility of Mr. Welland\'s bronchial tubes, they always spent the\r\nlatter part of the winter.  Mr. Welland was a mild and silent man, with\r\nno opinions but with many habits.  With these habits none might\r\ninterfere; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should\r\nalways go with him on his annual journey to the south.  To preserve an\r\nunbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind; he would not\r\nhave known where his hair-brushes were, or how to provide stamps for\r\nhis letters, if Mrs. Welland had not been there to tell him.\r\n\r\nAs all the members of the family adored each other, and as Mr. Welland\r\nwas the central object of their idolatry, it never occurred to his wife\r\nand May to let him go to St. Augustine alone; and his sons, who were\r\nboth in the law, and could not leave New York during the winter, always\r\njoined him for Easter and travelled back with him.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Archer to discuss the necessity of May\'s\r\naccompanying her father.  The reputation of the Mingotts\' family\r\nphysician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which Mr.\r\nWelland had never had; and his insistence on St. Augustine was\r\ntherefore inflexible.  Originally, it had been intended that May\'s\r\nengagement should not be announced till her return from Florida, and\r\nthe fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to\r\nalter Mr. Welland\'s plans.  Archer would have liked to join the\r\ntravellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his\r\nbetrothed; but he too was bound by custom and conventions.  Little\r\narduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted\r\nof frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a\r\nholiday in mid-winter; and he accepted May\'s departure with the\r\nresignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal\r\nconstituents of married life.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious that Madame Olenska was looking at him under lowered\r\nlids.  "I have done what you wished--what you advised," she said\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"Ah--I\'m glad," he returned, embarrassed by her broaching the subject\r\nat such a moment.\r\n\r\n"I understand--that you were right," she went on a little breathlessly;\r\n"but sometimes life is difficult ...  perplexing..."\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"And I wanted to tell you that I DO feel you were right; and that I\'m\r\ngrateful to you," she ended, lifting her opera-glass quickly to her\r\neyes as the door of the box opened and Beaufort\'s resonant voice broke\r\nin on them.\r\n\r\nArcher stood up, and left the box and the theatre.\r\n\r\nOnly the day before he had received a letter from May Welland in which,\r\nwith characteristic candour, she had asked him to "be kind to Ellen" in\r\ntheir absence.  "She likes you and admires you so much--and you know,\r\nthough she doesn\'t show it, she\'s still very lonely and unhappy.  I\r\ndon\'t think Granny understands her, or uncle Lovell Mingott either;\r\nthey really think she\'s much worldlier and fonder of society than she\r\nis.  And I can quite see that New York must seem dull to her, though\r\nthe family won\'t admit it.  I think she\'s been used to lots of things\r\nwe haven\'t got; wonderful music, and picture shows, and\r\ncelebrities--artists and authors and all the clever people you admire.\r\nGranny can\'t understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and\r\nclothes--but I can see that you\'re almost the only person in New York\r\nwho can talk to her about what she really cares for."\r\n\r\nHis wise May--how he had loved her for that letter!  But he had not\r\nmeant to act on it; he was too busy, to begin with, and he did not\r\ncare, as an engaged man, to play too conspicuously the part of Madame\r\nOlenska\'s champion.  He had an idea that she knew how to take care of\r\nherself a good deal better than the ingenuous May imagined.  She had\r\nBeaufort at her feet, Mr. van der Luyden hovering above her like a\r\nprotecting deity, and any number of candidates (Lawrence Lefferts among\r\nthem) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance.  Yet he never\r\nsaw her, or exchanged a word with her, without feeling that, after all,\r\nMay\'s ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination.  Ellen\r\nOlenska was lonely and she was unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nAs he came out into the lobby Archer ran across his friend Ned Winsett,\r\nthe only one among what Janey called his "clever people" with whom he\r\ncared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of\r\nclub and chop-house banter.\r\n\r\nHe had caught sight, across the house, of Winsett\'s shabby\r\nround-shouldered back, and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the\r\nBeaufort box.  The two men shook hands, and Winsett proposed a bock at\r\na little German restaurant around the corner.  Archer, who was not in\r\nthe mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there, declined\r\non the plea that he had work to do at home; and Winsett said:  "Oh,\r\nwell so have I for that matter, and I\'ll be the Industrious Apprentice\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nThey strolled along together, and presently Winsett said:  "Look here,\r\nwhat I\'m really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of\r\nyours--with the Beauforts, wasn\'t she?  The one your friend Lefferts\r\nseems so smitten by."\r\n\r\nArcher, he could not have said why, was slightly annoyed.  What the\r\ndevil did Ned Winsett want with Ellen Olenska\'s name?  And above all,\r\nwhy did he couple it with Lefferts\'s?  It was unlike Winsett to\r\nmanifest such curiosity; but after all, Archer remembered, he was a\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not for an interview, I hope?" he laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well--not for the press; just for myself," Winsett rejoined.  "The\r\nfact is she\'s a neighbour of mine--queer quarter for such a beauty to\r\nsettle in--and she\'s been awfully kind to my little boy, who fell down\r\nher area chasing his kitten, and gave himself a nasty cut.  She rushed\r\nin bareheaded, carrying him in her arms, with his knee all beautifully\r\nbandaged, and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too\r\ndazzled to ask her name."\r\n\r\nA pleasant glow dilated Archer\'s heart.  There was nothing\r\nextraordinary in the tale: any woman would have done as much for a\r\nneighbour\'s child.  But it was just like Ellen, he felt, to have rushed\r\nin bareheaded, carrying the boy in her arms, and to have dazzled poor\r\nMrs. Winsett into forgetting to ask who she was.\r\n\r\n"That is the Countess Olenska--a granddaughter of old Mrs. Mingott\'s."\r\n\r\n"Whew--a Countess!" whistled Ned Winsett.  "Well, I didn\'t know\r\nCountesses were so neighbourly.  Mingotts ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"They would be, if you\'d let them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well--"  It was their old interminable argument as to the\r\nobstinate unwillingness of the "clever people" to frequent the\r\nfashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," Winsett broke off, "how a Countess happens to live in our\r\nslum?"\r\n\r\n"Because she doesn\'t care a hang about where she lives--or about any of\r\nour little social sign-posts," said Archer, with a secret pride in his\r\nown picture of her.\r\n\r\n"H\'m--been in bigger places, I suppose," the other commented.  "Well,\r\nhere\'s my corner."\r\n\r\nHe slouched off across Broadway, and Archer stood looking after him and\r\nmusing on his last words.\r\n\r\nNed Winsett had those flashes of penetration; they were the most\r\ninteresting thing about him, and always made Archer wonder why they had\r\nallowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are\r\nstill struggling.\r\n\r\nArcher had known that Winsett had a wife and child, but he had never\r\nseen them.  The two men always met at the Century, or at some haunt of\r\njournalists and theatrical people, such as the restaurant where Winsett\r\nhad proposed to go for a bock.  He had given Archer to understand that\r\nhis wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might\r\nmerely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes,\r\nor in both.  Winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social\r\nobservances: Archer, who dressed in the evening because he thought it\r\ncleaner and more comfortable to do so, and who had never stopped to\r\nconsider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in\r\na modest budget, regarded Winsett\'s attitude as part of the boring\r\n"Bohemian" pose that always made fashionable people, who changed their\r\nclothes without talking about it, and were not forever harping on the\r\nnumber of servants one kept, seem so much simpler and less\r\nself-conscious than the others.  Nevertheless, he was always stimulated\r\nby Winsett, and whenever he caught sight of the journalist\'s lean\r\nbearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner\r\nand carry him off for a long talk.\r\n\r\nWinsett was not a journalist by choice.  He was a pure man of letters,\r\nuntimely born in a world that had no need of letters; but after\r\npublishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations, of\r\nwhich one hundred and twenty copies were sold, thirty given away, and\r\nthe balance eventually destroyed by the publishers (as per contract) to\r\nmake room for more marketable material, he had abandoned his real\r\ncalling, and taken a sub-editorial job on a women\'s weekly, where\r\nfashion-plates and paper patterns alternated with New England\r\nlove-stories and advertisements of temperance drinks.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of "Hearth-fires" (as the paper was called) he was\r\ninexhaustibly entertaining; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile\r\nbitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up.  His\r\nconversation always made Archer take the measure of his own life, and\r\nfeel how little it contained; but Winsett\'s, after all, contained still\r\nless, and though their common fund of intellectual interests and\r\ncuriosities made their talks exhilarating, their exchange of views\r\nusually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism.\r\n\r\n"The fact is, life isn\'t much a fit for either of us," Winsett had once\r\nsaid.  "I\'m down and out; nothing to be done about it.  I\'ve got only\r\none ware to produce, and there\'s no market for it here, and won\'t be in\r\nmy time.  But you\'re free and you\'re well-off.  Why don\'t you get into\r\ntouch?  There\'s only one way to do it: to go into politics."\r\n\r\nArcher threw his head back and laughed.  There one saw at a flash the\r\nunbridgeable difference between men like Winsett and the\r\nothers--Archer\'s kind.  Every one in polite circles knew that, in\r\nAmerica, "a gentleman couldn\'t go into politics."  But, since he could\r\nhardly put it in that way to Winsett, he answered evasively: "Look at\r\nthe career of the honest man in American politics!  They don\'t want us."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s \'they\'?  Why don\'t you all get together and be \'they\'\r\nyourselves?"\r\n\r\nArcher\'s laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile.\r\nIt was useless to prolong the discussion: everybody knew the melancholy\r\nfate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal\r\nor state politics in New York.  The day was past when that sort of\r\nthing was possible: the country was in possession of the bosses and the\r\nemigrant, and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture.\r\n\r\n"Culture!  Yes--if we had it!  But there are just a few little local\r\npatches, dying out here and there for lack of--well, hoeing and\r\ncross-fertilising: the last remnants of the old European tradition that\r\nyour forebears brought with them.  But you\'re in a pitiful little\r\nminority: you\'ve got no centre, no competition, no audience.  You\'re\r\nlike the pictures on the walls of a deserted house:  \'The Portrait of a\r\nGentleman.\'  You\'ll never amount to anything, any of you, till you roll\r\nup your sleeves and get right down into the muck.  That, or emigrate\r\n... God!  If I could emigrate ..."\r\n\r\nArcher mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back\r\nto books, where Winsett, if uncertain, was always interesting.\r\nEmigrate!  As if a gentleman could abandon his own country!  One could\r\nno more do that than one could roll up one\'s sleeves and go down into\r\nthe muck.  A gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained.  But you\r\ncouldn\'t make a man like Winsett see that; and that was why the New\r\nYork of literary clubs and exotic restaurants, though a first shake\r\nmade it seem more of a kaleidoscope, turned out, in the end, to be a\r\nsmaller box, with a more monotonous pattern, than the assembled atoms\r\nof Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses.\r\nIn consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived\r\nthat his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was\r\nfilled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.\r\nWhy should he not be, at that moment, on the sands of St. Augustine\r\nwith May Welland?  No one was deceived by his pretense of professional\r\nactivity.  In old-fashioned legal firms like that of which Mr.\r\nLetterblair was the head, and which were mainly engaged in the\r\nmanagement of large estates and "conservative" investments, there were\r\nalways two or three young men, fairly well-off, and without\r\nprofessional ambition, who, for a certain number of hours of each day,\r\nsat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks, or simply reading the\r\nnewspapers.  Though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an\r\noccupation, the crude fact of money-making was still regarded as\r\nderogatory, and the law, being a profession, was accounted a more\r\ngentlemanly pursuit than business.  But none of these young men had\r\nmuch hope of really advancing in his profession, or any earnest desire\r\nto do so; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was\r\nalready perceptibly spreading.\r\n\r\nIt made Archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too.\r\nHe had, to be sure, other tastes and interests; he spent his vacations\r\nin European travel, cultivated the "clever people" May spoke of, and\r\ngenerally tried to "keep up," as he had somewhat wistfully put it to\r\nMadame Olenska.  But once he was married, what would become of this\r\nnarrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?  He had\r\nseen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream, though\r\nperhaps less ardently, and who had gradually sunk into the placid and\r\nluxurious routine of their elders.\r\n\r\nFrom the office he sent a note by messenger to Madame Olenska, asking\r\nif he might call that afternoon, and begging her to let him find a\r\nreply at his club; but at the club he found nothing, nor did he receive\r\nany letter the following day.  This unexpected silence mortified him\r\nbeyond reason, and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of\r\nyellow roses behind a florist\'s window-pane, he left it there.  It was\r\nonly on the third morning that he received a line by post from the\r\nCountess Olenska.  To his surprise it was dated from Skuytercliff,\r\nwhither the van der Luydens had promptly retreated after putting the\r\nDuke on board his steamer.\r\n\r\n"I ran away," the writer began abruptly (without the usual\r\npreliminaries), "the day after I saw you at the play, and these kind\r\nfriends have taken me in.  I wanted to be quiet, and think things over.\r\nYou were right in telling me how kind they were; I feel myself so safe\r\nhere.  I wish that you were with us."  She ended with a conventional\r\n"Yours sincerely," and without any allusion to the date of her return.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the note surprised the young man.  What was Madame Olenska\r\nrunning away from, and why did she feel the need to be safe?  His first\r\nthought was of some dark menace from abroad; then he reflected that he\r\ndid not know her epistolary style, and that it might run to picturesque\r\nexaggeration.  Women always exaggerated; and moreover she was not\r\nwholly at her ease in English, which she often spoke as if she were\r\ntranslating from the French.  "Je me suis evadee--" put in that way,\r\nthe opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have\r\nwanted to escape from a boring round of engagements; which was very\r\nlikely true, for he judged her to be capricious, and easily wearied of\r\nthe pleasure of the moment.\r\n\r\nIt amused him to think of the van der Luydens\' having carried her off\r\nto Skuytercliff on a second visit, and this time for an indefinite\r\nperiod.  The doors of Skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to\r\nvisitors, and a chilly week-end was the most ever offered to the few\r\nthus privileged.  But Archer had seen, on his last visit to Paris, the\r\ndelicious play of Labiche, "Le Voyage de M. Perrichon," and he\r\nremembered M.  Perrichon\'s dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the\r\nyoung man whom he had pulled out of the glacier.  The van der Luydens\r\nhad rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there\r\nwere many other reasons for being attracted to her, Archer knew that\r\nbeneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on\r\nrescuing her.\r\n\r\nHe felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away; and\r\nalmost immediately remembered that, only the day before, he had refused\r\nan invitation to spend the following Sunday with the Reggie Chiverses\r\nat their house on the Hudson, a few miles below Skuytercliff.\r\n\r\nHe had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at Highbank,\r\nwith coasting, ice-boating, sleighing, long tramps in the snow, and a\r\ngeneral flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes.  He had\r\njust received a box of new books from his London book-seller, and had\r\npreferred the prospect of a quiet Sunday at home with his spoils.  But\r\nhe now went into the club writing-room, wrote a hurried telegram, and\r\ntold the servant to send it immediately.  He knew that Mrs. Reggie\r\ndidn\'t object to her visitors\' suddenly changing their minds, and that\r\nthere was always a room to spare in her elastic house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer arrived at the Chiverses\' on Friday evening, and on\r\nSaturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a\r\nweek-end at Highbank.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he had a spin in the ice-boat with his hostess and a few\r\nof the hardier guests; in the afternoon he "went over the farm" with\r\nReggie, and listened, in the elaborately appointed stables, to long and\r\nimpressive disquisitions on the horse; after tea he talked in a corner\r\nof the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself\r\nbroken-hearted when his engagement was announced, but was now eager to\r\ntell him of her own matrimonial hopes; and finally, about midnight, he\r\nassisted in putting a gold-fish in one visitor\'s bed, dressed up a\r\nburglar in the bath-room of a nervous aunt, and saw in the small hours\r\nby joining in a pillow-fight that ranged from the nurseries to the\r\nbasement.  But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove\r\nover to Skuytercliff.\r\n\r\nPeople had always been told that the house at Skuytercliff was an\r\nItalian villa.  Those who had never been to Italy believed it; so did\r\nsome who had.  The house had been built by Mr. van der Luyden in his\r\nyouth, on his return from the "grand tour," and in anticipation of his\r\napproaching marriage with Miss Louisa Dagonet.  It was a large square\r\nwooden structure, with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and\r\nwhite, a Corinthian portico, and fluted pilasters between the windows.\r\nFrom the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by\r\nbalustrades and urns descended in the steel-engraving style to a small\r\nirregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers.\r\nTo the right and left, the famous weedless lawns studded with\r\n"specimen" trees (each of a different variety) rolled away to long\r\nranges of grass crested with elaborate cast-iron ornaments; and below,\r\nin a hollow, lay the four-roomed stone house which the first Patroon\r\nhad built on the land granted him in 1612.\r\n\r\nAgainst the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the\r\nItalian villa loomed up rather grimly; even in summer it kept its\r\ndistance, and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than\r\nthirty feet from its awful front.  Now, as Archer rang the bell, the\r\nlong tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum; and the surprise of the\r\nbutler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he\r\nhad been summoned from his final sleep.\r\n\r\nHappily Archer was of the family, and therefore, irregular though his\r\narrival was, entitled to be informed that the Countess Olenska was out,\r\nhaving driven to afternoon service with Mrs. van der Luyden exactly\r\nthree quarters of an hour earlier.\r\n\r\n"Mr. van der Luyden," the butler continued, "is in, sir; but my\r\nimpression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading\r\nyesterday\'s Evening Post.  I heard him say, sir, on his return from\r\nchurch this morning, that he intended to look through the Evening Post\r\nafter luncheon; if you like, sir, I might go to the library door and\r\nlisten--"\r\n\r\nBut Archer, thanking him, said that he would go and meet the ladies;\r\nand the butler, obviously relieved, closed the door on him majestically.\r\n\r\nA groom took the cutter to the stables, and Archer struck through the\r\npark to the high-road.  The village of Skuytercliff was only a mile and\r\na half away, but he knew that Mrs. van der Luyden never walked, and\r\nthat he must keep to the road to meet the carriage.  Presently,\r\nhowever, coming down a foot-path that crossed the highway, he caught\r\nsight of a slight figure in a red cloak, with a big dog running ahead.\r\nHe hurried forward, and Madame Olenska stopped short with a smile of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'ve come!" she said, and drew her hand from her muff.\r\n\r\nThe red cloak made her look gay and vivid, like the Ellen Mingott of\r\nold days; and he laughed as he took her hand, and answered:  "I came to\r\nsee what you were running away from."\r\n\r\nHer face clouded over, but she answered:  "Ah, well--you will see,\r\npresently."\r\n\r\nThe answer puzzled him.  "Why--do you mean that you\'ve been overtaken?"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like Nastasia\'s, and\r\nrejoined in a lighter tone:  "Shall we walk on?  I\'m so cold after the\r\nsermon.  And what does it matter, now you\'re here to protect me?"\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak.\r\n"Ellen--what is it?  You must tell me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, presently--let\'s run a race first: my feet are freezing to the\r\nground," she cried; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the\r\nsnow, the dog leaping about her with challenging barks.  For a moment\r\nArcher stood watching, his gaze delighted by the flash of the red\r\nmeteor against the snow; then he started after her, and they met,\r\npanting and laughing, at a wicket that led into the park.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him and smiled.  "I knew you\'d come!"\r\n\r\n"That shows you wanted me to," he returned, with a disproportionate joy\r\nin their nonsense.  The white glitter of the trees filled the air with\r\nits own mysterious brightness, and as they walked on over the snow the\r\nground seemed to sing under their feet.\r\n\r\n"Where did you come from?" Madame Olenska asked.\r\n\r\nHe told her, and added:  "It was because I got your note."\r\n\r\nAfter a pause she said, with a just perceptible chill in her voice:\r\n"May asked you to take care of me."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t need any asking."\r\n\r\n"You mean--I\'m so evidently helpless and defenceless?  What a poor\r\nthing you must all think me!  But women here seem not--seem never to\r\nfeel the need: any more than the blessed in heaven."\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice to ask:  "What sort of a need?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t ask me!  I don\'t speak your language," she retorted\r\npetulantly.\r\n\r\nThe answer smote him like a blow, and he stood still in the path,\r\nlooking down at her.\r\n\r\n"What did I come for, if I don\'t speak yours?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my friend--!"  She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he\r\npleaded earnestly:  "Ellen--why won\'t you tell me what\'s happened?"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged again.  "Does anything ever happen in heaven?"\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a\r\nword.  Finally she said:  "I will tell you--but where, where, where?\r\nOne can\'t be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house, with\r\nall the doors wide open, and always a servant bringing tea, or a log\r\nfor the fire, or the newspaper!  Is there nowhere in an American house\r\nwhere one may be by one\'s self?  You\'re so shy, and yet you\'re so\r\npublic.  I always feel as if I were in the convent again--or on the\r\nstage, before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t like us!" Archer exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThey were walking past the house of the old Patroon, with its squat\r\nwalls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central\r\nchimney.  The shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed\r\nwindows Archer caught the light of a fire.\r\n\r\n"Why--the house is open!" he said.\r\n\r\nShe stood still.  "No; only for today, at least.  I wanted to see it,\r\nand Mr. van der Luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened, so that\r\nwe might stop there on the way back from church this morning."  She ran\r\nup the steps and tried the door.  "It\'s still unlocked--what luck!\r\nCome in and we can have a quiet talk.  Mrs. van der Luyden has driven\r\nover to see her old aunts at Rhinebeck and we shan\'t be missed at the\r\nhouse for another hour."\r\n\r\nHe followed her into the narrow passage.  His spirits, which had\r\ndropped at her last words, rose with an irrational leap.  The homely\r\nlittle house stood there, its panels and brasses shining in the\r\nfirelight, as if magically created to receive them.  A big bed of\r\nembers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung\r\nfrom an ancient crane.  Rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other\r\nacross the tiled hearth, and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves\r\nagainst the walls.  Archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska, dropping her cloak, sat down in one of the chairs.\r\nArcher leaned against the chimney and looked at her.\r\n\r\n"You\'re laughing now; but when you wrote me you were unhappy," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes."  She paused.  "But I can\'t feel unhappy when you\'re here."\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t be here long," he rejoined, his lips stiffening with the\r\neffort to say just so much and no more.\r\n\r\n"No; I know.  But I\'m improvident: I live in the moment when I\'m happy."\r\n\r\nThe words stole through him like a temptation, and to close his senses\r\nto it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black\r\ntree-boles against the snow.  But it was as if she too had shifted her\r\nplace, and he still saw her, between himself and the trees, drooping\r\nover the fire with her indolent smile.  Archer\'s heart was beating\r\ninsubordinately.  What if it were from him that she had been running\r\naway, and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone\r\ntogether in this secret room?\r\n\r\n"Ellen, if I\'m really a help to you--if you really wanted me to\r\ncome--tell me what\'s wrong, tell me what it is you\'re running away\r\nfrom," he insisted.\r\n\r\nHe spoke without shifting his position, without even turning to look at\r\nher: if the thing was to happen, it was to happen in this way, with the\r\nwhole width of the room between them, and his eyes still fixed on the\r\nouter snow.\r\n\r\nFor a long moment she was silent; and in that moment Archer imagined\r\nher, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms\r\nabout his neck.  While he waited, soul and body throbbing with the\r\nmiracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a\r\nheavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing\r\nalong the path to the house.  The man was Julius Beaufort.\r\n\r\n"Ah--!" Archer cried, bursting into a laugh.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand\r\ninto his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she\r\nshrank back.\r\n\r\n"So that was it?" Archer said derisively.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know he was here," Madame Olenska murmured.  Her hand still\r\nclung to Archer\'s; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the\r\npassage threw open the door of the house.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Beaufort--this way!  Madame Olenska was expecting you," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his journey back to New York the next morning, Archer relived\r\nwith a fatiguing vividness his last moments at Skuytercliff.\r\n\r\nBeaufort, though clearly annoyed at finding him with Madame Olenska,\r\nhad, as usual, carried off the situation high-handedly.  His way of\r\nignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them,\r\nif they were sensitive to it, a feeling of invisibility, of\r\nnonexistence.  Archer, as the three strolled back through the park, was\r\naware of this odd sense of disembodiment; and humbling as it was to his\r\nvanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved.\r\n\r\nBeaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance;\r\nbut he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes.  It was\r\nfairly clear that Madame Olenska had not known that he was coming,\r\nthough her words to Archer had hinted at the possibility; at any rate,\r\nshe had evidently not told him where she was going when she left New\r\nYork, and her unexplained departure had exasperated him.  The\r\nostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery, the very night\r\nbefore, of a "perfect little house," not in the market, which was\r\nreally just the thing for her, but would be snapped up instantly if she\r\ndidn\'t take it; and he was loud in mock-reproaches for the dance she\r\nhad led him in running away just as he had found it.\r\n\r\n"If only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit\r\nnearer perfection I might have told you all this from town, and been\r\ntoasting my toes before the club fire at this minute, instead of\r\ntramping after you through the snow," he grumbled, disguising a real\r\nirritation under the pretence of it; and at this opening Madame Olenska\r\ntwisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one\r\nday actually converse with each other from street to street, or\r\neven--incredible dream!--from one town to another.  This struck from\r\nall three allusions to Edgar Poe and Jules Verne, and such platitudes\r\nas naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are\r\ntalking against time, and dealing with a new invention in which it\r\nwould seem ingenuous to believe too soon; and the question of the\r\ntelephone carried them safely back to the big house.\r\n\r\nMrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned; and Archer took his leave and\r\nwalked off to fetch the cutter, while Beaufort followed the Countess\r\nOlenska indoors.  It was probable that, little as the van der Luydens\r\nencouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine,\r\nand sent back to the station to catch the nine o\'clock train; but more\r\nthan that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to\r\nhis hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to\r\nspend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with\r\nwhom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort.\r\n\r\nBeaufort knew all this, and must have foreseen it; and his taking the\r\nlong journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience.\r\nHe was undeniably in pursuit of the Countess Olenska; and Beaufort had\r\nonly one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women.  His dull and\r\nchildless home had long since palled on him; and in addition to more\r\npermanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in\r\nhis own set.  This was the man from whom Madame Olenska was avowedly\r\nflying: the question was whether she had fled because his importunities\r\ndispleased her, or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist\r\nthem; unless, indeed, all her talk of flight had been a blind, and her\r\ndeparture no more than a manoeuvre.\r\n\r\nArcher did not really believe this.  Little as he had actually seen of\r\nMadame Olenska, he was beginning to think that he could read her face,\r\nand if not her face, her voice; and both had betrayed annoyance, and\r\neven dismay, at Beaufort\'s sudden appearance.  But, after all, if this\r\nwere the case, was it not worse than if she had left New York for the\r\nexpress purpose of meeting him?  If she had done that, she ceased to be\r\nan object of interest, she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of\r\ndissemblers: a woman engaged in a love affair with Beaufort "classed"\r\nherself irretrievably.\r\n\r\nNo, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably\r\ndespising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an\r\nadvantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and\r\ntwo societies, his familiar association with artists and actors and\r\npeople generally in the world\'s eye, and his careless contempt for\r\nlocal prejudices.  Beaufort was vulgar, he was uneducated, he was\r\npurse-proud; but the circumstances of his life, and a certain native\r\nshrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and\r\nsocially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the\r\nCentral Park.  How should any one coming from a wider world not feel\r\nthe difference and be attracted by it?\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to Archer that he\r\nand she did not talk the same language; and the young man knew that in\r\nsome respects this was true.  But Beaufort understood every turn of her\r\ndialect, and spoke it fluently: his view of life, his tone, his\r\nattitude, were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in Count\r\nOlenski\'s letter.  This might seem to be to his disadvantage with Count\r\nOlenski\'s wife; but Archer was too intelligent to think that a young\r\nwoman like Ellen Olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that\r\nreminded her of her past.  She might believe herself wholly in revolt\r\nagainst it; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her, even\r\nthough it were against her will.\r\n\r\nThus, with a painful impartiality, did the young man make out the case\r\nfor Beaufort, and for Beaufort\'s victim.  A longing to enlighten her\r\nwas strong in him; and there were moments when he imagined that all she\r\nasked was to be enlightened.\r\n\r\nThat evening he unpacked his books from London.  The box was full of\r\nthings he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of Herbert\r\nSpencer, another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet\'s brilliant\r\ntales, and a novel called "Middlemarch," as to which there had lately\r\nbeen interesting things said in the reviews.  He had declined three\r\ndinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the\r\npages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he\r\nwas reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand.\r\nSuddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had\r\nordered because the name had attracted him:  "The House of Life."  He\r\ntook it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he\r\nhad ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably\r\ntender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary\r\nof human passions.  All through the night he pursued through those\r\nenchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen\r\nOlenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the\r\nbrownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in Mr.\r\nLetterblair\'s office, and the family pew in Grace Church, his hour in\r\nthe park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability\r\nas the visions of the night.\r\n\r\n"Mercy, how pale you look, Newland!" Janey commented over the\r\ncoffee-cups at breakfast; and his mother added:  "Newland, dear, I\'ve\r\nnoticed lately that you\'ve been coughing; I do hope you\'re not letting\r\nyourself be overworked?"  For it was the conviction of both ladies\r\nthat, under the iron despotism of his senior partners, the young man\'s\r\nlife was spent in the most exhausting professional labours--and he had\r\nnever thought it necessary to undeceive them.\r\n\r\nThe next two or three days dragged by heavily.  The taste of the usual\r\nwas like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as\r\nif he were being buried alive under his future.  He heard nothing of\r\nthe Countess Olenska, or of the perfect little house, and though he met\r\nBeaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the\r\nwhist-tables.  It was not till the fourth evening that he found a note\r\nawaiting him on his return home.  "Come late tomorrow: I must explain\r\nto you.  Ellen."  These were the only words it contained.\r\n\r\nThe young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket,\r\nsmiling a little at the Frenchness of the "to you."  After dinner he\r\nwent to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight,\r\nthat he drew Madame Olenska\'s missive out again and re-read it slowly a\r\nnumber of times.  There were several ways of answering it, and he gave\r\nconsiderable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated\r\nnight.  That on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to\r\npitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was\r\nleaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nWhen Archer walked down the sandy main street of St. Augustine to the\r\nhouse which had been pointed out to him as Mr. Welland\'s, and saw May\r\nWelland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair, he wondered\r\nwhy he had waited so long to come.\r\n\r\nHere was the truth, here was reality, here was the life that belonged\r\nto him; and he, who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary\r\nrestraints, had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what\r\npeople might think of his stealing a holiday!\r\n\r\nHer first exclamation was:  "Newland--has anything happened?" and it\r\noccurred to him that it would have been more "feminine" if she had\r\ninstantly read in his eyes why he had come.  But when he answered:\r\n"Yes--I found I had to see you," her happy blushes took the chill from\r\nher surprise, and he saw how easily he would be forgiven, and how soon\r\neven Mr. Letterblair\'s mild disapproval would be smiled away by a\r\ntolerant family.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, the main street was no place for any but formal\r\ngreetings, and Archer longed to be alone with May, and to pour out all\r\nhis tenderness and his impatience.  It still lacked an hour to the late\r\nWelland breakfast-time, and instead of asking him to come in she\r\nproposed that they should walk out to an old orange-garden beyond the\r\ntown.  She had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that\r\nnetted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its\r\nmeshes.  Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered\r\nlike silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their\r\nyouthful limpidity.  As she walked beside Archer with her long swinging\r\ngait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete.\r\n\r\nTo Archer\'s strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of\r\nthe blue sky and the lazy river.  They sat down on a bench under the\r\norange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her.  It was like\r\ndrinking at a cold spring with the sun on it; but his pressure may have\r\nbeen more vehement than he had intended, for the blood rose to her face\r\nand she drew back as if he had startled her.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked, smiling; and she looked at him with surprise,\r\nand answered:  "Nothing."\r\n\r\nA slight embarrassment fell on them, and her hand slipped out of his.\r\nIt was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for\r\ntheir fugitive embrace in the Beaufort conservatory, and he saw that\r\nshe was disturbed, and shaken out of her cool boyish composure.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you do all day," he said, crossing his arms under his\r\ntilted-back head, and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun-dazzle.\r\nTo let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of\r\ncarrying on his own independent train of thought; and he sat listening\r\nto her simple chronicle of swimming, sailing and riding, varied by an\r\noccasional dance at the primitive inn when a man-of-war came in.  A few\r\npleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore were picknicking at the\r\ninn, and the Selfridge Merrys had come down for three weeks because\r\nKate Merry had had bronchitis.  They were planning to lay out a lawn\r\ntennis court on the sands; but no one but Kate and May had racquets,\r\nand most of the people had not even heard of the game.\r\n\r\nAll this kept her very busy, and she had not had time to do more than\r\nlook at the little vellum book that Archer had sent her the week before\r\n(the "Sonnets from the Portuguese"); but she was learning by heart "How\r\nthey brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix," because it was one of\r\nthe first things he had ever read to her; and it amused her to be able\r\nto tell him that Kate Merry had never even heard of a poet called\r\nRobert Browning.\r\n\r\nPresently she started up, exclaiming that they would be late for\r\nbreakfast; and they hurried back to the tumble-down house with its\r\npointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where\r\nthe Wellands were installed for the winter.  Mr. Welland\'s sensitive\r\ndomesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel,\r\nand at immense expense, and in face of almost insuperable difficulties,\r\nMrs. Welland was obliged, year after year, to improvise an\r\nestablishment partly made up of discontented New York servants and\r\npartly drawn from the local African supply.\r\n\r\n"The doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home;\r\notherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any\r\ngood," she explained, winter after winter, to the sympathising\r\nPhiladelphians and Baltimoreans; and Mr. Welland, beaming across a\r\nbreakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies,\r\nwas presently saying to Archer: "You see, my dear fellow, we camp--we\r\nliterally camp.  I tell my wife and May that I want to teach them how\r\nto rough it."\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by\r\nthe young man\'s sudden arrival; but it had occurred to him to explain\r\nthat he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold, and this seemed\r\nto Mr. Welland an all-sufficient reason for abandoning any duty.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be too careful, especially toward spring," he said, heaping\r\nhis plate with straw-coloured griddle-cakes and drowning them in golden\r\nsyrup.  "If I\'d only been as prudent at your age May would have been\r\ndancing at the Assemblies now, instead of spending her winters in a\r\nwilderness with an old invalid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I love it here, Papa; you know I do.  If only Newland could\r\nstay I should like it a thousand times better than New York."\r\n\r\n"Newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold," said Mrs.\r\nWelland indulgently; and the young man laughed, and said he supposed\r\nthere was such a thing as one\'s profession.\r\n\r\nHe managed, however, after an exchange of telegrams with the firm, to\r\nmake his cold last a week; and it shed an ironic light on the situation\r\nto know that Mr. Letterblair\'s indulgence was partly due to the\r\nsatisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had\r\nsettled the troublesome matter of the Olenski divorce.  Mr. Letterblair\r\nhad let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had "rendered an invaluable\r\nservice" to the whole family, and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been\r\nparticularly pleased; and one day when May had gone for a drive with\r\nher father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took\r\noccasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter\'s\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Ellen\'s ideas are not at all like ours.  She was barely\r\neighteen when Medora Manson took her back to Europe--you remember the\r\nexcitement when she appeared in black at her coming-out ball?  Another\r\nof Medora\'s fads--really this time it was almost prophetic!  That must\r\nhave been at least twelve years ago; and since then Ellen has never\r\nbeen to America.  No wonder she is completely Europeanised."\r\n\r\n"But European society is not given to divorce: Countess Olenska thought\r\nshe would be conforming to American ideas in asking for her freedom."\r\nIt was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since\r\nhe had left Skuytercliff, and he felt the colour rise to his cheek.\r\n\r\nMrs. Welland smiled compassionately.  "That is just like the\r\nextraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. They think we\r\ndine at two o\'clock and countenance divorce!  That is why it seems to\r\nme so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York.  They\r\naccept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same\r\nstupid stories."\r\n\r\nArcher made no comment on this, and Mrs. Welland continued:  "But we do\r\nmost thoroughly appreciate your persuading Ellen to give up the idea.\r\nHer grandmother and her uncle Lovell could do nothing with her; both of\r\nthem have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your\r\ninfluence--in fact she said so to her grandmother.  She has an\r\nunbounded admiration for you.  Poor Ellen--she was always a wayward\r\nchild.  I wonder what her fate will be?"\r\n\r\n"What we\'ve all contrived to make it," he felt like answering.  "If\r\nyou\'d all of you rather she should be Beaufort\'s mistress than some\r\ndecent fellow\'s wife you\'ve certainly gone the right way about it."\r\n\r\nHe wondered what Mrs. Welland would have said if he had uttered the\r\nwords instead of merely thinking them.  He could picture the sudden\r\ndecomposure of her firm placid features, to which a lifelong mastery\r\nover trifles had given an air of factitious authority.  Traces still\r\nlingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter\'s; and he asked\r\nhimself if May\'s face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged\r\nimage of invincible innocence.\r\n\r\nAh, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the\r\ninnocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against\r\nexperience!\r\n\r\n"I verily believe," Mrs. Welland continued, "that if the horrible\r\nbusiness had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband\'s\r\ndeath-blow.  I don\'t know any of the details; I only ask not to, as I\r\ntold poor Ellen when she tried to talk to me about it.  Having an\r\ninvalid to care for, I have to keep my mind bright and happy.  But Mr.\r\nWelland was terribly upset; he had a slight temperature every morning\r\nwhile we were waiting to hear what had been decided.  It was the horror\r\nof his girl\'s learning that such things were possible--but of course,\r\ndear Newland, you felt that too.  We all knew that you were thinking of\r\nMay."\r\n\r\n"I\'m always thinking of May," the young man rejoined, rising to cut\r\nshort the conversation.\r\n\r\nHe had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with Mrs.\r\nWelland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage.  But he could\r\nthink of no arguments that would move her, and with a sense of relief\r\nhe saw Mr. Welland and May driving up to the door.\r\n\r\nHis only hope was to plead again with May, and on the day before his\r\ndeparture he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the Spanish\r\nMission.  The background lent itself to allusions to European scenes;\r\nand May, who was looking her loveliest under a wide-brimmed hat that\r\ncast a shadow of mystery over her too-clear eyes, kindled into\r\neagerness as he spoke of Granada and the Alhambra.\r\n\r\n"We might be seeing it all this spring--even the Easter ceremonies at\r\nSeville," he urged, exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\n"Easter in Seville?  And it will be Lent next week!" she laughed.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t we be married in Lent?" he rejoined; but she looked so\r\nshocked that he saw his mistake.\r\n\r\n"Of course I didn\'t mean that, dearest; but soon after Easter--so that\r\nwe could sail at the end of April.  I know I could arrange it at the\r\noffice."\r\n\r\nShe smiled dreamily upon the possibility; but he perceived that to\r\ndream of it sufficed her.  It was like hearing him read aloud out of\r\nhis poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in\r\nreal life.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do go on, Newland; I do love your descriptions."\r\n\r\n"But why should they be only descriptions?  Why shouldn\'t we make them\r\nreal?"\r\n\r\n"We shall, dearest, of course; next year."  Her voice lingered over it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want them to be real sooner?  Can\'t I persuade you to break\r\naway now?"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head, vanishing from him under her conniving hat-brim.\r\n\r\n"Why should we dream away another year?  Look at me, dear!  Don\'t you\r\nunderstand how I want you for my wife?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she remained motionless; then she raised on him eyes of\r\nsuch despairing dearness that he half-released her waist from his hold.\r\nBut suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably.  "I\'m not sure\r\nif I DO understand," she said.  "Is it--is it because you\'re not\r\ncertain of continuing to care for me?"\r\n\r\nArcher sprang up from his seat.  "My God--perhaps--I don\'t know," he\r\nbroke out angrily.\r\n\r\nMay Welland rose also; as they faced each other she seemed to grow in\r\nwomanly stature and dignity.  Both were silent for a moment, as if\r\ndismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words: then she said in a low\r\nvoice: "If that is it--is there some one else?"\r\n\r\n"Some one else--between you and me?"  He echoed her words slowly, as\r\nthough they were only half-intelligible and he wanted time to repeat\r\nthe question to himself.  She seemed to catch the uncertainty of his\r\nvoice, for she went on in a deepening tone:  "Let us talk frankly,\r\nNewland.  Sometimes I\'ve felt a difference in you; especially since our\r\nengagement has been announced."\r\n\r\n"Dear--what madness!" he recovered himself to exclaim.\r\n\r\nShe met his protest with a faint smile.  "If it is, it won\'t hurt us to\r\ntalk about it."  She paused, and added, lifting her head with one of\r\nher noble movements:  "Or even if it\'s true: why shouldn\'t we speak of\r\nit?  You might so easily have made a mistake."\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head, staring at the black leaf-pattern on the sunny\r\npath at their feet.  "Mistakes are always easy to make; but if I had\r\nmade one of the kind you suggest, is it likely that I should be\r\nimploring you to hasten our marriage?"\r\n\r\nShe looked downward too, disturbing the pattern with the point of her\r\nsunshade while she struggled for expression.  "Yes," she said at\r\nlength.  "You might want--once for all--to settle the question: it\'s\r\none way."\r\n\r\nHer quiet lucidity startled him, but did not mislead him into thinking\r\nher insensible.  Under her hat-brim he saw the pallor of her profile,\r\nand a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips.\r\n\r\n"Well--?" he questioned, sitting down on the bench, and looking up at\r\nher with a frown that he tried to make playful.\r\n\r\nShe dropped back into her seat and went on:  "You mustn\'t think that a\r\ngirl knows as little as her parents imagine.  One hears and one\r\nnotices--one has one\'s feelings and ideas.  And of course, long before\r\nyou told me that you cared for me, I\'d known that there was some one\r\nelse you were interested in; every one was talking about it two years\r\nago at Newport.  And once I saw you sitting together on the verandah at\r\na dance--and when she came back into the house her face was sad, and I\r\nfelt sorry for her; I remembered it afterward, when we were engaged."\r\n\r\nHer voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she sat clasping and\r\nunclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade.  The young man\r\nlaid his upon them with a gentle pressure; his heart dilated with an\r\ninexpressible relief.\r\n\r\n"My dear child--was THAT it?  If you only knew the truth!"\r\n\r\nShe raised her head quickly.  "Then there is a truth I don\'t know?"\r\n\r\nHe kept his hand over hers.  "I meant, the truth about the old story\r\nyou speak of."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s what I want to know, Newland--what I ought to know.  I\r\ncouldn\'t have my happiness made out of a wrong--an unfairness--to\r\nsomebody else.  And I want to believe that it would be the same with\r\nyou.  What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?"\r\n\r\nHer face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like\r\nbowing himself down at her feet.  "I\'ve wanted to say this for a long\r\ntime," she went on.  "I\'ve wanted to tell you that, when two people\r\nreally love each other, I understand that there may be situations which\r\nmake it right that they should--should go against public opinion.  And\r\nif you feel yourself in any way pledged ... pledged to the person we\'ve\r\nspoken of ...  and if there is any way ... any way in which you can\r\nfulfill your pledge ... even by her getting a divorce ...  Newland,\r\ndon\'t give her up because of me!"\r\n\r\nHis surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode\r\nso remote and so completely of the past as his love-affair with Mrs.\r\nThorley Rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view.\r\nThere was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox,\r\nand if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in\r\nwonder at the prodigy of the Wellands\' daughter urging him to marry his\r\nformer mistress.  But he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the\r\nprecipice they had skirted, and full of a new awe at the mystery of\r\nyoung-girlhood.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he could not speak; then he said: "There is no pledge--no\r\nobligation whatever--of the kind you think.  Such cases don\'t\r\nalways--present themselves quite as simply as ... But that\'s no matter\r\n... I love your generosity, because I feel as you do about those things\r\n... I feel that each case must be judged individually, on its own\r\nmerits ... irrespective of stupid conventionalities ... I mean, each\r\nwoman\'s right to her liberty--"  He pulled himself up, startled by the\r\nturn his thoughts had taken, and went on, looking at her with a smile:\r\n"Since you understand so many things, dearest, can\'t you go a little\r\nfarther, and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another\r\nform of the same foolish conventionalities?  If there\'s no one and\r\nnothing between us, isn\'t that an argument for marrying quickly, rather\r\nthan for more delay?"\r\n\r\nShe flushed with joy and lifted her face to his; as he bent to it he\r\nsaw that her eyes were full of happy tears.  But in another moment she\r\nseemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and\r\ntimorous girlhood; and he understood that her courage and initiative\r\nwere all for others, and that she had none for herself.  It was evident\r\nthat the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied\r\ncomposure betrayed, and that at his first word of reassurance she had\r\ndropped back into the usual, as a too-adventurous child takes refuge in\r\nits mother\'s arms.\r\n\r\nArcher had no heart to go on pleading with her; he was too much\r\ndisappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one\r\ndeep look at him from her transparent eyes.  May seemed to be aware of\r\nhis disappointment, but without knowing how to alleviate it; and they\r\nstood up and walked silently home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n"Your cousin the Countess called on mother while you were away," Janey\r\nArcher announced to her brother on the evening of his return.\r\n\r\nThe young man, who was dining alone with his mother and sister, glanced\r\nup in surprise and saw Mrs. Archer\'s gaze demurely bent on her plate.\r\nMrs. Archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for\r\nbeing forgotten by it; and Newland guessed that she was slightly\r\nannoyed that he should be surprised by Madame Olenska\'s visit.\r\n\r\n"She had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons, and a tiny green\r\nmonkey muff; I never saw her so stylishly dressed," Janey continued.\r\n"She came alone, early on Sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in\r\nthe drawing-room.  She had one of those new card-cases.  She said she\r\nwanted to know us because you\'d been so good to her."\r\n\r\nNewland laughed.  "Madame Olenska always takes that tone about her\r\nfriends.  She\'s very happy at being among her own people again."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so she told us," said Mrs. Archer.  "I must say she seems\r\nthankful to be here."\r\n\r\n"I hope you liked her, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer drew her lips together.  "She certainly lays herself out to\r\nplease, even when she is calling on an old lady."\r\n\r\n"Mother doesn\'t think her simple," Janey interjected, her eyes screwed\r\nupon her brother\'s face.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just my old-fashioned feeling; dear May is my ideal," said Mrs.\r\nArcher.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said her son, "they\'re not alike."\r\n\r\n\r\nArcher had left St. Augustine charged with many messages for old Mrs.\r\nMingott; and a day or two after his return to town he called on her.\r\n\r\nThe old lady received him with unusual warmth; she was grateful to him\r\nfor persuading the Countess Olenska to give up the idea of a divorce;\r\nand when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave, and\r\nrushed down to St. Augustine simply because he wanted to see May, she\r\ngave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puff-ball hand.\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah--so you kicked over the traces, did you?  And I suppose Augusta\r\nand Welland pulled long faces, and behaved as if the end of the world\r\nhad come?  But little May--she knew better, I\'ll be bound?"\r\n\r\n"I hoped she did; but after all she wouldn\'t agree to what I\'d gone\r\ndown to ask for."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t she indeed?  And what was that?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in April.\r\nWhat\'s the use of our wasting another year?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Manson Mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic\r\nprudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids.  "\'Ask Mamma,\' I\r\nsuppose--the usual story.  Ah, these Mingotts--all alike!  Born in a\r\nrut, and you can\'t root \'em out of it.  When I built this house you\'d\r\nhave thought I was moving to California!  Nobody ever HAD built above\r\nFortieth Street--no, says I, nor above the Battery either, before\r\nChristopher Columbus discovered America.  No, no; not one of them wants\r\nto be different; they\'re as scared of it as the small-pox.  Ah, my dear\r\nMr. Archer, I thank my stars I\'m nothing but a vulgar Spicer; but\r\nthere\'s not one of my own children that takes after me but my little\r\nEllen."  She broke off, still twinkling at him, and asked, with the\r\ncasual irrelevance of old age:  "Now, why in the world didn\'t you marry\r\nmy little Ellen?"\r\n\r\nArcher laughed.  "For one thing, she wasn\'t there to be married."\r\n\r\n"No--to be sure; more\'s the pity.  And now it\'s too late; her life is\r\nfinished."  She spoke with the cold-blooded complacency of the aged\r\nthrowing earth into the grave of young hopes.  The young man\'s heart\r\ngrew chill, and he said hurriedly:  "Can\'t I persuade you to use your\r\ninfluence with the Wellands, Mrs. Mingott?  I wasn\'t made for long\r\nengagements."\r\n\r\nOld Catherine beamed on him approvingly.  "No; I can see that.  You\'ve\r\ngot a quick eye.  When you were a little boy I\'ve no doubt you liked to\r\nbe helped first." She threw back her head with a laugh that made her\r\nchins ripple like little waves.  "Ah, here\'s my Ellen now!" she\r\nexclaimed, as the portieres parted behind her.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska came forward with a smile.  Her face looked vivid and\r\nhappy, and she held out her hand gaily to Archer while she stooped to\r\nher grandmother\'s kiss.\r\n\r\n"I was just saying to him, my dear:  \'Now, why didn\'t you marry my\r\nlittle Ellen?\'"\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska looked at Archer, still smiling.  "And what did he\r\nanswer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling, I leave you to find that out!  He\'s been down to\r\nFlorida to see his sweetheart."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know."  She still looked at him.  "I went to see your mother,\r\nto ask where you\'d gone.  I sent a note that you never answered, and I\r\nwas afraid you were ill."\r\n\r\nHe muttered something about leaving unexpectedly, in a great hurry, and\r\nhaving intended to write to her from St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n"And of course once you were there you never thought of me again!"  She\r\ncontinued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied\r\nassumption of indifference.\r\n\r\n"If she still needs me, she\'s determined not to let me see it," he\r\nthought, stung by her manner.  He wanted to thank her for having been\r\nto see his mother, but under the ancestress\'s malicious eye he felt\r\nhimself tongue-tied and constrained.\r\n\r\n"Look at him--in such hot haste to get married that he took French\r\nleave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees!  That\'s\r\nsomething like a lover--that\'s the way handsome Bob Spicer carried off\r\nmy poor mother; and then got tired of her before I was weaned--though\r\nthey only had to wait eight months for me!  But there--you\'re not a\r\nSpicer, young man; luckily for you and for May.  It\'s only my poor\r\nEllen that has kept any of their wicked blood; the rest of them are all\r\nmodel Mingotts," cried the old lady scornfully.\r\n\r\nArcher was aware that Madame Olenska, who had seated herself at her\r\ngrandmother\'s side, was still thoughtfully scrutinising him.  The\r\ngaiety had faded from her eyes, and she said with great gentleness:\r\n"Surely, Granny, we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes."\r\n\r\nArcher rose to go, and as his hand met Madame Olenska\'s he felt that\r\nshe was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter.\r\n\r\n"When can I see you?" he asked, as she walked with him to the door of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Whenever you like; but it must be soon if you want to see the little\r\nhouse again.  I am moving next week."\r\n\r\nA pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the\r\nlow-studded drawing-room.  Few as they had been, they were thick with\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow evening?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.  "Tomorrow; yes; but early.  I\'m going out."\r\n\r\nThe next day was a Sunday, and if she were "going out" on a Sunday\r\nevening it could, of course, be only to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\'s.  He\r\nfelt a slight movement of annoyance, not so much at her going there\r\n(for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van\r\nder Luydens), but because it was the kind of house at which she was\r\nsure to meet Beaufort, where she must have known beforehand that she\r\nwould meet him--and where she was probably going for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"Very well; tomorrow evening," he repeated, inwardly resolved that he\r\nwould not go early, and that by reaching her door late he would either\r\nprevent her from going to Mrs. Struthers\'s, or else arrive after she\r\nhad started--which, all things considered, would no doubt be the\r\nsimplest solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only half-past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the\r\nwisteria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour--but a\r\nsingular restlessness had driven him to her door.  He reflected,\r\nhowever, that Mrs. Struthers\'s Sunday evenings were not like a ball,\r\nand that her guests, as if to minimise their delinquency, usually went\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nThe one thing he had not counted on, in entering Madame Olenska\'s hall,\r\nwas to find hats and overcoats there.  Why had she bidden him to come\r\nearly if she was having people to dine?  On a closer inspection of the\r\ngarments besides which Nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave\r\nway to curiosity.  The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had\r\never seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure\r\nhimself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort.  One was a\r\nshaggy yellow ulster of "reach-me-down" cut, the other a very old and\r\nrusty cloak with a cape--something like what the French called a\r\n"Macfarlane." This garment, which appeared to be made for a person of\r\nprodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its\r\ngreenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of\r\nprolonged sessions against bar-room walls.  On it lay a ragged grey\r\nscarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape.\r\n\r\nArcher raised his eyebrows enquiringly at Nastasia, who raised hers in\r\nreturn with a fatalistic "Gia!" as she threw open the drawing-room door.\r\n\r\nThe young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room; then,\r\nwith surprise, he discovered another lady standing by the fire.  This\r\nlady, who was long, lean and loosely put together, was clad in raiment\r\nintricately looped and fringed, with plaids and stripes and bands of\r\nplain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing.\r\nHer hair, which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading,\r\nwas surmounted by a Spanish comb and black lace scarf, and silk\r\nmittens, visibly darned, covered her rheumatic hands.\r\n\r\nBeside her, in a cloud of cigar-smoke, stood the owners of the two\r\novercoats, both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken\r\noff since morning.  In one of the two, Archer, to his surprise,\r\nrecognised Ned Winsett; the other and older, who was unknown to him,\r\nand whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the\r\n"Macfarlane," had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair, and\r\nmoved his arms with large pawing gestures, as though he were\r\ndistributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude.\r\n\r\nThese three persons stood together on the hearth-rug, their eyes fixed\r\non an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses, with a knot of\r\npurple pansies at their base, that lay on the sofa where Madame Olenska\r\nusually sat.\r\n\r\n"What they must have cost at this season--though of course it\'s the\r\nsentiment one cares about!" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato\r\nas Archer came in.\r\n\r\nThe three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady,\r\nadvancing, held out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Archer--almost my cousin Newland!" she said.  "I am the\r\nMarchioness Manson."\r\n\r\nArcher bowed, and she continued:  "My Ellen has taken me in for a few\r\ndays.  I came from Cuba, where I have been spending the winter with\r\nSpanish friends--such delightful distinguished people: the highest\r\nnobility of old Castile--how I wish you could know them!  But I was\r\ncalled away by our dear great friend here, Dr. Carver.  You don\'t know\r\nDr. Agathon Carver, founder of the Valley of Love Community?"\r\n\r\nDr. Carver inclined his leonine head, and the Marchioness continued:\r\n"Ah, New York--New York--how little the life of the spirit has reached\r\nit!  But I see you do know Mr. Winsett."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--I reached him some time ago; but not by that route," Winsett\r\nsaid with his dry smile.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness shook her head reprovingly.  "How do you know, Mr.\r\nWinsett?  The spirit bloweth where it listeth."\r\n\r\n"List--oh, list!" interjected Dr. Carver in a stentorian murmur.\r\n\r\n"But do sit down, Mr. Archer.  We four have been having a delightful\r\nlittle dinner together, and my child has gone up to dress.  She expects\r\nyou; she will be down in a moment.  We were just admiring these\r\nmarvellous flowers, which will surprise her when she reappears."\r\n\r\nWinsett remained on his feet.  "I\'m afraid I must be off.  Please tell\r\nMadame Olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our\r\nstreet.  This house has been an oasis."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but she won\'t abandon YOU.  Poetry and art are the breath of life\r\nto her.  It IS poetry you write, Mr. Winsett?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; but I sometimes read it," said Winsett, including the group\r\nin a general nod and slipping out of the room.\r\n\r\n"A caustic spirit--un peu sauvage.  But so witty; Dr. Carver, you DO\r\nthink him witty?"\r\n\r\n"I never think of wit," said Dr. Carver severely.\r\n\r\n"Ah--ah--you never think of wit!  How merciless he is to us weak\r\nmortals, Mr. Archer!  But he lives only in the life of the spirit; and\r\ntonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently\r\nat Mrs. Blenker\'s.  Dr. Carver, would there be time, before you start\r\nfor the Blenkers\' to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery\r\nof the Direct Contact?  But no; I see it is nearly nine o\'clock, and we\r\nhave no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message."\r\n\r\nDr. Carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion, but, having\r\ncompared his ponderous gold time-piece with Madame Olenska\'s little\r\ntravelling-clock, he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n"I shall see you later, dear friend?" he suggested to the Marchioness,\r\nwho replied with a smile:  "As soon as Ellen\'s carriage comes I will\r\njoin you; I do hope the lecture won\'t have begun."\r\n\r\nDr. Carver looked thoughtfully at Archer.  "Perhaps, if this young\r\ngentleman is interested in my experiences, Mrs. Blenker might allow you\r\nto bring him with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear friend, if it were possible--I am sure she would be too\r\nhappy.  But I fear my Ellen counts on Mr. Archer herself."\r\n\r\n"That," said Dr. Carver, "is unfortunate--but here is my card."  He\r\nhanded it to Archer, who read on it, in Gothic characters:\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+\r\n  |      Agathon Carver       |\r\n  |    The Valley of Love     |\r\n  |   Kittasquattamy, N. Y.   |\r\n  +---------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Carver bowed himself out, and Mrs. Manson, with a sigh that might\r\nhave been either of regret or relief, again waved Archer to a seat.\r\n\r\n"Ellen will be down in a moment; and before she comes, I am so glad of\r\nthis quiet moment with you."\r\n\r\nArcher murmured his pleasure at their meeting, and the Marchioness\r\ncontinued, in her low sighing accents: "I know everything, dear Mr.\r\nArcher--my child has told me all you have done for her.  Your wise\r\nadvice: your courageous firmness--thank heaven it was not too late!"\r\n\r\nThe young man listened with considerable embarrassment.  Was there any\r\none, he wondered, to whom Madame Olenska had not proclaimed his\r\nintervention in her private affairs?\r\n\r\n"Madame Olenska exaggerates; I simply gave her a legal opinion, as she\r\nasked me to."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but in doing it--in doing it you were the unconscious instrument\r\nof--of--what word have we moderns for Providence, Mr. Archer?" cried\r\nthe lady, tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids\r\nmysteriously.  "Little did you know that at that very moment I was\r\nbeing appealed to: being approached, in fact--from the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic!"\r\n\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder, as though fearful of being overheard,\r\nand then, drawing her chair nearer, and raising a tiny ivory fan to her\r\nlips, breathed behind it:  "By the Count himself--my poor, mad, foolish\r\nOlenski; who asks only to take her back on her own terms."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" Archer exclaimed, springing up.\r\n\r\n"You are horrified?  Yes, of course; I understand.  I don\'t defend poor\r\nStanislas, though he has always called me his best friend.  He does not\r\ndefend himself--he casts himself at her feet: in my person."  She\r\ntapped her emaciated bosom.  "I have his letter here."\r\n\r\n"A letter?--Has Madame Olenska seen it?" Archer stammered, his brain\r\nwhirling with the shock of the announcement.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness Manson shook her head softly.  "Time--time; I must have\r\ntime.  I know my Ellen--haughty, intractable; shall I say, just a shade\r\nunforgiving?"\r\n\r\n"But, good heavens, to forgive is one thing; to go back into that\r\nhell--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," the Marchioness acquiesced.  "So she describes it--my\r\nsensitive child!  But on the material side, Mr. Archer, if one may\r\nstoop to consider such things; do you know what she is giving up?\r\nThose roses there on the sofa--acres like them, under glass and in the\r\nopen, in his matchless terraced gardens at Nice!  Jewels--historic\r\npearls: the Sobieski emeralds--sables,--but she cares nothing for all\r\nthese!  Art and beauty, those she does care for, she lives for, as I\r\nalways have; and those also surrounded her.  Pictures, priceless\r\nfurniture, music, brilliant conversation--ah, that, my dear young man,\r\nif you\'ll excuse me, is what you\'ve no conception of here!  And she had\r\nit all; and the homage of the greatest.  She tells me she is not\r\nthought handsome in New York--good heavens!  Her portrait has been\r\npainted nine times; the greatest artists in Europe have begged for the\r\nprivilege.  Are these things nothing?  And the remorse of an adoring\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\nAs the Marchioness Manson rose to her climax her face assumed an\r\nexpression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved Archer\'s\r\nmirth had he not been numb with amazement.\r\n\r\nHe would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first\r\nsight of poor Medora Manson would have been in the guise of a messenger\r\nof Satan; but he was in no mood for laughing now, and she seemed to him\r\nto come straight out of the hell from which Ellen Olenska had just\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n"She knows nothing yet--of all this?" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Manson laid a purple finger on her lips.  "Nothing directly--but\r\ndoes she suspect?  Who can tell?  The truth is, Mr. Archer, I have been\r\nwaiting to see you.  From the moment I heard of the firm stand you had\r\ntaken, and of your influence over her, I hoped it might be possible to\r\ncount on your support--to convince you ..."\r\n\r\n"That she ought to go back?  I would rather see her dead!" cried the\r\nyoung man violently.\r\n\r\n"Ah," the Marchioness murmured, without visible resentment.  For a\r\nwhile she sat in her arm-chair, opening and shutting the absurd ivory\r\nfan between her mittened fingers; but suddenly she lifted her head and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n"Here she comes," she said in a rapid whisper; and then, pointing to\r\nthe bouquet on the sofa:  "Am I to understand that you prefer THAT, Mr.\r\nArcher?  After all, marriage is marriage ... and my niece is still a\r\nwife..."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n"What are you two plotting together, aunt Medora?" Madame Olenska cried\r\nas she came into the room.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed as if for a ball.  Everything about her shimmered and\r\nglimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams;\r\nand she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a\r\nroomful of rivals.\r\n\r\n"We were saying, my dear, that here was something beautiful to surprise\r\nyou with," Mrs. Manson rejoined, rising to her feet and pointing archly\r\nto the flowers.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet.  Her colour did\r\nnot change, but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like\r\nsummer lightning.  "Ah," she exclaimed, in a shrill voice that the\r\nyoung man had never heard, "who is ridiculous enough to send me a\r\nbouquet?  Why a bouquet?  And why tonight of all nights?  I am not\r\ngoing to a ball; I am not a girl engaged to be married.  But some\r\npeople are always ridiculous."\r\n\r\nShe turned back to the door, opened it, and called out:  "Nastasia!"\r\n\r\nThe ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared, and Archer heard Madame\r\nOlenska say, in an Italian that she seemed to pronounce with\r\nintentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it:\r\n"Here--throw this into the dustbin!" and then, as Nastasia stared\r\nprotestingly:  "But no--it\'s not the fault of the poor flowers.  Tell\r\nthe boy to carry them to the house three doors away, the house of Mr.\r\nWinsett, the dark gentleman who dined here.  His wife is ill--they may\r\ngive her pleasure ... The boy is out, you say?  Then, my dear one, run\r\nyourself; here, put my cloak over you and fly.  I want the thing out of\r\nthe house immediately!  And, as you live, don\'t say they come from me!"\r\n\r\nShe flung her velvet opera cloak over the maid\'s shoulders and turned\r\nback into the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply.  Her bosom was\r\nrising high under its lace, and for a moment Archer thought she was\r\nabout to cry; but she burst into a laugh instead, and looking from the\r\nMarchioness to Archer, asked abruptly: "And you two--have you made\r\nfriends!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s for Mr. Archer to say, darling; he has waited patiently while you\r\nwere dressing."\r\n\r\n"Yes--I gave you time enough: my hair wouldn\'t go," Madame Olenska\r\nsaid, raising her hand to the heaped-up curls of her chignon.  "But\r\nthat reminds me: I see Dr. Carver is gone, and you\'ll be late at the\r\nBlenkers\'.  Mr. Archer, will you put my aunt in the carriage?"\r\n\r\nShe followed the Marchioness into the hall, saw her fitted into a\r\nmiscellaneous heap of overshoes, shawls and tippets, and called from\r\nthe doorstep:  "Mind, the carriage is to be back for me at ten!"  Then\r\nshe returned to the drawing-room, where Archer, on re-entering it,\r\nfound her standing by the mantelpiece, examining herself in the mirror.\r\nIt was not usual, in New York society, for a lady to address her\r\nparlour-maid as "my dear one," and send her out on an errand wrapped in\r\nher own opera-cloak; and Archer, through all his deeper feelings,\r\ntasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action\r\nfollowed on emotion with such Olympian speed.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska did not move when he came up behind her, and for a\r\nsecond their eyes met in the mirror; then she turned, threw herself\r\ninto her sofa-corner, and sighed out:  "There\'s time for a cigarette."\r\n\r\nHe handed her the box and lit a spill for her; and as the flame flashed\r\nup into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said:  "What\r\ndo you think of me in a temper?"\r\n\r\nArcher paused a moment; then he answered with sudden resolution:  "It\r\nmakes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you."\r\n\r\n"I knew she\'d been talking about me.  Well?"\r\n\r\n"She said you were used to all kinds of things--splendours and\r\namusements and excitements--that we could never hope to give you here."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips.\r\n\r\n"Medora is incorrigibly romantic.  It has made up to her for so many\r\nthings!"\r\n\r\nArcher hesitated again, and again took his risk.  "Is your aunt\'s\r\nromanticism always consistent with accuracy?"\r\n\r\n"You mean: does she speak the truth?"  Her niece considered.  "Well,\r\nI\'ll tell you: in almost everything she says, there\'s something true\r\nand something untrue.  But why do you ask?  What has she been telling\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nHe looked away into the fire, and then back at her shining presence.\r\nHis heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening\r\nby that fireside, and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry\r\nher away.\r\n\r\n"She says--she pretends that Count Olenski has asked her to persuade\r\nyou to go back to him."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska made no answer.  She sat motionless, holding her\r\ncigarette in her half-lifted hand.  The expression of her face had not\r\nchanged; and Archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent\r\nincapacity for surprise.\r\n\r\n"You knew, then?" he broke out.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette.\r\nShe brushed it to the floor.  "She has hinted about a letter: poor\r\ndarling!  Medora\'s hints--"\r\n\r\n"Is it at your husband\'s request that she has arrived here suddenly?"\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska seemed to consider this question also.  "There again:\r\none can\'t tell.  She told me she had had a \'spiritual summons,\'\r\nwhatever that is, from Dr. Carver.  I\'m afraid she\'s going to marry Dr.\r\nCarver ...  poor Medora, there\'s always some one she wants to marry.\r\nBut perhaps the people in Cuba just got tired of her!  I think she was\r\nwith them as a sort of paid companion.  Really, I don\'t know why she\r\ncame."\r\n\r\n"But you do believe she has a letter from your husband?"\r\n\r\nAgain Madame Olenska brooded silently; then she said:  "After all, it\r\nwas to be expected."\r\n\r\nThe young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace.  A sudden\r\nrestlessness possessed him, and he was tongue-tied by the sense that\r\ntheir minutes were numbered, and that at any moment he might hear the\r\nwheels of the returning carriage.\r\n\r\n"You know that your aunt believes you will go back?"\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska raised her head quickly.  A deep blush rose to her face\r\nand spread over her neck and shoulders.  She blushed seldom and\r\npainfully, as if it hurt her like a burn.\r\n\r\n"Many cruel things have been believed of me," she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ellen--forgive me; I\'m a fool and a brute!"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little.  "You are horribly nervous; you have your own\r\ntroubles.  I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your\r\nmarriage, and of course I agree with you.  In Europe people don\'t\r\nunderstand our long American engagements; I suppose they are not as\r\ncalm as we are."  She pronounced the "we" with a faint emphasis that\r\ngave it an ironic sound.\r\n\r\nArcher felt the irony but did not dare to take it up.  After all, she\r\nhad perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs,\r\nand after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that\r\nall he could do was to follow her lead.  But the sense of the waning\r\nhour made him desperate: he could not bear the thought that a barrier\r\nof words should drop between them again.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said abruptly; "I went south to ask May to marry me after\r\nEaster.  There\'s no reason why we shouldn\'t be married then."\r\n\r\n"And May adores you--and yet you couldn\'t convince her?  I thought her\r\ntoo intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions."\r\n\r\n"She IS too intelligent--she\'s not their slave."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska looked at him.  "Well, then--I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\nArcher reddened, and hurried on with a rush.  "We had a frank\r\ntalk--almost the first.  She thinks my impatience a bad sign."\r\n\r\n"Merciful heavens--a bad sign?"\r\n\r\n"She thinks it means that I can\'t trust myself to go on caring for her.\r\nShe thinks, in short, I want to marry her at once to get away from some\r\none that I--care for more."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska examined this curiously.  "But if she thinks that--why\r\nisn\'t she in a hurry too?"\r\n\r\n"Because she\'s not like that: she\'s so much nobler.  She insists all\r\nthe more on the long engagement, to give me time--"\r\n\r\n"Time to give her up for the other woman?"\r\n\r\n"If I want to."\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed\r\neyes.  Down the quiet street Archer heard the approaching trot of her\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n"That IS noble," she said, with a slight break in her voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  But it\'s ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous?  Because you don\'t care for any one else?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t mean to marry any one else."\r\n\r\n"Ah."  There was another long interval.  At length she looked up at him\r\nand asked:  "This other woman--does she love you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s no other woman; I mean, the person that May was thinking\r\nof is--was never--"\r\n\r\n"Then, why, after all, are you in such haste?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s your carriage," said Archer.\r\n\r\nShe half-rose and looked about her with absent eyes.  Her fan and\r\ngloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I suppose I must be going."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to Mrs. Struthers\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."  She smiled and added:  "I must go where I am invited, or I\r\nshould be too lonely.  Why not come with me?"\r\n\r\nArcher felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her\r\ngive him the rest of her evening.  Ignoring her question, he continued\r\nto lean against the chimney-piece, his eyes fixed on the hand in which\r\nshe held her gloves and fan, as if watching to see if he had the power\r\nto make her drop them.\r\n\r\n"May guessed the truth," he said.  "There is another woman--but not the\r\none she thinks."\r\n\r\nEllen Olenska made no answer, and did not move.  After a moment he sat\r\ndown beside her, and, taking her hand, softly unclasped it, so that the\r\ngloves and fan fell on the sofa between them.\r\n\r\nShe started up, and freeing herself from him moved away to the other\r\nside of the hearth.  "Ah, don\'t make love to me!  Too many people have\r\ndone that," she said, frowning.\r\n\r\nArcher, changing colour, stood up also: it was the bitterest rebuke she\r\ncould have given him.  "I have never made love to you," he said, "and I\r\nnever shall.  But you are the woman I would have married if it had been\r\npossible for either of us."\r\n\r\n"Possible for either of us?"  She looked at him with unfeigned\r\nastonishment.  "And you say that--when it\'s you who\'ve made it\r\nimpossible?"\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, groping in a blackness through which a single arrow\r\nof light tore its blinding way.\r\n\r\n"I\'VE made it impossible--?"\r\n\r\n"You, you, YOU!" she cried, her lip trembling like a child\'s on the\r\nverge of tears.  "Isn\'t it you who made me give up divorcing--give it\r\nup because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was, how one must\r\nsacrifice one\'s self to preserve the dignity of marriage ... and to\r\nspare one\'s family the publicity, the scandal?  And because my family\r\nwas going to be your family--for May\'s sake and for yours--I did what\r\nyou told me, what you proved to me that I ought to do.  Ah," she broke\r\nout with a sudden laugh, "I\'ve made no secret of having done it for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nShe sank down on the sofa again, crouching among the festive ripples of\r\nher dress like a stricken masquerader; and the young man stood by the\r\nfireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving.\r\n\r\n"Good God," he groaned.  "When I thought--"\r\n\r\n"You thought?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t ask me what I thought!"\r\n\r\nStill looking at her, he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck\r\nto her face.  She sat upright, facing him with a rigid dignity.\r\n\r\n"I do ask you."\r\n\r\n"Well, then: there were things in that letter you asked me to read--"\r\n\r\n"My husband\'s letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I had nothing to fear from that letter: absolutely nothing!  All I\r\nfeared was to bring notoriety, scandal, on the family--on you and May."\r\n\r\n"Good God," he groaned again, bowing his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final\r\nand irrevocable.  It seemed to Archer to be crushing him down like his\r\nown grave-stone; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever\r\nlift that load from his heart.  He did not move from his place, or\r\nraise his head from his hands; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into\r\nutter darkness.\r\n\r\n"At least I loved you--" he brought out.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the hearth, from the sofa-corner where he supposed\r\nthat she still crouched, he heard a faint stifled crying like a\r\nchild\'s.  He started up and came to her side.\r\n\r\n"Ellen!  What madness!  Why are you crying?  Nothing\'s done that can\'t\r\nbe undone.  I\'m still free, and you\'re going to be."  He had her in his\r\narms, her face like a wet flower at his lips, and all their vain\r\nterrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise.  The one thing that\r\nastonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes\r\narguing with her across the width of the room, when just touching her\r\nmade everything so simple.\r\n\r\nShe gave him back all his kiss, but after a moment he felt her\r\nstiffening in his arms, and she put him aside and stood up.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor Newland--I suppose this had to be.  But it doesn\'t in the\r\nleast alter things," she said, looking down at him in her turn from the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\n"It alters the whole of life for me."\r\n\r\n"No, no--it mustn\'t, it can\'t.  You\'re engaged to May Welland; and I\'m\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\nHe stood up too, flushed and resolute.  "Nonsense!  It\'s too late for\r\nthat sort of thing.  We\'ve no right to lie to other people or to\r\nourselves.  We won\'t talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying\r\nMay after this?"\r\n\r\nShe stood silent, resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece, her\r\nprofile reflected in the glass behind her.  One of the locks of her\r\nchignon had become loosened and hung on her neck; she looked haggard\r\nand almost old.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see you," she said at length, "putting that question to May.\r\nDo you?"\r\n\r\nHe gave a reckless shrug.  "It\'s too late to do anything else."\r\n\r\n"You say that because it\'s the easiest thing to say at this moment--not\r\nbecause it\'s true.  In reality it\'s too late to do anything but what\r\nwe\'d both decided on."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I don\'t understand you!"\r\n\r\nShe forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing\r\nit.  "You don\'t understand because you haven\'t yet guessed how you\'ve\r\nchanged things for me: oh, from the first--long before I knew all you\'d\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"All I\'d done?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy\r\nof me--that they thought I was a dreadful sort of person.  It seems\r\nthey had even refused to meet me at dinner.  I found that out\r\nafterward; and how you\'d made your mother go with you to the van der\r\nLuydens\'; and how you\'d insisted on announcing your engagement at the\r\nBeaufort ball, so that I might have two families to stand by me instead\r\nof one--"\r\n\r\nAt that he broke into a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Just imagine," she said, "how stupid and unobservant I was!  I knew\r\nnothing of all this till Granny blurted it out one day.  New York\r\nsimply meant peace and freedom to me: it was coming home.  And I was so\r\nhappy at being among my own people that every one I met seemed kind and\r\ngood, and glad to see me.  But from the very beginning," she continued,\r\n"I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons\r\nthat I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard\r\nand--unnecessary.  The very good people didn\'t convince me; I felt\r\nthey\'d never been tempted.  But you knew; you understood; you had felt\r\nthe world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands--and yet you\r\nhated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by\r\ndisloyalty and cruelty and indifference.  That was what I\'d never known\r\nbefore--and it\'s better than anything I\'ve known."\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a low even voice, without tears or visible agitation; and\r\neach word, as it dropped from her, fell into his breast like burning\r\nlead.  He sat bowed over, his head between his hands, staring at the\r\nhearthrug, and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her\r\ndress.  Suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe.\r\n\r\nShe bent over him, laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking at\r\nhim with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t let us undo what you\'ve done!" she cried.  "I can\'t go back\r\nnow to that other way of thinking.  I can\'t love you unless I give you\r\nup."\r\n\r\nHis arms were yearning up to her; but she drew away, and they remained\r\nfacing each other, divided by the distance that her words had created.\r\nThen, abruptly, his anger overflowed.\r\n\r\n"And Beaufort?  Is he to replace me?"\r\n\r\nAs the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of\r\nanger; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own.  But Madame\r\nOlenska only grew a shade paler, and stood with her arms hanging down\r\nbefore her, and her head slightly bent, as her way was when she\r\npondered a question.\r\n\r\n"He\'s waiting for you now at Mrs. Struthers\'s; why don\'t you go to\r\nhim?" Archer sneered.\r\n\r\nShe turned to ring the bell.  "I shall not go out this evening; tell\r\nthe carriage to go and fetch the Signora Marchesa," she said when the\r\nmaid came.\r\n\r\nAfter the door had closed again Archer continued to look at her with\r\nbitter eyes.  "Why this sacrifice?  Since you tell me that you\'re\r\nlonely I\'ve no right to keep you from your friends."\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little under her wet lashes.  "I shan\'t be lonely now.  I\r\nWAS lonely; I WAS afraid.  But the emptiness and the darkness are gone;\r\nwhen I turn back into myself now I\'m like a child going at night into a\r\nroom where there\'s always a light."\r\n\r\nHer tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility,\r\nand Archer groaned out again:  "I don\'t understand you!"\r\n\r\n"Yet you understand May!"\r\n\r\nHe reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her.  "May is ready\r\nto give me up."\r\n\r\n"What!  Three days after you\'ve entreated her on your knees to hasten\r\nyour marriage?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s refused; that gives me the right--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'ve taught me what an ugly word that is," she said.\r\n\r\nHe turned away with a sense of utter weariness.  He felt as though he\r\nhad been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice, and\r\nnow, just as he had fought his way to the top, his hold had given way\r\nand he was pitching down headlong into darkness.\r\n\r\nIf he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her\r\narguments; but she still held him at a distance by something\r\ninscrutably aloof in her look and attitude, and by his own awed sense\r\nof her sincerity.  At length he began to plead again.\r\n\r\n"If we do this now it will be worse afterward--worse for every one--"\r\n\r\n"No--no--no!" she almost screamed, as if he frightened her.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house.  They had\r\nheard no carriage stopping at the door, and they stood motionless,\r\nlooking at each other with startled eyes.\r\n\r\nOutside, Nastasia\'s step crossed the hall, the outer door opened, and a\r\nmoment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the\r\nCountess Olenska.\r\n\r\n"The lady was very happy at the flowers," Nastasia said, smoothing her\r\napron.  "She thought it was her signor marito who had sent them, and\r\nshe cried a little and said it was a folly."\r\n\r\nHer mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope.  She tore it open and\r\ncarried it to the lamp; then, when the door had closed again, she\r\nhanded the telegram to Archer.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from St. Augustine, and addressed to the Countess Olenska.\r\nIn it he read:  "Granny\'s telegram successful.  Papa and Mamma agree\r\nmarriage after Easter.  Am telegraphing Newland.  Am too happy for\r\nwords and love you dearly.  Your grateful May."\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when Archer unlocked his own front-door, he found a\r\nsimilar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and\r\nletters.  The message inside the envelope was also from May Welland,\r\nand ran as follows:  "Parents consent wedding Tuesday after Easter at\r\ntwelve Grace Church eight bridesmaids please see Rector so happy love\r\nMay."\r\n\r\nArcher crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate\r\nthe news it contained.  Then he pulled out a small pocket-diary and\r\nturned over the pages with trembling fingers; but he did not find what\r\nhe wanted, and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nA light was shining through the door of the little hall-room which\r\nserved Janey as a dressing-room and boudoir, and her brother rapped\r\nimpatiently on the panel.  The door opened, and his sister stood before\r\nhim in her immemorial purple flannel dressing-gown, with her hair "on\r\npins."  Her face looked pale and apprehensive.\r\n\r\n"Newland!  I hope there\'s no bad news in that telegram?  I waited on\r\npurpose, in case--"  (No item of his correspondence was safe from\r\nJaney.)\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of her question.  "Look here--what day is Easter this\r\nyear?"\r\n\r\nShe looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance.  "Easter?  Newland!\r\nWhy, of course, the first week in April.  Why?"\r\n\r\n"The first week?"  He turned again to the pages of his diary,\r\ncalculating rapidly under his breath.  "The first week, did you say?"\r\nHe threw back his head with a long laugh.\r\n\r\n"For mercy\'s sake what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing\'s the matter, except that I\'m going to be married in a month."\r\n\r\nJaney fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast.\r\n"Oh Newland, how wonderful!  I\'m so glad!  But, dearest, why do you\r\nkeep on laughing?  Do hush, or you\'ll wake Mamma."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nThe day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust.  All the old\r\nladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing\r\nermines, and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered\r\nthe faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, at a signal from the sexton, had come out of the vestry\r\nand placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of Grace\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was\r\nin sight; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of\r\nadjustment and consultation in the lobby, where the bridesmaids were\r\nalready hovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms.  During this\r\nunavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof of his eagerness,\r\nwas expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled\r\ncompany; and Archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as\r\nthrough all the others which made of a nineteenth century New York\r\nwedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history.\r\nEverything was equally easy--or equally painful, as one chose to put\r\nit--in the path he was committed to tread, and he had obeyed the\r\nflurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms\r\nhad obeyed his own, in the days when he had guided them through the\r\nsame labyrinth.\r\n\r\nSo far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations.\r\nThe bridesmaids\' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies-of-the-valley\r\nhad been sent in due time, as well as the gold and sapphire\r\nsleeve-links of the eight ushers and the best man\'s cat\'s-eye\r\nscarf-pin; Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording\r\nof his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and\r\nex-lady-loves; the fees for the Bishop and the Rector were safely in\r\nthe pocket of his best man; his own luggage was already at Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott\'s, where the wedding-breakfast was to take place, and so were\r\nthe travelling clothes into which he was to change; and a private\r\ncompartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young\r\ncouple to their unknown destination--concealment of the spot in which\r\nthe bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of\r\nthe prehistoric ritual.\r\n\r\n"Got the ring all right?" whispered young van der Luyden Newland, who\r\nwas inexperienced in the duties of a best man, and awed by the weight\r\nof his responsibility.\r\n\r\nArcher made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make:\r\nwith his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey\r\nwaistcoat, and assured himself that the little gold circlet (engraved\r\ninside: Newland to May, April ---, 187-) was in its place; then,\r\nresuming his former attitude, his tall hat and pearl-grey gloves with\r\nblack stitchings grasped in his left hand, he stood looking at the door\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\nOverhead, Handel\'s March swelled pompously through the imitation stone\r\nvaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at\r\nwhich, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel\r\nstep watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms.\r\n\r\n"How like a first night at the Opera!" he thought, recognising all the\r\nsame faces in the same boxes (no, pews), and wondering if, when the\r\nLast Trump sounded, Mrs. Selfridge Merry would be there with the same\r\ntowering ostrich feathers in her bonnet, and Mrs. Beaufort with the\r\nsame diamond earrings and the same smile--and whether suitable\r\nproscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was still time to review, one by one, the familiar\r\ncountenances in the first rows; the women\'s sharp with curiosity and\r\nexcitement, the men\'s sulky with the obligation of having to put on\r\ntheir frock-coats before luncheon, and fight for food at the\r\nwedding-breakfast.\r\n\r\n"Too bad the breakfast is at old Catherine\'s," the bridegroom could\r\nfancy Reggie Chivers saying.  "But I\'m told that Lovell Mingott\r\ninsisted on its being cooked by his own chef, so it ought to be good if\r\none can only get at it."  And he could imagine Sillerton Jackson adding\r\nwith authority:  "My dear fellow, haven\'t you heard?  It\'s to be served\r\nat small tables, in the new English fashion."\r\n\r\nArcher\'s eyes lingered a moment on the left-hand pew, where his mother,\r\nwho had entered the church on Mr. Henry van der Luyden\'s arm, sat\r\nweeping softly under her Chantilly veil, her hands in her grandmother\'s\r\nermine muff.\r\n\r\n"Poor Janey!" he thought, looking at his sister, "even by screwing her\r\nhead around she can see only the people in the few front pews; and\r\nthey\'re mostly dowdy Newlands and Dagonets."\r\n\r\nOn the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved\r\nfor the families he saw Beaufort, tall and redfaced, scrutinising the\r\nwomen with his arrogant stare.  Beside him sat his wife, all silvery\r\nchinchilla and violets; and on the far side of the ribbon, Lawrence\r\nLefferts\'s sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the\r\ninvisible deity of "Good Form" who presided at the ceremony.\r\n\r\nArcher wondered how many flaws Lefferts\'s keen eyes would discover in\r\nthe ritual of his divinity; then he suddenly recalled that he too had\r\nonce thought such questions important.  The things that had filled his\r\ndays seemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like the wrangles of\r\nmediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever\r\nunderstood.  A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents\r\nshould be "shown" had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and\r\nit seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work\r\nthemselves into a state of agitation over such trifles, and that the\r\nmatter should have been decided (in the negative) by Mrs. Welland\'s\r\nsaying, with indignant tears:  "I should as soon turn the reporters\r\nloose in my house."  Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite\r\nand rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when\r\neverything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had\r\nseemed to him fraught with world-wide significance.\r\n\r\n"And all the while, I suppose," he thought, "real people were living\r\nsomewhere, and real things happening to them ..."\r\n\r\n"THERE THEY COME!" breathed the best man excitedly; but the bridegroom\r\nknew better.\r\n\r\nThe cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that Mr.\r\nBrown the livery-stable keeper (gowned in black in his intermittent\r\ncharacter of sexton) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene\r\nbefore marshalling his forces.  The door was softly shut again; then\r\nafter another interval it swung majestically open, and a murmur ran\r\nthrough the church:  "The family!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Welland came first, on the arm of her eldest son.  Her large pink\r\nface was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale\r\nblue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met\r\nwith general approval; but before she had settled herself with a\r\nstately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer\'s the spectators were\r\ncraning their necks to see who was coming after her.  Wild rumours had\r\nbeen abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, in\r\nspite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at\r\nthe ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting\r\ncharacter that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk\r\nup the nave and squeeze into a seat.  It was known that she had\r\ninsisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of\r\ntaking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space\r\nbetween the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging,\r\nand for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the\r\nplan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and\r\nsitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her\r\nrelations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person\r\nwho suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the\r\niron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the\r\ncurbstone.  The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the\r\nbride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood\r\noutside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even\r\nold Catherine\'s courage, though for a moment she had weighed the\r\npossibility.  "Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT\r\nIN THE PAPERS!" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother\'s last plan was\r\nhinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled\r\nwith a collective shudder.  The ancestress had had to give in; but her\r\nconcession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast\r\nshould take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square\r\nconnection said) with the Wellands\' house in easy reach it was hard to\r\nhave to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end\r\nof nowhere.\r\n\r\nThough all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons\r\na sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would\r\nappear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature\r\nwhen she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law.  Mrs.\r\nLovell Mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies\r\nof her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but\r\nonce the disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law\'s\r\nnon-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that her black Chantilly\r\nover lilac satin, with a bonnet of Parma violets, formed the happiest\r\ncontrast to Mrs. Welland\'s blue and plum-colour.  Far different was the\r\nimpression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on Mr.\r\nMingott\'s arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and\r\nfloating scarves; and as this last apparition glided into view Archer\'s\r\nheart contracted and stopped beating.\r\n\r\nHe had taken it for granted that the Marchioness Manson was still in\r\nWashington, where she had gone some four weeks previously with her\r\nniece, Madame Olenska.  It was generally understood that their abrupt\r\ndeparture was due to Madame Olenska\'s desire to remove her aunt from\r\nthe baleful eloquence of Dr. Agathon Carver, who had nearly succeeded\r\nin enlisting her as a recruit for the Valley of Love; and in the\r\ncircumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for\r\nthe wedding.  For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora\'s\r\nfantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little\r\nprocession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had\r\ntaken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves\r\ntogether like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre,\r\nwere already slipping through the side doors into the lobby.\r\n\r\n"Newland--I say: SHE\'S HERE!" the best man whispered.\r\n\r\nArcher roused himself with a start.\r\n\r\nA long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating,\r\nfor the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave, the\r\nBishop, the Rector and two white-winged assistants were hovering about\r\nthe flower-banked altar, and the first chords of the Spohr symphony\r\nwere strewing their flower-like notes before the bride.\r\n\r\nArcher opened his eyes (but could they really have been shut, as he\r\nimagined?), and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task.  The\r\nmusic, the scent of the lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of\r\ntulle and orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, the sight of Mrs.\r\nArcher\'s face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs, the low benedictory\r\nmurmur of the Rector\'s voice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pink\r\nbridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights, sounds and\r\nsensations, so familiar in themselves, so unutterably strange and\r\nmeaningless in his new relation to them, were confusedly mingled in his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n"My God," he thought, "HAVE I got the ring?"--and once more he went\r\nthrough the bridegroom\'s convulsive gesture.\r\n\r\nThen, in a moment, May was beside him, such radiance streaming from her\r\nthat it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened\r\nhimself and smiled into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here," the Rector began ...\r\n\r\nThe ring was on her hand, the Bishop\'s benediction had been given, the\r\nbridesmaids were a-poise to resume their place in the procession, and\r\nthe organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the\r\nMendelssohn March, without which no newly-wedded couple had ever\r\nemerged upon New York.\r\n\r\n"Your arm--I SAY, GIVE HER YOUR ARM!" young Newland nervously hissed;\r\nand once more Archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the\r\nunknown.  What was it that had sent him there, he wondered?  Perhaps\r\nthe glimpse, among the anonymous spectators in the transept, of a dark\r\ncoil of hair under a hat which, a moment later, revealed itself as\r\nbelonging to an unknown lady with a long nose, so laughably unlike the\r\nperson whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were\r\nbecoming subject to hallucinations.\r\n\r\nAnd now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried\r\nforward on the light Mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to\r\nthem through widely opened doors, and Mrs. Welland\'s chestnuts, with\r\nbig white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the\r\nfar end of the canvas tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped\r\nMay\'s white cloak about her, and Archer jumped into the brougham at her\r\nside.  She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands\r\nclasped under her veil.\r\n\r\n"Darling!" Archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before\r\nhim and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his\r\nvoice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully:  "Yes, of course I thought\r\nI\'d lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a\r\nbridegroom didn\'t go through that.  But you DID keep me waiting, you\r\nknow!  I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen."\r\n\r\nShe surprised him by turning, in full Fifth Avenue, and flinging her\r\narms about his neck.  "But none ever CAN happen now, can it, Newland,\r\nas long as we two are together?"\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the\r\nyoung couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on\r\ntheir travelling-clothes, descend the wide Mingott stairs between\r\nlaughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham\r\nunder the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was\r\nstill half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last\r\nweeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and\r\nsettle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May\'s maid had\r\nalready placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new\r\ndressing-bag from London.\r\n\r\nThe old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal\r\nof the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of\r\nspending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer; and Archer, glad to\r\nescape the usual "bridal suite" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel,\r\nhad accepted with an equal alacrity.\r\n\r\nMay was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly\r\namused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where\r\ntheir mysterious retreat was situated.  It was thought "very English"\r\nto have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of\r\ndistinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant\r\nwedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to\r\nknow, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the\r\nknowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously:  "Ah, they didn\'t\r\ntell us--" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to.\r\n\r\nOnce they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off\r\nthe endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of\r\nspring, talk became easier than Archer had expected.  May was still, in\r\nlook and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes\r\nwith him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as\r\nimpartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher.  At\r\nfirst Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an\r\ninward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil\r\nunawareness.  She was alone for the first time with her husband; but\r\nher husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday.  There was no\r\none whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and\r\nthe culminating "lark" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement\r\nand marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup\r\nperson, like a "married woman," in fact.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful that--as he had learned in the Mission garden at St.\r\nAugustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of\r\nimagination.  But he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him\r\nby dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience\r\nhad been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go\r\nthrough life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as\r\nit came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their\r\ntransparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than\r\na person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue\r\nor a Greek goddess.  The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might\r\nhave been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her\r\nlook of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor\r\ndull, but only primitive and pure.  In the thick of this meditation\r\nArcher suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a\r\nstranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and\r\nof Granny Mingott\'s immense and triumphant pervasion of it.\r\n\r\nMay settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject.  "I was surprised,\r\nthough--weren\'t you?--that aunt Medora came after all.  Ellen wrote\r\nthat they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; I do\r\nwish it had been she who had recovered!  Did you see the exquisite old\r\nlace she sent me?"\r\n\r\nHe had known that the moment must come sooner or later, but he had\r\nsomewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay.\r\n\r\n"Yes--I--no: yes, it was beautiful," he said, looking at her blindly,\r\nand wondering if, whenever he heard those two syllables, all his\r\ncarefully built-up world would tumble about him like a house of cards.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you tired?  It will be good to have some tea when we\r\narrive--I\'m sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready," he\r\nrattled on, taking her hand in his; and her mind rushed away instantly\r\nto the magnificent tea and coffee service of Baltimore silver which the\r\nBeauforts had sent, and which "went" so perfectly with uncle Lovell\r\nMingott\'s trays and side-dishes.\r\n\r\nIn the spring twilight the train stopped at the Rhinebeck station, and\r\nthey walked along the platform to the waiting carriage.\r\n\r\n"Ah, how awfully kind of the van der Luydens--they\'ve sent their man\r\nover from Skuytercliff to meet us," Archer exclaimed, as a sedate\r\nperson out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags.\r\n\r\n"I\'m extremely sorry, sir," said this emissary, "that a little accident\r\nhas occurred at the Miss du Lacs\': a leak in the water-tank.  It\r\nhappened yesterday, and Mr. van der Luyden, who heard of it this\r\nmorning, sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the Patroon\'s\r\nhouse ready.  It will be quite comfortable, I think you\'ll find, sir;\r\nand the Miss du Lacs have sent their cook over, so that it will be\r\nexactly the same as if you\'d been at Rhinebeck."\r\n\r\nArcher stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more\r\napologetic accents:  "It\'ll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure\r\nyou--" and May\'s eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed\r\nsilence:  "The same as Rhinebeck?  The Patroon\'s house?  But it will be\r\na hundred thousand times better--won\'t it, Newland?  It\'s too dear and\r\nkind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it."\r\n\r\nAnd as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their\r\nshining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly:\r\n"Only fancy, I\'ve never been inside it--have you?  The van der Luydens\r\nshow it to so few people.  But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and\r\nshe told me what a darling little place it was: she says it\'s the only\r\nhouse she\'s seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly\r\nhappy in."\r\n\r\n"Well--that\'s what we\'re going to be, isn\'t it?" cried her husband\r\ngaily; and she answered with her boyish smile:  "Ah, it\'s just our luck\r\nbeginning--the wonderful luck we\'re always going to have together!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n"Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest," Archer said; and\r\nhis wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental\r\nBritannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.\r\n\r\nIn all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people\r\nwhom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously\r\navoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not\r\n"dignified" to force one\'s self on the notice of one\'s acquaintances in\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer and Janey, in the course of their visits to Europe, had so\r\nunflinchingly lived up to this principle, and met the friendly advances\r\nof their fellow-travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve,\r\nthat they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a\r\nword with a "foreigner" other than those employed in hotels and\r\nrailway-stations.  Their own compatriots--save those previously known\r\nor properly accredited--they treated with an even more pronounced\r\ndisdain; so that, unless they ran across a Chivers, a Dagonet or a\r\nMingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete.\r\nBut the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at\r\nBotzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage\r\n(whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known\r\nto Janey) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle\r\nof liniment.  The other lady--the intruder\'s sister, Mrs. Carfry--had\r\nbeen seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and Mrs. Archer, who\r\nnever travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately\r\nable to produce the required remedy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carfry was very ill, and as she and her sister Miss Harle were\r\ntravelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the Archer ladies,\r\nwho supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid\r\nhelped to nurse the invalid back to health.\r\n\r\nWhen the Archers left Botzen they had no idea of ever seeing Mrs.\r\nCarfry and Miss Harle again.  Nothing, to Mrs. Archer\'s mind, would\r\nhave been more "undignified" than to force one\'s self on the notice of\r\na "foreigner" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service.\r\nBut Mrs. Carfry and her sister, to whom this point of view was unknown,\r\nand who would have found it utterly incomprehensible, felt themselves\r\nlinked by an eternal gratitude to the "delightful Americans" who had\r\nbeen so kind at Botzen.  With touching fidelity they seized every\r\nchance of meeting Mrs. Archer and Janey in the course of their\r\ncontinental travels, and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding\r\nout when they were to pass through London on their way to or from the\r\nStates.  The intimacy became indissoluble, and Mrs. Archer and Janey,\r\nwhenever they alighted at Brown\'s Hotel, found themselves awaited by\r\ntwo affectionate friends who, like themselves, cultivated ferns in\r\nWardian cases, made macrame lace, read the memoirs of the Baroness\r\nBunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading London pulpits.\r\nAs Mrs. Archer said, it made "another thing of London" to know Mrs.\r\nCarfry and Miss Harle; and by the time that Newland became engaged the\r\ntie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought\r\n"only right" to send a wedding invitation to the two English ladies,\r\nwho sent, in return, a pretty bouquet of pressed Alpine flowers under\r\nglass.  And on the dock, when Newland and his wife sailed for England,\r\nMrs. Archer\'s last word had been:  "You must take May to see Mrs.\r\nCarfry."\r\n\r\nNewland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction; but\r\nMrs. Carfry, with her usual acuteness, had run them down and sent them\r\nan invitation to dine; and it was over this invitation that May Archer\r\nwas wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you, Newland; you KNOW them.  But I shall feel\r\nso shy among a lot of people I\'ve never met.  And what shall I wear?"\r\n\r\nNewland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her.  She looked\r\nhandsomer and more Diana-like than ever.  The moist English air seemed\r\nto have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight\r\nhardness of her virginal features; or else it was simply the inner glow\r\nof happiness, shining through like a light under ice.\r\n\r\n"Wear, dearest?  I thought a trunkful of things had come from Paris\r\nlast week."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course.  I meant to say that I shan\'t know WHICH to wear."\r\nShe pouted a little.  "I\'ve never dined out in London; and I don\'t want\r\nto be ridiculous."\r\n\r\nHe tried to enter into her perplexity.  "But don\'t Englishwomen dress\r\njust like everybody else in the evening?"\r\n\r\n"Newland!  How can you ask such funny questions?  When they go to the\r\ntheatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps they wear new ball-dresses at home; but at any rate Mrs.\r\nCarfry and Miss Harle won\'t.  They\'ll wear caps like my mother\'s--and\r\nshawls; very soft shawls."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but how will the other women be dressed?"\r\n\r\n"Not as well as you, dear," he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly\r\ndeveloped in her Janey\'s morbid interest in clothes.\r\n\r\nShe pushed back her chair with a sigh.  "That\'s dear of you, Newland;\r\nbut it doesn\'t help me much."\r\n\r\nHe had an inspiration.  "Why not wear your wedding-dress?  That can\'t\r\nbe wrong, can it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dearest!  If I only had it here!  But it\'s gone to Paris to be\r\nmade over for next winter, and Worth hasn\'t sent it back."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--" said Archer, getting up.  "Look here--the fog\'s lifting.\r\nIf we made a dash for the National Gallery we might manage to catch a\r\nglimpse of the pictures."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newland Archers were on their way home, after a three months\'\r\nwedding-tour which May, in writing to her girl friends, vaguely\r\nsummarised as "blissful."\r\n\r\nThey had not gone to the Italian Lakes: on reflection, Archer had not\r\nbeen able to picture his wife in that particular setting.  Her own\r\ninclination (after a month with the Paris dressmakers) was for\r\nmountaineering in July and swimming in August.  This plan they\r\npunctually fulfilled, spending July at Interlaken and Grindelwald, and\r\nAugust at a little place called Etretat, on the Normandy coast, which\r\nsome one had recommended as quaint and quiet.  Once or twice, in the\r\nmountains, Archer had pointed southward and said: "There\'s Italy"; and\r\nMay, her feet in a gentian-bed, had smiled cheerfully, and replied:\r\n"It would be lovely to go there next winter, if only you didn\'t have to\r\nbe in New York."\r\n\r\nBut in reality travelling interested her even less than he had\r\nexpected.  She regarded it (once her clothes were ordered) as merely an\r\nenlarged opportunity for walking, riding, swimming, and trying her hand\r\nat the fascinating new game of lawn tennis; and when they finally got\r\nback to London (where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered\r\nHIS clothes) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she\r\nlooked forward to sailing.\r\n\r\nIn London nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops; and\r\nshe found the theatres less exciting than the Paris cafes chantants\r\nwhere, under the blossoming horse-chestnuts of the Champs Elysees, she\r\nhad had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant\r\nterrace on an audience of "cocottes," and having her husband interpret\r\nto her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears.\r\n\r\nArcher had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage.  It\r\nwas less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat May exactly as\r\nall his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice\r\nthe theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied.\r\nThere was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest\r\nnotion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that\r\nMay\'s only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be\r\nto lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.  Her innate dignity\r\nwould always keep her from making the gift abjectly; and a day might\r\neven come (as it once had) when she would find strength to take it\r\naltogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good.  But\r\nwith a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers\r\nsuch a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly\r\noutrageous in his own conduct; and the fineness of her feeling for him\r\nmade that unthinkable.  Whatever happened, he knew, she would always be\r\nloyal, gallant and unresentful; and that pledged him to the practice of\r\nthe same virtues.\r\n\r\nAll this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind.  If her\r\nsimplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed\r\nand rebelled; but since the lines of her character, though so few, were\r\non the same fine mould as her face, she became the tutelary divinity of\r\nall his old traditions and reverences.\r\n\r\nSuch qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel,\r\nthough they made her so easy and pleasant a companion; but he saw at\r\nonce how they would fall into place in their proper setting.  He had no\r\nfear of being oppressed by them, for his artistic and intellectual life\r\nwould go on, as it always had, outside the domestic circle; and within\r\nit there would be nothing small and stifling--coming back to his wife\r\nwould never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open.\r\nAnd when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would\r\nbe filled.\r\n\r\nAll these things went through his mind during their long slow drive\r\nfrom Mayfair to South Kensington, where Mrs. Carfry and her sister\r\nlived.  Archer too would have preferred to escape their friends\'\r\nhospitality: in conformity with the family tradition he had always\r\ntravelled as a sight-seer and looker-on, affecting a haughty\r\nunconsciousness of the presence of his fellow-beings.  Once only, just\r\nafter Harvard, he had spent a few gay weeks at Florence with a band of\r\nqueer Europeanised Americans, dancing all night with titled ladies in\r\npalaces, and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the\r\nfashionable club; but it had all seemed to him, though the greatest fun\r\nin the world, as unreal as a carnival.  These queer cosmopolitan women,\r\ndeep in complicated love-affairs which they appeared to feel the need\r\nof retailing to every one they met, and the magnificent young officers\r\nand elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their\r\nconfidences, were too different from the people Archer had grown up\r\namong, too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot-house exotics,\r\nto detain his imagination long.  To introduce his wife into such a\r\nsociety was out of the question; and in the course of his travels no\r\nother had shown any marked eagerness for his company.\r\n\r\nNot long after their arrival in London he had run across the Duke of\r\nSt. Austrey, and the Duke, instantly and cordially recognising him, had\r\nsaid:  "Look me up, won\'t you?"--but no proper-spirited American would\r\nhave considered that a suggestion to be acted on, and the meeting was\r\nwithout a sequel.  They had even managed to avoid May\'s English aunt,\r\nthe banker\'s wife, who was still in Yorkshire; in fact, they had\r\npurposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their\r\narrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to\r\nthese unknown relatives.\r\n\r\n"Probably there\'ll be nobody at Mrs. Carfry\'s--London\'s a desert at\r\nthis season, and you\'ve made yourself much too beautiful," Archer said\r\nto May, who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her\r\nsky-blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her\r\nto the London grime.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want them to think that we dress like savages," she replied,\r\nwith a scorn that Pocahontas might have resented; and he was struck\r\nagain by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American\r\nwomen for the social advantages of dress.\r\n\r\n"It\'s their armour," he thought, "their defence against the unknown,\r\nand their defiance of it."  And he understood for the first time the\r\nearnestness with which May, who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her\r\nhair to charm him, had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and\r\nordering her extensive wardrobe.\r\n\r\nHe had been right in expecting the party at Mrs. Carfry\'s to be a small\r\none.  Besides their hostess and her sister, they found, in the long\r\nchilly drawing-room, only another shawled lady, a genial Vicar who was\r\nher husband, a silent lad whom Mrs. Carfry named as her nephew, and a\r\nsmall dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor,\r\npronouncing a French name as she did so.\r\n\r\nInto this dimly-lit and dim-featured group May Archer floated like a\r\nswan with the sunset on her: she seemed larger, fairer, more\r\nvoluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her; and he\r\nperceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an\r\nextreme and infantile shyness.\r\n\r\n"What on earth will they expect me to talk about?" her helpless eyes\r\nimplored him, at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was\r\ncalling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms.  But beauty, even\r\nwhen distrustful of itself, awakens confidence in the manly heart; and\r\nthe Vicar and the French-named tutor were soon manifesting to May their\r\ndesire to put her at her ease.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their best efforts, however, the dinner was a languishing\r\naffair.  Archer noticed that his wife\'s way of showing herself at her\r\nease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her\r\nreferences, so that, though her loveliness was an encouragement to\r\nadmiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee.  The Vicar soon\r\nabandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and\r\naccomplished English, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until\r\nthe ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe Vicar, after a glass of port, was obliged to hurry away to a\r\nmeeting, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was packed\r\noff to bed.  But Archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine,\r\nand suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his\r\nlast symposium with Ned Winsett.  The Carfry nephew, it turned out, had\r\nbeen threatened with consumption, and had had to leave Harrow for\r\nSwitzerland, where he had spent two years in the milder air of Lake\r\nLeman.  Being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to M. Riviere, who\r\nhad brought him back to England, and was to remain with him till he\r\nwent up to Oxford the following spring; and M. Riviere added with\r\nsimplicity that he should then have to look out for another job.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible, Archer thought, that he should be long without\r\none, so varied were his interests and so many his gifts.  He was a man\r\nof about thirty, with a thin ugly face (May would certainly have called\r\nhim common-looking) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense\r\nexpressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\nHis father, who had died young, had filled a small diplomatic post, and\r\nit had been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an\r\ninsatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism,\r\nthen into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and at length--after\r\nother experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into\r\ntutoring English youths in Switzerland.  Before that, however, he had\r\nlived much in Paris, frequented the Goncourt grenier, been advised by\r\nMaupassant not to attempt to write (even that seemed to Archer a\r\ndazzling honour!), and had often talked with Merimee in his mother\'s\r\nhouse.  He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious\r\n(having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for), and it was\r\napparent that his literary ambitions had failed.  His situation, in\r\nfact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than Ned\r\nWinsett\'s; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, no one who\r\nloved ideas need hunger mentally.  As it was precisely of that love\r\nthat poor Winsett was starving to death, Archer looked with a sort of\r\nvicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so\r\nrichly in his poverty.\r\n\r\n"You see, Monsieur, it\'s worth everything, isn\'t it, to keep one\'s\r\nintellectual liberty, not to enslave one\'s powers of appreciation,\r\none\'s critical independence?  It was because of that that I abandoned\r\njournalism, and took to so much duller work: tutoring and private\r\nsecretaryship.  There is a good deal of drudgery, of course; but one\r\npreserves one\'s moral freedom, what we call in French one\'s quant a\r\nsoi.  And when one hears good talk one can join in it without\r\ncompromising any opinions but one\'s own; or one can listen, and answer\r\nit inwardly.  Ah, good conversation--there\'s nothing like it, is there?\r\nThe air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.  And so I have never\r\nregretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms\r\nof the same self-abdication."  He fixed his vivid eyes on Archer as he\r\nlit another cigarette.  "Voyez-vous, Monsieur, to be able to look life\r\nin the face: that\'s worth living in a garret for, isn\'t it?  But, after\r\nall, one must earn enough to pay for the garret; and I confess that to\r\ngrow old as a private tutor--or a \'private\' anything--is almost as\r\nchilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at Bucharest.\r\nSometimes I feel I must make a plunge: an immense plunge.  Do you\r\nsuppose, for instance, there would be any opening for me in America--in\r\nNew York?"\r\n\r\nArcher looked at him with startled eyes.  New York, for a young man who\r\nhad frequented the Goncourts and Flaubert, and who thought the life of\r\nideas the only one worth living!  He continued to stare at M.  Riviere\r\nperplexedly, wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and\r\nadvantages would be the surest hindrance to success.\r\n\r\n"New York--New York--but must it be especially New York?" he stammered,\r\nutterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could\r\noffer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nA sudden flush rose under M. Riviere\'s sallow skin.  "I--I thought it\r\nyour metropolis: is not the intellectual life more active there?" he\r\nrejoined; then, as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of\r\nhaving asked a favour, he went on hastily:  "One throws out random\r\nsuggestions--more to one\'s self than to others.  In reality, I see no\r\nimmediate prospect--" and rising from his seat he added, without a\r\ntrace of constraint:  "But Mrs. Carfry will think that I ought to be\r\ntaking you upstairs."\r\n\r\nDuring the homeward drive Archer pondered deeply on this episode.  His\r\nhour with M. Riviere had put new air into his lungs, and his first\r\nimpulse had been to invite him to dine the next day; but he was\r\nbeginning to understand why married men did not always immediately\r\nyield to their first impulses.\r\n\r\n"That young tutor is an interesting fellow: we had some awfully good\r\ntalk after dinner about books and things," he threw out tentatively in\r\nthe hansom.\r\n\r\nMay roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had\r\nread so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the\r\nkey to them.\r\n\r\n"The little Frenchman?  Wasn\'t he dreadfully common?" she questioned\r\ncoldly; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at\r\nhaving been invited out in London to meet a clergyman and a French\r\ntutor.  The disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment\r\nordinarily defined as snobbishness, but by old New York\'s sense of what\r\nwas due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands.  If May\'s\r\nparents had entertained the Carfrys in Fifth Avenue they would have\r\noffered them something more substantial than a parson and a\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nBut Archer was on edge, and took her up.\r\n\r\n"Common--common WHERE?" he queried; and she returned with unusual\r\nreadiness:  "Why, I should say anywhere but in his school-room.  Those\r\npeople are always awkward in society.  But then," she added\r\ndisarmingly, "I suppose I shouldn\'t have known if he was clever."\r\n\r\nArcher disliked her use of the word "clever" almost as much as her use\r\nof the word "common"; but he was beginning to fear his tendency to\r\ndwell on the things he disliked in her.  After all, her point of view\r\nhad always been the same.  It was that of all the people he had grown\r\nup among, and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible.\r\nUntil a few months ago he had never known a "nice" woman who looked at\r\nlife differently; and if a man married it must necessarily be among the\r\nnice.\r\n\r\n"Ah--then I won\'t ask him to dine!" he concluded with a laugh; and May\r\nechoed, bewildered:  "Goodness--ask the Carfrys\' tutor?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not on the same day with the Carfrys, if you prefer I shouldn\'t.\r\nBut I did rather want another talk with him.  He\'s looking for a job in\r\nNew York."\r\n\r\nHer surprise increased with her indifference: he almost fancied that\r\nshe suspected him of being tainted with "foreignness."\r\n\r\n"A job in New York?  What sort of a job?  People don\'t have French\r\ntutors: what does he want to do?"\r\n\r\n"Chiefly to enjoy good conversation, I understand," her husband\r\nretorted perversely; and she broke into an appreciative laugh.  "Oh,\r\nNewland, how funny!  Isn\'t that FRENCH?"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her\r\nrefusing to take seriously his wish to invite M. Riviere.  Another\r\nafter-dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of\r\nNew York; and the more Archer considered it the less he was able to fit\r\nM. Riviere into any conceivable picture of New York as he knew it.\r\n\r\nHe perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many\r\nproblems would be thus negatively solved for him; but as he paid the\r\nhansom and followed his wife\'s long train into the house he took refuge\r\nin the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the\r\nmost difficult in marriage.  "After that I suppose we shall have pretty\r\nnearly finished rubbing off each other\'s angles," he reflected; but the\r\nworst of it was that May\'s pressure was already bearing on the very\r\nangles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nThe small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea.\r\n\r\nThe turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus, and\r\ncast-iron vases painted in chocolate colour, standing at intervals\r\nalong the winding path that led to the sea, looped their garlands of\r\npetunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel.\r\n\r\nHalf way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house\r\n(which was also chocolate-coloured, but with the tin roof of the\r\nverandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning) two large\r\ntargets had been placed against a background of shrubbery.  On the\r\nother side of the lawn, facing the targets, was pitched a real tent,\r\nwith benches and garden-seats about it.  A number of ladies in summer\r\ndresses and gentlemen in grey frock-coats and tall hats stood on the\r\nlawn or sat upon the benches; and every now and then a slender girl in\r\nstarched muslin would step from the tent, bow in hand, and speed her\r\nshaft at one of the targets, while the spectators interrupted their\r\ntalk to watch the result.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, standing on the verandah of the house, looked curiously\r\ndown upon this scene.  On each side of the shiny painted steps was a\r\nlarge blue china flower-pot on a bright yellow china stand.  A spiky\r\ngreen plant filled each pot, and below the verandah ran a wide border\r\nof blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums.  Behind him, the\r\nFrench windows of the drawing-rooms through which he had passed gave\r\nglimpses, between swaying lace curtains, of glassy parquet floors\r\nislanded with chintz poufs, dwarf armchairs, and velvet tables covered\r\nwith trifles in silver.\r\n\r\nThe Newport Archery Club always held its August meeting at the\r\nBeauforts\'.  The sport, which had hitherto known no rival but croquet,\r\nwas beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn-tennis; but the latter\r\ngame was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions,\r\nand as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes\r\nthe bow and arrow held their own.\r\n\r\nArcher looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle.  It surprised\r\nhim that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions\r\nto it had so completely changed.  It was Newport that had first brought\r\nhome to him the extent of the change.  In New York, during the previous\r\nwinter, after he and May had settled down in the new greenish-yellow\r\nhouse with the bow-window and the Pompeian vestibule, he had dropped\r\nback with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of\r\nthis daily activity had served as a link with his former self.  Then\r\nthere had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey\r\nstepper for May\'s brougham (the Wellands had given the carriage), and\r\nthe abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library,\r\nwhich, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out\r\nas he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, Eastlake book-cases and\r\n"sincere" arm-chairs and tables.  At the Century he had found Winsett\r\nagain, and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own\r\nset; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to\r\ndining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening\r\nat the Opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a\r\nfairly real and inevitable sort of business.\r\n\r\nBut Newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of\r\nunmitigated holiday-making.  Archer had tried to persuade May to spend\r\nthe summer on a remote island off the coast of Maine (called,\r\nappropriately enough, Mount Desert), where a few hardy Bostonians and\r\nPhiladelphians were camping in "native" cottages, and whence came\r\nreports of enchanting scenery and a wild, almost trapper-like existence\r\namid woods and waters.\r\n\r\nBut the Wellands always went to Newport, where they owned one of the\r\nsquare boxes on the cliffs, and their son-in-law could adduce no good\r\nreason why he and May should not join them there.  As Mrs. Welland\r\nrather tartly pointed out, it was hardly worth while for May to have\r\nworn herself out trying on summer clothes in Paris if she was not to be\r\nallowed to wear them; and this argument was of a kind to which Archer\r\nhad as yet found no answer.\r\n\r\nMay herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with\r\nso reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer.  She reminded\r\nhim that he had always liked Newport in his bachelor days, and as this\r\nwas indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to\r\nlike it better than ever now that they were to be there together.  But\r\nas he stood on the Beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly\r\npeopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to\r\nlike it at all.\r\n\r\nIt was not May\'s fault, poor dear.  If, now and then, during their\r\ntravels, they had fallen slightly out of step, harmony had been\r\nrestored by their return to the conditions she was used to.  He had\r\nalways foreseen that she would not disappoint him; and he had been\r\nright.  He had married (as most young men did) because he had met a\r\nperfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless\r\nsentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had\r\nrepresented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of\r\nan unescapable duty.\r\n\r\nHe could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice, for she had\r\nfulfilled all that he had expected.  It was undoubtedly gratifying to\r\nbe the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married\r\nwomen in New York, especially when she was also one of the\r\nsweetest-tempered and most reasonable of wives; and Archer had never\r\nbeen insensible to such advantages.  As for the momentary madness which\r\nhad fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage, he had trained himself\r\nto regard it as the last of his discarded experiments.  The idea that\r\nhe could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying the Countess\r\nOlenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory\r\nsimply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\r\n\r\nBut all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather\r\nempty and echoing place, and he supposed that was one of the reasons\r\nwhy the busy animated people on the Beaufort lawn shocked him as if\r\nthey had been children playing in a grave-yard.\r\n\r\nHe heard a murmur of skirts beside him, and the Marchioness Manson\r\nfluttered out of the drawing-room window.  As usual, she was\r\nextraordinarily festooned and bedizened, with a limp Leghorn hat\r\nanchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze, and a little\r\nblack velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over\r\nher much larger hatbrim.\r\n\r\n"My dear Newland, I had no idea that you and May had arrived!  You\r\nyourself came only yesterday, you say?  Ah,\r\nbusiness--business--professional duties ... I understand.  Many\r\nhusbands, I know, find it impossible to join their wives here except\r\nfor the week-end."  She cocked her head on one side and languished at\r\nhim through screwed-up eyes.  "But marriage is one long sacrifice, as I\r\nused often to remind my Ellen--"\r\n\r\nArcher\'s heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once\r\nbefore, and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and\r\nthe outer world; but this break of continuity must have been of the\r\nbriefest, for he presently heard Medora answering a question he had\r\napparently found voice to put.\r\n\r\n"No, I am not staying here, but with the Blenkers, in their delicious\r\nsolitude at Portsmouth.  Beaufort was kind enough to send his famous\r\ntrotters for me this morning, so that I might have at least a glimpse\r\nof one of Regina\'s garden-parties; but this evening I go back to rural\r\nlife.  The Blenkers, dear original beings, have hired a primitive old\r\nfarm-house at Portsmouth where they gather about them representative\r\npeople ..."  She drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim, and\r\nadded with a faint blush:  "This week Dr. Agathon Carver is holding a\r\nseries of Inner Thought meetings there.  A contrast indeed to this gay\r\nscene of worldly pleasure--but then I have always lived on contrasts!\r\nTo me the only death is monotony.  I always say to Ellen: Beware of\r\nmonotony; it\'s the mother of all the deadly sins.  But my poor child is\r\ngoing through a phase of exaltation, of abhorrence of the world.  You\r\nknow, I suppose, that she has declined all invitations to stay at\r\nNewport, even with her grandmother Mingott?  I could hardly persuade\r\nher to come with me to the Blenkers\', if you will believe it!  The life\r\nshe leads is morbid, unnatural.  Ah, if she had only listened to me\r\nwhen it was still possible ... When the door was still open ... But\r\nshall we go down and watch this absorbing match?  I hear your May is\r\none of the competitors."\r\n\r\nStrolling toward them from the tent Beaufort advanced over the lawn,\r\ntall, heavy, too tightly buttoned into a London frock-coat, with one of\r\nhis own orchids in its buttonhole.  Archer, who had not seen him for\r\ntwo or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance.  In\r\nthe hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but\r\nfor his erect square-shouldered walk he would have looked like an\r\nover-fed and over-dressed old man.\r\n\r\nThere were all sorts of rumours afloat about Beaufort.  In the spring\r\nhe had gone off on a long cruise to the West Indies in his new\r\nsteam-yacht, and it was reported that, at various points where he had\r\ntouched, a lady resembling Miss Fanny Ring had been seen in his\r\ncompany.  The steam-yacht, built in the Clyde, and fitted with tiled\r\nbath-rooms and other unheard-of luxuries, was said to have cost him\r\nhalf a million; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his\r\nwife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are\r\napt to be.  Beaufort\'s fortune was substantial enough to stand the\r\nstrain; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted, not only in Fifth\r\nAvenue but in Wall Street.  Some people said he had speculated\r\nunfortunately in railways, others that he was being bled by one of the\r\nmost insatiable members of her profession; and to every report of\r\nthreatened insolvency Beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance: the\r\nbuilding of a new row of orchid-houses, the purchase of a new string of\r\nrace-horses, or the addition of a new Meissonnier or Cabanel to his\r\npicture-gallery.\r\n\r\nHe advanced toward the Marchioness and Newland with his usual\r\nhalf-sneering smile.  "Hullo, Medora!  Did the trotters do their\r\nbusiness?  Forty minutes, eh?  ...  Well, that\'s not so bad,\r\nconsidering your nerves had to be spared."  He shook hands with Archer,\r\nand then, turning back with them, placed himself on Mrs. Manson\'s other\r\nside, and said, in a low voice, a few words which their companion did\r\nnot catch.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks, and a "Que\r\nvoulez-vous?" which deepened Beaufort\'s frown; but he produced a good\r\nsemblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at Archer to say:\r\n"You know May\'s going to carry off the first prize."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then it remains in the family," Medora rippled; and at that moment\r\nthey reached the tent and Mrs. Beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of\r\nmauve muslin and floating veils.\r\n\r\nMay Welland was just coming out of the tent.  In her white dress, with\r\na pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat, she\r\nhad the same Diana-like aloofness as when she had entered the Beaufort\r\nball-room on the night of her engagement.  In the interval not a\r\nthought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her\r\nheart; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both\r\nhe marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had her bow and arrow in her hand, and placing herself on the\r\nchalk-mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and\r\ntook aim.  The attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of\r\nappreciation followed her appearance, and Archer felt the glow of\r\nproprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary well-being.\r\nHer rivals--Mrs. Reggie Chivers, the Merry girls, and divers rosy\r\nThorleys, Dagonets and Mingotts, stood behind her in a lovely anxious\r\ngroup, brown heads and golden bent above the scores, and pale muslins\r\nand flower-wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow.  All were young\r\nand pretty, and bathed in summer bloom; but not one had the nymph-like\r\nease of his wife, when, with tense muscles and happy frown, she bent\r\nher soul upon some feat of strength.\r\n\r\n"Gad," Archer heard Lawrence Lefferts say, "not one of the lot holds\r\nthe bow as she does"; and Beaufort retorted:  "Yes; but that\'s the only\r\nkind of target she\'ll ever hit."\r\n\r\nArcher felt irrationally angry.  His host\'s contemptuous tribute to\r\nMay\'s "niceness" was just what a husband should have wished to hear\r\nsaid of his wife.  The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking\r\nin attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words\r\nsent a faint shiver through his heart.  What if "niceness" carried to\r\nthat supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an\r\nemptiness?  As he looked at May, returning flushed and calm from her\r\nfinal bull\'s-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\nShe took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the\r\ncompany with the simplicity that was her crowning grace.  No one could\r\never be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling\r\nthat she would have been just as serene if she had missed them.  But\r\nwhen her eyes met her husband\'s her face glowed with the pleasure she\r\nsaw in his.\r\n\r\nMrs. Welland\'s basket-work pony-carriage was waiting for them, and they\r\ndrove off among the dispersing carriages, May handling the reins and\r\nArcher sitting at her side.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and\r\nshrubberies, and up and down Bellevue Avenue rolled a double line of\r\nvictorias, dog-carts, landaus and "vis-a-vis," carrying well-dressed\r\nladies and gentlemen away from the Beaufort garden-party, or homeward\r\nfrom their daily afternoon turn along the Ocean Drive.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go to see Granny?" May suddenly proposed.  "I should like to\r\ntell her myself that I\'ve won the prize.  There\'s lots of time before\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nArcher acquiesced, and she turned the ponies down Narragansett Avenue,\r\ncrossed Spring Street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond.\r\nIn this unfashionable region Catherine the Great, always indifferent to\r\nprecedent and thrifty of purse, had built herself in her youth a\r\nmany-peaked and cross-beamed cottage-orne on a bit of cheap land\r\noverlooking the bay.  Here, in a thicket of stunted oaks, her verandahs\r\nspread themselves above the island-dotted waters.  A winding drive led\r\nup between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of\r\ngeraniums to a front door of highly-varnished walnut under a striped\r\nverandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow\r\nstar-patterned parquet floor, upon which opened four small square rooms\r\nwith heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian\r\nhouse-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus.  One of these\r\nrooms had been turned into a bedroom by Mrs. Mingott when the burden of\r\nflesh descended on her, and in the adjoining one she spent her days,\r\nenthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window, and\r\nperpetually waving a palm-leaf fan which the prodigious projection of\r\nher bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set\r\nin motion stirred only the fringe of the anti-macassars on the\r\nchair-arms.\r\n\r\nSince she had been the means of hastening his marriage old Catherine\r\nhad shown to Archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites\r\ntoward the person served.  She was persuaded that irrepressible passion\r\nwas the cause of his impatience; and being an ardent admirer of\r\nimpulsiveness (when it did not lead to the spending of money) she\r\nalways received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of\r\nallusion to which May seemed fortunately impervious.\r\n\r\nShe examined and appraised with much interest the diamond-tipped arrow\r\nwhich had been pinned on May\'s bosom at the conclusion of the match,\r\nremarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought\r\nenough, but that there was no denying that Beaufort did things\r\nhandsomely.\r\n\r\n"Quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear," the old lady chuckled.  "You\r\nmust leave it in fee to your eldest girl." She pinched May\'s white arm\r\nand watched the colour flood her face.  "Well, well, what have I said\r\nto make you shake out the red flag?  Ain\'t there going to be any\r\ndaughters--only boys, eh?  Good gracious, look at her blushing again\r\nall over her blushes!  What--can\'t I say that either?  Mercy me--when\r\nmy children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out\r\noverhead I always say I\'m too thankful to have somebody about me that\r\nNOTHING can shock!"\r\n\r\nArcher burst into a laugh, and May echoed it, crimson to the eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, now tell me all about the party, please, my dears, for I shall\r\nnever get a straight word about it out of that silly Medora," the\r\nancestress continued; and, as May exclaimed:  "Cousin Medora?  But I\r\nthought she was going back to Portsmouth?" she answered placidly: "So\r\nshe is--but she\'s got to come here first to pick up Ellen.  Ah--you\r\ndidn\'t know Ellen had come to spend the day with me?  Such fol-de-rol,\r\nher not coming for the summer; but I gave up arguing with young people\r\nabout fifty years ago.  Ellen--ELLEN!" she cried in her shrill old\r\nvoice, trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn\r\nbeyond the verandah.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and Mrs. Mingott rapped impatiently with her stick\r\non the shiny floor.  A mulatto maid-servant in a bright turban,\r\nreplying to the summons, informed her mistress that she had seen "Miss\r\nEllen" going down the path to the shore; and Mrs. Mingott turned to\r\nArcher.\r\n\r\n"Run down and fetch her, like a good grandson; this pretty lady will\r\ndescribe the party to me," she said; and Archer stood up as if in a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nHe had heard the Countess Olenska\'s name pronounced often enough during\r\nthe year and a half since they had last met, and was even familiar with\r\nthe main incidents of her life in the interval.  He knew that she had\r\nspent the previous summer at Newport, where she appeared to have gone a\r\ngreat deal into society, but that in the autumn she had suddenly\r\nsub-let the "perfect house" which Beaufort had been at such pains to\r\nfind for her, and decided to establish herself in Washington.  There,\r\nduring the winter, he had heard of her (as one always heard of pretty\r\nwomen in Washington) as shining in the "brilliant diplomatic society"\r\nthat was supposed to make up for the social short-comings of the\r\nAdministration.  He had listened to these accounts, and to various\r\ncontradictory reports on her appearance, her conversation, her point of\r\nview and her choice of friends, with the detachment with which one\r\nlistens to reminiscences of some one long since dead; not till Medora\r\nsuddenly spoke her name at the archery match had Ellen Olenska become a\r\nliving presence to him again.  The Marchioness\'s foolish lisp had\r\ncalled up a vision of the little fire-lit drawing-room and the sound of\r\nthe carriage-wheels returning down the deserted street.  He thought of\r\na story he had read, of some peasant children in Tuscany lighting a\r\nbunch of straw in a wayside cavern, and revealing old silent images in\r\ntheir painted tomb ...\r\n\r\nThe way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was\r\nperched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows.\r\nThrough their veil Archer caught the glint of the Lime Rock, with its\r\nwhite-washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light-house\r\nkeeper, Ida Lewis, was living her last venerable years.  Beyond it lay\r\nthe flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of Goat Island, the bay\r\nspreading northward in a shimmer of gold to Prudence Island with its\r\nlow growth of oaks, and the shores of Conanicut faint in the sunset\r\nhaze.\r\n\r\nFrom the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of\r\npagoda-like summer-house; and in the pagoda a lady stood, leaning\r\nagainst the rail, her back to the shore.  Archer stopped at the sight\r\nas if he had waked from sleep.  That vision of the past was a dream,\r\nand the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead:\r\nwas Mrs. Welland\'s pony-carriage circling around and around the oval at\r\nthe door, was May sitting under the shameless Olympians and glowing\r\nwith secret hopes, was the Welland villa at the far end of Bellevue\r\nAvenue, and Mr. Welland, already dressed for dinner, and pacing the\r\ndrawing-room floor, watch in hand, with dyspeptic impatience--for it\r\nwas one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is\r\nhappening at a given hour.\r\n\r\n"What am I?  A son-in-law--" Archer thought.\r\n\r\nThe figure at the end of the pier had not moved.  For a long moment the\r\nyoung man stood half way down the bank, gazing at the bay furrowed with\r\nthe coming and going of sailboats, yacht-launches, fishing-craft and\r\nthe trailing black coal-barges hauled by noisy tugs.  The lady in the\r\nsummer-house seemed to be held by the same sight.  Beyond the grey\r\nbastions of Fort Adams a long-drawn sunset was splintering up into a\r\nthousand fires, and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it\r\nbeat out through the channel between the Lime Rock and the shore.\r\nArcher, as he watched, remembered the scene in the Shaughraun, and\r\nMontague lifting Ada Dyas\'s ribbon to his lips without her knowing that\r\nhe was in the room.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t know--she hasn\'t guessed.  Shouldn\'t I know if she came up\r\nbehind me, I wonder?" he mused; and suddenly he said to himself:  "If\r\nshe doesn\'t turn before that sail crosses the Lime Rock light I\'ll go\r\nback."\r\n\r\nThe boat was gliding out on the receding tide.  It slid before the Lime\r\nRock, blotted out Ida Lewis\'s little house, and passed across the\r\nturret in which the light was hung.  Archer waited till a wide space of\r\nwater sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the\r\nboat; but still the figure in the summer-house did not move.\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked up the hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you didn\'t find Ellen--I should have liked to see her\r\nagain," May said as they drove home through the dusk.  "But perhaps she\r\nwouldn\'t have cared--she seems so changed."\r\n\r\n"Changed?" echoed her husband in a colourless voice, his eyes fixed on\r\nthe ponies\' twitching ears.\r\n\r\n"So indifferent to her friends, I mean; giving up New York and her\r\nhouse, and spending her time with such queer people.  Fancy how\r\nhideously uncomfortable she must be at the Blenkers\'!  She says she\r\ndoes it to keep cousin Medora out of mischief: to prevent her marrying\r\ndreadful people.  But I sometimes think we\'ve always bored her."\r\n\r\nArcher made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that\r\nhe had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice:  "After all, I\r\nwonder if she wouldn\'t be happier with her husband."\r\n\r\nHe burst into a laugh.  "Sancta simplicitas!" he exclaimed; and as she\r\nturned a puzzled frown on him he added:  "I don\'t think I ever heard\r\nyou say a cruel thing before."\r\n\r\n"Cruel?"\r\n\r\n"Well--watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a\r\nfavourite sport of the angels; but I believe even they don\'t think\r\npeople happier in hell."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity she ever married abroad then," said May, in the placid\r\ntone with which her mother met Mr. Welland\'s vagaries; and Archer felt\r\nhimself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands.\r\n\r\nThey drove down Bellevue Avenue and turned in between the chamfered\r\nwooden gate-posts surmounted by cast-iron lamps which marked the\r\napproach to the Welland villa.  Lights were already shining through its\r\nwindows, and Archer, as the carriage stopped, caught a glimpse of his\r\nfather-in-law, exactly as he had pictured him, pacing the drawing-room,\r\nwatch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since\r\nfound to be much more efficacious than anger.\r\n\r\nThe young man, as he followed his wife into the hall, was conscious of\r\na curious reversal of mood.  There was something about the luxury of\r\nthe Welland house and the density of the Welland atmosphere, so charged\r\nwith minute observances and exactions, that always stole into his\r\nsystem like a narcotic.  The heavy carpets, the watchful servants, the\r\nperpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks, the perpetually\r\nrenewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table, the whole\r\nchain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next, and each\r\nmember of the household to all the others, made any less systematised\r\nand affluent existence seem unreal and precarious.  But now it was the\r\nWelland house, and the life he was expected to lead in it, that had\r\nbecome unreal and irrelevant, and the brief scene on the shore, when he\r\nhad stood irresolute, halfway down the bank, was as close to him as the\r\nblood in his veins.\r\n\r\nAll night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at May\'s side,\r\nwatching the moonlight slant along the carpet, and thinking of Ellen\r\nOlenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind Beaufort\'s\r\ntrotters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n"A party for the Blenkers--the Blenkers?"\r\n\r\nMr. Welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and\r\nincredulously across the luncheon-table at his wife, who, adjusting her\r\ngold eye-glasses, read aloud, in the tone of high comedy:\r\n\r\n"Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Welland\'s company at the meeting of the Wednesday Afternoon Club\r\non August 25th at 3 o\'clock punctually.  To meet Mrs. and the Misses\r\nBlenker.\r\n\r\n"Red Gables, Catherine Street.  R. S. V. P."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good gracious--" Mr. Welland gasped, as if a second reading had been\r\nnecessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him.\r\n\r\n"Poor Amy Sillerton--you never can tell what her husband will do next,"\r\nMrs. Welland sighed.  "I suppose he\'s just discovered the Blenkers."\r\n\r\nProfessor Emerson Sillerton was a thorn in the side of Newport society;\r\nand a thorn that could not be plucked out, for it grew on a venerable\r\nand venerated family tree.  He was, as people said, a man who had had\r\n"every advantage."  His father was Sillerton Jackson\'s uncle, his\r\nmother a Pennilow of Boston; on each side there was wealth and\r\nposition, and mutual suitability.  Nothing--as Mrs. Welland had often\r\nremarked--nothing on earth obliged Emerson Sillerton to be an\r\narchaeologist, or indeed a Professor of any sort, or to live in Newport\r\nin winter, or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did.\r\nBut at least, if he was going to break with tradition and flout society\r\nin the face, he need not have married poor Amy Dagonet, who had a right\r\nto expect "something different," and money enough to keep her own\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nNo one in the Mingott set could understand why Amy Sillerton had\r\nsubmitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the\r\nhouse with long-haired men and short-haired women, and, when he\r\ntravelled, took her to explore tombs in Yucatan instead of going to\r\nParis or Italy.  But there they were, set in their ways, and apparently\r\nunaware that they were different from other people; and when they gave\r\none of their dreary annual garden-parties every family on the Cliffs,\r\nbecause of the Sillerton-Pennilow-Dagonet connection, had to draw lots\r\nand send an unwilling representative.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a wonder," Mrs. Welland remarked, "that they didn\'t choose the\r\nCup Race day!  Do you remember, two years ago, their giving a party for\r\na black man on the day of Julia Mingott\'s the dansant?  Luckily this\r\ntime there\'s nothing else going on that I know of--for of course some\r\nof us will have to go."\r\n\r\nMr. Welland sighed nervously.  "\'Some of us,\' my dear--more than one?\r\nThree o\'clock is such a very awkward hour.  I have to be here at\r\nhalf-past three to take my drops: it\'s really no use trying to follow\r\nBencomb\'s new treatment if I don\'t do it systematically; and if I join\r\nyou later, of course I shall miss my drive."  At the thought he laid\r\ndown his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his\r\nfinely-wrinkled cheek.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no reason why you should go at all, my dear," his wife\r\nanswered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic.  "I have some\r\ncards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue, and I\'ll drop in at\r\nabout half-past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that\r\nshe hasn\'t been slighted."  She glanced hesitatingly at her daughter.\r\n"And if Newland\'s afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you\r\nout with the ponies, and try their new russet harness."\r\n\r\nIt was a principle in the Welland family that people\'s days and hours\r\nshould be what Mrs. Welland called "provided for."  The melancholy\r\npossibility of having to "kill time" (especially for those who did not\r\ncare for whist or solitaire) was a vision that haunted her as the\r\nspectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist.  Another of her\r\nprinciples was that parents should never (at least visibly) interfere\r\nwith the plans of their married children; and the difficulty of\r\nadjusting this respect for May\'s independence with the exigency of Mr.\r\nWelland\'s claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity\r\nwhich left not a second of Mrs. Welland\'s own time unprovided for.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ll drive with Papa--I\'m sure Newland will find something\r\nto do," May said, in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his\r\nlack of response.  It was a cause of constant distress to Mrs. Welland\r\nthat her son-in-law showed so little foresight in planning his days.\r\nOften already, during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof,\r\nwhen she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon, he had answered\r\nparadoxically:  "Oh, I think for a change I\'ll just save it instead of\r\nspending it--" and once, when she and May had had to go on a\r\nlong-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having\r\nlain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house.\r\n\r\n"Newland never seems to look ahead," Mrs. Welland once ventured to\r\ncomplain to her daughter; and May answered serenely:  "No; but you see\r\nit doesn\'t matter, because when there\'s nothing particular to do he\r\nreads a book."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--like his father!" Mrs. Welland agreed, as if allowing for an\r\ninherited oddity; and after that the question of Newland\'s unemployment\r\nwas tacitly dropped.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the day for the Sillerton reception approached, May\r\nbegan to show a natural solicitude for his welfare, and to suggest a\r\ntennis match at the Chiverses\', or a sail on Julius Beaufort\'s cutter,\r\nas a means of atoning for her temporary desertion.  "I shall be back by\r\nsix, you know, dear: Papa never drives later than that--" and she was\r\nnot reassured till Archer said that he thought of hiring a run-about\r\nand driving up the island to a stud-farm to look at a second horse for\r\nher brougham.  They had been looking for this horse for some time, and\r\nthe suggestion was so acceptable that May glanced at her mother as if\r\nto say:  "You see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThe idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in\r\nArcher\'s mind on the very day when the Emerson Sillerton invitation had\r\nfirst been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were\r\nsomething clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its\r\nexecution.  He had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance\r\na runabout with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still\r\ndo their eighteen miles on level roads; and at two o\'clock, hastily\r\ndeserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and\r\ndrove off.\r\n\r\nThe day was perfect.  A breeze from the north drove little puffs of\r\nwhite cloud across an ultramarine sky, with a bright sea running under\r\nit.  Bellevue Avenue was empty at that hour, and after dropping the\r\nstable-lad at the corner of Mill Street Archer turned down the Old\r\nBeach Road and drove across Eastman\'s Beach.\r\n\r\nHe had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on\r\nhalf-holidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown.  Taking\r\nhis pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which\r\nwas not far beyond Paradise Rocks, before three o\'clock; so that, after\r\nlooking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would\r\nstill have four golden hours to dispose of.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he heard of the Sillerton\'s party he had said to himself\r\nthat the Marchioness Manson would certainly come to Newport with the\r\nBlenkers, and that Madame Olenska might again take the opportunity of\r\nspending the day with her grandmother.  At any rate, the Blenker\r\nhabitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without\r\nindiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it.  He was not\r\nsure that he wanted to see the Countess Olenska again; but ever since\r\nhe had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted,\r\nirrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and\r\nto follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the\r\nreal one in the summer-house.  The longing was with him day and night,\r\nan incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man\r\nfor food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.  He could not\r\nsee beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was\r\nnot conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her\r\nvoice.  He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the\r\nspot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it,\r\nthe rest of the world might seem less empty.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was\r\nnot what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to\r\nprove to himself that he was not in a hurry.  But at three o\'clock he\r\nshook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads\r\nleading to Portsmouth.  The wind had dropped and a faint haze on the\r\nhorizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the Saconnet on the\r\nturn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in\r\ngolden light.\r\n\r\nHe drove past grey-shingled farm-houses in orchards, past hay-fields\r\nand groves of oak, past villages with white steeples rising sharply\r\ninto the fading sky; and at last, after stopping to ask the way of some\r\nmen at work in a field, he turned down a lane between high banks of\r\ngoldenrod and brambles.  At the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of\r\nthe river; to the left, standing in front of a clump of oaks and\r\nmaples, he saw a long tumble-down house with white paint peeling from\r\nits clapboards.\r\n\r\nOn the road-side facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in\r\nwhich the New Englander shelters his farming implements and visitors\r\n"hitch" their "teams." Archer, jumping down, led his pair into the\r\nshed, and after tying them to a post turned toward the house.  The\r\npatch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hay-field; but to the left\r\nan overgrown box-garden full of dahlias and rusty rose-bushes encircled\r\na ghostly summer-house of trellis-work that had once been white,\r\nsurmounted by a wooden Cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but\r\ncontinued to take ineffectual aim.\r\n\r\nArcher leaned for a while against the gate.  No one was in sight, and\r\nnot a sound came from the open windows of the house: a grizzled\r\nNewfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as\r\nthe arrowless Cupid.  It was strange to think that this place of\r\nsilence and decay was the home of the turbulent Blenkers; yet Archer\r\nwas sure that he was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he stood there, content to take in the scene, and\r\ngradually falling under its drowsy spell; but at length he roused\r\nhimself to the sense of the passing time.  Should he look his fill and\r\nthen drive away?  He stood irresolute, wishing suddenly to see the\r\ninside of the house, so that he might picture the room that Madame\r\nOlenska sat in.  There was nothing to prevent his walking up to the\r\ndoor and ringing the bell; if, as he supposed, she was away with the\r\nrest of the party, he could easily give his name, and ask permission to\r\ngo into the sitting-room to write a message.\r\n\r\nBut instead, he crossed the lawn and turned toward the box-garden.  As\r\nhe entered it he caught sight of something bright-coloured in the\r\nsummer-house, and presently made it out to be a pink parasol.  The\r\nparasol drew him like a magnet: he was sure it was hers.  He went into\r\nthe summer-house, and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the\r\nsilken thing and looked at its carved handle, which was made of some\r\nrare wood that gave out an aromatic scent.  Archer lifted the handle to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nHe heard a rustle of skirts against the box, and sat motionless,\r\nleaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands, and letting the\r\nrustle come nearer without lifting his eyes.  He had always known that\r\nthis must happen ...\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Archer!" exclaimed a loud young voice; and looking up he saw\r\nbefore him the youngest and largest of the Blenker girls, blonde and\r\nblowsy, in bedraggled muslin.  A red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed\r\nto show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow, and her\r\nhalf-awakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly.\r\n\r\n"Gracious--where did you drop from?  I must have been sound asleep in\r\nthe hammock.  Everybody else has gone to Newport.  Did you ring?" she\r\nincoherently enquired.\r\n\r\nArcher\'s confusion was greater than hers.  "I--no--that is, I was just\r\ngoing to.  I had to come up the island to see about a horse, and I\r\ndrove over on a chance of finding Mrs. Blenker and your visitors.  But\r\nthe house seemed empty--so I sat down to wait."\r\n\r\nMiss Blenker, shaking off the fumes of sleep, looked at him with\r\nincreasing interest.  "The house IS empty.  Mother\'s not here, or the\r\nMarchioness--or anybody but me."  Her glance became faintly\r\nreproachful.  "Didn\'t you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are\r\ngiving a garden-party for mother and all of us this afternoon?  It was\r\ntoo unlucky that I couldn\'t go; but I\'ve had a sore throat, and mother\r\nwas afraid of the drive home this evening.  Did you ever know anything\r\nso disappointing?  Of course," she added gaily, "I shouldn\'t have\r\nminded half as much if I\'d known you were coming."\r\n\r\nSymptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and Archer\r\nfound the strength to break in:  "But Madame Olenska--has she gone to\r\nNewport too?"\r\n\r\nMiss Blenker looked at him with surprise.  "Madame Olenska--didn\'t you\r\nknow she\'d been called away?"\r\n\r\n"Called away?--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my best parasol!  I lent it to that goose of a Katie, because it\r\nmatched her ribbons, and the careless thing must have dropped it here.\r\nWe Blenkers are all like that ... real Bohemians!"  Recovering the\r\nsunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy\r\ndome above her head.  "Yes, Ellen was called away yesterday: she lets\r\nus call her Ellen, you know.  A telegram came from Boston: she said she\r\nmight be gone for two days.  I do LOVE the way she does her hair, don\'t\r\nyou?" Miss Blenker rambled on.\r\n\r\nArcher continued to stare through her as though she had been\r\ntransparent.  All he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its\r\npinkness above her giggling head.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he ventured:  "You don\'t happen to know why Madame\r\nOlenska went to Boston?  I hope it was not on account of bad news?"\r\n\r\nMiss Blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity.  "Oh, I don\'t\r\nbelieve so.  She didn\'t tell us what was in the telegram.  I think she\r\ndidn\'t want the Marchioness to know.  She\'s so romantic-looking, isn\'t\r\nshe?  Doesn\'t she remind you of Mrs. Scott-Siddons when she reads \'Lady\r\nGeraldine\'s Courtship\'?  Did you never hear her?"\r\n\r\nArcher was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts.  His whole future\r\nseemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless\r\nemptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever\r\nto happen.  He glanced about him at the unpruned garden, the\r\ntumble-down house, and the oak-grove under which the dusk was\r\ngathering.  It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to\r\nhave found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink\r\nsunshade was not hers ...\r\n\r\nHe frowned and hesitated.  "You don\'t know, I suppose--I shall be in\r\nBoston tomorrow.  If I could manage to see her--"\r\n\r\nHe felt that Miss Blenker was losing interest in him, though her smile\r\npersisted.  "Oh, of course; how lovely of you!  She\'s staying at the\r\nParker House; it must be horrible there in this weather."\r\n\r\nAfter that Archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they\r\nexchanged.  He could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that\r\nhe should await the returning family and have high tea with them before\r\nhe drove home.  At length, with his hostess still at his side, he\r\npassed out of range of the wooden Cupid, unfastened his horses and\r\ndrove off.  At the turn of the lane he saw Miss Blenker standing at the\r\ngate and waving the pink parasol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Archer got out of the Fall River train, he\r\nemerged upon a steaming midsummer Boston.  The streets near the station\r\nwere full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a\r\nshirt-sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of\r\nboarders going down the passage to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nArcher found a cab and drove to the Somerset Club for breakfast.  Even\r\nthe fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no\r\nexcess of heat ever degrades the European cities.  Care-takers in\r\ncalico lounged on the door-steps of the wealthy, and the Common looked\r\nlike a pleasure-ground on the morrow of a Masonic picnic.  If Archer\r\nhad tried to imagine Ellen Olenska in improbable scenes he could not\r\nhave called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than\r\nthis heat-prostrated and deserted Boston.\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted with appetite and method, beginning with a slice of\r\nmelon, and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and\r\nscrambled eggs.  A new sense of energy and activity had possessed him\r\never since he had announced to May the night before that he had\r\nbusiness in Boston, and should take the Fall River boat that night and\r\ngo on to New York the following evening.  It had always been understood\r\nthat he would return to town early in the week, and when he got back\r\nfrom his expedition to Portsmouth a letter from the office, which fate\r\nhad conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table, sufficed to\r\njustify his sudden change of plan.  He was even ashamed of the ease\r\nwith which the whole thing had been done: it reminded him, for an\r\nuncomfortable moment, of Lawrence Lefferts\'s masterly contrivances for\r\nsecuring his freedom.  But this did not long trouble him, for he was\r\nnot in an analytic mood.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the Commercial\r\nAdvertiser.  While he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came\r\nin, and the usual greetings were exchanged: it was the same world after\r\nall, though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the\r\nmeshes of time and space.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up\r\nand went into the writing-room.  There he wrote a few lines, and\r\nordered a messenger to take a cab to the Parker House and wait for the\r\nanswer.  He then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to\r\ncalculate how long it would take a cab to get to the Parker House.\r\n\r\n"The lady was out, sir," he suddenly heard a waiter\'s voice at his\r\nelbow; and he stammered:  "Out?--" as if it were a word in a strange\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nHe got up and went into the hall.  It must be a mistake: she could not\r\nbe out at that hour.  He flushed with anger at his own stupidity: why\r\nhad he not sent the note as soon as he arrived?\r\n\r\nHe found his hat and stick and went forth into the street.  The city\r\nhad suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a\r\ntraveller from distant lands.  For a moment he stood on the door-step\r\nhesitating; then he decided to go to the Parker House.  What if the\r\nmessenger had been misinformed, and she were still there?\r\n\r\nHe started to walk across the Common; and on the first bench, under a\r\ntree, he saw her sitting.  She had a grey silk sunshade over her\r\nhead--how could he ever have imagined her with a pink one?  As he\r\napproached he was struck by her listless attitude: she sat there as if\r\nshe had nothing else to do.  He saw her drooping profile, and the knot\r\nof hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat, and the long\r\nwrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade.  He came a step or\r\ntwo nearer, and she turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"Oh"--she said; and for the first time he noticed a startled look on\r\nher face; but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder\r\nand contentment.\r\n\r\n"Oh"--she murmured again, on a different note, as he stood looking down\r\nat her; and without rising she made a place for him on the bench.\r\n\r\n"I\'m here on business--just got here," Archer explained; and, without\r\nknowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her.\r\n"But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?"  He had really no\r\nidea what he was saying: he felt as if he were shouting at her across\r\nendless distances, and she might vanish again before he could overtake\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I?  Oh, I\'m here on business too," she answered, turning her head\r\ntoward him so that they were face to face.  The words hardly reached\r\nhim: he was aware only of her voice, and of the startling fact that not\r\nan echo of it had remained in his memory.  He had not even remembered\r\nthat it was low-pitched, with a faint roughness on the consonants.\r\n\r\n"You do your hair differently," he said, his heart beating as if he had\r\nuttered something irrevocable.\r\n\r\n"Differently?  No--it\'s only that I do it as best I can when I\'m\r\nwithout Nastasia."\r\n\r\n"Nastasia; but isn\'t she with you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m alone.  For two days it was not worth while to bring her."\r\n\r\n"You\'re alone--at the Parker House?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a flash of her old malice.  "Does it strike you\r\nas dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"No; not dangerous--"\r\n\r\n"But unconventional?  I see; I suppose it is."  She considered a\r\nmoment.  "I hadn\'t thought of it, because I\'ve just done something so\r\nmuch more unconventional." The faint tinge of irony lingered in her\r\neyes.  "I\'ve just refused to take back a sum of money--that belonged to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nArcher sprang up and moved a step or two away.  She had furled her\r\nparasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel.  Presently he\r\ncame back and stood before her.\r\n\r\n"Some one--has come here to meet you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"With this offer?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"And you refused--because of the conditions?"\r\n\r\n"I refused," she said after a moment.\r\n\r\nHe sat down by her again.  "What were the conditions?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they were not onerous: just to sit at the head of his table now\r\nand then."\r\n\r\nThere was another interval of silence.  Archer\'s heart had slammed\r\nitself shut in the queer way it had, and he sat vainly groping for a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"He wants you back--at any price?"\r\n\r\n"Well--a considerable price.  At least the sum is considerable for me."\r\n\r\nHe paused again, beating about the question he felt he must put.\r\n\r\n"It was to meet him here that you came?"\r\n\r\nShe stared, and then burst into a laugh.  "Meet him--my husband?  HERE?\r\nAt this season he\'s always at Cowes or Baden."\r\n\r\n"He sent some one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"With a letter?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.  "No; just a message.  He never writes.  I don\'t\r\nthink I\'ve had more than one letter from him."  The allusion brought\r\nthe colour to her cheek, and it reflected itself in Archer\'s vivid\r\nblush.\r\n\r\n"Why does he never write?"\r\n\r\n"Why should he?  What does one have secretaries for?"\r\n\r\nThe young man\'s blush deepened.  She had pronounced the word as if it\r\nhad no more significance than any other in her vocabulary.  For a\r\nmoment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask:  "Did he send his\r\nsecretary, then?"  But the remembrance of Count Olenski\'s only letter\r\nto his wife was too present to him.  He paused again, and then took\r\nanother plunge.\r\n\r\n"And the person?"--\r\n\r\n"The emissary?  The emissary," Madame Olenska rejoined, still smiling,\r\n"might, for all I care, have left already; but he has insisted on\r\nwaiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ..."\r\n\r\n"And you came out here to think the chance over?"\r\n\r\n"I came out to get a breath of air.  The hotel\'s too stifling.  I\'m\r\ntaking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth."\r\n\r\nThey sat silent, not looking at each other, but straight ahead at the\r\npeople passing along the path.  Finally she turned her eyes again to\r\nhis face and said:  "You\'re not changed."\r\n\r\nHe felt like answering:  "I was, till I saw you again;" but instead he\r\nstood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park.\r\n\r\n"This is horrible.  Why shouldn\'t we go out a little on the bay?\r\nThere\'s a breeze, and it will be cooler.  We might take the steamboat\r\ndown to Point Arley."  She glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went\r\non:  "On a Monday morning there won\'t be anybody on the boat.  My train\r\ndoesn\'t leave till evening: I\'m going back to New York.  Why shouldn\'t\r\nwe?" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out:\r\n"Haven\'t we done all we could?"\r\n\r\n"Oh"--she murmured again.  She stood up and reopened her sunshade,\r\nglancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure\r\nherself of the impossibility of remaining in it.  Then her eyes\r\nreturned to his face.  "You mustn\'t say things like that to me," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say anything you like; or nothing.  I won\'t open my mouth unless\r\nyou tell me to.  What harm can it do to anybody?  All I want is to\r\nlisten to you," he stammered.\r\n\r\nShe drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain.  "Oh,\r\ndon\'t calculate," he broke out; "give me the day!  I want to get you\r\naway from that man.  At what time was he coming?"\r\n\r\nHer colour rose again.  "At eleven."\r\n\r\n"Then you must come at once."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be afraid--if I don\'t come."\r\n\r\n"Nor you either--if you do.  I swear I only want to hear about you, to\r\nknow what you\'ve been doing.  It\'s a hundred years since we\'ve met--it\r\nmay be another hundred before we meet again."\r\n\r\nShe still wavered, her anxious eyes on his face.  "Why didn\'t you come\r\ndown to the beach to fetch me, the day I was at Granny\'s?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Because you didn\'t look round--because you didn\'t know I was there.  I\r\nswore I wouldn\'t unless you looked round."  He laughed as the\r\nchildishness of the confession struck him.\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t look round on purpose."\r\n\r\n"On purpose?"\r\n\r\n"I knew you were there; when you drove in I recognised the ponies.  So\r\nI went down to the beach."\r\n\r\n"To get away from me as far as you could?"\r\n\r\nShe repeated in a low voice:  "To get away from you as far as I could."\r\n\r\nHe laughed out again, this time in boyish satisfaction.  "Well, you see\r\nit\'s no use.  I may as well tell you," he added, "that the business I\r\ncame here for was just to find you.  But, look here, we must start or\r\nwe shall miss our boat."\r\n\r\n"Our boat?"  She frowned perplexedly, and then smiled.  "Oh, but I must\r\ngo back to the hotel first:  I must leave a note--"\r\n\r\n"As many notes as you please.  You can write here." He drew out a\r\nnote-case and one of the new stylographic pens.  "I\'ve even got an\r\nenvelope--you see how everything\'s predestined!  There--steady the\r\nthing on your knee, and I\'ll get the pen going in a second.  They have\r\nto be humoured; wait--"  He banged the hand that held the pen against\r\nthe back of the bench.  "It\'s like jerking down the mercury in a\r\nthermometer: just a trick.  Now try--"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on\r\nhis note-case, began to write.  Archer walked away a few steps, staring\r\nwith radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused\r\nto stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably-dressed lady writing a\r\nnote on her knee on a bench in the Common.\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope, wrote a name on it,\r\nand put it into her pocket.  Then she too stood up.\r\n\r\nThey walked back toward Beacon Street, and near the club Archer caught\r\nsight of the plush-lined "herdic" which had carried his note to the\r\nParker House, and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing\r\nhis brow at the corner hydrant.\r\n\r\n"I told you everything was predestined!  Here\'s a cab for us.  You\r\nsee!"  They laughed, astonished at the miracle of picking up a public\r\nconveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely spot, in a city where\r\ncab-stands were still a "foreign" novelty.\r\n\r\nArcher, looking at his watch, saw that there was time to drive to the\r\nParker House before going to the steamboat landing.  They rattled\r\nthrough the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel.\r\n\r\nArcher held out his hand for the letter.  "Shall I take it in?" he\r\nasked; but Madame Olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared\r\nthrough the glazed doors.  It was barely half-past ten; but what if the\r\nemissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how else to employ\r\nhis time, were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks\r\nat their elbows of whom Archer had caught a glimpse as she went in?\r\n\r\nHe waited, pacing up and down before the herdic.  A Sicilian youth with\r\neyes like Nastasia\'s offered to shine his boots, and an Irish matron to\r\nsell him peaches; and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot\r\nmen with straw hats tilted far back, who glanced at him as they went\r\nby.  He marvelled that the door should open so often, and that all the\r\npeople it let out should look so like each other, and so like all the\r\nother hot men who, at that hour, through the length and breadth of the\r\nland, were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of\r\nhotels.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, came a face that he could not relate to the other\r\nfaces.  He caught but a flash of it, for his pacings had carried him to\r\nthe farthest point of his beat, and it was in turning back to the hotel\r\nthat he saw, in a group of typical countenances--the lank and weary,\r\nthe round and surprised, the lantern-jawed and mild--this other face\r\nthat was so many more things at once, and things so different.  It was\r\nthat of a young man, pale too, and half-extinguished by the heat, or\r\nworry, or both, but somehow, quicker, vivider, more conscious; or\r\nperhaps seeming so because he was so different.  Archer hung a moment\r\non a thin thread of memory, but it snapped and floated off with the\r\ndisappearing face--apparently that of some foreign business man,\r\nlooking doubly foreign in such a setting.  He vanished in the stream of\r\npassersby, and Archer resumed his patrol.\r\n\r\nHe did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel, and\r\nhis unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that, if\r\nMadame Olenska was so long in reappearing, it could only be because she\r\nhad met the emissary and been waylaid by him.  At the thought Archer\'s\r\napprehension rose to anguish.\r\n\r\n"If she doesn\'t come soon I\'ll go in and find her," he said.\r\n\r\nThe doors swung open again and she was at his side.  They got into the\r\nherdic, and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had\r\nbeen absent just three minutes.  In the clatter of loose windows that\r\nmade talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to\r\nthe wharf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated side by side on a bench of the half-empty boat they found that\r\nthey had hardly anything to say to each other, or rather that what they\r\nhad to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their\r\nrelease and their isolation.\r\n\r\nAs the paddle-wheels began to turn, and wharves and shipping to recede\r\nthrough the veil of heat, it seemed to Archer that everything in the\r\nold familiar world of habit was receding also.  He longed to ask Madame\r\nOlenska if she did not have the same feeling: the feeling that they\r\nwere starting on some long voyage from which they might never return.\r\nBut he was afraid to say it, or anything else that might disturb the\r\ndelicate balance of her trust in him.  In reality he had no wish to\r\nbetray that trust.  There had been days and nights when the memory of\r\ntheir kiss had burned and burned on his lips; the day before even, on\r\nthe drive to Portsmouth, the thought of her had run through him like\r\nfire; but now that she was beside him, and they were drifting forth\r\ninto this unknown world, they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper\r\nnearness that a touch may sunder.\r\n\r\nAs the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about\r\nthem and the bay broke up into long oily undulations, then into ripples\r\ntipped with spray.  The fog of sultriness still hung over the city, but\r\nahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters, and distant promontories\r\nwith light-houses in the sun.  Madame Olenska, leaning back against the\r\nboat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips.  She had wound a\r\nlong veil about her hat, but it left her face uncovered, and Archer was\r\nstruck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression.  She seemed to take\r\ntheir adventure as a matter of course, and to be neither in fear of\r\nunexpected encounters, nor (what was worse) unduly elated by their\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nIn the bare dining-room of the inn, which he had hoped they would have\r\nto themselves, they found a strident party of innocent-looking young\r\nmen and women--school-teachers on a holiday, the landlord told\r\nthem--and Archer\'s heart sank at the idea of having to talk through\r\ntheir noise.\r\n\r\n"This is hopeless--I\'ll ask for a private room," he said; and Madame\r\nOlenska, without offering any objection, waited while he went in search\r\nof it.  The room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming\r\nin at the windows.  It was bare and cool, with a table covered with a\r\ncoarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a\r\nblueberry pie under a cage.  No more guileless-looking cabinet\r\nparticulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: Archer\r\nfancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile\r\nwith which Madame Olenska sat down opposite to him.  A woman who had\r\nrun away from her husband--and reputedly with another man--was likely\r\nto have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in\r\nthe quality of her composure took the edge from his irony.  By being so\r\nquiet, so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the\r\nconventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural\r\nthing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nThey lunched slowly and meditatively, with mute intervals between\r\nrushes of talk; for, the spell once broken, they had much to say, and\r\nyet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues\r\nof silence.  Archer kept the talk from his own affairs, not with\r\nconscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her\r\nhistory; and leaning on the table, her chin resting on her clasped\r\nhands, she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met.\r\n\r\nShe had grown tired of what people called "society"; New York was kind,\r\nit was almost oppressively hospitable; she should never forget the way\r\nin which it had welcomed her back; but after the first flush of novelty\r\nshe had found herself, as she phrased it, too "different" to care for\r\nthe things it cared about--and so she had decided to try Washington,\r\nwhere one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion.\r\nAnd on the whole she should probably settle down in Washington, and\r\nmake a home there for poor Medora, who had worn out the patience of all\r\nher other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after\r\nand protecting from matrimonial perils.\r\n\r\n"But Dr. Carver--aren\'t you afraid of Dr. Carver?  I hear he\'s been\r\nstaying with you at the Blenkers\'."\r\n\r\nShe smiled.  "Oh, the Carver danger is over.  Dr. Carver is a very\r\nclever man.  He wants a rich wife to finance his plans, and Medora is\r\nsimply a good advertisement as a convert."\r\n\r\n"A convert to what?"\r\n\r\n"To all sorts of new and crazy social schemes.  But, do you know, they\r\ninterest me more than the blind conformity to tradition--somebody\r\nelse\'s tradition--that I see among our own friends.  It seems stupid to\r\nhave discovered America only to make it into a copy of another\r\ncountry."  She smiled across the table.  "Do you suppose Christopher\r\nColumbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the Opera with\r\nthe Selfridge Merrys?"\r\n\r\nArcher changed colour.  "And Beaufort--do you say these things to\r\nBeaufort?" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen him for a long time.  But I used to; and he\r\nunderstands."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s what I\'ve always told you; you don\'t like us. And you like\r\nBeaufort because he\'s so unlike us." He looked about the bare room and\r\nout at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung\r\nalong the shore.  "We\'re damnably dull.  We\'ve no character, no colour,\r\nno variety.--I wonder," he broke out, "why you don\'t go back?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes darkened, and he expected an indignant rejoinder.  But she sat\r\nsilent, as if thinking over what he had said, and he grew frightened\r\nlest she should answer that she wondered too.\r\n\r\nAt length she said:  "I believe it\'s because of you."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately, or in a\r\ntone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed.  Archer\r\nreddened to the temples, but dared not move or speak: it was as if her\r\nwords had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive\r\noff on startled wings, but that might gather a flock about it if it\r\nwere left undisturbed.\r\n\r\n"At least," she continued, "it was you who made me understand that\r\nunder the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate\r\nthat even those I most cared for in my other life look cheap in\r\ncomparison.  I don\'t know how to explain myself"--she drew together her\r\ntroubled brows--"but it seems as if I\'d never before understood with\r\nhow much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures\r\nmay be paid."\r\n\r\n"Exquisite pleasures--it\'s something to have had them!" he felt like\r\nretorting; but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent.\r\n\r\n"I want," she went on, "to be perfectly honest with you--and with\r\nmyself.  For a long time I\'ve hoped this chance would come: that I\r\nmight tell you how you\'ve helped me, what you\'ve made of me--"\r\n\r\nArcher sat staring beneath frowning brows.  He interrupted her with a\r\nlaugh.  "And what do you make out that you\'ve made of me?"\r\n\r\nShe paled a little.  "Of you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: for I\'m of your making much more than you ever were of mine.  I\'m\r\nthe man who married one woman because another one told him to."\r\n\r\nHer paleness turned to a fugitive flush.  "I thought--you promised--you\r\nwere not to say such things today."\r\n\r\n"Ah--how like a woman!  None of you will ever see a bad business\r\nthrough!"\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice.  "IS it a bad business--for May?"\r\n\r\nHe stood in the window, drumming against the raised sash, and feeling\r\nin every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her\r\ncousin\'s name.\r\n\r\n"For that\'s the thing we\'ve always got to think of--haven\'t we--by your\r\nown showing?" she insisted.\r\n\r\n"My own showing?" he echoed, his blank eyes still on the sea.\r\n\r\n"Or if not," she continued, pursuing her own thought with a painful\r\napplication, "if it\'s not worth while to have given up, to have missed\r\nthings, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and\r\nmisery--then everything I came home for, everything that made my other\r\nlife seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took\r\naccount of them--all these things are a sham or a dream--"\r\n\r\nHe turned around without moving from his place.  "And in that case\r\nthere\'s no reason on earth why you shouldn\'t go back?" he concluded for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were clinging to him desperately.  "Oh, IS there no reason?"\r\n\r\n"Not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage.  My\r\nmarriage," he said savagely, "isn\'t going to be a sight to keep you\r\nhere."  She made no answer, and he went on:  "What\'s the use?  You gave\r\nme my first glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me\r\nto go on with a sham one.  It\'s beyond human enduring--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say that; when I\'m enduring it!" she burst out, her eyes\r\nfilling.\r\n\r\nHer arms had dropped along the table, and she sat with her face\r\nabandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril.\r\nThe face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person, with\r\nthe soul behind it: Archer stood dumb, overwhelmed by what it suddenly\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\n"You too--oh, all this time, you too?"\r\n\r\nFor answer, she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nHalf the width of the room was still between them, and neither made any\r\nshow of moving.  Archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her\r\nbodily presence: he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the\r\nhands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the\r\noccasion when, in the little Twenty-third Street house, he had kept his\r\neye on it in order not to look at her face.  Now his imagination spun\r\nabout the hand as about the edge of a vortex; but still he made no\r\neffort to draw nearer.  He had known the love that is fed on caresses\r\nand feeds them; but this passion that was closer than his bones was not\r\nto be superficially satisfied.  His one terror was to do anything which\r\nmight efface the sound and impression of her words; his one thought,\r\nthat he should never again feel quite alone.\r\n\r\nBut after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him.  There\r\nthey were, close together and safe and shut in; yet so chained to their\r\nseparate destinies that they might as well have been half the world\r\napart.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use--when you will go back?" he broke out, a great hopeless\r\nHOW ON EARTH CAN I KEEP YOU?  crying out to her beneath his words.\r\n\r\nShe sat motionless, with lowered lids.  "Oh--I shan\'t go yet!"\r\n\r\n"Not yet?  Some time, then?  Some time that you already foresee?"\r\n\r\nAt that she raised her clearest eyes.  "I promise you: not as long as\r\nyou hold out.  Not as long as we can look straight at each other like\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nHe dropped into his chair.  What her answer really said was:  "If you\r\nlift a finger you\'ll drive me back: back to all the abominations you\r\nknow of, and all the temptations you half guess."  He understood it as\r\nclearly as if she had uttered the words, and the thought kept him\r\nanchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n"What a life for you!--" he groaned.\r\n\r\n"Oh--as long as it\'s a part of yours."\r\n\r\n"And mine a part of yours?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s to be all--for either of us?"\r\n\r\n"Well; it IS all, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nAt that he sprang up, forgetting everything but the sweetness of her\r\nface.  She rose too, not as if to meet him or to flee from him, but\r\nquietly, as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to\r\nwait; so quietly that, as he came close, her outstretched hands acted\r\nnot as a check but as a guide to him.  They fell into his, while her\r\narms, extended but not rigid, kept him far enough off to let her\r\nsurrendered face say the rest.\r\n\r\nThey may have stood in that way for a long time, or only for a few\r\nmoments; but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she\r\nhad to say, and for him to feel that only one thing mattered.  He must\r\ndo nothing to make this meeting their last; he must leave their future\r\nin her care, asking only that she should keep fast hold of it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t--don\'t be unhappy," she said, with a break in her voice, as she\r\ndrew her hands away; and he answered:  "You won\'t go back--you won\'t go\r\nback?" as if it were the one possibility he could not bear.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go back," she said; and turning away she opened the door and\r\nled the way into the public dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe strident school-teachers were gathering up their possessions\r\npreparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf; across the beach lay\r\nthe white steam-boat at the pier; and over the sunlit waters Boston\r\nloomed in a line of haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nOnce more on the boat, and in the presence of others, Archer felt a\r\ntranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him.\r\n\r\nThe day, according to any current valuation, had been a rather\r\nridiculous failure; he had not so much as touched Madame Olenska\'s hand\r\nwith his lips, or extracted one word from her that gave promise of\r\nfarther opportunities.  Nevertheless, for a man sick with unsatisfied\r\nlove, and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his\r\npassion, he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted.  It\r\nwas the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others\r\nand their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet\r\ntranquillized him; a balance not artfully calculated, as her tears and\r\nher falterings showed, but resulting naturally from her unabashed\r\nsincerity.  It filled him with a tender awe, now the danger was over,\r\nand made him thank the fates that no personal vanity, no sense of\r\nplaying a part before sophisticated witnesses, had tempted him to tempt\r\nher.  Even after they had clasped hands for good-bye at the Fall River\r\nstation, and he had turned away alone, the conviction remained with him\r\nof having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed.\r\n\r\nHe wandered back to the club, and went and sat alone in the deserted\r\nlibrary, turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second\r\nof their hours together.  It was clear to him, and it grew more clear\r\nunder closer scrutiny, that if she should finally decide on returning\r\nto Europe--returning to her husband--it would not be because her old\r\nlife tempted her, even on the new terms offered.  No: she would go only\r\nif she felt herself becoming a temptation to Archer, a temptation to\r\nfall away from the standard they had both set up.  Her choice would be\r\nto stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it\r\ndepended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded.\r\n\r\nIn the train these thoughts were still with him.  They enclosed him in\r\na kind of golden haze, through which the faces about him looked remote\r\nand indistinct: he had a feeling that if he spoke to his\r\nfellow-travellers they would not understand what he was saying.  In\r\nthis state of abstraction he found himself, the following morning,\r\nwaking to the reality of a stifling September day in New York.  The\r\nheat-withered faces in the long train streamed past him, and he\r\ncontinued to stare at them through the same golden blur; but suddenly,\r\nas he left the station, one of the faces detached itself, came closer\r\nand forced itself upon his consciousness.  It was, as he instantly\r\nrecalled, the face of the young man he had seen, the day before,\r\npassing out of the Parker House, and had noted as not conforming to\r\ntype, as not having an American hotel face.\r\n\r\nThe same thing struck him now; and again he became aware of a dim stir\r\nof former associations.  The young man stood looking about him with the\r\ndazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of American\r\ntravel; then he advanced toward Archer, lifted his hat, and said in\r\nEnglish:  "Surely, Monsieur, we met in London?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure: in London!"  Archer grasped his hand with curiosity\r\nand sympathy.  "So you DID get here, after all?" he exclaimed, casting\r\na wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young\r\nCarfry\'s French tutor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I got here--yes," M. Riviere smiled with drawn lips.  "But not for\r\nlong; I return the day after tomorrow." He stood grasping his light\r\nvalise in one neatly gloved hand, and gazing anxiously, perplexedly,\r\nalmost appealingly, into Archer\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, Monsieur, since I\'ve had the good luck to run across you, if\r\nI might--"\r\n\r\n"I was just going to suggest it: come to luncheon, won\'t you?  Down\r\ntown, I mean: if you\'ll look me up in my office I\'ll take you to a very\r\ndecent restaurant in that quarter."\r\n\r\nM. Riviere was visibly touched and surprised.  "You\'re too kind.  But I\r\nwas only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of\r\nconveyance.  There are no porters, and no one here seems to listen--"\r\n\r\n"I know: our American stations must surprise you.  When you ask for a\r\nporter they give you chewing-gum.  But if you\'ll come along I\'ll\r\nextricate you; and you must really lunch with me, you know."\r\n\r\nThe young man, after a just perceptible hesitation, replied, with\r\nprofuse thanks, and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction,\r\nthat he was already engaged; but when they had reached the comparative\r\nreassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon.\r\n\r\nArcher, at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office, fixed an hour\r\nand scribbled his address, which the Frenchman pocketed with reiterated\r\nthanks and a wide flourish of his hat.  A horse-car received him, and\r\nArcher walked away.\r\n\r\nPunctually at the hour M. Riviere appeared, shaved, smoothed-out, but\r\nstill unmistakably drawn and serious.  Archer was alone in his office,\r\nand the young man, before accepting the seat he proffered, began\r\nabruptly: "I believe I saw you, sir, yesterday in Boston."\r\n\r\nThe statement was insignificant enough, and Archer was about to frame\r\nan assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet\r\nilluminating in his visitor\'s insistent gaze.\r\n\r\n"It is extraordinary, very extraordinary," M. Riviere continued, "that\r\nwe should have met in the circumstances in which I find myself."\r\n\r\n"What circumstances?" Archer asked, wondering a little crudely if he\r\nneeded money.\r\n\r\nM. Riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes.  "I have come,\r\nnot to look for employment, as I spoke of doing when we last met, but\r\non a special mission--"\r\n\r\n"Ah--!" Archer exclaimed.  In a flash the two meetings had connected\r\nthemselves in his mind.  He paused to take in the situation thus\r\nsuddenly lighted up for him, and M. Riviere also remained silent, as if\r\naware that what he had said was enough.\r\n\r\n"A special mission," Archer at length repeated.\r\n\r\nThe young Frenchman, opening his palms, raised them slightly, and the\r\ntwo men continued to look at each other across the office-desk till\r\nArcher roused himself to say:  "Do sit down"; whereupon M. Riviere\r\nbowed, took a distant chair, and again waited.\r\n\r\n"It was about this mission that you wanted to consult me?" Archer\r\nfinally asked.\r\n\r\nM. Riviere bent his head.  "Not in my own behalf: on that score I--I\r\nhave fully dealt with myself.  I should like--if I may--to speak to you\r\nabout the Countess Olenska."\r\n\r\nArcher had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming;\r\nbut when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he\r\nhad been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket.\r\n\r\n"And on whose behalf," he said, "do you wish to do this?"\r\n\r\nM. Riviere met the question sturdily.  "Well--I might say HERS, if it\r\ndid not sound like a liberty.  Shall I say instead: on behalf of\r\nabstract justice?"\r\n\r\nArcher considered him ironically.  "In other words: you are Count\r\nOlenski\'s messenger?"\r\n\r\nHe saw his blush more darkly reflected in M. Riviere\'s sallow\r\ncountenance.  "Not to YOU, Monsieur.  If I come to you, it is on quite\r\nother grounds."\r\n\r\n"What right have you, in the circumstances, to BE on any other ground?"\r\nArcher retorted.  "If you\'re an emissary you\'re an emissary."\r\n\r\nThe young man considered.  "My mission is over: as far as the Countess\r\nOlenska goes, it has failed."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that," Archer rejoined on the same note of irony.\r\n\r\n"No: but you can help--"  M. Riviere paused, turned his hat about in\r\nhis still carefully gloved hands, looked into its lining and then back\r\nat Archer\'s face.  "You can help, Monsieur, I am convinced, to make it\r\nequally a failure with her family."\r\n\r\nArcher pushed back his chair and stood up.  "Well--and by God I will!"\r\nhe exclaimed.  He stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down\r\nwrathfully at the little Frenchman, whose face, though he too had\r\nrisen, was still an inch or two below the line of Archer\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nM. Riviere paled to his normal hue: paler than that his complexion\r\ncould hardly turn.\r\n\r\n"Why the devil," Archer explosively continued, "should you have\r\nthought--since I suppose you\'re appealing to me on the ground of my\r\nrelationship to Madame Olenska--that I should take a view contrary to\r\nthe rest of her family?"\r\n\r\nThe change of expression in M. Riviere\'s face was for a time his only\r\nanswer.  His look passed from timidity to absolute distress: for a\r\nyoung man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult\r\nto appear more disarmed and defenceless.  "Oh, Monsieur--"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine," Archer continued, "why you should have come to me\r\nwhen there are others so much nearer to the Countess; still less why\r\nyou thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you\r\nwere sent over with."\r\n\r\nM. Riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility.  "The\r\narguments I want to present to you, Monsieur, are my own and not those\r\nI was sent over with."\r\n\r\n"Then I see still less reason for listening to them."\r\n\r\nM. Riviere again looked into his hat, as if considering whether these\r\nlast words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone.\r\nThen he spoke with sudden decision.  "Monsieur--will you tell me one\r\nthing?  Is it my right to be here that you question?  Or do you perhaps\r\nbelieve the whole matter to be already closed?"\r\n\r\nHis quiet insistence made Archer feel the clumsiness of his own\r\nbluster.  M. Riviere had succeeded in imposing himself:  Archer,\r\nreddening slightly, dropped into his chair again, and signed to the\r\nyoung man to be seated.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon: but why isn\'t the matter closed?"\r\n\r\nM. Riviere gazed back at him with anguish.  "You do, then, agree with\r\nthe rest of the family that, in face of the new proposals I have\r\nbrought, it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"Good God!" Archer exclaimed; and his visitor gave out a low murmur of\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\n"Before seeing her, I saw--at Count Olenski\'s request--Mr. Lovell\r\nMingott, with whom I had several talks before going to Boston.  I\r\nunderstand that he represents his mother\'s view; and that Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott\'s influence is great throughout her family."\r\n\r\nArcher sat silent, with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding\r\nprecipice.  The discovery that he had been excluded from a share in\r\nthese negotiations, and even from the knowledge that they were on foot,\r\ncaused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was\r\nlearning.  He saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult\r\nhim it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no\r\nlonger on their side; and he recalled, with a start of comprehension, a\r\nremark of May\'s during their drive home from Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s on\r\nthe day of the Archery Meeting:  "Perhaps, after all, Ellen would be\r\nhappier with her husband."\r\n\r\nEven in the tumult of new discoveries Archer remembered his indignant\r\nexclamation, and the fact that since then his wife had never named\r\nMadame Olenska to him.  Her careless allusion had no doubt been the\r\nstraw held up to see which way the wind blew; the result had been\r\nreported to the family, and thereafter Archer had been tacitly omitted\r\nfrom their counsels.  He admired the tribal discipline which made May\r\nbow to this decision.  She would not have done so, he knew, had her\r\nconscience protested; but she probably shared the family view that\r\nMadame Olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a\r\nseparated one, and that there was no use in discussing the case with\r\nNewland, who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the\r\nmost fundamental things for granted.\r\n\r\nArcher looked up and met his visitor\'s anxious gaze.  "Don\'t you know,\r\nMonsieur--is it possible you don\'t know--that the family begin to doubt\r\nif they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband\'s\r\nlast proposals?"\r\n\r\n"The proposals you brought?"\r\n\r\n"The proposals I brought."\r\n\r\nIt was on Archer\'s lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not\r\nknow was no concern of M. Riviere\'s; but something in the humble and\r\nyet courageous tenacity of M. Riviere\'s gaze made him reject this\r\nconclusion, and he met the young man\'s question with another.  "What is\r\nyour object in speaking to me of this?"\r\n\r\nHe had not to wait a moment for the answer.  "To beg you, Monsieur--to\r\nbeg you with all the force I\'m capable of--not to let her go back.--Oh,\r\ndon\'t let her!" M. Riviere exclaimed.\r\n\r\nArcher looked at him with increasing astonishment.  There was no\r\nmistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his\r\ndetermination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the\r\nboard but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record.  Archer\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n"May I ask," he said at length, "if this is the line you took with the\r\nCountess Olenska?"\r\n\r\nM. Riviere reddened, but his eyes did not falter.  "No, Monsieur: I\r\naccepted my mission in good faith.  I really believed--for reasons I\r\nneed not trouble you with--that it would be better for Madame Olenska\r\nto recover her situation, her fortune, the social consideration that\r\nher husband\'s standing gives her."\r\n\r\n"So I supposed: you could hardly have accepted such a mission\r\notherwise."\r\n\r\n"I should not have accepted it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then--?"  Archer paused again, and their eyes met in another\r\nprotracted scrutiny.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Monsieur, after I had seen her, after I had listened to her, I\r\nknew she was better off here."\r\n\r\n"You knew--?"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I discharged my mission faithfully: I put the Count\'s\r\narguments, I stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own.\r\nThe Countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her\r\ngoodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all I\r\nhad come to say.  And it was in the course of these two talks that I\r\nchanged my mind, that I came to see things differently."\r\n\r\n"May I ask what led to this change?"\r\n\r\n"Simply seeing the change in HER," M. Riviere replied.\r\n\r\n"The change in her?  Then you knew her before?"\r\n\r\nThe young man\'s colour again rose.  "I used to see her in her husband\'s\r\nhouse.  I have known Count Olenski for many years.  You can imagine\r\nthat he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission."\r\n\r\nArcher\'s gaze, wandering away to the blank walls of the office, rested\r\non a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the\r\nPresident of the United States.  That such a conversation should be\r\ngoing on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his\r\nrule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent.\r\n\r\n"The change--what sort of a change?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Monsieur, if I could tell you!"  M. Riviere paused.  "Tenez--the\r\ndiscovery, I suppose, of what I\'d never thought of before: that she\'s\r\nan American.  And that if you\'re an American of HER kind--of your\r\nkind--things that are accepted in certain other societies, or at least\r\nput up with as part of a general convenient give-and-take--become\r\nunthinkable, simply unthinkable.  If Madame Olenska\'s relations\r\nunderstood what these things were, their opposition to her returning\r\nwould no doubt be as unconditional as her own; but they seem to regard\r\nher husband\'s wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing\r\nfor domestic life."  M. Riviere paused, and then added:  "Whereas it\'s\r\nfar from being as simple as that."\r\n\r\nArcher looked back to the President of the United States, and then down\r\nat his desk and at the papers scattered on it.  For a second or two he\r\ncould not trust himself to speak.  During this interval he heard M.\r\nRiviere\'s chair pushed back, and was aware that the young man had\r\nrisen.  When he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," Archer said simply.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to thank me for, Monsieur: it is I, rather--"  M.\r\nRiviere broke off, as if speech for him too were difficult.  "I should\r\nlike, though," he continued in a firmer voice, "to add one thing.  You\r\nasked me if I was in Count Olenski\'s employ.  I am at this moment: I\r\nreturned to him, a few months ago, for reasons of private necessity\r\nsuch as may happen to any one who has persons, ill and older persons,\r\ndependent on him.  But from the moment that I have taken the step of\r\ncoming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged,\r\nand I shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons.  That\'s\r\nall, Monsieur."\r\n\r\nM. Riviere bowed and drew back a step.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," Archer said again, as their hands met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nEvery year on the fifteenth of October Fifth Avenue opened its\r\nshutters, unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of\r\nwindow-curtains.\r\n\r\nBy the first of November this household ritual was over, and society\r\nhad begun to look about and take stock of itself.  By the fifteenth the\r\nseason was in full blast, Opera and theatres were putting forth their\r\nnew attractions, dinner-engagements were accumulating, and dates for\r\ndances being fixed.  And punctually at about this time Mrs. Archer\r\nalways said that New York was very much changed.\r\n\r\nObserving it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was\r\nable, with the help of Mr. Sillerton Jackson and Miss Sophy, to trace\r\neach new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up\r\nbetween the ordered rows of social vegetables.  It had been one of the\r\namusements of Archer\'s youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of\r\nhis mother\'s, and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of\r\ndisintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked.  For New York, to\r\nMrs. Archer\'s mind, never changed without changing for the worse; and\r\nin this view Miss Sophy Jackson heartily concurred.\r\n\r\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, as became a man of the world, suspended his\r\njudgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations\r\nof the ladies.  But even he never denied that New York had changed; and\r\nNewland Archer, in the winter of the second year of his marriage, was\r\nhimself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was\r\ncertainly changing.\r\n\r\nThese points had been raised, as usual, at Mrs. Archer\'s Thanksgiving\r\ndinner.  At the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks\r\nfor the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful\r\nthough not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to\r\nbe thankful for.  At any rate, not the state of society; society, if it\r\ncould be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down\r\nBiblical imprecations--and in fact, every one knew what the Reverend\r\nDr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse\r\n25) for his Thanksgiving sermon.  Dr. Ashmore, the new Rector of St.\r\nMatthew\'s, had been chosen because he was very "advanced": his sermons\r\nwere considered bold in thought and novel in language.  When he\r\nfulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its "trend";\r\nand to Mrs. Archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel\r\nherself part of a community that was trending.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt that Dr. Ashmore is right: there IS a marked trend,"\r\nshe said, as if it were something visible and measurable, like a crack\r\nin a house.\r\n\r\n"It was odd, though, to preach about it on Thanksgiving," Miss Jackson\r\nopined; and her hostess drily rejoined:  "Oh, he means us to give\r\nthanks for what\'s left."\r\n\r\nArcher had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his\r\nmother\'s; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he\r\nlistened to an enumeration of the changes, that the "trend" was visible.\r\n\r\n"The extravagance in dress--" Miss Jackson began.  "Sillerton took me\r\nto the first night of the Opera, and I can only tell you that Jane\r\nMerry\'s dress was the only one I recognised from last year; and even\r\nthat had had the front panel changed.  Yet I know she got it out from\r\nWorth only two years ago, because my seamstress always goes in to make\r\nover her Paris dresses before she wears them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Jane Merry is one of US," said Mrs. Archer sighing, as if it were\r\nnot such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning\r\nto flaunt abroad their Paris dresses as soon as they were out of the\r\nCustom House, instead of letting them mellow under lock and key, in the\r\nmanner of Mrs. Archer\'s contemporaries.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she\'s one of the few.  In my youth," Miss Jackson rejoined, "it\r\nwas considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions; and Amy\r\nSillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away\r\none\'s Paris dresses for two years.  Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow, who did\r\neverything handsomely, used to import twelve a year, two velvet, two\r\nsatin, two silk, and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere.\r\nIt was a standing order, and as she was ill for two years before she\r\ndied they found forty-eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out\r\nof tissue paper; and when the girls left off their mourning they were\r\nable to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in\r\nadvance of the fashion."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, Boston is more conservative than New York; but I always\r\nthink it\'s a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for\r\none season," Mrs. Archer conceded.\r\n\r\n"It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap\r\nher new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived: I must say at\r\ntimes it takes all Regina\'s distinction not to look like ... like ..."\r\nMiss Jackson glanced around the table, caught Janey\'s bulging gaze, and\r\ntook refuge in an unintelligible murmur.\r\n\r\n"Like her rivals," said Mr. Sillerton Jackson, with the air of\r\nproducing an epigram.\r\n\r\n"Oh,--" the ladies murmured; and Mrs. Archer added, partly to distract\r\nher daughter\'s attention from forbidden topics:  "Poor Regina!  Her\r\nThanksgiving hasn\'t been a very cheerful one, I\'m afraid.  Have you\r\nheard the rumours about Beaufort\'s speculations, Sillerton?"\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson nodded carelessly.  Every one had heard the rumours in\r\nquestion, and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nA gloomy silence fell upon the party.  No one really liked Beaufort,\r\nand it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private\r\nlife; but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his\r\nwife\'s family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies.\r\nArcher\'s New York tolerated hypocrisy in private relations; but in\r\nbusiness matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty.  It was a\r\nlong time since any well-known banker had failed discreditably; but\r\nevery one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the\r\nfirm when the last event of the kind had happened.  It would be the\r\nsame with the Beauforts, in spite of his power and her popularity; not\r\nall the leagued strength of the Dallas connection would save poor\r\nRegina if there were any truth in the reports of her husband\'s unlawful\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nThe talk took refuge in less ominous topics; but everything they\r\ntouched on seemed to confirm Mrs. Archer\'s sense of an accelerated\r\ntrend.\r\n\r\n"Of course, Newland, I know you let dear May go to Mrs. Struthers\'s\r\nSunday evenings--" she began; and May interposed gaily:  "Oh, you know,\r\neverybody goes to Mrs. Struthers\'s now; and she was invited to Granny\'s\r\nlast reception."\r\n\r\nIt was thus, Archer reflected, that New York managed its transitions:\r\nconspiring to ignore them till they were well over, and then, in all\r\ngood faith, imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age.\r\nThere was always a traitor in the citadel; and after he (or generally\r\nshe) had surrendered the keys, what was the use of pretending that it\r\nwas impregnable?  Once people had tasted of Mrs. Struthers\'s easy\r\nSunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that\r\nher champagne was transmuted Shoe-Polish.\r\n\r\n"I know, dear, I know," Mrs. Archer sighed.  "Such things have to be, I\r\nsuppose, as long as AMUSEMENT is what people go out for; but I\'ve never\r\nquite forgiven your cousin Madame Olenska for being the first person to\r\ncountenance Mrs. Struthers."\r\n\r\nA sudden blush rose to young Mrs. Archer\'s face; it surprised her\r\nhusband as much as the other guests about the table.  "Oh, ELLEN--" she\r\nmurmured, much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which\r\nher parents might have said:  "Oh, THE BLENKERS--."\r\n\r\nIt was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention\r\nof the Countess Olenska\'s name, since she had surprised and\r\ninconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husband\'s advances;\r\nbut on May\'s lips it gave food for thought, and Archer looked at her\r\nwith the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was\r\nmost in the tone of her environment.\r\n\r\nHis mother, with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere, still\r\ninsisted:  "I\'ve always thought that people like the Countess Olenska,\r\nwho have lived in aristocratic societies, ought to help us to keep up\r\nour social distinctions, instead of ignoring them."\r\n\r\nMay\'s blush remained permanently vivid: it seemed to have a\r\nsignificance beyond that implied by the recognition of Madame Olenska\'s\r\nsocial bad faith.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners," said Miss Jackson\r\ntartly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Ellen cares for society; but nobody knows exactly what\r\nshe does care for," May continued, as if she had been groping for\r\nsomething noncommittal.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well--" Mrs. Archer sighed again.\r\n\r\nEverybody knew that the Countess Olenska was no longer in the good\r\ngraces of her family.  Even her devoted champion, old Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott, had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her\r\nhusband.  The Mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud:\r\ntheir sense of solidarity was too strong.  They had simply, as Mrs.\r\nWelland said, "let poor Ellen find her own level"--and that,\r\nmortifyingly and incomprehensibly, was in the dim depths where the\r\nBlenkers prevailed, and "people who wrote" celebrated their untidy\r\nrites.  It was incredible, but it was a fact, that Ellen, in spite of\r\nall her opportunities and her privileges, had become simply "Bohemian."\r\nThe fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in\r\nnot returning to Count Olenski.  After all, a young woman\'s place was\r\nunder her husband\'s roof, especially when she had left it in\r\ncircumstances that ... well ... if one had cared to look into them ...\r\n\r\n"Madame Olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen," said Miss\r\nSophy, with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when\r\nshe knew that she was planting a dart.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s the danger that a young woman like Madame Olenska is always\r\nexposed to," Mrs. Archer mournfully agreed; and the ladies, on this\r\nconclusion, gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the\r\ndrawing-room, while Archer and Mr. Sillerton Jackson withdrew to the\r\nGothic library.\r\n\r\nOnce established before the grate, and consoling himself for the\r\ninadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar, Mr. Jackson\r\nbecame portentous and communicable.\r\n\r\n"If the Beaufort smash comes," he announced, "there are going to be\r\ndisclosures."\r\n\r\nArcher raised his head quickly: he could never hear the name without\r\nthe sharp vision of Beaufort\'s heavy figure, opulently furred and shod,\r\nadvancing through the snow at Skuytercliff.\r\n\r\n"There\'s bound to be," Mr. Jackson continued, "the nastiest kind of a\r\ncleaning up.  He hasn\'t spent all his money on Regina."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--that\'s discounted, isn\'t it?  My belief is he\'ll pull out\r\nyet," said the young man, wanting to change the subject.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps--perhaps.  I know he was to see some of the influential people\r\ntoday.  Of course," Mr. Jackson reluctantly conceded, "it\'s to be hoped\r\nthey can tide him over--this time anyhow.  I shouldn\'t like to think of\r\npoor Regina\'s spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign\r\nwatering-place for bankrupts."\r\n\r\nArcher said nothing.  It seemed to him so natural--however tragic--that\r\nmoney ill-gotten should be cruelly expiated, that his mind, hardly\r\nlingering over Mrs. Beaufort\'s doom, wandered back to closer questions.\r\nWhat was the meaning of May\'s blush when the Countess Olenska had been\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\nFour months had passed since the midsummer day that he and Madame\r\nOlenska had spent together; and since then he had not seen her.  He\r\nknew that she had returned to Washington, to the little house which she\r\nand Medora Manson had taken there: he had written to her once--a few\r\nwords, asking when they were to meet again--and she had even more\r\nbriefly replied: "Not yet."\r\n\r\nSince then there had been no farther communication between them, and he\r\nhad built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned\r\namong his secret thoughts and longings.  Little by little it became the\r\nscene of his real life, of his only rational activities; thither he\r\nbrought the books he read, the ideas and feelings which nourished him,\r\nhis judgments and his visions.  Outside it, in the scene of his actual\r\nlife, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency,\r\nblundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view\r\nas an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own\r\nroom.  Absent--that was what he was: so absent from everything most\r\ndensely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him\r\nto find they still imagined he was there.\r\n\r\nHe became aware that Mr. Jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to\r\nfarther revelations.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, of course, how far your wife\'s family are aware of what\r\npeople say about--well, about Madame Olenska\'s refusal to accept her\r\nhusband\'s latest offer."\r\n\r\nArcher was silent, and Mr. Jackson obliquely continued: "It\'s a\r\npity--it\'s certainly a pity--that she refused it."\r\n\r\n"A pity?  In God\'s name, why?"\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it\r\nto a glossy pump.\r\n\r\n"Well--to put it on the lowest ground--what\'s she going to live on now?"\r\n\r\n"Now--?"\r\n\r\n"If Beaufort--"\r\n\r\nArcher sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the\r\nwriting-table.  The wells of the brass double-inkstand danced in their\r\nsockets.\r\n\r\n"What the devil do you mean, sir?"\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson, shifting himself slightly in his chair, turned a tranquil\r\ngaze on the young man\'s burning face.\r\n\r\n"Well--I have it on pretty good authority--in fact, on old Catherine\'s\r\nherself--that the family reduced Countess Olenska\'s allowance\r\nconsiderably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband; and\r\nas, by this refusal, she also forfeits the money settled on her when\r\nshe married--which Olenski was ready to make over to her if she\r\nreturned--why, what the devil do YOU mean, my dear boy, by asking me\r\nwhat I mean?" Mr. Jackson good-humouredly retorted.\r\n\r\nArcher moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes\r\ninto the grate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything of Madame Olenska\'s private affairs; but I don\'t\r\nneed to, to be certain that what you insinuate--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t: it\'s Lefferts, for one," Mr. Jackson interposed.\r\n\r\n"Lefferts--who made love to her and got snubbed for it!" Archer broke\r\nout contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Ah--DID he?" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he\r\nhad been laying a trap for.  He still sat sideways from the fire, so\r\nthat his hard old gaze held Archer\'s face as if in a spring of steel.\r\n\r\n"Well, well: it\'s a pity she didn\'t go back before Beaufort\'s cropper,"\r\nhe repeated.  "If she goes NOW, and if he fails, it will only confirm\r\nthe general impression: which isn\'t by any means peculiar to Lefferts,\r\nby the way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she won\'t go back now: less than ever!"  Archer had no sooner said\r\nit than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what Mr.\r\nJackson had been waiting for.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman considered him attentively.  "That\'s your opinion,\r\neh?  Well, no doubt you know.  But everybody will tell you that the few\r\npennies Medora Manson has left are all in Beaufort\'s hands; and how the\r\ntwo women are to keep their heads above water unless he does, I can\'t\r\nimagine.  Of course, Madame Olenska may still soften old Catherine,\r\nwho\'s been the most inexorably opposed to her staying; and old\r\nCatherine could make her any allowance she chooses.  But we all know\r\nthat she hates parting with good money; and the rest of the family have\r\nno particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here."\r\n\r\nArcher was burning with unavailing wrath: he was exactly in the state\r\nwhen a man is sure to do something stupid, knowing all the while that\r\nhe is doing it.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Mr. Jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that\r\nMadame Olenska\'s differences with her grandmother and her other\r\nrelations were not known to him, and that the old gentleman had drawn\r\nhis own conclusions as to the reasons for Archer\'s exclusion from the\r\nfamily councils.  This fact warned Archer to go warily; but the\r\ninsinuations about Beaufort made him reckless.  He was mindful,\r\nhowever, if not of his own danger, at least of the fact that Mr.\r\nJackson was under his mother\'s roof, and consequently his guest.  Old\r\nNew York scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality, and no\r\ndiscussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go up and join my mother?" he suggested curtly, as Mr.\r\nJackson\'s last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nOn the drive homeward May remained oddly silent; through the darkness,\r\nhe still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush.  What its menace\r\nmeant he could not guess: but he was sufficiently warned by the fact\r\nthat Madame Olenska\'s name had evoked it.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs, and he turned into the library.  She usually\r\nfollowed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom.\r\n\r\n"May!" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight\r\nglance of surprise at his tone.\r\n\r\n"This lamp is smoking again; I should think the servants might see that\r\nit\'s kept properly trimmed," he grumbled nervously.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry: it shan\'t happen again," she answered, in the firm\r\nbright tone she had learned from her mother; and it exasperated Archer\r\nto feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger Mr.\r\nWelland.  She bent over to lower the wick, and as the light struck up\r\non her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought:\r\n"How young she is!  For what endless years this life will have to go\r\non!"\r\n\r\nHe felt, with a kind of horror, his own strong youth and the bounding\r\nblood in his veins.  "Look here," he said suddenly, "I may have to go\r\nto Washington for a few days--soon; next week perhaps."\r\n\r\nHer hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly.\r\nThe heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face, but it\r\npaled as she looked up.\r\n\r\n"On business?" she asked, in a tone which implied that there could be\r\nno other conceivable reason, and that she had put the question\r\nautomatically, as if merely to finish his own sentence.\r\n\r\n"On business, naturally.  There\'s a patent case coming up before the\r\nSupreme Court--"  He gave the name of the inventor, and went on\r\nfurnishing details with all Lawrence Lefferts\'s practised glibness,\r\nwhile she listened attentively, saying at intervals:  "Yes, I see."\r\n\r\n"The change will do you good," she said simply, when he had finished;\r\n"and you must be sure to go and see Ellen," she added, looking him\r\nstraight in the eyes with her cloudless smile, and speaking in the tone\r\nshe might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome\r\nfamily duty.\r\n\r\nIt was the only word that passed between them on the subject; but in\r\nthe code in which they had both been trained it meant:  "Of course you\r\nunderstand that I know all that people have been saying about Ellen,\r\nand heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to\r\nreturn to her husband.  I also know that, for some reason you have not\r\nchosen to tell me, you have advised her against this course, which all\r\nthe older men of the family, as well as our grandmother, agree in\r\napproving; and that it is owing to your encouragement that Ellen defies\r\nus all, and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which Mr.\r\nSillerton Jackson probably gave you, this evening, the hint that has\r\nmade you so irritable....  Hints have indeed not been wanting; but\r\nsince you appear unwilling to take them from others, I offer you this\r\none myself, in the only form in which well-bred people of our kind can\r\ncommunicate unpleasant things to each other: by letting you understand\r\nthat I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington, and are\r\nperhaps going there expressly for that purpose; and that, since you are\r\nsure to see her, I wish you to do so with my full and explicit\r\napproval--and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the\r\ncourse of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to."\r\n\r\nHer hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this\r\nmute message reached him.  She turned the wick down, lifted off the\r\nglobe, and breathed on the sulky flame.\r\n\r\n"They smell less if one blows them out," she explained, with her bright\r\nhousekeeping air.  On the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nWall Street, the next day, had more reassuring reports of Beaufort\'s\r\nsituation.  They were not definite, but they were hopeful.  It was\r\ngenerally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case\r\nof emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening,\r\nwhen Mrs. Beaufort appeared at the Opera wearing her old smile and a\r\nnew emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief.\r\n\r\nNew York was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities.\r\nSo far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who\r\nbroke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even\r\nBeaufort and Beaufort\'s wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this\r\nprinciple.  But to be obliged to offer them up would be not only\r\npainful but inconvenient.  The disappearance of the Beauforts would\r\nleave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who\r\nwere too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe\r\nbewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in New York.\r\n\r\nArcher had definitely made up his mind to go to Washington.  He was\r\nwaiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to\r\nMay, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday he learned from Mr. Letterblair that the case might\r\nbe postponed for several weeks.  Nevertheless, he went home that\r\nafternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening.  The\r\nchances were that May, who knew nothing of his professional life, and\r\nhad never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the\r\npostponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the\r\nlitigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could\r\nno longer put off seeing Madame Olenska.  There were too many things\r\nthat he must say to her.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday morning, when he reached his office, Mr. Letterblair\r\nmet him with a troubled face.  Beaufort, after all, had not managed to\r\n"tide over"; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he\r\nhad reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the\r\nbank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to\r\npredominate.  In consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its\r\ndoors were likely to close before the day was over.  The ugliest things\r\nwere being said of Beaufort\'s dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure\r\npromised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of Wall\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the calamity left Mr. Letterblair white and\r\nincapacitated.  "I\'ve seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as\r\nthis.  Everybody we know will be hit, one way or another.  And what\r\nwill be done about Mrs. Beaufort?  What CAN be done about her?  I pity\r\nMrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there\'s no\r\nknowing what effect this affair may have on her.  She always believed\r\nin Beaufort--she made a friend of him!  And there\'s the whole Dallas\r\nconnection: poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you.  Her\r\nonly chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her\r\nso?  Her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been\r\nblind to his private weaknesses."\r\n\r\nThere was a knock, and Mr. Letterblair turned his head sharply.  "What\r\nis it?  I can\'t be disturbed."\r\n\r\nA clerk brought in a letter for Archer and withdrew.  Recognising his\r\nwife\'s hand, the young man opened the envelope and read:  "Won\'t you\r\nplease come up town as early as you can?  Granny had a slight stroke\r\nlast night.  In some mysterious way she found out before any one else\r\nthis awful news about the bank.  Uncle Lovell is away shooting, and the\r\nidea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a\r\ntemperature and can\'t leave his room.  Mamma needs you dreadfully, and\r\nI do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny\'s."\r\n\r\nArcher handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later\r\nwas crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at\r\nFourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth\r\nAvenue line.  It was after twelve o\'clock when this laborious vehicle\r\ndropped him at old Catherine\'s.  The sitting-room window on the ground\r\nfloor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure\r\nof her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she\r\ncaught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May.  The hall\r\nwore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly\r\ninvaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a\r\ndoctor\'s bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters\r\nand cards had already piled up unheeded.\r\n\r\nMay looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the\r\nsecond time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott\'s dauntless\r\ndetermination to live and get well was already having an effect on her\r\nfamily.  May led Archer into the old lady\'s sitting-room, where the\r\nsliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the\r\nheavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland\r\ncommunicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the\r\ncatastrophe.  It appeared that the evening before something dreadful\r\nand mysterious had happened.  At about eight o\'clock, just after Mrs.\r\nMingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after\r\ndinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the\r\nservants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received.\r\n\r\nThe butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room\r\ndoor, announcing:  "Mrs. Julius Beaufort"--and had then closed it again\r\non the two ladies.  They must have been together, he thought, about an\r\nhour.  When Mrs. Mingott\'s bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped\r\naway unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone\r\nin her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room.\r\nShe seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete\r\ncontrol of her body and brain.  The mulatto maid put her to bed,\r\nbrought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the\r\nroom, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again,\r\nand the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old\r\nCatherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting\r\nup against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little\r\nhand hanging limp from its huge arm.\r\n\r\nThe stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to\r\narticulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor\'s\r\nfirst visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles.  But\r\nthe alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation\r\nwhen it was gathered from Mrs. Mingott\'s fragmentary phrases that\r\nRegina Beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up\r\nher husband, see them through--not to "desert" them, as she called\r\nit--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their\r\nmonstrous dishonour.\r\n\r\n"I said to her:  \'Honour\'s always been honour, and honesty honesty, in\r\nManson Mingott\'s house, and will be till I\'m carried out of it feet\r\nfirst,\'" the old woman had stammered into her daughter\'s ear, in the\r\nthick voice of the partly paralysed.  "And when she said:  \'But my\r\nname, Auntie--my name\'s Regina Dallas,\' I said:  \'It was Beaufort when\r\nhe covered you with jewels, and it\'s got to stay Beaufort now that he\'s\r\ncovered you with shame.\'"\r\n\r\nSo much, with tears and gasps of horror, Mrs. Welland imparted,\r\nblanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to\r\nfix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable.  "If only I could\r\nkeep it from your father-in-law: he always says: \'Augusta, for pity\'s\r\nsake, don\'t destroy my last illusions\'--and how am I to prevent his\r\nknowing these horrors?" the poor lady wailed.\r\n\r\n"After all, Mamma, he won\'t have SEEN them," her daughter suggested;\r\nand Mrs. Welland sighed:  "Ah, no; thank heaven he\'s safe in bed.  And\r\nDr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better,\r\nand Regina has been got away somewhere."\r\n\r\nArcher had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at\r\nthe deserted thoroughfare.  It was evident that he had been summoned\r\nrather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any\r\nspecific aid that he could render.  Mr. Lovell Mingott had been\r\ntelegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the\r\nmembers of the family living in New York; and meanwhile there was\r\nnothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of\r\nBeaufort\'s dishonour and of his wife\'s unjustifiable action.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lovell Mingott, who had been in another room writing notes,\r\npresently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion.  In THEIR\r\nday, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything\r\ndisgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to\r\ndisappear with him.  "There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer;\r\nyour great-grandmother, May.  Of course," Mrs. Welland hastened to add,\r\n"your great-grandfather\'s money difficulties were private--losses at\r\ncards, or signing a note for somebody--I never quite knew, because\r\nMamma would never speak of it.  But she was brought up in the country\r\nbecause her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever\r\nit was: they lived up the Hudson alone, winter and summer, till Mamma\r\nwas sixteen.  It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask\r\nthe family to \'countenance\' her, as I understand Regina calls it;\r\nthough a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining\r\nhundreds of innocent people."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance\r\nthan to talk about other people\'s," Mrs. Lovell Mingott agreed.  "I\r\nunderstand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday\r\nhad been sent on approval from Ball and Black\'s in the afternoon.  I\r\nwonder if they\'ll ever get it back?"\r\n\r\nArcher listened unmoved to the relentless chorus.  The idea of absolute\r\nfinancial probity as the first law of a gentleman\'s code was too deeply\r\ningrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it.  An\r\nadventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his\r\nShoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty\r\nwas the noblesse oblige of old financial New York.  Nor did Mrs.\r\nBeaufort\'s fate greatly move Archer.  He felt, no doubt, more sorry for\r\nher than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie\r\nbetween husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be\r\nindissoluble in misfortune.  As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife\'s\r\nplace was at her husband\'s side when he was in trouble; but society\'s\r\nplace was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort\'s cool assumption that it\r\nwas seemed almost to make her his accomplice.  The mere idea of a\r\nwoman\'s appealing to her family to screen her husband\'s business\r\ndishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family,\r\nas an institution, could not do.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto maid called Mrs. Lovell Mingott into the hall, and the\r\nlatter came back in a moment with a frowning brow.\r\n\r\n"She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska.  I had written to Ellen,\r\nof course, and to Medora; but now it seems that\'s not enough.  I\'m to\r\ntelegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she\'s to come alone."\r\n\r\nThe announcement was received in silence.  Mrs. Welland sighed\r\nresignedly, and May rose from her seat and went to gather up some\r\nnewspapers that had been scattered on the floor.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it must be done," Mrs. Lovell Mingott continued, as if\r\nhoping to be contradicted; and May turned back toward the middle of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Of course it must be done," she said.  "Granny knows what she wants,\r\nand we must carry out all her wishes.  Shall I write the telegram for\r\nyou, Auntie?  If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow\r\nmorning\'s train."  She pronounced the syllables of the name with a\r\npeculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells.\r\n\r\n"Well, it can\'t go at once.  Jasper and the pantry-boy are both out\r\nwith notes and telegrams."\r\n\r\nMay turned to her husband with a smile.  "But here\'s Newland, ready to\r\ndo anything.  Will you take the telegram, Newland?  There\'ll be just\r\ntime before luncheon."\r\n\r\nArcher rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old\r\nCatherine\'s rosewood "Bonheur du Jour," and wrote out the message in\r\nher large immature hand.  When it was written she blotted it neatly and\r\nhanded it to Archer.\r\n\r\n"What a pity," she said, "that you and Ellen will cross each other on\r\nthe way!--Newland," she added, turning to her mother and aunt, "is\r\nobliged to go to Washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up\r\nbefore the Supreme Court.  I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by\r\ntomorrow night, and with Granny improving so much it doesn\'t seem right\r\nto ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nShe paused, as if for an answer, and Mrs. Welland hastily declared:\r\n"Oh, of course not, darling.  Your Granny would be the last person to\r\nwish it."  As Archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his\r\nmother-in-law add, presumably to Mrs. Lovell Mingott:  "But why on\r\nearth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska--" and May\'s\r\nclear voice rejoin:  "Perhaps it\'s to urge on her again that after all\r\nher duty is with her husband."\r\n\r\nThe outer door closed on Archer and he walked hastily away toward the\r\ntelegraph office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\n"Ol-ol--howjer spell it, anyhow?" asked the tart young lady to whom\r\nArcher had pushed his wife\'s telegram across the brass ledge of the\r\nWestern Union office.\r\n\r\n"Olenska--O-len-ska," he repeated, drawing back the message in order to\r\nprint out the foreign syllables above May\'s rambling script.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an unlikely name for a New York telegraph office; at least in\r\nthis quarter," an unexpected voice observed; and turning around Archer\r\nsaw Lawrence Lefferts at his elbow, pulling an imperturbable moustache\r\nand affecting not to glance at the message.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Newland: thought I\'d catch you here.  I\'ve just heard of old\r\nMrs. Mingott\'s stroke; and as I was on my way to the house I saw you\r\nturning down this street and nipped after you.  I suppose you\'ve come\r\nfrom there?"\r\n\r\nArcher nodded, and pushed his telegram under the lattice.\r\n\r\n"Very bad, eh?" Lefferts continued.  "Wiring to the family, I suppose.\r\nI gather it IS bad, if you\'re including Countess Olenska."\r\n\r\nArcher\'s lips stiffened; he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into\r\nthe long vain handsome face at his side.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he questioned.\r\n\r\nLefferts, who was known to shrink from discussion, raised his eye-brows\r\nwith an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel\r\nbehind the lattice.  Nothing could be worse "form" the look reminded\r\nArcher, than any display of temper in a public place.\r\n\r\nArcher had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form; but\r\nhis impulse to do Lawrence Lefferts a physical injury was only\r\nmomentary.  The idea of bandying Ellen Olenska\'s name with him at such\r\na time, and on whatsoever provocation, was unthinkable.  He paid for\r\nhis telegram, and the two young men went out together into the street.\r\nThere Archer, having regained his self-control, went on:  "Mrs. Mingott\r\nis much better: the doctor feels no anxiety whatever"; and Lefferts,\r\nwith profuse expressions of relief, asked him if he had heard that\r\nthere were beastly bad rumours again about Beaufort....\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the announcement of the Beaufort failure was in all the\r\npapers.  It overshadowed the report of Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s stroke,\r\nand only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the\r\ntwo events thought of ascribing old Catherine\'s illness to anything but\r\nthe accumulation of flesh and years.\r\n\r\nThe whole of New York was darkened by the tale of Beaufort\'s dishonour.\r\nThere had never, as Mr. Letterblair said, been a worse case in his\r\nmemory, nor, for that matter, in the memory of the far-off Letterblair\r\nwho had given his name to the firm.  The bank had continued to take in\r\nmoney for a whole day after its failure was inevitable; and as many of\r\nits clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans, Beaufort\'s\r\nduplicity seemed doubly cynical.  If Mrs. Beaufort had not taken the\r\ntone that such misfortunes (the word was her own) were "the test of\r\nfriendship," compassion for her might have tempered the general\r\nindignation against her husband.  As it was--and especially after the\r\nobject of her nocturnal visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott had become\r\nknown--her cynicism was held to exceed his; and she had not the\r\nexcuse--nor her detractors the satisfaction--of pleading that she was\r\n"a foreigner."  It was some comfort (to those whose securities were not\r\nin jeopardy) to be able to remind themselves that Beaufort WAS; but,\r\nafter all, if a Dallas of South Carolina took his view of the case, and\r\nglibly talked of his soon being "on his feet again," the argument lost\r\nits edge, and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence\r\nof the indissolubility of marriage.  Society must manage to get on\r\nwithout the Beauforts, and there was an end of it--except indeed for\r\nsuch hapless victims of the disaster as Medora Manson, the poor old\r\nMiss Lannings, and certain other misguided ladies of good family who,\r\nif only they had listened to Mr. Henry van der Luyden ...\r\n\r\n"The best thing the Beauforts can do," said Mrs. Archer, summing it up\r\nas if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of\r\ntreatment, "is to go and live at Regina\'s little place in North\r\nCarolina.  Beaufort has always kept a racing stable, and he had better\r\nbreed trotting horses.  I should say he had all the qualities of a\r\nsuccessful horsedealer."  Every one agreed with her, but no one\r\ncondescended to enquire what the Beauforts really meant to do.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mrs. Manson Mingott was much better: she recovered her\r\nvoice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the\r\nBeauforts to her again, and asked--when Dr. Bencomb appeared--what in\r\nthe world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health.\r\n\r\n"If people of my age WILL eat chicken-salad in the evening what are\r\nthey to expect?" she enquired; and, the doctor having opportunely\r\nmodified her dietary, the stroke was transformed into an attack of\r\nindigestion.  But in spite of her firm tone old Catherine did not\r\nwholly recover her former attitude toward life.  The growing remoteness\r\nof old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her\r\nneighbours, had blunted her never very lively compassion for their\r\ntroubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort\r\ndisaster out of her mind.  But for the first time she became absorbed\r\nin her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in\r\ncertain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been\r\ncontemptuously indifferent.\r\n\r\nMr. Welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her notice.\r\nOf her sons-in-law he was the one she had most consistently ignored;\r\nand all his wife\'s efforts to represent him as a man of forceful\r\ncharacter and marked intellectual ability (if he had only "chosen") had\r\nbeen met with a derisive chuckle.  But his eminence as a valetudinarian\r\nnow made him an object of engrossing interest, and Mrs. Mingott issued\r\nan imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his\r\ntemperature permitted; for old Catherine was now the first to recognise\r\nthat one could not be too careful about temperatures.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after Madame Olenska\'s summons a telegram announced\r\nthat she would arrive from Washington on the evening of the following\r\nday.  At the Wellands\', where the Newland Archers chanced to be\r\nlunching, the question as to who should meet her at Jersey City was\r\nimmediately raised; and the material difficulties amid which the\r\nWelland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent\r\nanimation to the debate.  It was agreed that Mrs. Welland could not\r\npossibly go to Jersey City because she was to accompany her husband to\r\nold Catherine\'s that afternoon, and the brougham could not be spared,\r\nsince, if Mr. Welland were "upset" by seeing his mother-in-law for the\r\nfirst time after her attack, he might have to be taken home at a\r\nmoment\'s notice.  The Welland sons would of course be "down town," Mr.\r\nLovell Mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting, and the\r\nMingott carriage engaged in meeting him; and one could not ask May, at\r\nthe close of a winter afternoon, to go alone across the ferry to Jersey\r\nCity, even in her own carriage.  Nevertheless, it might appear\r\ninhospitable--and contrary to old Catherine\'s express wishes--if Madame\r\nOlenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the\r\nstation to receive her.  It was just like Ellen, Mrs. Welland\'s tired\r\nvoice implied, to place the family in such a dilemma.  "It\'s always one\r\nthing after another," the poor lady grieved, in one of her rare revolts\r\nagainst fate; "the only thing that makes me think Mamma must be less\r\nwell than Dr. Bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have Ellen\r\ncome at once, however inconvenient it is to meet her."\r\n\r\nThe words had been thoughtless, as the utterances of impatience often\r\nare; and Mr. Welland was upon them with a pounce.\r\n\r\n"Augusta," he said, turning pale and laying down his fork, "have you\r\nany other reason for thinking that Bencomb is less to be relied on than\r\nhe was?  Have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than\r\nusual in following up my case or your mother\'s?"\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Welland\'s turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of\r\nher blunder unrolled themselves before her; but she managed to laugh,\r\nand take a second helping of scalloped oysters, before she said,\r\nstruggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness: "My dear, how\r\ncould you imagine such a thing?  I only meant that, after the decided\r\nstand Mamma took about its being Ellen\'s duty to go back to her\r\nhusband, it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden\r\nwhim to see her, when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that\r\nshe might have asked for.  But we must never forget that Mamma, in\r\nspite of her wonderful vitality, is a very old woman."\r\n\r\nMr. Welland\'s brow remained clouded, and it was evident that his\r\nperturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark.  "Yes:\r\nyour mother\'s a very old woman; and for all we know Bencomb may not be\r\nas successful with very old people.  As you say, my dear, it\'s always\r\none thing after another; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose\r\nI shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor.  It\'s\r\nalways better to make such a change before it\'s absolutely necessary."\r\nAnd having arrived at this Spartan decision Mr. Welland firmly took up\r\nhis fork.\r\n\r\n"But all the while," Mrs. Welland began again, as she rose from the\r\nluncheon-table, and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and\r\nmalachite known as the back drawing-room, "I don\'t see how Ellen\'s to\r\nbe got here tomorrow evening; and I do like to have things settled for\r\nat least twenty-four hours ahead."\r\n\r\nArcher turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting\r\nrepresenting two Cardinals carousing, in an octagonal ebony frame set\r\nwith medallions of onyx.\r\n\r\n"Shall I fetch her?" he proposed.  "I can easily get away from the\r\noffice in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if May will send it\r\nthere."  His heart was beating excitedly as he spoke.\r\n\r\nMrs. Welland heaved a sigh of gratitude, and May, who had moved away to\r\nthe window, turned to shed on him a beam of approval.  "So you see,\r\nMamma, everything WILL be settled twenty-four hours in advance," she\r\nsaid, stooping over to kiss her mother\'s troubled forehead.\r\n\r\nMay\'s brougham awaited her at the door, and she was to drive Archer to\r\nUnion Square, where he could pick up a Broadway car to carry him to the\r\noffice.  As she settled herself in her corner she said:  "I didn\'t want\r\nto worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet Ellen\r\ntomorrow, and bring her back to New York, when you\'re going to\r\nWashington?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not going," Archer answered.\r\n\r\n"Not going?  Why, what\'s happened?"  Her voice was as clear as a bell,\r\nand full of wifely solicitude.\r\n\r\n"The case is off--postponed."\r\n\r\n"Postponed?  How odd!  I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair\r\nto Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big\r\npatent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court.  You said it\r\nwas a patent case, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well--that\'s it: the whole office can\'t go.  Letterblair decided to go\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s NOT postponed?" she continued, with an insistence so unlike\r\nher that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing\r\nfor her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies.\r\n\r\n"No: but my going is," he answered, cursing the unnecessary\r\nexplanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of\r\ngoing to Washington, and wondering where he had read that clever liars\r\ngive details, but that the cleverest do not.  It did not hurt him half\r\nas much to tell May an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she\r\nhad not detected him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your\r\nfamily," he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.  As he spoke he\r\nfelt that she was looking at him, and he turned his eyes to hers in\r\norder not to appear to be avoiding them.  Their glances met for a\r\nsecond, and perhaps let them into each other\'s meanings more deeply\r\nthan either cared to go.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it IS awfully convenient," May brightly agreed, "that you should\r\nbe able to meet Ellen after all; you saw how much Mamma appreciated\r\nyour offering to do it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m delighted to do it."  The carriage stopped, and as he jumped\r\nout she leaned to him and laid her hand on his.  "Good-bye, dearest,"\r\nshe said, her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone\r\non him through tears.\r\n\r\nHe turned away and hurried across Union Square, repeating to himself,\r\nin a sort of inward chant:  "It\'s all of two hours from Jersey City to\r\nold Catherine\'s.  It\'s all of two hours--and it may be more."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nHis wife\'s dark blue brougham (with the wedding varnish still on it)\r\nmet Archer at the ferry, and conveyed him luxuriously to the\r\nPennsylvania terminus in Jersey City.\r\n\r\nIt was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big\r\nreverberating station.  As he paced the platform, waiting for the\r\nWashington express, he remembered that there were people who thought\r\nthere would one day be a tunnel under the Hudson through which the\r\ntrains of the Pennsylvania railway would run straight into New York.\r\nThey were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the\r\nbuilding of ships that would cross the Atlantic in five days, the\r\ninvention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic\r\ncommunication without wires, and other Arabian Night marvels.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care which of their visions comes true," Archer mused, "as\r\nlong as the tunnel isn\'t built yet."  In his senseless school-boy\r\nhappiness he pictured Madame Olenska\'s descent from the train, his\r\ndiscovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless\r\nfaces, her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage, their\r\nslow approach to the wharf among slipping horses, laden carts,\r\nvociferating teamsters, and then the startling quiet of the ferry-boat,\r\nwhere they would sit side by side under the snow, in the motionless\r\ncarriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to\r\nthe other side of the sun.  It was incredible, the number of things he\r\nhad to say to her, and in what eloquent order they were forming\r\nthemselves on his lips ...\r\n\r\nThe clanging and groaning of the train came nearer, and it staggered\r\nslowly into the station like a prey-laden monster into its lair.\r\nArcher pushed forward, elbowing through the crowd, and staring blindly\r\ninto window after window of the high-hung carriages.  And then,\r\nsuddenly, he saw Madame Olenska\'s pale and surprised face close at\r\nhand, and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what\r\nshe looked like.\r\n\r\nThey reached each other, their hands met, and he drew her arm through\r\nhis.  "This way--I have the carriage," he said.\r\n\r\nAfter that it all happened as he had dreamed.  He helped her into the\r\nbrougham with her bags, and had afterward the vague recollection of\r\nhaving properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a\r\nsummary of the Beaufort situation (he was struck by the softness of\r\nher:  "Poor Regina!").  Meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out\r\nof the coil about the station, and they were crawling down the slippery\r\nincline to the wharf, menaced by swaying coal-carts, bewildered horses,\r\ndishevelled express-wagons, and an empty hearse--ah, that hearse!  She\r\nshut her eyes as it passed, and clutched at Archer\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"If only it doesn\'t mean--poor Granny!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no--she\'s much better--she\'s all right, really.  There--we\'ve\r\npassed it!" he exclaimed, as if that made all the difference.  Her hand\r\nremained in his, and as the carriage lurched across the gang-plank onto\r\nthe ferry he bent over, unbuttoned her tight brown glove, and kissed\r\nher palm as if he had kissed a relic.  She disengaged herself with a\r\nfaint smile, and he said: "You didn\'t expect me today?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"I meant to go to Washington to see you.  I\'d made all my\r\narrangements--I very nearly crossed you in the train."\r\n\r\n"Oh--" she exclaimed, as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape.\r\n\r\n"Do you know--I hardly remembered you?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly remembered me?"\r\n\r\n"I mean: how shall I explain?  I--it\'s always so.  EACH TIME YOU HAPPEN\r\nTO ME ALL OVER AGAIN."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes: I know!  I know!"\r\n\r\n"Does it--do I too: to you?" he insisted.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, looking out of the window.\r\n\r\n"Ellen--Ellen--Ellen!"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, and he sat in silence, watching her profile grow\r\nindistinct against the snow-streaked dusk beyond the window.  What had\r\nshe been doing in all those four long months, he wondered?  How little\r\nthey knew of each other, after all!  The precious moments were slipping\r\naway, but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her\r\nand could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and\r\ntheir proximity, which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their\r\nsitting so close to each other, and yet being unable to see each\r\nother\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"What a pretty carriage!  Is it May\'s?" she asked, suddenly turning her\r\nface from the window.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"It was May who sent you to fetch me, then?  How kind of her!"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for a moment; then he said explosively:  "Your\r\nhusband\'s secretary came to see me the day after we met in Boston."\r\n\r\nIn his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to M. Riviere\'s\r\nvisit, and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom.\r\nBut her reminder that they were in his wife\'s carriage provoked him to\r\nan impulse of retaliation.  He would see if she liked his reference to\r\nRiviere any better than he liked hers to May!  As on certain other\r\noccasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure,\r\nshe betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded:  "He writes\r\nto her, then."\r\n\r\n"M. Riviere went to see you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: didn\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered simply.\r\n\r\n"And you\'re not surprised?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.  "Why should I be?  He told me in Boston that he knew\r\nyou; that he\'d met you in England I think."\r\n\r\n"Ellen--I must ask you one thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to ask it after I saw him, but I couldn\'t put it in a letter.\r\nIt was Riviere who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?"\r\n\r\nHis heart was beating suffocatingly.  Would she meet this question with\r\nthe same composure?\r\n\r\n"Yes: I owe him a great debt," she answered, without the least tremor\r\nin her quiet voice.\r\n\r\nHer tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that Archer\'s turmoil\r\nsubsided.  Once more she had managed, by her sheer simplicity, to make\r\nhim feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging\r\nconvention to the winds.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re the most honest woman I ever met!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--but probably one of the least fussy," she answered, a smile in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n"Call it what you like: you look at things as they are."\r\n\r\n"Ah--I\'ve had to.  I\'ve had to look at the Gorgon."\r\n\r\n"Well--it hasn\'t blinded you!  You\'ve seen that she\'s just an old bogey\r\nlike all the others."\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t blind one; but she dries up one\'s tears."\r\n\r\nThe answer checked the pleading on Archer\'s lips: it seemed to come\r\nfrom depths of experience beyond his reach.  The slow advance of the\r\nferry-boat had ceased, and her bows bumped against the piles of the\r\nslip with a violence that made the brougham stagger, and flung Archer\r\nand Madame Olenska against each other.  The young man, trembling, felt\r\nthe pressure of her shoulder, and passed his arm about her.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re not blind, then, you must see that this can\'t last."\r\n\r\n"What can\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Our being together--and not together."\r\n\r\n"No.  You ought not to have come today," she said in an altered voice;\r\nand suddenly she turned, flung her arms about him and pressed her lips\r\nto his.  At the same moment the carriage began to move, and a gas-lamp\r\nat the head of the slip flashed its light into the window.  She drew\r\naway, and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled\r\nthrough the congestion of carriages about the ferry-landing.  As they\r\ngained the street Archer began to speak hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid of me: you needn\'t squeeze yourself back into your\r\ncorner like that.  A stolen kiss isn\'t what I want.  Look: I\'m not even\r\ntrying to touch the sleeve of your jacket.  Don\'t suppose that I don\'t\r\nunderstand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us\r\ndwindle into an ordinary hole-and-corner love-affair.  I couldn\'t have\r\nspoken like this yesterday, because when we\'ve been apart, and I\'m\r\nlooking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great\r\nflame.  But then you come; and you\'re so much more than I remembered,\r\nand what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now\r\nand then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit\r\nperfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my\r\nmind, just quietly trusting to it to come true."\r\n\r\nFor a moment she made no reply; then she asked, hardly above a whisper:\r\n"What do you mean by trusting to it to come true?"\r\n\r\n"Why--you know it will, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Your vision of you and me together?"  She burst into a sudden hard\r\nlaugh.  "You choose your place well to put it to me!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean because we\'re in my wife\'s brougham?  Shall we get out and\r\nwalk, then?  I don\'t suppose you mind a little snow?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again, more gently.  "No; I shan\'t get out and walk,\r\nbecause my business is to get to Granny\'s as quickly as I can.  And\r\nyou\'ll sit beside me, and we\'ll look, not at visions, but at realities."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by realities.  The only reality to me is\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nShe met the words with a long silence, during which the carriage rolled\r\ndown an obscure side-street and then turned into the searching\r\nillumination of Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n"Is it your idea, then, that I should live with you as your\r\nmistress--since I can\'t be your wife?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe crudeness of the question startled him: the word was one that women\r\nof his class fought shy of, even when their talk flitted closest about\r\nthe topic.  He noticed that Madame Olenska pronounced it as if it had a\r\nrecognised place in her vocabulary, and he wondered if it had been used\r\nfamiliarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from.  Her\r\nquestion pulled him up with a jerk, and he floundered.\r\n\r\n"I want--I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words\r\nlike that--categories like that--won\'t exist.  Where we shall be simply\r\ntwo human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each\r\nother; and nothing else on earth will matter."\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh.  "Oh, my dear--where\r\nis that country?  Have you ever been there?" she asked; and as he\r\nremained sullenly dumb she went on:  "I know so many who\'ve tried to\r\nfind it; and, believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside\r\nstations: at places like Boulogne, or Pisa, or Monte Carlo--and it\r\nwasn\'t at all different from the old world they\'d left, but only rather\r\nsmaller and dingier and more promiscuous."\r\n\r\nHe had never heard her speak in such a tone, and he remembered the\r\nphrase she had used a little while before.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Gorgon HAS dried your tears," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, she opened my eyes too; it\'s a delusion to say that she blinds\r\npeople.  What she does is just the contrary--she fastens their eyelids\r\nopen, so that they\'re never again in the blessed darkness.  Isn\'t there\r\na Chinese torture like that?  There ought to be.  Ah, believe me, it\'s\r\na miserable little country!"\r\n\r\nThe carriage had crossed Forty-second Street: May\'s sturdy\r\nbrougham-horse was carrying them northward as if he had been a Kentucky\r\ntrotter.  Archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words.\r\n\r\n"Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"For US?  But there\'s no US in that sense!  We\'re near each other only\r\nif we stay far from each other.  Then we can be ourselves.  Otherwise\r\nwe\'re only Newland Archer, the husband of Ellen Olenska\'s cousin, and\r\nEllen Olenska, the cousin of Newland Archer\'s wife, trying to be happy\r\nbehind the backs of the people who trust them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m beyond that," he groaned.\r\n\r\n"No, you\'re not!  You\'ve never been beyond.  And I have," she said, in\r\na strange voice, "and I know what it looks like there."\r\n\r\nHe sat silent, dazed with inarticulate pain.  Then he groped in the\r\ndarkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to\r\nthe coachman.  He remembered that May rang twice when she wished to\r\nstop.  He pressed the bell, and the carriage drew up beside the\r\ncurbstone.\r\n\r\n"Why are we stopping?  This is not Granny\'s," Madame Olenska exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"No: I shall get out here," he stammered, opening the door and jumping\r\nto the pavement.  By the light of a street-lamp he saw her startled\r\nface, and the instinctive motion she made to detain him.  He closed the\r\ndoor, and leaned for a moment in the window.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right: I ought not to have come today," he said, lowering his\r\nvoice so that the coachman should not hear.  She bent forward, and\r\nseemed about to speak; but he had already called out the order to drive\r\non, and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner.  The\r\nsnow was over, and a tingling wind had sprung up, that lashed his face\r\nas he stood gazing.  Suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his\r\nlashes, and perceived that he had been crying, and that the wind had\r\nfrozen his tears.\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hands in his pockets, and walked at a sharp pace down\r\nFifth Avenue to his own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nThat evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the\r\ndrawing-room empty.\r\n\r\nHe and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been\r\npostponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s illness; and as May was the more\r\npunctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him.  He\r\nknew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving\r\nabout in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.\r\n\r\nHe had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means\r\nof tying his thoughts fast to reality.  Sometimes he felt as if he had\r\nfound the clue to his father-in-law\'s absorption in trifles; perhaps\r\neven Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had\r\nconjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.\r\n\r\nWhen May appeared he thought she looked tired.  She had put on the\r\nlow-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the Mingott ceremonial\r\nexacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair\r\ninto its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan\r\nand almost faded.  But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and\r\nher eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.\r\n\r\n"What became of you, dear?" she asked.  "I was waiting at Granny\'s, and\r\nEllen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you\r\nhad to rush off on business.  There\'s nothing wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Only some letters I\'d forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner."\r\n\r\n"Ah--" she said; and a moment afterward:  "I\'m sorry you didn\'t come to\r\nGranny\'s--unless the letters were urgent."\r\n\r\n"They were," he rejoined, surprised at her insistence.  "Besides, I\r\ndon\'t see why I should have gone to your grandmother\'s.  I didn\'t know\r\nyou were there."\r\n\r\nShe turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece.  As\r\nshe stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped\r\nfrom its place in her intricate hair, Archer was struck by something\r\nlanguid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly\r\nmonotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also.  Then he\r\nremembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called\r\nover the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother\'s so that\r\nthey might drive home together.  He had called back a cheery "Yes!" and\r\nthen, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise.  Now he was\r\nsmitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission\r\nshould be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage.  He\r\nwas weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the\r\ntemperature of passion yet with all its exactions.  If May had spoken\r\nout her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed\r\nthem away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a\r\nSpartan smile.\r\n\r\nTo disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she\r\nanswered that Mrs. Mingott was still improving, but had been rather\r\ndisturbed by the last news about the Beauforts.\r\n\r\n"What news?"\r\n\r\n"It seems they\'re going to stay in New York.  I believe he\'s going into\r\nan insurance business, or something.  They\'re looking about for a small\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nThe preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went\r\nin to dinner.  During dinner their talk moved in its usual limited\r\ncircle; but Archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to Madame\r\nOlenska, nor to old Catherine\'s reception of her.  He was thankful for\r\nthe fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous.\r\n\r\nThey went up to the library for coffee, and Archer lit a cigar and took\r\ndown a volume of Michelet.  He had taken to history in the evenings\r\nsince May had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she\r\nsaw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his\r\nown voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he\r\nread.  In the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now\r\nperceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide\r\nher with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results\r\ndestructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on.\r\n\r\nSeeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up\r\nan arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion\r\nshe was embroidering for his sofa.  She was not a clever needle-woman;\r\nher large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air\r\nactivities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their\r\nhusbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion.\r\n\r\nShe was so placed that Archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see\r\nher bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back\r\nfrom her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left\r\nhand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and\r\nlaboriously stabbing the canvas.  As she sat thus, the lamplight full\r\non her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he\r\nwould always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years\r\nto come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a\r\nweakness, a cruelty or an emotion.  She had spent her poetry and\r\nromance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the\r\nneed was past.  Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother,\r\nand mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr.\r\nWelland.  He laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once\r\nshe raised her head.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"The room is stifling: I want a little air."\r\n\r\nHe had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and\r\nforward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead\r\nof remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over\r\nlayers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and\r\npushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night.  The mere fact of\r\nnot looking at May, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact\r\nof seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other\r\nlives outside his own, other cities beyond New York, and a whole world\r\nbeyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe.\r\n\r\nAfter he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard\r\nher say:  "Newland!  Do shut the window.  You\'ll catch your death."\r\n\r\nHe pulled the sash down and turned back.  "Catch my death!" he echoed;\r\nand he felt like adding:  "But I\'ve caught it already.  I AM dead--I\'ve\r\nbeen dead for months and months."\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion.  What\r\nif it were SHE who was dead!  If she were going to die--to die\r\nsoon--and leave him free!  The sensation of standing there, in that\r\nwarm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so\r\nstrange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not\r\nimmediately strike him.  He simply felt that chance had given him a new\r\npossibility to which his sick soul might cling.  Yes, May might\r\ndie--people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might\r\ndie, and set him suddenly free.\r\n\r\nShe glanced up, and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be\r\nsomething strange in his own.\r\n\r\n"Newland!  Are you ill?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and turned toward his arm-chair.  She bent over her\r\nwork-frame, and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair.  "Poor May!"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"Poor?  Why poor?" she echoed with a strained laugh.\r\n\r\n"Because I shall never be able to open a window without worrying you,"\r\nhe rejoined, laughing also.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was silent; then she said very low, her head bowed\r\nover her work:  "I shall never worry if you\'re happy."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear; and I shall never be happy unless I can open the windows!"\r\n\r\n"In THIS weather?" she remonstrated; and with a sigh he buried his head\r\nin his book.\r\n\r\nSix or seven days passed.  Archer heard nothing from Madame Olenska,\r\nand became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence\r\nby any member of the family.  He did not try to see her; to do so while\r\nshe was at old Catherine\'s guarded bedside would have been almost\r\nimpossible.  In the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift,\r\nconscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve\r\nwhich had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window\r\ninto the icy night.  The strength of that resolve made it easy to wait\r\nand make no sign.\r\n\r\nThen one day May told him that Mrs. Manson Mingott had asked to see\r\nhim.  There was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was\r\nsteadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she\r\npreferred Archer to any of her other grandsons-in-law.  May gave the\r\nmessage with evident pleasure: she was proud of old Catherine\'s\r\nappreciation of her husband.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s pause, and then Archer felt it incumbent on him to\r\nsay:  "All right.  Shall we go together this afternoon?"\r\n\r\nHis wife\'s face brightened, but she instantly answered: "Oh, you\'d much\r\nbetter go alone.  It bores Granny to see the same people too often."\r\n\r\nArcher\'s heart was beating violently when he rang old Mrs. Mingott\'s\r\nbell.  He had wanted above all things to go alone, for he felt sure the\r\nvisit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the\r\nCountess Olenska.  He had determined to wait till the chance presented\r\nitself naturally; and here it was, and here he was on the doorstep.\r\nBehind the door, behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to\r\nthe hall, she was surely awaiting him; in another moment he should see\r\nher, and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sick-room.\r\n\r\nHe wanted only to put one question: after that his course would be\r\nclear.  What he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to\r\nWashington; and that question she could hardly refuse to answer.\r\n\r\nBut in the yellow sitting-room it was the mulatto maid who waited.  Her\r\nwhite teeth shining like a keyboard, she pushed back the sliding doors\r\nand ushered him into old Catherine\'s presence.\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat in a vast throne-like arm-chair near her bed.  Beside\r\nher was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved\r\nglobe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced.  There was not\r\na book or a newspaper in reach, nor any evidence of feminine\r\nemployment: conversation had always been Mrs. Mingott\'s sole pursuit,\r\nand she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork.\r\n\r\nArcher saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke.  She\r\nmerely looked paler, with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of\r\nher obesity; and, in the fluted mob-cap tied by a starched bow between\r\nher first two chins, and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing\r\npurple dressing-gown, she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress\r\nof her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nShe held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her\r\nhuge lap like pet animals, and called to the maid:  "Don\'t let in any\r\none else.  If my daughters call, say I\'m asleep."\r\n\r\nThe maid disappeared, and the old lady turned to her grandson.\r\n\r\n"My dear, am I perfectly hideous?" she asked gaily, launching out one\r\nhand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom.  "My\r\ndaughters tell me it doesn\'t matter at my age--as if hideousness didn\'t\r\nmatter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you\'re handsomer than ever!" Archer rejoined in the same\r\ntone; and she threw back her head and laughed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but not as handsome as Ellen!" she jerked out, twinkling at him\r\nmaliciously; and before he could answer she added:  "Was she so awfully\r\nhandsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and she continued:  "Was it because you told her so that\r\nshe had to put you out on the way?  In my youth young men didn\'t desert\r\npretty women unless they were made to!"  She gave another chuckle, and\r\ninterrupted it to say almost querulously:  "It\'s a pity she didn\'t\r\nmarry you; I always told her so.  It would have spared me all this\r\nworry.  But who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry?"\r\n\r\nArcher wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly\r\nshe broke out:  "Well, it\'s settled, anyhow: she\'s going to stay with\r\nme, whatever the rest of the family say!  She hadn\'t been here five\r\nminutes before I\'d have gone down on my knees to keep her--if only, for\r\nthe last twenty years, I\'d been able to see where the floor was!"\r\n\r\nArcher listened in silence, and she went on:  "They\'d talked me over,\r\nas no doubt you know: persuaded me, Lovell, and Letterblair, and\r\nAugusta Welland, and all the rest of them, that I must hold out and cut\r\noff her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go\r\nback to Olenski.  They thought they\'d convinced me when the secretary,\r\nor whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome\r\nproposals I confess they were.  After all, marriage is marriage, and\r\nmoney\'s money--both useful things in their way ... and I didn\'t know\r\nwhat to answer--"  She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking\r\nhad become an effort.  "But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said:\r\n\'You sweet bird, you!  Shut you up in that cage again?  Never!\'  And\r\nnow it\'s settled that she\'s to stay here and nurse her Granny as long\r\nas there\'s a Granny to nurse.  It\'s not a gay prospect, but she doesn\'t\r\nmind; and of course I\'ve told Letterblair that she\'s to be given her\r\nproper allowance."\r\n\r\nThe young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind\r\nhe hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain.  He had so\r\ndefinitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment\r\nhe could not readjust his thoughts.  But gradually there stole over him\r\nthe delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities\r\nmiraculously provided.  If Ellen had consented to come and live with\r\nher grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the\r\nimpossibility of giving him up.  This was her answer to his final\r\nappeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had\r\nurged, she had at last yielded to half-measures.  He sank back into the\r\nthought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk\r\neverything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security.\r\n\r\n"She couldn\'t have gone back--it was impossible!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear, I always knew you were on her side; and that\'s why I sent\r\nfor you today, and why I said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to\r\ncome with you: \'No, my dear, I\'m pining to see Newland, and I don\'t\r\nwant anybody to share our transports.\'  For you see, my dear--" she\r\ndrew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked\r\nhim full in the eyes--"you see, we shall have a fight yet.  The family\r\ndon\'t want her here, and they\'ll say it\'s because I\'ve been ill,\r\nbecause I\'m a weak old woman, that she\'s persuaded me.  I\'m not well\r\nenough yet to fight them one by one, and you\'ve got to do it for me."\r\n\r\n"I?" he stammered.\r\n\r\n"You.  Why not?" she jerked back at him, her round eyes suddenly as\r\nsharp as pen-knives.  Her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on\r\nhis with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws.  "Why not?" she\r\nsearchingly repeated.\r\n\r\nArcher, under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t count--I\'m too insignificant."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re Letterblair\'s partner, ain\'t you?  You\'ve got to get at\r\nthem through Letterblair.  Unless you\'ve got a reason," she insisted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, I back you to hold your own against them all without my\r\nhelp; but you shall have it if you need it," he reassured her.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'re safe!" she sighed; and smiling on him with all her ancient\r\ncunning she added, as she settled her head among the cushions:  "I\r\nalways knew you\'d back us up, because they never quote you when they\r\ntalk about its being her duty to go home."\r\n\r\nHe winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity, and longed to ask:\r\n"And May--do they quote her?"  But he judged it safer to turn the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"And Madame Olenska?  When am I to see her?" he said.\r\n\r\nThe old lady chuckled, crumpled her lids, and went through the\r\npantomime of archness.  "Not today.  One at a time, please.  Madame\r\nOlenska\'s gone out."\r\n\r\nHe flushed with disappointment, and she went on: "She\'s gone out, my\r\nchild: gone in my carriage to see Regina Beaufort."\r\n\r\nShe paused for this announcement to produce its effect.  "That\'s what\r\nshe\'s reduced me to already.  The day after she got here she put on her\r\nbest bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to\r\ncall on Regina Beaufort.  \'I don\'t know her; who is she?\' says I.\r\n\'She\'s your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,\' she says.  \'She\'s\r\nthe wife of a scoundrel,\' I answered.  \'Well,\' she says, \'and so am I,\r\nand yet all my family want me to go back to him.\'  Well, that floored\r\nme, and I let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too\r\nhard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage.\r\n\'What for?\' I asked her; and she said: \'To go and see cousin\r\nRegina\'--COUSIN!  Now, my dear, I looked out of the window, and saw it\r\nwasn\'t raining a drop; but I understood her, and I let her have the\r\ncarriage....  After all, Regina\'s a brave woman, and so is she; and\r\nI\'ve always liked courage above everything."\r\n\r\nArcher bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay\r\non his.\r\n\r\n"Eh--eh--eh!  Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young\r\nman--your wife\'s, I hope?" the old lady snapped out with her mocking\r\ncackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him:  "Give her her\r\nGranny\'s love; but you\'d better not say anything about our talk."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nArcher had been stunned by old Catherine\'s news.  It was only natural\r\nthat Madame Olenska should have hastened from Washington in response to\r\nher grandmother\'s summons; but that she should have decided to remain\r\nunder her roof--especially now that Mrs. Mingott had almost regained\r\nher health--was less easy to explain.\r\n\r\nArcher was sure that Madame Olenska\'s decision had not been influenced\r\nby the change in her financial situation.  He knew the exact figure of\r\nthe small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation.\r\nWithout the addition of her grandmother\'s allowance it was hardly\r\nenough to live on, in any sense known to the Mingott vocabulary; and\r\nnow that Medora Manson, who shared her life, had been ruined, such a\r\npittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed.  Yet Archer\r\nwas convinced that Madame Olenska had not accepted her grandmother\'s\r\noffer from interested motives.\r\n\r\nShe had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of\r\npersons used to large fortunes, and indifferent to money; but she could\r\ngo without many things which her relations considered indispensable,\r\nand Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Welland had often been heard to\r\ndeplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of Count\r\nOlenski\'s establishments should care so little about "how things were\r\ndone."  Moreover, as Archer knew, several months had passed since her\r\nallowance had been cut off; yet in the interval she had made no effort\r\nto regain her grandmother\'s favour.  Therefore if she had changed her\r\ncourse it must be for a different reason.\r\n\r\nHe did not have far to seek for that reason.  On the way from the ferry\r\nshe had told him that he and she must remain apart; but she had said it\r\nwith her head on his breast.  He knew that there was no calculated\r\ncoquetry in her words; she was fighting her fate as he had fought his,\r\nand clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break\r\nfaith with the people who trusted them.  But during the ten days which\r\nhad elapsed since her return to New York she had perhaps guessed from\r\nhis silence, and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her,\r\nthat he was meditating a decisive step, a step from which there was no\r\nturning back.  At the thought, a sudden fear of her own weakness might\r\nhave seized her, and she might have felt that, after all, it was better\r\nto accept the compromise usual in such cases, and follow the line of\r\nleast resistance.\r\n\r\nAn hour earlier, when he had rung Mrs. Mingott\'s bell, Archer had\r\nfancied that his path was clear before him.  He had meant to have a\r\nword alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her\r\ngrandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to\r\nWashington.  In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her\r\nto Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go.  His own\r\nfancy inclined to Japan.  At any rate she would understand at once\r\nthat, wherever she went, he was going.  He meant to leave a note for\r\nMay that should cut off any other alternative.\r\n\r\nHe had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to\r\ntake it; yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was\r\nchanged had been one of relief.  Now, however, as he walked home from\r\nMrs. Mingott\'s, he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay\r\nbefore him.  There was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was\r\npresumably to tread; but when he had trodden it before it was as a free\r\nman, who was accountable to no one for his actions, and could lend\r\nhimself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and\r\nprevarications, concealments and compliances, that the part required.\r\nThis procedure was called "protecting a woman\'s honour"; and the best\r\nfiction, combined with the after-dinner talk of his elders, had long\r\nsince initiated him into every detail of its code.\r\n\r\nNow he saw the matter in a new light, and his part in it seemed\r\nsingularly diminished.  It was, in fact, that which, with a secret\r\nfatuity, he had watched Mrs. Thorley Rushworth play toward a fond and\r\nunperceiving husband: a smiling, bantering, humouring, watchful and\r\nincessant lie.  A lie by day, a lie by night, a lie in every touch and\r\nevery look; a lie in every caress and every quarrel; a lie in every\r\nword and in every silence.\r\n\r\nIt was easier, and less dastardly on the whole, for a wife to play such\r\na part toward her husband.  A woman\'s standard of truthfulness was\r\ntacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in\r\nthe arts of the enslaved.  Then she could always plead moods and\r\nnerves, and the right not to be held too strictly to account; and even\r\nin the most strait-laced societies the laugh was always against the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nBut in Archer\'s little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a\r\ncertain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their\r\nphilandering after marriage.  In the rotation of crops there was a\r\nrecognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nArcher had always shared this view: in his heart he thought Lefferts\r\ndespicable.  But to love Ellen Olenska was not to become a man like\r\nLefferts: for the first time Archer found himself face to face with the\r\ndread argument of the individual case.  Ellen Olenska was like no other\r\nwoman, he was like no other man: their situation, therefore, resembled\r\nno one else\'s, and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of\r\ntheir own judgment.\r\n\r\nYes, but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep; and\r\nthere were May, and habit, and honour, and all the old decencies that\r\nhe and his people had always believed in ...\r\n\r\nAt his corner he hesitated, and then walked on down Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nAhead of him, in the winter night, loomed a big unlit house.  As he\r\ndrew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights, its\r\nsteps awninged and carpeted, and carriages waiting in double line to\r\ndraw up at the curbstone.  It was in the conservatory that stretched\r\nits dead-black bulk down the side street that he had taken his first\r\nkiss from May; it was under the myriad candles of the ball-room that he\r\nhad seen her appear, tall and silver-shining as a young Diana.\r\n\r\nNow the house was as dark as the grave, except for a faint flare of gas\r\nin the basement, and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had\r\nnot been lowered.  As Archer reached the corner he saw that the\r\ncarriage standing at the door was Mrs. Manson Mingott\'s.  What an\r\nopportunity for Sillerton Jackson, if he should chance to pass!  Archer\r\nhad been greatly moved by old Catherine\'s account of Madame Olenska\'s\r\nattitude toward Mrs. Beaufort; it made the righteous reprobation of New\r\nYork seem like a passing by on the other side.  But he knew well enough\r\nwhat construction the clubs and drawing-rooms would put on Ellen\r\nOlenska\'s visits to her cousin.\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked up at the lighted window.  No doubt the two women\r\nwere sitting together in that room: Beaufort had probably sought\r\nconsolation elsewhere.  There were even rumours that he had left New\r\nYork with Fanny Ring; but Mrs. Beaufort\'s attitude made the report seem\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nArcher had the nocturnal perspective of Fifth Avenue almost to himself.\r\nAt that hour most people were indoors, dressing for dinner; and he was\r\nsecretly glad that Ellen\'s exit was likely to be unobserved.  As the\r\nthought passed through his mind the door opened, and she came out.\r\nBehind her was a faint light, such as might have been carried down the\r\nstairs to show her the way.  She turned to say a word to some one; then\r\nthe door closed, and she came down the steps.\r\n\r\n"Ellen," he said in a low voice, as she reached the pavement.\r\n\r\nShe stopped with a slight start, and just then he saw two young men of\r\nfashionable cut approaching.  There was a familiar air about their\r\novercoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their\r\nwhite ties; and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be\r\ndining out so early.  Then he remembered that the Reggie Chiverses,\r\nwhose house was a few doors above, were taking a large party that\r\nevening to see Adelaide Neilson in Romeo and Juliet, and guessed that\r\nthe two were of the number.  They passed under a lamp, and he\r\nrecognised Lawrence Lefferts and a young Chivers.\r\n\r\nA mean desire not to have Madame Olenska seen at the Beauforts\' door\r\nvanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand.\r\n\r\n"I shall see you now--we shall be together," he broke out, hardly\r\nknowing what he said.\r\n\r\n"Ah," she answered, "Granny has told you?"\r\n\r\nWhile he watched her he was aware that Lefferts and Chivers, on\r\nreaching the farther side of the street corner, had discreetly struck\r\naway across Fifth Avenue.  It was the kind of masculine solidarity that\r\nhe himself often practised; now he sickened at their connivance.  Did\r\nshe really imagine that he and she could live like this?  And if not,\r\nwhat else did she imagine?\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow I must see you--somewhere where we can be alone," he said, in\r\na voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears.\r\n\r\nShe wavered, and moved toward the carriage.\r\n\r\n"But I shall be at Granny\'s--for the present that is," she added, as if\r\nconscious that her change of plans required some explanation.\r\n\r\n"Somewhere where we can be alone," he insisted.\r\n\r\nShe gave a faint laugh that grated on him.\r\n\r\n"In New York?  But there are no churches ... no monuments."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the Art Museum--in the Park," he explained, as she looked\r\npuzzled.  "At half-past two.  I shall be at the door ..."\r\n\r\nShe turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage.\r\nAs it drove off she leaned forward, and he thought she waved her hand\r\nin the obscurity.  He stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory\r\nfeelings.  It seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman\r\nhe loved but to another, a woman he was indebted to for pleasures\r\nalready wearied of: it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this\r\nhackneyed vocabulary.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll come!" he said to himself, almost contemptuously.\r\n\r\nAvoiding the popular "Wolfe collection," whose anecdotic canvases\r\nfilled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of cast-iron\r\nand encaustic tiles known as the Metropolitan Museum, they had wandered\r\ndown a passage to the room where the "Cesnola antiquities" mouldered in\r\nunvisited loneliness.\r\n\r\nThey had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated on the divan\r\nenclosing the central steam-radiator, they were staring silently at the\r\nglass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered\r\nfragments of Ilium.\r\n\r\n"It\'s odd," Madame Olenska said, "I never came here before."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well--.  Some day, I suppose, it will be a great Museum."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she assented absently.\r\n\r\nShe stood up and wandered across the room.  Archer, remaining seated,\r\nwatched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its\r\nheavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way\r\na dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the\r\near.  His mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in\r\nthe delicious details that made her herself and no other.  Presently he\r\nrose and approached the case before which she stood.  Its glass shelves\r\nwere crowded with small broken objects--hardly recognisable domestic\r\nutensils, ornaments and personal trifles--made of glass, of clay, of\r\ndiscoloured bronze and other time-blurred substances.\r\n\r\n"It seems cruel," she said, "that after a while nothing matters ... any\r\nmore than these little things, that used to be necessary and important\r\nto forgotten people, and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying\r\nglass and labelled:  \'Use unknown.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but meanwhile--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, meanwhile--"\r\n\r\nAs she stood there, in her long sealskin coat, her hands thrust in a\r\nsmall round muff, her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the\r\ntip of her nose, and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring\r\nwith her quickly-taken breath, it seemed incredible that this pure\r\nharmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change.\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile everything matters--that concerns you," he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him thoughtfully, and turned back to the divan.  He sat\r\ndown beside her and waited; but suddenly he heard a step echoing far\r\noff down the empty rooms, and felt the pressure of the minutes.\r\n\r\n"What is it you wanted to tell me?" she asked, as if she had received\r\nthe same warning.\r\n\r\n"What I wanted to tell you?" he rejoined.  "Why, that I believe you\r\ncame to New York because you were afraid."\r\n\r\n"Afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Of my coming to Washington."\r\n\r\nShe looked down at her muff, and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Well--?"\r\n\r\n"Well--yes," she said.\r\n\r\n"You WERE afraid?  You knew--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: I knew ..."\r\n\r\n"Well, then?" he insisted.\r\n\r\n"Well, then: this is better, isn\'t it?" she returned with a long\r\nquestioning sigh.\r\n\r\n"Better--?"\r\n\r\n"We shall hurt others less.  Isn\'t it, after all, what you always\r\nwanted?"\r\n\r\n"To have you here, you mean--in reach and yet out of reach?  To meet\r\nyou in this way, on the sly?  It\'s the very reverse of what I want.  I\r\ntold you the other day what I wanted."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.  "And you still think this--worse?"\r\n\r\n"A thousand times!"  He paused.  "It would be easy to lie to you; but\r\nthe truth is I think it detestable."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so do I!" she cried with a deep breath of relief.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up impatiently.  "Well, then--it\'s my turn to ask: what is\r\nit, in God\'s name, that you think better?"\r\n\r\nShe hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her\r\nmuff.  The step drew nearer, and a guardian in a braided cap walked\r\nlistlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis.\r\nThey fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them, and\r\nwhen the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and\r\nsarcophagi Archer spoke again.\r\n\r\n"What do you think better?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering she murmured:  "I promised Granny to stay with her\r\nbecause it seemed to me that here I should be safer."\r\n\r\n"From me?"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head slightly, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n"Safer from loving me?"\r\n\r\nHer profile did not stir, but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and\r\nhang in a mesh of her veil.\r\n\r\n"Safer from doing irreparable harm.  Don\'t let us be like all the\r\nothers!" she protested.\r\n\r\n"What others?  I don\'t profess to be different from my kind.  I\'m\r\nconsumed by the same wants and the same longings."\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him with a kind of terror, and he saw a faint colour\r\nsteal into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Shall I--once come to you; and then go home?" she suddenly hazarded in\r\na low clear voice.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to the young man\'s forehead.  "Dearest!" he said,\r\nwithout moving.  It seemed as if he held his heart in his hands, like a\r\nfull cup that the least motion might overbrim.\r\n\r\nThen her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded.  "Go home?\r\nWhat do you mean by going home?"\r\n\r\n"Home to my husband."\r\n\r\n"And you expect me to say yes to that?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her troubled eyes to his.  "What else is there?  I can\'t\r\nstay here and lie to the people who\'ve been good to me."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s the very reason why I ask you to come away!"\r\n\r\n"And destroy their lives, when they\'ve helped me to remake mine?"\r\n\r\nArcher sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate\r\ndespair.  It would have been easy to say:  "Yes, come; come once."  He\r\nknew the power she would put in his hands if she consented; there would\r\nbe no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband.\r\n\r\nBut something silenced the word on his lips.  A sort of passionate\r\nhonesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her\r\ninto that familiar trap.  "If I were to let her come," he said to\r\nhimself, "I should have to let her go again."  And that was not to be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nBut he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek, and wavered.\r\n\r\n"After all," he began again, "we have lives of our own....  There\'s no\r\nuse attempting the impossible.  You\'re so unprejudiced about some\r\nthings, so used, as you say, to looking at the Gorgon, that I don\'t\r\nknow why you\'re afraid to face our case, and see it as it really\r\nis--unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making."\r\n\r\nShe stood up also, her lips tightening under a rapid frown.\r\n\r\n"Call it that, then--I must go," she said, drawing her little watch\r\nfrom her bosom.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and he followed and caught her by the wrist.  "Well,\r\nthen: come to me once," he said, his head turning suddenly at the\r\nthought of losing her; and for a second or two they looked at each\r\nother almost like enemies.\r\n\r\n"When?" he insisted.  "Tomorrow?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.  "The day after."\r\n\r\n"Dearest--!" he said again.\r\n\r\nShe had disengaged her wrist; but for a moment they continued to hold\r\neach other\'s eyes, and he saw that her face, which had grown very pale,\r\nwas flooded with a deep inner radiance.  His heart beat with awe: he\r\nfelt that he had never before beheld love visible.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be late--good-bye.  No, don\'t come any farther than this,"\r\nshe cried, walking hurriedly away down the long room, as if the\r\nreflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her.  When she reached\r\nthe door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell.\r\n\r\nArcher walked home alone.  Darkness was falling when he let himself\r\ninto his house, and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall\r\nas if he viewed them from the other side of the grave.\r\n\r\nThe parlour-maid, hearing his step, ran up the stairs to light the gas\r\non the upper landing.\r\n\r\n"Is Mrs. Archer in?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; Mrs. Archer went out in the carriage after luncheon, and\r\nhasn\'t come back."\r\n\r\nWith a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in\r\nhis armchair.  The parlour-maid followed, bringing the student lamp and\r\nshaking some coals onto the dying fire.  When she left he continued to\r\nsit motionless, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands,\r\nhis eyes fixed on the red grate.\r\n\r\nHe sat there without conscious thoughts, without sense of the lapse of\r\ntime, in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather\r\nthan quicken it.  "This was what had to be, then ... this was what had\r\nto be," he kept repeating to himself, as if he hung in the clutch of\r\ndoom.  What he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a\r\nmortal chill in his rapture.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and May came in.\r\n\r\n"I\'m dreadfully late--you weren\'t worried, were you?" she asked, laying\r\nher hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses.\r\n\r\nHe looked up astonished.  "Is it late?"\r\n\r\n"After seven.  I believe you\'ve been asleep!"  She laughed, and drawing\r\nout her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa.  She looked paler\r\nthan usual, but sparkling with an unwonted animation.\r\n\r\n"I went to see Granny, and just as I was going away Ellen came in from\r\na walk; so I stayed and had a long talk with her.  It was ages since\r\nwe\'d had a real talk...." She had dropped into her usual armchair,\r\nfacing his, and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair.  He\r\nfancied she expected him to speak.\r\n\r\n"A really good talk," she went on, smiling with what seemed to Archer\r\nan unnatural vividness.  "She was so dear--just like the old Ellen.\r\nI\'m afraid I haven\'t been fair to her lately.  I\'ve sometimes thought--"\r\n\r\nArcher stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius\r\nof the lamp.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ve thought--?" he echoed as she paused.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps I haven\'t judged her fairly.  She\'s so different--at\r\nleast on the surface.  She takes up such odd people--she seems to like\r\nto make herself conspicuous.  I suppose it\'s the life she\'s led in that\r\nfast European society; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her.  But I\r\ndon\'t want to judge her unfairly."\r\n\r\nShe paused again, a little breathless with the unwonted length of her\r\nspeech, and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nArcher, as he looked at her, was reminded of the glow which had\r\nsuffused her face in the Mission Garden at St. Augustine.  He became\r\naware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward\r\nsomething beyond the usual range of her vision.\r\n\r\n"She hates Ellen," he thought, "and she\'s trying to overcome the\r\nfeeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it."\r\n\r\nThe thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking\r\nthe silence between them, and throwing himself on her mercy.\r\n\r\n"You understand, don\'t you," she went on, "why the family have\r\nsometimes been annoyed?  We all did what we could for her at first; but\r\nshe never seemed to understand.  And now this idea of going to see Mrs.\r\nBeaufort, of going there in Granny\'s carriage!  I\'m afraid she\'s quite\r\nalienated the van der Luydens ..."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Archer with an impatient laugh.  The open door had closed\r\nbetween them again.\r\n\r\n"It\'s time to dress; we\'re dining out, aren\'t we?" he asked, moving\r\nfrom the fire.\r\n\r\nShe rose also, but lingered near the hearth.  As he walked past her she\r\nmoved forward impulsively, as though to detain him: their eyes met, and\r\nhe saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her\r\nto drive to Jersey City.\r\n\r\nShe flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t kissed me today," she said in a whisper; and he felt her\r\ntremble in his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\n"At the court of the Tuileries," said Mr. Sillerton Jackson with his\r\nreminiscent smile, "such things were pretty openly tolerated."\r\n\r\nThe scene was the van der Luydens\' black walnut dining-room in Madison\r\nAvenue, and the time the evening after Newland Archer\'s visit to the\r\nMuseum of Art.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had come to town for a few\r\ndays from Skuytercliff, whither they had precipitately fled at the\r\nannouncement of Beaufort\'s failure.  It had been represented to them\r\nthat the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable\r\naffair made their presence in town more necessary than ever.  It was\r\none of the occasions when, as Mrs. Archer put it, they "owed it to\r\nsociety" to show themselves at the Opera, and even to open their own\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n"It will never do, my dear Louisa, to let people like Mrs. Lemuel\r\nStruthers think they can step into Regina\'s shoes.  It is just at such\r\ntimes that new people push in and get a footing.  It was owing to the\r\nepidemic of chicken-pox in New York the winter Mrs. Struthers first\r\nappeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their\r\nwives were in the nursery.  You and dear Henry, Louisa, must stand in\r\nthe breach as you always have."\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden could not remain deaf to such a call, and\r\nreluctantly but heroically they had come to town, unmuffled the house,\r\nand sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening they had invited Sillerton Jackson, Mrs.\r\nArcher and Newland and his wife to go with them to the Opera, where\r\nFaust was being sung for the first time that winter.  Nothing was done\r\nwithout ceremony under the van der Luyden roof, and though there were\r\nbut four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually, so that the\r\nproper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the\r\ngentlemen settled down to their cigars.\r\n\r\nArcher had not seen his wife since the evening before.  He had left\r\nearly for the office, where he had plunged into an accumulation of\r\nunimportant business.  In the afternoon one of the senior partners had\r\nmade an unexpected call on his time; and he had reached home so late\r\nthat May had preceded him to the van der Luydens\', and sent back the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nNow, across the Skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate, she\r\nstruck him as pale and languid; but her eyes shone, and she talked with\r\nexaggerated animation.\r\n\r\nThe subject which had called forth Mr. Sillerton Jackson\'s favourite\r\nallusion had been brought up (Archer fancied not without intention) by\r\ntheir hostess.  The Beaufort failure, or rather the Beaufort attitude\r\nsince the failure, was still a fruitful theme for the drawing-room\r\nmoralist; and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned Mrs.\r\nvan der Luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on May Archer.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?  I was told your\r\ngrandmother Mingott\'s carriage was seen standing at Mrs. Beaufort\'s\r\ndoor."  It was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady\r\nby her Christian name.\r\n\r\nMay\'s colour rose, and Mrs. Archer put in hastily: "If it was, I\'m\r\nconvinced it was there without Mrs. Mingott\'s knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you think--?"  Mrs. van der Luyden paused, sighed, and glanced at\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," Mr. van der Luyden said, "that Madame Olenska\'s kind\r\nheart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on Mrs. Beaufort."\r\n\r\n"Or her taste for peculiar people," put in Mrs. Archer in a dry tone,\r\nwhile her eyes dwelt innocently on her son\'s.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to think it of Madame Olenska," said Mrs. van der Luyden;\r\nand Mrs. Archer murmured: "Ah, my dear--and after you\'d had her twice\r\nat Skuytercliff!"\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Mr. Jackson seized the chance to place his\r\nfavourite allusion.\r\n\r\n"At the Tuileries," he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company\r\nexpectantly turned on him, "the standard was excessively lax in some\r\nrespects; and if you\'d asked where Morny\'s money came from--!  Or who\r\npaid the debts of some of the Court beauties ..."\r\n\r\n"I hope, dear Sillerton," said Mrs. Archer, "you are not suggesting\r\nthat we should adopt such standards?"\r\n\r\n"I never suggest," returned Mr. Jackson imperturbably.  "But Madame\r\nOlenska\'s foreign bringing-up may make her less particular--"\r\n\r\n"Ah," the two elder ladies sighed.\r\n\r\n"Still, to have kept her grandmother\'s carriage at a defaulter\'s door!"\r\nMr. van der Luyden protested; and Archer guessed that he was\r\nremembering, and resenting, the hampers of carnations he had sent to\r\nthe little house in Twenty-third Street.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ve always said that she looks at things quite\r\ndifferently," Mrs. Archer summed up.\r\n\r\nA flush rose to May\'s forehead.  She looked across the table at her\r\nhusband, and said precipitately:  "I\'m sure Ellen meant it kindly."\r\n\r\n"Imprudent people are often kind," said Mrs. Archer, as if the fact\r\nwere scarcely an extenuation; and Mrs. van der Luyden murmured:  "If\r\nonly she had consulted some one--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that she never did!" Mrs. Archer rejoined.\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. van der Luyden glanced at his wife, who bent her head\r\nslightly in the direction of Mrs. Archer; and the glimmering trains of\r\nthe three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down\r\nto their cigars.  Mr. van der Luyden supplied short ones on Opera\r\nnights; but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his\r\ninexorable punctuality.\r\n\r\nArcher, after the first act, had detached himself from the party and\r\nmade his way to the back of the club box.  From there he watched, over\r\nvarious Chivers, Mingott and Rushworth shoulders, the same scene that\r\nhe had looked at, two years previously, on the night of his first\r\nmeeting with Ellen Olenska.  He had half-expected her to appear again\r\nin old Mrs. Mingott\'s box, but it remained empty; and he sat\r\nmotionless, his eyes fastened on it, till suddenly Madame Nilsson\'s\r\npure soprano broke out into "M\'ama, non m\'ama ..."\r\n\r\nArcher turned to the stage, where, in the familiar setting of giant\r\nroses and pen-wiper pansies, the same large blonde victim was\r\nsuccumbing to the same small brown seducer.\r\n\r\nFrom the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where\r\nMay sat between two older ladies, just as, on that former evening, she\r\nhad sat between Mrs. Lovell Mingott and her newly-arrived "foreign"\r\ncousin.  As on that evening, she was all in white; and Archer, who had\r\nnot noticed what she wore, recognised the blue-white satin and old lace\r\nof her wedding dress.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly\r\ngarment during the first year or two of marriage: his mother, he knew,\r\nkept hers in tissue paper in the hope that Janey might some day wear\r\nit, though poor Janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and\r\nno bridesmaids would be thought more "appropriate."\r\n\r\nIt struck Archer that May, since their return from Europe, had seldom\r\nworn her bridal satin, and the surprise of seeing her in it made him\r\ncompare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with\r\nsuch blissful anticipations two years earlier.\r\n\r\nThough May\'s outline was slightly heavier, as her goddesslike build had\r\nforetold, her athletic erectness of carriage, and the girlish\r\ntransparency of her expression, remained unchanged: but for the slight\r\nlanguor that Archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the\r\nexact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of\r\nlilies-of-the-valley on her betrothal evening.  The fact seemed an\r\nadditional appeal to his pity: such innocence was as moving as the\r\ntrustful clasp of a child.  Then he remembered the passionate\r\ngenerosity latent under that incurious calm.  He recalled her glance of\r\nunderstanding when he had urged that their engagement should be\r\nannounced at the Beaufort ball; he heard the voice in which she had\r\nsaid, in the Mission garden:  "I couldn\'t have my happiness made out of\r\na wrong--a wrong to some one else;" and an uncontrollable longing\r\nseized him to tell her the truth, to throw himself on her generosity,\r\nand ask for the freedom he had once refused.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer was a quiet and self-controlled young man.  Conformity\r\nto the discipline of a small society had become almost his second\r\nnature.  It was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic\r\nand conspicuous, anything Mr. van der Luyden would have deprecated and\r\nthe club box condemned as bad form.  But he had become suddenly\r\nunconscious of the club box, of Mr. van der Luyden, of all that had so\r\nlong enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit.  He walked along the\r\nsemi-circular passage at the back of the house, and opened the door of\r\nMrs. van der Luyden\'s box as if it had been a gate into the unknown.\r\n\r\n"M\'ama!" thrilled out the triumphant Marguerite; and the occupants of\r\nthe box looked up in surprise at Archer\'s entrance.  He had already\r\nbroken one of the rules of his world, which forbade the entering of a\r\nbox during a solo.\r\n\r\nSlipping between Mr. van der Luyden and Sillerton Jackson, he leaned\r\nover his wife.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a beastly headache; don\'t tell any one, but come home, won\'t\r\nyou?" he whispered.\r\n\r\nMay gave him a glance of comprehension, and he saw her whisper to his\r\nmother, who nodded sympathetically; then she murmured an excuse to Mrs.\r\nvan der Luyden, and rose from her seat just as Marguerite fell into\r\nFaust\'s arms.  Archer, while he helped her on with her Opera cloak,\r\nnoticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies.\r\n\r\nAs they drove away May laid her hand shyly on his.  "I\'m so sorry you\r\ndon\'t feel well.  I\'m afraid they\'ve been overworking you again at the\r\noffice."\r\n\r\n"No--it\'s not that: do you mind if I open the window?" he returned\r\nconfusedly, letting down the pane on his side.  He sat staring out into\r\nthe street, feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful\r\ninterrogation, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing\r\nhouses.  At their door she caught her skirt in the step of the\r\ncarriage, and fell against him.\r\n\r\n"Did you hurt yourself?" he asked, steadying her with his arm.\r\n\r\n"No; but my poor dress--see how I\'ve torn it!" she exclaimed.  She bent\r\nto gather up a mud-stained breadth, and followed him up the steps into\r\nthe hall.  The servants had not expected them so early, and there was\r\nonly a glimmer of gas on the upper landing.\r\n\r\nArcher mounted the stairs, turned up the light, and put a match to the\r\nbrackets on each side of the library mantelpiece.  The curtains were\r\ndrawn, and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of\r\na familiar face met during an unavowable errand.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that his wife was very pale, and asked if he should get her\r\nsome brandy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she exclaimed with a momentary flush, as she took off her\r\ncloak.  "But hadn\'t you better go to bed at once?" she added, as he\r\nopened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette.\r\n\r\nArcher threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n"No; my head is not as bad as that."  He paused.  "And there\'s\r\nsomething I want to say; something important--that I must tell you at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nShe had dropped into an armchair, and raised her head as he spoke.\r\n"Yes, dear?" she rejoined, so gently that he wondered at the lack of\r\nwonder with which she received this preamble.\r\n\r\n"May--" he began, standing a few feet from her chair, and looking over\r\nat her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable\r\nabyss.  The sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike\r\nhush, and he repeated:  "There is something I\'ve got to tell you ...\r\nabout myself ..."\r\n\r\nShe sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes.  She was\r\nstill extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of\r\nexpression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source.\r\n\r\nArcher checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were\r\ncrowding to his lips.  He was determined to put the case baldly,\r\nwithout vain recrimination or excuse.\r\n\r\n"Madame Olenska--" he said; but at the name his wife raised her hand as\r\nif to silence him.  As she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of\r\nher wedding-ring.\r\n\r\n"Oh, why should we talk about Ellen tonight?" she asked, with a slight\r\npout of impatience.\r\n\r\n"Because I ought to have spoken before."\r\n\r\nHer face remained calm.  "Is it really worth while, dear?  I know I\'ve\r\nbeen unfair to her at times--perhaps we all have.  You\'ve understood\r\nher, no doubt, better than we did: you\'ve always been kind to her.  But\r\nwhat does it matter, now it\'s all over?"\r\n\r\nArcher looked at her blankly.  Could it be possible that the sense of\r\nunreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself\r\nto his wife?\r\n\r\n"All over--what do you mean?" he asked in an indistinct stammer.\r\n\r\nMay still looked at him with transparent eyes.  "Why--since she\'s going\r\nback to Europe so soon; since Granny approves and understands, and has\r\narranged to make her independent of her husband--"\r\n\r\nShe broke off, and Archer, grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in\r\none convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it, made a vain\r\neffort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts.\r\n\r\n"I supposed," he heard his wife\'s even voice go on, "that you had been\r\nkept at the office this evening about the business arrangements.  It\r\nwas settled this morning, I believe."  She lowered her eyes under his\r\nunseeing stare, and another fugitive flush passed over her face.\r\n\r\nHe understood that his own eyes must be unbearable, and turning away,\r\nrested his elbows on the mantel-shelf and covered his face.  Something\r\ndrummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were\r\nthe blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel.\r\n\r\nMay sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out\r\nfive minutes.  A lump of coal fell forward in the grate, and hearing\r\nher rise to push it back, Archer at length turned and faced her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Impossible--?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know--what you\'ve just told me?"\r\n\r\n"I saw Ellen yesterday--I told you I\'d seen her at Granny\'s."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t then that she told you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it?"\r\n\r\nHe could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came\r\nback almost immediately.\r\n\r\n"I thought you knew," she said simply.\r\n\r\nShe laid a sheet of paper on the table, and Archer put out his hand and\r\ntook it up.  The letter contained only a few lines.\r\n\r\n"May dear, I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her\r\ncould be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as\r\never.  She sees now that if I return to Europe I must live by myself,\r\nor rather with poor Aunt Medora, who is coming with me. I am hurrying\r\nback to Washington to pack up, and we sail next week.  You must be very\r\ngood to Granny when I\'m gone--as good as you\'ve always been to me.\r\nEllen.\r\n\r\n"If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell\r\nthem it would be utterly useless."\r\n\r\nArcher read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down\r\nand burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his laugh startled him.  It recalled Janey\'s midnight\r\nfright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over\r\nMay\'s telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n"Why did she write this?" he asked, checking his laugh with a supreme\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nMay met the question with her unshaken candour.  "I suppose because we\r\ntalked things over yesterday--"\r\n\r\n"What things?"\r\n\r\n"I told her I was afraid I hadn\'t been fair to her--hadn\'t always\r\nunderstood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many\r\npeople who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to\r\ncriticise, and yet didn\'t always know the circumstances." She paused.\r\n"I knew you\'d been the one friend she could always count on; and I\r\nwanted her to know that you and I were the same--in all our feelings."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, as if waiting for him to speak, and then added slowly:\r\n"She understood my wishing to tell her this.  I think she understands\r\neverything."\r\n\r\nShe went up to Archer, and taking one of his cold hands pressed it\r\nquickly against her cheek.\r\n\r\n"My head aches too; good-night, dear," she said, and turned to the\r\ndoor, her torn and muddy wedding-dress dragging after her across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\nIt was, as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland, a great event\r\nfor a young couple to give their first big dinner.\r\n\r\nThe Newland Archers, since they had set up their household, had\r\nreceived a good deal of company in an informal way.  Archer was fond of\r\nhaving three or four friends to dine, and May welcomed them with the\r\nbeaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in\r\nconjugal affairs.  Her husband questioned whether, if left to herself,\r\nshe would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given\r\nup trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which\r\ntradition and training had moulded her.  It was expected that well-off\r\nyoung couples in New York should do a good deal of informal\r\nentertaining, and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to\r\nthe tradition.\r\n\r\nBut a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with\r\nRoman punch, roses from Henderson\'s, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was\r\na different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken.  As Mrs. Archer\r\nremarked, the Roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by\r\nits manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or\r\nterrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with\r\nshort sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance.\r\n\r\nIt was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their\r\nfirst invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom\r\nrefused even by the seasoned and sought-after.  Still, it was\r\nadmittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens, at May\'s request, should\r\nhave stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the\r\nCountess Olenska.\r\n\r\nThe two mothers-in-law sat in May\'s drawing-room on the afternoon of\r\nthe great day, Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany\'s thickest\r\ngilt-edged bristol, while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the\r\npalms and standard lamps.\r\n\r\nArcher, arriving late from his office, found them still there.  Mrs.\r\nArcher had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and\r\nMrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large\r\ngilt sofa, so that another "corner" might be created between the piano\r\nand the window.\r\n\r\nMay, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of\r\nJacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and\r\nthe placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between\r\nthe candelabra.  On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr.\r\nvan der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff.  Everything was, in\r\nshort, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with\r\nher sharp gold pen.\r\n\r\n"Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts--the Reggie\r\nChiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was\r\nright to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van\r\nNewland and his wife. (How time passes!  It seems only yesterday that\r\nhe was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think\r\nthat\'s all...."\r\n\r\nMrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately.  "No one can say,\r\nNewland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," said Mrs. Archer, "I understand May\'s wanting her cousin to\r\ntell people abroad that we\'re not quite barbarians."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Ellen will appreciate it.  She was to arrive this morning, I\r\nbelieve.  It will make a most charming last impression.  The evening\r\nbefore sailing is usually so dreary," Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.\r\n\r\nArcher turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:\r\n"Do go in and have a peep at the table.  And don\'t let May tire herself\r\ntoo much."  But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to\r\nhis library.  The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed\r\ninto a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly\r\n"tidied," and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and\r\ncedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," he thought, "it\'s not for long--" and he went on to his\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\nTen days had passed since Madame Olenska\'s departure from New York.\r\nDuring those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed\r\nby the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office\r\nin a sealed envelope addressed in her hand.  This retort to his last\r\nappeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar\r\ngame; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning.  She was\r\nstill fighting against her fate; but she was going to Europe, and she\r\nwas not returning to her husband.  Nothing, therefore, was to prevent\r\nhis following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had\r\nproved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send\r\nhim away.\r\n\r\nThis confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the\r\npresent.  It had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any\r\nsign or act, his misery and mortification.  It seemed to him that in\r\nthe deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands;\r\nand he waited.\r\n\r\nThere had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass;\r\nas when Mr. Letterblair, the day after Madame Olenska\'s departure, had\r\nsent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott wished to create for her granddaughter.  For a couple of hours\r\nArcher had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the\r\nwhile obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some\r\nreason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close\r\nof the conference would reveal it.\r\n\r\n"Well, the lady can\'t deny that it\'s a handsome arrangement," Mr.\r\nLetterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the\r\nsettlement.  "In fact I\'m bound to say she\'s been treated pretty\r\nhandsomely all round."\r\n\r\n"All round?" Archer echoed with a touch of derision.  "Do you refer to\r\nher husband\'s proposal to give her back her own money?"\r\n\r\nMr. Letterblair\'s bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch.  "My\r\ndear sir, the law\'s the law; and your wife\'s cousin was married under\r\nthe French law.  It\'s to be presumed she knew what that meant."\r\n\r\n"Even if she did, what happened subsequently--."  But Archer paused.\r\nMr. Letterblair had laid his pen-handle against his big corrugated\r\nnose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous\r\nelderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that\r\nvirtue is not synonymous with ignorance.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, I\'ve no wish to extenuate the Count\'s transgressions;\r\nbut--but on the other side ... I wouldn\'t put my hand in the fire ...\r\nwell, that there hadn\'t been tit for tat ... with the young\r\nchampion...."  Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded\r\npaper toward Archer.  "This report, the result of discreet enquiries\r\n..."  And then, as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to\r\nrepudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued:  "I\r\ndon\'t say it\'s conclusive, you observe; far from it.  But straws show\r\n... and on the whole it\'s eminently satisfactory for all parties that\r\nthis dignified solution has been reached."\r\n\r\n"Oh, eminently," Archer assented, pushing back the paper.\r\n\r\nA day or two later, on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson\r\nMingott, his soul had been more deeply tried.\r\n\r\nHe had found the old lady depressed and querulous.\r\n\r\n"You know she\'s deserted me?" she began at once; and without waiting\r\nfor his reply:  "Oh, don\'t ask me why!  She gave so many reasons that\r\nI\'ve forgotten them all.  My private belief is that she couldn\'t face\r\nthe boredom.  At any rate that\'s what Augusta and my daughters-in-law\r\nthink.  And I don\'t know that I altogether blame her.  Olenski\'s a\r\nfinished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer\r\nthan it is in Fifth Avenue.  Not that the family would admit that: they\r\nthink Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in.  And\r\npoor Ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband.  She\r\nheld out as firmly as ever against that.  So she\'s to settle down in\r\nParis with that fool Medora....  Well, Paris is Paris; and you can keep\r\na carriage there on next to nothing.  But she was as gay as a bird, and\r\nI shall miss her." Two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down\r\nher puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom.\r\n\r\n"All I ask is," she concluded, "that they shouldn\'t bother me any more.\r\nI must really be allowed to digest my gruel...."  And she twinkled a\r\nlittle wistfully at Archer.\r\n\r\nIt was that evening, on his return home, that May announced her\r\nintention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin.  Madame Olenska\'s\r\nname had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight\r\nto Washington; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise.\r\n\r\n"A dinner--why?" he interrogated.\r\n\r\nHer colour rose.  "But you like Ellen--I thought you\'d be pleased."\r\n\r\n"It\'s awfully nice--your putting it in that way.  But I really don\'t\r\nsee--"\r\n\r\n"I mean to do it, Newland," she said, quietly rising and going to her\r\ndesk.  "Here are the invitations all written.  Mother helped me--she\r\nagrees that we ought to."  She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and\r\nArcher suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right," he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of\r\nguests that she had put in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the drawing-room before dinner May was stooping over\r\nthe fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed\r\nsetting of immaculate tiles.\r\n\r\nThe tall lamps were all lit, and Mr. van der Luyden\'s orchids had been\r\nconspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and\r\nknobby silver.  Mrs. Newland Archer\'s drawing-room was generally\r\nthought a great success.  A gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the\r\nprimulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to\r\nthe bay window (where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze\r\nreduction of the Venus of Milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale\r\nbrocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered\r\nwith silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames;\r\nand tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Ellen has ever seen this room lighted up," said May,\r\nrising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of\r\npardonable pride.  The brass tongs which she had propped against the\r\nside of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband\'s\r\nanswer; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden\r\nwere announced.\r\n\r\nThe other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der\r\nLuydens liked to dine punctually.  The room was nearly full, and Archer\r\nwas engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly-varnished\r\nVerbeckhoven "Study of Sheep," which Mr. Welland had given May for\r\nChristmas, when he found Madame Olenska at his side.\r\n\r\nShe was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser\r\nand heavier than ever.  Perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound\r\nseveral rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of\r\nthe little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children\'s parties, when\r\nMedora Manson had first brought her to New York.\r\n\r\nThe amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps\r\nunbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had\r\nnever loved it as he did at that minute.  Their hands met, and he\r\nthought he heard her say:  "Yes, we\'re sailing tomorrow in the\r\nRussia--"; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and\r\nafter an interval May\'s voice:  "Newland!  Dinner\'s been announced.\r\nWon\'t you please take Ellen in?"\r\n\r\nMadame Olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand\r\nwas ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the\r\nevening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty-third Street\r\ndrawing-room.  All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have\r\ntaken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on\r\nhis sleeve, and he said to himself: "If it were only to see her hand\r\nagain I  should  have  to follow her--."\r\n\r\nIt was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a "foreign\r\nvisitor" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being\r\nplaced on her host\'s left.  The fact of Madame Olenska\'s "foreignness"\r\ncould hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell\r\ntribute; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an\r\naffability which left no doubt as to her approval.  There were certain\r\nthings that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and\r\nthoroughly; and one of these, in the old New York code, was the tribal\r\nrally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.  There\r\nwas nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done\r\nto proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now\r\nthat her passage for Europe was engaged; and Archer, at the head of his\r\ntable, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her\r\npopularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her\r\npast countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval.\r\nMrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her\r\nnearest approach to cordiality, and Mr. van der Luyden, from his seat\r\nat May\'s right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify\r\nall the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff.\r\n\r\nArcher, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd\r\nimponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and\r\nceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the\r\nproceedings.  As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to\r\nanother he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon May\'s\r\ncanvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale\r\nwoman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.  And then it came\r\nover him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of\r\nthem he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense\r\npeculiar to "foreign" vocabularies.  He guessed himself to have been,\r\nfor months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and\r\npatiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown\r\nto him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had\r\nbeen achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife\r\non the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined\r\nanything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May\r\nArcher\'s natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nIt was the old New York way of taking life "without effusion of blood":\r\nthe way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed\r\ndecency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more\r\nill-bred than "scenes," except the behaviour of those who gave rise to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a\r\nprisoner in the centre of an armed camp.  He looked about the table,\r\nand guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in\r\nwhich, over the asparagus from Florida, they were dealing with Beaufort\r\nand his wife.  "It\'s to show me," he thought, "what would happen to\r\nME--" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy\r\nover direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him\r\nlike the doors of the family vault.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and met Mrs. van der Luyden\'s startled eyes.\r\n\r\n"You think it laughable?" she said with a pinched smile.  "Of course\r\npoor Regina\'s idea of remaining in New York has its ridiculous side, I\r\nsuppose;" and Archer muttered:  "Of course."\r\n\r\nAt this point, he became conscious that Madame Olenska\'s other\r\nneighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right.\r\nAt the same moment he saw that May, serenely enthroned between Mr. van\r\nder Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, had cast a quick glance down the\r\ntable.  It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could\r\nnot sit through the whole meal in silence.  He turned to Madame\r\nOlenska, and her pale smile met him.  "Oh, do let\'s see it through," it\r\nseemed to say.\r\n\r\n"Did you find the journey tiring?" he asked in a voice that surprised\r\nhim by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had\r\nseldom travelled with fewer discomforts.\r\n\r\n"Except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train," she added; and he\r\nremarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the\r\ncountry she was going to.\r\n\r\n"I never," he declared with intensity, "was more nearly frozen than\r\nonce, in April, in the train between Calais and Paris."\r\n\r\nShe said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could\r\nalways carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its\r\nhardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no\r\naccount compared with the blessedness of getting away.  She changed\r\ncolour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch:  "I mean to\r\ndo a lot of travelling myself before long."  A tremor crossed her face,\r\nand leaning over to Reggie Chivers, he cried out:  "I say, Reggie, what\r\ndo you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, I mean?  I\'m\r\ngame if you are--" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not\r\nthink of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she\r\nwas getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week; and her husband\r\nplacidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for\r\nthe International Polo match.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase "round the world," and\r\nhaving once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the\r\nopportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning\r\nthe shallowness of the Mediterranean ports.  Though, after all, he\r\nadded, it didn\'t matter; for when you\'d seen Athens and Smyrna and\r\nConstantinople, what else was there?  And Mrs. Merry said she could\r\nnever be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not\r\nto go to Naples on account of the fever.\r\n\r\n"But you must have three weeks to do India properly," her husband\r\nconceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous\r\nglobe-trotter.\r\n\r\nAnd at this point the ladies went up to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIn the library, in spite of weightier presences, Lawrence Lefferts\r\npredominated.\r\n\r\nThe talk, as usual, had veered around to the Beauforts, and even Mr.\r\nvan der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, installed in the honorary\r\narm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger\r\nman\'s philippic.\r\n\r\nNever had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian\r\nmanhood and exalt the sanctity of the home.  Indignation lent him a\r\nscathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his\r\nexample, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak\r\nenough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort--no, sir, not even if\r\nhe\'d married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas.  And\r\nwhat chance would there have been, Lefferts wrathfully questioned, of\r\nhis marrying into such a family as the Dallases, if he had not already\r\nwormed his way into certain houses, as people like Mrs. Lemuel\r\nStruthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake?  If society chose to\r\nopen its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain\r\nwas doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure\r\norigin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no\r\ndistant date.\r\n\r\n"If things go on at this pace," Lefferts thundered, looking like a\r\nyoung prophet dressed by Poole, and who had not yet been stoned, "we\r\nshall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers\' houses,\r\nand marrying Beaufort\'s bastards."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say--draw it mild!" Reggie Chivers and young Newland protested,\r\nwhile Mr. Selfridge Merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression\r\nof pain and disgust settled on Mr. van der Luyden\'s sensitive face.\r\n\r\n"Has he got any?" cried Mr. Sillerton Jackson, pricking up his ears;\r\nand while Lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old\r\ngentleman twittered into Archer\'s ear:  "Queer, those fellows who are\r\nalways wanting to set things right.  The people who have the worst\r\ncooks are always telling you they\'re poisoned when they dine out.  But\r\nI hear there are pressing reasons for our friend Lawrence\'s\r\ndiatribe:--typewriter this time, I understand...."\r\n\r\nThe talk swept past Archer like some senseless river running and\r\nrunning because it did not know enough to stop.  He saw, on the faces\r\nabout him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth.  He\r\nlistened to the younger men\'s laughter, and to the praise of the Archer\r\nMadeira, which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully\r\ncelebrating.  Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude\r\nof friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt\r\nhimself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception\r\nincreased his passionate determination to be free.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met\r\nMay\'s triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything\r\nhad "gone off" beautifully.  She rose from Madame Olenska\'s side, and\r\nimmediately Mrs. van der Luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the\r\ngilt sofa where she throned.  Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room\r\nto join them, and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy\r\nof rehabilitation and obliteration was going on.  The silent\r\norganisation which held his little world together was determined to put\r\nitself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety\r\nof Madame Olenska\'s conduct, or the completeness of Archer\'s domestic\r\nfelicity.  All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely\r\nengaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of,\r\nsuspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary;\r\nand from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more\r\ndisengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska\'s\r\nlover.  He caught the glitter of victory in his wife\'s eyes, and for\r\nthe first time understood that she shared the belief.  The discovery\r\nroused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his\r\nefforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers\r\nand little Mrs. Newland; and so the evening swept on, running and\r\nrunning like a senseless river that did not know how to stop.\r\n\r\nAt length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good-bye.\r\nHe understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember\r\nwhat he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single\r\nword they had exchanged.\r\n\r\nShe went up to May, the rest of the company making a circle about her\r\nas she advanced.  The two young women clasped hands; then May bent\r\nforward and kissed her cousin.\r\n\r\n"Certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two," Archer heard\r\nReggie Chivers say in an undertone to young Mrs. Newland; and he\r\nremembered Beaufort\'s coarse sneer at May\'s ineffectual beauty.\r\n\r\nA moment later he was in the hall, putting Madame Olenska\'s cloak about\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\nThrough all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to\r\nsay nothing that might startle or disturb her.  Convinced that no power\r\ncould now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events\r\nshape themselves as they would.  But as he followed Madame Olenska into\r\nthe hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone\r\nwith her at the door of her carriage.\r\n\r\n"Is your carriage here?" he asked; and at that moment Mrs. van der\r\nLuyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said\r\ngently:  "We are driving dear Ellen home."\r\n\r\nArcher\'s heart gave a jerk, and Madame Olenska, clasping her cloak and\r\nfan with one hand, held out the other to him.  "Good-bye," she said.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye--but I shall see you soon in Paris," he answered aloud--it\r\nseemed to him that he had shouted it.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she murmured, "if you and May could come--!"\r\n\r\nMr. van der Luyden advanced to give her his arm, and Archer turned to\r\nMrs. van der Luyden.  For a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the\r\nbig landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining\r\nsteadily--and she was gone.\r\n\r\nAs he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with\r\nhis wife.  Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let\r\nGertrude pass.\r\n\r\n"I say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that I\'m\r\ndining with you at the club tomorrow night?  Thanks so much, you old\r\nbrick!  Good-night."\r\n\r\n"It DID go off beautifully, didn\'t it?" May questioned from the\r\nthreshold of the library.\r\n\r\nArcher roused himself with a start.  As soon as the last carriage had\r\ndriven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with\r\nthe hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to\r\nher room.  But there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the\r\nfactitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue.\r\n\r\n"May I come and talk it over?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you like.  But you must be awfully sleepy--"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not sleepy.  I should like to sit with you a little."\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, pushing her chair near the fire.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long\r\ntime.  At length Archer began abruptly: "Since you\'re not tired, and\r\nwant to talk, there\'s something I must tell you.  I tried to the other\r\nnight--."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly.  "Yes, dear.  Something about yourself?"\r\n\r\n"About myself.  You say you\'re not tired: well, I am.  Horribly tired\r\n..."\r\n\r\nIn an instant she was all tender anxiety.  "Oh, I\'ve seen it coming on,\r\nNewland!  You\'ve been so wickedly overworked--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s that.  Anyhow, I want to make a break--"\r\n\r\n"A break?  To give up the law?"\r\n\r\n"To go away, at any rate--at once.  On a long trip, ever so far\r\noff--away from everything--"\r\n\r\nHe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with\r\nthe indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary\r\nto welcome it.  Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated.\r\n"Away from everything--" he repeated.\r\n\r\n"Ever so far?  Where, for instance?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know.  India--or Japan."\r\n\r\nShe stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his\r\nhands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him.\r\n\r\n"As far as that?  But I\'m afraid you can\'t, dear ..." she said in an\r\nunsteady voice.  "Not unless you\'ll take me with you."  And then, as he\r\nwas silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each\r\nseparate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain:  "That is,\r\nif the doctors will let me go ... but I\'m afraid they won\'t.  For you\r\nsee, Newland, I\'ve been sure since this morning of something I\'ve been\r\nso longing and hoping for--"\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and\r\nroses, and hid her face against his knee.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear," he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked\r\nher hair.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident\r\nlaughter; then May freed herself from his arms and stood up.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t guess--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--I; no.  That is, of course I hoped--"\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then,\r\nturning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly:  "Have you told any one\r\nelse?"\r\n\r\n"Only Mamma and your mother."  She paused, and then added hurriedly,\r\nthe blood flushing up to her forehead:  "That is--and Ellen.  You know\r\nI told you we\'d had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Ah--" said Archer, his heart stopping.\r\n\r\nHe felt that his wife was watching him intently.  "Did you MIND my\r\ntelling her first, Newland?"\r\n\r\n"Mind?  Why should I?"  He made a last effort to collect himself.  "But\r\nthat was a fortnight ago, wasn\'t it?  I thought you said you weren\'t\r\nsure till today."\r\n\r\nHer colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze.  "No; I wasn\'t sure\r\nthen--but I told her I was.  And you see I was right!" she exclaimed,\r\nher blue eyes wet with victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\nNewland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East\r\nThirty-ninth Street.\r\n\r\nHe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\r\nof the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of\r\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\r\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\r\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\r\n\r\n"Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms," he heard some one\r\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\r\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\r\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\r\nthe old Museum.\r\n\r\nThe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\r\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\r\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\r\n\r\nIt was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\r\nhappened.  There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\r\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\r\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\r\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\r\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\r\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\r\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\r\nacross the floor shouting "Dad," while May and the nurse laughed behind\r\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\r\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\r\nChivers\'s many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\r\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\r\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\r\nfoundations the "Grace Church wedding" remained an unchanged\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\r\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\r\nMary\'s incurable indifference to "accomplishments," and passion for\r\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward "art" which had\r\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\r\nrising New York architect.\r\n\r\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\r\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\r\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\r\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\r\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\r\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\r\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\r\n"Colonial."  Nobody nowadays had "Colonial" houses except the\r\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\r\n\r\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\r\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\r\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\r\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\r\n"Hang the professional politician!  You\'re the kind of man the country\r\nwants, Archer.  If the stable\'s ever to be cleaned out, men like you\r\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning."\r\n\r\n"Men like you--" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\r\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett\'s old appeal\r\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\r\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\r\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\r\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\r\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\r\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\r\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\r\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\r\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\r\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\r\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\r\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\r\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\r\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\r\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\r\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man\'s friendship\r\nto be his strength and pride.\r\n\r\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call "a good\r\ncitizen."  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\r\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\r\nand wanted his name.  People said:  "Ask Archer" when there was a\r\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\r\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\r\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\r\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\r\na man ought to ask.\r\n\r\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\r\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\r\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\r\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\r\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\r\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\r\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\r\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\r\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\r\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\r\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\r\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\r\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\r\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\r\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\r\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\r\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\r\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\r\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\r\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\r\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\r\n\r\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\r\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\r\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\r\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\r\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\r\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\r\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\r\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\r\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\r\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\r\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\r\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\r\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\r\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\r\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\r\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\r\nparents\' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\r\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\r\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\r\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\r\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark\'s, where Mrs. Archer already lay\r\nsafe from the terrifying "trend" which her daughter-in-law had never\r\neven become aware of.\r\n\r\nOpposite May\'s portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\r\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\r\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers\'s\r\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\r\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer\'s azure sash so easily spanned.  And\r\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother\'s life had been as closely\r\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\r\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\r\nwas good in the new order too.\r\n\r\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\r\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\r\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York\'s\r\nonly means of quick communication!\r\n\r\n"Chicago wants you."\r\n\r\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\r\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\r\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\r\nDallas on such errands.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\r\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\r\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\r\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I\'ve got to be back on the\r\nfirst of June--" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--"so we\r\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come."\r\n\r\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\r\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\r\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\r\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\r\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\r\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\r\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\r\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas\'s laugh should be able to say: "Of\r\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\r\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth."\r\n\r\nThe voice began again:  "Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You\'ve\r\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I\'d like to know?  If you can allege a\r\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it\'s a go, eh?  Because I count on\r\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you\'d better\r\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it\'ll be our last\r\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would."\r\n\r\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\r\nright.  They would have lots of other "times" after Dallas\'s marriage,\r\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\r\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\r\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\r\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\r\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\r\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\r\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\r\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\r\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\r\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\r\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands\' in\r\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\r\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\r\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\r\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\r\nremembered Dallas\'s wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\r\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\r\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas\'s wake\r\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\r\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\r\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\r\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\r\nthey had "done" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  "We\'ll stick\r\ntogether," he said; and May\'s face had brightened at his setting such a\r\ngood example to Dallas.\r\n\r\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\r\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\r\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\r\nand "see the galleries."  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\r\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\r\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\r\nnew things.\r\n\r\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\r\nThe worst of doing one\'s duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\r\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\r\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\r\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\r\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man\'s imagination,\r\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\r\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\r\nwondered....\r\n\r\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\r\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\r\npoor Lawrence Lefferts\'s, uttered years ago in that very room:  "If\r\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort\'s\r\nbastards."\r\n\r\nIt was just what Archer\'s eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\r\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy\'s Aunt Janey, who still\r\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\r\nmother\'s emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\r\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\r\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\r\n"set" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\r\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\r\nIsabey miniature.\r\n\r\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\r\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\r\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\r\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\r\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\r\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father\'s\r\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\r\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort\'s failure, or\r\nthe fact that after his wife\'s death he had been quietly married to the\r\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\r\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\r\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\r\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\r\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\r\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\r\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer\'s sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\r\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl\'s guardian.  The\r\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer\'s\r\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas\'s engagement was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\r\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\r\nand "movements," with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\r\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody\'s past, in the\r\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\r\nplane?\r\n\r\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\r\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\r\neagerness of youth.\r\n\r\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\r\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\r\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son\'s conducted itself in\r\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  "It\r\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different," he\r\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\r\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\r\napprove.\r\n\r\n"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\r\nthey\'re going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\r\nit for granted that we shouldn\'t.  Only, I wonder--the thing one\'s so\r\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one\'s heart beat as wildly?"\r\n\r\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\r\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\r\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\r\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\r\nhe shouldn\'t be made to go to one of the newfangled "palaces."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right--of course," Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  "I\'ll take\r\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--" leaving his\r\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\r\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\r\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\r\n\r\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\r\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\r\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska\'s\r\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\r\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\r\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\r\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\r\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\r\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\r\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\r\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\r\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\r\n\r\nDallas\'s hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  "Hullo, father: this\r\nis something like, isn\'t it?"  They stood for a while looking out in\r\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  "By the way, I\'ve got a\r\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\r\nfive."\r\n\r\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\r\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\r\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\r\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott\'s\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, didn\'t I tell you?" Dallas pursued.  "Fanny made me swear to do\r\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\r\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\r\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\r\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn\'t any friends in Paris, and\r\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\r\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort\'s.  And\r\nshe\'s our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\r\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\r\nsee her."\r\n\r\nArcher continued to stare at him.  "You told her I was here?"\r\n\r\n"Of course--why not?"  Dallas\'s eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\r\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father\'s with a\r\nconfidential pressure.\r\n\r\n"I say, father: what was she like?"\r\n\r\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son\'s unabashed gaze.  "Come, own\r\nup: you and she were great pals, weren\'t you?  Wasn\'t she most awfully\r\nlovely?"\r\n\r\n"Lovely?  I don\'t know.  She was different."\r\n\r\n"Ah--there you have it!  That\'s what it always comes to, doesn\'t it?\r\nWhen she comes, SHE\'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn\'t know why.  It\'s\r\nexactly what I feel about Fanny."\r\n\r\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  "About Fanny?  But, my\r\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don\'t see--"\r\n\r\n"Dash it, Dad, don\'t be prehistoric!  Wasn\'t she--once--your Fanny?"\r\n\r\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\r\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\r\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  "What\'s the use of\r\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose \'em out," he\r\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\r\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\r\n\r\n"My Fanny?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the woman you\'d have chucked everything for: only you didn\'t,"\r\ncontinued his surprising son.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\r\n\r\n"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--"\r\n\r\n"Your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\r\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\r\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you\'d given up the thing you\r\nmost wanted."\r\n\r\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\r\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\r\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  "She never asked me."\r\n\r\n"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\r\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\r\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\r\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\r\neach other\'s private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\r\nour own.--I say, Dad," Dallas broke off, "you\'re not angry with me?  If\r\nyou are, let\'s make it up and go and lunch at Henri\'s.  I\'ve got to\r\nrush out to Versailles afterward."\r\n\r\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\r\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\r\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas\'s indiscretion.  It\r\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\r\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\r\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\r\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\r\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\r\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\r\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\r\nrolled by....\r\n\r\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\r\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\r\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\r\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\r\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\r\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\r\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\r\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\r\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\r\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\r\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\r\n\r\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  "But\r\nI\'m only fifty-seven--" and then he turned away.  For such summer\r\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\r\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\r\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\r\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father\'s mind, was\r\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\r\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\r\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\r\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\r\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\r\n\r\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\r\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\r\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\r\nmaster but as an equal.  "That\'s it: they feel equal to things--they\r\nknow their way about," he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\r\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\r\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father\'s arm.  "Oh, by\r\nJove," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\r\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\r\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\r\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\r\nof the race\'s glory.\r\n\r\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\r\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\r\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\r\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\r\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\r\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\r\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\r\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\r\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\r\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\r\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\r\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\r\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\r\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  "Ah, good conversation--there is\r\nnothing like it, is there?"\r\n\r\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\r\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\r\nOlenska\'s existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\r\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\r\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\r\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\r\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\r\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\r\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\r\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\r\n\r\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\r\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\r\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\r\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\r\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\r\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\r\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\r\n\r\n"It must be here," he said, slipping his arm through his father\'s with\r\na movement from which Archer\'s shyness did not shrink; and they stood\r\ntogether looking up at the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\r\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\r\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\r\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\r\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\r\n\r\n"I wonder which floor--?" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\r\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter\'s lodge, and came back to\r\nsay:  "The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings."\r\n\r\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\r\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\r\n\r\n"I say, you know, it\'s nearly six," his son at length reminded him.\r\n\r\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\r\n\r\n"I believe I\'ll sit there a moment," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why--aren\'t you well?" his son exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me."\r\n\r\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  "But, I say, Dad: do you\r\nmean you won\'t come up at all?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Archer slowly.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t she won\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you."\r\n\r\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\r\n\r\n"But what on earth shall I say?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, don\'t you always know what to say?" his father\r\nrejoined with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  I shall say you\'re old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\r\nthe five flights because you don\'t like lifts."\r\n\r\nHis father smiled again.  "Say I\'m old-fashioned: that\'s enough."\r\n\r\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\r\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\r\n\r\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\r\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\r\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\r\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\r\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\r\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\r\n"took after him."\r\n\r\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\r\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\r\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\r\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\r\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\r\non a table.\r\n\r\n"It\'s more real to me here than if I went up," he suddenly heard\r\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\r\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\r\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\r\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\r\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\r\n\r\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\r\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Note on the Text\r\n\r\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\r\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.  It was published that\r\nsame year in book form by D. Appleton and Company in New York and in\r\nLondon.  Wharton made extensive stylistic, punctuation, and spelling\r\nchanges and revisions between the serial and book publication, and more\r\nthan thirty subsequent changes were made after the second impression of\r\nthe book edition had been run off.  This authoritative text is\r\nreprinted from the Library of America edition of Novels by Edith\r\nWharton, and is based on the sixth impression of the first edition,\r\nwhich incorporates the last set of extensive revisions that are\r\nobviously authorial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Age of Innocence, by Edith Wharton\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AGE OF INNOCENCE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 541.txt or 541.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/5/4/541/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judith Boss and Charles Keller.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
