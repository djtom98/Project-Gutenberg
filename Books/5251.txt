Yonge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     How the children leave us, and no traces\r\n       Linger of that smiling angel-band,\r\n     Gone, for ever gone, and in their places\r\n       Weary men and anxious women stand.\r\n                          ADELAIDE A. PROCTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a book by an author who must call herself a veteran should be taken\r\nup by readers of a younger generation, they are begged to consider the\r\nfirst few chapters as a sort of prologue, introduced for the sake of\r\nthose of elder years, who were kind enough to be interested in the\r\ndomestic politics of the Mohuns and the Underwoods.\r\n\r\nContinuations are proverbially failures, and yet it is perhaps a\r\nconsequence of the writer\'s realization of characters that some seem as\r\nif they could not be parted with, and must be carried on in the mind,\r\nand not only have their after-fates described, but their minds and\r\nopinions under the modifications of advancing years and altered\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nTurner and other artists have been known literally to see colours in\r\nabsolutely different hues as they grew older, and so no doubt it is\r\nwith thinkers. The outlines may be the same, the tints are insensibly\r\nmodified and altered, and the effect thus far changed.\r\n\r\nThus it is with the writers of fiction. The young write in full sympathy\r\nwith, as well as for, the young, they have a pensive satisfaction in\r\nfeeling and depicting the full pathos of a tragedy, and on the other\r\nhand they delight in their own mirth, and fully share it with the\r\nbeings of their imagination, or they work out great questions with the\r\nunhesitating decision of their youth.\r\n\r\nBut those who write in elder years look on at their young people,\r\nnot with inner sympathy but from the outside. Their affections and\r\ncomprehension are with the fathers, mothers, and aunts; they dread,\r\nrather than seek, piteous scenes, and they have learnt that there are\r\ntwo sides to a question, that there are many stages in human life, and\r\nthat the success or failure of early enthusiasm leaves a good deal more\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\nThus the vivid fancy passes away, which the young are carried along\r\nwith, and the older feel refreshed by; there is still a sense of\r\nexperience, and a pleasure in tracing the perspective from another\r\npoint of sight, where what was once distant has become near at hand, the\r\nearnest of many a day-dream has been gained, and more than one ideal has\r\nbeen tried, and merits and demerits have become apparent.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is hoped that the Long Vacation may not be devoid of\r\ninterest for readers who have sympathized in early days with Beechcroft,\r\nStoneborough, and Vale Leston, when they were peopled with the outcome\r\nof a youthful mind, and that they may be ready to look with interest on\r\nthe perplexities and successes attending on the matured characters in\r\nafter years.\r\n\r\nIf they will feel as if they were on a visit to friends grown older,\r\nwith their children about them, and if the young will forgive the seeing\r\nwith elder eyes, and observing instead of participating, that is all the\r\nveteran author would ask.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

There you are! Quite well?"\r\n\r\nGerald Underwood, of slight delicate mould, with refined,\r\ntransparent-looking features, and with hair and budding moustache too\r\nfair for his large dark eyes, came bounding up the broad stair, to the\r\nembrace of the aunt who stood at the top, a little lame lady supported\r\nby an ivory-headed staff. Her deep blue eyes, dark eyebrows, and sweet\r\nthough piquant face were framed by the straight crape line of widowhood,\r\nwhence a soft white veil hung on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Cherie sweet! You are well? And the Vicar?"\r\n\r\n"Getting on. How are they all at Vale Leston?"\r\n\r\n"All right. Your mother got to church on Easter-day." This was to Anna\r\nVanderkist, a young person of the plump partridge order, and fair, rosy\r\ncountenance ever ready for smiles and laughter.\r\n\r\n"Here are no end of flowers," as the butler brought a hamper.\r\n\r\n"Daffodils! Oh!--and anemones! How delicious! I must take Clement a\r\nbunch of those dear white violets. I know where they came from," and she\r\nheld them to her lips. "Some primroses too, I hope."\r\n\r\n"A few; but the main body, tied up in tight bunches like cauliflowers, I\r\ndropped at Kensington Palace Gardens."\r\n\r\n"A yellow primrose is much more than a yellow primrose at present,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Grinstead, picking out the few spared from political purposes.\r\n"Clement will want his button-hole, to greet Lance."\r\n\r\n"So he is advanced to button-holes! And Lance?"\r\n\r\n"He is coming up for the Press dinner, and will sleep here, to be ready\r\nfor Primrose-day."\r\n\r\n"That\'s prime, whatever brings him."\r\n\r\n"There, children, go and _do_ the flowers, and drink tea. I am going to\r\nread to your uncle to keep him fresh for Lance."\r\n\r\n"How bright she looks," said Gerald, as Anna began collecting vases from\r\nthe tables in a drawing-room not professionally artistic, but entirely\r\ndomestic, and full of grace and charm of taste, looking over a suburban\r\ngarden fresh with budding spring to a church spire.\r\n\r\n"The thought of Uncle Lance has cheered them both very much."\r\n\r\n"So the Vicar is really recovering?"\r\n\r\n"Since Cousin Marilda flew at the curates, and told them that if they\r\ncame near him with their worries, they should never see a farthing of\r\nhers! And they are all well at home? Is anything going on?"\r\n\r\n"Chiefly defence of the copses from primrose marauders. You know the\r\ngreat agitation. They want to set up a china clay factory on Penbeacon,\r\nand turn the Ewe, not to say the Leston, into milk and water."\r\n\r\n"The wretches! But they can\'t. It is yours."\r\n\r\n"Not the western quarry; but they cannot get the stream without a\r\npiece of the land which belongs to Hodnet\'s farm, for which they make\r\nastounding bids; but, any way, nothing can be done till I am of age,\r\nwhen the lease to Hodnet is out, except by Act of Parliament, which is\r\nhardly worth while, considering--"\r\n\r\n"That you are near twenty. But surely you won\'t consent?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t want to break all your hearts, Cherie\'s especially, but\r\nwhy should all that space be nothing but a playground for us Underwoods,\r\ninstead of making work for the million?"\r\n\r\n"And a horrid, nasty million it would be," retorted Anna. "You born\r\nYankee! Don\'t worry Aunt Cherry about profaning the Ewe, just to spoil\r\ngood calico with nasty yellow dust."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to worry her, but there never were such groovy people as\r\nyou are! I shall think it over, and make up my mind by the time I have\r\nthe power."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had to wait till five-and-twenty, so as to get more time and\r\nsense."\r\n\r\nGerald laughed, and sauntered away. He was not Yankee, except that he\r\nhad been born at Boston. His father was English, his mother a Hungarian\r\nsinger, who had divorced and deserted his father, the ne\'er-do-weel\r\nsecond son of an old family. When Gerald was five years old his father\r\nwas killed, and he himself severely injured, in a raid of the Indians\r\nfar west, and he was brought home by an old friend of the family. His\r\neldest uncle\'s death made him heir to the estate, but his life was a\r\nvery frail one till his thirteenth year, when he seemed to have outgrown\r\nthe shock to spine and nerves.\r\n\r\nMuch had befallen the house of Underwood since the days when we took\r\nleave of them, still sorrowing under the loss of the main pillar of\r\ntheir house, but sending forth the new founders with good hope.\r\n\r\nGeraldine had made her home at St. Matthew\'s with her brother Clement\r\nand the little delicate orphan Gerald; but after three years she had\r\nyielded to the persevering constancy of Mr. Grinstead, a sculptor of\r\nconsiderable genius and repute, much older than herself, who was ready\r\nand willing to be a kind uncle to her little charge, and who introduced\r\nher to all at home or abroad that was refined, intellectual, or\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nIt was in the first summer after their marriage that he was charmed with\r\nthe vivacity and musical talent of her young sister Angela, now upon the\r\nworld again. Angela had grown up as the pet and plaything of the Sisters\r\nof St. Faith\'s at Dearport, which she regarded as another home, and when\r\ncrushed by grief at her eldest brother\'s death had hurried thither for\r\nsolace. Her family thought her safe there, not realizing how far life\r\nis from having its final crisis over at one-and-twenty. New Sisters came\r\nin, old ones went to found fresh branches; stricter rules grew, up,\r\nand were enforced by a Superior out of sympathy with the girl, who had\r\nalways rebelled against what she thought dictation. It was decided that\r\nshe could stay there no longer, and her brother Lancelot and his wife\r\nreceived her at Marshlands with indignant sympathy for her wrongs; but\r\nneither she nor her sister-in-law were made to suit one another.\r\nWith liberty her spirit and audacity revived, and she showed so much\r\nattraction towards the Salvation Army, that her brother declared their\r\nmusic to have been the chief deterrent from her becoming a "Hallelujah\r\nlass." However, in a brief visit to London, she so much pleased Mr.\r\nGrinstead that he invited her to partake in the winter\'s journey to\r\nItaly. Poor man, he little knew what he undertook. Music, art, Roman\r\nCatholic services, and novelty conspired to intoxicate her, and her\r\nsister was thankful to carry her off northward before she had pledged\r\nherself to enter a convent.\r\n\r\nMountain air and scenery, however, proved equally dangerous. Her\r\nenterprises inspired the two quiet people with constant fears for her\r\nneck; but it was worse when they fell in with a party of very Bohemian\r\nartists, whom Mr. Grinstead knew just well enough not to be able to\r\nshake them off. The climax came when she started off with them in\r\ncostume at daybreak on an expedition to play the zither and sing at a\r\nvillage fete. She came back safe and sound, but Geraldine was already\r\npacked up to take her to Munich, where Charles Audley and Stella now\r\nwere, and to leave her under their charge before she had driven Mr.\r\nGrinstead distracted.\r\n\r\nThere was a worse trouble at home. Since the death of his good old\r\nmother and of Felix Underwood, Sir Adrian Vanderkist had been rapidly\r\ngoing downhill; as though he had thrown off all restraint, and as if\r\nthe yearly birth of a daughter left him the more free to waste his\r\npatrimony. Little or nothing had been heard direct from poor Alda till\r\nClement was summoned by a telegram from Ironbeam Park to find his sister\r\nin the utmost danger, with a new-born son by her side, and her husband\r\nin the paroxysms of the terrible Nemesis of indulgence in alcohol.\r\n\r\nSir Adrian had quarrelled with all the family in turn except Clement,\r\nand this fact, or else that gentleness towards a sufferer that had won\r\non old Fulbert Underwood, led him in a lucid interval to direct and sign\r\na hurried will, drawn up by his steward, leaving the Reverend Edward\r\nClement Underwood sole guardian to his children, and executor, together\r\nwith his lawyer. It was done without Clement\'s knowledge, or he would\r\nhave remonstrated, for never was there a more trying bequest than the\r\ncharge which in a few days he found laid on him.\r\n\r\nHe had of course already made acquaintance with the little girls. Poor\r\nchildren, they had hitherto led a life as dreary as was possible to\r\nchildren who had each other, and fresh air and open grounds. Their\r\nmother was more and more of an invalid, and dreaded that their father\r\nshould take umbrage at the least expense that they caused; so that they\r\nwere scrupulously kept out of his way, fed, dressed, and even educated\r\nas plainly as possible by a governess, cheap because she was passe, and\r\nmade up for her deficiencies by strictness amounting to harshness,\r\nwhile they learnt to regard each new little sister\'s sex as a proof of\r\nnaughtiness on her part or theirs.\r\n\r\nThe first time they ever heard a man\'s step in the school-room passage\r\nwas in those days of undefined sorrow, alarm, and silence after the\r\ngoverness had despatched the message to the only relation whose address\r\nshe knew. The step came nearer; there was a knock, the sweet, strong\r\nvoice asked,\r\n\r\n"Are the poor little girls here?" and the tall figure was on one knee\r\namong them, gathering as many as he could within his loving arms.\r\nPerhaps he recollected Sister Constance among the forlorn flock at\r\nBexley; but these were even more desolate, for they had no past of love\r\nand loyalty. But with that embrace it seemed to the four elders that\r\ntheir worst days were over. What mattered it to them that they all eight\r\nof them--were almost destitute? the birth of the poor little male heir\r\npreventing the sale of the property, so terribly encumbered; and the\r\nonly available maintenance being the L5000 that Mr. Thomas Underwood had\r\nsettled securely upon their mother.\r\n\r\nThey began to know what love and kindness meant. Kind uncles and aunts\r\ngathered round them. Their mother seemed to be able to live when her\r\ntwin-sister hung over her, and as soon as she could be moved, the whole\r\nparty left the gloom of Ironbeam for Vale Leston, where a house was\r\narranged for them. Lady Vanderkist continued a chronic invalid, watched\r\nover by her sister Wilmet and her excellent young daughter Mary. Robina,\r\nwho had only one girl, and had not forgotten her training as a teacher,\r\nundertook, with the assistance of Sophia, the second daughter, the\r\neducation of the little ones; and the third and fourth, Emilia and Anna,\r\nwere adopted into the childless homes of Mrs. Travis Underwood and Mrs.\r\nGrinstead, and lived there as daughters. Business cares of the most\r\nperplexing kind fell, however, on Clement Underwood\'s devoted and\r\nunaccustomed head, and in the midst arrived a telegram from Charles\r\nAudley, summoning him instantly to Munich.\r\n\r\nAngela was in danger of fulfilling her childish design of marrying a\r\nDuke, or at least a Graf. Diplomates could not choose their society, and\r\nshe had utterly disdained all restraints from "the babies," as she chose\r\nto call Mr. and Mrs. Audley, and thus the wunderschones madchen had\r\nfascinated the Count, an unbelieving Roman Catholic of evil repute, and\r\nhad derided their remonstrances.\r\n\r\nClement hurried off, but to find the bird flown. She had come down in\r\nthe morning, white and tear-stained, and had told Stella that she could\r\nstay no longer, kissed her, and was gone out of the house before even\r\nCharles could be called. Stella\'s anxiety, almost despair, had however\r\nbeen relieved just before her brother\'s arrival by an electric message\r\nfrom Vale Leston with the words, "Angela safe at home."\r\n\r\nLetters followed, and told how Robina had found her sobbing upon her\r\nbrother Felix\'s grave. Her explanation was, that on the very night\r\nbefore her proposed betrothal, she had dreamt that she was drifting\r\ndown the Ewe in the little boat Miss Ullin, and saw Felix under the\r\nwillow-tree holding out his bared arms to her. She said, "Is that the\r\nscar of the scald?" and his only answer was the call "Angela! Angela!"\r\nand with the voice still sounding in her ears, she awoke, and determined\r\ninstantly to obey the call, coming to her, as she felt, from another\r\nworld. If it were only from her own conscience, still it was a cause\r\nof great thankfulness to her family, and she soon made herself very\r\nvaluable at Vale Leston in a course of epidemics which ran through the\r\nvillage, and were in some cases very severe. The doctors declared that\r\ntwo of the little Vanderkists owed their lives to her unremitting care.\r\n\r\nHer destiny seemed to be fixed, and she went off radiant to be trained\r\nat a London hospital as a nurse. Her faculty in that line was undoubted.\r\nAll the men in her ward were devoted to her, and so were almost all the\r\nyoung doctors; but the matron did not like her, and at the end of the\r\nthree years, an act of independent treatment of a patient caused a\r\ntremendous commotion, all the greater because many outsiders declared\r\nthat she was right. But it almost led to a general expulsion of lady\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nOf course she had to retire, and happily for her, Mother Constance was\r\njust at that time sentenced by her rheumatism to spend the winter in a\r\nwarm climate. She eagerly claimed Angela\'s tendance, and just at the end\r\nof the year there came an urgent request for a Sister from England to\r\nform a foundation in one of the new cities of Australia on the model of\r\nSt. Faith\'s; and thither Mother Constance proceeded, with one Sister and\r\nAngela, who had thenceforth gone on so well and quietly that her family\r\nhoped the time for Angela\'s periodical breaking out had passed.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing years had been tranquil as to family events, though the\r\nvarious troubles and perplexities that fell on Clement were endless,\r\nboth those parochial and ritualistic, and those connected with the\r\nVanderkist affairs, where his sister did not spare him her murmurs.\r\nFulbert\'s death in Australia was a blow both to Lancelot and to him,\r\nthough they had never had much hope of seeing this brother again. He\r\nhad left the proceeds of his sheep-farm between Lancelot, Bernard, and\r\nAngela.\r\n\r\nThus had passed about fourteen years since the death of Felix, when kind\r\nold Mr. Grinstead died suddenly at a public meeting, leaving his widow\r\nwell endowed, and the possessor of her pretty home at Brompton. When,\r\nsoon after the blow, her sisters took her to the home at Vale Leston,\r\nshe had seemed oppressed by the full tide of young life overflowing\r\nthere, and as if she again felt the full force of the early sorrow in\r\nthe loss that she had once said made Vale Leston to her a desolation. On\r\nher return to Brompton, she had still been in a passive state, as though\r\nthe taste of life had gone from her, and there was nothing to call\r\nforth her interest or energy. The first thing that roused her was the\r\ndangerous illness of her brother Clement, the result of blood-poisoning\r\nduring a mission week in a pestilential locality, after a long course\r\nof family worries and overwork in his parish. Low, lingering fever had\r\nthreatened every organ in turn, till in the early days of January,\r\na fatal time in the family, he was almost despaired of. However, Dr.\r\nBrownlow and Lancelot Underwood had strength of mind to run the risk,\r\nwith the earnest co-operation of Professor Tom May, of a removal to\r\nBrompton, where he immediately began to mend, so that he was in April\r\ndecidedly convalescent, though with doubts as to a return to real\r\nhealth, nor had he yet gone beyond his dressing-room, since any exertion\r\nwas liable to cause fainting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. -- A CHAPTER OF TWADDLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     The blessing of my later years\r\n     Was with me when a boy.--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Grinstead, on her nephew\'s arm, came into her drawing-room\r\nafter dinner, she was almost as much dismayed as pleased to find a long\r\nblack figure in a capacious arm-chair by the fire.\r\n\r\n"You adventurous person," she said, "how came you here?"\r\n\r\n"I could not help it, with the prospect of Lancey boy," he said in\r\nsmiling excuse, holding out a hand in greeting to Gerald, and thanking\r\nAnna, who brought a cushion.\r\n\r\n"Hark! there he is!" and Gerald and Anna sprang forward, but were only\r\nin time to open the room door, when there was a double cry of greeting,\r\nnot only of the slender, bright-eyed, still youthful-looking uncle, but\r\nof the pleasant face of his wife. She exclaimed as Lancelot hung over\r\nhis brother--\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I would not have come but that I thought he was still in his\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very bad compliment, Gertrude, when I have just made my\r\nescape."\r\n\r\n"I shall be too much for you," said Gertrude. "Here, children, take me\r\noff somewhere."\r\n\r\n"To have some dinner," said Geraldine, her hand on the bell.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Marilda feasted me."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t go," entreated Clement. "It is a treat to look at you two\r\nsunny people."\r\n\r\n"Let us efface ourselves, and be seen and not heard," returned Gertrude,\r\nsitting down between Gerald and Anna on a distant couch, whence she\r\ncontemplated the trio--Clement, of course, with the extreme pallor,\r\nlanguor, and emaciation of long illness, with a brow gaining in dignity\r\nand expression by the loss of hair, and with a look of weary, placid\r\nenjoyment as he listened to the talk of the other two; Lance with\r\nbright, sweet animation and cheeriness, still young-looking, though\r\nhis hair too was scantier and his musical tones subdued; and Geraldine,\r\npensive in eye and lip, but often sparkling up with flashes of her\r\ninborn playfulness, and, like Clement, resting in the sunshine diffused\r\nby Lance. This last was the editor and proprietor of the \'Pursuivant\',\r\nan important local paper, and had come up on journalistic business as\r\nwell as for the fete. Gertrude meantime had been choosing carpets and\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\n"For," said Lance, with a smack of exultation, "we are actually going\r\nback to our old quarters over the shop."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" A responsive sound of satisfaction from Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Nothing amiss?" asked Clement.\r\n\r\n"Far from it. We let Marshlands to great advantage, and there are many\r\nreasons for the flitting. I ought to be at head-quarters, and besides\r\nthere are the Sundays. We are too many now for picnicking in the\r\nclass-room, or sponging on the rectory."\r\n\r\n"And," said Gertrude, "I dare not put his small family in competition\r\nwith his organ."\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Lance, "the \'Pursuivant\' is more exacting, and the\r\nprinting Will Harewood\'s books has brought in more business--"\r\n\r\n"But how about space? We could squeeze, but can you?"\r\n\r\n"We have devoured our two next-door neighbours. There\'s for you! You\r\nknow Pratt the dentist had a swell hall-door and staircase, which we\r\nabsorb, so we shall not eat in the back drawing-room, nor come up the\r\nflight which used to be so severe on you, Cherry."\r\n\r\n"I can only remember the arms that helped me up. I have never left off\r\ndreaming of the dear old step springing up the stair after the day\'s\r\nwork, and the whistle to Theodore."\r\n\r\n"Ah, those were the jolly old days!" returned Lance, con amore.\r\n\r\n"Unbroken," added Clement, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n"Better than Vale Leston?" asked Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"The five years there were, as Felix called those last hours of delight,\r\nhalcyon days," said Geraldine; "but the real home was in the rough and\r\nthe smooth, the contrivances, the achievements, the exultation at each\r\nstep on the ladder, the flashes of Edgar, the crowded holiday times--all\r\nhappier than we knew! I hope your children will care as much."\r\n\r\n"Vale Leston is their present paradise," said Gertrude. "You should\r\nsee Master Felix\'s face at the least hope of a visit, and even little\r\nFulbert talks about boat and fish."\r\n\r\n"What have you done with the Lambs?" demanded Clement.\r\n\r\n"They have outgrown the old place in every direction, and have got a\r\nspick-and-span chess-board of a villa out on the Minsterham road."\r\n\r\n"They have not more children than you have."\r\n\r\n"Five Lambkins to our four, besides Gussy and Killy," said Lance;\r\n"though A--which is all that appears of the great Achilles\' unlucky\r\nname--is articled to Shapcote, and as for Gussy, or rather Mr. Tanneguy,\r\nhe is my right hand."\r\n\r\n"We thought him a nice sort of youth when he was improving himself in\r\nLondon," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"You both were very good to him," said Lance, "and those three years\r\nwere not wasted. He is a far better sub-editor and reporter than I was\r\nat his age, with his French wit and cleverness. The only fault I find\r\nwith him is that he longs for plate-glass and flummery instead of old\r\nFroggatt\'s respectable panes."\r\n\r\n"He has become the London assistant, who was our bugbear," said\r\nGeraldine.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how we should get on without him since we made \'Pur\'\r\ndaily," said Lance.\r\n\r\n"How old ambitions get realized!" said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Does his mother endure the retail work, or has she not higher views for\r\nhim?" asked Clement.\r\n\r\n"In fact, ever since the first Lambkin came on the stage any one would\r\nhave thought those poor boys were her steps, not good old Lamb\'s;\r\nwhereas Felix always made a point of noticing them. Gus was nine years\r\nold that last time he was there, while I was ill, and he left such an\r\nimpression as to make him the hero model.--Aye, Gus is first-rate."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have not altered the old shop and office."\r\n\r\n"Catch me! But we are enlarging the reading-room, and the new press\r\ndemands space. Then there\'s a dining-room for the young men, and what\r\ndo you think I\'ve got? We (not Froggatt, Underwood, and Lamb, but the\r\nChurch Committee) have bought St. Oswald\'s buildings for a coffee hotel\r\nand young men\'s lodging-house."\r\n\r\n"Our own, old house. Oh! is Edgar\'s Great Achilles there still?"\r\n\r\n"I rushed up to see. Alas! the barbarians have papered him out. But what\r\ndo you think I\'ve got? The old cupboard door where all our heights were\r\nmarked on our birthdays."\r\n\r\n"He set it up in his office," said Gertrude. "I think he danced round\r\nit. I know he brought me and all the children to adore it, and showed\r\nus, just like a weather record, where every one shot up after the\r\nmeasles, and where Clement got above you, Cherry, and Lance remained a\r\nbonny shrimp."\r\n\r\n"A great move, but it sounds comfortable," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"Yes; for now Lance will get a proper luncheon, as he never has done\r\nsince dear old Mrs. Froggatt died," said Gertrude, "and he is an animal\r\nthat needs to be made to eat! Then the children want schooling of the\r\nnew-fashioned kinds."\r\n\r\nAll this had become possible through Fulbert\'s legacy between his\r\nbrothers and unmarried sister, resulting in about L4000 apiece; besides\r\nwhich the firm had gone on prospering. Clement asked what was the\r\npresent circulation of the \'Pursuivant\', and as Lance named it,\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"What would old Froggatt have said, or even Felix?"\r\n\r\n"It is his doing," said Lance, "the lines he traced out."\r\n\r\n"My father says it is the writing with a conscience," said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Yes, with life, faculty, and point, so as to hinder the conscience from\r\nbeing a dead weight," added Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"No wonder," said Lance, "with such contributors as the Harewoods, and\r\nsuch a war-correspondent as Aubrey May."\r\n\r\nJust then the door began to open, and a black silk personage\r\ndisconsolately exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Master Clement! Master Clem! Wherever is the boy gone, when he ought to\r\nbe in his bed?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, Sibby!" cried Lance, catching both hands, and kissing the cheery,\r\nwithered-apple cheeks of the old nurse. "You see your baby has begun to\r\nrun alone."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Master Lance, \'twas your doing. You always was the mischief."\r\n\r\n"No indeed, Sibby, the long boy did it all by himself, before ever I was\r\nin the house; but I\'ll bring him back again."\r\n\r\n"May I not stay a little longer, Sibby," said Clement, rather piteously,\r\n"to hear Lance sing? I have been looking forward to it all day."\r\n\r\n"If ye\'ll take yer jelly, sir," said Sibby, "as it\'s fainting ye\'ll be,\r\nand bringing our hearts into our mouths."\r\n\r\nSo Sibby administered her jelly, and heard histories of Lance\'s\r\nchildren, then, after exacting a promise that Master Lance should only\r\nsing once, she withdrew, as peremptory and almost as happy as in her\r\nonce crowded nursery.\r\n\r\n"What shall that once be, Clem?" asked Lance.\r\n\r\n"\'Lead, kindly Light.\'"\r\n\r\n"Is it not too much?" he inquired, glancing towards his widowed sister.\r\n\r\n"I want it as much as he does," she answered fervently.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-eight Lance\'s voice was, if possible, more perfect in\r\nsweetness, purity, and expression than it had been at twenty, and never\r\nhad the poem, connected with all the crises of their joint lives, come\r\nmore home to their hearts, filling them with aspiration as well as\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThen Lance helped his brother up, and was surprised, after those\r\ncheerful tones, to feel the weight so prone and feeble, that Gerald\'s\r\nsupport on the other side was welcome. Mrs. Grinstead followed to take\r\nGertrude to her room and find her children\'s photographs.\r\n\r\nThe two young people began to smile as soon as they were left alone.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see Bexley?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"Yes--an awful hole," and both indulged in a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n"My mother mentions it with pious horror," said Anna.\r\n\r\n"Life is much more interesting when it is from hand to mouth," said\r\nGerald, with a yawn. "If I went in for sentiment, which I don\'t, it\r\nwould be for Fiddler\'s Ranch; though it is now a great city called\r\nViolinia, with everything like everything else everywhere."\r\n\r\n"Not Uncle Lance."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. For a man with that splendid talent to bury it behind a\r\ncounter, mitigated by a common church organ, is as remarkable as absurd;\r\nthough he seems to thrive on it. It is a treat to see such innocent\r\nrapture, all genuine too!"\r\n\r\n"You worn-out old man!" laughed Anna. "Aunt Cherry has always said that\r\nself-abnegation is the secret of Uncle Lance\'s charm."\r\n\r\n"All very well in that generation--ces bons jours quand nous etions\r\nsi miserables," said Gerald, in his low, maundering voice. "Prosperity\r\nmeans the lack of object."\r\n\r\n"Does it?"\r\n\r\n"In these days when everything is used up."\r\n\r\n"Not to those two--"\r\n\r\n"Happy folk, never to lose the sense of achievement!"\r\n\r\n"Poor old man! You talk as if you were twenty years older than Uncle\r\nLance."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think I am, and that I left my youth at Fiddler\'s Ranch."\r\n\r\nWherewith he strolled to the piano, and began to improvise something so\r\nyearning and melancholy that Anna was not sorry when her uncle came back\r\nand mentioned the tune the old cow died of.\r\n\r\nWas Gerald, the orphan of Fiddler\'s Ranch, to be always the spoilt child\r\nof prosperity and the creature of modern life, with more aspirations\r\nthan he saw how to fulfil, hampered as he was by duties, scruples, and\r\naffections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. -- DARBY AND JOAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        My reason haply more\r\n     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;\r\n     But now I see our lances are but straws!\r\n                                        SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLancelot saw his brother\'s doctors the next morning, and communicated\r\nto his wife the upshot of the interview when they were driving to their\r\nmeeting in Mrs. Grinstead\'s victoria, each adorned with a big bunch of\r\nprimroses.\r\n\r\n"Two doctors! and not Tom," said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Both Brownlows. Tom knows them well, and wrote. One lives at the\r\nEast-end, and is sheet anchor to Whittingtonia. He began with Clement,\r\nbut made the case over to the cousin, the fashionable one, when we made\r\nthe great removal."\r\n\r\n"So they consulted?"\r\n\r\n"And fairly see the way out of the wood, though not by any means quit of\r\nit, poor Tina; but there\'s a great deal to be thankful for," said Lance,\r\nwith a long breath.\r\n\r\n"Indeed there is!" said the wife, with a squeeze of the hand. "But is\r\nthere any more to be feared?"\r\n\r\n"Everything," Lance answered; "heart chiefly, but the lungs are not\r\nsafe. He has been whirling his unfortunate machine faster and faster,\r\ntill no wonder the mainspring has all but broken down. His ideal always\r\nwas working himself to death, and only Felix could withhold him, so\r\nnow he has fairly run himself down. No rest from that tremendous parish\r\nwork, with the bothers about curates, school boards and board schools,\r\nand the threatened ritual prosecution, which came to nothing, but\r\nworried him almost as much as if it had gone on, besides all the trouble\r\nabout poor Alda, and the loss of Fulbert took a great deal out of him.\r\nWhen Somers got a living, there was no one to look after him, and he\r\nnever took warning. So when in that Stinksmeech Mission he breathed\r\npestiferous air and drank pestiferous water, he was finished up. They\'ve\r\ngot typhus down there--a very good thing too," he added vindictively.\r\n\r\n"I put it further back than Mr. Somers\' going," said Gertrude. "He never\r\nwas properly looked after since Cherry married. What is he to do now?"\r\n\r\n"Just nothing. If he wishes to live or have a chance of working again,\r\nhe must go to the seaside and vegetate, attempt nothing for the next six\r\nmonths, nor even think about St. Matthew\'s for a year, and, as they told\r\nme afterwards, be only able to go on cautiously even then."\r\n\r\n"How did he take it?"\r\n\r\n"He laid his head against Cherry, who was standing by his chair, put\r\nan arm round her, and said, \'There!\' and she gave him such a smile as\r\nI would not have missed seeing on any account. \'Mine now,\' she said.\r\n\'Best!\' he said. He is too much tired and worn out to vex himself about\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Where are they to go? Not to Ewmouth, or all the family worries would\r\ncome upon them. Alda would give him no peace."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not there. Brownlow advises Rockquay. His delicate brother is\r\na curate there, and it agrees with him better than any other place. So\r\nI am to go and see for a house for them. It is the very best thing for\r\nCherry."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is. Was not she like herself last night? Anna says she has\r\nnever brightened up so much before! I do believe that if Clement goes on\r\nmending, the dear person will have a good time yet; nay, all the better\r\nnow that she is free to be a thorough-going Underwood again."\r\n\r\n"You Underwooder than Underwood!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly! I never did like--Yes, Lance, I am going to have it out. I do\r\nthink Clement would have done better to let her alone."\r\n\r\n"He did let her alone. He told me so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but she let out to me the difference between that time and the one\r\nof the first offer when dear Felix could not keep back his delight at\r\nkeeping her; whereas she could not help seeing that she was a burthen on\r\nClement\'s soul, between fear of neglecting her and that whirl of parish\r\nwork, and that St. Wulstan\'s Hall was wanted for the girls\' school.\r\nBesides, Wilmet persuaded her."\r\n\r\n"She did. But it turned out well. The old man worshipped her, and she\r\nwas very fond of him."\r\n\r\n"Oh! very well in a way, but you know better, Lance."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps he did not begin young enough. He was a good, religious\r\nman, but Pro Ecclesia Dei had not been his war-cry from his youth, and\r\nhe did not understand, and thought it clerical; good, but outside his\r\nlife. Still, she was happy."\r\n\r\n"Petting, Society, Art, travels! I had rather have had our two first\r\nyears of tiffs than all that sort of happiness."\r\n\r\n"Tiffs! I thought we might have gone in for the Dunmow flitch."\r\n\r\n"You might! Do you mean that you forget how fractious and nasty and\r\nabominable I was, and how many headaches I gave you?"\r\n\r\n"Only what you had to put up with."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t recollect that first visit of my father\'s, when I was so\r\nfrightfully cross because you said we must ask the Lambs and Bruces to\r\ndinner? You came down in the morning white as a ghost, an owl in its\r\nblinkers, and though I know you would rather have died than have uttered\r\na word, no sooner were you off than he fell upon me with, \'Mrs. Daisy,\r\nI give you to understand that you haven\'t a husband made of such tough\r\ncommodity as you are used to at home, and if you worry him you will have\r\nto rue it.\'"\r\n\r\n"What an ass I must have looked! Did I really go playing the martyr?"\r\n\r\n"A very smiling martyr, pretending to be awfully jolly. I believe I\r\nrequited papa by being very cross."\r\n\r\n"At his interfering, eh? No wonder."\r\n\r\n"Chiefly to conceal my fright, but I did begin trying not to fly out as\r\nI used to do, and I was frightened whenever I did so."\r\n\r\n"Poor Daisy! That is why you always seemed to think every headache your\r\nfault."\r\n\r\n"The final effect--I won\'t say cure--was from that book on education\r\nwhich said that a child should never know a cross word or look between\r\nfather and mother. So you really have forgotten how horrid I could be?"\r\n\r\n"Or never felt it! But to return to our muttons. I can\'t believe\r\notherwise than that Cherry liked her old man, and if their parallel\r\nlines did not meet, she never found it out."\r\n\r\n"That is true. She liked him and leant on him, and was constantly\r\npleased and amused as well as idolized, but I don\'t think the deep\r\nplaces in her heart were stirred. Then there were constraints. He could\r\nnot stand Angela\'s freaks. And his politics--"\r\n\r\n"He was not so very much advanced."\r\n\r\n"Enough not to like the \'Pursuivant\' to lie about, nor her writing for\r\nit, even about art or books; nor did his old bones enjoy the rivers at\r\nVale Leston. Now you will see a rebound."\r\n\r\n"Or will she be too tender of him to do what he disliked?"\r\n\r\n"That will be the test. Now she has Clement, I expect an article will\r\ncome on the first book they read together."\r\n\r\nLance laughed, but returned to defend his sister.\r\n\r\n"Indeed she was attached to him. She was altogether drooping and crushed\r\nat Vale Leston in the autumn."\r\n\r\n"It was too soon. She was overdone with the multitudes, and in fact it\r\nwas more the renewal of the old sorrow than the new one. Anna tells me\r\nthat when they returned there was the same objectless depression. She\r\nwould not take up her painting again, she said it was of no use, there\r\nwas no one to care. I remember her being asked once to do something for\r\nthe Kyrle Society, and Mr. Grinstead did not like it, but now Clement\'s\r\nillness has made a break, and in a new place, with him to occupy her\r\ninstead of only that dawdling boy, you will see what you shall see!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Gerald!" was the answer, in a doubtful, wistful tone, just as they\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. -- SLUM, SEA, OR SEASON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     For in spite of all her mother had taught her,\r\n     She was really remarkably fond of the water.\r\n                                            JANE TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lancelot Underwood had not long been gone to their meeting\r\nwhen there ran into the drawing-room a girl a year older than Anna, with\r\na taller, better figure, but a less clear complexion, namely Emilia, the\r\nadopted child of Mr. Travis Underwood. She found Anna freshening up the\r\nflowers, and Gerald in an arm-chair reading a weekly paper.\r\n\r\n"I knew I should find you," she cried, kissing Anna, while Gerald held\r\nout a finger or two without rising. "I thought you would not be gone\r\nprimrosing."\r\n\r\n"A perspicacity that does you credit," said Gerald, still behind his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n"Are the cousins gone?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"Of course they are; Cousin Marilda, in a bonnet like a primrose bank,\r\nis to pick up Fernan somewhere, but I told her I was too true to my\r\nprinciples to let wild horses drag me there."\r\n\r\n"Let alone fat tame ones," ejaculated Gerald.\r\n\r\n"What did she say?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she opened her eyes, and said she never should ask any one to\r\nact against principles, but principles in her time were for Church and\r\nState. Is Aunt Cherry in the vortex?"\r\n\r\n"No, she is reading to Uncle Clem, or about the house somewhere. I don\'t\r\nthink she would go now at least."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Grin\'s memory would forbid," muttered Gerald. "He saw a good many\r\nthings, though he was a regular old-fashioned Whig, an Edinburgh Review\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got the \'Censor\' there! Oh, let me see it. My respected cousins\r\ndon\'t think it good for little girls. What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I believe the doctors want Uncle Clem to get a long leave of absence,\r\nand that we shall go to the seaside," replied Anna.\r\n\r\n"Oh! then you will come to us for the season! We reckon on it."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Emmie, I don\'t see how I can. Those two are not in the\r\nleast fit to go without some one."\r\n\r\n"But then mother is reckoning on our having a season together. You lost\r\nthe last."\r\n\r\nGerald laughed a little and hummed--\r\n\r\n\r\n          "If I were na to marry a rich sodger lad\r\n           My friends would be dismal, my minnie be mad."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so disgusting, Gerald! My friends have too much sense," cried\r\nAnna.\r\n\r\n"But it is true enough as regards \'my minnie,\'" said Emilia.\r\n\r\n"Well, eight daughters _are_ serious--baronet\'s daughters!" observed\r\nGerald in his teasing voice.\r\n\r\n"Tocherless lasses without even the long pedigree," laughed Anna. "Poor\r\nmother."\r\n\r\n"The pedigree is long enough to make her keep poor Vale Leston suitors\r\nat arm\'s length," mumbled Gerald; but the sisters did not hear him, for\r\nEmilia was exclaiming--\r\n\r\n"I mean to be a worker. I shall make Marilda let me have hospital\r\ntraining, and either go out to Aunt Angela or have a hospital here. Come\r\nand help me, Annie."\r\n\r\n"I have a hospital here," laughed Anna.\r\n\r\n"But, Nan dear, do come! You know such lots of swells. You would get one\r\ninto real society if one is to have it; Lady Rotherwood, Lady Caergwent,\r\nbesides all your delightful artist friends; and that would pacify\r\nmother, and make it so much pleasanter for me. Oh, if you knew what the\r\nevenings are!"\r\n\r\n"What an inducement!"\r\n\r\n"It would not be so if Annie were there. We should go out, and miss the\r\nhorrid aldermanic kind of dinners; and at home, when we had played the\r\ntwo old dears to sleep, as I have to do every night, while they nod over\r\ntheir piquet or backgammon, we could have some fun together! Now, Annie,\r\nyou would like it. You do care for good society, now don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I did enjoy it very much when Aunt Cherry went with me, but--"\r\n\r\n"No buts, no buts. You would come to the laundry girls, and the\r\ncooking-class, and all the rest with me, and we should not have a dreary\r\nmoment. Have you done fiddling over those flowers?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet; Vale Leston flowers, you know. Besides, Aunt Cherry can\'t bear\r\nthem not artistic."\r\n\r\n"Tidy is enough for Marilda. She does them herself, or the housekeeper;\r\nI can\'t waste time worrying over them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the reason they always look like a gardener\'s prize bouquet at a\r\ncountry horticultural show," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"What does it signify? They are only a testimony to Sir Gorgias Midas\'\r\nriches. I do hate orchids."\r\n\r\n"I wish them on their native rocks, poor things," said Gerald. "But poor\r\nFernan, you do him an injustice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, he does quantities of good works, and so does Marilda, till I\r\nam quite sick of hearing of them! The piles of begging letters they get!\r\nAnd then they want them read and explained, and answered sometimes."\r\n\r\n"A means of good works," observed Gerald.\r\n\r\n"How would you like it? Docketing the crumbs from Dives\' table,"\r\nexclaimed Emilia.\r\n\r\n"A clerk or secretary could do it," said Anna.\r\n\r\n"Of course. Now if you have finished those flowers, do come out with me.\r\nI want to go into Ponter\'s Court, and Fernan won\'t let me go alone."\r\n\r\n"Have you any special object?" said Gerald lazily, "or is it to refresh\r\nyourself with the atmosphere?"\r\n\r\n"That dear boy--that Silky--has been taken up, and they\'ve sent him to a\r\nreformatory."\r\n\r\n"What a good thing!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, only I don\'t believe he did it! It was that nasty little Bill\r\nNosey. I am sure that he got hold of the lady\'s parcel, and stuffed it\r\ninto Silky\'s cap."\r\n\r\nEmilia spoke with a vehemence that made them both laugh, and Gerald\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"But if he is in a reformatory, what then? Are we to condole with his\r\nafflicted family, or bring Bill Nosey to confess?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I would see about it," said Emilia vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Well, I decline to walk in the steps of the police as an amateur! How\r\nabout the Dicksons?"\r\n\r\n"Drifted away no one knows where. That\'s the worst of it. Those poor\r\nthings do shift about so."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I thought we had got hold of those boys with the gymnasium. But\r\nwork wants regulating."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gerald, I am glad you are coming. Now I am free! Just fancy, they\r\nhad a horrid, stupid, slow dinner-party on Easter Monday, of all the\r\nburgomasters and great One-eyers, and would not let me go down and sing\r\nto the match-girls!"\r\n\r\n"You had the pleasure of a study of the follies of wealth instead of the\r\nfollies of poverty."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to hear Mrs. Brown discourse on her troubles with her first,\r\nsecond, and third coachman!"\r\n\r\n"Was the irresistible Ferdinand Brown there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, with diamond beetle studs and a fresh twist to his\r\nmoustache. It has grown long enough to be waxed."\r\n\r\n"How happy that fellow would be if he were obliged to dig! I should like\r\nto scatter his wardrobe over Ponter\'s Court."\r\n\r\n"There, Nan, have you finished?" as Anna swept the scattered leaves into\r\na basket. "Are you coming?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall. You would only talk treason--well--social\r\ntreason all the way, and you don\'t want me, and Aunt Cherry would have\r\nto lunch alone, unless you wait till after."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I know a scrumptious place for lunch," said Gerald. "You are\r\nright, Annie, one lady is quite enough on one\'s hands in such regions.\r\nYou have no jewellery, Emmie?"\r\n\r\n"Do you see any verdure about me?" she retorted.\r\n\r\nSo when Gerald\'s tardy movements had been overcome, off they started\r\nto their beloved slum, Emilia looking as if she were setting forth for\r\nElysium, and they were seen no more, even when five o\'clock tea was\r\nspread, and Anna making it for her Uncle Lance and his wife, who had\r\njust returned, full of political news; and likewise Lance said that he\r\nhad picked up some intelligence for his sister. He had met General Mohun\r\nand Sir Jasper Merrifield, both connections of the Underwoods.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mohun lived with his sister at Rockstone, Sir Jasper, his\r\nbrother-in-law, at Clipstone, not far off, and they both recommended\r\nRockquay and its bay "with as much praise," said Lance, "as the\r\ninhabitants ever give of a sea place."\r\n\r\n"Very good, except for the visitors," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so. Over-built, over-everythinged, but still tolerable. The\r\nGeneral lives there with his sister, and promises to write to me about\r\nhouses, and Sir Jasper in a house a few miles off."\r\n\r\n"He is Bernard\'s father-in-law?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gertrude; "and my brother Harry married a sister of Lady\r\nMerrifield, a most delightful person as ever I saw. We tell my father\r\nthat if she were not out in New Zealand we should all begin to be\r\njealous, he is so enthusiastic about Phyllis."\r\n\r\n"You have never told us how Dr. May is."\r\n\r\n"It is not easy to persuade him that he is not as young as he was," said\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\n"I should say he was," observed Lance.\r\n\r\n"In heart--that\'s true," said Gertrude; "but he does get tired, and goes\r\nto sleep a good deal, but he likes to go and see his old patients, as\r\nmuch as they like to have him, and Ethel is always looking after him. It\r\nis just her life now that Cocksmoor has grown so big and wants her less.\r\nThings do settle themselves. If any one had told her twenty years ago\r\nthat Richard would have a great woollen factory living, and Cocksmoor\r\nand Stoneborough meet, and a separate parish be made, with a disgusting\r\npaper-mill, two churches, and a clergyman\'s wife--(what\'s the female of\r\nwhipper-snapper, Lance?)--who treats her as--"\r\n\r\n"As an extinct volcano," murmured Lance.\r\n\r\n"She would have thought her heart would be broken," pursued Gertrude.\r\n"Whereas now she owns that it is the best thing, and a great relief,\r\nfor she could not attend to Cocksmoor and my father both. We want her to\r\ntake a holiday, but she never will. Once she did when Blanche and Hector\r\ncame to stay, but he was not happy, hardly well, and I don\'t think she\r\nwill ever leave him again."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Rivers is working still in London?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I don\'t know what the charities of all kinds and descriptions\r\nwould do without her."\r\n\r\n"No," said Clement from his easy-chair. "She is a most valuable person.\r\nShe has such good judgment."\r\n\r\n"It has been her whole life ever since poor George Rivers\' fatal\r\naccident," said Gertrude. "I hardly remember her before she was married,\r\nexcept a sense that I was naughty with her, and then she was terribly\r\nsad. But since she gave up Abbotstoke to young Dickie May she has\r\nbeen much brighter, and she can do more than any one at Cocksmoor. She\r\nmanages Cocksmoor and London affairs in her own way, and has two houses\r\nand young Mrs. Dickie on her hands to boot."\r\n\r\n"How many societies is she chairwoman of?" said Lance. "I counted\r\ntwenty-four pigeon-holes in her cabinet one day, and I believe there was\r\na society for each of them; but I must say she is quiet about them."\r\n\r\n"It is fine to see the little hen-of-the-walk of Cocksmoor lower her\r\ncrest to her!" said Gertrude, "when Ethel has not thought it worth while\r\nto assert herself, being conscious of being an old fogey."\r\n\r\n"And your Bishop?"\r\n\r\n"Norman? I do believe he is coming home next year. I think he really\r\nwould if papa begged him, but that he--my father, I mean--said he would\r\nnever do so; though I believe nothing would be such happiness to him\r\nas to have Norman and Meta at home again. You know they came home on\r\nGeorge\'s death, but then those New Somersetas went and chose him Bishop,\r\nand there he is for good."\r\n\r\n"For good indeed," said Clement; "he is a great power there."\r\n\r\n"So are his books," added Geraldine. "Will Harewood sets great store by\r\nthem. Ah! I hear our young folks--or is that a carriage?"\r\n\r\nEmilia and Gerald came in simultaneously with Marilda, expanded into a\r\nportly matron, as good-humoured as ever, and better-looking than long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nShe was already insisting on Gerald\'s coming to a party of hers and\r\nbringing his violin, and only interrupted her persuasions to greet and\r\ncongratulate Clement.\r\n\r\nGerald, lying back on a sofa, and looking tired, only replied in a\r\nbantering, lazy manner.\r\n\r\n"Ah! if I asked you to play to the chimney-sweeps," she said, "you would\r\ncome fast enough, you idle boy. And you, Annie, do you know you are\r\ncoming to me for the season when your uncle and aunt go out of town?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Cousin Marilda, thank you, I don\'t know it, and I don\'t believe\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Ah, we\'ll see! You haven\'t thought of the dresses you two are to have\r\nfor the Drawing-Room from Worth\'s, and Lady Caergwent to present you."\r\n\r\nAnna shook her head laughingly, while Gerald muttered--\r\n\r\n"Salmon are caught with gay flies."\r\n\r\nThey closed round the tea-table while Marilda sighed--\r\n\r\n"Alda\'s daughters are not like herself."\r\n\r\n"A different generation," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"See the Beggars Opera," said Lance--\r\n\r\n\r\n    "\'I wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter,\r\n      For when she\'s drest with care and cost, and made all neat and gay,\r\n      As men should serve a cucumber, she throws herself away.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ah! your time has not come yet, Lance. Your little girls are at a\r\ncomfortable age."\r\n\r\n"There are different ways of throwing oneself away," said Clement.\r\n"Perhaps each generation says it of the next."\r\n\r\n"Emmie is not throwing herself away, except her chances," said Marilda.\r\n"If she would only think of poor Ferdy Brown, who is as good a fellow as\r\never lived!"\r\n\r\n"Not much chance of that," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes all met as each had glanced at the tea-table, where Emilia\r\nand Gerald were looking over a report together, but Geraldine shook her\r\nhead. She was sure that Gerald did not think of his cousins otherwise\r\nthan as sisters, but she was by no means equally sure of Emilia, to whom\r\nhe was certainly a hero.\r\n\r\nAnna had not heard the last of the season. Her mother wrote to her, and\r\nalso to Geraldine, whom she piteously entreated not to let Anna lose\r\nanother chance, in the midst of her bloom, when she could get good\r\nintroductions, and Marilda would do all she could for her.\r\n\r\nBut Anna was obdurate. She should never see any one in society like\r\nUncle Clem. She had had a taste two years ago, and she wished for no\r\nmore. She should see the best pictures at the studios before leaving\r\ntown, and she neither could nor would leave her uncle and aunt to\r\nthemselves. So the matter remained in abeyance till the place of sojourn\r\nhad been selected and tried; and meantime Gerald spent what remained of\r\nthe Easter vacation in a little of exhibitions with Anna, a little of\r\nslumming with Emilia, a little of society impartially with swells and\r\nartists, and a good deal of amiable lounging and of modern reading of\r\nall kinds. His aunt watched, enjoyed, yet could not understand, his\r\nuncle said, that he was an undeveloped creature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. -- A HAPPY SPRITE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Such trifles will their hearts engage,\r\n       A shell, a flower, a feather;\r\n     If none of these, a cup of joy\r\n       It is to be together.--ISAAC WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA retired soldier, living with his sister in a watering-place, is apt to\r\nform to himself regular habits, of which one of the most regular is the\r\nwalking to the station in quest of his newspaper. Here, then, it was\r\nthat the tall, grey-haired, white-moustached General Mohun beheld,\r\nemerging on the platform, a slight figure in a grey suit, bag in hand,\r\naccompanied by a pretty pink-cheeked, fair-haired, knicker-bockered\r\nlittle boy, whose air of content and elation at being father\'s companion\r\nmade his sapphire eyes goodly to behold.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood! I am glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"I thought I would run down and look at the house you were so good as to\r\nmention for my sister, and let this chap have a smell of the sea."\r\n\r\nThere was a contention between General Mohun\'s hospitality and\r\nLancelot\'s intention of leaving his bag at the railway hotel, but the\r\nformer gained the day, the more easily because there was an assurance\r\nthat the nephew who slept at Miss Mohun\'s for the sake of his day-school\r\nwould take little Felix Underwood under his protection, and show him his\r\ncuriosities. The boy\'s eyes grew round, and he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Foolish guillemots\' eggs?"\r\n\r\n"He is in the egg stage," said his father, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t answer for guillemots," said the General, "but nothing seems to\r\ncome amiss to Fergus, though his chief turn is for stones."\r\n\r\nThere was a connection between the families, Bernard Underwood, the\r\nyoungest brother of Lance, having married the elder sister of the\r\naforesaid Fergus Merrifield. Miss Mohun, the sister who made a home for\r\nthe General, had looked out the house that Lance had come to inspect.\r\nAs it was nearly half-past twelve o\'clock, the party went round by the\r\nschool, where, in the rear of the other rushing boys, came Fergus, in\r\nall the dignity of the senior form.\r\n\r\n"Look at him," said the General, "those are honours one only gets once\r\nor twice in one\'s life, before beginning at the bottom again."\r\n\r\nFergus graciously received the introduction; and the next sound that\r\nwas heard was, "Have you any good fossils about you?" in a tone as if\r\nhe doubted whether so small a boy knew what a fossil meant; but little\r\nFelix was equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\n"I once found a shepherd\'s crown, and father said it was a fossil\r\nsea-urchin, and that they are alive sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Echini. Oh yes--recent, you mean. There are lots of them here. I don\'t\r\ngo in for those mere recent things," said Fergus, in a pre-Adamite tone,\r\n"but my sister does. I can take you down to a fisherman who has always\r\ngot some."\r\n\r\n"Father, may I? I\'ve got my eighteenpence," asked the boy, turning up\r\nhis animated face, while Fergus, with an air of patronage, vouched for\r\nthe honesty of Jacob Green, and undertook to bring his charge back in\r\ntime for luncheon.\r\n\r\nLancelot Underwood had entirely got over that sense of being in a false\r\nposition which had once rendered society distasteful to him. Many more\r\nmen of family were in the like position with himself than had been\r\nthe case when his brother had begun life; moreover, he had personally\r\nachieved some standing and distinction through the \'Pursuivant\'.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mohun was delighted with his companion, whom he presented to his\r\nsister as the speedy consequence of her recommendation. She was rather\r\nsurprised at the choice of an emissary, but her heart was won when she\r\nfound Mr. Underwood as deep in the voluntary school struggle as she\r\ncould be. Her brother held up his hands, and warned her that it was\r\nquite enough to be in the fray without going over it again, and that the\r\nbreath of parish troubles would frighten away the invalid.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll promise not to molest him," she said.\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Lance, "one can look at other people\'s parishes more\r\nphilosophically than at one\'s own."\r\n\r\nHe had begun to grow a little anxious about his boy, but presently from\r\nthe garden, up from the cliff-path, the two bounded in--little Felix\r\nwith the brightest of eyes and rosiest of cheeks, and a great ruddy,\r\nwhite-beaded sea-urchin held in triumph in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please," he cried, "my hands are too dirty to shake; we\'ve been\r\ndigging in the sand. It\'s too splendid! And they ought to have spines.\r\nWhen they are alive they walk on them. There\'s a bay! Oh, do come down\r\nand look for them."\r\n\r\n"And pray what would become of Aunt Cherry\'s house, sir? Miss Mohun, may\r\nI take him to make his paws presentable?"\r\n\r\n"A jolly little kid," pronounced Fergus, lingering before performing the\r\nsame operation, "but he has not got his mind opened to stratification,\r\nand only cares for recent rubbish. I wish it was a half-holiday, I would\r\nshow him something!"\r\n\r\nThe General, who had a great turn for children, and for the chase in\r\nany form, was sufficiently pleased with little Felix\'s good manners\r\nand bright intelligence about bird, beast, and fish, as to volunteer\r\nto conduct him to the region most favourable to spouting razor-fish and\r\nambulatory sea-urchins. The boy turned crimson and gasped--\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you indeed," said his father, when he had been carried off to\r\ninspect Fergus\'s museum in the lumber-room. "\'To see a real General out\r\nof the wars\' was one great delight in coming here, though I believe he\r\nwould have been no more surprised to hear that you had been at Agincourt\r\nthan in Afghanistan. \'It\'s in history,\' he said with an awe-stricken\r\nvoice."\r\n\r\nWhen Fergus, after some shouting, was torn from his beloved museum,\r\nFelix came down in suppressed ecstasy, declaring it the loveliest and\r\nmost delicious of places, all bones and stones, where his father must\r\ncome and see what Fergus thought was a megatherium\'s tooth. The long\r\nword was pronounced with a triumphant delicacy of utterance, amid\r\ndancing bounds of the dainty, tightly-hosed little legs.\r\n\r\nThe General and his companion went their way, while the other two had a\r\nmore weary search, resulting in the choice of not the most inviting of\r\nthe houses, but the one soonest available within convenient distance of\r\nchurch and sea. When it came to practical details, Miss Mohun was struck\r\nby the contrast between her companion\'s business promptness and the\r\nrapt, musing look she had seen when she came on him listening to the\r\nmeasured cadence of the waves upon the cliffs, and the reverberations\r\nin the hollows beneath. And when he went to hire a piano she, albeit\r\nunmusical, was struck by what her ears told her, yet far more by the\r\nlook of reverent admiration and wonder that his touch and his technical\r\nremarks brought out on the dealer\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Has that man, a bookseller and journalist, missed his vocation?" she\r\nsaid to herself. "Yet he looks too strong and happy for that. Has he\r\nconquered something, and been the better for it?"\r\n\r\nHe made so many inquiries about Fergus and his school, that she began\r\nto think it must be with a view to his own pretty boy, who came back\r\nall sea-water and ecstasy, with a store of limpets, sea-weeds, scales,\r\npurses, and cuttle-fish\'s backbones for the delectation of his sisters.\r\nAbove all, he was eloquent on the shell of a lacemaker crab, all\r\nover prickles, which he had seen hanging in the window of a little\r\ntobacconist. He had been so much fascinated by it that General Mohun\r\nregretted not having taken him to buy it, though it appeared to be\r\ndisplayed more for ornament than for sale.\r\n\r\n"It is a disgusting den," added the General, "with \'Ici on parle\r\nFrancais\' in the window, and people hanging about among whom I did not\r\nfancy taking the boy."\r\n\r\n"I know the place," said Miss Mohun. "Strange to say, it produces rather\r\na nice girl, under the compulsion of the school officer. She is plainly\r\nhalf a foreigner, and when Mr. Flight got up those theatricals last\r\nwinter she sung most sweetly, and showed such talent that I thought it\r\nquite dangerous."\r\n\r\n"I remember," said her brother. "She was a fairy among the clods."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, to the amazement of Miss Mohun, who thought herself\r\none of the earliest of risers, she not only met the father and son at\r\nearly matins, but found that they had been out for two hours enjoying\r\nsea-side felicity, watching the boats come in, and delighting in the\r\nbeauty of the fresh mackerel.\r\n\r\n"If they had not all been dead!" sighed the tender-hearted little\r\nfellow. "But I\'ve got my lacemaker for Audrey."\r\n\r\n"\'The carapace of a pagurus,\' as Fergus translated it." Adding, "I don\'t\r\nknow the species."\r\n\r\n"I can find out when father has time to let us look at the big natural\r\nhistory book in the shop," said Felix. "We must not look at it unless he\r\nturns it over, so Pearl and I are saving up to buy it."\r\n\r\n"For instance!" said his father, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could not help getting something for them all," pleaded the boy,\r\n"and pagurus was not dear. At least he is, in the other way."\r\n\r\n"Take care, Fely--he won\'t stand caresses. I should think he was the\r\nfirst crab ever so embraced."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you got entrance so early in the day," said Miss Mohun.\r\n\r\n"The girl was sweeping out the shop, and singing the morning hymn,\r\nso sweetly and truly, that it would have attracted me anyway," said\r\nLancelot. "No doubt the seafaring men want \'baccy at all hours. She\r\nwas much amazed at our request, and called her mother, who came out in\r\nremarkable dishabille, and is plainly foreign. I can\'t think where\r\nI have seen such a pair of eyes--most likely in the head of some\r\nchorus-singer, indeed the voice had something of the quality. Anyway,\r\nshe stared at me to the full extent of them."\r\n\r\nSo Lancelot departed, having put in hand negotiations for a tolerable\r\nhouse not far from St. Andrew\'s Church, and studied the accommodation\r\navailable for horses, and the powers of the pianos on hire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. -- ST. ANDREW\'S ROCK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Helpmates and hearthmates, gladdeners of gone years,\r\n       Tender companions of our serious days,\r\n     Who colour with your kisses, smiles, and tears,\r\n       Life\'s worn web woven over wonted ways.--LYTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How does he seem now?" said Geraldine, as Lancelot came into the\r\ndrawing-room of St. Andrew\'s Rock at Rockquay, in the full glare of a\r\ncold east windy May evening.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well fagged out, but that does not greatly matter. I say,\r\nCherry, how will you stand this? Till I saw you in this den, I had no\r\nnotion how shabby, and dull, and ugly it is."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lance, if you did but know how refreshing it is to see anything\r\nshabby, and dull, and ugly," Mrs. Grinstead answered with imitative\r\ninflections, which set Anna Vanderkist off into a fit of laughter,\r\ninfecting both her uncle and aunt. The former gravely said--\r\n\r\n"If you had only mentioned it in time, I could have gratified you more\r\neffectually."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is Aunt Cherry\'s charity," said Anna, recovering. "The\r\nreflection that but for her the poor natives would never have been able\r\nto go to their German baths."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no such philanthropy, my dear. It is homeliness, or rather\r\nhomeyness, that is dear to my bourgeoise mind. I was afraid of\r\nspick-and-span, sap-green aestheticism, but those curtains have done\r\ntheir own fading in pleasing shades, that good old sofa can be lain\r\nupon, and there\'s a real comfortable crack on that frame; while as to\r\nthe chiffonier, is not it the marrow of the one Mrs. Froggatt left us,\r\nwhere Wilmet kept all the things in want of mending?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! didn\'t you shudder when she turned the key?" said Lance.\r\n\r\n"Not knowing what was good for me."\r\n\r\n"But you will send for some of our things and make it nice," entreated\r\nAnna, "or Gerald will never stay here."\r\n\r\n"Never fear; we\'ll have it presentable by the vacation. As for Uncle\r\nClement, he would never see whether he was in a hermit\'s cell, if he\r\nonly had one arm-chair and one print from Raffaelle."\r\n\r\nThere was a certain arch ring in her voice that had long been absent,\r\nand Anna looked joyous as she waited on them both.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you brought her," said Lance, as she set off with Uncle\r\nClement\'s tea.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she would not hear of the charms of the season."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for her. She is a good girl, and will be all\r\nthe happier down here, as well as better. There\'s a whole hive of\r\nMerrifields to make merry with her; and, by the bye, Cherry, what should\r\nyou think of housing a little chap for the school here where Fergus\r\nMerrifield is?"\r\n\r\n"Your dear little Felix? Delightful!"\r\n\r\n"_Ouf_! No, he is booked for our grammar school."\r\n\r\n"The grammar school was not good for any of you, except the one whom\r\nnothing hurt."\r\n\r\n"It is very different now. I have full confidence in the head, and the\r\ntone is improved throughout. Till my boys are ready for a public school\r\nI had rather they were among our own people. No, Cherry, I can\'t do it,\r\nI can\'t give up the delight of him yet; no, I can\'t, nor lose his little\r\nvoice out of the choir, and have his music spoilt."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I spoil him. I really have flogged him once," said Lance,\r\nhalf wistfully, half playfully.\r\n\r\n"How proud you are of it."\r\n\r\n"It was for maltreating little Joan Vanderkist, though if it had only\r\nbeen her brother, I should have said, \'Go it, boys.\' It was not till\r\nafterwards that it turned out that Joan was too loyal not to bear the\r\npenalty of having tied our little Audrey into a chair to be pelted with\r\nhorse-chestnuts."\r\n\r\n"At Adrian\'s bidding?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. I fancy the Harewood boys set him on. And what I thought of\r\nwas sending Adrian here to be schooled at Mrs. Edgar\'s, boarded by\r\nyou, mothered by Anna, and altogether saved from being made utterly\r\ndetestable, as he will inevitably be if he remains to tyrannize over\r\nVale Leston."\r\n\r\n"Would his mother consent?"\r\n\r\n"You know he is entirely in Clement\'s power."\r\n\r\n"It would only be another worry for Clement."\r\n\r\n"He need not have much of him, and I believe he would prefer to have him\r\nunder his own eye; and Anna will think it bliss to have him, though what\r\nit may prove is another question. She will keep you from being too much\r\nbothered."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lance, will you never understand, that as furze and thistles\r\nare to a donkey, so are shabbiness and bother to me--a native element?"\r\n\r\nIn the morning Clement, raised on his pillows in bed, showed himself\r\nhighly grateful for the proposal about his youngest ward.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you, Cherry," he said. "That poor boy has been very\r\nmuch on my mind. This is the way to profit by my enforced leisure."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way to make me dread him. You were to lie fallow."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. I have thirteen or fourteen years\' reading and thinking to\r\nmake up. I have done no more than get up a thing cursorily since I left\r\nVale Leston."\r\n\r\n"You are welcome to read and think, provided it is nothing more recent\r\nthan St. Chrysostom."\r\n\r\n"So here is the letter to Alda," giving it to her open.\r\n\r\n"Short and to the purpose," she said.\r\n\r\n"Alda submits to the inevitable," he said. "Don\'t appear as if she had a\r\nchoice."\r\n\r\n"Only mention the alleviations. No, you are not to get up yet. There\'s\r\nno place for you to sit in, and the east wind is not greatly mitigated\r\nby the sea air. Shall I send Anna to read to you?"\r\n\r\n"In half-an-hour, if she is ready then; meantime, those two books, if\r\nyou please."\r\n\r\nShe handed him his Greek Testament and Bishop Andrews, and repaired\r\nto the drawing-room, where she found Anna exulting in the decorations\r\nbrought from home, and the flowers brought in from an itinerant barrow.\r\n\r\n"I have been setting down what they must send us from home--your own\r\nchair and table, and the Liberty rugs, and the casts of St. Cecilia and\r\nlittle St. Cyrillus for those bare corners, and I am going out for a\r\nterra-cotta vase."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, the room is charming; but don\'t let us get too dependent\r\non pretty things. They demoralize as much or more than ugly ones."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that they are a luxury? Is it not right to try to have\r\neverything beautiful?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know!" exclaimed Anna.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I really get confused sometimes as to what is mere lust\r\nof the eye, and what is regard to whatever things are lovely. I believe\r\nthe principle is really in each case to try whether the high object or\r\nthe gratification of the senses should stand first."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Anna, laughing, "I suppose it is a high object not to\r\nalienate Gerald, as would certainly be done by the culture of the\r\nugly--"\r\n\r\n"Or rather of that which pretends to be the reverse, and is only\r\nfashion," said her aunt, who meantime was moving about, adding nameless\r\ngrace by her touch to all Anna\'s arrangements.\r\n\r\n"May I send for the things then?" said Anna demurely.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, certainly; and you had better get the study arm-chair for your\r\nuncle. There is nothing so comfortable here. But I have news for you.\r\nWhat do you say to having little Adrian here, to go to school with the\r\nMerrifield boy?"\r\n\r\n"What fun! what fun! How delicious!" cried the sister, springing about\r\nlike a child.\r\n\r\n"I suspected that the person to whom he would give most trouble would\r\nfeel it most pleasure."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what a funny, delightful child he is! You didn\'t see him\r\ndriving all the little girls in a team four-in-hand."\r\n\r\nIt would be much to say that Mrs. Grinstead was enchanted by this\r\nproof of his charms; but they were interrupted by Marshall, the polite,\r\npatronizing butler, bringing in a card. Miss Mohun would be glad to know\r\nhow Mr. Underwood was, and whether there was anything that she could do\r\nfor Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\nOf course she was asked to come in, and thus they met, the quick, slim,\r\nactive little spinster, whose whole life had been work, and the far\r\nyounger widow, whose vocation had been chiefly home-making. Their first\r\nsilent impressions were--\r\n\r\n"I hope she is not going to be pathetic," and--\r\n\r\n"She is enough to take one\'s breath away. But I think she has tact."\r\n\r\nAfter a few exchanges of inquiry and answer, Miss Mohun said--\r\n\r\n"My niece Gillian is burning to see you, after all your kindness to\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"I shall be very glad. This is not quite a land of strangers."\r\n\r\n"I told her I was sure you would not want her to-day."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. My brother is hardly up to afternoon visitors yet, and we\r\nhave not been able to arrange his refuge."\r\n\r\n"You have transformed this room."\r\n\r\n"Or Anna has."\r\n\r\nOn which Miss Mohun begged for Miss Vanderkist to meet her nieces by and\r\nby at tea. Gillian would call for her at four o\'clock, and show her the\r\nway that it was hoped might soon be quite natural to her.\r\n\r\n"Gillian\'s \'Aunt Jane,\'" said Anna, when the visitor had tripped out.\r\n"I never quite understood her way of talking of her. I think she worried\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Your pronouns are confused, Annie. Which worried which? Or was it\r\nmutual?"\r\n\r\n"On the whole," laughed Anna back, "I prefer an aunt to be waited on to\r\none who pokes me up."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Log to Aunt Stork? To be poked will be wholesome."\r\n\r\nIn due time there was a ring at the front door; Gillian Merrifield was\r\nindulged with a kiss and smile from the heroine of her worship, and\r\nAnna found herself in the midst of a garland of bright girls. She was\r\na contrast to them, with her fair Underwood complexion, her short plump\r\nVanderkist figure, and the mourning she still wore for the fatherly\r\nUncle Grinstead; while the Merrifield party were all in different shades\r\nof the brunette, and wore bright spring raiment.\r\n\r\nThey had only just come down the steps when they were greeted by a young\r\nclergyman, who said he was on his way to inquire for Mr. Underwood, and\r\nas he looked as if he expected a reply from Miss Vanderkist, she said\r\nher uncle was better, and would be glad to see Mr. Brownlow when he had\r\nrested after his journey.\r\n\r\n"I hope he will not bother him," she added; "I know who he is now. He\r\nwas at Whittingtonia for a little while, but broke down. There\'s no\r\nremembering all the curates there. My aunt likes his mother. Does he\r\nbelong to this St. Andrew\'s Church?"\r\n\r\n"No, to the old one. You begin to see the tower."\r\n\r\n"Is that where you go?"\r\n\r\n"To the old one in the morning, but we have a dear little old chapel at\r\nClipstone, where Mr. Brownlow comes for the afternoon. It is all a good\r\ndeal mixed up together."\r\n\r\nThen another voice--\r\n\r\n"Do you think Mr. Underwood would preach to us? Mr. Brownlow says he\r\nnever heard any one like him."\r\n\r\nAnna stood still.\r\n\r\n"Nobody is to dare to mention preaching to Uncle Clement for the next\r\nsix months, or they will deserve never to hear another sermon in their\r\nlives."\r\n\r\n"What an awful penalty!"\r\n\r\n"For shame, Dolores! Now," as the short remainder of a steep street was\r\nsurmounted, "here, as you may see, is the great hotel, and next beyond\r\nis Aunt Jane\'s, Beechcroft. On beyond, where you see that queer tower,\r\nis Cliff House, Mr. White\'s, who married our Aunt Adeline, only they are\r\nin Italy; and then comes Carrara, Captain Henderson\'s--"\r\n\r\n"You are expected to rave about Mrs. Henderson\'s beauty," said the\r\ncousin, Dolores Mohun, as she opened Miss Mohun\'s gate, between two\r\ncopper beeches, while Anna listened to the merry tongues, almost\r\nbewildered by the chatter, so unlike the seclusion and silent watching\r\nof the last month; but when Mysie Merrifield asked, "Is it not quite\r\noverwhelming?" she said--\r\n\r\n"Oh no! it is like being among them all at Vale Leston. My sisters\r\nalways tell me my tongue wants greasing when I come down."\r\n\r\nHer tongue was to have exercise enough among the bevy of damsels who\r\nsurrounded her in Miss Mohun\'s drawing-room--four Merrifields, ranging\r\nfrom twenty-two to twelve years old, and one cousin, Dolores Mohun, with\r\na father in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you be in the Mouse-trap?" presently asked number three, by name\r\nValetta.\r\n\r\n"If I did not know that she would drag it in!" cried Dolores.\r\n\r\n"What may it be?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"An essay society and not an essay society," was the lucid answer.\r\n"Gillian said you would be sure to belong to it."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I can\'t if it takes much time," said Anna in a pleading\r\ntone. "My uncle is very far from well, and I have a good deal to do\r\nin the way of reading to him, and my little brother is coming to go to\r\nschool with yours."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood brought his little boy," said Gillian. "Fergus said he\r\nwas one of the jolliest little chaps he had ever seen."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Reginald quite lost his heart to him," said Mysie, "and Aunt Jane\r\nsays he is a charming little fellow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Felix Underwood!" said Anna. "Adrian is much more manly. You should\r\nsee him ride and climb trees."\r\n\r\nThe comparative value of brothers and cousins was very apparent.\r\nHowever, it was fixed that Anna should attend the Mouse-trap, and hear\r\nand contribute as she could find time.\r\n\r\n"I did the Erl King," said Valetta.\r\n\r\n\r\n          "\'Who rideth so late in the forest so wild?\r\n            It is the fond father and his loving child.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, spare us, Val," cried her sister Gillian. "Every one has done\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Gerald parodied mine," said Anna.\r\n\r\n\r\n          "\'Who trampeth so late in a shocking bad hat?\r\n           \'Tis the tipsy old father a-hugging his brat."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, go on."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t recollect any more, but the Erl King\'s daughter is a\r\nbeggar-woman, and it ends with--\r\n\r\n\r\n          "I\'ll give thee a tanner and make him a bait,\r\n           So in the gin palace was settled his fate."\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the party were scandalized, others laughed as much or more than\r\nthe effusion deserved.\r\n\r\n"We accept drawings," added another voice, "and if any one does anything\r\nextraordinarily good in that way, or in writing, it makes a little\r\nbook."\r\n\r\n"We have higher designs than that," said Gillian. "We want to print the\r\ncream."\r\n\r\n"For the benefit of the school board--no, the board school."\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! Valetta!" cried the general voice.\r\n\r\n"The thing is," explained Gillian, "that we must build a new school for\r\nthe out-liers of St. Kenelm\'s, or \'my lords\' will be down on us, and we\r\nshall be swamped by board schools."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Jane is frantic about it," said Dolores Mohun.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no escape from school board worries!" exclaimed Anna. "They\r\nhelped to demolish Uncle Clement."\r\n\r\n"There is to be a sale of work, and a concert, and all sorts of jolly\r\nlarks," added Valetta.\r\n\r\n"Larks! Oh, Val!"\r\n\r\n"Larks aren\'t slang. They are in the dictionary," declared Valetta.\r\n\r\n"By the bye, she has not heard the rules of the Mice," put in Mysie.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say them," volunteered Valetta the irrepressible. "Members of the\r\nMouse-trap never utter slang expressions, never wear live birds--I mean\r\ndead ones--in their hats."\r\n\r\n"Is an ostrich feather a live bird or a dead?" demanded Anna.\r\n\r\n"And," said Dolores, "what of the feather screens that the old Miss\r\nSmiths have been making all the winter-circles of pheasants\' feathers\r\nand peacocks\' eyes outside a border of drakes\' curls?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, like ostriches they don\'t count, since peacocks don\'t die, and\r\ndrakes and pheasants _must_," said Gillian.\r\n\r\n"We have been getting ready for this sale ever so long," said Mysie.\r\n"Aunt Jane has a working party every Friday for it."\r\n\r\n"The fit day," said Dolores, "for she is a perfect victim to other\r\npeople\'s bad work, and spends the evening in stitching up and making\r\npresentable the wretched garments they turn out."\r\n\r\n"The next rule--" began Valetta, but Gillian mercilessly cut her short.\r\n\r\n"You know clever people, Anna. Do you know how to manage about our\r\nMouse-trap book? Our bookseller here is a school-board man, all on\r\nthe wrong side, and when I tried to feel our way, he made out that the\r\nprinting and getting it up would cost a great deal more than we could\r\nrisk."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity that Uncle Lance is gone home," said Anna. "He could tell\r\nyou all about it."\r\n\r\n"Could you not write to him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, but I know he will want to see a specimen before he can make\r\nany estimate."\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the specimen should be forthcoming on the next\r\noccasion, and Miss Mohun coming home, and tea coming in, the conference\r\nwas ended. Anna began to unravel the relationships.\r\n\r\nDolores Mohun was a niece of Lady Merrifield. She had lost her own\r\nmother early, and after living with the Merrifields for a year, had been\r\ntaken by her father to New Zealand, where he had an appointment. He\r\nwas a man of science, and she had been with him at Rotaruna during the\r\nterrible volcanic eruption, when there had been danger and terror enough\r\nto bring out her real character, and at the same time to cause an amount\r\nof intimacy with a young lady visitor little older than herself, which\r\nhad suddenly developed into a second marriage of her father. In this\r\nstate of things she had gladly availed herself of the home offered her\r\nat Clipstone, and had gone home under the escort of her Aunt Phyllis\r\n(Mrs. Harry May), who was going with her husband to spend a year in\r\nEngland. Dolores had greatly improved in all ways during her two years\'\r\nabsence, and had become an affectionate, companionable, and thoughtful\r\nmember of the Merrifield household, though still taking a line of her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe Kalliope whom Gillian had befriended, to her own detriment, was now\r\nthe very beautiful Mrs. Henderson, wife to the managing partner in the\r\nmarble works. She continued to take a great interest in the young women\r\nemployed in designing and mosaics, and had a class of them for reading\r\nand working. Dolores had been asked to tell first Aunt Jane\'s G. F. S.\r\n(Girl\'s Friendly Society) girls, and afterwards Mrs. Henderson\'s, about\r\nher New Zealand experiences and the earthquake, and this developed into\r\nregular weekly lectures on volcanoes and on colonies. She did these\r\nso well, that she was begged to repeat them for the girls at the High\r\nSchool, and she had begun to get them up very carefully, studying the\r\nbest scientific books she could get, and thinking she saw her vocation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson was quite a power in the place. Her brother Alexis was\r\nan undergraduate, but had been promised a tutorship for the vacation.\r\nHe seldom appeared at Carrara, shrinking from what recalled the pain and\r\nshame that he had suffered; while Petros worked under Captain Henderson,\r\nand Theodore was still in the choir at St. Matthew\'s. Maura had become\r\nthe darling of Mr. White, and was much beloved by Mrs. White, though\r\nthere had been a little alarm the previous year, when Lord Rotherwood\r\nand his son came down to open a public park or garden on the top of the\r\ncliffs, where Lord Rotherwood\'s accident had occurred. Lord Ivinghoe,\r\na young Guardsman, had shown himself enough disposed to flirt with the\r\npretty little Greek to make the prudent very glad that her home was on\r\nthe Italian mountains.\r\n\r\nGillian was always Mrs. Henderson\'s friend, but Gillian\'s mind was full\r\nof other things. For her father had reluctantly promised, that if one\r\nof her little brothers got a scholarship at one of the public schools,\r\nGillian might fulfil her ardent desire of going to a ladies\' college.\r\nWilfred was a hopeless subject. It might be doubted if he could have\r\nsucceeded. He had apparently less brain power than some of the family,\r\nand he certainly would not exert what he had. His mother had dragged him\r\nthrough holiday tasks; but nobody else could attempt to make him work\r\nwhen at home, and Gillian\'s offers had been received with mockery or\r\nviolence. So all her hopes centred on Fergus, who, thanks to Aunt Jane\'s\r\nevening influence over his lessons, stood foremost in Mrs. Edgar\'s\r\nschool, and was to go up to try for election at Winchester College at\r\nthe end of the term. Were Gillian\'s hopes to be ruined by his devotion\r\nto the underground world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. -- THE HOPE OF VANDERKIST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     A breath of air,\r\n     A bullock\'s low,\r\n     A bunch of flowers,\r\n     Hath power to call from everywhere\r\n     The spirit of forgotten hours--\r\n     Hours when the heart was fresh and young,\r\n     When every string in freedom sung,\r\n     Ere life had shed one leaf of green.\r\n                              JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been some curiosity as to who would be thought worthy to bring\r\nthe precious little baronet to Rockquay, and there was some diversion,\r\nas well as joy, when it proved that no one was to be entrusted with\r\nhim but his eldest aunt, Mrs. Harewood, who was to bring him in Whitsun\r\nweek, so that he might begin with a half-term.\r\n\r\nThe arrival was a pretty sight, as the aunt rejoiced at seeing both her\r\nhosts at the front door to greet her, and as Anna held out her glad arms\r\nto the little brother who was the pride of the family.\r\n\r\n"Ha, Adrian, boy!" said the Vicar, only greeting with the hand, at sight\r\nof the impatient wriggle out of the embrace.\r\n\r\nIt was an open, sunburnt, ruddy face, and wide, fearless grey eyes that\r\nlooked up to him, the bullet head in stiff, curly flaxen hair held aloft\r\nwith an air of "I am monarch of all I survey," and there was a tone\r\nof equality in the "Holloa, Uncle Clement," to the tall clergyman who\r\ntowered so far above the sturdy little figure.\r\n\r\nPresently on the family inquiries there broke--\r\n\r\n"I say, Annie, where\'s the school?"\r\n\r\n"At the foot of this hill."\r\n\r\n"I want to see it" (imperiously).\r\n\r\n"You must have some tea first."\r\n\r\n"Then you are glad to come, Adrian?" said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Aunt Cherry. It is high time I was away from such a lot of\r\nwomen-folk," he replied, with his hands in his pockets, and his legs set\r\nlike a little colossus.\r\n\r\nAnna had no peace till, after the boy had swallowed a tolerable amount\r\nof bread-and-butter and cake, she took him out, and then Mrs. Harewood\r\nhad to explain his mother\'s urgent entreaties that the regime at Vale\r\nLeston should be followed up, and the boy see only such habits as would\r\nbe those of total abstainers.\r\n\r\nPoor woman! as her brother and sisters knew, there was reason to believe\r\nthat the vice which had been fatal to her happiness and her husband\'s\r\nlife, had descended to him from Dutch forefathers, and there was the\r\nless cause for wonder at the passionate desire to guard her son from it.\r\nAlmost all her family had been water-drinkers from infancy, and though\r\nMajor Harewood called teetotalism a superstitious contempt of Heaven\'s\r\ngood gifts, and disapproved of supplementing the baptismal vow, his\r\nbrother the Rector had found it expedient, for the sake of the parish,\r\nto embrace formally the temperance movement, and thus there had\r\nbeen little difficulty in giving way to Alda\'s desire that, at the\r\nluncheon-table, Adrian should never see wine or beer, and she insisted\r\nthat the same rule should prevail at Rockquay.\r\n\r\nClement had taken the pledge when a lad of sixteen, and there were those\r\nwho thought that, save for his persistence under warnings of failing\r\nstrength, much of his present illness might have been averted, with all\r\nthe consequent treatment. He believed in total abstinence as safer for\r\nhis ward, but he thought that the time had come for training, in seeing\r\nwithout partaking. Wilmet agreed, and said she had tried to persuade\r\nher sister; but she had only caused an hysterical agitation, so that\r\nweakness as usual gained the victory, and she had all but promised to\r\nbring the boy home again unless she could exact an engagement.\r\n\r\n"To follow the Vale Leston practice at his early dinner," said\r\nGeraldine.\r\n\r\n"That may be," said Clement; "but I do not engage not to have the matter\r\nout with him if I see that it is expedient."\r\n\r\n"I am only doubtful how Gerald will take it," said his sister.\r\n\r\n"Gerald has always been used to it at Vale Leston," said Wilmet.\r\n\r\n"True, but there he is your guest. Here he will regard himself as at\r\nhome. However, he is a good boy, and will only grumble a little for\r\nappearance sake."\r\n\r\n"I should hope so," said Wilmet severely.\r\n\r\n"How is the Penbeacon affair going on?" asked Clement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clem, I did not think you had heard of it."\r\n\r\n"I had a letter in the middle of the mission, but I could not answer it\r\nthen, and it seems to have been lost."\r\n\r\nGeraldine pronounced it the straw that broke the camel\'s back, when she\r\nheard of the company that only waited to dig china clay out of Penbeacon\r\nand wash it in the Ewe till they could purchase a slice of the hill\r\npertaining to the Vale Leston estate. Major Harewood had replied that\r\nhis fellow-trustee was too ill to attend to business, and that the\r\nmatter had better be let alone till the heir attained his majority.\r\n\r\n"Shelved for the present," said Mrs. Grinstead. "Fancy Ewe and Leston\r\ncontaminated!"\r\n\r\n"John talks to the young engineer, Mr. Bramshaw, and thinks that may be\r\nprevented; but that is not the worst," said Wilmet; "it would change the\r\nwhole face of the parish, and bring an influx of new people."\r\n\r\n"Break up Penbeacon and cover it with horrible little new houses. Men\r\nlike Walsh never see a beautiful place but they begin to think how to\r\ndestroy it."\r\n\r\n"Well, Cherry, you have the most influence with Gerald, but he talks to\r\nthe girls of our having no right to keep the treasures of the hills for\r\nour exclusive pleasure."\r\n\r\n"It is not exclusive. Half the country disports itself there. It is the\r\ngreat place for excursions."\r\n\r\n"Then he declares that it is a grave matter to hinder an industry that\r\nwould put bread into so many mouths, and that fresh outlets would be\r\ngood for the place; something too about being an obstruction, and the\r\nrights of labour."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what that means. It is only teasing the cousinhood when they\r\nfall on him open-mouthed," said Geraldine, with a laugh, though with\r\na qualm of misgiving at her heart, while Clement sat listening and\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harewood farther explained, that she hoped either that Gerald would\r\nmarry, or that her sister would make a home for him at the Priory. It\r\nthen appeared that Major Harewood thought it would be wise to leave the\r\nyoung man to manage the property for himself without interference; and\r\nthat the uncle to whom the Major had become heir was anxious to have the\r\nfamily at hand, even offering to arrange a house for Lady Vanderkist.\r\n\r\n"A year of changes," sighed Geraldine; "but this waiting time seems\r\nintended to let one gather one\'s breath."\r\n\r\nBut Wilmet looked careworn, partly, no doubt, with the harass of\r\ncontinual attention to her sister Alda, who, though subdued and improved\r\nin many important ways, was unavoidably fretful from ill-health, and\r\ndisposed to be very miserable over her straitened means, and the future\r\nlot of her eight daughters, especially as the two of the most favourable\r\nage seemed to resign their immediate chances of marrying. Moreover,\r\nthough all began life as pretty little girls, they had a propensity to\r\nturn into Dutchwomen as they grew up, and Franceska, the fifth in age,\r\nwas the only one who renewed the beauty of the twin sisters.\r\n\r\nAlda was not, however, Wilmet\'s chief care, though of that she did\r\nnot speak. She was not happy at heart about her two boys. Kester was a\r\nsoldier in India, not actually unsteady, but not what her own brothers\r\nhad been, and Edward was a midshipman, too much of the careless,\r\nwild sailor. Easy-going John Harewood\'s lax discipline had not been\r\nsuccessful with them in early youth, and still less had later severity\r\nand indignation been effectual.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you kept Anna," said Mrs. Harewood, "though Alda is very much\r\ndisappointed that she is not having a season in London."\r\n\r\n"She will not take it," said Geraldine. "She insists that she prefers\r\nUncle Clem to all the fine folk she might meet; and after all, poor\r\nMarilda\'s acquaintance are not exactly the upper ten thousand."\r\n\r\n"Poor Marilda! You know that she is greatly vexed that Emilia is bent on\r\nbeing a hospital nurse, or something like it, and only half yields to go\r\nout with her this summer in very unwilling obedience."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. She wants to come here, and I mean to have her before the\r\nlong vacation for a little while. We heard various outpourings, and I\r\ncannot quite think Miss Emilia a grateful person, though I can believe\r\nthat she does not find it lively at home."\r\n\r\n"She seems to be allowed plenty of slum work, as it is the fashion to\r\ncall it, and no one can be more good and useful than Fernan and Marilda,\r\nso that I call it sheer discontent and ingratitude not to put up with\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Only modernishness, my dear Wilmet. It is the spirit of the times, and\r\nthe young things can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to suffer in that way--at least with Anna."\r\n\r\n"No; Anna is a dear good girl, and Uncle Clem is her hero, but I am very\r\nglad she has nice young companions in the Merrifields, and an excitement\r\nin prospect in this bazaar."\r\n\r\n"I thought a bazaar quite out of your line."\r\n\r\n"There seems to be no other chance of saving this place from board\r\nschools. Two thousand pounds have to be raised, and though Lord\r\nRotherwood and Mr. White, the chief owners of property, have done,\r\nand will do, much, there still remains greater need than a fleeting\r\npopulation like this can be expected to supply, and Clement thinks that\r\na bazaar is quite justifiable in such a case."\r\n\r\n"If there is nothing undesirable," said Mrs. Harewood, in her original\r\n"what it may lead to" voice.\r\n\r\n"Trust Lady Merrifield and Jane Mohun for that! I am going to take you\r\nto call upon Lilias Merrifield."\r\n\r\n"Yea; I shall wish to see the mother of Bernard\'s wife."\r\n\r\nClement, who went with them, explained to his somewhat wondering elder\r\nsister that he thought safeguards to Christian education so needful,\r\nthat he was quite willing that, even in this brief stay, all the aid\r\nin their power should be given to the cause at Rockquay. Nay, as\r\nhe afterwards added to Wilmet, he was very glad to see how much it\r\ninterested Geraldine, and that the work for the Church and the congenial\r\nfriends were rousing her from her listless state of dejection.\r\n\r\nLady Merrifield and Mrs. Harewood were mutually charmed, perhaps all the\r\nmore because the former was not impassioned about the bazaar. She said\r\nshe had been importuned on such subjects wherever she had gone, and had\r\nlearnt to be passive; but her sister Jane was all eagerness, and her\r\nyounger young people, as she called the present half of her family, were\r\nin the greatest excitement over their first experience of the kind.\r\n\r\n"Well is it for all undertakings that there should always be somebody to\r\nwhom all is new, and who can be zealous and full of delight."\r\n\r\n"By no means surtout point de zele," returned Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"As well say no fermentation," said Lady Merrifield.\r\n\r\n"A dangerous thing," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"But sourness comes without it, or at least deadness," returned his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nWherewith they returned to talk of their common relations.\r\n\r\nIt was like a joke to the brother and sisters, that their Bernard should\r\nbe a responsible husband and father, whereas Lady Merrifield\'s notion of\r\nhim was as a grave, grand-looking man with a splendid beard.\r\n\r\nFergus Merrifield was asked to become the protector of Adrian, whereat\r\nhe looked sheepish; but after the round of pets had been made he\r\ninformed his two youngest sisters, Valetta and Primrose, that it was the\r\ncheekiest little fellow he had ever seen, who would never know if he was\r\nbullied within an inch of his life; not that he (Fergus) should let the\r\nfellows do it.\r\n\r\nSo though until Monday morning Anna was the slave of her brother, doing\r\nher best to supply the place of the six devoted sisters at home, the\r\nyoung gentleman ungratefully announced at breakfast--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want gy-arls after me," with a peculiarly contemptuous twirl at\r\nthe beginning of the word; "Merrifield is to call for me."\r\n\r\nAnna, who had brought down her hat, looked mortified.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Annie," said her uncle, "he will know better one of these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"No, I shan\'t," said Adrian, turning round defiantly. "If she comes\r\nbothering after me at dinner-time I shall throw my books at her--that\'s\r\nall! There\'s Merrifield," and he banged out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," again said his uncle, "he has had a large dose of the\r\nfeminine element, and this is his swing out of it."\r\n\r\nHopes, which Anna thought cruel, were entertained by her elders that\r\nthe varlet would return somewhat crestfallen, but there were no such\r\nsymptoms; the boy re-appeared in high spirits, having been placed well\r\nfor his years, but not too well for popularity, and in the playground\r\nhe had found himself in his natural element. The boys were mostly of his\r\nown size, or a little bigger, and bullying was not the fashion. He had\r\nheard enough school stories to be wary of boasting of his title, and\r\nas long as he did not flaunt it before their eyes, it was regarded as\r\nrather a credit to the school.\r\n\r\nMerrifield was elated at the success of his protege, and patronized\r\nhim more than he knew, accepting his devotion in a droll, contemptuous\r\nmanner, so that the pair were never willingly apart. As Fergus slept at\r\nhis aunt\'s during the week, the long summer evenings afforded splendid\r\nopportunities for what Fergus called scientific researches in the\r\nquarries and cliffs. It was as well for Lady Vanderkist\'s peace of mind\r\nthat she did not realize them, though Fergus was certified by his family\r\nto be cautious and experienced enough to be a safe guide. Perhaps people\r\nwere less nervous about sixth sons than only ones.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, a certain undeveloped idea held out that some of the\r\nduplicates of Fergus\'s precious collection might be arranged as a\r\nsample of the specimens of minerals and fossils of Rockquay at the\r\nlong-talked-of sale of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. -- THE MOUSE-TRAP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.\r\n                                        Love\'s Labour\'s Lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young ladies were truly in an intense state of excitement about the\r\nsale of work, especially about the authorship; and Uncle Lancelot having\r\npromised to send an estimate, a meeting of the Mouse-trap was convened\r\nto consider of the materials, and certainly the mass of manuscript\r\ncontributed at different times to the Mouse-trap magazine was appalling\r\nto all but Anna, who knew what was the shrinkage in the press.\r\n\r\nShe, however, held herself bound not to inflict on her busy uncle the\r\nreading of anything entirely impracticable, so she sat with a stern and\r\ncritical eye as the party mustered in Miss Mohun\'s drawing-room, and\r\nGillian took the chair.\r\n\r\n"The great design," said she impressively, "is that the Mouse-trap\r\nshould collect and print and publish a selection for the benefit of the\r\nschool."\r\n\r\nThe Mice vehemently applauded, only Miss Norton, the oldest of the\r\nparty, asked humbly--\r\n\r\n"Would any one think it worth buying?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," cried Valetta. "Lots of translations!"\r\n\r\n"The Erl King, for instance," put in Dolores Mohun.\r\n\r\n"If Anna would append the parody," suggested Gillian.\r\n\r\n"Oh, parodies are--are horrid," said Mysie.\r\n\r\n"Many people feel them so," said Gillian, "but to others I think they\r\nare almost a proof of love, that they can make sport with what they\r\nadmire so much."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Mysie, "there\'s Dolores\' Eruption!"\r\n\r\n"What a nice subject," laughed Gillian. "However, it will do\r\nbeautifully, being the description of the pink terraces of that place\r\nwith the tremendous name in New Zealand."\r\n\r\n"Were you there?" cried Anna.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I always wonder how she can look the same after such adventures,"\r\nsaid Mysie.\r\n\r\n"You know it is much the same as my father\'s paper in the Scientific\r\nWorld," said Dolores.\r\n\r\n"Nobody over reads that, so it won\'t signify," was the uncomplimentary\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n"And," added Mysie, "Mr. Brownlow would do a history of Rockquay, and\r\nthat would be worth having."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, the dear ghost and all!" cried Valetta.\r\n\r\nThe acclamation was general, for the Reverend Armine Brownlow was the\r\ncynosure curate of the lady Church-helpers, and Mysie produced as a\r\nprecious loan, to show what could be done, the volume containing the\r\nchoicest morceaux of the family magazine of his youth, the Traveller\'s\r\nJoy, in white parchment binding adorned with clematis, and emblazoned\r\nwith the Evelyn arms on one side, the Brownlow on the other, and full of\r\nphotographs and reproductions of drawings.\r\n\r\n"Much too costly," said the prudent.\r\n\r\n"It was not for sale," said Mysie, obviously uneasy while it was being\r\nhanded round.\r\n\r\n"Half-a-crown should be our outside price," said Gillian.\r\n\r\n"Or a shilling without photographs, half-a-crown with," was added.\r\n\r\n"Shall I ask Uncle Lance what can be done for how much?" asked Anna, and\r\nthis was accepted with acclamation, but, as Gillian observed, they had\r\nyet got no further than Dolores\' Eruption and the unwritten history.\r\n\r\n"There are lots of stories," said Kitty Varley; "the one about Bayard\r\nand all the knights in Italy."\r\n\r\n"The one," said Gillian, "where Padua got into the kingdom of Naples,\r\nand the lady of the house lighted a lucifer match, besides the horse who\r\ndrained a goblet of red wine."\r\n\r\n"You know that was only the pronouns," suggested the author.\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s another," added Valetta, "called Monrepos--such a beauty,\r\nwhen the husband was wounded, and died at his wife\'s feet just as the\r\nsun gilded the tops of the pines, and she died when the moon set, and\r\nthe little daughter went in and was found dead at their feet."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Val," said Gillian. "Here is a story that Bessie has sent\r\nus--really worth having."\r\n\r\n"Mesa! Oh, of course," was the acclamation.\r\n\r\n"And here\'s a little thing of mine," Gillian added modestly, "about the\r\ndevelopment of the brain."\r\n\r\nAt this there was a shout.\r\n\r\n"A little thing! Isn\'t it on the differential calculus?"\r\n\r\n"Really, I don\'t see why Rockquay should not have a little rational\r\nstudy!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! but the present question is what Rockquay will buy; to further\r\nfuture development it may be, but I am afraid their brains are not yet\r\ndeveloped enough," said Emma Norton.\r\n\r\n"Well then, here is the comparison between Euripides and Shakespeare."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you read papa and everybody to sleep with," said Valetta\r\npertly.\r\n\r\n"Except Aunt Lily, and she said she had read something very like it in\r\nSchlegel," added Dolores.\r\n\r\n"You must not be too deep for ordinary intellects, Gillian," said Emma\r\nNorton good-naturedly. "Surely there is that pretty history you made out\r\nof Count Baldwin the Pretender."\r\n\r\n"That! Oh, that is a childish concern."\r\n\r\n"The better fitted for our understandings," said Emma, disinterring it,\r\nand handing it over to Anna, while Mysie breathed out--\r\n\r\n"Oh! I did like it! And, Gill, where is Phyllis\'s account of the Jubilee\r\ngaieties and procession last year?"\r\n\r\n"That would make the fortune of any paper," said Anna.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if Lady Rotherwood will let it be used," said Gillian. "It is\r\nreally delightful and full of fun, but I am quite sure that her name\r\ncould not appear, and I do not expect leave to use it."\r\n\r\n"Shall I write and ask?" said Mysie.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, do; if Cousin Rotherwood is always gracious, it is specially to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I wrote to my cousin, Gerald Underwood," said Anna, "to ask if he had\r\nanything to spare us, though I knew he would laugh at the whole concern,\r\nand he has sent down this. I don\'t quite know whether he was in earnest\r\nor in mischief."\r\n\r\nAnd she read aloud--\r\n\r\n\r\n          "Dreaming of her laurels green,\r\n           The learned Girton girl is seen,\r\n           Or under the trapeze neat\r\n           Figuring as an athlete.\r\n\r\n           Never at the kitchen door\r\n           Will she scrub or polish more;\r\n           No metaphoric dirt she eats,\r\n           Literal dirt may form her treats.\r\n\r\n           Mary never idle sits,\r\n           Home lessons can\'t be learnt by fits;\r\n           Hard she studies all the week,\r\n           Answers with undaunted cheek.\r\n\r\n           When to exam Mary goes,\r\n           Smartly dressed in stunning clothes,\r\n           Expert in algebraic rule,\r\n           Best pupil-teacher of her school.\r\n\r\n           Oh, how clever we are found\r\n           Who live on England\'s happy ground,\r\n           Where rich and poor and wretched may\r\n           Be drilled in Whitehall\'s favoured way."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of laughter at this parody of Jane Taylor\'s\r\nVillage Girl, though Mysie was inclined to be shocked as at something\r\nprofane.\r\n\r\n"Then what will you think of this?" said Anna, beginning gravely to read\r\naloud The Inspector\'s Tour.\r\n\r\nIt was very clever, so clever that Valetta and Kitty Varley both\r\nlistened as in sober earnest, never discovering, or only in flashes\r\nlike Mysie, that it was really a satire on all the social state of the\r\ndifferent European nations, under the denomination of schools. One being\r\ndepicted as highly orthodox, but much given to sentence insubordination\r\nto dark cold closets; another as given to severe drill, but neglecting\r\nmanners; a third as repudiating religious teaching, and now and\r\nthen preparing explosions for the masters--no, teachers. The various\r\nconversations were exceedingly bright and comical; and there were\r\nbrilliant hits at existing circumstances, all a little in a socialistic\r\nspirit, which made Anna pause as she read. She really had not perceived\r\ntill she heard it in her own voice and with other ears how audacious it\r\nwas, especially for a school bazaar.\r\n\r\nDolores applauded with her whole heart, but owned that it might be\r\ntoo good for the Mouse-trap, it would be too like catching a monkey!\r\nGillian, more doubtfully, questioned whether it would "quite do"; and\r\nMysie, when she understood the allusions, thought it would not. Emma\r\nNorton was more decided, and it ended by deciding that the paper should\r\nbe read to the elders at Clipstone, and their decision taken before\r\nsending it to Uncle Lance.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the Muscipula party rose as they discussed the remaining\r\nMSS., but these were not of the highest order of merit; and Anna thought\r\nthat the really good would be sufficient; and all the Underwood kith and\r\nkin had sufficient knowledge of the Press through their connection with\r\nthe \'Pursuivant\' to be authorities on the subject.\r\n\r\n"Fergus has some splendid duplicate ammonites for me and bits of\r\ncrystal," said Mysie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do let Fergus alone," entreated Gillian. "He is almost a\r\npetrifaction already, and you know what depends on it."\r\n\r\n"My sister is coming next week for a few days," said Anna. "She is very\r\nclever, and may help us."\r\n\r\nEmilia was accordingly introduced to the Mice, but she was not very\r\ntolerant of them. Essay societies, she said, were out of date, and she\r\nthought the Rockquay young ladies a very country-town set.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know them, Emmie," said Anna. "Gillian and Dolores are very\r\nremarkable girls, only--"\r\n\r\n"Only they are kept down by their mothers, I suppose. Is that the\r\nreason they don\'t do anything but potter after essay societies and\r\nSunday-schools like our little girls at Vale Leston? Why, I asked\r\nGillian, as you call her, what they were doing about the Penitents\'\r\nHome, and she said her mother and Aunt Jane went to look after it, but\r\nnever talked about it."\r\n\r\n"You know they are all very young."\r\n\r\n"Young indeed! How is one ever to be of any use if mothers and people\r\nare always fussing about one\'s being young?"\r\n\r\n"One won\'t always be so--"\r\n\r\n"They would think so, like the woman of a hundred years old, who said\r\non her daughter\'s death at eighty, \'Ah, poor girl, I knew I never should\r\nrear her!\' How shall I get to see the Infirmary here?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Mohun would take you."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I go without a fidgety old maid after me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I wish you would do, Emmie. Write an account of one\r\nof your hospital visits, or of the match-girls, for the Mouse-trap. Do!\r\nYou know Gerald has written something for it."\r\n\r\n"He! Why he has too much sense to write for your voluntary schools. Or\r\nit would be too clever and incisive for you. Ah! I see it was so by your\r\nface! What did he send you? Have you got it still?"\r\n\r\n"We have really a parody of his which is going in--The Girton Girl.\r\nNow, Emmie, won\'t you? You have told me such funny things about your\r\nmatch-girls."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to let them be turned into ridicule by your prim,\r\ndecorous swells. Why, I unfortunately told Fernan Brown one story--about\r\ntheir mocking old Miss Bruce with putting on imitation spectacles--and\r\nit has served him for a cheval de bataille ever since! Oh, my dear Anna,\r\nhe gets more hateful than ever. I wish you would come back and divert\r\nhis attention."\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think we could change? You could go and let Marilda fuss with\r\nyou, now that Uncle Clem and Aunt Cherry are so well, and I could look\r\nafter Adrian, and go to the Infirmary, and the penitents, and all that\r\nthese people neglect; maybe I would write for the Mouse-trap, if Gerald\r\ndoes when he comes home."\r\n\r\nAnna did not like the proposal, but she pitied Emilia, and cared for her\r\nenough to carry the scheme to her aunt. But Geraldine shook her head.\r\nThe one thing she did not wish was to have Emmie riding, walking,\r\nsinging, and expanding into philanthropy with Gerald, and besides, she\r\nknew that Emilia would never have patience to read to her uncle, or help\r\nAdrian in his preparation.\r\n\r\n"Do you really wish this, my dear?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"N--no, not at all; but Emmie does. Could you not try her?"\r\n\r\n"Annie dear, if you wish to have a fortnight or more in town--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no, auntie, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"We could get on now without you. Or we would keep Emmie till the room\r\nis wanted; but I had far rather be alone than have the responsibility of\r\nEmmie."\r\n\r\n"No, no, indeed; I don\'t think Adrian would be good long with her. I had\r\nmuch rather stay--only Emmie did wish, and she hates the--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, you need not tell me; I only know that I cannot have her\r\nafter next week; the room will be wanted for Gerald."\r\n\r\n"She could sleep with me."\r\n\r\n"No, Annie, I must disappoint you. There is not room for her, and her\r\nflights when Gerald comes would never do for your uncle. You know it\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nAnna could not but own the wisdom of the decision, and Emmie, after\r\ngrumbling at Aunt Cherry, took herself off. She had visited the\r\nInfirmary and the Convalescent Home, and even persuaded Mrs. Hablot to\r\nshow her the Union Workhouse, but she never sent her contribution to the\r\nMouse-trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. -- OUT BEYOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Do the work that\'s nearest,\r\n     Though it\'s dull at whiles,\r\n     Helping, when we meet them,\r\n     Lame dogs over stiles.\r\n     See in every hedgerow\r\n     Marks of angels\' feet;\r\n     Epics in each pebble\r\n     Underneath our feet.--C. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Drawing? Well done, Cherie! That\'s a jolly little beggar; quite\r\nmasterly, as old Renville would say," exclaimed Gerald Underwood,\r\nlooking at a charming water-colour of a little fisher-boy, which Mrs.\r\nGrinstead was just completing.\r\n\r\n"\'The Faithful Henchman,\' it ought to be called," said Anna. "That\r\nlittle being has attached himself to Fergus Merrifield, and follows him\r\nand Adrian everywhere on what they are pleased to call their scientific\r\nexpeditions."\r\n\r\n"The science of larks?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no. Fergus is wild after fossils, and has made Adrian the\r\nsame, and he really knows an immense deal. They are always after fossils\r\nand stones when they are out of school."\r\n\r\n"The precious darling!"\r\n\r\n"Miss Mohun says Fergus is quite to be trusted not to take him into\r\ndangerous places."\r\n\r\n"An unlooked-for blessing. Ha!" as he turned over his aunt\'s portfolio,\r\n"that\'s a stunner! You should work it up for the Academy."\r\n\r\n"This kind of thing is better for the purpose," Mrs. Grinstead said.\r\n\r\n"Throw away such work upon a twopenny halfpenny bazaar! Heaven\r\nforefend!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be tiresome, Gerald," entreated Anna. "You are going to do all\r\nsorts of things for it, and we shall have no end of fun."\r\n\r\n"For the sake of stopping the course of the current," returned\r\nGerald, proceeding to demonstrate in true nineteenth-century style the\r\nhopelessness of subjecting education to what he was pleased to call\r\nclericalism. "You\'ll never reach the masses while you insist on using an\r\nApostle spoon."\r\n\r\n"Masses are made up of atoms," replied his aunt.\r\n\r\n"And we shall be lost if you don\'t help," added Anna.\r\n\r\n"I would help readily enough if it were free dinners, or anything to\r\nequalize the existence of the classes, instead of feeding the artificial\r\nwants of the one at the expense of the toil and wretchedness of the\r\nother."\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to mention some of the miseries that he had learnt through\r\nthe Oxford House--dilating on them with much enthusiasm--till presently\r\nhis uncle came in, and ere long a parlour-maid announced luncheon, just\r\nas there was a rush into the house. Adrian was caught by his sister,\r\nand submitted, without more than a "Bother!" to be made respectable, and\r\nonly communicating in spasmodic gasps facts about Merrifield and hockey.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Marshall?" asked Gerald at the first opportunity, on the maid\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\n"Marshall could not stand it," said his aunt. "He can\'t exist without\r\nLondon, and doing the honours of a studio."\r\n\r\n"Left you!"\r\n\r\n"Most politely he informed me that this place does not agree with his\r\nhealth; and there did not seem sufficient scope for his services since\r\nthe Reverend Underwood had become so much more independent. So we were\r\nthankful to dispose of him to Lord de Vigny."\r\n\r\n"He was a great plague," interpolated Adrian, "always jawing about the\r\nhall-door."\r\n\r\n"Are you really without a man-servant?" demanded Gerald.\r\n\r\n"In the house. Lomax comes up from the stables to take some of the work.\r\nSome lemonade, Gerald?"\r\n\r\nGerald gazed round in search of unutterable requirements; but only\r\nmet imploring eyes from aunt and sister, and restraining ones from his\r\nuncle. He subsided and submitted to the lemonade, while Anna diverted\r\nattention by recurring rather nervously to the former subject.\r\n\r\n"And I have got rid of Porter, she kept me in far too good order."\r\n\r\n"As if Sibby did not," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"Aye, and you too! But that comes naturally, and began in babyhood!"\r\n\r\n"What have you done with the house at Brompton?"\r\n\r\n"Martha is taking care of it--Mrs. Lightfoot, don\'t you know? One of our\r\nold interminable little Lightfoots, who went to be a printer in London,\r\nmarried, and lost his wife; then in our break-up actually married Martha\r\nto take care of his children! Now he is dead, and I am thankful to have\r\nher in the house."\r\n\r\n"To frighten loafers with her awful squint."\r\n\r\n"You forgive the rejection of \'The Inspector\'s Tour\'? Indeed I think you\r\nexpected it."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to see whether the young ladies would find it out."\r\n\r\n"No compliment to our genius," said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"I assure you, like Mrs. Bennet, \'there is plenty of that sort of\r\nthing,\'" said Anna. "Some of them were mystified, but Gillian and\r\nDolores Mohun were in ecstasies."\r\n\r\n"Ecstasies from that cheerful name?"\r\n\r\n"She is the New Zealand niece--Mr. Maurice Mohun\'s daughter. They\r\ncarried it home to their seniors, and of course the verdict was \'too\r\nstrong for Rockquay atmosphere,\'" said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"So it did not even go to Uncle Lance," said Anna. "Shall you try the\r\n\'Pursuivant\'?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I shall put in the pepper and salt I regretted, and\r\ntry the \'Censor\'."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" observed his uncle, in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Gerald coolly, "I have sent little things to the \'Censor\'\r\nbefore, which they seem to regard in the light of pickles and laver."\r\n\r\nThe \'Censor\' was an able paper on the side of philosophical politics,\r\nand success in that quarter was a feather in the young man\'s cap, though\r\nnot quite the kind of feather his elders might have desired.\r\n\r\n"Journalism is a kind of native air to us," said Mrs. Grinstead, "but\r\nfrom \'Pur.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Pur\' is the element of your dear old world, Cherie," said Gerald, "and\r\nhere am I come to do your bidding in its precincts, for a whole long\r\nvacation."\r\n\r\nHe spoke lightly, and with a pretty little graceful bow to his aunt, but\r\nthere was something in his eyes and smile that conveyed to her a dread\r\nthat he meant that he only resigned himself for the time and looked\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Lance is coming," volunteered Adrian.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Geraldine. "Chorister that he was, and champion of\r\nChurch teaching that he is, he makes the cause of Christian education\r\neverywhere his own, and is coming down to see what he can do\r\ninexpensively with native talent for concert, or masque, or\r\nsomething--\'Robin Hood\' perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Ending in character with a rush on the audience?" said Gerald.\r\n"Otherwise \'Robin Hood\' is stale."\r\n\r\n"Tennyson has spoilt that for public use," said Mrs. Grinstead. "But was\r\nnot something else in hand?"\r\n\r\n"Only rehearsed. It never came off," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"The most awful rot," said Adrian. "I would have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"In consequence it was a failure," laughed Gerald.\r\n\r\n"It was \'The Tempest\', wasn\'t it?" said Anna.\r\n\r\n"Not really!" exclaimed Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"About as like as a wren to an eagle," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"We had it at the festival last winter. The authors adapted the plot,\r\nthat was all."\r\n\r\n"The authors being--\r\n\r\n"The present company," said Gerald, "and Uncle Bill, with Uncle Lance\r\nsupplying or adapting music, for we were not original, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"It was when Uncle Clem was ill," put in Anna, "and somehow I don\'t\r\nthink we took in the accounts of it."\r\n\r\n"No," said Gerald, "and nobody did it con amore, though we could not put\r\nit off. I should like to see it better done."\r\n\r\n"Such rot!" exclaimed Adrian. "There\'s an old man, he was Uncle Lance\r\nwith the great white beard made out of Kit\'s white bear\'s skin, and he\r\nlived in a desert island, where there was a shipwreck--very jolly if you\r\ncould see it, only you can\'t--and the savages--no, the wreckers all came\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"What, in a desert island?"\r\n\r\n"It was not exactly desert. Gerald, I say, do let there be savages. It\r\nwould be such a lark to have them all black, and then I\'d act."\r\n\r\n"What an inducement!"\r\n\r\n"Then somebody turned out to be somebody\'s enemy, and the old chap\r\nfrightened them all with squibs and crackers and fog-horns, till\r\nsomebody turned out to be somebody else\'s son, and married the\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\n"If you trace \'The Tempest\' through that version you are clever," said\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\n"I told you it was awful rot," said Adrian.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Merrifield! Excuse me, Cherie." And off he went.\r\n\r\n"The sentiments of the actors somewhat resembled Adrian\'s. It was too\r\nnew, and needed more learning and more pains, so they beg to revert to\r\n\'Robin Hood\'. However, I should like to see it well got up for once,\r\nif only by amateurs. Miranda has a capital song by Uncle Bill, made for\r\nFrancie\'s soprano. She cuts you all out, Anna."\r\n\r\n"That she does, in looks and voice, but she could not act here in\r\npublic. However, we will lay it before the Mouse-trap. Was it printed?"\r\n\r\n"Lance had enough for the performers struck off. Francie could send some\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"After all," said Cherie, "the desert island full of savages and\r\nwreckers is not more remarkable than the \'still-vex\'d Bermoothes\'\r\ngetting between Argiers and Sicily."\r\n\r\n"It _really was_ one of the Outer Hebrides," said Gerald, with the\r\neagerness that belonged to authorship, "so that there could be any\r\namount of Scottish songs. Prospero is an old Highland chief, who has\r\nbeen set adrift with his daughter--Francie Vanderkist to wit--and\r\nfloated up there, obtaining control over the local elves and brownies.\r\nLittle Fely was a most dainty sprite."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you did not make Ariel an electric telegraph," said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"Tempting, but such profanity in the face of Vale Leston was forbidden,\r\nand so was the comic element, as bad for the teetotallers."\r\n\r\n"But who were the wreckers?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"Buccaneers, my dear, singing songs out of the \'Pirate\'--schoolmaster,\r\norganist, and choir generally. They had captured Prospero\'s supplanter\r\n(he was a Highland chief in league with the Whigs) by the leg, while the\r\nexiled fellow was Jacobite, so as to have the songs dear to the feminine\r\nmind. They get wrecked on the island, and are terrified by the elves\r\ninto releasing Alonso, etc. Meantime Ferdinand carries logs, forgathers\r\nwith Miranda and Prospero--and ends--" He flourished his hands.\r\n\r\n"And it wasn\'t acted!"\r\n\r\n"No, we were getting it up before Christmas," said Gerald, "and then--"\r\n\r\nHe looked towards Clement, whose illness had then been at the crisis.\r\n\r\n"Very inconsiderate of me," said Clement, smiling, "as the old woman\r\nsaid when her husband did not die before the funeral cakes were stale.\r\nBut could it not come off at the festival?"\r\n\r\n"Now," said Gerald, "that the boy is gone, I may be allowed a glass of\r\nbeer. Is that absurdity to last on here?"\r\n\r\n"Adrian\'s mother would not let him come on any other terms," said Mrs.\r\nGrinstead.\r\n\r\n"Did she also stipulate that he was never to see a horse? Quite as fatal\r\nto his father."\r\n\r\n"You need not point the unreason, but consider how she has suffered."\r\n\r\n"You go the way to make him indulge on the sly."\r\n\r\n"True, perhaps," said Clement, "but I mean to take the matter up when I\r\nknow the poor little fellow better."\r\n\r\nGerald gave a little shrug, a relic of his foreign ancestry, and Anna\r\nproposed a ride to Clipstone to tell Gillian Merrifield of the idea.\r\n\r\n"Eh, the dogmatic damsel that came with you the year we had \'Midsummer\r\nNight\'s Dream\'?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sister to Uncle Bernard\'s wife. Do you know Jasper Merrifield?\r\nClever man. Always photographing."\r\n\r\nSo off they went, Gerald apparently in a resigned state of mind, and\r\ncame upon dogs and girls in an old quarry, where Mysie had dragged them\r\nto look for pretty stones and young ferns to make little rockeries\r\nfor the sale of work. \'The Tempest\' was propounded, and received with\r\nacclamation, though the Merrifields declared that they could not sing,\r\nand their father would not allow them to do so in public if they could!\r\n\r\nDolores looked on in a sort of silent scorn at a young man who could\r\ntalk so eagerly about "a trumpery raree-show," especially for an object\r\nthat she did not care about. None of them knew how far it was the pride\r\nof authorship and the desire of pastime. Only Jasper said when he heard\r\ntheir report--\r\n\r\n"Underwood is a queer fellow! One never knows where to have him.\r\nSocialist one minute, old Tory the next."\r\n\r\n"A dreamer?" asked Dolores.\r\n\r\n"If you like to call him so. I believe he will dawdle and dream all his\r\nlife, and never do any good!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is waiting."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe in waiting," said Jasper, wiping the dust off his\r\nphotographic glasses. "Why, he has a lovely moor of his own, and does\r\nnot know how to use it!"\r\n\r\n"Conclusive," said Gillian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. -- NOBLESSE OBLIGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     The other won\'t agree thereto,\r\n       So here they fall to strife;\r\n     With one another they did fight\r\n       About the children\'s life.\r\n                             Babes in the Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I say, Aunt Cherry," said Adrian, "the fossil forest is to be uncovered\r\nto-morrow, and Merrifield is going to stay for it, and I\'m going down\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"Fossil forest? What, in the Museum?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. In Anscombe Cove, they call it. There\'s a forest buried\r\nthere, and bits come up sometimes. To-morrow there\'s to be a tremendous\r\nlow tide that will leave a lot of it uncovered, and Merrifield and I\r\nmean to dig it out, and if there are some duplicate bits they may be had\r\nfor the bazaar."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they have been begging Fergus\'s duplicates for a collection of\r\nfossils," said Anna. "But can it be safe? A low tide means a high tide,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!" returned Adrian.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mohun is sure to know all about the tides, I suppose," said\r\nClement; "if her nephew goes with her consent I suppose it is safe."\r\n\r\n"If--" said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\nAdrian looked contemptuous, and muttered something, on which Anna\r\nundertook to see Miss Mohun betimes, and judge how the land, or rather\r\nthe sea, lay, and whether Fergus was to be trusted.\r\n\r\nIt would be a Saturday, a whole holiday, on which he generally went home\r\nfor Sunday, and Adrian spent the day with him, but the boys\' present\r\nscheme was, to take their luncheon with them and spend the whole day in\r\nAnscombe Cove. This was on the further side of the bay from the marble\r\nworks, shut in by big cliffs, which ran out into long chains of rocks on\r\neither side, but retreated in the midst, where a little stream from the\r\nvillage of Anscombe, or rather from the moorland beyond, made its way to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe almanacks avouched that on this Saturday there would be an unusually\r\nlow tide, soon after twelve o\'clock, and Fergus had set his heart on\r\ninvestigating the buried forest that there was no doubt had been choked\r\nby the combined forces of river and sea. So Anna found that notice had\r\nbeen sent to Clipstone of his intention of devoting himself to the cove\r\nand not coming home till the evening, and that his uncle and aunt did\r\nnot think there was any danger, especially as his constant henchman,\r\nDavie Blake, was going with him, and all the fisher-boys of the place\r\nwere endowed with a certain instinct for their own tides. The only\r\naccident Jane Mohun had ever known was with a stranger.\r\n\r\nAnna had no choice but to subside, and the boys started as soon as the\r\nmorning\'s tide would have gone down sufficiently, carrying baskets for\r\ntheir treasures containing their luncheon, and apparently expecting\r\nto find the forest growing upright under the mud, like a wood full of\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nThe cove for which they were bound was on the further side of the chain\r\nof rocks, nearly two miles from Rockquay, and one of the roads ran along\r\nthe top of the red cliffs that shut it in, with no opening except where\r\nthe stream emerged, and even that a very scanty bank of shingle.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all assurances, Anna could not be easy about her darling,\r\nand when afternoon came, and the horses were brought to the door, she\r\ncoaxed Gerald into riding along the cliffs in the Anscombe direction,\r\nwhere there was a good road, from whence they could turn down a steep\r\nhill into the village, and thence go up a wild moor beyond, or else\r\ncontinue along the coast for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nAs they went out she could see nothing of the boys, only rocks rising\r\nthrough an expanse of mud, and the sea breaking beyond. She would have\r\npreferred continuing the cliff road, but Gerald had a turn for the moor,\r\nand carried her off through the village of Anscombe, up and up, till\r\nthey had had a lively canter on the moor, and looked far out at sea.\r\nWhen they turned back and had reached the cliff road, what had been\r\na sheet of mud before had been almost entirely covered with sparkling\r\nwaves, and there was white foam beating against some of the rocks.\r\n\r\n"I hope Adrian is gone home," sighed Anna.\r\n\r\n"Long ago, depend on it," returned Gerald carelessly; but the next\r\nmoment his tone changed. "By Jove!" he exclaimed, and pointed with his\r\nwhip to a rock, or island, at the end of the range of rocks.\r\n\r\nHe was much the more long-sighted of the two, and she could only first\r\ndiscern that there was something alive upon the rock.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she cried, "is it the boys--I can\'t see?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell. It is boys, maybe fishers. I must get out to them," he\r\nreplied. "Now, Anna, be quiet--use your senses. It is somebody, anyway.\r\nI saw the opening of a path down the rock just now," and he threw\r\nhimself off his horse, and threw her the bridle. "You ride to the first\r\nhouse; find where there is a Coast-guard station, or any fisherman to\r\nput out a boat. No time to be lost."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is it, is it--" cried the bewildered girl, with no hand to feel for\r\nher eyeglass. "Where shall I go?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you I can\'t tell," he shouted in answer to both questions, half\r\nangrily, already on his way. "Don\'t dawdle," and he disappeared.\r\n\r\nPoor Anna, she had no inclination to dawdle, but the two horses were\r\na sore impediment, and she went on some way without seeing any houses.\r\nShould she turn back to the little road leading down from Anscombe? but\r\nthat was rough and difficult, and could not be undertaken quickly with a\r\nled horse; or should she make the best of her way to the nearest villas,\r\noutskirts of Rockquay? However, after a moment the swish of bicycles\r\nwas heard, and up came two young men, clerks apparently, let loose by\r\nSaturday. They halted, and in answer to her agitated question where\r\nthere was a house, pointed to a path which they said led down to the\r\nPreventive station, and asked whether there had been an accident, and\r\nwhether they could be of use. They were more able to decide what was\r\nbest to be done than she could be, and they grew more keenly interested\r\nwhen they understood for whom she feared. Petros White, brother to Mrs.\r\nHenderson, and nephew to Aunt Adeline\'s husband, was one of them, the\r\nother, a youth also employed at the marble works. This latter took the\r\nhorses off her hands, while Petros showed her the way to the Coast-guard\r\nstation by a steep path, leading to a sort of ledge in the side of the\r\ncliff, scooped out partly by nature and partly by art, where stood the\r\nlittle houses covered with slate.\r\n\r\nThere the mistress was looking out anxiously with a glass; while below,\r\nthe Preventive man was unlocking the boat-house, having already observed\r\nthe peril of the boys, but lamenting the absence of his mate. Petros ran\r\ndown at speed to offer his help, and Anna could only borrow the glass,\r\nthrough which she plainly saw the three boys, bare-legged, sitting\r\nhuddled up on the top of the rock, but with the waves still a good way\r\nfrom them, and their faces all turned hopefully towards the promontory\r\nof rock along which she could see Gerald picking his way; but there was\r\nevidently a terrible and fast-diminishing space between its final point\r\nand the rock of refuge.\r\n\r\nAnna was about to rush down, and give her help with an oar; but the\r\nwoman withheld her, saying that she would only crowd the boat and retard\r\nthe rescue, for which the two were quite sufficient, only the danger was\r\nthat the current of the stream might make the tide rise rapidly in the\r\nbay. There were besides so many rocks and shoals, that it was impossible\r\nto proceed straight across, but it was needful absolutely to pass the\r\nrock and then turn back on it from the open sea. It was agonizing for\r\nthe sister to watch the devious course, and she turned the glass upon\r\nthe poor boys, plainly making out Adrian\'s scared, restless look, as he\r\nclung to the fisher-lad, and Fergus nursing his bag of specimens with\r\nhis knees drawn up. By and by Gerald was wading, and with difficulty\r\npreventing himself from being washed off the rocks. He paused, saw her,\r\nand waved encouragement. Then he plunged along, not off his feet, and\r\nreached the island where the boys were holding out their arms to him.\r\nThere ensued a few moments of apparently hot debate, and she saw, to her\r\nhorror and amazement, that he was thrusting back one boy, who struggled\r\nand almost fell off the rock in his passion, as Gerald lifted down the\r\nlittle fisher-boy. Of course she could not hear the words, "Come, boy.\r\nNo, Adrian. Noblesse oblige. I will come back, never fear. I can take\r\nbut one, don\'t I tell you. I will come back."\r\n\r\nThose were Gerald\'s words, while Adrian threw himself on the rock,\r\nsobbing and screaming, while Fergus sat still, hugging his bag. Anna\r\ncould have screamed with her brother, for the boat seemed to have\r\novershot the mark, and to be going quite aloof, when all depended upon\r\na few minutes. She could hardly hear the words of the Preventive woman,\r\nwho had found a second glass: "Never you fear, miss, the boat will be up\r\nin time."\r\n\r\nShe could not speak. Her heart was in wild rebellion as she thought of\r\nthe comparative value of her widowed mother\'s only son with that of the\r\nfisher-boy, or even of Fergus, one of so large a family. She could not\r\nor would not look to see what Gerald was doing with the wretched little\r\ncoast boy; but she heard her companion say that the gentleman had put\r\nthe boy down to scramble among the rocks, and he himself was going back\r\nto the pair on the rock, quite swimming now.\r\n\r\nShe durst look again, and saw that he had scrambled up to the boys\'\r\nperch, and had lifted Adrian up, but there was white spray dashing round\r\nnow. She could not see the boat.\r\n\r\n"They have to keep to the other side," explained the woman. "God keep\r\nthem! It will be a near shave. The gentleman is taking off his coat!"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a leap of foam--over! over! Then all was blotted out,\r\nbut the woman exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"There they are!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! where?"\r\n\r\n"One swimming! He is floating the other."\r\n\r\nAnna could see no longer. She dashed aside the telescope, then begged\r\nto be told, then looked again. No prayer would come but "Save him! save\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nThere was a call quite close.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Norris, sir, put off your boat! Master Fergus--Oh! is he off?" and,\r\ndrenched and breathless, Davy sank down on the ground at their feet,\r\nquite spent, unable at first to get out a word after those panting ones;\r\nbut in a minute he spoke in answer to the agonized "Which? Who?"\r\n\r\n"Master Fergus is swimming. The young sir couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nAnna recollected how her mother\'s fears and entreaties had prevented Mr.\r\nHarewood from teaching Adrian to swim.\r\n\r\n"Gent is floating him," added the boy. "He took me first, because I\r\ncould get over the rocks and get help soonest. He is a real gentleman,\r\nhe is."\r\n\r\nAnna could not listen to anything but "The boat is coming!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but they don\'t see! They are going away from it!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the current," said Mrs. Norris. "My man knows what he is about,\r\nand so does the gentleman, never fear."\r\n\r\nThere was another terrible interval, and then boat and swimmers began to\r\napproach, though in what condition could not be made out. A dark little\r\nhead, no doubt that of Fergus, was lifted in, then another figure was\r\nraised and taken into the boat; Gerald swam with a hand on it for a\r\nshort distance, then was helped in, and almost at once took an oar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Mrs. Norris. "It will keep out the cold."\r\n\r\n"They are not coming here," exclaimed Anna. "They are going round the\r\npoint."\r\n\r\n"All right," was the answer. "\'Tis more direct, you see, no shoals,\r\nand the young gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the\r\nquicker. Now, miss, you will come in and take a cup of tea, I am sure\r\nyou want it, and I had just made it when Norris saw the little lads."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, I must get back at once. My little brother--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, miss, but you\'ll be able to ride the faster for a bit of\r\nbread and cup of tea! You are all of a tremble."\r\n\r\nIt was true, and to pacify her, Mrs. Norris sent a child up to bid\r\nPetros have the horses ready, and Anna was persuaded to swallow a little\r\ntoo, which happily had cooled enough for her haste, but she hurried off,\r\nleaving Mrs. Norris to expend her hospitality on Davy, who endured\r\nhis drenching like a fish, and could hardly wait even to swallow thick\r\nbread-and-butter till he could rush off to hear of his dear Master\r\nFergus.\r\n\r\nThe horses were ready. Petros had been joined by other spectators,\r\nand was able to entrust the bicycles to one of them, while he himself\r\nundertook to lead Mr. Underwood\'s horse to the stable. Anna rode off at\r\nas much speed or more than was safe downhill among the stones. She had\r\nto cross the broad parade above the quay, and indeed she believed she\r\nhad come faster than the boat, which had to skirt round the side of the\r\npromontory between Anscombe Cove and Rockquay. In fact, when she came\r\nabove the town she could see a crowd on the quay and pier, all looking\r\nout to sea, and she now beheld two boats making for the harbour.\r\n\r\nThen she had to ride between walls and villas, and lost sight of all\r\ntill she emerged on the parade, and thought she saw Uncle Clement\'s hat\r\nabove the crowd as she looked over their heads.\r\n\r\nShe gave her horse to a bystander, who evidently knew her, for a murmur\r\nwent through the crowd of "Little chap\'s sister," and way was made\r\nfor her to get forward, while several rough voices said, "All right";\r\n"Coast-guard boat"; "Not this one."\r\n\r\nHer uncle and Miss Mohun wore standing together. General Mohun could be\r\nseen in the foremost boat, and they could hear him call out, with a wave\r\nof his arm--\r\n\r\n"All right! All safe!"\r\n\r\n"You hero! Where\'s Gerald?" Miss Mohun exclaimed, as Anna came up to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"There!" and she pointed to the Coast-guard boat. "We saw the boys from\r\nAnscombe Cliff, and he went out to them."\r\n\r\n"Gerald," exclaimed his uncle, with a ring of gladness in his voice,\r\nall the more that it was plain that the rower was indeed Gerald, and\r\nhe began to hail those on shore, while Fergus\'s head rose up from the\r\nbottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were close to the quay, and the little sodden mass\r\nthat purported to be Fergus was calling out--\r\n\r\n"Aunt Jane! Oh, I\'ve lost such a bit of aralia. Where\'s Davy?"\r\n\r\n"Here, take care. He is all right," were Gerald\'s words.\r\n\r\n_He_ meant Adrian, whom his cousin lifted out, with eyes open and\r\nconscious, but with limp hands and white exhausted looks, to be carried\r\nto the fly that stood in waiting.\r\n\r\n"Is the other boy safe?" asked Gerald anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; but how could you?" were the first words that came to Anna;\r\nbut she felt rebuked by a strange look of utter surprise, and instead of\r\nanswering her he replied to General Mohun--\r\n\r\n"Thanks, no, I\'ll walk up!" as a rough coat was thrown over his dripping\r\nand scanty garments.\r\n\r\n"The wisest way," said the General. "Can you, Fergus?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite well. Oh, my aralia!"\r\n\r\n"He has been half crying all the way home about his fossils," said\r\nGerald. "Never mind, Fergus; look out for the next spring-tide. Uncle\r\nClem, you ought to drive up."\r\n\r\nClement submitted, clearly unable to resist, and sat down by Anna,\r\nwho had her brother in her arms, rubbing his hands and warming them,\r\ncaressing him, and asking him how he felt, to which the only answer she\r\ngot was--\r\n\r\n"It was beastly. I have my mouth awfully full of water still."\r\n\r\nClement made a low murmur of thanksgiving, and Anna, looking up, was\r\nstartled to see how white and helpless he was. The way was happily very\r\nshort, but he had so nearly fainted that Gerald, hurrying on faster\r\nuphill than the horse to reassure his aunt, lifted him out, not far from\r\ninsensible, and carried him with Sibby\'s help to his bed in the room on\r\nthe ground-floor, where the remedies were close at hand, Geraldine and\r\nnurse anxiously administering them; when the first sign of revival he\r\ngave was pointing to Gerald\'s dripping condition, and signing to him to\r\ngo and take care of himself.\r\n\r\n"All right, yes, boys and all! All right Cherie."\r\n\r\nAnd he went, swallowing down the glass of stimulant which his aunt\r\nturned from her other patient for a moment to administer, but she was\r\nmuch too anxious about Clement to have thought for any one else, for\r\ntruly it did seem likely that he would be the chief sufferer from the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nLittle Davy\'s adventure, as he had lost no clothes, made no more\r\nimpression on his parents than if he had been an amphibious animal or\r\na water dog, and when Fergus came out of Beechwood Cottage after having\r\nchanged the few clothes he had retained, and had a good meal, to be\r\ndriven home with his uncle in the dog-cart, his constant henchman was\r\nfound watching for news of him at the gate.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, I think we\'ll find your aralia next spring-tide."\r\n\r\nWhereupon General Mohun told him he was a good little chap, and\r\npresented him with a half-crown, the largest sum he had ever possessed\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nFergus did not come off quite so well, for when the story had been told,\r\nthough his mother had trembled and shed tears of thankfulness as she\r\nkissed him, and his sisters sprang at him and devoured him, while all\r\nthe time he bemoaned his piece of the stump of an aralia, and a bit of\r\ncone of a pinus, and other treasures to which imaginative regret lent\r\nsuch an aid, that no doubt he would believe the lost contents of his bag\r\nto have been the most precious articles that he had ever collected; his\r\nfather, however, took him into his study.\r\n\r\n"Fergus," he said gravely, "this is the second time your ardour upon\r\nyour pursuits has caused danger and inconvenience to other people, this\r\ntime to yourself too."\r\n\r\nFergus hung his head, and faltered something about--"Never saw."\r\n\r\n"No, that is the point. Now I say nothing about your pursuits. I am very\r\nglad you should have them, and be an intelligent lad; but they must not\r\nbe taken up exclusively, so as to drive out all heed to anything else.\r\nRemember, there is a great difference between courage and foolhardiness,\r\nand that you are especially warned to be careful if your venturesomeness\r\nendangers other people\'s lives."\r\n\r\nSo Fergus went off under a sense of his father\'s displeasure, while\r\nAdrian lay in his bed, kicking about, admired and petted by his sister,\r\nwho thought every one very unkind and indifferent to him; and when\r\nhe went to sleep, began a letter to her eldest sister describing the\r\nadventure and his heroism in naming terms, such as on second thoughts\r\nshe suppressed, as likely to frighten her mother, and lead to his\r\nimmediate recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. -- HEROES AND HERO-WORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nothing of him that doth fade,\r\n     But doth suffer a sea-change\r\n     Into something rich and strange.--Tempest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday morning found Anna in a different frame of mind from that of the\r\nevening before. Uncle Clement had been very ill all night, and the\r\nhouse was to be kept as quiet as possible. When Anna came in from\r\nearly Celebration, Aunt Cherry came out looking like a ghost, and very\r\nanxious, and gave a sigh of relief on Adrian being reported still\r\nsound asleep. Gerald presently came down, pale and languid, but calling\r\nhimself all right, and loitering over his breakfast till after the boy\r\nappeared, so rosy and ravenous as to cause no apprehension, except that\r\nhe should devour too much apricot jam, and use his new boots too noisily\r\non the stairs.\r\n\r\nAnna devised walking him to Beechcroft to hear if there were any news\r\nof Fergus, and though he observed, with a certain sound of contemptuous\r\nrivalship, that there was no need, for "Merrifield was as right as a\r\ntrivet," he was glad enough to get out of doors a little sooner, and\r\nthough he affected to be bored by the kind inquiries of the people they\r\nmet, he carried his head all the higher for them.\r\n\r\nNobody was at home except General Mohun, but he verified Adrian\'s\r\nimpression of his nephew\'s soundness, whatever the mysterious comparison\r\nmight mean; and asked rather solicitously not only after Mr. Underwood\r\nbut after Gerald, who, he said, was a delicate subject to have made such\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\n"It really was very gallant and very sensible behaviour," he said, as\r\nhe took his hat to walk to St. Andrew\'s with the brother and sister,\r\nbut Anna was conscious of a little pouting in Adrian\'s expression, and\r\ndispleasure in his stumping steps.\r\n\r\nGerald came to church, but went to sleep in the sermon, and had\r\naltogether such a worn-out look that no one could help remembering that\r\nhe had never been very strong, and had gone through much exertion the\r\nday before, nor could he eat much of the mid-day meal. Mrs. Grinstead,\r\nwho was more at ease about her brother, looked anxiously at him, and\r\nwith a kind of smile the word "Apres" passed between them. The Sunday\r\ncustom was for Clement to take Adrian to say his Catechism, and have a\r\nlittle instruction before going out walking, but as this could not be on\r\nthis day, Anna and he were to go out for a longer walk than usual, so\r\nas to remove disturbance from the household. Gerald declined, of course,\r\nand was left extended on the sofa; but just as Anna and Adrian had made\r\na few steps along the street, and the boy had prevailed not to walk to\r\nClipstone, as she wished, but to go to the cliffs, that she might hear\r\nthe adventure related in sight of the scene of action, he discovered\r\nthat he had left a glove. He was very particular about Sunday walking\r\nin gloves in any public place, and rushed back to find it, leaving his\r\nsister waiting. Presently he came tearing back and laughing.\r\n\r\n"Did you find it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; it was in the drawing-room. And what else do you think I found?\r\nWhy, Cherie administering"--and he pointed down his throat, and made a\r\ngulp with a wild grimace of triumph. "On the sly! Ha! ha!"\r\n\r\nAnna felt as if the ground had opened under her feet, but she answered\r\ngravely--\r\n\r\n"Poor Gerald went through a great deal yesterday, and is quite knocked\r\nup, so no wonder he needs some strengthening medicine."\r\n\r\n"Strengthening grandmother! Don\'t you think I know better than that?" he\r\ncried, with a caper and a grin.\r\n\r\n"Of course you had to have some cordial when you were taken out of the\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you know what it was?"\r\n\r\n"I know the fisher-people carry stuff about with them in case of\r\naccidents."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way with girls--just to think one knows nothing at all."\r\n\r\n"What do you know, Adrian?"\r\n\r\n"Know? Why, I haven\'t been about with Kit and Ted Harewood for nothing!\r\nJolly good larks it is to see how all of you take for granted that a\r\nfellow never knew the taste of anything but tea and milk-and-water."\r\n\r\n"But what do you know the taste of?" she asked, with an earnestness\r\nthat provoked the boy to tease and put on a boasting manner, so that she\r\ncould not tell how much he was pretending for the sake of amazing and\r\ntormenting her, in which he certainly succeeded.\r\n\r\nHowever, his attention was diverted by coming round the corner to where\r\nthere was a view of Anscombe Bay, when he immediately began to fight his\r\nbattles o\'er again, and show where they had been groping in the mud and\r\nseaweed in pursuit of sea-urchins, and stranded star-fish, and crabs.\r\n\r\n"And it wasn\'t a forest after all, it was just a sell--nothing but mud\r\nand weed, only Fergus would go and poke in it, and there were horrid\r\ngreat rough stones and rocks too, and I tumbled over one."\r\n\r\nAnna here became conscious that the whole place was the resort of the\r\nafternoon promenaders of Rockquay, great and small, of all ranks and\r\ndegrees, belonging to the "middle class" or below it, and that they\r\nmight themselves become the object of attention; and she begged\r\nher brother to turn back and wait till they could have the place to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"These are a disgusting lot of cads," he agreed, "but there won\'t be\r\nsuch a jolly tide another time. I declare I see the very rock where I\r\nsaw the sea-mouse--out there! red and shiny at the top."\r\n\r\nHere a well-dressed man, who had just come up the Coast-guard path, put\r\naside his pipe, and taking off his hat, deferentially asked--\r\n\r\n"Have I the honour of addressing Sir Adrian Vanderkist?"\r\n\r\nAdrian replied with a gracious nod and gesture towards his straw hat,\r\nand in another moment Anna found him answering questions, and giving his\r\nown account of the adventure to the inquirer, who, she had little\r\ndoubt, was a reporter, and carrying his head, if possible, higher in\r\nconsequence as he told how Fergus Merrifield had lingered over his\r\nstones, and all the rest after his own version. She did not hear the\r\nwhole, having had to answer the inquiries of one of the bicycle friends\r\nof the previous day, but when her attention was free she heard--\r\n\r\n"And the young lady, Sir Adrian?"\r\n\r\n"Young lady! Thank goodness, we were not bothered with any of that\r\nsort."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Sir Adrian, I understood that there was a young lady, Miss\r\nAurelia, that Master Merrifield was lamenting, as if she had met with a\r\nwatery grave."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! Aralia was only the name of a bit of fossil kind of a stick\r\nthat Merrifield had us down there to find in the fossil forest. I\'m sure\r\nI saw no forest, only bits of mud and stuff! But he found a bit, sure\r\nenough, and was ready to break his heart when he had to leave his bag\r\nbehind him on the rock. Aralia a young lady! That\'s a good one."\r\n\r\nHe forgathered with a school-fellow on the way home, and Anna heard\r\nlittle more.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, there arrived the daily local paper, addressed\r\nto Sir Adrian Vanderkist, Bart., and it was opened by him at\r\nbreakfast-time.\r\n\r\n"I say! Look here! \'Dangerous Accident in Anscombe. A Youthful Baronet\r\nin peril!\' What asses people are!" he added, with an odd access of the\r\ngratified shame of seeing himself for the first time in print. But he\r\ndid not proceed to read aloud; there evidently was something he did\r\nnot like, and he was very near pocketing it and rushing off headlong to\r\nschool with it, if his aunt and Anna had not entreated or commanded for\r\nit, when he threw it over with an uncomplimentary epithet.\r\n\r\n"Just what I was afraid of when I saw the man talking to him!" exclaimed\r\nAnna. "Oh, listen!\r\n\r\n"\'The young Sir Adrian Vanderkist, at present residing at St. Andrew\'s\r\nRock with his aunt, Mrs. Grinstead, and the Rev. E. C. Underwood, and\r\nwho is a pupil at Mrs. Edgar\'s academy for young gentlemen, was, we are\r\ninformed, involved in the most imminent danger, together with a son\r\nof General Sir Jasper Merrifield, K.G.C., a young gentleman whose\r\nremarkable scientific talent and taste appear to have occasioned the\r\nperil of the youthful party, from whence they were rescued by Gerald F.\r\nUnderwood, Esq., of Vale Leston.\'"\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that?" said Gerald F. Underwood, Esquire, sauntering in and\r\nkissing his aunt. "Good-morning. How is Uncle Clement this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Much better; I think he will be up by and by," answered Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"What bosh have you got there? The reporters seized on their prey, eh?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s Sir Jasper!" exclaimed Anna, who could see through the blinds\r\nfrom where she sat.\r\n\r\nSir Jasper had driven over with his little son, and, after leaving him\r\nat school, had come to inquire for Mr. Underwood, and to obtain a fuller\r\naccount of the accident, having already picked up a paper and glanced at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid my little scamp led them into the danger," he said.\r\n"Scientific taste forsooth! Science is as good a reason as anything else\r\nfor getting into scrapes."\r\n\r\n"Really," said Gerald, "I can\'t say I think your boy came out the worst\r\nin it, though I must own the Rockquay Advertiser bestows most of the\r\nhonours of the affair on the youthful baronet! You say he blew his own\r\ntrumpet," added Gerald, turning to Anna.\r\n\r\n"The reporter came and beset us," said Anna, in a displeased voice. "I\r\ndid not hear all that passed, but of course Adrian told him what he told\r\nme, only those people make things sound ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"To begin with," said Gerald, "I don\'t think Fergus, or at any rate\r\nDavy Blake, was in fault. They tried to go home in good time, having\r\nan instinct for tides, but Adrian was chasing a sea-mouse or some such\r\ngame, and could not be brought back, and then he fell over a slippery\r\nrock, and had to be dragged out of a hole, and by that time the channel\r\nof the Anscombe stream was too deep, at least for him, who has been only\r\ntoo carefully guarded from being amphibious."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that did not transpire at home," said Sir Jasper. "Boys are so\r\nreserved."\r\n\r\nMrs. Grinstead and Anna looked rather surprised. Anna even ventured--\r\n\r\n"I thought Fergus got too absorbed."\r\n\r\n"So did I," said his father dryly. "And he did not justify himself."\r\n\r\n"M--m--m," went on Gerald, skimming the article.\r\n\r\n"Read it," cried Anna. "You know none of us have seen it."\r\n\r\nGerald continued--\r\n\r\n"\'Their perilous position having been observed from Anscombe cliffs, Mr.\r\nG. F. Underwood of Vale Leston heroically\' (i.e. humbugically) \'made\r\nhis way out to their assistance, while a boat was put off by the\r\nCoast-guard, and that of Mr. Carter, fisherman, from Rockquay was\r\nlaunched somewhat later.\' We could not see either of them, you know. My\r\neye, this is coming it strong! \'The young baronet generously insisted\r\nthat the little fisher-boy, David Blake, who had accompanied them,\r\nshould first be placed in safety--\'"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he?" exclaimed Anna. "I saw, and I wondered, but I thought it\r\nwas his doing."\r\n\r\n"You saw?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the Coast-guard\'s telescope."\r\n\r\n"Oh! That is a new feature in the case!"\r\n\r\n"Then he did not insist?" said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"It was with the wrong side of his mouth."\r\n\r\n"But why did you send the fisher-boy first, when after all his life was\r\nless important?" exclaimed Anna, breaking forth at last.\r\n\r\n"First, for the reason that I strove to impress on \'the youthful\r\nbaronet,\' Noblesse oblige. Secondly, that Davy knew how to make his way\r\nalong the rocks, and also knew where to find the Preventive station. I\r\ncould leave him to get on, as I could not have done with the precious\r\nAdrian, and that gave a much better chance for us all. It was swimming\r\nwork by the time I got back, and by that time I thought the best\r\nalternative for any of us was to keep hold as long as we could, and then\r\nkeep afloat as best we might till we were picked up. Your boy was the\r\nhero of it all. Adrian was so angry with me for my disrespect that I\r\ncould hardly have got him to listen to me if Fergus had not made him\r\nunderstand, that to let himself be passive and be floated by me till the\r\nboats came up was the only thing to be done. There was one howl when he\r\nhad to let go his beloved aralia, but he showed his soldier blood, and\r\nbehaved most manfully."\r\n\r\n"I am most thankful to hear it," said his father, "and especially\r\nthankful to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! there was not much real danger," said Gerald lightly, "to any one\r\nwho could swim."\r\n\r\n"But Adrian could not," said Anna. "Oh! Gerald, what do we not owe to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I must be off," said Sir Jasper; "I must see about a new jacket for my\r\nboy. By the bye, do you know how the little Davy fared in the matter of\r\nclothes?"\r\n\r\n"Better than any of us," said Gerald. "He was far too sharp to go\r\nmud-larking in anything that would be damaged, and had his boots safe\r\nlaid up in a corner. I wish mine were equally safe."\r\n\r\nSir Jasper\'s purchases were not confined to boots and jacket, but as\r\ncompensation for his hard words included a certain cabinet full of\r\ndrawers that had long been Fergus\'s cynosure.\r\n\r\nAnna and her aunt were much concerned at what was said of Adrian, and\r\nstill more at the boastful account that he seemed to have given; but\r\nthen something, as Mrs. Grinstead observed, must be allowed for the\r\nreporter\'s satisfaction in having interviewed a live baronet. Each of\r\nthe parties concerned had one hero, and if the Merrifields\' was Fergus,\r\nto their own great surprise and satisfaction, Aunt Cherry was very happy\r\nover her own especial boy, Gerald, and certainly it was an easier task\r\nthan to accept "the youthful baronet" at his own valuation or that of\r\nthe reporter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grinstead considered whether to try to make him less conceited\r\nabout it, and show him his want of truth. She consulted his uncle about\r\nit, showing the newspaper, and telling, and causing Gerald to tell, the\r\nhistory of the accident, which Clement had not been fit to hear all the\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nHe was still in bed, but quite ready to attend to anything, and he\r\nlaughed over the account, which she illustrated by the discoveries she\r\nhad made from the united witnesses.\r\n\r\n"And is it not delightful to see for once what Gerald really is?" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he seems to have behaved gallantly," said his uncle; "and I won\'t\r\nsay just what might have been expected."\r\n\r\n"One does expect something of an Underwood," she said.\r\n\r\n"Little Merrifield too, who saw the danger coming, deserves more honour\r\nthan he seems to have taken to himself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he accepted severity from that stern father of his, who seems very\r\nsorry for it now. It is curious how those boys\' blood comes out in the\r\nmatter--chasser de race."\r\n\r\n"You must allow something for breeding. Fergus had not been the idol of\r\na mother and sisters, and Gerald remembered his father in danger."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can never be glad enough that he has that remembrance of him! How\r\nlike him he grows! That unconscious imitation is so curious."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the other day, when I had been dozing, I caught myself calling out\r\nthat he was whistling \'Johnny Cope\' so loud that he would be heard in\r\nthe shop."\r\n\r\n"He seems to be settling down more happily here than I expected. I\r\nsometimes wonder if there is any attraction at Clipstone."\r\n\r\n"No harm if there were, except--"\r\n\r\n"Except what? Early marriage might be the very best thing."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, though sometimes I doubt whether it is well for a man to have\r\ngone through the chief hopes and crises of life so soon. He looks out\r\nfor fresh excitement."\r\n\r\n"There are so many stages in life," said Geraldine, sighing. "And with\r\nall his likenesses, Gerald is quite different from any of you."\r\n\r\n"So I suppose each generation feels with those who succeed it. Nor do\r\nI feel as if I understood the Universities to-day as I did Cambridge\r\nthought of old. We can do nothing but wait and pray, and put out a hand\r\nwhere we see cause."\r\n\r\n"Where we see! It is the not seeing that is so trying. The being sure\r\nthat there is more going on within than is allowed to meet one\'s eye,\r\nand that one is only patronized as an old grandmother--quite out of it."\r\n\r\n"I think the conditions of life and thought are less simple than in our\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"And to come to the present. What is to be done about Adrian--the one\r\nwho was not a hero, though he made himself out so?"\r\n\r\n"Probably he really thought so. He is a mere child, you know, and it was\r\nhis first adventure, before he has outgrown the days of cowardice."\r\n\r\n"He need not have told stories."\r\n\r\n"Depend upon it, he hardly knew that he did so."\r\n\r\n"He had the reporter to help him certainly, and the \'Rockquay\r\nAdvertiser\' may not keep to the stern veracity and simplicity of the\r\n\'Pursuivant\'."\r\n\r\n"And was proud to interview a live baronet."\r\n\r\n"Then what shall we do--Anna and I, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Write the simple facts to Vale Leston, and then let it alone."\r\n\r\n"To him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. He would think your speaking mere nagging. Preserve an\r\nominous silence if he speaks. His school-fellows will be his best cure."\r\n\r\n"Well, he did seem ashamed!"\r\n\r\nClement was right. The boy\'s only mention of the paragraph was once as\r\n"that beastly thing"; and Anna discovered from Valetta Merrifield, that\r\nwhatever satisfaction he might have derived from it had been effectually\r\ndriven out of him by the "fellows" at Mrs. Edgar\'s, who had beset him\r\nwith all their force of derision, called him nothing but the "youthful\r\nBart.," and made him ashamed as none of the opposite sex or of maturer\r\nyears could ever have succeeded in doing. Valetta said Fergus had tried\r\nto stop it, but there had certainly been one effect, namely, that Adrian\r\nwas less disposed to be "Merry\'s" shadow than heretofore, and seemed\r\ninclined instead to take up with the other seniors.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, was certain. Gerald enjoyed a good deal more\r\nconsideration among the Clipstone damsels than before. True, as Jasper\r\nsaid, it was only what any one would have done; but he had done it, and\r\nproved himself by no means inferior to "any one," and Fergus regarded\r\nhim as a true hero, which had a considerable effect on his sisters, the\r\nmore perhaps because Jasper derided their admiration.\r\n\r\nThey were doubly bent on securing him for a contributor to the\r\nMouse-trap. They almost thought of inviting him to their Browning\r\nafternoons, but decided that he would not appreciate the feminine\r\ncompany, though he did so often have a number of the \'Censor\' to discuss\r\nit with Dolores, whenever they met him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. -- THE LITTLE BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,\r\n   history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral.\r\n   --Hamlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Matrons, otherwise denominated lady patronesses, met in committee,\r\nMiss Mohun being of course the soul and spirit of all, though Mrs.\r\nEllesmere, as the wife of the rector of old Rockstone Church, was the\r\npresident, Lady Flight, one of the most interested, was there, also\r\nLady Merrifield, dragged in to secure that there was nothing decided on\r\ncontrary to old-world instincts, Mrs. Grinstead, in right of the musical\r\nelement that her brother promised, the beautiful Mrs. Henderson, to\r\nrepresent the marble works, Mrs. Simmonds of the Cliff Hotel, the\r\nMayoress, and other notables.\r\n\r\nThe time was fixed for the first week in August, the only one when\r\nengagements would permit the Rotherwood family to be present for the\r\nopening, and when the regatta was apt to fill Rockquay with visitors.\r\nThe place was to be the top of the cliffs of Rockstone, where the\r\ngardens of the Cliff Hotel, of Beechcroft Cottage, Rocca Marina, and\r\nCarrara, belonging respectively to Miss Mohun, Mr. White, and Captain\r\nHenderson, lay close together separated by low walls, and each with a\r\nprivate door opening on a path along the top of the cliffs. They\r\ncould easily be made to communicate together, by planks laid over the\r\nboundaries, and they had lawns adapted for tents, etc., and Rocca\r\nMarina rejoiced in a shrubbery and conservatories that were a show\r\nin themselves, and would be kindly lent by Mr. and Mrs. White, though\r\nhealth compelled them to be absent and to resort to Gastein. The hotel\r\nlikewise had a large well-kept garden, where what Mrs. Simmonds called\r\na pavilion, "quite mediaeval," was in course of erection, and could be\r\nthrown open on the great day.\r\n\r\nIt was rather "tea-gardenish," but it could be made available for the\r\nrepresentation of The Outlaw\'s Isle. Lancelot made a hurried visit\r\nto study the place, and review the forces, and decided that it was\r\npracticable. There could be a gallery at one end for the spectators,\r\nand the outer end toward the bay could be transformed into a stage, with\r\nroom for the orchestra, and if the weather were favourable the real sea\r\ncould be shown in the background. The scenes had been painted by the\r\nclever fingers at Vale Leston. It remained to cast the parts. Lancelot\r\nhimself would be Prospero, otherwise Alaster Maclan, and likewise\r\nconductor, bringing with him the school-master of Vale Leston, who could\r\nsupply his part as conductor when he was on the stage. His little\r\nboy Felix would be Ariel, the other elves could be selected from the\r\nschool-children, and the local Choral Society would supply the wreckers\r\nand the wrecked. But the demur was over Briggs, a retired purser, who\r\nhad always had a monopoly of sea-songs, and who looked on the boatswain\r\nas his right, and was likely to roar every one down. Ferdinand would\r\nbe Gerald, under the name of Angus, but the difficulty was his\r\nMiranda--Mona as she was called. The Vanderkists could not be asked to\r\nperform in public, nor would Sir Jasper Merrifield have consented to\r\nhis daughters doing so, even if they could have sung, and it had been\r\nprivately agreed that none of the other young ladies of Rockquay could\r\nbe brought forward, especially as there was no other grown-up female\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n"My wife might undertake it," said Lancelot, "but her voice is not her\r\nstrong point, and she would be rather substantial for a Miranda."\r\n\r\n"It would be rather like finding a mother instead of a wife--with all\r\nrespect to my Aunt Daisy," laughed Gerald.\r\n\r\n"By the bye, I\'m sure I once heard a voice, somewhere down by the sea,\r\nthat would be perfect," exclaimed Lance. "Sweet and powerful, fresh and\r\nyoung, just what is essential. I heard it when I was in quest of crabs\r\nwith my boy."\r\n\r\n"I know!" exclaimed Gerald, "the Little Butterfly, as they call her!"\r\n\r\n"At a cigar-shop," said Lance.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Schnetterling\'s. Not very respectable," put in Lady Flight.\r\n\r\n"Decidedly attractive to the little boys, though," said Gerald. "Sweets,\r\nfishing-tackle, foreign stamps, cigars. I went in once to see whether\r\nAdrian was up to mischief there, and the Mother Butterfly looked at me\r\nas if I had seven heads; but I just got a glimpse of the girl, and, as\r\nmy uncle says, she would make an ideal Mona, or Miranda."\r\n\r\n"Lydia Schnetterling," exclaimed Mr. Flight. "She is a very pretty girl\r\nwith a nice voice. You remember her, Miss Mohun, at our concerts? A\r\nlovely fairy."\r\n\r\n"I remember her well. I thought she was foreign, and a Roman Catholic."\r\n\r\n"So her mother professes--a Hungarian. The school officer sent her to\r\nschool, and she did very well there, Sunday-school and all, and was a\r\nmonitor. She was even confirmed. Her name is really Ludmilla, and Lida\r\nis the correct contraction. But when I wanted her to be apprenticed as\r\na pupil-teacher, the mother suddenly objected that she is a Roman\r\nCatholic, but I very much doubt the woman\'s having any religion at all.\r\nI wrote to the priest about her, but I believe he could make nothing\r\nof her. Still, Lydia is a very nice girl--comes to church, and has not\r\ngiven up the Choral Society."\r\n\r\n"She is a remarkably nice good girl," added Mrs. Henderson. "She came\r\nto me, and entreated that I would speak for her to be taken on at the\r\nmarble works."\r\n\r\n"You have her there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I am much afraid that her talents do not lie in the way of\r\nhigh promotion, and I think if she does not get wages enough to satisfy\r\nher mother, she is in dread of being made to sing at public-houses and\r\nmusic-halls."\r\n\r\n"That nice refined girl!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am sure the idea is dreadful to her."\r\n\r\n"Could you not put her in the way of getting trained?" asked Gerald of\r\nhis uncle.\r\n\r\n"I must hear her first."\r\n\r\n"I will bring her up to the Choral Society tonight," said Mr. Flight.\r\n\r\n"What did you call her?" said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Some German or foreign name, Schnetterling, and the school calls her\r\nLydia."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the council was invaded, as it sat in Miss Mohun\'s\r\ndrawing-room, upon rugs and wicker chairs, to be refreshed with tea. In\r\nburst a whole army of Merrifields, headed by little Primrose, now a tall\r\ngirl of twelve years old, more the pet of the family than any of her\r\nelders had been allowed to be. Her cry was--\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, mamma, here\'s the very one for the captain of the\r\nbuccaneers!"\r\n\r\nThe startling announcement was followed by the appearance of a tall,\r\nstalwart, handsome young man of a certain naval aspect, whom Lady\r\nMerrifield introduced as Captain Armytage.\r\n\r\n"We must congratulate him, Gillian," she said. "I see you are gazetted\r\nas commander."\r\n\r\nPrimrose, who had something of the licence of the youngest, observed--\r\n\r\n"We have been telling him all about it. He used to be Oliver Cromwell in\r\n\'How Do You Like It?\' and now he will be a buccaneer!"\r\n\r\n"Oliver Cromwell, you silly child!" burst out Gillian, with a little\r\nshake, while the rest fell into fits of laughing.\r\n\r\n"I fear it was a less distinguished part," said Captain Armytage.\r\n\r\n"May I understand that you will help us?" said Lancelot. "I heard of you\r\nat Devereux Castle."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you heard much of my capabilities, especially musical\r\nones. I was the stick of the party," said Captain Armytage.\r\n\r\nIt was explained that Captain Armytage had actually arrived that\r\nafternoon at the Cliff Hotel, and had walked over to call at Clipstone,\r\nwhence he found the young ladies setting out to walk to Rockstone.\r\nHe could not deny that he had acted and sung, though, as he said,\r\nhis performance in both cases was vile. Little Miss Primrose had most\r\ncomically taken upon her to patronize him, and to offer him as buccaneer\r\ncaptain had been a freak of her own, hardly to be accounted for, except\r\nthat Purser Briggs\'s unsuitableness had been discussed in her presence.\r\n\r\n"Primrose is getting to be a horrid little forward thing," observed\r\nGillian to her aunt.\r\n\r\n"A child of the present," said Miss Mohun. "Infant England! But her\r\nsuggestion seems to be highly opportune."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe he can sing," growled Gillian, "and it will be just an\r\nexcuse for his hanging about here."\r\n\r\nThere was something in Gillian\'s "savagery" which gave Aunt Jane a\r\ncurious impression, but she kept it to herself.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening Lance appeared in his sister\'s drawing-room with--\r\n\r\n"I have more hopes of it. I did not think it was feasible when Anna\r\nwrote to me, but I see my way better now. That parson, Flight, has a\r\ngood notion of drilling, and that recruit of the little Merrifield girl,\r\nCaptain Armytage, is worth having."\r\n\r\n"If he roared like a sucking dove we would have him, only to silence\r\nthat awful boatswain," said Gerald; "and as to the little Cigaretta, she\r\nis a born prima donna."\r\n\r\n"Your Miranda? Are you content with her?" said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"She is to the manner born. Lovely voice, acts like a dragon, and has an\r\ninstinct how to stand and how to hold her hands."\r\n\r\n"Coming in drolly with her prim dress and bearing. Though she was\r\ndreadfully frightened," said Lance. "Being half-foreign accounts for\r\nsomething, I suppose, but it is odd how she reminds me of some one.\r\nNo doubt it is of some singer at a concert. What did they say was her\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"Ludmilla Schnetterling, the Little Butterfly they call her. Foreign\r\non both sides apparently," said Gerald. "Those dainty ankles never were\r\nbred on English clods."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what her mother is," said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"By the bye, I think it must have been her mother that I saw that\r\nmorning when little Felix dragged me to a cigar-shop in quest of an\r\nornamental crab--a handsome, slatternly hag sort of woman, who might\r\nhave been on the stage," said Lance.\r\n\r\n"Sells fishing-tackle, twine, all sorts," came from Adrian.\r\n\r\n"Have you been there?" asked his sister, rather disturbed.\r\n\r\n"Of course! All the fellows go! It is the jolliest place for"--he paused\r\na moment--"candies and ginger-beer."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought there were nicer places!" sighed Anna.\r\n\r\n"You have yet to learn that there is a period of life when it is a joy\r\nto slip out of as much civilization as possible," said Lance, putting\r\nhis sentence in involved form so as to be the less understood by the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n"Did you say that Flight had got hold of them?" asked Clement.\r\n\r\n"Hardly. They are R.C.\'s, it seems; and as to the Mother Butterfly,\r\nI should think there was not much to get hold of in her; but Mrs.\r\nHenderson takes interest in her marble-workers, and the girl is the sort\r\nof refined, impressible creature that one longs to save, if possible.\r\nTo-morrow I am going to put you all through your parts, Master Gerald,\r\nso don\'t you be out of the way."\r\n\r\n"One submits to one\'s fate," said Gerald, "hoping that virtue may be its\r\nown reward, as it is in the matter of \'The Inspector\'s Tour\', which\r\nthe \'Censor\' accepts, really enthusiastically for a paper, though the\r\nMouse-trap would have found it--what shall I say?--a weasel in their\r\nsnare."\r\n\r\n"Does it indeed?" cried Anna, delighted. "I saw there was a letter by\r\nthis last post."\r\n\r\n"Aye--invites more from the same pen," he replied lazily.\r\n\r\n"Too much of weasel for the \'Pursuivant\' even?" said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lance; "these young things are apt to tear our old traps and\r\nflags to pieces. By the bye, who is this Captain Armytage, who happily\r\nwill limit Purser Briggs to \'We split, we split, we split,\' or something\r\nanalogous?"\r\n\r\n"I believe," said Gerald, "that he joined the Wills-of-the-Wisp, that\r\ncompany which was got up by Sir Lewis Willingham, and played at Devereux\r\nCastle a year or two ago. Some one told me they were wonderfully\r\neffective for amateurs."\r\n\r\n"That explains the acquaintance with Lady Merrifield," said Mrs.\r\nGrinstead.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Anna. "Mysie told me all about it; and how Mr. David\r\nMerrifield married the nicest of them all, and how much they liked this\r\nCaptain Armytage."\r\n\r\n"Was not Mysie there when he arrived?"\r\n\r\n"No, she was gone to see the Henderson children, but Gillian looked a\r\nwhole sheaf of daggers at him. You know what black brows Gillian has,\r\nand she drew them down like thunder," and Anna imitated as well as her\r\nfair open brows would permit, "turning as red as fire all the time."\r\n\r\n"That certainly means something," said Geraldine, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see Gillian in love," laughed Anna; "and I really\r\nthink she is afraid of it, she looked so fierce."\r\n\r\nThe next evening there was time for a grand review in the parish\r\nschool-room of all possible performers on the spot. In the midst,\r\nhowever, a sudden fancy flashed across Lancelot that there was something\r\ncuriously similar between those two young people who occupied the\r\nstage, or what was meant to be such. Their gestures corresponded to one\r\nanother, their voices had the same ring, and their eyes wore almost of\r\nthe same dark colour. Now Gerald\'s eyes had always been the only part of\r\nhim that was not Underwood, and had never quite accorded with his fair\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n"Hungarian, I suppose," said Lance to himself, but he was not quite\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nWhat struck him as strange was that though dreadfully shy and frightened\r\nwhen off the stage, as soon as she appeared upon it, though not yet in\r\ncostume, she seemed to lose all consciousness that she was not Mona.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Henderson could have told him. Her husband being manager\r\nand partner at Mr. White\'s marble works, she had always taken great\r\ninterest in the young women employed, had actually attended to their\r\ninstruction, assisted in judging of their designs, and used these\r\nbusiness relations to bring them into inner contact with her, so that\r\nher influence had become very valuable. She was at the little room which\r\nshe still kept at the office, when there was a knock at the door, and\r\n"Miss Schnetterling" begged to speak to her. She felt particularly\r\ntender towards the girl, who was evidently doing her best in a trying\r\nand dangerous position, and after the first words it came out--\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Henderson, do you think I must be Mona?"\r\n\r\n"Have you any real objection, Lydia? Mr. Flight and all of them seem to\r\nwish it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I can\'t bear not to oblige Mr. Flight, who has been so good,\r\nso good!" cried Lydia, with a foreign gesture, clasping her hands.\r\n"Indeed, perhaps my mother would not let me off. That is what frightens\r\nme. But if you or some real lady could put me aside they could not\r\nobject."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you, my dear. You would meet with no unpleasantness\r\nfrom any one concerned, and you can be with the fairy children. Are you\r\nshy? You were not so in the fairy scenes last winter--you acted very\r\nnicely."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I liked it then. It carries me away; but--oh! I am afraid!"\r\n\r\n"Please tell me, my dear."\r\n\r\nLydia lowered her voice.\r\n\r\n"I must tell you, Mrs. Henderson, mother was a singer in public once,\r\nand a dancer; and oh! they were so cruel to her, beat her, and starved\r\nher, and ill-used her. She used to tell me about it when I was very\r\nlittle, but now I have grown older, and the people like my voice, she\r\nis quite changed. She wants me to go and sing at the Herring-and-a-Half,\r\nbut I won\'t, I won\'t--among all the tipsy men. That was why she would\r\nnot let me be a pupil-teacher, and why she will not see a priest. And\r\nnow--now I am sure she has a plan in her head. If I do well at this\r\noperetta, and people like me, I am sure she will get the man at the\r\ncircus to take me, by force perhaps, and then it would be all her life\r\nover again, and I know that was terrible."\r\n\r\nPoor Ludmilla burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Nay, if she suffered so much she would not wish to expose you to the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. She is in trouble about the shop--the cigars. Oh! I\r\nshould not have told! You won\'t--you won\'t--Mrs. Henderson?"\r\n\r\n"No, you need not fear, I have nothing to do with that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think," Lydia whispered again, "that she cares for me as she\r\nused to do when I was a little thing. Now that I care for my duty, and\r\nall that you and Mr. Flight have taught me, she is angry, and laughs\r\nat English notions. I was in hopes when I came to work here that my\r\nearnings would have satisfied her, but they don\'t, and I don\'t seem to\r\nget on."\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson could not say that her success was great, but she\r\nventured as much as to tell her that Captain Henderson could prevent any\r\nattempt to send her away without her consent.\r\n\r\n"Oh! but if my mother went too you could not hinder it."\r\n\r\n"Are you sixteen, my dear? Then you could not be taken against your\r\nwill."\r\n\r\n"Not till December. And oh! that gentleman, the conductor, he knew all\r\nabout it, I could see, and by and by I saw him lingering about the shop,\r\nas if he wanted to watch me."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lancelot Underwood! Oh, my dear, you need not be afraid of him,\r\nhe is a brother of Mrs. Grinstead\'s, a connection of Miss Mohun\'s; and\r\nthough he is such a musician, it is quite as an amateur. But, Lydia, I\r\ndo think that if you sing your best, he may very likely be able to put\r\nyou in a way to make your talent available so as to satisfy your mother,\r\nwithout leading to anything so undesirable and dangerous as a circus."\r\n\r\n"Then you think I ought--"\r\n\r\n"It is a dangerous thing to give advice, but really, my dear, I do think\r\nmore good is likely to come of this than harm."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. -- TWO SIDES OF A SHIELD AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale.\r\n                               Midsummer Night\'s Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earlier proofs of the Mouse-trap were brought by Lance, who had\r\nspent more time in getting them into shape than his wife approved, and\r\nthey were hailed with rapture by the young ladies on seeing themselves\r\nfor the first time in print. As to Gerald, he had so long been bred--as\r\nit were--to journalism that, young as he was, he had caught the trick,\r\nand \'The Inspector\'s Tour\' had not only been welcomed by the \'Censor\',\r\nbut portions had been copied into other papers, and there was a proposal\r\nof publishing it in a separate brochure. It would have made the fortune\r\nof the Mouse-trap, if it had not been so contrary to its principles, and\r\nit had really been sent to them in mischief, together with The \'Girton\r\nGirl\', of which some were proud, though when she saw it in print, with a\r\nlyre and wreath on the page, sober Mysie looked grave.\r\n\r\n"Do you think it profane to parody Jane Taylor?" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"No, but I thought it might hurt some people\'s feelings, and discourage\r\nthem, if we laugh at the High School."\r\n\r\n"Why, Dolores goes to give lectures there," exclaimed Valetta.\r\n\r\n"Nobody is discouraged by a little good-humoured banter," said Gillian.\r\n"Nobody with any stuff in them."\r\n\r\n"There must be some training in chaff though," said Gerald, "or they\r\ndon\'t know how to take it."\r\n\r\n"And in point of fact," said Dolores, "the upper tradesmen\'s daughters\r\ncome off with greater honours in the High School than do the young\r\ngentlewomen."\r\n\r\n"Very wholesome for the young Philistines," said Gerald. "The daughters\r\nof self-made men may well surpass in energy those settled on their\r\nlees."\r\n\r\nGerald and Dolores were standing with their backs to the wall of\r\nAnscombe Church, which Jasper Merrifield and Mysie were zealously\r\nphotographing, the others helping--or hindering.\r\n\r\n"I thought upper tradesfolk were the essence of Philistines," returned\r\nDolores.\r\n\r\n"The elder generation--especially if he is the son of the energetic man.\r\nThe younger are more open to ideas."\r\n\r\n"The stolid Conservative is the one who has grown up while his father\r\nwas making his fortune, the third generation used to be the gentleman,\r\nnow he is the man who is tired of it."\r\n\r\n"Tired of it, aye!" with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Why you are a man with a pedigree!" she returned.\r\n\r\n"Pedigrees don\'t hinder--what shall I call it?--the sense of being\r\nfettered."\r\n\r\n"One lives in fetters," she exclaimed. "And the better one likes one\'s\r\nhome, the harder it is to shake them off."\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked full at her, then exclaimed, "Exactly," and paused,\r\nadding, "I wonder what you want. Has it a form?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I mean to give lectures. I should like to see the world, and\r\nstudy physical science in every place, then tell the next about it. I\r\nread all I can, and I think I shall get consent to give some elementary\r\nlectures at the High School, though Uncle Jasper does not half like it,\r\nbut I must get some more training to do the thing rightly. I thought of\r\nUniversity College. Could you get me any information about it?"\r\n\r\n"Easily; but you\'ll have to conquer the horror of the elders."\r\n\r\n"I know. They think one must learn atheism and all sorts of things\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"You might go in for physical science at Oxford or Cambridge."\r\n\r\n"I expect that is all my father would allow. In spite of the colonies,\r\nhe has all the old notions about women, and would do nothing Aunt Lily\r\nreally protested against."\r\n\r\n"You are lucky to have a definite plan and notion to work for. Now fate\r\nwas so unkind as to make me a country squire, and not only that, but\r\none bound down, like Gulliver among the Liliputians, with all manner\r\nof cords by all the dear good excellent folks, who look on that old\r\nmediaeval den with a kind of fetish-worship, sprung of their having\r\nbeen kept out of it so long, and it would be an utter smash of all their\r\nhearts if I uttered a profane word against it. I would as soon be an\r\nancient Egyptian drowning a cat as move a stone of it. It is a lovely\r\nsort of ancient Pompeii, good to look at now and then, but not to be\r\nbound down to."\r\n\r\n"Like Beechcroft Court, a fossil. It is very well there are such\r\nplaces."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not to be the hope of them. It is my luck. If my eldest uncle,\r\nwho had toiled in a bookseller\'s shop all his youth and reigned like a\r\nlittle king, had not gone and got killed in a boating accident, there\r\nhe would be the ruling Sir Roger de Coverley of the county, a pillar of\r\nChurch and State, and I should be a free man."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t they let you go about, and see everything?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I am welcome to do a little globe-trotting. They are no fools;\r\nif they were I should not care half so much; but wherever I went, there\r\nwould be a series of jerks from my string, and not having an integument\r\nof rhinoceros hide, I could not disregard them without a sore more raw\r\nthan I care to carry about. After all, it is only a globe, and one gets\r\nback to the same place again."\r\n\r\n"Men have so many openings."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not rich enough for Parliament, and if I were, maybe it would be\r\nworse for their hearts," he said, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"There\'s journalism, a great power."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but to put my name to all I could--and long to say--would be an\r\nequal horror to the dear folks."\r\n\r\n"Yet you are helping on this concern."\r\n\r\n"True, but partly pour passer le temps, partly because I really want\r\nto hear \'The Outlaws Isle\' performed, and all under protest that the\r\nwindmill will soon be swept away by the stream."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, yes," cried Dolores. "They hope to regulate the stream. They\r\nmight as well hope to regulate Mississippi."\r\n\r\n"Well-chosen simile! The current is slow and sluggish, but\r\nirresistible."\r\n\r\n"Better than stagnating or sticking fast in the mud."\r\n\r\n"Though the mud may be full of fair blossoms and sweet survivals," said\r\nGerald sadly.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, people in the old grooves are delightful," said Dolores, "but\r\none can\'t live, like them, with a heart in G. F. S., like my Aunt\r\nJane, really the cleverest of any of us! Or like Mysie, not stupid, but\r\nwrapped up in her classes, just scratching the surface. Now, if I went\r\nin for good works I would go to the bottom--down to the slums."\r\n\r\n"Slums are one\'s chief interest," said Gerald; "but no doubt it will\r\nsoon be the same story over and over, and only make one wish--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That there could be a revolution before I am of age."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" cried Primrose, coming up as he spoke. "A revolution?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, guillotines and all, to cut off your head in Rotherwood Park,"\r\nsaid Gerald lightly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you don\'t really mean it."\r\n\r\n"Not that sort," said Dolores. "Only the coming of the coquecigrues."\r\n\r\n"They are in \'The Water Babies\'," said Primrose, mystified.\r\n\r\nEach of those two liked to talk to the other as a sort of\r\nfellow-captive, solacing themselves with discussions over the \'Censor\'\r\nand its fellows. Love is not often the first thought, even where it\r\nlurks in modern intellectual intercourse between man and maid; and\r\nthough Kitty Varley might giggle, the others thought the idea only\r\nworthy of her. Aunt Jane, however, smelt out the notion, and could not\r\nbut communicate it to her sister, though adding--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe in it: Dolores is in love with Physiology, and the\r\nboy with what Jasper calls Socialist maggots, but not with each other,\r\nunless they work round in some queer fashion."\r\n\r\nHowever, Lady Merrifield, feeling herself accountable for Dolores, was\r\nanxious to gather ideas about Gerald from his aunt, with whom she was\r\nbecoming more and more intimate. She was more than twenty years the\r\nsenior, and the thread of connection was very slender, but they suited\r\none another so well that they had become Lilias and Geraldine to one\r\nanother. Lady Merrifield had preserved her youthfulness chiefly from\r\nhaving had a happy home, unbroken by family sorrows or carking\r\ncares, and with a husband who had always taken his full share of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n"Your nephew\'s production has made a stir," said she, when they found\r\nthemselves alone together.\r\n\r\n"Yes, poor boy." Then answering the tone rather than the words, "I\r\nsuppose it is the lot of one generation to be startled by the next.\r\nThere is a good deal of change in the outlook."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Merrifield. "The young ones, especially the youngest,\r\nseem to have a set of notions of their own that I cannot always follow."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Geraldine eagerly.\r\n\r\n"You feel the same? To begin with, the laws of young\r\nladyhood--maidenliness--are a good deal relaxed--"\r\n\r\n"There I am not much of a judge. I never had any young ladyhood, but I\r\nown that the few times I went out with Anna I have been surprised, and\r\nmore surprised at what I heard from her sister Emily."\r\n\r\n"What we should have thought simply shocking being tolerated now."\r\n\r\n"Just so; and we are viewed as old duennas for not liking it. I should\r\nsay, however, that it is not, or has not, been a personal trouble with\r\nme. Anna\'s passion is for her Uncle Clement, and she has given up the\r\nseason on his account, though Lady Travis Underwood was most anxious to\r\nhave her; and as to Emily, though she is obliged to go out sometimes,\r\nshe hates it, and has a soul set on slums and nursing."\r\n\r\n"You mean that the style of gaieties revolts a nice-minded girl?"\r\n\r\n"Partly. Perhaps such as the Travis Underwoods used to take part in,\r\nrather against their own likings, poor things, are much less restrained\r\nfor the young people than what would come in your daughters\' way."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; though Lady Rotherwood has once or twice in country-houses had\r\nto protect her daughter, to the great disgust of the other young people.\r\nThat is one development that it is hard to meet, for it is difficult\r\nto know where old-fashioned distaste is the motive, and where the real\r\nprinciple of modesty. Though to me the question is made easy, for\r\nSir Jasper would never hear of cricket for his daughters, scarcely\r\nof hunting, and we have taken away Valetta and Primrose from the\r\ndancing-classes since skirt-dancing has come in; but I fear Val thinks\r\nit hard."\r\n\r\n"Such things puzzle my sisters at Vale Leston. They are part of the\r\nsame spirit of independence that sends girls to hospitals or medical\r\nschools."\r\n\r\n"Or colleges, or lecturing. Dolores is wild to lecture, and I see no\r\nharm in her trying her wings at the High School on some safe subject, if\r\nher father in New Zealand does not object, though I am glad it has not\r\noccurred to any of my own girls."\r\n\r\n"Sir Jasper would not like it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; but if my brother consents he will not mind it for\r\nDolores. She is a good girl in the main, but even mine have very\r\ndifferent ideals from what we had."\r\n\r\n"Please tell me. I see it a little, and I have been thinking about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps you will laugh, but my ideal work was Sunday-schools."\r\n\r\n"Are not they Miss Mohun\'s ideal still?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, infinitely developed, and so they are my cousin\r\nFlorence\'s--Lady Florence Devereux; but the young ones think them\r\nbehind the times. I remember when every girl believed her children the\r\nprettiest and cleverest in nature, showed off her Sunday-school as her\r\npride and treasure, and composed small pink books about them, where the\r\ncatastrophe was either being killed by accident, or going to live in the\r\nclergyman\'s nursery. Now, those that teach do so simply as a duty and\r\nnot a romance."\r\n\r\n"And the difficulty is to find those who will teach," said Geraldine.\r\n"One thing is, that the children really require better teaching."\r\n\r\n"That is quite true. My girls show me their preparation work, and I see\r\nmuch that I should not have thought of teaching the Beechcroft children.\r\nBut all the excitement of the matter has gone off."\r\n\r\n"I know. The Vale Leston girls do it as their needful work, not with\r\ntheir hearts and enthusiasm. I expect an enthusiasm cannot be expected\r\nto last above a generation and perhaps a half."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. A more indifferent thing; you will laugh, but my\r\nenthusiasm was for chivalry, Christian chivalry, half symbolic. History\r\nwas delightful to me for the search for true knights. I had lists of\r\nthem, drawings if possible, but I never could indoctrinate anybody with\r\nmy affection. Either history is only a lesson, or they know a great\r\ndeal too much, and will prove to you that the Cid was a ruffian, and the\r\nBlack Prince not much better."\r\n\r\n"And are you allowed the \'Idylls of the King\'?"\r\n\r\n"Under protest, now that the Mouse-trap has adopted Browning for weekly\r\nreading and discussion. Tennyson is almost put on the same shelf with\r\nScott, whom I love better than ever. Is it progress?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose it is, in a way."\r\n\r\n"But is it the right way?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I want to see."\r\n\r\n"Now listen. When our young men, my brothers--especially my very dear\r\nbrother Claude and his contemporaries, Rotherwood is the only one\r\nleft--were at Oxford, they got raised into a higher atmosphere, and came\r\nhome with beautiful plans and hopes for the Church, and drew us up\r\nwith them; but now the University seems just an ordeal for faith to go\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"I should think there was less of outward temptation, but more of subtle\r\ntrial. And then the whole system has altered since the times you are\r\nspeaking of, when the old rules prevailed, and the great giants of\r\nChurch renewal were there!" said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"You belong to the generation whom they trained, and who are now passing\r\naway. My father was one who grew up then."\r\n\r\n"We live on their spirit still."\r\n\r\n"I hope so. I never knew much about Cambridge till Clement went there,\r\nbut it had the same influence on him. Indeed, all our home had that one\r\nthought ever since I can remember. Clement and Lance grew up in it."\r\n\r\n"But you will forgive me. These younger men either go very, very much\r\nfurther than we older ones dreamt of, or they have flaws in their\r\nfaith, and sometimes--which is the strangest difficulty--the vehement\r\nobservance and ritual with flaws beneath in their faith perhaps, or\r\ntheir loyalty--Socialist fancies."\r\n\r\n"There is impatience," said Geraldine. "The Church progress has not\r\nconquered all the guilt and misery in the world."\r\n\r\n"Who said it would?"\r\n\r\n"None of us; but these younger ones fancy it is the Church\'s fault,\r\ninstead of that of her members\' failures, and so they try to walk in the\r\nlight of the sparks that they have kindled."\r\n\r\n"Altruism as they call it--love of the neighbour without love of God."\r\n\r\n"It may lead that way."\r\n\r\n"Does it?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we are the impatient ones now," said Geraldine, "in disliking\r\nthe young ones\' experiments, and wanting to bind them to our own views."\r\n\r\n"Then you look on with toleration but with distrust."\r\n\r\n"Distrust of myself as well as of the young ones, and trying not to\r\nforget that \'one good custom may corrupt the world,\' so it may be as\r\nwell that the pendulum should swing."\r\n\r\n"The pendulum, but not its axis--faith!"\r\n\r\n"No; and of my boy\'s mainspring of faith I _do_ feel sure, and of his\r\nreal upright steadiness."\r\n\r\nLady Merrifield asked no more, but could wait.\r\n\r\nBut is not each generation a terra incognita to the last? A question\r\nwhich those feel most decidedly who stand on the border-land of both,\r\nwith love and sympathy divided between the old and the new, clinging to\r\nthe one, and fearing to alienate the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. -- BUTTERFLY\'S NECTAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     If you heed my warning\r\n     It will save you much.--A. A. PROCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nClement Underwood was so much better as to be arrived at taking solitary\r\nrides and walks, these suiting him better than having companions, as he\r\nliked to go his own pace, and preferred silence. His sister had become\r\nmuch engrossed with her painting, and saw likewise that in this matter\r\nof exercise it was better to let him go his own way, and he declared\r\nthat this time of thought and reading was an immense help to him,\r\nrestoring that balance of life which he seemed to himself to have lost\r\nin the whirl of duties at St. Matthew\'s after Felix\'s death.\r\n\r\nThe shore, with the fresh, monotonous plash of the waves, when the tide\r\nserved, was his favourite resort. He could stand still and look out\r\nover the expanse of ripples, or wander on, as he pleased, watching the\r\nsea-gulls float along--\r\n\r\n\r\n          "As though life\'s only call and care\r\n             Were graceful motion."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been a somewhat noisy luncheon, for Edward Harewood, a\r\nmidshipman in the Channel Fleet, which was hovering in the offing, had\r\ncome over on a day\'s leave with Horner, a messmate whose parents lived\r\nin the town. He was a big lad, a year older than Gerald, and as soon as\r\na little awe of Uncle Clement and Aunt Cherry had worn off, he showed\r\nhimself of the original Harewood type, directing himself chiefly to what\r\nhe meant to be teasing Gerald about Vale Leston and Penbeacon.\r\n\r\n"All the grouse there were on the bit of moor are snapped up."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Gerald coolly.\r\n\r\n"Those precious surveyors and engineers that Walsh brings down can give\r\nan account of them! As soon as you come of age, you\'ll have to double\r\nyour staff of keepers, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"Guardians of ferae naturae," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"I thought your father did all that was required in that line," said\r\nClement.\r\n\r\n"Not since duffers and land-lubbers have been marauding over\r\nPenbeacon--aye, and elsewhere. What would you say to an engineer\r\npoaching away one of the august house of Vanderkist?"\r\n\r\n"The awful cad! I\'d soon show him what I thought of his cheek," cried\r\nAdrian, with a flourish of his knife.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! I bet that he will be shooting over Ironbeam Park long before\r\nyou are of age."\r\n\r\n"I shall shoot him, then," cried Adrian.\r\n\r\n"Not improbably there will be nothing else to shoot by that time,"\r\nquietly said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"I shall have a keeper in every lodge, and bring up four or five hundred\r\npheasants every year," boasted the little baronet, quite alive to the\r\npride of possession, though he had never seen Ironbeam in his life.\r\n\r\nEdward laughed a "Don\'t you wish you may get it," and the others, who\r\nknew very well the futility of the poor boy\'s expectations, even\r\nif Gerald\'s augury were not fulfilled, hastened to turn away the\r\nconversation to plans for the afternoon. Anna asked the visitor if he\r\nwould ride out with her and Gerald to Clipstone or to the moor, and was\r\nrelieved when he declined, saying he had promised to meet Horner.\r\n\r\n"You will come in to tea at five?" said his aunt, "and bring him if you\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully, but we hardly can. We have to start from the quay at\r\nsix sharp."\r\n\r\nAll had gone their several ways, and Clement, after the heat of the day,\r\nwas pacing towards a secluded cove out of an inner bay which lay nearer\r\nthan Anscombe Cove, but was not much frequented. However, he smelt\r\ntobacco, and heard sounds of boyish glee, and presently saw Adrian and\r\nFergus Merrifield, bare-legged, digging in the mud.\r\n\r\n"Ha! youngsters! Do you know the tide has turned? I thought you had had\r\nenough of that."\r\n\r\n"I thought I might find my aralia!" sighed Fergus. "The tide was almost\r\nas low."\r\n\r\nJust then there resounded from behind a projecting rock a peal of\r\nundesirable singing, a shout of laughter, and an oath, with--\r\n\r\n"Holloa, those little beasts of teetotallers have hooked it."\r\n\r\nThere were confused cries--"Haul \'em back! Drench \'em. Give \'em a roll\r\nin the mud!" and Adrian shrank behind his uncle, taking hold of his\r\ncoat, as there burst from behind the rock a party of boys, headed by the\r\ntwo cadets, all shouting loudly, till brought to a sudden standstill by\r\nthe sight of "Parson! By Jove!" as the Horner mid muttered, taking\r\nout his pipe, while Edward Harewood mumbled something about "Horner\'s\r\nbrother\'s tuck-out." One or two other boys were picking up the remains\r\nof the feast, which had been on lobsters, jam tarts, clotted cream,\r\nand the like delicacies dear to the juvenile mind. The two biggest\r\nschool-boys came forward, one voluble and thick of speech about Horner\'s\r\ntuck-out, and "I assure you, sir, it is nothing--not a taste. Never\r\nthought of such--" Just then the other lad, staggering about, had almost\r\nlurched over into the deepening channel; but Clement caught him by the\r\ncollar and held him fast, demanding in a low voice, very terrible to his\r\nhearers--\r\n\r\n"Where does this poor boy live?"\r\n\r\nIt was Adrian who answered.\r\n\r\n"Devereux Buildings."\r\n\r\n"You two, Adrian and Fergus, run to the quay and fetch a cab as near\r\nthis place as it can come," said Clement. "You little fellows, you had\r\nbetter run home at once. I hope you will take warning by the shame and\r\ndisgrace of this spectacle."\r\n\r\nThe boys were glad enough to disperse, being terrified by the condition\r\nof the prisoner, as well as by the detection; but the two who were\r\nencumbered with the baskets containing the bottles, jam-pots, and tin\r\nof cream remained, and so did the two young sailors, Horner saying\r\ncivilly--\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not be hard on the kids, sir, for just a spree carried a little\r\ntoo far."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not be hard on the children, whom you seem to have\r\ntempted," was the answer as they moved along; and as the younger Horner\r\nturned towards a little shop near the end of the steps to restore the\r\ngoods, he asked--"Were you supplied from hence?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Horner, who was perhaps hardly sober enough for caution.\r\n"Mother Butterfly is a jolly old soul."\r\n\r\nLooking up. Clement saw no licence to sell spirituous liquors under the\r\nname of Sarah Schnetterling, tobacconist. The window had the placard\r\n\'Ici on parle Francais\', and was adorned in a tasteful manner with\r\nornamental pipes, fishing-rods and flies, jars of sweets, sheets of\r\nforeign stamps, pictorial advertisements of innocuous beverages. A woman\r\nwith black grizzling hair, fashionably dressed, flashing dark eyes, long\r\ngold ear-rings, gold beads and gaudy attire, came out to reclaim her\r\nproperty. A word or two passed about payment, during which Clement had\r\na strange thrill of puzzled recollection. The bottles bore the labels of\r\nraspberry vinegar and lemonade, but he had seen too much not to say--\r\n\r\n"You drive a dangerous trade."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir, young people will be gourmands," she said, with a foreign\r\naccent. "Ah, that poor young gentleman is very ill. Will he not come in\r\nand lie down to recover?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said Clement. "A carriage is coming to take him home."\r\n\r\nSomething about the fat in the fire was passing between the cadets, and\r\nthe younger of them began to repeat that he had come for his brother\'s\r\nbirthday, and that he feared they had brought the youngsters into a\r\nscrape by carrying the joke too far.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to say to you, sir," said the Vicar of St. Matthew\'s,\r\nlooking very majestic, "except that it is time you were returning to\r\nyour ship. As to you," turning to Edward Harewood, "I can only say that\r\nif you are aware of the peculiar circumstances of Adrian Vanderkist,\r\nyour conduct can only be called fiendish."\r\n\r\nFergus and Adrian came running up with tidings that the cab was waiting.\r\nEdward Harewood stood sullen, but the other lad said--\r\n\r\n"Unlucky. We are sorry to have got the little fellows into trouble."\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, and Clement did not refuse it, as he did that of\r\nhis own nephew. Still, there was a certain satisfaction at his heart as\r\nhe beheld the clear, honest young faces of the other two boys, and he\r\nbade Adrian run home and wait for him, saying to Fergus--\r\n\r\n\r\n"You seem to have been a good friend to my little nephew. Thank you."\r\n\r\nFergus coloured up, speechless between pleasure at the warm tone of\r\ncommendation and the obligations of school-boy honour, nor, with young\r\nCampbell on their hands, was there space for questions. That youth\r\nsubsided into a heavy doze in the cab, and so continued till the arrival\r\nat No. 7, Devereux Buildings, where a capable-looking maid-servant\r\nopened the door, and he was deposited into her hands, the Vicar leaving\r\nhis card with his present address, but feeling equal to nothing more,\r\nand hardly able to speak.\r\n\r\nHe drove home, finding his nephew in the doorway. Signing to the maid to\r\npay the driver, and to the boy to follow him, he reached his study, and\r\nsank into his easy-chair, Adrian opening frightened eyes and saying--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll call Sibby."\r\n\r\n"No--that bottle--drop to there," signing to the mark on the glass with\r\nhis nail.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, while he held fast the boy, so to speak, with his eyes,\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear lad."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Clement," said Adrian then, "we weren\'t doing anything.\r\nMerrifield thought his old bit of auralia, or whatever he calls it, was\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"I saw--I saw, my boy. To find you--as you were, made me most thankful.\r\nYou must have resisted. Tell me, were you of this party, or did you come\r\non them by accident?"\r\n\r\n"Horner asked me," said Adrian, twisting from one leg to another.\r\n\r\nClement saw the crisis was come which he had long expected, and rejoiced\r\nat the form it had taken, though he knew he should suffer from pursuing\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n"Adrian," he said, "I am much pleased with you. I don\'t want to get you\r\ninto a row, but I should be much obliged if you would tell me how all\r\nthis happened."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t," returned Adrian, "but for that Ted and the other chap."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that there would have been none of this--drinking--but for\r\nthem? Don\'t be afraid to tell me all. Was the stuff all got from that\r\nMrs. Schnetter--?"\r\n\r\n"Mother Butterfly\'s? Oh yes. She keeps bottles of grog with those\r\nlabels, and it is such a lark for her to be even with the gangers that\r\nour fellows generally get some after cricket, or for a tuck-out."\r\n\r\n"Not Fergus Merrifield?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; he\'s captain, you know, but he is two years younger than\r\nCampbell and Horner, and they can\'t bear him, and when he made a jaw\r\nabout it--he can jaw awfully, you know--and he is stuck up, and Horner\r\nmajor swore he would make him know his bearings--"\r\n\r\n"I wonder he was there at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, Horner asked him, and he can\'t get those fossils that were lost\r\nout of his head, and he thought they might be washed up. He said too, he\r\nknew they would be up to something if he wasn\'t there."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Clement, with an odd recollection, "but I suppose he did not\r\nknow about these cadets?"\r\n\r\n"No, the big Horner sent up to Mother Butterfly\'s for some more stuff,\r\nnot so mild, and then Ted set upon me, and said it was all because of me\r\nthat Vale Leston had to live like a boiling of teetotal frogs and toads,\r\njust to please the little baronet\'s lady mamma, but I was a Dutchman\r\nall the same, and should sell them yet--I sucked it in so well, and they\r\ntalked of seeing how much I could stand. Something about my governor,\r\nand here--that word in the Catechism."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" gasped Clement, fairly clutching his arm, "and what spared you?"\r\n\r\n"Horner came down, and Sweetie Bob, that\'s the errand-boy, and there was\r\na bother about the money, for Bob wasn\'t to leave anything without being\r\npaid, and while they were jawing about that, Merry laid hold of me and\r\nsaid, \'Come and look for the aralia.\' They got to shouting and singing,\r\nand I don\'t think they saw what was doing. They were nasty songs, and\r\nMerry touched me and said, \'Let us go after the aralia.\' We got away\r\nwithout their missing us at first, but they ran after us when they found\r\nit out, and if you had not been there, Uncle Clem--"\r\n\r\n"Thank God I was! Now, Adrian, first tell me, did you taste this stuff?\r\nYou said you sucked it in."\r\n\r\n"Well, I did, a little. You know, uncle, one cannot always be made a\r\nbaby. Women don\'t understand, you know, and don\'t know what a fool it\r\nmakes a man to have them always after him, and have everything put out\r\nof his way like a precious infant, and people drinking it on the sly\r\nlike Gerald, or--"\r\n\r\n"Or me, eh, Adrian? I can tell you that I never tasted it for thirty\r\nyears, and now only as a medicine. Lance, never."\r\n\r\n"But they did not treat you like a baby, and never let you see so much\r\nas a glass of beer."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am going to treat you like a man, but it is a sorrowful history\r\nthat I have to tell you. You know that your mother and Aunt Wilmet are\r\ntwin sisters?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, though Aunt Wilmet is stout and jolly, and mother ever so much\r\nprettier and more delicate and nice."\r\n\r\n"Yes, from ill-health. She is never free from suffering."\r\n\r\n"I know. Old Dr. May said there was no help for it."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what caused that ill-health? My boy, they spoke of your\r\nfather to-day--brutes that they were," he could not help muttering.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he died when I was a week old."\r\n\r\n"He had ruined himself when quite a young man, body, soul, and\r\nestate--and you too, beforehand, in estate, and broken your mother\'s\r\nheart and health by being given up to that miserable habit from which we\r\nwant to save you."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was only poor men that got drunk and beat their wives"\r\n(more knowledge, by the bye, than he was supposed to possess). "He did\r\nnot beat her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no," said Clement, "but he as surely destroyed all her\r\nhappiness, and made you and your sisters very poor for your station in\r\nlife, so that it is really hard to educate you, and you will have to\r\nwork for yourself and them. And at only thirty-six years old his life\r\nwas cut off."\r\n\r\n"Was that what D. T. meant? I heard Ted whisper something about that."\r\n\r\n"It was well," thought Clement, "that he had grace enough to whisper.\r\nYes, my poor boy, it is only too true. I was sent for to find your\r\nfather dying of delirium tremens--you just born, your mother nearly\r\ndead, the desolation of your sisters unspeakable. He was only\r\nthirty-six, and that vice, together with racing, had devoured him and\r\nall the property that should have come to his children. I think he tried\r\nto repent at the very last, but there was little time, little power,\r\nonly he put you and your sisters in my charge, and begged me to save you\r\nfrom being like him."\r\n\r\n"Did they mean that I was sure to be like that? Like a pointer puppy,\r\npointing."\r\n\r\n"They meant it. And, Adrian, it is so far true that there is an\r\ninheritance--with some more, with some less--of our forefathers\' nature.\r\nSome have tendencies harder to repress than others. But, my dear boy,\r\nyou know that we all have had a force given us wherewith to repress and\r\nconquer those tendencies, and that we can."\r\n\r\n"When we were baptized, God the Holy Spirit," said Adrian, under his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"You know it, you can believe now. Your uncle Lance and I prayed that\r\nthe old nature might be put down, the new raised up. We pray, your\r\nmother and sisters have prayed ever since, that so it may be, that you\r\nmay conquer any evil tendencies that may be in you; but, Adrian, no one\r\ncan save you from the outside if you do not strive yourself. Now you see\r\nwhy your poor mother has been so anxious to keep all temptation out of\r\nyour reach."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m growing a man now. I can\'t always go on so."\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t. You shall be treated as a man while you are with me.\r\nBut I do very seriously advise you--nay, I entreat of you, not to begin\r\ntaking any kind of liquor, for it would incite the taste to grow upon\r\nyou, till it might become uncontrollable, and be your tyrant. If you\r\nhave reason to think the pledge would be a protection to you, come to\r\nme, or to Uncle Bill."\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by Sibby coming in with his cup of tea, and--\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Clement, whatever have you been after now? Up to your\r\nantics the minute Miss Cherry is out of the way. Aye, ye needn\'t go\r\nto palavering me. I hear it in your breath," and she darted at the\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had some, Sibby, since I came in."\r\n\r\n"More reason you should have it now. Get off with you, Sir Adrian, don\'t\r\nbe worriting him. Now, drink that, sir, and don\'t speak another word."\r\n\r\nHe was glad to obey. He wanted to think, in much thankfulness for the\r\npresent, and in faith and love which brought hope for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. -- A POOR FOREIGN WIDOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Art thou a magistrate?  Then be severe.--GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the day General Mohun received a note from Clement Underwood,\r\nbegging him to look in at St. Andrew\'s Rock as soon as might be\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said his sister, "I strongly suspect something wrong about the\r\nboys. Fergus was very odd and silent last night when I asked him about\r\nJem Horner\'s picnic, and he said something about that Harewood cousin\r\nbeing an unmitigated brute."\r\n\r\n"I hope Fergus was not in a scrape."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it is not his way. His geology is a great safeguard. If it had\r\nbeen Wilfred I might have been afraid."\r\n\r\n"His head is full--at least as much room as the lost aralia leaves--of\r\nthe examination for the Winchester College election."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you know Jasper has actually promised Gillian that if either\r\nof her brothers gets a scholarship, she may be allowed a year at Lady\r\nMargaret Hall."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it incited her to worry Wilfred beyond sufferance in his holidays.\r\nI know if you or Lily had been always at me I should have kicked as hard\r\nas he does."\r\n\r\n"Lily herself can hardly cram him with his holiday task; but Fergus is a\r\ngood little fellow."\r\n\r\n"You have kept him at it in a more judgmatical way. But won\'t Armytage\r\ncome in between the damsel and her college?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Armytage--Captain, I believe, for he has got his\r\ncommandership. Gill snubs him desperately. I believe she is afraid of\r\nherself and her heart."\r\n\r\n"I hope she won\'t be a goose. Jasper told me that he is an excellent\r\nfellow, and it will be an absolute misfortune if the girl is besotted\r\nenough to refuse him."\r\n\r\n"Girls have set up a foolish prejudice against matrimony."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am off. Clement Underwood is a reasonable man, and would not\r\nsend for me without cause."\r\n\r\nGeneral Mohun came to that opinion when he heard of the scene on the\r\nbeach, and of the absolute certainty that the contraband goods had been\r\nprocured at Mrs. Schnetterling\'s. Before his visit was over, a note came\r\ndown on gold-edged, cyphered pink paper, informing the Reverend E. C.\r\nUnderwood that Mrs. Campbell was much obliged to him for his attention\r\nto her son, who was very unwell, entirely from the effects of clotted\r\ncream. And while they were still laughing over the scored words, Anna\r\nknocked at the door with a message from her aunt, to ask whether they\r\ncould come and speak to poor Mrs. Edgar, who was in a dreadful state.\r\n\r\n"It is not about Adrian, I hope?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no, my dear; Adrian is all right, thanks to Fergus again," said\r\nher uncle. "He is the boy\'s great protector; I only wish they could be\r\nalways together."\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Edgar! Rumours had not been slow in reaching her of the\r\ncondition in which her scholars had been found, very odd rumours too.\r\nOne that James Campbell had been brought home insensible, and the two\r\nsailors carried on board in the like state; and an opposite report, that\r\nthe poor dear boys had only made themselves sick with dainties out of\r\nMrs. Schnetterling\'s, and it was all a cruel notion of that teetotal\r\nritualist clergyman. Some boys would not speak, others were vague and\r\ncontradictory, and many knew nothing, Horner and Campbell were absent.\r\nClement much relieved her by giving an account of the matter, and\r\ndeclaring that he feared his own elder nephew was the cause of all the\r\nscandal, though he believed that some of her bigger pupils were guilty\r\nof obtaining a smaller quantity, knowingly, of the Schnetterling\'s\r\nillicit wares, chiefly so far for the fun of doing something\r\nforbidden--"Stolen waters are sweet."\r\n\r\n"A wicked woman! Surely she should not be allowed to go on."\r\n\r\n"I am going, on the spot, to see what can be done," said General Mohun;\r\n"but indeed I should have thought young Campbell rather too old for your\r\nprecincts."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes. He is troublesome, but he is so backward, and is so delicate,\r\nthat his mother has implored me to keep him on, that he may have\r\nsea-bathing. But this shall be the final stroke!"\r\n\r\n"It will be the ruin of your school otherwise," said the General.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it might. And yet Mrs. Campbell will never be persuaded of the\r\nfact! And she is a person of much influence! However, I cannot have my\r\npoor dear little fellows led astray."\r\n\r\nThen, with some decided praises of dear little Sir Adrian, and regrets\r\nat losing Fergus Merrifield, whom she declared, on the authority of her\r\ngentleman assistant, to be certain of success, she departed; and Clement\r\nresumed his task of writing letters, which he believed to be useless,\r\nbut which he felt to be right--one a grave warning to Edward Harewood,\r\nand one to his father, whose indulgence he could not but hold\r\naccountable.\r\n\r\nReginald Mohun meanwhile went his way to the officer of Inland Revenue,\r\nwho already had his suspicions as to Mrs. Schnetterling, and was glad\r\nof positive evidence. He returned with the General to hear from Mr.\r\nUnderwood the condition in which he had found the boys, and the cause he\r\nhad for attributing it to the supplies from Mother Butterfly, and this\r\nwas thought sufficient evidence to authorize the sending a constable\r\nwith a search-warrant to the shop. The two gentlemen were glad that the\r\ndetection should be possible without either sending a spy, or forcing\r\nevidence from the boys, who had much better be kept out of the matter\r\naltogether. No lack of illicit stores was found when the policemen made\r\ntheir descent, and a summons was accordingly served on its mistress to\r\nappear at the next Petty Sessions.\r\n\r\nReginald Mohun, used to the justice of county magistrates, and the\r\nunflinching dealings of courts-martial, was determined to see the affair\r\nthrough, so he went to the magistrates\' meeting, and returned with the\r\ntidings that the possession of smuggled tobacco ready for sale had been\r\nproved against Mrs. Schnetterling, and she had been fined twenty-five\r\npounds, to be paid at the next Petty Sessions. Otherwise goods would be\r\nseized to that value, or she would have a short term of imprisonment.\r\nThere was no doubt that contraband spirits were also found, but it was\r\nnot thought expedient to press this charge.\r\n\r\nHe said the poor woman had been in a great passion of despair, wringing\r\nher hands and weeping demonstratively.\r\n\r\n"Quite theatrical," he said. "I am sure she has been an actress."\r\n\r\n"It did not prejudice your hard-headed town-councillors in her favour,"\r\nsaid Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Far from it! In fact old Simmonds observed that she was a painted\r\nforeign Jezebel."\r\n\r\n"Not to her face!" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"We are not quite brutes, whatever you may think us, my boy," said the\r\nGeneral good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Gerald, in the same tone, "how could I tell how it might be\r\nwhen the Philistines conspired to hunt down a poor foreign widow trying\r\nto pick up a scanty livelihood?"\r\n\r\n"If the poor foreign widow had been content without corrupting the\r\nboys," said Clement, "she would have been let alone."\r\n\r\n"It was not for corrupting the boys. That was done--or not done--by my\r\namiable cousin Ted. What harm did her \'baccy do to living soul?"\r\n\r\n"It is a risky thing, to say the least of it, for a living soul to\r\ndefraud the revenue," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"Of which probably she never heard."\r\n\r\n"She must have seen the terms of her licence," said the General.\r\n\r\n"Aye, a way of increasing the revenue by burthens on the chief solace of\r\npoverty," said Gerald hotly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come to your senses by and by, young man," imperturbably\r\nanswered the General.\r\n\r\n"Is she likely to be able to pay?" asked Gerald in return.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, the policeman said she drove a very thriving trade, both with\r\nthe boys and with the sailors, and that there was no doubt that she\r\ncould pay."\r\n\r\nClement was very glad to hear it, for it not only obviated any sense\r\nof harshness in his mind, but he thought Gerald, in his present mood\r\nof compassion--or opposition, whichever it was--capable of offering to\r\nundertake to pay the fine for her.\r\n\r\nPoor little Ludmilla was found the next day by Mrs. Henderson, crying\r\nsoftly over her work at the mosaic department--work which was only\r\nthe mechanical arrangement from patterns provided, for she had no\r\noriginality, and would never attain to any promotion in the profession.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson took the poor girl to her own little office, to try to\r\ncomfort her, and bring her into condition for the rehearsal of the scene\r\nwith Ferdinand, which she was to go through in Mr. Flight\'s parlour\r\nchaperoned by his mother. She was so choked with sobs that it did not\r\nseem probable that she would have any voice; for she had been struggling\r\nwith her tears all day, and now, in the presence of her friend, she\r\ngave them a free course. She thought it so cruel--so very cruel of the\r\ngentlemen; how could they do such a thing to a poor helpless stranger?\r\nAnd that tall one--to be a clergyman--how could he?\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson tried to represent that, having accepted the licence on\r\ncertain terms, it was wrong to break them; and that the gentlemen must\r\nbe right to hinder harm to their nephews.\r\n\r\nIt seemed all past the poor girl\'s understanding, since the nephews had\r\ntaken no harm; and indeed the other boys had only touched the spirits\r\nby way of joke and doing something forbidden: it had all come of those\r\nhorrid young midshipmen, who had come down and worried and bothered her\r\nmother into giving them the bottles of spirits which had not been mixed.\r\nIt was very hard.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lydia, one sin leads no one knows where! Those little boys, think\r\nof their first learning the taste for alcohol in secret!"\r\n\r\nLydia did see this, but after all, she said, it was not the spirits, but\r\nthe tobacco, which the Dutch and American sailors were glad enough to\r\nexchange for her mother\'s commodities. She had never perceived any harm\r\nin the arrangement, and hardly comprehended when the saying, "Custom to\r\nwhom custom," was pointed out to her.\r\n\r\nKalliope asked whether the fine would fall heavily on her mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is worst of all. Mother is gone to Avoncester to raise the\r\nmoney. She won\'t tell me how. And I do believe O\'Leary\'s circus is\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nThen came another sobbing fit.\r\n\r\n"But how--what do you mean, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"O\'Leary was our clown when my father--my dear father--was alive. He was\r\na coarse horrid man, as cruel to the poor dear horses as he dared. And\r\nnow he has set up for himself, and has been going about all over the\r\ncounty. Mother has been quite different ever since she met him one day\r\nin Avoncester, and I fear--oh, I fear he will advance her this money,\r\nand make her give me up to him; and my dear father made her promise that\r\nI would never be on the boards."\r\n\r\nThis was in an agony of crying, and it appeared that Schnetterling had\r\nreally been a very decent, amiable person, who had been passionately\r\nfond of his little daughter. Her recollection dated from the time when\r\nthe family had come from America, and he had become partner in a circus,\r\nintending to collect means enough to retire to a home in Germany, but he\r\nhad died five years ago, at Avoncester, of fever, and his wife had used\r\nhis savings to set up this little shop at Rockquay, choosing that place\r\nbecause it was the resort of foreign trading-vessels, with whom her\r\nknowledge of languages would be available. She had suffered from the\r\nsame illness, and her voice had been affected at the time, and she was\r\naltogether subdued and altered, and had allowed her daughter to receive\r\na good National school training; but with the recovery of health,\r\nactivity, and voice, a new temper, or rather the old one renewed,\r\nhad seized her, and since she had met her former companion, Ludmilla\r\nforeboded that the impulse of wandering had come upon her, and that if\r\nthe interference of the authorities pressed upon her and endangered her\r\ntraffic, she would throw it up altogether, and drag her daughter into\r\nthe profession so dreadful to all the poor child\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the girl cried till she had no voice, and took but\r\npartial comfort from repeated assurances that her friends would do their\r\nutmost on her behalf. Mrs. Henderson tried to compose and cheer her,\r\nwalking with her herself to St. Kenelm\'s Parsonage, and trying to keep\r\nup her earnest desire to please Mr. Flight, the special object of her\r\nveneration. But wishes were ineffectual to prevent her from breaking\r\ndown in the first line of her first song, and when Mr. Flight\r\nblamed, and Lady Flight turned round on the music-stool to say\r\nseverely--"Command yourself, Lydia," she became almost hysterical.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," said Gerald. "Give her a glass of wine, and she will be\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no; please, I\'m temp--" and a sob.\r\n\r\nThe five o\'clock tea was still standing on a little table, and Gerald\r\npoured out a cup and took it to her, then set her down in an arm-chair,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go through Angus\' part, and she will be better," and as she tried\r\nto say "Thank you," and "So kind," he held up his hand, and told her to\r\nbe silent. In fact, his encouragement, and the little delay he had made,\r\nenabled her to recover herself enough to get through her part, though\r\nnothing like as well as would have been expected of her.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Gerald, "she will be all right when my uncle comes.\r\nWon\'t you, Mona?"\r\n\r\n"I should have expected--" began Lady Flight.\r\n\r\nGerald held up his hand in entreaty.\r\n\r\n"People\'s voices can\'t be always the same," he said cheerily. "I know\r\nour Mona will do us credit yet! Won\'t you, Mona? You know how to pity me\r\nwith my logs!"\r\n\r\n"You had better go and have some tea in the kitchen, Lydia," said Lady\r\nFlight repressively; and Ludmilla curtsied herself off, with a look of\r\ngratitude out of her swollen eyelids at Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Poor little mortal," he said, as she went. "I am afraid that in her\r\ncase summum jus was summa injuria."\r\n\r\n"It was quite right to prosecute that mischievous woman," said Mr.\r\nFlight.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," said Gerald; "but wheat will grow alongside of tares."\r\n\r\n"I hope the girl is wheat," half ironically and severely said the lady.\r\n\r\nGerald shrugged his shoulders and took his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. -- "SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     And with trumpets and with banners\r\n     As becomes gintale good manners.--THACKERAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA telegram from Sir Jasper brought the good news that Fergus\'s name was\r\nhigh on the Winchester roll, and that he was sure of entering college\r\nafter the holidays. Gillian alone was allowed to go up to the station\r\nwith her uncle Reginald to meet the travellers, lest the whole family\r\nshould be too demonstrative in their welcome. And at the same time there\r\nemerged from the train not only Captain Armytage, but also Lancelot\r\nUnderwood and his little boy. All the rest of his family were gone to\r\nStoneborough to delight the hearts of Dr. May and his daughter Ethel.\r\n\r\nGillian was in such training that she durst not embrace her brother when\r\nhe tumbled out of the carriage, though she could hardly keep her feet\r\nfrom dancing, but she only demurely said--\r\n\r\n"Mamma and all of them are at Aunt Jane\'s."\r\n\r\n"Come then," said Sir Jasper to Captain Armytage, for which Gillian was\r\nnot grateful, or thought herself not, for she made a wry face.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of luggage--theatrical appliances to be sent to\r\nthe pavilion.\r\n\r\n"This may as well go too," said Captain Armytage.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! It is the buccaneer\'s sword!" cried little Felix. "How lovely!\r\nLast time we only had Uncle Jack\'s, and this is ever so much longer!"\r\n\r\n"Do let me draw it!" cried Fergus.\r\n\r\n"Not here, my boy, or they would think a conspiracy was breaking out.\r\nHa!" as a sudden blare of trumpets broke out as they reached the station\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, is it for him?" cried Felix, who had been instructed in Fergus\'s\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n         "See, the conquering hero comes,\r\n          Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!"\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid the General.\r\n\r\nFergus actually coloured crimson, but the colour was deepened as he\r\nmuttered "Bosh!" while two piebald ponies, drawing the drummers and\r\ntrumpeters in fantastic raiment, preceded an elephant shrouded in\r\nscarlet and gold trappings, with two or three figures making contortions\r\non his back, and followed by a crowned and sceptred dame in blue, white,\r\nand gold, perched aloft on a car drawn by four steeds in glittering\r\ncaparisons.\r\n\r\n"Will you mount it, Fergus?" asked his uncle. "You did not expect such a\r\ndemonstration."\r\n\r\nFergus bit his lip. It was hard to be teased instead of exalted; but\r\nFely and he were absorbed in the pink broadsides that the lady in the\r\ncar was scattering.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CIRCUS--THIS NIGHT--ROTHERWOOD PARK.\r\n\r\n                   The Sepoy\'s Revenge!\r\n                   Thrilling Incidents!\r\n                    Sagacious Elephant!\r\n                  Dance of Arab Coursers!!\r\n                 Acrobatic Feats!! &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, daddy! daddy! do take me to see it!"\r\n\r\n"Father, I should like to see it very much indeed," were the\r\nexclamations of the two little boys. "You know I have never seen any\r\nacrobatic feats."\r\n\r\n"A long word enough to please you," said Uncle Reginald. "He deserves\r\nsomething. I\'ll take you, master."\r\n\r\n"I should think this was not of the first quality," said Sir Jasper.\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Novelty is the charm that one can have only once in one\'s\r\nlife," said the General.\r\n\r\n"Some of those van fellows are very decent folk," said Lancelot. "I have\r\nseen a great deal of them at Bexley Fair times. You would be astonished\r\nto know how grateful they are for a little treatment as if they were not\r\nout of humanity\'s reach."\r\n\r\nGillian was trying to make Fergus tell her what his questions had been,\r\nand how he had answered them.\r\n\r\n"I declare, Gill, you are as bad as some of the boys\' horrid governors.\r\nThere was one whose father walked him up and down and wouldn\'t let him\r\nplay cricket, and went over all the old questions with him. I should\r\nnever have got in, if papa hadn\'t had more sense than to badger me out\r\nof my life."\r\n\r\nAt the gate between the copper beeches the Underwoods and Merrifields\r\nparted, with an engagement to meet at the circus on the part of the boys\r\nand their conductors.\r\n\r\nFergus was greeted with open-mouthed, open-armed delight by all the\r\nassembled multitude, very little checked by the presence of Captain\r\nArmytage. Only Lady Merrifield did not say much, but there was a dew in\r\nher eyes as she held fast the little active fingers, and whispered--\r\n\r\n"My good industrious boy."\r\n\r\nSir Jasper, in his grand and gracious manner, turned to his\r\nsister-in-law, saying--\r\n\r\n"We could not but come first to you, Jane, for it is to you that he is\r\nindebted, as we all are, primarily for his success."\r\n\r\n"That is the greatest compliment I ever had, Jasper," she answered,\r\nsmiling but almost tearful, and laughing it off. "I feel ready to mount\r\nyonder elephant lady\'s triumphal car."\r\n\r\nThe General refrained from any more teasing of Fergus on his first\r\nimpression; and at seven that evening the younger Merrifield boys with\r\ntheir uncle, and the two from St. Andrew\'s Rock with Lance, set off in\r\nhigh spirits.\r\n\r\nThey re-appeared much sooner than they were expected at Beechcroft\r\nCottage, where the Underwoods were spending the long twilight evening.\r\n\r\n"A low concern!" was the General\'s verdict.\r\n\r\n"We fled simultaneously from the concluding ballet," said Lance. "There\r\nhad been quite as much as we could bear for ingenuous youth."\r\n\r\n"We stood the Sepoy\'s Death Song," said the General, "but the poster of\r\nthe Bleeding Bride was enough for us."\r\n\r\n"They had only one elephant!" cried Adrian.\r\n\r\n"A regular swindle," said Wilfred.\r\n\r\n"No lions!" added Fely, "nothing to see but that poor old elephant! I\r\nwish he would have turned round and spouted water at them, as that one\r\ndid to the tailor."\r\n\r\n"Water would be uncommonly good for them," said the General, laughing,\r\n"they are not much acquainted therewith."\r\n\r\n"And such an atmosphere!" said Lance.\r\n\r\n"I see it on your forehead, poor boy," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"I should like to set on the Society against cruelty to animals," said\r\nthe General; "I saw galls on the horses\' necks, and they were all half\r\nstarved."\r\n\r\n"Then to see the poor old elephant pretend to be drunk!" added Fergus,\r\n"stagger about, and led off by the policeman, drunk and disorderly!"\r\n\r\n"Was that being drunk?" asked Adrian, with wide-open eyes. "It was like\r\nCampbell that day." Everybody laughed.\r\n\r\nWilfred did so now.\r\n\r\n"You green kid, you."\r\n\r\n"Happy verdure," said the General, "to be unaware that some people can\r\nlaugh when they ought to weep."\r\n\r\n"Weep!" exclaimed Wilfred, "every time one sees a fellow screwy in the\r\nstreet."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the angels do," murmured Clement.\r\n\r\n"Come, Master Wilfred, you have expressed your opinions sufficiently\r\nto-night," said the General. "Suppose you and Fergus walk home together.\r\nA nasty low place as ever I saw. I have a mind to tell the Mayor about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nGerald said--\r\n\r\n"Is not that making yourself very unpopular?"\r\n\r\n"That is no great matter," said the General, rather surprised.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought it better to refine the people\'s tastes than to\r\nthwart their present ones."\r\n\r\n"The improper must be stopped before the taste for the proper can be\r\npromoted," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"With all the opposition and ill-blood that you cause?" said Gerald.\r\n"Why, if I were an errand-boy, the suppression would send me direct to\r\nthe circus. Would it not do the same by you, Uncle Lance?"\r\n\r\n"Discouragement might, prohibition would prevent wholly, and I should be\r\nthankful," said Lance.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are of the old loyal nature," said Gerald. "You of the old\r\nschool can never see things by modern lights."\r\n\r\n"I am thankful to say--not," responded Reginald Mohun, in a tone that\r\nmade some laugh, and Gerald sigh in Anna\'s ear--\r\n\r\n"Happy those who see only one side of a question."\r\n\r\nThere was another great day for the boys, namely, the speech or closing\r\nday at the school, when Fergus was the undoubted hero, and was so\r\nexalted that his parents thought it would be very bad for him, and were\r\nchiefly consoled by his strong and genuine dislike to having to declaim\r\nwith Clement Varley the quarrel of Brutus and Cassius. He insisted on\r\nalways calling the former "Old Brute," and all the efforts of mother and\r\naunt never got him beyond the dogged repetition of a lesson learnt by\r\nheart, whereas little Varley threw himself into the part with spirit\r\nthat gained all the applause. Fergus carried off a pile of prizes too,\r\nbut despised them. "Stupid old poetry!" said he, "what should I do with\r\nthat? Do let me change it, father, for the Handbook of Paleontology, or\r\nsomething worth having."\r\n\r\nAdrian had three prizes too, filling Anna with infinite delight. He was\r\nnot to go home immediately on the break-up of the school, but was to\r\nwait for his sisters, who were coming in a few days more with Lady\r\nTravis Underwood to the bazaar and masque, so that he would go home with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNeither the prospect nor the company of little Fely greatly reconciled\r\nhim to the delay, but his mother could not believe that her darling\r\ncould travel alone, and his only satisfaction was in helping Fergus to\r\narrange his spare specimens for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. -- EXCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   But I needn\'t tell you what to do, only do it out of hand,\r\n   And charge whatever you like to charge, my lady won\'t make a stand.\r\n                                                        --T. HOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies\' committee could not but meet over and over again, wandering\r\nabout the gardens, which were now trimmed into order, to place the\r\nstalls and decide on what should and should not be.\r\n\r\nThere was to be an art stall, over which Mrs. Henderson was to preside.\r\nHere were to be the very graceful and beautiful articles of sculpture\r\nand Italian bijouterie that the Whites had sent home, and that were\r\nspared from the marble works; also Mrs. Grinstead\'s drawings, Captain\r\nHenderson\'s, those of others, screens and scrap-books and photographs.\r\nJasper and a coadjutor or two undertook to photograph any one who wished\r\nit; and there too were displayed the Mouse-traps. Mrs. Henderson, sure\r\nto look beautiful, quite Madonna-like in her costume, would have the\r\ncharge of the stall, with Gillian and two other girls, in Italian\r\npeasant-dresses, sent home by Aunt Ada.\r\n\r\nGillian was resolved on standing by her. "Kalliope wants some one\r\nto give her courage," she said. "Besides, I am the mother of the\r\nMouse-trap, and I must see how it goes off."\r\n\r\nLady Flight and a bevy of young ladies of her selection were to\r\npreside over the flowers; Mrs. Yarley undertook the refreshments; Lady\r\nMerrifield the more ordinary bazaar stall. Her name was prized, and\r\nAnna was glad to shelter herself under her wing. The care of Valetta and\r\nPrimrose, to say nothing of Dolores, was enough inducement to overcome\r\nany reluctance, and she was glad to be on the committee when vexed\r\nquestions came on, such as Miss Pettifer\'s offer of a skirt-dance, which\r\ncould not be so summarily dismissed as it had been at Beechcroft, for\r\nLady Flight and Mrs. Varley wished for it, and even Mrs. Harper was\r\nready to endure anything to raise the much-needed money, and almost\r\nthought Lady Merrifield too particular when she discontinued the\r\ndancing-class for Valetta and Primrose.\r\n\r\n"That speaks for itself," said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"I can fancy seeing no harm in it for little girls," said Lady\r\nMerrifield, "but I don\'t like giving them a talent the use of which\r\nseems to be to enable them to show off."\r\n\r\n"And I know that Lady Rotherwood would not approve," said Miss Mohun,\r\naware that this settled the matter. "And here\'s another outsider, Miss\r\nPenfeather, who offers to interpret handwriting at two-and-sixpence a\r\nhead."\r\n\r\n"By all means," was the cry. "We will build her a bower somewhere near\r\nthe photography."\r\n\r\n"I am only afraid," added Jane, "of her offering to do palmistry. Do you\r\nknow, I dabbled a little in that once, and I came to the conclusion that\r\nit was not a safe study for oneself or any one else."\r\n\r\n"Quite right," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe in it then?"\r\n\r\n"Not so as to practise it, or accept it so far as the future is\r\nconcerned, and to play at it as a parody of fortune-telling seems to me\r\nutterly inadmissible."\r\n\r\n"And to be squashed with Lord Rotherwood\'s mighty name," said her\r\nsister, laughing.\r\n\r\nLady Rotherwood would do so effectively. Wherewith came on the question\r\nof raffles, an inexhaustible one, since some maintained that they were\r\ncontrary to English law, and were absolutely immoral, while others held\r\nthat it was the only way of disposing of really expensive articles.\r\nThese were two statues sent by Mrs. White, and an exquisite little\r\npicture by Mrs. Grinstead, worth more than any one could be expected\r\nto give. It was one that she had nearly finished at the time of Mr.\r\nGrinstead\'s illness--John Inglesant arriving in his armour of light on\r\nhis wedding morning--and the associations were so painful that she said\r\nshe never wished to see it again.\r\n\r\nThere were likewise a good many charming sketches of figures and\r\nscenery, over which Gerald and Anna grieved, though she had let them\r\nkeep all they could show cause for; but drawing had become as much her\r\nresource as in the good old days. She was always throwing off little\r\noutlines, and she had even begun a grand study, which she called "Safe\r\nHome," a vessel showing signs of storm and struggle just at the verge of\r\na harbour lost in golden light.\r\n\r\nAnd the helmsman\'s face?\r\n\r\nClement and Lance neither of them said in words whose it was, as they\r\nboth stood looking at it, and owned to themselves the steadfast face of\r\ntheir eldest brother, but Clement said, with a sigh--\r\n\r\n"Ah! we are a long way as yet from that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to hear you say so," exclaimed Lance; then laughing at\r\nhimself, "You are ever so much better."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I suppose I am to start again, going softly all my days,\r\nperhaps, and it is well, for I don\'t think the young generation can\r\nspare me yet."\r\n\r\n"Nor Cherry."\r\n\r\n"How thankful I am to have Cherry restored to me I cannot say, and I do\r\nnot feel convinced that there may not be care at hand with Gerald. The\r\nboy is in a reserved mood, very civil and amiable, but clearly holding\r\nback from confidence."\r\n\r\n"Does she see it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but she fancies he bestows his confidence on Dolores Mohun, the\r\ngirl from New Zealand, and resigns herself to be set aside. It is pretty\r\nwell time that we went to meet her."\r\n\r\nFor there was to be a dress rehearsal in the pavilion, to which certain\r\nspectators were to be admitted, chiefly as critics.\r\n\r\n"Do you walk up the hill, Clem?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as long as I don\'t go too fast. Go on if you are wanted, and I\r\nwill follow. Cherry has sent the carriage for an invalid who cannot\r\nventure to be there all the day."\r\n\r\n"Let them wait. A walk with you is not to be wasted. Run on, Fely, tell\r\nthem we are coming," he added to his little Ariel, who had got lost in\r\nJungle Beasts.\r\n\r\nAs they went up the hill together, Clement not sorry to lean on his\r\nbrother\'s arm, a dark woman of striking figure and countenance, though\r\nfar from young, came up with them, accompanied by a stout, over-dressed\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the cigar-shop woman," said Lance, "the mother of our pretty\r\nlittle Miranda."\r\n\r\n"I wonder she chooses to show herself after her conviction," said\r\nClement.\r\n\r\n"And if I am not much mistaken, that is the villain of The Sepoy\'s\r\nRevenge," said Lance. "Poor little Butterfly, it is a bad omen for her\r\nfuture fate."\r\n\r\nAs they reached the doors of the great hotel, they found the pair in\r\naltercation with the porter before the iron gate that gave admittance to\r\nthe gardens. "Mother Butterfly" was pleading that she was the mother of\r\nMiss Schnetterling, who was singing, and the porter replying that his\r\norders were strict.\r\n\r\n"No, not on any consideration," he repeated, as the man was evidently\r\nshowing him the glance of silver, and a policeman, who was marching\r\nabout, showed signs of meaning to interfere.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Gerald\'s quick steps came up from the inside.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Lance; every one is crying out for you. Vicar, Cherie is\r\nkeeping a capital place for you."\r\n\r\nThe gate opened to admit them, and therewith Mrs. Schnetterling, trying\r\nto push in, made a vehement appeal--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood, sir, surely the prima donna\'s own mother should not be\r\nexcluded."\r\n\r\n"Her mother!" said Gerald. "Well, perhaps so, but hardly this--person,"\r\nas his native fastidiousness rose at the sight.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said the porter. "Captain Henderson and Mr. Simmonds, they\r\nhave specially cautioned me who I lets in."\r\n\r\nThe man grumbled something about swells and insolence, and Lance, with\r\nhis usual instinct of courtesy, lingered to say--\r\n\r\n"This is quite a private rehearsal--only the persons concerned!"\r\n\r\n"And if I\'m come on business," said the man confidentially. "You are\r\nsomething in our line."\r\n\r\n"Scarcely," said Lance, rather amused. "At any rate, I don\'t make the\r\nregulations."\r\n\r\nHe sped away at the summons of his impatient son and Gerald.\r\n\r\nThey met Captain Henderson on the way, and after a hasty greeting, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"So you have let in the Schnetterling woman?"\r\n\r\n"One could not well keep out the mother," returned Lance.\r\n\r\n"Well, no, but did she bring a man with her? My wife says the poor\r\nlittle Mona is in mortal terror lest he is come to inspect her for a\r\ncircus company."\r\n\r\n"Quite according to his looks," said Lance. "Poor child, it may be her\r\nfate, but she ought to be in safe hands, but I suppose the woman wants\r\nto sacrifice her to present gain."\r\n\r\nThey went on their way, and Lance and Gerald were soon absorbed in their\r\ncares of arrangement, while Clement was conducted to the seat reserved\r\nfor him between his sister and Lady Merrifield. The pavilion had been\r\nfitted with stages of seats on the inner side, but the back--behind\r\nthe stage--was so contrived that in case of favourable weather the real\r\nsea-view could be let in upon occasion, though the curtain and adjuncts,\r\nwhich had been painted by some of the deft fingers at Vale Leston,\r\nrepresented the cavern; also there was a first scene, with a real sail\r\nand mast.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of semi-dress rehearsal, beginning with pirate songs by\r\nthe school-master and choir, who had little difficulty in arranging\r\nthemselves as buccaneers. The sail was agitated, then reefed, stormy\r\nsongs were heard, where Captain Armytage did his part fairly well; the\r\nboatswain was gratified by roaring out his part characteristically, and\r\nthe curtain fell on "We split, we split, we split."\r\n\r\nThen came a song of Prospero, not much disguised by a plaid and Highland\r\nbonnet, interrupted by the pretty, graceful Miranda, very shy and\r\nill-assured at first, but gathering strength from his gentle encouraging\r\nways, while he told what was needful in the recitative that he alone\r\ncould undertake. Then the elves and fairies, led by little Felix, in\r\na charming cap like Puck, danced on and sang, making the prettiest of\r\ntableaux, lulling Miranda to sleep, and then Ariel conversing in a most\r\ndainty manner with Prospero.\r\n\r\nNext Ferdinand and Miranda had their scene, almost all songs and duets.\r\nBoth sang very sweetly, and she had evidently gained in courage, and\r\nthrew herself into her part.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked party then came on the scene, performed their songs,\r\nand were led about Puck-fashion by the fairies, and put to sleep by the\r\nlament over Ferdinand. The buccaneers in like manner were deluded by\r\nmore mischievous songs and antics, till bogged and crying out behind the\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nTheir intended victims were then awakened, to find themselves in the\r\npresence of Prospero; sing themselves into the reconciliation, then\r\nmourn for Ferdinand, until the disclosure of the two lovers, and the\r\nfinal release of Ariel and the sprites, all singing Jacobite songs.\r\n\r\nTo those who were not au fait with the \'Tempest\' and felt no indignation\r\nor jealousy at the travesty, it was charming; and though the audience at\r\nthe rehearsal numbered few of these, the refined sweetness and power\r\nof the performers made it delightful and memorable. Every one was in\r\nraptures with the fairies, who had been beautifully drilled, and above\r\nall with their graceful little leader, with his twinkling feet and arch\r\nlively manner, especially in the parts with his father.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Miranda--or rather Angus and Mona--were quite ideal in\r\nlooks, voices, and gestures.\r\n\r\n"Almost dangerously so," said Jane Mohun; "and the odd thing is that\r\nthey are just alike enough for first cousins, as they are here, though\r\nShakespeare was not guilty of making them such."\r\n\r\n"The odd thing is," said Geraldine, as she drove home with Clement,\r\n"that this brought me back so strangely to that wonderful concert\r\nat home, with all of you standing up in a row, and the choir from\r\nMinsterham, and poor Edgar\'s star."\r\n\r\n"An evil star!" sighed Clement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. -- THE EVIL STAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Lancelot said,\r\n     That were against me, what I can I will;\r\n     And there that day remained.--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the night before the final bustle and fury, so to speak, of\r\npreparation were to set in, when arrivals were expected, and the sellers\r\nwere in commotion, and he had been all day putting the singers one by\r\none through their parts, that as he went to his room at night, there was\r\na knock at Lancelot\'s door, and Gerald came in, looking deadly white.\r\nHe had been silent and effaced all the evening, and his aunt had thought\r\nhim tired, but he had rather petulantly eluded inquiry, and now he came\r\nin with--\r\n\r\n"Lance, I must have it out with some one."\r\n\r\n"An Oxford scrape?" said Lance.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I wish it was only that." Then a silence, while Lance looked\r\nat him, thinking, "What trouble could it be?" He had been very kind and\r\ngentle with the little Miranda, but the manner had not struck Lance as\r\nlover-like.\r\n\r\nThere was a gasp again--\r\n\r\n"That person, that woman at the gate, do you remember?"\r\n\r\nTherewith a flash came over Lance.\r\n\r\n"My poor boy! You don\'t mean to say--"\r\n\r\nNeither could bring himself to say the word so sacred to Lancelot, and\r\nwhich might have been so sacred to his nephew.\r\n\r\n"How did you guess?" said Gerald, lifting up the face that he had hidden\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n"I saw the likeness between you and the girl. She reminded me of some\r\none I had once seen."\r\n\r\n"Had you seen her?"\r\n\r\n"Once, at a concert, twenty odd years ago. Your aunt, too, was strangely\r\ncarried back to that scene, by the girl\'s voice, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" said Gerald, still laying down his head and seeming\r\nterribly oppressed, as Lance felt he well might be.\r\n\r\n"It is a sad business for you," said the uncle, with a kind hand on his\r\nshoulder. "How was it she did not claim you before?--not that she has\r\nany real claim."\r\n\r\n"She did not know my real name. My father called himself Wood. I never\r\nknew the rest of it till after I came home. That fellow bribed the\r\ngardener, got in over the wall, or somehow, and when she saw you, and\r\nheard you and me and all three of us, it gave her the clue."\r\n\r\n"Well, Gerald, I do not think she can dare to--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" interrupted Gerald, "there\'s worse to come."\r\n\r\n"What?" said Lance, aghast.\r\n\r\n"She says," and a sort of dry sob cut him short, "she says she had a\r\nhusband when she married my father," and down went his head again.\r\n\r\n"Impossible," was Lance\'s first cry; "your father\'s first care was to\r\ntell Travis all was right with you. Travis has the certificates."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, it was no fault of my father--my father, my dear father--no,\r\nbut she deceived him, and I am an impostor--nobody."\r\n\r\n"Gently, gently, Gerald. We have no certainty that this is true. Your\r\nfather had known her for years. Tell me, how did it come out--what\r\nevidence did she adduce?"\r\n\r\nGerald nerved himself to sit up and speak collectedly.\r\n\r\n"I believe it is half that circus fellow\'s doing. I think she is going\r\nto marry him, if she hasn\'t already. She followed me, and just at the\r\nturn down this road, as I was bidding the Mona girl goodnight, she came\r\nup with me, and said I little thought that the child was my sister, and\r\nhow delightful it was to see us acting together. Well then, I can\'t say\r\nbut a horror came over me. I couldn\'t for the life of me do anything but\r\ndraw back, there was something so intolerable in the look of her eyes,\r\nand her caressing manner," and he shuddered, glad of his uncle\'s kind\r\nhand on his shoulder. "Somehow, I let her get me out upon the high\r\nground, and there she said, \'So you are too great a swell to have word\r\nor look for your mother. No wonder, you always were un vilain petit\r\nmiserable; but I won\'t trouble you--I wouldn\'t be bound to live your\r\ndull ennuyant ladies\' life for millions. I\'ll bargain to keep out of\r\nyour way; but O\'Leary and I want a couple of hundred pounds, and you\'ll\r\nnot grudge it to us.\' I had no notion of being blackmailed, besides I\r\nhaven\'t got it, and I told her she might know that I am not of age,\r\nand had no such sum ready to hand. She was urgent, and I began to think\r\nwhether I could do anything to save that poor little sister, when she\r\nevidently got some fresh impulse from the man, and began to ask me how\r\nI should like to have it all disclosed to my nobs of friends. Well, I\r\nwasn\'t going to be bullied, and I answered that my friends knew already,\r\nand she might do her worst. \'Oh, may I?\' she said; \'you wouldn\'t like,\r\nmy fine young squire, to have it come out that I never was your father\'s\r\nwife at all, and that you are no more than that gutter-child.\' I could\r\nnot understand her at first, and said I would not be threatened, but\r\nthat made her worse, and that rascal O\'Leary came to her help. They\r\nraised their demands somehow to five hundred, and declared if they had\r\nnot it paid down, they should tell the whole story and turn me out. Of\r\ncourse I said they were welcome. Either I am my father\'s lawful son, or\r\nI am not, and if not, the sooner it is all up with me the better, for\r\nwhatever I am, I am no thief and robber. So I set off and came down\r\nthe hill; but the brute kept pace with me to this very door, trying\r\nto wheedle me, I believe. And now what\'s to be done? I would go off at\r\nonce, and let Uncle Clem come into his rights, only I don\'t want to be\r\nthe death of him and Cherie."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lance, "my dear fellow! You have stood it wisely and bravely\r\nso far, go on to do so. I don\'t feel the least certain that this is not\r\nmere bullying. She did not tell you any particulars?"\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Not the name of this supposed predecessor of Edgar\'s? Where she may\r\nhave been married, or how? How she parted from him, or how she knows he\r\nwas alive? It sounds to me a bogus notion, got up to put the screw on\r\nyou, by surprise. I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do. I\'ll go down to the shop\r\ntomorrow morning, see the woman, and extract the truth if possible, and\r\nI fully expect that the story will shrink up to nothing."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not the estate I care for," said Gerald, looking somewhat cheered.\r\n"It is my father\'s honour and name. If that can be cleared--"\r\n\r\n"Do not I care?" said Lance. "My dear brother Edgar, my model of all\r\nthat was noble and brilliant--whom Felix loved above all! Nay, and you,\r\nGerald, our hope! I would give anything and everything to free you from\r\nthis stain, though I trust it will prove only mud that will not stick.\r\nAnyway you have shown your true, faithful Underwood blood. Now go to bed\r\nand sleep if you can. Don\'t say a word, nor look more like a ghost than\r\nyou can help--or we shall have to rouge ourselves for our parts. My boy,\r\nmy boy! You are Edgar\'s boy, anyway."\r\n\r\nAnd Lancelot kissed the young pale cheek as he had done when the little\r\nwounded orphan clung to him fourteen years ago, or as he kissed his own\r\nFelix.\r\n\r\nWhatever the night was to Gerald, long was the night, and long the light\r\nhours of the morning to the ever sleepless Lance before he could rise\r\nand make his way to the shop with any hope of gaining admission, and\r\nmany were the sighs and prayers that this tale might be confuted, and\r\nthat the matter might be to the blessing of the youth to whom he felt\r\nmore warmly now than since those winning baby days had given place to\r\nmore ordinary boyhood. He had a long time to pace up and down watching\r\nthe sparkling water, and feeling the fresh wind on the brow, which was\r\nas capable as ever of aching over trouble and perplexity, and dreading\r\nabove all the effect on the sister, whose consolation and darling Gerald\r\nhad always been. How little he had thought, when he had stood staunch\r\nagainst his brother Edgar\'s persuasions, that Zoraya was to be the bane\r\nof that life which had begun so gaily!\r\n\r\nWhen at last the door was unfastened, and, as before, by Ludmilla, he\r\ngreeted her kindly, and as she evidently expected some fresh idea about\r\nthe masque, he gave her his card, and asked her to beg her mother to\r\ncome and speak to him. She started at the name and said--\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, you will do nothing to hurt him--Mr. Underwood?"\r\n\r\n"It is the last thing I wish," he said earnestly, and Ludmilla showed\r\nhim into a little parlour, full of the fumes of tobacco, and sped away,\r\nbut he had a long time to wait, for probably Mother Butterfly\'s entire\r\ntoilette had to be taken in hand.\r\n\r\nBefore she appeared Lancelot heard a man\'s voice, somewhere in the\r\nentry, saying--\r\n\r\n"Oh! the young ass has been fool enough to let it out, has he? I suppose\r\nthis is the chap that will profit? You\'ll have your wits about you."\r\n\r\nLance was still his old self enough to receive the lady with--\r\n\r\n"I beg to observe that I am not the \'chap who will profit\' if this\r\nmiserable allegation holds water. I am come to understand the truth."\r\n\r\nThe woman looked frightened, and the man came to her rescue, having\r\nevidently heard, and this Lance preferred, for he always liked to deal\r\nwith mankind rather than womankind. Having gone so far there was not\r\nroom for reticence, and the man took up the word.\r\n\r\n"Madame cannot be expected to disclose anything to the prejudice of her\r\nson and herself, unless it was made worth her while."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Lance, as he looked her over in irony, and drew\r\nthe conclusion that the marriage was a fact accomplished; "but she has\r\ndemanded two hundred pounds from her son, on peril of exposure, and if\r\nthe facts are not substantiated, there is such a thing as an action for\r\nconspiracy, and obtaining money on false pretences."\r\n\r\n"Nothing has been obtained!" said the woman, beginning to cry. "He was\r\nvery hard on his poor mother."\r\n\r\n"Who forsook him as an infant, cast off his father, and only claims him\r\nin order to keep a disgraceful, ruinous secret hanging over his life for\r\never, in order to extort money."\r\n\r\n"Come now, this is tall talk, sir," said O\'Leary; "the long and short\r\nof it is, what will the cove, yourself, or whoever it is that you speak\r\nfor, come down for one way or another?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," responded Lance.\r\n\r\nNeither of the estimable couple spoke or moved under an announcement so\r\nincredible to them, and he went on--\r\n\r\n"Gerald Underwood would rather lose everything than give hush-money to\r\nenable him to be a robber, and my elder brother would certainly give no\r\nreward for what would be the greatest grief in his life."\r\n\r\nO\'Leary grinned as if he wanted to say, "Have you asked him?"\r\n\r\n"The priest," she muttered.\r\n\r\n"Ay, the meddling parson who has done for you! He would have to come\r\ndown pretty handsomely."\r\n\r\nLancelot went on as if he had not heard these asides.\r\n\r\n"I am a magistrate; I can give you in charge at once to the police, and\r\nhave you brought before the Mayor for conspiracy, when you will have to\r\nprove your words, or confess them to be a lie."\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least certain that where there was no threatening\r\nletter, this could succeed, but he knew that the preliminaries would be\r\nalarming enough to elicit something, and accordingly Mrs. O\'Leary began\r\nto sob out--\r\n\r\n"It was when I was a mere child, a bambina, and he used me so cruelly."\r\n\r\nThere was the first thread, and on the whole, the couple were angry\r\nenough with Gerald, his refined appearance and air of careless\r\nprosperity, to be willing that he should have a fall, and Lance thus\r\nextracted that the "he" who had been cruel was a Neapolitan impresario\r\nin a small way, who had detected that Zoraya, when a very little child,\r\nhad a charming voice, of which indeed she still spoke with pride, saying\r\nLida would never equal it. Her parents were semi-gipsies, Hungarian, and\r\nhad wandered all over the Austrian empire, acting, singing, and bringing\r\nup their children to the like. They had actually sold her to the\r\nimpresario, who had sealed the compact, and hoped to secure the valuable\r\ncommodity by making her his wife. In his security he had trained her\r\nin the severest mode, and visited the smallest want of success with\r\nviolence and harshness, so that her life was utterly miserable, and on\r\nmeeting her brother, who had become a member of a German band, she had\r\ncontrived to make her escape with him, and having really considerable\r\nproficiency, the brother and sister had prospered, and through sundry\r\nvicissitudes had arrived at being "stars" in Allen\'s troupe, where Edgar\r\nUnderwood, or, as he was there known, Tom Wood, had unfortunately joined\r\nthem; and the sequel was known to Lancelot, but he could not but listen\r\nand gather up the details, disgusted as he was--how the prima donna had\r\naccepted his attention as her right, till her jealousy was excited by\r\nhis evident attraction to "the little English doll, for whom he killed\r\nhis man"; how she resolved to win him, and how scandalous reports at\r\nlast had brought him to offer marriage, unknowing, it was plain, of her\r\npast. It was not possible to guess how much she was still keeping back,\r\nspeaking under terror and compulsion as she did. But she declared\r\nthat he had never loved her, and was always wanting her to be like ces\r\nAnglaises fades, and as to her child, he so tormented her about it,\r\nand the ways of his absurd mother and sisters, and so expected her to\r\nsacrifice her art and her prospects to the little wretch, that she was\r\nready to strangle it! "Maternal love, bah! she was not going to be like\r\na bird or a beast," she said, with a strange wild glance in her eyes\r\nthat made Lance shudder, and think how much more he respected the bird\r\nor beast. Then at Chicago, when Wood\'s own folly and imprudence had\r\nbrought on an illness that destroyed his voice, and she knew there would\r\nbe only starvation, or she should have to toil for the whole of them,\r\nSchnetterling, manager of a circus, fell in love with her, and made\r\nher good offers to sing in Canada, and Chicago was a place where few\r\nquestions were asked, so she freed herself.\r\n\r\nShe had made her rounds with Schnetterling, a prudent German, and in\r\nprocess of time had come to England, where, at Avoncester, both had been\r\nattacked by influenza; he died, and she only recovered with a total loss\r\nof voice; but he had been prudent and frugal enough to save a sufficient\r\nsum to set her up at Rockquay with the tobacco-shop. She had chosen that\r\nplace on account of American trading-vessels putting in there, as\r\nwell as those of various foreign nations, with whom her knowledge of\r\nlanguages was available, and no doubt there were some opportunities of\r\ndealing in smuggled goods. Just, however, as the smuggling was beginning\r\nto be suspected, the circus of O\'Leary came in her way, and the old\r\ninstincts were renewed. Then came the detection and prosecution, and the\r\nneed of raising the fine. She had recourse to O\'Leary, who had before\r\nbeen Schnetterling\'s underling, and now was a partner in Jellicoe\'s\r\ncircus, who knew her capabilities as a manager and actress, and\r\nperceived the probabilities of poor little Lida\'s powers. The discovery\r\nthat the deserted baby that she had left at Chicago was a young handsome\r\nsquire, well connected, and, in her eyes, of unlimited means, had of\r\ncourse incited both to make the utmost profit of him. That he should not\r\nwish to hush the suspicion up, but should go straight to his uncles, was\r\nto them a quite unexpected contingency.\r\n\r\nAll this was not exactly told to Lancelot, but he extracted it, or\r\ngathered it before he was able to arrive at what was really important,\r\nthe name of Zoraya\'s first husband, where she was married, and by\r\nwhom, and where she had parted from him. She was so unwilling to give\r\nparticulars that he began almost to hope to make her confess that the\r\nwhole was a myth, but at last she owned that the man\'s name was Giovanni\r\nBenista, and that the marriage had taken place at Messina; she knew not\r\nin what church, nor in what year, only it was before the end of the old\r\nregime, for she recollected the uniforms of the Bomba soldiers, though\r\nshe could not remember the name of the priest. Benista was old, very\r\nold--the tyrant and assassin that he was, no doubt he was dead.\r\nShe often thought he would have killed her--and the history of his\r\nill-treatment had to be gone through before it appeared that she had\r\nfled from him at Trieste with her brother, in an English trading-vessel,\r\nwhere their dexterity and brilliancy gained them concealment and a\r\npassage. This was certainly in the summer of 1865. Of Benista she knew\r\nnothing since, but she believed him to have come from Piedmont.\r\n\r\nLance found Gerald walking up and down anxiously watching for him, and\r\nreceiving him with a "Well!" that had in it volumes of suspense.\r\n\r\n"Well, Gerald, I do not think there can be any blame attached to your\r\nfather, whatever comes of it. He was deceived as much as any one else,\r\nand his attachment to you seems to have been his great offence."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven! Then he was deceived?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid there was some previous ceremony. But stay, Gerald! There\r\nis no certainty that it was valid in the first place, and in the next,\r\nnothing is known of Benista since 1865, when he was an old man, so that\r\nthere is a full chance that he was dead before--"\r\n\r\n"Before April 1868. I say, Uncle Lance, they want to make no end of a\r\nbear-fight for my coming of age. I must be out of the way first."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry out too soon. Even if the worst came to the worst, as the\r\nproperty was left to you by will individually, I doubt whether this\r\ndiscovery, if real, would make any difference in law. I do not know."\r\n\r\n"But would I take it on those terms? It would be simply defrauding\r\nClement, and all of you--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, long before, we may be satisfied," said Lance. "For the\r\npresent, I think nothing can be done but endeavour to ascertain the\r\nfacts."\r\n\r\n"One comfort is," said Gerald, "I have gained a sister. I have walked\r\nwith her to the corner of her place--the marble works, you know--and\r\nshe really is a jolly little thing, quite innocent of all her mother\'s\r\ntricks, thinking Mrs. Henderson the first of human beings, except\r\nperhaps Flight, the aesthetic parson. I should not have selected him,\r\nyou know, but between them they have kept her quite a white sheet--a\r\nMiranda any Ferdinand might be glad to find, and dreading nothing so\r\nmuch as falling into the hands of that awful brute. Caliban himself\r\ncouldn\'t have been worse! I have promised her to do what I can to save\r\nher--buy her off--anything."\r\n\r\n"Poor child," said Lance. "But, Gerald, nothing of this must be said\r\nthese next few days. We can\'t put ourselves out of condition for this\r\nsame raree-show."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it\'s a mere abomination to me," said Gerald disconsolately. "I\r\ncan\'t think why we should be dragged into all this nuisance for what is\r\nnot even our own concern."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I thought you the rope that dragged me! At any rate much\r\nhigher up on it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I never thought you would respond--you, who have enough on your\r\nhands at Bexley."\r\n\r\n"One stroke even on the outskirts is a stroke for all the cause."\r\n\r\n"The cause! I don\'t believe in the cause, whatever it is. What a\r\nconcatenation now, that you and I should make fools of ourselves in\r\norder to stave off the establishment of national education, as if we\r\ncould, or as if it was worth doing."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you undertake it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! Why, one wants something to do down here, and the Merrifield\r\nlot are gone upon it; and I did want to go through the thing again, but\r\nnow it seems all rot."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, having pledged ourselves to the performance, we cannot\r\ncry off, and the present duty is to pack dull care away, put all\r\nthis out of our heads, and regard it as a mere mare\'s nest as long as\r\npossible, and above all not upset Cherry. Remember, let this turn out\r\nas it will, you are yourself still, and her own boy, beloved for your\r\nfather\'s sake, the joy of our dear brother, and her great comforter. A\r\nwretched mistake can never change that."\r\n\r\nLance\'s voice was quivering, and Gerald\'s face worked. Lance gave his\r\nhand a squeeze, and found voice to say--\r\n\r\n"\'Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon Him.\' And\r\nmeantime be a man over it. It can be done. I have often had to forget."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. -- SHOP-DRESSING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     But I can\'t conceive, in this very hot weather,\r\n     How I\'m ever to bring all these people together.\r\n                                                 T. HOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not a day when any one could afford to be upset. It was chiefly\r\nspent in welcoming arrivals or in rushing about: on the part of Lance\r\nand Gerald in freshly rehearsing each performer, in superintending their\r\nstage arrangements, reviewing the dresses, and preparing for one grand\r\nfinal rehearsal; and in the multifarious occupations and anxieties, and\r\nabove all in the music, Gerald did really forget, or only now and then\r\nrecollect, that a nightmare was hanging on him, and that his little Mona\r\nneed not shrink from him in maidenly shyness, but that he might well\r\nreturn her pretty appealing look of confidence.\r\n\r\nThe only quiet place in the town apparently was Clement Underwood\'s\r\nroom, for even Cherry had been whirled off, at first to arrange her\r\nown pictures and drawings; and then her wonderful touch made such a\r\ndifference in the whole appearance of the stall, and her dainty devices\r\nwere so graceful and effective, that Gillian and Mysie implored her to\r\ncome and tell them what to do with theirs, where they were struggling\r\nwith cushions, shawls, and bags, with the somewhat futile assistance of\r\nMr. Armine Brownlow and Captain Armytage, whenever the latter could be\r\nspared from the theatrical arrangements, where, as he said, it was\r\na case of parmi les borgnes--for his small experience with the\r\nWills-of-the-Wisp made him valuable.\r\n\r\nThe stalls were each in what was supposed to represent by turns a\r\nHighland bothie or a cave. The art stall was a cave, that the back\r\n(really a tool-house) might serve the photographers, and the front was\r\ndecorated with handsome bits of rock and spar, even ammonites. Poor\r\nFergus could not recover his horror and contempt when his collection of\r\nspecimens, named and arranged, was very nearly seized upon to fill\r\nup interstices, and he was infinitely indebted to Mrs. Grinstead for\r\nfinding a place where their scientific merits could be appreciated\r\nwithout letting his dirty stones, as Valetta called them, disturb the\r\ngeneral effect.\r\n\r\n"And my fern-gardens! Oh, Mrs. Grinstead," cried Mysie, "please don\'t\r\nsend them away to the flower place which Miss Simmonds and the gardeners\r\nare making like a nursery garden! They\'ll snub my poor dear pterises."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we\'ll make the most of your pterises. Look here. There\'s\r\nan elegant doll, let her lead the family party to survey them. That\'s\r\nright. Oh no, not that giantess! There\'s a dainty little Dutch lady."\r\n\r\n"Charming. Oh! and here\'s her boy in a sailor\'s dress."\r\n\r\n"He is big enough to be her husband, my dear. You had better observe\r\nproportions, and put that family nearer the eye."\r\n\r\n"Those dolls!" cried Valetta, "they were our despair."\r\n\r\n"Make them tell a story, don\'t you see. Where\'s that fat red cushion?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that cushion! I put it out of sight because it is such a monster."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is just like brick-dust enlivened by half-boiled cauliflowers!\r\nNever mind, it will be all the better background. Now, I saw a majestic\r\nlady reposing somewhere. There, let her sit against it. Oh, she mustn\'t\r\nflop over. Here, that match-box, is it? I pity the person deluded enough\r\nto use it! Prop her up with it. Now then, let us have a presentation\r\nof ladies--she\'s a governor\'s wife in the colonies, you see. Never mind\r\ncostumes, they may be queer. All that will stand or kneel--that\'s right.\r\nThose that can only sit must hide behind, like poor Marie Antoinette\'s\r\nladies on the giggling occasion."\r\n\r\nSo she went on, full of fun, which made the work doubly delightful\r\nto the girls, who darted about while she put the finishing touches,\r\ntransforming the draperies from the aspect of a rag-and-bone shop, as\r\nJasper had called it, to a wonderful quaint and pretty fairy bower,\r\nbacked by the Indian scenes sent by Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Underwood, and\r\nthat other lovely one of Primrose\'s pasture. There the merry musical\r\nlaugh of her youth was to be heard, as General Mohun came out with\r\nLancelot to make a raid, order the whole party to come and eat luncheon\r\nat Beechcroft Cottage, and not let Mrs. Grinstead come out again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I must finish up Bernard\'s clay costume figures. Look at\r\nthe expression of that delightful dollie! I\'m sure he is watching the\r\nkhitmutgars.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \'Above on tallest trees remote\r\n             Green Ayahs perched alone;\r\n           And all night long the Mussah moaned\r\n             In melancholy tone.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, don\'t you know Lear\'s poem? Can\'t we illustrate it?"\r\n\r\n"Cherry, Cherry, you\'ll be half dead to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Well, if I am, this is the real fun. I shan\'t see the destruction."\r\n\r\nLance had her arm in his grip to take her over the bridge over the wall,\r\nwhen up rushed Kitty Varley.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if Mrs. Grinstead would come and look at our stall and set it\r\nright! Miss Vanderkist gave us hopes."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"Now, Cherry, don\'t you know that you are not to be knocked up! There\r\nare the Travises going to bring unlimited Vanderkists."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know; but there\'s renovation in breaths from Vale Leston, and\r\nI really am of some use here." Her voice really had a gay ring in it.\r\n"It is such fun too! Where\'s Gerald?"\r\n\r\n"Having a smoke with the buccaneer captain. Oh, Miss Mohun, here\'s my\r\nsister, so enamoured of the bazaar I could hardly get her in."\r\n\r\n"And oh! she is so clever and delightful. She has made our stall the\r\nmost enchanting place," cried Primrose, dancing round. "Mamma, you must\r\ncome and have it all explained to you."\r\n\r\n"The very sight is supposed to be worth a shilling extra," said General\r\nMohun, while Lady Merrifield and Miss Mohun, taking possession of her,\r\nhoped she was not tired; and Gillian, who had been wont to consider\r\nher as her private property, began to reprove her sisters for having\r\nengrossed her while she herself was occupied in helping the Hendersons\r\nwith their art stall.\r\n\r\n"The truth is," said Lance, "that this is my sister\'s first bazaar, and\r\nso dear is the work to the female mind, that she can\'t help being sucked\r\ninto the vortex."\r\n\r\n"Is it really?" demanded Mysie, in a voice that made Mrs. Grinstead\r\nlaugh and say--\r\n\r\n"Such is my woeful lack of experience."\r\n\r\n"We have fallen on a bazaar wherever we went," said Lady Merrifield.\r\n\r\n"But this is our first grown-up one, mamma," said Valetta. "There was\r\nonly a sale of work before."\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and Lance said--\r\n\r\n"To Stoneborough they seem like revenues--at least sales of work, for I\r\ncan\'t say I understand the distinction."\r\n\r\n"Recurring brigandages," said General Mohun.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Uncle Reggie has never forgotten his getting a Noah\'s ark in a\r\nraffle," said Mysie.\r\n\r\nSo went the merry talk, while one and another came in at Miss Mohun\'s\r\nverandah windows to be sustained with food and rest, and then darted\r\nforth again to renew their labours until the evening, Miss Mohun flying\r\nabout everywhere on all sorts of needs, and her brother the General\r\nwaiting by the dining-room to do the duties of hospitality to the strays\r\nof the families who dropped in, chattering and laughing, and exhausted.\r\n\r\nLady Merrifield was authorized to detain Mrs. Grinstead to the last\r\nmoment possible to either, and they fell into a talk on the morality\r\nof bazaars, which, as Lady Merrifield said, had been a worry to her\r\neverywhere, while Geraldine had been out of their reach; since the\r\nUnderwoods had done everything without begging, and Clement disapproved\r\nof them without the most urgent need; but, as Lance had said, his\r\nwife had grown up to them, and had gone through all the stages from\r\ndelighting, acquiescing, and being bored, and they had so advanced\r\nsince their early days, from being simply sales to the grand period of\r\nornaments, costumes, and anything to attract.\r\n\r\n"Clement consents," said Geraldine; "as, first, it is not a church,\r\nand then, though it does seem absurd to think that singing through the\r\nmurdered Tempest should be aiding the cause of the Church, yet anything\r\nto keep our children to learning faith and truth is worthy work."\r\n\r\n"Alas, it is working against the stream! How things are changed when\r\nschool was our romance and our domain."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you should hear Lance tell the story of his sister-in-law Ethel,\r\nhow she began at Cocksmoor, with seven children and fifteen shillings,\r\nand thought her fortune made when she got ten pounds a year for the\r\nschool-mistress; and now it is all Mrs. Rivers can do to keep out the\r\nSchool-board, because they had not a separate room for the hat-pegs!"\r\n\r\n"We never had those struggles. We had enough to do to live at all in our\r\ndear old home days, except that my brother always taught Sunday classes.\r\nBut anyway, this is very amusing. Those young people\'s characters come\r\nout so much. Ah, Gerald, what is it?"\r\n\r\nFor Gerald was coming up to the verandah with a very pretty, dark-eyed,\r\nmodest-looking girl in a sailor hat, who shrank back as he said--\r\n\r\n"I am come to ask for some luncheon for my--my Mona. She has had nothing\r\nto eat all day, and we still have the grand recognition scene to come."\r\n\r\nAt which the girl blushed so furiously that the notion crossed Geraldine\r\nthat he must have been flirting with the poor little tobacconist\'s\r\ndaughter; but Lady Merrifield was exclaiming that he too had had nothing\r\nto eat, and General Mohun came forth to draw them into the dining-room,\r\nwhere he helped Ludmilla to cold lamb, salad, etc., and she sat down\r\nat Gerald\'s signal, very timidly, so that she gave the idea of only\r\npartaking because she was afraid to refuse.\r\n\r\nGerald ate hurriedly and nervously, and drank claret cup. He said they\r\nwere getting on famously, his uncle\'s chief strength being expended\r\nin drawing out the voice of the buccaneer captain, and mitigating the\r\nboatswain. Where were the little boys? Happily disposed of. Little Felix\r\nhad gone through his part, and then Fergus had carried him and\r\nAdrian off together to Clipstone to see his animals, antediluvian and\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThen in rushed Gillian, followed by Dolores.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother!" cried Gillian, "there\'s a fresh instalment of pots and\r\npans come in, such horrid things some of them! There\'s a statue in\r\nterra-cotta, half as large as life, of the Dirty Boy. Geraldine, do pray\r\ncome and see what can be done with him. Kalliope is in utter despair,\r\nfor they come from Craydon\'s, and to offend them would be fatal."\r\n\r\n"Kalliope and the Dirty Boy," said Mrs. Grinstead, laughing. "A dreadful\r\nconjunction; I must go and see if it is possible to establish the line\r\nbetween the sublime and the ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Shall I ask your nephew\'s leave to let you go," said Lady Merrifield,\r\n"after all the orders I have received?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--" she began, but Gerald had jumped up.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll steer you over the drawbridge, Cherie, if go you must. Yes,"--to\r\nthe young ladies--"I appreciate your needs. Nobody has the same faculty\r\nin her fingers as this aunt of mine. Come along, Mona, it is Mrs.\r\nHenderson\'s stall, you know."\r\n\r\nLudmilla came, chiefly because she was afraid to be left, and Lady\r\nMerrifield could not but come too, meeting on the way Anna, come to\r\nimplore help in arranging the Dirty Boy, before Captain Henderson\r\nknocked his head off, as he was much disposed to do.\r\n\r\nGillian had bounded on before with a handful of sandwiches, but Dolores\r\ntarried behind, having let the General help her to the leg of a chicken,\r\nwhich she seemed in no haste to dissect. Her uncle went off on some\r\nother call before she had finished, eating and drinking with the bitter\r\nsauce of reflection on the fleeting nature of young men\'s attentions and\r\neven confidences, and how easily everything was overthrown at sight of\r\na pretty face, especially in the half-and-half class. She had only just\r\ncome out into the verandah, wearily to return to the preparations, which\r\nhad lost whatever taste they had for her, when she saw Gerald Underwood\r\nspringing over the partition wall. Her impulse was to escape him, but it\r\nwas too late; he came eagerly up to her, saying--\r\n\r\n"She is safe with Mrs. Henderson. I am to go back for her when our duet\r\ncomes on."\r\n\r\nDolores did not want to lower herself by showing jealousy or offence,\r\nbut she could not help turning decidedly away, saying--\r\n\r\n"I am wanted."\r\n\r\n"Are you? I wanted to tell you why I am so interested in her. Dolores,\r\ncan you hear me now?--she is my sister."\r\n\r\n"Your sister!" in utter amaze.\r\n\r\n"Every one says they see it in the colour of our eyes."\r\n\r\n"Every one"--she seemed able to do nothing but repeat his words.\r\n\r\n"Well, my uncle Lancelot, and--and my mother. No one else knows yet.\r\nThey want to spare my aunt till this concern is over."\r\n\r\n"But how can it be?"\r\n\r\n"It is a horrid business altogether!" he said, taking her down to the\r\nunfrequented parts of the lower end of the garden, where they could walk\r\nup and down hidden by the bushes and shrubs. "You knew that my father\r\nwas an artist and musician, who fled from over patronage."\r\n\r\n"I think I have heard so."\r\n\r\n"He married a singing-woman, and she grew tired of him, and of me,\r\ndeserted and divorced him in Chicago, when I was ten months old. He was\r\nthe dearest, most devoted of fathers, till he and I were devoured by the\r\nIndians. If they had completed their operations on my scalp, it would\r\nhave been all the better for me. Instead of which Travis picked me\r\nup, brought me home, and they made me as much of an heir of all the\r\ntraditions as nature would permit, all ignoring that not only was my\r\nfather Bohemian ingrain, but that my mother was--in short--one of the\r\ngipsies of civilization. They never expected to hear of her again, but\r\nbehold, the rapturous discovery has taken place. She recognised Lance,\r\nthe only one of the family she had ever seen before, and then the voice\r\nof blood--more truly the voice of L s. d.--exerted itself."\r\n\r\n"How was it she did not find you out before?"\r\n\r\n"My father seems to have concealed his full name; I remember his being\r\ncalled Tom Wood. She married in her own line after casting him off, and\r\nthis pretty little thing is her child--the only tolerable part of it."\r\n\r\n"But she cannot have any claim on you," said Dolores, with a more\r\nshocked look and tone than the words conveyed.\r\n\r\n"Not she--in reason; but the worst of it is, Dolores, that the wretched\r\nwoman avers that she deceived my father, and had an old rascally tyrant\r\nof an Italian husband, who might have been alive when she married."\r\n\r\n"Gerald!"\r\n\r\nDolores stood still and looked at him with her eyes opened in horror.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you may well say Gerald. \'Tis the only name I have a right to if\r\nthis is true."\r\n\r\n"But you are still yourself," and she held out her hand.\r\n\r\nHe did not take it, however, only saying--\r\n\r\n"You know what this means?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do, but that does not alter you--yourself in yourself."\r\n\r\n"If you say that, Dolores, it will only alter me to make me--more--more\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand again, and this time he did take it and press it,\r\nbut he started, dropped it, and said--\r\n\r\n"It is not fair."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, it is. I know what it means," she repeated, "and it makes no\r\ndifference," and this time it was she who took his hand.\r\n\r\n"It means that unless this marriage is disproved, or the man\'s death\r\nproved, I am an outcast, dependent on myself, instead of the curled\r\ndarling the Grinsteads--blessings on them!--have brought me up."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether I don\'t like you better so," exclaimed she,\r\nlooking into his clear eyes and fine open face, full of resolution, not\r\nof shame.\r\n\r\n"While you say so--" He broke off. "Yes, thus I can bear it better. The\r\nestate is almost an oppression to me. The Bohemian nature is in me, I\r\nsuppose. I had rather carve out life for myself than have the landlord\r\nbusiness loaded on my shoulders. Clement and Lance will make the model\r\nparson and squire far better than I. \'The Inspector\'s Tour\' was a\r\nsuccess--between that and the Underwood music there\'s no fear but I\r\nshall get an independent career."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that is noble! You will be much more than your old self--as you\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"The breaking of Cherie\'s heart is all that I care about," said he. "To\r\nher I was comfort, almost compensation for those brothers. I don\'t\r\nknow how--" He paused. "We\'ll let her alone till all this is over; so,\r\nDolores, not one word to any one."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" she exclaimed. "I will--I will be true to you through\r\neverything, Gerald; I will wait till you have seen your way, and be\r\nproud of you through all."\r\n\r\n"Then I can bear it--I have my incentive," he said. "First, you see, I\r\nmust try to rescue my sister. I do not think it will be hard, for the\r\nmaternal heart seems to be denied to that woman. Then proofs must be\r\nsought, and according as they are found or not--"\r\n\r\nLoud calls of "Gerald" and "Mr. Underwood" began to resound. He\r\nfinished--\r\n\r\n"Must be _the_ future."\r\n\r\n"_Our_ future," repeated Dolores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. -- FRENCH LEAVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     She came, she is gone, we have met,\r\n     And meet perhaps never again.--COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening of that day was a scene of welcomes, dinners, and confusion.\r\nThe Rotherwoods had arrived that evening at the Cliff Hotel just in time\r\nfor dinner, of which they considerately partook where they were, to save\r\nJane Mohun trouble; but all four of the party came the instant it was\r\nover to hear and see all that was going on, and were fervently received\r\nby Gillian and Mysie, who were sleeping at their aunt\'s to be ready for\r\nthe morrow, and in spite of all fatigue, had legs wherewith to walk Lord\r\nIvinghoe and Lady Phyllis round the stalls, now closed up by canvas and\r\nguarded by police. Phyllis was only mournful not to have assisted in the\r\npreparations, and heard all the fun that Mrs. Grinstead had made.\r\nBut over the wall of Carrara a sight was seen for which no one was\r\nprepared--no other than Maura White\'s pretty classical face!\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "how could I be away from such an occasion? I made\r\nUncle White bring me to London--he had business there, you know--and\r\nthen I descended on Kalliope, and wasn\'t she surprised! But I have a\r\nlovely Italian dress!"\r\n\r\nKalliope Henderson looked more alarmed than gratified on the whole. She\r\nknew that there had been no idea of Maura\'s coming till after it had\r\nbeen known that the Rotherwoods were to open the bazaar, and "made Uncle\r\nWhite" was so unlike their former relations that all were startled,\r\nGillian asking in a tone of reproof how Aunt Adeline spared Maura.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we shall be back at Gastein in less than a week. I could not miss\r\nsuch an occasion."\r\n\r\n"I only had her telegram half-an-hour ago," said Kalliope, in an\r\napologetic tone; and Lord Ivinghoe was to be dimly seen handing Maura\r\nover the fence. Moonlight gardens and moonlight sea! What was to be\r\ndone? And Ivinghoe, who had begun life by being as exclusive as the\r\nMarchioness herself! "People take the bit between their teeth nowadays,"\r\nas Jane observed to Lady Rotherwood when the news reached her, and\r\nneither said, though each felt, that Adeline would not have promoted\r\nthis expedition, even for the child whom she and Mr. White had conspired\r\nto spoil. Each was secretly afraid of the attraction for Ivinghoe.\r\n\r\nAt St. Andrew\'s Rock there was a glad meeting with the Travis\r\nUnderwoods, who had disposed of themselves at the Marine Hotel, while\r\nthey came up with a select party of three Vanderkists to spend the\r\nevening with Clement, Geraldine, and Lancelot, not to mention Adrian,\r\nwho had been allowed to sit up to dinner to see his sisters, and was\r\nalmost devoured by them. His growth, and the improved looks of both\r\nhis uncle and aunt, so delighted Marilda, that Lancelot declared the\r\nRockquay people would do well to have them photographed "Then" and\r\n"Now," as an advertisement of the place! But he was not without dread of\r\nthe effect of the disclosure that had yet to be made, though Gerald had\r\napparently forgotten all about it as he sat chaffing Emilia Vanderkist\r\nabout the hospital, whither she was really going for a year; Sophy about\r\nthe engineer who had surveyed the Penbeacon intended works, and Francie\r\nabout her Miranda-Mona in strange hands.\r\n\r\nThe Vanderkists all began life as very pretty little girls, but showed\r\nmore or less of the Hollander ancestry as they grow up. Only Franceska,\r\ncontent with her Dutch name, had shot up into a beautiful figure,\r\ntogether with the fine features and complexion of the Underwood twins,\r\nand the profuse golden flax hair of her aunt Angela, so that she took\r\nthem all by surprise in the pretty dress presented by Cousin Marilda,\r\nand chosen by Emilia. Sophy was round and short, as nearly plain as one\r\nwith the family likeness could be, but bright and joyous, and very proud\r\nof her young sister. It was a merry evening.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Lance himself was so much carried away by the spirit of the\r\nthing, and so anxious about the performance, that he made all the\r\nrest, including Clement, join in singing Autolycus\'s song, which was\r\nto precede the procession, to a new setting of his own, before they\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nBut Lance was beginning to dress in the morning when a knock came to his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"A note from Mr. Flight, please, sir."\r\n\r\nThe note was--"Circus and Schnetterlings gone off in the night! Shop\r\nclosed! Must performance be given up?"\r\n\r\nThe town was all over red and blue posters! But Lance felt a wild hope\r\nfor the future, and a not ill-founded one for the present. He rushed\r\ninto his clothes, first pencilling a note--\r\n\r\n                 "Never say die.  L. 0. U."\r\n\r\nThen he hurried off, and sent up a message to Miss Franceska Vanderkist,\r\nto come and speak to him, and he walked up and down the sitting-room\r\nwhere breakfast was being spread, like a panther, humming Prospero\'s\r\nsongs, or murmuring vituperations, till Franceska appeared, a perfect\r\npicture of loveliness in her morning youthful freshness.\r\n\r\n"Francie, there\'s no help for it. You must take Mona! She has\r\nabsconded!"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Lance!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, gone off in the night; left us lamenting."\r\n\r\n"The horrible girl!"\r\n\r\n"Probably not her fault, poor thing! But that\'s neither here nor there.\r\nI wish it was!"\r\n\r\n"But I thought--"\r\n\r\n"It is past thinking now, my dear. Here we are, pledged. Can\'t draw\r\nback, and you are the only being who can save us! You know the part."\r\n\r\n"Yes, in a way."\r\n\r\n"You did it with me at home."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; but, Uncle Lance, it would be too dreadful before all these\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"Never mind the people. Be Mona, and only think of Alaster and Angus."\r\n\r\n"But what would mamma say, or Aunt Wilmet? And Uncle Clem?" each in a\r\nmore awe-stricken voice.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tackle them."\r\n\r\n"I know I shall be frightened and fail, and that will be worse."\r\n\r\n"No, it won\'t, and you won\'t. Look here, Francie, this is not a\r\nself-willed freak for our own amusement. The keeping up the Church\r\nschools here depends upon what we can raise. I hate bazaars. I hate\r\nto have to obtain help for the Church through these people\'s idle\r\namusement, but you and I have not two or three thousands to give away to\r\na strange place in a lump; but we have our voices. \'Such as I have give\r\nI thee,\' and this ridiculous entertainment may bring in fifty or maybe\r\na hundred. I don\'t feel it right to let it collapse for the sake of our\r\nown dislikes."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Uncle Lance, I\'ll do as you tell me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way to do it, my dear. At least, when you make ready,\r\nrecollect, not that you are facing a multitude, but that you are saving\r\na child\'s Christian faith; when you prepare, that you have to do with\r\nnobody but Gerald and me; when it comes to \'One, two, three, and away,\'\r\nmind nothing but your music and your cue."\r\n\r\n"But the dress, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"The dress is all safe at the pavilion. You must come up and rehearse as\r\nsoon as you have eaten your breakfast. Oh, you don\'t know where. Well,\r\none of us will come and fetch you. Good girl, Francie! Keep up your\r\nheart. By the bye, which is Fernan\'s dressing-room? I must prepare him."\r\n\r\nThat question was answered, for Sir Ferdinand\'s door into the corridor\r\nwas opened.\r\n\r\n"Lance! I thought I heard your voice."\r\n\r\n"Yes, here\'s a pretty kettle of fish! Our Miranda has absconded, poor\r\nchild. Happy thing you brought down Francie; nobody else could take the\r\npart at such short notice. You must pacify Marilda, silence scruples,\r\nsay it is her duty to Church, country, and family. Can\'t stop!"\r\n\r\n"Lance, explain--do! Music-mad as usual!" cried Sir Ferdinand, pursuing\r\nhim down-stairs in despair.\r\n\r\n"I _must_ be music-mad; the only chance of keeping sane just now.\r\nThere\'s an awful predicament! Can\'t go into it now, but you shall hear\r\nall when this is over."\r\n\r\nWherewith Lance was lost to view, and presently burst into St. Kenelm\'s\r\nVicarage, to the relief of poor Mr. Flight, who had tried to solace\r\nhimself with those three words as best he might.\r\n\r\n"All right. My niece, Franceska Vanderkist, who took the part before,\r\nand who has a very good soprano, will do it better as to voice, if not\r\nso well as to acting, as the Little Butterfly."\r\n\r\n"Is she here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, by good luck. I shall have her up to the pavilion to rehearse her\r\nfor the afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood, no words can say what we owe you. You are the saving of\r\nour Church education."\r\n\r\nLance laughed at the magniloquent thanks, and asked how the intimation\r\nhad been received.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that on the previous evening O\'Leary had come to him, and,\r\nin swaggering fashion, had demanded twenty pounds as payment for his\r\nstep-daughter\'s performance at the masque. Mr. Flight had replied that\r\nshe had freely promised her services gratuitously for the benefit of the\r\nobject in view. At this the man had scoffed, talked big about her value\r\nand the meanness of parsons, and threatened to withdraw her. Rather\r\nweakly the clergyman had said the question should be considered,\r\nbut that he could do nothing without the committee, and O\'Leary had\r\ndeparted, uttering abuse.\r\n\r\nThis morning "Sweetie Bob," the errand-boy, had arrived crying, with\r\ntidings that the shop and house were shut up; nobody answered his knock;\r\nMother Butterfly had "cut" in the night, gone off, he believed, with\r\nthe circus, and Miss Lydia too; and there was two-and-ninepence owing to\r\nhim, besides his--his--his character!\r\n\r\nHe knew that Mother Butterfly had gone to the magistrates\' meeting\r\nthe day before, and paid her fine of twenty-five pounds, and he\r\nalso believed that she had paid up her rent, and sold her shop to a\r\nneighbouring pastry-cook, but he had never expected her to depart\r\nin this sudden way, and then he began to shed fresh tears over his\r\ntwo-and-ninepence and his character.\r\n\r\nMr. Flight began to reassure him, with promises to speak for him as\r\nan honest lad, while Lance bethought himself of the old organist\'s\r\ndescription of that wandering star, "Without home, without country,\r\nwithout morals, without religion, without anything," and recollected\r\nwith a shudder that turning-point in his life when Edgar had made him\r\nshow off his musical talent, and when Felix had been sharp with him, and\r\nthe office of the \'Pursuivant\' looked shabby, dull, and dreary.\r\n\r\nNothing more could be done, except to make bold assurances to Mr. Flight\r\nthat Mona\'s place should be supplied, and then to hurry home, meeting\r\non his way a policeman, who told him that the circus was certainly gone\r\naway, and promised to let him know whither.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to find that Gerald had not come down-stairs, having\r\noverslept himself in the morning after a wakeful night. He was dressing\r\nwhen his uncle knocked at his door.\r\n\r\n"Here is a shock, Gerald! I hope it is chiefly to our masque. These\r\npeople have absconded, and carried off our poor little Mona."\r\n\r\n"What? Absconded? My sister! I must be after them instantly," cried\r\nGerald, wildly snatching at his coat.\r\n\r\n"What good would that do? you can\'t carry her off vi et armis."\r\n\r\n"Send the police."\r\n\r\n"No possibility. The fine is paid, the rent and all. They have gone, it\r\nseems, with the circus."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Depend upon it that fellow has paid the fine, and bought the poor\r\nchild into slavery with it. Carried her off in spite of our demurring,\r\nand the Vicar\'s prosecution. I must save her. I\'ll go after and outbid."\r\n\r\n"No hurry, Gerald. A circus is not such a microscopical object but that\r\nit can be easily traced. A policeman has promised to find out where, and\r\nmeanwhile we must attend to our present undertaking."\r\n\r\nGerald strode up and down the room in a fiery fit of impatience and\r\nindignation, muttering furious things, quite transformed from the\r\nlistless, ironical youth hitherto known to his family.\r\n\r\n"Come," Lancelot said, "our first duty is to do justice to our part;\r\nFrancie Vanderkist will take Mona."\r\n\r\n"Hang Mona! you care for nothing on earth but your fiddling and songs."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that being frantic will make any difference to the\r\nsituation. All in our power is being done. Meanwhile, we must attend to\r\nwhat we have undertaken."\r\n\r\nGerald rushed about a little more, but finally listened to his uncle\'s\r\nrepresentation that the engrossing employment was good to prevent the\r\nperil of disturbing the two whom they were so anxious to spare. Fely\r\ncame running up with a message that Aunt Cherie and Anna had been sent\r\nfor to see about the decorations of the art stall, and that they would\r\nhave to eat their breakfast without them.\r\n\r\nAppetite for breakfast was lacking, but Lance forced himself to swallow,\r\nas one aware of the consequences of fasting for agitation\'s sake, and he\r\nnearly crammed Gerald; so that Adrian and Fely laughed, and he excused\r\nhimself by declaring that he wanted his turkey-cock to gobble and not\r\npipe. For which bit of pleasantry he encountered a glare from Gerald\'s\r\nHungarian eyes. He was afraid on one side to lose sight of his nephew,\r\non the other he did not feel equal to encounter a scolding from Marilda,\r\nso he sent Adrian and Fely down to the Marine Hotel to fetch Franceska,\r\nwhile he stole a moment or two for greeting Clement, who was much\r\nbetter, and only wanted more conversation than he durst give him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. -- THE MASQUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Your honour\'s players, hearing your amendment,\r\n     Are come to play a pleasant comedy.\r\n                                  Taming of the Shrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Franceska! First she encountered Cousin Marilda\'s wonder and\r\ndispleasure, and the declaration that Uncle Lance went absolutely crazy\r\nover his musical mania. She had seen it before in poor Edgar, and knew\r\nwhat it came to. She wanted to telegraph at once to Alda to ask her\r\nconsent or refusal to Franceska\'s appearance; but Sir Ferdinand stopped\r\nthis on the ground that the circumstances could not be explained, and\r\ntold her to content herself with Clement\'s opinion.\r\n\r\nThis she sent Sophy and Emilia to ascertain, before she would let them\r\nand the boys escort Francie to her destination. Clement, not yet up, had\r\nto hold a lit de justice, and pronounce that Uncle Lance was to be fully\r\ntrusted to ask nothing unbecoming or unnecessary, and that Francie would\r\nhave nothing to do with any one except him and Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Emilia, as they walked up, "nobody will find it out. The\r\nposters are all over the town, \'Mona, Miss Ludmilla Schnetterling.\'"\r\n\r\nSo the sisters were received with a murmur on their delay. The pretty\r\ndress prepared for Mona was found to be too small for the tall shapely\r\nFranceska, and Sophy undertook to alter it, while poor Francie\'s\r\ntroubles began.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that Uncle Lance and Gerald were in a secret state of\r\nturmoil, or that their requirements were a good deal higher than for the\r\nVale Leston audience, or perhaps that she had no inheritance of actress\r\ntraditions, they certainly were a great deal sharper with her than they\r\nhad been ever before or with Ludmilla.\r\n\r\nGerald derided her efforts sarcastically, and Uncle Lance found fault\r\ngood-humouredly but seriously, and she was nearly in tears by eleven\r\no\'clock, when the procession was to take place. She was quite surprised\r\nwhen Lance turned to her and said--\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear, you are doing capitally. I shall be proud of my\r\ndaughter Mona."\r\n\r\nQuite in spirits again, she was sewn by Sophy into her still unfinished\r\ndress, her beautiful light golden flax tresses were snooded, her\r\nHighland scarf pinned on her shoulder, and she hurried to her uncle, now\r\nbe-robed and be-wigged, with Gerald in full Highland garb, looking very\r\nmuch disgusted, especially when her uncle said--\r\n\r\n"Well done, Francie. You\'ll cut that poor little thing out in looks and\r\nvoice, if not in acting."\r\n\r\n"Oh, uncle, I sang so horridly."\r\n\r\n"You can do better if you try; I wish there was time to train you.\r\nWe\'ll do the \'logs duet\' once more after this tomfoolery. Ha! Captain\r\nArmytage. You are an awful pirate, and no mistake. Where did you get\r\nthat splendid horse-pistol?"\r\n\r\n"From my native home, as well as my sword; but I wrote to Willingham for\r\nthe rest. This will be an uncommonly pretty march-past. The girls look\r\nso well, and all out of doors too."\r\n\r\nThis was decidedly a great advantage, the trees, grass, and blue sky\r\nlending a great grace to the scene. The procession started from the\r\ngarden entrance of the hotel, headed by the town band in uniform, and\r\nthe fire brigade likewise, very proud of themselves, especially the\r\nlittle terrier whom nothing would detach from one of the firemen. Then\r\ncame the four seasons belonging to the flower stall, appropriately\r\ndecked with flowers, the Italian peasants with flat veils, bright\r\naprons, and white sleeves, Maura White\'s beauty conspicuous in the\r\nmidst, but with unnecessary nods and becks. Then came the "mediaeval"\r\ndamsels in ruffs and high hats, the Highland maidens, with Valetta and\r\nPrimrose giggling unmanageably; and Aunt Jane\'s troop of the various\r\ncostumes of charity children, from the green frocks, long mittens, and\r\ntall white caps, and the Jemima Placid flat hats and long waists, down\r\nto the red cloaks, poke straw bonnets, and blue frocks of the Lady\r\nBountiful age. These were followed by the merry fairies and elves; then\r\nby the buccaneers and the captive prisoners; and the rear was brought up\r\nby MacProspero, as Lord Rotherwood called him, with his niece on his arm\r\nand his nephew by his side.\r\n\r\nWhen the central stall, or bothie, in the Carrara grounds was reached,\r\nafter passing in full state and order over two of the bridges, the\r\nprocession halted before a group of the Rotherwood family, Sir Jasper\r\nand Lady Merrifield, Lady Flight, and other local grandees, with the\r\nclergy, who had declined to walk in procession. There the performers\r\nspread themselves out, singing Autolycus\'s song, led of course by\r\nMacProspero; Lady Rotherwood, with as much dignity as the occasion\r\npermitted, declared the bazaar open, and the Marquis hoped every one was\r\ngoing to ruin themselves in the cause of Christian education.\r\n\r\nThe first idea of "every one" was luncheon, except that Lance laid hands\r\non his unfortunate Angus and Mona for their duet, in the midst of which\r\nLord Rotherwood made a raid on them.\r\n\r\n"There! I\'m sure Prospero never was so cruel as to starve\r\nwhat\'s-his-name! Come in and have some food--it is just by."\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in a dining-room, in the presence of Lady\r\nRotherwood, her son and daughter, and a sprinkling of Merrifields and\r\nactors, in full swing of joyous chatter; Mysie and Lady Phyllis telling\r\nall that was specially to be admired, and Lord Rotherwood teasing them\r\nabout the prices, and their wicked extortions in the name of goodness,\r\nGillian snubbing poor Captain Armytage in his splendid buccaneer\r\ndress, Ivinghoe making himself agreeable to Franceska, whose heightened\r\ncarnation tints made her doubly lovely through her shyness. Gerald and\r\nDolores in the less lively vicinity of the Marchioness carrying on a\r\nlow-toned conversation, which, however, enabled Gerald to sustain nature\r\nwith food better than he had done at breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt did not last long. The sellers had to rush off to relieve those\r\nwho had begun the sale, and the performance was to commence at three\r\no\'clock, so that the final preparations had to be hurried through.\r\n\r\nGeraldine had made the tour of the stalls on the arm of Anna, to admire\r\nthem in their first freshness, and put finishing touches wherever\r\nsolicited. The Rocca Marina conservatories were in rare glory, orchids\r\nin weird beauty, lovely lilies of all hues, fabulously exquisite\r\nipomoeas, all that heart could wish. Before them a fountain played in\r\nthe midst of blue, pink, and white lotus lilies, and in a flower-decked\r\nhouse the Seasons dispensed pot-flowers, bouquets, and button-holes;\r\nthe Miss Simmondses and their friends with simpering graces, that\r\nmade Geraldine glad to escape and leave them to the young men who\r\nwere strolling up. At Carrara was the stall in which she was chiefly\r\ninterested, and which had been arranged with a certain likeness to\r\nItalian gardens, the statues and other devices disposed among flowers;\r\nthe Dirty Boy judiciously veiled by the Puzzle Monkey, and the front\r\nof the summer-house prolonged by pillars, sham but artistic. Jasper was\r\nzealously photographing group after group, handing his performances over\r\nto his assistant for printing off. Kalliope looked in her costume most\r\nbeautiful and dignified. Her sister, grown to almost equal beauty, was\r\nhurrying off to see the masque, flushed and eager, while Gillian and one\r\nor two others were assisting in sales that would be rather slack\r\ntill after the performance. Here Geraldine purchased only a couple\r\nof Mouse-traps, leaving further choice to be made after the stranger\r\npurchasers. Here Sir Jasper and General Mohun came up, and gave her\r\na good deal of curious information about Bernard\'s bevy of figures\r\nin Indian costumes; and having the offer of such a strong arm as the\r\nGeneral\'s, she dispensed with Anna, who was really wanted to help with\r\nthe very popular photographs.\r\n\r\nThey passed the refreshments, at present chiefly haunted by Mrs. Edgar\'s\r\nboys, ready to eat at any time of day; they looked civilly at the Varley\r\nElizabethans, and found Lady Merrifield in the midst of her bothie, made\r\ncharming with fresh green branches and purple heather, imported by the\r\nVanderkists.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Penbeacon ling. I know that red tint in the mauve," said\r\nGeraldine; "I\'ll give you half-a-crown, if your decorations can spare\r\nthat spiring spray!" And she put it in her bosom, after touching it with\r\nher lips. "You have a bower for the Lady of the Lake," she added.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m only Roderick Dhu\'s mother," laughed Lady Merrifield;\r\n"but I shall have more ladies when the masque is done. Now I have only\r\nMysie."\r\n\r\n"And oh!" cried Mysie, "please set up the nurse in the nursery gardens\r\nright. Wilfred knocked her over, and she won\'t stand right for me."\r\n\r\n"Perverse woman. There! No, I shall not buy anything now, I shall\r\nwait for Primrose and the refuse. How pretty it does all look! Ah, Mr.\r\nBrownlow," as she shook hands with the curate.\r\n\r\n"I left my brother John at your house," he said; "I persuaded him to run\r\ndown this morning with my mother and see our doings, and he was glad of\r\nthe opportunity of looking in upon the Vicar."\r\n\r\n"How very kind of him. We were wishing to know what he thought!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt he will be here presently. My mother is at the masque. There\r\nwas not a seat for us, so I took him down to St. Andrew\'s Rock."\r\n\r\n"Not a seat! The five-shilling seats?"\r\n\r\n"Not the fraction of one. Numbers standing outside! Pity there can\'t be\r\na second performance."\r\n\r\n"Four hundred seats! That\'s a hundred pounds! We shall beat the\r\nSchool-board yet!"\r\n\r\nSo, with the General politely expressing that there was no saying what\r\nRockquay owed to the hearty co-operation of such birds of passage as\r\nherself and her brothers, she travelled on to the charity stall, which\r\nMiss Mohun had quaintly dressed in the likeness of an old-fashioned\r\nschool, with big alphabet and samplers, flourished copies, and a stuffed\r\nfigure of a \'cont-rare-y\' naughty boy, with a magnificent fool\'s\r\ncap. She herself sat behind it, the very image of the Shenstone\r\nschool-mistress, with wide white cap, black poke-bonnet, crossed\r\nkerchief, red cloak, and formidable rod; and her myrmidons were\r\nin costume to match. It was very attractive, and took every one by\r\nsurprise, but Geraldine had had enough by this time, and listened\r\nto Miss Mohun\'s invitation and entreaty that she would preside over\r\ntea-cups for the weary, in the drawing-room. The privacy of the houses\r\nhad been secured by ropes extending from the stalls to the rails of the\r\ngarden, and Geraldine was conducted by her two generals to the verandah,\r\nwhere they installed her, and lingered, as was usual with her squires,\r\nalways won by her spirited talk, till messages came to each of them from\r\nbelow that some grandee was come, who must be talked to and entertained.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, Armine Brownlow had brought up his brother, the\r\ndoctor--John or Jock, an old friend--over, first Clement\'s district and\r\nthen his bed.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mrs. Grinstead, I can compliment you much on your brother. He is\r\nvery materially better, and his heart is recovering tone."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad and thankful! I only wish you had seen him last week. He\r\nwas better then, but he had a worry about our little nephew, which threw\r\nhim back."\r\n\r\n"So he told me. The more quiescent and amused you can keep him, the more\r\nchance of a fair recovery there will be. I am glad he thinks of dining\r\nwith the party to-night."\r\n\r\n"I am glad he still thinks. I had to come away early, when he had still\r\nleft it doubtful."\r\n\r\n"I encouraged the idea with all my might."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he will be able to go back to his parish?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly not while every worry tells on him in this manner. You\r\nmust, if possible, take him abroad for the winter, before he begins to\r\nthink about it."\r\n\r\n"He has leave of absence for a year."\r\n\r\n"Dating from Easter, I think. Keep him in warm climates as long as you\r\ncan. Find some country to interest him without over-fatigue, and you\r\nwill, I hope, be able to bring him home fit to consider the matter."\r\n\r\n"That is all you promise?"\r\n\r\n"All I dare--not even to promise--but to let you hope for."\r\n\r\nAn interruption came; one of the young ladies had had her skirt trodden\r\non, and wanted it to be stitched up. Then came Jane Mohun to deposit\r\na handkerchief which some one had dropped. "I can stay a moment," she\r\nsaid; "no one will come to buy till the masque is ended. Oh, this red\r\ncloak will be the death of me!"\r\n\r\n"You look highly respectable without it."\r\n\r\n"I shall only put it on for the coup d\'oeil at first. Oh, Geraldine,\r\nwhat is to be done with that horrid little Maura?"\r\n\r\n"The pretty little Greek girl--Mrs. Henderson\'s sister?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is not Mrs. Henderson\'s fault, nor my sister Ada\'s either,\r\nexcept that the little wretch must have come round her. I know Ada meant\r\nto stay away on that very account."\r\n\r\n"What account?"\r\n\r\n"Ivinghoe\'s, to be sure! Oh! I forgot. You are so much one of us that\r\nI did not remember that you did not know how the foolish boy was\r\nattracted--no, that\'s too strong a word--but she thought he was, when\r\nthey were here to open Rotherwood Park. He did flirt, and Victoria--his\r\nmother, I mean--did not like it at all. She would never have come this\r\ntime, but that I assured her that Maura was safe at Gastein!"\r\n\r\n"Is it so very undesirable?"\r\n\r\n"My dear! Their father was old White\'s brother, a stone-mason. He was\r\nraised from the ranks, but his wife was a Greek peasant--and if you had\r\nseen her, when the Merrifield children called her the Queen of the White\r\nAnts! Ivinghoe is naturally as stiff and formal as his mother, I am not\r\nmuch afraid for him, except that no one knows what that fever will make\r\nof a young man, and I don\'t want him to get his father into a scrape.\r\nThere, I have exhaled it to you, and there is a crowd as if the masque\r\nwas done with."\r\n\r\nIt was, and the four hundred auditors were beginning to throng about the\r\nstalls, strays coming up from time to time, and reporting with absolute\r\nenthusiasm on the music and acting. Marilda was one of these.\r\n\r\n"Well, Cherry, I saw no great harm in it after all, and Francie looked\r\nsweetly pretty, just as poor Alda did when she first came to us. Lance\r\nmust make his own excuses to Alda. But Gerald looked horridly ill!\r\nHe sang very well, but he had such red spots on his cheeks! I\'d get\r\nClement\'s doctor to sound him. Lord Rotherwood was quite complimentary.\r\nNow I must go and buy something--I hear there is the Dirty Boy--I think\r\nI shall get it for Fernan\'s new baths and wash-houses. Then isn\'t there\r\nsomething of yours, Cherry?"\r\n\r\n"Not to compete with the Dirty Boy."\r\n\r\n"Ah! now you are laughing at me, Cherry. Quite right, I am glad to hear\r\nyou do it again."\r\n\r\nThe next visitor was Lance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cherry, how cool you look! Give me a cup of tea--not\r\nrefreshment-stall tea. That\'s right. Little Francie is a perfect\r\ngem--looks and voice--not acting--no time for that. Heigh-ho!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Gerald?"\r\n\r\n"Somewhere about after that Merrifield niece with the doleful name, I\r\nfancy. He did very well when it came to the scratch."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Dr. Brownlow? He has been to see Clement."\r\n\r\n"That\'s first-rate! Where shall I find him?"\r\n\r\n"Somewhere about, according to your lucid direction, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"What does he think of old Tina?"\r\n\r\nGeraldine told him, and was rather surprised, when he whistled as though\r\nperplexed, and as Fergus rushed in, glorious with the news that Sir\r\nFerdinand had bought his collection of specimens for the Bexley museum,\r\nhe rose up, looking perturbed, to find Dr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nNext came Gillian with news that the Dirty Boy was sold to Lady Travis\r\nUnderwood.\r\n\r\n"And mayn\'t I stay a moment or two?" said she. "Now the masque is over,\r\nthat Captain Armytage is besetting me again."\r\n\r\n"Poor Captain Armytage."\r\n\r\n"Why do you pity him? He is going to join his ship, the Sparrow Hawk,\r\nnext week, and that ought to content him."\r\n\r\n"Ships do not always fill a man\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"Then they ought. I don\'t like it," she added, in a petulant tone. "I\r\nhave so much to learn and to do, I don\'t want to be tormented about a\r\ntiresome man."\r\n\r\n"Well, he will be out of your way to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Geraldine, that is a horrid tone."\r\n\r\n"If you choose to put meaning in it, I cannot help it."\r\n\r\n"And that horrid little Maura! She is in the most awful flutter,\r\nstanding on tiptoe, and craning out her foolish little neck. I know it\r\nis all after Ivinghoe, and he never has come to our counter! Kalliope\r\nhas been trying to keep her in order, but I\'m sure the Queen of the\r\nWhite Ants must have been just like that when she got poor Captain White\r\nto marry her. Kalliope is so much vexed, I can see. She never meant to\r\nhave her here. And Aunt Ada stayed away on purpose."\r\n\r\n"Has she seen much of him?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly anything; but he did admire her, and she never was like\r\nKalliope. But what would Aunt Ada do? Oh dear! there\'s that man! He has\r\nno business at Aunt Jane\'s charity stall. I shall go and tell him so."\r\n\r\nGeraldine had her little private laugh before Adrian came up to her with\r\na great ship in his arms--\r\n\r\n"Take care of this, Aunt Cherry. She is going to sail on the Ewe. I\r\nbought her with the sovereign Uncle Fernan gave me."\r\n\r\nGeraldine gave the ship her due admiration, and asked after the masque.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that went off pretty well. I wouldn\'t have been Fely! All the\r\nladies went and said \'Pretty dear!\' when he sang his song about the\r\nbat\'s back. Disgusting! But then he has not been a fellow at school, so\r\nhe made his bow and looked as if he didn\'t mind it."\r\n\r\n"And Francie?"\r\n\r\n"Francie looked perfectly stunning. Everybody said so, and she\r\nsang--well, she sang better than she did at home; but she was in an\r\nawful funk, though I kept on looking at her, and shouting bravo to\r\nencourage her; and she must have heard my voice, for I was just in\r\nfront."\r\n\r\n"I hope she was encouraged."\r\n\r\n"But she is very stupid. I wanted to take her round to all the stalls,\r\nand show her what to buy with the five Jubilee sovereigns Uncle Fernan\r\ngave her, for you know she has never been anywhere, or seen anything. I\r\nthought she would like it, and besides, all our fellows say they never\r\nsaw such an awfully pretty girl, and they can\'t believe all that hair is\r\nher own--she had it all down her back, you know--so I told them I would\r\nlet them have a pull to try."\r\n\r\n"Poor Francie! She declined, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Well, there was that ridiculous swell, Fergus\'s cousin, Ivinghoe, and\r\nhe has taken her off to see the stupid flowers in the conservatory. I\r\ntold Sophy I wondered she permitted such flirting, but of course Francie\r\nknew no better."\r\n\r\n"Oh! and you couldn\'t stop it?"\r\n\r\n"Not I, though I called her over and over again to look at things, but\r\nLord Ivinghoe always hung about and gave one no peace. So I just told\r\nSophy to look after her, and came off to tell you. Oh my! here is old\r\nMiss Mohun coming up. I shall be off. I want some chocolate creams. Mrs.\r\nSimmonds has got some splendid ones."\r\n\r\nMiss Mohun was coming, in fact.\r\n\r\n"Well, Geraldine, the masque was a great success. People beg to have it\r\nrepeated, so many could not get in. And it is worth at least a hundred\r\npounds to us. People whose opinion is worth having were quite struck.\r\nThey say your brother really ought to have been a great composer and\r\nsinger."\r\n\r\n"I think he might have been if he had not given up his real passion to\r\ncome to the help of my dear eldest brother. And he is really happier as\r\nhe is."\r\n\r\n"I knew there was conquest in his face. And that dear little elf of a\r\nboy--what a voice! So bright and so arch too. Then the Miranda--she took\r\nall by surprise. I believe half the spectators took her for the Little\r\nButterfly."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the poor Little Butterfly is flown. There was nothing for it but to\r\nmake Francie act, as she had taken the part once before."\r\n\r\n"Her acting was no great things, they say--ladylike, but frightened. Her\r\nvoice is lovely, and as to her looks--people rave about them. Tell me,\r\nshe is not Lady Travis Underwood\'s daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; she is Anna\'s sister, Adrian\'s sister."\r\n\r\n"So I told Lady Rotherwood, I was sure it was so."\r\n\r\n"The Travis Underwoods have no children, but they adopted Emilia when\r\nI took Anna, and they have brought three Vanderkists to this affair.\r\nFrancie has never been from home before, it is all quite new to her."\r\nThen recollecting what Adrian had repeated, she thought it fair to add,\r\n"My sister was left very badly off, and all these eight girls will have\r\nnothing of their own."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t suppose anything will come of it. I hope it will put no\r\nfolly into her head; but at any rate it effaces that poor silly little\r\nMaura. I hope too, as you say your niece is so innocent, it will do her\r\nno harm."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose any possibilities have occurred to the child."\r\n\r\nLord Rotherwood here came on the scene.\r\n\r\n"Jenny, there\'s an offer for your boy in the fool\'s cap, and Mysie\r\ndoubts if she ought to let him go. Well, Mrs. Grinstead, I think you\r\nhave the best of it. Lookers on, etc."\r\n\r\n"Looking on has always been my trade."\r\n\r\n"You heard the rehearsal of the masque, I believe, but you did not hear\r\nthat charming Mona?"\r\n\r\n"No; she had to take the part suddenly. Her uncle had to tyrannize over\r\nher, to save the whole thing."\r\n\r\n"We are much indebted to him, and to her," said Lord Rotherwood\r\ncourteously. "She looked as if she hated it all in the first scene,\r\nthough she warmed up afterwards. I must say I liked her the better for\r\nher shyness."\r\n\r\n"Her little brother thinks she recovered in consequence of his\r\napplause," said Geraldine, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I saw him. And heard. A little square fellow--very sturdy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Dutchman comes out in him, and he has droll similitudes,\r\nvery curious in one who never saw his father, nor any but his Underwood\r\nrelations."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for him perhaps; I have, and ought to have, great\r\nfaith in uncles\' breeding. I am glad to meet Sir Ferdinand Travis\r\nUnderwood. I have often come across him about London good works."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is an excellent man."\r\n\r\n"Not wholly English is he, judging by the depth of colour in those\r\neyes?"\r\n\r\n"No; his mother was a Mexican, partly Indian. We used to call him the\r\nCacique;" and Geraldine had the pleasure of telling his story to an\r\nearnest listener, but interruption came in the shape of Sir Ferdinand\r\nhimself who announced that he had hired a steam-yacht wherein to view\r\nthe regatta, and begged Lord Rotherwood to join the party.\r\n\r\nThis was impossible, as the Marquis was due at an agricultural dinner at\r\nClarebridge, but in return, in the openness of his heart, he invited the\r\nTravis Underwoods to their dinner that evening at the hotel, where the\r\nMerrifields and the Underwoods were already engaged, little boys and\r\nall.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my lord, but we are too large a party. We have three\r\nVanderkist girls with us, and Anna and her brother are to join them to\r\nbe with their sister."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, never mind. The great hall will have room for all."\r\n\r\nStill Fernan demurred, knowing that Marilda had ordered dinner at the\r\nQuay Hotel, and that even liberal payment would not atone for missing\r\nthe feasting of the millionaires; so the matter was compounded by his\r\npromise to bring all his party, who were not ready for bed, up to spend\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nAnd Geraldine perceived from Lady Rotherwood\'s ceremonious politeness\r\nthat she did not like it at all, though she never said so even to Lady\r\nMerrifield.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was a very bright evening. Gerald had sung himself into\r\nspirits, and then found Dolores, and retreated into the depths of the\r\ngarden with her, explaining to her all about his sister, and declaring\r\nthat his first object must be to rescue her; and then, unless his name\r\nwas cleared, and he had to resume all his obligations, the new life\r\nwould be open to him, and he had no fear of not succeeding as a\r\njournalist, or if not, a musical career was possible to him, as Dolores\r\nhad now the opportunity of fully perceiving. His sweet voice had indeed\r\nfilled her with double enthusiasm. She had her plan for lecturing, and\r\nthat very morning she had received from her father permission to enter\r\na ladies\' college, and the wherewithal. She would qualify herself for\r\nlecturing by the time he had fixed his career; and they built their airy\r\ncastles, not on earth, but on railroads and cycles, and revelled on\r\nthem as happily as is common to lovers, whether in castle or in cottage.\r\nCertainly if the prospect held out to her had been Vale Leston Priory,\r\nit would not have had the same zest; and when in the evening they\r\njoined the dinner-party, there was a wonderful look of purpose and of\r\nbrightness on both their faces. And Emilia, who had been looking for\r\nhim all the afternoon to tell him, "Gerald, I am really going to be a\r\nnurse," only got for answer an absent "Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at St. Roque\'s."\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall never be a patient there," he said, in his half-mocking\r\ntone. "You\'ll look jolly in the cap and apron."\r\n\r\n"I\'m to be there all the time they are in America, and--"\r\n\r\n"Well, I wonder you don\'t go and study the institutions."\r\n\r\n"But, Gerald--"\r\n\r\nHis eye was wandering, and he sprang forward to give Dolores a flower\r\nthat she had dropped.\r\n\r\nLancelot, knowing what was before Gerald, and having always regarded\r\nVale Leston with something of the honours of Paradise, could not\r\nunderstand that joyous look of life, so unlike Gerald\'s usual weary,\r\npassive expression. He himself felt something of the depression that was\r\napt to follow on musical enjoyment; he saw all the failures decidedly\r\nenough not to be gratified with the compliments he met on all sides, and\r\n"he bitterly thought on the morrow," when he saw how Clement was getting\r\nanimated over a discussion on Church matters, and how Geraldine was\r\nenjoying herself. And as to that pretty Franceska, who had blossomed\r\ninto the flower of the flock, he foresaw heart-break for her when\r\nhe watched the Marchioness\'s countenance on hearing that her son had\r\naccepted Sir Ferdinand\'s invitation to cruise to-morrow in the yacht.\r\n\r\nVainly was Ivinghoe reminded of the agricultural dinner. He was only too\r\nglad to escape it, and besides, he thought he could be there in time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the present was delightful, and after dinner the young\r\npeople all went off to the great assembly-room, whence Anna came back to\r\ncoax Uncle Lance to play for them. All the elders jumped up from their\r\nseveral discussions. Even Lady Rotherwood moved on, looking as benign\r\nas her feelings would permit. Jane squeezed Geraldine\'s arm, exceedingly\r\namused. Lance struck up, by request, an old-fashioned country dance;\r\nLord Rotherwood insisted that "Lily" should dance with him, as the\r\nremnant of forty good years ago or more, and with Sir Roger de Coverley\r\nthe day ended.\r\n\r\nPoor little Maura, making an excuse to wander about the gardens in the\r\nmoonlight, saw the golden locks shining through the open windows, and\r\nLord Ivinghoe standing over them, went home, and cried herself to sleep\r\nover the fickleness of the nobility, when she had better have cried over\r\nher own unjustified romance, excited by a few kindly speeches and a cup\r\nof tea.\r\n\r\nAnd Emilia! What was Gerald\'s one laughing turn with her, compared with\r\nhis long talk with Dolores in the moonlight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. -- THE REGATTA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     She saw a forget-me-not in the grass,\r\n     Gilly-flower, gentle rosemary,\r\n     Ah! why did the lady that little flower pass,\r\n     While the dews fell over the mulberry-tree?\r\n                                            KENEALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch of the party as were not wanted for the second day of the bazaar,\r\nand were not afraid of mal de mer, had accepted the yachting invitation,\r\nexcept the three elders at St. Andrew\'s Rock. Even Adrian and Felix\r\nwere suffered to go, under Sophy\'s charge, on the promise to go nowhere\r\nwithout express permission, and not to be troublesome to any one.\r\n\r\n"Sophy can say, \'Now, boys,\' as effectively as Wilmet," said Geraldine,\r\nwhen she met Lance, who had been to the quay to see them off.\r\n\r\n"She did not say so to much advantage with her own boys," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"We weren\'t Harewoods," returned Lance, "and John never could bear to\r\nsee a tight hand over them; but there\'s good in them that will come out\r\nsome day."\r\n\r\nClement gave an emphatic "Humph!" as he sat down to the second breakfast\r\nafter Anna had gone to the cliff to resume her toils.\r\n\r\n"Who are gone?" asked Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Poor Marilda, smilingly declaring she shall be in misery in the cabin\r\nall the time, Fernan, and four Vanderkists, General Mohun, Sir Jasper,\r\nand some of his progeny; but others stay to help Miss Mohun finish up\r\nthe sales."\r\n\r\n"Does Lord Ivinghoe go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, he came rushing down just in time. Francie was looking like a\r\nmorning rose off the cloister at Vale Leston."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry they have another day of it. I don\'t see how it can come to\r\ngood," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps her roses may fade at sea," said Clement, "and disenchantment\r\nmay ensue."\r\n\r\n"At least I hope Alda may not hear of it, or she will be in an agony of\r\nexpectation as long as hope lasts. Gerald is gone, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" said Lance, who had had a farewell from him with the words,\r\n"Get it over while I am out of the way, and tell them I don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nCursory and incomprehensible, but conclusive; and Lance, who minded\r\nenough to have lost sleep and gained a headache, marvelled over young\r\nmen\'s lightness and buoyancy. He had seen Dr. Brownlow, and arranged\r\nthat there should be a call, as a friend, in due time after the\r\ncommunication, in case it should hurt Clement, and when Geraldine\r\nobserved merrily that now they were quit of all the young ones they\r\ncould feel like old times, he was quite grieved to disturb her pleasure.\r\n\r\nClement, however, began by taking out a letter and saying--\r\n\r\n"Here is a remarkable missive left for me yesterday--\'If the Rev.\r\nUnderwood wishes to hear of something to his advantage, he should\r\ncommunicate with Mr. O\'L., care of Mr. John Bast, van proprietor,\r\nWhitechapel.\' An impostor?" said he.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not," said Lance. "Clement, I fear there is no doubt that\r\nshe is that singing Hungarian woman who was the ruin of Edgar\'s life."\r\n\r\n"Gerald\'s mother!" exclaimed Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Even so."\r\n\r\n"But she is gone! She gave up all rights. She can\'t claim anything. Has\r\nshe worried him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, poor boy! She has declared that she had actually a living husband\r\nat the time she married our poor Edgar."\r\n\r\nOf course both broke out into exclamations that it was impossible,\r\nand Lance had to tell them of his interview with the woman at Gerald\'s\r\nentreaty. They were neither of them so overcome by the disclosure as he\r\nhad feared during his long delay.\r\n\r\n"I believe it is only an attempt at extortion," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"Very cruel," said Geraldine. "How--how did my poor boy bear it all this\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"He was very much knocked down at first, quite overwhelmed, but less by\r\nthe loss than by the shame, and the imputation on his father."\r\n\r\n"It was no fault of dear Edgar\'s."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I am glad Fernan is here to go over again what Edgar told\r\nhim. We may be quite satisfied so far."\r\n\r\n"And is it needful to take it up?" asked Geraldine wistfully. "If we\r\ndon\'t believe it, the horrid story would get quashed."\r\n\r\n"No, Cherry," said Clement. "If you think it over you will see that we\r\nmust investigate. I should be relieved indeed to let it alone, but it\r\nwould not be fair towards Lance there and his boys."\r\n\r\nLance made a strange noise of horror and deprecation, then added--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe Gerald would consent to let it alone."\r\n\r\n"No, now he knows, of course. He is a right-minded, generous boy," said\r\nGeraldine. "I was wrong. Did you say he was very much upset?"\r\n\r\n"Just at first, when he came to me at night. I was obliged to dragoon\r\nhim, and myself too, to throw it off enough to be able to get through\r\nour performance yesterday. How thankful I am to the regatta that it is\r\nnot our duty to the country to go through it again to-day! However, he\r\nseems to have rebounded a good deal. He was about all the latter part of\r\nthe day with Miss Mohun."\r\n\r\n"I saw him dancing and laughing with some of them."\r\n\r\n"And he parted from me very cheerfully, telling me to assure you \'he did\r\nnot mind,\' whatever that may mean."\r\n\r\n"He knows that nothing can disturb our love for him, Edgar\'s little\r\ncomfort, passed on to bear us up," said Cherry tearfully. "Oh yes, I\r\nknow what he meant--Felix\'s delight, my darling always."\r\n\r\n"It strikes me," said Lance, "that if he can save his sister--"\r\n\r\nGeraldine started.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the cigar-girl! Only by that mother\'s side."\r\n\r\n"That is true, but she is his half-sister, and he is evidently much\r\ndrawn towards her. She is a nice little thing, and I believe he\r\nmade much of her on the rehearsal day. I saw they got on much better\r\ntogether, and I think she was aware of the relationship."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is quite right of him," said Geraldine, "but she will be a\r\ndrag on him all his life. Now what ought we to do? Shall you answer this\r\nletter to the care of the van-man, Clem?"\r\n\r\n"I shall think, and wait till I have seen Gerald and Travis. This letter\r\nis evidently written simply in the hope of raising money from me, not in\r\nany friendly spirit."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Lance. "Having failed to black-mail Gerald, and\r\ndiscovered that you are the heir, they begin on you, but not from any\r\ngratitude to you. Sweetie Bob, as they call the ex-errand-boy, gives a\r\nfine account of their denunciations of the tall parson who brought the\r\nbobbies down on them."\r\n\r\nLance felt much reassured by Clement\'s tone, and all the more when he\r\nhad seen Dr. Brownlow, who made a thorough examination, and came to the\r\nconclusion that Clement had recovered tone, so that the shock, whatever\r\nit was, that his brother dreaded had done no present damage, but that he\r\nwas by no means fit for any strain of work or exertion, should be kept\r\nfrom anxiety as much as possible, and had better spend the winter in a\r\nwarm climate. It was not likely--Jock Brownlow said it with grief\r\nand pain--that he would ever be able to return to the charge of St.\r\nMatthew\'s, but as he had a year\'s holiday, there was no need to enter on\r\nthat subject yet, and in a quiet country place, with a curate, he might\r\nlive to the age of man in tolerable health if he took care of himself,\r\nor his sister took care of him for some time to come.\r\n\r\nSo much relieved was Lance that he recollected that he had laid in no\r\nstock of presents for those at home, and went up to profit by the second\r\nday\'s reductions, when he secured Geraldine\'s portrait of Davy Blake\r\nfor his wife, and a statuette of St. Cecilia for Dr. May, some charming\r\nwater-colours for Robina and Ethel, besides various lesser delights for\r\nthe small fry, his own and the flock at Vale Leston, besides a cushion\r\nfor Alda\'s sofa. John Inglesant had been bought by a connoisseur by\r\nspecial commission. He heard at every stall triumphant accounts of the\r\ngrand outlay of the Travis Underwoods and Rotherwoods, and just the\r\ncontrary of Mrs. Pettifer, whom he encountered going about in search of\r\nbargains, and heard haggling for a handsome table-cover, because it was\r\nquite aesthetic, and would not do except in a large house, so of course\r\nit had not sold.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse-traps had been a great success, and there were very few left\r\nof them. They really owed as much to Lance as did the play, for he had\r\nnot only printed them at as small a cost as possible, but had edited,\r\npruned, and got them into shape more than any of the young lady authors\r\nsuspected. The interpretation of handwriting had likewise succeeded in\r\nobtaining many clients, and a large pile of silver coins. Anna, who was\r\nhovering near, was delighted to show him that her sister Sophy\'s\r\nwriting had been declared to indicate homely tastes, an affectionate\r\ndisposition, great perspicuity of perception, much force of character;\r\nand Franceska\'s, scarcely yet formed, showed that she was affectionate,\r\nromantic, and, of all things in the world, fond of horses and of\r\nboating. Emilia\'s was held as a great blunder, for she was said to\r\nhave an eye devoted to temporal advantages, also volatile, yet of great\r\ndetermination, triumphing over every obstacle, and in much danger of\r\nself-deception.\r\n\r\n"The triumph at least is true," said Anna, "now she has her way about\r\nthe nursing."\r\n\r\n"Has she? I did not know it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is to try it for a year, while Cousins Fernan and Marilda go\r\nout to their farm in the Rocky Mountains."\r\n\r\nJust then there was a little commotion, and a report came up that a boat\r\nhad been run down and some one drowned. Somebody said, "One of those\r\nacting last night--a buccaneer." Somebody else, "A naval man." Then it\r\nwas "The Buccaneer Captain," and Mrs. Pettifer was exclaiming, "Poor\r\nCaptain Armytage! He was in our theatricals, I remember, but they\r\nthought him rather high. But he was a fine young man! Poor Captain\r\nArmytage!"\r\n\r\nLance had sufficient interests in those at sea to be anxious, and turned\r\nhis steps to the gates to ascertain the facts, when he was overtaken by\r\nGillian, with a hat hastily thrown over her snooded hair and Highland\r\ngarb, hurrying along, and looking very white.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood! Oh! did you hear who it was?"\r\n\r\n"No certainty. I was going down to find out. You," as he saw her\r\npurpose, "had better not come. There will be a great crowd. I will come\r\nback and tell you."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I must. This is the short way."\r\n\r\nHer hands trembled so that she could hardly undo the private fastening\r\nof Miss Mohun\'s garden, and she began to dash down the cliff steps. Just\r\nat the turn, where the stair-way was narrowest, Lance heard her exclaim,\r\nand saw that she had met face to face no other than Captain Armytage\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Oh! is it?" and she so tottered on the rocky step that the hand he had\r\nput out in greeting became a support, and a tender one, as Lance said\r\n(perhaps with a little _malice_)--\r\n\r\n"We heard that the Buccaneer Captain had come to grief."\r\n\r\n"I?" he laughed; and Gillian shook herself up, asking--\r\n\r\n"Weren\'t you run down?" seeing even as she spoke that not a drop of wet\r\nwas traceable.\r\n\r\n"Me! What! did you think I was going to peril my life in a \'longshore\r\nconcern like this?" said he, with a merry laugh, betraying infinite\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"But did nothing happen? Nobody drowned?" she asked, half disappointed.\r\n\r\n"Not a mouse! A little chap, one of the fairies yesterday, tumbled off\r\nthe sea-wall where he had no business to be, but he swam like a cork. We\r\nthrew him a rope and hauled him up."\r\n\r\nWherewith he gave his arm to Gillian, who was still trembling, and\r\nclasped it so warmly that Lance thought it expedient to pass them as\r\nsoon as possible and continue his journey on the staircase, giving a low\r\nwhistle of amusement, and pausing to look out on the beautiful blue\r\nbay, crowded with the white sails of yachts and pleasure-boats, with\r\nbrilliant festoons of little flags, and here and there the feather of\r\nsteam from a launch. He could look, for he was feeling lighter of heart\r\nnow that the communication was over.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lance would have been edified could he have heard the colloquy--\r\n\r\n"Gillian! you do care for me after all?"\r\n\r\nGillian tried to take her arm away and to say, "Common humanity," but\r\nshe did not get the words out.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he said. "Confess that if it had been that fisher-boy, you\r\nwould not be here now!" and he kept tight the arm that she was going to\r\ntake away. Her face was in a flame.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; and if--if it wasn\'t, you need not make such a fuss about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Not when it is the first ray of hope you have afforded me, for the only\r\njoy of my life?"\r\n\r\n"I never meant to afford--"\r\n\r\n"But you could not help."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t! I never meant it. Oh dear! I never meant to be worried about\r\ntroublesome things like this till I had got older, and learnt a\r\ngreat deal more; and now you want to upset it all. It is very--very\r\ndisagreeable."\r\n\r\n"But you need not be upset!" poor Ernley Armytage pleaded. "Remember, I\r\nam going away for three years. May I not take hope with me?"\r\n\r\nGillian paused.\r\n\r\n"Well," again she said, "I do like you--I mean, I don\'t mind you as much\r\nas most people; you have done something, and you have some sense."\r\n\r\nHis look of rapture at these very moderate words quite overpowered her,\r\nand the tears welled up into her eyes, while she made a sudden change of\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"There, there--of course it is all right. I\'m a nasty creature, and if\r\nyou like me, it is more than I deserve, only, whatever you do, don\'t\r\nmake me cry. I\'ve got all the horrid dolls and pen-wipers, and bags and\r\nrags to get rid of."\r\n\r\n"May I talk to your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, if you can catch her. She will be ever so much more good to you\r\nthan I; and I only hope she will warn you what a Tartar I am."\r\n\r\nWherewith Gillian threw off her hat, swung open the gate, and dashed\r\nlike a hunted hare up to her mother\'s stall, where in truth she had been\r\nwanted, since only two helpers had remained to assist in the cheapening\r\nand final disposal of the remnants. Lady Merrifield read something in\r\nthose wild eyes and cheeks burning, but the exigencies of the moment\r\nobliged her to hold her peace, and apply herself to estimating the\r\nhalf-price of the cushions and table-cloths she rejoiced to see\r\ndeparting, as well as to preserve wits enough not to let Gillian sell\r\nthe Indian screen for two shillings and sixpence, under the impression\r\nthat this was the half of five pounds. Mysie was the only one who kept\r\nher senses fairly undisturbed, and could balance between her duty to the\r\nschools and her desire to gratify a child, happy in that she never saw\r\nmore than one thing at a time. Valetta and Primrose were yachting, so\r\nthat the distraction was less, and Captain Armytage lingered round,\r\ntaking messages, and looking in wistful earnestness for some one to\r\nbe disengaged. Yet there was something in his eyes that spoke of the\r\ncalmness of an attained object, and Miss Mohun, who had sold off all\r\nher remaining frocks and pinafores at a valuation to Marilda for some\r\ninstitution, and was free to help her sister, saw in a moment that his\r\nmind was settled.\r\n\r\nYet speech was scarcely possible till the clearance was finally\r\neffected by a Dutch auction, when Captain Armytage distinguished himself\r\nunexpectedly as auctioneer, and made an end even of the last sachet,\r\nthough it smelt so strongly of lip-salve that he declared that a bearer\r\nmust be paid to take it away. But the purchaser was a big sailor, who\r\nevidently thought it an elegant gift for his sweetheart.\r\n\r\nBy the time it was gone the yachters had come home. Captain Armytage\r\nseized on Sir Jasper, who already know his purpose, and wished him\r\nsuccess, though withheld from saying a word to urge the suit by Lady\r\nMerrifield\'s assurances, that to hurry Gillian\'s decision would be fatal\r\nto success, and that a reproof for petulance would be worse. She did\r\nnot know whether to wish for the engagement or not; Gillian was her very\r\ndear and sufficient companion, more completely so than Mysie, who was\r\nfar less clever; and she had sometimes doubted whether common domestic\r\nlife beginning early was for the girl\'s happiness and full development;\r\nbut she knew that her husband would scout these doubts as nonsense, and\r\nboth really liked Ernley Armytage, and had heard nothing but what was\r\nto his advantage in every way, when they had been in his own county,\r\nand had seen his neighbours and his family. However, she could only keep\r\nquiet, and let her heart rise in a continual aspiration at every silent\r\nmoment for her child\'s guidance.\r\n\r\nBefore she had had her moment of speech with either, she heard her\r\nhusband calling Gillian, and she knew that he was the one person with\r\nwhom his daughter never hid her true self in petulance or sarcasm. So\r\nGillian met him in the General\'s sitting-room, gasping as she turned the\r\nhandle of the door. He set a chair for her, and spoke gravely.\r\n\r\n"My dear," he said, "I find you have gained the heart of a good man."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I never meant it," half whispered Gillian.\r\n\r\n"What is that--you never meant it? I never supposed you capable of such\r\nan unladylike design. You mean that you were taken by surprise?"\r\n\r\n"No; I did see what he was at," and she hung her head.\r\n\r\n"You guessed his intentions?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; but I didn\'t want--"\r\n\r\n"Try to explain yourself," said Sir Jasper as she broke off.\r\n\r\n"I--I did wish to go on improving myself and being useful. Surely it was\r\nnot wrong, papa. Don\'t you see, I did not want to let myself be\r\nworried into letting myself go out, and spoiling all my happiness and\r\nimprovement and work, and getting to care for somebody else?"\r\n\r\n"But you have consented."\r\n\r\n"Well, when I was frightened for him I found I did care, and he got hold\r\nof me, and made me allow that I did; and now I suppose nobody will give\r\nme any peace."\r\n\r\n"Stay, Gillian--keep yourself from this impatient mood. I think I\r\nunderstand your unwillingness to overthrow old associations and admit a\r\nnew overmastering feeling."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, papa," said Gillian, looking up. "I can\'t bear that\r\novermastering feeling, nor the being told every one must come to it. It\r\nseems such folly."\r\n\r\n"Folly that Eve was given to be a helpmeet, and as the bride, the Church\r\nto her Bridegroom? Look high enough, Gillian, and the popular chatter\r\nwill not confuse your mind. You own that you really love him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, not half so much as mamma, or Mysie, or Jasper, but--but I\r\nthink I might."\r\n\r\n"Is that all, Gillian? No one would coerce you. Shall I send him away,\r\nand tell him not to think of it? Remember, it is a serious thing--nay,\r\nan unworthy thing to trifle with a right-minded man."\r\n\r\nGillian sat clasping the elbow of her chair, her dark eyes fixed. At\r\nlast she said--\r\n\r\n"Papa, I do feel a sort of trust in him, a sort of feeling as if my life\r\nand all goodness and all that would be safe with him; and I couldn\'t\r\nbear him to go quite away and hear no more of him, only I do wish it\r\nwouldn\'t happen now; and if there is a fuss about it, I shall get cross\r\nand savage, and be as nasty as possible, I know I shall."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t exercise enough self-command to remember what is due--I would\r\nsay kind and considerate--to a man who has loved you through all your\r\npetulance and discouragement, and now is going to a life not without\r\nperil for three years? Suppose a mishap, Gillian--how would you feel as\r\nto your treatment of him on this last evening?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa! if you talk in that way I must, I must," and she burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nSir Jasper bent over her and gave her a kiss--a kiss that from him was\r\nsomething to remember. It was late, and summonses to a hurried meal were\r\nringing through Beechcroft Cottage, where the Clipstone party waited to\r\nsee the illuminations.\r\n\r\nTalk was eager between the sellers and the sailors as Valetta described\r\nthe two parties, the fate of the Indian screen, and the misconduct of\r\nCockneys in their launches were discussed by many a voice, but Gillian\r\nwas unwontedly silent. Her mother had no time for more than a kiss\r\nbefore the shouts of Wilfred, Fergus, and Primrose warned them that the\r\nilluminations were beginning. She could only catch Mysie, and beg her\r\nto keep the younger ones away from Gillian and the Captain. Mysie opened\r\nher brown eyes wide and said--\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Then, "Is it really?"\r\n\r\n"Really, my dear, and remember that it is his last evening!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mysie again. "I never thought it of Gill! May I tell\r\nValetta?"\r\n\r\n"Better not, my dear, if it can be helped."\r\n\r\nA screaming for Gill was heard, and Mysie hastened to answer it. Lady\r\nMerrifield was too much tired to do anything but sit in the garden\r\nwith Miss Mohun and look out at the ships, glittering with festoons of\r\ncoloured lamps, reflected in the sea, but the young people went further\r\nafield, out on the cliff path to Rotherwood Park. The populace were\r\nmainly collected on the quay, and this formed a more select promenade,\r\nthough by no means absolute solitude. Sir Jasper really did keep guard\r\nover the path along which Gillian allowed her Captain to conduct her,\r\nnot exactly knowing which way they were going, and quite away from the\r\nbay and all its attractions.\r\n\r\nShe heard him out without any of the sharp, impatient answers in which\r\nher maiden coyness was wont to disguise itself, as he told her of his\r\nhopes and plans for the time when his three years of the Mediterranean\r\nshould be over.\r\n\r\n"And you see you can go on studying all the time, if you must be so\r\nclever."\r\n\r\n"I think one ought to make the most of oneself, just as you want to rise\r\nin your profession! No, indeed, I could not bear you if you wanted me to\r\nsit down and idle, or to dawdle yourself."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t grow too clever for me."\r\n\r\n"Mother always says that a real man has stuff in him that is quite\r\ndifferent from cleverness, and yet I could not bear to give that up. I\r\nam so glad you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"Mind! I mind nothing but to know you are caring for me. And you will\r\nwrite to me?"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t know what to say. You will tell of volcanoes, and Athens, and\r\nConstantinople, and Egypt, and the Holy Land, and I shall have nothing\r\nto say but who lectures in college."\r\n\r\n"Little you know what that will be to me."\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sensation all the time to Gillian, with a dawning sense\r\nthat was hardly yet love--she was afraid of that--but of something\r\ngood and brave and worthy that had become hers. She had felt something\r\nanalogous when the big deer-hound at Stokesley came and put his head\r\nupon her lap. But the hound showed himself grateful for caresses, and so\r\ndid her present giant when the road grew rough, and she let him draw her\r\narm into his and talk to her.\r\n\r\nIt was the parting, for he had to go to London and to his own family the\r\nnext day early. Gillian spoke not a word all through the dark drive to\r\nClipstone, but when the party emerged into the light her eyes were full\r\nof tears. Lady Merrifield followed her to her room, and her words half\r\nchoked were--\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I never knew what a great, solemn, holy thing _it_ is. Will you\r\nlook me out a prayer to help me to get worthy?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. -- ILLUMINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'Twas in the summer-time so sweet,\r\n        When hearts and flowers are both in season,\r\n      That who, of all the world should meet,\r\n        In "twilight eve," but Love and Reason.\r\n                                         T. MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat moon and sparkling lights did not shine alone for Gerald and\r\nDolores. There were multitudes on the cliffs and the beach, and Sir\r\nFerdinand and Lady Travis Underwood with their party had come to an\r\nirregular sort of dinner-supper at St. Andrew\'s Rock. With them, or\r\nrather before them, came Mr. Bramshaw, the engineer, who sent in\r\nhis card to Mr. Clement Underwood, and entered with a leathern bag,\r\nbetraying the designs on Penbeacon.\r\n\r\nNot that these were more than an introduction. Indeed, under the present\r\ncircumstances, a definite answer was impossible; but there was another\r\nquestion, namely, that which regarded Sophia Vanderkist. She had indeed\r\nlong been of age, but of course her suitor could not but look to her\r\nformer guardian for consent and influence. He was a very bearded man,\r\npleasant-spoken and gentlemanlike, and Lancelot had prepared his brother\r\nby saying that he knew all about the family, and they were highly\r\nrespectable solicitors at Minsterham, one son a master in the school at\r\nStoneborough. So Clement listened favourably, liked the young man, and\r\nthough his fortunes at present depended on his work, and Lady Vanderkist\r\nwas no friend to his suit, gave him fair encouragement, and invited him\r\nto join the meal, though the party was already likely to be too numerous\r\nfor the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThat mattered the less when all the young and noisy ones could be\r\nplaced, to their great delight, under the verandah outside, where they\r\ncould talk and laugh to their utmost content, without incommoding Uncle\r\nClement, or being awed by Cousin Fernan\'s black beard and Cacique-like\r\ngravity. How they discussed and made fun over the humours of the bazaar;\r\nnor was Gerald\'s wit the slackest, nor his mirth the most lagging. He\r\nwas very far from depressed now that the first shock was over. He knew\r\nhimself to be as much loved or better than ever by those whose affection\r\nhe valued, and he was sure of Dolores\' heart as he had never yet been.\r\nThe latent Bohemianism in his nature woke with the prospect of having\r\nhis own way to make, and being free from the responsibilities of an\r\nestate, and his chivalry was excited by the pleasure of protecting his\r\nlittle half-sister, in pursuit of whom he intended to go.\r\n\r\nSo, light-hearted enough to amaze the elders who knew the secret, he\r\njumped up to go with the rest of the party to the cliff walk, where the\r\nbrilliant ships could best be seen. Lance, though his headache was,\r\nas Geraldine said, visible on his brow, declared that night air and\r\nsea-breeze were the best remedy, and went in charge of the two boys,\r\nlest his dainty Ariel should make an excursion over the rocks; and the\r\nfour young ladies were escorted by Gerald and the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe elders were much too tired for further adventures, and Geraldine\r\nand Marilda were too intimate to feel bound to talk. Only a few words\r\ndropped now and then about Emilia and her hospital, where she was to\r\nbe left for a year, while Fernan with Marilda visited his American\r\nestablishments, and on their return would decide whether she would\r\nreturn, or whether they would take Franceska, or a younger one, in her\r\nstead. The desertion put Marilda out of heart, and she sighed what a\r\npity it was that the girl would not listen to young Brown.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Clement was making Ferdinand go over with him Edgar\'s words\r\nabout his marriage. They had all been written down immediately after his\r\ndeath, and had been given to Felix with the certificates of the marriage\r\nand birth and of the divorce, and they were now no doubt with other\r\ndocuments and deeds in the strong-box at Vale Leston Priory. Fernan\r\ncould only repeat the words which had been burnt in on his memory,\r\nand promise to hunt up the evidence of the form and manner of the\r\ndissolution of the marriage at Chicago. Like Clement himself, he\r\nvery much doubted whether the allegation would not break down in some\r\nimportant point, but he wished Gerald to be assured that if the worst\r\ncame to the worst, he would never be left destitute, since that\r\nfirst meeting--the baptism, and the receiving him from the dying\r\nfather--amounted to an adoption sacred in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen, seeing how worn-out Clement looked, he abetted Sibby and\r\nGeraldine, in shutting their patient safe up in his bedroom, not to be\r\n"mislested" any more that night, said Sibby. So he missed the rush of\r\nthe return. First came the two sober sisters, Anna and Emilia, only\r\nsorry that Aunt Cherry had not seen the lovely sea, the exquisite\r\ntwinkle of silvered waves as the moon rose, and then the outburst of\r\ncoloured lights, taking many forms, and the brilliant fireworks darting\r\nto and fro, describing curves, bursting and scattering their sparks.\r\nEmilia had, however, begun by the anxious question--\r\n\r\n"Nan, what is it with Gerald?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite know. I suspect Dolores has somehow teased him, though it\r\nis not like her."\r\n\r\n"Then there is something in it?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help believing so, but I don\'t believe it has come to\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"And is she not a most disagreeable girl! Those black eyebrows do look\r\nso sullen and thunderous."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Emmie, I thought so at first, but she can\'t help her eyebrows;\r\nand when you come to know her there is a vast deal in her--thought, and\r\noriginality, and purpose. I am sure it has been good for Gerald. He has\r\nseemed more definite and in earnest lately, less as if he were playing\r\nwith everything, with all views all round."\r\n\r\n"But his spirits are so odd!--so merry and then so grave."\r\n\r\n"That is only during these last few days, and I fancy there must be some\r\nhitch--perhaps about Dolores\' father, and we are all in such haste."\r\n\r\nEmilia did not pursue the subject. She had never indulged in the folly\r\nof expecting any signs of actual love from her cousin. She had always\r\nknown that the family regarded any closer bond as impossible; but she\r\nhad been always used to be his chief confidante, and she missed his\r\nattention, but she would not own this even to herself, go she talked\r\nof her hospital schemes with much zest, and how she should spend her\r\noutings at a favourite sisterhood.\r\n\r\n"For," said she, "I am tired of luxury."\r\n\r\nIt had been a delightful walk to Anna, with her companion sister,\r\ndiscussing Adrian, or Emily\'s plans, or Sophy\'s prospects. They had come\r\nhome the sooner, for Emily had to pack, as she was to spend a little\r\nwhile with her mother at Vale Leston. Where was Franceska? They were\r\nsomewhat dismayed not to find her, but it was one of the nights when\r\neverybody loses everybody, and no doubt she was with Uncle Lance, or\r\nwith Sophy, or Gerald.\r\n\r\nNo such thing. Here was Uncle Lance with his two boys in varying kinds\r\nof delight, Adrian pronouncing that "it was very jolly, the most ripping\r\nsight he ever saw," then eating voraciously, with his eyes half shut,\r\nand tumbling off to bed "like a veritable Dutchman," said Lance, who\r\nhad his own son in a very different mood, with glowing cheeks, sparkling\r\neyes, appetite gone for very excitement, as he sprang about and waved\r\nhis hands to describe the beautiful course of the rockets, and the fall\r\nof the stars from the Roman candles.\r\n\r\n"Oh, such as I never--never saw! How shall I get Pearl and Audrey to get\r\neven a notion of it? Grandpapa will guess in a moment! Oh, and the sea,\r\nall shine with a path of--of glory! Oh, daddy, there are things more\r\nbeautiful than anybody could ever dream of!"\r\n\r\n"Go and dream then, my sprite. Try to be as still as you can, even if\r\nyou do go on feeling the yacht, and seeing the sparks when you shut your\r\neyes. For you see my head is bad, and I do want a chance of sleep."\r\n\r\n"Poor daddy! I\'ll try, even if the music goes on in my head.\r\nGood-night."\r\n\r\n"That will keep him quieter than anything," said Lance; "but I would not\r\ngive much for the chance of his not seeing the dawn."\r\n\r\n"Or you either, I fear," said Geraldine. "Have you slept since the\r\ndiscovery?"\r\n\r\n"I shall make my sleep up at home, now I have had the whole out. Who\r\ncomes now?"\r\n\r\nIt was Sophy, with her look of\r\n\r\n\r\n          "Gentle wishes long subdued,\r\n           Subdued and cherished long."\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bramshaw had brought her to the door, and no doubt she and he had\r\nhad a quiet, restful time of patient planning; but the not finding\r\nFrancie soon filled her with great alarm and self-reproach for having\r\nlet herself be drawn away from the party, when all had stood together\r\non Miss Mohun\'s lawn. She wanted to start off at once in search of her\r\nsister, and was hardly pacified by finding that Gerald was still to\r\ncome. Then, however, Gerald did come, and alone. He said he had just\r\nseen the Clipstone party off. No, he had not seen Francie there; but he\r\nadded, rather as if recovering from a bewilderment, as Sophy was asking\r\nhim to come out with her again, "Oh, never fear. Lord Ivinghoe was there\r\nsomewhere!"\r\n\r\n"I thought he was gone."\r\n\r\n"No, he said the yacht got in too late for the train. Never mind, Sophy,\r\ndepend upon it she is all right."\r\n\r\nNone of the ladies present felt equally pleased, but in a minute or two\r\nmore in came a creature, bright, lovely, and flushed, with two starry\r\neyes, gleaming like the blue lights on the ships.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cousin Marilda, have I kept you waiting? I am so sorry!"\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?"\r\n\r\n"Only on the cliff walk. Lord Ivinghoe took me to see the place where\r\nhis father had the accident, and we watched the fireworks from there.\r\nOh, it was so nice, and still more beautiful when the strange lights\r\nwere out and the people gone, and only the lovely quiet moon shining on\r\nthe sea, and a path of light from Venus."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," muttered Gerald, and Marilda began--\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, miss."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to bo so late," began Francie, and Geraldine caught an\r\nopportunity while shawling Marilda to say--\r\n\r\n"Dear, good Marilda, I implore you to say nothing to put it into her\r\nhead or Alda\'s. I don\'t think any harm is done yet, but it can\'t be\r\nanything. It can\'t come to good, and it would only be unhappiness to\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! well, I\'ll try. But what a chance it would be, and how happy it\r\nwould make poor Alda!"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be. The boy\'s mother would never let him look at her! Don\'t,\r\ndon\'t, don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll try not." She kissed her fondly.\r\n\r\nGerald\'s walk had been with Dolores of course, a quiet, grave, earnest\r\ntalk and walk, making them feel how much they belonged to one another,\r\nand building schemes in which they were to learn the nature of the poor\r\nand hard-worked, by veritably belonging to them, and being thus able\r\nto be of real benefit. In truth, neither of them, in their brave\r\nyouthfulness, really regretted Vale Leston, and the responsibilities;\r\nand, as Gerald declared, he would give it up tomorrow gladly if he could\r\nsave his name and his father\'s from shame, but, alas! the things went\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDolores wished to write fully to her father, and that Gerald should\r\ndo the same, but she did not wish to have the matter discussed in\r\nthe family at once, before his answer came, and Gerald had agreed to\r\nsilence, as indeed they would not call themselves engaged till that\r\ntime. Indeed, Dolores said there was so much excitement about Captain\r\nArmytage that no one was thinking of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. -- COUNSELS OF PATIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     He either fears his fate too much,\r\n       Or his deserts are small,\r\n     Who fears to put it to the touch,\r\n       To win or lose it all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Sibby hoped to keep her "long boy" from being "mislested," she was\r\nmistaken. He knew too well what was to come, and when she knocked at\r\nhis door with his cup of tea, he came to it half dressed, to her extreme\r\nindignation, calling for his shaving water.\r\n\r\n"Now, Master Clem, if you would only be insinsed enough to keep to your\r\nbed, you might have Miss Sophy to speak to you there, if nothing else\r\nwill serve you."\r\n\r\n"Is she there?"\r\n\r\n"In coorse, and Miss Francie too. What should they do else, after\r\ncolloguing with their young men all night? Ah, \'tis a proud woman poor\r\nMiss Alda would be if she could have seen the young lord! And the real\r\nbeauty is Miss Francie, such as my own babbies were before her, bless\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Stop," cried Clement in consternation. "It is only a bit of passing\r\nadmiration. Don\'t say a word about it to the others."\r\n\r\n"As if I would demane myself to the like of them! Me that has been\r\nforty-seven years with you and yours, and had every one of you in my\r\narms the first thing, except the blessed eldest that is gone to a better\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Would that he were here now!" sighed Clement, almost as he had sighed\r\nthat first morning of his loss. "Where are those girls?"\r\n\r\n"Rampaging over the house with Sir Adrian, and his packing of all his\r\nrubbish, enough to break the heart of a coal-heaver! I\'d not let them in\r\nto bother their aunt, and Mr. Gerald is asleep like a blessed baby."\r\n\r\n"And Lance?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is down to the sea he is with that child that looks as if he\r\nwas made of air, and lived on live larks! And Master Lance, he\'s no\r\nbetter--eats like a sparrow, and sits up half the night writing for his\r\npaper."\r\n\r\nClement got rid of Sibby at last, but he was hardly out of his room\r\nbefore Sophy descended on him, anxious and blushing, though he could\r\ngive her much sympathy and kindly hope of his influence, only he had\r\nto preach patience. It had been no hasty fancy, but there had long been\r\ngrowing esteem and affection, and he could assure her of all the aid\r\nthe family could give with her mother, though Penbeacon works would be a\r\nvery insecure foundation for hope.\r\n\r\n"I think Gerald would consent," said Sophy, "and he will soon be of\r\nage."\r\n\r\nClement could only say "Humph!"\r\n\r\n"One thing I hope is not wrong," said Sophy, "but I do trust that no one\r\nwill tell mother about Lord Ivinghoe. It is not jealousy, I hope, but I\r\ncannot see that there is anything in it, only the very sound would set\r\nmother more against Philip than ever."\r\n\r\n"You do not suppose that Francie is--is touched?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Sophy, gravely as an elder, "she is such a child. She was\r\nvery much pleased and entertained, and went on chattering, till I begged\r\nher to let us say our prayers in peace. We never talk after that, and\r\nshe went to sleep directly, and was smiling when she woke, but I do not\r\nfancy she will dwell on it, or fancy there is more to come, unless some\r\none puts it into her head."\r\n\r\nIt was sagely said, and Clement knew pretty well who was the one person\r\nfrom whom Sophy had fears. Poor Alda, improved and altered as she was,\r\nif such a hope occurred to her, would she be able to help imparting it\r\nto her daughter and looking out for the fulfilment?\r\n\r\nLoud calls for Sophy rang through the house, and Clement had only time\r\nto add--\r\n\r\n"Patience, dear child, and submission. They not only win the day, but\r\nare the best preparation for it when it is won."\r\n\r\nThat family of girls had grown up to be a care to one who had trusted\r\nthat his calling would be a shield from worldly concerns; but he\r\naccepted it as providential, and as a trust imposed on him as certainly\r\nas Felix had felt the headship of the orphaned house.\r\n\r\nHe was rejoiced to find on coming down-stairs that Lance had decided on\r\ngiving another day to family counsels, sending off little Felix with his\r\ncousins, who would drop him at the junction to Stoneborough, whence\r\nhe would be proud to travel alone. Clement took another resolution, in\r\nvirtue of which he knocked at his sister\'s door before she went down.\r\n\r\n"Cherry," said he, "would it be inconvenient to keep Francie here just\r\nfor the present?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; it would be only too pleasant for Anna now that she loses\r\nher brother. But why?"\r\n\r\n"I want to hinder her from hearing the conclusions that her mother may\r\ndraw from the diversions of yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I see. It might soon be,\r\n\r\n\r\n          \'He cometh not, she said.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"And Sophy will keep her counsel as to those moonlight wanderings. When\r\nwere they to go?"\r\n\r\n"By the 11.30 train. Marilda is coming up first."\r\n\r\nSo the plan was propounded. Franceska was only too much charmed to stay\r\nin what had indeed been an enchanted coast to her, and Sophy was\r\nsure that mamma would not mind; so the matter was settled, and the\r\nexplanatory notes written.\r\n\r\nThe party set off, with each little boy hugging a ship in full sail, and\r\nthe two young sisters were disposed of by a walk to Clipstone to talk\r\nover their adventures. Mrs. Grinstead felt certain of the good manners\r\nand reticence prevailing there to prevent any banter about Lord\r\nIvinghoe, and she secured the matter further by a hint to Anna.\r\n\r\nHowever, Miss Mohun was announced almost as they left the house. She\r\ntoo was full of the bazaar, which seemed so long ago to her hearers, but\r\nwith the result of which she was exceedingly delighted. The voluntary\r\nschools were secured for the present, and the gratitude of the Church\r\nfolk was unbounded, especially to the Vale Leston family, who had\r\ncontributed so greatly to the success of the whole.\r\n\r\nJane too had watched the evening manoeuvres, and perceived, with her\r\nsharp eyes, all that was avowed and not avowed under that rising moon.\r\nThe pair of whom she had first to speak were "Ivanhoe and Rowena," as\r\nshe called them, and she was glad to find that the "fair Saxon" had\r\ngrown up at Vale Leston, educated by her aunt and sister, and imbibing\r\nno outside habits or impressions.\r\n\r\n"Poor child," said Jane, "she looks like a flower; one is sorry it\r\nshould be meddled with."\r\n\r\n"So did my sister Stella, and there, contrary to all our fears, the\r\ncourse of true love did run smooth."\r\n\r\n"If it depended entirely on Rotherwood himself, I think it would,"\r\nsaid Jane, "but--" She paused and went on, "Ivinghoe is, I fear, really\r\nvolage, and he is the mark of a good many London mammas."\r\n\r\n"Is it true about Mrs. Henderson\'s sister?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing in it. I believe he danced with her a few times, and\r\nthe silly little thing put her own construction on it, but her sister\r\nmade her confess that he had never said a word to her, nor made love in\r\nany sense. Indeed, my sister Adeline would never have consented to her\r\ncoming here if she had believed in it, but Maura has a Greek nature and\r\nturns the Whites round her fingers. Well, I hope all will go well with\r\nyour pretty Franceska. I should not like her lovely bloom to be faded by\r\nIvinghoe. He is Rotherwood\'s own boy, though rather a prig, and a man in\r\nLondon. Oh, you know what that means!"\r\n\r\n"We have done _notre possible_ to keep our interpretation from the poor\r\nchild, or any hint of it from reaching her mother."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Poor Rowena, I hope the spark will be blown out, or\r\nremain only a pleasant recollection. As to little Maura, she had her\r\nlesson when she was reduced to hanging on Captain Henderson\'s other arm!\r\nShe is off to-day to meet Mr. White in London. That purpose has been\r\nserved."\r\n\r\n"And have you not a nearer interest?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gillian! Well, Captain Armytage did get hold of her, in what we\r\nmust now call the Lover\'s Walk! Yes, she has yielded, to her father\'s\r\ngreat satisfaction and perhaps to her mother\'s, for she will be more\r\ncomfortable in looking forward to a commonplace life for her than in\r\nthe dread of modern aberrations. But Gillian is very funny, very much\r\nashamed of having given in, and perfectly determined to go to her\r\ncollege and finish her education, which she may as well do while the\r\nSparrow Hawk is at sea. He is off to-day, and she says she is very glad\r\nto be rid of him. She sat down at once to her dynamite, as Primrose\r\ncalls it, having bound over Mysie and Valetta never to mention the\r\nsubject! I tell them that to obey in silence is the way to serve the\r\npoor man best."\r\n\r\nMiss Mohun was interrupted by the announcement of Lady Flight and Mr.\r\nFlight, who came equally eager with delight and gratitude to thank the\r\nHouse of Underwood for the triumph. The rest of the clergy of Rockquay\r\nand half the ladies might be expected, and in despair at last of a\r\n"lucid interval," Geraldine ordered the carriage for a long drive into\r\nthe country, so as to escape all visitors. Even then, they could not\r\ngot up the hill without being stopped four or five times to receive the\r\nthanks and compliments which nearly drove Gerald crazy, so much did\r\nhe want to hear what his family had to say to his plans, that he had\r\nactually consented to partake of a dowager-drive in a landau!\r\n\r\nHe and his uncle had discovered from the police in the course of the\r\nmorning that Ludmilla and her mother had not gone with the circus, but\r\nhad been seen embarking in the Alice Jane, a vessel bound for London.\r\nHis idea had been to hurry thither and endeavour to search out his\r\nhalf-sister, and rescue her; but Lance had assured him not only that\r\nit would probably be a vain quest, but that there would be full time to\r\nmeet the Alice Jane by land before she could get there by sea.\r\n\r\nTo this he had yielded, but not so readily to the representation that\r\nthe wisest way would be to keep out of sight; but to let Lance, as\r\na less interested party, go and interview the van proprietor, whose\r\ndirection had been sent to Clement, try to see O\'Leary, and do his best\r\nto bargain for Ludmilla\'s release, a matter on which all were decided,\r\nwhatever might be the upshot of the question respecting Gerald. To leave\r\na poor girl to circus training, even if there were no interest in her,\r\nwould have been shocking to right-minded people; but when it was such\r\na circus as O\'Leary\'s, and the maiden was so good, sweet, and modest\r\nas Lida, the thought would have been intolerable even without the\r\nconnection with Gerald, who had been much taken with all he had seen of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"That is fixed, even if we have to bid high for our Mona," said Lance.\r\n\r\n"By all means," said Geraldine. "It will be another question what will\r\nbe good for her when we have got her."\r\n\r\n"I will take care of that!" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Next," Lance went on, "we must see what proofs, or if there be any, of\r\nthis person\'s story. I expect one of you will have to pay well for them,\r\nbut I had better take a lawyer with me."\r\n\r\nClement named the solicitor who had the charge of the Vanderkist\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n"Better than Staples, or Bramshaw & Anderson. Yes, it would be best\r\nto have no previous knowledge of the family, and no neighbourly\r\nacquaintance. Moreover, I am not exactly an interested party, so I may\r\nbe better attended to."\r\n\r\n"Still I very much doubt, even if you do get any statement from the\r\nwoman, whether it can be depended upon without verification," said\r\nClement.\r\n\r\n"From the registers, if there are any at these places?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, and there must be personal inquiry. The first husband, Gian\r\nBenista, will have to be hunted down, dead or alive."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and another thing," said Lance, "if the Italian marriage were\r\nbefore the revolution in Sicily, I expect the ecclesiastical ceremony\r\nwould be valid, but after that, the civil marriage would be required."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" groaned Gerald, "if you would let me throw it all up without these\r\nwretched quibbles."\r\n\r\n"Not your father\'s honour," said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"Nor our honesty," said Clement. "It is galling enough to have your\r\nwhole position in life depend on the word of a worthless woman, but\r\nthere are things that must be taken patiently, as the will of One who\r\nknows."\r\n\r\n"It is so hard to accept it as God\'s will when it comes of human sin,"\r\nsaid Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Human thoughtlessness," said Clement; "but as long as it is not by our\r\nown fault we can take it as providential, and above all, guard against\r\nimpatience, the real ruin and destruction."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lance, "sit on a horse\'s head when he is down to keep him\r\nfrom kicking."\r\n\r\n"So you all are sitting on my head," said Gerald; "I shall get out and\r\nwalk--a good rush on the moors."\r\n\r\n"Wait at least to allow your head to take in my scheme," said Clement.\r\n\r\n"Provided it is not sitting still," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Far from it. Only it partly depends on my lady and mistress here--"\r\n\r\n"I guess," said Geraldine. "You know I am disposed that way by Dr.\r\nBrownlow\'s verdict."\r\n\r\n"And \'that way\' is that we go ourselves to try to trace out this strange\r\nallegation--you coming too, Gerald, so that we shall not quite be\r\nsitting on your head."\r\n\r\n"But my sister?"\r\n\r\n"We will see when we have recovered her," said Mrs. Grinstead.\r\n\r\n"I would begin with a visit to Stella and her husband," said\r\nClement; "Charlie could put us in the way of dealing with consuls and\r\nvice-consuls."\r\n\r\n"Excellent," cried his sister; "Anna goes of course, and I should like\r\nto take Francie. It would be such an education for her."\r\n\r\n"Well, why not?"\r\n\r\n"And what is to become of Adrian?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we should not have been here more than six months of course."\r\n\r\n"I could take him," said Lance, "unless Alda holds poor old Froggatt &\r\nUnderwood beneath his dignity."\r\n\r\n"That can be considered," said Clement; "it approves itself best to me,\r\nexcept that he is getting on so well here that I don\'t like to disturb\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"And when can you come up to town with me?" demanded Gerald; "tomorrow?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow being Saturday, it would be of little use to go. No, if you\r\nwill not kick, master, I must go home to-morrow, and look up poor \'Pur,\'\r\nalso the organ on Sunday. Come with me, and renew your acquaintance. We\r\nwill make an appointment with your attorney, Clem, and run up on Monday\r\nevening, see him on Tuesday."\r\n\r\nGerald sighed, submitting perforce, and they let him out to exhale as\r\nmuch impatience as he could in a tramp over the hills, while they sat\r\nand pitied him from their very hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. -- DESDICHADO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'Perish wealth and power and pride,\r\n        Mortal boons by mortals given;\r\n      But let constancy abide--\r\n        Constancy\'s the gift of Heaven.--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLancelot and Gerald did not obtain much by their journey to London.\r\nGerald wanted to begin with Mr. Bast, van proprietor, but Lance insisted\r\non having the lawyer\'s counsel first, and the advice amounted to\r\nexhortations not to commit themselves, or to make offers such as to\r\nexcite cupidity, especially in the matter of Ludmilla, but to dwell\r\non the fact of her being so close to the age of emancipation, and the\r\nillegality of tyrannical training.\r\n\r\nThis, however, proved to be wasted advice. Mr. Bast was impervious. He\r\nundertook to forward a letter to Mr. O\'Leary, but would not tell where,\r\nnor whether wife and daughter were with him. The letter was written, and\r\nin due time was answered, but with an intimation that the information\r\ndesired could only be given upon the terms already mentioned; and\r\nrefusing all transactions respecting the young lady mentioned, who was\r\nwith her natural guardians and in no need of intervention.\r\n\r\nThey were baffled at all points, and the lawyer did not encourage\r\nany idea of holding out a lure for information, which might easily be\r\ntrumped up. Since Lancelot had discovered so much as that the first\r\nmarriage had taken place at Messina, and the desertion at Trieste, as\r\nwell as that the husband was said to have been a native of Piedmont, he\r\nmuch recommended personal investigation at all these points, especially\r\nas Mr. Underwood could obtain the assistance and interest of consuls. It\r\nwas likely that if neither uncle nor nephew made further demonstration,\r\nthe O\'Learys would attempt further communication, which he and Lance\r\ncould follow up. This might be a clue to finding "the young lady"--to\r\nhim a secondary matter, to Gerald a vital one, but for the present\r\nnothing could be done for her, poor child.\r\n\r\nSo they could only return to Rockquay to make immediate preparations for\r\nthe journey. Matters were simplified by Miss Mohun, who, hearing that\r\nClement\'s doctors ordered him abroad for the winter, came to the rescue,\r\nsaying that she should miss Fergus and his lessons greatly, and she\r\nthought it would be a pity for Mrs. Edgar to lose their little baronet,\r\njust after having given offence to certain inhabitants by a modified\r\nexpulsion of Campbell and Horner, and therefore volunteering to take\r\nAdrian for a few terms, look after his health, his morals, and his\r\nlessons, and treat him in fact like a nephew, "to keep her hand in," she\r\nsaid, "till the infants began to appear from India."\r\n\r\nThis was gratefully accepted, and Alda liked the plan better than\r\nplacing him at Bexley, which she continued to regard as an unwholesome\r\nplace. The proposal to take Franceska was likewise welcome, and the\r\ndamsel herself was in transports of delight. Various arrangements had to\r\nbe made, and it was far on in August that the farewells were exchanged\r\nwith Clipstone and Beechcroft Cottage, where each member of the party\r\nfelt that a real friend had been acquired. The elders, ladies who had\r\ngrown up in an enthusiastic age, were even more devoted to one another\r\nthan were Anna and Mysie. Gillian stood a little aloof, resolved against\r\n"foolish" confidences, and devoting herself to studies for college life,\r\nin which she tried to swallow up all the feelings excited by those ship\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nDolores had her secret, which was to be no longer a secret when she\r\nhad heard from her father, and in the meantime, with Gerald\'s full\r\nconcurrence, she was about to work hard to qualify herself for lecturing\r\nor giving lessons on physical science. She could not enter the college\r\nthat she wished for till the winter term, and meant to spend the autumn\r\nin severe study.\r\n\r\n"We will work," was the substance of those last words between them, and\r\ntheir parting tokens were characteristic, each giving the other a little\r\ncase of mathematical instruments, "We will work, and we will hope."\r\n\r\n"And what for?" said Dolores.\r\n\r\n"I should say for toil, if it could be with untarnished name," said\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\n"Name and fame are our own to make," said Dolores, with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\nThis was their parting. Indeed they expected to meet at Christmas or\r\nbefore it, so soon as Mr. Maurice Mohun should have written. Gerald\r\nwas, by the unanimous wish of his uncles, to finish his terms at Oxford.\r\nWhatever might be his fate, a degree would help him in life.\r\n\r\nHe had accepted the decision, though he had rather have employed the\r\ntime in a restless search for his mother and sister; but after vainly\r\npursuing two or three entertainments at fairs, he became amenable to the\r\nconviction that they were more likely to hear something if they gave up\r\nthe search and kept quiet, and both Dolores and Mrs. Henderson promised\r\nto be on the watch.\r\n\r\nThe state of suspense proved an admirable tonic to the whole being of\r\nthe young man. His listlessness had departed, and he did everything with\r\nan energy he had never shown before. Only nothing would induce him to\r\ngo near Vale Leston, and he made it understood that his twenty-first\r\nbirthday was to be unnoticed. Not a word passed between Gerald and his\r\naunt as to the cause of the journey, and the doubt that hung over him,\r\nbut nothing could be more assiduous and tender than his whole conduct to\r\nher and his uncle throughout the journey, as though he had no object in\r\nlife but to save them trouble and make them comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe party started in August, travelled very slowly, and he was the\r\nkindest squire to the two girls, taking them to see everything, and\r\nbeing altogether, as Geraldine said, the most admirable courier in the\r\nworld, with a wonderful intuition as to what she individually would\r\nlike to see, and how she could see it without fatigue. Moreover, on the\r\nSunday that occurred at a little German town, it was the greatest joy to\r\nher that he sought no outside gaiety, but rather seemed to cling to his\r\nuncle\'s home ministrations, and even to her readings of hymns. They\r\nhad a quiet walk together, and it was a day of peace when his gentle\r\nkindness put her in mind of his father, yet with a regretful depth she\r\nhad always missed in Edgar.\r\n\r\nNor was there any of that old dreary, half-contemptuous tone and manner\r\nwhich had often made her think he was only conforming to please her, and\r\nshrinking from coming to close quarters, where he might confess opinions\r\nthat would grieve her. He was manifestly in earnest, listening and\r\njoining in the services as if they had a new force to him. Perhaps they\r\nhad the more from the very absence of the ordinary externals, and with\r\nnothing to disturb the individual personality of Clement\'s low, earnest,\r\nand reverent tones. There were tears on his eyelashes as he rose up,\r\nbent over, and kissed his Cherie. And that evening, while Clement and\r\nthe two nieces walked farther, and listened to the Benediction in the\r\nlittle Austrian church, Gerald sat under a linden-tree with his aunt,\r\nand in the fullness of his heart told her how things stood between him\r\nand Dolores.\r\n\r\nGeraldine had never been as much attracted by Dolores as by Gillian\r\nand Mysie, but she was greatly touched by hearing that the meeting and\r\nopening of affection had been on the discovery that Gerald was probably\r\nnameless and landless, and that the maiden was bent on casting in her\r\nlot with him whatever his fate might be.\r\n\r\nHe murmured to himself the old lines, with a slight alteration--\r\n\r\n\r\n          "I could not love thee, dear, so much,\r\n             Loved I not justice more."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, Cherie, our affection is a very different and better\r\nthing than it would be if I were only the rich young squire sure of my\r\nposition."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is, my dear. I honour and love her for being my boy\'s\r\nbrave comforter--comforter in the true sense. I see now what has helped\r\nyou to be so brave and cheery. But what will her father say?"\r\n\r\n"He will probably be startled, and--and will object, but it would be a\r\nmatter of waiting anyway, the patience that the Vicar preaches, and we\r\nhave made up our minds. I\'ll fight my own way; she to prepare by her\r\nCambridge course to come and work with me, as we can do so much better\r\namong the people--among them in reality, and by no pretence."\r\n\r\n"Ah! don\'t speak as if you gave up your cause."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t, if you don\'t like to hear it, Cherie," he said, smiling;\r\n"but anyway you will be good to Dolores."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will do my best, my dear. I am sure you and she, whatever\r\nhappens, have the earnest purpose and soul to do all the good you can,\r\nwhether from above or on the same level, and that makes the oneness of\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Cherie carissima. You see the secret of our true bond."\r\n\r\n"One bond to make it deeper must be there. The love of God beneath the\r\nlove of man."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. -- THE SILENT STAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Then the traveller in the dark\r\n     Thanks you for your tiny spark;\r\n     He would not know which way to go\r\n     If you did not twinkle so.--JANE TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so they came to Buda, where Charles Audley represented English\r\ndiplomatic interests on the banks of the Danube. When the quaint old\r\nsemi-oriental-looking city came in sight and the train stopped, the neat\r\nEnglish-looking carriage, with gay Hungarian postillions, could be seen\r\ndrawn up to meet them outside the station.\r\n\r\nCharles and his father, now Sir Robert, were receiving them with\r\noutstretched hands and joyous words, and in a few seconds more they were\r\nwith their little Stella! Yes, their little Stella still, as Clement and\r\nCherry had time to see, when Gerald and the two girls had insisted on\r\nwalking, however far it might be, with the two Audleys, though Charlie\r\ntold them that no one ever walked in Hungary who could help it, and that\r\nhe should be stared at for bringing such strange animals.\r\n\r\nGeraldine had stayed with Stella once before, and Clement had made one\r\nhurried and distressful rush in the trouble about Angela; but that\r\nwas at Munich, and nearly nine years ago, before the many changes and\r\nchances of life had come to them. To Stella those years had brought two\r\nlittle boys, whose appearance in the world had been delayed till the\r\nAudley family had begun to get anxious for an heir, but while the\r\nUnderwoods thought it was well that their parents, especially their\r\nfather, should have time to grow a little older.\r\n\r\nAnd Stella looked as daintily, delicately pretty as ever, at first sight\r\nlike a china shepherdess to be put under a glass shade, but on a second\r\nview, with a thoughtful sweetness and depth in her face that made her\r\nnot merely pretty but lovely. How happy she was, gazing at her brother\r\nand sister, and now and then putting a question to bring out the\r\noverflow of home news, so dear to her. For she was still their silent\r\nstar, making very few words evince her intense interest and sympathy.\r\n\r\nEven when they were at home, in the house that looked outside like a\r\ncastle in a romance, but which was so truly English within, and the two\r\nlittle fellows of four and three came toddling to meet her, shrinking\r\ninto her skirts at sight of the new uncle and aunt, there was a quiet\r\ngentle firmness--all the old Stella--in her dealings with them, as she\r\ndrew them to kiss and greet the strangers. Robbie and Theodore were\r\nsturdy, rosy beings, full of life, but perfectly amenable to that\r\nsweet low voice. Their father and grandfather might romp with them to\r\nscreaming pitch, and idolize them almost to spoiling, yet they too were\r\nunder that gentle check which the young wife exercised on all around.\r\n\r\nShe was only thirty-one, and so small, so fair and young in looks, that\r\nto her elder sister her pretty matronly rule _would_ at first seem like\r\nthe management of a dolls\' house, even though her servants, English,\r\nGerman, or Magyar, obeyed her implicitly; and for that matter, as\r\nCharlie and Sir Robert freely and merrily avowed, so did they. The young\r\nsecretary was her bounden slave, and held her as the ideal woman, though\r\nthere came to be a little swerving of his allegiance towards the tall\r\nand beautiful Franceska, who had insensibly improved greatly in grace\r\nand readiness on her travels, and quite dazzled the Hungarians; while\r\nAnna was immensely exultant, and used to come to her aunt\'s room every\r\nnight to talk of her lovely Francie as a safety-valve from discussing\r\nthe matter with Francie herself, who remained perfectly simple and\r\nunconscious of her own charms. Geraldine could not think them quite\r\nequal to the more exquisite and delicately-finished, as well as more\r\nmatured, beauty of little Stella, but that was a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nThe household was more English than Hungarian, or even German, and there\r\nwere curious similitudes to the Vale Leston Priory arrangements, which\r\nkept Stella\'s Underwood heart in mind. There had to be receptions, and\r\nit was plain that when she put Fernan\'s diamonds on, Mrs. Audley was\r\nquite at home and at perfect ease in German and Hungarian society,\r\nspeaking the languages without hesitation when she _did_ speak, while in\r\nher quiet way keeping every one entertained, showing the art de tenir un\r\nsalon, and moreover, preserving Francie from obtrusive admiration in a\r\nway perhaps learnt by experience on that more perilous subject, Angela,\r\nwho had invited what Francie shrank from. The two girls were supremely\r\nhappy, and Francie seemed to have a fountain of joy that diffused a\r\nrose-coloured spray over everything.\r\n\r\nOne of the famous concerts of Hungarian gipsies was given, and in that\r\nClement and Geraldine were alike startled by tones recalling those of\r\nthe memorable concert at Bexley, all the more because they seemed to\r\nhave a curious fascination for Gerald. Moreover, those peculiar eyes and\r\neyelashes, the first link observed between him and the Little Butterfly,\r\nwere so often repeated in the gipsy band that it was plain whence they\r\nwere derived. Charles Audley thought it worth while to find means of\r\ninquiry among the gipsies as to whether anything was known of Zoraya\r\nPrebel or her brother Sebastian; but after some delay and various\r\nexcitements nothing was discovered, but that there had been a family,\r\nwho were esteemed recreants to their race, and had sold their children\r\nto the managers of German or Italian bands of musicians. One brother had\r\ncome back a broken man, who had learnt vices and ruined himself, though\r\nhe talked largely of his wonderful success in company with his sister,\r\nwho had made grand marriages. What had become of her he did not know;\r\nand when Gerald went with Mr. Audley to a little mountain valley to\r\nvisit him, he had been dead for a week or more.\r\n\r\nAll this had made some delay, and it was almost the end of the long\r\nvacation. Charles Audley undertook to go to Trieste with the travellers,\r\nand make inquiries about Zoraya and her first husband. Sir Robert, the\r\nSkipper, as the family still termed him, had written for his yacht to\r\nmeet him there, and be ready for him to convey the party to Sicily.\r\nHe professed that he could not lose sight of Franceska, with whom he\r\ndeclared himself nearly as much smitten as ever he had been with his\r\ndaughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nThey left that pretty creature in her happy home, and arrived at\r\nTrieste, where Charles Audley set various agencies to work, and arrived\r\nat a remembrance of Giovanni Benista, an impresario, having been in a\r\nstate of great fury at his wife, his most able performer, having fled\r\nfrom him just as he had been at the expense of training and making her\r\nvaluable. He tried to have her pursued, but there was reason to think\r\nthat she had been smuggled away in an English or American ship, and\r\nnothing could be done.\r\n\r\nThus much of the story then was confirmed, and Gerald had little or no\r\ndoubt of the rest of it, but he was obliged to leave the pursuit of\r\nthe quest to his uncle and aunt, being somewhat consoled for having to\r\nreturn to England by the expectation of hearing from Mr. Maurice Mohun.\r\n\r\nTwice he returned for his aunt\'s last kiss, nay, even a third time, and\r\nthen with the half-choked words, "My true, my dearest mother!"\r\n\r\nAnd he absolutely bent his knee as he asked for his uncle Clement\'s\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. -- THE RED MANTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     And deemed themselves a shameful part\r\n     Of pageant which they cursed in heart.--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDolores was waiting till the Christmas term to go to her college.\r\nThe fame of her volcanic lectures had reached Avoncester, and she was\r\nentreated to repeat them at the High School there. The Mouse-trap had\r\nnaturally been sent to Miss Vincent, the former governess, who had\r\nbecome head-mistress of the High School at Silverton, and she wrote an\r\nurgent request that her pupils might have the advantage of the lectures.\r\nWould Dolores come and give her course there, and stay a few days with\r\nher, reviving old times?\r\n\r\nDolores consented, being always glad of an opportunity of trying her\r\nwings, though she had not the pleasantest recollections connected with\r\nSilverton, but she would be really glad to see Miss Vincent, who had\r\nbeen always kind to her. So she travelled up to Silverton, and found the\r\nhead-mistress living in cheerful rooms, with another of the teachers in\r\nthe same house, all boarding together, but with separate sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\nDolores\' first walk was to see Miss Hackett. It was quite startling to\r\nfind the good old lady looking exactly the same as when she had come to\r\nluncheon at Silverfold, and arranged for G. F. S., and weakly stood up\r\nfor her sister nine years previously, those years which seemed ages long\r\nago to the maiden who had made the round of the world since, while the\r\nlady had only lived in her Casement Cottage, and done almost the same\r\nthings day by day.\r\n\r\nThere was one exception, however, Constance had married a union\r\ndoctor in the neighbourhood. She came into Silverton to see her old\r\nacquaintance, and looked older and more commonplace than Dolores could\r\nhave thought possible, and her talk was no longer of books and romances,\r\nbut of smoking chimneys, cross landlords, and troublesome cooks, and the\r\nwicked neglects of her vicar\'s and her squire\'s wife. As Dolores walked\r\nback to Silverton, she heard drums and trumpets, and was nearly swept\r\naway by a rushing stream of little boys and girls. Then came before her\r\nan elephant, with ornamental housing and howdah, and a train of cars,\r\nmeant to be very fine, but way-worn and battered, with white and piebald\r\nsteeds, and gaudy tinselly drivers, and dames in scarlet and blue,\r\nmuch needing a washing, distributing coloured sheets about the grand\r\nperformance to take place that night at eight o\'clock, of the Sepoy\'s\r\nDeath Song and the Bleeding Bride.\r\n\r\nMiss Vincent had asked Miss Hackett to supper, and prepared herself and\r\nher fellow-teacher, Miss Calton, for a pleasant evening of talk, but\r\nto her great surprise, Dolores expressed her intention of going to the\r\nperformance at the circus.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Miss Vincent, "this is a very low affair--not Sanger\'s,\r\nnor anything so respectable. They have been here before, and the\r\nlodging-house people went and were quite shocked."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dolores, "but that is all the more reason I want to go.\r\nThere is a girl with them in whom we are very much interested. She was\r\nkidnapped from Rockquay at the time this circus was there. At least I am\r\nalmost sure it is the same, and I must see if she is there."\r\n\r\n"But if she is you cannot do anything."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can; I can let her brother know. It must be done, Miss Vincent.\r\nI have promised, and it is of fearful consequence."\r\n\r\n"Should you know her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I have often talked to her in Mrs. Henderson\'s class. I could\r\nnot mistake her."\r\n\r\nMiss Hackett was so much horrified at the notion of a G. F. S. "business\r\ngirl" being in bondage to a circus, that she gallantly volunteered to go\r\nwith Miss Mohun, and Miss Vincent could only consent.\r\n\r\nThe place of the circus was an open piece of ground lying between\r\nSilverton and Silverfold, and thither they betook themselves--Miss\r\nHackett in an old bonnet and waterproof that might have belonged to\r\nany woman, and Dolores wearing a certain crimson ulster, which she had\r\nbought in Auckland for her homeward voyage, and which her cousins had\r\nchosen to dub as "the Maori." After a good deal of jostling and much\r\nscent of beer and bad tobacco they achieved an entrance, and sat upon a\r\nhard bench, half stifled with the odours, to which were added those of\r\nhuman and equine nature and of paraffin. As to the performance, Dolores\r\nwas too much absorbed in looking out for Ludmilla, together with the\r\nfear that Miss Hackett might either faint or grow desperate, and come\r\naway, to attend much to it; and she only was aware that there was a\r\ngeneral scurrying, in which the horses and the elephant took their part;\r\nand that men and scantily dressed females put themselves in unnatural\r\npositions; that there was a firing of pistols and singing of vulgar\r\nsongs, and finally the hero and heroine made their bows on the\r\nelephant\'s back.\r\n\r\nMiss Hackett wanted to depart before the Bleeding Bride came on, but\r\nDolores entreated her to stay, and she heroically endured a little\r\nlonger. This seemed, consciously or not, to be a parody of the ballad of\r\nLord Thomas and Fair Annet, but of course it began with an abduction on\r\nhorseback and a wild chase, in which even the elephant did his part,\r\nand plenty more firing. Then the future bride came on, supposed to\r\nbe hawking, during which pastime she sang a song standing upright on\r\nhorseback, and the faithless Lord Thomas appeared and courted her with\r\nthe most remarkable antics of himself and his piebald steed.\r\n\r\nThe forsaken Annet consoled herself with careering about, taking a last\r\nleave of her beloved steed--a mangy-looking pony--and performing various\r\nfreaks with it, then singing a truculent song of revenge, in pursuance\r\nof which she hid herself to await the bridal procession. And as the\r\nbride came on, among her attendants Dolores detected unmistakably those\r\neyes of Gerald\'s! She squeezed Miss Hackett\'s hand, and saw little\r\nmore of the final catastrophe. Somehow the bride was stabbed, and fell\r\nscreaming, while the fair Annet executed a war dance, but what became\r\nof her was uncertain. All Dolores knew was, that Ludmilla was there! She\r\nhad recognized not only the eyes, but the air and figure.\r\n\r\nWhen they got free of the crowd, which was a great distress to poor Miss\r\nHackett, Dolores said--\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is that poor girl! She must be saved!"\r\n\r\n"How? What can you do?"\r\n\r\n"I shall telegraph to her brother. You will help me, Miss Hackett?"\r\n\r\n"But--what--who is her brother?" said Miss Hackett, expecting to hear he\r\nwas a carpenter perhaps, or at least a clerk.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Underwood of Vale Leston--Gerald Underwood," answered Dolores. "His\r\nfather made an unfortunate marriage with a singer. She really is his\r\nhalf-sister, and I promised to do all I could to help him to find her\r\nand save her. He is at Oxford. I shall telegraph to him the first thing\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in this to object to, and Miss Hackett would not be\r\npersuaded not to see her to the door of Miss Vincent\'s lodgings,\r\nthough lengthening her own walk--alone, a thing more terrible to her\r\nold-fashioned mind than to that of her companion.\r\n\r\nDolores wrote her telegram--\r\n\r\n"Dolores Mohun, Valentia, Silverton, to Gerald Underwood, Trinity\r\nCollege, Oxford. Ludmilla here. Circus. Come."\r\n\r\nShe sent it with the more confidence that she had received a letter\r\nfrom her father with a sort of conditional consent to her engagement to\r\nGerald, so that she could, if needful, avow herself betrothed to him;\r\nthough her usual reticence made her unwilling to put the matter forward\r\nin the present condition of affairs. She went out to the post-office\r\nat the first moment when she could hope to find the telegraph office\r\nat work, and just as she had turned from it, she met a girl in a dark,\r\nlong, ill-fitting jacket and black hat, with a basket in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Lydia!" exclaimed Dolores, using the old Rockquay name.\r\n\r\n"Miss Dolores!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. You are here! I saw you last night."\r\n\r\n"Me! Me! Oh, I am ashamed that you did. Don\'t tell Mr. Flight."\r\n\r\nThere were tears starting to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Can I do anything for you?"\r\n\r\n"No--no. Oh, if you could! But they have apprenticed me."\r\n\r\n"Who have?"\r\n\r\n"My mother and Mr. O\'Leary."\r\n\r\n"Are they here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. They wanted money--apprenticed me to this Jellicoe! I must make\r\nhaste. They sent me out to take something to the wash, and buy some\r\nfresh butter. They must not guess that I have met any one."\r\n\r\n"I will walk with you. I have been telegraphing to your brother that I\r\nhave found you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he was so good to me! And Mr. Flight, I was so grieved to fail him.\r\nThey made me get up and dress in the night, and before I knew what I\r\nwas about I was on the quay--carried out to the ship. I had no paper--no\r\nmeans of writing; I was watched. And now it is too dreadful! Oh, Miss\r\nDolores! if Mrs. Henderson could see the cruel positions they try to\r\nforce on me, the ways they handle me--they hurt so; and what is worse,\r\nno modest girl could bear the way they go on, and want me to do the\r\nsame. I could when I was little, but I am stiffer now, and oh! ashamed.\r\nIf I can\'t--they starve me--yes, and beat me, and hurt me with their\r\nthings. It is bondage like the Israelites, and I don\'t want to get to\r\nlike it, as they say I shall, for then--then there are those terrible\r\nsongs to be sung, and that shocking dress to be shown off in. My mother\r\nwill not help. She says it is what she went through, and all have to\r\ndo, and that I shall soon leave off minding; but oh, I often think I\r\nhad rather die than grow like--like Miss Bellamour. I hope I shall (they\r\noften frighten me with that horse), only somehow I can\'t wish to be\r\nkilled at the moment, and try to save myself. And once I thought I would\r\nlet myself fall, rather than go on with it, but I thought it would be\r\nwicked, and I couldn\'t. But I have prayed to God to help me and spare\r\nme; and now He has heard. And will my brother be able--or will he choose\r\nto help me?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it, my poor dear girl. He wishes nothing more."\r\n\r\n"Please turn this way. They must not see me speak to any one."\r\n\r\n"One word more. How long is the circus to be here?"\r\n\r\n"We never know; it depends on the receipts--may go to-morrow. Oh,\r\nthere--"\r\n\r\nShe hurried on without another word, and Dolores slowly returned to Miss\r\nVincent\'s lodgings. Her lecture was to be given at three o\'clock, but\r\nshe knew that she should have to be shown the school and class-rooms in\r\nthe forenoon. Gerald, as she calculated the trains, might arrive either\r\nby half-past twelve or a quarter past four.\r\n\r\nNervously she endured her survey of the school, replying to the comments\r\nas if in a dream, and hurrying it over, so as must have vexed those\r\nwho expected her to be interested. She dashed off to the station, and\r\nreached it just in time to see the train come in. Was it--yes, it was\r\nGerald who sprang out and came towards her.\r\n\r\n"Dolores! My gallant Dolores! You have found her!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but in cruel slavery--apprenticed."\r\n\r\n"That can be upset. Her mother--is she here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and O\'Leary. They sold her, apprenticed her, and these people use\r\nher brutally. She told me this morning. No, I don\'t think you can get at\r\nher now."\r\n\r\n"I will see her mother at any rate. I may be able to buy her off. Where\r\nshall I find you?"\r\n\r\nDolores told him, but advised him to meet her at Miss Hackett\'s, whom\r\nshe thought more able to help, and more willing than Miss Vincent, in\r\ncase he was able to bring Ludmilla away with him.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard from my father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--what I expected."\r\n\r\n"But it will make no difference in the long run."\r\n\r\n"Dearest, do I not trust your brave words? From Trieste I hear that the\r\nendeavour of Benista to recover his wife is proved. There\'s one step of\r\nthe chain. Is it dragging us down, or setting us free?"\r\n\r\n"Free--free from the perplexities of property," cried Dolores. "Free to\r\ncarve out a life."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I have wished I was a younger son. Only if it could have come\r\nin some other way!"\r\n\r\nDolores had to go to luncheon at Miss Vincent\'s, and then to deliver her\r\nlecture. It was well that she had given it so often as almost to know it\r\nby heart, for the volcano of anxiety was surging high within her.\r\n\r\nAs she went out she saw Gerald waiting for her, and his whole mien spoke\r\nof failure.\r\n\r\n"Failed! Yes," he said. "The poor child is regularly bound to that\r\nJellicoe, the master of the concern, for twenty-five pounds, the fine\r\nthat my uncle brought on the mother, as O\'Leary said with a grin, and\r\nshe is still under sixteen."\r\n\r\n"Is there no hope till then?"\r\n\r\n"He and O\'Leary declare there would be breach of contract if she left\r\nthem even then. I don\'t know whether they are right, but any amount of\r\nmischief might be done before her birthday. They talk of sending her to\r\nBelgium to be trained, and that is fatal."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t she be bought off?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I tried, but I can\'t raise more than seventy pounds at the\r\nutmost just now."\r\n\r\n"I could help. I have twenty-three pounds. I could give up my term."\r\n\r\n"No use. They know that I shall not be of age till January, besides\r\nthe other matter. I assured them that however that might end, my uncles\r\nwould honour any order I might give for the sake of rescuing her, but\r\nthey laughed the idea to scorn. O\'Leary had the impudence to intimate,\r\nhowever, that if I chose to accept the terms expressed, \'his wife might\r\nbe amenable.\'"\r\n\r\n"They are?"\r\n\r\n"Five hundred for evidence on the previous marriage in my favour; but\r\nI am past believing a word that she says, at least under O\'Leary\'s\r\ndictation. She might produce a forgery. So I told him that my uncle was\r\ninvestigating the matter with the consul in Sicily; and the intolerable\r\nbrutes sneered more than over at the idea of the question being in\r\nthe hands of the interested party, when they could upset that meddling\r\nparson in a moment."\r\n\r\n"Can nothing be done?"\r\n\r\n"I thought of asking one of your old ladies whether there is a lawyer or\r\nPrevention of Cruelty man who could tell me whether the agreement holds,\r\nbut I am afraid she is too old. You saw no mark of ill-usage?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. They would be too cunning."\r\n\r\n"If we could help her to escape what a lark it would be!"\r\n\r\n"I do believe we could" cried Dolores. "If I could only get a note to\r\nher! And this red ulster! I wonder if Miss Hackett would help!"\r\n\r\nDolores waited for Miss Hackett, who had lingered behind, and told her\r\nas much of the facts as was expedient. There was a spice of romance in\r\nthe Hackett soul, and the idea of a poor girl, a G. F. S. maiden, in the\r\nhands of these cruel and unscrupulous people was so dreadful that she\r\nwas actually persuaded to bethink herself of means of assistance.\r\n\r\n"Where did you meet the girl?" she said. Dolores told her the street.\r\n\r\n"Ah! depend upon it the things were with Mrs. Crachett, who I know\r\nhas done washing for people about on fair-days, when they can\'t do it\r\nthemselves. She has a daughter in my G. F. S. class; I wonder if we\r\ncould get any help from her."\r\n\r\nIt was a very odd device for a respectable associate and member of G. F.\r\nS. to undertake, but if ever the end might justify the means it was on\r\nthe present occasion. Fortune favoured them, for Melinda Crachett was\r\nalone in the house, ironing out some pale pink garments.\r\n\r\n"Are you washing for those people on the common, Melinda?" asked Miss\r\nHackett.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Hackett. They want them by seven o\'clock to-night very\r\nparticular, and they promised me a seat to see the performance, miss, if\r\nI brought them in good time, and I wondered, miss, if you would object."\r\n\r\n"Only tell me, Melinda, whom you saw."\r\n\r\n"I saw the lady herself, ma\'am, the old lady, when I took the things."\r\n\r\n"No young person?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am. It was a very nice young lady indeed that brought me down\r\nthis pink tunic, because it got stained last night, and she said her\r\norders was to promise me a ticket if it came in time; but, oh my! ma\'am,\r\nshe looked as if she wanted to tell me not to come."\r\n\r\n"Poor girl! She is a G. F. S. member, Melinda, and I do believe you\r\nwould be doing a very good deed if you could help us to get her away\r\nfrom those people."\r\n\r\nMelinda\'s eyes grew round with eagerness. She had no doubts respecting\r\nwhat Miss Hackett advised her to do, and there was nothing for it but\r\nto take the risk. Then and there Dolores sat down and pencilled a note,\r\ndirecting Ludmilla to put on the red ulster after her performance, if\r\npossible, when people were going away, and slip out among them, joining\r\nMelinda, who would convey her to Miss Hackett\'s. This was safer than for\r\nGerald to be nearer, since he was liable to be recognized. Still it was\r\na desperate risk, and Dolores had great doubts whether she should ever\r\nsee her red Maori again.\r\n\r\nSo in intense anxiety the two waited in Miss Hackett\'s parlour, where\r\nthe good lady left them, as she said, to attend to her accounts, but\r\nreally with an inkling or more of the state of affairs between them.\r\nEach had heard from New Zealand, and knew that Maurice Mohun was\r\nsuspending his consent till he had heard farther from home, both as\r\nto Gerald\'s character and prospects, and there was no such absolute\r\nrefusal, even in view of his overthrow of the young man\'s position, as\r\nto make it incumbent on them to break off intercourse. Colonial habits\r\nmodified opinion, and to know that the loss was neither the youth\'s own\r\nfault nor that of his father, would make the acceptance a question of\r\nonly prudence, provided his personal character were satisfactory. Thus\r\nthey felt free to hold themselves engaged, though Gerald had further to\r\ntell that his letters from Messina purported that an old priest had been\r\ntraced out who had married the impresario, Giovanni Benista, a native\r\nof Piedmont, to Zoraya Prebel, Hungarian, in the year 1859, when\r\necclesiastical marriages were still valid without the civil ceremony.\r\n\r\n"Another step in my descent," said Gerald. "Still, it does not prove\r\nwhether this first husband was alive. No; and Piedmont, though a small\r\ncountry, is a wide field in which to seek one who may have cut all\r\nconnection with it. However, these undaunted people of mine are resolved\r\nto pursue their quest, and, as perhaps you have heard, are invited to\r\nstay at Rocca Marina for the purpose."\r\n\r\n"I should think that was a good measure; Mr. White gets quarry-men\r\nfrom all the country round, and would be able to find out about the\r\nvillages."\r\n\r\n"But how unlikely it is that one of these wanderers would have kept\r\nup intercourse with his family! They may do their best to satisfy the\r\ngeneral conscience, but I see no end to it."\r\n\r\n"And a more immediate question--what are we to do with your sister if\r\nshe escapes to-night? Shall I take her to Mrs. Henderson?"\r\n\r\n"She would not be safe there. No, I must carry her straight to America,\r\nthe only way to choke off pursuit."\r\n\r\n"You! Your term!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that. I shall write to the Warden pleading urgent private\r\nbusiness. I have enough in hand for our passage, and the \'Censor\' will\r\ntake my articles and give me an introduction. I shall be able to keep\r\nmyself and her. I have a real longing to see Fiddler\'s Ranch."\r\n\r\n"But can you rough it?" asked Dolores, anxiously looking at his delicate\r\ngirlish complexion and slight figure.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! I was born to it. I know what it was when Fiddler\'s Ranch was\r\nfar from the civilization of Violinia, as they call it now. I don\'t mean\r\nto make a secret of it, and grieve your heart or Cherie\'s. She has had\r\nenough of that, but I must make the plunge to save my sister, and if\r\nthings come round it will be all the better to have some practical\r\nknowledge of the masses and the social problems by living among them."\r\n\r\n"Oh that I could make the experiment with you!"\r\n\r\n"You will be my inspiration and encouragement, and come to me in due\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nHe came round to her, and she let him give her his first kiss.\r\n\r\n"God will help us," she said reverently; "it is the cause of uprightness\r\nand deliverance from cruel bondage."\r\n\r\nThe plans had been settled; Gerald had arranged with a cab which was\r\nto take him and his sister to a house five miles out in the country, of\r\nwhich Miss Hackett had given the name, so that they might seem to have\r\nbeen spending the evening with her. Thence it was but a step to the\r\nstation of a different railway from that which went through Silverton,\r\nand they would go by the mail train to London, where Ludmilla could\r\nbe deposited at Mrs. Grinstead\'s house at Brompton, where Martha could\r\nprovide her with an outfit, while Gerald saw the editor of the \'Censor\',\r\ngot some money from the bank, telegraphed to Oxford for his baggage,\r\nand made ready to start the next morning for Liverpool, whither he had\r\ntelegraphed to secure a second-class passage to New York for G. F. Wood\r\nand Lydia Wood, the names which he meant to be called by.\r\n\r\n"The first name I knew," he said, "the name of Tom Wood, is far more\r\nreal to me or my father than Edgar Underwood ever could be."\r\n\r\nHe promised that Dolores should have a telegram at Clipstone by the time\r\nshe reached it, for she had to give her second lecture the next day,\r\nand was to return afterwards. All this had been discussed over and over\r\nagain, and there had been many quakings and declarations that the scheme\r\nhad failed, and that neither girl could have had courage, nor perhaps\r\nadroitness, and that the poor prisoner had been re-captured. Gerald had\r\nmade more than one expedition into the little garden to listen, and\r\nhad filled the house with cold air before he returned, sat down in a\r\nresigned fashion, and declared--\r\n\r\n"It is all up! That comes of trusting to fools of girls."\r\n\r\n"Hark!"\r\n\r\nHe sprang up and out into the vestibule. Miss Hackett opened the\r\ndoor into the back passage. There stood the "red mantle" and Melinda\r\nCrachett. Gerald took the trembling figure in his arms with a brotherly\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n"My little sister," he said, "look to me," then gave her to Dolores, who\r\nled her into the drawing-room, and put her into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nShe could hardly stand, but tried to jump up as Miss Hackett entered.\r\n\r\n"No, no, my poor child," she said, "sit still! Rest. Were you followed?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think they had missed me."\r\n\r\nShe was so breathless that Miss Hackett would have given her a glass of\r\nwine, but she shook her head,\r\n\r\n"Oh no, thank you! I\'ve kept the pledge."\r\n\r\nThe tea-things were there, waiting for her arrival. Dolores would have\r\nhelped her take off the red garment, but she shrank from it. She had\r\nonly her gaudy theatrical dress beneath. How was she to go to London\r\nin it? However, Miss Hackett devised that she should borrow the little\r\nmaid-servant\'s clothes, and Gerald undertook to send them back when\r\nMartha should have fitted her out at Brompton. The theatrical costume\r\nMiss Hackett would return by a messenger without implicating Melinda\r\nCrachett. They took the girl up-stairs to effect the change, and restore\r\nher as much as they could, and she came down with her rouge washed off,\r\nand very pale, but looking like herself, as, poor thing, she always\r\ndid look more or less frightened, and now with tears about her eyelids,\r\ntears that broke forth as Gerald went up to her, took her by the hand,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n"Brighten up, little sister; you have given yourself to me, and I must\r\ntake care of you now."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I do beg your pardon, but my poor mother--I didn\'t know--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to go back?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no," and she shuddered again; "but I am sorry for her. She has\r\nsuch a hard master, and she used to be good to me."\r\n\r\nMiss Hackett had come opportunely to make her drink some tea, and then\r\nmade both take food enough to sustain them through the night journey.\r\nThen, and afterwards, they gathered what had been Ludmilla\'s sad little\r\nstory. Her father, in spite of his marriage, which was according to the\r\nlax notions of German Protestants, had been a fairly respectable man,\r\nvery fond of his little daughter, and exceedingly careful of her, though\r\neven as a tiny child he had made her useful, trained her to singing and\r\ndancing, and brought her forward as a charming little fairy, when it was\r\nall play to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we were so happy in those days," she said tearfully.\r\n\r\nWhen he died it was with an injunction to his wife not to bring up\r\nLudmilla to the stage now that he was not there to take care of her.\r\nWith the means he had left she had set up her shop at Rockquay, and\r\nthough she had never been an affectionate mother, Ludmilla had been\r\nfairly happy, and had been a favourite with Mr. Flight and the school\r\nauthorities, and had been thoroughly imbued with their spirit. A\r\nchange had, however, come over her mother ever since an expedition to\r\nAvoncester, when she had met O\'Leary. She had probably always contrived\r\na certain amount of illicit trade in tobacco and spirits by means of\r\nthe sailors in the foreign traders who put into the little harbour of\r\nRockquay; but her daughter was scarcely cognizant of this, and would not\r\nhave understood the evil if she had done so, nor did it affect her life.\r\nO\'Leary had, however, been the clown in Mr. Schnetterling\'s troupe, and\r\nhad become partner with Jellicoe. The sight of him revived all Zoraya\'s\r\nBohemian inclinations, and on his side he knew her to have still great\r\ncapabilities, and recollected enough of her little daughter to be sure\r\nthat she would be a valuable possession. Moreover, Mrs. Schnetterling\r\nhad carried her contraband traffic a little too far, especially where\r\nthe boys of the preparatory school were concerned. She began to fear the\r\ngauger and the policeman, and she had consented to marry O\'Leary at the\r\nAvoncester register office, meaning to keep the matter a secret until\r\nshe could wind up her affairs at Rockquay. Even her daughter was kept in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nTwo occurrences had, however, precipitated matters. One was the stir\r\nthat Clement had made about the school-boys\' festival, ending in\r\nthe fine being imposed; the other, the discovery that the graceful,\r\nwell-endowed young esquire was the child who had been left to probable\r\nbeggary with a dying father twenty years previously.\r\n\r\nJellicoe, the principal owner of the circus, advanced the money for the\r\nfine, on condition of the girl and her mother becoming attached to the\r\ncircus; and the object of O\'Leary was to make as much profit as possible\r\nout of the mystery that hung over the young heir of Vale Leston. His\r\nrefusal to attend to the claim on him, together with spite at his\r\nuncle, as having brought about the prosecution, and to Mr. Flight for\r\nhesitating to remunerate the girl for the performance that was to have\r\nbeen free; perhaps too certain debts and difficulties, all conspired to\r\noccasion the midnight flitting in such a manner as to prevent the circus\r\nfrom being pursued.\r\n\r\nThenceforth poor Lida\'s life had been hopeless misery, with all her\r\nwomanly and religious instincts outraged, and the probability of worse\r\nin future. Jellicoe, his wife, and O\'Leary had no pity, and her mother\r\nvery little, and no principle; and she had no hope, except that release\r\nmight come by some crippling accident. Workhouse or hospital would be\r\ndeliverance, since thence she could write to Mrs. Henderson.\r\n\r\nShe shook and trembled still lest she should be pursued, though Miss\r\nHackett assured her that this was the last place to be suspected, and it\r\nwas not easy to make her eat. Presently Gerald stood ready to take her\r\nto the cab.\r\n\r\nDolores came to the gate with them. There was only space for a fervent\r\nembrace and "God bless you!" and then she stood watching as they went\r\naway into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. -- ROCCA MARINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     There was of course in Adeline\r\n       A calm patrician polish in the address,\r\n     Which ne\'er can pass the equinoctial line\r\n       Of anything which nature could express.--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a late autumn or winter day, according to the calendar, when The\r\nMorning Star steamed up to the quay of Rocca Marina, but it was hard to\r\nbelieve it, for all the slope of one of the Maritime Alps lay stretched\r\nout basking in the noonday sunshine, green and lovely, wherever not\r\nbroken by the houses below, or the rocks quarried out on the mountain\r\nside. Some snow lay on the further heights, enough to mark their forms,\r\nand contrast with the soft sweetness of the lap of the hills and the\r\nglorious Mediterranean blue.\r\n\r\nAnna and Franceska stood watching and exclaiming in a trance of delight,\r\nas one beauty after another revealed itself--the castellated remnant of\r\nthe old tower, the gabled house with stone balconies and terraces, with\r\nparapets and vases below, the little white spire of the church tower of\r\nthe English colony, looking out of the chestnut and olive groves above,\r\nand the three noble stone pines that sheltered the approach.\r\n\r\nMr. White, in his launch, came out with exulting and hearty welcome to\r\nbring them ashore, through the crowd of feluccas, fishing-vessels, and\r\none or two steamers that filled the tiny bay, and on landing, the party\r\nfound an English wagonette drawn by four stout mules waiting to receive\r\nthem--mules, as being better for the heights than horses.\r\n\r\nAnna and Franceska insisted on walking with Mr. White and Sir Robert,\r\nand they fairly frisked in the delicious air of sea and mountain after\r\nbeing so long cramped on board ship, stopping continually with screams\r\nof delight over violets or anemones, or the views that unfolded\r\nthemselves as they went higher and higher. The path Mr. White chose\r\nwas a good deal steeper than the winding carriage road cut out of the\r\nmountain side, and they arrived before the mules with Mrs. Grinstead and\r\nher brother, at the Italian garden, with a succession of broad terraces\r\nprotected and adorned with open balustrades, with vases of late blooming\r\nflowers at intervals, and broad stone steps, guarded by carved figures,\r\nleading from one to another.\r\n\r\n"It is like Beauty\'s palace," sighed out in delight Francie to her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Beauty," laughed Anna, as at the open window upon the highest\r\nverandah-shaded balcony appeared the darkly handsome Maura and Mrs.\r\nWhite, her small features as pretty as ever, but her figure a good deal\r\nmore embonpoint than in Rockquay times.\r\n\r\nHers was a very warm welcome to the two sisters and their friend, and\r\nto the others who reached the front door a few minutes later. Such an\r\narrival was very pleasant to her, for it must be confessed that, save\r\nfor the English visitors, who were always gladly received, the life at\r\nRocca Marina was a dull one, in spite of its being near enough to San\r\nRemo by the railway for expeditions for a day.\r\n\r\nWithin, the dwelling was a combination of the old Italian palace with\r\nEnglish comforts. Mr. White, in his joy at possessing his graceful\r\nlady wife, had spared no expense in making it a meet bower for her, and\r\nGeraldine was as much amused as fascinated by the exquisiteness of all\r\naround her; as she sat, in a most luxurious chair, looking out through\r\nthe open window at the blue sea, yet with a lively wood fire burning\r\nunder a beauteous mantelpiece; statues, pictures, all that was recherche\r\naround, while they drank their English tea out of almost transparently\r\ndelicate cups, filled by Maura out of a beautifully chased service of\r\nplate on a marble mosaic table.\r\n\r\n"And now you must let me show you your rooms," said Mrs. White. "I\r\nthought you would like to have them en suite, for I am such a poor\r\ncreature that I cannot breakfast down-stairs, and Mr. White is obliged\r\nto be out early."\r\n\r\nSo she led the way through a marble hall, pillared in different colours,\r\nrich and rare, with portraits of ancient Contes and Contessas on the\r\nwalls, up a magnificent stone stair with a carved balustrade, to a\r\nsuite indeed, where, at the entrance, Sibby was found very happy at her\r\nwelcome from Mrs. Mount, who was equally glad to receive a countrywoman.\r\n\r\nThere was a sitting-room with a balcony looking out on the bay, a study\r\nand bedroom beyond for Clement on one side, and on the other charmingly\r\nfitted rooms for Geraldine, for her nieces, and her maid; and Mrs. White\r\nleft them, telling them the dinner hour, and begging them to call freely\r\nand without scruple for all and everything they could wish for. Nothing\r\nwould be any trouble.\r\n\r\n"We have even an English doctor below there," she said, pointing to\r\nthe roofs of the village. "There are so many accidents that Mr. White\r\nthought it better to be provided, so we have a little hospital with a\r\ntrained nurse."\r\n\r\nIt was all very good, very kind, yet the very family likeness to Lilias\r\nMerrifield and Jane Mohun made Geraldine think how much more simple in\r\nmanner one of them would have been without that nouveau riche tone of\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\n"Here is a whole packet of letters," ended Mrs. White, "that came for\r\nyou these last two or three days."\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a writing-table and went away, while the first letters so\r\namazed Geraldine that she could think of nothing else, and hastened to\r\nsummon Clement.\r\n\r\nIt was from Gerald, posted by the pilot from on board the steamer, very\r\nshort, and only saying--\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAREST CHERIE,\r\n\r\n"I know you will forgive me, or rather see that I do not need pardon for\r\nrescuing my sister. Anywhere in England she would be in danger of being\r\nreclaimed to worse than death. Dolores will tell you all the situation,\r\nand I will send a letter as soon as we arrive at New York. No time for\r\nmore, except that I am as much as ever\r\n\r\n"Your own, my Cherie\'s own,\r\n\r\n"GERALD."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere followed directions how to send letters to him through the office\r\nof the \'Censor\'.\r\n\r\nThen she opened, written on the same day, a letter from Dolores Mohun,\r\nsent in obedience to his telegram, when he found that time for details\r\nfailed him. It began--\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAR MRS. GRINSTEAD,\r\n\r\n"I know you will be shocked and grieved at the step that your nephew has\r\ntaken, but when you understand the circumstances, I think you will see\r\nthat it was unavoidable for one of so generous and self-sacrificing a\r\nnature. I may add, that my aunt Lily is much touched, and thoroughly\r\napproves, and my uncle Jasper says imprudence is better than\r\nselfishness."\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this little preamble ensued a full and sensible account of\r\nLudmilla\'s situation and sufferings at the circus, and the history of\r\nher escape, demonstrating (to the writer\'s own satisfaction) that there\r\nwas no other means of securing the poor child.\r\n\r\nOf course the blow to Geraldine was a terrible one.\r\n\r\n"We have lost him," she said.\r\n\r\n"That does not follow," said Clement. "It is quite plain that he does\r\nnot mean to cut himself off from us, and America is not out of reach."\r\n\r\n"It is just the restless impatience that you warned him against. As if\r\nhe could not have taken her to the Hendersons."\r\n\r\n"She would not have been safe there, unless acts of cruelty could have\r\nbeen proved."\r\n\r\n"Or to us, out here."\r\n\r\n"My dear Cherry, imagine his sudden arrival with such an appendage! I\r\nreally think the boy has acted for the best."\r\n\r\n"Giving up Oxford too!"\r\n\r\n"That can be resumed."\r\n\r\n"And most likely that wretched little girl will run off in a month\'s\r\ntime. It is in the blood."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Cherry. I can\'t have you in this uncharitable mood."\r\n\r\n"Then I mustn\'t say what I think of that Dolores abetting him."\r\n\r\n"No, I like her letter."\r\n\r\nIt fell hard upon Geraldine to keep all to herself, while entertained in\r\nfull state by her hosts. Perhaps Adeline would have liked something on a\r\nsmaller scale, for she knew what was ostentatious; but though Mr. White\r\nhad once lived in a corner of the castle, almost like an artisan; since\r\nhe had married, it had become his pride to treat his guests on the\r\ngrandest London scale, and the presence of Sir Robert Audley for one\r\nnight evoked all his splendours. He made excuses for having no one to\r\nmeet the party but the chaplain and his wife and the young doctor, who\r\nhe patronizingly assured them was "quite the gentleman," and Theodore\r\nWhite--"Just to fill up a corner and amuse the young ladies." Theodore\r\nhad been lately sent out, now a clerk, soon to be a partner; but he was\r\nvery shy, and did not amuse the young ladies at all! Indeed, he was soon\r\nso smitten with admiration for Franceska, that he could do nothing but\r\nsit rapt, looking at her under his eyelids.\r\n\r\nThe chaplain had received an offer of preferment in England, and was\r\nanxious to go home as soon as possible. Clement was now so well, that\r\nafter assisting the next day in the week\'s duties among the people, and\r\nat the pretty little church that Mr. White had built, he ventured to\r\naccept the proposal of becoming a substitute until the decision was made\r\nor another chaplain found. He was very happy to be employed once more in\r\nhis vocation.\r\n\r\nThe climate suited him exactly, and the loan of the chaplain\'s house\r\nwould relieve him and Geraldine from the rather oppressive hospitality\r\nof the castle. The search for Benista\'s antecedents would of course go\r\non with the assistance of Mr. White and his Italian foreman, but both\r\nassured him that the inquiry might be protracted, as winter was likely\r\nto cut off the communications with many parts of the interior, and many\r\nof the men would be at their distant homes till the spring advanced.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Geraldine and her nieces had a home life, reading, studying\r\nItalian, drawing with endless pleasure, and the young ones walking about\r\nthe chestnut-covered slopes. She sat in the gardens or drove with Mrs.\r\nWhite in her donkey-chaise, and would have been full of enjoyment but\r\nfor the abiding anxiety about Gerald. It was rather a relief not to\r\nbe living in the same house with the Whites, whose hospitality and\r\nmagnificence were rather oppressive. Mr. White wanted to have everything\r\nadmired, and its cost appreciated; and Adeline, though clever enough,\r\nhad provoking similarities and dissimilarities to her sisters. The same\r\nmight be said of Maura, to whom Francie at first took a great fancy, but\r\nAnna, who had seen more of the world, had a sense of distrust.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something fawning about her ways," said she, "and I don\'t know\r\nwhether she is quite sincere."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is only being half Greek," said Geraldine.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two families met every day, and Mrs. White called their\r\nintercourse "such a boon, such a charming friendship," all unaware that\r\nthere was no real confidence or affection.\r\n\r\nThey had not long been seated when the little Italian messenger boy\r\nbrought them a budget of letters. Of course the first that Geraldine\r\nopened was in her nephew\'s writing. It had been written at intervals\r\nthroughout the voyage, and finished on landing at New York.\r\n\r\nPassing over the expressions of unabated affection, and explanation of\r\nthe need of removing Ludmilla out of reach of her natural guardians,\r\nwith the date on the second day of the voyage, the diary continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Whom, as the fates would have it, should I have encountered but the\r\nCacique! Yes, old Fernan and Marilda have the stateliest of staterooms\r\nin this same liner, and he was as much taken aback as I was when we ran\r\nagainst one another over a destitute and disconsolate Irish family in\r\nthe steerage. Marilda is as yet invisible, as is my poor little Lida. It\r\nis unlucky, for the good man is profuse in his offers of patronage, and\r\nI don\'t mean to be patronized."\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, after some clever descriptions of the fellow second-class\r\npassengers in his own lively vein, perhaps a little forced, so as not\r\nto betray more than he intended, that he felt them uncongenial, there\r\ncame--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Lida is up again; she is a sweet little patient person, and I cannot\r\nwithstand Fernan\'s wish to present her to his wife, who remains\r\nprostrate at present, and will till we get out of the present stiff\r\nbreeze and its influences.\r\n\r\n"12th.--The presentation is over, and it has ended in Lida devoting\r\nherself to the succour of Marilda, and likewise of her maid, who is a\r\ngood deal worse than herself.\r\n\r\n       *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n"16th.--These amiable folks want to take Lida off with them, not to say\r\nmyself, to their \'Underwood\' in the Rockies; but I don\'t intend her to\r\nbe semi-lady\'s-maid, semi-companion, as she is becoming, but to let\r\nher stand on her own legs, or mine, and put her to a good school at New\r\nYork. I have finished an article on \'Transatlantic Travellers\' for the\r\n\'Censor\', also some reviews, and another paper that may pave my way to\r\nwork in New York or elsewhere. My craving is for the work of hard hands,\r\nbut I look at mine, and fear I run more to the brain than the hands. My\r\nfather must have been of finer physique than the Sioux bullet left to\r\nme; but I have no fears."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," sighed Geraldine; "he has not the fine athletic strength\r\nof his dear father, but still--still I think there is that in him which\r\nEdgar had not."\r\n\r\n"Force of character," said Clement, "even if he is wrong-headed. Here is\r\nFernan\'s letter--\r\n\r\n\r\n"\'Imagine my amazement at finding Gerald on board with us. He tells me\r\nthat you are aware of his escapade, so I need not explain it. He is\r\nnot very gracious to either of us, and absolutely refuses all offers of\r\nassistance either for himself or his sister. However, I hope to be able\r\nto keep a certain watch over him without offending him, and to obviate\r\nsome of the difficulties in his way, perhaps unknown to him. Marilda\r\nhas, as usual, suffered greatly on the voyage, but the little Lida, as\r\nhe calls her, has been most attentive and useful both to her and her\r\nmaid, who was quite helpless, and much the worst of the two. My wife was\r\nmuch prejudiced against Lida at first, but has become very fond of her,\r\nand is sure that she is a thoroughly good girl--worth the sacrifice\r\nGerald has made for her. In his independent mood, he will not hear\r\nof our offering a home to the poor child; but if, as I hope, your\r\nresearches turn out in his favour, he may consent to let us find\r\nsuitable education for her. At any rate, I promise Geraldine not to\r\nleave these two young things to their fate, though I may have to act\r\nsecretly. I can never forget how I took him from his father\'s side, and\r\nthe baptism almost in blood. We go to New Orleans first, and after the\r\ncold weather home, but letters to the Bank will find us.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good, dear old Fernan and Marilda!" cried Geraldine, "I can see their\r\nkindness, and how, with all their goodness, it must jar on Gerald\'s\r\nnerves."\r\n\r\n"I hope he won\'t be an ass," returned Clement. "Such patient goodness\r\nought not to be snubbed by--" He caught his sister\'s eye, and made his\r\nlast words "youthful theorists."\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson too forwarded a letter from Lida, being sure that it\r\nwould be a great pleasure to Mrs. Grinstead. It went into many more\r\nparticulars about the miseries of the circus training than had been\r\nknown before, and the fears and hints which made it plain that it had\r\nbeen quite right to avail herself of the means of escape; after which\r\nwas added--\r\n\r\n\r\n"I never thought to be so happy as I am here. My brother is the noblest,\r\nmost generous, most kind of creatures, and that he should do all this\r\nfor me, after all the harm he has suffered from my poor mother! It quite\r\noverpowers me when I think of it. I see a tear has dropped, but it is\r\nsuch a happy one. Please tell Mr. Flight what peace and joy this is to\r\nme, after all my prayers and trying to mind what he said. There are such\r\na gentleman and lady here, cousins to my brother, Sir Ferdinand and Lady\r\nTravis Underwood. She has been more or less ill all through the voyage,\r\nand her maid worse, and she has let me do what I could for her, and\r\nhas been kindness itself. They were at the bazaar. Did you see Sir\r\nFerdinand? He is the very grandest and handsomest man I ever did see,\r\nand so good to all the poor emigrants in the steerage. He is very kind\r\nto me; but I see that my brother will not have me presume. They have\r\nbidden me write to them in any need. I never thought there could be so\r\nmany good people out of Rockquay. Please give my duty to Mr. Flight and\r\nLady Flight, good Miss Mohun, and dear Miss Dolores. I wear her ulster,\r\nand bless the thought of her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. -- ROWENA AND HER RIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     And yet if each the other\'s name\r\n       In some unguarded moment heard,\r\n     The heart that once you thought so tame\r\n       Would flutter like a wounded bird.--ANON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters continued to come with fair regularity; and it was understood\r\nthat Gerald, with Lida, had taken up his quarters in an\r\n"inexpensive" boarding-house at New York, where he had sent Lida to a\r\nhighly-recommended day-school, and he was looking out for employment.\r\nHis articles had been accepted, he said; but the accounts of his\r\nadventures and of his fellow-inmates gave the sense that there was more\r\nhumour in the retrospect than in the society, and that they were better\r\nto write about than to live with. He never confessed it, but to his\r\naunt, who understood him, it was plain that he found it a different\r\nthing to talk philanthropic socialism, or even to work among the poor,\r\nand to live in the society of the unrefined equals.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote that Lida had come one day and told him that one of the\r\ngirls, with whom she had made friends, had a bad attack of cough and\r\nbronchitis, and could not fulfil an engagement that she had made to come\r\nand sing for a person who was giving lectures upon national music. "\'I\r\nlooked at some of her songs,\' little Lida said in her humble way, \'and\r\nI know them. Don\'t you think, brother, I might take her part?\' Well, not\r\nto put too fine a point upon it, it was not an unwelcome notion, for my\r\narticles, though accepted, don\'t bring in the speedy remuneration with\r\nwhich fiction beguiles the aspirant. Only one of them, which I send you,\r\nhas seen the light, and the \'Censor\' is slow, though sure, so dollars\r\nfor immediate expenses run short. I called on the fellow, Mr. Gracchus\r\nB. Van Tromp, to see whether he were fit company for my sister, and I\r\nfound him much superior to his name--gentlemanlike and intelligent, not\r\nill-read, and pretty safe, like most Yankees, to know how to behave to a\r\nyoung girl. When he found I could accompany my sister on piano or violin\r\nhe was transported. Moreover, he could endure to be enlightened by a\r\nBritisher on such little facts as the true history of Auld Robin Gray\r\nand the Wacht am Rhein. The lecture was a marked success. We have\r\nanother tonight, 16th. It has resulted in a proposal to these two\r\ninteresting performers to accompany the great Gracchus on a tour through\r\nthe leading \'cities,\' lecturing by turns with him and assisting. He\r\nhas hitherto picked up as he could \'local talent,\' but is glad of less\r\nuncertain help, and so far as appears, he is superior to jealousy,\r\nthough he sees that I\'m better read, \'and of the cut that takes the\r\nladies.\' It is no harm for Lida; she was not learning much, and I can\r\ncultivate her better when I have her to myself, and get her not to\r\nregard me so much like a lion, to be honoured with distant respect and\r\nobedience. We shall get dollars enough to keep us going till my talents\r\nbreak upon the world, and obtain stunning experiences for the \'Censor\'.\r\nMy father\'s dear old violin is coming to the front. Our first start will\r\nbe at Boston; but continue to write to Gerald F. Wood, care of Editor of\r\n\'Cole\'s Weekly\'."\r\n\r\n"How like his father!" was the natural exclamation; but the details that\r\nfollowed in another week were fairly satisfactory, and the spirit of\r\nindependence was a sound one, which had stood harder proofs than perhaps\r\nhis home was allowed to know, though these were early days.\r\n\r\nFebruary was beginning to open the buds and to fill the slopes with\r\ndelicate anemones, as well as to bring back Mr. White\'s workmen, among\r\nwhom Clement could make inquiries. One young man knew the name of\r\nBenista as belonging to a family in a valley beyond his own, but it was\r\nnot an easily accessible one, and a fresh fall of snow had choked the\r\nravine, and would do so for weeks to come.\r\n\r\nYet all was lovely on the coast, and Mr. White having occasion to go to\r\nSan Remo, offered to take the three girls with him.\r\n\r\n"Young ladies always have a turn for shops," said he.\r\n\r\n"I want to see the coast," said Franceska, with a little dignity.\r\n\r\n"But I do want some gloves--and some blue embroidery silk, thank you,\r\nMr. White," said Anna, more courteously.\r\n\r\n"And I want some handkerchiefs, if Mr. White will take me too!" returned\r\nUncle Clement in the same tone.\r\n\r\n"I know so well what you mean, dear," observed Maura, sotto voce to\r\nFrancie. "It is so trying to be supposed mere common-place, when one\'s\r\nthoughts are on the beautiful and romantic."\r\n\r\nIt was just one of the sayings that had begun to go against Francie\'s\r\ntaste, and she answered--\r\n\r\n"Mr. White is very good-natured."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, but so--so--you know."\r\n\r\nFrancie was called, and left Mr. White\'s description to be unutterable.\r\n\r\nThe two elder ladies spent the day together, and Mrs. Grinstead then\r\nheard that Jane Mohun had written, that both Lord Ivinghoe and Lady\r\nPhyllis Devereux were recovering from the influenza, and that Lord\r\nRotherwood had had a slight touch of the complaint.\r\n\r\n"It is a very serious thing in our family," said Adeline, with all the\r\nsatisfaction of having a family, especially with a complaint, and she\r\nbegan to enumerate the victims of the Devereux house and her own, only\r\nbreaking off to exclaim, "I really shall write at once to beg them all\r\nto come here for the rest of the winter, March winds and all. My cousin\r\nRotherwood has never been here, and they might be quite quiet among\r\nrelations. So unlike a common health resort."\r\n\r\nMrs. White\'s hospitable anticipations were forestalled. The party came\r\nhome from San Remo in high spirits. They had met Lord Rotherwood and\r\nhis son in the street, they had been greeted most warmly, and brought\r\nto luncheon at the villa, where they found not only Lady Rotherwood and\r\nPhyllis, but Mysie Merrifield.\r\n\r\nIt was explained that their London doctor had strongly advised immediate\r\ntransplantation before there was time to catch fresh colds, and a friend\r\nof the Marchioness, who permanently possessed a charming house at San\r\nRemo, had offered it just as it was for the spring. The journey had been\r\nmade at once, with one deviation on Lord Rotherwood\'s part, to beg for\r\nMysie, as an essential requisite to his "Fly\'s" perfect recovery. A\r\nvisit had been due before, only deferred by the general illness, and no\r\ndifficulty was made in letting it be paid in these new and delightful\r\nscenes. Phyllis had been there before. She was weak and languid, and\r\nwould much rather have stayed at home, except for seeing Mysie\'s delight\r\nin the mountains and the blue Mediterranean, which she dimly remembered\r\nfrom her infancy at Malta. Only she made it a point of honour not to\r\nallow that the sea was bluer than the bay of Rockquay.\r\n\r\nIvinghoe was looking ill and disgusted, but brightened up at the sight\r\nof the visitors, and his mother, who thought Monte Carlo too near,\r\nthough she had kept as far from it as possible, accepted the more\r\nwillingly Mr. White\'s cordial invitation to come and spend a day or two\r\nat Rocca Marina. Trifles were so much out of the good lady\'s focus of\r\nvision that the possible dangers in that quarter never occurred to her,\r\nthough Maura was demurely bridling, and Francie, all unawakened, but\r\nprettier than ever, was actually wearing a scarlet anemone that Ivinghoe\r\nhad given to her.\r\n\r\nIn the intervening days, Rocca Marina was in a wonderful state of\r\npreparation. The master of it was genuinely and honestly kindly and\r\nsimple-hearted, and had entertained noble travellers before, who had\r\nbeen attracted by his extensive and artistic works; but no words can\r\ndescribe the satisfaction of his wife. In part there was the heartfelt\r\npleasure of receiving the cousin who had been like one of her brothers\r\nin the home of her childhood; but to this was added the glory of knowing\r\nthat this same cousin was a marquis, and that the society of San Remo,\r\nnay of all the Riviera and the Italian papers to boot, would know that\r\nshe was a good deal more than the quarry-owner\'s wife. Moreover, like\r\nall her family, there was a sense of Lady Rotherwood\'s coming from a\r\ndifferent sphere, and treating them with condescension. Jane and Lily\r\nmight laugh, but to Adeline it was matter of a sort of aggressive awe,\r\nhalf as asserting herself as "Victoria\'s" equal and relation, half as\r\nprotecting her from inferior people.\r\n\r\nGeraldine perceived and was secretly amused. Of course all the party\r\ndined at the castle on Saturday night, and heard some lamentations that\r\nthere was no one else to meet the distinguished guests, for the young\r\ndoctor was not thought worthy.\r\n\r\n"But I knew you would like a family party best, and the Underwoods\r\nare--almost connections, though--"\r\n\r\nIn that "though" was conveyed their vast inferiority to the house of\r\nMohun.\r\n\r\n"I always understood that it was a very good old family," said Lady\r\nRotherwood.\r\n\r\n"Clement Underwood is one of the most valuable clergy in London," said\r\nher lord; "I am glad he is recovering. I shall be delighted to hear him\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nMaura was standing under the pergola with Lord Ivinghoe.\r\n\r\n"And is not it sad for poor Franceska Vanderkist?--Oh! you know about\r\npoor Mr. Gerald Underwood?" said Maura, blushing a little at the awkward\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Ivinghoe impatiently. "He is in America, is he not?\r\nBut what has she to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know, after being his Mona, and all. It can\'t go any further\r\ntill it is cleared up."\r\n\r\nPhyllis and Mysie came up, asking Maura to tell them the name of a\r\nmountain peak with a white cap. The party came up to dinner, which was\r\nas genial and easy as the host and Lord Rotherwood could make it, and as\r\nstiff and grand as the hostess could accomplish, aided by the deftness\r\nand grace of her Italian servants. In the evening Theodore came up to\r\nassist in the singing of glees, and Clement\'s voice was a delightful and\r\nwelcome sound in his sister\'s ears. Ivinghoe stood among the circle at\r\nthe piano, and enjoyed. He and his sister were not particularly musical,\r\nbut enough to enjoy those remarkable Underwood voices. After that Maura\r\nnever promoted musical evenings.\r\n\r\nAn odd little Sunday-school for the children of the English workmen had\r\nbeen instituted at Rocca Marina, where Maura had always assisted the\r\nchaplain\'s wife, and Anna and Francie shared the work. Mysie heard of it\r\nwith enthusiasm, for, as Ivinghoe told her, she was pining for a breath\r\nof the atmosphere, but she came down to enjoy the delights thereof\r\nalone, taking Maura\'s small class. Maura was supposed to be doing the\r\npolite to Lady Phyllis, but in point of fact Phyllis was lying down\r\nin the balcony of her mother\'s dressing-room, and Maura was gracefully\r\nfanning herself under a great cork tree, while Lord Ivinghoe was lying\r\non the grass.\r\n\r\nFrancie looked languid, and said it was getting dreadfully hot, but\r\nMrs. Grinstead took no notice, trusting that the cessation of attentions\r\nwould hinder any feeling from going deeper, so that--as she could not\r\nhelp saying to herself--she might not have brought the poor child out of\r\nthe frying-pan into the fire--not an elegant proverb, but expressing her\r\nfeeling!\r\n\r\nMore especially did it do so, when she found that Lord Rotherwood was\r\nso much delighted with the beauty and variety of the marbles of Rocca\r\nMarina as to order a font to be made of them for the church that was\r\nbeing restored at Clarebridge, and he, and still more his son, found\r\nconstant diversion in running over by train from San Remo to superintend\r\nthe design, and to select the different colours and patterns of the\r\nstones as they were quarried out and bits polished so as to show their\r\nbeauty. Their ladies often accompanied them, and these expeditions\r\ngenerally involved luncheon at the castle, and often tea at the\r\nparsonage, but it might be gradually observed, as time went on, that\r\nthere was a shade of annoyance on the part of the great house at the\r\npreference sometimes unconsciously shown for the society of the smaller\r\none.\r\n\r\nMysie openly claimed Anna as her own friend of some standing, and\r\nboth she and Phyllis had books to discuss, botanical or geological\r\ndiscoveries to communicate or puzzle out, with Mrs. Grinstead or her\r\nnieces. Lord Rotherwood had many more interests in common with Clement\r\nUnderwood than with Mr. White, and even the Marchioness, though more\r\nimpartial and on her guard, was sensible to Mrs. Grinstead\'s charm of\r\nmanner and depth of comprehension. She patronized Adeline, but respected\r\nMrs. Grinstead as incapable of and insensible to patronage.\r\n\r\nThat her gentlemen should have found such safe and absorbing occupation\r\nin the opposite direction to Monte Carlo was an abiding satisfaction\r\nto her, and she did not analyze the charms of the place as regarded her\r\nson. She had seen him amused by other young ladies, as he certainly was\r\nnow by that Miss White, who was very handsome and very obliging.\r\n\r\nShe knew and he knew all the antecedents too well for alarm, till one\r\nday she saw Maura\'s face, as she made him pull down a spray of banksia\r\nfrom the side of a stone wall, and watched the air of gallant courtesy\r\nwith which he presented it.\r\n\r\nFrancie watched it too, as she had watched the like before, and said\r\nnothing, but there was an odd, dull sense of disappointment, and the\r\nglory had faded away from sea and sky, spring though it was. Yet there\r\nwere pressures of the hand in greeting and parting, and kind, wistful\r\nlooks, as if of sympathy, little services and little attentions, that\r\nset her foolish little heart bounding, in a way she was much ashamed\r\nto feel, and would have been more utterly ashamed to speak of, or to\r\nsuppose observed. She only avowed to Anna that it was very warm, weary\r\nweather, and that she was tired of absence, and felt homesick, but Aunt\r\nCherry was so kind that she must not be told.\r\n\r\nLady Rotherwood proposed moving away, but her husband and son would not\r\nhear of it till their font was finished.\r\n\r\nIt was not unwelcome to any one of the elder ladies that the young\r\nofficer\'s leave would be over in another week. Geraldine was glad that\r\nFrancie should be freed from the trial of seeing attention absorbed by\r\nMaura, and herself so often left in the lurch, so far as that young lady\r\ncould contrive it, for though not a word was said, the brightened eye\r\nand glowing cheek, whenever Lord Ivinghoe brought her forward, or paid\r\nher any deference or civility, were dangerous symptoms. Peace of mind\r\nin so modest and innocent a maiden would probably come back when the\r\nexcitement was once over.\r\n\r\nAs to Adeline, there was nothing she dreaded so much as the commotion\r\nthat would be excited if Ivinghoe\'s flirtation came to any crisis. His\r\nmother would never forgive her, his father would hardly do so; she would\r\nfeel like a traitor to the whole family, and all her attempts to put a\r\ncheck on endeavours on Maura\'s part to draw him on--an endeavour that\r\nbegan to be visible to her--were met by apparent unconsciousness or by\r\ntears. And when she ventured a word to her husband, he gruffly answered\r\nthat his niece\'s father had been an officer in the army, and he could\r\nmake it worth any one\'s while to take her! Young lords were glad enough\r\nin these days to have something to put into their pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. -- DREAMS AND NIGHTINGALES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Then in that time and place I spoke to her.--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Office of \'Lacustrian Intelligencer,\'\r\n\r\n"Jonesville, Ohio,\r\n\r\n"March 20.\r\n\r\n"DEAREST CHERIE,\r\n\r\n"I told you in my last that the chief boss in the office at New York had\r\nwritten to me that he had been asked to send an intelligent young man\r\nto sub-edit the Lacustrian Intelligencer at Jonesville, a rising city on\r\nLake Erie. I thought it would be worth while to look at it, especially\r\nas we were booked to give a lecture at Sandusky, and moreover our\r\nrelations to Gracchus have been growing rather strained, and I do not\r\nthink this wandering life good for Lida in the long run; nor are my\r\narticles paid enough for to be a dependence. So after holding forth\r\nat Sandusky, we took our passage in a little steamer which crosses the\r\nlittle bay in the Lake to Jonesville--one of those steamers just like a\r\nNoah\'s Ark.\r\n\r\n"Presently Lida came up and touched me, saying in her little awestruck\r\nwhisper (which has never been conquered), \'Brother, I am sure I saw one\r\nof mother\'s cigarettes.\' I said \'Bosh!\' thinking it an utter delusion;\r\nbut she was so decided and so frightened, that I told her to go into the\r\nsaloon, and went forward. A woman was going about the deck, offering the\r\npassengers a basket of candies, lights, cigarettes, and cigars. Saving\r\nfor Lida\'s words, I never should have recognized her; she was thin\r\nto the last degree, haggard, yellow, excessively shabby and\r\nforlorn-looking, and with a hollow cough; but as her eyes met mine\r\n(those eyes that you say are our water-mark) both of us made a sort of\r\nleap as if to go overboard, and I went up to her at once, and would have\r\nspoken, but she cried out, \'What have you done with Lida?\' I answered\r\nthat she was safe, and demanded in my turn where were O\'Leary and\r\nJellicoe. \'Drowned, drowned,\' she said, \'in the wreck of the Sirius.\r\nThey\'ll never trouble you more. But Lida!\' I thought that it was safe to\r\ntake her into the saloon to see Lida, when they fell into each other\'s\r\narms, and afforded the spectators a romantic spectacle. Don\'t think I\r\nam making a joke of it, for it was tragic enough in the result of the\r\nagitation. Blood was choking the poor woman. We could only lay her\r\ndown on the couch, and happily there were lemons on board. There was\r\na good-natured Irishman who gave me all the help he could, even to the\r\ncarrying her to his house, where his wife was equally kind. He fetched\r\nthe priest, a French Canadian, and the doctor, and Lida has been\r\nwatching over her most tenderly; poor things--they seem really to have\r\ncared for one another, and Lida will be the happier for having done\r\nthese last duties.\r\n\r\n"21st. She is a little better. So far as we have gathered from one who\r\nmust not talk nor be agitated, the circus had got into difficulties and\r\ndebt to Bast, the van proprietor. I believe Lida\'s voice was their last\r\nhope, and they had some ghastly scheme of disposing of her in Belgium.\r\nWhen they lost her, their chances were over, and with the proceeds of\r\ntheir last exhibition, Jellicoe and the O\'Leary pair left the elephant,\r\netc., to take care of themselves and make their excuses to Mr. Bast, and\r\nstarted for Liverpool and the U. S. in the Sirius. Storms overtook\r\nthem, the women were put into the first boat, those which followed were\r\nswamped. Poor fellows, I own I can\'t sing a pious dirge for them. There\r\nwere three days of hunger and exposure before the boat was picked\r\nup, and she was finally landed at Quebec, where she was laid up with\r\npleurisy in the hospital. And there was a subscription for the wrecked\r\nwhen she came out, which enabled her to set up this reminiscence of her\r\nold trade, drifting from one pier or boat to another till she came to\r\nthis one, but all the time with this awful cough. The doctor thinks it\r\nher knell; her lungs are far gone, but she may probably rally in some\r\ndegree for the summer, though hardly so as to be moved.\r\n\r\n"That being the case, I have been to the Lacustrian office, and engaged\r\nmyself to be its hack, since I must have some fixed pay while she lives.\r\nPerhaps I shall be able to do a little extra writing and lecturing,\r\nespecially if she gets better, enough to spare Lida to help me. Her\r\nvoice really is a lovely soprano, and draws wonderfully, but I don\'t\r\nwant it to be strained too early. Our good Irishwoman, Mrs. Macbride, is\r\nwilling to let us have her two rooms, left empty by her sons going west,\r\nand her daughter marrying, on fair terms, Lida promising to be a sort\r\nof help and to teach the children. We shall eat with them. I shall be at\r\nthe office all day and half the night, so I don\'t need a sitting-room.\r\nDon\'t be anxious, dear old Cherie. We shall do very well, and it is only\r\nfor a time. Lida is like a little angel, and as thankful for a smile\r\nfrom her mother as if she had been the reprobate runaway.\r\n\r\n"Your ever-loving\r\n\r\n"GERALD."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the letter that came to Mrs. Grinstead, and one with similar\r\ninformation went to Dolores Mohun at her college at Cambridge. Dolores,\r\nwho had found Mysie much more sympathetic than Gillian, could not but\r\nwrite the intelligence to her, and Mysie was so much struck with the\r\nbeauty of the much-injured brother and sister devoting themselves\r\nto their mother, that she could not help telling the family party at\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Lord Rotherwood. "The mother can clear up the doubt\r\nif any one can. Is there nothing about it?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mysie; "I should think the poor woman was too ill to be\r\nasked."\r\n\r\n"They must not let her slip through their fingers without telling,"\r\nadded Ivinghoe.\r\n\r\n"I have a mind to run over to Rocca Marina and see what more they have\r\nheard there," said Lord Rotherwood. "I suppose your letter is from one\r\nof the girls there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it is from Dolores."\r\n\r\n"Dolores! She is at Cambridge. Then this news must have been round by\r\nClipstone! They must have known it for days past at Rocca!" exclaimed\r\nLord Rotherwood.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mysie, "this came direct to Dolores from Gerald Underwood\r\nhimself.--Oh, didn\'t you know? I forgot, nobody was to know till Uncle\r\nMaurice gave his consent."\r\n\r\n"Consent to what?" exclaimed Ivinghoe.\r\n\r\n"To Dolores and Gerald! Oh dear, mamma said so much to me about not\r\ntelling, but I did think Cousin Rotherwood knew everything. Please--"\r\n\r\nWhatever she was going to ask was cut short by Ivinghoe\'s suddenly\r\nstriking on the table so as to make all the cups and saucers ring as he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"If ever there lived a treacherous Greek minx!" Then, "I beg your\r\npardon, mother."\r\n\r\nHe was off: they saw him dash out of the house. There was a train due\r\nnearly at this time, as all recollected.\r\n\r\n"Papa, had not you better go with him?" said Lady Rotherwood.\r\n\r\n"He will get on much better by himself, my dear," and Lord Rotherwood\r\nthrew himself back in his chair and laughed heartily and merrily, to the\r\namazement and mystification of the two girls. "You will have a beauty on\r\nyour hands, my lady."\r\n\r\n"Well, as long as it is not that horrid White girl--" said her ladyship,\r\nbreaking off there.\r\n\r\n"A very sorry Rebecca," said her lord, laughing the more.\r\n\r\nBut the Marchioness rose up, and the two cousins had to accept the\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\nThe train, after the leisurely fashion of continental railways,\r\nkept Ivinghoe fuming at the station, and rattled along so as to give\r\ntravellers a full view of the coast, more delightful to them than to\r\nthe youth, who had rushed off with intentions, he scarce knew what, of\r\nsetting right the consequences of Maura\'s--was it deception, or only a\r\nthought, of which the wish was father?\r\n\r\nHe reached the station that led to the works at Rocca Marina. The sun\r\nwas high, the heat of the day coming on, and as he strode along, the\r\nworkmen were leaving off to take their siesta at noontide. On he went,\r\nacross the private walks in the terraced garden, not up the broad stone\r\nsteps that led to the house, but to a little group of olive trees which\r\ncut off the chaplain\'s house from the castle gardens, and where stood\r\na great cork tree, to whose branches a hammock had been fastened, and\r\nseats placed under it. As he opened the gate a little dog\'s bark was\r\nheard, and he was aware of a broad hat under the tree. Simultaneously a\r\nsmall Maltese dog sprang forward, and Francie\'s head rose from leaning\r\nover the little table with a start, her cheeks deeper rose than usual,\r\nhaving evidently gone to sleep over the thin book and big dictionary\r\nthat lay before her.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she said, "it is you. Was I dreaming?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I startled you."\r\n\r\n"No--only"--she still seemed only half awake--"it seemed to come out of\r\nmy dream."\r\n\r\n"Then you were dreaming of me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. At, least I don\'t know," she said, the colour flushing into her\r\nface, as she sat upright, now quite awake and alive to the question,\r\nbetween truthfulness and maidenly modesty.\r\n\r\n"You were--you were; you don\'t deny it!" And as she hung her head and\r\ngrew more distressfully redder and redder, "You know what that means."\r\n\r\n"Indeed--indeed--I couldn\'t help--I never meant! Oh--"\r\n\r\nIt was an exclamation indeed, for Uncle Clement\'s head appeared above\r\nthe hammock, where he too had been dozing over his book, with the\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n"Halloo, young people, I\'m here!"\r\n\r\nFranceska would have fled, but Ivinghoe held her hand so tight that she\r\ncould not wrench it away. He held it, while Clement struggled to the\r\nground, and then said--\r\n\r\n"Sir, there is no reason you or all the world should not know how I love\r\nthis dearest, loveliest one. I came here this morning hoping that she\r\nmay grant me leave to try to win her to be my own."\r\n\r\nHe looked at Francie. Her head drooped, but she had not taken her hand\r\naway, and the look on her face was not all embarrassment, but there was\r\na rosy sunrise dawning on it.\r\n\r\nAll Clement could say was something of "Your father."\r\n\r\n"He knows, he understands; I saw it in his eyes," said Ivinghoe.\r\n\r\nTo Clement the surprise was far greater than it would have been to his\r\nsister, and the experience was almost new to him, but he could read\r\nFrancie\'s face well enough to say--\r\n\r\n"My dear, I think we had better let you run in and compose yourself, or\r\ngo to your aunt, while I talk to Lord Ivinghoe."\r\n\r\nTrembling, frightened, Francie was really glad to be released, as her\r\nlover with one pressure said--\r\n\r\n"I shall see you again, sweetest."\r\n\r\nShe darted away, and Clement signed to Ivinghoe to sit down with him on\r\nthe bench under the tree.\r\n\r\n"I should like this better if you had brought your father\'s full\r\nassent," he said.\r\n\r\n"There was no time. I only read his face; he will come to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"No time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to catch the train. I hurried away the moment I learnt that--that\r\nher affections were not otherwise engaged. I never saw any one like her.\r\nShe has haunted me ever since those days at Rockquay; but--but I was\r\ntold that she cared for your nephew, and I could not take advantage of\r\nhim in his absence. And now I have but three days more."\r\n\r\n"Whoever told you was under a great error," said Clement gravely, "and\r\nyou have shown very generous self-command; but the advantages of this\r\naffair are so much the greatest on one side, that you cannot wonder if\r\nthere is hesitation on our part, till we explicitly know that our poor\r\nlittle girl would not be unwelcome to your parents."\r\n\r\n"I know that no one can compare with her for--for everything and\r\nanything," stammered Ivinghoe, breaking from his mother\'s language into\r\nhis father\'s, "and my father admires her as much as I do--almost."\r\n\r\n"But what will he and your mother say to her being absolutely\r\npenniless?"\r\n\r\n"Pish!"\r\n\r\n"And worse--child to a spendthrift, a man of no connection, except on\r\nhis mother\'s side."\r\n\r\n"She is your niece, your family have bred her up, made her so much more\r\nthan exquisitely lovely."\r\n\r\n"She is a good little girl," said Clement, "but what are we? No,\r\nIvinghoe, I do not blame you for speaking out, and she will be the\r\nhappier for the knowledge of your affection, but it will not be right of\r\nus to give free consent, without being fully assured of that of Lord and\r\nLady Rotherwood."\r\n\r\nIvinghoe could only protest, but Clement rose to walk to the house,\r\nwhere his sister was sitting under the pergola in the agitation of\r\nanswering Gerald\'s letter, and had only seen Francie flit by, calling\r\nto her sister in a voice that now struck her as having been strange and\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nClement trusted a good deal to his sister\'s quicker perceptions and\r\nhabit of observation to guide his opinion in the affair that had burst\r\non him, and was relieved that when Ivinghoe, like the well-bred young\r\nman that he was, went up to her, and taking her hand said, "I have been\r\nventuring to put my fate into the hands of your niece," she did not seem\r\nastonished or overwhelmed, but said--\r\n\r\n"She is a dear good girl; I do hope it will be for her happiness--for\r\nboth."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said fervently. "It will be the most earnest desire of\r\nmy life."\r\n\r\nGeraldine thought it best to go in quest of Francie, whom she found with\r\nAnna, incoherent and happy in the glory of the certainty that she was\r\nloved, after the long trial of suppressed, unacknowledged suspense. No\r\nfears of parents, no thought of inequalities had occurred to trouble\r\nher--everything was absorbed in the one thought--"he really did love\r\nher." How should she thank God enough, or pray enough to be worthy of\r\nsuch joy? There was no room for vexation or wonder at the delay, nor\r\nthe attentions paid to Maura. She hushed Anna, who was inclined to be\r\nindignant, and who was obliged afterwards to pour out to her aunt all\r\nher wonder, though she allowed that on his side there was nothing to be\r\nreally called flirtation, it was all Maura--"she was sure Maura was at\r\nthe bottom of it."\r\n\r\n"My dear, don\'t let us be uncharitable; there is no need to think about\r\nit. Let us try to be like Francie, and swallow all up in gladness. Your\r\nmother--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t think what she will do for joy. It will almost make her\r\nwell again."\r\n\r\n"But remember, we don\'t know what his parents will say."\r\n\r\nAnd with that sobering thought they had to go down to luncheon, where\r\nFrancie sat blushing and entranced, too happy to speak, and Ivinghoe\r\napparently contented to look at her. Afterwards he was allowed to take\r\npossession of her for the afternoon, so as to be able to tease her about\r\nwhat she was dreaming about him. After all it had probably been evoked\r\nby the dog\'s bark and his step; for she had thought a wolf was pursuing\r\nher, and that he had come to save her. It was quite enough to be food\r\nfor a lover.\r\n\r\nClement would have wished to keep all to themselves, at least till the\r\npaternal visit was over, but Ivinghoe\'s days were few, and he made sure\r\nof bringing his parents on the morrow. An expedition had been arranged\r\nto the valley where some of the Benista family were reported to live,\r\nsince the snows had departed enough for safety; but this must needs be\r\ndeferred, and there was no doubt that the "reason why" would be sought\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so close was the great house, and so minute a watch was kept,\r\nthat the fact of Lord Ivinghoe\'s spending the whole day at the parsonage\r\nwas known, and conclusions were arrived at. Maura stole down in the late\r\nevening among the olive trees, ostensibly to ask Anna and Francie to\r\ncome and listen to the nightingales.\r\n\r\nBut thereby she was witness to a scene that showed that there was\r\nanother nightingale for Franceska than the one who was singing with such\r\nenergy among the olive boughs. In fact, she saw the evening farewell,\r\nand had not the discretion, like Anna, to withdraw herself and her eyes,\r\nbut beheld, what had ever been sacred to both those young things, the\r\nfirst kiss.\r\n\r\nPoor Maura, she had none of the reticent pride and shame of an English\r\ngentlewoman. She believed herself cruelly treated, and rushing away,\r\nfell on Anna, who was hovering near, watching to prevent any arrival\r\nsuch as was always probable.\r\n\r\nIt would not be well to relate the angry, foolish words that Anna had to\r\nhear, nor how Maura betrayed herself and her own manoeuvre. It is\r\nenough to say that she went home, weeping demonstratively, perhaps\r\nuncontrollably; and that Anna, after her trying scene, was able to exalt\r\nmore than ever Ivinghoe\'s generosity towards the absent Gerald, and\r\nforbearance towards Franceska. If he had ever passed the line, it was\r\nmore Maura\'s doing than his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. -- THE COLD SHOULDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Loath to depose the child, your brother\'s son.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA telegram early the next day announced that the Rotherwood family were\r\non their way, and they came in due time, the kind embrace that Francie\r\nreceived from each in turn being such as to set doubts at rest.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the dread, first of Monte Carlo, and secondly of Maura White,\r\nhad done much to prepare the way with Lady Rotherwood. If she had\r\nfirst heard of her son\'s attachment to the pretty child who acted Mona,\r\ndaughter to the upstart Vanderkists, and with a ruined father of no good\r\nrepute, she would have held it a foolish delusion to be crushed without\r\ndelay; but when this same attachment had lasted eight or nine months,\r\nand had only found avowal on the removal of a supposed rival; when,\r\nmoreover, her darling had been ill, had revived at the aspect of the\r\nyoung lady, and had conducted himself in a place of temptation so as to\r\ncalm an anxious mother\'s heart, she could see with his eyes, not only\r\nthat Franceska was really beautiful, graceful, and a true lady, but\r\nlikely to develop still more under favourable circumstances; that she\r\nhad improved in looks, air, and manner on her travels, also that she had\r\nnever been injured by any contact with undesirable persons, but had been\r\ntrained by the excellent Underwoods, whose gentle blood and breeding\r\nwere undeniable. Nor would "the daughter of the late Sir Adrian\r\nVanderkist, Baronet, of Ironbeam Park," sound much amiss. He was so\r\nlate, that his racing doings might be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as the Marchioness looked up to the castle, she felt that she\r\ncould forgive a good deal to the damsel who had saved the family from\r\nthe "sorry Rebecca," who had cried all night, and was still crying,\r\nwhenever any more tears would come, and not getting much pity from any\r\nof her relatives. Mr. White told her that she was a little fool to have\r\nexpected anything from a young swell; her brother said she might have\r\nknown that it was absurd to expect that any one could look at her when\r\nMiss Franceska was by; and Mrs. White observed that it was wonderful to\r\nher to see so little respect shown for maiden dignity, as to endure to\r\nmanifest disappointment. Adeline might speak from ample experience, and\r\ncertainly her words had a salutary effect.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Whites en famille were not quite the same externally. When\r\nLord Rotherwood, after luncheon, went to see old White at the works, and\r\nlook after his font, he met with a reception as stiff and cold as could\r\nwell be paid to a distinguished customer who was not at all in fault;\r\nand for the first time Mr. White was too busy to walk back with him to\r\nthe castle to see Adeline, whom he found, as usual, on a couch on the\r\nterrace in the shade of the house, a pretty picture among the flowers\r\nand vines. She was much more open with him, as became one who understood\r\nmore of his point of view.\r\n\r\n"Well, Rotherwood, I suppose I am to congratulate you, though it is\r\nscarcely a fair match in a worldly point of view."\r\n\r\n"For which I care not a rap. She is a good, simple girl, and a perfect\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"And Victoria? May I ask, does not she think it a misalliance,\r\nconsidering what these Vanderkists are--and the Underwoods?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one I respect more than Lancelot Underwood. As to Victoria,\r\nshe is thankful that it is no worse."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I know what you mean, but you can\'t wonder that my husband should\r\nfeel it hard that there should have been some kind of flirtation. He is\r\nfond of Maura, you know, and he does feel that there must have been some\r\nslyness in some one to cause this affair to have been so suddenly sprung\r\non us."\r\n\r\n"Slyness--aye, I believe there was. Tell me, Ada, had you any notion\r\nthat that lad, Gerald Underwood, was engaged to Dolores Mohun?"\r\n\r\n"No; who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Mysie let it out. She had been warned not to mention it till his\r\nposition was ascertained, Maurice\'s consent and all."\r\n\r\n"I must say Mysie should have spoken. It was not fair towards me to keep\r\nit back."\r\n\r\n"Still less fair of Maura, if that\'s her name, to hint at attachment\r\nbetween Franceska and the boy. That was the embargo upon my poor fellow.\r\nHe rushed off to have it out the moment he saw how matters stood."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a great shame; but girls are girls, especially with those\r\nantecedents, and Maura did not know to the contrary. You will believe\r\nme, Rotherwood, I never had any desire that she should succeed. I would\r\nhave sent her away if I could; but you can\'t wonder that Mr. White is\r\nvexed, and feels as if there had been underhand dealing."\r\n\r\n"I see he is. But you will not let him make it unpleasant for the\r\nUnderwoods."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no! They have not much longer to stay. They are in\r\ncorrespondence about a rheumatic clergyman."\r\n\r\nMrs. White, however, determined not to expose Maura to her husband,\r\nthough she reproached her, and was rather shocked by the young lady\'s\r\nself-defence. It was a natural idea, and no one had ever told her to\r\nthe contrary. It was all spite in Mysie Merrifield to proclaim it after\r\nhaving kept it back so long.\r\n\r\nShe really was in such a state of mind that Mrs. White was rather\r\nrelieved that the Rotherwoods had taken Franceska to San Remo to stay\r\ntill Ivinghoe had to depart. Anna was left to send off the little\r\nfelicitous note that she had written to her mother.\r\n\r\nEach and all were writing letters that would be received with\r\nrapture almost incredulous, for no one but Sophia could have had any\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n"It is pleasant to think of poor Alda\'s delight," said Geraldine, over\r\nher writing-case. "After all her troubles, to have her utmost ambition\r\nfulfilled at last; and yet--and yet it does seem turning that pretty\r\ncreature over to a life of temptation."\r\n\r\n"In good hands," said Clement. "The youth himself is a nice honest\r\nfellow, a mere boy as yet; but it is something to have no harm in him at\r\ntwo-and-twenty and in the Guards; and his parents are evidently ready to\r\nwatch over and guide them."\r\n\r\n"If her head does not get turned," sighed Geraldine.\r\n\r\n"Just as likely in any other station," replied Clement. "The protection\r\nmust come from within, not from the externals; and I do think that\r\nshe--yes, and he too--have that Guard within them."\r\n\r\n"I think the sooner we are away from this place the better," said\r\nGeraldine. "There are such things as cold shoulders, and perhaps\r\ndispleasure is in human nature, though it is not our fault."\r\n\r\n"Which is the worse for us," laughed her brother, "since we can\'t beg\r\npardon."\r\n\r\nThe cold shoulder was manifested by a note of apology the next morning\r\nfrom Mr. White. He was too busy to go with Mr. Underwood to Santa\r\nCarmela on this day, but had sent the young quarry-man to act as\r\nguide, and his foreman as interpreter. So Clement had his long ride on\r\nmule-back mostly in silence, though this he scarcely lamented, for he\r\ncould better enjoy the mountain peaks and the valleys bright with rich\r\ngrass, with anemones of all colours, hyacinths, strange primulas and\r\ngentians, without having to make talk to Mr. White. But his journey was\r\nwithout result. He did find an exceedingly old woman keeping sheep and\r\nspinning wool with a distaff, who owned to the name of Cecca Benista.\r\nShe once had a brother. Yes, Gian was his name, but he went away, as\r\nthey all did. He had a voice bellissima, si bellissima; and some one\r\ntold her long, long ago, that he had made his fortune, and formed a\r\ncompany, but he had never come home--no, no, and was probably dead,\r\nthough she had never heard; and he had sent nothing--no, no!\r\n\r\nThen Clement tried the priest of the curious little church on the\r\nhill-side, a memory of Elijah and the convents on Mount Carmel. The\r\nParrocco was a courteous man, quite a peasant, and too young to know\r\nmuch about the past generation. He gave Clement a refection of white\r\nbread, goats\' milk cheese, and coffee, and held up his hands on the\r\ndeclining of his thin wine. There was a kind of register of baptisms,\r\nand Giovanni Batista Benista was hunted out, and it was found that if\r\nalive he would be over seventy years old. But no more was known, and\r\nthere was no proof that he was dead twenty-two years before!\r\n\r\nThat long day had convinced Geraldine that the pleasantness of\r\nintercourse with the Whites was over, and she was not sorry that a\r\nletter was waiting for Clement to say that the rheumatic clergyman would\r\narrive, if desired, in another week. This was gladly accepted, and the\r\nquestion remained, whither should they go? Clement\'s year of absence\r\nwould be over in June, and he was anxious to get home; besides that,\r\nit was desirable to take Francie to her mother as soon as possible.\r\nThe only cause for delay was the possibility of Gerald\'s extracting\r\nsomething further from his mother, which might lead to further\r\nresearches on the Continent; but as most places were readily accessible\r\nfrom London, this was decided against, and it was determined to go back\r\nto Brompton at the same time as the Rotherwoods returned from San Remo.\r\n\r\nOn the last Sunday Mr. White showed himself much more cordial than he\r\nhad been since the crisis. He waited in the porch to say--\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, you have given us some very excellent sermons, and I am sure\r\nwe are much obliged to you. If I can help you any more in investigating\r\nthat unlucky affair of your nephew, do not hesitate to write to me. I\r\nshall be delighted to assist you in coming to your rights."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; though I sincerely hope they are not my rights."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well. You are not so advanced in life but that if you came into\r\nanything good, you might marry and start on a new lease! You are pounds\r\nbetter than when you came here."\r\n\r\nWhich last clause was so true that Clement could only own it, with\r\nthanks to his good-humoured host, who lingered a little still to say--\r\n\r\n"I am sorry any vexation arose about those foolish young people, but you\r\nsee young women will wish to do the best they can for themselves, and\r\nwill make mischief too if one listens to them. A sensible man won\'t.\r\nThat\'s what I say."\r\n\r\nClement quite agreed, though he was not sensible of having listened to\r\nany of the mischief-making, but he heartily shook hands with Mr. White,\r\nand went away, glad to be at peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. -- THE TEST OF DAY-DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Faith\'s meanest deed more favour bears,\r\n       Where hearts and wills are weighed,\r\n     Than brightest transports, choicest prayers,\r\n       That bloom their hour and fade.--J. H. NEWMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat return to Brompton was the signal for the numerous worries awaiting\r\nClement. First, the doctors thought him much improved, but declared that\r\na return to full work at St. Matthew\'s would overthrow all the benefit\r\nof his long rest, and would not hear of his going back, even with\r\nanother curate, for an experiment.\r\n\r\nThen all went down to Vale Leston together. Mr. Ed\'dard was welcomed\r\nwith rapture by his old flock. Alda had been almost ill with excitement\r\nand delight, and had not words enough to show her ecstasy over her\r\nbeautiful daughter, nor her gratitude to Geraldine, to whose management\r\nshe insisted on attributing the glorious result. In vain did Geraldine\r\ndisclaim all diplomacy, Lady Vanderkist was sure that all came of\r\nher savoir faire. At any rate, it was really comfortable to be better\r\nbeloved by Alda than ever in the course of her life! Alda even intimated\r\nthat she should be well enough to come to Brompton to assist in the\r\nchoice of the trousseau, and the first annoyance was with Clement for\r\nnot allotting a disproportioned sum for the purpose. He declared that\r\nFrancie ought not to have more spent on her than was reserved for\r\nher sisters, especially as it would be easy for her to supply all\r\ndeficiencies, while Alda could not endure that the future Lady Ivinghoe\r\nshould have an outfit unworthy of her rank, even though both Wilmet and\r\nGeraldine undertook to assist.\r\n\r\nThere were other difficulties, for which the sojourn at Vale Leston was\r\nto be dreaded. Gerald had been of age for two months, and there were\r\nleases to be signed and arrangements made most difficult to determine in\r\nthe present state of things. Major and Mrs. Harewood wanted to wind up\r\ntheir residence in the Priory, and to be able to move as soon as the\r\nwedding was over, since Franceska begged that it might be at the\r\nonly home she remembered, and her elders put aside their painful\r\nrecollections to gratify her; so that it was fixed for early August,\r\njust a year since her unprepared appearance as Mona.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Alda was really too ill to go to London, and Franceska had\r\nto be sent in charge of her aunt Cherry and of her sister Mary.\r\nLady Rotherwood would be in town, and might be trusted to have no\r\nunreasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nPoor Sophy! Penbeacon\'s destiny was one of the affairs that could not be\r\nsettled, and therewith her own, though her mother could not succeed in\r\npenetrating any of the family with the horror of giving Lord Ivinghoe\r\nsuch a brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the preparations came a letter from Gerald. He did\r\nindeed write every Sunday, but of late his had been hurried letters: he\r\nwas so fully occupied and had so much writing on hand that he could not\r\nindulge in more length.\r\n\r\n\r\n"You have been urging me," he said, "to find out what my mother knows. I\r\nhave not liked to press the subject while she was so ill, as she always\r\nmet every hint of it with tears and agitation. However, at last, Lida\r\nbrought her to it, and we really believe she knows no more than we do\r\nwhat became of her first husband. She never heard of him after she fled\r\nfrom him. She was almost a child, and he had been very cruel to her. But\r\nshe did tell us where we may be nearly certain of finding out, namely\r\nfrom Signor Menotti, Via San Giacomo, Genoa, or his successors, a\r\nman who trained singers and performers, and moreover took charge of\r\nBenista\'s money, and she thinks he had considerable savings. Poor woman,\r\nI believe she had no idea of the harm she might be doing me, though\r\nit was scarcely in human nature to see prosperity look so aggressive\r\nwithout trying to profit thereby; and when she had put herself into\r\nO\'Leary\'s power, the notion was to make an income out of me by private\r\nthreats and holding their tongues. That I should have any objection\r\nto such an arrangement, except on economical principles, never entered\r\ntheir heads, and they tried to make as much as possible out of either me\r\nor Clement, by withholding all the information possible till it was\r\npaid for, and our simultaneous refusal to be blackmailed entirely\r\ndisconcerted them, and made them furious. Lida said the man was violent\r\nwith her mother for letting out even what she did to trousseau, and the\r\nfirst annoyance was with Clement for not allotting a disproportioned sum\r\nfor the purpose. He declared that Francie ought not to have more spent\r\non her than was reserved for her sisters, especially as it would be easy\r\nfor her to supply all deficiencies, while Alda could not endure that the\r\nfuture Lady Ivinghoe should have an outfit unworthy of her rank, even\r\nthough both Wilmet and Geraldine undertook to assist.\r\n\r\nThere were other difficulties, for which the sojourn at Vale Leston was\r\nto be dreaded.

Lida said the man was violent\r\nwith her mother for letting out even what she did to Lance, and he meant\r\nto put a heavy price even on the final disclosure, in the trust (which I\r\nshare) that it may prove the key to the mystery. She had no notion that\r\nthe doubt was upsetting my position. Poor thing, she never had a chance\r\nin her life--gipsy breeding at first, then Benista\'s tender mercies\r\nand the wandering life. She could not fail to love my father till his\r\nrequirements piqued her, and it was a quarrel, exasperated perhaps by\r\nthe commencement of his illness, over her neglect of my unlucky self,\r\nand her acceptance of Schnetterling\'s attentions, that led to her\r\nabandoning him. I really do not think she ever realized that it was a\r\nsin. That good Pere Duchamps is the first priest of any kind she ever\r\nlistened to, and he has had a great effect upon her. He would like to\r\nextend it to Lida and me, but Lida is staunch to her well-beloved Mr.\r\nFlight as well as to me, and there is a church on the other side the\r\nbay to which I take her when our patient is well enough to spare her to\r\nwalk, or we can afford the crossing. Easter was a comfort there.\r\n\r\n"The warm weather has revived the patient, and she may live some months\r\nlonger, though she is a mere skeleton. Lida tends her in the most\r\naffectionate manner, and is really a little angel in her way. She has\r\ngot some private pupils in music, and is delighted to bring in grist to\r\nthe mill, which grinds hard enough to make me realize the old days you\r\nare so fond of recollecting.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me to send you the Lacustrian. I am ashamed of it, and of my\r\nown articles. Nothing will go down here but the most highly spiced, and\r\nit is matter of life and death to us, as long as my mother lives, to\r\nkeep on the swaying top of the poplar tree of popularity. You would\r\ndespise the need, and talk of Felix, but it is daily bread, and I cannot\r\nlet my mother and sister starve for opinions of mine. One comfort for\r\nyou is that if I ever do come home again to reign at Vale Leston, I\r\nshall have seen the outcome of various theories of last year, and proved\r\nwhat is the effect of having no class to raise a standard or to look up\r\nto. I don\'t think I shall be quite so bumptious, and I am quite sure I\r\nshall value my Cherie\'s tenderness much better than I have ever done,\r\nmore shame for me! Love to the bride and all at Vale Leston. There is\r\nan old age of novelty about these eastern states, quite disgusting in\r\ncomparison with the reverend dignity of such a place as Vale Leston. You\r\nnever thought that I appreciated it! You will find no fault with me on\r\nthat score now. The lake is beautiful enough, but I begin to hate the\r\nsight of it, especially when a Yankee insists on my telling him whether\r\nwe have in all Europe anything better than a duck-pond in comparison.\r\nLittle Lida is my drop of comfort, since she has ceased to be mortally\r\nafraid of \'Brother.\' Love to all and sundry again.\r\n\r\n"Your loving G."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a consultation over this letter, which ended in John\r\nHarewood\'s volunteering to go to Genoa, and find out this Menotti or his\r\nrepresentative, returning in time for the wedding, and hoping that the\r\nuncertainty would thus be over in time for the enjoyment of a truly\r\nprosperous event.\r\n\r\nA letter that came before his departure rendered Geraldine doubly\r\nanxious for the decision. Mrs. Henderson sent it to her to read, saying\r\nthat it was by Lady Merrifield\'s advice, since she thought that it\r\nshould be known how it was with Gerald, for even to Dolores he had not\r\ntold half what Ludmilla related.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAREST MRS. HENDERSON,\r\n\r\n"It is a long time since I received your dearest, kindest of letters,\r\nand if I did not answer it sooner, it was not from want of gratitude,\r\nbut attendance on my poor dear mother and assistance to our landlady\r\noccupies me at every minute that I can spare from giving music lessons\r\nto some private families, and an evening class. I am very thankful to be\r\nable to earn something, so as to take off something of the burthen on my\r\ndear brother\'s shoulders. For, alas! the care and support of my mother\r\nand me weigh very heavily upon him. The proprietor of the Lacustrian has\r\nparted with his other clerk, and my brother has the entire business\r\nof not only writing, extracting for, and editing the paper, but of\r\ncorrecting the press, and he dares not remonstrate or demand better\r\npayment, as we live from week to week, and he could not afford to be\r\ndismissed. He is at the office all day, beginning at six in the morning\r\nto meet the central intelligence, he only rushes home for his meals,\r\nand goes back to work till twelve or one o\'clock at night. Even then he\r\ncannot sleep. I hear him tossing about with the pain in his back that\r\nsitting at his desk brings on, and his hands are so tired by writing,\r\nand with the heat, which has been dreadful for the last few weeks, and\r\nhas taken away all the appetite he ever had. You would be shocked to\r\nsee him, he is so thin and altered; I cannot think how he is to continue\r\nthis, but he will not hear of my writing to Lady Travis Underwood. He\r\nis never angry, except when I try to persuade him, and you never saw\r\nanything like his patience and gentleness to my poor mother. She never\r\ndid either, she cannot understand it at all. At first she thought he\r\nwanted to coax the confession out of her, and when she found that it\r\nmade no difference, she could not recover from her wonder--he, whom she\r\nhad deserted in his babyhood, and so cruelly injured in his manhood, to\r\ndevote himself to toiling for her sake, and never to speak harshly to\r\nher for one moment. She knew I loved her, and she had always been good\r\nto me, except when O\'Leary forced her to be otherwise, but his behaviour\r\nhas done more to touch her heart than anything, and I am sure she is,\r\nas Pere Duchamps says, a sincere penitent. She is revived by the summer\r\nheat, and can sit under the stoop and enjoy the sweet air of the lake;\r\nbut she is very weak, and coughs dreadfully in the morning, just when it\r\nis cooler, and my brother might get some sleep. She tries to be good and\r\npatient with us both, and it really does soothe her when my brother can\r\nsit by her, and talk in his cheerful droll way; but he can stay but a\r\nvery short time. He has to rush back to his horrid stuffy office, and\r\nthen she frets after him and says, \'But what right have I to such a\r\nson?\' and she begins to cry and cough."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Clement, as Geraldine, unable to speak for tears, gave him\r\nthe letter. "This is a furnace of real heroism."\r\n\r\n"Christian heroism, I am sure," said Geraldine. "Oh, my boy, I am proud\r\nof him. He will be all the better for his brave experiment."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he had an instinct that it would be wholesome, besides the\r\nimpelling cause. Real hardship is sound training."\r\n\r\n"If it is not too hard," said she.\r\n\r\n"\'Let not their precious balms break my head,\'" said Clement.\r\n\r\n"I do not like that pain in the back. Remember how he dragged his\r\nlimbs when first we had him at home, and how delicate he was up to\r\nthirteen--only eight years ago!"\r\n\r\n"Probably it will not last long enough to do him much harm."\r\n\r\n"And how nobly uncomplaining he is!"\r\n\r\n"This has brought out all the good we always trusted was in reserve."\r\n\r\n"Better than Emilia\'s experiment," sighed Geraldine.\r\n\r\nFor Emilia Vanderkist, before her year was over, was at home, having\r\nbroken down, and having spent most of her holidays with Mrs. Peter\r\nBrown, the wife of Sir Ferdinand\'s partner. She had come back, not\r\nlooking much the worse for her hospital experience, but with an immense\r\ndeal to say of the tyranny of the matron, the rudeness of the nurses to\r\nprobationers, the hardness and tedium of the work to which she had been\r\nput, and the hatefulness of patients and of doctors.\r\n\r\nAnna sympathized with all the vehemence of her sisterly affection,\r\nand could hardly believe her aunts, who told her that things must have\r\nchanged in a wonderful manner since the time of Angela\'s experiences,\r\nfor she had been very happy in the same place, and made no complaints.\r\n\r\nEmilia had written to her cousin Marilda to express her willingness to\r\nreturn so soon as the Travis Underwoods should come home, and in\r\nthe meantime she remained at Vale Leston, not showing quite as much\r\ntolerance as might be expected of the somewhat narrow way of life of\r\nher sisters. She did not like being a lodger, as it were, in Sophy\'s\r\nbedroom; she found fault with the parlour-maid\'s waiting, complained of\r\nthe noise of the practising of the three little sisters, and altogether\r\nreminded Geraldine of Alda in penance at home.\r\n\r\nMajor Harewood was detained longer than he expected, for on arriving at\r\nGenoa he found that Menotti had migrated, and had to follow him to his\r\nvilla on the Apennines, where, in the first place, he had to overcome\r\nthe old man\'s suspicions that he was come to recover Benista\'s means on\r\nbehalf of his family, and then at last was assured that the man had been\r\ndead long before 1870. Still John Harewood thought it well to obtain\r\npositive evidence, and pursued the quest to Innspruck, where Menotti\r\naverred that the man had been left by his companions dying in the care\r\nof some Sisters of Charity.\r\n\r\nSo it proved. At Innspruck, the record of the burial of Giovanni\r\nBenista, a native of Piedmont, was at length produced, dated the 12th\r\nof February, 1868, happily and incontestably before Zoraya\'s marriage to\r\nEdgar Underwood!\r\n\r\nJohn Harewood made haste to telegraph the tidings to Vale Leston and to\r\nJonesville, and came home exultant, having dispelled the cloud that\r\nhad brooded over the family for nearly a year, and given them freely to\r\nenjoy the wedding.\r\n\r\nWould they do so the more or the less for Emilia\'s announcement that\r\nshe had a letter from Mr. Ferdinand Brown, eldest son of Sir Ferdinand\'s\r\npartner, offering her marriage, and that she had accepted him? He was,\r\nof course, a rich man, but oh! how Emily, Annie, and Gerald had been\r\nwont to make fun of him, and his parents.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Nan," said she, "I shall be able to do much more good in\r\nthat way."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"And really I cannot go back to those intolerable backgammon evenings at\r\nKensington Palace Gardens."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. -- A MISSIONARY WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Till the smooth temper of my age might be\r\n     Like the high leaves upon the holly tree.--SOUTHEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood said that nothing was ever done at Vale Leston\r\naccording to the conventionalities, and the Devereux wedding was an\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nLancelot had brought word that Bishop Norman May had actually arrived\r\nfrom New Zealand for a half-year\'s visit, bringing with him the younger\r\nmissionary Leonard Ward, and that Dr. May\'s happiness was unspeakable.\r\n"A renewed youth, if he needed to have it renewed."\r\n\r\nClement and William Harewood went over to see them, and returned greatly\r\nimpressed, and resolved on convoking the neighbourhood to be stirred\r\nin the cause of the Pacific islands. At the same time, one of the many\r\nletters from Lady Rotherwood about arrangements ended with--"My husband\r\nhopes you will be able to arrange for us to be introduced to your\r\nconnections of the May family, the Bishop, Mr. Ward, and the good old\r\ndoctor of whom we have heard so much."\r\n\r\n"We must invite them all to the wedding," said Mrs. Harewood, who, as\r\nstill inhabiting the Priory, would be the hostess.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," returned William Harewood, "but I don\'t think Mr. Ward\r\nwould come. He looks like an ancient hermit."\r\n\r\n"The best way," said Mrs. Grinstead, "would be to finish up the\r\nwedding-day with a missionary garden-party."\r\n\r\n"Geraldine!" said Lady Vanderkist from her sofa, in feeble accents of\r\ndismay; but Mrs. William Harewood hardly heard, and did not notice.\r\n\r\n"It would be the most admirable plan. It would give people something to\r\ndo, and make a reason for having ever so many more."\r\n\r\n"Baits cleverly disposed," said William. "The S.P.G. to attract Ward,\r\nWard to attract the Marquis, and the Marquis to attract the herd."\r\n\r\n"Everybody throngs to the extremest outskirts of a wedding," said\r\nGeraldine.\r\n\r\n"They may have the presents on view in the long room," said Wilmet.\r\n\r\n"Provided they don\'t have the list of them printed," said Geraldine.\r\n"Lance won\'t put them into the \'Pursuivant\'; it is disgusting!"\r\n\r\n"So I have always thought," said Robina; "but you hardly make allowances\r\nfor the old ladies who love to spell them out."\r\n\r\n"The Marquis of Rotherwood--a gold-topped dressing-case; Miss Keren\r\nHappuch Tripp--a pincushion," said Geraldine. "It is the idlest gossip,\r\nand should not be encouraged."\r\n\r\n"And," added Robina, "as we go out through the cloister there will\r\nhappily be no rice. Will has stopped it in the churchyard."\r\n\r\n"And fortunately we have no school-boys to reckon with, except Adrian\r\nand Fely, who will be quite amenable."\r\n\r\nFor Kester Harewood was in India, and Edward on the Mediterranean;\r\nAdrian was at home, doing credit to Miss Mohun, and so vehemently\r\ncollecting stamps, that he was said to wish to banish all his friends to\r\nthe most remote corners of the earth to send them home.\r\n\r\nFrancie\'s elder sisters declined being bridesmaids, so that Phyllis and\r\nMysie were the chief, and the three young sisters, Wilmet, Alda, and\r\nJoan, with two little Underwoods and two small Harewoods, all in white\r\nfrocks and sashes, were to attend and make a half-circle round the\r\nbride.\r\n\r\nAll took effect as had been purposed, each party being equally desirous\r\nthat it should be truly a Christian wedding, such as might be a fit\r\nemblem of the great Marriage Feast, and bring a blessing--joyous and\r\nhappy, yet avoiding the empty pomp and foolish mirth that might destroy\r\nthe higher thoughts.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful Vale Leston church looked, decked with white roses,\r\nlilies, and myrtle! The bride, tall and stately in her flowing veil and\r\nglistening satin train, had her own sweet individuality, not too closely\r\nrecalling the former little bride. She came on her uncle Clement\'s arm,\r\nas most nearly representing a father to her, and the marriage blessing\r\nwas given by the majestic-looking Bishop, with the two chief local\r\nclergy, Mr. William Harewood and Mr. Charles Audley, taking part of the\r\nservice. It was a beautiful and impressive scene, and there was a great\r\npeace on all. It was good to see the intense bliss on Ivinghoe\'s face\r\nas he led his bride down the aisle, and along the cloister; and as they\r\ncame into the drawing-room, after she had received an earnest kiss, and\r\n"my pretty one" from his father, it was to Dr. May that he first led\r\nher. Dr. May, his figure still erect, his face bright and cheery, his\r\nbrow entirely bare, and his soft white locks flowing over his collar.\r\nHe held out his hands, "Ah, young things! You are come for the old man\'s\r\nblessing! Truly you have it, my lady fair. You are fair indeed, as fair\r\nwithin as without. You have a great deal in the power of those little\r\nhands, and you--oh yes, both of you, believe, that a true, faithful,\r\nloving, elevating wife is the blessing of all one\'s days, whether it be\r\nonly for a few years, or, as I trust and pray it may be with you, for a\r\nlong--long, good, and prosperous life together."\r\n\r\nThe two young things bent their heads, and he blessed them with his\r\nblessing of eighty years. Lord Rotherwood\'s eyes were full of tears, as\r\nhe said in a choked voice--\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," while Franceska murmured to Mysie--\r\n\r\n"I do like that he should have been the first to call me \'my lady.\'"\r\n\r\nThe luncheon included only the two families, and the actual assistants\r\nat the wedding, and it was really very merry. Lady Rotherwood did\r\ninspire a little awe, but then Alda, sitting near, knew exactly how to\r\ntalk to her, and Alda, who, like Geraldine, had dressed herself in soft\r\ngreys and whites, with her delicate cheeks flushed with pleasure and\r\ntriumph, looked as beautiful as ever, and far outshone her twin, whose\r\ncomplexion and figure both had become those of the portly housewife.\r\n\r\nMeta, otherwise Mrs. Norman May, had eyes as bright and lively as ever,\r\nthough face and form had both grown smaller, and she was more like a\r\nfairy godmother than the Titania she had been in times of old. She had\r\ngot into the middle of all the varieties of children, dragged thither by\r\nGertrude\'s Pearl and Audrey, and was making them happy.\r\n\r\nEthel and Geraldine never could come to the end of what they had to say\r\nto one another, except that Ethel could but be delighted to make her\r\nfriend know the brother of her early youth; and show her the grave,\r\nearnest-looking man who had suffered so much, and whose hair was as\r\nwhite as the doctor\'s, his face showing the sunburn of the tropics; and\r\nthe crow\'s-feet round his eyes, the sailor\'s habit of searching gaze. He\r\ndid not speak much, but watched the merry young groups as if they were a\r\nsort of comedy in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were very merry, especially when the doctor had proposed the health\r\nof the bride, and her brother, Sir Adrian, was called on to return\r\nthanks for her.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen and ladies," he said, "no, I mean ladies and gentlemen, I am\r\nvery much obliged to you all for the honour you have done my sister. I\r\ncan tell Lord Ivinghoe she is a very good girl, and very nice, and all\r\nthat, when she is not cocky, and doesn\'t try to keep one in order."\r\n\r\nThe speech was drowned in laughter, and calls to Ivinghoe to mind what\r\nhe was about, and beware of the "new woman."\r\n\r\nSo the young couple were seen off to spend their honeymoon in Scotland,\r\nand the rest of the party could pair off to enjoy their respective\r\nfriends, except that Mary and Sophy had to exhibit the wedding presents\r\nto all and sundry of the visitors of all degrees who began to flock in.\r\n\r\nSeats were ranged on the lawn, and when every one had had time to wonder\r\nat everything, from Lady Rotherwood\'s set of emeralds, down to the\r\nchoirboys\' carved bracket, the house-bell was rung, and all had to take\r\ntheir places on the lawn, fairly shaded by house, cloister, and cedar\r\ntree, and facing the conservatory, whose steps, with the terrace, formed\r\na kind of platform. It is not needful to go through all, or how John\r\nHarewood, as host, explained that they had thought that it would be\r\nwell to allow their guests to have the advantage of hearing their\r\ndistinguished visitors tell of their experiences. And so they did,\r\nthe Bishop pleading the cause of missions with his wonderful native\r\neloquence, as he stood by the chair where his father sat listening to\r\nhim, as to a strain of sweet music long out of reach. Then Leonard Ward\r\nsimply and bluntly told facts about the Pacific islands and islanders,\r\nthat set hearts throbbing, and impelled more than one young heart to\r\nlong to tread in the like course.\r\n\r\nThen Lord Rotherwood thanked and bungled as usual, so that Gustave\r\nTanneguy would have a hard matter to reduce what he called the\r\n"aristocratic tongue" to plain English, or rather reporter\'s English.\r\nThe listeners were refreshed with tea, coffee, and lemonade, and there\r\nwas a final service in the church, which many gladly attended, and thus\r\nended what had been a true holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. -- RIGHTED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Perhaps the cup was broken here,\r\n     That Heaven\'s new wine might show more clear.\r\n                                      E. B. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"No. 14, Huron St., Jonesville, Ohio,\r\n\r\n"July 19.\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n"You were so kind as to tell me to write to your ladyship if we were\r\nin any difficulty or distress, and I have often longed to do so, but my\r\nbrother always said that we had no right to trespass on your goodness.\r\nNow, however, things are at such a pass that I think you will hear of us\r\nwith true compassion. I do not know whether he told you that we met\r\nmy poor mother on board a steamer upon this lake. Her husband had been\r\ndrowned in a wreck while crossing, and she was reduced to great poverty,\r\nand had also, from exposure, contracted disease of the lungs, which,\r\nthe doctor said, must terminate fatally in a few months. My brother\r\ntook charge of her, and has supported us ever since, now four months,\r\nby working at the editorship of the Lacustrian Intelligencer, with such\r\nsmall assistance as I could give by music lessons. It involved severe\r\nlabour at desk work and late hours, and his health has latterly given\r\nway, his back and lower limbs being gradually affected, and last\r\nMonday even his hands proved helpless. My poor mother broke another\r\nblood-vessel on Sunday, and died ten minutes later. My brother desired\r\nme to sell his dear violin and his watch to pay the funeral expenses,\r\nbut after that I know not what we can do, as he is quite helpless, and\r\ncan hardly be left even for the sake of my small earnings. Dear Lady\r\nTravis Underwood, pray help us, as I know you and Sir Ferdinand love my\r\npoor dear generous brother, and will not think him ungrateful for having\r\ndeclined your kindness while he could support himself and us. No doubt\r\nwe shall get help from England, but not for some time, so I dare to ask\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n"I remain, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n"LUDMILLA.\r\n\r\n"P.S.--Everybody knows him as Jerry Wood. We are at Mr. MacMahon\'s, 14\r\nHuron Street."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sad letter, in Lida\'s neat pupil-teacher\'s hand, came enclosed\r\nwithin a longer letter from Marilda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Grand National Hotel, Jonesville.\r\n\r\n"July 23rd.\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR GERALDINE,\r\n\r\n"You will believe that this letter from poor Lydia made Fernan telegraph\r\nat once to her, and hurry off as soon as we could reach the train. We\r\nfound things quite as bad or worse than we expected. The poor children\r\nwere living in two rooms in a wretched little house of an Irish collier,\r\nwho with his wife happily has been very kind to them, and says that\r\nnothing could surpass their goodness to that poor mother of theirs, who,\r\nshe tells me, \'made a real Christian end\' at last. I am sure she had\r\nneed to do so.\r\n\r\n"The burial was happily over, conducted by the French priest, as the\r\nwoman was a Roman Catholic to the last. Gerald was sitting up by the\r\nwindow, so changed that we should not have known him, except for the\r\nwonderful likeness to Felix that has come upon him. It seems that he\r\nhad not only all the writing of that horrid paper to do, but all the\r\ncompositor\'s work, or whatever you call it. The people put upon him when\r\nthey saw how well he could do it, and he could not refuse because his\r\nmother needed comforts, and he durst not get thrown out of employment.\r\nHe went on, first with aching back, then his legs got stiff and\r\nstaggering, but still he went on, and now it has gone into his hands; he\r\ncannot hold a pen, and can hardly lift a tea-cup. But he is so cheerful,\r\nalmost merry. The doctor says it is a paralytic affection, and that\r\noverwork has developed the former disease from the old injury to the\r\nspine, which seemed to have passed off, and there is intermittent fever\r\nabout him too, a not uncommon thing in these low-lying lake districts.\r\nWe have moved him to this Grand National Hotel, a big, half-inhabited\r\nplace, but better than the MacMahons\' house, though the good woman cried\r\nover him and Lydia at their farewells, and said she never should see\r\nsuch a young gentleman and lady again with hearts so like ould Ireland.\r\nShe would hardly take the money that Fernan offered her; she said they\r\nhad brought a blessing on her house with their tender, loving ways.\r\n\r\n"Fernan is gone to Milwaukee to get further advice and more comforts for\r\nGerald, and we mean, as soon as he can be moved, to take him home with\r\nus, since the air of the Rockies will revive him if anything will. This\r\nplace is fearfully hot and oppressive; the bay seems to shut out air\r\nfrom Lake Erie, and I cannot bear to think what that poor boy must have\r\ngone through in that close little den, with the printing-press humming\r\nand stamping away close to him; but he says it is his native element,\r\nand that when he is better he must go to Fiddler\'s Ranch. He sends his\r\nlove, and fears that you have missed his letters, but he could hardly\r\nwrite them, and thought Lydia might alarm you. He is a very dear boy,\r\nand I do hope we make him comfortable; he is so thankful for the little\r\nwe can do for him, and so patient. He tells me to give special love to\r\nFrancie, and say he is glad that Mona\'s game of chess was played out\r\nwith a good substitute for Ferdinand. These are his words, which no\r\ndoubt she will understand. We think of moving next week, but much\r\ndepends on the doctor\'s verdict. My love too to the dear Francie; she\r\nwill be a great lady, quite beyond our sphere. Perhaps she may be able\r\nto give Emily some amusements, though I fear they will only make her\r\nmore discontented with our humdrum ways. I never thought hospital work\r\nwould suit her. Gerald says there is nothing like trying one\'s theories,\r\nand that having to exaggerate his own has made him sick of a good deal\r\nof them, though not of all. Poor dear boy, I hope he will live to show\r\nthe benefits he says he has derived from this sad time. It shall not\r\nbe for want of anything we can do. He is as near our hearts as ever his\r\ndear father was, and Lydia is a dear little girl.\r\n\r\n"Your ever affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n"MARY ALDA TRAVIS UNDERWOOD."\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great shock, though mitigated by hearing that Gerald was in\r\nsuch hands as those of his first friend, and kind Marilda; but there\r\nwas great surprise at no notice being taken of the tidings that secured\r\nGerald\'s position. John Harewood had telegraphed them, but it only now\r\nfully broke on him that he ought to have sent them to Jerry Wood instead\r\nof Gerald Underwood, so that Italian telegrams were not to blame.\r\n\r\nOn one thing Clement ventured, being nearly certain that the reaction of\r\nGerald\'s mind would not include the preventing of all Penbeacon works.\r\nHe encouraged young Bramshaw to set about the plans so as to make the\r\nwashings as innocuous as possible, being persuaded that this was the\r\nonly way to prevent more obnoxious erections on ground just beyond.\r\nMoreover, this gave the lovers hope, and Alda had, under Clement\'s\r\npersuasion and rebukes, withdrawn her opposition to the engagement, so\r\nthat Sophy was free to wander about Penbeacon with her Philip, and help\r\nto set up his theodolite, and hold the end of his measuring-tape.\r\n\r\nHer mother could not well stand out on the score of unequal birth, when\r\nMr. Ferdinand Brown, whose father had swept out the office, came down\r\nand was accepted with calm civility, it could not be called delight,\r\neven by Emilia.\r\n\r\nBut he was a worthy young man, and well educated, and it was for his\r\nsake that Clement and Geraldine had stayed on at the Priory, giving the\r\nHarewoods and their curates holidays in turn; though even this amount of\r\nwork was enough to leave with Clement a dread conviction that his full\r\nshare of St. Matthew\'s would be fatal to him, insomuch that he had\r\nwritten to the patron, the Bishop of Albertstown, seriously to propose\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nFresh letters arrived from America, the first slightly more cheery, but\r\nthe next was dated from Violinia, to the general surprise, and it was\r\nvery short, from Sir Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAR CLEMENT,\r\n\r\n"We have the telegram, a relief to the poor lad\'s mind, but he has\r\nnot spoken much since. It came just as we were starting in an invalid\r\nPullman, fitted with every comfort; but the jars of these lines are\r\nunavoidable and unspeakable, and he suffered so terribly, as well as\r\nso patiently, that we had to give up our intention of taking him to\r\nUnderwood. The one thing he begged for was that we would take him to\r\nFiddler\'s Ranch. You know there is a mission-station here, so we have\r\nhim in the clergyman\'s house, and the place is so advanced that he has\r\nevery comfort. But I doubt whether the dear boy will ever move again. He\r\nis perfectly helpless, but his brain quite clear, and his spirits good.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ever yours,\r\n\r\n"F. A. TRAVIS UNDERWOOD."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere followed a long letter, dictated by Gerald himself, and partly\r\nwritten by Lida, partly by Marilda, at several different times.\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAREST, MOST DEAREST CHERIE, AND ALL--\r\n\r\n"I should like to be able to sign my name to my thanks to all, if only\r\nto feel that I have a name, and one so honoured, but these fingers\r\nof mine will not obey me, so you must take the will for the deed, and\r\nbelieve that you have made me very happy, and completed all I could\r\nwish. I fear you never will believe how jolly it is to lie here, the\r\npain all gone, since having done with that terrific train, and the three\r\ntenderest, most watchful of slaves always round me, while my Cherie is\r\nspared the sight of the wreck.--(L.)\r\n\r\n"You know that good old Fernan established a missionary station here,\r\nbuilding a church, and getting the ground consecrated where my father\r\nlies. I can just see the top of the cross, and there he promises that\r\nI shall lie. You will be able to put my name in the cloister under my\r\nfather\'s, as no impostor.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t grieve, my Cherie, it is best as it is; my brains were full of\r\nmore notions than you ever quite guessed, and of which I have seen the\r\nseamy side out here, though there is much that I should feel bound to\r\nwork out, and that might have grieved you. I was not tough enough for\r\nthe discipline that was needed to strike the balance. (He is thinking\r\naloud, dear fellow.--M. A.) I am afraid I have often vexed you in my\r\ncrudeness and conceit, but I know you forgive. I am very thankful for\r\nthis year, and for the way in which my poor mother was given into\r\nmy hands at last. Fernan has helped me to make a short will, to save\r\nconfusion and difficulty.\r\n\r\n"I have left everything to Clement, knowing that you and he will provide\r\nfor all. Fernan and Marilda will care for Lida. (That we will.--M. A.)\r\nI cannot leave her to be a tax on Vale Leston. Give my books and MSS. to\r\nDolores, and please be kind to her. My violin, which Fernan redeemed for\r\nme, the eponym (How do you spell it?--M. A.), by the way, of this place,\r\nmy father\'s own fiddle, give to Lance for his pretty Ariel; Anna, my\r\ngood sister, should have my music, which will be a memory of happy\r\nevenings. Emmie may like the portfolio of drawings that I made for the\r\nmission-house; dear old Sibby the photograph in my room of the \'Ecce\r\nHomo.\' I have it in my eye now.--(M. A.)\r\n\r\n"Everything is such a comfort, Fernan and Marilda are the best of nurses\r\nand helpers, and I mourn for the folly that chaffed about them and\r\nboredom. Tell Emmie so. Fernan has made this place a little oasis round\r\nmy father\'s grave, and his parson, who has a mission among the remains\r\nof the Sioux, is with me every other day, and does all that Clement\r\ncould desire for me. So do--do believe that it is all for the best, dear\r\npeople.--(L.)\r\n\r\n"One thing good is, that I shall not bring any bad blood into the\r\nUnderwood inheritance. By the bye, tell them--(Continued by Marilda)\r\nMr. Gracchus Van ------ suddenly arrived here, greatly shocked at Gerald\'s\r\nstate, and actually wanting to marry Lydia on the spot--which of course\r\nshe declined. But Fernan was pleased with him, and he told him he had\r\nnever met any one to hold a candle to \'Jerry Wood,\' so \'smart\' and\r\n\'chipper,\' as he saw at first, and then cheerful, good-humoured, and\r\nkindly, whatever happened. None of your Britisher\'s airs, but ready to\r\nmake the best of any fixings. I don\'t think dear Gerald meant me to tell\r\nall this, but think of the difference from the fastidious fine gentleman\r\nhe used to be! He is dozing now, I fear he is getting weaker; but he is\r\never so sweet and good, and I quite long to beg his pardon for having\r\ncalled him your spoilt boy. Mr. Fraser, the clergyman here, is very much\r\nstruck with him, and Fernan remembers the time when he baptized him as\r\nhe lay unconscious. Dear Cherry, it will grieve you, but I think there\r\nwill be comfort in the grief.\r\n\r\n"Your affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n"M. A. T. U."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were long letters to Dolores, dictated to Lida--all in the same\r\nspirit. One of them said, "Go bravely on, my Dolores; though we do not\r\nlive together in our bicycle-roving castles. You will do good work if\r\nyou uphold the glory of God and the improvement of man, all through\r\ncreation and science. I should like to talk it over with you. Things\r\nare plainer to me than in the days of my inexperience and cocksureness.\r\nShort as the time was, in months, it showed me much more, especially my\r\nown inefficiency to deal with the great problems of these times, perhaps\r\nof all times. Remember this, but go on--if we do but put grains of sand\r\ninto the great Edifice."\r\n\r\nMore was written, but these were the most memorable extracts, before the\r\nletter that told that something like a fresh stroke had come, and taken\r\naway the power of distinct speech, then that the throat had failed, and\r\nthere was only one foreboding more to be told, and soon realized. The\r\nyoung ardent spirit, trained by so short a discipline, had passed away\r\nin peace. And they laid him beside his father, whose better spirit he\r\nhad unconsciously evoked, and whom he had loved so deeply. The doctors\r\nsaid that the real cause of his death had been the Indian bullet,\r\ninflicting injury on the spine, which the elasticity of youth had for\r\nthe time overcome, but which manifested itself again under overstrain.\r\nFerdinand, when he awoke the child back to life, had given him years not\r\nspent in vain for himself or for others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been utter desolation to the little sister save for the\r\nmotherly tenderness of Marilda, who took her to the home in the Rocky\r\nMountains, and would fain have adopted her, but that Lida, acting\r\nperhaps on advice from her brother, only begged to be so educated as to\r\nfit her to be independent, and to be given a start in life. It would\r\nbe shown in a year or two whether her vocation should be musical or\r\nscholastic.\r\n\r\nGerald had his meed of tears at home, but not bitter ones. Nay, those\r\nthat had the most quality of bitterness were Emilia\'s, shed in secret\r\nlest interpretations should be put on those that had the quality of\r\nremorse, as she recollected the high aspirations that had ended so\r\ndifferently in the two cousins.\r\n\r\nDolores dried hers, to feel a consecration on her studies and her\r\nlabours as she grew forward to the fulfilment of her purpose of being a\r\nleading woman in the instruction and formation of young minds, working\r\nall the better for the inspiriting words and example, and the more\r\ngently and sympathizingly for the love that was laid up in her heart.\r\n\r\nShe and his "Cherie" came to have a great affection and understanding\r\nof each other, and discussed what Dolores called "ethics" with warm\r\ninterest, the elder lady bringing the old and sacred lights to bear on\r\nthe newer theories.\r\n\r\nClement was the undoubted owner of Vale Leston, and the John Harewoods\r\nhad decided on leaving the Priory. Just at the same time, when the\r\nacceptance of Clement\'s resignation of St. Matthew\'s had arrived,\r\nWilliam Harewood was offered a canonry at Minsterham, with the headship\r\nof the theological college. The canonry had been the summit of his\r\nambition when a boy, and there was no one fitter than he for the care of\r\na theological college. He was pre-eminently a scholar, and his fifteen\r\nyears of parish experience made good preparation for training young\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nSo Clement could decide on presenting himself to the living of Vale\r\nLeston, with a staff of curates, and Geraldine to be his home sister,\r\nmaking the Priory a resting-place for overworked people, whether clergy,\r\ngovernesses, or poor, or mission-folk at home. It was a trust to be kept\r\nfor Lancelot and his boy, who would make the summer home of the family\r\nthere, to Dr. May\'s great content. It was a peaceful home, and to every\r\none\'s surprise, Alda decided to remain at hand, chiefly to keep her\r\nboy under his uncle\'s influence, which thus far was keeping him well in\r\nhand, and as he would go to a public school with little Felix, might be\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort and encouragement to feel that hereditary dangers and\r\ntemperament could be subdued and conquered in Gerald; and if the sins of\r\nparents had their consequence in the children, the scourge might become\r\na palm. When the commemorative brass in the cloister was to be put up,\r\nGeraldine said--\r\n\r\n"I should like to put \'Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece that\r\nwas lost.\'"\r\n\r\n"He never was lost."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no, my dear boy. But his work was so like the finding the\r\nstained, tarnished piece of silver, cast aside, defaced, dust-marked,\r\nand by simple duty and affection bringing her back."\r\n\r\n"I see! Let us have the inscription in Greek. Then none can apply it\r\nto himself! It was a wonderful work, and it is strange that having\r\nfulfilled it, he who brought the child from his father\'s arms should lay\r\nhim to his rest beside his father."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Long Vacation, by Charlotte M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
