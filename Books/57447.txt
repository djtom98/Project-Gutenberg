It belonged to no\r\nparticular order of architecture, and was more suggestive of comfort\r\nthan of splendour, with its great windows, and rambling, nondescript\r\nproportions. On one side, built out from the house itself, was a big\r\nglass structure, originally designed for a conservatory. On the April\r\nmorning of which I write, the whole place wore a dejected and\r\ndismantled appearance; while in the windows and on the outer wall of the\r\ngarden were fixed black and white posters, announcing a sale of effects\r\nto take place on that day week.\r\n\r\nThe air of desolation which hung about the house had communicated itself\r\nin some vague manner to the garden, where the trees were bright with\r\nblossom, or misty with the tender green of the young leaves. Perhaps the\r\neffect of sadness was produced, or at least heightened, by the pathetic\r\nfigure that paced slowly up and down the gravel path immediately before\r\nthe house; the figure of a young woman, slight, not tall, bare-headed,\r\nand clothed in deep mourning.\r\n\r\nShe paused at last in her walk, and stood a moment in a listening\r\nattitude, her face uplifted to the sky.\r\n\r\nGertrude Lorimer was not a beautiful woman, and such good looks as she\r\npossessed varied from day to day, almost from hour to hour; but a\r\ncertain air of character and distinction clung to her through all her\r\nvarying moods, and redeemed her from a possible charge of plainness.\r\n\r\nShe had an arching, unfashionable forehead, like those of Lionardo da\r\nVinci\'s women, short-sighted eyes, and an expressive month and chin. As\r\nshe stood in the full light of the spring sunshine, her face pale and\r\nworn with recent sorrow, she looked, perhaps, older than her\r\ntwenty-three years.\r\n\r\nPushing back from her forehead the hair, which, though not cut into a\r\n"fringe," had a tendency to stray about her face, and passing her hand\r\nacross her eyes, with a movement expressive of mingled anxiety and\r\nresolve, she walked quickly to the door of the conservatory, opened it,\r\nand went inside.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the great glass structure would have presented a\r\nsurprise to the stranger expectant of palms and orchids. It was fitted\r\nup as a photographer\'s studio.\r\n\r\nSeveral cameras, each of a different size, stood about the room. In one\r\ncorner was a great screen of white-painted canvas; there were blinds to\r\nthe roof adapted for admitting or excluding the light; and paste-pots,\r\nbottles, printing-frames, photographs in various stages of finish--a\r\nnondescript heap of professional litter--were scattered about the place\r\nfrom end to end.\r\n\r\nStanding among these properties was a young girl of about twenty years\r\nof age; fair, slight, upright as a dart, with a glance at once alert and\r\nserene.\r\n\r\nThe two young creatures in their black dresses advanced to each other,\r\nthen stood a moment, clinging to one another in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that either had been in the studio since the day\r\nwhen their unforeseen calamity had overtaken them; a calamity which\r\nseemed to them so mysterious, so unnatural, so past all belief, and yet\r\nwhich was common-place enough--a sudden loss of fortune, immediately\r\nfollowed by the sudden death of the father, crushed by the cruel blow\r\nwhich had fallen on him.\r\n\r\n"Lucy," said the elder girl at last, "is it only a fortnight ago?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," answered Lucy, looking round the room, whose familiar\r\ndetails stared at her with a hideous unfamiliarity; "I don\'t know if it\r\nis a hundred years or yesterday since I put that portrait of Phyllis in\r\nthe printing-frame! Have you told Phyllis?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I wish to do so at once; and Fanny. But here they come."\r\n\r\nTwo other black-gowned figures entered by the door which led from the\r\nhouse, and helped to form a sad little group in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nFrances Lorimer, the eldest of them all, and half-sister to the other\r\nthree, was a stout, fair woman of thirty, presenting somewhat the\r\nappearance of a large and superannuated baby. She had a big face, with\r\nsmall, meaningless features, and faint, surprised-looking eyebrows. Her\r\ncomplexion had once been charmingly pink and white, but the tints had\r\nhardened, and a coarse red colour clung to the wide cheeks. At the\r\npresent moment, her little, light eyes red with weeping, her eyebrows\r\narched higher than ever, she looked the picture of impotent distress.\r\nShe had come in, hand in hand with Phyllis, the youngest, tallest, and\r\nprettiest of the sisters; a slender, delicate-looking creature of\r\nseventeen, who had outgrown her strength; the spoiled child of the\r\nfamily by virtue of her youth, her weakness, and her personal charms.\r\n\r\nGertrude was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"Now that we are all together," she said, "it is a good opportunity for\r\ntalking over our plans. There are a great many things to be considered,\r\nas you know. Phyllis, you had better not stand."\r\n\r\nPhyllis cast her long, supple frame into the lounge which was regarded\r\nas her special property, and Fanny sat down on a chair, wiping her eyes\r\nwith her black-bordered pocket-handkerchief. Gertrude put her hands\r\nbehind her and leaned her head against the wall.\r\n\r\nPhyllis\'s wide, grey eyes, with their half-wistful, half-humorous\r\nexpression, glanced slowly from one to the other.\r\n\r\n"Now that we are all grouped," she said, "there is nothing left but for\r\nLucy to focus us."\r\n\r\nIt was a very small joke indeed, but they all laughed, even Fanny. No\r\none had laughed for a fortnight, and at this reassertion of youth and\r\nhealth their spirits rose with unexpected rapidity.\r\n\r\n"Now, Gertrude, unfold your plans," said Lucy, in her clear tones and\r\nwith her air of calm resolve.\r\n\r\nGertrude played nervously with a copy of the _British Journal of\r\nPhotography_ which she held, and began to speak with hesitation, almost\r\nwith apology, as one who deprecates any undue assumption of authority.\r\n\r\n"You know that Mr. Grimshaw, our father\'s lawyer, was here last night,"\r\nshe said; "and that he and I had a long talk together about business.\r\n(He was sorry you were too ill to come down, Fanny.) He told me all\r\nabout our affairs. We are quite, quite poor. When everything is settled,\r\nwhen the furniture is sold, he thinks there will be about \xa3500 among us,\r\nperhaps more, perhaps less."\r\n\r\nFanny\'s thin, feminine tones broke in on her sister\'s words--\r\n\r\n"There is my \xa350 a-year that my mama left me; I am sure you are all\r\nwelcome to that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, yes," said Lucy, patting her shoulder; while Gertrude bit\r\nher lip and went on--\r\n\r\n"We cannot live for long on \xa3500, as you must know. We must work. People\r\nhave been very kind. Uncle Sebastian has telegraphed for two of us to go\r\nout to India; Mrs. Devonshire offers another two of us a home for as\r\nlong as we like. But I think we would all rather not accept these kind\r\noffers?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not!" cried Lucy and Phyllis in chorus, while Fanny\r\nmaintained a meek, consenting silence.\r\n\r\n"The question remains," continued the speaker; "what can we do? There is\r\nteaching, of course. We might find places as governesses; but we should\r\nbe at a great disadvantage without certificates or training of any sort.\r\nAnd we should be separated."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gertrude," cried Fanny, "you might write! You write so beautifully!\r\nI am sure you could make your fortune at it."\r\n\r\nGertrude\'s face flushed, but she controlled all other signs of the\r\nirritation which poor hapless Fan was so wont to excite in her.\r\n\r\n"I have thought about that, Fanny," she said; "but I cannot afford to\r\nwait and hammer away at the publishers\' doors with a crowd of people\r\nmore experienced and better trained than myself. No, I have another plan\r\nto propose to you all. There is one thing, at least, that we can all\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"We can all make photographs, except Fan," said Phyllis, in a doubtful\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" cried Gertrude, growing excited, and walking across to the\r\nmiddle of the room; "we can make photographs! We have had this studio,\r\nwith every proper arrangement for light and other things, so that we are\r\nnot mere amateurs. Why not turn to account the only thing we can do, and\r\nstart as professional photographers? We should all keep together. It\r\nwould be a risk, but if we failed we should be very little worse off\r\nthan before. I know what Lucy thinks of it, already. What have you\r\nothers to say to it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gertrude, need it come to that--to open a shop?" cried Fanny,\r\naghast.\r\n\r\n"Fanny, you are behind the age," said Lucy, hastily. "Don\'t you know\r\nthat it is quite distinguished to keep a shop? That poets sell\r\nwall-papers, and first-class honour men sell lamps? That Girton students\r\nmake bonnets, and are thought none the worse of for doing so?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ think it a perfectly splendid idea," cried Phyllis, sitting up; "we\r\nshall be like that good young man in _Le Nabab_."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I hope we shall not be like Andr\xe9," said Gertrude, sitting down\r\nby Phyllis on the couch and putting her arm round her, "especially as\r\nnone of us are likely to write successful tragedies by way of\r\ncompensation."\r\n\r\n"You two people are getting frivolous," remarked Lucy, severely, "and\r\nthere are so many things to consider."\r\n\r\n"First of all," answered Gertrude, "I want to convince Fanny. Think of\r\nall the dull little ways by which women, ladies, are generally reduced\r\nto earning their living! But a business--that is so different. It is\r\nprogressive; a creature capable of growth; the very qualities in which\r\nwomen\'s work is dreadfully lacking."\r\n\r\n"We have thought out a good many of the details," went on Lucy, who was\r\npossessed of less imagination than her sister, but had a clearer\r\nperception of what arguments would best appeal to Fanny\'s understanding.\r\n"It would not absorb all our capital, we have so many properties\r\nalready. We thought of buying some nice little business, such as are\r\nadvertised every week in _The British Journal_. But of course we should\r\ndo nothing rashly, nor without consulting Mr. Grimshaw."\r\n\r\n"Not for his advice," put in Gertrude, "but to arrange any transaction\r\nfor us."\r\n\r\n"Gertrude and I," went on Lucy, "would do the work, and you, Fanny, if\r\nyou would, should be our housekeeper."\r\n\r\n"And I," cried Phyllis, her great eyes shining, "I would walk up and\r\ndown outside, like that man in the High Street, who tells me every day\r\nwhat a beautiful picture I should make!"\r\n\r\n"Our photographs would be so good and our manners so charming that our\r\nfame would travel from one end of the earth to the other!" added Lucy,\r\nwith a sudden abandonment of her grave and didactic manner.\r\n\r\n"We would have afternoon tea in the studio on Sunday, to which everybody\r\nshould flock; duchesses, cabinet ministers, and Mr. Irving. We should\r\nbecome the fashion, make colossal fortunes, and ultimately marry dukes!"\r\nfinished off Gertrude.\r\n\r\nFanny looked up, helpless but unconvinced. The enthusiasm of these young\r\ncreatures had failed to communicate itself to her. Their outburst of\r\nspirits at such a time seemed to her simply shocking.\r\n\r\nAs Lucy had said, Frances Lorimer was behind the age. She was an\r\nanachronism, belonging by rights to the period when young ladies played\r\nthe harp, wore ringlets, and went into hysterics.\r\n\r\nLiving, moving, and having her being well within the vision of three\r\npairs of searching and intensely modern young eyes, poor Fan could\r\npermit herself neither these nor any kindred indulgences; but went her\r\nway with a vague, inarticulate sense of injury--a round, sentimental peg\r\nin the square, scientific hole of the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nNow, when the little tumult had in some degree subsided, she ventured\r\nonce more to address the meeting.\r\n\r\nThat was the worst of Fan; there was no standing up in fair fight and\r\nhaving it out with her; you might as soon fight a feather-bed.\r\nConvinced, to all appearances, one moment; the next, she would go back\r\nto the very point from which she had started, with that mild but\r\nterrible obstinacy of the weak.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know," she said, having once more recourse to the\r\nblack-bordered pocket-handkerchief, "what every one will think?"\r\n\r\n"Every one will be dead against it. We know that, of course," said Lucy,\r\nwith the calm confidence of untried strength.\r\n\r\nFortunately the discussion was interrupted at this juncture, by the\r\nloud voice of the gong announcing luncheon.\r\n\r\nFanny rushed off to bathe her eyes. Gertrude ran upstairs to wash her\r\nhands, and the two younger girls lingered together a few moments in the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Phyllis, with the complete and unconscious cynicism of\r\nyouth, "why Fan has never married; she has just the sort of qualities\r\nthat men seem to think desirable in a wife and a mother!"\r\n\r\n"Poor Fanny, don\'t you know?" answered Lucy. "There was a person once,\r\nages ago, but he was poor and had to go away, and Fan would have no one\r\nelse."\r\n\r\nThis was Lucy\'s version of that far away, uninteresting little romance;\r\nFanny\'s "disappointment," to which the heroine of it was fond of making\r\nvaguely pathetic allusion. Fan would have no one else, her sister had\r\nsaid; but perhaps another cause lay at the root of her constancy (and of\r\nmuch feminine constancy besides); but if Lucy did not say no one else\r\nwould have Fan, Phyllis, who was younger and more merciless, chose to\r\naccept the statement in its inverted form; which, by the by, neither\r\nshe, nor I, nor you, reader, have authentic grounds for doing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had heard about _that_ before, naturally," she answered; but\r\nfurther conversation on the subject was cut short by the appearance of\r\nFanny herself, come to summon them to the dining-room, where lunch was\r\nset out on the great table.\r\n\r\nOld Kettle, the butler, waited on them as usual, and there was nothing\r\nin the nature of the viands to bring home to them the fact of their\r\naltered circumstances; but it was a dismal meal, crowned with a sorrow\'s\r\ncrown of sorrow, the remembrance of happier things. In the vacant place\r\nthey all seemed to see the dead father, as he had been wont to sit among\r\nthem; charming, gay, _debonnair_, the life of the party; delighting no\r\nless in the light-hearted sallies of his daughters, than in his own\r\nneatly-polished epigrams; a man as brilliant as he had been\r\nunsatisfactory; as little able to cope with the hard facts of existence\r\nas he had been reckless in attacking them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, girls," said Fanny, when the door had finally closed upon Kettle;\r\n"Oh, girls, I have been thinking. If only circumstances had been\r\notherwise, if only--things had happened a little differently, I might\r\nhave had a home to offer you, a home to which you might all have come!"\r\n\r\nOvercome by this vision of possibilities, this resuscitation of her dead\r\nand buried might-have-been, Miss Lorimer began to sob quietly; and the\r\npoor eyes, which she had been at such pains to bathe, overflowed,\r\ndeluging the streaky expanses of newly-washed cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t help it, I can\'t help it," moaned this shuttlecock of fate,\r\nappealing to the stern young judges who sat silent around her; an appeal\r\nwhich, if duly considered, will seem to be even more piteous than the\r\noutbreak of emotion of which it was the cause.\r\n\r\nGertrude got up from her chair and went from the room; Phyllis sat\r\nstaring, with beautiful, unmoved, accustomed eyes; only Lucy, laying a\r\ncool hand on her half-sister\'s burning fingers, spoke words of comfort\r\nand of common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS IN NEED.\r\n\r\n     _And never say "no," when the world says "ay,"\r\n     For that is fatal._\r\n                                    E. B. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Gertrude reached her room she flung herself on the bed, and lay\r\nthere passive, with face buried from the light.\r\n\r\nShe was worn out, poor girl, with the strain of the recent weeks; a\r\nperiod into which a lifetime of events, thoughts, and experience seemed\r\nto have crowded themselves.\r\n\r\nAction, or thoughts concerned with plans of action, had become for the\r\nmoment impossible to her.\r\n\r\nShe realised, with a secret thrill of horror, that the moment had at\r\nlength come when she must look full in the face the lurking anguish of\r\nwhich none but herself knew the existence; and which, in the press of\r\nmore immediate miseries, she had hitherto contrived to keep well in the\r\nbackground of her thoughts. Only, she had known dimly throughout, that\r\nface it she must, sooner or later; and now her hour had come.\r\n\r\nThere was some one, bound to her by every tie but the tie of words, who\r\nhad let the days of her trouble go by and had made no sign; a\r\nfair-weather friend, who had fled before the storm.\r\n\r\nIn these few words are summed up the whole of Gertrude\'s commonplace\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nOnly to natures as proud and as passionate as hers, can the words convey\r\ntheir full meaning.\r\n\r\nShe was not a woman easily won; not till after long siege had come\r\nsurrender; but surrender, complete, unquestioning, as only such a woman\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\nNow, her being seemed shaken at the foundations, hurt at the vital\r\nroots. As a passionate woman will, she thought: "If it had been his\r\nmisfortune, not mine!"\r\n\r\nIn the hall lay a bit of pasteboard with "sincere condolence" inscribed\r\non it; and Gertrude had not failed to learn, from various sources, of\r\nthe presence at half a dozen balls of the owner of the card, and his\r\nprojected visit to India.\r\n\r\nGertrude rose from the bed with a choked sound, which was scarcely a\r\ncry, in her throat. She had looked her trouble fairly in the eyes; had\r\nnot, as some women would have done, attempted to save her pride by\r\nrefusing to acknowledge its existence; but from the depths of her\r\nhumiliation, had called upon it by its name. Now for ever and ever she\r\nturned from it, cast it forth from her; cast forth other things,\r\nperhaps, round which it had twined itself; but stood there, at least, a\r\nfree woman, ready for action.\r\n\r\nThank God for action; for the decree which made her to some extent the\r\narbiter of other destinies, the prop and stay of other lives. For the\r\nmoment she caught to her breast and held as a friend that weight of\r\nresponsibility which before had seemed--and how often afterwards was to\r\nseem--too heavy and too cruel a burden for her young strength.\r\n\r\n"And now," she said, setting her lips, "for a clearance."\r\n\r\nSoon the floor was strewn with a heap of papers, chiefly manuscripts,\r\nwhose dusty and battered air would have suggested to an experienced eye\r\nfrequent and fruitless visits to the region of Paternoster Row.\r\n\r\nGertrude, kneeling on the floor, bent over them with anxious face,\r\nsetting some aside, consigning others ruthlessly to the waste-paper\r\nbasket. One, larger and more travel-worn than the rest, she held some\r\ntime in her hand, as though weighing it in the balance. It was labelled:\r\n_Charlotte Corday; a tragedy in five acts_; and for a time its fate\r\nseemed uncertain; but it found its way ultimately to the basket.\r\n\r\nA smart tap at the door roused Gertrude from her somewhat melancholy\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" she cried, pushing back the straying locks from the ample\r\narch of her forehead, but retaining her seat among the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe handle turned briskly, and a blooming young woman, dressed in the\r\nheight of fashion, entered the room.\r\n\r\n"My dear Gertrude, what\'s this? Rachel weeping among her children?"\r\n\r\nShe spoke in high tones, but with an exaggeration of buoyancy which\r\nbespoke nervousness. When last these friends had met, it had been in the\r\nchamber of death itself; it was a little difficult, after that solemn\r\nmoment, to renew the every-day relations of life without shock or jar.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Conny, and if you must quote the Bible, don\'t misquote it."\r\n\r\nConstance Devonshire, heedless of her magnificent attire, cast herself\r\ndown by the side of her friend, and put her arms caressingly round her.\r\nHer quick blue eye fell upon the basket with its overflowing papers.\r\n\r\n"Gerty, what is the meaning of this massacre of the innocents?"\r\n\r\n"\'Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher,\' since you seem bent on\r\nScriptural allusion, Conny."\r\n\r\n"But, Gerty, all your tales and things! I should have thought"--she\r\nblushed as she made the suggestion--"that you might have sold them. And\r\n_Charlotte Corday_, too!"\r\n\r\n"Poor Charlotte, she has been to market so often that I cannot bear the\r\nsight of her; and now I have given her her quietus as the Republic gave\r\nit to her original. As for the other victims, they are not worth a tear,\r\nand we will not discuss them."\r\n\r\nShe gathered up the remaining manuscripts, and put them in a drawer;\r\nthen, turning to her friend with a smile, demanded from her an account\r\nof herself.\r\n\r\nMiss Devonshire\'s presence, alien as it was to her present mood, acted\r\nwith a stimulating effect on Gertrude. To Conny she knew herself to be a\r\nvery tower of strength; and such knowledge is apt to make us strong, at\r\nleast for the time being.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s nothing new about me!" answered Conny, wrinkling her\r\nhandsome, discontented face. "Gerty, why won\'t you come to us, you and\r\nLucy, and let the others go to India?"\r\n\r\nGertrude laughed at this summary disposal of the family.\r\n\r\n"Of course I knew you wouldn\'t come," said Conny, in an injured voice;\r\n"but, seriously, Gerty, what are you going to do?"\r\n\r\nIn a few words Gertrude sketched the plan which she had propounded to\r\nher sisters that morning.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it is possible," said Miss Devonshire, with great\r\npromptness; "but it sounds very nice," she added with a sigh, and\r\nthought, perhaps, of her own prosperous boredom.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang for tea, and Gertrude began brushing her hair. Constance\r\nendeavoured to seize the brush from her hands.\r\n\r\n"You are not coming down, my dear, indeed you are not! You are going to\r\nlie down, while I go and fetch your tea."\r\n\r\n"I had much rather not, Conny. I am quite well."\r\n\r\n"You look as pale as a ghost. But you always have your own way. By the\r\nby, Fred is downstairs; he walked over with me from Queen\'s Gate. He\'s\r\nthe only person who is decently civil in the house, just at present."\r\n\r\nTea had been carried into the studio, where the two girls found the rest\r\nof the party assembled. Fan, with an air of elegance, as though\r\nconscious of performing an essentially womanly function, and with much\r\naction of the little finger, was engaged in pouring out tea. In the\r\nmiddle of the room stood a group of three people: Lucy, Phyllis, and\r\nFred Devonshire, a tall, heavy young man, elaborately and correctly\r\ndressed, with a fatuous, good-natured, pink and white face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now, Miss Lucy," he was heard to say, as Gertrude entered with\r\nhis sister; "that really is too much for one to swallow!"\r\n\r\n"He won\'t believe it!" cried Phyllis, clasping her hands, and turning\r\nher charming face to the new-comers; "it\'s quite true, isn\'t it, Gerty?"\r\n\r\n"Have you been telling tales out of school?"\r\n\r\n"Lucy and I have been explaining _the plan_ to Fred, and he won\'t\r\nbelieve it."\r\n\r\nGertrude felt a little vexed at this lack of reticence on their part;\r\nbut then, she reflected, if the plan was to be carried out, it could\r\nremain no secret, especially to the Devonshires. Assured that there\r\nreally was some truth in what he had been told, Fred relapsed into an\r\namazed silence, broken by an occasional chuckle, which he hastened, each\r\ntime, to subdue, considering it out of place in a house of mourning.\r\n\r\nHe had long regarded the Lorimer girls as quite the most astonishing\r\nproductions of the age, but this last freak of theirs, as he called it,\r\nfairly took away his breath. He was a soft-hearted youth, moreover, and\r\nthe pathetic aspect of the case presented itself to him with great force\r\nin the intervals of his amusement.\r\n\r\nConstance had brought a note from her mother, and having delivered it,\r\nand had tea, she rose to go. Fred remained lost in abstraction,\r\nmuttering, "By Jove!" below his breath at intervals, the chuckling\r\nhaving subsided.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Fred!" cried his sister.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Are you slowly recovering from the shock we have given you?" asked\r\nLucy, demurely, as she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lucy," he said, solemnly, looking at her with all his foolish\r\neyes, "I\'ll come every day of the week to be photographed, if I may, and\r\nso shall all the fellows at our office!"\r\n\r\nHe was a little hurt and disconcerted, though he joined in the laugh\r\nhimself, when every one burst out laughing; even Lucy, to whom he had\r\naddressed himself as the least puzzling and most reliable of the Miss\r\nLorimers.\r\n\r\nGertrude walked down the drive with the brother and sister, a\r\ncolourless, dusky, wind-blown figure beside their radiant smartness, and\r\nlet them out herself at the big gate. Here she lingered a moment, while\r\nthe wind lifted her hair, and fanned her face, bringing a faint tinge of\r\nred to its paleness.\r\n\r\nPhyllis and Lucy opened the door of the studio which led to the garden,\r\nand stood there arm-in-arm, soothed no less than Gertrude by the chill\r\nsweetness of the April afternoon. The sound of carriage wheels roused\r\nthem from the reverie into which both of them had fallen, and in another\r\nmoment a brougham, drawn by two horses, was seen to round the curve of\r\nthe drive and make its way to the house.\r\n\r\nThe two girls retreated rapidly, shutting the door behind them.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens, Aunt Caroline!" said Lucy, in dismay.\r\n\r\n"She must have passed Gertrude at the gate; Fanny, do you hear who has\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\n"Kettle must take the tea into the drawing-room," said Fanny, in some\r\nagitation. "You know Mrs. Pratt does not like the studio."\r\n\r\nPhyllis was peeping through the panes of the door, which afforded a\r\nview of the entrance of the house.\r\n\r\n"She is getting out now; the footman has opened the carriage door, and\r\nKettle is on the steps. Oh, Lucy, if Aunt Caroline had been a horse,\r\nwhat a hard mouth she would have had!"\r\n\r\nIn another moment a great swish of garments and the sound of a metallic\r\nvoice were heard in the drawing-room, which adjoined the conservatory;\r\nand Kettle, appearing at the entrance which divided the two rooms,\r\nannounced lugubriously: "Mrs. Septimus Pratt!"\r\n\r\nA tall, angular woman, heavily draped in the crispest, most aggressive\r\nof mourning garments, was sitting upright on a sofa when the girls\r\nentered the drawing-room. She was a handsome person of her age,\r\nnotwithstanding a slightly equine cast of countenance, and the absence\r\nof anything worthy the adjectives graceful or _sympathique_ from her\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nMrs. Septimus Pratt belonged to that mischievous class of the community\r\nwhose will and energy are very far ahead of their intellect and\r\nperceptions. She had a vulgar soul and a narrow mind, and unbounded\r\nconfidence in her own judgments; but she was not bad-hearted, and was\r\nanimated, at the present moment, by a sincere desire to benefit her\r\nnieces.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, girls?" she said, speaking in that loud, authoritative\r\nkey which many benevolent persons of her sex think right to employ when\r\nvisiting their poorer neighbours. "Yes, please, Fanny, a cup of tea and\r\nsome bread-and-butter. Cake? No, thank you. I didn\'t expect to find\r\ncake!"\r\n\r\nThis last sentence, uttered with a sort of ponderous archness, as though\r\nto take off the edge of the implied rebuke, was received in unsmiling\r\nsilence; even Fanny choking down in time a protest which rose to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking of the heart, Lucy heard the handle of the door turn, and\r\nsaw Gertrude enter, pale, severe, and distant.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Gerty?" cried Aunt Caroline, "though this is not our\r\nfirst meeting. How came you to be standing at the gate, without your\r\nhat, and in that shabby gown?"\r\n\r\nFor Gertrude happened to be wearing an old black dress, having taken off\r\nthe new mourning garment before clearing out the dusty papers.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Aunt Caroline?"\r\n\r\nThe opposition between these two women may be said to have dated from\r\nthe cradle of one of them.\r\n\r\n"You ought to know at your age, Gertrude," went on Mrs. Pratt, "that\r\nnow, of all times, you must be careful in your conduct; and among other\r\nthings, you can none of you afford to be seen looking shabby."\r\n\r\nMrs. Septimus spoke, it must be owned, with considerable unction. She\r\nreally meant well by her nieces, as I have said before, but at the same\r\ntime she was very human; and that circumstances should, as she imagined,\r\nhave restored to her the right of speaking authoritatively to those\r\nindependent maidens, was a chance not to be despised. Gertrude, once\r\ndiscussing her, had said that she was a person without respect, and,\r\nindeed, a reverence for humanity, as such, could not be reckoned among\r\nher virtues.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause after her last remark, and then, to the surprise and\r\nconsternation of every one, Fanny flung herself into the breach.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Pratt," she said, vehemently, "we are poor, and we are not\r\nashamed that any one should know it. It is nothing to be ashamed of; and\r\nGertrude is the last person to do anything wrong; and I believe you know\r\nthat as well as I do!"\r\n\r\nPoor Fan\'s heroics broke off suddenly, as she encountered the steel-grey\r\neye of Mrs. Pratt fixed upon her in astonishment.\r\n\r\nOpposition in any form always shocked her inexpressibly; she really felt\r\nit to be a sort of sacrilege; but Frances Lorimer was such a poor\r\ncreature, that one could do nothing but pity her, trampled upon as she\r\nwas by her younger sisters.\r\n\r\n"Fanny is right," said Gertrude, trusting herself to speak, "we are very\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"Now do you know exactly how you stand?" went on Aunt Caroline, who\r\nallowed herself all the privileges of a near relation in the matter of\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n"It is not known yet, exactly," answered Lucy, hastily, "but Mr.\r\nDevonshire and our father\'s lawyer, and, I thought, uncle Septimus, are\r\ngoing into the matter after the sale."\r\n\r\n"So your uncle tells me. He tells me also that there will be next to\r\nnothing for you girls. Have you made up your minds what you are going\r\nto do? Which of you goes out to the Sebastian Lorimers? I hear they have\r\ntelegraphed for two. I should say Fanny and Phyllis had better go; the\r\nothers are better able to look after themselves."\r\n\r\nSilence; but not in the least disconcerted, Aunt Caroline went on.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity that none of you has married; girls don\'t seem to marry in\r\nthese days!" (with some complacency, the well-disciplined, well-dowered\r\ndaughters of the house of Pratt being in the habit of "going off" in due\r\norder and season) "but India works wonders sometimes in that respect."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let me go to India, Gerty!" cried Phyllis, in a very audible aside,\r\nwhile Gertrude bent her head and bit her lip, controlling the desire to\r\nlaugh hysterically, which the na\xefve character of her aunt\'s last remark\r\nhad excited.\r\n\r\n"Now, Gertrude and Lucy," continued the speaker, "I am empowered by your\r\nuncle" (poor Septimus!) "to offer you a home for as long as you like.\r\nEither as a permanency, or until you have found suitable occupations."\r\n\r\n"_We_ are in India, Fan, that\'s why there is no mention of us,"\r\nwhispered naughty Phyllis.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Caroline," broke in Gertrude, suddenly, lifting her head and\r\nspeaking with great decision. "You are very kind, and we thank you. But\r\nwe contemplate other arrangements."\r\n\r\n"My dear Gertrude, other arrangements! And what \'arrangements,\' pray, do\r\nyou \'contemplate\'?"\r\n\r\n"Fanny, Lucy, Phyllis, shall I tell Aunt Caroline?"\r\n\r\nThey all consented; Fanny, whose willingness to join them had seemed\r\nbefore a doubtful matter, with the greatest promptness of them all.\r\n\r\n"We think of going into business as photographers."\r\n\r\nGertrude dropped her bomb without delight. For a moment she saw herself\r\nand her sisters as they were reflected in the mind of Mrs. Septimus\r\nPratt: naughty children, idle dreamers.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline refused to be shocked, and Gertrude felt that her bomb had\r\nturned into a pea from a pea-shooter.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Pratt. "Gertrude, I wonder that you haven\'t more\r\ncommon sense. And before your younger sisters, too. But common sense,"\r\nwith unpleasant emphasis, "was never a family characteristic."\r\n\r\nLucy, who had remained silent and watchful throughout the last part of\r\nthe discussion, if discussion it could be called, now rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Caroline," she said in her clear young voice; "will you excuse us\r\nif we refuse to discuss this matter with you at present? We have decided\r\nnothing; indeed, how could we decide? Gertrude wrote yesterday to an old\r\nfriend of our father\'s, who has the knowledge and experience we want;\r\nand we are waiting now for his advice."\r\n\r\n"I think you are a set of wilful, foolish girls," cried Mrs. Pratt,\r\nlosing her temper at last; "and heaven knows what will become of you!\r\nYou are my dead sister\'s children, and I have my duties towards you, or\r\nI would wash my hands of you all from this hour. But your uncle shall\r\ntalk to you; perhaps you will listen to _him_; though there\'s no\r\nsaying."\r\n\r\nShe rose from her seat, with a purple flush on her habitually pale face,\r\nand without deigning to go through the formalities of farewell, swept\r\nfrom the room, followed by Lucy.\r\n\r\n"A good riddance!" cried Fan. She too was flushed and excited, poor\r\nsoul, with defiance.\r\n\r\nLucy, coming back from leading her aunt to the carriage, found Gertrude\r\nsilent, pale, and trembling with rage. "How dare she!" she said below\r\nher breath.\r\n\r\n"She is only very silly," answered Lucy; "I confess I began to wonder if\r\nI was an ill-conducted pauper, or a lunatic, or something of the sort,\r\nfrom the tone of her voice."\r\n\r\n"She spoke so loud," said Gertrude, pressing her hand to her head.\r\n\r\n"I never felt so labelled and docketed in my life," cried Phyllis;\r\n"_This is a poor person_, seemed to be written all over my clothes. Poor\r\nFred\'s chuckles and \'By Joves\' were much more comfortable."\r\n\r\nKettle came into the room with a letter addressed to Miss G. Lorimer.\r\n\r\n"It is from Mr. Russel," she said, examining the postmark, and broke the\r\nseal with anxious fingers.\r\n\r\nMr. Russel was the friend of their father to whom she had applied for\r\nadvice the day before. He carried on a large and world-famed business\r\nas a photographer in the north of England; to the disgust of a family\r\nthat had starved respectably on scholarship for several generations.\r\n\r\nGertrude\'s mobile face brightened as she read the letter. "Mr. Russel is\r\nmost encouraging," she said; "and very kind. He is actually coming to\r\nLondon to talk it over with us, and examine our work. And he even hints\r\nthat one of us should go back with him to learn about things; but\r\nperhaps that will not be necessary."\r\n\r\nEvery one seized on the kind letter, and the air was filled with the\r\npraises of its writer, Fanny even going so far as to call him a darling.\r\n\r\nGertrude, walking up and down the room, stopped suddenly and said: "Let\r\nus make some good resolutions!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Phyllis, with her usual frankness; "let us pave the way to\r\nhell a little!"\r\n\r\n"Firstly, we won\'t be cynical."\r\n\r\nThe motion was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n"Secondly, we will be happy."\r\n\r\nThis motion was carried, with even greater enthusiasm than the preceding\r\none.\r\n\r\n"Thirdly," put in Phyllis, coming up behind her sister, laying her\r\nnut-brown head on her shoulder, and speaking in tones of mock pathos:\r\n"Thirdly, we will never, never mention that we have seen better days!"\r\n\r\nThus, with laughing faces, they stood up and defied the Fates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWAYS AND MEANS.\r\n\r\n     _O \'tis not joy and \'tis not bliss,\r\n     Only it is precisely this\r\n         That keeps us all alive._\r\n                           A. H. CLOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n"So you are really, really going to do it, Gerty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, really, Con."\r\n\r\nIt was the day before the sale, and the two girls, Gertrude Lorimer and\r\nConstance Devonshire were walking round the garden together for the last\r\ntime. It had been a day of farewells. Only an hour ago the unfortunate\r\nFan had rolled off to Lancaster Gate in a brougham belonging to the\r\nhouse of Pratt. Lucy was now steaming on her way to the north with Mr.\r\nRussel; and upstairs Phyllis was packing her boxes before setting out\r\nfor Queen\'s Gate with Constance and her sister.\r\n\r\n"If it hadn\'t been for Mr. Russel," went on Gertrude, with enthusiasm,\r\n"the whole thing would have fallen through. Of course, all the kind,\r\ncommon-sense people opposed the scheme tooth and nail; Mr. Russel told\r\nme in confidence that he had no belief in common sense; that I was to\r\nremember that, before trusting myself to him in any respect."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think that particularly reassuring myself."\r\n\r\nGertrude laughed.\r\n\r\n"At least, he has justified it in his own case. Delightful person! he\r\nactually appeared here in the flesh, the very day after he wrote. Common\r\nsense would never have done such a thing as that."\r\n\r\n"You are very intolerant, Gertrude."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not! Well, Mr. Russel insisted on going straight to the\r\nstudio, and examining our apparatus and our work. He turned over\r\neverything, remained immersed, as it were, in photographs for such a\r\nlong time, and was throughout so silent and so serious, that I grew\r\nfrightened. At last, looking up, he said brusquely: \'This is good work.\'\r\nHe talked to us very seriously after that. Pointed out to us the\r\ninevitable risks, the chances of failure which would attend such an\r\nundertaking as ours; but wound up by saying that it was by no means a\r\npreposterous one, and that for his part, his motto through life had\r\nalways been, \'nothing venture, nothing have.\'"\r\n\r\n"Evidently a person after your own heart, Gerty."\r\n\r\n"He added, that our best plan would be, if possible, to buy the\r\ngood-will of some small business; but, as we could not afford to wait,\r\nand as our apparatus was very good as far as it went, we must not be\r\ndiscouraged if no opportunity of doing so presented itself, but had\r\nbetter start in business on our own account. Moreover, he says, if the\r\nworst comes to the worst, we should always be able to get employment as\r\nassistant photographers."\r\n\r\n"But, Gerty, why not do that at first? You would be so much more likely\r\nto succeed in business afterwards," said Conny, for her part no opponent\r\nof common sense; and who, despite much superficial frivolity, was at\r\nheart a shrewd, far-seeing daughter of the City.\r\n\r\n"If I said that one was life and the other death," answered Gertrude,\r\nwith her charming smile, "you would perhaps consider the remark unworthy\r\na woman of business. And yet I am not sure that it does not state my\r\ncase as well as any other. We want a home and an occupation, Conny; a\r\nreal, living occupation. Think of little Phyllis, for instance, trudging\r\nby herself to some great shop in all weathers and seasons!"\r\n\r\n"Little Phyllis! She is bigger than any of you, and quite able to take\r\ncare of herself."\r\n\r\n"I wish--it sounds unsisterly--that she were not so very good-looking."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good thing there\'s no person of the other sex to hear you,\r\nGerty. You would be made a text for a sermon at once."\r\n\r\n"\'Felines and Feminines,\' or something of the sort? But here is Phyllis\r\nherself."\r\n\r\nCool, careless, and debonair, the youngest Miss Lorimer advanced towards\r\nthem; the April sunshine reflected in her eyes; the tints of the\r\nblossoms outrivalled in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"My dear Gertrude," she said, patronisingly, "do you know that it is\r\ntwelve o\'clock, that my boxes are packed and locked, and that not a rag\r\nof your own is put away?"\r\n\r\nGertrude explained that she did not intend leaving the house till the\r\nafternoon, but that the other two were to go on at once to Queen\'s Gate,\r\nand not keep Mrs. Devonshire waiting for lunch. This, after some\r\nprotest, they consented to do; and in a few moments Gertrude Lorimer\r\nwas standing alone in the familiar garden, from which she was soon to be\r\nshut out for ever.\r\n\r\nPacing slowly up and down the oft-trodden path, she strove to collect\r\nher thoughts; to review, at leisure, the events of the last few days.\r\nHer avowed contempt of the popular idol Common Sense notwithstanding,\r\nher mind teemed with practical details, with importunate questionings as\r\nto ways and means.\r\n\r\nThese matters seemed more perplexing without the calm and soothing\r\ninfluence of Lucy\'s presence; for Lucy had been borne off by the\r\nbenevolent and eccentric Mr. Russel for a three-months\' apprenticeship\r\nin his own flourishing establishment.\r\n\r\n"I will see that your sister learns something of the management of a\r\nbusiness, besides improving herself in those technical points which we\r\nhave already discussed," had been his parting assurance. "While, as for\r\nyou, Miss Lorimer, I depend on you to look round, and be on a fair way\r\nto settling down by the time the three months are up. Perhaps, one of\r\nthese days, we shall prevail on you to pay us a visit yourself."\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that for the immediate present Gertrude and Phyllis\r\nshould avail themselves of the Devonshires\' invitation; while Fan, borne\r\ndown by the force of a superior will, had been prevailed upon to seek a\r\ntemporary refuge at the house of Mrs. Septimus Pratt.\r\n\r\nPoor Aunt Caroline had been really shocked and pained by the firm,\r\nthough polite, refusal of her nieces to accept her hospitality. Their\r\ndifferences of opinion notwithstanding, she could see no adequate cause\r\nfor it. If her skin was thick, her heart was not of stone; and it\r\nchagrined her to think that her dead sister\'s children should, at such a\r\ntime, prefer the house of strangers to her own.\r\n\r\nBut the young people were obdurate; and she had had at last to content\r\nherself with Fan, who was a poor creature, and only a spurious sort of\r\nrelation after all.\r\n\r\nReviewing one by one all those facts which bore upon her present case;\r\nsetting in order her thoughts; and gathering up her energies for the\r\nfight to come; Gertrude felt her pulses throb, and her bosom glow with\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nOf the darker possibilities of human nature and of life, this girl--who\r\nbelieved herself old, and experienced--had no knowledge, save such as\r\nhad come to her in brief flashes of insight, in passing glimpses\r\nscarcely realised or remembered. Even had circumstances given her\r\nleisure, she was not a woman to have brooded over the one personal\r\ninjury which had been dealt her; her pride was too deep and too delicate\r\nfor this; rather she recoiled from the thought of it, as from an unclean\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nIf the arching forehead and mobile face bespoke imagination and keen\r\nsensibilities, the square jaw and resolute mouth gave token, no less, of\r\nstrength and self-control.\r\n\r\n\r\n     "And all her sorrow shall be turned to labour,"\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid Gertrude to herself, half-unconsciously. Then something within her\r\nlaughed in scornful protest. Sorrow? on this spring day, with the young\r\nlife coursing in her veins, with all the world before her, an\r\nundiscovered country of purple mists and boundless possibilities.\r\n\r\nThere were hints of a vague delight in the sweet, keen air; whisperings,\r\npromises, that had nothing to do with pyrogallic acid and acetate of\r\nsoda; with the processes of developing, fixing, or intensifying.\r\n\r\nA great laburnum tree stood at one end of the lawn, half-flowered and\r\nfaintly golden; a blossoming almond neighboured it, and beyond, rose a\r\ngnarled old apple tree, pink with buds. Birds were piping and calling to\r\none another from all the branches; the leaves of the trees, the lawn,\r\nthe shrubs, and bushes, wore the vivid and delicate verdure of early\r\nspring; life throbbed, and pulsed, and thrust itself forth in every\r\navailable spot.\r\n\r\nGertrude, as we know, was by way of being a poet. She had a rebellious\r\nheart that cried out, sometimes very inopportunely, for happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as she drank in the wonders of that April morning, she found\r\nherself suddenly assailed and overwhelmed by a nameless rapture, an\r\nextreme longing, half-hopeful, half-despairing.\r\n\r\nSorrow, labour; what had she to do with these?\r\n\r\n\r\n     "I love all things that thou lovest\r\n           Spirit of delight!"\r\n\r\n\r\ncried the voices within her, with one accord.\r\n\r\n"Please, Miss," said Kettle, suddenly appearing, and scattering the\r\nthronging visions rather rudely; "the people have come from the\r\nPantechnicon about those cameras, and the other things you said was to\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," answered Gertrude, rubbing her eyes and wrinkling her\r\nbrows--curious, characteristic brows they were; straight and thick, and\r\nconverging slightly upwards--"everything that is to go is ready packed\r\nin the studio."\r\n\r\nThey had decided on retaining a little furniture, besides the\r\nphotographic apparatus and studio fittings, for the establishment of the\r\nnew home, wherever and whatever it should be.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Miss Gertrude. And shall I bring you up a little luncheon?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, Kettle. And I must say good-bye, and thank you for all\r\nyour kindness to us."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Miss Gertrude, every one of you! I have made so bold as\r\nto give my address-card to Miss Phyllis; and if there\'s anything in\r\nwhich I can ever be of service, don\'t you think twice about it, but\r\nwrite off at once to Jonah Kettle."\r\n\r\nOvercome by his own eloquence, and without waiting for a reply, the old\r\nman shuffled off down the path, leaving Gertrude strangely touched by\r\nthis unexpected demonstration.\r\n\r\n"We resolved not to be cynical," she thought. "Cynical! What is the\r\nmeaning of the current commonplaces as to loss of friends with loss of\r\nfortune? How did they arise? What perverseness of vision could have led\r\nto the creation of such a person as Timon of Athens, for instance? If\r\nmisery parts the flux of company, surely it is the miserable people\'s\r\nown fault."\r\n\r\nBalancing the mass of friends in need against one who was only a\r\nfair-weather friend, Gertrude refused to allow her faith in humanity to\r\nbe shaken.\r\n\r\nAh, Gertrude, but it is early days!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNUMBER TWENTY B.\r\n\r\n     _Bravant le monde et les sots et les sages,\r\n     Sans avenir, riche de mon printemps,\r\n     L\'este et joyeux je montais six \xe9tages,\r\n     Dans un grenier qu\'on est bien a vingt ans!_\r\n                                       BERANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lorimers\' tenacity of purpose, backed by Mr. Russel\'s support and\r\ncountenance, at last succeeded in procuring them a respectful hearing\r\nfrom the few friends and relatives who had a right to be interested in\r\ntheir affairs.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline, shifting her ground, ceased to talk of the scheme as\r\nbeneath contempt, but denounced it as dangerous and unwomanly.\r\n\r\nShe spoke freely of loss of caste; damage to prospects--vague and\r\ndelicate possession of the female sex--and of the complicated evils\r\nwhich must necessarily arise from an undertaking so completely devoid of\r\nchaperons.\r\n\r\nUncle Septimus said little, but managed to convey to his nieces quiet\r\nmarks of support and sympathy; while the Devonshires, after much\r\npreliminary opposition, had ended by throwing themselves, like the\r\nexcellent people they were, heart and soul into the scheme.\r\n\r\nTo Constance, indeed, the change in her friends\' affairs may be said to\r\nhave come, like the Waverley pen, as a boon and a blessing. She was the\r\nsomebody to whom their ill wind, though she knew it not, was blowing\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nLike many girls of her class, she had good faculties, abundant vitality,\r\nand no interests but frivolous ones. And with the wealthy\r\nmiddle-classes, even the social business is apt to be less\r\nunintermittent, less absorbing, than with the better born seekers after\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nHer friendship with the Lorimers, with Gertrude especially, may be said\r\nto have represented the one serious element in Constance Devonshire\'s\r\nlife. And now she threw herself with immense zeal and devotion into the\r\nabsorbing business of house-hunting, on which, for the time being, all\r\nGertrude\'s thoughts were centred.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale, and the winding up (mysterious process) of poor Mr.\r\nLorimer\'s affairs, it was intimated to the girls that they were the\r\njoint possessors of \xa3600; not a large sum, when regarded as almost the\r\nentire fortune of four people, but slightly in excess of that which they\r\nhad been led to expect. I said almost, for it must not be forgotten that\r\nFanny had a modest income of \xa350 coming to her from her mother, of which\r\nthe principal was tied up from her reach.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing now to do but to choose their quarters, settle down in\r\nthem, and begin the enterprise on which they were bent.\r\n\r\nFor many weary days, Gertrude and Conny, sometimes accompanied by Fred\r\nor Mr. Devonshire, paced the town from end to end, laden with sheaves of\r\n"orders to view" from innumerable house-agents.\r\n\r\nPhyllis was too delicate for such expeditions, and sat at home with Mrs.\r\nDevonshire, or drove out shopping; amiable but ironical; buoyant but\r\nnever exuberant; the charming child that everybody conspired to spoil,\r\nthat everybody instinctively screened from all unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nOne day, the two girls came back to Queen\'s Gate in a state of\r\nconsiderable excitement.\r\n\r\n"It certainly is the most likely place we have seen," said Gertrude, as\r\nshe sipped her tea, and blinked at the fire with dazzled, short-sighted\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"But such miles away from South Kensington," grumbled Conny, unfastening\r\nher rich cloak, and falling upon the cake with all the appetite born of\r\nhonest labour.\r\n\r\n"And the rent is a little high; but Mr. Russel says it would be bad\r\neconomy to start in some cheap, obscure place."\r\n\r\n"So we are to flaunt expensively," said Phyllis, lightly; "but all this\r\nis very vague, is it not Mrs. Devonshire? Please be more definite, Gerty\r\ndear."\r\n\r\n"We have been looking at some rooms in Upper Baker Street," explained\r\nGertrude, addressing her hostess; "there are two floors to be let\r\nunfurnished, above a chemist\'s shop."\r\n\r\n"Two floors, and what else?" cried Conny; "you will never guess!\r\nActually a photographer\'s studio built out from the house."\r\n\r\nMrs. Devonshire disapproved secretly of their scheme, and had only been\r\nwon over to countenance it after days of persuasion.\r\n\r\n"Some one has been failing in business there," she said, "or why should\r\nthe studio stand empty?"\r\n\r\nThe girls felt this to be a little unreasonable, but Gertrude only\r\nlaughed, and said: "No, but somebody has been dying. Our predecessor in\r\nbusiness died last year."\r\n\r\n"At least we should be provided with a ghost at once," said Phyllis; "I\r\nsuppose if we go there we shall be \'Lorimer, late so-and-so?\'"\r\n\r\n"What ghouls you two are!" objected Conny, with a shudder; then resumed\r\nthe more practical part of the conversation. "The studio is in rather a\r\ndilapidated condition; but if it were not it would only count for more\r\nin the rent; it has to be paid for one way or another."\r\n\r\n"There are a great many photographers in Baker Street already," demurred\r\nMrs. Devonshire.\r\n\r\nShe liked the Lorimers, but feared them as companions for her daughter;\r\nthere was no knowing on what wild freak they might lead Constance to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Devonshire," protested Gertrude, with great eagerness, "I am\r\ntold that it is the right thing for people of the same trade to\r\ncongregate together; they combine, as it were, to make a centre, which\r\ncomes to be regarded as the emporium of their particular wares."\r\n\r\nGertrude laughed at her own phrases, and Phyllis said:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look so poetical over it all, Gerty! Your hat has found its way\r\nto the back of your head, and there is a general look of inspiration\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\nShe straightened the hat as she spoke, and put back the straggling wisps\r\nof hair.\r\n\r\n"There is no bath-room!" went on Conny, sternly. She had a love of\r\npractical details and small opportunity for indulging it, except with\r\nregard to her own costume; and now she proceeded to plunge into\r\nelaborate statements on the subject of hot water, and the practicability\r\nof having it brought up in cans.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that an expedition to Baker Street was organised for\r\nthe next day; when the whole party drove across the park to that\r\npleasant, if unfashionable, region, for the purpose of inspecting the\r\nhopeful premises.\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, bright afternoon, and notwithstanding that it was the\r\nend of May, the girls wore their winter cloaks, and Mrs. Devonshire her\r\nfurs.\r\n\r\n"What number did you say, Gertrude?" asked Phyllis, as the carriage\r\nturned into New Street, from Gloucester Place.\r\n\r\n"Twenty B."\r\n\r\nAs they came into Baker Street, a young man, slim, high-coloured,\r\ndark-haired, darted out, with some impetuosity, from the post-office at\r\nthe corner, and raised his hat as his eye fell on the approaching\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nConstance bowed, colouring slightly.\r\n\r\n"Who is your friend, Conny?" said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a man I meet sometimes at dances. I believe his name is Jermyn. He\r\ndances rather well."\r\n\r\nConny spoke with somewhat exaggerated indifference, and the colour on\r\nher cheek deepened perceptibly.\r\n\r\n"Here we are!" cried Phyllis.\r\n\r\nThe carriage had drawn up before a small, but flourishing-looking shop,\r\nabove which was painted in gold letters; _Maryon; Pharmaceutical\r\nChemist_.\r\n\r\n"This is it."\r\n\r\nGertrude spoke with curious intensity, and her heart beat fast as they\r\ndismounted and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon, the chemist\'s wife, a thin, thoughtful-looking woman of\r\nmiddle-age, with a face at once melancholy and benevolent, opened the\r\ndoor to them herself, and conducted them over the apartments.\r\n\r\nThey went up a short flight of stairs, then stopped before the opening\r\nof a narrow passage, adorned with Virginia cork and coloured glass.\r\n\r\n"We will look at the studio first, please," said Gertrude, and they all\r\ntrooped down the little, sloping passage.\r\n\r\n"Reminds one forcibly of a summer-house at a tea-garden, doesn\'t it?"\r\nsaid Phyllis, turning her pretty head from side to side. They laughed,\r\nand the melancholy woman was seen to smile.\r\n\r\nBeyond the passage was a little room, designed, no doubt, for a waiting\r\nor dressing-room; and beyond this, divided by an aperture, evidently\r\nintended for curtains, came the studio itself, a fair-sized glass\r\nstructure, in some need of repair.\r\n\r\n"You will have to make this place as pretty as possible," said Conny;\r\n"you will be nothing if not \xe6sthetic. And now for the rooms."\r\n\r\nThe floor immediately above the shop had been let to a dressmaker, and\r\nit was the two upper floors which stood vacant.\r\n\r\nOn the first of these was a fair-sized room with two windows, looking\r\nout on the street, divided by folding doors from a smaller room with a\r\ncorner fire-place.\r\n\r\n"This would make a capital sitting-room," said Conny, marching up and\r\ndown the larger apartment.\r\n\r\n"And this," cried Gertrude, from behind the folding-doors, which stood\r\najar, "could be fitted up beautifully as a kitchen."\r\n\r\n"You will have to have a kitchen-range, my dears," remarked Mrs.\r\nDevonshire, who was becoming deeply interested, and whose spirits,\r\nmoreover, were rising under the sense that here, at least, she could\r\nspeak to the young people from the heights of knowledge and experience;\r\n"and water will have to be laid on; and you will certainly need a\r\nsink."\r\n\r\n"This grey wall-paper," went on Conny, "is not pretty, but at least it\r\nis inoffensive."\r\n\r\n"And the possibilities for evil of wall-papers being practically\r\ninfinite, I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies in that\r\nrespect," answered Gertrude, emerging from her projected kitchen, and\r\nbeginning to examine the uninteresting decoration in her short-sighted\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nUpstairs were three rooms, capable of accommodating four people as\r\nbed-rooms, and which bounded the little domain.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Maryon and their servant inhabited the basement and the\r\nparlour behind the shop; and it was suggested by the chemist\'s wife\r\nthat, for the present at least, the ladies might like to enter on some\r\narrangement for sharing Matilda\'s services; the duties of that maiden,\r\nas matters now stood, not being nearly enough to fill up her time.\r\n\r\n"That would suit us admirably," answered Gertrude; "for we intend to do\r\na great deal of the work ourselves."\r\n\r\nThey drove away in hopeful mood; Mrs. Devonshire as much interested as\r\nany of them. It took, of course, some days before they were able to come\r\nto a final decision on the subject of the rooms. Various persons had to\r\nbe consulted, and various matters inquired into. Mr. Russel came flying\r\ndown from the north directly Gertrude\'s letter reached him. He surveyed\r\nthe premises in his rapid, accurate fashion; entered into details with\r\nimmense seriousness; pronounced in favour of taking the apartments; gave\r\na glowing account of Lucy; and rushed off to catch his train.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the Lorimers found themselves the holders of a\r\nlease, terminable at one, three, or seven years, for a studio and upper\r\npart of the house, known as 20B, Upper Baker Street.\r\n\r\nThen followed a period of absorbing and unremitting toil. All through\r\nthe sweet June month the girls laboured at setting things in order in\r\nthe new home. Expense being a matter of vital consequence, they\r\nendeavoured to do everything, within the limits of possibility,\r\nthemselves. Workmen were of course needed for repairing the studio and\r\nfitting the kitchen fire-place, but their services were dispensed with\r\nin almost every other case. The furniture stored at the Pantechnicon\r\nproved more than enough for their present needs; Gertrude and Conny\r\nbetween them laid down the carpets and hung up the curtains; and Fred,\r\nrevealing an unsuspected talent for carpentering, occupied his leisure\r\nmoments in providing the household with an unlimited quantity of\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the spectacle of that gorgeous youth hammering away in his shirt\r\nsleeves on a pair of steps, his immaculate hat and coat laid by, his\r\ngardenia languishing in some forgotten nook, was one not easily to be\r\noverlooked or forgotten. It was necessary, of course, to buy some\r\nadditional stock-in-trade, and this Mr. Russel undertook to procure for\r\nthem at the lowest possible rates; adding, on his own behalf, a large\r\nburnishing machine. The girls had hitherto been accustomed to have their\r\nprints rolled for them by the Stereoscopic Company.\r\n\r\nIn their own rooms everything was of the simplest, but a more ambitious\r\nstyle of decoration was attempted in the studio.\r\n\r\nThe objectionable Virginia cork and coloured glass of the little passage\r\nwere disguised by various \xe6sthetic devices; lanterns swung from the\r\nroof, and a framed photograph or two from D\xfcrer and Botticelli, Watts\r\nand Burne-Jones, was mingled artfully with the specimens of their own\r\nwork which adorned it as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nA little cheap Japanese china, and a few red-legged tables and chairs\r\nconverted the waiting-room, as Phyllis said, into a perfect bower of art\r\nand culture; while Fred contributed so many rustic windows, stiles and\r\ncanvas backgrounds to the studio, that his bankruptcy was declared on\r\nall sides to be imminent.\r\n\r\nOver the street-door was fixed a large black board, on which was painted\r\nin gold letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n     G. & L. LORIMER: THE PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO\r\n\r\n\r\nand in the doorway was displayed a showcase, whose most conspicuous\r\nfeature was a cabinet portrait of Fred Devonshire, looking, with an air\r\nof mingled archness and shamefacedness, through one of his own elaborate\r\nlattices in Virginia cork.\r\n\r\nThe Maryons surveyed these preparations from afar with a certain amused\r\ncompassion, an incredulous kindliness, which were rather exasperating.\r\n\r\nLike most people of their class, they had seen too much of the ups and\r\ndowns of life to be astonished at anything; and the sight of these\r\nladies playing at photographers and house decorators, was only one more\r\nscene in the varied and curious drama of life which it was their lot to\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\n"I wish," said Gertrude, one day, "that Mrs. Maryon were not such a\r\npessimist."\r\n\r\n"She _is_ rather like Gilbert\'s patent hag who comes out and prophesies\r\ndisaster," answered Phyllis. "She always thinks it is going to rain, and\r\nnothing surprises her so much as when a parcel arrives in time."\r\n\r\n"And she is so very kind with it all."\r\n\r\nThe sisters had been alone in Baker Street that morning; Constance being\r\nengaged in having a ball-dress tried on at Russell and Allen\'s; and now\r\nGertrude was about to set out for the British Museum, where she was\r\ngoing through a course of photographic reading, under the direction of\r\nMr. Russel.\r\n\r\n"Look," cried Phyllis, as they emerged from the house; "there goes\r\nConny\'s impetuous friend. I have found out that he lodges just opposite\r\nus, over the auctioneer\'s."\r\n\r\n"What busybodies you long-sighted people always are, Phyllis!"\r\n\r\nAt Baker Street Station they parted; Phyllis disappearing to the\r\nunderground railway; Gertrude mounting boldly to the top of an Atlas\r\nomnibus.\r\n\r\n"Because one cannot afford a carriage or even a hansom cab," she argued\r\nto herself, "is one to be shut up away from the sunlight and the\r\nstreets?"\r\n\r\nIndeed, for Gertrude, the humours of the town had always possessed a\r\ncurious fascination. She contemplated the familiar London pageant with\r\nan interest that had something of passion in it; and, for her part, was\r\nnever inclined to quarrel with the fate which had transported her from\r\nthe comparative tameness of Campden Hill to regions where the pulses of\r\nthe great city could be felt distinctly as they beat and throbbed.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June the premises in Upper Baker Street were quite ready\r\nfor occupation; but Gertrude and Phyllis decided to avail themselves of\r\nsome of their numerous invitations, and strengthen themselves for the\r\ncoming tussle with fortune with three or four weeks of country air.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a memorable evening, late in July, when the four\r\nsisters met for the first time under the roof which they hoped was to\r\nshelter them for many years to come.\r\n\r\nGertrude and Phyllis arrived early in the day from Scarborough, where\r\nthey had been staying with the Devonshires, and at about six o\'clock\r\nFanny appeared in a four-wheel cab; she had been borne off to Tunbridge\r\nWells by the Pratts, some six weeks before.\r\n\r\nWhen she had given vent to her delight at rejoining her sisters, and had\r\ninspected the new home, Phyllis led her upstairs to the bedroom,\r\nGertrude remaining below in the sitting-room, which she paced with a\r\ncurious excitement, an irrepressible restlessness.\r\n\r\n"Poor old Fan!" said Phyllis, re-appearing; "I don\'t think she was ever\r\nso pleased at seeing any one before."\r\n\r\n"Fancy, all these months with Aunt Caroline!"\r\n\r\n"She says little," went on Phyllis; "but from the few remarks dropped, I\r\nshould say that her sufferings had been pretty severe."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Gertrude, absently. The last remark had fallen on\r\nunheeding ears; her attention was entirely absorbed by a cab which had\r\nstopped before the door. One moment, and she was on the stairs; the\r\nnext, she and Lucy were in one another\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gerty, is it a hundred years?"\r\n\r\n"Thousands, Lucy. How well you look, and I believe you have grown."\r\n\r\nUp and down, hand in hand, went the sisters, into every nook and corner\r\nof the small domain, exclaiming, explaining, asking and answering a\r\nhundred questions.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy," cried Gertrude, in a burst of enthusiasm, as they stood\r\ntogether in the studio, "this is work, this is life. I think we have\r\nnever worked or lived before."\r\n\r\nFan and Phyllis came rustling between the curtains to join them.\r\n\r\n"Here we all are," went on Gertrude. "I hope nobody is afraid, but that\r\nevery one understands that this is no bed of roses we have prepared for\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"We shall have to work like niggers, and not have very much to eat. I\r\nthink we all realise that," said Lucy, with an encouraging smile.\r\n\r\n"Plain living and high thinking," ventured Fanny; then grew overwhelmed\r\nwith confusion at her own unwonted brilliancy.\r\n\r\n"At least," said Phyllis, "we can all of us manage the plain living. And\r\nas a beginning, I vote we go upstairs to supper."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHIS WORKING-DAY WORLD.\r\n\r\n     _O the pity of it._\r\n                OTHELLO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a sudden reverse of fortune need not make us cynical, there is\r\nperhaps no other experience which brings us face to face so quickly and\r\nso closely with the realities of life.\r\n\r\nThe Lorimers, indeed, had no great cause for complaint; and perhaps, in\r\ncondemning the Timons of this world, forgot that, as interesting young\r\nwomen, embarked moreover on an interesting enterprise, they were not\r\nthemselves in a position to gauge the full depths of mundane perfidy.\r\n\r\nOf course, after a time, they dropped off from the old set, from the\r\npeople with whom their intercourse had been a mere matter of social\r\ncommerce; but, as Phyllis justly observed, when you have no time to pay\r\ncalls, no clothes to your back, no money for cabs, and very little for\r\nomnibuses, you can hardly expect your career to be an unbroken course of\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of their friends drew closer to them in the hour\r\nof need, and a great many good-natured acquaintances amused themselves\r\nby patronising the studio in Upper Baker Street, and recommending other\r\npeople to go and do likewise.\r\n\r\nCertainly these latter exacted a good deal for their money; were restive\r\nwhen posed, expected the utmost excellence of work and punctuality of\r\ndelivery, and, like most of the Lorimers\' customers, seemed to think the\r\nsex of the photographers a ground for greater cheapness in the\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nOne evening, towards the middle of October, the girls had assembled for\r\nthe evening meal--it could not, strictly speaking, be called dinner--in\r\nthe little sitting-room above the shop.\r\n\r\nThey were all tired, for the moment discouraged, and had much ado to\r\nmaintain that cheerfulness which they held it a point of honour never to\r\nabandon.\r\n\r\n"How the evenings do draw in!" observed Fan, who sat near the window,\r\nengaged in fancy-work.\r\n\r\nFanny\'s housekeeping, by the way, had been tried, and found wanting; and\r\nthe poor lady had, with great delicacy, been relegated to the vague duty\r\nof creating an atmosphere of home for her more strong-minded sisters.\r\nFortunately, she believed in the necessity of a thoroughly womanly\r\npresence among them, womanliness being apparently represented to her\r\nmind by any number of riband bows on the curtains, antimacassars on the\r\nchairs, and strips of embroidered plush on every available article of\r\nfurniture; and accepted the situation without misgiving.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Lucy, rather dismally; "we shall soon have the winter in\r\nfull swing, fogs and all."\r\n\r\nShe had been up to the studio of an artist at St. John\'s Wood that\r\nmorning, making photographs of various studies of drapery for a big\r\npicture, and the results, when examined in the dark-room later on, had\r\nnot been satisfactory; hence her unusual depression of spirits.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, Lucy, don\'t speak in that tone!" cried Phyllis,\r\nwho was standing idly by the window. "What does it matter about Mr.\r\nLawrence\'s draperies? Nobody ever buys his pokey pictures. You\'ve not\r\nbeen the same person ever since you developed those plates this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see, Phyllis, Mr. Russel introduced us to him; and besides,\r\nthough he is obscure himself, he might recommend us to other artists if\r\nthe work was well done."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother! Come over here, Lucy. Do you see that lighted window\r\nopposite? It is Conny\'s Mr. Jermyn\'s."\r\n\r\n"What an interesting fact!"\r\n\r\n"Conny said he danced well. I wish he would come and dance with us\r\nsometimes. It is ages and ages since I had a really good waltz."\r\n\r\n"Phyllis! do you forget that you are in mourning?" cried Fanny, shocked,\r\nas she moved towards the table, where Lucy had lit the lamp.\r\n\r\nGertrude came through the folding-doors bearing a covered dish. Her\r\naspect also was undeniably dejected. Business had been slacker, if\r\npossible, than usual, during the past week; regarded from no point of\r\nview could their prospects be considered brilliant; and, to crown all,\r\nAunt Caroline had paid them a visit in the course of the day, in which\r\nshe had propounded some very direct questions as to the state of their\r\nfinances; questions which it had been both difficult to answer and\r\ndifficult to evade.\r\n\r\nPhyllis ceased her chatter, which she saw at once to be out of harmony\r\nwith the prevailing mood, and took her place in silence at the table.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the studio-bell echoed with considerable violence\r\nthroughout the house.\r\n\r\n"What can any one want this time of night?" cried Fan, in some\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n"They must have pulled the wrong bell," said Lucy; "but one of us had\r\nbetter go down and see."\r\n\r\nGertrude lighted a candle, and went downstairs, and the rest proceeded\r\nrather silently with their meal.\r\n\r\nIn about five minutes Gertrude re-appeared with a grave face.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nThey all questioned her, with lips and eyes.\r\n\r\n"Some one has been here about work," she said, slowly; "but it\'s rather\r\na dismal sort of job. It is to photograph a dead person."\r\n\r\n"Gerty, what _do_ you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe it is quite usual. A lady--Lady Watergate--died to-day,\r\nand her husband wishes the body to be photographed to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"It is very strange," said Fanny, "that he should select ladies, young\r\ngirls, for such a piece of work!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was a mere chance. It was the housekeeper who came, and we\r\nhappened to be the first photographer\'s shop she passed. She seemed to\r\nthink I might not like it, but we cannot afford to refuse work."\r\n\r\n"But, Gertrude," cried Fan, "do you know what Lady Watergate died of?\r\nPerhaps scarlet fever, or smallpox, or something of the sort."\r\n\r\n"She died of consumption," said Gertrude shortly, and put her arm round\r\nPhyllis, who was listening with a curious look in her great, dilated\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," put in Lucy, "if this poor lady can be the wife of _the_\r\nLord Watergate?"\r\n\r\n"I rather fancy so; I know he lives in Regent\'s Park, and the address\r\nfor to-morrow is Sussex Place."\r\n\r\nA name so well known in the scientific and literary world was of course\r\nfamiliar to the Lorimers. They had, however, little personal\r\nacquaintance with distinguished people, and had never come across the\r\nlearned and courteous peer in his social capacity, his frequent presence\r\nin certain middle-class circles notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon, coming up later on for a chat, under pretext of discussing\r\nthe unsatisfactory Matilda, was informed of the new commission.\r\n\r\n"Ah," she said, shaking her head, "it was a sad story that of the\r\nWatergates." So passionately fond of her as he had been, and then for\r\nher to treat him like that! But he took her back at the last and forgave\r\nher everything, like the great-hearted gentleman that he was. "And do\r\nyou mean," she added, fixing her melancholy, humorous eyes on them,\r\n"that you young ladies are actually going by yourselves to the house to\r\nmake a picture of the body?"\r\n\r\n"I am going--no one else," answered Gertrude calmly, passing over\r\nPhyllis\'s avowed intention of accompanying her.\r\n\r\n"She always has some dreadful tale about everybody you mention," cried\r\nLucy, indignantly, when Mrs. Maryon had gone. "She will never rest\r\ncontent until there is something dreadful to tell of us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m sure she regards us as so many future additions to her Chamber\r\nof Horrors," said Phyllis, reflectively, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"And oh," added Fan, "if she would only not compare us so constantly\r\nwith that poor man who had the studio last year! It makes one positively\r\ncreep."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Gertrude; "she is quite as fond of pleasant events as\r\nsad ones. Weddings, for instance, she describes with as much unction as\r\nfunerals."\r\n\r\n"We will certainly do our best to add to her stock of tales in that\r\nrespect," cried Phyllis, with an odd burst of high spirits. "Who votes\r\nfor getting married? I do. So do you, don\'t you, Fan? It must be such\r\nfun to have one\'s favourite man dropping in on one every evening."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt an early hour the next morning, Gertrude Lorimer started on her\r\nerrand. She went alone; Lucy of course must remain in the studio;\r\nPhyllis was in bed with a headache, and Fan was ministering to her\r\nnumerous wants. As she passed out, laden with her apparatus, Mdlle.\r\nSt\xe9phanie, the big, sallow Frenchwoman who occupied the first floor,\r\nentered the house and grinned a vivacious "_Bon jour!_"\r\n\r\n"A fine, bright morning for your work, miss!" cried the chemist from his\r\ndoorstep; while his wife stood at his side, smiling curiously.\r\n\r\nGertrude went on her way with a considerable sinking of the heart. She\r\nhad no difficulty in finding Sussex Place; indeed, she had often\r\nremarked it; the white curve of houses with the columns, the cupolas,\r\nand the railed-in space of garden which fronted the Park.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate\'s house was situated about midway in the terrace.\r\nGertrude, on arriving, was shown into a large dining-room, darkened by\r\nblinds, and decorated in each gloomy corner by greenish figures of a\r\npseudo-classical nature, which served the purpose of supports to the\r\ngas-globes.\r\n\r\nAt least a quarter of an hour elapsed before the appearance of the\r\nhousekeeper, who ushered her up the darkened stairs to a large room on\r\nthe second storey.\r\n\r\nHere the blinds had been raised, and for a moment Gertrude was too\r\ndazzled to be aware with any clearness of her surroundings.\r\n\r\nAs her eyes grew accustomed to the light, she perceived herself to be\r\nstanding in a daintily-furnished sleeping apartment, whose open windows\r\nafforded glimpses of an unbroken prospect of wood, and lawn, and water.\r\n\r\nDrawn forward to the middle of the room, well within the light from the\r\nwindows, was a small, open bedstead of wrought brass. A woman lay, to\r\nall appearance, sleeping there, the bright October sunlight falling full\r\non the upturned face, on the spread and shining masses of matchless\r\ngolden hair. A woman no longer in her first youth; haggard with\r\nsickness, pale with the last strange pallor, but beautiful withal,\r\nexquisitely, astonishingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnother figure, that of a man, was seated by the window, in a pose as\r\nfixed, as motionless, as that of the dead woman herself.\r\n\r\nGertrude, as she silently made preparations for her strange task,\r\ninstinctively refrained from glancing in the direction of this second\r\nfigure; and had only the vaguest impression of a dark, bowed head, and a\r\nbearded, averted face.\r\n\r\nShe delivered a few necessary directions to the housekeeper, in the\r\nlowest audible voice, then, her faculties stimulated to curious\r\naccuracy, set to work with camera and slides.\r\n\r\nAs she stood, her apparatus gathered up, on the point of departure, the\r\nman by the window rose suddenly, and for the first time seemed aware of\r\nher presence.\r\n\r\nFor one brief, but vivid moment, her eyes encountered the glance of two\r\nmiserable grey eyes, looking out with a sort of dazed wonder from a pale\r\nand sunken face. The broad forehead, projecting over the eyes; the fine,\r\nbut rough-hewn features; the brown hair and beard; the tall, stooping,\r\nsinewy figure: these together formed a picture which imprinted itself as\r\nby a flash on Gertrude\'s overwrought consciousness, and was destined not\r\nto fade for many days to come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"They are some of the best work you have ever done, Gerty," cried\r\nPhyllis, peering over her sister\'s shoulder. The habits of this young\r\nperson, as we know, resembled those of the lilies of the field; but she\r\nchose to pervade the studio when nothing better offered itself, and in\r\nmoments of boredom even to occupy herself with some of the more pleasant\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked thoughtfully at the prints in her hand. They represented\r\na woman lying dead or asleep, with her hair spread out on the pillow.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, slowly, "they have succeeded better than I expected. Of\r\ncourse the light was not all that could be wished."\r\n\r\n"Poor thing," said Phyllis; "what perfect features she has. Mrs. Maryon\r\ntold us she was wicked, didn\'t she? But I don\'t know that it matters\r\nabout being good when you are as beautiful as all that."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTO THE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n     _We studied hard in our styles,\r\n       Chipped each at a crust like Hindoos,\r\n     For air, looked out on the tiles,\r\n       For fun, watched each other\'s windows._\r\n                                 R. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Mr. Frederick Devonshire, I positively refuse to minister any longer to\r\nsuch gross egotism! You\'ve been cabinetted, vignetted, and carte de\r\nvisited. You\'ve been taken in a snowstorm; you\'ve been taken looking out\r\nof window, drinking afternoon tea, and doing I don\'t know what else. If\r\nyour vanity still remains unsatisfied, you must get another firm to\r\ngorge it for you."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nice woman of business, you are! Turning money away from the\r\ndoors like this," chuckled Fred. Lucy\'s simple badinage appealed to him\r\nas the raciest witticisms would probably have failed to do; it seemed to\r\nhim almost on a par with the brilliant verbal coruscations of his\r\ncherished _Sporting Times_.\r\n\r\n"Our business," answered Lucy demurely, "is conducted on the strictest\r\nprinciples. We always let a gentleman know when he has had as much as is\r\ngood for him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say!" Fred appeared to be completely bowled over by what he would\r\nhave denominated as this "side-splitter," and gave vent to an unearthly\r\nhowl of merriment.\r\n\r\n"Whatever is the matter?" cried his sister, entering the sitting-room.\r\nShe and Gertrude had just come up together from the studio, where Conny\r\nhad been pouring out her soul as to the hollowness of the world, a fact\r\nshe was in the habit periodically of discovering. "Fred, what a shocking\r\nnoise!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up, Con, and let a fellow alone," grumbled Fred, subsiding\r\ninto a chair. "Conny\'s been dancing every night this week--making me\r\ntake her, too, by Jove!--and now, if you please, she\'s got hot\r\ncoppers."\r\n\r\nMiss Devonshire deigned no reply to these remarks, and Phyllis, who,\r\nlike all of them, was accustomed to occasional sparring between the\r\nbrother and sister, threw herself into the breach.\r\n\r\n"You\'re the very creature I want, Conny," she cried. "Come over here;\r\nperhaps you can enlighten me about the person who interests me more than\r\nany one in the world."\r\n\r\n"Phyllis!" protested Fan, who understood the allusion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s your man opposite," went on Phyllis, unabashed; "Lucy and I are\r\nlonging to know all about him. There he is on the doorstep; why, he only\r\nwent out half an hour ago!"\r\n\r\n"That fellow," said Fred, with unutterable contempt; "that\r\nforeign-looking chap whom Conny dances half the night with?"\r\n\r\n"Foreign-looking," said Phyllis, "I should just think he was! Why, he\r\nmight have stepped straight out of a Venetian portrait; a Tintoretto, a\r\nBordone, any one of those _mellow_ people."\r\n\r\n"Only as regards colouring," put in Lucy, whose interest in the subject\r\nappeared to be comparatively mild. "I don\'t believe those old Venetian\r\nnobles dashed about in that headlong fashion. I often wonder what his\r\nbusiness can be that keeps him running in and out all day."\r\n\r\nFortunately for Constance, the fading light of the December afternoon\r\nconcealed the fact that she was blushing furiously, as she replied\r\ncoolly enough, "Oh, Frank Jermyn? he\'s an artist; works chiefly in black\r\nand white for the illustrated papers, I think. He and another man have a\r\nstudio in York Place together."\r\n\r\n"Is he an Englishman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; his people are Cornish clergymen."\r\n\r\n"All of them? \'What, all his pretty ones?\'" cried Phyllis; "but you are\r\nvery interesting, Conny, to-day. Poor fellow, he looks a little lonely\r\nsometimes; although he has a great many oddly-assorted pals."\r\n\r\n"By the bye," went on Conny, still maintaining her severely neutral\r\ntone, "he mentioned the photographic studio, and wanted to know all\r\nabout \'G. and L. Lorimer.\'"\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him," answered Phyllis, "that if you lived opposite four\r\nbeautiful, fallen princesses, who kept a photographer\'s shop, you would\r\nat least call and be photographed."\r\n\r\n"It is so much nicer of him that he does not," said Lucy, with decision.\r\n\r\nPhyllis struck an attitude:\r\n\r\n\r\n     "It might have been, once only,\r\n     We lodged in a street together ..."\r\n\r\n\r\nshe began, then stopped short suddenly.\r\n\r\n"What a thundering row!" said Fred.\r\n\r\nA curious, scuffling sound, coming from the room below, was distinctly\r\naudible.\r\n\r\n"Mdlle. St\xe9phanie appears to be giving an afternoon dance," said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"I will go and see if anything is the matter," remarked Gertrude,\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact she snatched eagerly at this opportunity for\r\nseparating herself from this group of idle chatterers. She was tired,\r\ndispirited, beset with a hundred anxieties; weighed down by a cruel\r\nsense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nHow was it all to end? she asked herself, as, oblivious of Mdlle.\r\nSt\xe9phanie\'s performance, she lingered on the little dusky landing. That\r\nfirst wave of business, born of the good-natured impulse of their\r\nfriends and acquaintance, had spent itself, and matters were looking\r\nvery serious indeed for the firm of G. and L. Lorimer.\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t go on taking Fred\'s guineas for ever," she thought, a\r\nstrange laugh rising in her throat. "Perhaps, though, it was wrong of me\r\nto refuse to be interviewed by _The Waterloo Place Gazette_. But we are\r\nphotographers, not mountebanks!" she added, in self-justification.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she had succeeded in suppressing all outward marks of\r\nher troubles, and had rejoined the people in the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Maryon says there is nothing the matter," she cried, with her\r\ndelightful smile, "and that there is no accounting for these\r\nforeigners."\r\n\r\nLaughter greeted her words, then Conny, rising and shaking out her\r\nsplendid skirts, declared that it was time to go.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you ever coming to see us?" she said, giving Gertrude a great\r\nhug. "Mama is positively offended, and as for papa--disconsolate is not\r\nthe word."\r\n\r\n"You must make them understand how really difficult it is for any of us\r\nto come," answered Gertrude, who had a natural dislike to entering on\r\nexplanations in which such sordid matters as shabby clothes and the\r\ncomparative dearness of railway tickets would have had to figure\r\nlargely. "But we are coming one day, of course."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is," cried Fred, as they emerged into the street,\r\nand stood looking round for a hansom; "Gertrude may be the cleverest,\r\nand Phyllis the prettiest, but Lucy is far and away the nicest of the\r\nLorimer girls."\r\n\r\n"Gerty is worth ten of her, _I_ think," answered Conny, crossly. She was\r\nabsorbed in furtive contemplation of a light that glimmered in a window\r\nabove the auctioneer\'s shop opposite.\r\n\r\nAs the girls were sitting at supper, later on, they were startled by the\r\nrenewal of those sounds below which had disturbed them in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThey waited a few minutes, attentive; but this time, instead of dying\r\naway, the noise rapidly gathered volume, and in addition to the\r\nscuffling, their ears were assailed by the sound of shrill cries, and\r\nwhat appeared to be a perfect volley of objurgations. Evidently a\r\ncontest was going on in which other weapons than vocal or verbal ones\r\nwere employed, for the floor and windows of the little sitting-room\r\nshook and rattled in a most alarming manner.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, to the general horror, Fanny burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Girls," she cried, rushing wildly to the window, "you may say what you\r\nlike; but I am not going to stay and see us all murdered without lifting\r\na hand. Help! Murder!" she shrieked, leaning half her body over the\r\nwindow-sill.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, Fanny, stop that!" cried Lucy, in dismay, trying to\r\ndraw her back into the room. But her protest was drowned by a series of\r\near-piercing yells issuing from the room below.\r\n\r\n"I will go and see what is the matter," said Gertrude, pale herself to\r\nthe lips; for the whole thing was sufficiently blood-curdling.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better stay where you are," answered Lucy, in her most\r\nmatter-of-fact tones, as she led the terrified Fan to an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nPhyllis stood among them silent, gazing from one to the other, with that\r\nstrange, bright look in her eyes, which with her betokened excitement;\r\nthe unimpassioned, impersonal excitement of a spectator at a thrilling\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I shall go," said Gertrude, as a door banged violently\r\nbelow, to the accompaniment of a volley of polyglot curses.\r\n\r\n"I will not stay in this awful house another hour," panted Fanny, from\r\nher arm-chair. "Gertrude, Gertrude, if you leave this room I shall die!"\r\n\r\nWith a sickening of the heart, for she knew not what horror she was\r\nabout to encounter, Gertrude made her way downstairs, the cries and\r\nsounds of struggling growing louder at each step. At the bottom of the\r\nfirst flight she paused.\r\n\r\n"Go back, Phyllis."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good, Gerty, I\'m not going back."\r\n\r\n"I am going to the shop; and if the Maryons are not there we must call a\r\npoliceman."\r\n\r\nSwiftly they went down the next flight, past the horrible doors, on the\r\nother side of which the battle was raging, still downwards, till they\r\nreached the little narrow hall. Here they drew up suddenly before a\r\nfigure which barred the way.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards Gertrude could recall the moment when she first saw\r\nFrank Jermyn under their roof; could remember distinctly--though all at\r\nthe time seemed chaos--the sudden sensation of security that came over\r\nher at the sight of the kind, eager young face, the brilliant, steadfast\r\neyes; at the sound of the manly, cheery voice.\r\n\r\nThere were no explanations; no apologies.\r\n\r\n"There seems to be a shocking row going on," he said, lifting his hat;\r\n"I only hope that it does not concern any of you ladies."\r\n\r\nIn a few hurried words Gertrude told him what she knew of the state of\r\naffairs. Meanwhile the noise had in some degree subsided.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens!" cried Frank; "there may be murder going on at this\r\ninstant." And in less time than it takes to tell he had sprung past her,\r\nand was hammering with all his might at the closed door.\r\n\r\nThe girls followed timidly, and were in time to see the door fly open in\r\nresponse to the well-directed blows, and Mrs. Maryon herself come\r\nforward, pale but calm. Within the room all was now dark and silent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon and the new comer exchanged a few hurried words, and the\r\nlatter turned to the girls, who clung together a few paces off.\r\n\r\n"There is no cause for alarm," he said. "Pray do not wait here. I will\r\nexplain everything in a few minutes, if I may."\r\n\r\n"Now please, Miss Lorimer, go back upstairs; there\'s nothing to be\r\nfrightened at," chimed in Mrs. Maryon, with some asperity.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Frank Jermyn knocked at the door of the\r\nLorimers\' sitting-room, and on being admitted, found himself well within\r\nthe fire of four questioning pairs of feminine eyes.\r\n\r\n"Pray sit down, sir," said Fan, who had been prepared for his arrival.\r\n"How are we ever to thank you?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to thank me for, as your sisters can tell you," he\r\nsaid, bluntly. He looked a modest, pleasant little person enough as he\r\nsat there in his light overcoat and dress clothes, all the fierceness\r\ngone out of him. "I have merely come to tell you that nothing terrible\r\nhas happened. It seems that the poor Frenchwoman below has been in money\r\ndifficulties, and has been trying to put an end to herself. The Maryons\r\ndiscovered this in time, and it has been as much as they could do to\r\nprevent her from carrying out her plan. Hence these tears," he added,\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nWhen once you had seen Frank Jermyn smile, you believed in him from\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\nThe girls were full of horror and pity at the tale.\r\n\r\n"We have had a great shock," said Fan, wiping her eyes, with dignity.\r\n"Such a terrible noise. But you heard it for yourself."\r\n\r\nA pause; the young fellow looked round rather wistfully, as though\r\ndoubtful of what footing he stood on among them.\r\n\r\n"We must not keep you," went on Fan, whose tongue was loosened by\r\nexcitement; "no doubt (glancing at his clothes) you are going out to\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nShe spoke in the manner of a fallen queen who alludes to the ceremony of\r\ncoronation.\r\n\r\nFrank rose.\r\n\r\n"By the by," he said, looking down, "I have often wished--I have never\r\nventured"--then looking up and smiling brightly, "I have often wondered\r\nif you included photographing at artists\' studios in your work."\r\n\r\nLucy assured him that they did, and the young man asked permission to\r\ncall on them the next day at the studio. Then he added--\r\n\r\n"My name is Jermyn, and I live at Number 19, opposite."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Lucy, in the candid, friendly fashion which always set\r\npeople at their ease, "that we have an acquaintance in common, Miss\r\nDevonshire."\r\n\r\nJermyn acknowledged that such was the case; a few remarks on the subject\r\nwere exchanged, then Frank went off to his dinner-party, having first\r\nshaken hands with each of the girls in all cordiality and frankness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon came up in the course of the evening, to express her regret\r\nthat the ladies had been frightened and disturbed; setting aside with\r\ncynical good-humour their anxious expressions of pity and sympathy for\r\nthe heroine of the affair.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t for such as you to trouble yourselves about such as her," she\r\nsaid, "although I\'m sorry enough for Steffany myself--and never a penny\r\nof last quarter\'s rent paid!"\r\n\r\n"Poor woman," answered Lucy, "she must have been in a desperate\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"You see, miss," said Mrs. Maryon circumstantially, "she had been going\r\non owing money for ever so long, though _we_ knew nothing about it; and\r\nat last she was threatened with the bailiffs. Then what must she do but\r\ngo down to the shop and make off with some of Maryon\'s bottles while we\r\nwere at dinner. He found it out, and took one away from her this\r\nafternoon when you complained of the noise. Later he missed the second\r\nbottle, and went up to Steffany, who was uncorking it and sniffing it,\r\nand making believe she wanted to do away with herself."\r\n\r\n"How unutterably horrible!" Gertrude shuddered.\r\n\r\n"You heard how she went on when he tried to take it from her. Such\r\nstrength as she has, too--it was as much as me and Maryon and the girl\r\ncould do between us to hold her down."\r\n\r\n"Where has she gone to now?" said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she don\'t sleep here, you know, miss. She\'s gone home with Maryon\r\nas meek as a lamb; took her bit of supper with us, quite cheerfully."\r\n\r\n"What will she do, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Mrs. Maryon, thoughtfully; "there\'s no saying what she and\r\nmany other poor creatures like her have to do. There\'d be no rest for\r\nany of us if we was to think of that."\r\n\r\nGertrude lay awake that night for many hours; the events of the day had\r\ncuriously shaken her. The story of the miserable Frenchwoman, with its\r\nelement of grim humour, made her sick at heart.\r\n\r\nFenced in as she had hitherto been from the grosser realities of life,\r\nshe was only beginning to realise the meaning of life. Only a plank--a\r\nplank between them and the pitiless, fathomless ocean on which they had\r\nset out with such unknowing fearlessness; into whose boiling depths\r\nhundreds sank daily and disappeared, never to rise again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMademoiselle St\xe9phanie actually put in an appearance the next morning,\r\nand made quite a cheerful bustle over the business of setting her house\r\nin order, preparatory to the final flitting.\r\n\r\nGertrude passed her on the stairs on her way to the studio, but feigned\r\nnot to notice the other\'s morning greeting, delivered with its usual\r\ncrispness. The woman\'s mincing, sallow face, with its unabashed smiles,\r\nsickened her.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, who was with her, laughed softly. "She does not seem in the\r\nleast put out by the little affair of yesterday," she said.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Phyllis. Ah, there is the studio bell already. No doubt it is Mr.\r\nJermyn," and she unconsciously assumed her most business-like air.\r\n\r\nA day or two later Mademoiselle St\xe9phanie vanished for ever; and not\r\nlong afterwards her place was occupied by a serious-looking\r\numbrella-maker, who displayed no hankering for Mr. Maryon\'s bottles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA NEW CUSTOMER.\r\n\r\n     _Stately is service accepted, but lovelier service rendered,\r\n     Interchange of service the law and condition of Beauty._\r\n                                                    A. H. CLOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Jermyn, whom we have left ringing at the bell, followed Gertrude\r\ndown the Virginia-cork passage into the waiting-room.\r\n\r\nThe curtains between this apartment and the studio were drawn aside,\r\ndisplaying a charming picture--Lucy, in her black gown and holland\r\npinafore, her fair, smooth head bent over the re-touching frame;\r\nPhyllis, at an ornamental table, engaged in trimming prints, with great\r\ndeftness and grace of manipulation.\r\n\r\nNeither of the girls looked up from her work, and Frank took possession\r\nof one of the red-legged chairs, duly impressed with the business-like\r\nnature of the occasion; although, indeed, it must be confessed that his\r\nglance strayed furtively now and then in the direction of the studio and\r\nits pleasant prospect.\r\n\r\nGertrude explained that they were quite prepared to undertake studio\r\nwork. Frank briefly stated the precise nature of the work he had ready\r\nfor them, and then ensued a pause.\r\n\r\nIt was humiliating, it was ridiculous, but it was none the less true,\r\nthat neither of these business-like young people liked first to make a\r\ndefinite suggestion for the inevitable visit to Frank\'s studio.\r\n\r\nAt last Gertrude said, "You would wish it done to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please; if it be possible."\r\n\r\nShe reflected a moment. "It must be this morning. There is no relying on\r\nthe afternoon light. I cannot arrange to go myself, but my sister can, I\r\nthink. Lucy!"\r\n\r\nLucy came across to them, alert and serene.\r\n\r\n"Lucy, would you take number three camera to Mr. Jermyn\'s studio in\r\nYork Place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly."\r\n\r\n"I have some studies of drapery I should wish to be photographed," added\r\nFrank, with his air of steadfast modesty.\r\n\r\n"I will come at once, if you like," answered Lucy, calmly.\r\n\r\n"You will, of course, allow me to carry the apparatus, Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Lucy, after the least possible hesitation.\r\n\r\nEvery one was immensely serious; and a few minutes afterwards Mrs.\r\nMaryon, looking out from the dressmaker\'s window, saw a solemn young man\r\nand a sober young woman emerge together from the house, laden with\r\ntripod-stand and camera, and a box of slides, respectively.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have gone myself," said Gertrude, in a worried tone;\r\n"but I promised Mrs. Staines to be in for her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he _is_ a nice young man," answered Phyllis, unblushingly, looking\r\nup from her prints.\r\n\r\n"Oh Phyllis, Phyllis, don\'t talk like a housemaid."\r\n\r\n"I say, Gerty, all this is delightfully unchaperoned, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Phyllis, how can you?" cried Gertrude, vexed.\r\n\r\nThe question of propriety was one which she always thought best left to\r\nitself, which she hated, above all things, to discuss. Yet even her own\r\nunconventional sense of fitness was a little shocked at seeing her\r\nsister walk out of the house with an unknown young man, both of them\r\nbeing bound for the studio of the latter.\r\n\r\nShe was quite relieved when, an hour later, Lucy appeared in the\r\nwaiting-room, fresh and radiant from her little walk.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Staines has been and gone," said Gertrude. "She worried\r\ndreadfully. But what have you done with \'number three?\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I left the camera at York Place. I am going again to-morrow to do\r\nsome work for Mr. Oakley, who shares Mr. Jermyn\'s studio."\r\n\r\n"Grist for our mill with a vengeance. But come here and talk seriously,\r\nLucy."\r\n\r\nPhyllis, be it observed, who never remained long in the workshop, had\r\ngone out for a walk with Fan.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Lucy, balancing herself against a five-barred gate, Fred\r\nDevonshire\'s latest gift, aptly christened by Phyllis the White\r\nElephant. "Well, Miss Lorimer?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to say something unpleasant. Do you realise that this latest\r\ndevelopment of our business is likely to excite remark?"\r\n\r\n"\'That people will talk,\' as Fan says? Oh, yes, I realise that."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look so contemptuous, Lucy. It is unconventional, you know."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is; and so are we. It is a little late in the day to\r\nquarrel with our bread-and-butter on that ground."\r\n\r\n"It is a mere matter of convention, is it not?" cried Gertrude, more\r\nanxious to persuade herself than her sister. "Whether a man walks into\r\nyour studio and introduces himself, or whether your hostess introduces\r\nhim at a party, it comes to much the same thing. In both cases you must\r\nuse your judgment about him."\r\n\r\n"And whether he walks down the street with you, or puts his arm round\r\nyour waist, and waltzes off with you to some distant conservatory, makes\r\nvery little difference. In either case the chances are one knows nothing\r\nabout him. I am sure half the men one met at dances might have been\r\nhaberdashers or professional thieves for all their hostesses knew. And,\r\nas a matter of fact, we happen to know something about Mr. Jermyn."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have nothing to say against Mr. Jermyn, personally. I am sure he\r\nis nice. It was rather that my vivid imagination saw vistas of\r\nstudio-work looming in the distance. It was quite different with Mr.\r\nLawrence, you know," said Gertrude, whom her own arguments struck as\r\nplausible rather than sound. "One thing may lead to another."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is sure to," cried Lucy, who saw an opportunity for escaping\r\nfrom the detested propriety topic. "To-day, for instance, with Mr.\r\nOakley. He is middle-aged, by the bye, Gerty, and married, for I saw his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed; they could, indeed, afford to laugh, for, regarded\r\nfrom a financial point of view, the morning had been an unusually\r\nsatisfactory one.\r\n\r\nGertrude\'s prophetic vision of vistas of studio work proved, for the\r\nnext few days at least, to have been no baseless fabric of the fancy.\r\nThe two artists at York Place kept them so busy over models, sketches,\r\nand arrangements of drapery, that the girls\' hands were full from\r\nmorning till night. Of course this did not last, but Frank was so full\r\nof suggestions for them, so genuinely struck with the quality of their\r\nwork, so anxious to recommend them to his comrades in art, that their\r\nspirits rose high, and hope, which for a time had almost failed them,\r\narose, like a giant refreshed, in their breasts.\r\n\r\nIn all simplicity and respect, the young Cornishman took a deep and\r\nunconcealed interest in the photographic firm, and expected, on his\r\npart, a certain amount of interest to be taken in his own work.\r\n\r\nFrank, as Conny had said, worked chiefly in black and white. He was\r\nengaged, at present, in illustrating a serial story for _The Woodcut_,\r\nbut he had time on his hands for a great deal more work, time which he\r\nemployed in painting pictures which the public refused to buy, although\r\nthe committees were often willing to exhibit them.\r\n\r\n"If they would only send me out to that wretched little war," he said.\r\n"There is nothing like having been a special artist for getting a man on\r\nwith the pictorial editors."\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like the salt of healthy objective interests for\r\nkeeping the moral nature sound. Before the sense of mutual honesty, the\r\nlittle barriers of prudishness which both sides had thought fit in the\r\nfirst instance to raise, fell silently between the young people, never\r\nagain to be lifted up.\r\n\r\nFor good or evil, these waifs on the great stream of London life had\r\ndrifted together; how long the current should continue thus to bear them\r\nside by side--how long, indeed, they should float on the surface of the\r\nstream at all, was a question with which, for the time being, they did\r\nnot very much trouble themselves.\r\n\r\nNo one quite knew how it came about, but before a month had gone by, it\r\nbecame the most natural thing in the world for Frank to drop in upon\r\nthem at unexpected hours, to share their simple meals, to ask and give\r\nadvice about their respective work.\r\n\r\nFanny had accepted the situation with astonishing calmness. Prudish to\r\nthe verge of insanity with regard to herself, she had grown to look upon\r\nher strong-minded sisters as creatures emancipated from the ordinary\r\nconventions of their sex, as far removed from the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of gallantry as the withered hag who swept the crossing\r\nnear Baker Street Station.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, she found life at this period a little dull, and welcomed,\r\non her own account, a new and pleasant social element in the person of\r\nFrank Jermyn; however it may be, Fanny gave no trouble, and Gertrude\'s\r\nlurking scruples slept in peace.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning towards the end of January, Gertrude came careering\r\nup the street on the summit of a tall, green omnibus, her hair blowing\r\ngaily in the breeze, her ill-gloved hands clasped about a bulky\r\nnote-book. Frank, passing by in painting-coat and sombrero, plucked the\r\nlatter from his head and waved it in exaggerated salute, an action which\r\nevoked a responsive smile from the person for whom it was intended, but\r\nacted with quite a different effect on another person who chanced to\r\nwitness it, and for whom it was certainly not intended. This was no\r\nother than Aunt Caroline Pratt, who, to Gertrude\'s dismay, came dashing\r\npast in an open carriage, a look of speechless horror on her handsome,\r\nhorselike countenance.\r\n\r\nNow it is impossible to be dignified on the top of an omnibus, and\r\nGertrude received her aunt\'s frozen stare of non-recognition with a\r\nhumiliating consciousness of the disadvantages of her own position.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart she crept down from her elevation, when the omnibus\r\nstopped at the corner, and walked in a crestfallen manner to Number 20B,\r\nbefore the door of which the carriage, emptied of its freight, was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline did not trouble them much in these days, and rather\r\nwondering what had brought her, Gertrude made her way to the\r\nsitting-room, where the visitor was already established.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Aunt Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Gertrude? And where have you been this morning?"\r\n\r\n"To the British Museum."\r\n\r\nGertrude felt all the old opposition rising within her, in the jarring\r\npresence; an opposition which she assured herself was unreasonable. What\r\ndid it matter what Aunt Caroline said, at this time of day? It had been\r\ndifferent when they had been little girls; different, too, in that first\r\nmoment of sorrow and anxiety, when she had laid her coarse touch on\r\ntheir quivering sensibilities.\r\n\r\nYet, when all was said, Mrs. Pratt\'s was not a presence to be in any way\r\npassed over.\r\n\r\n"It is half-past one," said Aunt Caroline, consulting her watch; "are\r\nyou not going to have your luncheon?"\r\n\r\n"It is laid in the kitchen," explained Lucy; "but if you will stay we\r\ncan have it in here."\r\n\r\n"In the kitchen! Is it necessary to give up the habits of ladies because\r\nyou are poor?"\r\n\r\n"A kitchen without a cook," put in Phyllis, "is the most ladylike place\r\nin the world."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pratt vouchsafed no answer to this exclamation, but turned to Lucy.\r\n\r\n"No luncheon, thank you. I may as well say at once that I have come here\r\nwith a purpose; solely, in fact, from motives of duty. Gertrude, perhaps\r\nyour conscience can tell you what brings me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Aunt Caroline, I am at a loss----"\r\n\r\n"I have come," continued Mrs. Pratt, "prepared to put up with anything\r\nyou may say. Gertrude, it is to you I address myself, although, from\r\nFanny\'s age, she is the one to have prevented this scandal."\r\n\r\n"I do not in the least understand you," said Gertrude, with\r\nself-restraint.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pratt elevated her gloved forefinger, with the air of a\r\nwell-seasoned counsel.\r\n\r\n"Is it, or is it not true, that you have scraped acquaintance with a\r\nyoung man who lodges opposite you; that he is in and out of your rooms\r\nat all hours; that you follow him about to his studio?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gertrude, slowly, flushing deeply, "if you choose to put it\r\nthat way; it is true."\r\n\r\n"That you go about to public places with him," continued Aunt Caroline;\r\n"that you have been seen, two of you and this person, in the upper boxes\r\nof a theatre?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is true," answered Gertrude; and Lucy, mindful of a coming\r\nstorm, would have taken up the word, but Gertrude interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Let me speak, Lucy; perhaps, after all, we do owe Aunt Caroline some\r\nexplanation. Aunt, how shall I say it for you to understand? We have\r\ntaken life up from a different standpoint, begun it on different bases.\r\nWe are poor people, and we are learning to find out the pleasures of\r\nthe poor, to approach happiness from another side. We have none of the\r\nconventional social opportunities for instance, but are we therefore to\r\nsacrifice all social enjoyment? You say we \'follow Mr. Jermyn to his\r\nstudio;\' we have our living to earn, no less than our lives to live, and\r\nin neither case can we afford to be the slaves of custom. Our friends\r\nmust trust us or leave us; must rely on our self-respect and our\r\njudgment. Convention apart, are not judgment and self-respect what we\r\nmost of us do rely on in our relations with people, under any\r\ncircumstances whatever?"\r\n\r\nIt was only the fact that Aunt Caroline was speechless with rage that\r\nprevented her from breaking in at an earlier stage on poor Gertrude\'s\r\nheroics; but at this point she found her voice. Sitting very still, and\r\nlooking hard at her niece with a remarkably unpleasant expression in her\r\ncold eye, she said in tones of concentrated fury:\r\n\r\n"Fanny is a fool, and the others are children; but don\'t _you_,\r\nGertrude, know what is meant by a lost reputation?"\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Gertrude; she sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Caroline," she cried, "you are right; Lucy and Phyllis are very\r\nyoung. It is not fit that they should hear such conversation. If you\r\nwish to continue it, I will ask them to go away."\r\n\r\nA pause; the two combatants standing pale and breathless, facing one\r\nanother. Then Lucy went over to her sister and took her hand; Fanny\r\nsobbed; Phyllis glanced from one to the other with her bright eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, Gertrude\'s conduct had been distinctly injudicious; open defiance,\r\nno less than servile acquiescence, was understood and appreciated by\r\nMrs. Pratt; but Gertrude, as Lucy, who secretly admired her sister\'s\r\neloquence, at once perceived, had spoken a tongue not understanded of\r\nAunt Caroline.\r\n\r\nAs soon, in these non-miraculous days, strike the rock for water, as\r\nappeal to Aunt Caroline\'s finer feelings or imaginative perceptions.\r\n\r\n"If you will not listen to me," she said, suddenly assuming an air of\r\nweariness and physical delicacy, "it must be seen whether your uncle can\r\ninfluence you. I am not equal to prolonging the discussion."\r\n\r\nPointedly ignoring Gertrude, she shook hands with the other girls;\r\nangry as she was, their shabby clothes and shabby furniture smote her\r\nfor the moment with compassion. Poverty seemed to her the greatest of\r\nhuman calamities; she pitied even more than she despised it.\r\n\r\nTo Lucy, indeed, who escorted her downstairs, she assumed quite a gay\r\nand benevolent manner; only pausing to ask on the threshold, with a good\r\ndeal of fine, healthy curiosity underlying the elaborate archness of her\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n"Now, how much money have you naughty girls been making lately?"\r\n\r\nLucy stoutly and laughingly evaded the question, and Aunt Caroline drove\r\noff smiling, refusing, like the stalwart warrior that she was, to\r\nacknowledge herself defeated. But it was many a long day before she\r\nattempted again to interfere in the affairs of the Lorimers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she would have been more ready to renew the attack, had she\r\nknown how really distressed and disturbed Gertrude had been by her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA DISTINGUISHED PERSON.\r\n\r\n     "... _I can give no reason, nor I will not;\r\n     More than have a lodged hate and a certain loathing\r\n     I bear Antonio._"\r\n                                     MERCHANT OF VENICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, towards the middle of March, the sisters were much excited\r\nat receiving a letter containing an order to photograph a picture in a\r\nstudio at St. John\'s Wood.\r\n\r\nIt was written in a small legible handwriting, was dated from The\r\nSycamores, and signed, Sidney Darrell.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how he came to hear of us?" said Lucy, who cherished a\r\nparticular admiration for the works of this artist.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Mr. Jermyn knows him," answered Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"He would probably have spoken of him to us, if he did."\r\n\r\n"Here," said Gertrude, "is Mr. Jermyn to answer for himself."\r\n\r\nFrank, who had been admitted by Matilda, came into the waiting-room,\r\nwhere the sisters stood, a look as of the dawning spring-time in his\r\nvivid face and shining eyes.\r\n\r\n"I have brought the proofs from _The Woodcut_," he said, drawing a damp\r\nbundle from his painting-coat. The Lorimers always read the slips of the\r\nstory he was illustrating, and then a general council was held to decide\r\non the best incident for illustration.\r\n\r\nLucy took the bundle and handed him the letter.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you tremendously pleased?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything about this?" asked Lucy.\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, did you recommend us to him?"\r\n\r\n"Not I. This letter is simply the reward of well-earned fame."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mr. Jermyn; I really think you must be right. Do you know\r\nSidney Darrell?"\r\n\r\n"I have met him. But he is a great swell, you know, Miss Lucy, and he is\r\nalmost always abroad."\r\n\r\n"Yes," put in Gertrude; "his exquisite Venetian pictures!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Darrell is a clever fellow. Too fond of the French school, perhaps,\r\nfor my taste. And the curious thing is, that, though his work is every\r\nbit as solid as it is brilliant, there is something rather sensational\r\nabout his reputation."\r\n\r\n"All this," cried Gertrude, "sounds exciting."\r\n\r\n"I think that must be owing to the man himself," went on Frank. "Oakley\r\nknows him fairly well; says you may meet him one night at dinner, and he\r\nwill ask you up to his studio. The first thing next morning you get a\r\nnote putting you off; he is very sorry, but he is starting that day for\r\nIndia."\r\n\r\n"Does he paint Indian pictures?"\r\n\r\n"No, but is bitten at times with the \'big game\' craze; shoots tigers and\r\nsticks pigs, and so on. I believe his studio is quite a museum of\r\ntrophies of the chase."\r\n\r\n"By the by, Lucy, which of us is to go to The Sycamores to-morrow\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\n"You must go, Gerty; I can\'t trust any one else to finish off those\r\nprints of little Jack Oakley, and they have been promised so long."\r\n\r\nGertrude consulted the letter.\r\n\r\n"I shall have to take the big camera, which involves a cab."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have walked up with you," said Frank; "but, strange to\r\nsay, I am very busy this week."\r\n\r\n"I wish we were busy," answered Gertrude; "things are a little better,\r\nbut it is slow work."\r\n\r\n"I consider this letter of Darrell\'s a distinct move forward," cried\r\nhopeful Frank; "_he_ will be able to recommend you to artists who are\r\nnot a lot of out-at-elbow fellows," he added, holding out his hand in\r\nfarewell, with a bright smile that belied the rueful words. "Now, please\r\ndon\'t forget you are all coming to tea with Oakley and me on Sunday\r\nafternoon. And Miss Devonshire--you gave her my invitation?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucy, promptly; then added after a pause: "May her brother\r\ncome too; he says he would like to?"\r\n\r\nFrank scanned her quickly with his bright eyes.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if you like; he is not a bad sort of cub."\r\n\r\nAnd then he departed abruptly.\r\n\r\n"That was quite rude, for Mr. Jermyn," said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nLucy turned away with a slight flush on her fair face.\r\n\r\n"It would be quite rude for anybody," she said, and went over to the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nPhyllis was spending the day at the Devonshires, but came back for the\r\nevening meal, by which time her sisters\' excitement on the subject of\r\nDarrell\'s letter had subsided; and no mention was made of it while they\r\nwere at table.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, Phyllis went over to the window, drew up the blind, and\r\namused herself, as was her frequent custom, by looking into the street.\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t do that," said Lucy; "any one can see right into\r\nthe room."\r\n\r\n"Why do you waste your breath, Lucy? You know it is never any good\r\ntelling me not to do things, when I want to."\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had herself a secret, childish love for the gas-lit\r\nstreet, for the sight of the hurrying people, the lamps, the hansom\r\ncabs, flickering in and out the yellow haze, like so many fire-flies,\r\ntook no part in the dispute, but set to work at repairing an old skirt\r\nof Phyllis\'s, which was sadly torn.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the spoilt child at the window continued her observations,\r\nwhich seemed to afford her considerable amusement.\r\n\r\n"There is a light in Frank Jermyn\'s window--the top one," she cried; "I\r\nsuppose he is dressing. He told me he had an early dance in Harley\r\nStreet. I wish _I_ were going to a dance."\r\n\r\nThere was a look of mischief in Phyllis\'s eyes as she looked round at\r\nLucy, who was buried in the proof-sheets from _The Woodcut_.\r\n\r\n"Phyllis, you are coughing terribly. Do come away from that draughty\r\nplace," cried Gertrude, with real anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m all right, Gerty. Ah, there goes Master Frank. It is wet\r\nunderfoot, and he has turned up his trousers, and his pumps are bulging\r\nfrom his coat-pocket. I wonder how many miles a week he walks on his way\r\nto dances?"\r\n\r\n"It is quite delightful to see a person with such an enjoyment of every\r\nphase of existence," said Gertrude, half to herself.\r\n\r\n"You poor, dear _blas\xe9e_ thing. It _is_ a pretty sight to see the young\r\npeople enjoying themselves, as the little boy said in _Punch_, is it\r\nnot? I wonder if Mr. Jermyn is going to walk all the way? Perhaps he\r\nwill take the omnibus at the corner. He never \'soars higher than a\r\n\'bus,\' as he expresses it."\r\n\r\nWearying suddenly of the sport, Phyllis dropped the blind, and, coming\r\nover to Gertrude, knelt on the floor at her feet.\r\n\r\n"It is a little dull, ain\'t it, Gerty, to look at life from a top-floor\r\nwindow?"\r\n\r\nA curious pang went through Gertrude, as she tenderly stroked the\r\nnut-brown head.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t heard our news," she said, irrelevantly. "There, read\r\nthat." And taking Mr. Darrell\'s note from her pocket, she handed it to\r\nPhyllis.\r\n\r\nThe latter read it through rather languidly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose it is a good thing to be employed by such a person," she\r\nremarked. "Sidney Darrell?--Didn\'t I tell you I met him last week at\r\nthe Oakleys, the day I went to tea?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sycamores was divided from the road by a high grey wall, beyond\r\nwhich stretched a neglected-looking garden of some size, and, on the\r\nMarch morning of which I write, this latter presented a singularly\r\nmelancholy appearance.\r\n\r\nThe house itself looked melancholy also, as houses will which are very\r\nlittle lived in, and appeared to consist almost entirely of a large\r\nstudio, built out like a disproportionate wing from the main structure.\r\n\r\nGertrude was led at once to the studio by a serious-looking manservant,\r\nwho announced that his master would join her in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe apartment in which Gertrude found herself was of vast size, and bore\r\nnone of the signs of neglect and disuse which marked the house and\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nIt was fitted up with all the chaotic splendour which distinguishes the\r\nstudio of the modern fashionable artist; the spoils of many climes,\r\nfruits of many wanderings, being heaped, with more regard to\r\npicturesqueness than fitness, in every available nook.\r\n\r\nGoing up to the carved fire-place, Gertrude proceeded to warm her hands\r\nat the comfortable wood-fire, a position badly adapted for taking stock\r\nof the great man\'s possessions, of which, as she afterwards confessed,\r\nshe only carried away a prevailing impression of tiger-skins and\r\nVenetian lanterns.\r\n\r\nThe fire-light played about her slim figure and about the faded richness\r\nof a big screen of old Spanish leather, which fenced in the little bit\r\nof territory in the immediate neighbourhood of the fire-place; a spot in\r\nwhich had been gathered the most luxurious lounges and the choicest\r\nornaments of the whole collection; and where, at the present moment, the\r\nair was heavy with the scent of tuberose, several sprays of which stood\r\non a small table in a costly jar of Venetian glass.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the sound of footsteps outside, and of the rich, deep\r\nnotes of a man\'s voice were audible.\r\n\r\n\r\n     "Et non, non, non,\r\n     Vous n\'\xeates plus Lisette,\r\n     Ne portez plus ce nom."\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the footsteps drew nearer the words of the song could be clearly\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nGertrude turned towards the door, which fronted the fire-place, and as\r\nshe did so the song ceased, the curtain was pushed aside, and a person,\r\npresumably the singer, came into the room.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of middle height, and middle age, with light brown hair,\r\nparted in the centre, and a moustache and Vandyke beard of the same\r\ncolour. He was not, strictly speaking, handsome, but he wore that air of\r\ndistinction which power and the assurance of power alone can confer. His\r\nwhole appearance was a masterly combination of the correct and the\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nHe advanced deliberately towards Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Allow me, Miss Lorimer, to introduce myself."\r\n\r\nHe spoke carelessly, yet with a note of disappointment in his voice, and\r\na shade of moodiness in his heavy-lidded eyes.\r\n\r\nGertrude, looking up and meeting the cold, grey glance, became suddenly\r\nconscious that her hat was shabby, that her boots were patched and\r\nclumsy, that the wind had blown the wisps of hair about her face. What\r\nwas there in this man\'s gaze that made her, all at once, feel old and\r\nawkward, ridiculous and dowdy; that made her long to snatch up her heavy\r\ncamera and flee from his presence, never to return?\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed? Gertrude, we know, had a vivid imagination, and that\r\nperhaps was responsible for the sense of oppression, defiance, and\r\nself-distrust with which she followed Mr. Darrell across the room to one\r\nof the easels, on which was displayed a remarkable study in oils of a\r\nwinter aspect of the Grand Canal at Venice.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly, superficially speaking, no ground for her feeling\r\nin the artist\'s conduct. With his own hands he set up and fixed the\r\nheavy camera on the tripod stand, questioned her, in his low, listless\r\ntones, as to her convenience, and observed, by way of polite\r\nconversation, that he had had the pleasure of meeting her sister the\r\nweek before at the Oakleys.\r\n\r\nTo her own unutterable vexation, Gertrude found herself rather cowed by\r\nthe man and his indifferent politeness, through which she seemed to\r\ndetect the lurking contempt; and as his glance of cold irony fell upon\r\nher from time to time, from beneath the heavy lids, she found herself\r\nbeginning to take part not only against herself but also against the\r\ntype of woman to which she belonged.\r\n\r\nHaving made the necessary adjustments, and given the necessary\r\ndirections, Darrell went over to the fire-place, and cast himself into a\r\nlounge, where the leather screen shut out his well-appointed person from\r\nGertrude\'s sight. She, on her part, set about her task without\r\nenjoyment, and was glad when it was over and she could pack up the\r\ndark-slides. As she was unscrewing the camera from the stand, the\r\ncurtain before the doorway was pushed aside for the second time, and a\r\nman entered unannounced. At the same moment Darrell advanced from behind\r\nhis screen, and the two men met in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n"Delighted to see you back, my dear fellow."\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Gertrude that a shade of deference had infused itself into\r\nthe artist\'s manner, as he cordially clasped hands with the new comer.\r\n\r\nThis person was a tall, sinewy man of from thirty-five to forty years of\r\nage, with stooping shoulders and a brown beard. From her corner by the\r\neasel Miss Lorimer could see his face, and her casual glance falling\r\nupon it was arrested by a sudden sense of recognition.\r\n\r\nWhere had she seen them before; the ample forehead, the clear, grey\r\neyes, the rough yet generous lines of the features?\r\n\r\nThis man\'s face was sunburnt, cheery, smiling; the face which it\r\nrecalled had been pale, haggard, worn with watching and sorrow. Then, as\r\nby a flash, she saw it all again before her eyes; the dainty room\r\nflooded with October sunlight; the dead woman lying there with her\r\ngolden hair spread on the pillow; the bearded, averted face, and\r\nstooping form of the figure that crouched by the window.\r\n\r\n"I only hope," she reflected, "that he will not recognise me. The\r\nrecollections that the sight of me would summon up could scarcely be\r\npleasant. I have no wish to enact the part of skeleton at the feast."\r\n\r\nWith a desponding sense that she had no right to her existence, Gertrude\r\ngathered up her possessions and made her way across the room.\r\n\r\nDarrell came forward slowly, "Oh, put down those heavy things," he said.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, for it was he, went over to the fire-place and stood\r\nthere warming his hands.\r\n\r\n"May I trouble you to have a cab called?"\r\n\r\nGertrude spoke in her most dignified manner.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. But won\'t you come to the fire?"\r\n\r\nDarrell rang a bell which stood on the mantelshelf, and indicated to\r\nGertrude a chair by the screen.\r\n\r\nGertrude, however, preferred to stand, and for some moments the three\r\npeople on the tiger-skin hearthrug stared into the fire in silence.\r\n\r\nThen Darrell said in an offhand manner: "Miss Lorimer has been kind\r\nenough to photograph my \'Grand Canal\' for me."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, looking up suddenly, met Gertrude\'s glance. For a moment\r\na puzzled expression came into his eyes, then changed to one of\r\nrecognition and recollection. After some hesitation, he said:\r\n\r\n"It must be difficult to do justice in a photograph to such a picture."\r\n\r\nShe threw him back his commonplace:\r\n\r\n"Oh, the gradations of tone often come out surprisingly well."\r\n\r\nInwardly she was saying, "How he must hate the sight of me."\r\n\r\nDarrell looked from one to the other, dimly suspicious of their mutual\r\nconsciousness, then rejected the suspicion as an absurd one.\r\n\r\n"I will write to you about those sketches," he said, as the cab was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nLucy and Phyllis were frisking about the studio, as young creatures will\r\ndo in the spring, when Gertrude entered, weary and dispirited, from her\r\nexpedition to The Sycamores.\r\n\r\nThe girls fell upon her at once for news.\r\n\r\nShe flung herself into the sitter\'s chair, which half revolved with the\r\nviolence of the action.\r\n\r\n"Say something nice to me," she cried. "Compliment me on my beauty, my\r\ntalents, my virtues. There is no flattery so gross that I could not\r\nswallow it."\r\n\r\nPhyllis looked from her to Lucy and tapped her forehead in significant\r\npantomime.\r\n\r\n"You are everything that is most delightful," said Lucy; "only do tell\r\nus about the great man."\r\n\r\n"He was odious," cried Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"She has never been quarrelling, I will not say with her own, but with\r\n_our_ bread-and-butter," said Phyllis, in affected dismay.\r\n\r\n"I will never go there again, if that\'s what you mean."\r\n\r\n"But what is the matter, Gerty? I found him quite polite."\r\n\r\n"Polite? It is worse than rudeness, a politeness which says so plainly:\r\n\'This is for my own sake, not for yours.\'"\r\n\r\n"You are really cross, Gerty; what has the illustrious Sidney been doing\r\nto you?" said Lucy, who did not suffer from violent likes and dislikes.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Gertrude, laughing ruefully; "how shall I explain? He is\r\nthis sort of man;--if a woman were talking to him of--of the motions of\r\nthe heavenly bodies, he would be thinking all the time of the shape of\r\nher ankles."\r\n\r\n"Great heavens, Gerty, did you make the experiment?"\r\n\r\nPhyllis opened her pretty eyes their widest as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"We all know," remarked Lucy, with a twinkle in her eye, "that it is\r\nbest to begin with a little aversion."\r\n\r\nPhyllis struck an attitude:\r\n\r\n"\'Friends meet to part, but foes once joined----\'"\r\n\r\n"Girls, what has come over you?" exclaimed Gertrude, dismayed.\r\n\r\n"Gerty is shocked," said Lucy; "one is always stumbling unawares on her\r\nsense of propriety."\r\n\r\n"She is like the Bishop of Rumtyfoo," added Phyllis; "she does draw the\r\nline at such unexpected places."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSHOW SUNDAY.\r\n\r\n     _La science l\'avait gard\xe9 na\xeff._\r\n                     ALPHONSE DAUDET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last Sunday in March was Show Sunday; and Frank, who was of a\r\nfestive disposition, had invited all the people he knew in London to\r\ninspect his pictures and Mr. Oakley\'s before they were sent in to the\r\nRoyal Academy.\r\n\r\nMr. Oakley was a middle-aged Bohemian, who had made a small success in\r\nhis youth and never got beyond it. It had been enough, however, to\r\nlaunch him into the artistic world, and it was probably only owing to\r\nthe countenance of his brothers of the brush that he was able to sell\r\nhis pictures at all. Oakley was an accepted fact, if nothing more; the\r\ncritics treated him with respect if without enthusiasm; the exhibition\r\ncommittees hung him, though not indeed on the line, and the public\r\nbought his pictures, which had the advantage of being moderate in price\r\nand signed with a name that everybody knew.\r\n\r\nOf course this indifferent child of the earth had a wife and family; and\r\nhe had been only too glad to share his studio expenses with young\r\nJermyn, whose father, the Cornish clergyman, had been a friend of his\r\nown youth.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Gertrude, as the Lorimers dressed for Frank\'s party,\r\n"if there will be a lot of gorgeous people this afternoon?" And she\r\nlooked ruefully at the patch on her boot, with a humiliating\r\nreminiscence of Darrell\'s watchful eye.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect so," answered Phyllis, whose pretty feet were\r\nappropriately shod. "You know what dowdy people one meets at the\r\nOakleys. Oh, of course they know others, but they don\'t turn up,\r\nsomehow."\r\n\r\n"Then there will be Mr. Jermyn\'s people," said Lucy, inspecting her\r\ngloves with a frown.\r\n\r\n"A lot of pretty, well-dressed girls, no doubt," answered Phyllis; "I\r\nexpect that well-beloved youth has a wife in every port, or at least a\r\nyoung woman in every suburb."\r\n\r\n"_Apropos_," said Gertrude, "I wonder if the Devonshires will be there.\r\nWe never seem to see Conny in these days."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it rather a strain on friendship," answered Phyllis, shrewdly,\r\n"when two sets of our friends become acquainted, and seem to prefer one\r\nanother to _us_, the old and tried and trusty friend of each?"\r\n\r\n"What horrid things you say sometimes, Phyllis," objected Lucy, as the\r\nthree sisters trooped downstairs.\r\n\r\nFanny was not with them; she was spending the day with some relations of\r\nher mother\'s.\r\n\r\nA curious, dreamlike sensation stole over Gertrude at finding herself\r\nonce again in a roomful of people; and as an old war-horse is said to\r\nbecome excited at the sound of battle, so she felt the social instincts\r\nrise strongly within her as the familiar, forgotten pageant of nods and\r\nbecks and wreathed smiles burst anew upon her.\r\n\r\nFrank shot across the room, like an arrow from the bow, as the Lorimers\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"How late you are," he said; "I was beginning to have a horrible fear\r\nthat you were not coming at all."\r\n\r\n"How pretty it all is," said Lucy, sweetly. "Those great brass jars with\r\nthe daffodils are charming; and what an overwhelming number of people."\r\n\r\nConny came up to them, splendid as ever, but with a restless light in\r\nher eyes, an unnatural flush on her cheek.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, girls?" she said, abruptly. "You look seedy, Gerty."\r\nThen, as Frank moved off to fetch them some tea: "I do so hate afternoon\r\naffairs, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"How pretty Frank looks," whispered Phyllis to Lucy; "I like to see him\r\nflying in and out among the people, as though his life depended on it,\r\ndon\'t you? And the daffodil in his coat just suits his complexion."\r\n\r\n"Phyllis, don\'t be so silly!"\r\n\r\nLucy refrained from smiling, but her eyes followed, with some amusement,\r\nthe picturesque and active figure of her host, as he went about his\r\nduties with his usual air of earnestness and candour.\r\n\r\n"Come and look at the pictures, Lucy. That\'s what you\'re here for, you\r\nknow," remarked Fred, who had joined their group, and was looking the\r\nvery embodiment of Philistine comeliness. "I haven\'t seen you for an\r\nage," he added, as they made their way to one of the easels.\r\n\r\n"That is your own fault, isn\'t it?" said Lucy, lightly.\r\n\r\n"Conny has got it into her head that you don\'t care to see us."\r\n\r\n"How can Conny be so silly?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell her I told you. She would be in no end of a wax," he added,\r\nas Phyllis and Constance pressed by them in the crush.\r\n\r\nGertrude was still standing near the doorway, sipping her tea, and\r\nlooking about her with a rather wistful interest. She had caught here\r\nand there glimpses of familiar faces, faces from her own old world--that\r\nworld which, taken _en masse_, she had so fervently disliked; but no one\r\nhad taken any notice of the young woman by the doorway, with her pale\r\nface and suit of rusty black.\r\n\r\n"I feel like a ghost," she said to Frank, as she handed him her empty\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n"You do look horribly white," he answered, with genuine concern; "I\r\nwish you were looking as well as your sisters--Miss Phyllis for\r\ninstance."\r\n\r\nHe glanced across as he spoke with undisguised admiration at the slim\r\nyoung figure, and blooming face of the girl, who stood smiling down with\r\namiable indifference at one of his own canvasses.\r\n\r\nPhyllis Lorimer belonged to that rare order of women who are absolutely\r\nindependent of their clothes.\r\n\r\nBy the side of her old black gown and well-worn hat, Constance\r\nDevonshire\'s elaborate spring costume looked vulgar and obtrusive; and\r\nConstance herself, in the light of her friend\'s more delicate beauty,\r\nseemed _bourgeoise_ and overblown.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this contrast was not lost on two men who, at this point\r\nof the proceedings, strolled into the room, and whom the Oakleys came\r\nforward with some _empressement_ to receive.\r\n\r\n"I have brought you Lord Watergate," Gertrude heard one of them say, in\r\na voice which she recognised at once, the sound of which filled her with\r\na vague sense of discomfort.\r\n\r\n"Darrell, by all that\'s wonderful!" said Frank, _sotto voce_, his eyes\r\nshining with enthusiasm; "there, with the light Vandyke beard--but you\r\nknow him already."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he a Show Sunday of his own?" replied Gertrude, in a voice that\r\nimplied that the wish was father to the thought.\r\n\r\n"He has a gallery all to himself in Bond Street this season. I wonder if\r\nhe will sing this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Darrell is a person of many accomplishments it seems."\r\n\r\n"Oh, rather!" and Frank went off to offer a pleased and modest welcome\r\nto the illustrious guest.\r\n\r\nSidney Darrell, having succeeded in escaping from the Oakleys and their\r\ntea-table, made his way across the room, stopping here and there to\r\nexchange greetings with the people that he knew, and moving with that\r\nostentatious air of lack of purpose which is so often assumed in society\r\nto mask a set and deliberate plan.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Miss Lorimer?" He stopped in front of Phyllis and held\r\nout his hand.\r\n\r\nPhyllis\'s flower-face brightened at this recognition from the great man.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t you think this is the most ridiculous institution on the\r\nface of the earth?" said Darrell, as he took his place beside her, for\r\nConny had moved off discreetly at his approach.\r\n\r\n"Which institution? Tea, pictures, people?"\r\n\r\n"Their incongruous combination under the name of Show Sunday."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think it\'s fun. But then I have never seen the sort of thing\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"You are greatly to be envied, Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\n"How lovely Phyllis is looking," cried Conny, who had joined Gertrude\r\nnear the doorway; "she grows prettier every day."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" answered Gertrude. "She looks to me more delicate\r\nthan ever, with that flush on her cheek, and that shining in her eyes."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Gerty; you are quite ridiculous about Phyllis. She appears to\r\nbe amusing Mr. Darrell, at any rate. She says just the sort of things\r\nMr. Lorimer used to. She is more like him than any of you."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Gertrude winced; then, looking up, saw Mr. Oakley and a tall man\r\nstanding before her.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate, Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\nThe grey eyes looked straight into hers, and a deep voice said--\r\n\r\n"We have met before. But I scarcely ventured to regard myself as\r\nintroduced to you."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate smiled as he spoke, and, with a sense of relief, Gertrude\r\nfelt that here, at least, was a friendly presence.\r\n\r\n"I met you at The Sycamores on Wednesday."\r\n\r\n"If it could be called a meeting. That\'s a wonderful picture of\r\nDarrell\'s."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oakley has been telling me about the great success in photography of\r\nyou and your sisters."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about success!" Gertrude laughed.\r\n\r\n"You look so tired, Miss Lorimer; let me find you a seat."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; I prefer to stand. One sees the world so much better."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you like to see the world?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is always interesting."\r\n\r\n"It is to be assumed that you are fond of society?"\r\n\r\n"Does one follow from the other?"\r\n\r\n"No; I merely hazarded the question."\r\n\r\n"One demands so much more of a game in which one is taking part," said\r\nGertrude; "and with social intercourse, one is always thinking how much\r\nbetter managed it might be."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n"Now what is your ideal society, Miss Lorimer?"\r\n\r\n"A society not of class, caste, or family--but of picked individuals."\r\n\r\n"I think we tend more and more towards such a society, at least in\r\nLondon," said Lord Watergate; then added, "You are a democrat, Miss\r\nLorimer."\r\n\r\n"And you are an optimist, Lord Watergate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m quite unformulated. But let us leave off this mutual\r\nrecrimination for the present; and perhaps you can tell me who is the\r\nlady talking to Sidney Darrell."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate\'s attention had been suddenly caught by Phyllis; Gertrude\r\nnoted that he was looking at her with all his eyes.\r\n\r\n"That is one of my sisters," she said.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards her with a start; there was a note of constraint in\r\nhis tones as he said--\r\n\r\n"She is very beautiful."\r\n\r\nWhat was there in his voice, in his face, that suddenly brought before\r\nGertrude\'s vision the image of the dead woman, her golden hair, and\r\nhaggard beauty?\r\n\r\nPhyllis, on her part, had been aware of the brief but intense gaze which\r\nthe grey eyes had cast upon her from the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n"Who is that person talking to my sister?" she said.\r\n\r\nDarrell looked across coldly, and answered: "Oh, that\'s Lord Watergate,\r\nthe great physiologist."\r\n\r\n"I have never met a lord before."\r\n\r\n"And, after all, this isn\'t much of a lord, because the peer is quite\r\nswallowed up in the man of science."\r\n\r\nOakley came up, entreating Darrell to sing.\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t it quite irregular, to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we don\'t pretend to be fashionable. This isn\'t \'Show Sunday,\' pure\r\nand simple, but just a pretext for seeing one\'s friends."\r\n\r\n"By the by," said the artist, as Oakley went off to open the little\r\npiano, "is it any good my sending the sketches this week? though it\'s\r\nhorribly bad form to talk shop."\r\n\r\n"You must ask my sister about those things."\r\n\r\n"Oh, your sister is far and away too clever for me."\r\n\r\n"Gertrude is clever, but not in the way you mean."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, I am horribly afraid of her."\r\n\r\nDarrell went over to the piano and sang a little French song, with\r\nperfect art, in his rich baritone. Gertrude watched him, as he sat there\r\nplaying his own accompaniment, and a vague terror stole over her of this\r\nirreproachable-looking person, who did everything so well; whose quiet\r\npresence was redolent of an immeasurable, because an unknown strength;\r\nand who, she felt (indignantly remembering the cold irony of his glance)\r\ncould never, under any circumstances, be made to appear ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the song, Phyllis came over to Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we going, Gerty?" she said; "It is quite unfashionable to \'make\r\na night of it\' like this. One is just supposed to look round and sail\r\noff to half-a-dozen other studios."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, who stood near, caught the half-whispered words, and\r\nsmiled, as one smiles at the nonsense of a pretty child. Gertrude saw\r\nthe expression of his face as she answered--\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is time we went. Tell Lucy; there she is with Mr. Jermyn."\r\n\r\nDarrell came over to them as they were going, and shook hands, first\r\nwith Gertrude, and then with Phyllis.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said to the latter, "for a very pleasant afternoon."\r\n\r\nBoth he and Lord Watergate lingered in York Place till the other guests\r\nhad departed, when they fell upon Frank for further information\r\nrespecting the photographic studio.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t look as if it paid them," remarked Darrell, by way of\r\nadministering a damper to loyal Frank\'s enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Lord Watergate, "if they would think it worth while to\r\nprepare some slides for me?"\r\n\r\n"For the Royal Institution lectures?" Darrell sat down to the piano as\r\nhe spoke, and ran his hands over the keys. "She is a charming\r\ncreature--Phyllis."\r\n\r\n"Charming!" cried Frank; "and so is Miss Lucy. And Gertrude is charming,\r\ntoo; she is the clever one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Gertrude is the clever one; you can see that by her boots."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lorimers and the Devonshires were walking up Baker Street\r\ntogether, engaged, on their part also, in discussing the people from\r\nwhom they had just parted.\r\n\r\n"You are quite wrong, Gerty, about Mr. Darrell," cried Phyllis; "he is\r\nvery nice, and great fun."\r\n\r\n"What, the fellow with the goatee?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Fred, his beautiful Vandyke beard!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care, I don\'t like him."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I, Fred," said Gertrude, with decision, as the whole party\r\nturned into Number 20B, and went up to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"I think really you are a little unreasonable," said Lucy, putting her\r\narm round her sister\'s waist; "he seemed quite a nice person."\r\n\r\n"He looks," put in Conny, speaking for the first time, "as though he\r\nmeant to have the best of everything. But so do a great many of us mean\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"But not," cried Gertrude, "by trampling over the bodies of other\r\npeople. Ah, you are all laughing at me. But can one be expected to think\r\nwell of a person who makes one feel like a strong-minded clown?"\r\n\r\nThey laughed more than ever at the curious image summoned up by her\r\nwords; then Phyllis remarked, critically--\r\n\r\n"There is one thing I don\'t like about him, and that is his eye. I\r\nparticularly detest that sort of eye; prominent, with heavy lids, and\r\nthose little puffy bags underneath."\r\n\r\n"Phyllis, spare us these realistic descriptions," protested Lucy, "and\r\nlet us dismiss Mr. Darrell, for the present at least. Perhaps our\r\nrevered chaperon will tell us something of her experiences with a\r\ncertain noble lord," she added, placing in her dress, with a smile of\r\nthanks, the gardenia of which Fred had divested himself in her favour.\r\n\r\n"It was very nice of him," said Gertrude, gravely, "to get Mr. Oakley to\r\nintroduce him to me, if only to show me that the sight of me did not\r\nmake him sick."\r\n\r\n"I like his face," added Lucy; "there is something almost boyish about\r\nit. Do you remember what Daudet says of the old doctor in _Jack_, \'La\r\nscience l\'avait gard\xe9 na\xeff.\'"\r\n\r\n"What a set of gossips we are," cried Conny, who had taken little part\r\nin the conversation. "Come along, Fred; you know we are dining at the\r\nGreys to-night."\r\n\r\n"Botheration! They are certain to give me Nelly to take in," grumbled\r\nFred, who, like many of his sex, was extremely modest where his feelings\r\nwere concerned, but cherished a belief that the mass of womankind had\r\ndesigns upon him; "and we never know what on earth to say to one\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"There goes Mr. Jermyn," observed Phyllis, as the door closed on the\r\nbrother and sister; "he said something about coming in here to-night."\r\n\r\nLucy, who was seated at some distance from the window, allowed herself\r\nto look up, and smiled as she remarked--\r\n\r\n"What ages ago it seems since we used to wonder about him and call him\r\n\'Conny\'s man.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Conny\'s man,\'" added Phyllis, with a curl of her pretty lips, "who\r\ndoes not care two straws for Conny."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSUMMING UP.\r\n\r\n     _J\'ai peur d\'Avril, peur de l\'\xe9moi\r\n     Qu\'\xe9veille sa douceur touchante._\r\n                       SULLY PRUDHOMME.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril had come round again; and, like M. Sully Prudhomme, Gertrude was\r\nafraid of April.\r\n\r\nAs Fanny had remarked to Frank, the month had very painful associations\r\nfor them all; but Gertrude\'s terror was older than their troubles, and\r\nwas founded, not on the recollection of past sorrow, so much as on the\r\ncruel hunger for a present joy. And now again, after all her struggles,\r\nher passionate care for others, her resolute putting away of all\r\nthoughts of personal happiness, now again the Spring was stirring in\r\nher veins, and voices which she had believed silenced for ever arose\r\nonce more in her heart and clamoured for a hearing.\r\n\r\nOften, before business hours, Gertrude might be seen walking round\r\nRegent\'s Park at a swinging pace, exorcising her demons; she was\r\nobliged, as she said, to ride her soul on the curb, and be very careful\r\nthat it did not take the bit between its teeth--this poor, weak\r\nGertrude, who seemed such a fountain-head of wisdom, such a tower of\r\nstrength to the people among whom she dwelt.\r\n\r\nAt this period, also, she had had recourse, in the pauses of\r\nprofessional work, to her old consolation of literary effort, and had\r\neven sent some of her productions to Paternoster Row, with the same\r\nunsatisfactory results as of yore, she and Frank uniting their voices in\r\nthat bitter cry of the rejected contributor, which in these days is\r\nheard through the breadth and length of the land.\r\n\r\nOne morning she came into the studio after her walk, to find Lucy\r\nengaged in focussing Frank, who was seated, wearing an air of immense\r\nsolemnity, in the sitter\'s chair. Phyllis, meanwhile, hovered about,\r\nbestowing hints and suggestions on them both, secretly enjoying the\r\nquiet humour of the scene.\r\n\r\n"It is Mr. Jermyn\'s birthday present," she announced, as Gertrude\r\nentered. "He is going to send it to Cornwall, which will be a nice\r\nadvertisement for us."\r\n\r\nFrank blushed slightly; and Lucy cried from beneath her black cloth,\r\n"Don\'t get up, Mr. Jermyn; Gertrude will excuse you, I am sure."\r\n\r\nGertrude, laughing, retreated to the waiting-room; where, throwing\r\nherself into a chair, and leaning both her elbows on a rickety scarlet\r\ntable, she stared vaguely at the little picture of youth and grace which\r\nthe parted curtains revealed to her.\r\n\r\nHow could they be so cheerful, so heedless? cried her heart, with a\r\nsudden impatience. Was this life, this ceaseless messing about in a\r\npokey glass out-house, this eating and drinking and sleeping in the\r\nshabby London rooms?\r\n\r\nWas any human creature to be blamed who rebelled against it? Did not\r\nflesh and blood cry out against such sordidness, with all the revel of\r\nthe spring-time going on in the world beyond?\r\n\r\nIt is base and ignoble perhaps to scorn the common round, the trivial\r\ntask, but is it not also ignoble and base to become so immersed in them\r\nas to desire nothing beyond?\r\n\r\n"What mean thoughts I am thinking," cried Gertrude to herself, shocked\r\nat her own mood; then, gazing mechanically in front of her, saw Lucy\r\ndisappear into the dark-room, and Frank come forward with outstretched\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"At last I can say \'good-morning,\' Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\nGertrude gave him her hand with a smile; Jermyn\'s was a presence that\r\nsomehow always cleared the moral atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"You will never guess," said Frank, "what I have brought you."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he drew from his pocket a number of _The Woodcut_, damp\r\nfrom the press, and opening it at a particular page, spread it on the\r\ntable before her.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, becoming aware of these proceedings, came across to the\r\nwaiting-room and leaned over her sister\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gerty, what fun."\r\n\r\nOn one side of the page was a large wood-engraving representing four\r\npeople on a lawn-tennis court. Three of them were girls, in whom could\r\nbe traced distinct resemblance to the three Lorimers; while the fourth,\r\na man, had about him an unmistakable suggestion of Jermyn himself. The\r\ninitials "F. J." were writ large in a corner of the picture, and on the\r\nopposite page were the following verses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     What wonder that I should be dreaming[A]\r\n       Out here in the garden to-day?\r\n     The light through the leaves is streaming;\r\n                 _Paulina cries, "Play!"_\r\n\r\n     The birds to each other are calling;\r\n     The freshly-cut grasses smell sweet--\r\n     _To Teddy\'s dismay comes falling\r\n                 The ball at my feet!_\r\n\r\n     "_Your stroke should be over, not under._"\r\n     "_But that\'s such a difficult way!_"\r\n     The place is a spring-tide wonder\r\n                 Of lilac and may.\r\n\r\n     Of lilac and may and laburnam;\r\n     Of blossom--"_we\'re losing the set!\r\n     Those volleys of Jenny\'s, return them,\r\n                 Stand close to the net!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n               ENVOI.\r\n\r\n     You are so fond of the may-time,\r\n           My friend far away,\r\n     Small wonder that I should be dreaming\r\n           Of you in the garden to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verses were signed "G. Lorimer"; and Gertrude\'s eyes rested on them\r\nwith the peculiar tenderness with which we all of us regard our efforts\r\nthe first time that we see ourselves in print.\r\n\r\n"How nice they look, Gerty," cried Phyllis. "And Mr. Jermyn\'s picture.\r\nBut I think they have spoilt it a little in the engraving."\r\n\r\n"It is rather a come down after _Charlotte Corday_, isn\'t it?" said\r\nGertrude, pleased yet rueful.\r\n\r\nFrank, who had been told the history of that unfortunate tragedy,\r\nanswered rather wistfully--\r\n\r\n"We have all to get off our high horse, Miss Lorimer, if we want to\r\nlive. I had ten guineas this morning for that thing; and there is the\r\n_Death of OEdipus_ with its face to the wall in the studio--and likely\r\nto remain there, unless we run short of firewood one of these days."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember," said Gertrude, "how Warrington threw cold water on\r\nPendennis by telling him to stick to poems like the _Church Porch_ and\r\nabandon his beloved _Ariadne in Naxos_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Frank, "and I never could share Warrington\'s--and\r\npresumably Thackeray\'s--admiration for those verses."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Gertrude, as Lucy emerged triumphantly from the dark-room\r\nand announced the startling success of her negatives.\r\n\r\nShe was shown the wonderful poem, and the no less wonderful picture, and\r\nthen Phyllis said--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t gloat so over it, Gerty." For Gertrude was still sitting at the\r\ntable absorbed in contemplation of the printed sheet spread out before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nGertrude laughed and pushed the paper away; and Lucy quoted gravely--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "\'We all, the foolish and the wise,\r\n     Regard our verse with fascination,\r\n     Through asinine-paternal eyes,\r\n     And hues of fancy\'s own creation!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nA vociferous little clock on the mantelpiece struck ten.\r\n\r\n"I must be off," said Frank; "there will be my model waiting for me. I\r\nam afraid I have wasted a great deal of your time this morning."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Lucy, as Gertrude rose and folded the seductive\r\n_Woodcut_, with a get-thee-behind-me-Satan air; "though I am glad to say\r\nwe are quite busy."\r\n\r\n"There are Lord Watergate\'s slides," added Phyllis; "and Mr. Darrell\'s\r\nsketches to finish off; not to speak of possible chance-comers."\r\n\r\n"How do you get on with Darrell?" said Frank, who seemed to have\r\nforgotten his model, and made no movement to go.\r\n\r\n"He has only been here once," answered Lucy, promptly; "but I like what\r\nI have seen of him."\r\n\r\n"So do I," cried Phyllis.\r\n\r\n"And I," added Frank.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this unanimity Gertrude wisely held her peace.\r\n\r\n"Well then, good-bye," said Frank, reluctantly holding out his hand to\r\neach in turn--to Lucy, last. "I am dining out to-night and to-morrow, so\r\nshall not see you for an age, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Gay person," said Lucy, whose hand lingered in his; held there firmly,\r\nand without resistance on her part.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bore," cried Frank, making wistful eyebrows, and looking at her\r\nvery hard.\r\n\r\nGertrude started, struck for the first time by something in the tone and\r\nattitude of them both. With a shock that bewildered her, she realised\r\nthe secret of their mutual content; and, stirred up by this unconscious\r\nrevelation, a conflicting throng of thoughts, images, and emotions arose\r\nwithin her.\r\n\r\nGertrude worked like a nigger that day, which, fortunately for her state\r\nof mind, turned out an unusually busy one. Lucy was industrious too, but\r\nwent about her work humming little tunes, with a serenity that\r\ncontrasted with her sister\'s rather feverish laboriousness. Even Phyllis\r\ncondescended to lend a hand to the finishing off of the prints of Sidney\r\nDarrell\'s sketches.\r\n\r\nAll three were rather tired by the time they joined Fanny round the\r\nsupper-table, who, herself, presented a pathetic picture of ladylike\r\nboredom.\r\n\r\nThe meal proceeded for some time in silence, broken occasionally by a\r\nprofessional remark from one or other of them; then Lucy said--\r\n\r\n"You\'re not eating, Fanny."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not hungry," answered Fan, with an injured air.\r\n\r\nShe looked more like a superannuated baby than ever, with her pale\r\neyebrows arched to her hair, and the corners of her small thin mouth\r\ndrooped peevishly.\r\n\r\n"This pudding isn\'t half bad, really, Fan," said Phyllis,\r\ngood-naturedly, as she helped herself to a second portion. "I should\r\nadvise you to try it."\r\n\r\nFanny\'s under-lip quivered in a touchingly infantile manner, and, in\r\nanother moment, splash! fell a great tear on the table-cloth.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well to talk about pudding," she cried, struggling\r\nhelplessly with the gurgling sobs. "To leave one alone all the blessed\r\nday, and not a word to throw at one when you do come upstairs, unless,\r\nif you please, it\'s \'pudding!\' Pudding!" went on Fan, with contemptuous\r\nemphasis, and abandoning herself completely to her rising emotions. "You\r\nseem to take me for an idiot, all of you, who think yourselves so\r\nclever. What do you care how dull it is for me up here all day, alone\r\nfrom morning till night, while you are amusing yourselves below, or\r\ngadding about at gentlemen\'s studios."\r\n\r\n"That sounds just like Aunt Caroline," said Phyllis, in a stage-whisper;\r\nbut Lucy, rising, went round to her weeping sister, and, gathering the\r\nbig, silly head, and wide moist face to her bosom, proceeded to\r\nadminister comfort after the usual inarticulate, feminine fashion.\r\n\r\n"Fanny is right," cried Gertrude, smitten with sudden remorse. "It is\r\nhorribly dull for her, and we are very thoughtless."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I said anything about it," sobbed Fanny; "but flesh and\r\nblood couldn\'t stand it any longer."\r\n\r\n"You were quite right to tell us, Fan. We have been horrid," cried Lucy,\r\nas she gently led her from the room. "Come upstairs with me, and lie\r\ndown. You have not been looking well all the week."\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes Lucy re-appeared alone, to find the table cleared,\r\nand her sisters sewing by the lamplight.\r\n\r\n"Fan has gone to bed," she announced; "she was a little hysterical, and\r\nI persuaded her to undress."\r\n\r\n"It _is_ dull for her, I know," said Gertrude, really distressed; "but\r\nwhat is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"And she has been so good all these months," answered Lucy. "She has had\r\nnone of the fun, and all the anxiety and pinching, and this is the first\r\ncomplaint we have heard from her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has come out surprisingly well through it all."\r\n\r\nGertrude sighed as she spoke, secretly reproaching herself that there\r\nwas not more love in her heart for poor Fanny.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon appeared at this point to offer the young ladies her own\r\ncopy of the _Waterloo Place Gazette_, a little bit of neighbourly\r\ncourtesy in which she often indulged, and which to-night was especially\r\nappreciated, as creating a diversion from an unpleasant topic.\r\n\r\n"\'A woman shot at Turnham Green,\'" cried Phyllis, glancing down a column\r\nof miscellaneous items, while the lamplight fell on her bent brown head.\r\n"\'More fighting in Africa.\' Ah, here\'s something interesting at\r\nlast.--\'We understand that the exhibition of Mr. Sidney Darrell,\r\nA.R.A.\'s pictures, to be held in the Berkeley Galleries, New Bond\r\nStreet, will be opened to the public on the first of next month. The\r\nevent is looked forward to with great interest in artistic circles, as\r\nthe collection is said to include many works never before exhibited in\r\nLondon.\' _I_ shall go like a shot; sha\'n\'t you, Gerty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and slip little dynamite machines behind the pictures. Let me look\r\nat that paper, Phyllis."\r\n\r\nPhyllis pushed it towards her, and, as she took it up, her eye fell on\r\nthe date of the month printed at the top of the page.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," she said, "that it is a year to-day that we finally\r\ndecided on starting our business?"\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Lucy. "Do you mean from that day when Aunt Caroline came\r\nand pitched into us all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and when Mr. Russel\'s letter appeared on the scene, just as we\r\nwere thinking of rushing in a body to the nearest chemist\'s for\r\nlaudanum."\r\n\r\n"And when we made a lot of good resolutions; do you remember?" cried\r\nPhyllis.\r\n\r\n"What were they?" said Gertrude. "One was, that we would be happy."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think we have kept that one at least," observed Lucy, with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked across at her sister rather wistfully, as she answered,\r\n"Yes, on the whole. What was the other resolution? That we would not be\r\ncynical, was it not?"\r\n\r\n"There hasn\'t been the slightest ground for cynicism; quite the other\r\nway," said Lucy. "It is not much credit to us to have kept that\r\nresolution."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," observed Phyllis, lightly; "some people have been\r\nrather horrid; have forgotten all about us, or not been nice. Don\'t you\r\nremember, Gerty, how Gerald St. Aubyn dodged round the corner at Baker\r\nStreet the other day because he didn\'t care to be seen bowing to two\r\nshabby young women with heavy parcels? And, Lucy, have you forgotten\r\nwhat you told us about Jack Sinclair, when you met him, travelling from\r\nthe north? How he never took any notice of you, because you happened to\r\nbe riding third class, and had your old gown on? Jack, who used to make\r\nsuch a fuss about picking up one\'s pocket-handkerchief and opening the\r\ndoor for one."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Gertrude, "that to think about those sort of\r\nthings makes one almost as mean as the people who do them."\r\n\r\n"And directly a person shows himself capable of doing them, why, it\r\nceases to matter about him in the least," added Lucy, with youthful\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nGertrude was silent a moment, then said, with something of an effort:\r\n"Let us direct our attention to the charming new people we have got to\r\nknow. One gets to know them in such a much more pleasant way, somehow."\r\n\r\nLucy bent her head over her work, hiding her flushed face as she\r\nanswered, "That is the best of being poor; one\'s chances of artificial\r\nacquaintanceships are so much lessened. One gains in quality what one\r\nloses in quantity."\r\n\r\n"How moral we are growing," cried Phyllis. "We shall be quoting\r\nScripture next, and saying it is harder for the camel to get through the\r\nneedle\'s eye, &c., &c."\r\n\r\nGertrude laughed.\r\n\r\n"There is another point to consider," she said. "I suppose you both know\r\nthat we are not making our fortunes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Lucy; "but, at the same time, the business has almost\r\ndoubled itself in the course of the last three months."\r\n\r\n"That sounds more prosperous than it really is, Lucy. If it hadn\'t done\r\nso, we should have had to think seriously of giving it up. And, as it\r\nis, we cannot be sure, till the end of the year, that we shall be able\r\nto hold on."\r\n\r\n"You mean the end of the business year; next June?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Mr. Russel is coming, and there is to be a great overhauling of\r\naccounts."\r\n\r\nGertrude lay awake that night long after her sisters were asleep. Her\r\nbrief rebellious mood of the morning had passed away, and, looking back\r\non the year behind her, she experienced a measure of the content which\r\nwe all feel after something attempted, something done. That she had been\r\nbrought face to face with the sterner side of life, had lost some\r\nillusions, suffered some pain, she did not regret. It seemed to her that\r\nshe had not paid too great a price for the increased reality of her\r\npresent existence.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep, then woke at dawn with a low cry. She had been dreaming\r\nof Lucy and Frank; had seen their faces, as she had seen them the day\r\nbefore, bright with the glow of the light which never was on sea and\r\nland. Oh, she had always known, nay, hoped, that this, or rather\r\nsomething akin to this, would come; yet sharp was the pang that ran\r\nthrough her at the recollection.\r\n\r\nIt had always seemed to her highly improbable that her sisters,\r\nportionless as they were, should remain unmarried. One day, she had\r\nalways told herself, they would go away, and she and Fanny would be left\r\nalone. She did not wish it otherwise. She had a feminine belief in love\r\nas the crown and flower of life; yet, as the shadow of the coming\r\nseparation fell upon her, her spirit grew desolate and afraid; and,\r\nlying there in the chill grey morning, she wept very bitterly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[A] From _Lawn Tennis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nA CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\n     _It may be one will dance to-day,\r\n        And dance no more to-morrow;\r\n     It may be one will steal away,\r\n        And nurse a lifelong sorrow;\r\n     What then?

"\'The Misses Lorimer and friends.\' Why Conny might go with\r\nus."\r\n\r\nConstance Devonshire had dropped in upon them unexpectedly that\r\nafternoon, after an absence of several weeks. She was looking wretchedly\r\nill. Her usually blooming complexion had changed to a curious waxen\r\ncolour; her round face had fallen away; there were dark hollows under\r\nthe unnaturally brilliant eyes.\r\n\r\n"I should rather like to go, if you think you may take me," she said;\r\nthen added, with an air of not very spontaneous gaiety; "I suppose it\r\nwill be what the society papers call a \'smart function.\'"\r\n\r\nStoicism, it has been observed, is a savage virtue. There was something\r\nof savagery in Conny\'s fierce reserve; in the way in which she\r\nresolutely refused to acknowledge, what was evident to the most casual\r\nobserver, that there was something seriously amiss with her health and\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n"Is it not fortunate," said Lucy, "that Uncle Sebastian should have sent\r\nus that cheque? Now we shall be able to get ourselves some decent\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\n"I mean to have a grey cachemire walking-dress, and my evening dress\r\nshall be grey too," announced Phyllis, who was one of the rare people\r\nwho can wear that colour to advantage. Fanny, who had rigid ideas about\r\nmourning, declared with an air of severity that her own new outfit\r\nshould be black, then sighed, as though to call attention to the fact of\r\nher constancy to the memory of the dead, in the face of the general\r\nheedlessness.\r\n\r\n"Gerty is thinking of rose-colour, is she not?" asked Phyllis,\r\ninnocently, as she marked Gertrude\'s rapidly-suppressed movement of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n"As regards a gown for this precious Private View--I am not going to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"The head of the firm ought to show up on such an occasion, as a mere\r\nmatter of business," observed Lucy, smiling amiably at every one in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n"Yes, really, Gerty," added Phyllis, "you are the person to inspire\r\nconfidence as to the quality of our work. No one would suspect\r\n_us_"--indicating herself and her two other sisters--"of being clever.\r\nIt would be considered unlikely that nature should heap up _all_ her\r\nbenefits on the same individuals."\r\n\r\n"Am I such a fright?" asked Gertrude, a little wistfully.\r\n\r\n"No, darling; but there could be no doubt about your brains with that\r\nface."\r\n\r\n"Wait a few years," said Conny; "she will be the best looking of you\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"We will \'wait till she is eighty in the shade,\'" quoted Phyllis; "but\r\nwhen one comes to think of it, what a well-endowed family we are. Not\r\nonly is our genius good-looking; that is a comparatively common case;\r\nbut our beauties are so exceedingly intelligent; aren\'t they, Lucy?"\r\n\r\nConstance Devonshire was right. Sidney Darrell\'s Private View at the\r\nBerkley Galleries, held on the last day of April, was a very smart\r\nfunction indeed. There were duchesses, beauties, statesmen, and clever\r\npeople of every description galore. In the midst of them all Darrell\r\nhimself shone resplendent; gracious, urbane, polished; infusing just the\r\nright amount of cordiality into his many greetings, according to the\r\ndeserts of the person greeted.\r\n\r\n"I never saw any one who possessed to greater perfection the art of\r\nimpressing his importance on other people," whispered Conny to Gertrude,\r\nas the two girls strolled off together into one of the smaller rooms.\r\nLucy had been led off by Frank and one of his friends. That young woman\r\nwas never long in any mixed assembly without attracting persons of the\r\nmale sex to her side.\r\n\r\nAs for Phyllis, radiant in the new grey costume, its soft tints set off\r\nby a knot of Parma violets at the throat, she was making the round of\r\nthe pictures under the escort of no less a person than Lord Watergate,\r\nwho had come up to the Lorimers at the moment of their entrance; and\r\nFanny, in a jetted mantle and bonnet, clanked about with Mr. Oakley,\r\nhappy in the consciousness of being for once in the best society.\r\n\r\n"What a dreary thing a London crowd is," grumbled Conny, who was not\r\naccustomed, in her own set, to being left squireless.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but this is fun. So different from the parties one used to go to,"\r\nsaid Gertrude, smiling, as Lord Watergate and her sister came up to\r\nthem, to direct their attention to a particular canvas in the other\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAs they sauntered, in a body, to the entrance, Darrell came up with a\r\nyoung man of the masher type in his wake, whom he introduced to Phyllis\r\nas Lord Malplaquet.\r\n\r\n"Lord Malplaquet is dying to hear your theories of life," he said\r\nplayfully, bestowing a beaming and confidential smile upon her.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Darrell, you shall not amuse yourself at my expense," she responded\r\ngaily, as she plunged into the crowd under the wing of her new escort,\r\nwho was staring at her with the languid yet undisguised admiration of\r\nhis class.\r\n\r\n"Now this is the real thing," said Lord Watergate to Gertrude, as they\r\nstopped before the canvas they had come to seek.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gertrude, in mechanical acquiescence.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking: "What a mean soul I must have. Every one seems to like\r\nand admire this Sidney Darrell: and I suspect everything about him--even\r\nhis art. For the sake of a prejudice; of a little hurt vanity, perhaps,\r\nas well."\r\n\r\n"That, \'yes,\' hasn\'t the ring of the true coin, Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\n"This is scarcely the time and place for criticism, Lord Watergate,"\r\nlaughed Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"For hostile criticism, you mean. You are a terrible person to please,\r\nare you not?"\r\n\r\nAs the room began to clear Darrell took Frank aside, and glancing in\r\nthe direction of the sisters, who had re-united their forces, said: "You\r\nknow those girls, intimately, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Yes." (Very promptly.)\r\n\r\n"I wonder if that beautiful Phyllis would sit to me?"\r\n\r\n"She would probably be immensely honoured."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, it\'s this: I want her for Cressida."\r\n\r\n"Rather a disagreeable sort of subject isn\'t it?" said Frank,\r\ndoubtfully; then added, with professional interest: "I didn\'t know you\r\nhad such a picture on hand, Mr. Darrell."\r\n\r\n"The idea occurred to me this very afternoon. It was the sight of the\r\nfair Phyllis, in fact, which suggested it."\r\n\r\n"Were you thinking of the scene in the orchard, or in the Greek camp?"\r\n\r\n"Neither; one could hardly ask a lady to sit for such a picture. No, it\r\nis Cressida, before her fall, I want; as she stands at the street corner\r\nwith Pandarus, waiting for the Trojan heroes to pass, don\'t you know?\r\nHalf ironical, half wistful; with the light of that little _tendre_ for\r\nTroilus just beginning to dawn in her eyes. She would be the very thing\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to propose it to her?" said Frank, who looked as if he\r\ndid not much relish the idea.\r\n\r\n"I shall ask her to sit for me, at any rate. There\'s the dragon-sister\r\nto be got round first."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you are mistaken about Miss Lorimer."\r\n\r\nDarrell gave a short laugh. "I beg your pardon, my dear fellow!"\r\n\r\nFrank frowned, and Darrell, going forward to the Lorimers, preferred his\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nPhyllis looked pleased; and Gertrude, suppressing the signs of her\r\nsecret dislike to the scheme, said, quietly:\r\n\r\n"Phyllis must refer you to her sister Fanny. It depends on whether she\r\ncan spare the time to bring her to your studio."\r\n\r\nShe glanced up as she spoke, and met, almost with open defiance, the\r\nheavy grey eyes of the man opposite. From these she perceived the irony\r\nto have faded; she read nothing there but a cold dislike.\r\n\r\nIt was an old, old story the fierce yet silent opposition between these\r\ntwo people; an inevitable antipathy; a strife of type and type, of\r\nclass and class, rather than of individuals: the strife of the woman who\r\ndemands respect, with the man who refuses to grant it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhyllis was in high feather at her successful afternoon, at the\r\ncompliment paid her by the great Sidney in particular; and Fanny rather\r\nbrightened at the prospect of what bore even so distant a resemblance to\r\nan occupation, as chaperoning her sister to a studio.\r\n\r\nOnly Conny was silent and depressed, and when they reached Baker-street,\r\nfollowed Gertrude to her room. Here she flung herself on the bed,\r\nregardless of her new transparent black hat, and its daffodil trimmings.\r\n\r\n"Gerty, \'the world\'s a beast, and I hate it!\'"\r\n\r\n"You are not well, Conny. If you would only acknowledge the fact, and\r\nsee a doctor."\r\n\r\n"Gerty, come here."\r\n\r\nGertrude went over to the bed, secretly alarmed; something in her\r\nfriend\'s tones frightened her.\r\n\r\nConny crushed her face against the pillows, then said in smothered\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear it any longer. I must tell some one or it will kill me."\r\n\r\nGertrude grew pale; instinctively she felt what was coming;\r\ninstinctively she desired to ward it off.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you guess? Oh, you may say it is humiliating, unworthy; I know\r\nthat." She raised her face suddenly: "Oh, Gerty, how can I help it? He\r\nis so different from them all; from the sneaks who want one\'s money;\r\nfrom the bad imitations of fashionable young men, who snub, and\r\npatronise, and sneer at us all. Who could help it? Frank----"\r\n\r\n"Conny, Conny, you musn\'t tell me this."\r\n\r\nGertrude caught her friend in her arms, so as to shield her face. She\r\ndisapproved, generally speaking, of confidences of this kind,\r\nconsidering them bad for both giver and receiver; but this particular\r\nconfidence she felt to be simply intolerable.\r\n\r\n"Gerty, what have I done, what have I said?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, really nothing, Con, dear old girl. You have told me nothing."\r\n\r\nA pause; then Conny said, between the sobs which at last had broken\r\nforth: "How can I bear my life? How can I bear it?"\r\n\r\nGertrude was very pale.\r\n\r\n"We all have to bear things, Conny; often this kind of thing, we women."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I _can_."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will. You have no end of pluck. One day you are going to be\r\nvery happy."\r\n\r\n"Never, Gerty. We rich girls always end up with sneaks--no decent person\r\ncomes near us."\r\n\r\n"There are other things which make happiness besides--pleasant things\r\nhappening to one."\r\n\r\n"What sort of things?"\r\n\r\nGertrude paused a minute, then said bravely: "Our own self-respect, and\r\nthe integrity of the people we care for."\r\n\r\n"That sounds very nice," replied Conny, without enthusiasm, "but I\r\nshould like a little of the more obvious sorts of happiness as well."\r\n\r\nGertrude gave a laugh, which was also a sob.\r\n\r\n"So should I, Conny, so should I."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nGERTRUDE IS ANXIOUS.\r\n\r\n     _Lady, do you know the tune?\r\n     Ah, we all of us have hummed it!\r\n     I\'ve an old guitar has thrummed it\r\n     Under many a changing moon._\r\n                             THACKERAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Frank next saw Sidney Darrell, the latter told him that he had\r\nabandoned the idea of the "Cressida," and was painting Phyllis Lorimer\r\nin her own character.\r\n\r\n"Grey gown; Parma violets; grey and purplish background. Shall let Sir\r\nCoutts have it, I think," he added; "it will show up better at his place\r\nthan amid the _profanum vulgus_ of Burlington House."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Darrell doesn\'t often paint portraits, does he?" Lucy said, when\r\nJermyn was discussing the matter one evening in Baker Street.\r\n\r\n"Not often; but those that he has done are among his finest work. That\r\none of poor Lady Watergate for instance--it is Carolus Duran at his very\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"By the bye, what an incongruous friendship it always seems to me--Lord\r\nWatergate and Mr. Darrell," said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know that it\'s much of a friendship," answered Frank.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate often drops in at The Sycamores," put in Phyllis,\r\nhelping herself from a smart _bonbonni\xe8re_ from Charbonnel and Walker\'s;\r\nfor Sidney found many indirect means of paying his pretty model; "I\r\nthink he is such a nice old person."\r\n\r\n"Old," cried Fanny; "he is not old at all. I looked him out in Mr.\r\nDarrell\'s Peerage. He is thirty-seven, and his name is Ralph."\r\n\r\n"\'I love my love with an R..\' You said it just in that way, Fan,"\r\nlaughed Phyllis. "Yes, it is an odd friendship, if one comes to think of\r\nit--that big, kind, simple, Lord Watergate, and my elaborate friend,\r\nSidney."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Darrell is a perfect gentleman," interposed Fan, with dignity.\r\n\r\nThe occasional mornings at The Sycamores, afforded a pleasant break in\r\nthe monotony of her existence. Darrell treated her with a careful, if\r\nironical politeness, which she accepted in all good faith.\r\n\r\n"Fan, as they call her, is a fool, but none the worse for that," had\r\nbeen his brief summing up of the poor lady, whom, indeed, he rather\r\nliked than otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of May, and the sittings had been going on in a\r\nspasmodic, irregular fashion, throughout the month. Both the girls\r\nenjoyed them. Darrell, like the rest of the world, treated Phyllis as a\r\nspoilt child; gave her sweets and flowers galore; and what was better,\r\ntickets for concerts, galleries, and theatres, of which her sisters also\r\nreaped the benefit.\r\n\r\nGertrude secretly disliked the whole proceeding, but, aware that she had\r\nno reasonable objection to offer, wisely held her peace; telling herself\r\nthat if one person did not turn her little sister\'s head, another was\r\nsure to do so; and perhaps the sooner she was accustomed to the process\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n"Why won\'t you come up and see my portrait?" Phyllis had pleaded; "I am\r\ngoing next Sunday, so you can have no excuse."\r\n\r\n"I shall see it when it is finished," Gertrude had answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you can get a good idea of what it will look like, already. It\r\nis a great thing, life-size, and ends at about the knees. I am standing\r\nup and looking over my shoulder, so. I suppose Mr. Darrell has found out\r\nhow nicely my head turns round on my neck."\r\n\r\nGertrude had laughed, and even attempted a pun in her reply, but she did\r\nnot accompany her sister to The Sycamores. Indeed, more subtle reasons\r\napart, she had little time to spare for unnecessary outings.\r\n\r\nThe business, as businesses will, had taken a turn for the better, and\r\nthe two members of the partnership had their hands full. Rumours of the\r\nPhotographic Studio had somehow got abroad, and various branches of the\r\npublic were waking up to an interest in it.\r\n\r\nPeople who had theories about woman\'s work; people whose friends had\r\ntheories; people who were curious and fond of novelty; individuals from\r\neach of these sections began to find their way to Upper Baker Street.\r\nGertrude, as we know, had refused at an early stage of their career to\r\nbe interviewed by _The Waterloo Place Gazette_; but, later on, some\r\nunauthorised person wrote a little account of the Lorimers\' studio in\r\none of the society papers, of which, if the taste was questionable, the\r\nresults were not to be questioned at all.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it had got about in certain sets that all the sisters were\r\nextremely beautiful, and that Sidney Darrell was painting them in a\r\ngroup for next year\'s Academy, a _canard_ certainly not to deprecated\r\nfrom a business point of view.\r\n\r\nSuch things as these, do not, of course, make the solid basis of\r\nsuccess, but in a very overcrowded world, they are apt to be the most\r\nfrequent openings to it. In these days, the aspirant to fame is inclined\r\nto over-value them, forgetting that there is after all something to be\r\nsaid for making one\'s performance such as will stand the test of so much\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\nThe Lorimers knew little of the world, and of the workings of the\r\ncomplicated machinery necessary for getting on in it; and while chance\r\nfavoured them in the matter of gratuitous advertisement, devoted their\r\nenergies to keeping up their work to as high a standard as possible.\r\n\r\nLife, indeed, was opening up for them in more ways than one. The calling\r\nwhich they pursued brought them into contact with all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, among them, people in many ways more congenial to\r\nthem than the mass of their former acquaintance; intercourse with the\r\nlatter having come about in most cases through "juxtaposition" rather\r\nthan "affinity."\r\n\r\nThey began to get glimpses of a world more varied and interesting than\r\ntheir own, of that world of cultivated, middle-class London, which\r\napproached more nearly, perhaps, than any other to Gertrude\'s ideal\r\nsociety of picked individuals.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Gertrude, more than any of them, who appreciated the new\r\nstate of things. She was beginning, for the first time, to find her own\r\nlevel; to taste the sweets of genuine work and genuine social\r\nintercourse. Fastidious and sensitive as she was, she had yet a great\r\nfund of enjoyment of life within her; of that impersonal, objective\r\nenjoyment which is so often denied to her sex. Relieved of the pressing\r\nanxieties which had attended the beginning of their enterprise, the\r\nnatural elasticity of her spirits asserted itself. A common atmosphere\r\nof hope and cheerfulness pervaded the little household at Upper Baker\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe evening of which I write was one of the last of May, and Frank had\r\ncome in to bid them farewell, before setting out the next morning for a\r\nshort holiday in Cornwall; "the old folks," as he called his parents,\r\ngrowing impatient of their only son\'s prolonged absence.\r\n\r\n"The country will be looking its very best," cried Frank, who loved his\r\nbeautiful home; "the sea a mass of sapphire with the great downs rolling\r\ntowards it. I mean to have a big swim the very first thing. No one knows\r\nwhat the sea is like, till they have been to Cornwall. And St. Colomb--I\r\nwish you could see St. Colomb! Why, the whole place is smaller than\r\nBaker Street. The little bleak, grey street, with the sou\'wester blowing\r\nthrough it at all times and seasons--there are scarcely two houses on\r\nthe same level. And then--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "\'The little grey church on the windy hill,\'\r\n\r\n\r\nand beyond, the great green vicarage garden, and the vicarage, and the\r\ndear old folks looking out at the gate."\r\n\r\nHe rose reluctantly to go. "One day I hope you will see it for\r\nyourselves--all of you."\r\n\r\nWith which impersonal statement, delivered in a voice which rather\r\nbelied its impersonal nature, Frank dropped Lucy\'s hand, which he had\r\nbeen holding with unnecessary firmness, and departed abruptly from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked rather anxiously towards her sister, who sat quietly\r\nsewing, with a little smile on her lips. How far, she wondered, had\r\nmatters gone between Lucy and Frank? Was the happiness of either or both\r\nirrevocably engaged in the pretty game which they were playing? Heaven\r\nforbid that her sisterly solicitude should lead her to question the\r\n"intentions" of every man who came near them; a hideous feminine\r\npractice abhorrent to her very soul. Yet, their own position, Gertrude\r\nfelt, was a peculiar one, and she could not but be aware of the dangers\r\ninseparable from the freedom which they enjoyed; dangers which are the\r\nprice to be paid for all close intimacy between young men and women.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what do women know about a man, even when they live opposite\r\nhim? And do not men, the very best of them, allow themselves immense\r\nlicense in the matter of loving and riding away?\r\n\r\nAs for Frank, he never made the slightest pretence that the Lorimers\r\nenjoyed a monopoly of his regard. He talked freely of the charms of\r\nNellie and Carry and Emily; there was a certain Ethel, of South\r\nKensington, whose praises he was never weary of sounding. Moreover,\r\nthere could be no doubt that at one time or other he had displayed a\r\ngood deal of interest in Constance Devonshire; dancing with her half the\r\nnight, as Fred had expressed it; a mutual fitness in waltz-steps\r\nscarcely being enough to account for his attentions. And even supposing\r\na more serious element to have entered into his regard for Lucy, was he\r\nnot as poor as themselves, and was it not the last contingency for a\r\nprudent sister to desire?\r\n\r\n"What a calculating crone I am growing," thought Gertrude; then\r\nobserving the tranquil and busy object of her fears, laughed at herself,\r\nhalf ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Russel came to see them, and entered on a careful\r\nexamination of their accounts: compared the business of the last three\r\nmonths with that of the first; praised the improved quality of their\r\nwork, and strongly advised them, if it were possible, to hold on for\r\nanother year. This they were able to do. Although, of course, the money\r\ninvested in the business had returned anything but a high rate of\r\ninterest, their economy had been so strict that there would be enough of\r\ntheir original funds to enable them to carry on the struggle for the\r\nnext twelve months, by which time, if matters progressed at their\r\npresent rate, they might consider themselves permanently established in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBefore he went Mr. Russel said something to Lucy which disturbed her\r\nconsiderably, though it made her smile. He had been for many years a\r\nwidower, living with his mother, but the old lady had died in the course\r\nof the year, and now he suggested, modestly enough, that Lucy should\r\nreturn as mistress to the home where she had once been a welcome guest.\r\n\r\nThe girl found it difficult to put her refusal into words; this kind\r\nfriend had hitherto given everything and asked nothing; but there was a\r\ndelicate soul under the brusque exterior, and directly he divined how\r\nmatters stood, he did his best to save her compunction.\r\n\r\n"It really doesn\'t matter, you know. Please don\'t give it another\r\nthought." He had observed in an off-hand manner, which had amused while\r\nit touched her.\r\n\r\nLucy was magnanimous enough to keep this little episode to herself,\r\nthough Gertrude had her suspicions as to what had occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nA ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n     _When strawberry pottles are common and cheap\r\n       Ere elms be black or limes be sere,\r\n     When midnight dances are murdering sleep,\r\n       Then comes in the sweet o\' the year!_\r\n                                      ANDREW LANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second week in June saw Frank back in his old quarters above the\r\nauctioneer\'s. He had arrived late in the evening, and put off going to\r\nsee the Lorimers till the first thing the next day. It was some time\r\nbefore business hours when he rang at Number 20B, and was ushered by\r\nMatilda into the studio, where he found Phyllis engaged in a rather\r\nperfunctory wielding of a feather-duster.\r\n\r\nShe was looking distractingly pretty, as he perceived when she turned\r\nto greet him. Her close-fitting black dress, with the spray of tuberose\r\nat the throat, and the great holland apron with its braided bib suited\r\nher to perfection; the sober tints setting off to advantage the delicate\r\ntones of her complexion, which in these days was more wonderfully pink\r\nand white than ever.\r\n\r\n"And how are your sisters? I needn\'t ask how you are?" cried Frank, who\r\nin the earlier stages of their acquaintance had been rather surprised at\r\nhimself for not falling desperately in love with Phyllis Lorimer.\r\n\r\n"Everybody is flourishing," she answered, leaning against the little\r\nmantelshelf in the waiting-room, and looking down upon Frank\'s sunburnt,\r\nuplifted face.\r\n\r\nA look of mischief flashed into her eyes as she added, "There is a great\r\npiece of news."\r\n\r\nFrank grasped the back of the frail red chair on which he sat astride in\r\na manner rather dangerous to its well-being, and said abruptly, "Well,\r\nwhat is it?"\r\n\r\n"One of us is going to be married."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Frank, with a sort of gasp, which was not lost on his\r\ninterlocutor.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to tell you which it is. You must guess," went on\r\nPhyllis, looking down upon him demurely from under her drooped lids,\r\nwhile a fine smile played about her lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll begin at the beginning," said poor Frank, with rather strained\r\ncheerfulness. "Is it Miss Gertrude?"\r\n\r\nPhyllis played a moment with the feather-duster, then answered slowly,\r\n"You must guess again."\r\n\r\n"Is it Miss Lucy?" (with a jerk.)\r\n\r\nA pause. "No," said Phyllis, at last.\r\n\r\nFrank sprang to his feet with a beaming countenance and caught both her\r\nhands with unfeigned cordiality. "Then it is you, Miss Phyllis, that I\r\nhave to congratulate."\r\n\r\nHer eyes twinkled with suppressed mirth as she answered ruefully, "No,\r\nindeed, Mr. Jermyn!"\r\n\r\nFrank dropped her hands, wrinkling his brows in perplexity, then a light\r\ndawned on him suddenly, and was reflected in his expressive countenance.\r\n\r\n"It must be Fan!" He forgot the prefix in his astonishment.\r\n\r\nPhyllis nodded. "But you musn\'t look so surprised," she said, taking a\r\nchair beside him. "Why shouldn\'t poor old Fan be married as well as\r\nother people?"\r\n\r\n"Of course; how stupid of me not to think of it before," said Frank,\r\nvaguely.\r\n\r\n"It is quite a romance," went on Phyllis; "she and Mr. Marsh wanted to\r\nbe married ages and ages ago. But he was too poor, and went to\r\nAustralia. Now he is well off, and has come back to marry Fan, like a\r\nperson in a book. A touching tale of young love, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think it a very touching and pretty story," said Frank, severely\r\nignoring the note of irony in her voice.\r\n\r\nHe had all a man\'s dislike to hearing a woman talk cynically of\r\nsentiment; that should be exclusively a masculine privilege.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Phyllis, "it takes the bloom off it a little, that\r\nEdward Marsh married on the way out. But his wife died last year, so it\r\nis all right."\r\n\r\nFrank burst out laughing, Phyllis joining him. A minute later Gertrude\r\nand Lucy came in and confirmed the wonderful news; and the four young\r\npeople stood gossiping, till the sound of the studio bell reminded them\r\nthat the day\'s work had begun.\r\n\r\nJermyn came in, by invitation, to supper that night, and was introduced\r\nto the new arrival, a big, burly man of middle age, whose forest of\r\nblack beard afforded only very occasional glimpses of his face.\r\n\r\nAs for Fanny, it was touching to see how this faded flower had revived\r\nin the sunshine. The little superannuated airs and graces had come\r\nboldly into play; and Edward Marsh, who was a simple soul, accepted them\r\nas the proper expression of feminine sweetness.\r\n\r\nSo she curled her little finger and put her head on one side with all\r\nthe vigour that assurance of success will give to any performance; gave\r\nvent to her most illogical statements in her most mincing tones,\r\nuncontradicted and undisturbed; in short, took advantage to the full of\r\nher sojourn (to quote George Eliot) in "the woman\'s paradise where all\r\nher nonsense is adorable."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what those girls will do without me," Fanny said to her\r\nlover, who took the remark in such good faith as to make her believe in\r\nit herself; "we must see that we do not settle too far away from them."\r\n\r\nAnd she delicately set a stitch in the bead-work slipper which she was\r\nengaged in "grounding" for the simple-hearted Edward.\r\n\r\nFanny patronised her sisters a good deal in these days; and it must be\r\nowned--such is the nature of woman--that her importance had gone up\r\nconsiderably in their estimation.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Marsh, he regarded his future relatives with a mixture of\r\nalarm and perplexity that secretly delighted them. Never for a moment\r\ndid his allegiance to Fanny falter before their superior charms; never\r\nfor a moment did the fear of such a contingency disturb poor Fanny\'s\r\npeace of mind.\r\n\r\nOnly the girls themselves, in the depths of their hearts, wondered a\r\nlittle at finding themselves regarded with about the same amount of\r\npersonal interest as was accorded to Matilda, by no means a specimen of\r\nthe sparkling _soubrette_.\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had rather feared the effect of the contrast of Fanny\'s\r\nfaded charms with the youthful prettiness of the two younger girls, was\r\nrelieved, and at the same time a little indignant, to perceive that, as\r\nfar as Edward Marsh was concerned, Phyllis\'s hair might be red and\r\nLucy\'s eyes a brilliant green.\r\n\r\nFor once, indeed, Fan\'s tactlessness had succeeded where the finest\r\ntact might have failed. In dropping at once into position as the Fanny\r\nof ten years ago; as the incarnation of all that is sweetest and most\r\nessentially feminine in woman; in making of herself an accepted and\r\nindisputable fact, she had unconsciously done the very best to secure\r\nher own happiness.\r\n\r\n"There really is something about Fanny that pleases men. I have always\r\nsaid so," Phyllis remarked, as she watched the lovers sailing blissfully\r\ndown Baker Street, on one of their many house-hunting expeditions.\r\n\r\n"You know," added Lucy, "she always dislikes walking about alone,\r\nbecause people speak to her. No one ever speaks to us, do they, Gerty?"\r\n\r\n"Nor to me--at least, not often," said Phyllis, ruefully.\r\n\r\n"Phyllis, will you never learn where to draw the line?" cried Gertrude;\r\n"but it is quite true about Fan. She must be that mysterious creature, a\r\nman\'s woman."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Darrell likes her," broke forth Phyllis, after a pause; "he laughs\r\nat her in that quiet way of his, but I am quite sure that he likes her.\r\nI hope," she added, "that she won\'t get married before my portrait is\r\nfinished. But it wouldn\'t matter, I could go without a chaperon."\r\n\r\n"No, you couldn\'t," said Gertrude, shortly.\r\n\r\n"Why are you seized with such notions of propriety all of a sudden?"\r\n\r\n"I have no wish to put us to a disadvantage by ignoring the ordinary\r\npractices of life."\r\n\r\n"Then put up the shutters and get rid of the lease. But, Gerty, we\r\nneedn\'t discuss this unpleasant matter yet awhile. By the by, Mr.\r\nDarrell is going to ask me to sit for him in a picture, after the\r\nportrait. He has made sketches for it already--something out of one of\r\nShakespeare\'s plays."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am tired of Mr. Darrell\'s name. Go and see that your dress is in\r\norder for the Devonshires\' dance to-night."\r\n\r\n"_Apropos_," said Lucy, as Phyllis flitted off on the congenial errand,\r\n"why is it that we never see anything of Conny in these days?"\r\n\r\n"She is going out immensely this season," answered Gertrude, dropping\r\nher eye-lids; "but, at any rate, we get a double allowance of Fred to\r\ncompensate."\r\n\r\n"Silly boy," cried Lucy, flushing slightly, "he has actually made me\r\npromise to sit out two dances with him. Such waste, when one is dying\r\nfor a waltz."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there will be plenty of waltzing. I wish you could have my share,"\r\nsighed Gertrude, who had been won over by Conny\'s entreaties to promise\r\nattendance at the dance that night.\r\n\r\n"It is time you left off these patriarchal airs, Gerty. You are as fond\r\nof dancing as any of us; and I mean you to spin round all night like a\r\nteetotum."\r\n\r\n"What a charming picture you conjure up, Lucy."\r\n\r\n"You people with imaginations are always finding fault. Fortunately for\r\nme, I have no imagination, and very little humour," said Lucy, with an\r\nair of genuine thankfulness that delighted her sister.\r\n\r\nThus, with work and play, and very much gossip, the summer days went by.\r\nThe three girls found life full and pleasant, and Fanny had her little\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nLUCY.\r\n\r\n     _Who is Silvia? What is she,\r\n     That all our swains commend her?_\r\n              TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the situation. At one of the red-legged tables\r\nsat Fred, his arms spread out before him, his face hidden in his arms;\r\nwhile Lucy, with a troubled face, stood near, struggling between her\r\ngenuine compunction and an irrepressible desire to laugh.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning; the rest of the household were at church, and the\r\ntwo young people had had the studio to themselves without fear of\r\ndisturbance; a circumstance of which the unfortunate Fred had hastened\r\nto avail himself, thereby rushing on his fate.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached that stage of the proceedings when the rejected\r\nsuitor, finding entreaty of no avail, has recourse to manifestations of\r\ndespair and reproach.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t have encouraged a fellow all these years," came hoarsely\r\nfrom between the arms and face of the prostrate swain.\r\n\r\n"\'All these years!\' how can you be so silly, Fred?" cried Lucy, with\r\nsome asperity. "Why, I shall be accused next of encouraging little Jack\r\nOakley, because I bowled his hoop round Regent\'s Park for him last\r\nweek."\r\n\r\nLucy did not mean to be unkind; but the really unexpected avowal from\r\nher old playmate had made her nervous; a refusal to treat it seriously\r\nseemed to her the best course to pursue. But her last words, as might\r\nhave been supposed, were too much for poor Fred. Up he sprang, "a\r\nwounded thing with a rancorous cry"--\r\n\r\n"There is another fellow!"\r\n\r\nBack started Lucy, as if she had been shot. The hot blood surged up into\r\nher face, the tears rose to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?" she cried, stung suddenly to cruelty;\r\n"what has that to do with it, when, if you were the only man in the\r\nworld, I would not marry you?"\r\n\r\nFred, hurt and shocked by this unexpected attack from gentle Lucy,\r\ngathered himself up with something more like dignity than he had\r\ndisplayed in the course of the interview.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," he said, taking up his hat; "perhaps one of these days\r\nyou will be sorry for what you have done. I\'m not much, I know, but you\r\nwon\'t find many people to care for you as I would have cared." His voice\r\nbroke suddenly, and he made his way rather blindly to the door.\r\n\r\nLucy was trembling all over, and as pale as, a moment ago, she had been\r\nred. She wanted to say something, as she watched him fumbling unsteadily\r\nwith the door-handle; but her lips refused to frame the words.\r\n\r\nWithout lifting his head he passed into the little passage. Lucy heard\r\nhis retreating footsteps, then her eye fell on a roll of newspapers at\r\nher feet. She picked them up hastily.\r\n\r\n"Fred," she cried, "you have forgotten these."\r\n\r\nBut he vouchsafed no answer, and in another moment she heard the outer\r\ndoor shut.\r\n\r\nShe stood a moment with the ridiculous bundle in her hand--_Tit-Bits_\r\nand a pink, crushed copy of _The Sporting Times_--then something between\r\na laugh and a sob rose in her throat, the papers fell to the ground, and\r\nsinking on her knees by the table, she buried her face in her hands and\r\nburst into bitter weeping.\r\n\r\nGertrude, coming in from church some ten minutes later, found her sister\r\nthus prostrate.\r\n\r\nThe sight unnerved her from its very unusualness; bending over Lucy she\r\nwhispered, "Am I to go away?"\r\n\r\n"No, stop here."\r\n\r\nGertrude locked the door, then came and knelt by her sister.\r\n\r\n"Oh, poor Fred, and I was so horrid to him," wept the penitent.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I was afraid it would come."\r\n\r\nGertrude stroked the prone, smooth head; she feared that the thought of\r\nsome one else besides Fred lay at the bottom of all this disturbance.\r\nShe was very anxious for Lucy in these days; very anxious and very\r\nhelpless. There was only one person, she knew too well, who could\r\nrestore to Lucy her old sweet serenity, and he, alas, made no sign.\r\n\r\nWhat was she to think? One thing was clear enough; the old pleasant\r\nrelationship between themselves and Frank was at an end; if renewed at\r\nall, it must be renewed on a different basis. A disturbing element, an\r\nelement of self-consciousness had crept into it; the delicate charm, the\r\nfirst bloom of simplicity, had departed for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of July, and for the last week or two they had\r\nseen scarcely anything of Jermyn, beyond the glimpses of him as he\r\nlounged up the street, with his sombrero crushed over his eyes, all the\r\nimpetuosity gone from his gait.\r\n\r\nThat he distinctly avoided them, there could be little doubt. Though he\r\nwas to be seen looking across at the house wistfully enough, he made no\r\nattempt to see them, and his greetings when they chanced to meet were of\r\nthe most formal nature.\r\n\r\nThe change in his conduct had been so marked and sudden, that it was\r\nimpossible that it should escape observation. Fanny, with an air of\r\nsuperior knowledge, gave it out as her belief that Mr. Jermyn was in\r\nlove; Phyllis held to the opinion that he had been fired with the idea\r\nof a big picture, and was undergoing the throes of artistic conception;\r\nGertrude said lightly, that she supposed he was out of sorts and\r\ndisinclined for society; while Lucy held her peace, and indulged in many\r\ninward sophistries to convince herself that her own unusual restlessness\r\nand languor had nothing to do with their neighbour\'s disaffection.\r\n\r\nIt was these carefully woven self-deceptions that had been so rudely\r\nscattered by Fred\'s words; and Lucy, kneeling by the scarlet table, had\r\nfor the first time looked her fate in the face, and diagnosed her own\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n"Lucy," said Gertrude, after a pause, "bathe your eyes and come for a\r\nwalk in the Park; there is time before lunch."\r\n\r\nLucy rose, drying her wet face with her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Let me look at you," cried Gertrude. "What is the charm? Where does it\r\nlie? Why are these sort of things always happening to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," answered Lucy, with an attempt at a smile, "I am a convenient,\r\nmiddling sort of person, that is all. Not uncomfortably clever like you,\r\nor uncomfortably pretty like Phyllis."\r\n\r\nThe two girls set off up the hot dusty street, with its Sunday odour of\r\nbad tobacco. Regent\'s Park wore its most unattractive garb; a dead\r\nmonotony of July verdure assailed the eye; a verdure, moreover,\r\nimpregnated and coated with the dust and soot of the city. The girls\r\nfelt listless and dispirited, and conscious that their walk was turning\r\nout a failure.\r\n\r\nAs they passed through Clarence Gate, on their way back, Frank darted\r\npast them with something of his normal activity, lifting his hat with\r\nsomething like the old smile.\r\n\r\n"He might have stopped," said Lucy, pale to the lips, and suddenly\r\nabandoning all pretence of concealment of her feelings.\r\n\r\n"No doubt he is in a hurry;" answered Gertrude, lamely. "I daresay he is\r\ngoing to lunch in Sussex Place. Lord Watergate\'s Sunday luncheon parties\r\nare quite celebrated."\r\n\r\nThe day dragged on. The weather was sultry and every one felt depressed.\r\nFanny was spending the day with relations of her future husband\'s; but\r\nthe three girls had no engagements and lounged away the afternoon rather\r\ndismally at home.\r\n\r\nAll were relieved when Fanny and Mr. Marsh came in at supper-time, and\r\nthey seated themselves at the table with alacrity. They had not\r\nproceeded far with the meal, when footsteps, unexpected but familiar,\r\nwere heard ascending the staircase; then some one knocked, and before\r\nthere was time to reply, the door was thrown open to admit Frank Jermyn.\r\n\r\nHe looked curiously unlike himself as he advanced and shook hands amid\r\nan uncomfortable silence that everybody desired to break. His face was\r\npale, and no longer moody, but tense and eager, with shining eyes and\r\ndilated nostrils.\r\n\r\n"You will stay to supper, Mr. Jermyn?" said Gertrude, at last, in her\r\nmost neutral tones.\r\n\r\n"Yes, please." Frank drew a chair to the table like a person in a dream.\r\n\r\n"You are quite a stranger," cried arch, unconscious Fan, indicating with\r\nhead and spoon the dish from which she proposed to serve him.\r\n\r\nFrank nodded acceptance of the proffered fare, but ignored her remark.\r\n\r\nSilence fell again upon the party, broken by murmurs from the enamoured\r\nEdward, and the ostentatious clatter of knives and forks on the part of\r\npeople who were not eating. Every one, except the plighted lovers, felt\r\nthat there was electricity in the air.\r\n\r\nAt last Frank dropped his fork, abandoning, once for all, the pretence\r\nof supper.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lucy," he cried across the table to her, "I have a piece of news."\r\n\r\nShe looked up, pale, with steady eyes, questioning him.\r\n\r\n"I am going abroad to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, where are you going?" cried Fanny, vaguely mystified.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Africa."\r\n\r\nHe did not move his eyes from Lucy as he spoke; her head had drooped\r\nover her plate. "They are sending me out as special from _The Woodcut_,\r\nin the place of poor Leadpoint, who has died of fever. I heard the first\r\nof it last night, and this morning it was finally settled. It makes,"\r\ncried Frank, "an immense difference in my prospects."\r\n\r\nEdward Marsh, who objected to Frank as a spoilt puppy, always expecting\r\nother people to be interested in his affairs, asked the young man\r\nbluntly the value of his appointment. But he met with no reply; for\r\nFrank, his face alight, had sprung to his feet, pushing back his chair.\r\n\r\n"Lucy, Lucy," he cried in a low voice, "won\'t you come and speak to me?"\r\n\r\nLucy rose like one mesmerised; took, with a presence of mind at which\r\nshe afterwards laughed, the key of the studio from its nail, and\r\nfollowed Frank from the room, amidst the stupefaction of the rest of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt was a sufficiently simple explanation which took place, some minutes\r\nlater, in the very room where, a few hours before, poor Fred had\r\nreceived his dismissal.\r\n\r\n"But why," said Lucy, presently, "have you been so unkind for the last\r\nfortnight?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lucy," answered Frank; "you women so often misjudge us, and think\r\nthat it is you alone who suffer, when the pain is on both sides. When it\r\ndawned upon me how things stood with you and me--dear girl, you told me\r\nmore than you knew yourself--I reflected what a poor devil I was, with\r\nnot the ghost of a prospect. (I have been down on my luck lately,\r\nLucy.) And I saw, at the same time, how it was with Devonshire; I\r\nthought, he is a good fellow, let him have his chance, it may be best in\r\nthe end----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, Frank, what did you think of me? If these are men\'s\r\narguments I am glad that I am a woman," cried Lucy, clinging to the\r\nstrong young hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, so am I, for that matter," answered Frank; and then, of course,\r\nthough I do not uphold her conduct in this respect, Lucy told him\r\nbriefly of Fred Devonshire\'s offer and her own refusal.\r\n\r\nIt was late before these two happy people returned to the sitting-room,\r\nto receive congratulations on the event, which, by this time, it was\r\nunnecessary to impart.\r\n\r\nFanny wondered aloud why she had not thought of such a thing before; and\r\nfelt, perhaps, that her own _rechauff\xe9_ love affair was quite thrown\r\ninto the shade. Phyllis smiled and made airy jests, submitting her soft\r\ncheek gracefully to a brotherly kiss.\r\n\r\nEdward Marsh looked on mystified and rather shocked, and Gertrude\r\nremained in the background, with a heart too full for speech, till the\r\nlovers made their way to her, demanding her congratulations.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think me too unworthy," said Frank, in all humility.\r\n\r\n"I am glad," she said.\r\n\r\nGlancing up and seeing the two young faces, aglow with the light of\r\ntheir happiness, she looked back with a wistful amusement on her own\r\ndoubts and fears of the past weeks.\r\n\r\nAs she did so, the beautiful, familiar words flashed across her\r\nconsciousness--\r\n\r\n"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate that night, when the guests had departed and the rest of the\r\nhousehold was asleep, Gertrude heard Lucy moving about in the room\r\nbelow, and, throwing on her dressing-gown, went down stairs. She found\r\nher sister risen from the table, where she had been writing a letter by\r\nthe lamp-light.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you coming to bed, Lucy? Remember, you have to be up very\r\nearly."\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the coming separation, which at first had only seemed to\r\ngive a more exquisite quality to her happiness, lay on Lucy. She was\r\npale, and her steadfast eyes looked out with the old calm, but with a\r\nnew intensity, from her face.\r\n\r\n"Read this," she said, "it seemed only fair."\r\n\r\nStooping over the table, Gertrude read--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "DEAR FRED,--I am engaged to Frank Jermyn, who goes abroad\r\n     to-morrow. I am sorry if I seemed unkind, but I was grieved and\r\n     shocked by what you said to me. Very soon, when you have quite\r\n     forgiven me, you will come and see us all, will you not?\r\n     Acknowledge that you made a mistake, and never cease to regard me\r\n     as your friend.--L. L."\r\n\r\n\r\nGertrude thought: "Then I shall not have to tell Conny, after all."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\n\r\n     _Beauty like hers is genius._\r\n                  D. G. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy slept little that night. At the first flush of the magnificent\r\nsummer dawn she was astir, making her preparations for the traveller\'s\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nShe had changed suddenly, from a demure and rather frigid maiden to a\r\nloving and anxious woman. Perhaps the signet-ring on her middle finger\r\nwas a magic ring, and had wrought the charm.\r\n\r\nFrank\'s notice to quit had been so short, that he had been obliged to\r\napply for various necessaries to Darrell, who, with Lord Watergate, had\r\nsupplied him with the main features of a tropical outfit. His ship\r\nsailed that day, at noon, so there was little time to be lost. He came\r\nover at an unconscionably early hour to Number 20B, for there was much\r\nto be said and little opportunity for saying it.\r\n\r\nLucy, displaying a truly feminine mixture of the tender and the\r\npractical, packed his bag, strapped his rugs, and put searching\r\nquestions as to his preparations for travel. Already, womanlike, she had\r\ntaken him under her wing, and henceforward the minutest detail of his\r\nexistence would be more precious to her than anything on earth.\r\n\r\nGertrude, when she had kissed the vivid young face in sisterly farewell,\r\nsaw the lovers drive off to the station and wondered inwardly at their\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, coming into the studio, she found Lucy quietly engaged\r\nin putting a negative into the printing-frame.\r\n\r\n"It is his," she said, looking up with a smile; "I never felt that I had\r\na right to do it before."\r\n\r\nAt luncheon, Phyllis reminded her that to-night was the night of Mr.\r\nDarrell\'s _conversazione_ at the Berkeley Galleries, for which he had\r\nsent them two tickets.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good expecting Lucy to go; you will have to take me, Gerty,"\r\nshe announced.\r\n\r\nGertrude had a great dislike to going, and she said--\r\n\r\n"Can\'t Fanny take you?"\r\n\r\n"Edward and I are dining at the Septimus Pratts\'," replied Fanny.\r\n\r\nAfter much hesitation, she and her betrothed had had to resign\r\nthemselves to the inevitable, and dispense with the services of a\r\nchaperon; a breach of decorum which Mr. Marsh, in particular, deplored.\r\n\r\n"Are you very anxious about this party?" pleaded Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Oh Gerty, of course. And if you won\'t take me, I\'ll go alone," cried\r\nPhyllis, with unusual vehemence.\r\n\r\nGertrude was indignant at her sister\'s tone; then reflected that it was,\r\nperhaps, hard on Phyllis, to cut off one of her few festivities.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, indeed, had not been very well of late, and demanded more\r\nspoiling than ever. She coughed constantly, and her eyes were\r\nunnaturally bright.\r\n\r\nGertrude ended by submitting to the sacrifice, and at ten o\'clock she\r\nand Phyllis found themselves in Bond Street, where the rooms were\r\nalready thronged with people.\r\n\r\nPhyllis had blazed into a degree of beauty that startled even her\r\nsister, and made her the frequent mark for observation in that brilliant\r\ngathering.\r\n\r\nHer grey dress was cut low, displaying the white and rounded slenderness\r\nof her shoulders and arms; the soft brown hair was coiled about the\r\nperfect head in a manner that afforded a view of the neck and its\r\ngraceful action; her eyes shone like stars; her cheeks glowed\r\nexquisitely pink. Wherever she went, went forth a sweet strong\r\nfragrance, the breath of a great spray of tuberose which was fastened in\r\nher bodice, and which had arrived for her that day from an unnamed\r\ndonor.\r\n\r\nDarrell\'s greeting to both the sisters had been of the briefest. He had\r\nshaken hands unsmilingly with Phyllis; he and Gertrude had brought their\r\nfinger-tips into chill and momentary contact, without so much as lifting\r\ntheir eyes, and Gertrude had felt humiliated at her presence there.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen Darrell since his Private View, more than six weeks\r\nago; and now, as she stood talking to Lord Watergate, her eye, guided by\r\na nameless curiosity, an unaccountable fascination, sought him out. He\r\nwas looking ill, she thought, as she watched him standing in his host\'s\r\nplace, near the doorway, chatting to an ugly old woman, whom she knew to\r\nbe the Duchess of Kilburne; ill, and very unhappy. Happiness indeed, as\r\nshe instinctively felt, is not for such as he--for the egotist and the\r\nsensualist.\r\n\r\nHer acute feminine sense, sharpened perhaps by personal soreness, had\r\npierced to the second-rateness of the man and his art. Beneath his\r\narrogance and air of assured success, she read the signs of an almost\r\ncraven hunger for pre-eminence; of a morbid self-consciousness; an\r\ninsatiable vanity. And for all the stupendous cleverness of his\r\nworkmanship, she failed to detect in his work the traces of those\r\nqualities which, combined with far less skill than his, can make\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nAs for her own relations to Darrell, the positions of the two had\r\nshifted a little since the first. In the brief flashes of intercourse\r\nwhich they had known, a drama had silently enacted itself; a war\r\nwithout words or weapons, in which, so far, she had come off victor. For\r\nSidney had ceased to regard her as merely ridiculous; and she, on her\r\npart, was no longer cowed by his aggressive personality, by the\r\nall-seeing, languid glance, the arrogant, indifferent manner. They stood\r\non a level platform of unspoken, yet open distaste; which, should\r\noccasion arise, might blaze into actual defiance.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, as I have said, was talking to Gertrude; but his glance,\r\nas she was quick to observe, strayed constantly toward Phyllis. She had\r\nwondered before this, as to the measure of his admiration for her\r\nsister; it seemed to her that he paid her the tribute of a deeper\r\ninterest than that which her beauty and her brightness would, in the\r\nnatural course of things, exact.\r\n\r\nAs for Phyllis, she was enjoying a triumph which many a professional\r\nbeauty might have envied. People flocked round her, scheming for\r\nintroductions, staring at her in open admiration, laughing at her\r\nwhimsical sallies.\r\n\r\n"That young person has a career before her."\r\n\r\n"Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, one of Darrell\'s discoveries. Works at a photographer\'s, they say."\r\n\r\n"Darrell is painting her portrait."\r\n\r\n"No, not her portrait; but a study of \'Cressida.\'"\r\n\r\n"Cressida!\r\n\r\n\r\n     "\'There\'s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;\r\n     Nay, her foot speaks----\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush!"\r\n\r\nSuch floating spars of talk had drifted past Gertrude\'s corner, and had\r\nbeen caught, not by her, but by her companion.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate frowned, as he mentally finished the quotation, which\r\nstruck him as being in shocking taste. He had adopted, unconsciously, a\r\nprotective attitude towards the Lorimers; their courage, their\r\nfearlessness, their immense ignorance, appealed to his generous and\r\nchivalrous nature. He made up his mind to speak to Darrell about that\r\nbaseless rumour of the Cressida.\r\n\r\nGertrude, on her part, was not too absorbed in conversation to notice\r\nwhat her sister was doing. She saw at once that, in spite of some\r\nthrills of satisfied vanity, Phyllis was not enjoying herself. There was\r\na restless, discontented light in her eyes, a half-weary recklessness in\r\nher pose, as she leant against the edge of a tall screen, which filled\r\nGertrude with wonder and anxiety. She felt, as she had felt so often\r\nlately, that Phyllis, her little Phyllis, whom she had scolded and\r\npetted and yearned over for eighteen years, was passing beyond her ken,\r\ninto regions where she could never follow.\r\n\r\nThe evening wore itself away as such evenings do, in aimless drifting to\r\nand fro, half-hearted attempts at conversation, much mutual staring, and\r\na determined raid on the refreshment buffet, on the part of people who\r\nhave dined sumptuously an hour ago.\r\n\r\n"Our English social institutions," Darrell said aside to Lord Watergate;\r\n"the private view, where every one goes; the _conversazione_, where no\r\none talks."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate laughed, and went back to Gertrude, to propose an attack\r\non the buffet, by way of diversion; and Sidney, with his inscrutable air\r\nof utter purposelessness, made his way through the crowd to where\r\nPhyllis stood in conversation with two young men.\r\n\r\nSome paces off from her he paused, and stood in silence, looking at her.\r\n\r\nPhyllis shot her glance to his, half-petulant, half-supplicating, like\r\nthat of a child.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening, and this was the first attempt he had made\r\nto approach her. Darrell advanced a step or two, and Phyllis lowered her\r\neyes, with a sudden and vivid blush.\r\n\r\n"At last," said Darrell, in a low voice, as the two young men\r\ninstinctively moved off before him.\r\n\r\n"You are just in time to say \'good-night\' to me, Mr. Darrell."\r\n\r\nDarrell smiled, with his face close to hers. His smile was considered\r\nattractive--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "Seeming more generous for the coldness gone."\r\n\r\n\r\n"It is not \'good-night,\' but \'good-bye,\' that I have come to say."\r\n\r\nThe brilliant and rapid smile had passed across his face, leaving no\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Mr. Darrell?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that I am going away to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"For ever and ever?" Phyllis laughed, as she spoke, turning pale.\r\n\r\n"For several months. I have important business in Paris."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t finished my portrait, Mr. Darrell."\r\n\r\nSidney looked down, biting his lip.\r\n\r\n"Shall you be able to finish it in time for the Grosvenor?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly not."\r\n\r\n"Now you are disagreeable," cried Phyllis, in a high voice; "and\r\nungrateful, too, after all those long sittings."\r\n\r\n"Not ungrateful. Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Under cover of the\r\ncrowd he had taken both her hands, and was pressing them fiercely at\r\neach repetition, while his miserable eyes looked imploringly into hers.\r\n\r\n"You are hurting me." Her voice was low and broken. She shrank back\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye--Phyllis."\r\n\r\nGertrude, coming back from the refreshment-room a minute later, found\r\nPhyllis standing by herself, in an angle formed by one of the screens,\r\npale to the lips, with brilliant, meaningless eyes.\r\n\r\n"We are going home," said Gertrude, walking up to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," she answered, rousing herself; "the sooner the better.\r\nI am not well." She put her hand to her side. "I had that pain again\r\nthat I used to have."\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, who stood a little apart, watching her, came forward and\r\ngave her his arm, and they all three went from the room.\r\n\r\nIn the cab Phyllis recovered something of her wonted vivacity.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a nuisance," she said, "Mr. Darrell is going away for a long\r\ntime, and doesn\'t know when he will be able to finish my portrait."\r\n\r\nGertrude started.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose you always knew that he was an erratic person."\r\n\r\n"You speak as if you were pleased, Gerty. I am very disappointed."\r\n\r\n"Put not your trust in princes, Phyllis, nor in fashionable artists, who\r\nare rather more important than princes, in these days," answered\r\nGertrude, secretly hoping that their relations with Darrell would never\r\nbe renewed. "He has tired of his whim," she thought, indignant, yet\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon opened the door to them herself.\r\n\r\nPhyllis shuddered as they went upstairs. "That bird of ill-omen!" she\r\ncried, beneath her breath.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mrs. Maryon. How can you be so silly?" said Gertrude, who herself\r\nhad noted the long and earnest glance which the woman had cast on her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting-room they found Lucy sewing peacefully by the lamplight.\r\n\r\n"You hardly went to bed at all last night; you shouldn\'t be sitting up,"\r\nsaid Gertrude, throwing off her cloak; while Phyllis carefully detached\r\nthe knot of tuberose from her bodice, as she delivered herself for the\r\nsecond time of her grievance.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, going up to the mantelpiece, she placed the flowers in a\r\nslender Venetian vase, its crystal flecked with flakes of gold, which\r\nDarrell had given her; took the vase in her hand, and swept upstairs\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what to think about Phyllis," said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"You are afraid that she is too much interested in Mr. Darrell?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"She does not care two straws for him," said Lucy, with the conviction\r\nof one who knows; "her vanity is hurt, but I am not sure that that will\r\nbe bad for her."\r\n\r\n"He is the sort of person to attract----" began Gertrude; but Lucy\r\nstruck in--\r\n\r\n"Why, Gerty, what are you thinking of? he must be forty at least; and\r\nPhyllis is a child."\r\n\r\nSomething in her tones recalled to Gertrude that clarion-blast of\r\ntriumph, in the wonderful lyric--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "Oh, my love, my love is young!"\r\n\r\n\r\n"At any rate," she said, as they prepared to retire, "I am thankful that\r\nthe sittings are at an end. Phyllis was getting her head turned. She is\r\nlooking shockingly unwell, moreover, and I shall persuade her to accept\r\nthe Devonshires\' invitation for next month."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA WEDDING.\r\n\r\n     _A human heart should beat for two,\r\n       Whate\'er may say your single scorners;\r\n     And all the hearths I ever knew\r\n       Had got a pair of chimney-corners._\r\n                    F. LOCKER: London Lyrics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, at about six o\'clock, just as they had gone upstairs from\r\nthe studio, Constance Devonshire was announced, and came sailing in, in\r\nher smartest attire, and with her most gracious smile on her face.\r\n\r\n"I have come to offer my congratulations," she cried, going up to Lucy;\r\n"you know, I have always thought little Mr. Jermyn a nice person."\r\n\r\nLucy laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have brought your congratulations in person, Conny. I\r\nrather expected you would tell your coachman to leave cards at the\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\nConny turned away her face abruptly.\r\n\r\n"What is the good of coming to see such busy people as you have been\r\nlately?... And with so much love-making going on at the same time! What\r\ndoes Mrs. Maryon think of it all?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she finds it very tame and hackneyed, I am afraid."\r\n\r\n"You see," added Phyllis, who lounged idly in an arm-chair by the\r\nwindow, pale but sprightly, "the course of true love runs so\r\nmonotonously smooth in this household. And Mrs. Maryon has a taste for\r\nthe dramatic."\r\n\r\nConny laughed; and at this point the door was thrown open to admit Aunt\r\nCaroline, whose fixed and rigid smile was intended to show that she was\r\nin a gracious mood, and was accepted by the girls as a signal of truce.\r\n\r\n"What is this a little bird tells me, Lucy?" she cried archly, for Mrs.\r\nPratt shared the liking of her sex for matters matrimonial.\r\n\r\nFanny, who was, in fact, none other than the little bird who had broken\r\nthe news, put her head on one side in unconsciously avine fashion, and\r\nsmiled benevolently at her sister.\r\n\r\n"I am engaged to Mr. Jermyn," said Lucy, her clear voice lingering\r\nproudly over the words.\r\n\r\nConny winced suddenly; then turned to gaze through the window at the\r\nblank casements above the auctioneer\'s shop.\r\n\r\n"Then you have found out who Mr. Jermyn _is_?" went on Aunt Caroline,\r\nstill in her most conciliatory tones.\r\n\r\n"We never wanted to know," said Lucy, unexpectedly showing fight.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline flushed, but she had come resolved against hostile\r\nencounter, in which, hitherto, she had found herself overpowered by\r\nforce of numbers; so she contented herself with saying--\r\n\r\n"And have you any prospect of getting married?"\r\n\r\n"Frank has gone to Africa for the present," said Lucy.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline looked significant.\r\n\r\n"I only hope," she said afterwards to Fanny, who let her out at the\r\nstreet-door, "that your sister has not fallen into the hands of an\r\nunscrupulous adventurer. It will be time when the young man comes home,\r\nif he ever does, for Mr. Pratt to make the proper inquiries."\r\n\r\nFanny had risen into favour since her engagement; Mr. Marsh, also, had\r\nwon golden opinions at Lancaster Gate.\r\n\r\n"I believe," Fanny replied, speaking for once to the point, "that Frank\r\nJermyn is going to write, himself, to Mr. Pratt, at the first\r\nopportunity."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, upstairs in the sitting-room, Conny was delivering herself of\r\nher opinion that they had all behaved shamefully to Aunt Caroline.\r\n\r\n"She had a right to know. And it is very good of her to trouble about\r\nsuch a set of ungrateful girls at all," she cried. "You can\'t expect\r\nevery one besides yourselves to look upon Frank Jermyn as dropped from\r\nheaven."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Caroline is cumulative--not to be judged at a sitting," pleaded\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\nVery soon Constance herself rose to go.\r\n\r\n"I shall not see you again unless you come down to us; which, I suppose,\r\nyou won\'t," she said. "We go to Eastbourne on Friday; and afterwards to\r\nHomburg. Mama is going to write and invite you in due form."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of Mrs. Devonshire. Lucy and I cannot possibly leave\r\nhome, but Phyllis would like to go," answered Gertrude; a remark of\r\nwhich Phyllis herself took no notice.\r\n\r\n"Well then, good-bye. Lucy, Fred sends his congratulations. Phyllis, my\r\ndear, we shall meet ere long. Fanny, I shall look out for your wedding\r\nin the paper. Come on, Gerty, and let a fellow out!"\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the door her manner changed suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Do come home and dine, Gerty."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, Con, possibly."\r\n\r\n"Gerty, of course I can guess about Fred. I knew it was no good, but I\r\ncan\'t help being sorry."\r\n\r\n"It was out of the question, poor boy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t pity him too much. He\'ll get over it soon enough. His is not\r\na complaint that lasts."\r\n\r\nThere was a significant emphasis on the last words, that did not escape\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\n"You look better, Conny, than when I last saw you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m all right. There\'s nothing the matter with me but too many\r\nparties."\r\n\r\n"I think dancing has agreed with you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about dancing. I have taken to sitting in conservatories\r\nunder pink lamps. That is better sport, and far more becoming to the\r\ncomplexion."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t play that game, Conny. It never ends well."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it does. Often in St. George\'s, Hanover Square. You are shocked,\r\nbut I do not contemplate matrimony just at present. But I see you agree\r\nwith _Chastelard_--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "\'I do not like this manner of a dance;\r\n     This game of two and two; it were much better\r\n     To mix between the dances, than to sit,\r\n     Each lady out of earshot with her friend.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Have you been taking to literature?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; to the modern poets and the French novelists particularly. When\r\nnext you hear of me, I shall have taken probably to slumming; shall have\r\nfound peace in bearing jellies to aged paupers. Then you might write a\r\nmoral tale about me."\r\n\r\nGertrude sighed, as the door closed on Constance. It was the Devonshires\r\nwho, throughout their troubles, had shown them the most unwavering\r\nkindness; and on the Devonshires, it seemed, they were doomed to bring\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August, Fanny was quietly married at Marylebone Church.\r\nShe would have dearly liked a "white wedding;" and secretly hoped that\r\nher sisters would suggest what she dared not--a white satin bride and\r\nwhite muslin bridesmaids. Truth to tell, such an idea never entered the\r\nheads of those practical young women; and poor Fanny went soberly to the\r\naltar in a dark green travelling dress, which was becoming if not\r\nfestive.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline and Uncle Septimus came up from Tunbridge Wells for the\r\nwedding, and the Devonshires, who were away, lent their carriage. It was\r\na sober, middle-aged little function enough, and every one was glad when\r\nit was over.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline said little, but contented herself with sending her hard,\r\nkeen eyes into every nook and corner, every fold and plait, every dish\r\nand bowl; while she mentally appraised the value of the feast.\r\n\r\nOne result of the encounters with her nieces was this, that she was more\r\noutwardly gracious and less inwardly benevolent than before; a change\r\nnot wholly to be deprecated.\r\n\r\nLucy, with bright eyes, listened, with the air of one who has a right to\r\nbe interested, to the words of the marriage service, taking afterwards\r\nher usual share in practical details. She was upheld, no doubt, by the\r\nconsciousness of the letter in her pocket; a letter which had come that\r\nvery morning; was written on thin paper in a bold hand; and in common\r\nwith others from the same source, was bright and kind; tender and\r\nhopeful; and very full of confidential statements as to all that\r\nconcerned the writer.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, pale but beautiful, alternated between langour and a fitful\r\nsprightliness; her three weeks at Eastbourne seemed to have done her\r\nlittle good; while Gertrude went through her part mechanically, and\r\nremembered remorsefully that she had never been very nice to Fanny.\r\n\r\nAs for the bride, she was subdued and tearful, as an orthodox bride\r\nshould be; and invited all her sisters in turn to come and stay with her\r\nat Notting Hill directly the honeymoon in Switzerland should be over.\r\nEdward Marsh suffered the usual insignificance of bridegrooms; but did\r\nall that was demanded of him with exactness.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when that blankness which invariably follows a wedding\r\nhad fallen upon the sisters, Mrs. Maryon came up into the sitting-room,\r\nand beguiled them with tales of the various brides she had known; who,\r\nif they had not married in haste, must certainly, to judge by the\r\nsequel, have repented at leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nA SPECIAL EDITION.\r\n\r\n                 _We bear to think\r\n     You\'re gone,--to feel you may not come,--\r\n     To hear the door-latch stir and clink,\r\n             Yet no more you!...._\r\n                               E. B. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was true enough, no doubt, that Phyllis did not care for Darrell in\r\nLucy\'s sense of the word; but at the same time it was sufficiently clear\r\nthat he had been the means of injecting a subtle poison into her veins.\r\n\r\nSince the night of the _conversazione_ at the Berkeley Galleries, when\r\nhe had bidden her farewell, a change, in every respect for the worse,\r\nhad crept over her.\r\n\r\nThe buoyancy, which had been one of her chief charms, had deserted her.\r\nShe was languid, restless, bored, and more utterly idle than ever. The\r\nflippancy of her lighter moods shocked even her sisters, who had been\r\naccustomed to allow her great license in the matter of jokes; the\r\nmoodiness of her moments of depression distressed them beyond measure.\r\n\r\nAt Eastbourne she had amused herself with getting up a tremendous\r\nflirtation with Fred, to the Devonshires\' annoyance and the satisfaction\r\nof the victim himself, whose present mood it suited and who hoped that\r\nLucy would hear of it.\r\n\r\nAfter Phyllis\'s visit to Eastbourne, which had been closely followed by\r\nFanny\'s wedding, the household at Upper Baker Street underwent a period\r\nof dulness, which was felt all the more keenly from the cheerful fulness\r\nof the previous summer. Every one was out of town. In early September\r\neven the country cousins have departed, and people have not yet begun to\r\nreturn to London, where it is perhaps the most desolate period of the\r\nwhole year.\r\n\r\nWork, of course, was slack, and they had no longer the preparations for\r\nFanny\'s wedding to fall back upon.\r\n\r\nThe air was hot, sunless, misty; like a vapour bath, Phyllis said. Even\r\nGertrude, inveterate cockney as she was, began to long for the country.\r\nNothing but a strong sense of loyalty to her sister prevented Lucy from\r\naccepting a cordial invitation from the "old folks." Phyllis openly\r\nproclaimed that she was only awaiting _der erste beste_ to make her\r\nescape for ever from Baker Street.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, indeed, was in the worst case of them all; for while Lucy had\r\nthe precious letters from Africa to console her, Gertrude had again\r\ntaken up her pen, which seemed to move more freely in her hand than it\r\nhad ever done before.\r\n\r\nSo the days went on till it was the middle of September, and life was\r\nbeginning to quicken in the great city.\r\n\r\nOne sultry afternoon, the Lorimers were gathered in the sitting-room;\r\nboth windows stood open, admitting the hot, still, autumnal air; every\r\nsound in the street could be distinctly heard.\r\n\r\nLucy sat apart, deep in a voluminous letter on foreign paper which had\r\ncome for her that morning, and which she had been too busy to read\r\nbefore. Phyllis was at the table, yawning over a copy of _The Woodcut_;\r\nwhich was opened at a page of engravings headed: "The War in Africa;\r\nfrom sketches by our special artist." Gertrude sewed by the window, too\r\ntired to think or talk. Now and then she glanced across mechanically to\r\nthe opposite house, whence in these days of dreariness, no picturesque,\r\nimpetuous young man was wont to issue; from whose upper windows no\r\nfriendly eyes gazed wistfully across.\r\n\r\nThe rooms above the auctioneer\'s had, in fact, a fresh occupant; an\r\nex-Girtonian without a waist, who taught at the High School for girls\r\nhard-by.\r\n\r\nThe Lorimers chose to regard her as a usurper; and with the justice\r\nusually attributed to their sex, indulged in much sarcastic comment on\r\nher appearance; on her round shoulders and swinging gait; on the green\r\ngown with balloon sleeves, and the sulphur-coloured handkerchief which\r\nshe habitually wore.\r\n\r\nPresently Lucy looked up from her letter, folded it, sighed, and smiled.\r\n\r\n"What has your special artist to say for himself?" asked Phyllis,\r\npushing away _The Woodcut_.\r\n\r\n"He writes in good spirits, but holds out no prospect of the war coming\r\nto an end. He was just about to go further into the interior, with\r\nGeneral Somerset\'s division. Mr. Steele of _The Photogravure_, with whom\r\nhe seems to have chummed, goes too," answered Lucy, putting the letter\r\ninto her pocket.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps his sketches will be a little livelier in consequence. They are\r\nvery dull this week."\r\n\r\nPhyllis rose as she spoke, stretching her arms above her head. "I think\r\nI will go and dine with Fan. She is such fun."\r\n\r\nFanny had returned from Switzerland a day or two before, and was now in\r\nthe full tide of bridal complacency. As mistress of a snug and hideous\r\nlittle house at Notting Hill, and wedded wife of a large and\r\naffectionate man, she was beginning to feel that she had a place in the\r\nworld at last.\r\n\r\n"I will come up with you," said Lucy to Phyllis, "and brush your hair\r\nbefore you go."\r\n\r\nThe two girls went from the room, leaving Gertrude alone. Letting fall\r\nher work into her lap, she leaned in dreamy idleness from the window,\r\nlooking out into the street, where the afternoon was deepening apace\r\ninto evening. A dun-coloured haze, thin and transparent, hung in the\r\nair, softening the long perspective of the street. School hours were\r\nover, and the Girtonian, her arm swinging like a bell-rope, could be\r\ndiscerned on her way home, a devoted _cort\xe8ge_ of school-girls\r\nstraggling in her wake. From the corner of the street floated up the\r\ncries of the newspaper boys, mingling with the clatter of omnibus\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nAn empty hansom cab crawled slowly by. Gertrude noticed that it had\r\nviolet lamps instead of red ones.\r\n\r\nA lamplighter was going his rounds, leaving a lengthening line of\r\norange-coloured lights to mark his track. The recollection of summer,\r\nthe presage of winter, were met in the dusky atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"How the place echoes," thought Gertrude. It seemed to her that the boys\r\ncrying the evening papers were more vociferous than usual; and as the\r\nthought passed through her mind, she was aware of a hateful, familiar\r\nsound--the hoarse shriek of a man proclaiming a "special edition" up the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nNo amount of familiarity could conquer the instinctive shudder with\r\nwhich she always listened to these birds of ill-omen, these carrion,\r\nwhose hideous task it is to gloat over human calamity. Now, as the sound\r\ngrew louder and more distinct, the usual vague and sickening horror\r\ncrept over her. She put her hands to her ears. "It is some ridiculous\r\nrace, no doubt."\r\n\r\nShe let in the sound again.\r\n\r\nHer fears were unformulated, but she hoped that Lucy upstairs in the\r\nbed-room had not heard.\r\n\r\nThe cry ceased abruptly; some one was buying a paper; then was taken up\r\nagain with increased vociferousness. Gertrude strained her ears to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n"Terrible slaughter, terrible slaughter of British troops!" floated up\r\nin the hideous tones.\r\n\r\nShe listened, fascinated with a nameless horror.\r\n\r\n"A regiment cut to pieces! Death of a general! Special edition!" The\r\nfiend stood under the window, vociferating upwards.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Gertrude had slipped down the dusky staircase, and was\r\ngiving the man sixpence for a halfpenny paper. Standing beneath the\r\ngas-jet in the passage, she opened the sheet and read; then, still\r\nclutching it, sank down white and trembling on the lowest stair.\r\n\r\nNoiseless, rapid footfalls came down behind her, some one touched her on\r\nthe shoulder, and a strange voice said in her ear, "Give it to me."\r\n\r\nShe started up, putting the hateful thing behind her.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no, Lucy! It is not true."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes! don\'t be ridiculous, Gerty."\r\n\r\nLucy took the paper in her hands, bore it to the light, and read,\r\nGertrude hiding her face against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe paper stated, briefly, that news had arrived at head-quarters of the\r\nalmost total destruction of the troops which, under General Somerset,\r\nhad set out for the interior of Africa some weeks before. A few\r\nstragglers, chiefly native allies, had reached the coast in safety, and\r\nhad reported that the General himself had been among the first to\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Steele and Jermyn, special artists of _The Photogravure_ and\r\n_The Woodcut_, respectively, had been among those to join the\r\nexpedition. No news of their fate had been ascertained, and there was\r\nreason to fear that they had shared the doom of the others.\r\n\r\n"It is not true." Lucy\'s voice rang hollow and strange. She stood\r\nthere, white and rigid, under the gas-jet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon, who had bought a paper on her own account, issued from the\r\nshop-parlour in time to see the poor young lady sway forward into her\r\nsister\'s arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose were dark days that followed. At first there had been hope; but as\r\ntime went on, and further details of the catastrophe came to light,\r\nthere was nothing for the most sanguine to do but to accept the worst.\r\n\r\nGertrude herself felt that the one pale gleam of uncertainty which yet\r\nremained was, perhaps, the most cruel feature of the case. If only\r\nLucy\'s hollow eyes could drop their natural tears above Frank\'s grave\r\nshe might again find peace.\r\n\r\nFrank\'s grave! Gertrude found herself starting back incredulous at the\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nDeath, as a general statement, is so easy of utterance, of belief; it is\r\nonly when we come face to face with it that we find the great mystery so\r\ncruelly hard to realise; for death, like love, is ever old and ever new.\r\n\r\n"People always come back in books," Fanny had said, endeavouring, in\r\nall good faith, to administer consolation; and Lucy had actually\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Your sister ought to be able to do better for herself," Edward Marsh\r\nsaid, later on, to his wife.\r\n\r\nBut Fanny, who had had a genuine liking for kind Frank, disagreed for\r\nonce with the marital opinion.\r\n\r\n"He was good, and he loved her. She has always that to remember,"\r\nGertrude thought, as she watched Lucy going about her business with a\r\ncalmness that alarmed her more than the most violent expressions of\r\nsorrow would have done.\r\n\r\n"Dear little Frank! I wonder if he is really dead," Phyllis reflected,\r\nstaring with wide eyes at the house opposite, rather as if she expected\r\nto see a ghost issue from the door.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Lorimers they had little time for brooding over\r\ntheir troubles. Their success had proved itself no ephemeral one. As\r\npeople returned to town, work began to flow in upon them from all sides,\r\nand their hands were full. Labour and sorrow, the common human portion,\r\nwere theirs, and they accepted them with courage, if not, indeed, with\r\nresignation. September and October glided by, and now the winter was\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPHYLLIS.\r\n\r\n     _Die \xe6ltre Tochter g\xe6hnet\r\n     "Ich will nicht verhungern bei euch,\r\n     Ich gehe morgen zum Grafen,\r\n     Und der ist verliebt und reich."_\r\n                                   HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Lucy, dear, you must go."\r\n\r\n"But, Gerty, you can never manage to get through the work alone."\r\n\r\n"I will make Phyllis help me. It will be the best thing for her, and she\r\nworks better than any of us when she chooses."\r\n\r\nThe sisters were standing together in the studio, discussing a letter\r\nwhich Lucy held in her hand--an appeal from the heartbroken "old folks"\r\nthat she, who was to have been their daughter, should visit them in\r\ntheir sorrow.\r\n\r\n"It is simply your duty to go," went on Gertrude, who was consumed with\r\nanxiety concerning her sister; then added, involuntarily, "if you think\r\nyou can bear it."\r\n\r\nA light came into Lucy\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything that one cannot bear?"\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and began mechanically fixing a negative into one of\r\nthe printing frames. She remembered how, on that last day, Frank had\r\nplanned the visit to Cornwall. Was he not going to show her every nook\r\nand corner of the old home, which many a time before he had so minutely\r\ndescribed to her? The place had for long been familiar to her\r\nimagination, and now she was in fact to make acquaintance with it; that\r\nwas all. What availed it to dwell on contrasts?\r\n\r\nThe sisters spoke little of Lucy\'s approaching journey, which was fixed\r\nfor some days after the receipt of the letter; and one cold and foggy\r\nNovember afternoon found her helping Mrs. Maryon with her little box\r\ndown the stairs, while Matilda went for a cab.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Gertrude issued from the studio with her outdoor\r\nclothes on.\r\n\r\n"No one is likely to come in this Egyptian darkness," she said; "it is\r\nfour o\'clock already, and I am going to take you to Paddington."\r\n\r\n"That will be delightful, if you think you may risk it," answered Lucy,\r\nwho looked very pale in her black clothes.\r\n\r\n"I have left a message with Mrs. Maryon to be delivered in the\r\nimprobable event of \'three customers coming in,\' as they did in _John\r\nGilpin_," said Gertrude, with a feeble attempt at sprightliness.\r\n\r\nMatilda appeared at this point to announce that the cab was at the door.\r\n\r\n"Where is Phyllis?" cried Lucy. "I have not said good-bye to her."\r\n\r\n"She went out two hours ago, miss," put in Mrs. Maryon, in her sad\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"No doubt," said Gertrude, "she has gone to Conny\'s. I think she goes\r\nthere a great deal in these days."\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon looked up quickly, then set about helping Matilda hoist the\r\nbox on to the cab.\r\n\r\n"How bitterly cold it is," cried Gertrude, with a shudder, as they\r\ncrossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nAn orange-coloured fog hung in the air, congealed by the sudden change\r\nof temperature into a thick and palpable mass.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t be surprised if we had snow," observed Mrs. Maryon, shaking\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how could Phyllis be so wicked as to go out?" cried Gertrude, as\r\nthe cab drove off: "and her cough has been so troublesome lately."\r\n\r\n"I think she has been looking more like her old self the last week or\r\ntwo," said Lucy; then added, "Do you know that Mr. Darrell is back? I\r\nforgot to tell you that I met him in Regent\'s Park the other day."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will not wish to renew the sittings; but no doubt he has\r\nfound some fresh whim by this time. I wish he had let Phyllis alone; he\r\ndid her no good."\r\n\r\n"Poor little soul, I am afraid she finds it dismal," said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"I mean to plan a little dissipation for us both when you are away--the\r\ntheatre, probably," said Gertrude, who felt remorsefully that in her\r\nanxiety concerning Lucy she had rather neglected Phyllis.\r\n\r\n"Yes, do, and take care of yourself, dear old Gerty," said Lucy, as the\r\ncab drew up at Paddington station.\r\n\r\nThe sisters embraced long and silently, and in a few minutes Lucy was\r\nsteaming westward in a third-class carriage, and Gertrude was making her\r\nway through the fog to Praed Street station. At Baker Street she\r\nperceived that Mrs. Maryon\'s prophecy was undergoing fulfilment; the fog\r\nhad lifted a little, and flakes of snow were falling at slow intervals.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of Number 20B a small brougham was standing--a brougham,\r\nas she observed by the light of the street lamp, with a coronet\r\nemblazoned on the panels.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate is in the studio, miss," announced Mrs. Maryon, who\r\nopened the door; "he only came a minute ago, and preferred to wait. I\r\nhave lit the lamp." As Gertrude was going towards the studio the woman\r\nran up to her, and put a note in her hand. "I forgot to give you this,"\r\nshe said. "I found it in the letter-box a minute after you left."\r\n\r\nGertrude, glancing hastily at the envelope, recognised, with some\r\nsurprise, the childish handwriting of her sister Phyllis, and concluded\r\nthat she had decided to remain overnight at the Devonshires.\r\n\r\n"She might have remembered that I was alone," she thought, a little\r\nwistfully as she opened the door of the waiting-room.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate advanced to meet her, and they shook hands gravely. She\r\nhad not seen him since the night of the _conversazione_ at the Berkeley\r\nGalleries. His ample presence seemed to fill the little room.\r\n\r\n"It is a shame," he said, "to come down upon you at this time of night."\r\n\r\nShe laid Phyllis\'s note on the table, and turned to him with a smile of\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you read your letter before we embark on the question of slides?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I will just open it."\r\n\r\nShe broke the seal, advanced to the lamp, and cast her eye hastily over\r\nthe letter. But something in the contents seemed to rivet her attention,\r\nto merit more than a casual glance. For some moments she stood absorbed\r\nin the carelessly-written sheet; then, suddenly, an exclamation of\r\nsorrow and astonishment burst from her lips.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate advanced towards her.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lorimer, you are in some trouble. Can I help you, or shall I go\r\naway?"\r\n\r\nShe looked up, half-bewildered, into the strong and gentle face. Then\r\nrealising nothing, save that here was a friendly human presence, put the\r\nletter into his hand.\r\n\r\nThis is what he read.\r\n\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR GERTY,--This is to tell you that I am not coming home\r\n     to-night--am not coming home again at all, in fact. I am going to\r\n     marry Mr. Darrell, who will take me to Italy, where the weather is\r\n     decent, and where I shall get well. For you know, I am horribly\r\n     seedy, Gerty, and very dull.\r\n\r\n     "Of course you will be angry with me; you never liked Sidney, and\r\n     you will think it ungrateful of me, perhaps, to go off like this.\r\n     But oh, Gerty, it has been so dismal, especially since we heard\r\n     about poor little Frank. Sidney hates a fuss, and so do I. We both\r\n     of us prefer to go off on the Q.T., as Fred says. With love from\r\n\r\n     "PHYLLIS."\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Lord Watergate finished this characteristic epistle, an exclamation\r\nmore fraught with horror than Gertrude\'s own burst from his lips. He\r\nstrode across the room, crushing the paper in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate!" Gertrude faced him, pale, questioning: a nameless\r\ndread clutched at her.\r\n\r\nSomething in her face struck him. Stopping short in front of her, in\r\ntones half paralysed with horror, he said--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"Do I know?" she echoed his words, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Darrell is married. He does not live with his wife; but it is no\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\nThe red tables and chairs, the lamp, Lord Watergate himself, whose voice\r\nsounded fierce and angry, were whirling round Gertrude in hopeless\r\nconfusion; and then suddenly she remembered that this was an old story;\r\nthat she had known it always, from the first moment when she had looked\r\nupon Darrell\'s face.\r\n\r\nGertrude closed her eyes, but she did not faint. She remained standing,\r\nwhile one hand rested on the table for support. Yes, she had known it;\r\nhad stood by powerless, paralysed, while this thing approached; had\r\nseen it even as Cassandra saw from afar the horror which she had been\r\nunable to avert.\r\n\r\nOpening her eyes, she met the gaze, grieved, pitiful, indignant, of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?"\r\n\r\nHer lips framed the words with difficulty.\r\n\r\nA pause; then he said--\r\n\r\n"I cannot hold out much hope. But will you come with me to--to--his\r\nhouse and make inquiries?"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head, and gathering herself together, led the way from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe snow was falling thick and fast as they emerged from the house, and\r\nLord Watergate handed her into his brougham. It had grown very dark, and\r\nthe wind had risen.\r\n\r\n"The Sycamores," said Lord Watergate to his coachman, as he took his\r\nseat by Gertrude, and drew the fur about her knees.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon, watching from the shop window, shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Who would have thought it? But you never can tell. And that Phyllis!\r\nIt\'s twice I\'ve seen her with the fair-haired gentleman, with his beard\r\ncut like a foreigner\'s. It\'s what you\'d expect from her, poor\r\ncreature--but Gertrude!"\r\n\r\n"They have got the rooms on lease," grumbled Mr. Maryon, from among his\r\npestles and mortars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SYCAMORES.\r\n\r\n     _How the world is made for each of us!\r\n       How all we perceive and know in it\r\n     Tends to some moment\'s product thus,\r\n       When a soul declares itself--to wit,\r\n     By its fruit the thing it does!_\r\n                           ROBERT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled on its way through the snow to St. John\'s Wood,\r\nwhile its two occupants sat side by side in silence. Now that they had\r\nset out, each felt the hopelessness of the errand on which they were\r\nbound, to which only that first stifling moment of horror, that absolute\r\nneed of action, had prompted them.\r\n\r\nThe brougham stopped in the road before the gate of The Sycamores.\r\n\r\n"We had better walk up the drive," said Lord Watergate, and opened the\r\ncarriage door.\r\n\r\nBy this time the snow lay deep on the road and the roofs of the houses;\r\nthe trees looked mere blotches of greyish-white, seen through the rapid\r\nwhirl of falling flakes, which it made one giddy to contemplate.\r\n\r\n"A terrible night for a journey," thought Lord Watergate, as he opened\r\nthe big gate; but he said nothing, fearing to arouse false hopes in the\r\nbreast of his companion.\r\n\r\nThey wound together up the drive, the dark mass of the house partly\r\nhidden by the curving, laurel-lined path, and further obscured by the\r\nveil of falling snow.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, something pierced through Gertrude\'s numbness; she\r\nstopped short.\r\n\r\n"Look!" she cried, beneath her breath.\r\n\r\nThey were now in full sight of the house. The upper windows were dark;\r\nthe huge windows of the studio were shuttered close, but through the\r\nchinks were visible lines and points of mellow light.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate laid his hand on her arm. He thought: "That is just like\r\nDarrell, to have doubled back. But even then we may be too late."\r\n\r\nHe said: "Miss Lorimer, if they are there, what are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to tell my sister that she has been deceived, and to bring\r\nher home with me."\r\n\r\nGertrude spoke very low, but without hesitation. Somewhere, in the\r\nbackground of her being, sorrow, and shame, and anger were lurking; at\r\npresent she was keenly conscious of nothing but an irresistible impulse\r\nto action.\r\n\r\n"That she has been deceived!" Lord Watergate turned away his face. Had\r\nPhyllis, indeed, been deceived, and was it not a fool\'s errand on which\r\nthey were bent?\r\n\r\nThey mounted the steps, and he rang the bell; then, by the light of the\r\nhanging lamp, while the snow swirled round and fell upon them both, he\r\nlooked into her white, tense face.\r\n\r\n"Do not hope for anything. It is most probable that they are not there."\r\n\r\nA long, breathless moment, then the door was thrown open, revealing the\r\nsolemn manservant standing out against the lighted vestibule.\r\n\r\n"I wish to see Mr. Darrell," said Lord Watergate, shortly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not at home, your lordship."\r\n\r\nGertrude pressed her hand to her heart.\r\n\r\n"He is at home to me, as you perfectly well know."\r\n\r\n"He has gone abroad, your lordship."\r\n\r\nGertrude swayed forward a little, steadying herself against the lintel,\r\nwhere she stood in darkness behind Lord Watergate.\r\n\r\n"There are lights in the studio, and you must let me in," said Lord\r\nWatergate, sternly.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s face betrayed him.\r\n\r\n"I shall lose my place, my lord."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for you, Shaw. You had better make off, and leave the\r\nresponsibility with me."\r\n\r\nThe man wavered, took the coin from Lord Watergate\'s hand, then,\r\nturning, went slowly back to his own quarters.\r\n\r\nGertrude came forward into the light.\r\n\r\n"You must not come in, Lord Watergate."\r\n\r\nHer mind worked with curious rapidity; she saw that a meeting between\r\nthe two men must be avoided.\r\n\r\n"I cannot let you go alone. You do not know----"\r\n\r\n"I am prepared for anything. Lord Watergate, spare my sister\'s shame."\r\n\r\nShe had passed him, with set, tragic face. He saw the slim, rapid\r\nfigure, in the black, snow-covered dress, make its way down the passage,\r\nthen disappear behind the curtain which guarded the entrance to the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nGertrude had entered noiselessly, and, pausing on the threshold, hidden\r\nin shadow, remained there motionless a moment\'s space.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the great room, seen but once before, smote on her sense\r\nwith a curious familiarity. It had been wintry daylight on the occasion\r\nof her former presence there; now a mellow radiance of shaded,\r\nartificial light was diffused throughout the apartment, a radiance\r\nconcentrated to subdued brilliance in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\nfireplace.\r\n\r\nA wood fire, with leaping blue flames, was piled on the hearth, its\r\nlight flickering fitfully on the surrounding objects; on the tiger-skin\r\nrug, the tall, rich screen of faded Spanish leather; on Darrell himself,\r\nwho lounged on a low couch, his blonde head outlined against the screen,\r\na cloud of cigarette smoke issuing from his lips, as he looked from\r\nunder his eye-lids at the figure before him.\r\n\r\nIt was Phyllis who stood there by the little table, on which lay some\r\nfruit and some coffee, in rose-coloured cups. Phyllis, yet somebody new\r\nand strange; not the pretty child that her sisters had loved, but a\r\nbeautiful wanton in a loose, trailing garment, shimmering, wonderful,\r\nwhite and lustrous as a pearl; Phyllis, with her brown hair turned to\r\ngold in the light of the lamp swung above her; Phyllis, with diamonds on\r\nthe slender fingers, that played with a cluster of bloom-covered grapes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the warmth, the overpowering fragrance of hot-house\r\nflowers, most of all, the sight of that figure by the table, had robbed\r\nGertrude of power to move or speak. But in her heart the storm, which\r\nhad been silently gathering, was growing ready to burst. For the time,\r\nthe varied emotions which devoured her had concentrated themselves into\r\na white heat of fury, which kindled all her being.\r\n\r\nThe flames leapt, the logs crackled pleasantly. Darrell blew a whiff of\r\nsmoke to the ceiling; Phyllis smiled, then suddenly into that bright\r\nscene glided a black and rigid figure, with glowing eyes and tragic\r\nface; with the snow sprinkled on the old cloak, and clinging in the\r\nwisps of wind-blown hair.\r\n\r\n"Phyllis," it said in level tones; "come home with me at once. Mr.\r\nDarrell cannot marry you; he is married already."\r\n\r\nPhyllis shrank back, with a cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gerty, how you frightened me! What do you mean by coming down on\r\none like this?"\r\n\r\nHer voice shook, through its petulance; she whisked round so suddenly\r\nthat her long dress caught in the little table, which fell to the ground\r\nwith a crash.\r\n\r\nDarrell had sprung to his feet with an exclamation. "By God, what brings\r\nthat woman here!"\r\n\r\nGertrude turned and faced him.\r\n\r\nHis face was livid with passion; his prominent eyes, for once wide open,\r\nglared at her in rage and hatred.\r\n\r\nGertrude met his glance with eyes that glowed with a passion yet fiercer\r\nthan his own.\r\n\r\nElements, long smouldering, had blazed forth at last. Face to face they\r\nstood; face to face, while the silent battle raged between them.\r\n\r\nThen with a curious elation, a mighty throb of what was almost joy,\r\nGertrude knew that she, not he, the man of whom she had once been\r\nafraid, was the stronger of the two. For one brief moment some fierce\r\ninstinct in her heart rejoiced.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, cowering in the background, Phyllis, pale as her splendid\r\ndress, shrank back, mystified, afraid. Her light soul shivered before\r\nthe blast of passions in which, though she had helped to raise them, she\r\nfelt herself to have no part nor lot.\r\n\r\nReckoned by time, the encounter of those two hostile spirits was but\r\nbrief; a moment, and Darrell had dropped his eyes, and was saying in\r\nsomething like his own languid voice--\r\n\r\n"To what may I ascribe this--honour?"\r\n\r\nGertrude turned in silence to her sister--\r\n\r\n"Take off that----" (she indicated the shimmering garment with a pause),\r\n"and come with me."\r\n\r\nDarrell sneered from the background; "Your sister has decided on\r\nremaining here."\r\n\r\n"Phyllis!" said Gertrude, looking at her.\r\n\r\nPhyllis began to sob.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gerty, what shall I do? Don\'t look at me like that. My dress is\r\nthere behind the screen; and my hat. Oh, Gerty, I shall never get it on;\r\nI am so much taller."\r\n\r\nWith rapid fingers Gertrude had unfastened her own long, black cloak,\r\nand was wrapping it about her sister.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens," cried Darrell, coming forward and seizing her hands;\r\n"You shall not take her away! You have no earthly right to take her\r\nagainst her will."\r\n\r\nWith a cold fury of disgust she shook off his touch.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sidney, I think I\'d better go. I oughtn\'t to have come." Phyllis\'\r\nvoice sounded touchingly childish.\r\n\r\nSomething in the pleading tones stirred his blood curiously.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," he cried, addressing himself to Gertrude, who was\r\ndeliberately drawing the rings from her sister\'s passive hands, "Do you\r\nknow what a night it is? That if you take her away you will kill her?\r\nGreat God, you paragon of virtue, don\'t you see how ill she is?"\r\n\r\nShe swept her glance over him in icy disdain; then going up to the\r\nmantelpiece, laid the rings on the shelf.\r\n\r\n"I swear to you," he cried, "that I will leave the house this hour,\r\nthis minute. That I will never return to it; that I will never see her\r\nagain--Phyllis!"\r\n\r\nAt the last word, his voice had dropped to a low and passionate key; he\r\nstretched out his arms, but Gertrude coming between them put her strong\r\ndesperate grasp about Phyllis, who swayed forward with closed eyes.\r\nDarrell retreated with a muffled exclamation of grief and rage and\r\nbaffled purpose, and Gertrude half led, half carried her sister from the\r\nroom, the hateful satin garment trailing noisily behind them from\r\nbeneath the black cloak.\r\n\r\nA tall figure came forward from the doorway; the door was standing open;\r\nand the white whirlpool was visible against the darkness outside.\r\n\r\n"She has fainted," said Gertrude, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate lifted her gently in his arms. At the same moment Darrell\r\nemerged from the studio, then remained rooted to the spot, dismayed and\r\nsullen, at the sight of his friend.\r\n\r\n"You are a scoundrel, Darrell," said Lord Watergate, in very clear,\r\ndeliberate tones; then, his burden in his arms, he stepped out into the\r\ndarkness, Gertrude closing the door behind them.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the brougham stopped before the house in Upper Baker\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate, when he had carried the fainting girl upstairs, went\r\nhimself for a doctor.\r\n\r\n"I think I have killed her," said Gertrude, before he went, looking up\r\nat him from over the prostrate figure of her sister; "and if it were all\r\nto be done again--I would do it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Maryon asked no questions; her genuine kindness and helpfulness\r\nwere called forth by this crisis; and her suspicions of Gertrude had\r\nvanished for ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nIN THE SICK-ROOM.\r\n\r\n       _A riddle that one shrinks\r\n     To challenge from the scornful sphinx._\r\n                             D. G. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s verdict was unhesitating enough. Phyllis\'s doom, as more\r\nthan one who knew her foresaw, was sealed. The shock and the exposure\r\nhad only hastened an end which for long had been inevitable.\r\nConsumption, complicated with heart disease, both in advanced stages,\r\nheld her in their grasp; added to these, a severe bronchial attack had\r\nset in since the night of the snowstorm, and her life might be said to\r\nhang by a thread. It might be a matter of days, said the cautious\r\nphysician, of weeks, or even months.\r\n\r\n"Would a journey to the south, at an earlier stage of her illness, have\r\navailed to save her?" Gertrude asked, with white, mechanical lips.\r\n\r\nIt was possible, was the answer, that it would have prolonged her life.\r\nBut almost from the first, it seemed, the shadow of the grave must have\r\nrested on this beautiful human blossom.\r\n\r\n"Death in her face," muttered Mrs. Maryon, grimly; "I saw it there, I\r\nhave always seen it."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, people came and went in Upper Baker Street; sympathetic,\r\ninquisitive, bustling.\r\n\r\nFanny, dismayed and tearful, appeared daily at the invalid\'s bedside,\r\nladen with grapes and other delicacies.\r\n\r\n"Poor old Fan," said Phyllis; "how shocked she would be if she knew\r\neverything. Don\'t you think it is your duty, Gerty, to Mr. Marsh, to let\r\nhim know?"\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline drove across from Lancaster Gate, rebuke implied in every\r\nfold of her handsome dress.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think," she remarked to her friends, "how Gertrude could have\r\nreconciled such culpable neglect of that poor child\'s health to her\r\nconscience."\r\n\r\nGertrude avoided her aunt, saying to herself, in the bitterness of her\r\nhumiliation: "It is the Aunt Carolines of this world who are right. I\r\nought to have listened to her. She understood human nature better than\r\nI."\r\n\r\nThe Devonshires, who had not long returned from Germany, were\r\nunremitting in their kindness, the slackened bonds between the two\r\nfamilies growing tight once more in this hour of need.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate made regular inquiries in Baker Street. Gertrude found\r\nhis presence more endurable than that of the people with whom she had to\r\ndissemble; he knew her secret; it was safe with him and she was almost\r\nglad that he knew it.\r\n\r\nGertrude had written a brief note to Lucy, telling her that Phyllis was\r\nvery ill, but urging her to remain a week, at least, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\n"She will need all the strength she can get up," thought Gertrude. She\r\nherself was performing prodigies of work without any conscious effort.\r\n\r\nFrozen, tense, silent, she vibrated between the studio and the\r\nsick-room, moving as if in obedience to some hidden mechanism, a\r\ncreature apparently without wants, emotions, or thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe had gathered from Phyllis\' cynically frank remarks, that it was by\r\nthe merest chance she had not been too late and that Darrell had\r\nreturned to The Sycamores.\r\n\r\n"We were going to cross on our way to Italy that very night," Phyllis\r\nsaid. "We drove to Charing Cross, and then the snow began to fall, and I\r\nhad such a fit of coughing that Sidney was frightened, and took me home\r\nto St. John\'s Wood."\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had received these confidences in silence, turned her head\r\naway with an involuntary, instinctive movement of repugnance at the\r\nmention of Darrell\'s Christian name.\r\n\r\n"Gerty," said Phyllis, who lay back among the pillows, a white ghost\r\nwith two burning red spots on her cheeks, "Gerty, it is only fair that I\r\nshould tell you: Sidney isn\'t as bad as you think. He went away in the\r\nsummer, because he was beginning to care about me too much; he only came\r\nback because he simply couldn\'t help himself. And--and, you will go out\r\nof the room and never speak to me again--I knew he had a wife, Gerty; I\r\nheard them talking about her at the Oakleys, the very first day I saw\r\nhim. She was his model; she drinks like a fish, and is ten years older\r\nthan he is----I put that in the letter about getting married, because I\r\ndidn\'t quite know how to say it. I thought that very likely you knew."\r\n\r\nGertrude had walked to the window, and was pulling down the blind with\r\nstiff, blundering fingers. It was growing dusk and in less than half an\r\nhour Lucy would be home. It was just a week since she had set out for\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\n"Shall you tell Lucy?" came the childish voice from among the pillows.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Lie still, Phyllis, and I will see if Mrs. Maryon has\r\nprepared the jelly for you."\r\n\r\n"Kind old thing, Mrs. Maryon."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. She quite ignores the fact that we have no possible claim\r\non her."\r\n\r\nGertrude met Mrs. Maryon on the dusky stairs, dish in hand.\r\n\r\n"Do go and lie down, Miss Lorimer; or we shall have you knocked up too,\r\nand where should we be then? You mustn\'t let Miss Lucy see you like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nGertrude obeyed mechanically. Going into the sitting-room, she threw\r\nherself on the little hard sofa, her face pressed to the pillow.\r\n\r\nShe must have fallen into a doze, for the next thing of which she was\r\naware was Lucy\'s voice in her ear, and opening her eyes she saw Lucy\r\nbending over her, candle in hand.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen her?" she asked, sitting up with a dazed air.\r\n\r\n"I am back this very minute. Gertrude, what have you been doing to\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am all right." She rose with a little smile. "Let me look at you,\r\nLucy. Actually roses on your cheek."\r\n\r\n"Gertrude, Gertrude, what has happened to you? Have I come--Oh, Gerty,\r\nhave I come too late?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Gertrude, "but she is very ill."\r\n\r\nLucy put her arms round her sister.\r\n\r\n"And I have left you alone through these days. Oh, my poor Gerty."\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs together, and Lucy passed into the invalid\'s room,\r\nGertrude remaining in the outer apartment, which was her own.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes Lucy came out sobbing. "Oh, Phyllis, Phyllis," she\r\nwept below her breath.\r\n\r\nGertrude, paler than ever, rose without a word, and went into the\r\nsick-room.\r\n\r\n"Poor old Lucy, she looked as if she were going to cry. I asked her if\r\nshe had any message for Frank," said Phyllis, as her sister sat down\r\nbeside her, and adjusted the lamp.\r\n\r\n"You are over-exciting yourself. Lie still, Phyllis."\r\n\r\n"But, Gerty, I feel ever so much better to-night."\r\n\r\nSilence. Gertrude sewed, and the invalid lay with closed eyes, but the\r\nflutter of the long lashes told that she was not asleep.\r\n\r\n"Gerty!" In about half an hour the grey eyes had unclosed, and were\r\nfixed widely on her sister\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Gerty, am I really going to die?"\r\n\r\n"You are very ill," said Gertrude, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"But to die--it seems so impossible, so difficult, somehow. Frank died;\r\nthat was wonderful enough; but oneself!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my child," broke from Gertrude\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be sorry. I have never been a nice person, but I don\'t funk\r\nsomehow. I ought to, after being such a bad lot, but I don\'t. Gerty!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Gerty, you have always been good to me; this last week as well. But\r\nthat is the worst of you good people; you are hard as stones. You bring\r\nme jelly; you sit up all night with me--but you have never forgiven me.\r\nYou know that is the truth."\r\n\r\nGertrude knelt by the bedside, a great compunction in her heart; she put\r\nher hand on that of Phyllis, who went on--\r\n\r\n"And there is something I should wish to tell you. I am glad you came\r\nand fetched me away. The very moment I saw your angry, white face, and\r\nyour old clothes with the snow on, I was glad. It is funny, if one comes\r\nto think of it. I was frightened, but I was glad."\r\n\r\nGertrude\'s head drooped lower and lower over the coverlet; her heart,\r\nwhich had been frozen within her, melted. In an agony of love, of\r\nremorse, she stretched out her arms, while her sobs came thick and fast,\r\nand gathered the wasted figure to her breast.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phyllis, oh, my child; who am I to forgive you? Is it a question of\r\nforgiveness between us? Oh, Phyllis, my little Phyllis, have you\r\nforgotten how I love you?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST ACT.\r\n\r\n     _Just as another woman sleeps._\r\n                     D. G. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till a week or two later that Gertrude brought herself to\r\ntell Lucy what had happened during her absence. It was a bleak afternoon\r\nin the beginning of December; in the next room lay Phyllis, cold and\r\nstiff and silent for ever; and Lucy was drearily searching in a cupboard\r\nfor certain mourning garments which hung there. But suddenly, from the\r\ndarkness of the lowest shelf, something shone up at her, a white,\r\nshimmering object, lying coiled there like a snake.\r\n\r\nIt was Phyllis\'s splendid satin gown, which Gertrude had flung there on\r\nthe fateful night, and, from sheer repugnance, had never disturbed.\r\n\r\n"But you must send it back," Lucy said, when in a few broken words her\r\nsister had explained its presence in the cupboard.\r\n\r\nLucy was very pale and very serious. She gathered up the satin gown,\r\nwhich nothing could have induced Gertrude to touch, folded it neatly,\r\nand began looking about for brown paper in which to enclose it.\r\n\r\nThe ghastly humour of the little incident struck Gertrude. "There is\r\nsome string in the studio," she said, half-ironically, and went back to\r\nher post in the chamber of death.\r\n\r\nIn her long narrow coffin lay Phyllis; beautiful and still, with flowers\r\nbetween her hands. She had drifted out of life quietly enough a few days\r\nbefore; to-morrow she would be lying under the newly-turned cemetery\r\nsods.\r\n\r\nGertrude stood a moment, looking down at the exquisite face. On the\r\nbreast of the dead girl lay a mass of pale violets which Lord Watergate\r\nhad sent the day before, and as Gertrude looked, there flashed through\r\nher mind, what had long since vanished from it, the recollection of\r\nLord Watergate\'s peculiar interest in Phyllis.\r\n\r\nIt was explained now, she thought, as the image of another dead face\r\nfloated before her vision. That also was the face of a woman, beautiful\r\nand frail; of a woman who had sinned. She had never seen the resemblance\r\nbefore; it was clear enough now.\r\n\r\nThen she took up once again her watcher\'s seat at the bed-side, and\r\nstrove to banish thought.\r\n\r\nTo do and do and do; that is all that remains to one in a world where\r\nthinking, for all save a few chosen beings, must surely mean madness.\r\n\r\nShe had fallen into a half stupor, when she was aware of a subtle sense\r\nof discomfort creeping over her; of an odour, strong and sweet and\r\nindescribably hateful, floating around her like a winged nightmare.\r\nOpening her eyes with an effort, she saw Mrs. Maryon standing gravely\r\nat the foot of the bed, an enormous wreath of tuberose in her hand.\r\n\r\nGertrude rose from her seat.\r\n\r\n"Who sent those flowers?" she said, sternly.\r\n\r\n"A servant brought them; he mentioned no name, and there is no card\r\nattached."\r\n\r\nThe woman laid the wreath on the coverlet and discreetly withdrew.\r\n\r\nGertrude stood staring at the flowers, fascinated. In the first moment\r\nof the cold yet stifling fury which stole over her, she could have taken\r\nthem in her hands and torn them petal from petal.\r\n\r\nOne instant, she had stretched out her hand towards them; the next, she\r\nhad turned away, sick with the sense of impotence, of loathing, of\r\nimmeasurable disdain.\r\n\r\nWhat weapons could avail against the impenetrable hide of such a man?\r\n\r\n"She never cared for him," a vindictive voice whispered to her from the\r\ndepths of her heart.\r\n\r\nThen she shrank back afraid before the hatred which held possession of\r\nher soul. The passion which had animated her on the fateful evening of\r\nPhyllis\'s flight, the very strength which had caused her to prevail,\r\nseemed to her fearful and hideous things. She would fain have put the\r\nthought of them away; have banished them and all recollection of Darrell\r\nfrom her mind for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was a bleak December morning, with a touch of east wind in the air,\r\nwhen Phyllis was laid in her last resting-place.\r\n\r\nTo Gertrude all the sickening details of the little pageant were as the\r\nshadows of a nightmare. Standing rigid as a statue by the open grave,\r\nshe was aware of nothing but the sweet, stifling fragrance of tuberose,\r\nwhich seemed to have detached itself from, and prevailed over, the\r\nsofter scents of rose and violet, and to float up unmixed from the\r\nflower-covered coffin.\r\n\r\nLucy stood on one side of her, silent and pale with down-dropt eyes;\r\nFanny sobbed vociferously on the other. Lord Watergate faced them with\r\nbent head. The tears rolled down Fred Devonshire\'s face as the burial\r\nservice proceeded. Aunt Caroline looked like a vindictive ghost. Uncle\r\nSeptimus wept silently.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a hideous act of cruelty to turn away at last and leave the\r\npoor child lying there alone, while the sexton shovelled the loose earth\r\non to her coffin; hideous, but inevitable; and at midday Gertrude and\r\nLucy drove back in the dismal coach to Baker Street, where Mr. Maryon\r\nhad put up alternate shutters in the shop-window, and the\r\numbrella-maker had drawn down his blinds.\r\n\r\nGertrude, as she lay awake that night, heard the rain beating against\r\nthe window-panes, and shuddered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHOPE AND A FRIEND.\r\n\r\n     _Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love._\r\n                     SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGertrude was sitting by the window with Constance Devonshire one bleak\r\nJanuary afternoon.\r\n\r\nConny\'s face wore a softened look. The fierce, rebellious misery of her\r\nheart had given place to a gentler grief, the natural human sorrow for\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nThis was a farewell visit. The next day she and her family were setting\r\nout for the South of France.\r\n\r\n"I tried to make Fred come with me to-day," Constance was saying; "but\r\nhe is dining with some kindred spirits at the Caf\xe9 Royal, and then going\r\non to the Gaiety. He said there would be no time."\r\n\r\nFred had been once to Baker Street since the unfortunate interview with\r\nLucy; had paid a brief visit of condolence, when he had been very much\r\non his dignity and very afraid of meeting Lucy\'s eye. The\r\nre-establishment of the old relations was not more possible than it\r\nusually is in such cases.\r\n\r\n"How long do you expect to be at Cannes?" Gertrude said, after one of\r\nthe pauses which kept on stretching themselves baldly across the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Till the end of March, probably. Isn\'t Lucy coming up to say \'good-bye\'\r\nto a fellow?"\r\n\r\n"She will be up soon. She is much distressed about the over-exposure of\r\nsome plates, and is trying to remedy the misfortune. Do you know, by the\r\nby, that we are thinking of taking an apprentice? Mr. Russel has found a\r\ngirl--a lady--who will pay us a premium, and probably live with us."\r\n\r\n"I think that is a good plan," said Conny, staring wistfully out of\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nHow strange it seemed, after all that had happened, to be sitting here\r\nquietly, talking about over-exposed negatives, premiums, and\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nLooking out into the familiar street, with its teeming memories of a\r\nvivid life now quenched for ever, she said to herself, as Gertrude had\r\noften said: "It is not possible."\r\n\r\nOne day, surely, the door would open to give egress to the well-known\r\nfigure; one day they would hear his footstep on the stairs, his voice in\r\nthe little room. Even as the thought struck her, Constance was aware of\r\na sound as of some one ascending, and started with a sudden beating of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Matilda flung open the door, and Lord Watergate came,\r\nunannounced, into the room.\r\n\r\nGertrude rose gravely to meet him.\r\n\r\nSince the accident, which had brought him into such intimate connection\r\nwith the Lorimers\' affairs, his kindness had been as unremitting as it\r\nhad been unobtrusive.\r\n\r\nGertrude had several times reproached herself for taking it as a matter\r\nof course; for being roused to no keener fervour of gratitude; yet\r\nsomething in his attitude seemed to preclude all expression of\r\ncommonplaces.\r\n\r\nIt was no personal favour that he offered. To stretch out one\'s hand to\r\na drowning creature is no act of gallantry; it is but recognition of a\r\nnatural human obligation.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate took a seat between the two girls, and, after a few\r\nremarks, Constance declared her intention of seeking Lucy in the studio.\r\n\r\n"Tell Lucy to come up when she has soaked her plates to her\r\nsatisfaction," said Gertrude, a little vexed at this desertion.\r\n\r\nTo have passed through such experiences together as she and Lord\r\nWatergate, makes the casual relations of life more difficult. These two\r\npeople, to all intents and purposes strangers, had been together in\r\nthose rare moments of life when the elaborate paraphernalia of everyday\r\nintercourse is thrown aside; when soul looks straight to soul through no\r\nintervening veil; when human voice answers human voice through no medium\r\nof an actor\'s mask.\r\n\r\nWe lose with our youth the blushes, the hesitations, the distressing\r\noutward marks of embarrassment; but, perhaps, with most of us, the\r\nshyness, as it recedes from the surface, only sinks deeper into the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed on Constance, Lord Watergate turned to Gertrude.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lorimer," he said, "I am afraid your powers of endurance have to\r\nbe further tried."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she said, while a listless incredulity that anything could\r\nmatter to her now stole over her, dispersing the momentary cloud of\r\nself-consciousness.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate leaned forward, regarding her earnestly.\r\n\r\n"There has been news," he said, slowly, "of poor young Jermyn."\r\n\r\nGertrude started.\r\n\r\n"You mean," she said, "that they have found him--that there is no\r\ndoubt."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary; there is every doubt."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lorimer, there is, I am afraid, much cruel suspense in store for\r\nyou, and possibly to no purpose. I came here to-day to prepare you for\r\nwhat you will hear soon enough. I chanced to learn from official\r\nquarters what will be in every paper in England to-morrow. There is a\r\nrumour that Jermyn has been seen alive."\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate!" Gertrude sprang to her feet, trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\nHe rose also, and continued, his eyes resting on her face meanwhile:--\r\n\r\n"Native messengers have arrived at head-quarters from the interior,\r\ngiving an account of two Englishmen, who, they say, are living as\r\nprisoners in one of the hostile towns. The descriptions of these\r\nprisoners correspond to those of Steele and Jermyn."\r\n\r\n"Lucy!" came faintly from Gertrude\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"It is chiefly for your sister\'s sake that I have come here. The rumour\r\nwill be all over the town to-morrow. Had you not better prepare her for\r\nthis, at the same time impressing on her the extreme probability of its\r\nbaselessness?"\r\n\r\n"I wish it could be kept from her altogether."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps even that might be managed until further confirmation arrives.\r\nI cannot conceal from you that at present I attach little value to it.\r\nIt was in the nature of things that such a rumour should arise; neither\r\nof the poor fellows having actually been seen dead."\r\n\r\n"What steps will be taken?" asked Gertrude, after a pause. She had not\r\nthe slightest belief that Frank would ever be among them again; she and\r\nLucy had gone over for ever to the great majority of the unfortunate.\r\n\r\n"A rescue-party is to be organised at once. The war being practically at\r\nan end, it would probably resolve itself into a case of ransom, if there\r\nwere any truth in the whole thing. I may be in possession of further\r\nnews a little before the newspapers. Needless to say that I shall bring\r\nit here at once."\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat and stood a moment looking down at her.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate, we do not even attempt to thank you for your kindness."\r\n\r\n"I have been able, unfortunately, to do so little for you. I wish to-day\r\nthat I had come to you as the bringer of good tidings; I am destined, it\r\nseems, to be your bird of ill-omen."\r\n\r\nHe dropped his eyes suddenly, and Gertrude turned away her face. A pause\r\nfell between them; then she said--\r\n\r\n"Will it be long before news of any reliability can reach us?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell; it may be a matter of days, of weeks, or even months."\r\n\r\n"I fear it will be impossible to keep the rumour from my poor Lucy."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so. I trust to you to save her from false hopes."\r\n\r\n"So I am to be Cassandra," thought Gertrude, a little wistfully. She was\r\nalways having some hideous _r\xf4le_ or other thrust upon her.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate moved towards the door.\r\n\r\nA sudden revulsion of feeling came over her.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," she said, "it is true."\r\n\r\nHe caught her mood. "Perhaps it is."\r\n\r\nThey stood smiling at one another like two children.\r\n\r\nConstance Devonshire coming upstairs a few minutes later found Gertrude\r\nstanding alone in the middle of the room, a vague smile playing about\r\nher face. A suspicion that was not new gathered force in Conny\'s mind.\r\nGoing up to her friend she said, with meaning--\r\n\r\n"Gerty, what has Lord Watergate been saying to you?"\r\n\r\n"Conny, Conny, can you keep a secret?"\r\n\r\nAnd then Gertrude told her of the new hope, vague and sweet and\r\nperilous, which Lord Watergate had brought with him.\r\n\r\n"But it is true, Gerty; it really is," Conny said, while the tears\r\npoured down her cheeks; "I have always known that the other thing was\r\nnot possible. Oh, Gerty, just to see him, just to know he is alive--will\r\nnot that be enough to last one all the days of one\'s life?"\r\n\r\nBut this mood of impersonal exaltation faded a little when Constance\r\nwent back to Queen\'s Gate, where everything was in a state of readiness\r\nfor the projected flitting. She lay awake sobbing with mingled feelings\r\nhalf through the night.\r\n\r\n"Even Gerty," she thought; "I am going to lose her too." For she\r\nremembered the smile in Gertrude\'s eyes that afternoon when she had\r\nfound her standing alone after Lord Watergate\'s visit; a smile to which\r\nshe chose to attach meanings which concerned the happiness of neither\r\nFrank nor Lucy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA DISMISSAL.\r\n\r\n     _O thou of little faith, what hast thou done?_\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy has always since maintained that the days which followed Lord\r\nWatergate\'s communication were the very worst that she ever went\r\nthrough. The fluctuations of hope and fear, the delays, the prolonged\r\nstrain of uncertainty coming upon her afresh, after all that had already\r\nbeen endured, could be nothing less than torture even to a person of her\r\nwell-balanced and well-regulated temperament.\r\n\r\n"To have to bear it all for the second time," thought poor Gertrude,\r\nwhose efforts to spare her sister could not, in the nature of things, be\r\nvery successful.\r\n\r\nA terrible fear that Lucy would break down altogether and slip from her\r\ngrasp, haunted her night and day. The world seemed to her peopled with\r\nshadows, which she could do nothing more than clutch at as they passed\r\nby, she herself the only creature of any permanence of them all. But\r\ngradually the tremulous, flickering flame of hope grew brighter and\r\nsteadier; then changed into a glad certainty. And one wonderful day,\r\ntowards the end of March, Frank was with them once more: Frank, thinner\r\nand browner perhaps, but in no respect the worse for his experiences;\r\nFrank, as they had always known him--kind and cheery and sympathetic;\r\nwith the old charming confidence in being cared for.\r\n\r\n"And I was not there," he cried, regretful, self-reproachful, when Lucy\r\nhad told him the details of their sad story.\r\n\r\n"I thought always, \'If Frank were here!\'"\r\n\r\n"I think I should have killed him," said Frank, in all sincerity; and\r\nLucy drew closer to him, grateful for the non-fulfilment of her wish.\r\n\r\nThey were standing together in the studio. It was the day after Jermyn\'s\r\nreturn, and Gertrude was sitting listlessly upstairs, her busy hands\r\nfor once idle in her lap. In a few days April would have come round\r\nagain for the second time since their father\'s death.\r\n\r\nWhat a lifetime of experience had been compressed into those two years,\r\nshe thought, her apathetic eyes mechanically following the green garment\r\nof the High School mistress, as she whisked past down the street.\r\n\r\nShe knew that it is often so in human life--a rapid succession of\r\nevents; a vivid concentration of every sort of experience in a brief\r\nspace; then long, grey stretches of eventless calm. She knew also how it\r\nis when events, for good or evil, rain down thus on any group of\r\npersons.--The majority are borne to new spheres, for them the face of\r\nthings has changed completely. But nearly always there is one, at least,\r\nwho, after the storm is over, finds himself stranded and desolate, no\r\nfurther advanced on his journey than before.\r\n\r\nThe lightning has not smitten him, nor the waters drowned him, nor has\r\nany stranger vessel borne him to other shores. He is only battered, and\r\nshattered, and weary with the struggle; has lost, perhaps, all he cared\r\nfor, and is permanently disabled for further travelling. Gertrude smiled\r\nto herself as she pursued the little metaphor, then, rising, walked\r\nacross the room to the mirror which hung above the mantelpiece. As her\r\neye fell on her own reflection she remembered Lucy Snowe\'s words--\r\n\r\n"I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning dress, a faded, hollow-eyed\r\nvision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle.... I still felt life\r\nat life\'s sources."\r\n\r\nThat was the worst of it; one was so terribly vital. Inconceivable as it\r\nseemed, she knew that one day she would be up again, fighting the old\r\nfight, not only for existence, but for happiness itself. She was only\r\ntwenty-five when all was said; much lay, indeed, behind her, but there\r\nwas still the greater part of her life to be lived.\r\n\r\nShe started a little as the handle of the door turned, and Mrs. Maryon\r\nannounced Lord Watergate. She gave him her hand with a little smile:\r\n"Have you been in the studio?" she said, as they both seated themselves.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Jermyn opened the door himself, and insisted on my coming in,\r\nthough, to tell you the truth, I should have hesitated about entering\r\nhad I had any choice in the matter--which I hadn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Lucy has picked up wonderfully, hasn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"She looks her old self already. Jermyn tells me they are to be married\r\nalmost immediately."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I suppose they told you also that Lucy is going to carry on the\r\nbusiness afterwards."\r\n\r\n"In the old place?"\r\n\r\n"No. We have got rid of the rest of the lease, and they propose moving\r\ninto some place where studios for both of them can be arranged."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"It is uncertain. I think Lucy will want me for the photography."\r\n\r\n"Miss Lorimer, first of all you must do something to get well. You will\r\nbreak down altogether if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone of the blunt words startled her; she turned away,\r\na nameless terror taking possession of her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be all right after a little holiday."\r\n\r\n"You have been looking after everybody else; doing everybody\'s work,\r\nbearing everybody\'s troubles." He stopped short suddenly, and added,\r\nwith less earnestness, "_Quis custodet custodiem?_ Do you know any\r\nLatin, Miss Lorimer?"\r\n\r\nShe rose involuntarily; then stood rather helplessly before him. It was\r\nridiculous that these two clever people should be so shy and awkward;\r\nthose others down below in the studio had never undergone any such\r\nuncomfortable experience; but then neither had had to graft the new\r\nhappiness on an old sorrow; for neither had the shadow of memory\r\ndarkened hope.\r\n\r\nGertrude went over to the mantelshelf, and began mechanically arranging\r\nsome flowers in a vase. For once, she found Lord Watergate\'s presence\r\ndisturbing and distressing; she was confused, unhappy, distrustful of\r\nherself; she wished when she turned her head that she would find him\r\ngone. But he was standing near her, a look of perplexity, of trouble, in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lorimer," he said, and there was no mistaking the note in his\r\nvoice, "have I come too soon? Is it too soon for me to speak?"\r\n\r\nShe was overwhelmed, astonished, infinitely agitated. Her soul shrank\r\nback afraid. What had the closer human relations ever brought her but\r\nsorrow unutterable, unending? Some blind instinct within her prompted\r\nher words, as she said, lifting her head, with the attitude of one who\r\nwould avert an impending blow--\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is too soon, too soon."\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment looking at her with his deep eyes.\r\n\r\n"I shall come back," he said.\r\n\r\n"No, oh, no!"\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in her hands, and bent her head to the marble. What he\r\noffered was not for her; for other women, for happier women, for better\r\nwomen, perhaps, but not for her.\r\n\r\nWhen she raised her head he was gone.\r\n\r\nThe momentary, unreasonable agitation passed away from her, leaving her\r\ncold as a stone, and she knew what she had done. By a lightning flash\r\nher own heart stood revealed to her. How incredible it seemed, but she\r\nknew that it was true: all this dreary time, when the personal thought\r\nhad seemed so far away from her, her greatest personal experience had\r\nbeen silently growing up--no gourd of a night, but a tree to last\r\nthrough the ages. She, who had been so strong for others, had failed\r\nmiserably for herself.\r\n\r\nLove and happiness had come to her open-handed, and she had sent them\r\naway. Love and happiness? Oh, those will o\' the wisps had danced ere\r\nthis before her cheated sight. Love and happiness? Say rather, pity and\r\na mild peace. It is not love that lets himself be so easily denied.\r\n\r\nHappiness? That was not for such as she; but peace, it would have come\r\nin time; now it was possible that it would never come at all.\r\n\r\nAll the springs of her being had seemed for so long to be frozen at\r\ntheir source; now, in this one brief moment of exaltation, half-rapture,\r\nhalf-despair, the ice melted, and her heart was flooded with the stream.\r\n\r\nCovering her face with her hands, she knelt by his empty chair, and a\r\ngreat cry rose up from her soul:--the human cry for happiness--the\r\nwoman\'s cry for love.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nAT LAST.\r\n\r\n     _We sat when shadows darken,\r\n       And let the shadows be;\r\n     Each was a soul to hearken,\r\n       Devoid of eyes to see.\r\n\r\n     You came at dusk to find me;\r\n       I knew you well enough....\r\n     Oh, Lights that dazzle and blind me--\r\n       It is no friend, but Love!_\r\n                       A. MARY F. ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Hotel Prince de Galles, Cannes, April 27th._\r\n\r\n     My dearest Gerty,--You shall have a letter to-day, though it is\r\n     more than you deserve. Why do you never write to me? Now that you\r\n     have safely married your young people, you have positively no\r\n     excuse. By the by, the poor innocent mater read the announcement of\r\n     the wedding out loud at breakfast to-day.--Fred got crimson and\r\n     choked in his coffee, and I had a silent fit of laughter. However,\r\n     he is all right by now, playing tennis with a mature lady with\r\n     yellow hair, whom he much affects, and whom papa scornfully\r\n     denominates a "hotel hack."\r\n\r\n     All this, let me tell you, is preliminary. I have a piece of news\r\n     for you, but somehow it won\'t come out. Not that it is anything to\r\n     be ashamed of. The fact is, Gerty, I am going the way of all flesh,\r\n     and am about to be married. Believe me, it is the most sensible\r\n     course for a woman to take. I hope you will follow my good example.\r\n\r\n     Do you remember Sapho\'s words: "J\'ai tant aim\xe9; j\'ai besoin d\'\xeatre\r\n     aim\xe9e"? Do not let the quotation shock you; neither take it too\r\n     seriously, I think Mr. Graham--you know Lawrence Graham?--does care\r\n     as caring goes and as men go. He came out here, on purpose, a\r\n     fortnight ago, and yesterday we settled it between us....\r\n\r\n\r\nGertrude read no further; the thin, closely-written sheet fell from her\r\nhand; she sat staring vaguely before her.\r\n\r\nConny\'s letter, with its cheerfulness, partly real, partly affected,\r\nhurt her taste, and depressed her rather unreasonably.\r\n\r\nThis was the hardest feature of her lot: for the people she loved, the\r\npeople who had looked up to her, she had been able to do nothing at all.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting alone in the dismantled studio on this last day of\r\nApril. To-morrow Lucy and Frank would have returned from Cornwall, and\r\nhave taken possession of the new home.\r\n\r\nHer own plans for the present were vague.\r\n\r\nOne of her stories, after various journeys to editorial offices, had at\r\nlast come back to her in the form of proof, supplemented, moreover, by\r\nwhat seemed to her a handsome cheque.\r\n\r\nShe had arranged, on the strength of this, to visit a friend in\r\nFlorence, for some months; after that period she would in all\r\nprobability take part with Lucy in the photography business.\r\n\r\nThere was no fire lighted, and the sun, which in the earlier part of the\r\nday had warmed the room, had set. Most of the furniture and properties\r\nhad already gone to the new studio, but some yet remained, massed and\r\npiled in the gloom.\r\n\r\nThe black sign-board, with its gold lettering, stood upright and forlorn\r\nin a corner, as though conscious that its day was over for ever.\r\nGertrude had been busying herself with turning out a cupboard, but the\r\nlight had failed, and she had ceased from her work.\r\n\r\nA very dark hour came to Gertrude, crouching there in the dusk and cold,\r\namid the dismantled workshop which seemed to symbolize her own life.\r\n\r\nShe who held unhappiness ignoble and cynicism a poor thing, had lost for\r\nthe moment all joy of living and all belief. The little erection of\r\nphilosophy, of hope, of self-reliance, which she had been at such pains\r\nto build, seemed to be crumbling about her ears; all the struggles and\r\nsacrifices of life looked vain things. What had life brought her, but\r\ndisillusion, bitterness, an added sense of weakness?\r\n\r\nShe rose at last and paced the room.\r\n\r\n"This will pass," she said to herself; "I am out of sorts; and it is not\r\nto be wondered at."\r\n\r\nShe sat down in the one empty chair the room contained, and leaning her\r\nhead on her hand, let her thoughts wander at will.\r\n\r\nHer eyes roved about the little dusky room which was so full of memories\r\nfor her. Shadows peopled it; dream-voices filled it with sound.\r\n\r\nLucy and Phyllis and Frank moved hither and thither with jest and\r\nlaughter. Fanny was there too, tampering amiably with the apparatus; and\r\nDarrell looked at her once with cold eyes, although, indeed, he had been\r\na rare visitor at the studio.\r\n\r\nThen all these phantoms faded, and she seemed to see another in their\r\nstead; a man, tall and strong, his face full of anger and sorrow--Lord\r\nWatergate, as he had been on that never-forgotten night. Then the anger\r\nand sorrow faded from his face, and she read there nothing but\r\nlove--love for herself shining from his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen she hid her face, ashamed.\r\n\r\nWhat must he think of her? Perhaps that she scorned his gift, did not\r\nunderstand its value; had therefore withdrawn it in disdain.\r\n\r\nOh, if only she could tell him this:--that it was her very sense of the\r\ngreatness of what he offered that had made her tremble, turn away, and\r\nreject it. One does not stretch out the hand eagerly for so great a\r\ngift.\r\n\r\nShe had told him not to return and he had taken her at her word. She was\r\npaying the penalty, which her sex always pays one way or another, for\r\nher struggles for strength and independence. She was denied, she told\r\nherself with a touch of rueful humour, the gracious feminine privilege\r\nof changing her mind.\r\n\r\nLord Watergate might have loved her more if he had respected her less,\r\nor at least allowed for a little feminine waywardness. Like the rest of\r\nthe world, he had failed to understand her, to see how weak she was, for\r\nall her struggles to be strong.\r\n\r\nShe pushed back the hair from her forehead with the old resolute\r\ngesture. Well, she must learn to be strong in earnest now; the thews and\r\nsinews of the soul, the moral muscles, grow with practice, no less than\r\nthose of the body. She must not sit here brooding, but must rise and\r\nfight the Fates.\r\n\r\nHitherto, perhaps, life had been nothing but failures, but mistakes. It\r\nwas quite possible that the future held nothing better in store for her.\r\nThat was not the question; all that concerned her was to fight the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nShe lit a solitary candle, and began sorting some papers and prints on\r\nthe table near.\r\n\r\n"If he had cared," her thoughts ran on, "he would have come back in\r\nspite of everything."\r\n\r\nDoubtless it had been a mere passing impulse of compassion which had\r\nprompted his words, and he had caught eagerly at her dismissal of him.\r\nOr was it all a delusion on her part? That brief, rapid moment, when he\r\nhad spoken, had it ever existed save in her own imagination? Worst\r\nthought of all, a thought which made her cheek burn scarlet in the\r\nsolitude, had she misinterpreted some simple expression of kindness,\r\nsome frank avowal of sympathy; had she indeed refused what had never\r\nbeen offered?\r\n\r\nShe felt very lonely as she lingered there in the gloom, trying to\r\naccustom herself in thought to the long years of solitude, of\r\ndreariness, which she saw stretching out before her.\r\n\r\nThe world, even when represented by her best friends, had labelled her a\r\nstrong-minded woman. By universal consent she had been cast for the\r\npart, and perforce must go through with it.\r\n\r\nShe heard steps coming up the Virginia cork passage and concluded that\r\nMrs. Maryon was bringing her an expected postcard from Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Come in," she said, not raising her head from the table.\r\n\r\nThe person who had come in was not, however, Mrs. Maryon.\r\n\r\nHe came up to the table with its solitary candle and faced her.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw who it was her heart stood still; then in one brief moment\r\nthe face of the universe had changed for her for ever.\r\n\r\n"Lord Watergate!"\r\n\r\n"I said I would come again. I have come in spite of you. You will not\r\ntell me that I come too soon, or in vain?"\r\n\r\n"You must not think that I did not value what you offered me," she said\r\nsimply, though her voice shook; "that I did not think myself deeply\r\nhonoured. But I was afraid--I have suffered very much."\r\n\r\n"And I.... Oh, Gertrude, my poor child, and I have left you all this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nFor the light, flickering upwards, had shown him her weary, haggard\r\nface; had shown him also the pathetic look of her eyes as they yearned\r\ntowards him in entreaty, in reliance,--in love.\r\n\r\nHe had taken her in his arms, without explanation or apology, holding\r\nher to his breast as one holds a tired child.\r\n\r\nAnd she, looking up into his face, into the lucid depths of his eyes,\r\nfelt all that was mean and petty and bitter in life fade away into\r\nnothingness; while all that was good and great and beautiful gathered\r\nnew meaning and became the sole realities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little more to tell of the people who have figured in this\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nFanny continues to flourish at Notting Hill, the absence of children\r\nbeing the one drop in her cup and that of her husband.\r\n\r\n"But, perhaps," as Lucy privately remarks, "it is as well; for I don\'t\r\nthink the Marshes would have understood how to bring up a child."\r\n\r\nFor Lucy, in common with all young matrons of the day, has decided views\r\non matters concerned with the mental, moral, and physical culture of the\r\nyoung. Unlike many thinkers, she does not hesitate to put her theories\r\ninto practice, and the two small occupants of her nursery bear witness\r\nto excellent training.\r\n\r\nThe photography, however, has not been crowded out by domestic duties;\r\nand no infant with pretensions to fashion omits to present itself before\r\nMrs. Jermyn\'s lens. Lucy has succumbed to the modern practice of\r\nspecialising, and only the other day carried off a medal for photographs\r\nof young children from an industrial exhibition. Her husband is no less\r\nsuccessful in his own line. Having permanently abandoned the paint-brush\r\nfor the needle, he bids fair to take a high place among the black and\r\nwhite artists of the day.\r\n\r\nThe Watergates have also an addition to their household, in the shape of\r\na stout person with rosy cheeks and stiff white petticoats, who receives\r\na great deal of attention from his parents. Gertrude wonders if he will\r\nprove to have inherited his father\'s scientific tastes, or the literary\r\ntendencies of his mother. She devoutly hopes that it is the former.\r\n\r\nConny flourishes as a married woman no less than as a girl. She and the\r\nJermyns dine out now and then at one another\'s houses; her old affection\r\nfor Gertrude continues, in spite of the fact that their respective\r\nhusbands are quite unable (as she says) to hit it off.\r\n\r\nFred has not yet married; but there is no reason to believe him\r\ninconsolable. It is rather the embarrassment of choice than any other\r\nmotive which keeps him single.\r\n\r\nAunt Caroline, having married all her daughters to her satisfaction,\r\ncontinues to reign supreme in certain circles at Lancaster Gate. She\r\nspeaks with the greatest respect of her niece, Lady Watergate, though\r\nshe has been heard to comment unfavourably on the shabbiness of the\r\nfurniture in Sussex Place.\r\n\r\nAs for Darrell, shortly after Phyllis\'s death, he went to India at the\r\ninvitation of the Viceroy and remained there nearly two years.\r\n\r\nIt was only the other day that the Watergates came face to face with\r\nhim. It was at a big dinner, where the most distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of art and science and literature were met. Gertrude\r\nturned pale when she saw him, losing the thread of her discourse, and\r\nher appetite, despite her husband\'s reassuring glances down the table.\r\n\r\nBut Darrell went on eating his dinner and looking into his neighbour\'s\r\neyes, in apparent unconsciousness of, or unconcern at, the Watergates\'\r\nproximity.\r\n\r\nThe Maryons continue in the old premises, increasing their balance at\r\nthe banker\'s, and enlarging their experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe Photographic Studio is let to an enterprising young photographer,\r\nwho has enlarged and beautified it beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nAs for the rooms above the umbrella-maker\'s: the sitting-room facing the\r\nstreet; the three-cornered kitchen behind; the three little bed-rooms\r\nbeyond;--when last I passed the house they were to let unfurnished, with\r\ngreat fly-blown bills in the blank casements.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gresham Press,\r\nUNWIN BROTHERS,\r\nCHILWORTH AND LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Romance of a Shop, by Amy Levy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ROMANCE OF A SHOP ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 57447-8.txt or 57447-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/4/4/57447/\r\n\r\nProduced by MWS, Martin Pettit and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\r\nproduced from images generously made available by The\r\nInternet Archive/American Libraries.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
