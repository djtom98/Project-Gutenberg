"I will get out," he repeated, as his hansom\r\ntook him swiftly from the house in Portman Square, where he had been\r\ndining, towards that other house in Carlton House Terrace, whither his\r\nthoughts had travelled on before him, out-distancing the\r\n_trip-clip-clop, trip-clip-clop_ of the horse.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot night in June. Hugh had thrown back his overcoat, and the\r\nthrong of passers-by in the street could see, if they cared to see, "the\r\nglass of fashion" in the shape of white waistcoat and shirt front,\r\nsurmounted by the handsome, irritated face of their owner, leaning back\r\nwith his hat tilted over his eyes.\r\n\r\n_Trip-clip-clop_ went the horse.\r\n\r\nA great deal of thinking may be compressed into a quarter of an hour,\r\nespecially if it has been long eluded.\r\n\r\n"I will get out," he said again to himself with an impatient movement.\r\nIt was beginning to weary him, this commonplace intrigue which had been\r\nso new and alluring a year ago. He did not own it to himself, but he\r\nwas tired of it. Perhaps the reason why good resolutions have earned for\r\nthemselves such an evil repute as paving-stones is because they are\r\noften the result, not of repentance, but of the restlessness that dogs\r\nan evaporating pleasure. This liaison had been alternately his pride and\r\nhis shame for many months. But now it was becoming something more--which\r\nit had been all the time, only he had not noticed it till lately--a\r\nfetter, a clog, something irksome, to be cast off and pushed out of\r\nsight. Decidedly the moment for the good resolution had arrived.\r\n\r\n"I will break it off," he said again. "Thank Heaven, not a soul has ever\r\nguessed it."\r\n\r\nHow could any one have guessed it?\r\n\r\nHe remembered the day when he had first met her a year ago, and had\r\nlooked upon her as merely a pretty woman. He remembered other days, and\r\nthe gradual building up between them of a fairy palace. He had added a\r\nstone here, she a stone there, until suddenly it became--a prison. Had\r\nhe been tempter or tempted? He did not know. He did not care. He wanted\r\nonly to be out of it. His better feelings and his conscience had been\r\nawakened by the first touch of weariness. His brief infatuation had run\r\nits course. His judgment had been whirled--he told himself it had been\r\nwhirled, but it had really only been tweaked--from its centre, had\r\nperformed its giddy orbit, and now the check-string had brought it back\r\nto the point from whence it had set out, namely, that she was merely a\r\npretty woman.\r\n\r\n"I will break with her gradually," he said, like the tyro he was, and he\r\npictured to himself the wretched scenes in which she would abuse him,\r\nreproach him, probably compromise herself, the letters she would write\r\nto him. At any rate, he need not read them. Oh! how tired he was of the\r\nwhole thing beforehand. Why had he been such a fool? He looked at the\r\ntermination of the liaison as a bad sailor looks at an inevitable sea\r\npassage at the end of a journey. It must be gone through, but the\r\nprospect of undergoing it filled him with disgust.\r\n\r\nA brougham passed him swiftly on noiseless wheels, and the woman in it\r\ncaught a glimpse of the high-bred, clean-shaved face, half savage, half\r\nsullen, in the hansom.\r\n\r\n"Anger, impatience, and remorse," she said to herself, and finished\r\nbuttoning her gloves.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven, not a soul has ever guessed it," repeated Hugh,\r\nfervently, as the hansom came suddenly to a stand-still.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was taking Lady Newhaven\'s hand as she stood at the\r\nentrance of her amber drawing-room beside a grove of pink orchids.\r\n\r\nHe chatted a moment, greeted Lord Newhaven, and passed on into the\r\ncrowded rooms. How could any one have guessed it? No breath of scandal\r\nhad ever touched Lady Newhaven. She stood beside her pink orchids, near\r\nher fatigued-looking, gentle-mannered husband, a very pretty woman in\r\nwhite satin and diamonds. Perhaps her blond hair was a shade darker at\r\nthe roots than in its waved coils; perhaps her blue eyes did not look\r\nquite in harmony with their blue-black lashes; but the whole effect had\r\nthe delicate, conventional perfection of a cleverly touched-up\r\nchromo-lithograph. Of course, tastes differ. Some people like\r\nchromo-lithographs, others don\'t. But even those who do are apt to\r\nbecome estranged. They may inspire love, admiration, but never fidelity.\r\nMost of us have in our time hammered nails into our walls which, though\r\nthey now decorously support the engravings and etchings of our maturer\r\nyears, were nevertheless originally driven in to uphold the cherished,\r\nthe long since discarded chromos of our foolish youth.\r\n\r\nThe diamond sun upon Lady Newhaven\'s breast quivered a little, a very\r\nlittle, as Hugh greeted her, and she turned to offer the same small\r\nsmile and gloved hand to the next comer, whose name was leaping before\r\nhim from one footman to another.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Richard Vernon."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven\'s wide blue eyes looked vague. Her hand hesitated. This\r\nstrongly built, ill-dressed man, with his keen, brown, deeply scarred\r\nface and crooked mouth, was unknown to her.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven darted forward.\r\n\r\n"Dick!" he exclaimed, and Dick shot forth an immense mahogany hand and\r\nshook Lord Newhaven\'s warmly.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, after Lord Newhaven had introduced him to his wife,\r\n"I\'m dashed if I knew who either of you were. But I found your\r\ninvitation at my club when I landed yesterday, so I decided to come and\r\nhave a look at you. And so it is only you, Cackles, after all"--(Lord\r\nNewhaven\'s habit of silence had earned for him the sobriquet of\r\n"Cackles")--"I quite thought I was going into--well, ahem!--into\r\nsociety. I did not know you had got a handle to your name. How did you\r\nfind out I was in England?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, I didn\'t," said Lord Newhaven, gently drawing Dick\r\naside, whose back was serenely blocking a stream of new arrivals. "I\r\nfancy--in fact, I\'m simply delighted to see you. How is the wine getting\r\non? But I suppose there must be other Dick Vernons on my wife\'s list.\r\nHave you the card with you?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Dick; "always take the card with me since I was kicked\r\nout of a miner\'s hop at Broken Hill because I forgot it. \'No gentleman\r\nwill be admitted in a paper shirt\' was mentioned on it, I remember. A\r\nconcertina, and candles in bottles. Ripping while it lasted. I wish you\r\nhad been there."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had." Lord Newhaven\'s tired, half-closed eye opened a little.\r\n"But the end seems to have been unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Dick, watching the new arrivals with his head thrown\r\nback. "Fine girl that; I\'ll take a look at the whole mob of them\r\ndirectly. They came round next day to say it had been a mistake, but\r\nthere were four or five cripples who found that out the night before.\r\nHere is the card."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven glanced at it attentively, and then laughed.\r\n\r\n"It is four years old," he said; "I must have put you on my mother\'s\r\nlist, not knowing you had left London. It is in her writing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m rather late," said Dick, composedly; "but I am here at last. Now,\r\nCack--Newhaven, if that\'s your noble name--as I am here, trot out a few\r\nheiresses, would you? I want to take one or two back with me. I say,\r\nought I to put my gloves on?"\r\n\r\n"No, no. Clutch them in your great fist as you are doing now."\r\n\r\n"Thanks. I suppose, old chap, I\'m all right? Not had on an evening-coat\r\nfor four years."\r\n\r\nDick\'s trousers were too short for him, and he had tied his white tie\r\nwith a waist to it. Lord Newhaven had seen both details before he\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\n"Quite right," he said, hastily. "Now, who is to be the happy woman?"\r\n\r\nDick\'s hawk eye promenaded over the crowd in the second room, in the\r\ndoor-way of which he was standing.\r\n\r\n"That one," he said; "the tall girl in the green gown talking to the\r\nBishop."\r\n\r\n"You have a wonderful eye for heiresses. You have picked out the\r\ngreatest in London. That is Miss Rachel West. You say you want two."\r\n\r\n"One at a time, thanks. I shall take her down to supper. I\r\nsuppose--er--there is supper at this sort of thing, isn\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"Of a kind. You need not be afraid of the claret; it isn\'t yours."\r\n\r\n"Catch you giving your best at a crush," retorted Dick. "The Bishop\'s\r\nmoving. Hurry up."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     But as he groped against the wall, two hands upon him fell,\r\n     The King behind his shoulder spake: "Dead man, thou dost not well."\r\n                                                      --RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHugh had gone through the first room, and, after a quarter of an hour,\r\nfound himself in the door-way of the second. He had arrived late, and\r\nthe rooms were already thinning.\r\n\r\nA woman in a pale-green gown was standing near the open window, her\r\nwhite profile outlined against the framed darkness, as she listened with\r\nevident amusement to the tall, ill-dressed man beside her.\r\n\r\nHugh\'s eyes lost the veiled scorn with which it was their wont to look\r\nat society and the indulgent patronage which lurked in them for pretty\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nRachel West slowly turned her face towards him without seeing him, and\r\nhis heart leaped. She was not beautiful except with the beauty of\r\nhealth, and a certain dignity of carriage which is the outcome of a head\r\nand hands and body that are at unity with each other, and with a mind\r\nabsolutely unconscious of self. She had not the long nose which so\r\nfrequently usurps more than its share of the faces of the well-bred, nor\r\nhad she, alas! the short upper lip which redeems everything. Her\r\nfeatures were as insignificant as her coloring. People rarely noticed\r\nthat Rachel\'s hair was brown, and that her deep-set eyes were gray. But\r\nupon her grave face the word "Helper" was plainly written--and something\r\nelse. What was it?\r\n\r\nJust as in the faces of seamen we trace the onslaught of storm and sun\r\nand brine, and the puckering of the skin round the eyes that comes of\r\nlong watching in half-lights, so in some faces, calm and pure as\r\nRachel\'s, on which the sun and rain have never beaten, there is an\r\nexpression betokening strong resistance from within of the brunt of a\r\nwhirlwind from without. The marks of conflict and endurance on a young\r\nface--who shall see them unmoved! The Mother of Jesus must have noticed\r\na great difference in her Son when she first saw Him again after the\r\ntemptation in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s grave, amused glance fell upon Hugh. Their eyes met, and he\r\ninstantly perceived, to his astonishment, that she recognized him. But\r\nshe did not bow, and a moment later left the nearly empty rooms with the\r\nman who was talking to her.\r\n\r\nHugh was excited out of recognition of his former half-scornful,\r\nhalf-_blas\xe9_ self. That woman must be his wife. She would save him from\r\nhimself, this cynical, restless self, which never remained in one stay.\r\nThe half-acknowledged weakness in his nature unconsciously flung itself\r\nupon her strength, a strength which had been tried. She would love him,\r\nand uphold him. There would be no more yielding to circumstances if that\r\npure, strong soul were close beside him. He would lean upon her, and the\r\nugly by-paths of these last years would know him no more. Her presence\r\nwould leaven his whole life. In the momentary insanity, which was\r\nperhaps, after all, only a prophetic intuition, he had no fears, no\r\nmisgivings. He thought that with that face it was not possible that she\r\ncould be so wicked as to refuse him.\r\n\r\n"She will marry me," he said to himself. "She must."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven touched him gently on the arm.\r\n\r\n"I dared not speak to you before," she said. "Nearly every one has gone.\r\nWill you take me down to supper? I am tired out."\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, not recognizing her.\r\n\r\n"Have I vexed you?" she faltered.\r\n\r\nAnd with a sudden horrible revulsion of feeling he remembered. The poor\r\nchromo had fallen violently from its nail. But the nail remained--ready.\r\nHe took her into the supper-room and got her a glass of champagne. She\r\nsubsided on to a sofa beside another woman, vaguely suspecting trouble\r\nin the air. He felt thankful that Rachel had already gone. Dick, nearly\r\nthe last, was putting on his coat, arranging to meet Lord Newhaven the\r\nfollowing morning at his club. They had been in Australia together, and\r\nwere evidently old friends.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven\'s listless manner returned as Dick marched out. Hugh had\r\ngot one arm in his coat. An instinct of flight possessed him, a vague\r\nhorror of the woman in diamonds furtively watching him under her lowered\r\neyelids through the open door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Scarlett!" said Lord Newhaven, detaining him languidly, "I want\r\nthree minutes of your valuable time. Come into my study."\r\n\r\n"Another cross-bow for Westhope Abbey?" said Hugh, trying to speak\r\nunconcernedly, as he followed his host to a back room on the ground\r\nfloor. Lord Newhaven was collecting arms for the hall of his\r\ncountry-house.\r\n\r\n"No; much simpler than those elaborate machines," said the older man,\r\nturning on the electric light. Hugh went in, and Lord Newhaven closed\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nOver the mantel-shelf were hung a few old Japanese inlaid carbines, and\r\nbeneath them an array of pistols.\r\n\r\n"Useless now," said Lord Newhaven, touching them affectionately. "But,"\r\nhe added, with a shade more listlessness than before, "Society has\r\nbecome accustomed to do without them, and does ill without them, but we\r\nmust conform to her." Hugh started slightly, and then remained\r\nmotionless. "You observe these two paper lighters, Scarlett? One is an\r\ninch shorter than the other. They have been waiting on the mantel-shelf\r\nfor the last month, till I had an opportunity of drawing your attention\r\nto them. I am sure we perfectly understand each other. No name need be\r\nmentioned. All scandal is avoided. I feel confident you will not\r\nhesitate to make me the only reparation one man can make another in the\r\nsomewhat hackneyed circumstances in which we find ourselves."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven took the lighters out of the glass. He glanced suddenly at\r\nHugh\'s stunned face and went on:\r\n\r\n"I am sorry the idea is not my own. I read it in a magazine. Though\r\ncomparatively modern, it promises soon to become as customary as the\r\nmuch-to-be-regretted pistols for two and coffee for four. I hold the\r\nlighters thus, and you draw. Whoever draws or keeps the short one is\r\npledged to leave this world within four months, or shall we say five, on\r\naccount of the pheasant shooting? Five be it. Is it agreed? Just so!\r\nWill you draw?"\r\n\r\nA swift spasm passed over Hugh\'s face, and a tiger glint leaped into\r\nLord Newhaven\'s eyes, fixed intently upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief second in which Hugh\'s mind wavered, as the flame of a\r\ncandle wavers in a sudden draught. Lord Newhaven\'s eyes glittered. He\r\nadvanced the lighters an inch nearer.\r\n\r\nIf he had not advanced them that inch Hugh thought afterwards that he\r\nwould have refused to draw.\r\n\r\nHe backed against the mantel-piece, and then put out his hand suddenly\r\nand drew. It seemed the only way of escape.\r\n\r\nThe two men measured the lighters on the table under the electric light.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven laughed.\r\n\r\nHugh stood a moment, and then went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     "Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband?"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Newhaven slipped out of the supper-room after her husband and\r\nHugh, and lingered at the door of the study, she did not follow them\r\nwith the deliberate intention of eavesdropping, but from a vague impulse\r\nof suspicious anxiety. Yet she crouched in her white satin gown against\r\nthe door listening intently.\r\n\r\nNeither man moved within, only one spoke. There was no other sound to\r\ndeaden her husband\'s distinct, low voice. The silence that followed his\r\nlast words, "Will you draw?" was broken by his laugh, and she had barely\r\ntime to throw herself back from the door into a dark recess under the\r\nstaircase before Hugh came out. He almost touched her as he passed. He\r\nmust have seen her, if he had been capable of seeing anything; but he\r\nwent straight on unheeding. And as she stole a few steps to gaze after\r\nhim, she saw him cross the hall and go out into the night without his\r\nhat and coat, the amazed servants staring after him.\r\n\r\nShe drew back to go up-stairs, and met her husband coming slowly out of\r\nthe study. He looked steadily at her, as she clung trembling to the\r\nbanisters. There was no alteration in his glance, and she suddenly\r\nperceived that what he knew now he had always known. She put her hand to\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"You look tired," he said, in the level voice to which she was\r\naccustomed. "You had better go to bed."\r\n\r\nShe stumbled swiftly up-stairs, catching at the banisters, and went into\r\nher own room.\r\n\r\nHer maid was waiting for her by the dressing-table with its shaded\r\nelectric lights. And she remembered that she had given a party, and that\r\nshe had on her diamonds.\r\n\r\nIt would take a long time to unfasten them. She pulled at the diamond\r\nsun on her breast with a shaking hand. Her husband had given it to her\r\nwhen her eldest son was born. Her maid took the tiara gently out of her\r\nhair, and cut the threads that sewed the diamonds on her breast and\r\nshoulders. Would it never end? The lace of her gown, cautiously\r\nwithdrawn through its hundred eyelet-holes, knotted itself.\r\n\r\n"Cut it," she said, impatiently. "Cut it."\r\n\r\nAt last she was in her dressing-gown and alone. She flung herself face\r\ndownwards on the sofa. Her attitude had the touch of artificiality which\r\nwas natural to her.\r\n\r\nThe deluge had arrived, and unconsciously she met it, as she would have\r\nmade a heroine meet it had she been a novelist, in a white dressing-gown\r\nand pink ribbons in a stereotyped attitude of despair on a divan.\r\n\r\nConscience is supposed to make cowards of us all, but it is a matter of\r\ncommon experience that the unimaginative are made cowards of only by\r\nbeing found out.\r\n\r\nHad David qualms of conscience when Uriah fell before the besieged city?\r\nSurely if he had he would have winced at the obvious parallel of the\r\nprophet\'s story about the ewe lamb. But apparently he remained serenely\r\nobtuse till the indignant author\'s "Thou art the man" unexpectedly\r\nnailed him to the cross of his sin.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with Lady Newhaven. She had gone through the twenty-seven\r\nyears of her life believing herself to be a religious and virtuous\r\nperson. She was so accustomed to the idea that it had become a habit,\r\nand now the whole of her self-respect was in one wrench torn from her.\r\nThe events of the last year had not worn it down to its last shred, had\r\nnot even worn the nap off. It was dragged from her intact, and the shock\r\nleft her faint and shuddering.\r\n\r\nThe thought that her husband knew, and had thought fit to conceal his\r\nknowledge, had never entered her mind, any more than the probability\r\nthat she had been seen by some of the servants kneeling listening at a\r\nkeyhole. The mistake which all unobservant people make is to assume that\r\nothers are as unobservant as themselves.\r\n\r\nBy what frightful accident, she asked herself, had this catastrophe come\r\nabout? She thought of all the obvious incidents which would have\r\nrevealed the secret to herself--the dropped letter, the altered\r\ncountenance, the badly arranged lie. No. She was convinced her secret\r\nhad been guarded with minute, with scrupulous care. The only thing she\r\nhad forgotten in her calculations was her husband\'s character, if,\r\nindeed, she could be said to have forgotten that which she had never\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven was in his wife\'s eyes a very quiet man of few words. That\r\nhis few words did not represent the whole of him had never occurred to\r\nher. She had often told her friends that he walked through life with his\r\neyes shut. He had a trick of half shutting his eyes which confirmed her\r\nin this opinion. When she came across persons who were after a time\r\ndiscovered to have affections and interests of which they had not\r\nspoken, she described them as "cunning." She had never thought Edward\r\n"cunning" till to-night. How had he, of all men, discovered\r\nthis--this--? She, had no words ready to call her conduct by, though\r\nwords would not have failed her had she been denouncing the same conduct\r\nin another wife and mother.\r\n\r\nGradually "the whole horror of her situation"--to borrow from her own\r\nvocabulary--forced itself upon her mind like damp through a gay\r\nwall-paper. What did it matter how the discovery had been made! It was\r\nmade, and she was ruined. She repeated the words between little gasps\r\nfor breath. Ruined! Her reputation lost! Hers--Violet Newhaven\'s. It was\r\na sheer impossibility that such a thing could have happened to a woman\r\nlike her. It was some vile slander which Edward must see to. He was good\r\nat that sort of thing. But no, Edward would not help her. She had\r\ncommitted--She flung out her hands, panic-stricken, as if to ward off a\r\nblow. The deed had brought with it no shame, but the word--the word\r\nwounded her like a sword.\r\n\r\nHer feeble mind, momentarily stunned, pursued its groping way.\r\n\r\nHe would divorce her. It would be in the papers. But no. What was that\r\nhe had said to Hugh--"No names to be mentioned; all scandal avoided."\r\n\r\nShe shivered and drew in her breath. It was to be settled some other\r\nway. Her mind became an entire blank. Another way! What way? She\r\nremembered now, and an inarticulate cry broke from her. They had drawn\r\nlots.\r\n\r\n_Which had drawn the short lighter?_\r\n\r\nHer husband had laughed. But then he laughed at everything. He was never\r\nreally serious, always shallow and heartless. He would have laughed if\r\nhe had drawn it himself. Perhaps he had. Yes, he certainly had drawn it.\r\nBut Hugh? She saw again the white, set face as he passed her. No; it\r\nmust be Hugh who had drawn it--Hugh, whom she loved. She wrung her hands\r\nand moaned, half aloud:\r\n\r\n"Which? Which?"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight movement in the next room, the door was opened, and\r\nLord Newhaven appeared in the door-way. He was still in evening dress.\r\n\r\n"Did you call?" he said, quietly. "Are you ill?" He came and stood\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, hoarsely, and she sat up and gazed fixedly at him.\r\nDespair and suspense were in her eyes. There was no change in his, and\r\nshe remembered that she had never seen him angry. Perhaps she had not\r\nknown when he was angry.\r\n\r\nHe was turning away, but she stopped him. "Wait," she said, and he\r\nreturned, his cold, attentive eye upon her. There was no contempt, no\r\nindignation in his bearing. If those feelings had shaken him, it must\r\nhave been some time ago. If they had been met and vanquished in secret,\r\nthat also must have been some time ago. He took up an _Imitation of\r\nChrist_, bound in the peculiar shade of lilac which at that moment\r\nprevailed, and turned it in his hand.\r\n\r\n"You are overwrought," he said, after a moment\'s pause, "and I\r\nparticularly dislike a scene."\r\n\r\nShe did not heed him.\r\n\r\n"I listened at the door," she said, in a harsh, unnatural voice.\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly aware of it."\r\n\r\nA sort of horror seemed to have enveloped the familiar room. The very\r\nfurniture looked like well-known words arranged suddenly in some new and\r\ndreadful meaning.\r\n\r\n"You never loved me," she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but he looked gravely at her for a moment, and she\r\nwas ashamed.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you divorce me if you think me so wicked?"\r\n\r\n"For the sake of the children," he said, with a slight change of voice.\r\n\r\nTeddy, the eldest, had been born in this room. Did either remember that\r\ngray morning six years ago?\r\n\r\nThere was a silence that might be felt.\r\n\r\n"Who drew the short lighter?" she whispered, before she knew that she\r\nhad spoken.\r\n\r\n"I am not here to answer questions," he replied. "And I have asked none.\r\nNeither, you will observe, have I blamed you. But I desire that you will\r\nnever again allude to this subject, and that you will keep in mind that\r\nI do not intend to discuss it with you."\r\n\r\nHe laid down the _Imitation_ and moved towards his own room.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement she flung herself upon her knees before him and\r\ncaught his arm. The attitude suggested an amateur.\r\n\r\n"Which drew the short lighter?" she gasped, her small upturned face\r\nwhite and convulsed.\r\n\r\n"You will know in five months\' time," he said. Then he extricated\r\nhimself from her trembling clasp and left the room, closing the door\r\nquietly behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one!\r\n                                               --RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Hugh awoke the morning after Lady Newhaven\'s party the day was\r\nalready far advanced. A hot day had succeeded to a hot night. For a few\r\nseconds he lay like one emerging from the influence of morphia, who\r\nfeels his racked body still painlessly afloat on a sea of rest, but is\r\nconscious that it is drifting back to the bitter shores of pain, and who\r\nstirs neither hand nor foot for fear of hastening the touch of the\r\nencircling, aching sands on which he is so soon to be cast in agony once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHis mind cleared a little. Rachel\'s grave face stood out against a dark\r\nbackground--a background darker surely than that of the summer night. He\r\nremembered with self-contempt the extravagant emotion which she had\r\naroused in him.\r\n\r\n"Absurd," Hugh said to himself, with the distrust of all sudden springs\r\nof pure emotion which those who have misused them rarely escape. And\r\nthen another remembrance, which only a sleeping-draught had kept at bay,\r\ndarted upon him like a panther on its prey.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn the short lighter.\r\n\r\nHe started violently, and then fell back trembling.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" he said, involuntarily.\r\n\r\nHe lay still, telling himself that this dreadful nightmare would pass,\r\nwould fade in the light of common day.\r\n\r\nHis servant came in noiselessly with a cup of coffee and a little sheaf\r\nof letters.\r\n\r\nHe pretended to be asleep; but when the man had gone he put out his\r\nshaking hand for the coffee and drank it.\r\n\r\nThe mist before his mind gradually lifted. Gradually, too, the horror on\r\nhis face whitened to despair, as a twilight meadow whitens beneath the\r\nevening frost. He had drawn the short lighter. Nothing in heaven or\r\nearth could alter that fact.\r\n\r\nHe did not stop to wonder how Lord Newhaven had become aware of his own\r\ndishonor, or at the strange weapon with which he had avenged himself. He\r\nwent over every detail of his encounter with him in the study. His hand\r\nhad been forced. He had been thrust into a vile position. He ought to\r\nhave refused to draw. He did not agree to draw. Nevertheless, he had\r\ndrawn. And Hugh knew that, if it had to be done again, he should again\r\nhave been compelled to draw by the iron will before which his was as\r\nstraw. He could not have met the scorn of those terrible half-closed\r\neyes if he had refused.\r\n\r\n"There was no help for it," said Hugh, half aloud. And yet to die by his\r\nown hand within five months! It was incredible. It was preposterous.\r\n\r\n"I never agreed to it," he said, passionately.\r\n\r\n_Nevertheless, he had drawn_. The remembrance ever returned to lay its\r\ncold hand upon his heart, and with it came the grim conviction that if\r\nLord Newhaven had drawn the short lighter he would have carried out the\r\nagreement to the letter. Whether it was extravagant, unchristian,\r\nwhatever might have been truly said of that unholy compact, Lord\r\nNewhaven would have stood by it.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must stand by it, too," said Hugh to himself, the cold\r\nsweat breaking out on his forehead. "I suppose I am bound in honor to\r\nstand by it, too."\r\n\r\nHe suffered his mind to regard the alternative.\r\n\r\nTo wrong a man as deeply as he had wronged Lord Newhaven; to tacitly\r\naccept. That was where his mistake had been. Another man, that\r\nmahogany-faced fellow with the colonial accent, would have refused to\r\ndraw, and would have knocked Lord Newhaven down and half killed him, or\r\nwould have been knocked down and half killed by him. But to tacitly\r\naccept a means by which the injured man risked his life to avenge his\r\nhonor, and then afterwards to shirk the fate which a perfectly even\r\nchance had thrown upon him instead of on his antagonist! It was too\r\nmean, too despicable. Hugh\'s pale cheek burned.\r\n\r\n"I am bound," he said slowly to himself over and over again. There was\r\nno way of escape.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, with some intuition of coming peril, he had said, "I\r\nwill get out." The way of retreat had been open behind him. Now, by one\r\nslight movement, he was cut off from it forever.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get out," said the starling, the feathers on its breast worn\r\naway with beating against the bars.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get out," said Hugh, coming for the first time in contact with\r\nthe bars which he was to know so well--the bars of the prison that he\r\nhad made with his own hands.\r\n\r\nHe looked into the future with blank eyes. He had no future now. He\r\nstared vacantly in front of him like a man who looks through his window\r\nat the wide expanse of meadow and waving wood and distant hill which has\r\nmet his eye every morning of his life and finds it--gone. It was\r\nincredible. He turned giddy. His reeling mind, shrinking back from the\r\nabyss, struck against a fixed point, and, clutching it, came violently\r\nto a stand-still.\r\n\r\n_His mother!_\r\n\r\nHis mother was a widow and he was her only son. If he died by his own\r\nhand it would break her heart. Hugh groaned, and thrust the thought from\r\nhim. It was too sharp. He could not suffer it.\r\n\r\nHis sin, not worse than that of many another man, had found him out. He\r\nhad done wrong. He admitted it, but this monstrous judgment on him was\r\nout of all proportion to his offence. And, like some malignant\r\ninfectious disease, retribution would fall, not on him alone, but on\r\nthose nearest him, on his innocent mother and sister. It was unjust,\r\nunjust, unjust!\r\n\r\nA very bitter look came into his face. Hugh had never so far hated any\r\none, but now something very like hatred welled up in his heart against\r\nLady Newhaven. She had lured him to his destruction. She had tempted\r\nhim. This was undoubtedly true, though not probably the view which her\r\nguardian angel would take of the matter.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters which the servant had brought him he suddenly\r\nrecognized that the topmost was in Lady Newhaven\'s handwriting. Anger\r\nand repulsion seized him. No doubt it was the first of a series. "Why\r\nwas he so altered? What had she done to offend him?" etc., etc. He knew\r\nthe contents beforehand, or thought he knew them. He got up\r\ndeliberately, threw the unopened note into the empty fireplace, and put\r\na match to it. He watched it burn.\r\n\r\nIt was his first overt act of rebellion against her yoke, the first step\r\nalong the nearest of the many well-worn paths that a man takes at random\r\nto leave a woman. It did not occur to him that Lady Newhaven might have\r\nwritten to him about his encounter with her husband. He knew Lord\r\nNewhaven well enough to be absolutely certain that he would mention the\r\nsubject to no living creature, least of all to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Neither will I," he said to himself; "and as for her, I will break with\r\nher from this day forward."\r\n\r\nThe little pink notes with the dashing, twirly handwriting persisted for\r\na week or two and then ceased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHugh was a man of many social engagements. His first impulse, when later\r\nin the day he remembered them, was to throw them all up and leave\r\nLondon. But Lord Newhaven would hear of his departure, and would smile.\r\nHe decided to remain and to go on as if nothing had happened. When the\r\nevening came he dressed with his usual care, verified the hour of his\r\nengagement, and went out to dine with the Loftuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     What the _Bandar-log_ think now the jungle will think later.\r\n                     --Maxim of the _Bandar-log_, RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sybell Loftus\'s first season in London since her second marriage\r\nwith Mr. Doll Loftus. After a very brief sojourn in that city of\r\nfrivolity she had the acumen to discover that London society was\r\nhopelessly worldly and mercenary; that people only met to eat and to\r\nabuse each other; that the law of cutlet for cutlet was universal; that\r\nyoung men, especially those in the Guards, were garrisoned by a full\r\ncomplement of devils; that London girls lived only for dress and the\r\nexcitement of husband-hunting. In short, to use her own expression, she\r\n"turned London society inside out."\r\n\r\nLondon bore the process with equanimity, and presently Sybell determined\r\nto raise the art of dinner-giving from the low estate to which she\r\navowed it had fallen to a higher level. She was young, she was pretty,\r\nshe was well-born, she was rich. All the social doors were open to her.\r\nBut one discovery is often only the prelude to another. She soon made\r\nthe further one that in order to raise the tone of social gatherings it\r\nis absolutely necessary to infuse into them a leaven of "clever people."\r\nFurther light on this interesting subject showed her that most of the\r\nreally "clever people" did not belong to her set. The discovery which\r\nall who love adulation quickly make--namely, that the truly appreciative\r\nand sympathetic and gifted are for the greater part to be found in a\r\nclass below their own--was duly made and registered by Sybell. She\r\navowed that class differences were nothing to her with the enthusiasm of\r\nall those who since the world began have preferred to be first in the\r\nsociety which they gather round them.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Sybell she was not troubled by doubts respecting the\r\nclearness of her own judgment. Eccentricity was in her eyes originality;\r\na wholesale contradiction of established facts was a new view. She had\r\nnot the horrid perception of difference between the real and the\r\nimitation which spoils the lives of many. She was equally delighted with\r\nboth, and remained in blissful ignorance of the fact that her "deep"\r\nconversation was felt to be exhaustingly superficial if by chance she\r\ncame across the real artist or thinker instead of his counterfeit.\r\n\r\nConsequently to her house came the _rat\xe9_ in all his most virulent\r\ndevelopments; the "new woman" with stupendous lopsided opinions on\r\ndifficult Old Testament subjects; the "lady authoress" with a mission to\r\nshow up the vices of a society which she knew only by hearsay. Hither\r\ncame, unwittingly, simple-minded Church dignitaries, who, Sybell hoped,\r\nmight influence for his good the young agnostic poet who had written a\r\nsonnet on her muff-chain, a very daring sonnet, which Doll, who did not\r\ncare for poetry, had not been shown. Hither, by mistake, thinking it was\r\nan ordinary dinner-party, came Hugh, whom Sybell said she had\r\ndiscovered, and who was not aware that he was in need of discovery. And\r\nhither also on this particular evening came Rachel West, whom Sybell had\r\npronounced to be very intelligent a few days before, and who was\r\nserenely unconscious that she was present on her probation, and that if\r\nshe did not say something striking she would never be asked again.\r\n\r\nDoll Loftus, Sybell\'s husband, was standing by Rachel when Hugh came in.\r\nHe felt drawn towards her because she was not "clever," as far as her\r\nappearance went. At any rate, she had not the touzled, ill-groomed hair\r\nwhich he had learned to associate with female genius.\r\n\r\n"This sort of thing is beyond me," he said, mournfully, to Rachel, his\r\neyes travelling over the assembly gathered round his wife, whose remarks\r\nwere calling forth admiring laughter. "I don\'t understand half they\r\nsay, and when I do I sometimes wish I didn\'t. But I suppose--"\r\ntentatively--"You go in for all this sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"I?" said Rachel, astonished. "I don\'t go in for anything. But what sort\r\nof thing do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"There is Scarlett," said Doll, with relief, who hated definitions, and\r\nfelt the conversation was on the slippery verge of becoming deep. "Do\r\nyou know him? Looks as if he\'d seen a ghost, doesn\'t he?"\r\n\r\nRachel\'s interest, never a heavy sleeper, was instantly awakened as she\r\nsaw Sybell piloting Hugh towards her. She recognized him--the man she\r\nhad seen last night in the hansom and afterwards at the Newhavens. A\r\nglance showed her that his trouble, whatever it might be, had pierced\r\nbeyond the surface feelings of anger and impatience and had reached the\r\nquick of his heart. The young man, pallid and heavy-eyed, bore himself\r\nwell, and Rachel respected him for his quiet demeanor and a certain\r\ndignity, which, for the moment, obliterated the slight indecision of his\r\nface, and gave his mouth the firmness which it lacked. It seemed to\r\nRachel as if he had but now stood by a death-bed, and had brought with\r\nhim into the crowded room the shadow of an inexorable fate.\r\n\r\nThe others only perceived that he had a headache. Hugh did not deny it.\r\nHe complained of the great heat to Sybell, but not to Rachel. Something\r\nin her clear eyes told him, as they told many others, that small lies\r\nand petty deceits might be laid aside with impunity in dealing with her.\r\nHe felt no surprise at seeing her, no return of the sudden violent\r\nemotion of the night before. He had never spoken to her till this\r\nmoment, but yet he felt that her eyes were old friends, tried to the\r\nuttermost and found faithful in some forgotten past. Rachel\'s eyes had a\r\ncertain calm fixity in them that comes not of natural temperament, but\r\nof past conflict, long waged, and barely but irrevocably won. A faint\r\nray of comfort stole across the desolation of his mind as he looked at\r\nher. He did not notice whether she was handsome or ugly, any more than\r\nwe do when we look at the dear familiar faces which were with us in\r\ntheir childhood and ours, which have grown up beside us under the same\r\nroof, which have rejoiced with us and wept with us, and without which\r\nheaven itself could never be a home.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he was taking her in to dinner. He had imagined that\r\nshe was a woman of few words, but after a faint attempt at conversation\r\nhe found that he had relapsed into silence, and that it was she who was\r\ntalking. Presently the heavy cloud upon his brain lifted. His strained\r\nface relaxed. She glanced at him, and continued her little monologue.\r\nHer face had brightened.\r\n\r\nHe had dreaded this dinner-party, this first essay to preserve his\r\nbalance in public with his frightful invisible burden; but he was\r\ngetting through it better than he had expected.\r\n\r\n"I have come back to what is called society," Rachel was saying, "after\r\nnearly seven years of an exile something like Nebuchadnezzar\'s, and\r\nthere are two things which I find as difficult as Kipling\'s \'silly\r\nsailors\' found their harps \'which they twanged unhandily.\'"\r\n\r\n"Is small talk one of them?" asked Hugh. "It has always been a\r\ndifficulty to me."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," said Rachel. "I plume myself on that. Surely my\r\npresent sample is not so much below the average that you need ask me\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I did not recognize that it _was_ small talk," said Hugh, with a faint\r\nsmile. "If it really is, I can only say I shall have brain fever if you\r\npass on to what _you_ might call conversation."\r\n\r\nIt was to him as if a miniature wavelet of a great ocean somewhere in\r\nthe distance had crept up to laugh and break at his feet. He did not\r\nrecognize that this tiniest runlet which fell back at once was of the\r\nsame element as the tidal wave which had swept over him yesternight.\r\n\r\n"But are you aware," said Rachel, dropping her voice a little, "it is\r\nbeginning to dawn upon me that this evening\'s gathering is met together\r\nfor exalted conversation, and perhaps we ought to be practising a\r\nlittle. I feel certain that after dinner you will be \'drawn through the\r\nclefts of confession\' by Miss Barker, the woman in the high dinner gown\r\nwith orange velvet sleeves. Mrs. Loftus introduced her to me when I\r\narrived as the \'apostle of humanity.\'"\r\n\r\n"Why should you fix on that particular apostle for me?" said Hugh,\r\nlooking resentfully at a large-faced woman who was talking in an\r\n"intense" manner to a slightly bewildered Bishop.\r\n\r\n"It is a prophetic instinct, nothing more."\r\n\r\n"I will have a prophetic instinct, too, then," said Hugh, helping\r\nhimself at last to the dish which was presented to him, to Rachel\'s\r\nrelief. "I shall give you the--" looking slowly down the table.\r\n\r\n"The Bishop?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, after your disposal of me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, the poet? I am sure he is a poet because his tie is uneven\r\nand his hair is so long. Why do literary men wear their hair long, and\r\nliterary women wear it short. I should _like_ the poet."\r\n\r\n"You shall not have him," said Hugh, with decision. "I am hesitating\r\nbetween the bald young man with the fat hand and the immense ring and\r\nthe old professor who is drawing plans on the table-cloth."\r\n\r\n"The apostle told me with bated breath that the young man with the ring\r\nis Mr. Harvey, the author of _Unashamed_."\r\n\r\nHugh looked at his plate to conceal his disgust.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in the buzz of conversation, and into it fell\r\nstraightway the voice of the apostle like a brick through a skylight.\r\n\r\n"The need of the present age is the realization of our brotherhood with\r\nsin and suffering and poverty. West London in satin and diamonds does\r\nnot hear her sister East London in rags calling to her to deliver her.\r\nThe voice of East London has been drowned in the dance-music of the West\r\nEnd."\r\n\r\nSybell gazed with awed admiration at the apostle.\r\n\r\n"What a beautiful thought," she said.\r\n\r\n"Miss Gresley\'s _Idyll of East London_," said Hugh, "is a voice which,\r\nat any rate, has been fully heard."\r\n\r\nThe apostle put up a _pince-nez_ on a bone leg and looked at Hugh.\r\n\r\n"I entirely disapprove of that little book," she said. "It is misleading\r\nand wilfully one-sided."\r\n\r\n"Hester Gresley is a dear friend of mine," said Sybell, "and I must\r\nstand up for her. She is the sister of our clergyman, who is a very\r\nclever man. In fact, I am not sure he isn\'t the cleverest of the two.\r\nShe and I have great talks. We have so much in common. How strange it\r\nseems that she who lives in the depths of the country should have\r\nwritten a story of the East End!"\r\n\r\n"That is always so," said the author of _Unashamed_, in a sonorous\r\nvoice. "The novel has of late been dwarfed to the scope of the young\r\nEnglish girl"--he pronounced it gurl--"who writes from her imagination\r\nand not from her experience. What true art requires of us is a faithful\r\nrendering of a great experience."\r\n\r\nHe looked round, as if challenging the world to say that _Unashamed_ was\r\nnot a lurid personal reminiscence.\r\n\r\nSybell was charmed. She felt that none of her previous dinner-parties\r\nhad reached such a high level as this one.\r\n\r\n"A faithful rendering of a great experience," she repeated. "How I wish\r\nHester were here to hear that. I often tell her she ought to see life,\r\nand cultivated society would do so much for her. I found her out a year\r\nago, and I\'m always begging people to read her book, and I simply long\r\nto introduce her to clever people and oblige the world to recognize her\r\ntalent."\r\n\r\n"I agree with you, it is not yet fully recognized," said Hugh, in a\r\nlevel voice; "but if _The Idyll_ received only partial recognition, it\r\nwas, at any rate, enthusiastic. And it is not forgotten."\r\n\r\nSybell felt vaguely uncomfortable, and conceived a faint dislike of Hugh\r\nas an uncongenial person.\r\n\r\nThe apostle and the poet began to speak simultaneously, but the female\r\nkey was the highest, and prevailed.\r\n\r\n"We all agree in admiring Miss Gresley\'s delicate piece of workmanship,"\r\nsaid the apostle, both elbows on the table after the manner of her kind,\r\n"but it is a misfortune to the cause of suffering humanity--to _our_\r\ncause--when the books which pretend to set forth certain phases of its\r\nexistence are written by persons entirely ignorant of the life they\r\ndescribe."\r\n\r\n"How true!" said Sybell. "I have often thought it, but I never could put\r\nit into words as you do. Oh! how I agree with you and Mr. Harvey! As I\r\noften say to Hester, \'How can you describe anything if you don\'t go\r\nanywhere or see anything? I can\'t give you my experience. No one can.\' I\r\nsaid that to her only a month ago, when she refused to come up to London\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nRachel\'s white face and neck had taken on them the pink transparent\r\ncolor that generally dwelt only in the curves of her small ears.\r\n\r\n"Why do you think Miss Gresley is ignorant of the life she describes?"\r\nshe said, addressing the apostle.\r\n\r\nThe author and the apostle both opened their mouths at the same moment,\r\nonly to register a second triumph of the female tongue.\r\n\r\nMiss Barker was in her element. The whole table was listening. She\r\nshrugged her orange-velvet shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Those who have cast in their lot with the poor," she said,\r\nsententiously, "would recognize at once the impossibility of Miss\r\nGresley\'s characters and situations."\r\n\r\n"To me they seem real," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear Miss West, you will excuse me, but a young lady like\r\nyourself, nursed in the lap of luxury, can hardly be expected to look at\r\nlife with the same eyes as a poor waif like myself, who has penetrated\r\nto the very core of the city, and who has heard the stifled sigh of a\r\nvast perishing humanity."\r\n\r\n"I lived in the midst of it for six years," said Rachel. "I did not cast\r\nin my lot with the poor, for I was one of them, and earned my bread\r\namong them. Miss Gresley\'s book may not be palatable in some respects,\r\nthe district visitor and the woman missionary are certainly treated with\r\nharshness, but, as far as my experience goes, _The Idyll_ is a true word\r\nfrom first to last."\r\n\r\nThere was in Rachel\'s voice a restrained force that vaguely stirred all\r\nthe occupants of the room. Every one looked at her, and for a moment no\r\none spoke. She became quite colorless.\r\n\r\n"Very striking. Just what I should have said in her place," said Sybell\r\nto herself. "I will ask her again."\r\n\r\n"I can hear it raining," said Doll\'s voice from the head of the table to\r\nthe company in general. "If it will only go on for a week without\r\nstopping there may be some hope for the crops yet."\r\n\r\nThe conversation buzzed up again, and Rachel turned instantly to Hugh,\r\nbefore Mr. Harvey, leaning forward with his ring, had time to address\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHugh alone saw what a superhuman effort it had been to her to overcome\r\nher shrinking from mentioning, not her previous poverty, but her\r\npersonal experience. She had sacrificed her natural reserve, which he\r\ncould see was great; she had even set good taste at defiance to defend\r\nHester Gresley\'s book. Hugh had shuddered as he heard her speak. He felt\r\nthat he could not have obtruded himself on so mixed an assembly. Yet he\r\nsaw that it had cost her more to do so than it would have cost him.\r\n\r\nHe began to remember having heard people speak of an iron-master\'s\r\ndaughter, whose father had failed and died, and who, after several years\r\nof dire poverty, had lately inherited a vast fortune from her father\'s\r\npartner. It had been talked about at the time, a few months ago. This\r\nmust be she.\r\n\r\n"You have a great affection for Miss Gresley," he said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"I have," said Rachel, her lip still quivering. "But if I disliked her I\r\nhope I should have said the same. Surely it is not necessary to love\r\nthe writer in order to defend the book."\r\n\r\nHugh was silent. He looked at her, and wished that she might always be\r\non his side.\r\n\r\n"About two courses ago I was going to tell you," said Rachel, smiling,\r\n"of one of my chief difficulties on my return to the civilized world and\r\n\'Society.\' But now you have had an example of it. I am trying to cure\r\nmyself of the trick of becoming interested in conversation. I must learn\r\nto use words as counters, not as coins. I need not disbelieve what I\r\nsay, but I must not speak of anything to which I attach value. I\r\nperceive that to do this is an art and a means of defence from invasion.\r\nBut I, on the contrary, become interested, as you have just seen. I\r\nforget that I am only playing a game, and I rush into a subject like a\r\nbull into a china-shop, and knock about all the crockery until--as I am\r\nnot opposed by my native pitchfork--I suddenly return to my senses, and\r\ndiscover that I have mistaken a game for real earnest."\r\n\r\n"We were all in earnest five minutes ago," said Hugh; "at least, I was.\r\nI could not bear to hear Miss Gresley patronized by all these failures\r\nand amateurs. But, unless I am very much mistaken, you will find several\r\npitchforks laid up for you in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to smash any more china," said Rachel.\r\n\r\nAnother wavelet skimmed in and broke a little further up the sand. A\r\nsense of freshness, of expectation was in the air. The great gathered\r\nocean was stirring itself in the distance. Hugh had forgotten his\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nHe turned the conversation back to Hester Gresley and her writing. He\r\nspoke of her with sympathy and appreciation, and presently detected a\r\nsoftness in Rachel\'s eyes which made him jealous of Hester.\r\n\r\nBy the time the evening was over the imperceptible travelling of the\r\nsummer sea had reached as far as the tidal wave.\r\n\r\nHugh left when Rachel did, accompanying her to her carriage. At the\r\ndoor were the darkness and the rain. At the door with them the horror\r\nand despair of the morning were in wait for him, and laid hold upon him.\r\nHugh shuddered, and turned instinctively to Rachel.\r\n\r\nShe was holding out her hand to him. He took it and held it tightly in\r\nhis sudden fear and desolation.\r\n\r\n"When shall I meet you again?" he said, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nA long look passed between them. Hugh\'s tortured soul, full of\r\npassionate entreaty, leaped to his eyes. Hers, sad and steadfast, met\r\nthe appeal in his, and recognized it as a claim. There was no surprise\r\nin her quiet face.\r\n\r\n"I ride early in the Row," she said. "You can join me there if you wish.\r\nGood-night."\r\n\r\nShe took her hand with great gentleness out of his and drove away.\r\n\r\nAnd the darkness shut down again on Hugh\'s heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n     Ici bas tous les hommes pleurent\r\n     Leurs amiti\xe9s et leurs amours.\r\n                              --BOURGET.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany sarcastic but true words have been said by man, and in no jealous\r\nspirit, concerning woman\'s friendship for woman. The passing judgment of\r\nthe majority of men on such devotion might be summed up in the words,\r\n"Occupy till I come." It does occupy till they do come. And if they\r\ndon\'t come the hastily improvised friendship may hold together for\r\nyears, like an unseaworthy boat in a harbor, which looks like a boat but\r\nnever goes out to sea.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, here and there among its numberless counterfeits a\r\nfriendship rises up between two women which sustains the life of both,\r\nwhich is still young when life is waning, which man\'s love and\r\nmotherhood cannot displace nor death annihilate; a friendship which is\r\nnot the solitary affection of an empty heart, nor the deepest affection\r\nof a full one, but which nevertheless lightens the burdens of this world\r\nand lays its pure hand upon the next.\r\n\r\nSuch a friendship, very deep, very tender, existed between Rachel West\r\nand Hester Gresley. It dated back from the nursery days, when Hester and\r\nRachel solemnly eyed each other, and then made acquaintance in the dark\r\ngardens of Portman Square, into which Hester introduced a fortified\r\ncastle with a captive princess in it, and a rescuing prince and a\r\ndragon, and several other ingredients of romance to the awed amazement\r\nof Rachel--stolid, solid, silent Rachel--who loved all two and four\r\nlegged creatures, but who never made them talk to each other as Hester\r\ndid. And Hester, in blue serge, told Rachel, in crimson velvet, as they\r\nwalked hand in hand in front of their nursery-maids, what the London\r\nsparrows said to each other in the gutters, and how they considered the\r\ngravel path in the square was a deep river suitable to bathe in. And\r\nwhen the spring was coming, and the prince had rescued the princess so\r\noften from the dungeon in the laurel-bushes that Hester was tired of it,\r\nshe told Rachel how the elms were always sighing because they were shut\r\nup in town, and how they went out every night with their roots into the\r\ngreen country to see their friends, and came back, oh! so early in the\r\nmorning, before any one was awake to miss them. And Rachel\'s heart\r\nyearned after Hester, and she gave her her red horse and the tin duck\r\nand magnet, and Hester made stories about them all.\r\n\r\nAt last the day came when Rachel\'s mother, who had long viewed the\r\nintimacy with complacency, presented her compliments, in a note-sheet\r\nwith two immense gilt crests on it, to Hester\'s aunt, and requested that\r\nher little niece might be allowed to come to tea with her little\r\ndaughter. And Lady Susan Gresley, who had never met the rich\r\niron-master\'s wife in this world, and would probably be equally\r\nexclusive in the next, was about to refuse, when Hester, who up to that\r\nmoment had apparently taken no interest in the matter, suddenly cast\r\nherself on the floor in a paroxysm of despair and beat her head against\r\nthe carpet. The tearful entreaties of her aunt gradually elicited the\r\nexplanation, riddled by sobs, that Hester could never take an interest\r\nin life again, could never raise herself even to a sitting position, nor\r\ndry her eyes on her aunt\'s handkerchief, unless she were allowed to go\r\nto tea with Rachel and see her dormouse.\r\n\r\nLady Susan, much upset herself, and convinced that these outbursts were\r\nprejudicial to Hester\'s health, gave way at once, and a few days later\r\nHester, pale, shy, in a white muffler, escorted by mademoiselle, went to\r\ntea in the magnificent house on the other side of the square, and saw\r\nRachel\'s round head without a feathered hat on it, and both children\r\nwere consumed by shyness until the two mademoiselles withdrew into\r\nanother room, and Rachel showed Hester the dormouse which she had found\r\nin the woods in the country, and which ate out of her hand. And Hester\r\nmade a little poem on it, beginning,\r\n\r\n     "There was a mouse in Portman Square";\r\n\r\nand so, with many breaks, the friendship attained a surer footing, and\r\nthe intimacy grew with their growth, in spite of the fact that Lady\r\nSusan had felt unable (notwithstanding the marked advances of Mrs. West,\r\npossibly because of them) to enlarge her visiting-list, in spite of many\r\nother difficulties which were only in the end surmounted by the\r\nsimplicity of character which Rachel had not inherited from her parents.\r\n\r\nAnd then, after both girls had danced through one London season in\r\ndifferent ball-rooms, Rachel\'s parents died, her mother first, and\r\nthen--by accident--her father, leaving behind him an avalanche of\r\nunsuspected money difficulties, in which even his vast fortune was\r\nengulfed.\r\n\r\nHard years followed for Rachel. She ate the bread of carefulness in the\r\nhouses of poor relations not of high degree, with whom her parents had\r\nquarrelled when they had made their money and began to entertain social\r\nambitions. She learned what it was to be the person of least importance\r\nin families of no importance. She essayed to teach, and failed. She had\r\nno real education. She made desperate struggles for independence, and\r\nlearned how others failed besides herself. She left her relations and\r\ntheir bitter bread and came to London, and struggled with those who\r\nstruggled, and saw how Temptation spreads her net for bleeding feet.\r\nBecause she loved Hester she accepted from her half her slender\r\npin-money. Hester had said, "If I were poor, Rachel, how would you bear\r\nit if I would not let you help me?" And Rachel had wept slow, difficult\r\ntears, and had given Hester the comfort of helping her. The greater\r\ngenerosity was with Rachel, and Hester knew it.\r\n\r\nAnd as Rachel\'s fortunes sank, Hester\'s rose. Lady Susan Gresley had one\r\ntalent, and she did not lay it up in a napkin. She had the art of\r\nattracting people to her house, that house to which Mrs. West had never\r\nforced an entrance. Hester was thrown from the first into a society\r\nwhich her clergyman brother, who had never seen it, pronounced to be\r\nfrivolous, worldly, profane, but which no one has called dull. There\r\nwere many facets in Hester\'s character, and Lady Susan had managed to\r\nplace her where they caught the light. Was she witty? Was she\r\nattractive? Who shall say? Man is wisely averse to "cleverness" in a\r\nwoman, but if he possesses any armor wherewith to steel himself against\r\nwit it is certain that he seldom puts it on. She refused several offers,\r\none so brilliant that no woman ever believed that it was really made.\r\n\r\nLady Susan saw that her niece, without a fortune, with little beauty\r\nsave that of high breeding, with weak health, was becoming a personage.\r\n"What will she become?" people said. And in the meanwhile Hester did\r\nnothing beyond dressing extremely well. And everything she saw and every\r\nperson she met added fuel to an unlit fire in her soul.\r\n\r\nAt last Rachel was able to earn a meagre living by type-writing, and for\r\nfour years, happy by contrast with those when despair and failure had\r\nconfronted her, she lived by the work of her hands among those poor as\r\nherself. Gradually she had lost sight of all her acquaintances. She had\r\nbeen out of the school-room for too short a time to make friends. And,\r\nalas! in the set in which she had been launched poverty was a crime; no,\r\nperhaps not quite that, but as much a bar to intercourse as in another\r\nclass a want of the letter _h_ is found to be.\r\n\r\nIt was while Rachel was still struggling for a livelihood that the event\r\nhappened which changed the bias of her character, as a geranium\r\ntransplanted from the garden changes its attitude in a cottage window.\r\n\r\nOn one of the early days of her despair she met on the dreary stairs of\r\nthe great rabbit-warren in which she had a room, a man with whom she\r\nhad been acquainted in the short year of her social life before the\r\ncollapse of her fortunes. He had paid her considerable attention, and\r\nshe had thought once or twice, with momentary bitterness, that, like the\r\nrest, he had not cared to find out what had become of her. She greeted\r\nhim with shy but evident pleasure. She took for granted he had come to\r\nsee her, and he allowed her to remain under that delusion. In reality he\r\nhad been hunting up an old model whom he wanted for his next picture,\r\nand who had silently left Museum Buildings some months before without\r\nleaving his address. He had genuinely admired her, though he had\r\nforgotten her, and he was unaffectedly delighted to see her again.\r\n\r\nThat one chance meeting was the first of many. Flowers came to Rachel\'s\r\nlittle room, and romance came with them. Rachel\'s proud, tender heart\r\nstruggled, and then gave way before this radiant first love blossoming\r\nin the midst of her loneliness. At last, on a March afternoon, when the\r\nlow sun caught the daffodils he had brought her, he told her he loved\r\nher.\r\n\r\nDays followed, exquisite days, which have none like them in later life\r\nwhatever later life may bring. That year the spring came early, and they\r\nwent often together into the country. And that year when all the world\r\nwas white with blossom the snow came and laid upon earth\'s bridal veil a\r\nwhite shroud. Every cup of May blossom, every petal of hawthorn, bent\r\nbeneath its burden of snow. And so it was in the full spring-tide of\r\nRachel\'s heart. The snow came down upon it. She discovered at last that\r\nthough he loved her he did not wish to marry her; that even from the\r\ntime of that first meeting he had never intended to marry her. That\r\ndiscovery was a shroud. She wrapped her dead love in it, and would fain\r\nhave buried it out of her sight.\r\n\r\nBut only after a year of conflict was she suffered to bury it--after a\r\nyear during which the ghost of her dead ever came back, and came back to\r\nimportune her vainly with its love. Rachel\'s poor neighbors grew\r\naccustomed to see the tall, handsome, waiting figure which always\r\nreturned and returned, but which at last, after one dreadful day, was\r\nseen no more in Museum Buildings. Rachel had laid the ghost at last. But\r\nthe conflict remained graven in her face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a certain cold winter morning Hester darted across the wet pavement\r\nfrom the brougham to the untidy entrance of Museum Buildings where\r\nRachel still lived. It was a miserable day. The streets and bare trees\r\nlooked as if they had been drawn in in ink, and the whole carelessly\r\nblotted before it was dry. All the outlines were confused, blurred. The\r\ncold penetrated to the very bones of the shivering city.\r\n\r\nRachel had just come in, wet and tired, bringing with her a roll of\r\nmanuscript to be transcribed. A woman waiting for her on the endless\r\nstone stairs had cursed her for taking the bread out of her mouth.\r\n\r\n"He always employed me till you came," she shrieked, shaking her fist at\r\nher, "and now he gives it all to you because you\'re younger and\r\nbetter-looking."\r\n\r\nShe gave the woman as much as she dared spare, the calculation did not\r\ntake long, and went on climbing the stairs.\r\n\r\nSomething in the poor creature\'s words, something vague but repulsive in\r\nher remembrance of the man who paid her for the work by which she could\r\nbarely live, fell like lead into Rachel\'s heart. She looked out dumbly\r\nover the wilderness of roofs. The suffering of the world was eating into\r\nher soul; the suffering of this vast travailing East London, where\r\npeople trod each other down to live.\r\n\r\n"If any one had told me," she said to herself, "when I was rich, that I\r\nlived on the flesh and blood of my fellow-creatures, that my virtue and\r\nease and pleasure were bought by their degradation and toil and pain, I\r\nshould not have believed it, and I should have been angry. If I had\r\nbeen told that the clothes I wore, the food I ate, the pen I wrote with,\r\nthe ink I used, the paper I wrote on--all these, and everything I\r\ntouched, from my soap to my match-box, especially my match-box, was the\r\nresult of sweated labor, I should not have believed it, I should have\r\nlaughed. But yet it is so. If I had not been rich once myself I should\r\nthink as all these people do, that the rich are devils incarnate to let\r\nsuch things go on. They have the power to help us. We have none to help\r\nourselves. But they never use it. The rich grind the poor for their\r\nluxuries with their eyes shut, and we grind each other for our daily\r\nbread with our eyes open. I have got that woman\'s work. I have struggled\r\nhard enough to get it, but, though I did not realize it, I might have\r\nknown that I had only got on to the raft by pushing some one else off\r\nit."\r\n\r\nRachel looked out across the miles of roofs which lay below her garret\r\nwindow. The sound was in her ears of that great whirlpool wherein youth\r\nand beauty and innocence go down quick day by day. The wilderness of\r\nleaden roofs turned suddenly before her eyes into a sullen furrowed sea\r\nof shame and crime which, awaiting no future day of judgment, daily gave\r\nup its awful dead.\r\n\r\nPresently Hester came in, panting a little after the long ascent of worn\r\nstairs, and dragging with her a large parcel. It was a fur-lined cloak.\r\nHester spread it mutely before her friend, and looked beseechingly at\r\nher. Then she kissed her, and the two girls clung together for a moment\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n"Dearest," said Rachel, "don\'t give me new things. It isn\'t that--you\r\nknow I did take it when I was in need. But, oh, Hester, I know you can\'t\r\nafford it. I should not mind if you were rich, at least, I would try\r\nnot, but--if you would only give me some of your old clothes instead. I\r\nshould like them all the better because you had worn them." And Rachel\r\nkissed the lapel of Hester\'s coat.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," whispered Hester into Rachel\'s hair. "The best is only just\r\ngood enough."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be kinder to me?"\r\n\r\nHester trembled, and then burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"I will wear it, I will wear it," said Rachel, hurriedly. "Look, Hester!\r\nI have got it on. How deliciously warm! and--do look!--it has two little\r\npockets in the fur lining."\r\n\r\nBut Hester wept passionately, and Rachel sat down by her on the floor in\r\nthe new cloak till the paroxysm was over.\r\n\r\nHow does a subtle affinity find a foothold between natures which present\r\nan obvious, a violent contrast to each other? Why do the obvious and the\r\nsubtle forget their life-long feud at intervals and suddenly appear for\r\na moment in each other\'s society?\r\n\r\nRachel was physically strong. Hester was weak. The one was calm,\r\npatient, practical, equable, the other imaginative, unbalanced,\r\nexcitable.\r\n\r\nLife had not spoiled Rachel. Lady Susan Gresley had done her best to\r\nspoil Hester. The one had lived the unprotected life, and showed it in\r\nher bearing. The other had lived the sheltered life, and bore its mark\r\nupon her pure forehead and youthful face.\r\n\r\n"I cannot bear it," said Hester at last. "I think and think, and I can\'t\r\nthink of anything. I would give my life for you, and you will hardly let\r\nme give you \xa33 10_s._ 6_d._ That is all it cost. It is only frieze, that\r\ncommon red frieze, and the lining is only rabbit." A last tear fell at\r\nthe word rabbit. "I wanted to get you a velvet one, just the same as my\r\nnew one, lined with chinchilla, but I knew it would only make you\r\nmiserable. I wish," looking vindictively at the cloak--"I wish rabbits\r\nhad never been born."\r\n\r\nRachel laughed. Hester was evidently recovering.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Scarlett was saying last night that no one can help any one,"\r\ncontinued Hester, turning her white, exhausted face to her friend. "He\r\nsaid that we are always so placed that we can only look on. And I told\r\nhim that could not be true, but, oh, in my heart, Rachel, I have felt it\r\nwas true all these long, long five years since you have lived here."\r\n\r\nRachel came and stood beside her at the little window. There was just\r\nroom for them between the type-writer and the bed.\r\n\r\nFar below, Hester\'s brougham was pacing up and down.\r\n\r\n"Then are love and sympathy nothing?" she said. "Those are the real\r\ngifts. If I were rich to-morrow I should look to you just as I do now\r\nfor the things which money can\'t buy. And those are the\r\nthings"--Rachel\'s voice shook--"which you have always given me, and\r\nwhich I can\'t do without. You feel my poverty more than I do myself. It\r\ncrushed me at first when I could not support myself. Now that I can--and\r\nin everything except money I am very rich--I am comparatively happy."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Rachel at last, with difficulty, "if I had remained an\r\nheiress Mr. Tristram might have married me. I feel nearly sure he would\r\nhave married me. In that case I lost my money only just in time to\r\nprevent a much greater misfortune, and I am glad I am as I am."\r\n\r\nRachel remembered that conversation often in after-years with a sense of\r\nthankfulness that for once she, who was so reticent, had let Hester see\r\nhow dear she was to her.\r\n\r\nThe two girls stood long together cheek against cheek.\r\n\r\nAnd as Hester leaned against Rachel the yearning of her soul towards her\r\nsuddenly lit up something which had long lain colossal, but\r\ninapprehended, in the depths of her mind. Her paroxysm of despair at her\r\nown powerlessness was followed by a lightning flash of self-revelation.\r\nShe saw, as in a dream, terrible, beautiful, inaccessible, but distinct,\r\nwhere her power lay, of which restless bewildering hints had so often\r\nmocked her. She had but to touch the houses and they would fall down.\r\nShe held her hands tightly together lest she should do it. The strength\r\nas of an infinite ocean swept in beneath her weakness, and bore it upon\r\nits surface like a leaf.\r\n\r\n"You must go home," said Rachel gently, remembering Lady Susan\'s\r\npunctual habits.\r\n\r\nHester kissed her absently and went out into the new world which had\r\nbeen pressing upon her all her life, the gate of which Love had opened\r\nfor her. For Love has many keys besides that of her own dwelling. Some\r\nwho know her slightly affirm that she can only open her own cheap patent\r\npadlock with a secret word on it that everybody knows. But some who know\r\nher better hold that hers is the master-key which will one day turn all\r\nthe locks in all the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later Hester\'s first book, _An Idyll of East London_, was reaping\r\nits harvest of astonished indignation and admiration, and her\r\nacquaintances--not her friends--were still wondering how she came to\r\nknow so much of a life of which they decided she could know nothing,\r\nwhen suddenly Lady Susan Gresley died, and Hester went to live in the\r\ncountry with her clergyman brother.\r\n\r\nA few months later still, and on a mild April day, when the poor London\r\ntrees had black buds on them, Rachel brushed and folded away in the\r\nlittle painted chest of drawers her few threadbare clothes, and put the\r\nboots--which the cobbler, whose wife she had nursed, had patched for\r\nher--under the shelf which held her few cups and plates and the faithful\r\ntin kettle, which had always been a cheerful boiler. And she washed her\r\nseven coarse handkerchiefs, and put them in the washhandstand drawer.\r\nAnd then she raked out the fire and cleaned the grate, and set the room\r\nin order. It was quickly done. She took up her hat, which lay beside a\r\nbundle on the bed. Her hands trembled as she put it on. She looked\r\nwistfully round her, and her face worked. The little room which had\r\nlooked so alien when she came to it six years ago had become a home. She\r\nwent to the window and kissed the pane through which she had learned to\r\nsee so much. Then she seized up the bundle and went quickly out, locking\r\nthe door behind her, and taking the key with her.\r\n\r\n"I am going away for a time, but I shall come back," she said to the\r\ncobbler\'s wife on the same landing.\r\n\r\n"No one comes back as once goes," said the woman, without raising her\r\neyes from the cheap blouse which she was finishing, which kept so well\r\nthe grim secret of how it came into being that no one was afraid of\r\nbuying it.\r\n\r\n"I am keeping on the room."\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled incredulously, giving one sharp glance at the bundle.\r\nShe had seen many flittings. She should buy the kettle when Rachel\'s\r\n"sticks" were sold by the landlord in default of the rent.\r\n\r\n"Well, you was a good neighbor," she said. "There\'s a-many as \'ull miss\r\nyou. Good-bye, and good luck to ye. I sha\'n\'t say as you\'ve left."\r\n\r\n"I shall come back," said Rachel, hoarsely, and she slipped down-stairs\r\nlike a thief. She felt like a thief. For she was rich. The man who had\r\nled her father into the speculations which had ruined him had died\r\nchildless, and had bequeathed to her a colossal fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     Cure the drunkard, heal the insane, mollify the homicide, civilize\r\n     the Pawnee, but what lessons can be devised for the debauchee of\r\n     sentiment?--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight had passed since the drawing of lots, and Lady Newhaven\r\nremained in ignorance as to which of the two men had received his\r\ndeath-warrant. Few have found suspense easy to bear; but for the\r\nself-centred an intolerable element is added to it, which unselfish\r\nnatures escape. From her early youth Lady Newhaven had been in the habit\r\nof viewing life in picturesque _tableaux vivants_ of which she\r\ninvariably formed the central figure. At her confirmation the Bishop,\r\nthe white-robed clergy, and the other candidates had served but as a\r\nnebulous background against which her own white-clad, kneeling figure,\r\nbowed in reverent devotion, stood out in high relief.\r\n\r\nWhen she married Lord Newhaven he took so slight a part, though a\r\nnecessary one, in the wedding groups that their completeness had never\r\nbeen marred by misgivings as to his exact position in them. When, six\r\nyears later, after one or two mild flirtations which only served as a\r\nstimulus to her love of dress--when at last she met, as she would have\r\nexpressed it, "the one love of her life," her first fluctuations and\r\nfinal deviation from the path of honor were the result of new\r\narrangements round the same centre.\r\n\r\nThe first groups in which Hugh took part had been prodigies of virtue.\r\nThe young mother with the Madonna face--Lady Newhaven firmly believed\r\nthat her face, with the crimped fringe drawn down to the eyebrows,\r\nresembled that of a Madonna--with her children round her, Lord Newhaven\r\nas usual somewhat out of focus in the background; and Hugh, young,\r\nhandsome, devoted, heartbroken, and ennobled for life by the\r\ncontemplation of such impregnable virtue.\r\n\r\n"You accuse me of coldness," she had imagined herself saying in a later\r\nscene, when the children and the husband would have made too much of a\r\ncrowd, and were consequently omitted. "I wish to Heaven I were as cold\r\nas I appear."\r\n\r\nAnd she had really said it later on. Hugh never did accuse her of\r\ncoldness, but that was a detail. Those words, conned over many times,\r\nhad nevertheless actually proceeded out of her mouth. Few of us have the\r\npower of saying anything we intend to say. But Lady Newhaven had that\r\npower, and enjoyed also in consequence a profound belief in her\r\nprophetic instincts; while others, Hugh not excepted, detected a\r\npremeditated tone in her conversation, and a sense of incongruity\r\nbetween her remarks and the occasion which called them forth.\r\n\r\nFrom an early date in their married life Lord Newhaven had been in the\r\nhabit of discounting these remarks by making them in rapid rotation\r\nhimself before proceeding to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n"Having noticed that a mother--I mean a young mother--is never really\r\nhappy in the absence of her children, and that their affection makes up\r\nfor the carelessness of their father, may I ask, Violet, what day you\r\nwish to return to Westhope?" he said one morning at breakfast.\r\n\r\n"Any day," she replied. "I am as miserable in one place as in another."\r\n\r\n"We will say Friday week, then," returned Lord Newhaven, ignoring, as he\r\ninvariably did, any allusions to their relative position, and because he\r\nignored them she made many. "The country," he added, hurriedly, "will be\r\nvery refreshing after the glare and dust and empty worldly society of\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in anger. She did not understand the reason, but she\r\nhad long vaguely felt that all conversation seemed to dry up in his\r\npresence. He mopped it all into his own sponge, so to speak, and left\r\nevery subject exhausted.\r\n\r\nShe rose in silent dignity, and went to her boudoir and lay down there.\r\nThe heat was very great, and another fire was burning within her,\r\nwithering her round cheek, and making her small, plump hand look shrunk\r\nand thin. A fortnight had passed, and she had not heard from Hugh. She\r\nhad written to him many times, at first only imploring him to meet her,\r\nbut afterwards telling him she knew what had happened, and entreating\r\nhim to put her out of suspense, to send her one line that his life was\r\nnot endangered. She had received no answer to any of her letters. She\r\ncame to the conclusion that they had been intercepted by Lord Newhaven,\r\nand that no doubt the same fate had befallen Hugh\'s letters to herself.\r\nFor some time past, before the drawing of lots, she had noticed that\r\nHugh\'s letters had become less frequent and shorter in length. She\r\nunderstood the reason now. Half of them had been intercepted. How that\r\nfact could account for the shortness of the remainder may not be\r\nimmediately apparent to the prosaic mind, but it was obvious to Lady\r\nNewhaven. That Hugh had begun to weary of her could not force the narrow\r\nentrance to her mind. Such a possibility had never been even considered\r\nin the pictures of the future with which her imagination busied itself.\r\nBut what would the future be? The road along which she was walking\r\nforked before her eyes, and her usual perspicacity was at fault. She\r\nknew not in which of those two diverging paths the future would lie.\r\n\r\nWould she in eighteen months\' time--she should certainly refuse to marry\r\nwithin the year--be standing at the altar in a "confection" of lilac and\r\nwhite with Hugh; or would she be a miserable wife, moving ghostlike\r\nabout her house, in colored raiment, while a distant grave was always\r\nwhite with flowers sent by a nameless friend of the dead? "How some one\r\nmust have loved him!" she imagined Hugh\'s aged mother saying. And once,\r\nas that bereaved mother came in the dusk to weep beside the grave, did\r\nshe not see a shadowy figure start up, black-robed, from the\r\nflower-laden sod, and, hastily drawing a thick veil over a beautiful,\r\ndespairing face, glide away among the trees? At this point Lady Newhaven\r\nalways began to cry. It was too heart-rending. And her mind in violent\r\nrecoil was caught once more, and broken on the same wheel. "Which?\r\n_Which_?"\r\n\r\nA servant entered.\r\n\r\n"Would her ladyship see Miss West for a few minutes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Newhaven, glad to be delivered from herself, if only by\r\nthe presence of an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"It is very charitable of you to see me," said Rachel. "Personally, I\r\nthink morning calls ought to be a penal offence. But I came at the\r\nentreaty of a former servant of yours. I feel sure you will let me carry\r\nsome message of forgiveness to her, as she is dying. Her name is Morgan.\r\nDo you remember her?"\r\n\r\n"I once had a maid called Morgan," said Lady Newhaven. "She was drunken,\r\nand I had to part with her in the end; but I kept her as long as I could\r\nin spite of it. She had a genius for hair-dressing."\r\n\r\n"She took your diamond heart pendant," continued Rachel. "She was never\r\nfound out. She can\'t return it, for, of course, she sold it and spent\r\nthe money. But now at last she feels she did wrong, and she says she\r\nwill die easier for your forgiveness."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I forgive her," said Lady Newhaven, indifferently. "I often\r\nwondered how I lost it. I never cared about it." She glanced at Rachel,\r\nand added tremulously, "My husband gave it me."\r\n\r\nA sudden impulse was urging her to confide in this grave, gentle-eyed\r\nwoman. The temptation was all the stronger because Rachel, who had only\r\nlately appeared in society, was not connected with any portion of her\r\nprevious life. She was as much a chance acquaintance as a\r\nfellow-passenger in a railway carriage.\r\n\r\nRachel rose and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go," whispered Lady Newhaven, taking her outstretched hand and\r\nholding it.\r\n\r\n"I think if I stay," said Rachel, "that you may say things you will\r\nregret later on when you are feeling stronger. You are evidently tired\r\nout now. Everything looks exaggerated when we are exhausted, as I see\r\nyou are."\r\n\r\n"I am worn out with misery," said Lady Newhaven. "I have not slept for a\r\nfortnight. I feel I must tell some one." And she burst into violent\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nRachel sat down again, and waited patiently for the hysterical weeping\r\nto cease. Those in whom others confide early learn that their own\r\nengagements, their own pleasures and troubles, are liable to be set\r\naside at any moment. Rachel was a punctual, exact person, but she missed\r\nmany trains. Those who sought her seldom realized that her day was as\r\nfull as, possibly fuller, than their own. Perhaps it was only a very\r\nsmall pleasure to which she had been on her way on this particular\r\nmorning, and for which she had put on that ethereal gray gown for the\r\nfirst time. At any rate, she relinquished it without a second thought.\r\n\r\nPresently Lady Newhaven dried her eyes and turned impulsively towards\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe strata of impulsiveness and conventional feeling were always so\r\nmixed up after one of these emotional upheavals that it was difficult to\r\nguess which would come uppermost. Sometimes fragments of both appeared\r\non the surface together.\r\n\r\n"I loved you from the first moment I saw you," she said. "I don\'t take\r\nfancies to people, you know. I am not that kind of person. I am very\r\ndifficult to please, and I never speak of what concerns myself. I am\r\n_most_ reserved. I dare say you have noticed how reserved I am. I live\r\nin my shell. But directly I saw you I felt I could talk to you. I said\r\nto myself, \'I will make a friend of that girl.\' Although I always feel a\r\nmarried woman is so differently placed from a girl. A girl only thinks\r\nof herself. I am not saying this the least unkindly, but, of course, it\r\nis so. Now a married woman has to consider her husband and family in all\r\nshe says and does. How will it affect _them?_ That is what I so often\r\nsay to myself, and then my lips are sealed. But, of course, being\r\nunmarried, you would not understand that feeling."\r\n\r\nRachel did not answer. She was inured to this time-honored\r\nconversational opening.\r\n\r\n"And the temptations of married life," continued Lady Newhaven--"a girl\r\ncannot enter into them."\r\n\r\n"Then do not tell me about them," said Rachel, smiling, wondering if she\r\nmight still escape. But Lady Newhaven had no intention of letting her\r\ngo. She only wished to indicate to her her true position. And gradually,\r\nnot without renewed outbursts of tears, not without traversing many\r\nlayers of prepared conventional feelings, in which a few thin streaks of\r\ngenuine emotion wore embedded, she told her story--the story of a young,\r\nhigh-minded, and neglected wife, and of a husband callous, indifferent,\r\na scorner of religion, unsoftened even by the advent of the\r\nchildren--"such sweet children, such little darlings"--and the gradual\r\nestrangement. Then came the persistent siege to the lonely heart of one\r\nnot pretty, perhaps, but fatally attractive to men; the lonely heart\'s\r\nunparalleled influence for good over the besieger.\r\n\r\n"He would do anything," said Lady Newhaven, looking earnestly at Rachel.\r\n"My influence over him is simply boundless. If I said, as I sometimes\r\ndid at balls, how sorry I was to see some plain girl standing out, he\r\nwould go and dance with her. I have seen him do it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he did it to please you."\r\n\r\n"That was just it, simply to please me."\r\n\r\nRachel was not so astonished as Lady Newhaven expected. She certainly\r\nwas rather wooden, the latter reflected. The story went on. It became\r\ndifficult to tell, and, according to the teller, more and more liable to\r\nmisconstruction. Rachel\'s heart ached as bit by bit the inevitable\r\ndevelopment was finally reached in floods of tears.\r\n\r\n"And you remember that night you were at an evening party here," sobbed\r\nLady Newhaven, casting away all her mental notes and speaking extempore.\r\n"It is just a fortnight ago, and I have not slept since, and _he_ was\r\nhere, looking so miserable"--(Rachel started slightly)--"he sometimes\r\ndid, if he thought I was hard upon him. And afterwards, when every one\r\nhad gone, Edward took him to his study and told him he had found us out,\r\nand they drew lots which should kill himself within five months--and I\r\nlistened at the door."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven\'s voice rose half strangled, hardly human, in a shrill\r\ngrotesque whimper above the sobs which were shaking her. There was no\r\naffectation about her now.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s heart went out to her the moment she was natural. She knelt\r\ndown and put her strong arms round her. The poor thing clung to her,\r\nand, leaning her elaborate head against her, wept tears of real anguish\r\nupon her breast.\r\n\r\n"And which drew the short lighter?" said Rachel at last.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," almost shrieked Lady Newhaven. "It is that which is\r\nkilling me. Sometimes I think it is Edward, and sometimes I think it is\r\nHugh."\r\n\r\nAt the name of Hugh, Rachel winced. Lady Newhaven had mentioned no name\r\nin the earlier stages of her story while she had some vestige of\r\nself-command; but now at last the Christian name slipped out unawares.\r\n\r\nRachel strove to speak calmly. She told herself there were many Hughs in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Hugh Scarlett the man you mean?" she asked. If she had died for\r\nit, she must have asked that question.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\nA shadow fell on Rachel\'s face, as on the face of one who suddenly\r\ndiscovers, not for the first time, an old enemy advancing upon him under\r\nthe flag of a new ally.\r\n\r\n"I shall always love him," gasped Lady Newhaven, recovering herself\r\nsufficiently to recall a phrase which she had made up the night before.\r\n"I look upon it as a spiritual marriage."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     A square-set man and honest.\r\n                         --TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Dick," said Lord Newhaven, laying hold of that gentleman as he was\r\nleaving Tattersall\'s, "what mischief have you been up to for the last\r\nten days?"\r\n\r\n"I lay low till I got my clothes," said Dick, "and then I went to the\r\nDuke of ----. I\'ve just been looking at a hack for him. He says he does\r\nnot want one that takes a lot of sitting on. I met him the first night I\r\nlanded. In fact, I stepped out of the train on to his royal toe\r\ntravelling incog. I was just going to advise him to draw in his feelers\r\na hit and give the Colonies a chance, when he turned round and I saw who\r\nit was. I knew him when I was A.D.C. at Melbourne before I took to the\r\ndrink. He said he thought he\'d know my foot anywhere, and asked me down\r\nfor ---- races."\r\n\r\n"And you enjoyed it?"\r\n\r\n"Rather. I did not know what to call the family at first, so I asked him\r\nif he had any preference and what was the right thing, and he told me\r\nhow I must hop up whenever he came in, and all that sort of child\'s\r\nplay. There was a large party and some uncommonly pretty women. And I\r\nwon a tenner off his Royal Highness, and here I am."\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to do now?"\r\n\r\n"Go down to the city and see what Darneil\'s cellars are like before I\r\nstore my wine in them. It won\'t take long. Er!--I say, Cack--Newhaven?"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Ought I to--how about my calling on Miss--? I never caught her name."\r\n\r\n"Miss West, the heiress?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Little attention on my part."\r\n\r\n"Did she ask you to call?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I think it was an oversight. I expect she would like it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, go and be--snubbed."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want snubbing. A little thing like me wants encouragement."\r\n\r\n"A good many other people are on the lookout for encouragement in that\r\nquarter."\r\n\r\n"That settles it," said Dick; "I\'ll go at once. I\'ve got to call on Lady\r\nSusan Gresley, and I\'ll take Miss--"\r\n\r\n"West. West. West."\r\n\r\n"Miss West on the way."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, Miss West does not live on the way to Woking. Lady\r\nSusan Gresley died six months ago."\r\n\r\n"Great Scot! I never heard of it. And what has become of Hester? She is\r\na kind of cousin of mine."\r\n\r\n"Miss Gresley has gone to live in the country a few miles from us, with\r\nher clergyman brother."\r\n\r\n"James Gresley. I remember him. He\'s a bad egg."\r\n\r\n"Now, Dick, are you in earnest, or are you talking nonsense about Miss\r\nWest?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m in earnest." He looked it.\r\n\r\n"Then, for heaven\'s sake, don\'t put your foot in it by calling. My wife\r\nhas taken a violent fancy to Miss West. I don\'t think it is returned,\r\nbut that is a detail. If you want to give her a chance, leave it to me."\r\n\r\n"I know what that means. You married men are mere sieves. You\'ll run\r\nstraight home with your tongue out and tell Lady Newhaven that I want to\r\nmarry Miss--I can\'t clinch her name--and then she\'ll tell her when they\r\nare combing their back hair. And then if I find, later on, I don\'t like\r\nher and step off the grass, I shall have behaved like a perfect brute,\r\nand all that sort of thing. A man I knew out in Melbourne told me that\r\nby the time he\'d taken a little notice of a likely girl, he\'d gone too\r\nfar to go back, and he had to marry her."\r\n\r\n"You need not be so coy. I don\'t intend to mention the subject to my\r\nwife. Besides, I don\'t suppose Miss West will look at you. You\'re a\r\nwretched match for her. With her money she might marry a brewery or a\r\npeerage."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll put myself in focus anyhow," said Dick. "Hang it all! if you could\r\nget a woman to marry you, there is hope for everybody. I don\'t expect it\r\nwill be as easy as falling off a log. But if she is what I take her to\r\nbe I shall go for all I\'m worth."\r\n\r\nSome one else was going for all he was worth. Lord Newhaven rode early,\r\nand he had frequently seen Rachel and Hugh riding together at foot\'s\r\npace. Possibly his offer to help Dick was partly prompted by an\r\nunconscious desire to put a spoke in Hugh\'s wheel.\r\n\r\nDick, whose worst enemy could not accuse him of diffidence, proved a\r\nsolid spoke but for a few days only. Rachel suddenly broke all her\r\nengagements and left London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     "Pour vivre tranquille il faut vivre loin des gens d\'\xe9glise."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a little stream which flows through Middleshire which seems to\r\nreflect the spirit of that quiet county, so slow is its course, so\r\nnarrow is its width. Even the roads don\'t take the trouble to bridge it.\r\nThey merely hump themselves slightly when they feel it tickling\r\nunderneath them, and go on, vouchsafing no further notice of its\r\nexistence. Yet the Drone is a local celebrity in Middleshire, and, like\r\nmost local celebrities, is unknown elsewhere. The squire\'s sons have\r\nlost immense trout in the Drone as it saunters through their lands, and\r\nmost of them have duly earned thereby the distinction (in Middleshire)\r\nof being the best trout-rod in England. Middleshire bristles with the\r\n"best shots in England" and the "best preachers in England" and the\r\ncleverest men in England. The apathetic mother-country knows, according\r\nto Middleshire, "but little of her greatest men." At present she\r\nassociates her loyal county with a breed of small black pigs.\r\n\r\nThrough this favored locality the Drone winds, and turns and turns\r\nagain, as if loath to leave the rich, low meadow-lands and clustering\r\nvillages upon its way. After skirting the little town of Westhope and\r\nthe gardens of Westhope Abbey, the Drone lays itself out in comfortable\r\ncurves and twists innumerable through the length and breadth of the\r\ngreen country till it reaches Warpington, whose church is so near the\r\nstream that in time of flood the water hitches all kinds of things it\r\nhas no further use for among the grave-stones of the little church-yard.\r\nOn one occasion, after repeated prayers for rain, it even overflowed\r\nthe lower part of the vicar\'s garden, and vindictively carried away his\r\nbee-hives. But that was before he built the little wall at the bottom of\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nSlightly raised above the church, on ground held together by old elms,\r\nthe white vicarage of Warpington stands, blinking ever through its trees\r\nat the church like a fond wife at her husband. Indeed, so like had she\r\nbecome to him that she had even developed a tiny bell-tower near the\r\nkitchen chimney, with a single bell in it, feebly rung by a female\r\nservant on saints\' days and G.F.S. gatherings.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o\'clock on this particular morning in July the Drone could\r\nhear, if it wanted to hear, which apparently no one else did, the high,\r\nunmodulated voice in which Mr. Gresley was reading the morning service\r\nto Mrs. Gresley and to a young thrush, which was hurling its person,\r\nlike an inexperienced bicyclist, now against Lazarus and his\r\ngrave-clothes, now against the legs of John the Baptist, with one foot\r\non a river\'s edge and the other firmly planted in a distant desert, and\r\nagainst all the other Scripture characters in turn which adorned the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe service ended at last, and, after releasing his unwilling\r\ncongregation by catching and carrying it, beak agape, into the open air,\r\nMr. Gresley and his wife walked through the church-yard--with its one\r\nmelancholy Scotch fir, embarrassed by its trouser of ivy--to the little\r\ngate which led into their garden.\r\n\r\nThey were a pleasing couple, seen at a little distance. He, at least,\r\nevidently belonged to a social status rather above that of the average\r\nclergyman, though his wife may not have done so. Mr. Gresley, with his\r\nlong, thin nose and his short upper lip and tall, well-set-up figure,\r\nbore on his whole personality the stamp of that for which it is\r\ndifficult to find the right name, so unmeaning has the right name become\r\nby dint of putting it to low uses--the maltreated, the travestied name\r\nof "gentleman."\r\n\r\nNone of those moral qualities, priggish or otherwise, are assumed for\r\nMr. Gresley which, we are told, distinguish the true, the perfect\r\ngentleman, and some of which, thank Heaven! the "gentleman born"\r\nfrequently lacks. Whether he had them or not was a matter of opinion,\r\nbut he had that which some who have it not strenuously affirm to be of\r\nno value--the right outside.\r\n\r\nTo any one who looked beyond the first impression of good-breeding and a\r\nwell-cut coat, a second closer glance was discouraging. Mr. Gresley\'s\r\nsuspicious eye and thin, compressed lips hinted that both fanatic and\r\nsaint were fighting for predominance in the kingdom of that pinched\r\nbrain, the narrowness of which the sloping forehead betokened with such\r\ncruel plainness. He looked as if he would fling himself as hard against\r\na truth without perceiving it as a hunted hare against a stone-wall. He\r\nwas unmistakably of those who only see side issues.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley took her husband\'s arm as he closed the gate. She was still\r\nyoung and still pretty, in spite of the arduous duties of a clergyman\'s\r\nwife, and the depressing fact that she seemed always wearing out old\r\nfinery. Perhaps her devotion to her husband had served to prolong her\r\nyouth, for as the ivy is to the oak, and as the moon is to the sun, and\r\nas the river is to the sea, so was Mrs. Gresley to Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\nThe fortunate couple were advancing through the garden, looking fondly\r\nat their own vicarage, with their own sponges hanging out of their upper\r\nwindows, and their offspring waving to them from a third, when a small,\r\nslight figure appeared on the terrace.\r\n\r\n"James," said Mrs. Gresley, with decision, "it is your duty to speak to\r\nHester about attending early service. If she can go out in the garden\r\nshe can come to church."\r\n\r\n"I have spoken to her once," said Mr. Gresley, frowning, "and though I\r\nput it before her very plainly she showed great obstinacy. Fond as I am\r\nof Hester, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that she has an arrogant\r\nand callous nature. But we must remember, my love, that Aunt Susan was\r\nmost lax in all her views, and we must make allowance for Hester, who\r\nlived with her till last year. It is only natural that Hester, bred up\r\nfrom childhood in that worldly circle--dinner-parties all through Lent,\r\nand Sunday luncheons--should have fallen through want of solid church\r\nteaching into freethinking and ideas of her own upon religion."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley\'s voice was of that peculiar metallic note which carries\r\nfarther than the owner is aware. It rose, if contradicted, into a sort\r\nof continuous trumpet-blast which drowned all other lesser voices.\r\nHester\'s little garret was two stories above Mr. Gresley\'s study on the\r\nground floor, but, nevertheless, she often heard confused, anxious\r\nparochial buzzings overwhelmed by that sustained high note which knew no\r\ncessation until objection or opposition ceased. As she came towards\r\nthem, she heard with perfect distinctness what he was saying, but it did\r\nnot trouble her. Hester was gifted with imagination, and imagination\r\ndoes not find it difficult to read by the shorthand of the expressions\r\nand habitual opinions and repressions of others what they occasionally\r\nsay at full length, and to which they fondly believe they are giving\r\nutterance for the first time. Mr. Gresley had said all this many times\r\nalready by his manner, and it had by its vain repetitions lost its\r\nnovelty. Mr. Gresley was fortunately not aware of this, for\r\nunimaginative persons believe themselves to be sealed books, as\r\nhermetically sealed as the characters of others are to themselves.\r\n\r\nHester was very like her brother. She had the same nose, slightly too\r\nlong for her small face, the same short upper lip and light hair, only\r\nher brother\'s was straight and hers was crimped, as wet sand is crimped\r\nby a placid outgoing sea. That she had an equally strong will was\r\nobvious. But there the likeness ended. Hester\'s figure was slight, and\r\nshe stooped a little. Hester\'s eyes were very gentle, very appealing\r\nunder their long, curled lashes. They were sad, too, as Mr. Gresley\'s\r\nnever were, gay as his never were. An infinite patience looked out of\r\nthem sometimes, that patience of enthusiasm which will cast away its\r\nvery soul and all its best years for the sake of an ideal. Hester\r\nshowed her age in her eyes. She was seven-and-twenty, and appeared many\r\nyears younger until she looked at you.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley looked with veiled irritation at her sister-in-law in her\r\nclean holland gown, held in at the waist with a broad lilac ribbon,\r\nadroitly drawn in picturesque folds through a little silver buckle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley, who had a waist which the Southminster dress-maker\r\ninformed her had "to be kept down," made a mental note for the hundredth\r\ntime that Hester "laced in."\r\n\r\nHester gave that impression of "finish" and sharpness of edge so rarely\r\nfound among the blurred, vague outlines of English women. There was\r\nnothing vague about her. Lord Newhaven said she had been cut out body\r\nand mind with a sharp pair of scissors. Her irregular profile, her\r\ndelicate, pointed speech and fingers, her manner of picking up her\r\nslender feet as she walked, her quick, alert movements--everything about\r\nher was neat, adjusted, perfect in its way, yet without more apparent\r\neffort than the _succ\xe9s fou_ in black and white of the water wagtail,\r\nwhich she so closely resembled.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," she said, turning back with them to the house. "Abel\r\nsays it is going to be the hottest day we have had yet. And the\r\nletter-bag is so fat that I could hardly refrain from opening it.\r\nReally, James, you ought to hide the key, or I shall succumb to\r\ntemptation."\r\n\r\nOnce in the days of her ignorance, when she first came to live at\r\nWarpington, Hester had actually turned the key in the lock of the sacred\r\nletter-bag when the Gresleys were both late, and had extracted her own\r\nletters. She never did it a second time. On the contrary, she begged\r\npardon in real regret at having given such deep offence to her brother\r\nand his wife, and in astonishment that so simple an action could offend.\r\nShe had made an equally distressing blunder in the early days of her\r\nlife with the Gresleys by taking up the daily paper on its arrival in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\n"My dear Hester," Mrs. Gresley said, really scandalized, "I am sure you\r\nwon\'t mind my saying so, but James has not seen his paper yet."\r\n\r\n"I have noticed he never by any chance looks at it till the evening, and\r\nyou always say you never read it," said Hester, deep in a political\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n"That is his rule, and a very good rule it is; but he naturally likes to\r\nbe the _first_ to look at it," said Mrs. Gresley, with a great exercise\r\nof patience. She had heard Hester was clever, but she found her very\r\nstupid. Everything had to be explained to her.\r\n\r\nHer tone recalled Hester from the Indian tribal rising and the speech of\r\nthe Prime Minister to the realities of life. It was fortunate for her\r\nthat she was quick-witted. These two flagrant blunders were sufficient\r\nfor her. She grasped the principle that those who have a great love of\r\npower and little scope for it must necessarily exercise it in trivial\r\nmatters. She extended the principle of the newspaper and the letter-bag\r\nover her entire intercourse with the Gresleys and never offended in that\r\nmanner again.\r\n\r\nOn this particular morning she waited decorously beside her brother as\r\nhe opened the bag and dealt out the contents into three heaps. Hester\r\npounced on hers and subsided into her chair at the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Mrs. Gresley, looking at Hester\'s pile of letters over\r\nthe top of her share of the morning\'s correspondence--namely, a list of\r\nPryce Jones--"that you care to write so many letters, Hester. I am sure\r\nI never did such a thing when I was a girl. I should have regarded it as\r\na waste of time."\r\n\r\n"Ha!" said Mr. Gresley, in a gratified tone, opening a little roll.\r\n"What have we here? Proofs! My paper upon \'Modern Dissent.\' I told\r\nEdwards I would not allow him to put it in his next number of the\r\n_Southminster Advertiser_ until I had glanced at it in print. I don\'t\r\nknow when I shall find time to correct it. I shall be out all the\r\nafternoon at the chapter meeting."\r\n\r\nHe looked at Hester. She had laid down her letters and was taking a cup\r\nof coffee from Mrs. Gresley. She evidently had not heard her brother\'s\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n"You and I must lay our heads together over this, Hester," he said,\r\nholding up with some pride a long slip of proof. "It will be just in\r\nyour line. You might run it over after breakfast," he continued, in high\r\ngood-humor, "and put in the stops and grammar and spelling--you\'re more\r\nup in that sort of thing than I am--and then we will go through it\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nHester was quite accustomed, when her help was asked as to a\r\ncomposition, to receive as a reason for the request the extremely\r\ngratifying assurance that she was "good" at punctuation and spelling. It\r\ngave the would-be author a comfortable feeling that, after all, he was\r\nonly asking advice on the crudest technical matters on which Hester\'s\r\nsuperiority could be admitted without a loss of masculine self-respect.\r\n\r\n"I would rather not tamper with punctuation and spelling," said Hester,\r\ndryly. "I am so shaky on both myself. You had better ask the\r\nschool-master. He knows all that sort of ABC better than I do."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley frowned, and looked suspiciously at her. He wanted Hester\'s\r\nopinion, of which she was perfectly aware. But she intended that he\r\nshould ask for it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley, behind the coffee-pot, felt that she was overlooked. She\r\nhad helped Mr. Gresley with his numerous literary efforts until Hester\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n"I saw you correcting some one\'s manuscript last week," he said. "You\r\nwere at it all day in the hay-field."\r\n\r\n"That was different. I was asked to criticise the style and\r\ncomposition."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," said Mr. Gresley, "don\'t let us split hairs. I don\'t want an\r\nargument about it. If you\'ll come into my study at ten o\'clock I\'ll get\r\nit off my hands at once."\r\n\r\n"With pleasure," said Hester, looking at him with rueful admiration. She\r\nhad tried a hundred times to get the better of him in conversation, but\r\nshe had not yet succeeded.\r\n\r\n"I have a message for you," continued Mr. Gresley, in restored\r\ngood-humor. "Mrs. Loftus writes that she is returning to Wilderleigh at\r\nthe end of the week, and that the sale of work may take place in the\r\nWilderleigh gardens at the end of August. And--let me see, I will read\r\nwhat she says:\r\n\r\n"\'I am not unmindful of our conversation on the duty of those who go\r\nannually to London to bring a spiritual influence to bear on\r\nsociety\'--("I impressed that upon her before she went up.")--\'We had a\r\nmost interesting dinner-party last week, nearly all celebrated and\r\ngifted persons, and the conversation was really beyond anything I can\r\ndescribe to you. I thought my poor brain would turn. I was quite afraid\r\nto join in. But Mr. Harvey--the great Mr. Harvey--told me afterwards I\r\nwas at my best. One lady, Miss Barker, who has done so much for the East\r\nEnd, is coming down to Wilderleigh shortly for a rest. I am anxious you\r\nshould talk to her. She says she has doubts, and she is tired of the\r\nBible. By the way, please tell Hester, with my love, that she and Mr.\r\nHarvey attacked _The Idyll of East London_, and showed it up entirely,\r\nand poor little me had to stand up for her against them all."\r\n\r\n"She would never do that," said Hester, tranquilly. "She might perhaps\r\nhave said, \'The writer is a friend of mine. I must stand up for her.\'\r\nBut she would never have gone beyond saying it to doing it."\r\n\r\n"Hester," exclaimed Mrs. Gresley, feeling that she might just as well\r\nhave remained a spinster if she was to be thus ignored in her own house,\r\n"I can\'t think how you can allow your jealousy of Sybell Loftus, for I\r\ncan attribute it to nothing else, to carry you so far."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it had better carry me into the garden," said Hester, rising\r\nwith the others. "You must forgive me if I spoke irritably. I have a\r\nracking headache."\r\n\r\n"She looks ill," said her brother, following Hester\'s figure with\r\naffectionate solicitude, as she passed the window a moment later.\r\n\r\n"And yet she does next to nothing," said the hard-worked little wife,\r\nintercepting the glance. "I always thought she wrote her stories in the\r\nmorning. I know she is never about if the Pratt girls call to see her\r\nbefore luncheon. Yet when I ran up to her room yesterday morning to ask\r\nher to take Mary\'s music, as Fr\xe4ulein had the headache"--(Mrs. Gresley\r\nalways spoke of "the headache" and "the toothache")--"she was lying on\r\nher bed doing nothing at all."\r\n\r\n"She is very unaccountable," said Mr. Gresley. "Still, I can make\r\nallowance for the artistic temperament. I share it to a certain degree.\r\nPoor Hester. She is a spoiled child."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, James, she is. And she has an enormous opinion of herself. For\r\nmy part, I think the Bishop is to blame for making so much of her. Have\r\nyou never noticed how different she is when he is here, so gay and\r\ntalkative, and when we are alone she hardly says a word for days\r\ntogether, except to the children?"\r\n\r\n"She talked more when she first came," said Mr. Gresley. "But when she\r\nfound I made it a rule to discourage argument"--(by argument Mr. Gresley\r\nmeant difference of opinion)--"she seemed gradually to lose interest in\r\nconversation. Yet I have heard the Bishop speak of her as a brilliant\r\ntalker. And Lord Newhaven asked me last spring how I liked having a\r\ncelebrity for a sister. A celebrity! Why, half the people in Middleshire\r\ndon\'t even know of Hester\'s existence." And the author of "Modern\r\nDissent" frowned.\r\n\r\n"That was a hit at you, my dear," said Mrs. Gresley. "It was just after\r\nyour pamphlet on \'Schism\' appeared. Lord Newhaven always says something\r\ndisagreeable. Don\'t you remember, when you were thinking of exchanging\r\nWarpington for that Scotch living, he said he knew you would not do it\r\nbecause with your feeling towards Dissent you would never go to a\r\ncountry where you would be a Dissenter yourself?"\r\n\r\n"How about the proofs?" said Hester, through the open window. "I am\r\nready when you are, James."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     Wonderful power to benumb possesses this brother.\r\n                                               --EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Of course, Hester," said Mr. Gresley, leading the way to his study and\r\nspeaking in his lesson-for-the-day voice, "I don\'t pretend to\r\nwrite"--("They always say that," thought Hester)--"I have not sufficient\r\nleisure to devote to the subject to insure becoming a successful author.\r\nAnd even if I had I am afraid I should not be willing to sell my soul to\r\nobtain popularity, for that is what it comes to in these days. The\r\npublic must be pandered to. It must be amused. The public likes smooth\r\nthings, and the great truths--the only things I should care to write\r\nabout--are not smooth, far from it."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"This little paper on \'Dissent,\' which I propose to publish in pamphlet\r\nform after its appearance as a serial--it will run to two numbers in the\r\n_Southminster Advertiser_--was merely thrown off in a few days when I\r\nhad influenza, and could not attend to my usual work."\r\n\r\n"It must be very difficult to work in illness," said Hester, who had\r\nevidently made a vow during her brief sojourn in the garden, and was now\r\nobviously going through that process which the society of some of our\r\nfellow-creatures makes as necessary as it is fatiguing--namely, that of\r\nthinking beforehand what we are going to say.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley liked Hester immensely when she had freshly ironed herself\r\nflat under one of these resolutions. He was wont to say that no one was\r\npleasanter than Hester when she was reasonable, or made more suitable\r\nremarks. He perceived with joy that she was reasonable now, and the\r\nbrother and sister sat down close together at the writing-table with the\r\nprinted sheets between them.\r\n\r\n"I will read aloud," said Mr. Gresley, "and you can follow me, and stop\r\nme if you think--er--the sense is not quite clear."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\nThe two long noses, the larger freckled one surmounted by a _pince-nez_,\r\nthe other slightly pink, as if it had absorbed the tint of the\r\nblotting-paper over which it was so continually poised, both bent over\r\nthe sheets.\r\n\r\nThrough the thin wall which separated the school-room from the study\r\ncame the sound of Mary\'s scales. Mary was by nature a child of wrath, as\r\nfar as music was concerned, and Fr\xe4ulein--anxious, musical Fr\xe4ulein--was\r\nstrenuously endeavoring to impart to her pupil the rudiments of what was\r\nher chief joy in life.\r\n\r\n"\'Modern Dissent,\'" read aloud Mr. Gresley, "by Veritas."\r\n\r\n"_Veritas_!" repeated Hester. Astonishment jerked the word out of her\r\nbefore she was aware. She pulled herself hastily together.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the author, looking at his sister through his glasses,\r\nwhich made the pupils of his eyes look as large as the striped marbles\r\non which Mary and Regie spent their pennies. "Veritas," he continued,\r\n"is a Latin word signifying Truth."\r\n\r\n"So I fancied. But is not _Truth_ rather a large name to adopt as a _nom\r\nde guerre_? Might it not seem rather--er--in a layman it would appear\r\narrogant."\r\n\r\n"I am not a layman, and I do not pretend to write on subjects of which I\r\nam ignorant," said Mr. Gresley, with dignity. "This is not a work of\r\nfiction. I don\'t imagine this, or fancy that, or invent the other. I\r\nmerely place before the public, forcibly, and in a novel manner, a few\r\ngreat truths."\r\n\r\nMary was doing her finger exercises. C, C, C, with the thumb; D, D, D,\r\nwith the first finger, Fr\xe4ulein was repeating. "Won! two! free! Won!\r\ntwo! free!" with a new intonation of cheerful patience at each\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Hester. "A few great truths. Then the name must be \'Veritas.\'\r\nYou would not reconsider it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Mr. Gresley, his eye challenging hers. "It is the\r\nname I am known by as the author of \'Schism.\'"\r\n\r\n"I had momentarily forgotten \'Schism,\'" said Hester, dropping her\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"I went through a good deal of obloquy about \'Schism,\'" said Mr. Gresley\r\nwith pride, "and I should not wonder if \'Modern Dissent\' caused quite a\r\nferment in Middleshire. If it does, I am willing to bear a little spite\r\nand ill-will. All history shows that truth is met at first by\r\nopposition. Half the country clergy round here are asleep. Good men, but\r\nlax. They want waking up. I said as much to the Bishop the other day,\r\nand he agreed with me; for he said that if some of his younger clergy\r\ncould be waked up to a sense of their own arrogance and narrowness he\r\nwould hold a public thanksgiving in the cathedral. But he added that he\r\nthought nothing short of the last trump would do it."\r\n\r\n"I agree with him," said Hester, having first said the sentence to\r\nherself, and having decided it was innocuous.\r\n\r\nThe climax of the music lesson had arrived. "The Blue Bells of\r\nScotland"--the sole _Clavier St\xfcck_ which Mary\'s rigidly extended little\r\nstarfishes of hands could wrench out of the school-room piano--was at\r\nits third bar.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Gresley, refreshed by a cheering retrospect. "Now for\r\n\'Modern Dissent.\'"\r\n\r\nA strenuous hour ensued.\r\n\r\nHester was torn in different directions, at one moment tempted to allow\r\nthe most flagrant passages to pass unchallenged rather than attempt the\r\nphysical impossibility of interrupting the reader only to be drawn into\r\na dispute with him, at another burning to save her brother from the\r\nconsequences which wait on certain utterances.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Gresley\'s eloquence, after various tortuous and unnatural\r\nwindings, swept in the direction of a pun, as a carriage after following\r\nthe artificial curves of a deceptive approach nears a villa. Hester had\r\nseen the pun coming for half a page, as we see the villa through the\r\ntrees long before we are allowed to approach it, and she longed to save\r\nher brother from what was in her eyes as much a degradation as a _tu\r\nquoque_. But she remembered in time that the Gresleys considered she had\r\nno sense of humor, and she decided to let it pass. Mr. Gresley enjoyed\r\nit so much himself that he hardly noticed her fixed countenance.\r\n\r\nWhy does so deep a gulf separate those who have a sense of humor and\r\nthose who, having none, are compensated by the conviction that they\r\npossess it more abundantly? The crevasse seems to extend far inland to\r\nthe very heights and water-sheds of character. Those who differ on humor\r\nwill differ on principles. The Gresleys and the Pratts belonged to that\r\nlarge class of our fellow-creatures who, conscious of a genius for\r\nadding to the hilarity of our sad planet, discover an irresistible\r\npiquancy in putting a woman\'s hat on a man\'s head, and in that "verbal\r\nromping" which playfully designates a whiskey-and-soda as a gargle, and\r\nsays "au reservoir" instead of "au revoir."\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Hester nervously put her hand over the next sheet, as\r\nhe read the final words of the last.\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment," she said, hurriedly. "This last page, James. Might it\r\nnot be well to reconsider it? Is it politic to assume such great\r\nignorance on the part of Nonconformists? Many I know are better educated\r\nthan I am."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mr. Gresley, "ignorance is at the root of any difference\r\nof opinion on such a subject as this. I do not say wilful ignorance, but\r\nthe want of sound Church teaching. I must cut at the roots of this\r\nignorance."\r\n\r\n"Dear James, it is thrice killing the slain. No one believes these\r\nfallacies which you are exposing--the Nonconformists least of all. Those\r\nI have talked with don\'t hold these absurd opinions that you put down\r\nto them. You don\'t even touch their real position. You are elaborately\r\nknocking down ninepins that have never stood up, because they have\r\nnothing to stand on."\r\n\r\n"I am not proposing to play a game of mental skittles," said the\r\nclerical author. "It is enough for me, as I said before, to cut at the\r\nroots of ignorance wherever I see it flourishing, not to pull off the\r\nleaves one by one as you would have me do by dissecting their opinions.\r\nThis may not be novel, it may not even be amusing, but, nevertheless,\r\nHester, a clergyman\'s duty is to wage unceasing war against spiritual\r\nignorance. And what," read on Mr. Gresley, after a triumphant moment in\r\nwhich Hester remained silent, "is the best means of coping against\r\nignorance, against darkness"--("It was a root a moment ago," thought\r\nHester)--"but by the infusion of light? The light shineth in darkness,\r\nand the darkness comprehendeth it not." Half a page more and the\r\ndarkness was \'Modern Dissent.\' Hester put her hand over her mouth and\r\nkept it there.\r\n\r\nThe familiar drama of a clerical bull and a red rag was played out\r\nbefore her eyes, and, metaphorically speaking, she followed the example\r\nof the majority of laymen and crept up a tree to be out of the way.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over she came down trembling.\r\n\r\n"Well! what do you think of it?" said Mr. Gresley, rising and pacing up\r\nand down the room.\r\n\r\n"You hit very hard," said Hester, after a moment\'s consideration. She\r\ndid not say, "You strike home."\r\n\r\n"I have no opinion of being mealy-mouthed," said Mr. Gresley, who was\r\nalways perfectly satisfied with a vague statement. "If you have anything\r\nworth saying, say it plainly. That is my motto. Don\'t hint this or that,\r\nbut take your stand upon a truth and strike out."\r\n\r\n"Why not hold out our hands to our fellow-creatures instead of striking\r\nat them?" said Hester, moving towards the door.\r\n\r\n"I have no belief in holding out our hands to the enemies of Christ,"\r\nMr. Gresley began, who in the course of his pamphlet had thus gracefully\r\ndesignated the great religious bodies who did not view Christianity\r\nthrough the convex glasses of his own mental _pince-nez_. "In these days\r\nwe see too much of that. I leave that to the Broad Church, who want to\r\nrun with the hare and hunt with the hounds. I, on the contrary--"\r\n\r\nBut Hester had vanished.\r\n\r\nThere was a dangerous glint in her gray eyes, as she ran up to her\r\nlittle attic.\r\n\r\n"According to him, our Lord must have been the first Nonconformist," she\r\nsaid to herself. "If I had stayed a moment longer I should have said so.\r\nFor once I got out of the room in time."\r\n\r\nHester\'s attic was blisteringly hot. It was over the kitchen, and\r\nthrough the open window came the penetrating aroma of roast mutton newly\r\nwedded to boiled cabbage. Hester had learned during the last six months\r\nall the variations of smells, evil, subtle, nauseous, and overpowering,\r\nof which the preparation of food--and, still worse, the preparation of\r\nchicken food--is capable. She seized her white hat and umbrella and fled\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nShe moved quickly across a patch of sunlight, looking, with her large\r\nwhite, pink-lined umbrella, like a travelling mushroom on a slender\r\nstem, and only drew rein in the shady walk near the beehives, where the\r\nold gardener, Abel, was planting something large in the way of "runners"\r\nor "suckers," making a separate hole for each with his thumb.\r\n\r\nAbel was a solid, pear-shaped man, who passed through life bent double\r\nover the acre of Vicarage garden, to which he committed long lines of\r\nseeds, which an attentive Providence brought up in due season as "curly\r\nkebbidge" or "salary" or "sparrow-grass."\r\n\r\nAbel had his back towards Hester, and only the corduroy half of him was\r\nvisible as he stooped over his work. Occasionally he could be induced to\r\nstraighten himself, and--holding himself strongly at the hinge with\r\nearth-ingrained hands--to discourse on polities and religion, and to\r\nopine that our policy in China was "neither my eye nor my elber." "The\r\nlittle lady," as he called Hester, had a knack of drawing out Abel; but\r\nto-day, as he did not see her, she slipped past him, and, crossing the\r\nchurch-yard, sat down for a moment in the porch to regain her breath,\r\nunder the card of printed texts offered for the consideration of his\r\nflock by their young pastor.\r\n\r\n"How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God,"\r\nwas the culling from the Scriptures which headed the selection.[A]\r\nHester knew that card well, though she never by any chance looked at it.\r\nShe had offended her brother deeply by remonstrating, or, as he called\r\nit, by "interfering in church matters," when he nailed it up. After a\r\nfew minutes she dropped over the low church-yard wall into the meadow\r\nbelow, and flung herself down on the grass in the short shadow of a yew\r\nnear at hand. What little air there was to be had came to her across the\r\nDrone, together with the sound of the water lazily nudging the bank and\r\nwhispering to the reeds little jokelets which they had heard a hundred\r\ntimes before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A card, headed by the above text, was seen by the writer in\r\nAugust, 1898, in the porch of a country church.]\r\n\r\nHester\'s irritable nerves relaxed. She stretched out her small, neatly\r\nshod foot in front of her, leaned her back against the wall, and\r\npresently could afford to smile.\r\n\r\n"Dear James," she said, shaking her head gently to and fro, "I wish we\r\nwere not both writers, or, as he calls it, \'dabblers with the pen.\' One\r\ndabbler in a vicarage is quite enough."\r\n\r\nShe took out her letters and read them. Only half of them had been\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n"I shall stay here till the luncheon bell rings," she said, as she\r\nsettled herself comfortably.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s letter was read last, on the principle of keeping the best to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n"And so she is leaving London--isn\'t this rather sudden?--and coming\r\ndown at once--to-day--no, yesterday, to Southminster, to the Palace. And\r\nI am to stay in this afternoon, as she will come over, and probably the\r\nBishop will come too. I should be glad if I were not so tired."\r\n\r\nHester looked along the white high road which led to Southminster. In\r\nthe hot haze she could just see the two ears of the cathedral pricking\r\nup through the blue. Everything was very silent, so silent that she\r\ncould hear the church clock of Slumberleigh, two miles away, strike\r\ntwelve. A whole hour before luncheon!\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s old white horse, with a dip in his long back and a\r\ncorresponding curve in his under outline, was standing motionless in the\r\nsun, fast asleep, his front legs bent like a sailor\'s.\r\n\r\nA little bunch of red and white cows, knee-deep in the water, were\r\nswishing off the flies with the wet tufts of their tails. Hester watched\r\ntheir every movement. She was no longer afraid of cows. Presently, as if\r\nwith one consent, they all made up their minds to relieve the tedium of\r\nthe contemplative life by an exhibition of humor, and, scrambling out of\r\nthe water, proceeded to canter along the bank with stiff raised tails,\r\nwith an artificial noose sustained with difficulty just above the tuft.\r\n\r\n"How like James and the Pratts!" Hester said to herself, watching the\r\ngrotesque gambols and nudgings of the dwindling humorists. "It must be\r\nvery fatiguing to be so comic."\r\n\r\nHester had been up since five o\'clock, utilizing the quiet hours before\r\nthe house was astir. She was tired out. A bumblebee was droning sleepily\r\nnear at hand. The stream talked and talked and talked about what he was\r\ngoing to do when he was a river. "How tired the banks must be of\r\nlistening to him!" thought Hester, with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd the world melted slowly away in a delicious sense of well-being,\r\nfrom which the next moment, as it seemed to her, she was suddenly\r\nawakened by Mr. Gresley\'s voice near at hand.\r\n\r\n"Hester! _Hester_! HESTER!"\r\n\r\n"Here! here!" gasped Hester, with a start, upsetting her lapful of\r\nletters as she scrambled hastily to her feet.\r\n\r\nThe young vicar drew near, and looked over the church-yard wall. A large\r\ncrumb upon his upper lip did not lessen the awful severity of his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"We have nearly finished luncheon," he observed. "The servants could not\r\nfind you anywhere. I don\'t want to be always finding fault, Hester, but\r\nI wish, for your own sake as well as ours, you would be more punctual at\r\nmeals."\r\n\r\nHester had never been late before, but she felt that this was not the\r\nmoment to remind her brother of that fact.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon," she said, humbly. "I fell asleep."\r\n\r\n"You fell asleep!" said Mr. Gresley, who had been wrestling all the\r\nmorning with platitudes on "Thy will be done." "All I can say, Hester,\r\nis that it is unfortunate you have no occupation. I cannot believe it is\r\nfor the good of any of us to lead so absolutely idle a life that we fall\r\nasleep in the morning."\r\n\r\nHester made no reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n     It is as useless to fight against the interpretations of ignorance\r\n     as to whip the fog.--GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children, who had reached the pear stage, looked with round, awed\r\neyes at "Auntie Hester" as she sat down at the luncheon-table beside the\r\nblack bottle which marked her place. The Gresleys were ardent total\r\nabstainers, and were of opinion that Hester\'s health would be greatly\r\nbenefited by following their example. But Hester\'s doctor differed from\r\nthem--he was extremely obstinate--with the result that the Gresleys were\r\nobliged to tolerate the obnoxious bottle on their very table. It was\r\nwhat Mrs. Gresley called a "cross," and Mr. Gresley was always afraid\r\nthat the fact of its presence might become known and hopelessly\r\nmisconstrued in Warpington and the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe children knew that Hester was in disgrace, as she vainly tried to\r\neat the congealed slice of roast mutton, with blue slides in it, which\r\nhad been put before her chair half an hour ago, when the joint was sent\r\nout for the servants\' dinner. The children liked "Auntie Hester," but\r\nwithout enthusiasm, except Regie, the eldest, who loved her as himself.\r\nShe could tell them stories, and make butterflies and horses and dogs\r\nout of paper, but she could never join in their games, not even in the\r\ndelightful new ones she invented for them. She was always tired\r\ndirectly. And she would never give them rides on her back, as the large,\r\ngood-natured Pratt girls did. And she was dreadfully shocked if they did\r\nnot play fair, so much so that on one occasion Mr. Gresley had to\r\ninterfere, and to remind her that a game was a game, and that it would\r\nbe better to let the children play as they liked than to be perpetually\r\nfinding fault with them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing in her life at the Vicarage was a greater trial to\r\nHester than to see the rules of fair play broken by the children with\r\nthe connivance of their parents. Mr. Gresley had never been to a public\r\nschool, and had thus missed the ABC of what in its later stages is\r\ncalled "honor." He was an admirable hockey-player, but he was not in\r\nrequest at the frequent Slumberleigh matches, for he never hit off fair,\r\nor minded being told so.\r\n\r\n"Auntie Hester is leaving all her fat," said Mary, suddenly, in a shrill\r\nvoice, her portion of pear held in her left cheek as she spoke. She had\r\nno idea that she ought not to draw attention to the weakness of others.\r\nShe was only anxious to be the first to offer interesting information.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Mrs. Gresley, admiring her own moderation. "Finish\r\nyour pear."\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing more than another in Hester\'s behavior that\r\nannoyed Mrs. Gresley--and there were several others--it was Hester\'s\r\nmanner of turning her food over on her plate and leaving half of it.\r\n\r\nHester did it again now, and Mrs. Gresley, already irritated by her\r\nunpunctuality, tried to look away so as not to see her, and prayed for\r\npatience. The hundred a year which Hester contributed to the little\r\nestablishment had eased the struggling household in many ways; but Mrs.\r\nGresley sometimes wondered if the money, greatly needed as it was,\r\ncounterbalanced the perpetual friction of her sister-in-law\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"Father!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my son."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it wrong to drink wine?"\r\n\r\nYes, my son."\r\n\r\n"Then why does Auntie Hester drink it?"\r\n\r\nHester fixed her eyes intently on her brother. Would he uphold her\r\nbefore the children?\r\n\r\n"Because she thinks it does her good," said Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her eyes. Her hand, holding a spoonful of cold rice\r\npudding, shook. A delicate color flooded her face, and finally settled\r\nin the tip of her nose. In her own way she loved the children.\r\n\r\n"Ach, mein Herr," almost screamed Fr\xe4ulein, who adored Hester, and saw\r\nthe gravity of the occasion, "aber Sie vergessen that the Herr Doctor\r\nBr-r-r-r-r-own has so strong--so very strong command--"\r\n\r\n"I cannot allow a discussion as to the merits or demerits of alcohol at\r\nmy table," said Mr. Gresley. "I hold one opinion, Dr. Brown holds\r\nanother. I must beg to be allowed to differ from him. Children, say\r\ngrace."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Wednesday and a half-holiday, and Mrs. Gresley had arranged to\r\ntake the children in the pony-carriage to be measured for new boots.\r\nThese expeditions to Westhope were a great event. At two o\'clock exactly\r\nthe three children rushed down-stairs, Regie bearing in his hand his tin\r\nmoney-box, in which a single coin could be heard to leap. Hester\r\nproduced a bright threepenny-piece for each child, one of which was\r\nirretrievably buried in Regie\'s money-box, and the other two immediately\r\nlost in the mat in the pony-carriage. However, Hester found them, and\r\nslipped them inside their white gloves, and the expedition started,\r\naccompanied by Boulou, a diminutive yellow-and-white dog of French\r\nextraction. Boulou was a well-meaning, kind little soul. There was a\r\ncertain hurried arrogance about his hind-legs, but it was only manner.\r\nHe was not in reality more conceited than most small dogs who wear their\r\ntails high.\r\n\r\nHester saw them drive off, and a few minutes later Mr. Gresley started\r\non his bicycle for a ruridecanal chapter meeting in the opposite\r\ndirection. She heard the Vicarage gate "clink" behind him as she crossed\r\nthe little hall, and then she suddenly stopped short and wrung her\r\nhands. She had forgotten to tell either of them that the Bishop of\r\nSouthminster was going to call that afternoon. She knew he was coming on\r\npurpose to see her, but this would have been incredible to the\r\nGresleys. She had not read Rachel\'s letter announcing his coming till\r\nshe had taken refuge in the field where she had fallen asleep, and her\r\nmental equilibrium had been so shaken by the annoyance she felt she had\r\ncaused the Gresleys at luncheon that she had entirely forgotten the\r\nsubject till this moment.\r\n\r\nShe darted out of the house and flew down the little drive. But Fortune\r\nfrowned on Hester to-day. She reached the turn of the road only to see\r\nthe bent figure of Mr. Gresley whisk swiftly out of sight, his clerical\r\ncoat-tails flowing gracefully out behind like a divided skirt on each\r\nside of the back wheel.\r\n\r\nHester toiled back to the house breathless and dusty, and ready to cry\r\nwith vexation. "They will never believe I forgot to tell them," she said\r\nto herself. "Everything I do is wrong in their eyes and stupid in my\r\nown." And she sat down on the lowest step of the stairs and leaned her\r\nhead against the banisters.\r\n\r\nTo her presently came a ministering angel in the shape of Fr\xe4ulein, who\r\nhad begged an egg from the cook, had boiled it over her spirit-lamp, and\r\nnow presented it with effusion to her friend on a little tray, with two\r\nthin slices of bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\n"You are all goodness, Fr\xe4ulein," said Hester, raising her small,\r\nhaggard face out of her hands. "It is wrong of me to give so much\r\ntrouble." She did not want the egg, but she knew its oval was the only\r\nshape in which Fr\xe4ulein could express her silent sympathy. So she\r\naccepted it gratefully, and ate it on the stairs, with the tenderly\r\nsevere Fr\xe4ulein watching every mouthful.\r\n\r\nLife did not seem quite such a hopeless affair when the little meal was\r\nfinished. There were breaks in the clouds, after all. Rachel was coming\r\nto see her that afternoon. Hester was, as Fr\xe4ulein often said, "easy\r\ncast down and easy cast up." The mild stimulant of the egg "cast her up"\r\nonce more. She kissed Fr\xe4ulein and ran up to her room, where she\r\ndivested her small person of every speck of dust contracted on the\r\nroad, smoothed out an invisible crease in her holland gown, put back the\r\nlittle ring of hair behind her ear which had become loosened in her rush\r\nafter her brother, and then came down, smiling and composed, to await\r\nher friend in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHester seldom sat in the drawing-room, partly because it was her\r\nsister-in-law\'s only sitting-room and partly because it was the regular\r\nhaunt of the Pratt girls, who (with what seemed to Hester dreadful\r\nfamiliarity) looked in at the windows when they came to call, and, if\r\nthey saw any one inside, entered straightway by the same, making retreat\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Pratts had been willing, when Hester first came into the\r\nneighborhood, to take a good-natured though precarious interest in\r\n"their Vicar\'s sister." Indeed, Mrs. Gresley had felt obliged to warn\r\nHester not to count too much on their attentions, "as they sometimes\r\ndropped people as quickly as they took them up."\r\n\r\nHester was ignorant of country life, of its small society, its\r\ninevitable relations with unsympathetic neighbors just because they were\r\nneighbors; and she was specially ignorant of the class to which Mrs.\r\nGresley and the Pratts belonged, and from which her aunt had in her\r\nlifetime unwisely guarded her niece as from the plague. She was amazed\r\nat first at the Pratts calling her by her Christian name without her\r\nleave, until she discovered that they spoke of the whole county by their\r\nChristian names, even designating Lord Newhaven\'s two younger\r\nbrothers--with whom they were not acquainted--as Jack and Harry, though\r\nthey were invariably called by their own family John and Henry.\r\n\r\nWhen, after her aunt\'s death, she had, by the advice of her few\r\nremaining relatives, taken up her abode with her brother, as much on his\r\naccount as her own, for he was poor and with an increasing family, she\r\njourneyed to Warpington accompanied by a pleasant feeling that, at any\r\nrate, she was not going among strangers. She had often visited in\r\nMiddleshire, at Wilderleigh, in the elder Mr. Loftus\'s time, for whom\r\nshe had entertained an enthusiastic reverence; at Westhope Abbey, where\r\nshe had a firm ally in Lord Newhaven, and at several other Middleshire\r\nhouses. She was silly enough to think she knew Middleshire fairly well,\r\nbut after she settled at Warpington she gradually discovered the\r\nexistence of a large undercurrent of society of which she knew nothing\r\nat all, in which, whether she were willing or not, she was plunged by\r\nthe fact that she was her brother\'s sister.\r\n\r\nHester perceived clearly enough that her brother did not by birth belong\r\nto this set, though his profession brought him in contact with it, but\r\nhe had evidently, though involuntarily, adopted it for better for worse;\r\nperhaps because a dictatorial habit is generally constrained to find\r\ncompanionship in a social grade lower than its own, where a loud voice\r\nand a tendency to monologue checkered by prehistoric jokes and tortured\r\npuns may meet with a more patient audience. Hester made many discoveries\r\nabout herself during the first months of her life at Warpington, and the\r\nfirst of the series amazed her more than any of the later ones.\r\n\r\nShe discovered that she was proud. Perhaps she had not the enormous\r\nopinion of herself which Mrs. Gresley so frequently deplored, for\r\nHester\'s thoughts seldom dwelt upon herself. But the altered\r\ncircumstances of her life forced them momentarily upon herself\r\nnevertheless, as a burst pipe will spread its waters down a damask\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\nSo far, during the eight years since she had left the school-room, she\r\nhad always been "Miss Gresley," a little personage treated with\r\nconsideration wherever she went, and _choy\xe9e_ for her delicate humor and\r\ntalent for conversation. She now experienced the interesting sensation,\r\nas novel to her as it is familiar to most of us, of being nobody, and\r\nshe disliked it. The manners of the set in which she found herself also\r\ngrated continually on her fastidious taste. She was first amazed and\r\nthen indignant at hearing her old Middleshire friends, whose simplicity\r\nfar surpassed that of her new acquaintance, denounced by the\r\nlatter--without being acquainted with them except officially--as "fine,"\r\nas caring only for "London people," and as being "tuft-hunters," because\r\nthey frequently entertained at their houses persons of rank, to half of\r\nwhom they were related. All this was new to Hester. She discovered that,\r\nthough she might pay visits at these houses, she must never mention\r\nthem, as it was considered the height of vulgarity to speak of people of\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley, who had been quite taken aback when the first of these\r\ninvitations came, felt it her duty to warn Hester against a love of\r\nrank, reminding her that it was a very bad thing to get a name for\r\nrunning after titled people.\r\n\r\n"James and I have always kept clear of that," she remarked, with\r\ndignity. "For my part, I dare say you will think me very old-fashioned,\r\nbut I must own I never can see that people with titles or wealth are one\r\nbit nicer or pleasanter than those without them."\r\n\r\nHester agreed.\r\n\r\n"And," continued Mrs. Gresley, "it has always been our aim to be\r\nindependent, not to bow down before any one. If I am unworldly, it is\r\nbecause I had the advantage of parents who impressed on me the\r\nhollowness of all social distinctions. If the Pratts were given a title\r\nto-morrow I should behave exactly the same to them as I do now."\r\n\r\nIf Lady Susan Gresley had passed her acquaintance through a less\r\nexclusive sieve, Hester might have had the advantage of hearing all\r\nthese well-worn sentiments, and of realizing the point of view of a\r\nlarge number of her fellow-creatures before she became an inconspicuous\r\nunit in their midst.\r\n\r\nBut if Mrs. Gresley was pained by Hester\'s predilection for the society\r\nof what she called "swells" (the word, though quite extinct in civilized\r\nparts, can occasionally be found in country districts), she was still\r\nmore pained by the friendships Hester formed with persons whom her\r\nsister-in-law considered "not quite."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley was always perfectly civil, and the Pratts imperfectly so,\r\nto Miss Brown, the doctor\'s invalid sister. But Hester made friends with\r\nher, in spite of the warnings of Mrs. Gresley that kindness was one\r\nthing and intimacy another.\r\n\r\n"The truth is," Mrs. Gresley would say, "Hester loves adulation, and as\r\nshe can\'t get it from the Pratts and us, she has to go to those below\r\nher in the social scale, like Miss Brown, who will give it to her. Miss\r\nBrown may be very cultivated. I dare say she is, but she makes up to\r\nHester."\r\n\r\nSybell Loftus, who lived close at hand at Wilderleigh, across the Prone,\r\nwas one of the very few besides Miss Brown among her new acquaintances\r\nwho hailed Hester at once as a kindred spirit, to the unconcealed\r\nsurprise of the Pratts and the Gresleys. Sybell adored Hester\'s book,\r\nwhich the Gresleys and Pratts considered rather peculiar "as emanating\r\nfrom the pen of a clergyman\'s sister." She enthusiastically suggested to\r\nHester several improvements which might easily be made in it, which\r\nwould have changed its character altogether. She even intrenched on the\r\nsacred precinct of a married woman\'s time to write out the openings of\r\nseveral romances, which she was sure Hester, with her wonderful talent,\r\ncould build up into magnificent works of art. She was always running\r\nover to the Vicarage to confide to Hester the unique thoughts which had\r\nbeen vouchsafed to her while contemplating a rose, or her child, or her\r\nhusband, or all three together.\r\n\r\nHester was half amused, half fascinated, and ruefully lost many of the\r\nmornings still left her by the Pratts and Gresleys in listening to the\r\noutpourings of this butterfly soul, which imagined every flower it\r\ninvoluntarily alighted on and drew honey from to be its own special\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nBut Hester\'s greatest friend in Middleshire was the Bishop of\r\nSouthminster, with whom Rachel was staying, and whom she was expecting\r\nthis afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n     The depth and dream of my desire,\r\n       The bitter paths wherein I stray,\r\n     Thou knowest Who hast made the Fire,\r\n       Thou knowest Who hast made the clay!\r\n                                --RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unbalanced joys and sorrows of emotional natures are apt to arouse\r\nthe pity of the narrow-hearted and the mild contempt of the obtuse of\r\ntheir fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is a mistake to feel compassion for persons like Hester,\r\nfor if they have many evil days and weeks in their usually short lives,\r\nthey have also moments of sheer bliss, hours of awed contemplation and\r\nof exquisite rapture which, possibly, in the long run, equal the more\r\nsolid joys of a good income and a good digestion, nay, even the\r\nperennial glow of that happiest of happy temperaments which limits the\r\nnature of others by its own, which sees no uncomfortable difference\r\nbetween a moral and a legal right, and believes it can measure life with\r\nthe same admirable accuracy with which it measures its drawing-room\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nAs Hester and Rachel sat together in the Vicarage drawing-room, Rachel\'s\r\nfaithful, doglike eyes detected no trace of tears in Hester\'s dancing,\r\nmischievous ones. They were alone, for the Bishop had dropped Rachel on\r\nhis way to visit a sick clergyman, and had arranged to call at the\r\nVicarage on his way back.\r\n\r\nHester quickly perceived that Rachel did not wish to talk of herself,\r\nand drew a quaint picture of her own life at Warpington, which she\r\ndescribed "not wisely but too well." But she was faithful to her salt.\r\nShe said nothing of the Gresleys to which those worthies could have\r\nobjected had they been present. Indeed, she spoke of them in what they\r\nwould have termed "a very proper manner," of their kindness to her when\r\nshe had been ill, of how Mr. Gresley had himself brought up her\r\nbreakfast-tray every morning, and how, in the spring, he had taught her\r\nto bicycle.\r\n\r\n"But, oh! Rachel," added Hester, "during the last nine months my\r\nself-esteem has been perforated with wounds, each large enough to kill\r\nthe poor creature. My life here has shown me horrible faults in myself\r\nof which I never dreamed. I feel as if I had been ironed all over since\r\nI came here, and all kinds of ugly words in invisible ink are coming out\r\nclear in the process."\r\n\r\n"I am quite alarmed," said Rachel, tranquilly.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be. First of all I did think I cared nothing about food. I\r\ndon\'t remember ever giving it a thought when I lived with Aunt Susan.\r\nBut here I--I am difficult about it. I do try to eat it, but often I\r\nreally can\'t. And then I leave it on my plate, which is a disgusting\r\nhabit, which always offends me in other people. Now I am as bad as any\r\nof them; indeed, it is worse in me because I know poor James is not very\r\nrich."\r\n\r\n"I suppose the cooking is vile?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I never noticed what I ate till I came here, so I can\'t\r\njudge. Perhaps it is not very good. But the dreadful part is that I\r\nshould mind. I could not have believed it of myself. James and Minna\r\nnever say anything, but I know it vexes them, as of course it must."\r\n\r\nRachel looked critically at Hester\'s innocent, childlike face. When\r\nHester was not a cultivated woman of the world she was a child. There\r\nwas, alas! no medium in her character. Rachel noticed how thin her face\r\nand hands had become, and the strained look in the eyes. The faint color\r\nin her cheek had a violet tinge.\r\n\r\nShe did not waste words on the cookery question. She saw plainly enough\r\nthat Hester\'s weak health was slipping further down the hill.\r\n\r\n"And all this time you have been working?"\r\n\r\n"If you call it working. I used to call it so once, but I never do now.\r\nYes, I manage about four hours a day. I have made another pleasant\r\ndiscovery about myself--that I have the temper of a fiend if I am\r\ninterrupted."\r\n\r\n"But surely you told the Gresleys when first you came that you must not\r\nbe interrupted at certain hours?"\r\n\r\n"I did. I did. But, of course--it is very natural--they think that\r\nrather self-important and silly. I am thought very silly here, Rachel.\r\nAnd James does not mind being interrupted in writing his sermons. And\r\nthe Pratts have got the habit of running in in the mornings."\r\n\r\n"Who on earth are the Pratts?"\r\n\r\n"They are what _they_ call \'county people.\' Their father made a fortune\r\nin oil, and built a house covered with turrets near here a few years\r\nago. I used to know Captain Pratt, the son, very slightly in London. I\r\nnever would dance with him. He used to come to our \'At Homes,\' but he\r\nwas never asked to dinner. He is a great \'parti\' among a certain set\r\ndown here. His mother and sisters were very kind to me when I came, but\r\nI was not so accustomed then as I am now to be treated familiarly and\r\ncalled \'Hessie,\' which no one has ever called me before, and I am afraid\r\nI was not so responsive as I see now I ought to have been. Down here it\r\nseems your friends are the people whom you live near, not the ones you\r\nlike. It seems a curious arrangement. And as the Pratts are James\'s and\r\nMinna\'s greatest friends, I did not wish to offend them. And then, of\r\ncourse, I did offend them mortally at last by losing my temper when they\r\ncame up to my room to what they called \'rout me out,\' though I had told\r\nthem I was busy in the mornings. I was in a very difficult place, and\r\nwhen they came in I did not know who they were, because only the people\r\nin the book were real just then. And then when I recognized them, and\r\nthe scene in my mind which I had been waiting for for weeks was\r\nshattered like a pane of glass, I became quite giddy and spoke wildly.\r\nAnd then--I was so ashamed afterwards--I burst into tears of rage and\r\ndespair."\r\n\r\nEven the remembrance was too much. Hester wiped away two large tears\r\nonto a dear little handkerchief just large enough to receive them, and\r\nwent on with a quaver in her voice.\r\n\r\n"I was so shocked at myself that I found it quite easy to tell them next\r\nday that I was sorry I had lost my temper; but they have not been the\r\nsame since. Not that I wanted them to be the same. I would rather they\r\nwere different. But I was anxious to keep on cordial terms with Minna\'s\r\nfriends. She quarrels with them herself, but that is different. I\r\nsuppose it is inevitable if you are on terms of great intimacy with\r\npeople you don\'t really care for."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, _they_ have not interrupted you again?"\r\n\r\n"N--no. But still, I was often interrupted. Minna has too much to do,\r\nand she is not strong just now, and she often sends up one of the\r\nchildren, and I was so nearly fierce with one of them--poor little\r\nthings!--that I felt the risk was becoming too great, so I have left off\r\nwriting between breakfast and luncheon, and I get up directly it is\r\nlight instead. It is light very early now. Only the worst part of it is\r\nthat I am so tired for the rest of the day that I can hardly drag myself\r\nabout."\r\n\r\nRachel said nothing. She seldom commented on the confidences that were\r\nmade to her. She saw that Hester, always delicate, was making an\r\nenormous effort under conditions which would be certain to entail\r\ndisastrous effects on her health. The book was sapping her strength like\r\na vampire, and the Gresleys were evidently exhausting it still further\r\nby unconsciously strewing her path with difficulties. Rachel did not\r\nknow them, but she supposed they belonged to that large class whose eyes\r\nare holden.\r\n\r\n"And the book itself? Is it nearly finished?"\r\n\r\nHester\'s face changed. Eagerly, shyly, enthusiastically she talked to\r\nher friend about the book, as a young girl talks of her lover.\r\nEverything else was forgotten. Hester\'s eyes burned. Her color came and\r\nwent. She was transfigured.\r\n\r\nThe protecting, anxious affection died out of Rachel\'s face as she\r\nlooked at Hester, and gave place to a certain wistful, half-envious\r\nadmiration. She had once been shaken by all these emotions herself,\r\nyears ago, when she was in love. She had regarded them as a revelation\r\nwhile they lasted; and afterwards, as a steep step--a very steep\r\nstep--upon the stair of life. But she realized now that such as Hester\r\nlive constantly in the world which the greater number of us can only\r\nenter when human passion lends us the key; the world at which, when the\r\ngates are shut against us, the coarser minded among us are not ashamed\r\nto level their ridicule and contempt.\r\n\r\nHester spoke brokenly with awe and reverence of her book, as of some\r\nmighty presence, some constraining power outside herself. She saw it\r\ncomplete, beautiful--an entrancing vision, inaccessible, as a sunset.\r\n\r\n"I cannot reach up to it. I cannot get near it," she said. "When I try\r\nto write it, it is like drawing an angel with spread wings with a bit of\r\ncharcoal. I understate everything. Yet I labor day by day travestying\r\nit, caricaturing the beautiful thoughts that come into my mind. I make\r\neverything commonplace and vulgar by putting it into words. I go alone\r\ninto the woods and sit for hours quite still with the trees. And\r\ngradually I understand and know. And I listen, and Nature speaks, really\r\nspeaks--not a _fa\xe7on de parler_, as some people think who explain to you\r\nthat you mean this or that by your words which you don\'t mean--and her\r\nspirit becomes one with my spirit. And I feel I can never again\r\nmisunderstand her, never again fail to interpret her, never again wander\r\nso far away from her that every white anemone and every seedling fern\r\ndisowns me, and waits in silence till the alien has gone from among\r\nthem. And I come home, Rachel, and I try, sometimes I try for half the\r\nnight, to find words to translate it into. But there are no words, or,\r\nif there are, I cannot find them, and at last I fall back on some\r\ncoarse simile, and in my despair I write it down. And, oh! Rachel, the\r\nworst is that presently, when I have forgotten what it ought to have\r\nbeen, when the vision fades, I know I shall _admire_ what I have\r\nwritten. It is that that breaks my heart."\r\n\r\nThe old, old lament of those who worship art, that sternest mistress in\r\nthe world, fell into the silence of the little drawing-room. Rachel\r\nunderstood it in part only, for she had always vaguely felt that Hester\r\nidealized Nature, as she idealized her fellow-creatures, as she\r\nidealized everything, and she did not comprehend why Hester was in\r\ndespair because she could not speak adequately of Life or Nature as she\r\nsaw them. Rachel thought, with bewilderment, that that was just what she\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a carriage drew up at the door, and after a long\r\ninterval, during which the wrathful voice of the cook could be\r\ndistinctly heard through the kitchen window recalling "Hemma" to a sense\r\nof duty from the back yard, "Hemma" breathlessly ushered in the Bishop\r\nof Southminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n     Originality irritates the religious classes, who will not be taken\r\n     out of their indolent ways of thinking; who have a standing\r\n     grievance against it, and "heresy" and "heterodoxy" are bad words\r\n     ready for it.--W.W. PEYTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was an undersized, spare man, with a rugged, weather-beaten\r\nface and sinewy frame. If you had seen him working a crane in a\r\nstone-mason\'s yard, or leading a cut-and-thrust forlorn-hope, or sailing\r\npaper boats with a child, you would have felt he was the right man in\r\nthe right place. That he was also in his right place as a bishop had\r\nnever been doubted by any one. Mr. Gresley was the only person who had\r\noccasionally had misgivings as to the Bishop\'s vocation as a true\r\npriest, but he had put them aside as disloyal.\r\n\r\nJowett is believed to have said, "A bishop without a sense of humor is\r\nlost." Perhaps that may have been one of the reasons why, by Jowett\'s\r\nadvice, the See of Southminster was offered to its present occupant. The\r\nBishop\'s mouth, though it spoke of an indomitable will, had a certain\r\ntwist of the lip, his deep-set, benevolent eyes had a certain twinkle\r\nwhich made persons like Lord Newhaven and Hester hail him at once as an\r\nally, but which ought to have been a danger-signal to some of his\r\nclerical brethren--to Mr. Gresley in particular.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop respected and upheld Mr. Gresley as a clergyman, but as a\r\nconversationalist the young vicar wearied him. If the truth were known\r\n(which it never was), he had arranged to visit Hester when he knew Mr.\r\nGresley would be engaging the reluctant attention of a ruridecanal\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sigh of relief as he became aware that Hester and Rachel were\r\nthe only occupants of the cool, darkened room. Mrs. Gresley, it seemed,\r\nwas also out.\r\n\r\nHester made tea, and presently the Bishop, who looked much exhausted,\r\nroused himself. He had that afternoon attended two death-beds--one the\r\ndeath-bed of a friend, and the other that of the last vestige of peace,\r\nexpiring amid the clamor of a distracted Low Church parish and High\r\nChurch parson, who could only meet each other after the fashion of\r\ncymbals. For the moment even his courageous spirit had been\r\ndisheartened.\r\n\r\n"I met a son of Anak the other night at the Newhavens\'," he said to\r\nHester, "who claimed you as a cousin--a Mr. Richard Vernon. He broke the\r\nice by informing me that I had confirmed him, and that perhaps I should\r\nlike to know that he had turned out better than he expected."\r\n\r\n"How like Dick!" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"I remembered him at last. His father was the squire of Farlow, where I\r\nwas rector before I came to Southminster. Dick was not a source of\r\nunmixed pleasure to his parents. As a boy of eight he sowed the parental\r\nbilliard-table with mustard and cress in his father\'s absence, and\r\nraised a very good crop, and performed other excruciating experiments. I\r\nbelieve he beat all previous records of birch rods at Eton. I remember\r\nwhile he was there he won a bet from another boy who could not pay, and\r\nhe foreclosed on the loser\'s cricketing trousers. His parents were\r\ndistressed about it when he brought them home, and I tried to make him\r\nsee that he ought not to have taken them. But Dick held firm. He said it\r\nwas like tithe, and if he could not get his own in money, as I did, he\r\nmust collect it in trousers. I must own he had me there. I noticed that\r\nhe wore the garment daily as long as any question remained in his\r\nparents\' minds as to whether they ought to be returned. After that I\r\nfelt sure he would succeed in life."\r\n\r\n"I believe he is succeeding in Australia."\r\n\r\n"I advised his father to send him abroad. There really was not room for\r\nhim in England, and, unfortunately for the army, the examiners jibbed at\r\nhis strictly phonetic spelling. He tells me he has given up being an\r\nA.D.C. and has taken to vine-growing, because if people are up in the\r\nworld they always drink freely, and if they are \'down on their luck\'\r\nthey drink all the more to drown care. The reasoning appeared to me\r\nsound."\r\n\r\n"He and James used to quarrel frightfully in the holidays," said Hester.\r\n"It was always the same reason, about playing fair. Poor James did not\r\nknow that games were matters of deadly importance, and that a rule was a\r\nsacred thing. I wonder why it is that clergymen so often have the same\r\ncode of honor as women; quite a different code from that of the average\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I think," said the Bishop, "it is owing to that difference of code that\r\nwomen clash so hopelessly with men when they attempt to compete or work\r\nwith them. Women have not to begin with the _esprit de corps_ which the\r\nmost ordinary men possess. With what difficulty can one squeeze out of a\r\nman any fact that is detrimental to his friend, or even to his\r\nacquaintance, however obviously necessary it may be that the information\r\nshould be asked for and given. Yet I have known many good and earnest\r\nand affectionate women, who lead unselfish lives, who will \'give away\'\r\ntheir best woman friend at the smallest provocation, or without any\r\nprovocation at all; will inform you, _\xe0 propos_ of nothing, that she was\r\njilted years ago, or that her husband married her for her money. The\r\ncauses of humiliation and disaster in a woman\'s life seem to have no\r\nsacredness for her women friends. Yet if that same friend whom she has\r\nrun down is ill, the runner down will nurse her day and night with\r\nabsolutely selfless devotion."\r\n\r\n"I have often been puzzled by that," said Rachel. "I seem to be always\r\nmaking mistakes about women, and perhaps that is the reason. They show\r\nthemselves capable of some deep affection or some great self-sacrifice,\r\nand I respect and admire them, and think they are like that all\r\nthrough. And the day comes when they are not quite straightforward, or\r\nare guilty of some petty meanness, which a man who is not fit to black\r\ntheir boots would never stoop to."\r\n\r\nHester\'s eyes fixed on her friend.\r\n\r\n"Do you tell them? Do you show them up to themselves," she asked, "or do\r\nyou leave them?"\r\n\r\n"I do neither," said Rachel. "I treat them just the same as before."\r\n\r\n"Then aren\'t you a hypocrite, too?"\r\n\r\nHester\'s small face was set like a flint.\r\n\r\n"I think not," said Rachel, tranquilly, "any more than they are. The\r\ngood is there for certain, and the evil is there for certain. Why should\r\nI take most notice of the evil, which is just the part which will be\r\nrubbed out of them presently, while the good will remain?"\r\n\r\n"I think Rachel is right," said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she is, at all," said Hester, her plumage ruffled,\r\nadministering her contradiction right and left to her two best friends\r\nlike a sharp peck from a wren. "I think we ought to believe the best of\r\npeople until they prove themselves unworthy, and then--"\r\n\r\n"Then what?" said the Bishop, settling himself in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Then leave them in silence."\r\n\r\n"I only know of a woman\'s silence by hearsay. I have never met it. Do\r\nyou mean bitterly reproach the thistle for not bearing grapes?"\r\n\r\n"I do not. It is my own fault if I idealize a thistle until the thistle\r\nand I both think it is a vine. But if people appear to love and honor\r\ncertain truths which they know are everything to me, and claim kinship\r\nwith me on that common ground, and then desert when the pinch comes, as\r\nit always does come, and act from worldly motives, then I know that they\r\nhave never really cared for what they professed to love, that what I\r\nimagined to be a principle was only a subject of conversation--and--I\r\nwithdraw."\r\n\r\n"You withdraw!" echoed the Bishop. "This is terrible."\r\n\r\n"Just as I should," continued Hester, "if I were in political life. If a\r\nman threw in his lot with me, and then, when some means of worldly\r\nadvancement seemed probable from the other side, deserted to it, I\r\nshould not in consequence think him incapable of being a good husband\r\nand father and landlord. But I should never again believe that he cared\r\nfor what I had staked my all on. And when he began to talk as if he\r\ncared (as they always do, as if nothing had happened) I should not show\r\nhim up to himself. I have tried that and it is no use. I should--"\r\n\r\n"Denounce him as an apostate?" suggested the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"No. He should be to me thenceforward as a heathen."\r\n\r\n"Thrice miserable man!"\r\n\r\n"You would not have me treat him as a brother after that?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not, because he would probably dislike that still more."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a hurricane seemed to pass through the little house, and\r\nthe three children rushed into the drawing-room, accompanied by Boulou,\r\nin a frantic state of excitement. Boulou, like Hester, had no happy\r\nmedium in his character. He was what Mrs. Gresley called "very Frenchy,"\r\nand he now showed his Frenchyness by a foolish exhibition of himself in\r\ncoursing round and round the room with his silly foreign tail crooked\r\nthe wrong way.\r\n\r\n"Mother got out at Mrs. Brown\'s," shrieked Regie, in his highest voice,\r\n"and I drove up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Regie!" expostulated Mary the virtuous, the invariable corrector of\r\nthe statements of others. "You held the reins, but William walked\r\nbeside."\r\n\r\nHester made the children shake hands with her guests, and then they\r\nclustered round her to show what they had bought.\r\n\r\nThough the Bishop was fond of children, he became suddenly restive. He\r\ntook out his watch, and was nervously surprised at the lapse of time.\r\nThe carriage was sent for, and in a few minutes that dignified vehicle\r\nwas bowling back to Southminster.\r\n\r\n"I am not satisfied about Hester," said the Bishop. "She looks ill and\r\nirritable, and she has the tense expression of a person who is making a\r\ncolossal effort to be patient, and whose patience, after successfully\r\nmeeting twenty calls upon it in the course of the day, collapses\r\nentirely at the twenty-first. That is a humiliating experience."\r\n\r\n"She spoke as if she were a trial to her brother and his wife."\r\n\r\n"I think she is. I have a sort of sympathy with Gresley as regards his\r\nsister. He has been kind to her according to his lights, and if she\r\ncould write little goody-goody books he would admire her immensely, and\r\nso would half the neighborhood. It would be felt to be suitable. But\r\nHester jars against the preconceived ideas which depute that clergymen\'s\r\nsisters and daughters should, as a matter of course, offer up their\r\nyouth and hair and teeth and eyesight on the altar of parochial work.\r\nShe does and is nothing that long custom expects her to do and be.\r\nOriginality is out of place in a clergyman\'s family, just because it is\r\nso urgently needed. It is a constant source of friction. But, on the\r\nother hand, the best thing that could happen to Hester is to be thrown\r\nfor a time among people who regard her as a nonentity, who have no sense\r\nof humor, and to whom she cannot speak of any of the subjects she has at\r\nheart. If Hester had remained in London after the success of her _Idyll_\r\nshe would have met with so much sympathy and admiration that her next\r\nbook would probably have suffered in consequence. She is so susceptible,\r\nso expansive, that repression is positively necessary to her to enable\r\nher, so to speak, to get up steam. There is no place for getting up\r\nsteam like a country vicarage with an inner cordon of cows round it and\r\nan outer one of amiable country neighbors, mildly contemptuous of\r\noriginality in any form. She cannot be in sympathy with them in her\r\npresent stage. It is her loss, not theirs. At forty she will be in\r\nsympathy with them, and appreciate them as I do; but that is another\r\nstory. She has been working at this new book all winter with a fervor\r\nand concentration which her isolation has helped to bring about. She\r\nowes a debt of gratitude to her surroundings, and some day I shall tell\r\nher so."\r\n\r\n"She says her temper has become that of a fiend."\r\n\r\n"She is passionate, there is no doubt. She nearly fell on us both this\r\nafternoon. She is too much swayed by every little incident. Everything\r\nmakes a vivid impression on her and shakes her to pieces. It is rather\r\nabsurd and disproportionate now, like the long legs of a foal, but it is\r\na sign of growth. My experience is that people without that fire of\r\nenthusiasm on the one side and righteous indignation on the other never\r\nachieve anything except in domestic life. If Hester lives, she will\r\noutgrow her passionate nature, or at least she will grow up to it and\r\nbecome passive, contemplative. Then, instead of unbalanced anger and\r\nexcitement, the same nature which is now continually upset by them will\r\nhave learned to receive impressions calmly and, by reason of that\r\nreceptiveness and insight, she will go far."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n     Only those who know the supremacy of the Intellectual life--the\r\n     life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within\r\n     it--can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene\r\n     activity into the absorbing soul-wasting struggle with worldly\r\n     annoyances.--GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHester in the meanwhile was expressing wonder and astonishment at the\r\npurchases of the children, who, with the exception of Mary, had spent\r\ntheir little all on presents for Fr\xe4ulein, whose birthday was on the\r\nmorrow. After Mary\'s tiny white bone umbrella had been discovered to be\r\na needle-case, and most of the needles had been recovered from the\r\nfloor, Regie extracted from its paper a little china cow. But, alas! the\r\ncow\'s ears and horns remained in the bag, owing possibly to the\r\nincessant passage of the parcel from one pocket to another on the way\r\nhome. Regie looked at the remnants in the bag, and his lip quivered,\r\nwhile Mary, her own umbrella safely warehoused, exclaimed, "Oh, Regie!"\r\nin tones of piercing reproach.\r\n\r\nBut Hester quickly suggested that she could put them on again quite\r\neasily, and Fr\xe4ulein would like it just as much. Still, it was a blow.\r\nRegie leaned his head against Hester\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\nHester pressed her cheek against his little dark head. Sybell Loftus had\r\noften told Hester that she could have no idea of the happiness of a\r\nchild\'s touch till she was a mother; that she herself had not an inkling\r\ntill then. But perhaps some poor substitute for that exquisite feeling\r\nwas vouchsafed to Hester.\r\n\r\n"The tail is still on," she whispered, not too cheerfully, but as one\r\nwho in darkness sees light beyond.\r\n\r\nThe cow\'s tail was painted in blue upon its side.\r\n\r\n"When I bought it," said Regie, in a strangled voice, "and it was a\r\ngreat-deal-of-money cow, I did wish its tail had been out behind; but I\r\nthink now it is safer like that."\r\n\r\n"All the best cows have their tails on the side," said Hester. "And\r\nto-morrow morning, when you are dressed, run up to my room, and you will\r\nfind it just like it was before." And she carefully put aside the bits\r\nwith the injured animal.\r\n\r\n"And now what has Stella got?"\r\n\r\nStella produced a bag of "bull\'s-eyes," which, in striking contrast with\r\nthe cow, had, in the course of the drive home, cohered so tightly\r\ntogether that it was doubtful if they would ever be separated again.\r\n\r\n"Fr\xe4ulein never eats bull\'s-eyes," said Mary, who was what her parents\r\ncalled "a very truthful child."\r\n\r\n"I eats them," said Stella, reversing her small cauliflower-like person\r\non the sofa till only a circle of white rims with a nucleus of coventry\r\nfrilling, with two pink legs kicking gently upward, were visible.\r\n\r\nStella always turned upsidedown if the conversation took a personal\r\nturn. In later and more conventional years we find a poor equivalent for\r\nmarking our disapproval by changing the subject.\r\n\r\nHester had hardly set Stella right side upward when the door opened once\r\nmore and Mrs. Gresley entered, hot and exhausted.\r\n\r\n"Run up-stairs, my pets," she said. "Hester, you should not keep them\r\ndown here now. It is past their tea-time."\r\n\r\n"We came ourselves, mother," said Regie. "Fru\xe4lein said we might, to\r\nshow Auntie Hester our secrets."\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind; run away now," said the poor mother, sitting down\r\nheavily in a low chair, "and take Boulou."\r\n\r\n"You are tired out," said Hester, slipping on to her knees and unlacing\r\nher sister-in-law\'s brown boots.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley looked with a shade of compunction at the fragile kneeling\r\nfigure, with its face crimsoned by the act of stooping and by the\r\nobduracy of the dust-ingrained boot-laces. But as she looked she noticed\r\nthe flushed cheeks, and, being a diviner of spirits, wondered what\r\nHester was ashamed of now.\r\n\r\nAs Hester rose her sister-in-law held out, with momentary hesitation, a\r\nthin paper bag, in which an oval form allowed its moist presence to be\r\ndiscerned by partial adhesion to its envelope.\r\n\r\n"I saw you ate no luncheon, Hester, so I have brought you a little sole\r\nfor supper."\r\n\r\nSome of us poor Marthas spend all our existence, so to speak, in the\r\nkitchens of life. We never get so far as the drawing-room. Our\r\nconquests, our self-denials, are achieved through the medium of suet and\r\nlard and necks of mutton. We wrestle with the dripping, and rise on\r\nstepping-stones--not of our dead selves, but of sheep and oxen--to\r\nhigher things.\r\n\r\nThe sole was a direct answer to prayer. Mrs. Gresley had been enabled to\r\nstifle her irritation against this delicate, whimsical, fine lady of a\r\nsister-in-law--laced in, too, we must not forget that--who, in Mrs.\r\nGresley\'s ideas, knew none of the real difficulties of life, its\r\nbutcher\'s bills, its monthly nurses, its constant watchfulness over\r\ndelicate children, its long, long strain at two ends which won\'t meet.\r\nWe must know but little of our fellow-creatures if the damp sole in the\r\nbag appears to us other than the outward and homely sign of an inward\r\nand spiritual conquest.\r\n\r\nAs such Hester saw it, and she kissed Mrs. Gresley and thanked her, and\r\nthen ran, herself, to the kitchen with the peace offering, and came back\r\nwith her sister-in-law\'s down-at-heel in-door shoes.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was stabling his bicycle in the hall as she crossed it. He\r\nwas generally excessively jocose with his bicycle. He frequently said,\r\n"Whoa, Emma!" to it. But to-day he, too, was tired, and put Emma away in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhen Hester returned to the drawing-room Mrs. Gresley had recovered\r\nsufficiently to notice her surroundings. She was sitting with her\r\ntan-stockinged feet firmly planted on the carpet instead of listlessly\r\noutstretched, her eyes ominously fixed on the tea-table and seed-cake.\r\n\r\nHester\'s silly heart nudged her side like an accomplice.\r\n\r\n"Who has been here to tea?" said Mrs. Gresley. "I met the Pratts and the\r\nThursbys in Westhope."\r\n\r\nHester was frightened. We need to be in the presence of those who judge\r\nothers by themselves.\r\n\r\n"The Bishop was here and Rachel West," she said, coloring. "They left a\r\nfew minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"Well, of all unlucky things, that James and I should have been out.\r\nJames, do you hear that? The Bishop\'s been while we were away. And I do\r\ndeclare, Hester," looking again at the table, "you never so much as\r\nasked for the silver teapot."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of it," said Hester, ruefully. It was almost impossible\r\nto her to alter the habit of a lifetime, and to remember to dash out and\r\nhurriedly change the daily routine if visitors were present. Lady Susan\r\nhad always used her battered old silver teapot every day, and for the\r\nlife of her Hester could not understand why there should be one kind one\r\nday and one kind another. She glanced resentfully at the little brown\r\nearthen-ware vessel which she had wielded so carefully half an hour ago.\r\nWhy did she never remember the Gresleys\' wishes?\r\n\r\n"Hester," said Mrs. Gresley, suddenly, taking new note of Hester\'s\r\nimmaculate brown holland gown, which contrasted painfully with her own\r\ndilapidated pink shirt with hard collars and cuffs and imitation tie,\r\ntied for life in the shop where it was born. "You are so smart; I do\r\nbelieve you knew they were coming."\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing more than another which offended Hester, it was\r\nbeing told that she was _smart_.\r\n\r\n"I trust I am never smart," she replied, not with any touch of the\r\nhaughtiness that some ignorant persons believe to be the grand manner,\r\nbut with a subtle change of tone and carriage which seemed instantly to\r\nremove her to an enormous distance from the other woman with her\r\ninsinuation and tan stockings. Mrs. Gresley unconsciously drew in her\r\nfeet. "I did not know when I dressed this morning that the Bishop was\r\ncoming to-day."\r\n\r\n"Then you _did_ know later that he was coming?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Rachel West wrote to tell me so this morning, but I did not open\r\nher letter at breakfast, and I was so vexed at being late for luncheon\r\nthat I forgot to mention it then. I remembered as soon as James had\r\nstarted, and ran after him, but he was too far off to hear me call to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nIt cost Hester a good deal to give this explanation, as she was aware\r\nthat the Bishop\'s visit had been to her and to her alone.\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said Mr. Gresley, judicially, with the natural masculine\r\nabhorrence of a feminine skirmish.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go on making foolish excuses, Hester, which deceive no one; and\r\nyou, Minna, don\'t criticise Hester\'s clothes. It is the Bishop\'s own\r\nfault for not writing his notes himself. He might have known that Miss\r\nWest would have written to Hester instead of to me. I can\'t say I think\r\nHester behaved kindly towards us in acting as she did, but I won\'t hear\r\nany more argument about it. I desire the subject should now _drop_."\r\n\r\nThe last words were uttered in the same tone in which Mr. Gresley closed\r\nmorning service, and were felt to be final. He was not in reality\r\ngreatly chagrined at missing the Bishop, whom he regarded with some of\r\nthe suspicious distrust with which a certain class of mind ever regards\r\nthat which is superior to it. Hester left the room, closing the door\r\ngently behind her.\r\n\r\n"James," said Mrs. Gresley, looking at her priest with tears of\r\nadmiration in her eyes, "I shall never be good like you, so you need not\r\nexpect it. How you can be so generous and patient with her I don\'t know.\r\nIt passes me."\r\n\r\n"We must learn to make allowances for each other," said Mr. Gresley, in\r\nhis most affectionate cornet, drawing his tired, tearful little wife\r\ndown beside him on the sofa. And he made some fresh tea for her, and\r\nwaited on her, and she told him about the children\'s boots and the sole,\r\nand he told her about a remarkable speech he had made at the chapter\r\nmeeting, and a feeling that had been borne in on him on the way home\r\nthat he should shortly write something striking about Apostolic\r\nSuccession. And they were happy together; for though he sometimes\r\nreproved her as a priest if she allowed herself to dwell on the\r\nprobability of his being made a Bishop, he was very kind to her as a\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n     "Beware of a silent dog and still water."\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are travelling across Middleshire on the local line between\r\nSouthminster and Westhope, after you have passed Wilderleigh with its\r\ngray gables and park wall, close at hand you will perceive to nestle (at\r\nleast, Mr. Gresley said it nestled) Warpington Vicarage; and perhaps, if\r\nyou know where to look, you will catch a glimpse of Hester\'s narrow\r\nbedroom window under the roof. Half a mile farther on Warpington Towers,\r\nthe gorgeous residence of the Pratts, bursts into view, with flag on\r\nturret flying, and two tightly bitted rustic bridges leaping high over\r\nthe Drone. You cannot see all the lodges of Warpington Towers from the\r\nline, which is a source of some regret to Mr. Pratt; but if he happens\r\nto be travelling with you he will point out two of them, chaste stucco\r\nGothic erections with church windows, and inform you that the three\r\nothers are on the northern and eastern sides, vaguely indicating the\r\ndirections of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nAnd the Drone, kept in order on your left by the low line of the\r\nSlumberleigh hills, will follow you and leave you, leave you and return\r\nall the way to Westhope. You are getting out at Westhope, of course, if\r\nyou are a Middleshire man; for Westhope is on the verge of Middleshire,\r\nand the train does not go any farther--at least, it only goes into one\r\nof the insignificant counties which jostle each other to hold on to\r\nMiddleshire, unknown Saharas, where passengers who oversleep themselves\r\nwake to find themselves cast away.\r\n\r\nWesthope Abbey stands in its long, low meadows and level gardens, close\r\nto the little town, straggling red roof above red roof, up its steep\r\ncobbled streets.\r\n\r\nDown the great central aisle you may walk on mossy stones between the\r\nhigh shafts of broken pillars under the sky. God\'s stars look down once\r\nmore where the piety of man had for a time shut them out. Through the\r\nslender tracery of what was once the east window, instead of glazed\r\nsaint and crucifix, you may see the little town clasping its hill.\r\n\r\nThe purple clematis and the small lizard-like leaf of the ivy have laid\r\ntender hands on all that is left of that stately house of prayer. The\r\npigeons wheel round it, and nest in its niches. The soft, contented\r\nmurmur of bird praise has replaced the noise of bitter human prayer. A\r\nthin wind-whipped grass holds the summit of the broken walls against all\r\ncorners. The fallen stones, quaintly carved with angel and griffin, are\r\ngoing slowly back year by year, helped by the rain and hindered by the\r\nfrost, slowly back through the sod to the generations of human hands\r\nthat held and hewed them, and fell to dust below them hundreds of years\r\nago. The spirit returns to the God who gave it, and the stone to the\r\nhand that fashioned it.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining monastery had been turned into a dwelling-house, without\r\naltering it externally, and it was here that Lord Newhaven loved to pass\r\nthe summer months. Into its one long upper passage all the many rooms\r\nopened, up white stone steps through arched doors, rooms which had once\r\nbeen monks\' dormitories, abbots\' cells, where Lady Newhaven and her\r\nguests now crimped their hair and slept under down quilts till noon.\r\n\r\nIt was this long passage, with its interminable row of low latticed\r\nwindows, that Lord Newhaven was turning into a depository for the old\r\nEnglish weapons which he was slowly collecting. He was standing now\r\ngazing lovingly at them, drawing one finger slowly along an inlaid\r\narquebus, when a yell from the garden made him turn and look out.\r\n\r\nIt was not a yell of anguish, and Lord Newhaven remained at the window\r\nleaning on his elbows and watching at his ease the little scene which\r\nwas taking place below him.\r\n\r\nOn his bicycle on the smooth-shaven lawn was Dick, wheeling slowly in\r\nand out among the stone-edged flower-beds, an apricot in each broad\r\npalm, while he discoursed in a dispassionate manner to the two excited\r\nlittle boys who were making futile rushes for the apricots. The\r\ngoverness and Rachel were looking on. Rachel had arrived at Westhope the\r\nday before from Southminster. "Take your time, my son," said Dick, just\r\neluding by a hair\'s-breadth a charge through a geranium-bed on the part\r\nof the eldest boy. "If you are such jolly little fools as to crack your\r\nlittle skulls on the sun-dial, I shall eat them both myself. Miss Turner\r\nsays you may have them, so you\'ve only got to take them. I can\'t keep on\r\noffering them all day long. My time"--(Dick ran his bicycle up a\r\nterrace, and, as soon as the boys were up, glided down again)--"my time\r\nis valuable. You don\'t want them?" A shrill disclaimer and a fresh\r\nonslaught. "Miss Turner, they thank you very much, but they don\'t care\r\nfor apricots."\r\n\r\nHalf a second more and Dick skilfully parted from his bicycle and was\r\ncharged by his two admirers and severely pummelled as high as they could\r\nreach. When they had been led away by Miss Turner, each biting an\r\napricot and casting longing backward looks at their friend, Rachel and\r\nDick wandered to the north side of the abbey and sat down there in the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven could still see them, could still note her amused face\r\nunder her wide white hat. He was doing his best for Dick, and Dick was\r\ncertainly having his chance, and making the most of it according to his\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n"But, all the same, I don\'t think he has a chance," said Lord Newhaven\r\nto himself. "That woman, in spite of her frank manner and her\r\nself-possession, is afraid of men; not of being married for her money,\r\nbut of man himself. And whatever else he may not be, Dick is a man.\r\nIt\'s the best chance she will ever get, so it is probable she won\'t take\r\nit."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven sauntered back down the narrow black oak staircase to his\r\nown room on the ground-floor. He sat down at his writing-table and took\r\nout of his pocket a letter which he had evidently read before. He now\r\nread it slowly once more.\r\n\r\n"Your last letter to me had been opened," wrote his brother from India,\r\n"or else it had not been properly closed. As you wrote on business, I\r\nwish you would be more careful."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Lord Newhaven, and he wrote a short letter in his small,\r\nupright hand, closed the envelope, addressed and stamped it, and\r\nsauntered out through the low-arched door into the garden.\r\n\r\nDick was sitting alone on the high-carved stone edge of the round pool\r\nwhere the monks used to wash, and where gold-fish now lived cloistered\r\nlives. A moment of depression seemed to have overtaken that cheerful\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\n"Come as far as the post-office," said Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\nDick gathered himself together, and rose slowly to his large feet.\r\n\r\n"You millionaires are all the same," he said. "Because you have a house\r\ncrawling with servants till they stick to the ceiling you have to go to\r\nthe post-office to buy a penny stamp. It\'s like keeping a dog and\r\nbarking yourself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t fancy I bark much," said Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"No, and you don\'t bite _often_, but when you do you take out the piece.\r\nDo you remember that colored chap at Broken Hill?"\r\n\r\n"He deserved it," said Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"He richly deserved it. But you took him in, poor devil, all the same.\r\nYou were so uncommonly mild and limp beforehand, and letting pass things\r\nyou ought not to have let pass, that, like the low beast he was, he\r\nthought he could play you any dog\'s trick, and that you would never\r\nturn on him."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a way worms have."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hang worms; it does not matter whether they turn or not. But cobras\r\nhave no business to imitate them till poor rookies think they have no\r\npoison in them, and that they can tickle them with a switch. What a\r\ngreat hulking brute that man was! You ricked him when you threw him! I\r\nsaw him just before I left Adelaide. He\'s been lame ever since."\r\n\r\n"He\'d have done for me if he could."\r\n\r\n"Of course he would. His blood was up. He meant to break your back. I\r\nsaw him break a chap\'s back once, and it did not take so very long\r\neither. I heard it snap. But why did you let him go so far to start with\r\nbefore you pulled him up? That\'s what I\'ve never been able to understand\r\nabout you. If you behaved different to start with they would behave\r\ndifferent to you. They would know they\'d have to."\r\n\r\n"I have not your art," said Lord Newhaven, tranquilly, "of letting a man\r\nknow when he\'s getting out of hand that unless he goes steady there will\r\nbe a row, and he\'ll be in it. I\'m not made like that."\r\n\r\n"It works well," said Dick. "It\'s a sort of peaceful way of rubbing\r\nalong and keeping friends. If you let those poor bullies know what to\r\nexpect they aren\'t, as a rule, over-anxious to toe the mark. But you\r\nnever _do_ let them know."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lord Newhaven, as he shot his letter into the brass mouth in\r\nthe cottage wall, just below a window of "bulls\'-eyes" and peppermints,\r\n"I never do. I don\'t defend it. But--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven\'s face underwent some subtle change. His eyes fixed\r\nthemselves on a bottle of heart-shaped peppermints, and then met Dick\'s\r\nsuddenly, with the clear, frank glance of a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"But somehow, for the life of me, until things get serious--_I can\'t_."\r\n\r\nDick, whose perceptions were rather of a colossal than an acute order,\r\nnevertheless perceived that he had received a confidence, and changed\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to buy some stamps?" he asked, perfectly aware that\r\nLord Newhaven had had his reasons for walking to the post-office.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven, who was being watched with affectionate interest from\r\nbehind the counter by the grocer postmaster, went in, hit his head\r\nagainst a pendent ham, and presently emerged with brine in his hair and\r\na shilling\'s worth of stamps in his hand.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, when he and Dick were riding up the little street,\r\nwith a view to having a look at the moor--for Middleshire actually has a\r\ngrouse moor, although it is in the Midlands--the grocer in his white\r\napron rushed out and waylaid them.\r\n\r\n"Very sorry about the letter, my lord," he repeated volubly, touching\r\nhis forelock. "Hope her la\'ship told you as I could not get it out\r\nagain, or I\'m sure I would have done to oblige your lordship, and her\r\nla\'ship calling on purpose. But the post-office is that mean and\r\ndistrustful as it don\'t leave me the key, and once hanything is in, in\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Lord Newhaven, slowly. "Well, Jones, it\'s not your fault. I\r\nought not to have changed my mind. I suppose her ladyship gave you my\r\nmessage that I wanted it back?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord, and her la\'ship come herself, not ten minutes after you\r\nwas gone. But I\'ve no more power over that there receptacle than a\r\nhunlaid hegg, and that\'s the long and short of it. I\'ve allus said, and\r\nI say it again, \'Them as have charge of the post-office should have the\r\nkey.\'"\r\n\r\n"When I am made postmaster-general you _shall_ have it," said Lord\r\nNewhaven, smiling. "It is the first reform that I shall bring about."\r\nAnd he nodded to the smiling, apologetic man and trotted on, Dick beside\r\nhim, who was apparently absorbed in the action of his roan cob.\r\n\r\nBut Dick\'s mind had sustained a severe shock. That Lady Newhaven, "that\r\njolly little woman," the fond mother of those two "jolly little chaps,"\r\nshould have been guilty of an underhand trick, was astonishing to him.\r\n\r\nPoor Dick had started life with a religious reverence for woman; had\r\ncarried out his brittle possession to bush-life in Australia, from\r\nthence through two A.D.C.-ships, and, after many vicissitudes, had\r\nbrought it safely back with a large consignment of his own Burgundy to\r\nhis native land. It was still sufficiently intact--save for a chip or\r\ntwo--to make a pretty wedding-present to his future wife. But it had had\r\na knock since he mounted the roan cob. For, unfortunately, the kind of\r\nman who has what are called "illusions" about women is too often the man\r\nwhose discrimination lies in other directions, in fields where little\r\nhigh-heeled shoes are not admitted.\r\n\r\nRachel had the doubtful advantage of knowing that, in spite of Dick\'s\r\nshrewdness respecting shades of difference in muscatels, she and Lady\r\nNewhaven were nevertheless ranged on the same pedestal in Dick\'s mind as\r\nflawless twins of equal moral beauty. But after this particular day she\r\nobserved that Lady Newhaven had somehow slipped off the pedestal, and\r\nthat she, Rachel, had the honor of occupying it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n     "Une grande passion malheureaux est un grand moyen de sagesse."\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel had left London precipitately after she had been the unwilling\r\nconfidante of Lady Newhaven\'s secret, and had taken refuge with that\r\nfriend of all perplexed souls, the Bishop of Southminster. She felt\r\nunable to meet Hugh again without an interval of breathing-time. She\r\nknew that if she saw much more of him he would confide in her, and she\r\nshrank from receiving a confidence the ugliest fact of which she already\r\nknew. Perhaps she involuntarily shrank also from fear lest he should\r\nlower himself in her eyes by only telling her half the truth. Sad\r\nconfessions were often poured into Rachel\'s ears which she had known for\r\nyears. She never alluded to that knowledge, never corrected the half-lie\r\nwhich accompanies so many whispered self--accusations. Confidences and\r\nconfessions are too often a means of evasion of justice--a laying of the\r\ncase for the plaintiff before a judge without allowing the defendant to\r\nbe present or to call a witness. Rachel, by dint of long experience,\r\nwhich did slowly for her the work of imagination, had ceased to wonder\r\nat the faithfully chronicled harsh words and deeds of generous souls.\r\nShe knew or guessed at the unchronicled treachery or deceit which had\r\nbrought about that seemingly harsh word or deed.\r\n\r\nShe had not the exalted ideas about her fellow-creatures which Hester\r\nhad, but she possessed the rare gift of reticence. She exemplified the\r\ntext--"Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men\'s lives."\r\nAnd in Rachel\'s quiet soul a vast love and pity dwelt for these same\r\nfellow-creatures. She had lived and worked for years among those whose\r\nbodies were half starved, half clothed, degraded. When she found money\r\nat her command she had spent sums (as her lawyer told her) out of all\r\nproportion on that poor human body, stumbling between vice and\r\nstarvation. But now, during the last year, when her great wealth had\r\nthrown her violently into society, she had met, until her strong heart\r\nflinched before it, the other side of life--the starved soul in the\r\ndelicately nurtured, richly clad body, the atrophied spiritual life in\r\nhideous contrast with the physical ease and luxury which were choking\r\nit. The second experience was harder to bear than the first. And just as\r\nin the old days she had shared her bread and cheese with those hungrier\r\nthan herself, and had taken but little thought for those who had bread\r\nand to spare, so now she felt but transient interest in those among her\r\nnew associates who were successfully struggling against the blackmail of\r\nluxury, the leprosy of worldliness, the selfishness that at last coffins\r\nthe soul it clothes. Her heart yearned instead towards the spiritually\r\nstarving, the tempted, the fallen in that great little world, whose\r\nnames are written in the book, not of life, but of Burke--the little\r\nworld which is called "Society."\r\n\r\nShe longed to comfort them, to raise them up, to wipe from their hands\r\nand garments the muddy gold stains of the gutter into which they had\r\nfallen, to smooth away the lines of mean care from their faces. But it\r\nhad been far simpler in her previous life to share her hard-earned bread\r\nwith those who needed it than it was now to share her equally\r\nhard-earned thoughts and slow gleanings of spiritual knowledge, to share\r\nthe things which belonged to her peace.\r\n\r\nRachel had not yet wholly recovered from the overwhelming passion of\r\nlove which, admitted without fear a few years ago, had devastated the\r\nlittle city of her heart, as by fire and sword, involving its hospitable\r\ndwellings, its temples, and its palaces in one common ruin. Out of that\r\ndesolation she was unconsciously rebuilding her city, but it was still\r\nrather gaunt and bare, the trees had not had time to grow in the\r\nstreets, and there was an ugly fortification round it of defaced,\r\nfire-seared stones, which had once stood aloft in minaret and tower, and\r\nwhich now served only as a defence against all corners.\r\n\r\nIf Dick had been in trouble, or rather if she had known the troubles he\r\nhad been through, and which had made his crooked mouth shut so firmly,\r\nRachel might possibly have been able to give him something more valuable\r\nthan the paper money of her friendship. But Dick was obviously\r\nindependent. He could do without her, while Hugh had a claim upon her.\r\nRachel\'s thoughts turned to Hugh again and ever again. Did he see his\r\nconduct as she saw it? A haunting fear was upon her that he did not. And\r\nshe longed with an intensity that outbalanced for the time every other\r\nfeeling that he should confess his sin fully, entirely--see it in all\r\nits ugliness, and gather himself together into a deep repentance before\r\nhe went down into silence, or before he made a fresh start in life. She\r\nwould have given her right hand to achieve that.\r\n\r\nAnd in a lesser degree she was drawn towards Lady Newhaven. Lady\r\nNewhaven was conscious of the tender compassion which Rachel felt for\r\nher, and used it to the uttermost; but unfortunately she mistook it for\r\nadmiration of her character, mixed with sympathetic sorrow for her\r\nbroken heart. If she had seen herself as Rachel saw her, she would have\r\nconceived, not for herself, but for Rachel, some of the aversion which\r\nwas gradually distilling, bitter drop by drop, into her mind for her\r\nhusband. She would not have killed him. She would have thought herself\r\nincapable of an action so criminal, so monstrous. But if part of the\r\nruin in the garden were visibly trembling to its fall, she would not\r\nhave warned him if he had been sitting beneath it, nor would her\r\nconscience have ever reproached her afterwards.\r\n\r\n"I wish Miss Gresley would come and stay here instead of taking you away\r\nfrom me," she said, plaintively, to Rachel one morning, when she made\r\nthe disagreeable discovery that Rachel and Hester were friends. "I don\'t\r\ncare much about her myself, she is so profane and so dreadfully\r\nirreligious. But Edward likes to talk to her. He prefers artificial\r\npeople. I wonder he did not marry her. That old cat, Lady Susan Gresley,\r\nwas always throwing her at his head. I wish she was not always\r\npersuading you to leave me for hours together. I get so frightened when\r\nI am left alone with Edward. I live in perpetual dread that he will say\r\nsomething before the children or the servants. He is quite cruel\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"He will never say anything."\r\n\r\n"You are always so decided, Rachel. You don\'t see possibilities, and you\r\ndon\'t know him as I do. He is capable of anything. I will write a note\r\nnow, and you can take it to Miss Gresley, if you _must_ go there\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n"I wish to go very much."\r\n\r\n"And you will stay another week whether she comes or not?"\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause before Rachel said, cheerfully, "I will stay\r\nanother week, with pleasure. But I am afraid Lord Newhaven will turn\r\nrestive at taking me in to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Oh! he likes you. He always prefers people who are not of his own\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\nRachel laughed. "You flatter me."\r\n\r\n"I never flatter any one. He does like you, and, besides, there are\r\npeople coming next week for the grouse-shooting. I suppose that heavy\r\nyoung Vernon is going to lumber over with you. It\'s not my fault if he\r\nis always running after you. Edward insisted on having him. I don\'t want\r\nhim to dance attendance on _me_."\r\n\r\n"He and I are going to bicycle to Warpington together. The Gresleys are\r\ncousins of his. If it turns very hot we will wait till after sunset to\r\nreturn, if we may."\r\n\r\n"Just as you like," said Lady Newhaven with asperity. "But I advise you\r\nto be careful, my dear Rachel. It never seems to occur to you what\r\non-lookers see at a glance, namely, that Mr. Vernon is in love with\r\nyour fortune."\r\n\r\n"According to public opinion that is a very praiseworthy attachment,"\r\nsaid Rachel, who had had about enough. "I often hear it commended."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven stared. That her conversation could have the effect of a\r\nmustard leaf did not strike her. She saw that Rachel was becoming\r\nrestive, and, of course, the reason was obvious. She was thinking of\r\nmarrying Dick.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," she said, lying down on a low couch near the latticed\r\nwindow, and opening a novel, "you need not be vexed with me for trying\r\nto save you from a mercenary marriage. I only speak because I am fond of\r\nyou. But one marriage is as good as another. I was married for love\r\nmyself; I had not a farthing. And yet you see my marriage has turned out\r\na tragedy--a bitter, bitter tragedy."\r\n\r\n_Tableau_.--A beautiful, sad-faced young married woman in white,\r\nreclining among pale-green cushions near a bowl of pink carnations,\r\nendeavoring to rouse the higher feelings of an inexperienced though not\r\nyouthful spinster in a short bicycling skirt. Decidedly, the picture was\r\nnot flattering to Rachel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n     "On s\'ennuie presque toujours avec ceux qu\'on ennuie."\r\n\r\n\r\nHester did not fail a second time to warn the Gresleys of the arrival of\r\nguests. She mentioned it in time to allow of the making of cakes, and\r\nMr. Gresley graciously signified his intention of returning early from\r\nhis parochial rounds on the afternoon when Dick and Rachel were\r\nexpected, while Mrs. Gresley announced that the occasion was a\r\npropitious one for inviting the Pratts to tea.\r\n\r\n"Miss West will like to meet them," she remarked to Hester, whose jaw\r\ndropped at the name of Pratt. "And it is very likely if they take a\r\nfancy to her they will ask her to stay at the Towers while she is in the\r\nneighborhood. If the captain is at home I will ask him to come too. The\r\nPratts are always so pleasant and hospitable."\r\n\r\nHester was momentarily disconcerted at the magnitude of the social\r\neffort which Rachel\'s coming seemed to entail. But for once she had the\r\npresence of mind not to show her dismay, and she helped Mrs. Gresley to\r\nchange the crewel-work antimacassars, with their washed-out kittens\r\nswinging and playing leap-frog, for the best tussore-silk ones.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was still young when all the preparations had been\r\ncompleted, and Mrs. Gresley went up-stairs to change her gown, while\r\nHester took charge of the children, as Fr\xe4ulein had many days previously\r\narranged to make music with Dr. and Miss Brown on this particular\r\nafternoon. And very good music it was which proceeded out of the open\r\nwindows of the doctor\'s red brick house opposite Abel\'s cottage. Hester\r\ncould just hear it from the bottom of the garden near the church-yard\r\nwall, and there she took the children, and under the sycamore, with a\r\nbench round it, the dolls had a tea-party. Hester had provided herself\r\nwith a lump of sugar and a biscuit, and out of these many dishes were\r\nmade, and were arranged on a clean pocket-handkerchief spread on the\r\ngrass. Regie carried out his directions as butler with solemn\r\nexactitude; and though Mary, who had inherited the paternal sense of\r\nhumor, thought fit to tweak the handkerchief and upset everything, she\r\nfound the witticism so coldly received by "Auntie Hester," although she\r\nexplained that father always did it, that she at once suited herself to\r\nher company, and helped to repair the disaster.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot. The dolls, from the featureless midshipman to the\r\ncolossal professional beauty sitting in her own costly perambulator (a\r\npresent from Mrs. Pratt), felt the heat, and showed it by their moist\r\ncountenances. The only person who was cool was a small, nude, china\r\ninfant in its zinc bath, the property of Stella, whose determination to\r\nreach central facts, and to penetrate to the root of the matter, at\r\npresent took the form of tearing or licking off all that could be torn\r\nor licked from objects of interest. Hester, who had presented her with\r\nthe floating baby in the bath, sometimes wondered, as she watched Stella\r\nconscientiously work through a well-dressed doll down to its stitched\r\nsawdust compartments, what Mr. Gresley would make of his daughter when\r\nshe turned her attention to theology.\r\n\r\nThey were all sitting in a tight circle round the handkerchief, Regie\r\nwatching Hester cutting a new supply of plates out of smooth leaves with\r\nher little gilt scissors, while Mary and Stella tried alternately to\r\nsuck an inaccessible grain of sugar out of the bottom of an acorn cup.\r\n\r\nRachel and Dick had come up on their silent wheels, and were looking at\r\nthem over the wall before Hester was aware of their presence.\r\n\r\n"May we join the tea-party?" asked Rachel, and Hester started\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid the gate is locked," she said. "But perhaps you can climb\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t leave the bicycles outside, though," said Dick, and he took a\r\ngood look at the heavy padlocked gate. Then he slowly lifted it off its\r\nhinges, wheeled in the bicycles, and replaced the gate in position.\r\n\r\nRachel looked at him.\r\n\r\n"Do you always do what you want to do?" she said, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"It saves trouble," he said, "especially as no one can be such a\r\nfirst-class fool as to think a padlock will keep a gate shut. He would\r\nexpect it to be opened."\r\n\r\n"But father said no one could come in there now," explained Regie, who\r\nhad watched, open-mouthed, the upheaval of the gate. "Father said it\r\ncould not be opened any more. He told mother."\r\n\r\n"Did he, my son?" said Dick, and he kissed every one, beginning with\r\nHester and finishing with the dolls. Then they all sat down to the\r\ntea-party, and partook largely of the delicacies, and after tea Dick\r\nsolemnly asked the children if they had seen the flying half-penny he\r\nhad brought back with him from Australia. The children crowded round\r\nhim, and the half-penny was produced and handed round. Each child\r\ntouched it, and found it real. Auntie Hester and Auntie Rachel examined\r\nit. Boulou was requested to smell it. And then it was laid on the grass,\r\nand the pocket-handkerchief which had done duty as a table-cloth was\r\nspread over it.\r\n\r\nThe migrations of the half-penny were so extraordinary that even Rachel\r\nand Hester professed amazement. Once it was found in Rachel\'s hand, into\r\nwhich another large hand had gently shut it. But it was never discovered\r\ntwice in the same place, though all the children rushed religiously to\r\nlook for it where it was last discovered.\r\n\r\nAnother time, after a long search, the doll in the bath was discovered\r\nto be sitting upon it, and once it actually flew down Regie\'s back; and\r\namid the wild excitement of the children its cold descent was described\r\nby Regie in piercing minuteness until the moment when it rolled out over\r\nhis stocking at his knee.\r\n\r\n"Make it fly down my back too, Uncle Dick," shrieked Mary. "Regie, give\r\nit to me."\r\n\r\nBut Regie danced in a circle round Dick, holding aloft the wonderful\r\nhalf-penny.\r\n\r\n"Make it fly down my throat," he cried, too excited to know what he was\r\ndoing, and he put the half-penny in his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Put it out this instant," said Dick, without moving.\r\n\r\nA moment\'s pause followed, in which the blood ebbed away from the hearts\r\nof the two women.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," said Regie; "I\'ve swallowed it." And he began to whimper, and\r\nthen suddenly rolled on the grass screaming.\r\n\r\nDick pounced upon him like a panther, and held him by the feet head\r\ndownward, shaking him violently. The child\'s face was terrible to see.\r\n\r\nHester hid her face in her hands. Rachel rose and stood close to Dick.\r\n\r\n"I think the shaking is rather too much for him," she said, watching the\r\npoor little purple face intently. "I\'m bound to go on," said Dick,\r\nfiercely. "Is it moving, Regie?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s going down," screamed Regie, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"That it\'s not," said Dick, and he shook the child again, and the\r\nhalf-penny flew out upon the grass. "Thank God," said Dick, and he laid\r\nthe gasping child on Hester\'s lap and turned away.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Regie was laughing and talking, and feeling himself\r\na hero. Presently he slipped off Hester\'s knee and ran to Dick, who was\r\nlying on the grass a few paces off, his face hidden in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Make the half-penny fly again, Uncle Dick," cried all the children,\r\npulling at him.\r\n\r\nDick raised an ashen face for a moment and said, hoarsely, "Take them\r\naway."\r\n\r\nHester gathered up the children and took them back to the house through\r\nthe kitchen garden.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say we have arrived," whispered Rachel to her. "I will come on\r\nwith him presently." And she sat down near the prostrate vine-grower.\r\nThe president of the South Australian Vine-Growers\' Association looked\r\nvery large when he was down.\r\n\r\nPresently he sat up. His face was drawn and haggard, but he met Rachel\'s\r\ndog-like glance of silent sympathy with a difficult, crooked smile.\r\n\r\n"He is such a jolly little chap," he said, winking his hawk eyes.\r\n\r\n"It was not your fault."\r\n\r\n"That would not have made it any better for the parents," said Dick. "I\r\nhad time to think of that while I was shaking that little money-box.\r\nBesides, it was my fault, in a way. I\'ll never play with other people\'s\r\nchildren again. They are too brittle. I\'ve had shaves up the Fly River\r\nand in the South Sea Islands, but never anything as bad as this, in this\r\nblooming little Vicarage garden with a church looking over the wall."\r\n\r\nHester was skimming back towards them.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it to James and his wife," she said to Dick. "He has to\r\nspeak at a temperance meeting to-night. I will tell them when the\r\nmeeting is over."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just as well," said Dick, "for I know if James jawed much at me\r\nI should act on the text that it is more blessed to give than to\r\nreceive."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Either way," said Dick. "Tongue or fist. It does not matter which, so\r\nlong as you give more than you get. And the text is quite right. It is\r\nblessed, for I\'ve tried it over and over again, and found it true every\r\ntime. But I don\'t want to try it on James if he\'s anything like what he\r\nwas as a curate."\r\n\r\n"He is not much altered," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"He is the kind of man that would not alter much," said Dick. "I expect\r\nGod Almighty likes him as he is."\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gresley, meanwhile, were receiving Mrs. Pratt and the two\r\nMisses Pratt in the drawing-room. Selina and Ada Pratt were fine,\r\nhandsome young women, with long upper lips, who wore their smart sailor\r\nhats tilted backwards to show their bushy fringes, and whose\r\nmuff-chains, with swinging pendent hearts, silk blouses and sequin belts\r\nand brown boots represented to Mrs. Gresley the highest pinnacle of the\r\nworld of fashion.\r\n\r\nSelina was the most popular, being liable to shrieks of laughter at the\r\nsmallest witticisms, and always ready for that species of amusement\r\ntermed "bally-ragging" or "hay-making." But Ada was the most admired.\r\nShe belonged to that type which in hotel society and country towns is\r\nalways termed "queenly." She "kept the men at a distance." She "never\r\nallowed them to take liberties," etc., etc. She held her chin up and her\r\nelbows out, and was considered by the section of Middleshire society in\r\nwhich she shone to be very distinguished. Mrs. Pratt was often told that\r\nher daughter looked like a duchess; and this facsimile of the\r\naristocracy, or rather of the most distressing traits of its latest\r\nrecruits, had a manner of lolling with crossed legs in the parental\r\ncarriage and pair which was greatly admired. "Looks as if she was born\r\nto it all," Mr. Pratt would say to his wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley was just beginning to fear her other guests were not coming\r\nwhen two tall figures were seen walking across the lawn, with Hester\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley sallied forth to meet them, and blasts of surprised welcome\r\nwere borne into the drawing-room by the summer air.\r\n\r\n"But it was locked. I locked it myself." Inaudible reply.\r\n\r\n"Padlocked. Only opens to the word Moon. Key on my own watch-chain."\r\n\r\nInaudible reply.\r\n\r\n"Hinges! ha! ha! ha! Very good, Dick. Likely story that. I see you\'re\r\nthe same as ever. Travellers\' tales. But we are not so easily taken in,\r\nare we, Hester?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley certainly had the gift of prophecy as far as the Pratts\r\nwere concerned. Mrs. Pratt duly took the expected "fancy" to Rachel, and\r\npressed her to stay at "The Towers" while she was in the neighborhood,\r\nand make further acquaintance with her "young ladies."\r\n\r\n"Ada is very pernickety," she said, smiling towards that individual\r\nconversing with Dick. "She won\'t make friends with everybody, and she\r\ngives it me" (with maternal pride) "when I ask people to stay whom she\r\ndoes not take to. She says there\'s a very poor lot round here, and most\r\nof the young ladies so ill-bred and empty she does not care to make\r\nfriends with them. I don\'t know where she gets all her knowledge from.\r\nI\'m sure it\'s not from her mother. Ada, now you come and talk a little\r\nto Miss West."\r\n\r\nAda rose with the air of one who confers a favor, and Rachel made room\r\nfor her on the sofa, while Mrs. Pratt squeezed herself behind the\r\ntea-table with Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned on bicycling.\r\n\r\n"I bike now and then in the country," said Ada, "but I have not done\r\nmuch lately. We have only just come down from town, and, _of course_, I\r\nnever bike in London."\r\n\r\nRachel had just said that she did.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are nervous about the traffic," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'m not the least afraid of the traffic, but it\'s such bad form to\r\nbike in London."\r\n\r\n"That, of course, depends on how it\'s done," said Rachel; "but I am sure\r\nin your ease you need not be afraid."\r\n\r\nAda glared at Rachel, and did not answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pratts had taken leave she said to her mother:\r\n\r\n"Well, you can have Rachel West if you want to, but if you do I shall go\r\naway. She is only Birmingham, and yet she\'s just as stuck up as she can\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nThe Pratts were "Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Pratt with natural pride, "it\'s well known\r\nno one is good enough for you. But I took to Miss West, and an orphan\r\nand all, with all that money, poor thing!"\r\n\r\n"She has no style," said Selina, "but she has a nice face; and she\'s\r\ncoming to stay with Sibbie Loftus next week, when she leaves Vi\r\nNewhaven. She may be Birmingham, Ada, but she\'s just as thick with\r\ncounty people as we are."\r\n\r\n"I did not rightly make out," said Mrs. Pratt, reflectively, "whether\r\nthat tall gentleman, Mr. Vernon, was after Miss West or Hessie Gresley."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma! You always think some one\'s after somebody else," said Ada,\r\nimpatiently, whose high breeding obliged her to be rather peremptory\r\nwith her simple parent. "Mr. Vernon is a pauper, and so is Hessie. And,\r\nbesides, Hessie is not the kind of girl anybody would want to marry."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not so sure of that," said Selina. "But if she had had any\r\nchances I know she would have told me, because I told her all about\r\nCaptain Cobbett and Mr. Baxter."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n     Le monde est plein de gens qui ne sont pas plus sages.\r\n                                             --LA FONTAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, after the departure of the Pratts, Rachel had hoped for a word with\r\nHester, she was doomed to disappointment. Mr. Gresley took the seat on\r\nthe sofa beside Rachel which Ada Pratt had vacated, and after a few\r\nkindly eulogistic remarks on the Bishop of Southminster and the\r\nresponsibilities of wealth, he turned the conversation into the\r\nwell-worn groove of Warpington.\r\n\r\nRachel proved an attentive listener, and after Mr. Gresley had furnished\r\nher at length with nutritious details respecting parochial work, he went\r\non:\r\n\r\n"I am holding this evening a temperance meeting in the Parish Room. I\r\nwish, Miss West, that I could persuade you to stay for it, and thus\r\nenlist your sympathies in a matter of vital importance."\r\n\r\n"They have been enlisted in it for the last ten years," said Rachel, who\r\nwas not yet accustomed to the invariable assumption on the part of Mr.\r\nGresley that no one took an interest in the most obvious good work until\r\nhe had introduced and championed it. "But," she added, "I will stay with\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\nDick, who was becoming somewhat restive under Mrs. Gresley\'s inquiries\r\nabout the Newhavens, became suddenly interested in the temperance\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen many a good fellow go to the dogs through drink in the\r\nColonies, more\'s the pity," Dick remarked. "I think I\'ll come too,\r\nJames. And if you want a few plain words you call on me."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Mr. Gresley, much gratified. "I always make a point of\r\nencouraging the laity--at least, those among them who are thoroughly\r\ngrounded in Church teaching--to express themselves. Hear both sides,\r\nthat is what I always say. The Bishop constantly enjoins on his clergy\r\nto endeavor to elicit the lay opinion. The chair this evening will be\r\ntaken by Mr. Pratt, a layman."\r\n\r\nThe temperance meeting was to take place at seven o\'clock, and possibly\r\nRachel may have been biassed in favor of that entertainment by the hope\r\nof a quiet half-hour with Hester in her own room. At any rate, she\r\nsecured it.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone Rachel produced Lady Newhaven\'s note.\r\n\r\n"Do come to Westhope," she said. "While you are under this roof it seems\r\nalmost impossible to see you, unless we are close to it," and she\r\ntouched the sloping ceiling with her hand. "And yet I came to Westhope,\r\nand I am going on to Wilderleigh, partly in order to be near you."\r\n\r\nHester shook her head.\r\n\r\n"The book is nearly finished," she said, the low light from the attic\r\nwindow striking sideways on the small face with its tightly compressed\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nA spirit indomitable, immortal, looked for a moment out of Hester\'s gray\r\neyes. The spirit was indeed willing, but the flesh was becoming weaker\r\nday by day.\r\n\r\n"When it is finished," she went on, "I will go anywhere and do anything,\r\nbut stay here I must till it is done. Besides, I am not fit for society\r\nat present. I am covered with blue mould. Do you remember how that\r\nhorrid Lady Carbury used to laugh at the country squires\' daughters for\r\nbeing provincial? I have gone a peg lower than being provincial--I have\r\nbecome parochial."\r\n\r\nA knock came at the door, and Fr\xe4ulein\'s mild, musical face appeared in\r\nthe aperture.\r\n\r\n"I fear to disturb you," she said, "but Regie say he cannot go to sleep\r\ntill he see you."\r\n\r\nHester introduced Fr\xe4ulein to Rachel, and slipped down-stairs to the\r\nnight nursery.\r\n\r\nMary and Stella were already asleep in their high-barred cribs. The\r\nblind was down, and Hester could only just see the white figure of Regie\r\nsitting up in his night-gown. She sat down on the edge of the bed and\r\ntook him in her arms.\r\n\r\n"What is it; my treasure?"\r\n\r\n"Auntie Hester, was I naughty about the flying half-penny?"\r\n\r\n"No, darling. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because mother always says not to put pennies in my mouth, and I never\r\ndid till to-day. And now Mary says I have been very naughty."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter what Mary says," said Hester, with a withering\r\nglance towards the sleeping angel in the next crib, who was only Mary by\r\nday. "But you must never do it again, and you will tell mother all about\r\nit to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Regie; "but, but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Dick did say it was a flying half-penny, and you said so, too,\r\nand that other auntie. And I thought it did not matter putting in flying\r\nhalf-pennies, only common ones."\r\n\r\nHester saw the difficulty in Regie\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"It felt common when it was inside," said Regie, doubtfully, "and yet\r\nyou and Uncle Dick _did_ say it was a flying one."\r\n\r\nRegie\'s large eyes were turned upon her with solemn inquiry in them. It\r\nis crises like this that our first ideals are laid low.\r\n\r\nRegie had always considered Hester as the very soul of honor, that\r\nmysterious honor which he was beginning to dimly apprehend through her\r\nallegiance to it, and which, in his mind, belonged as exclusively to her\r\nas the little bedroom under the roof.\r\n\r\n"Regie," said Hester, tremulously, seeing that she had unwittingly put\r\na stumbling-block before the little white feet she loved, "when we\r\nplayed at the doll\'s tea-party, and you were the butler, I did not mean\r\nyou were _really_ a butler, did I? I knew, and you knew, and we all\r\nknew, that you were Regie all the time."\r\n\r\n"Ye-es."\r\n\r\n"It was a game. And so when Uncle Dick found us playing the tea-party\r\ngame he played another game about the flying half-penny."\r\n\r\n"Then it was a common half-penny, after all," said Regie, with a deep\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a common half-penny, only the game was that it could fly,\r\nlike the other game was that the acorn cups were real teacups. So Uncle\r\nDick and all of us were not saying what was not true. We were all\r\nplaying at a game. Do you understand, my little mouse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Regie, with another voluminous sigh, and Hester realized,\r\nwith thankfulness, that the half-penny and not herself had fallen from\r\nits pedestal. "I see now; but when he said, Hi! Presto! and it flew\r\naway, I thought I saw it flying. Mary said she did. And I suppose the\r\ngate was only a game, too."\r\n\r\nHester felt that the subject would be quite beyond her powers of\r\nexplanation if once the gate were introduced into it.\r\n\r\nShe laid Regie down and covered him.\r\n\r\n"And you will go to sleep now. And I will ask Uncle Dick when next he\r\ncomes to show us how he did the game with the half-penny."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Regie, dejectedly. "I\'d rather know what there is to be\r\nknown. Only I _thought_ it was a flying one. Good-night, Auntie Hester."\r\n\r\nShe stayed beside him a few minutes until his even breathing showed her\r\nhe was asleep, and then slipped back to her own room. The front-door\r\nbell was ringing as she came out of the nursery. The temperance\r\ndeputation from Liverpool had arrived. Mr. Gresley\'s voice of welcome\r\ncould be heard saying that it was only ten minutes to seven.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a few minutes before that hour, Mr. Gresley and his party\r\nentered the Parish Room. It was crammed. The back benches were filled\r\nwith a large contingent of young men, whose half-sheepish, half-sullen\r\nexpression showed that their presence was due to pressure. Why the\r\nparishioners had come in such numbers it would be hard to say. Perhaps\r\neven a temperance meeting was a change in the dreary monotony of rural\r\nlife at Warpington. Many of the faces bore the imprint of this monotony,\r\nRachel thought, as she refused the conspicuous front seat pointed out to\r\nher by Mrs. Gresley, and sat down near the door with Hester.\r\n\r\nDick, who had been finishing his cigarette outside, entered a moment\r\nlater, and stood in the gangway, entirely filling it up, his eye\r\ntravelling over the assembly, and, as Rachel well knew, looking for her.\r\nPresently he caught sight of her, wedged in four or five deep by the\r\nlast arrivals. There was a vacant space between her and the wall, but it\r\nwas apparently inaccessible. Entirely disregarding the anxious\r\nchurch-wardens who were waving him forward, Dick disappeared among the\r\nyoung men at the back, and Rachel thought no more of him until a large\r\nOxford shoe descended quietly out of space upon the empty seat near her,\r\nand Dick, who had persuaded the young men to give him foot-room on their\r\nseats, and had stepped over the high backs of several "school forms,"\r\nsat down beside her.\r\n\r\nIt was neatly done, and Rachel could not help smiling. But the thought\r\ndarted through her mind that Dick was the kind of man who, somehow or\r\nother, would succeed where he meant to succeed, and would marry the\r\nwoman he intended to marry. There was no doubt that she was that woman,\r\nand as he sat tranquilly beside her she wished, with a nervous tremor,\r\nthat his choice had fallen on some one else.\r\n\r\nThe meeting opened with nasal and fervent prayer on the part of a\r\nneighboring Archdeacon. No one could kneel down except the dignitaries\r\non the platform, but every one pretended to do so. Mr. Pratt, who was in\r\nthe chair, then introduced the principal speaker. Mr. Pratt\'s face, very\r\nnarrow at the forehead, became slightly wider at the eyes, widest when\r\nit reached round the corners of the mouth, and finally split into two\r\nlong, parti-colored whiskers. He assumed on these occasions a manner of\r\npontifical solemnity towards his "humble brethren," admirably suited to\r\none who, after wrestling for many years with a patent oil, is conscious\r\nthat he has blossomed out into a "county family."\r\n\r\nThe Warpington parishioners listened to him unmoved.\r\n\r\nThe deputation from Liverpool followed, a thin, ascetic-looking man of\r\nmany bones and little linen, who spoke with the concentrated fury of a\r\nfanatic against alcohol in all its varieties. Dick, who had so far taken\r\nmore interest in Rachel\'s gloves, which she had dropped, and with which\r\nhe was kindly burdening himself, than in the proceedings, drew himself\r\nup and fixed his steel eyes on the speaker.\r\n\r\nA restive movement in the audience followed the speech, which was loudly\r\nclapped by Mr. Gresley and the Pratts.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley then mounted the platform.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley had an enormous advantage as a platform speaker, and as a\r\npreacher in the twin pulpits of church and home, owing to the conviction\r\nthat he had penetrated to the core of any subject under discussion, and\r\ncould pronounce judgment upon it in a conclusive manner. He was wont to\r\napproach every subject by the preliminary statement that he had\r\n"threshed it out." This threshing-out had been so thorough that there\r\nwas hardly a subject even of the knottiest description which he was\r\nunable to dismiss with a few pregnant words. "Evolution! Ha! ha!\r\nDescended from an ape. I don\'t believe that for one." While women\'s\r\nrights received their death-blow from a jocose allusion to the woman\r\nfollowing the plough while the man sat at home and rocked the cradle.\r\n\r\nWith the same noble simplicity he grappled with the difficult and\r\ncomplex subject of temperance, by which he meant total abstinence. He\r\ninformed his hearers, "in the bigoted tones of a married teetotaler,"\r\nthat he had gone to the root of the matter--the roots were apparently on\r\nthe surface--and that it was no use calling black white and white black.\r\nHe for one did not believe in muddling up black and white, as some\r\nlukewarm people advocated, till they were only a dirty gray. No; either\r\ndrink was right or it was wrong. If it was not wrong to get drunk, he\r\ndid not know what was wrong. He was not a man of compromise. Alcohol was\r\na servant of the devil, and to tamper with it was to tamper with the\r\nEvil One himself. Touch not. Taste not. Handle not. He for his part\r\nshould never side with the devil.\r\n\r\nThis lofty utterance having been given time to sink in, Mr. Gresley\r\nlooked round at the sea of stolid, sullen faces, and concluded with\r\nsaying that the chairman would now call upon his cousin, Mr. Vernon, to\r\nspeak to them on the shocking evils he himself had witnessed in\r\nAustralia as the results of drink.\r\n\r\nDick was not troubled by shyness. He extricated himself from his seat\r\nwith the help of the young men, and slowly ascended the platform. He\r\nlooked a size too large for it, and for the other speakers, and his\r\nloose tweed suit and heather stockings were as great a contrast to the\r\ntightly buttoned-up black of the other occupants as were his strong,\r\nkeen face and muscular hands to those of the previous speakers.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a man," said a masculine voice behind Rachel. "He worn\'t reared\r\non ditch-water, you bet."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen," said Dick. "You\'ve only got to\r\nlisten to me for half a minute, and you\'ll find out without my telling\r\nyou that Nature did not cut me out for a speaker. I\'m no talker. I\'m a\r\nworkingman"--an admission which Mr. Pratt would rather have been boiled\r\nin his own oil than have made. "For the last seven years I\'ve done my\r\ntwelve hours a day, and I\'ve come to think more of what a man gets\r\nthrough with his hands than the sentiments which he can wheeze out after\r\na heavy meal. But Mr. Gresley has asked me to tell you what I know about\r\ndrink, as I have seen a good many samples of it in Australia."\r\n\r\nDick then proceeded, with a sublime disregard of grammar, and an\r\nearnestness that increased as he went on, to dilate on the evil effects\r\nof drink as he himself had witnessed them. He described how he had seen\r\nmen who could not get spirits make themselves drunk on "Pain-killer";\r\nhow he had seen strong, young station hands, who had not tasted spirits\r\nfor months, come down from the hills with a hundred pounds in their\r\npockets, and drink themselves into "doddery" old men in a fortnight in\r\nthe nearest township, where they were kept drunk on drugged liquor till\r\nall their hard-earned wages were gone.\r\n\r\nThe whole room listened in dead silence. No feet shuffled. Mr. Gresley\r\nlooked patronizingly at Dick\'s splendid figure and large, outstretched\r\nhand, with the crooked middle finger, which he had cut off by mistake in\r\nthe bush and had stuck on again himself. Then the young Vicar glanced\r\nsmiling at the audience, feeling that he had indeed elicited a "lay\r\nopinion" of the best kind.\r\n\r\n"Now what are the causes of all these dreadful things?" continued Dick.\r\n"I\'m speaking to the men here, not the women. What are the causes of all\r\nthis poverty and vice and scamped workmanship, and weak eyes and shaky\r\nhands, on the top of high wages? I tell you they come from two things,\r\nand one is as bad as the other. One is drinking too much, and the other\r\nis drinking bad liquor. Every man who\'s worth his salt," said Dick,\r\nbalancing his long bent finger on the middle of his other palm, "should\r\nknow when he has had enough. Some can carry more, some less." Mr.\r\nGresley started and signed to Dick, but Dick did not notice. "Bad liquor\r\nis at the root of half the drunkenness I know. I don\'t suppose there are\r\nmany publicans here to-night, for this meeting isn\'t quite in their\r\nline; and if there are, they can\'t have come expecting compliments. But\r\nif you fellows think you get good liquor at the publics round here, I\r\ntell you you are jolly well mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Hear! hear!" shouted several voices.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been in the course of the last week to most of the public-houses\r\nin Southminster and Westhope and Warpington to see what sort of stuff\r\nthey sold, and upon my soul, gentlemen, if I settled in Warpington I\'d,\r\nI\'d"--Dick hesitated for a simile strong enough--"I\'d turn teetotaler\r\nuntil I left it again, rather than swallow the snake poison they serve\r\nout to you."\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh, in the midst of which Mr. Gresley, whose\r\ncomplexion had deepened, sprang to his feet and endeavored to attract\r\nDick\'s attention, but Dick saw nothing but his audience. Mr. Gresley\r\nbegan to speak in his high, "singsong" voice.\r\n\r\n"My young friend," he said, "has mistaken the object of this meeting. In\r\nshort I must--"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said Dick--"not a bit; but if the people have had enough of\r\nme I\'ll take your chair while you have another innings."\r\n\r\nIn a moment the room was in an uproar.\r\n\r\nShouts of "No, no," "Go on," "Let him speak."\r\n\r\nIn the tumult Mr. Gresley\'s voice, instead of being the solo, became but\r\nas one instrument--albeit a trombone--in an orchestra.\r\n\r\n"But I thoroughly agree with the gentlemen who spoke before me," said\r\nDick, when peace was restored. "Total abstinence is a long chalk below\r\ntemperance, but it\'s better than drunkenness any day. And if a man can\'t\r\nget on without three-finger nips, let him take the pledge. There are one\r\nor two here to-night who would be the better for it. But, to my\r\nthinking, total abstinence is like a water mattress. It is good for a\r\nsick man, and it\'s good for a man with a weak will, which is another\r\nkind of illness. But temperance is for those who are in health. There is\r\na text in the Bible about wine making glad the heart of man. That\'s a\r\ngood text, and one to go on. As often as not texts are like bags, and a\r\nman crams all his own rubbish into them, and expects you to take them\r\ntogether. There are some men, who ought to know better, who actually get\r\nout of that text by saying the Bible means unfermented liquor"--Mr.\r\nGresley became purple. "Does it? Then how about the other place where we\r\nhear of new wine bursting old bottles. What makes them burst?\r\nFermentation, of course, as every village idiot knows. No, I take it\r\nwhen the Bible says wine it means wine. Wine\'s fermented liquor, and\r\nwhat\'s unfermented liquor? Nothing but \'pop.\'"\r\n\r\nDick pronounced the last word with profound contempt, which was met with\r\nenthusiastic applause.\r\n\r\n"My last word to you, gentlemen," continued Dick, "is, keep in mind two\r\npoints: first, look out for an honest publican, if there is such an\r\narticle, who will buy only the best liquor from the best sources, and is\r\nnot bound by the breweries to sell any stuff they send along. Join\r\ntogether, and make it hot for a bound publican. Kick him out, even if he\r\nis the Squire\'s butler." Mr. Pratt\'s complexion became apoplectic. "And\r\nthe second point is, Remember some men have heads and some haven\'t. It\r\nis no use for a lame man entering for a hurdle-race. A strong man can\r\ntake his whack--if it\'s with his food--and it will do him good, while a\r\nweak man can\'t hang up his hat alter the first smile."\r\n\r\nA storm of applause followed, which was perhaps all the heartier by\r\nreason of the furious face of Mr. Gresley. Dick was clapped continuously\r\nas he descended the platform and slowly left the room, feeling in his\r\npockets for his tobacco-pouch. A squad of young men creaked out after\r\nhim, and others followed by twos and threes, so that the mellifluous\r\nvoice of Mr. Pratt was comparatively lost, who, disregarding his\r\nposition as chairman, now rose to pour oil--of which, in manner alone,\r\nhe had always a large supply--on the troubled waters. Mr. Pratt had felt\r\na difficulty in interrupting a member of a county family, which with the\r\neye of faith he plainly perceived Dick to be, and at the same time a\r\nguest of "Newhaven\'s." The Pratts experienced in the rare moments of\r\ntheir intercourse with the Newhavens some of that sublime awe, that\r\nsubdued rapture, which others experience in cathedrals. Mr. Pratt had\r\nalso taken a momentary pleasure in the defeat of Mr. Gresley, who did\r\nnot pay him the deference which he considered due to him and his "seat."\r\nMr. Pratt always expected that the Vicar should, by reason of his small\r\nincome, take the position of a sort of upper servant of the Squire; and\r\nhe had seen so many instances of this happy state of things that he was\r\nperpetually nettled by Mr. Gresley\'s "independent" attitude; while Mr.\r\nGresley was equally irritated by "the impatience of clerical control"\r\nand shepherding which Mr. Pratt, his largest and woolliest sheep, too\r\nfrequently evinced.\r\n\r\nAs the chairman benignly expressed his approval of both views, and toned\r\ndown each to meet the other, the attention of the audience wandered to\r\nthe occasional laughs and cheers which came from the school play-ground.\r\nAnd when, a few minutes later, Rachel emerged with the stream, she saw\r\nDick standing under the solitary lamp-post speaking earnestly to a\r\nlittle crowd of youths and men. The laughter had ceased. Their\r\ncrestfallen appearance spoke for itself.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night, lads," said Dick, cordially, raising his cap to them,\r\nand he rejoined Rachel and Hester at the gate.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick and Rachel had departed on their bicycles, and when the\r\ndeputation, after a frugal supper, had retired to rest, and when the\r\ndrawing-room door was shut, then, and not till then, did Mr. Gresley\r\ngive vent to his feelings.\r\n\r\n"And he would not stop," he repeated over and over again almost in\r\nhysterics, when the total-abstinence hose of his wrath had been turned\r\non Dick until every reservoir of abuse was exhausted. "I signed to him;\r\nI spoke to him. You saw me speak to him, Minna, and he would not stop."\r\n\r\nHester experienced that sudden emotion which may result either in tears\r\nor laughter at the cruel anguish brought upon her brother by the\r\nmomentary experience of what he so ruthlessly inflicted.\r\n\r\n"He talked me down," said Mr. Gresley, his voice shaking. "He opposed me\r\nin my own school-room. Of course, I blame myself for asking him to\r\nspeak. I ought to have inquired into his principles more thoroughly, but\r\nhe took me in entirely by saying one thing in this room and the exact\r\nopposite on the platform."\r\n\r\n"I thought his views were the same in both places," said Hester, "and,\r\nat the time, I admired you for asking him to speak, considering he is a\r\nvine-grower."\r\n\r\n"A what?" almost shrieked Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"A vine-grower. Surely you know he has one of the largest vineyards in\r\nSouth Australia?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mr. Gresley was bereft of speech.\r\n\r\n"And you knew this and kept silence," he said at last, while Mrs.\r\nGresley looked reproachfully, but without surprise, at her\r\nsister-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. What was there to speak about? I thought you knew."\r\n\r\n"I never heard it till this instant. That quite accounts for his views.\r\nHe wants to push his own wines. Of course, drunkenness is working for\r\nhis interests. I understand it all now. He has undone the work of years\r\nby that speech for the sake of booking a few orders. It is contemptible.\r\nI trust, Hester, he is not a particular friend of yours, for I shall\r\nfeel it my duty to speak very strongly to him if he comes again."\r\n\r\nBut Dick did not appear again. He was off and away before the terrors of\r\nthe Church could be brought to bear on him.\r\n\r\nBut his memory remained green at Warpington.\r\n\r\n"They do say," said Abel to Hester a few days later, planting his spade\r\non the ground, and slowly scraping off upon it the clay from his nailed\r\nboots, "as that Muster Vernon gave \'em a dusting in the school-yard as\r\nthey won\'t forget in a hurry. He said he could not speak out before the\r\nwomen folk, but he was noways nesh to pick his words onst he was\r\noutside. Barnes said as his tongue \'ud \'ave raised blisters on a hedge\r\nstake. But he had a way with him for all that. There was a deal of talk\r\nabout him at market last Wednesday, and Jones and Peg is just silly to\r\ngo back to Australy with \'im. I ain\'t sure," continued Abel, closing the\r\nconversation by a vigorous thrust of his spade into the earth, "as one\r\nof the things that fetched \'em all most wasn\'t his saying that since\r\nhe\'s been in a hot climate he knowed what it was to be tempted himself\r\nwhen he was a bit down on his luck or a bit up. Pratts would never have\r\nowned to that." The village always spoke of Mr. Pratt in the plural\r\nwithout a prefix. "I\'ve been to a sight of temperance meetings,\r\nbecause," with indulgence, "master likes it, tho\' I always has my glass,\r\nas is natural. But I never heard one of the speakers kind of settle to\r\nit like that. That\'s what the folks say; that for all he was a born\r\ngentleman he spoke to \'em as man to man, not as if we was servants or\r\nchilder."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n     Le bruit est pour le fat.\r\n     La plainte est pour le sot.\r\n     L\'honn\xeate homme tromp\xe9\r\n     S\'en va et ne dit mot.\r\n                       --M. DELANONI\r\n\r\n\r\n"And so you cannot persuade Miss Gresley to come to us next week?" said\r\nLord Newhaven, strolling into the dining-room at Westhope Abbey, where\r\nRachel and Dick were sitting at a little supper-table laid for two in\r\nfront of the high altar. The dining-room had formerly been the chapel,\r\nand the carved stone altar still remained under the east window.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven drew up a chair, and Rachel felt vaguely relieved at his\r\npresence. He had a knack of knowing when to appear and when to efface\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"She can\'t leave her book," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Her first book was very clever," said Lord Newhaven, "and, what was\r\nmore, it was true. I hope for her own sake she will outgrow her love of\r\ntruth, or it will make deadly enemies for her."\r\n\r\n"And good friends," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Possibly," said Lord Newhaven, looking narrowly at her, and almost\r\nobliged to believe that she had spoken without self-consciousness. "But\r\nif she outgrows all her principles, I hope, at any rate, she won\'t\r\noutgrow her sharp tongue. I liked her ever since she first came to this\r\nhouse, ten years ago, with Lady Susan Gresley. I remember saying that\r\nCaptain Pratt; who called while she was here, was a \'bounder.\' And Miss\r\nGresley said she did not think he was quite a bounder, only on the\r\nboundary-line. If you knew Captain Pratt, that describes him exactly."\r\n\r\n"I wish she had not said it," said Rachel, with a sigh. "She makes\r\ntrouble for herself by saying things like that. Is Lady Newhaven in the\r\ndrawing-room?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I heard her singing \'The Lost Chord\' not ten minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"I will go up to her," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"I do believe," said Lord Newhaven, when Rachel had departed, "that she\r\nhas an affection for Miss Gresley."\r\n\r\n"It is not necessary to be a detective in plain clothes to see that,"\r\nsaid Dick.\r\n\r\n"No. It generally needs to be a magnifying-glass to see a woman\'s\r\nfriendship, and then they are only expedients till we arrive, Dick. You\r\nneed not he jealous of Miss Gresley. Miss West will forget all about her\r\nwhen she is Mrs. Vernon."\r\n\r\n"She does not seem very keen about that," said Dick, grimly. "I\'m only\r\nmarking time. I\'m no forwarder than I was."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s your own fault for fixing your affections on a woman who is\r\nnot anxious to marry. She has no objection to you. It is marriage she\r\ndoes not like."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s bosh!" said Dick. "All women wish to be married, and if they\r\ndon\'t they ought to."\r\n\r\nHe felt that an invidious reflection had been east on Rachel.\r\n\r\n"All the same, a man with one eye can see that women with money, or\r\nanything that makes them independent of us, don\'t flatter us by their\r\nalacrity to marry us. They will make fools of themselves for love--none\r\ngreater--and they will marry for love. But their different attitude\r\ntowards us, their natural lords and masters, directly we are no longer\r\nnecessary to them as stepping-stones to a home and a recognized\r\nposition, revolts me. If you had taken my advice at the start, you would\r\nhave made up to one among the mob of women who are dependent on marriage\r\nfor their very existence. If a man goes into that herd he will not be\r\nrefused. And if he is it does not matter. It is the blessed custom of\r\npiling everything on to the eldest son, and leaving the women of the\r\nfamily almost penniless, which provides half of us with wives without\r\nany trouble to ourselves. Whatever we are, they have got to take us. The\r\naverage dancing young woman living in luxury in her father\'s house is\r\nbetween the devil and the deep sea. We are frequently the devil; but it\r\nis not surprising that she can\'t face the alternative--a poverty to\r\nwhich she was not brought up, and in which she has seen her old spinster\r\naunts. But I suppose in your case you really want the money?"\r\n\r\nDick looked rather hard at Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"I should not have said that unless I had known it to be a lie,"\r\ncontinued the latter, "because I dislike being kicked. But, Dick, listen\r\nto me. You have not," with sudden misgiving, "laid any little\r\nmatrimonial project before her this evening, have you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I was not quite such a fool as that."\r\n\r\n"Well! Such things do occur. Moonlight, you know, etc. I was possessed\r\nby a devil once, and proposed by moonlight, as all my wife\'s friends\r\nknow, and probably her maid. But, seriously, Dick, you are not making\r\nprogress, as you say yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well!" rather sullenly.\r\n\r\n"Well, on-lookers see most of the game. Miss West may--I don\'t say she\r\nis--but if things go on as they are for another week she may become\r\nslightly bored. That was why I joined you at supper. She had had, for\r\nthe time, enough."\r\n\r\n"Of me?" said Dick, reddening under his tan.\r\n\r\n"Just so. It is a matter of no importance after marriage, but it should\r\nbe avoided beforehand. Are you really in earnest about this?"\r\n\r\nDick delivered himself slowly and deliberately of certain platitudes.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope I shall hear you say all that again some day in a\r\ncondensed form before a clergyman. In the meanwhile--"\r\n\r\n"In the meanwhile I had better clear out."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I don\'t enjoy saying so in the presence of my own galantine and\r\nmayonnaise, but that is it. Go, and--come back."\r\n\r\n"If you have a Bradshaw," said Dick, "I\'ll look out my train now. I\r\nthink there is an express to London about seven in the morning, if you\r\ncan send me to the station."\r\n\r\n"But the post only comes in at eight."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can send my letters after me."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I can, my diplomatist. But you are not going to leave till\r\nthe post has arrived, when you will receive business letters requiring\r\nyour immediate presence in London. You are not going to let a woman know\r\nthat you leave on her account."\r\n\r\n"You are very sharp, Cackles," said Dick, drearily. "And I\'ll take a\r\nleaf out of your book and lie, if you think it is the right thing. But I\r\nexpect she will know very well that the same business which took me to\r\nthat infernal temperance meeting has taken me to London."\r\n\r\nRachel was vaguely relieved when Dick went off next morning. She was\r\nnot, as a rule, oppressed by the attentions she received from young men,\r\nwhich in due season became "marked," and then resulted in proposals\r\nneatly or clumsily expressed. But she was disturbed when she thought of\r\nDick, and his departure was like the removal of a weight, not a heavy,\r\nbut still a perceptible one. For Rachel was aware that Dick was in\r\ndeadly earnest, and that his love was growing steadily, almost\r\nunconsciously, was accumulating like snow, flake by flake, upon a\r\nmountain-side. Some day, perhaps not for a long time, but some day,\r\nthere would be an avalanche, and, in his own language, she "would be in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n     Si l\'on vous a trahi, ce n\'est pas la trahison qui importe; c\'est\r\n     le pardon qu\'elle a fait na\xeetre dans votre \xe2me. . . . Mais si la\r\n     trahison n\'a pas accru la simplicit\xe9, la confiance plus haute,\r\n     l\'\xe9tendue de l\'amour, on vous aura trahi bien inutilement, et vous\r\n     pouvez vous dire qu\'il n\'est rien arriv\xe9.--MAETERLINCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel and Hester were sitting in the shadow of the church-yard wall\r\nwhere Hester had so unfortunately fallen asleep on a previous occasion.\r\nIt was the first of many clandestine meetings. Mr. and Mrs. Gresley did\r\nnot realize that Hester and Rachel wished to "talk secrets," as they\r\nwould have expressed it, and Rachel\'s arrival was felt by the Gresleys\r\nto be the appropriate moment to momentarily lay aside their daily\r\navocations, and to join Hester and Rachel in the garden for social\r\nintercourse. The Gresleys liked Rachel. Listeners are generally liked.\r\nPerhaps also her gentle, unassuming manner was not an unpleasant change\r\nafter the familiar nonchalance of the Pratts.\r\n\r\nThe two friends bore their fate for a time in inward impatience, and\r\nthen, not without compunction, "practised to deceive." Certain obtuse\r\npersons push others, naturally upright, into eluding and outwitting\r\nthem, just as the really wicked people, who give _viv\xe2 voce_\r\ninvitations, goad us into crevasses of lies, for which, if there is any\r\njustice anywhere, they will have to answer at the last day. Mr. Gresley\r\ngave the last shove to Hester and Rachel by an exhaustive harangue on\r\nwhat he called socialism. Finding they were discussing some phase of it,\r\nhe drew up a chair and informed them that he had "threshed out" the\r\nwhole subject.\r\n\r\n"Socialism," he began, delighted with the polite resignation of his\r\nhearers, which throughout life he mistook for earnest attention.\r\n"Community of goods. People don\'t see that if everything were divided up\r\nto-day, and everybody was given a shilling, by next week the thrifty man\r\nwould have a sovereign, and the spendthrift would be penniless.\r\nCommunity of goods is impossible as long as human nature remains what it\r\nis. But I can\'t knock that into people\'s heads. I spoke of it once to\r\nLord Newhaven, after his speech in the House of Lords. I thought he was\r\nmore educated and a shade less thoughtless than the idle rich usually\r\nare, and that he would see it if it was put plainly before him. But he\r\nonly said my arguments were incontrovertible, and slipped away."\r\n\r\nIt was after this conversation, or rather monologue, that Hester and\r\nRachel arranged to meet by stealth.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting luxuriously in the short grass, with their backs\r\nagainst the church-yard wall, and their hats tilted over their eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wish I had met this Mr. Dick five or six years ago," said Rachel,\r\nwith a sigh.\r\n\r\nHester was the only person who knew about Rachel\'s previous love\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n"Dick always gets what he wants in the long run," said Hester. "I should\r\noffer to marry him at once, if I were you. It will save a lot of\r\ntrouble, and it will come to just the same in the end."\r\n\r\nRachel laughed, but not light-heartedly. Hester had only put into words\r\na latent conviction of her own which troubled her.\r\n\r\n"Dick is the right kind of man to marry," continued Hester,\r\ndispassionately. "What lights he has he lives up to. If that is not high\r\npraise, I don\'t know what is. He is good, but somehow his goodness does\r\nnot offend one. One can condone it. And, if you care for such things, he\r\nhas a thorough-going respect for women, which he carries about with him\r\nin a little patent safe of his own."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to marry a man for his qualities and mental furniture,"\r\nsaid Rachel, wearily. "If I did I would take Mr. Dick."\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence.\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Rachel at last, "that you do not realize how\r\ncommonplace I am. You know those conventional heroines of second-rate\r\nnovels, who love tremendously once, and then, when things go wrong,\r\npromptly turn into marble statues, and go through life with hearts of\r\nstone? Well, my dear, I am just like that. I know it\'s despicable. I\r\nhave straggled against it. It is idiotic to generalize from one personal\r\nexperience. I keep before my mind that other men are _not_ like _him_. I\r\nknow they aren\'t, but yet--somehow I think they are. I am frightened."\r\n\r\nHester turned her wide eyes towards her friend.\r\n\r\n"Do you still consider, after these four years, that _he_ did you an\r\ninjury?"\r\n\r\nRachel looked out upon the mournful landscape. The weariness of\r\nmidsummer was upon it. A heavy hand seemed laid upon the brow of the\r\ndistant hills.\r\n\r\n"I gave him everything I had," she said, slowly, "and he threw it away.\r\nI have nothing left for any one else. Perhaps it is because I am\r\nnaturally economical," she added, smiling faintly, "that it seems now,\r\nlooking back, such a dreadful waste."\r\n\r\n"Only in appearance, not in reality," said Hester. "It looks like a\r\nwaste of life, that mowing down of our best years by a relentless\r\npassion which itself falls dead on the top of them. But it is not so.\r\nEvery year I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the\r\nlove we have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish\r\nprudence which will risk nothing, and which, shirking pain, misses\r\nhappiness as well. No one ever yet was the poorer in the long-run for\r\nhaving once in a lifetime \'let out all the length of all the reins.\'"\r\n\r\n"You mean it did me good," said Rachel, "and that _he_ was a kind of\r\nbenefactor in disguise. I dare say you are right, but you see I don\'t\r\ntake a burning interest in my own character. I don\'t find my mental\r\nstand-point--isn\'t that what Mrs. Loftus calls it?--very engrossing."\r\n\r\n"He was a benefactor, all the same," said Hester, with decision. "I did\r\nnot think so at the time, and if I could have driven over him in an\r\nomnibus I would have done so with pleasure. But I believe that the day\r\nwill come when you will cover that grave with a handsome monument,\r\nerected out of gratitude to him for not marrying you. And now, Rachel,\r\nwill you forgive me beforehand for what I am going to say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Rachel, ruefully. "When you say that I know it is the prelude\r\nto something frightful. You are getting out a dagger, and I shall be its\r\nsheath directly."\r\n\r\n"You are a true prophet, Rachel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, executioner."\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear friend, whom I love best in the world, when that happened\r\nmy heart was wrung for you. I would have given everything I had, life\r\nitself--not that that is saying much--to have saved you from that hour."\r\n\r\n"I know it."\r\n\r\n"But I should have been the real enemy if I had had power to save you,\r\nwhich, thank God! I had not. That hour had to be. It was necessary. You\r\nmay not care about your own character, but I do. There is something\r\nstubborn and inflexible in you--the seamy side of your courage and\r\nsteadfastness--which cannot readily enter into the feelings of others or\r\nput itself in their place. I think it is want of imagination--I mean the\r\npower of seeing things as they are. You are the kind of woman who, if\r\nyou had married comfortably some one you rather liked, might have become\r\nlike Sybell Loftus, who never understands any feeling beyond her own\r\nmicroscopic ones, and who measures love by her own small preference for\r\nDoll. You would have had no more sympathy than she has. People, like\r\nSybell, believe one can only sympathize with what one has experienced.\r\nThat is why they are always saying, \'as a mother,\' or \'as a wife.\' If\r\nthat were true the world would have to get on without sympathy, for no\r\ntwo people have the same experience. Only a shallow nature believes\r\nthat a resemblance in two cups means that they both contain the same\r\nwine. Sybell believes it, and you would have been very much the same,\r\nnot from lack of perception, as in her case, but from want of using your\r\npowers of perception. If you had not undergone an agonized awakening,\r\nall the great realities of life--love, hatred, temptation,\r\nenthusiasm--would have remained for you as they have remained for\r\nSybell, merely pretty words to string on light conversation. That is why\r\nI can\'t bear to hear her speak of them, because every word she says\r\nproves she has not known them. But the sword that pierced your heart\r\nforced an entrance for angels, who had been knocking where there was no\r\ndoor--until then."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"Since when is it that people have turned to you for comfort and\r\nsympathy?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"Rachel, on your oath, did you ever really care for the London poor\r\nuntil you became poor yourself, and lived among them?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"But they were there all the time. You saw them in the streets. It was\r\nnot as if you only heard of them. You saw them. Their agony, their vice,\r\nwas written large on their faces. There was a slum almost at the back of\r\nthat great house in Portman Square where you lived many years in luxury\r\nwith your parents."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t," said Rachel, her lip trembling.\r\n\r\n"I must. You did not care then. If a flagrant case came before you you\r\ngave something like other uncharitable people who hate feeling\r\nuncomfortable. But you care _now_. You seek out those who need you.\r\nAnswer me. Were they cheaply bought or not, that compassion and love for\r\nthe degraded and the suffering which were the outcome of your years of\r\npoverty in Museum Buildings?"\r\n\r\n"They were cheaply bought," said Rachel, with conviction, speaking with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n"Would you have learned them if you had gone on living in Portman\r\nSquare?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hester! would anybody?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they would. But that is not the question. Would _you?_"\r\n\r\n"N--no," said Rachel.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s mind took its staff and travelled slowly, humbly, a few more\r\ndifficult steps up that steep path where "Experience is converted into\r\nthought as a mulberry-leaf is converted into satin."\r\n\r\nAt last she turned her grave eyes upon her friend.\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean," she said; "I have not reached the place yet; but\r\nI can believe that I shall come to it some day, when I shall feel as\r\nthankful for that trouble as I do feel now for having known poverty.\r\nYes, Hester, you are right. I was a hard woman, without imagination. I\r\nhave been taught in the only way I could learn--by experience. I have\r\nbeen very fortunate."\r\n\r\nHester did not answer, but bent down and kissed Rachel\'s hands. It was\r\nas if she had said, "Forgive me for finding fault with one so far above\r\nme." And the action was so understood.\r\n\r\nRachel colored, and they sat for a moment hand close in hand, heart very\r\nnear to heart.\r\n\r\n"How is it you are so sure of these things, Hester?" said Rachel, in a\r\nwhisper. "When you say them I see they are true, and I believe them, but\r\nhow do you _know_ them?"\r\n\r\nA shadow, a very slight one, fell across Hester\'s face. "\'Love knows the\r\nsecret of grief.\' But can Love claim that knowledge if he is asked how\r\nhe came by it by one who should have known?" The question crept in\r\nbetween the friends and moved them apart. Hester\'s voice altered.\r\n\r\n"Minna would say that I picked them up from the conversation of James.\r\nYou know the Pratts are perfectly aware of what I have, of course, tried\r\nto conceal, namely, that the love-scenes in the _Idyll_ were put\r\ntogether from scraps I had collected of James\'s engagement to Minna. And\r\nall the humorous bits are claimed by a colony of cousins in Devonshire\r\nwho say that any one \'who had heard them talk\' could have written the\r\n_Idyll._ And any one who had not heard them apparently. The so-called\r\nprofane passages are all that are left to me as my own."\r\n\r\n"You are profane now," said Rachel, smiling, but secretly wounded by the\r\nflippancy which she had brought upon herself.\r\n\r\nA distant whoop distracted their attention, and they saw Regie galloping\r\ntowards them, imitating a charger, while Fr\xe4ulein and the two little\r\ngirls followed.\r\n\r\nRegie stopped short before Rachel, and looked suspiciously at her.\r\n\r\n"Where is Uncle Dick?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Rachel, reddening, in spite of herself, and her\r\neyes falling guiltily before her questioner.\r\n\r\n"Then he has not come with you?"\r\n\r\nRegie\'s mind was what his father called "sure and steady." Mr. Gresley\r\noften said he preferred a child of that kind to one that was\r\nquick-witted and flashy.\r\n\r\n"No, he has not come with me."\r\n\r\n"Mary!" shrieked Regie, "he has not come."\r\n\r\n"I knew he had not," said Mary. "When I saw he was not there I knew he\r\nwas somewhere else."\r\n\r\nDear little Mary was naturally the Gresleys\' favorite child. However\r\nthoroughly they might divest themselves of parental partiality, they\r\ncould not but observe that she was as sensible as a grown-up person.\r\n\r\n"I thought he might be somewhere near," explained Regie, "in a tree or\r\nsomething," looking up into the little yew. "You can\'t tell with a\r\nconjurer like Uncle Dick, can you, Auntie Hester, whatever Mary may\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\n"Mary is generally wrong," said Hester, "but she is right for once."\r\n\r\nMary, who was early acquiring the comfortable habit of hearing only the\r\nremarks that found an echo in her own breast, heard she was right, and\r\nsaid, shrilly:\r\n\r\n"I told Regie when we was still on the road that Uncle Dick wasn\'t\r\nthere. Mother doesn\'t always go with father, but he said he\'d run and\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"We shall be ver\'r late for luncheon," said Fr\xe4ulein, hastily, blushing\r\ndown to the onyx brooch at her turn-down collar, and drawing Mary away.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he left the half-penny with you," said Regie. "Fr\xe4ulein would\r\nlike to see it."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Fr\xe4ulein, the tears in her eyes. "I do not vish at all. I\r\ncry half the night when I hear of it."\r\n\r\n"I only cry when baby beats me," said Mary, balancing on one leg.\r\n\r\n"I have not got the half-penny," said Rachel, the three elders\r\nstudiously ignoring Mary\'s personal reminiscences.\r\n\r\nThe children were borne away by Fr\xe4ulein, and the friends kissed and\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n"I am coming to Wilderleigh to-morrow," said Rachel. "I shall be much\r\nnearer to you then."\r\n\r\n"It is no good contending against Dick and fate," said Hester, shaking\r\nher finger at her. "You see it is all decided for you. Even the children\r\nhave settled it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n     If a fool be associated with a wise man all his life, he will\r\n     perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of\r\n     soup.--_Buddhist Dhammapada_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think what takes you to Wilderleigh," said Lady Newhaven to\r\nRachel. "I am always bored to death when I go there. Sybell is so\r\nself-centred."\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the reasons why Lady Newhaven and Sybell Loftus did not\r\n"get on" was owing to a certain superficial resemblance between them.\r\n\r\nBoth exacted attention, and if they were in the same room together it\r\nseldom contained enough attention to supply the needs of both. Both were\r\nconscious, like "Celia Chettam," that since the birth of their first\r\nchild their opinions respecting literature, politics, and art had\r\nacquired additional weight and solidity, and that a wife and mother\r\ncould pronounce with decision on important subjects where a spinster\r\nwould do well to hold her peace. Each was fond of saying, "As a married\r\nwoman I think this or that"; yet each was conscious of dislike and\r\nirritation when she heard the other say it. And there is no doubt that\r\nSybell had been too unwell to appear at Lady Newhaven\'s garden-party the\r\nprevious summer, because Lady Newhaven had the week before advanced her\r\ncherished theory of "one life one love," to the delight of Lord Newhaven\r\nand the natural annoyance of Sybell, whose second husband was at that\r\nmoment handing tea and answering "That depends" when appealed to.\r\n\r\n"As if," as Sybell said afterwards to Hester, "a woman can help being\r\nthe ideal of two men."\r\n\r\n"Sybell is such a bore now," continued Lady Newhaven, "that I don\'t\r\nknow what she will be when she is older. I don\'t know why you go to\r\nWilderleigh, of all places."\r\n\r\n"I go because I am asked," said Rachel, "and partly because I shall be\r\nnear Hester Gresley."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Miss Gresley can be very anxious to see you, or she would\r\nhave come here when I invited her. I told several people she was coming,\r\nand that Mr. Carstairs, who thinks so much of himself, came on purpose\r\nto meet her. It is very tiresome of her to behave like that, especially\r\nas she did not say she had any engagement. You make a mistake, Rachel,\r\nin running after people who won\'t take any trouble to come and see you.\r\nIt is a thing I never do myself."\r\n\r\n"She is buried in her book at present."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think what she has to write about. But I suppose she picks up\r\nthings from other people."\r\n\r\n"I think so. She is a close observer."\r\n\r\n"I think you are wrong there, Rachel, for when she was here some years\r\nago she never looked about her at all. And I asked her how she judged of\r\npeople, and she said, \'By appearances.\' Now that was very silly,\r\nbecause, as I explained to her, appearances were most deceptive, and I\r\nhad often thought a person with a cold manner was cold-hearted, and\r\nafterwards found I was quite mistaken."\r\n\r\nRachel did not answer. She wondered in what the gift consisted, which\r\nLady Newhaven and Sybell both possessed, of bringing all conversation to\r\na stand-still.\r\n\r\n"It seems curious," said Lady Newhaven, after a pause, "how the books\r\nare mostly written by the people who know least of life. Now, the\r\n_Sonnets from the Portuguese_. People think so much of them. I was\r\nlooking at them the other day. Why, they are nothing to what I have\r\nfelt. I sometimes think if _I_ wrote a book--I don\'t mean that I have\r\nany special talent--but if I really sat down and wrote a book with all\r\nthe deep side of life in it, and one\'s own religious feelings, and\r\ndescribed love and love\'s tragedy as they really are, what a sensation\r\nit would make! It would take the world by storm."\r\n\r\n"Any book dealing sincerely with one of those subjects could not fail to\r\nbe a great success."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I am not afraid I should fail. I do wish you were not going,\r\nRachel. We have so much in common. And it is such a comfort to be with\r\nsome one who knows what one is going through. I believe you feel the\r\nsuspense, too, for my sake."\r\n\r\n"I do feel it--deeply."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think," said Lady Newhaven, her face aging suddenly under\r\nan emotion so disfiguring that Rachel\'s eyes fell before it--"I am\r\nsometimes almost certain that Edward drew the short lighter. Oh! do you\r\nthink if he did he will really _act up to it_ when the time comes?"\r\n\r\n"If he drew it he will certainly take the consequences."\r\n\r\n"Will he, do you think? I am almost sure he drew it. He is doing so many\r\nlittle things that look as if he knew he were not going to live. I heard\r\nMr. Carstairs ask him to go to Norway with him next spring, and Edward\r\nlaughed, and said he never looked more than a few months ahead."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he may have said that intending you to hear it."\r\n\r\n"But he did not intend me to hear it. I overheard it." Rachel\'s face\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n"You did promise after you told me about the letter that you would never\r\ndo that kind of thing again."\r\n\r\n"Well, Rachel, I have not. I have not even looked at his letters since.\r\nI could not help it that once, because I thought he might have told his\r\nbrother in India. But don\'t you think his saying that to Mr. Carstairs\r\nlooks--"\r\n\r\nRachel shook her head.\r\n\r\n"He is beyond me," she said. "There may be something more behind which\r\nwe don\'t know about."\r\n\r\n"I have a feeling, it has come over me again and again lately, that I\r\nshall be released, and that Hugh and I shall be happy together yet."\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Newhaven turned her face against the high back of her carved\r\noak chair and sobbed hysterically.\r\n\r\n"Could you be happy if you had brought about Lord Newhaven\'s death?"\r\nsaid Rachel.\r\n\r\nHer voice was full of tender pity, not for the crouching unhappiness\r\nbefore her, but for the poor atrophied soul. Could she reach it? She\r\nwould have given everything she possessed at that moment for one second\r\nof Christ\'s power to touch those blind eyes to sight.\r\n\r\n"How can you say such things? I should _not_ have brought it about. I\r\ndid not even know of that dreadful drawing of lots till the thing was\r\ndone. That was all his own doing."\r\n\r\nRachel sighed. The passionate yearning towards her companion shrank back\r\nupon herself.\r\n\r\n"The fault is in me," she said to herself. "If I were purer, humbler,\r\nmore loving, I might have been allowed to help her."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven rose, and held Rachel tightly in her arms.\r\n\r\n"I count the days," she said, hoarsely, shaking from head to foot. "It\r\nis two months and three weeks to-day. November the twenty-ninth. You\r\nwill promise faithfully to come to me and be with me then? You will not\r\ndesert me? Whatever happens you will be sure--to come?"\r\n\r\n"I will come. I promise," said Rachel. And she stooped and kissed the\r\nclosed eyes. She could at least do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     Brother, thy tail hangs down behind.\r\n                             --_Song of the Bandar-log_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel arrived after tea at Wilderleigh, and went straight to her room\r\non a plea of fatigue. It was a momentary cowardice that tempted her to\r\nyield to her fatigue. She felt convinced that she should meet Hugh\r\nScarlett at Wilderleigh. She had no reason for the conviction beyond the\r\nvery inadequate one that she had met him at Sybell\'s London house.\r\nNevertheless, she felt sure that he would be among the guests, and she\r\nlonged for a little breathing-space after parting with Lady Newhaven\r\nbefore she met him. Presently Sybell flew in and embraced her with\r\neffusion.\r\n\r\n"Oh! what you have missed!" she said, breathlessly. "But you do look\r\ntired. You were quite right to lie down before dinner, only you aren\'t\r\nlying down. We have had such a conversation down-stairs. The others are\r\nall out boating with Doll but Mr. Harvey, the great Mr. Harvey, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you do. The author of _Unashamed_."\r\n\r\n"I remember now."\r\n\r\n"Well, he is here, resting after his new book, _Rahab_. And he has been\r\nreading us the opening chapters, just to Miss Barker and me. It is quite\r\nwonderful. So painful, you know. He does not spare the reader anything;\r\nhe thinks it wrong to leave out anything--but so powerful!"\r\n\r\n"Is it the same Miss Barker whom I met at your house in the season, who\r\ndenounced _The Idyll?_"\r\n\r\n"Yes. How she did cut it up! You see, she knows all about East London,\r\nand that sort of thing. I knew you would like to meet her again because\r\nyou are philanthropic, too. She hardly thought she could spare the time\r\nto come, but she thought she would go back fresher if the wail were out\r\nof her ears for a week. The wail! Isn\'t it dreadful? I feel we ought to\r\ndo more than we do, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"We ought, indeed."\r\n\r\n"But then, you see, as a married woman, I can\'t leave my husband and\r\nchild and bury myself in the East End, can I?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not. But surely it is an understood thing that marriage\r\nexempts women from all impersonal duties."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is just it. How well you put it! But others could. I often\r\nwonder why, after writing _The Idyll_, Hester never goes near East\r\nLondon. I should have gone straight off, and have cast in my lot with\r\nthem if I had been in her place."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever find people do what you would have done if you had been in\r\ntheir place?"\r\n\r\n"No, never. They don\'t seem to see it. It\'s a thing I can\'t understand\r\nthe way people don\'t act up to their convictions. And I do know, though\r\nI would not tell Hester so for worlds, that the fact that she goes on\r\nliving comfortably in the country after bringing out that book makes\r\nthoughtful people, not me, of course, but other earnest-minded people,\r\nthink she is a humbug."\r\n\r\n"It would--naturally," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Well, now I am glad you agree with me, for I said something of the same\r\nkind to Mr. Scarlett last night, and he could not see it. He\'s rather\r\nobtuse. I dare say you remember him?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care about him, he is so superficial, and Miss Barker says he\r\nis very lethargic in conversation. I asked him because--don\'t breathe a\r\nword of it--but because, as a married woman, one ought to help others,\r\nand--do you remember how he stood up for Hester that night in London?"\r\n\r\n"For her book, you mean."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s all one. Men are men, my dear. Let me tell you he would\r\nnever have done that if he had not been in love with her."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that men never defend obvious truths unless they are in\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"Now you are pretending to misunderstand me," said Sybell, joyously,\r\nmaking her little squirrel face into a becoming pout. "But it\'s no use\r\ntrying to take me in. And it\'s coming right. He\'s there at this moment!"\r\n\r\n"At the Vicarage?"\r\n\r\n"Where else? I asked him to go. I urged him. I said I felt sure she\r\nexpected him. One must help on these things."\r\n\r\n"But if he is obtuse and lethargic and superficial, is he likely to suit\r\nHester?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, the happiest lot for a woman is marriage. And you and I are\r\nHester\'s friends. So we ought to do all we can for her happiness. That\r\nis why I just mentioned this."\r\n\r\nThe dressing-gong began to boom.\r\n\r\n"I must fly," said Sybell, depositing a butterfly kiss on Rachel\'s\r\nforehead. And she flew.\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what I felt about him," said Rachel to herself. "I don\'t\r\nmuch like hearing him called obtuse and superficial, but I suppose I\r\nshould like still less to hear Sybell praise him. I have never heard her\r\npraise anything but mediocrity yet."\r\n\r\nIf Rachel had been at all introspective she might have found a clew as\r\nto her feeling for Hugh in the unusual care with which she arranged her\r\nhair, and her decision at the last moment to discard the pale-green gown\r\nlying in state on the bed for a white satin one embroidered at long\r\nintervals with rose-colored carnations. The gown was a masterpiece,\r\ndesigned especially for her by a great French milliner. Rachel often\r\nwondered whose eyesight had been strained over those marvellous\r\ncarnations, but to-night she did not give them a thought. She looked\r\nwith grave dissatisfaction at her pale, nondescript face and nondescript\r\nhair and eyes. She did not know that only women with marriageable\r\ndaughters saw her as she saw herself in the glass.\r\n\r\nAs she left her room a door opened at the farther end of the same wing,\r\nand a tall man came out. The middle-class element in her said,\r\n"Superfine." His fastidious taste said, "A plain woman."\r\n\r\nIn another instant they recognized each other.\r\n\r\n"Superfine! What nonsense," she thought, as she met his eager, tremulous\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"A plain woman. Rachel plain!" He had met the welcome in her eyes, and\r\nthere was beauty in every movement, grace in every fold of her white\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nAs they met the gong suddenly boomed out close beneath them, and they\r\ncould only smile at each other as they shook hands. The butler, who was\r\nevidently an artist in his way, proved the gong to the uttermost; and\r\nthey had descended the staircase together, and had crossed the hall\r\nbefore its dying tremors allowed them to speak.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to do so he saw her wince suddenly. She was looking\r\nstraight in front of her at the little crowd in the drawing-room. For an\r\ninstant her face turned from white to gray, and she involuntarily put\r\nout her hand as if to ward off something. Then a lovely color mounted to\r\nher cheek; she drew herself up and entered the room, while Hugh, behind\r\nher, looked fiercely at each man in succession.\r\n\r\nIt is always the unexpected that happens. As Rachel\'s half-absent eyes\r\npassed over the group in the brilliantly lighted drawing-room her heart\r\nreared, without warning, and fell back upon her. She had only just\r\nsufficient presence of mind to prevent her hand pressing itself against\r\nher heart. He was there; he was before her--the man whom she had loved\r\nwith passion for four years, and who had tortured her.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey (the great Mr. Harvey) strode forward, and Rachel found her\r\nhand engulfed in a large soft hand, which seemed to have a poached egg\r\nin the palm.\r\n\r\n"This is a pleasure to which I have long looked forward," murmured the\r\ngreat man, all cuff and solitaire, bending in what he would have termed\r\na "chivalrous manner" over Rachel\'s hand; while Doll, standing near,\r\nwondered drearily "why these writing chaps were always such bounders."\r\n\r\nRachel passed on to greet Miss Barker, standing on the hearthrug, this\r\ntime in magenta velveteen, but presumably still tired of the Bible,\r\nconversing with Rachel\'s former lover, whose eyes were on the floor and\r\nwhose hand gripped the mantel-piece. He had seen her--recognized her.\r\n\r\n"May I introduce Mr. Tristram?" said Sybell to Rachel.\r\n\r\n"We have met before," said Rachel, gently, as he bowed without looking\r\nat her, and she put out her hand.\r\n\r\nHe was obliged to touch it, obliged to meet for one moment the clear,\r\ncalm eyes that had once held boundless love for him, boundless trust in\r\nhim; that had, as he well knew, wept themselves half blind for him.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram was one of the many who judge their actions in the light of\r\nafter-circumstances, and who towards middle-age discover that the world\r\nis a treacherous world. He had not been "in a position to marry" when he\r\nhad fallen in love with Rachel. But he had been as much in love with her\r\nas was consistent with a permanent prudential passion for himself and\r\nhis future--that future which the true artist must ever preserve\r\nuntrammelled. "High hopes faint on a warm hearthstone," etc. He had felt\r\nkeenly breaking with Rachel. Later on, when a tide of wealth flowed up\r\nto the fifth floor of Museum Buildings, he had recognized, for the first\r\ntime, that he had made a great mistake in life. To the smart of baffled\r\nlove had been added acute remorse, not so much for wealth missed as for\r\nhaving inflicted upon himself and upon her a frightful and unnecessary\r\npain. But how could he have foreseen such a thing? How could he tell?\r\nhe had asked himself, in mute stupefaction, when the news reached him.\r\nWhat a cheat life was! What a fickle jade was Fortune!\r\n\r\nSince the memorable day when Rachel had found means to lay the ghost\r\nthat haunted her he had made no sign.\r\n\r\n"I hardly expected you would remember me," he said, catching at his\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\n"I have a good memory," she said, aware that Miss Barker was listening\r\nand that Hugh was bristling at her elbow. "And the little Spanish boy\r\nwhom you were so kind to, and who lodged just below me in Museum\r\nBuildings, has not forgotten either. He still asks after the\r\n\'Cavalier.\'"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tristram is positively blushing at being confronted with his good\r\ndeeds," said Sybell, intervening on discovering that the attention of\r\nsome of her guests had been distracted from herself. "Yes, darling"--to\r\nher husband--"you take in Lady Jane. Mr. Scarlett, will you take in Miss\r\nWest?"\r\n\r\n"I have been calling on your friend, Miss Gresley," said Hugh, after he\r\nhad overcome his momentary irritation at finding Mr. Harvey was on\r\nRachel\'s other side. "I did not know until her brother dined here last\r\nnight that she lived so near."\r\n\r\n"Did not Mrs. Loftus tell you?" said Rachel, with a remembrance of\r\nSybell\'s remarks before dinner.\r\n\r\n"She told me after I had mentioned my wish to go and see her. She even\r\nimplored me so repeatedly to go that I--"\r\n\r\n"Nearly did not go at all."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. But in this case I persevered because I am, or hope I am, a\r\nfriend of hers. But I was not rewarded."\r\n\r\n"I thought you said you had seen her."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I saw her, and I saw that she looked very ill. But I found it\r\nimpossible to have any conversation with her in the presence of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Gresley. Whenever I spoke to her Mr. Gresley answered, and\r\nsometimes Mrs. Gresley also. In fact, Mr. Gresley considered the call as\r\npaid to himself. Mrs. Loftus tells me he is much cleverer than his\r\nsister, but I did not gain that impression. And after I had given tongue\r\nto every platitude I could think of I had to take my leave."\r\n\r\n"Hester ought to have come to the rescue."\r\n\r\n"She did try. She offered to show me the short cut to Wilderleigh across\r\nthe fields. But unluckily--"\r\n\r\n"I can guess what you are going to say."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you can. Mr. Gresley accompanied us, and Miss Gresley turned\r\nback at the first gate."\r\n\r\n"You have my sympathy."\r\n\r\n"I hope I have, for I have had a severe time of it. Mr. Gresley was most\r\ncordial," continued Hugh, ruefully, "and said what a pleasure it was to\r\nhim to meet any one who was interested in intellectual subjects. I\r\nsuppose he was referring to my platitudes. He said living in the country\r\ncut him off almost entirely from the society of his mental equals, so\r\nmuch so that at times he had thoughts of moving to London and making a\r\nlittle centre for intellectual society. According to him the whole\r\nneighborhood was sunk in a state of hopeless apathy, with the exception\r\nof Mrs. Loftus. He said she was the only really clever, cultivated\r\nperson in Middleshire."\r\n\r\n"Did he? How about the Bishop of Southminster?"\r\n\r\n"He did not mention him. My acquaintance with Mrs. Loftus is of the\r\nslightest," added Hugh, interrogatively, looking at his graceful,\r\nanimated hostess.\r\n\r\n"I imagined you knew her fairly well, as you are staying here."\r\n\r\n"No. She asked me rather late in the day. I fancy I was a \'fill up.\' I\r\naccepted in the hope, rather a vague one, that I might meet you here."\r\n\r\nTo Rachel\'s surprise her heart actually paid Hugh the compliment of\r\nbeating a shade faster than its wont. She looked straight in front of\r\nher, and her absent eyes fell on Mr. Tristram sitting opposite, talking\r\nsomewhat sulkily to Miss Barker. Rachel looked steadily at him.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram had been handsome once, and four years had altered him but\r\nlittle in that respect. He had not yet grown stout, but it was evident\r\nthat Nature had that injury in reserve for him. To grow stout is not\r\nnecessarily to look common, but if there is an element of inherent\r\ncommonness in man or woman, a very little additional surface will make\r\nit manifest, as an enlarged photograph magnifies its own defects. The\r\n"little more and how much it is" had come upon the unhappy Tristram,\r\nonce the slimmest of the slim. Life had evidently not gone too well with\r\nhim. Self-pity and the harassed look which comes of annoyance with\r\ntrifles had set their mark upon him. His art had not taken possession of\r\nhim. "High hopes faint on a warm hearthstone." But they sometimes faint\r\nalso in bachelor lodgings. The whole effect of the man was second-rate,\r\nmentally, morally, socially. He seemed exactly on a par with the\r\nsecond-rate friends with whom Sybell loved to surround herself. Hugh and\r\nDick were taking their revenge on the rival who blocked their way.\r\nWhatever their faults might be, they were gentlemen, and Mr. Tristram\r\nwas only "a perfect gentleman." Rachel had not known the difference when\r\nshe was young. She saw it now.\r\n\r\n"I trust, Miss West," said the deep voice of Mr. Harvey, revolving\r\nhimself and his solitaire slowly towards her, that I have your sympathy\r\nin the great cause to which I have dedicated myself, the emancipation of\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"I thought the new woman had effected her own emancipation," said\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey paid no more attention to her remark than any one with a\r\ntheory to propound which must be delivered to the world as a whole.\r\n\r\n"I venture to think," he continued, his heavy, lustreless eyes coming to\r\na stand-still upon her, "that though I accept in all reverence the\r\nposition of woman as the equal of man, as promulgated in _The Princess_,\r\nby our lion-hearted Laureate, nevertheless I advance beyond him in that\r\nrespect. I hold"--in a voice calculated to impress the whole\r\ntable--"that woman is man\'s superior, and that she degrades herself\r\nwhen she endeavors to place herself on an equality with him."\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary silence, like that which travellers tell us\r\nsucceeds the roar of the lion in his primeval forest, silencing even the\r\ntwitter of the birds.\r\n\r\n"How true that is!" said Sybell, awed by the lurid splendor of Mr.\r\nHarvey\'s genius. "Woman is man\'s superior, not his equal. I have felt\r\nthat all my life, but I never quite saw how until this moment. Don\'t you\r\nthink so, too, Miss Barker?"\r\n\r\n"I have never lost an opportunity of asserting it," said the Apostle,\r\nher elbow on Mr. Tristram\'s bread, looking at Mr. Harvey with some\r\nasperity for poaching on her manor.\r\n\r\n"All sensible women have been agreed for years on that point."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n     With aching hands and bleeding feet\r\n       We dig and heap, lay stone on stone,\r\n     We bear the burden and the heat\r\n       Of the long day, and wish \'twere done!\r\n                Not till the hours of light return\r\n                All we have built do we discern.\r\n                                    --MATTHEW ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning. The night was sinking out of the sky to lean\r\nfaint unto death upon the bosom of the earth. The great forms of the\r\ntrees, felt rather than seen, were darkness made visible. Among the\r\nnight of high elms round Warpington a single yellow light burned in an\r\nupper window. It had been burning all night. And now, as the night\r\nwaned, the little light waned with it. At least, it was suddenly blown\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHester came to the window and looked out. There was light, but there was\r\nno dawn as yet. In the gray sky over the gray land the morning-star,\r\nalone and splendid, kept watch in the east.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and leaned her brow against the pane. She did not know that\r\nit was aching. She did not know that she was cold, exhausted; so\r\nexhausted that the morning-star in the outer heaven and the morning-star\r\nin her soul were to her the same. They stooped together, they merged\r\ninto one great light, heralding a perfect day presently to be.\r\n\r\nThe night was over, and that other long night of travail and patience\r\nand faith, and strong rowing in darkness against the stream, was over,\r\ntoo, at last--at last. _The book was finished_.\r\n\r\nThe tears fell slowly from Hester\'s eyes on to her clasped hands, those\r\nblessed tears which no human hand shall ever intervene to wipe away.\r\n\r\nTo some of us Christ comes in the dawn of the spiritual life walking\r\nupon the troubled waves of art. And we recognize Him, and would fain go\r\nto meet Him. But our companions and our own fears dissuade us. They say\r\nit is only a spirit, and that Christ does not walk on water, that the\r\nland whither we are rowing is the place He has Himself appointed for us\r\nto meet Him. So our little faith keeps us in the boat, or fails us in\r\nthe waves of that windswept sea.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Hester as if once, long ago, shrinking and shivering, she\r\nhad stood in despair upon the shore of a great sea, and had heard a\r\nvoice from the other side say, "Come over." She had stopped her ears;\r\nshe had tried not to go. She had shrunk back a hundred times from the\r\ncold touch of the water that each time she essayed let her trembling\r\nfoot through it. And now, after an interminable interval, after she had\r\ntrusted and doubted, had fallen and been sustained, had met the wind and\r\nthe rain, after she had sunk in despair and risen again, she knew not\r\nhow, now at length a great wave--the last--had cast her up half drowned\r\nupon the shore. A miracle had happened. She had reached the other side,\r\nand was lying in a great peace after the storm upon the solemn shore\r\nunder a great white star.\r\n\r\nHester sat motionless. The star paled and paled before the coming of a\r\ngreater than he. Across the pause which God has set \'twixt night and day\r\ncame the first word of the robin. It reached Hester\'s ear as from\r\nanother world--a world that had been left behind. The fragmentary notes\r\nfloated up to her from an immeasurable distance, like scattered bubbles\r\nthrough deep water.\r\n\r\nThe day was coming. God\'s creatures of tree and field and hill took\r\nform. Man\'s creature, the little stout church in their midst, thrust\r\nonce more its plebeian outline against God\'s sky. Dim shapes moved\r\nathwart the vacancy of the meadows. Voices called through the gray.\r\nClose against the eaves a secret was twittered, was passed from beak to\r\nbeak. In the nursery below a little twitter of waking children broke the\r\nstillness of the house.\r\n\r\nBut Hester did not hear it. She had fallen into a deep sleep in the low\r\nwindow-seat, with her pale forehead against the pane; a sleep so deep\r\nthat even the alarum of the baby did not rouse her, nor the entrance of\r\nEmma with the hot water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"James," said Mrs. Gresley, an hour later; as she and her husband\r\nreturned through the white mist from early celebration, "Hester was not\r\nthere. I thought she had promised to come."\r\n\r\n"She had."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she is not well," said Mr. Gresley, closing the church-yard\r\ngate into the garden.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley\'s heart swelled with a sense of injustice. She had often\r\nbeen unwell, often in feeble health before the birth of her children,\r\nbut had she ever pleaded ill-health as an excuse for absenting herself\r\nfrom one of the many services which her husband held to be the\r\nmain-spring of the religious life?\r\n\r\n"I do not think she can be very unwell. She is standing by the magnolia\r\nnow," she said, her lip quivering, and withdrawing her hand from her\r\nhusband\'s arm. She almost hated the slight, graceful figure, which was\r\nnot of her world, which was, as she thought, coming between her and her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"I will speak seriously to her," said Mr. Gresley, dejectedly, who\r\nrecollected that he had "spoken seriously" to Hester many times at his\r\nwife\'s instigation without visible result. And as he went alone to meet\r\nhis sister he prayed earnestly that he might be given the right word to\r\nsay to her.\r\n\r\nA ray of sunlight, faint as an echo, stole through the lingering mist,\r\nparting it on either hand, and fell on Hester.\r\n\r\nHester, standing in a white gown under the veiled trees in a glade of\r\nsilver and trembling opal, which surely mortal foot had never trod,\r\nseemed infinitely removed from him. Dimly he felt that she was at one\r\nwith this mysterious morning world, and that he, the owner, was an alien\r\nand a trespasser in his own garden.\r\n\r\nBut a glimpse of his cucumber-frames in the background reassured him. He\r\nadvanced with a firmer step, as one among allies.\r\n\r\nHester did not hear him.\r\n\r\nShe was gazing with an absorption that shut out all other sights and\r\nsounds at the solitary blossom on the magnolia-tree. Yesterday it had\r\nbeen a bud; but to-day the great almond-white petals which guarded it,\r\noverlapping each other so jealously, had opened wide, and the perfect\r\nflower, keeping nothing back, had laid bare all its pure white soul\r\nbefore its God.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gresley stopped beside her, Hester turned her little pinched,\r\nravaged face towards him and smiled. Something of the passionate\r\nself-surrender of the flower was reflected in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dear Hester," he said, seeing only the wan, drawn face. "Are you ill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--no. I don\'t think so," said Hester, tremulously, recalled suddenly\r\nto herself. She looked hastily about her. The world of dew and silver\r\nhad deserted her, had broken like an iridescent bubble at a touch. The\r\nmagnolia withdrew itself. Hester found herself suddenly transplanted\r\ninto the prose of life, emphasized by a long clerical coat and a bed of\r\nBrussels sprouts.\r\n\r\n"I missed you," said Mr. Gresley, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Where? When?" Hester\'s eyes had lost their fixed look and stared\r\nvacantly at him.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley tried to subdue his rising annoyance.\r\n\r\nHester was acting, pretending not to understand, and he saw through it.\r\n\r\n"At God\'s altar," he said, gravely, the priest getting the upper hand of\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n"Have you not found me there?" said Hester, below her breath, but so low\r\nthat fortunately her brother did not catch the words, and was spared\r\ntheir profanity.\r\n\r\n"I will appeal to her better feelings," he said to himself. "They must\r\nbe there, if I can only touch them."\r\n\r\nHe did not know that in order to touch the better feelings of our\r\nfellow-creatures we must be able to reach up to them, or by reason of\r\nour low stature we may succeed only in appealing to the lowest in them,\r\nin spite of our tiptoe good intentions. Is that why such appeals too\r\noften meet with bitter sarcasm and indignation?\r\n\r\nBut fortunately a robust belief in the assiduities of the devil as the\r\ncause of all failures, and a conviction that who-so opposed Mr. Gresley\r\nopposed the Deity, supported and blindfolded the young Vicar in\r\nemergencies of this kind.\r\n\r\nHe spoke earnestly and at length to his sister. He waved aside her timid\r\nexcuse that she had overslept herself after a sleepless night, and had\r\nfinished dressing but the moment before he found her in the garden. He\r\nentreated her to put aside such insincerity as unworthy of her. He\r\nreminded her of the long months she had spent at Warpington with its\r\npeculiar spiritual opportunities; that he should be to blame if he did\r\nnot press upon her the first importance of the religious life, the\r\never-present love of God, and the means of approaching Him through the\r\nsacraments. He entreated her to join her prayers with his that she might\r\nbe saved from the worship of her own talent, which had shut out the\r\nworship of God, from this dreadful indifference to holy things, and the\r\nimpatience of all religious teaching which he grieved to see in her.\r\n\r\nHe spoke well, the earnest, blind, would-be leader endeavoring to guide\r\nher to the ditch from which he knew not how she had emerged,\r\npassionately distressed at the opposition he met with as he would have\r\ndrawn her lovingly towards it.\r\n\r\nThe tears were in Hester\'s eyes, but the eyes themselves were as flint\r\nseen through water. She stifled many fierce and cruel impulses to speak\r\nas plainly as he did, to tell him that it was not religion that was\r\nabhorent to her, but the form in which he presented it to her, and that\r\nthe sin against the Holy Ghost was disbelief, like his, in the religion\r\nof others. But when have such words availed anything? When have they\r\nbeen believed? Hester had a sharp tongue, and she was slowly learning to\r\nbeware of it as her worst enemy. She laid down many weapons before she\r\ntrusted herself to speak.\r\n\r\n"It is good of you to care what becomes of me," she said, gently, but\r\nher voice was cold. "I am sorry you regard me as you do. But from your\r\npoint of view you were right to speak--as--as you have done. I value the\r\naffection that prompted it."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t meet me fairly," said Mr. Gresley to himself, with sudden\r\nanger at the meanness of such tactics. "They say she is so clever, and\r\nshe can\'t refute a word I say. She appears to yield and then defies me.\r\nShe always puts me off like that."\r\n\r\nThe sun had vanquished the mist, and in the brilliant light the two\r\nfigures moved silently, side by side, back to the house, one with\r\nsomething very like rage in his heart, the rage that in bygone days\r\nfound expression in stake and fagot.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the heaviest trouble which Hester was ever called upon to bear\r\nhad its mysterious beginnings on that morning of opal and gossamer when\r\nthe magnolia opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     Il le fit avec des arguments inconsistants et irr\xe9futables, de ces\r\n     arguments qui fondent devant la raison comme la neige an feu, et\r\n     qu\'on ne peut saisir, des arguments absurdes et triomphants, de\r\n     cur\xe9 de campagne qul d\xe9montre Dieu.--Guy DE MAUPASSANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSybell\'s party broke up on Saturday, with the exception of Rachel and\r\nMr. Tristram, who had been unable to finish by that date a sketch he was\r\nmaking of Sybell. When Doll discovered that his wife had asked that\r\ngentleman to stay over Sunday he entreated Hugh, in moving terms, to do\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n"I am not literary," said Doll, who always thought it necessary to\r\nexplain that he was not what no one thought he was. "I hate all that\r\nsort of thing. Utter rot, I call it. For goodness\' sake, Scarlett, sit\r\ntight. I must be decent to the beast in my own house, and if you go I\r\nshall have to have him alone jawing at me till all hours of the night in\r\nthe smoking-room."\r\n\r\nHugh was easily persuaded, and so it came about that the morning\r\ncongregation at Warpington had the advantage of furtively watching Hugh\r\nand Mr. Tristram as they sat together in the carved Wilderleigh pew,\r\nwith Sybell and Rachel at one end of it, and Doll at the other. No one\r\nlooked at Rachel. Her hat attracted a momentary attention, but her face\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Pratts, on the contrary, well caparisoned by their man\r\nmilliner, well groomed, well curled, were a marked feature of the sparse\r\ncongregation. The spectator of so many points, all made the most of,\r\nunconsciously felt with a sense of oppression that everything that could\r\nbe done had been done. No stone had been left unturned.\r\n\r\nTheir brother, Captain Algernon Pratt, sitting behind them, looked\r\ncritically at them, and owned that they were smart women. But he was not\r\nentirely satisfied with them, as he had been in the old days, before he\r\nwent into the Guards and began the real work of his life, raising\r\nhimself in society.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt was a tall, pale young man--_assez beau\r\ngar\xe7on_--faultlessly dressed, with a quiet acquired manner. He was not\r\nill-looking, the long upper lip concealed by a perfectly kept mustache,\r\nbut the haggard eye and the thin line in the cheek, which did not\r\nsuggest thought and overwork as their cause, made his appearance vaguely\r\nrepellent.\r\n\r\n     "Jesu, lover of my soul,"\r\n\r\nsang the shrill voices of the choir-boys, echoed by Regie and Mary,\r\nstanding together, holding their joint hymnbook exactly equally between\r\nthem, their two small thumbs touching.\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein, on Hester\'s other side, was singing with her whole soul,\r\naccompanied by a pendulous movement of the body:\r\n\r\n     "Cover my defenceless \'ead,\r\n     Wiz ze sadow of Zy wing."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley, after baying like a blood-hound through the opening verses,\r\nascended the pulpit and engaged in prayer. The congregation amened and\r\nsettled itself. Mary leaned her blond head against her mother, Regie\r\nagainst Hester.\r\n\r\nThe supreme moment of the week had come for Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\nHe gave out the text:\r\n\r\n"Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll of us who are Churchmen are aware that the sermon is a period\r\nadmirably suited for quiet reflection.\r\n\r\n"A good woman loves but once," said Mr. Tristram to himself, in an\r\nattitude of attention, his fine eyes fixed decorously on a pillar in\r\nfront of him. Some of us would be as helpless without a Bowdlerized\r\ngenerality or a platitude to sustain our minds as the invalid would be\r\nwithout his peptonized beef-tea.\r\n\r\n"Rachel is a good woman, a saint. Such a woman does not love in a hurry,\r\nbut when she does she loves forever." What was that poem he and she had\r\nso often read together? Tennyson, wasn\'t it? About love not altering\r\n"when it alteration finds," but bears it out even to the crack of doom.\r\nFine poet, Tennyson; he knew the human heart. She had certainly adored\r\nhim four years ago, just in the devoted way in which he needed to be\r\nloved. And how he had worshipped her! Of course he had behaved badly. He\r\nsaw that now. But if he had it was not from want of love. She had been\r\nunable to see that at the time. Good women were narrow, and they were\r\nhard, and they did not understand men. Those were their faults. Had she\r\nlearned better by now? Did she realize that she had far better marry a\r\nman who had loved her for herself, and who still loved her, rather than\r\nsome fortune-hunter, like that weedy fellow Scarlett. (Mr. Tristram\r\ncalled all slender men weedy.) He would frankly own his fault and ask\r\nfor forgiveness. He glanced for a moment at the gentle, familiar face\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n"She will forgive me," he said, reassuring himself, in spite of an\r\ninward qualm of misgiving. "I am glad I arranged to stay on. I will\r\nspeak to her this afternoon. She has become much softened, and we will\r\nbury the past and make a fresh start together."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I will walk up to Beaumere this afternoon," said Doll, stretching a leg\r\noutside the open end of the pew. "I wish Gresley would not call the\r\nDissenters worms. They are some of my best tenants, and they won\'t like\r\nit when they hear of it. And I\'ll go round the young pheasants. (Doll\r\ndid this, or something similar, every Sunday afternoon of his life, but\r\nhe always rehearsed it comfortably in thought on Sunday mornings.) And\r\nif Withers is about I\'ll go out in the boat--the big one, the little one\r\nleaks--and set a trimmer or two for to-morrow. I\'m not sure I\'ll set one\r\nunder the south bank, for there was the devil to pay last time, when\r\nthat beast of an eel got among the roots. I\'ll ask Withers what he\r\nthinks. I wish Gresley would not call the Dissenters blind leaders of\r\nthe blind. It\'s such bad form, and I don\'t suppose the text meant that\r\nto start with, and what\'s the use of ill-feeling in a parish? And I\'ll\r\ntake Scarlett with me. We\'ll slip off after luncheon, and leave that\r\nbounder to bound by himself. And poor old Crack shall come too. Uncle\r\nGeorge always took him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"James is simply surpassing himself," said Mrs. Gresley to herself, her\r\narm round her little daughter. "Worms what a splendid comparison! The\r\nChurchman, the full-grown man after the stature of Christ, and the\r\nDissenter invertebrate (I think dear James means inebriate), like a worm\r\ncleaving to the earth. But possibly God in His mercy may let them slip\r\nin by a back-door to heaven! How like him to say that, so generous, so\r\nwide-minded, taking the hopeful view of everything! How noble he looks!\r\nThese are days in which we should stick to our colors. I wonder how he\r\ncan think of such beautiful things. For my part, I think the duty of the\r\ntrue priest is not to grovel to the crowd and call wrong right and right\r\nwrong for the sake of a fleeting popularity. How striking! What a lesson\r\nto the Bishop, if he were only here. He is so lax about Dissent, as if\r\nright and wrong were mere matters of opinion! What a gift he has! I know\r\nhe will eat nothing for luncheon. If only we were somewhere else where\r\nthe best joints were a little cheaper, and his talents more\r\nappreciated." And Mrs. Gresley closed her eyes and prayed earnestly, a\r\ntear sliding down her cheek on to Mary\'s floss-silk mane, that she might\r\nbecome less unworthy to be the wife of one so far above her, that the\r\nchildren might all grow up like him, and that she might be given\r\npatience to bear with Hester even when she vexed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt\'s critical eye travelled over the congregation. It\r\nabsolutely ignored Mrs. Gresley and Fr\xe4ulein. It lingered momentarily on\r\nHester. He knew what he called "breeding" when he saw it, and he was\r\naware that Hester possessed it, though his sisters would have laughed at\r\nthe idea. He had seen many well-bred women on social pinnacles look like\r\nthat, whose houses were at present barred against him. The Pratt sisters\r\nwere fixed into their smartness as some faces are fixed into a grin. It\r\nwas not spontaneous, fugitive, evanescent as a smile, gracefully worn,\r\nor lightly laid aside, as in Hester\'s case. He had known Hester slightly\r\nin London for several years. He had seen her on terms of intimacy, such\r\nas she never showed to his sisters, with inaccessible men and women with\r\nwhom he had achieved a bare acquaintance, but whom, in spite of many\r\ncarefully concealed advances, he had found it impossible to know better.\r\nCaptain Pratt had reached that stage in his profession of raising\r\nhimself when he had become a social barometer. He was excessively\r\ncareful whom he knew, what women he danced with, what houses he visited;\r\nand any of his acquaintances who cared to ascertain their own social\r\nstatus to a hair\'s-breadth had only to apply to it the touchstone of\r\nCaptain Pratt\'s manner towards them.\r\n\r\nHester, who grasped many facts of that kind, was always amused by the\r\ncold consideration with which he treated her on his rare visits to the\r\nparental Towers; and which his sisters could only construe as a sign\r\nthat "Algy was gone on Hessie."\r\n\r\n"But he will never marry her," they told each other. "Algy looks\r\nhigher."\r\n\r\nIt was true. If Hester had been Lady Hester, it is possible that the\r\nsurname of Pratt, if frequently refused by stouter women, might\r\neventually have been offered to her. But Captain Pratt was determined\r\nto marry rank, and nothing short of a Lady Something was of any use to\r\nhim. An Honorable was better than nothing, but it did not count for much\r\nwith him. It had a way of absenting itself when wanted. No one was\r\nannounced as an Honorable. It did not even appear on cards. It might he\r\noverlooked. Rank, to be of any practical value, must be apparent,\r\nobvious. Lady Georgiana Pratt, Lady Evelina Pratt! Any name would do\r\nwith that prefix. His eye travelled as far as Sybell and stopped again.\r\nShe was "the right sort" herself, and she dressed in the right way. Why\r\ncould not Ada and Selina imitate her? But he had never forgiven her the\r\nfact that he had met "a crew of cads" at her house, whom he had been\r\nobliged to cut afterwards in the Row. No, Sybell would not have done for\r\nhim. She surrounded herself with vulgar people.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt was far too well-mannered to be guilty of staring, except\r\nat pretty maid-servants or shop-girls, and his eye was moved on by the\r\nrigid police of etiquette which ruled his every movement. It paused\r\nmomentarily on Rachel. He knew about her, as did every bachelor in\r\nLondon. A colossal heiress. She was neither plain nor handsome. She had\r\na good figure, but not good enough to counterbalance her nondescript\r\nface. She had not the air of distinction which he was so quick to detect\r\nand appraise. She was a social nonentity. He did not care to look at her\r\na second time. "I would not marry her with twice her fortune," he said\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRegie\'s hand had stolen into Hester\'s. His even breathing, felt rather\r\nthan heard, as he dropped asleep against her shoulder, surrounded Hester\r\nwith the atmosphere of peace and comfort which his father had broken\r\nearlier in the day. Regie often brought back to her what his father\r\nwrested from her.\r\n\r\nShe listened to the sermon as from a warm nest safely raised above the\r\nquaggy ground of personal feeling.\r\n\r\n"Dear James! How good he is! how much in earnest! But worms don\'t go in\r\nat back-doors. Why are not clergymen taught a few elementary rules of\r\ncomposition before they are ordained? But perhaps no one will notice it\r\nexcept myself. James is certainly a saint. He has the courage of his\r\nopinions. I believe he loves God and the Church with his whole heart,\r\nand would go to the stake for them, or send me there if he thought it\r\nwas for the good of my soul. Why has he no power? Why is he so much\r\ndisliked in the parish and neighborhood? I am sure it is not because he\r\nhas small abilities, and makes puns, and says cut-and-dried things. How\r\nmany excellent clergymen who do the same are beloved? Is it because he\r\ndeals with every one as he deals with me? What dreadful things he thinks\r\nof me. I don\'t wonder he is anxious about me. What unworthy motives of\r\nwilful blindness and arrogance he is attributing to the Nonconformists!\r\nOh, James, James! will you never see that it is disbelief in the\r\nsincerity of the religion of others, because it is not in the same\r\nnarrow form as your own, which makes all your zeal and earnestness of\r\nnone effect! You think the opposition you meet with everywhere is the\r\nopposition of evil to good, of indifference to piety. When will you\r\nlearn that it is the good in your hearers which opposes you, the love of\r\nGod in them which is offended by your representation of Him?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHugh\'s eyes were fixed on the same pillar as Mr. Tristram\'s, but if he\r\nhad been aware of that fact he would have chosen another pillar. His\r\nthin, handsome face was beginning to show the marks of mental strain.\r\nHis eyes had the set, impassive look of one who, hedged in on both\r\nsides, sees a sharp turn ahead of him on an unknown road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Don\'t you hear me calling to you? Don\'t you\r\nhear me telling you that I can\'t live without you? The hymn was\r\nright--\'Other refuge have I none, Hangs my helpless soul on Thee\'--only\r\nit was written of you, not of that far, far away God who does not care.\r\nOnly care for me. Only love me. Only give me those cool hands that I may\r\nlean my forehead against them. No help can come to me except through\r\nyou. Stoop down to me and raise me up, for I love you."\r\n\r\nThe sun went in suddenly, and a cold shadow fell on the pillar and on\r\nHugh\'s heart.\r\n\r\nLove and marriage were not for him. That far-away God, that Judge in the\r\nblack cap, had pronounced sentence against him, had doomed that he\r\nshould die in his sins. When he had sat in his own village church only\r\nlast Sunday between his mother and sister, he had seen the empty place\r\non his chancel wall where the tablet to his memory would be put up. When\r\nhe walked through the church-yard, his mother leaning on his arm, his\r\nstep regulated by her feeble one, he had seen the vacant space by his\r\nfather\'s grave already filled by the mound of raw earth which would\r\nshortly cover him. His heart had ached for his mother, for the gentle,\r\nfeeble-minded sister, who had transferred the interest in life, which\r\nkeeps body and soul together, from her colorless existence to that of\r\nher brother. Hughie was the romance of her gray life: what Hughie said,\r\nwhat Hughie thought, Hughie\'s wife--oh, jealous thought, only to be met\r\nby prayer! But later on--joy of joys--Hughie\'s children! He realized it,\r\nnow and then, vaguely, momentarily, but never as fully as last Sunday.\r\nHe shrank from the remembrance, and his mind wandered anew in the\r\nlabyrinth of broken, twisted thought, from which he could find no way\r\nout.\r\n\r\n_There must be some way out!_ He had stumbled callously through one day\r\nafter another of these weeks in which he had not seen Rachel towards his\r\nnext meeting with her, as a half-blind man stumbles towards the light.\r\nBut the presence of Rachel afforded no clew to the labyrinth. What vain\r\nhope was this that he had cherished unconsciously that she could help\r\nhim. There was no help for him. There was no way out. He was in a trap.\r\nHe must die, and soon, by his own hand. Incredible, preposterous fate!\r\nHe shuddered, and looked around him involuntarily.\r\n\r\nHis glance, reverent, full of timid longing, fell on Rachel, and his\r\nheart cried aloud, suddenly, "If she loves me, I shall not be able to\r\nleave her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n     Look in my face! my name is Might-have-been;\r\n     I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell.\r\n                              --DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon. Mr. Tristram leaned on the stone balustrade\r\nthat bounded the long terrace at Wilderleigh. He was watching two\r\ndistant figures, followed by a black dot, stroll away across the park.\r\nOne of them seemed to drag himself unwillingly. Mr. Tristram\r\ncongratulated himself on the acumen which had led him to keep himself\r\nconcealed until Doll and Hugh had started for Beaumere.\r\n\r\nSybell had announced at luncheon, in the tone of one who observes a\r\nreligious rite, that she should rest till four o\'clock, and would be\r\nready to sit for the portrait of her upper lip at that hour.\r\n\r\nIt was only half-past two now. Mr. Tristram had planted himself exactly\r\nin front of Rachel\'s windows, with his back to the house. "She will keep\r\nme waiting, but she will come out in time," he said to himself, nervous\r\nand self-confident by turns, resting his head rather gracefully on his\r\nhand. His knowledge of womankind supported him like a life-belt, but it\r\nhas been said that life-belts occasionally support their wearers\r\nupsidedown. Theories have been known to exhibit the same spiteful\r\ntendency towards those who place their trust in them.\r\n\r\n"Of course, she has got to show me that she is offended with me," he\r\nreflected, gazing steadily at the Welsh hills. "She would not have come\r\nout if I had asked her, but she will certainly come as I did not. I will\r\ngive her half an hour."\r\n\r\nRachel, meanwhile, was looking fixedly at Mr. Tristram from her bedroom\r\nwindow with that dispassionate scrutiny to avoid which the vainest would\r\ndo well to take refuge in noisome caves.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," she said to herself, "whether Hester always saw him as I see\r\nhim now. I believe she did."\r\n\r\nRachel put on her hat and took up her gloves. "If this is really I, and\r\nthat is really he, I had better go down and get it over," she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram had given her half an hour. She appeared in the low stone\r\ndoorway before the first five minutes of the allotted time had elapsed,\r\nand he gave a genuine start of surprise as he heard her step on the\r\ngravel. His respect for her fell somewhat at this alacrity.\r\n\r\n"I have been waiting in the hope of seeing you," he said, after a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation. "I am anxious to have a serious conversation with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," she said.\r\n\r\nThey walked along the terrace, and presently found themselves in the\r\nlittle coppice adjoining it. They sat down together on a wooden seat\r\nround an old cedar, in the heart of the golden afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt was an afternoon the secret of which Autumn and Spring will never\r\ntell to Winter and Summer, when the wildest dreams of love might come\r\ntrue, when even the dead might come down and put warm lips to ours, and\r\nwe should feel no surprise.\r\n\r\nA kingfisher flashed across the open on his way back to the brook near\r\nat hand, fleeing from the still splendor of the sun-fired woods, where\r\nhe was but a courtier, to the little winding world of gray stones and\r\nwater, where he was a jewelled king.\r\n\r\nWhen the kingfisher had left them _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_, Mr. Tristram found\r\nhimself extremely awkwardly placed on the green bench. He felt that he\r\nhad not sufficiently considered beforehand the peculiar difficulties\r\nwhich, in the language of the law, "had been imported into his case."\r\n\r\nRachel sat beside him in silence. If it could be chronicled that\r\nsympathetic sorrow for her companion\'s predicament was the principal\r\nfeeling in her mind, she would have been an angel.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram halted long between two opinions. At last he said,\r\nbrokenly:\r\n\r\n"Can you forgive me?"\r\n\r\nWhat woman, even with her white hair, even after a lifetime spent out of\r\near-shot, ever forgets the tone her lover\'s voice takes when he is in\r\ntrouble? Rachel softened instantly.\r\n\r\n"I forgave you long ago," she said, gently.\r\n\r\nSomething indefinable in the clear, full gaze that met his daunted him.\r\nHe stared apprehensively at her. It seemed to him as if he were standing\r\nin cold and darkness looking in through the windows of her untroubled\r\neyes at the warm, sunlit home which had once been his, when it had been\r\nexceeding well with him, but of which he had lost the key.\r\n\r\nA single yellow leaf, crisped and hollowed to a fairy boat, came sailing\r\non an imperceptible current of air to rest on Rachel\'s knee.\r\n\r\n"I was angry at first," she said, her voice falling across the silence\r\nlike another leaf. "And then, after a time, I forgave you. And later\r\nstill, much later, I found out that you had never injured me--that I had\r\nnothing to forgive."\r\n\r\nHe did not understand, and as he did not understand he explained\r\nvolubly--for here he felt he was on sure ground--that, on the contrary,\r\nshe had much to forgive, that he had acted like an infernal blackguard,\r\nthat men were coarse brutes, not fit to kiss a good woman\'s\r\nshoe-latchet, etc., etc. He identified his conduct with that of the\r\nwhole sex, without alluding to it as that of the individual Tristram. He\r\nmade it clear that he did not claim to have behaved better than most\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nRachel listened attentively. "And I actually loved him," she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"But the divine quality of woman is her power of forgiving. Her love\r\nraises a man, transfigures him, ennobles his whole life," etc., etc.\r\n\r\n"My love did not appear to have quite that effect upon you at the time,"\r\nsaid Rachel, regretting the words the moment they were spoken.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram felt relieved. Here at last; was the reproach he had been\r\nexpecting.\r\n\r\nHe assured her she did well to be angry. He accused himself once more.\r\nHe denounced the accursed morals of the day, above which he ought to\r\nhave risen, the morals, if she did but know it, of all unmarried men.\r\n\r\n"That is a hit at Mr. Scarlett," she said, scornfully, to herself, and\r\nthen her cheek blanched as she remembered that Hugh was not exempt,\r\nafter all. She became suddenly tired, impatient; but she waited quietly\r\nfor the inevitable proposal.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram, who had the gift of emphatic and facile utterance, which\r\nthe conventional consider to be the sign-manual of genius, had become so\r\nentangled in the morals of the age that it took him some time to\r\nextricate himself from the subject before he could pass on to plead, in\r\nan impassioned manner, the cause of the man, unworthy though he might\r\nbe, who had long loved her, loved her now, and would always love her, in\r\nthis world and the next.\r\n\r\nIt was the longest proposal Rachel had ever had, and she had had many.\r\nBut if the proposal was long, the refusal was longer. Rachel, who had a\r\ngood memory, led up to it by opining that the artistic life made great\r\ndemands, that the true artist must live entirely for his art, that\r\ndomestic life might prove a hinderance. She had read somewhere that high\r\nhopes fainted on warm hearthstones. Mr. Tristram demolished these\r\nobjections as ruthlessly as ducks peck their own ducklings if they have\r\nnot seen them for a day or two.\r\n\r\nEven when she was forced to become more explicit, it was at first\r\nimpossible to Mr. Tristram to believe she would finally reject him. But\r\nthe knowledge, deep-rooted as a forest oak, that she had loved him\r\ndevotedly could not at last prevail against the odious conviction that\r\nshe was determined not to marry him.\r\n\r\n"Then, in that case, you never loved me?"\r\n\r\n"I do not love you now."\r\n\r\n"You are determined not to marry?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I hope to do so."\r\n\r\nRachel\'s words took her by surprise. She had no idea till that moment\r\nthat she hoped anything of the kind.\r\n\r\n"You prefer some one else. That is the real truth."\r\n\r\n"I prefer several others."\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram looked suspiciously at her. Her answers did not tally with\r\nhis previous knowledge of her. Perhaps he forgot that he had set his\r\ndocile pupil rather a long holiday task to learn in his absence, and she\r\nhad learned it.\r\n\r\n"You think you would be happier with some fortune-hunter of an\r\naristocrat than with a plain man of your own class, who, whatever his\r\nfaults may be, loves you for yourself."\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the word aristocrat as applied to a gentleman is as\r\noffensive as that of flunkey applied to a footman?\r\n\r\nRachel drew herself up imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n"That depends upon the fortune-hunter," she said, with that touch of\r\n_hauteur_ which, when the vulgar have at last drawn it upon themselves\r\nby the insolence which is the under side of their courtesy, always has\r\nthe same effect on them as a red rag on a bull.\r\n\r\nIn their own language they invariably "stand up to it." Mr. Tristram\r\nstood up physically and mentally. He also raised his voice, causing two\r\nrabbits to hurry back into their holes.\r\n\r\nWomen, he said, were incalculable. He would never believe in one again.\r\nHis disbelief in woman rose even to the rookery in the high elms close\r\nat hand. That she, Rachel, whom he had always regarded as the first\r\namong women, should be dazzled by the empty glamour of rank, now that\r\nher fortune put such marriages within her reach, was incredible. He\r\nshould have repudiated such an idea with scorn, if he had not heard it\r\nfrom her own lips. Well, he would leave her to the life she had chosen.\r\nIt only remained for him to thank her for stripping his last illusions\r\nfrom him and to bid her good-bye.\r\n\r\n"We shall never meet again," he said, holding her hand, and looking very\r\nmuch the same without his illusions as he did when he had them on. He\r\nhad read somewhere a little poem about "A Woman\'s No," which at the last\r\nmoment meant "Yes." And then there was another which chronicled how,\r\nafter several stanzas of upbraiding, "we rushed into each other\'s arms."\r\nBoth recurred to him now. He had often thought how true they were.\r\n\r\n"I do not think we shall meet again," said Rachel, who apparently had an\r\nunpoetic nature; "but I am glad for my own sake that we have met this\r\nonce, and have had this conversation. I think we owed it to each other\r\nand to our--former attachment."\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye." He still held her hand. If she was not careful she\r\nwould lose him.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"You understand it is for always?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\nHe became suddenly livid. He loved her more than ever. Would she really\r\nlet him go?\r\n\r\n"I am not the kind of man to be whistled back," he said, fiercely. It\r\nwas an appeal and a defiance, for he was just the kind of man, and they\r\nboth knew it.\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"That is your last word?"\r\n\r\n"My last word."\r\n\r\nHe dropped her hand and half turned to go.\r\n\r\nShe made no sign.\r\n\r\nThen he strode violently out of the wood without looking behind him. At\r\nthe little gate he stopped a moment, listening intently. No recalling\r\nvoice reached him. Poets did not know what they were talking about. With\r\na trembling hand he slammed the gate and departed.\r\n\r\nRachel remained a long time sitting on the wooden bench, so long that\r\nthe stooping sun found out the solemn, outstretched arms of the cedar,\r\nand touched them till they gleamed green as a beetle\'s wing. Each little\r\ntwig and twiglet was made manifest, raw gold against the twilight that\r\nlurked beneath the heavy boughs.\r\n\r\nShe sat so still that a squirrel came tiptoeing across the moss, and\r\nstruck tail momentarily to observe her. He looked critically at her,\r\nfirst with one round eye, and then, turning his sleek head, with the\r\nother, and decided that she was harmless.\r\n\r\nPresently a robin dropped down close to her, flashing up his gray under\r\nwing as he alighted, and then flew up into the cedar, and from its\r\nsun-stirred depths said his say.\r\n\r\nThe robin never forgets. In the autumn afternoons, when the shadows are\r\nlengthening, he sings sadness into your heart. If you are joyful shut\r\nyour ears against him, for you may keep peace, but never joy, while he\r\nis singing. He knows all about it, "love\'s labor lost," the gray face of\r\nyoung Love dead, the hard-wrought grave in the live rock where he is\r\nburied. And he tells of it again and again and again, as if Love\'s sharp\r\nsword had indeed reddened his little breast, until the heart aches to\r\nhear him. But he tells also that consolation is folded not in\r\nforgetfulness, but in remembrance. That is why he sings in the silence\r\nof the autumn dawn, before Memory closes her eyes, and again near\r\nsunset, when Memory wakes.\r\n\r\nStill Rachel sat motionless.\r\n\r\nShe had labored with dumb unreasoning passion to forget, as a man works\r\nhis hand to the bone night after night, week after week, month after\r\nmonth, to file through the bars of his prison. She found at last that\r\nforgetfulness came not of prayer and fasting; that it was not in her to\r\nforget. The past had seemed to stretch its cruel, desecrating hand over\r\nall the future, cutting her off from the possibility of love and\r\nmarriage, and from the children whom in dreams she held in her arms. As\r\nshe had said to Hester, she thought she "had nothing left to give."\r\n\r\nBut now the dead past had risen from its grave in her meeting with her\r\nformer lover, and in a moment, in two short days and wakeful nights, the\r\npast relinquished its false claim upon her life. She saw that it was\r\nfalse, that she had been frightened where no fear was, that her\r\ndeliverance lay in remembrance itself, not in the handcuffs with which\r\nuntil now she had bound her deliverer.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram had come back into her life, and with his own hands had\r\ndestroyed the overthrown image of himself, which lay like a barrier\r\nacross her heart. He had replaced it by an accurate presentment of\r\nhimself as he really was.\r\n\r\n"Only that which is replaced is destroyed," and it is often our real\r\nself in its native rags, and not, as we jealously imagine, another king\r\nin richer purple who has replaced us in the throne-room of the heart\r\nthat loved us. To the end of life Rachel never forgot Mr. Tristram, any\r\nmore than the amber forgets its fly. But she was vaguely conscious as he\r\nleft her that he had set her free. She listened to his retreating step\r\nhardly daring to breathe. It was too good to be true. At last there was\r\ndead silence. No echo of a footfall. Quite gone. He had departed not\r\nonly out of her presence, but out of her life.\r\n\r\nShe breathed again. A tremor, like that which shakes the first green\r\nleaf against the March sky, stole across her crushed heart, empty at\r\nlast, empty at last. She raised her hand timidly in the sunshine. She\r\nwas free. She looked round dazzled, bewildered. The little world of\r\nsunshine and the turquoises of sky strewn among the golden net-work of\r\nthe trees smiled at her, as one who brings good tidings.\r\n\r\nA certain familiar hold on life and nature, so old that it was almost\r\nnew, which she had forgotten, but which her former self used to feel,\r\ncame back suddenly upon her, like a lost friend from over-seas. Scales\r\nseemed to fall from her eyes. The light was too much for her. She had\r\nforgotten how beautiful the world was. Everything was possible.\r\n\r\nSome, in the night of their desolation, can take comfort when they see\r\nthe morning-star shuddering white in the east, and can say, "Courage,\r\nthe day is at hand."\r\n\r\nBut others never realize that their night is over till the sun is up.\r\nRachel had sat in a long stupor. The message writ large for her comfort\r\nin the stars that the night was surely waning had not reached her,\r\nbowed, as she thought, beneath God\'s hand. And the sure return of the\r\nsun at last came upon her like a miracle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n     "\'Tis not for every one to catch a salmon."\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one who knows Middleshire knows that the little lake of Beaumere\r\nis bounded on the one side by the Westhope and on the other by the\r\nWilderleigh property, the boundary being the ubiquitous Drone, which\r\ntraverses the mere in a desultory fashion, and with the assistance of\r\nseveral springs makes Beaumere what it is, namely (to quote from the\r\nlocal guide-book), "the noblest expanse of water surrounded by some of\r\nthe most picturesque scenery in Middleshire."\r\n\r\nThither Doll and Hugh took their way in the leisurely manner of men\r\nwhose orthodoxy obliges them to regard Sunday as a day of rest.\r\n\r\nDoll pointed out to Hugh the coppice which his predecessor, Mr. George\r\nLoftus, had planted. Hugh regarded it without excitement. Both agreed\r\nthat it was coming on nicely. Hugh thought that he ought to do a little\r\nplanting at his own place. Doll said, "You can\'t do everything at once."\r\nA large new farm was the next object of interest. "Uncle George rebuilt\r\nGreenfields from the ground," remarked Doll, as they crossed the high\r\nroad and took to the harvesting fields, where "the ricks stood gray to\r\nthe sun."\r\n\r\nHugh nodded. Doll thought he was a very decent chap, though rather\r\nlow-spirited. Hugh thought that if Mr. George Loftus had been alive he\r\nmight have consulted him. In an amicable silence, broken occasionally by\r\nwhistling for Crack, who hurried blear-eyed and asthmatic out of\r\nrabbit-holes, the pair reached Beaumere; and, after following the path\r\nthrough the wood, came suddenly upon the little lake locked in the heart\r\nof the steeply climbing forest.\r\n\r\nDoll stood still and pointed with his stick for fear Hugh might overlook\r\nit. "I come here every Sunday," he remarked.\r\n\r\nA sense of unreality and foreboding seized on Hugh, as the still face of\r\nthe water looked up at him. Where had he seen it before, this sea of\r\nglass reflecting the yellow woods that stooped to its very edge? What\r\nhad it to do with him?\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been here before," he said, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"I dare say," said Doll. "Newhaven marches with me here. The boundary is\r\nby that clump of silver birch. The Drone comes in there, but you can\'t\r\nsee it. The Newhavens are friends of yours, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Acquaintances," said Hugh, absently, looking hard at the water. He had\r\nnever been here before. Memory groped blindly for a lost link, as one\r\nwho momentarily recognizes a face in a crowd, and tries to put a name to\r\nit and fails. As the face disappears, so the sudden impression passed\r\nfrom Hugh\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"I expect you have been here with them," said Doll. "Good man,\r\nNewhaven."\r\n\r\n"I used to see a good deal of them at one time," said Hugh; "but they\r\nseem to have forgotten me of late."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s her!" said Doll. "She is always off and on with people.\r\nTakes a fancy one day and a dislike the next. But he\'s not like that.\r\nYou always know where to find him. Solid man, Newhaven. He doesn\'t say\r\nmuch, but what he says he sticks to."\r\n\r\n"He gives one that impression," said Hugh.\r\n\r\n"I rather think he is there now," said Doll, pointing to the farther\r\nshore. "I see a figure moving, and two little specks. I should not\r\nwonder if it were him and the boys. They often come here on Sunday\r\nafternoons."\r\n\r\n"You have long sight," said Hugh. He had met Lord Newhaven several times\r\nsince the drawing of lots, and they had always greeted each other with\r\ncold civility. But Hugh avoided him when he could without drawing\r\nattention to the fact that he did so.\r\n\r\n"Are you going over to his side?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Doll. "I have never set a single trimmer or fired a\r\nshot beyond that clump of birch, or Uncle George before me."\r\n\r\nThe two men picked their way down the hill-side among the tall, thin\r\ntree-trunks. There was no one except the dogs at the keeper\'s cottage,\r\nin a clearing half-way down. Doll took the key of the boat-house from a\r\nlittle hole under the eaves.\r\n\r\n"I think Withers must be out," he remarked at last, after knocking and\r\ncalling at the locked door and peering through the closed window. Hugh\r\nhad been of that opinion for some time. "Gone out with his wife, I\r\nexpect. Never mind, we can do without him."\r\n\r\nThey went slipping over the dry beech-mast to the boat-house. Doll\r\nunlocked the door and climbed into one of the boats; Hugh and Crack\r\nfollowed. They got a perch-rod off a long shelf, and half a dozen\r\ntrimmers. Then they pulled out a little way and stopped near an\r\narchipelago of water-lily leaves.\r\n\r\nDoll got out the perch-rod and float and made a cast.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not fishing," he said, apologetically, half to his guest and half\r\nto his Maker. "But we are bound to get some baits."\r\n\r\nHugh nodded, and gazed down at the thin forest below. He could see the\r\nperch moving in little companies in the still water beyond the\r\nwater-trees. Presently a perch, a very small one, out alone for the\r\nfirst time, came up, all stiff head and shoulders and wagging tail, to\r\nthe carelessly covered hook.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, don\'t, you young idiot!" said Hugh, below his breath. But the\r\nperch knew that the time had come when a perch must judge for himself.\r\n\r\nThe float curtesied and went under, and in another second the little\r\nindependent was in the boat.\r\n\r\n"There are other fools in the world besides me, it seems," said Hugh to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll do; but I wish he was a dace," said Doll, slipping the victim\r\ninto a tin with holes in the top. "Half a dozen will be enough."\r\n\r\nThey got half a dozen, baited and set the trimmers white side up, and\r\nwere turning to row back, when Doll\'s eyes became suddenly fixed.\r\n\r\n"By Jove! there\'s something at it," he said, pointing to a trimmer at\r\nsome distance.\r\n\r\nBoth men looked intently at it. Crack felt that something was happening,\r\nand left off smelling the empty fish-can.\r\n\r\nThe trimmer began to nod, to tilt, and then turned suddenly upsidedown,\r\nand remained motionless.\r\n\r\n"He\'s running the line off it," said Doll.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the trimmer gave one jerk and went under. Then it\r\nreappeared, awkwardly bustling out into the open.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hang it all! it\'s Sunday," said Doll, with a groan. "We can\'t be\r\ncatching pike on a Sunday." And he caught up the oars and rowed swiftly\r\ntowards the trimmer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were within a boat\'s length it disappeared again, came\r\nup again, and went pecking along the top of the water. Doll pursued\r\nwarily, and got hold of it.\r\n\r\n"Gently, now," he said, as he shipped the oars. "He\'ll go under the boat\r\nand break us if we don\'t look out. I\'ll play him, and you shove the net\r\nunder him. Damn!--God forgive me!--we\'ve come out without a landing-net.\r\nGood Lord, Scarlett, you can\'t gaff him with a champagne-opener. There,\r\nyou pull him in, and I\'ll grab him somehow. I\'ve done it before. Crack,\r\nlie down, you infernal fool! Scarlett, if you pull him like that you\'ll\r\nlose him to a certainty. By George, he\'s a big one!" Doll tore off his\r\ncoat and turned up his shirt-sleeves. "He\'s going under the boat. If you\r\nlet him go under the boat, I tell you, he\'ll break us. I\'m quite ready."\r\nDoll was rubbing his waistcoat-buttons against the gunwale. "Bring him\r\nin gradually. For goodness\' sake, keep your feet off the line, or, if\r\nhe makes a dash, he\'ll break you! Give him line. Keep your elbows out.\r\nKeep your hands free. Don\'t let him jerk you. If you don\'t give him more\r\nline when he runs, you\'ll lose him. He\'s not half done yet. Confound\r\nyou, Scarlett! hold on for all you\'re worth. All right, old chap, all\r\nright. Don\'t mind me. You\'re doing it first-class. Right as rain. Now,\r\nnow. By George! did you see him that time? He\'s a nailer! Steady on him!\r\nBring him in gently. Keep an even pull on him. Keep steady!"\r\n\r\nDoll craned over the gunwale, his arms in the water. There was a swirl,\r\na momentary glimpse of a stolid fish, face and heavy shoulders, and the\r\nboat righted itself.\r\n\r\n"Missed him, as I live!" gasped Doll. "Bring him in again."\r\n\r\nHugh let out the slippery line, and drew it in again slowly, hand over\r\nhand. Doll\'s round head was over the side, his long legs spread\r\nadhesively in the bottom of the boat. Crack, beyond himself with\r\nexcitement, got on the seat and barked without ceasing.\r\n\r\n"He\'s coming up again," said Doll, gutturally, sliding forward his left\r\nhand. "I must get him by the eyes, and then I doubt if I can lift him.\r\nHe\'s a big brute. He\'s dragging the whole boat and everything. He\'s\r\nabout done now. Steady! Now!"\r\n\r\nThe great side of the pike lay heaving on the surface for a second, and\r\nDoll\'s left forefinger and thumb were groping for its eyes. But the\r\nagonized pike made a last effort. Doll had him with his left hand, but\r\ncould not raise him. "Pull him in now for all you\'re worth," he roared\r\nto Hugh, as he made a grab with his right hand. His legs began to lose\r\ntheir grip under the violent contortions of the pike. The boat tilted\r\nmadly. Hugh reached forward to help him. There was a frantic effort, and\r\nit capsized.\r\n\r\n"Bad luck," said Doll, coming up spluttering, shaking his head like a\r\nspaniel. "But we shall get him yet. He\'s bleeding like a pig. He\'ll\r\ncome up directly. Good Lord! the water\'s like ice. We must be over one\r\nof the springs. I suppose you are all right, Scarlett."\r\n\r\nHugh had come up, but in very different fashion.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, faintly, clutching the upturned boat.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure," said Doll, keeping going with one hand, "that we had not\r\nbetter get ashore and fetch the other boat. The water\'s enough to freeze\r\none."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t swim," said Hugh, his teeth chattering.\r\n\r\nHe was a delicate man at the best of times, and the cold was laying hold\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nDoll looked at his blue lips and shaking hands, and his face became\r\ngrave. He measured the distance to the shore with his eye. It had\r\nreceded in a treacherous manner.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much of a performer myself," he said, "since I broke my arm\r\nlast winter, but I can get to the shore. The question is, can you hold\r\non while I go back and bring the other boat, or shall we have a try at\r\ngetting back together?"\r\n\r\n"I can hold on all right," said Hugh, instantly aware that Doll did not\r\nthink he could tow him to land, but was politely ready to risk his\r\nexistence in the attempt.\r\n\r\n"Back directly," said Doll, and without a second\'s delay he was gone.\r\nHugh put out his whole strength in the endeavor to raise himself\r\nsomewhat out of the ice-cold water. But the upturned boat sidled away\r\nfrom him like a skittish horse, and after grappling with it he only\r\nslipped back again exhausted, and had to clutch it as best he could.\r\n\r\nAs he clung to the gunwale he heard a faint coughing and gasping close\r\nto his ear. Some one was drowning. Hugh realized that it must be Crack,\r\nunder the boat. He called to him; he chirruped, as if all were well. He\r\nstretched one hand as far as he could under the boat feeling for him.\r\nBut he could not reach him. Presently the faint, difficult sound ceased,\r\nbegan again, stopped, and was heard no more.\r\n\r\nA great silence seemed to rush in on the extinction of that small sound.\r\nIt stooped down and enveloped Hugh in it. Everything was very calm, very\r\nstill. The boat kept turning slowly round and round, the only thing that\r\nmoved. The sunlight quivered on the wet, upturned keel. Already it was\r\ndrying in patches. Hugh watched it. The cold was sapping his powers as\r\nif he were bleeding.\r\n\r\n"I could have built a boat in the time Loftus takes to fetch one," he\r\nsaid to himself, and he looked round him. No sign of Doll. He was alone\r\nin the world. The cold was gaining on him slowly, surely. Why had he on\r\nsuch heavy gloves, which made him fumble so clumsily. He looked at his\r\nbare cut hands, and realized that their grip was leaving them. He felt\r\nthat he was in measurable distance of losing his hold.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a remembrance flashed across him of the sinister face of the\r\nwater as it had first looked up at him through the trees. Now he\r\nunderstood. This was the appointed place for him to die. Hugh tightened\r\nhis hold with his right hand, for his left was paralyzed.\r\n\r\n"I will not," he said. "Nothing shall induce me. I will live and marry\r\nRachel."\r\n\r\nThe cold advanced suddenly on him, as at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n"Why not die?" said another voice. "Will it be easier in three months\'\r\ntime than it is now? Will it ever be so easy again? See how near death\r\nis to life, a wheel within a wheel, two rings linked together. A touch,\r\nand you pass from one to the other."\r\n\r\nHugh looked wildly round him. The sun lay warm upon the tree-tops. It\r\ncould not be that he was going to die _here_ and _now_; here in the\r\nliving sunshine, with the quiet, friendly faces of the hills all around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe strengthened his numb hold fiercely, all but lost it, regained it.\r\nCramp, long held at bay, overcame him.\r\n\r\nAnd the boat kept turning in the twilight. He reached the end of his\r\nstrength, and held on beyond it. He heard some one near at hand\r\nsuffocating in long-drawn gasps. Not Crack this time, but himself.\r\n\r\nThe boat was always turning in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was over. "It is better so," said the other voice, through\r\nthe roaring of a cataract near at hand. "Your mother will bear it better\r\nso. And all the long difficulties are over, and pain is past, and life\r\nis past, and sleep is best."\r\n\r\n"But Rachel?"\r\n\r\nShe was here in the warm, swaying darkness. She was with him. She was\r\nDeath. Death was only her arms round him in a great peace. Death was\r\nbetter than life. He let go the silly boat that kept him from her and\r\nturned wholly to her, his closed eyes against her breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n     The main difference between people seems to be that one man can\r\n     come under obligations on which you can rely--is obligable--and\r\n     another is not. As he has not a law within him, there\'s nothing to\r\n     tie him to.--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Father," said Teddy to Lord Newhaven, "do--do be a horse, and I will\r\nride you in the water."\r\n\r\n"Me, too," said Pauly.\r\n\r\n"I am not anxious to be a horse, Teddy. I\'m quite content as I am."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven was stretched in an easy but undefensive attitude on the\r\nheathery bank, with his hands behind his head. His two sons rushed\r\nsimultaneously at him and knelt on his chest.\r\n\r\n"Promise!" they cried, punching him. "Two turns each." There was a free\r\nfight, and Lord Newhaven promised.\r\n\r\n"Honor bright! Two turns each, and really deep!"\r\n\r\n"Honor bright," said Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\nHis two sons got off his chest, and Teddy climbed on his back in\r\nreadiness, as his father sat up and began to unlace his boots.\r\n\r\n"Higher!" said Teddy, over his shoulder, his arms tightly clasped round\r\nhis father\'s neck, as Lord Newhaven rolled up his trousers.\r\n\r\n"You young slave-driver, they won\'t go up any higher."\r\n\r\n"You said \'honor bright.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, Shylock, I _am_ \'honor bright.\'"\r\n\r\n"You had them over your knees last time."\r\n\r\n"I had knickerbockers on, then."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t these do the same?"\r\n\r\n"They won\'t come up another inch."\r\n\r\n"Then one, two, three--off!" shrieked Teddy, digging his heels into the\r\nparental back.\r\n\r\nThe horse displayed surprising agility. It curveted, it kicked, it\r\njumped a little drain, it careered into the water, making a tremendous\r\nsplashing.\r\n\r\nThe two boys screamed with delight.\r\n\r\nBut at last the horse sat down on the bank gasping, wiped its forehead,\r\nand, in spite of frenzied entreaties, proceeded to put on its socks and\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven was not to be moved a second time. He lit a cigarette and\r\nobserved that the moment for sailing boats had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe boats were accordingly sailed. Lord Newhaven tilted his hat over his\r\neyes and acted as umpire.\r\n\r\n"It is not usual to sail boats upsidedown," he said, seeing Teddy\r\ndeliberately upset his.\r\n\r\n"They are doing it out there," said Teddy, who had a reason for most\r\nthings. And he continued to sail his boat upsidedown.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven got up, and swept the water with his eye. His face became\r\nkeen. Then his glance fell anxiously on the children.\r\n\r\n"Teddy and Pauly," he said, "promise me that you will both play on this\r\none bit of sand, and not go in the water till I come back."\r\n\r\nThey promised, staring bewildered at their father.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Lord Newhaven was tearing through the brushwood that\r\nfringed the water\'s edge.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the boat-house he saw another figure trying to shove out\r\nthe remaining boat.\r\n\r\nIt was Doll. Lord Newhaven pushed her off and jumped in.\r\n\r\nDoll was almost speechless. His breath came in long gasps. The sweat\r\nhung on his forehead. He pointed to the black, upturned boat.\r\n\r\n"This one leaks," said Lord Newhaven, sharply.\r\n\r\n"It\'s got to go all the same, and sharp," said Doll, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven seized up a fishing-tin and thrust it into Doll\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"You bale while I row," he said, and he rowed as he had never rowed\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he said, as the boat shot out into the open.\r\n\r\nDoll was baling like a madman.\r\n\r\n"Scarlett," he said. "And he\'s over one of the springs. He\'ll get\r\ncramp."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven strained at the oars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsciousness was coming back, was slowly climbing upwards, upwards\r\nthrough immense intervals of time and space, to where at last, with a\r\nwrench, pain met it half-way. Hugh stirred feebly in the dark of a great\r\nforlornness and loneliness.\r\n\r\n"Rachel," he said--"Rachel."\r\n\r\nHis head was gently raised, and a cup pressed to his lips. He swallowed\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nHe groped in the darkness for a window, and then opened his eyes. Lord\r\nNewhaven withdrew a pace or two, and stood looking at him.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\r\nNeither spoke; but Hugh\'s eyes, dark with the shadow of death, said\r\nplainly, "Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?"\r\n\r\nThen he turned them slowly, as an infant turns them to the sky, the\r\nclimbing woods, leaning over each other\'s shoulders to look at him, to\r\nthe warm earth on which he lay. At a little distance was stretched a\r\nsmall rough-haired form. Hugh\'s eyes fixed on it. It lay very still.\r\n\r\n"Crack," he said, suddenly, raising himself on his elbow.\r\n\r\nThere was neither speech nor language. Crack\'s tail, that courteous\r\nmember, made no sign.\r\n\r\n"He was under the boat," said Lord Newhaven, looking narrowly at the\r\nexhausted face of the man he had saved, and unable for the life of him\r\nto help a momentary fellow-feeling about the little dog.\r\n\r\nHugh remembered. It all came back, the boat, Crack\'s dying gasps, the\r\nagonized struggle, the strait gate of death, the difficult passage\r\nthrough it, the calm beyond. He had almost got through, and had been\r\ndragged back.\r\n\r\n"Why did you interfere?" he said, in sudden passion, his eyes flaming in\r\nhis white face.\r\n\r\nA dull color rose to Lord Newhaven\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was an accident," he said. "If it was not, I beg your\r\npardon."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"It _was_ an accident," said Hugh, hoarsely, and he turned on his elbow\r\nand looked fixedly at the water, so that his companion might not see the\r\nworking of his face.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven walked slowly away in the direction of Doll, whose distant\r\nfigure, followed by another, was hurrying towards them.\r\n\r\n"And so there is a Rachel as well, is there?" he said to himself, vainly\r\ntrying to steel himself against his adversary.\r\n\r\n"How is he now?" said Doll, coming within ear-shot.\r\n\r\n"He\'s all right; but you\'d better get him into dry clothes, and\r\nyourself, too."\r\n\r\n"Change on the bank," said Doll, seizing a bundle from the keeper. "It\'s\r\nas hot as an oven in the sun. Why, Scarlett\'s sitting up! I thought when\r\nwe laid into him on the bank that he was too far gone, didn\'t you? I\r\nsuppose"--hesitating--"Crack?"\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I must go back to my boys now," he said, "or they will be getting into\r\nmischief."\r\n\r\nDoll nodded. He and Lord Newhaven had had a hard fight to get the\r\nleaking boat to land with Hugh at the bottom of it. It had filled\r\nominously when Doll ceased baling to help to drag in the heavy,\r\nunconscious body.\r\n\r\nThere had been a moment when, inapprehensive as he was, Doll had\r\nremembered, with a qualm, that Lord Newhaven could not swim.\r\n\r\n"Every fellow ought to swim," was the moral he drew from the incident\r\nand repeated to his wife, who, struck by the soundness of the remark,\r\nrepeated it to the Gresleys.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven retraced his steps slowly along the bank in his\r\nwater-logged boots. He was tired, and he did not hurry, for he could see\r\nin the distance two small figures sitting faithfully on a log where he\r\nhad left them.\r\n\r\n"Good little chaps," he said, half aloud.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself his thoughts went back to Hugh. His feelings towards\r\nhim had not changed, but they had been forced during the last half-hour\r\nout of their original intrenchments into the open, and were liable to\r\nattack from new directions.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he had virtually saved Hugh\'s life, for Doll would never\r\nhave got him into the leaking boat and kept it afloat single-handed.\r\nThat first moment of enthusiasm, when he had rubbed the senseless limbs\r\nand breathed into the cold lips, and had felt his heart leap when life\r\ncame halting back into them, that moment had passed and left him cold.\r\n\r\nBut Hugh\'s melancholy eyes, as they opened once more on this world and\r\nmet his unflinchingly, haunted him, and the sudden anger at his\r\ninterference. It was the intrenchment of his contempt that Lord Newhaven\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\nA meaner nature would not have let him off so easily as Hugh had done.\r\n\r\n"It _was_ an accident," he said to himself, unwillingly. "He need not\r\nhave admitted that, but I should have been on a gridiron if he had not.\r\nIn different circumstances that man and I might have been friends. And\r\nif he had got into a scrape of this kind a little further afield I might\r\nhave helped to get him out of it. He feels it. He has aged during the\r\nlast two months. But as it is--Upon my word, if he were a boy I should\r\nhave had to let him off. It would have been too bloodthirsty. But he is\r\nseven-and-twenty. He is old enough to know better. She made a fool of\r\nhim, of course. She made a greater one of me once, for I--married her."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven reviewed with a dispassionate eye his courtship and\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"A wood anemone," he said to himself; "I likened her to a wood anemone.\r\nGood Lord! And I was thirty years of age, while this poor devil is\r\ntwenty-seven."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven stopped short with fixed eyes.\r\n\r\n"I believe I should have to let him off," he said, half-aloud. "I\r\nbelieve I would let him off if I was not as certain as I stand here that\r\nhe will never do it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n     "The less wit a man has, the less he knows that he wants it."\r\n\r\n\r\nHester always took charge of the three elder children and Fr\xe4ulein of\r\nthe baby during the six-o\'clock service, so that the nurse might go to\r\nchurch. On this particular Sunday afternoon Hester and the children were\r\nwaiting in the little hall till the bell stopped, before which moment\r\nthey were forbidden to leave the house. Mr. and Mrs. Gresley had just\r\nstarted for the church, Mr. Gresley looking worn and harassed, for since\r\nluncheon he had received what he called "a perfectly unaccountable\r\nletter" from one of his principal parishioners, a Dissenter, who had\r\nbeen present at the morning service, and who Mr. Gresley had confidently\r\nhoped might have been struck by the sermon. This hope had been\r\njustified, but not in the manner Mr. Gresley had expected. Mr. Walsh\r\nopined, in a large round hand, that as worms (twice under-dashed) did\r\nnot usually pay voluntary church and school rates he no longer felt\r\nhimself under an obligation to do so, etc. The letter was a great, an\r\nunexpected blow. Who could have foreseen such a result of the morning\'s\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\n"The truth is," said Mr. Gresley, tremulously, "that they can\'t and\r\nwon\'t hear reason. They can\'t controvert what I say, so they take refuge\r\nin petty spite like this. I must own I am disappointed in Walsh. He is a\r\nman of some education, and liberal as regards money. I had thought he\r\nwas better than most of them, and now he turns on me like this."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a way worms have," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t run a simile to death, Hester," said Mr. Gresley,\r\nimpatiently. "If you had listened to what I tried to say this morning\r\nyou would have seen I only used the word _worm_ figuratively. I never\r\nmeant it literally, as any one could see who was not determined to\r\nmisunderstand me. Worms pay school-rates! Such folly is positively\r\nsickening, if it were not malicious."\r\n\r\nHester had remained silent. She had been deeply vexed for her brother at\r\nthe incident.\r\n\r\nAs the church-bell stopped the swing-door opened, and Boulou hurried in,\r\nlike a great personage, conscious that others have waited, and bearing\r\nwith him an aroma of Irish stew and onions, which showed that he had\r\nbeen exchanging affabilities with the cook. For the truth must be owned.\r\nNo spinster over forty could look unmoved on Boulou. Alas! for the\r\nVicarage cook, who "had kept herself _to_ herself" for nearly fifty\r\nyears, only to fall the victim of a "grande passion" for Boulou.\r\n\r\nThe little Lovelace bounded in, and the expedition started. It was\r\nRegie\'s turn to choose where they should go, and he decided on the\r\n"shrubbery," a little wood through which ran the private path to\r\nWilderleigh. Doll Loftus had given the Gresleys leave to take the\r\nchildren there.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Regie, we always go there," said Mary, plaintively, who invariably\r\nchose the Pratts\' park, with its rustic bridges and _ch\xe2lets_, which Mr.\r\nPratt, in a gracious moment, had "thrown open" to the Gresleys on\r\nSundays, because, as he expressed it, "they must feel so cramped in\r\ntheir little garden."\r\n\r\nBut Regie adhered to his determination, and to the "shrubberies" they\r\nwent. Hester was too tired to play with them, too tired even to tell\r\nthem a story; so she sat under a tree while they circled in the coppice\r\nnear at hand.\r\n\r\nAs we grow older we realize that in the new gardens where life leads us\r\nwe never learn the shrubs and trees by heart as we did as children in\r\nour old Garden of Eden, round the little gabled house where we were\r\nborn. We were so thorough as children. We knew the underneath of every\r\nlaurel-bush, the shape of its bunches of darkling branches, the green\r\ndust that our small restless bodies rubbed off from its under twigs. We\r\nsee now as strangers those little hanging horse-tails of pink, which\r\nsad-faced elders call _ribes_; but once long ago, when the world was\r\nyoung, we knew them eye to eye, and the compact little black insects on\r\nthem, and the quaint taste of them, and the clean, clean smell of them.\r\nEverything had a taste in those days, and was submitted to that test,\r\njust as until it had been licked the real color of any object of\r\ninterest was not ascertained. There was a certain scarlet berry, very\r\nred without and very white within, which we were warned was deadly\r\npoison. How well, after a quarter of a century, we remember the bitter\r\ntaste of it; how much better than many other forbidden fruits duly\r\nessayed in later years. We ate those scarlet berries and lived, though\r\nwarned to the contrary.\r\n\r\nPresently Boulou, who could do nothing simply, found a dead mouse, where\r\nany one else could have found it, in the middle of the path, and made it\r\nan occasion for a theatrical display of growlings and shakings. The\r\nchildren decided to bury it, and after a becoming silence their voices\r\ncould be heard singing "Home, Sweet Home," as the body was being lowered\r\ninto the grave previously dug by Boulou, who had to be forcibly\r\nrestrained from going on digging it after the obsequies were over.\r\n\r\n"He never knows when to stop," said Regie, wearily, as Boulou, with a\r\nlittle plaster of earth on his nose, was carried coughing back to\r\nHester.\r\n\r\nAs she took him Rachel and Sybell came slowly down the path towards\r\nthem, and the latter greeted Hester with an effusion which suggested\r\nthat when two is not company three may be.\r\n\r\n"A most vexing thing has happened," said Sybell, in a gratified tone,\r\nsitting down under Hester\'s tree. "I really don\'t think I am to blame.\r\nYou know Mr. Tristram, the charming artist who has been staying with\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"I know him," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Well, he was set on making a sketch of me for one of his large\r\npictures, and it was to have been finished to-day. I don\'t see any harm\r\nmyself in drawing on Sunday. I know the Gresleys do, and I love the\r\nGresleys, he has such a powerful mind; but one must think for one\'s\r\nself, and it was only the upper lip, so I consented to sit for him at\r\nfour o\'clock. I noticed he seemed a little--well rather--"\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"The last few days. But, of course, I took no notice of it. A married\r\nwoman often has to deal with such things without making a fuss about\r\nthem. Well, I overslept myself, and it was nearly half-past four before\r\nI awoke. And when I went into my sitting-room a servant brought me a\r\nnote. It was from him, saying he had been obliged to leave Wilderleigh\r\nsuddenly on urgent business, and asking that his baggage might be sent\r\nafter him."\r\n\r\nHester raised her eyes slightly, as if words failed her. Sybell\'s\r\nconversation always interested her.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the reason she is never told anything," she said to herself,\r\n"is because the ground the confidence would cover is invariably built\r\nover already by a fiction of her own which it would not please her to\r\nsee destroyed."\r\n\r\n"Who would have thought," continued Sybell, "that he would have behaved\r\nin that way because I was one little half-hour late. And of course the\r\npretext of urgent business is too transparent, because there is no\r\nSunday post, and the telegraph-boy had not been up. I asked that. And he\r\nwas so anxious to finish the sketch. He almost asked to stay over Sunday\r\non purpose."\r\n\r\nRachel and Hester looked on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Rachel said he was all right in the garden just before, didn\'t you,\r\nRachel?"\r\n\r\n"I said I thought he was a little nervous."\r\n\r\nAnd what did he talk to you about?"\r\n\r\n"He spoke about the low tone of the morals of the day, and about\r\nmarriage."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I don\'t wonder he talked to you, Rachel, you are so sympathetic. I\r\nexpect lots of people confide in you about their troubles and love\r\naffairs. Morals of the day! Marriage! Poor, poor Mr. Tristram! I shall\r\ntell Doll quietly this evening. On the whole, it is just as well he is\r\ngone."\r\n\r\n"Just as well," said Rachel and Hester, with surprising unanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n     So fast does a little leaven spread within us--so incalculable is\r\n     the effect of one personality on another.--GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHugh was not ill after what Mr. Gresley called "his immersion," but for\r\nsome days he remained feeble and exhausted. Sybell quite forgot she had\r\nnot liked him, insisted on his staying on indefinitely at Wilderleigh,\r\nand, undaunted by her distressing experience with Mr. Tristram, read\r\npoetry to Hugh in the afternoons and surrounded him with genuine\r\nwarm-hearted care. Doll was steadily, quietly kind.\r\n\r\nIt was during these days that Hugh and Rachel saw much of each other,\r\nduring these days that Rachel passed in spite of herself beyond the\r\nanxious impersonal interest which Hugh had awakened in her, on to that\r\nslippery much-trodden ground of uncomfortable possibilities where the\r\nunmarried meet.\r\n\r\nHugh attracted and repelled her.\r\n\r\nIt was, alas! easy to say why she was repelled. But who shall say why\r\nshe was attracted? Has the secret law ever been discovered which draws\r\none man and woman together amid the crowd? Hugh was not among the best\r\nmen who had wished to marry her, but nevertheless he was the only man\r\nsince Mr. Tristram who had succeeded in making her think continually of\r\nhim. And perhaps she half knew that though she had been loved by better\r\nmen, Hugh loved her better than they had.\r\n\r\nWhich would prove the stronger, the attraction or the repulsion?\r\n\r\n"How can I?" she said to herself, over and over again.\r\n\r\n"When I remember Lady Newhaven, how can I? When I think of what his\r\nconduct was for a whole year, how can I? Can he have any sense of honor\r\nto have acted like that? Is he even really sorry? He is very charming,\r\nvery refined, and he loves me. He looks good, but what do I know of him\r\nexcept evil? He looks as if he could be faithful, but how can I trust\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nHugh fell into a deep dejection after his narrow escape. Dr. Brown said\r\nit was nervous prostration, and Doll rode into Southminster and returned\r\nladen with comic papers. Who shall say whether the cause was physical or\r\nmental? Hugh had seen death very near for the first time, and the\r\nthought of death haunted him. He had not realized when he drew lots that\r\nhe was risking the possibility of anything like _that_, such an entire\r\ngoing away, such an awful rending of his being as the short word _death_\r\nnow conveyed to him. He had had no idea it would be like _that_. And he\r\nhad got to do it again. There was the crux. He had got to do it again.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back faint and shuddering in the deck-chair in the rose-garden\r\nwhere he was lying.\r\n\r\nPresently Rachel appeared, coming towards him down the narrow grass walk\r\nbetween two high walls of hollyhocks. She had a cup of tea in her hand.\r\n\r\n"I have brought you this," she said, "with a warning that you had better\r\nnot come in to tea. Mr. Gresley has been sighted walking up the drive.\r\nMrs. Loftus thought you would like to see him, but I reminded her that\r\nDr. Brown said you were to be kept very quiet."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley had called every day since the accident in order to cheer\r\nthe sufferer, to whom he had been greatly attracted. Hugh had seen him\r\nonce, and afterwards had never felt strong enough to repeat the process.\r\n\r\n"Must you go back?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "Mrs. Loftus and he are great friends. I should be\r\nrather in the way."\r\n\r\nAnd she sat down by him.\r\n\r\n"Are you feeling ill?" she said, gently, noticing his careworn face.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied. "I was only thinking. I was thinking," he went on,\r\nafter a pause, "that I would give everything I possess not to have done\r\nsomething which I have done."\r\n\r\nRachel looked straight in front of her. The confession was coming at\r\nlast. Her heart beat.\r\n\r\n"I have done wrong," he said, slowly, "and I am suffering for it, and I\r\nshall suffer more before I\'ve finished. But the worst is--"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him.\r\n\r\n"The worst is that I can\'t bear all the consequences myself. An innocent\r\nperson will pay the penalty of my sin."\r\n\r\nHugh\'s voice faltered. He was thinking of his mother.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s mind instantly flew to Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"Then Lord Newhaven drew the short lighter," she thought, and she\r\ncolored deeply.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," said Hugh, smiling faintly, "that people are ever given\r\na second chance?"\r\n\r\n"Always," said Rachel. "If not here--afterwards."\r\n\r\n"If I were given another," said Hugh. "If I might only be given another\r\nnow in this life I should take it."\r\n\r\nHe was thinking if only he might be let off this dreadful self-inflicted\r\ndeath. She thought he meant that he repented of his sin, and would fain\r\ndo better.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of voices near at hand. Sybell and Mr. Gresley came\r\ndown the grass walk towards them.\r\n\r\n"London society," Mr. Gresley was saying, "to live in a stuffy street\r\naway from the beauties of Nature, its birds and flowers, to spend half\r\nmy days laying traps for invitations, and half my nights grinning like a\r\nfool in stifling drawing-rooms, listening to vapid talk. No, thanks! I\r\nknow better than to care for London society. Hester does, I know, but\r\nthen Hester does not mind making up to big people, and I do. In fact--"\r\n\r\n"I have brought Mr. Gresley, after all, in spite of Dr. Brown," said\r\nSybell, "because we were in the middle of such an interesting\r\nconversation on the snares of society that I knew you would like to hear\r\nit. You have had such a dull day with Doll away at his County Council."\r\n\r\nThat night, as Rachel sat in her room, she went over that half-made,\r\nruthlessly interrupted confidence.\r\n\r\n"He does repent," she said to herself, recalling the careworn face. "If\r\nhe does, can I overlook the past? Can I help him to make a fresh start?\r\nIf he had not done this one dishonorable action, I could have cared for\r\nhim. Can I now?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n     "A fool\'s mouth is his destruction."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe superficial reader of these pages may possibly have forgotten, but\r\nthe earnest one will undoubtedly remember that in an earlier chapter a\r\nsale of work was mentioned which was to take place in the Wilderleigh\r\ngardens at the end of August.\r\n\r\nThe end of August had now arrived, and with it two white tents, which\r\nsprang up suddenly one morning, like giant mushrooms, on one of Doll\'s\r\nsmooth-shaven lawns. He groaned in spirit as he watched their erection.\r\nThey would ruin the turf.\r\n\r\n"Might as well iron it with a hot iron," he said, disconsolately to\r\nHugh. "But, of course, this sort of thing--Diocesan Fund, eh? In these\r\ndays we must stand by our colors." He repeated Mr. Gresley\'s phrase.\r\nDoll seldom ventured on an opinion not sanctioned by the ages, or that\r\nhe had not heard repeated till its novelty had been comfortably rubbed\r\noff by his wife or the Gresleys.\r\n\r\nThe two men watched the proceedings mournfully. They could not help, at\r\nleast they were told they could not help the women busily engaged in\r\ndraping and arranging the stalls. They were still at large, but Doll\r\nknew, as well as a dog who is going to be washed, what was in store for\r\nhim in the afternoon, and he was depressed beforehand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let yourself be run in," he said, generously to Hugh. "You\'re not\r\nup to it. It takes a strong man to grapple with this sort of thing.\r\nKills off the weakly ones like flies. You lie low in the smoking-room\r\ntill it\'s all over."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"All I can say is," remarked Mrs. Gresley, as she and Hester led the\r\nVicarage donkey and cart up the drive, heavily laden with the work of\r\nmany months, "that the Pratts have behaved exceedingly badly. Here they\r\nare, the richest people by far in the parish, and they would not even\r\ntake a stall, they would not even furnish half of one, and they said\r\nthey would be away, and they are at the Towers, after all. No one likes\r\nthe Pratts more than I do, or sees their good points as I do, but I\r\ncan\'t shut my eyes to the fact that they are the meanest of the mean."\r\n\r\nThe Pratts had only contributed two "bed-spreads," and a "sheet-sham,"\r\nand a set of antimacassars. If the reader wishes to know what\r\n"bed-spreads" and "sheet-shams" are, let him ask his intended, and let\r\nhim see to it that he marries a woman who cannot tell him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pratt had bought the antimacassars for the Towers, and secretly\r\nadored them until Ada pronounced them to be vulgar. The number of things\r\nwhich Ada discovered to be vulgar increased every day, and included the\r\ngreater part of her mother\'s wardrobe, much to the distress of that poor\r\nlady. Mrs. Pratt had reached the size when it is prudent to concentrate\r\na love of bright colors in one\'s parasol. On this particular afternoon\r\nshe shed tears over the fact that Ada refused to accompany her if her\r\nmother wore a unique garment of orange satin, covered with what appeared\r\nto be a plague of black worms.\r\n\r\nOf course, the sale of work was combined with a garden-party, and a\r\nlittle after three o\'clock carriage after carriage began to arrive, and\r\nSybell, with a mournful, handsome, irreproachably dressed husband, took\r\nup her position on the south front to receive her guests.\r\n\r\nThe whole neighborhood had been invited, and it can generally be gauged\r\nwith tolerable accuracy by a hostess of some experience who will respond\r\nto the call and who will stay away. Sybell and her husband were among\r\nthose who were not to be found at these festivities, neither were the\r\nNewhavens, save at their own, nor the Pontisburys, nor the Bishop of\r\nSouthminster. Cards had, of course, been sent to each, but no one\r\nexpected them to appear.\r\n\r\nPresently, among the stream of arrivals, Sybell noticed the slender\r\nfigure of Lady Newhaven, and--astonishing vision--Lord Newhaven beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Wonders will never cease," said Doll, shaken for a moment out of the\r\napathy of endurance.\r\n\r\nSybell raised her eyebrows, and advanced with the prettiest air of\r\n_empressement_ to meet her unexpected guests. No, clearly it was\r\nimpossible that the two women should like each other. They were the same\r\nage, about the same height and coloring; their social position was too\r\nsimilar; their historic houses too near each other. Lady Newhaven was by\r\nfar the best looking, but that was not a difference which attracted\r\nSybell towards her. On this occasion Sybell\'s face assumed its most\r\nsquirrel-like expression, for, as ill-luck would have it, they were\r\ndressed alike.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven looked very ethereal, as she came slowly across the grass\r\nin her diaphanous gown of rich white, covered with a flowing veil of\r\nthinnest transparent black. Her blue eyes looked restlessly bright; her\r\nlips wore a mechanical smile. Rachel, watching her, experienced a sudden\r\npang at her undeniable loveliness. It wounded her suddenly, as it never\r\nhad done before. "I am a common-looking, square-built woman compared to\r\nher," she said to herself. "No wonder he--"\r\n\r\nShe instinctively drew back as Lady Newhaven turned quickly towards her.\r\n\r\n"You dear person," said Lady Newhaven, her eyes moving restlessly over\r\nthe crowd, "are you still here? Let us go and buy something together.\r\nHow nice you look," without looking at her. She drew Rachel apart in the\r\ndirection of the tents.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" she said, sharply. "I know he is here. I heard all about\r\nthe accident, though Edward never told me. I don\'t see him."\r\n\r\n"He is not in the gardens. He is not coming out. He is still rather\r\nknocked up."\r\n\r\n"I thought I should have died when I heard it. Ah, Rachel, never love\r\nany one. You don\'t know what it\'s like. But I must see him. I have come\r\nhere on purpose."\r\n\r\n"So I supposed."\r\n\r\n"Edward would come, too. He appeared at the last moment when the\r\ncarriage came round, though I have never known him to go to a\r\ngarden-party in his life. But where is he, Rachel?"\r\n\r\n"Somewhere in the house, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t know where to find him. I can\'t be wandering about that\r\nwoman\'s house by myself. We must slip away together, Rachel, and you\r\nmust take me to him. I must see him alone for five minutes."\r\n\r\nRachel shook her head.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt, tall, pale, cautious, immaculate, his cane held along his\r\nspinal column, appeared suddenly close at hand.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Loftus is fortunate in her day," he remarked, addressing himself\r\nto Lady Newhaven, and observing her fixedly with cold admiration. "I\r\nseldom come to this sort of thing, but neighbors in the country must\r\nsupport each other. I see you are on your way to the tents. Pray allow\r\nme to carry your purchases for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t let me trouble you," said Lady Newhaven, shrinking\r\nimperceptibly. But it was no trouble to Captain Pratt, and they walked\r\non together.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven, who could not have been far off, joined Rachel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Pratt to Ada, "you might have let me wear my\r\nblack and orange, after all, for you see Lady Newhaven has something\r\nvery much the same, only hers is white underneath. And do you see she\r\nhas got two diamond butterflies on--the little one at her throat and the\r\nbig one holding her white carnations. And you would not let me put on a\r\nsingle thing. There now, Algy has joined her," continued Mrs. Pratt, her\r\nattention quickly diverted from her own wrongs. "Now they are walking on\r\ntogether. How nice he looks in those beautiful clothes. Algy and Lord\r\nNewhaven and Mr. Loftus all have the same look, haven\'t they? All\r\nfriends together, as I often say, such a mercy among county people. You\r\nmight walk a little with Lord Newhaven, Ada. It\'s unaccountable how\r\nseldom we see him, but always so pleasant when we do. Ah! he\'s speaking\r\nto Rachel West. They are going to the tents, after all. Well, whatever\r\nyou may say, I do think we ought to go and buy something, too. Papa says\r\nhe won\'t put his hand in his pocket if the Loftuses are to get all the\r\ncredit, and we ought to have had the choice of having the sale at the\r\nTowers, so he sha\'n\'t do anything; but I think it would be nice if we\r\nwent and bought a little something. Just a five-pound note. You shall\r\nspend it, my dear, if you like."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"This is sheer recklessness," said Lord Newhaven, as Rachel bought an\r\nexpensive tea-cosey from Fr\xe4ulein. "In these days of death-duties you\r\ncannot possess four teapots, and you have already bought three teapot\r\ncostumes."\r\n\r\n"That is what I am here for," said Rachel, producing a check-book. "How\r\nmuch did you say, Fr\xe4ulein?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-seven and seex," said Fr\xe4ulein.\r\n\r\n"Now I see it in the full light, I have taken a fancy to it myself,"\r\nsaid Lord Newhaven. "I never saw anything the least like it. I don\'t\r\nthink I can allow you to appropriate it, Miss West. You are sweeping up\r\nall the best things."\r\n\r\n"I have a verr\' pretty thing for gentlemen," said Fr\xe4ulein. "Herr\r\nB-r-r-rown has just bought one."\r\n\r\n"Very elaborate, indeed. Bible-markers, I presume? Oh, braces! Never\r\nmind, they will be equally useful to me. I\'ll have them. Now for the\r\ntea-cosey. It is under-priced. I consider that, with the chenille\r\nswallow, it is worth thirty shillings. I will give thirty for it."\r\n\r\n"Thirty-two and six," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"The landed interest is not going to be browbeaten by coal-mines.\r\nThirty-three and twopence."\r\n\r\n"Forty shillings," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"Forty-two," said Lord Newhaven.\r\n\r\nEvery one in the tent had turned to watch the bidding.\r\n\r\n"Forty-two and six," said Rachel.\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein blushed. She had worked the tea-cosey. It was to her a sonata\r\nin red plush.\r\n\r\n"Three guineas," said Captain Pratt, by an infallible instinct,\r\nperceiving, and placing himself within the focus of general interest.\r\n\r\nThe bidding ceased instantly. Lord Newhaven shrugged his shoulders and\r\nturned away. Fr\xe4ulein, still shaking with conflicting emotions, handed\r\nthe tea-cosey to Captain Pratt. He took it with an acid smile, secretly\r\ndisgusted at the sudden cessation of interest, for which he had paid\r\nrather highly, and looked round for Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\nBut she had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Fancy you and Algy bidding against each other like that," said Ada\r\nPratt, archly, to Lord Newhaven, for though Ada was haughty in general\r\nsociety she could be sportive, and even friskily ingratiating, towards\r\nthose of her fellow-creatures whom she termed "swells." "Why, half\r\nMiddleshire will be saying that you have quarrelled next."\r\n\r\n"Only those who do not know how intimate Captain Pratt and I really are\r\ncould think we have quarrelled," said Lord Newhaven, his eyes wandering\r\nover the crowd. "But I am blocking your way and Mrs. Pratt\'s. How do you\r\ndo, Mrs. Pratt? Miss West, your burden is greater than you can bear. You\r\nare dropping part of it. I don\'t know what it is, but I can shut my eyes\r\nas I pick it up. I insist on carrying half back to the house. It will\r\ngive a pleasing impression that I have bought largely. Weren\'t you\r\npleased at the money we wrung out of Captain Pratt? He never thought we\r\nshould stop bidding. It\'s about all the family will contribute, unless\r\nthat good old Mamma Pratt buys something. She is the only one of the\r\nfamily I can tolerate. Is Scarlett still here? I ought to have asked\r\nafter him before."\r\n\r\n"He\'s here, but he\'s not well. He\'s in hiding in the smoking-room."\r\n\r\n"He is lucky he is no worse. I should have had rheumatic fever if I had\r\nbeen in his place. How cool it is in here after the glare outside. Must\r\nyou go out again? Well, I consider I have done my duty, and that I may\r\nfairly allow myself a cigarette in peace."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Really, Mr. Loftus, I\'m quite shocked. This absurd faintness! The tent\r\nwas very crowded, and there is not much air to-day, is there? I shall be\r\nall right if I may sit quietly in the hail a little. How deliciously\r\ncool in here after the glare outside. A glass of water? Thanks. Yes,\r\nonly I hate to be so troublesome. And how are you after that dreadful\r\naccident in the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I am all right," said Doll, who by this time hated the subject. "It\r\nwas Scarlett who was nearly frozen like New Zealand lamb."\r\n\r\nDoll had heard Mr. Gresley fire off the simile of the lamb, and\r\nconsidered it sound.\r\n\r\n"How absurd you are. You always make me laugh. I suppose he has left now\r\nthat he is unfrozen."\r\n\r\n"Oh no. He is still here. We would not let him go till he was better. He\r\nis not up to much. Weak chap at the best of times, I should think. He\'s\r\nlying low in the smoking-room till the people are gone."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Scarlett is an old friend of ours," said Lady Newhaven, sipping her\r\nglass of water, and spilling a little; "but I can\'t quite forgive\r\nhim--no, I really can\'t--for the danger he caused to Edward. You know,\r\nor perhaps you don\'t know, that Edward can\'t swim, either. Even now I\r\ncan\'t bear to think what might have happened."\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes with evident emotion.\r\n\r\nDoll\'s stolid garden-party face relaxed. "Good little woman," he\r\nthought. "As fond of him as she can be."\r\n\r\n"All\'s well that ends well," he remarked, aloud.\r\n\r\nDoll did not know that he was quoting Shakespeare, but he did know by\r\nlong experience that this sentence could be relied on as suitable to\r\nthe occasion, or to any occasion that looked a little "doddery," and\r\nfinished up all right.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Loftus, positively I must insist on your leaving me\r\nquietly here. I am quite sure you are wanted outside, and I should blame\r\nmyself if you wasted another minute on me. It was only the sun which\r\naffected me. Don\'t mention it to Edward. He is always so fussy about me.\r\nI will rest quietly here for a quarter of an hour, and then rejoin you\r\nall again in the garden."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I hope I am not disturbing any one," said Lord Newhaven, quietly\r\nentering the smoking-room. "Well, Scarlett, how are you getting on?"\r\n\r\nHugh, who was lying on a sofa with his arms raised and his hands behind\r\nhis head, looked up, and his expression changed.\r\n\r\n"He was thinking of something uncommonly pleasant," thought Lord\r\nNewhaven, "not of me or mine, I fancy. I have come to smoke a cigarette\r\nin peace," he added aloud, "if you don\'t object."\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven lit his cigarette and puffed a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n"Hot outside," he said.\r\n\r\nHugh nodded. He wondered how soon he could make a pretext for getting up\r\nand leaving the room.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint silken rustle, and Lady Newhaven, pale, breathless,\r\ncame swiftly in and closed the door. The instant afterwards she saw her\r\nhusband, and shrank back with a little cry. Lord Newhaven did not look\r\nat her. His eyes were fixed on Hugh.\r\n\r\nHugh\'s face became suddenly ugly, livid. He rose slowly to his feet, and\r\nstood motionless.\r\n\r\n"He hates her," said Lord Newhaven to himself. And he removed his glance\r\nand came forward.\r\n\r\n"You were looking for me, Violet?" he remarked. "I have no doubt you are\r\nwishing to return home. We will go at once." He threw away his\r\ncigarette. "Well, good-bye, Scarlett, in case we don\'t meet again. I\r\ndare say you will pay Westhope a visit later on. Ah, Captain Pratt! so\r\nyou have fled, like us, from the madding crowd. I can recommend Loftus\'s\r\ncigarettes. I have just had one myself. Good-bye. Did you leave your\r\npurchases in the hall, Violet? Yes? Then we will collect them on our\r\nway."\r\n\r\nThe husband and wife were half-way down the grand staircase before Lord\r\nNewhaven said, in his usual even voice:\r\n\r\n"I must ask you once more to remember that I will not have any scandal\r\nattaching to your name. Did not you see that that white mongrel Pratt\r\nwas on your track? If I had not been there when he came in he would have\r\ndrawn his own vile conclusions, and for once they would have been\r\ncorrect."\r\n\r\n"He could not think worse of me than you do," said the wife, half cowed,\r\nhalf defiant.\r\n\r\n"No, but he could say so, which I don\'t; or, what is more probable, he\r\ncould use his knowledge to obtain a hold over you. He is a dangerous\r\nman. Don\'t put yourself in his power."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to, or in anybody\'s."\r\n\r\n"Then avoid scandal instead of courting it, and don\'t repeat the folly\r\nof this afternoon."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt did not remain long in the smoking-room. He had only a\r\nslight acquaintance with Hugh, which did not appear capable of\r\nexpansion. Captain Pratt made a few efforts, proved its inelastic\r\nproperties, and presently lounged out again.\r\n\r\nHugh moved slowly to the window, and leaned his throbbing forehead\r\nagainst the stone mullion. He was still weak, and the encounter with\r\nLady Newhaven had shaken him.\r\n\r\n"What did he mean?" he said to himself, bewildered and suspicious.\r\n"\'Perhaps I should be staying at Westhope later on!\' But, of course, I\r\nshall never go there again. He knows that as well as I do. What did he\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     The Bird of Time has but a little way\r\n     To flutter--and the Bird is on the wing.\r\n                               --OMAR KHAYY\xc1M.\r\n\r\nIt was the third week of November. Winter, the destroyer, was late, but\r\nhe had come at last. There was death in the air, a whisper of death\r\nstole across the empty fields and bare hill-side. The birds heard it and\r\nwere silent. The November wind was hurrying round Westhope Abbey,\r\nshaking its bare trees.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven stood looking fixedly out eastward across the level land\r\nto the low hills beyond. He stood so long that the day died, and\r\ntwilight began to rub out first the hills and then the long, white lines\r\nof flooded meadow and blurred pollard willows. Presently the river mist\r\nrose up to meet the coming darkness. In the east, low and lurid, a tawny\r\nmoon crept up the livid sky. She made no moonlight on the gray earth.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven moved away from the window, where he had become a shadow\r\namong the shadows, and sat down in the dark at his writing-table.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned on the electric lamp at his elbow and took a letter\r\nout of his pocket. The circle of shaded light fell on his face as he\r\nread--the thin, grave face, with the steady, inscrutable eyes.\r\n\r\nHe read the letter slowly, evidently not for the first time.\r\n\r\n"If I had not been taken by surprise at the moment I should not have\r\nconsented to the manner in which our differences were settled.\r\nPersonally, I consider the old arrangement, to which you regretfully\r\nalluded at the time"--("pistols for two and coffee for four," I remember\r\nperfectly)--"as preferable, and as you appeared to think so yourself,\r\nwould it not be advisable to resort to it? Believing that the old\r\narrangement will meet your wishes as fully as it does mine, I trust that\r\nyou will entertain this suggestion, and that you will agree to a meeting\r\nwith your own choice of weapons, on any pretext you may choose to name\r\nwithin the next week."\r\n\r\nThe letter ended there. It was unsigned.\r\n\r\n"The time is certainly becoming short," said Lord Newhaven. "He is right\r\nin saying there is only a week left. If it were not for the scandal for\r\nthe boys, and if I thought he would really hold to the compact, I would\r\nmeet him, but _he won\'t_. He flinched when he drew lots. He won\'t. He\r\nhas courage enough to stand up in front of me for two minutes, and take\r\nhis chance, but not to blow his own brains out. No. And if he knew what\r\nis in store for him if he does not, he would not have courage to face\r\nthat either. Nor should I if I were in his shoes, poor devil. The first\r\nsix foot of earth would be good enough for me."\r\n\r\nHe threw the letter with its envelope into the fire and watched it burn.\r\n\r\nThen he took up the gold pen, which his wife had given him, examined the\r\nnib, dipped it very slowly in the ink, and wrote with sudden swiftness.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to remind you that you made no objection at the time to the\r\nmanner of our encounter and my choice of weapons, by means of which\r\npublicity was avoided. The risk was equal. You now, at the last moment,\r\npropose that I should run it a second time, and in a manner to cause\r\ninstant scandal. I must decline to do so, or to reopen the subject,\r\nwhich had received my careful consideration before I decided upon it. I\r\nhave burned your letter, and desire you will burn mine."\r\n\r\n"Poor devil!" said Lord Newhaven, putting the letter, not in the\r\npost-box at his elbow, but in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Loftus and I did him an ill turn when we pulled him out of the water."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe letter took its own time, for it had to avoid possible pitfalls. It\r\nshunned the company of the other Westhope letters, it avoided the\r\nvillage post-office, but after a day\'s delay it was launched, and lay\r\namong a hundred others in a station pillar-box. And then it hurried,\r\nhurried as fast as express train could take it, till it reached its\r\nLondon address, and went softly up-stairs, and laid itself, with a few\r\nothers, on Hugh\'s breakfast-table.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks since his visit at Wilderleigh Hugh had been like a man\r\nin a boat without oars, drifting slowly, imperceptibly on the placid\r\ncurrent of a mighty river, who far away hears the fall of Niagara\r\ndroning like a bumblebee in a lily cup.\r\n\r\nLong ago, in the summer, he had recognized the sound, had realized the\r\nsteep agony towards which the current was bearing him, and had struggled\r\nhorribly, impotently, against the inevitable. But of late, though the\r\nsound was ever in his ears, welling up out of the blue distance, he had\r\ngiven up the useless struggle, and lay still in the sunshine watching\r\nthe summer woods slide past and the clouds sail away, always away and\r\naway, to the birthplace of the river, to that little fluttering pulse in\r\nthe heart of the hills which a woman\'s hand might cover, the infant\r\npulse of the great river to be.\r\n\r\nHugh\'s thoughts went back, like the clouds, towards that tiny spring of\r\npassion in his own life. He felt that he could have forgiven it--and\r\nhimself--if he had been swept into the vortex of a headlong mountain\r\ntorrent leaping down its own wild water-way, carrying all before it.\r\nOther men he had seen who had been wrested off their feet, swept out of\r\ntheir own keeping by such a torrent on the steep hill-side of their\r\nyouth. But it had not been so with him. He had walked more cautiously\r\nthan they. As he walked he had stopped to look at the little thread of\r\nwater which came bubbling up out of its white pebbles. It was so\r\npretty, it was so feeble, it was so clear. Involuntarily he followed it,\r\nwatched it grow, amused himself, half contemptuously, with it, helped\r\nits course by turning obstacles from its path. It never rushed. It never\r\nleaped. It was a toy. The day came when it spread itself safe and\r\nshallow on level land, and he embarked upon it. But he was quickly tired\r\nof it. It was beginning to run muddily through a commonplace country,\r\npast squalid polluting towns and villages. The hills were long since\r\ngone. He turned to row to the shore. And, behold, his oars were gone! He\r\nhad been trapped to his destruction.\r\n\r\nHugh had never regarded seriously his intrigue with Lady Newhaven. He\r\nhad been attracted, excited, partially, half-willingly enslaved. He had\r\nthought at the time that he loved her, and that supposition had\r\nconfirmed him in his cheap cynicism about woman. This, then, was her\r\npaltry little court, where man offered mock homage, and where she played\r\nat being queen. Hugh had made the discovery that love was a much\r\noverrated passion. He had always supposed so; but when he tired of Lady\r\nNewhaven he was sure of it. His experience was, after all, only the same\r\nas that which many men acquire by marriage, and hold unshaken through\r\nlong and useful lives. But Hugh had not been able to keep the treasures\r\nof this early experience. It had been rendered worthless, perhaps rather\r\ncontemptible by a later one--that of falling in love with Rachel, and\r\nthe astonishing discovery that he was in love for the first time. He had\r\nsold his birthright for a mess of red pottage, as surely as any man or\r\nwoman who marries for money or liking. He had not believed in his\r\nbirthright, and holding it to be worthless, had given it to the first\r\nperson who had offered him anything in exchange.\r\n\r\nHis whole soul had gradually hardened itself against Lady Newhaven. If\r\nhe had loved her, he said to himself, he could have borne his fate. But\r\nthe play had not been worth the candle. His position was damnable; but\r\nthat he could have borne--at least, so he thought if he had had his\r\nday. But he had not had it. That thought rankled. To be hounded out of\r\nlife because he had mistaken paper money for real was not only unfair,\r\nit was grotesque.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, Hugh forgot his smouldering hate of Lady Newhaven,\r\nhis sense of injustice and anger against fate; he forgot everything in\r\nhis love for Rachel. It became the only reality of his life.\r\n\r\nHe had remained in London throughout October and November, cancelling\r\nall his engagements because she was there. What her work was he vaguely\r\napprehended: that she was spending herself and part of her colossal\r\nfortune in the East End, but he took no interest in it. He was incapable\r\nof taking more interests into his life at this time. He passed many\r\nquiet evenings with her in the house in Park Lane, which she had lately\r\nbought. The little secretary who lived with her had always a faint smile\r\nand more writing to do than usual on the evenings when he dined with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA great peace was over all their intercourse. Perhaps it was the hush\r\nbefore the storm, the shadow of which was falling, falling, with each\r\nsucceeding day across the minds of both. Once only a sudden gust of\r\nemotion stirred the quiet air, but it dropped again immediately. It came\r\nwith the hour when Hugh confessed to her the blot upon his past. The\r\npast was taking upon itself ever an uglier and more repulsive aspect as\r\nhe saw more of Rachel. It was hard to put into words, but he spoke of\r\nit. The spectre of love rose like a ghost between them, as they looked\r\nearnestly at each other, each pale even in the ruddy fire-light.\r\n\r\nHugh was truthful in intention. He was determined he would never lie to\r\nRachel. He implied an intrigue with a married woman, a deviation not\r\nonly from morality, but from honor. More he did not say. But as he\r\nlooked at her strained face it seemed to him that she expected something\r\nmore. A dreadful silence fell between them when he had finished. Had\r\nshe then no word for him. Her eyes--mute, imploring, dark with an agony\r\nof suspense--met his for a second and fell instantly. She did not speak.\r\nHer silence filled him with despair. He got up. "It\'s getting late. I\r\nmust go," he stammered.\r\n\r\nShe rose, mechanically, and put out her hand.\r\n\r\n"May I come again?" he said, holding it more tightly than he knew, and\r\nlooking intently at her. Was he going to be dismissed?\r\n\r\nThe pain he caused her hand recalled her to herself. A look of\r\nbewilderment crossed her face, and then she realized his suspense and\r\nsaid, gravely, "You may come again."\r\n\r\nHe kissed the hand he held, and, as he did so, he knew for the first\r\ntime that she loved him. But he could not speak of love after what he\r\nhad just told her. He looked back when he reached the door, and saw her\r\nstanding where he had left her. She had raised the hand he had kissed to\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nThat was three days ago. Since then he had not dared to go and see her.\r\nHe could not ask her to marry him when he was within a few days of the\r\ntime when he was bound in so-called honor to give Lord Newhaven\r\nsatisfaction. He certainly could not be in her presence again without\r\nasking her. The shadows of the last weeks had suddenly become ghastly\r\nrealities once more. The roar of Niagara drowned all other sounds. What\r\nwas he going to do? What was he going to do in the predicament towards\r\nwhich he had been drifting so long, which was now actually upon him? Who\r\nshall say what horror, what agony of mind, what frenzied searching for a\r\nway of escape, what anguish of baffled love crowded in on Hugh\'s mind\r\nduring those last days? At the last moment he caught at a straw, and\r\nwrote to Lord Newhaven offering to fight him. He did not ask himself\r\nwhat he should do if Lord Newhaven refused. But when Lord Newhaven did\r\nrefuse his determination, long unconsciously fostered, sprang full-grown\r\ninto existence in a sudden access of passionate anger and blind rage.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t fight, won\'t he! He thinks I will die like a rat in a trap\r\nwith all my life before me. I will not. I offered him a fair chance of\r\nrevenging himself--I would have fired into the air--and if he won\'t take\r\nit is his own look-out, damn him! He can shoot me at sight if he likes.\r\nLet him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n              On ne peut jamais dire.\r\n     "Fontaine je ne boirai jamais de ton eau."\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we could choose our ills we should not choose suspense. Rachel aged\r\nperceptibly during these last weeks. Her strong white hands became\r\nthinner; her lustreless eyes and haggard face betrayed her. In years\r\ngone by she had said to herself, when a human love had failed her, "I\r\nwill never put myself through this torture a second time. Whatever\r\nhappens I will not endure it again."\r\n\r\nAnd now she was enduring it again, though in a different form. There is\r\nan element of mother-love in the devotion which some women give to men.\r\nIn the first instance it had opened the door of Rachel\'s heart to Hugh,\r\nand had gradually merged, with other feelings, and deepened into the\r\npainful love of a woman not in her first youth for a man of whom she is\r\nnot sure.\r\n\r\nRachel was not sure of Hugh. Of his love for her she was sure, but not\r\nof the man himself, the gentle, refined, lovable nature that mutely\r\nworshipped and clung to her. She could not repulse him any more than she\r\ncould repulse a child. But through all her knowledge of him--the\r\nknowledge of love, the only true knowledge of our fellow-creatures--a\r\nthread of doubtful anxiety was interwoven. She could form some idea how\r\nmen like Dick, Lord Newhaven, or the Bishop would act in given\r\ncircumstances, but she could form no definite idea how Hugh would act in\r\nthe same circumstances. Yet she knew Hugh a thousand times better than\r\nany of the others. Why was this? Many women before Rachel have sought\r\ndiligently to find, and have shut their eyes diligently, lest they\r\nshould discover what it is that is dark to them in the character of the\r\nman they love.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Rachel half knew all the time the subtle inequality in Hugh\'s\r\ncharacter. Perhaps she loved him all the better for it. Perhaps she knew\r\nthat if he had been without a certain undefinable weakness he would not\r\nhave been drawn towards her strength. She was stronger than he, and\r\nperhaps she loved him more than she could have loved an equal.\r\n\r\n"_Les esprits faibles ne sont jamais sinc\xe8res_." She had come across\r\nthat sentence one day in a book she was reading, and had turned suddenly\r\nblind and cold with anger. "He is sincere," she said, fiercely, as if\r\nrepelling an accusation. "He would never deceive me." But no one had\r\naccused Hugh.\r\n\r\nThe same evening he made the confession for which she had waited so\r\nlong. As he began to speak an intolerable suspense, like a new and acute\r\nform of a familiar disease, lay hold on her. Was he going to live or\r\ndie. She should know at last. Was she to part with him, to bury love for\r\nthe second time? Or was she to keep him, to be his wife, the mother of\r\nhis children?\r\n\r\nAs he went on, his language becoming more confused; she hardly listened\r\nto him. She had known all that too long. She had forgiven it, not\r\nwithout tears; but still, she had forgiven it long ago. Then he stopped.\r\nIt seemed to Rachel as if she had reached a moment in life which she\r\ncould not bear. She waited, but still he did not speak. Then she was not\r\nto know. She was to be ground between the millstones of four more\r\ndreadful days and nights. She suddenly became aware, as she stared at\r\nHugh\'s blanching face, that he believed she was about to dismiss him.\r\nThe thought had never entered her mind.\r\n\r\n"Do you not know that I love you?" she said, silently, to him, as he\r\nkissed her hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he had left her a gleam of comfort came to her, the only gleam that\r\nlightened the days and nights that followed. It was not his fault if he\r\nhad made a half-confession. If he had gone on, and had told her of the\r\ndrawing of lots, and which had drawn the fatal lot, he would have been\r\nwanting in sense of honor. He owed it to the man he had injured to\r\npreserve entire secrecy.\r\n\r\n"He told me of the sin which might affect my marrying him," said Rachel,\r\n"but the rest had nothing to do with me. He was right not to speak of\r\nit. If he had told me, and then a few days afterwards Lord Newhaven had\r\ncommitted suicide, he would know I should put two and two together, and\r\nwho the woman was, and the secret would not have died with Lord Newhaven\r\nas it ought to do. But if Hugh were the man who had to kill himself, he\r\nmight have told me so without a breach of confidence, because then I\r\nshould never have guessed who the others were. If he were the man he\r\ncould have told me, he certainly _would_ have told me, for it could have\r\ndone no harm to any one. Surely Lady Newhaven must be right when she was\r\nso certain that her husband had drawn the short lighter. And she herself\r\nhad gained the same impression from what Hugh had vaguely said at\r\nWilderleigh. But what are impressions, suppositions, except the food of\r\nsuspense." Rachel sighed, and took up her burden as best she could.\r\nHugh\'s confession had at least one source of comfort in it, deadly cold\r\ncomfort if he were about to leave her. She knew that night as she lay\r\nawake that she had not quite trusted him up till now, by the sense of\r\nentire trust and faith in him which rose up to meet his self-accusation.\r\nWhat might have turned away Rachel\'s heart from him had had the opposite\r\neffect. "He told me the worst of himself, though he risked losing me by\r\ndoing it. He wished me to know before he asked me to marry him. Though\r\nhe acted dishonorably once he is an honorable man. He has shown himself\r\nupright in his dealing with me."\r\n\r\nHugh came back no more after that evening. Rachel told herself she knew\r\nwhy--she understood. He could not speak of love and marriage when the\r\nman he had injured was on the brink of death. Her heart stood still\r\nwhen she thought of Lord Newhaven, the gentle, kindly man who was almost\r\nher friend, and who was playing with such quiet dignity a losing game.\r\nHugh had taken from him his wife, and by that act was now taking from\r\nhim his life too.\r\n\r\n"It was an even chance," she groaned. "Hugh is not responsible for his\r\ndeath. Oh, my God! At least he is not responsible for that. It might\r\nhave been he who had to die instead of Lord Newhaven. But if it _is_ he,\r\nsurely he could not leave me without a word. If it _is_ he, he would\r\nhave come to bid me good-bye. He cannot go down into silence without a\r\nword. If it _is_ he, he will come yet."\r\n\r\nShe endured through the two remaining days, turning faint with terror\r\neach time the door-bell rang, lest it might be Hugh.\r\n\r\nBut Hugh did not come.\r\n\r\nThen, after repeated frantic telegrams from Lady Newhaven, she left\r\nLondon precipitately to go to her, as she had promised, on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of November, the evening of the last day of the five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n     "And he went out immediately, and it was night."\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark when Rachel reached Westhope Abbey. A great peace\r\nseemed to pervade the long, dim lines of the gardens, and to be gathered\r\ninto the solemn arches of the ruins against the darkening sky. Through\r\nthe low door-way a faint light of welcome peered. As she drove up she\r\nwas aware of two tall figures pacing amicably together in the dusk. As\r\nshe passed them she heard Lord Newhaven\'s low laugh at something his\r\ncompanion said.\r\n\r\nA sense of unreality seized her. It was not the world which was out of\r\njoint, which was rushing to its destruction. It must be she who was\r\nmad--stark mad--to have believed these chimeras.\r\n\r\nAs she got out of the carriage a step came lightly along the gravel, and\r\nLord Newhaven emerged into the little ring of light by the archway.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you to come," he said, cordially, with extended\r\nhand. "My poor wife is very unwell, and expecting you anxiously. She\r\ntold me she had sent for you."\r\n\r\nAll was unreal--the familiar rooms and passages, the flickering light of\r\nthe wood fire in the drawing-room, the darkened room, into which Rachel\r\nstole softly and knelt down beside a trembling white figure, which held\r\nher with a drowning clutch.\r\n\r\n"I will be in the drawing-room after dinner," Lady Newhaven whispered,\r\nhoarsely. "I won\'t dine down. I can\'t bear to see him."\r\n\r\nIt was all unreal, except the jealousy which suddenly took Rachel by the\r\nthroat and nearly choked her.\r\n\r\n"I have undertaken what is beyond my strength," she said to herself, as\r\nshe hastily dressed for dinner. "How shall I bear it when she speaks of\r\nhim? How shall I go through with it?"\r\n\r\nPresently she was dining alone with Lord Newhaven. He mentioned that it\r\nwas Dick Vernon with whom he had been walking when she arrived. Dick was\r\nstaying in Southminster for business, combined with hunting, and had\r\nridden over. Lord Newhaven looked furtively at Rachel as he mentioned\r\nDick. Her indifference was evidently genuine.\r\n\r\n"She has not grown thin and parted with what little looks she possessed\r\non Dick\'s account," he said to himself; and the remembrance slipped\r\nacross his mind of Hugh\'s first word when he recovered consciousness\r\nafter drowning--"Rachel."\r\n\r\n"I would have asked Dick to dine," continued Lord Newhaven, when the\r\nservants had gone, "but I thought two was company and three none, and\r\nthat it was not fair on you and Violet to have him on your hands, as I\r\nam obliged to go to London on business by the night express."\r\n\r\nHe was amazed at the instantaneous effect of his words.\r\n\r\nRachel\'s face became suddenly livid, and she sank back in her chair. He\r\nsaw that it was only by a supreme effort that she prevented herself from\r\nfainting. The truth flashed into his mind.\r\n\r\n"She knows," he said to himself. "That imbecile, that brainless viper to\r\nwhom I am tied, has actually confided in her. And she and Scarlett are\r\nin love with each other, and the suspense is wearing her out."\r\n\r\nHe looked studiously away from her, and continued a desultory\r\nconversation; but his face darkened.\r\n\r\nThe little boys came in, and pressed themselves one on each side of\r\ntheir father, their eyes glued on the crystallized cherries. Rachel had\r\nrecovered herself, and she watched the children and their father with a\r\npain at her heart, which was worse than the faintness.\r\n\r\nShe had been unable to believe that if Lord Newhaven had drawn the short\r\nlighter he would remain quietly here over the dreadful morrow, under the\r\nsame roof as Teddy and Pauly. Oh, surely nothing horrible could happen\r\nso near them! Yet he seemed to have no intention of leaving Westhope.\r\nThen, perhaps, he had not drawn the short lighter, after all. At the\r\nmoment when suspense, momentarily lulled, was once more rising hideous,\r\ncolossal, he casually mentioned that he was leaving by the night train.\r\nThe reason was obvious. The shock of relief almost stunned her.\r\n\r\n"He will do it quietly to-morrow away from home," she said to herself,\r\nwatching him with miserable eyes, as he divided the cherries equally\r\nbetween the boys. She had dreaded going up-stairs to Lady Newhaven, but\r\nanything was better than remaining in the dining-room. She rose\r\nhurriedly, and the boys raced to the door and struggled which should\r\nopen it for her.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven was lying on a sofa by the wood fire in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nRachel went straight up to her, and said, hoarsely:\r\n\r\n"Lord Newhaven tells me he is going to London this evening by the night\r\nexpress."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven threw up her arms.\r\n\r\n"Then it is he," she said. "When he stayed on and on up to to-day I\r\nbegan to be afraid that it was not he, after all; and yet little things\r\nmade me feel sure it was, and that he was only waiting to do it before\r\nme and the children. I have been so horribly frightened. Oh, if he might\r\nonly go away, and that I might never, never look upon his face again!"\r\n\r\nRachel sat down by the latticed window and looked out into the darkness.\r\nShe could not bear to look at Lady Newhaven. Was there any help anywhere\r\nfrom this horror of death without, from this demon of jealousy within?\r\n\r\n"I am her only friend," she said to herself, over and over again. "I\r\ncannot bear it, and I must bear it. I cannot desert her now. She has no\r\none to turn to but me."\r\n\r\n"Rachel, where are you?" said the feeble, plaintive voice.\r\n\r\nRachel rose and went unsteadily towards her. It was fortunate the room\r\nwas lit only by the fire-light.\r\n\r\n"Sit down by me here on the sofa, and let me lean against you. You do\r\ncomfort me, Rachel, though you say nothing. You are the only true friend\r\nI have in the world, the only woman who really loves me. Your cheek is\r\nquite wet, and you are actually trembling. You always feel for me. I can\r\nbear it now you are here, and he is going away."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the boys had been reluctantly coerced to bed, Lord Newhaven rang\r\nfor his valet, told him what to pack, that he should not want him to\r\naccompany him, and then went to his sitting-room on the ground-floor.\r\n\r\n"Scarlett seems a fortunate person," he said, pacing up and down. "That\r\nwoman loves him, and if she marries him she will reform him. Is he going\r\nto escape altogether in this world and the next--if there is a next? Is\r\nthere no justice anywhere? Perhaps at this moment he is thinking that he\r\nhas salved his conscience by offering to fight, and that, after all, I\r\ncan\'t do anything to prevent his living and marrying her if he chooses.\r\nHe knows well enough I shall not touch him, or sue for a divorce, for\r\nfear of the scandal. He thinks he has me there. And he is right. But he\r\nis mistaken if he thinks I can do nothing. I may as well go up to London\r\nand see for myself whether he is still on his feet to-morrow night. It\r\nis a mere formality, but I will do it. I might have guessed that she\r\nwould try to smirch her own name, and the boys through her, if she had\r\nthe chance. She will defeat me yet, unless I am careful. Oh, ye gods!\r\nwhy did I marry a fool who does not even know her own interests? If I\r\nhad life over again I would marry a Becky Sharp, any she-devil\r\nincarnate, if only she had brains. One cannot circumvent a fool,\r\nbecause one can\'t foresee their line of action. But Miss West, for a\r\nmiracle, is safe. She has a lock-and-key face. But she is not for\r\nScarlett. Did Scarlett tell her himself in an access of moral\r\nspring-cleaning preparatory to matrimony? No. He may have told her that\r\nhe had got into trouble with some woman, but not about the drawing of\r\nlots. Whatever his faults are, he has the instincts of a gentleman, and\r\nhis mouth is shut. I can trust him like myself there. But she is not for\r\nhim. He may think he will marry her, but I draw the line there. Violet\r\nand I have other views for him. He can live, if he wants to, and\r\napparently he does want to, though whether he will continue to want to\r\nis another question. But he shall not have Rachel. She must marry Dick."\r\n\r\nA distant rumbling was heard of the carriage driving under the stable\r\narchway on its way to the front-door.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven picked up a novel with a mark in it, and left the room. In\r\nthe passage he stopped a moment at the foot of the narrow black oak\r\nstaircase to the nurseries, which had once been his own nurseries. All\r\nwas very silent. He listened, hesitated; his foot on the lowest stair.\r\nThe butler came round the corner to announce the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I shall be back in four days at furthest," Lord Newhaven said to him,\r\nand turning, went on quickly to the hall, where the piercing night air\r\ncame in with the stamping of the impatient horses\' hoofs.\r\n\r\nA minute later the two listening women up-stairs heard the carriage\r\ndrive away into the darkness, and a great silence settled down upon the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n     "The fool saith, Who would have thought it?"\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter had brought trouble with it to Warpington Vicarage. A new baby\r\nhad arrived, and the old baby was learning, not in silence, what kings\r\nand ministers undergo when they are deposed. Hester had never greatly\r\ncared for the old baby. She was secretly afraid of it. But in its hour\r\nof adversity she took to it, and she and Regie spent many hours\r\nconsoling it for the arrival of the little chrysalis up-stairs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley recovered slowly, and before she was down-stairs again\r\nRegie sickened with one of those swift, sudden illnesses of childhood,\r\nwhich make childless women thank God for denying them their prayers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley was not well enough to be told, and for many days Mr.\r\nGresley and Hester and Doctor Brown held Regie forcibly back from the\r\nvalley of the shadow, where, since the first cradle was rocked, the soft\r\nfeet of children have cleft so sharp an entrance over the mother-hearts\r\nthat vainly barred the way.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley\'s face grew as thin as Hester\'s as the days went by. On his\r\nrounds--for he let nothing interfere with his work--heavy farmers in\r\ndog-carts, who opposed him at vestry meetings, stopped to ask after\r\nRegie. The most sullen of his parishioners touched their hats to him as\r\nhe passed, and mothers of families, who never could be induced to leave\r\ntheir cooking to attend morning service, and were deeply offended at\r\nbeing called "after-dinner Christians" in consequence, forgot the\r\nopprobrious term, and brought little offerings of new-laid eggs and rosy\r\napples to tempt "the little master."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was touched, grateful.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I have always done them justice," he actually said to\r\nHester one day. "They do seem to understand me a little better at last.\r\nWalsh has never spoken to me since my sermon on Dissent, though I always\r\nmake a point of being friendly to him, but to-day he stopped, and said\r\nhe knew what trouble was, and how he had lost"--Mr. Gresley\'s voice\r\nfaltered, "it is a long time ago--but how, when he was about my age, he\r\nlost his eldest boy, and how he always remembered Regie in his prayers,\r\nand I must keep up a good heart. We shook hands," said Mr. Gresley. "I\r\nsometimes think Walsh means well, and that he may be a good-hearted man,\r\nafter all."\r\n\r\nBeneath the arrogance which a belief in Apostolic succession seems to\r\ninduce in natures like Mr. Gresley\'s, as mountain air induces asthma in\r\ncertain lungs, the shaft of agonized anxiety had pierced to a thin layer\r\nof humility. Hester knew that that layer was only momentarily disturbed,\r\nand that the old self would infallibly reassert itself; but the\r\nmomentary glimpse drew her heart towards her brother. He was conscious\r\nof it, and love almost grew between them as they watched by Regie\'s bed.\r\n\r\nAt last, after an endless night, the little faltering feet came to the\r\ndividing of the ways, and hesitated. The dawn fell gray on the watchful\r\nfaces of the doctor and Hester, and on the dumb suspense of the poor\r\nfather. And with a sigh, as one who half knows he is making a life-long\r\nmistake, Regie settled himself against Hester\'s shoulder and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. The light grew strong, and still Regie slept. Doctor\r\nBrown put cushions behind Hester, and gave her food. He looked anxiously\r\nat her. "Can you manage?" he whispered later, when the sun was streaming\r\nin at the nursery window. And she smiled back in scorn. Could she\r\nmanage? What did he take her for?\r\n\r\nAt last Regie stretched himself and opened his eyes. The doctor took\r\nhim gently from Hester, gave him food, and laid him down.\r\n\r\n"He is all right," he said. "He will sleep all day."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley, who had hardly stirred, hid his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to move, Miss Hester," said Doctor Brown, gently.\r\n\r\nHester did not try. She could not. Her hands and face were rigid. She\r\nlooked at him in terror. "I shall have to scream in another moment," she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nThe old doctor picked her up, and carried her swiftly to her room, where\r\nFr\xe4ulein ministered to her.\r\n\r\nAt last he came down and found Mr. Gresley waiting for him at the foot\r\nof the stair.\r\n\r\n"You are sure he is all right?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Sure. Fr\xe4ulein is with, him. He got the turn at dawn."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I should say thank your sister, too. She saved him. I tell you,\r\nGresley, neither you nor I could have sat all those hours without\r\nstirring, as she did. She had cramp after the first hour. She has a will\r\nof iron in that weak body of hers."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea she was uncomfortable," said Mr. Gresley, half\r\nincredulous.\r\n\r\n"That is one of the reasons why I always say you ought not to be a\r\nclergyman," snapped the little doctor, and was gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was not offended. He was too overwhelmed with thankfulness\r\nto be piqued.\r\n\r\n"Good old Brown," he said, indulgently. "He has been up all night, and\r\nhe is so tired he does not know he is talking nonsense. As if a man who\r\ndid not understand cramp was not qualified to be a priest. Ha! ha! He\r\nalways likes to have a little hit at me, and he is welcome to it. I must\r\njust creep up and kiss dear Hester. I never should have thought she had\r\nit in her to care for any one as she has shown she cares for Regie. I\r\nshall tell her so, and how surprised I am, and how I love her for it.\r\nShe has always seemed so insensible, so callous. But, please God! this\r\nis the beginning of a new life for her. If it is, she shall never hear\r\none word of reproach about the past from me."\r\n\r\nA day or two later the Bishop of Southminster had a touch of rheumatism,\r\nand Doctor Brown attended him. This momentary malady may possibly\r\naccount to the reader for an incident which remained to the end of life\r\ninexplicable to Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Regie had taken the turn towards health, and on the\r\nafternoon of the very same day when Doctor Brown had interviewed the\r\nBishop\'s rheumatism, the episcopal carriage might have been seen\r\nsqueezing its august proportions into the narrow drive of Warpington\r\nVicarage; at least, it was always called the drive, though the horses\'\r\nnoses were reflected in the glass of the front-door while the\r\nhind-wheels still jarred the gate-posts.\r\n\r\nOut of the carriage stepped, not the Bishop, but the tall figure of Dick\r\nVernon, who rang the bell, and then examined a crack in the portico.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time to do so.\r\n\r\n"Lord, what fools!" he said, half aloud. "The crazy thing is shouting\r\nout that it is going to drop on their heads, and they put a clamp across\r\nthe crack. Might as well put a respirator on a South Sea Islander. Is\r\nMr. Gresley in? Well, then, just ask him to step this way, will you?\r\nLook here, James, if you want to be had up for manslaughter, you leave\r\nthis porch as it is. No, I did not drive over from Southminster on\r\npurpose to tell you; but I mention it now I am here."\r\n\r\n"I added the portico myself when I came here," said Mr. Gresley,\r\nstiffly, who had not forgotten or forgiven the enormity of Dick\'s\r\nbehavior at the temperance meeting.\r\n\r\n"So I should have thought," said Dick, warming to the subject, and\r\nmounting on a small garden-chair. "And some escaped lunatic has put a\r\nclamp on the stucco."\r\n\r\n"I placed the clamp myself," replied Mr. Gresley. "There really is no\r\nnecessity for you to waste your time and mine here. I understand the\r\nportico perfectly. The crack is merely superficial."\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Dick. "Then why does it run round those two consumptive\r\nlittle pillars? I tell you it\'s tired of standing up. It\'s going to sit\r\ndown. Look here"--Dick tore at the stucco with his knife, and caught the\r\nclamp as it fell--"that clamp was only put in the stucco. It never\r\nreached the stone or the wood, whichever the little kennel is made of.\r\nYou ought to be thankful it did not drop on one of the children, or on\r\nyour own head. It would have knocked all the texts out of it for some\r\ntime to come."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley did not look very grateful as he led the way to his study.\r\n\r\n"I was lunching with the Bishop to-day," said Dick, "and Dr. Brown was\r\nthere. He told us about the trouble here. He said the little chap Regie\r\nwas going on like a house on fire. The Bishop told me to ask after him\r\nparticularly."\r\n\r\n"He is wonderfully better every day," said Mr. Gresley, softening. "How\r\nkind of the Bishop to send you to inquire. Not having children himself,\r\nI should never have thought--"\r\n\r\n"No," said Dick, "you wouldn\'t. Do you remember when we were at Cheam,\r\nand Ogilvy\'s marked sovereign was found in the pocket of my flannel\r\ntrousers. You were the only one of the boys, you and that sneak Field,\r\nwho was not sure I might not have taken it. You said it looked awfully\r\nbad, and so it did."\r\n\r\n"No one was gladder than I was when it was cleared up," said Mr.\r\nGresley.\r\n\r\n"No," said Dick; "but we don\'t care much what any one thinks when it\'s\r\ncleared up. It\'s before that matters. Is Hester in? I\'ve two notes for\r\nher. One from Brown, and one from the Bishop, and my orders are to take\r\nher back with me. That is why the Bishop sent the carriage."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Hester will hardly care to leave us at present," said Mr.\r\nGresley. "My wife is on her sofa, and Regie is still very weak. He has\r\ntaken one of those unaccountable fancies of children for her, and can\r\nhardly bear her out of his sight."\r\n\r\n"The Bishop has taken another of those unaccountable fancies for her,"\r\nsaid Dick, looking full at Mr. Gresley in an unpleasant manner. "I\'m not\r\none that holds that parsons should have their own way in everything.\r\nI\'ve seen too much of missionaries. I just shove out curates and vicars\r\nand all that small fry if they get in my way. But when they break out in\r\nbuttons and gaiters, by Jove! I knock under to them--at least, I do to\r\nmen like the Bishop. He knows a thing or two. He has told me not to come\r\nback without Hester, and I\'m not going to. Ah! there she is in the\r\ngarden." Dick\'s large back had been turned towards the window, but he\r\nhad seen the reflection of a passing figure in the glass of a framed\r\ntestimonial which occupied a prominent place on the study wall, and he\r\nat once marched out into the garden and presented the letters to Hester.\r\n\r\nHester was bewildered at the thought of leaving Warpington, into which\r\nshe seemed to have grown like a Buddhist into his tree. She was\r\nreluctant, would think it over, etc. But Dick, after one glance at her\r\nstrained face, was obdurate. He would hear no reason. He would not go\r\naway. She and Fr\xe4ulein nervously cast a few clothes into a box, Fr\xe4ulein\r\nso excited by the apparition of a young man, and a possible love affair,\r\nthat she could hardly fold Hester\'s tea-gowns.\r\n\r\nWhen Hester came down with her hat on she found Dick untiring Mr.\r\nGresley\'s bicycle in the most friendly manner, while the outraged owner\r\nstood by remonstrating.\r\n\r\n"I assure you, Dick, I don\'t wish it to be touched. I know my own\r\nmachine. If it were a common puncture I could mend it myself, but I\r\ndon\'t want the whole thing ruined by an ignorant person. I shall take it\r\nin to Southminster on the first opportunity."\r\n\r\n"No need to do that," said Dick, cheerfully. "Might as well go to a\r\ndoctor to have your nails cut. Do it at home. You don\'t believe in the\r\nwater test? Oh! that\'s rot. You\'ll believe in it when you see it. You\'re\r\nlearning it now. There! Now I\'ve got it in the pail; see all these\r\nblooming little bubbles jostling up in a row. There\'s a leak at the\r\nvalve. No, there isn\'t. It\'s only unscrewed. Good Lord, James! it\'s only\r\nunscrewed; and you thought the whole machine was out of order. There,\r\nnow, I\'ve screwed it up. Devil a bubble! What\'s that you\'re saying about\r\nswearing in your presence? Oh! don\'t apologize! You can\'t help being a\r\nclergyman. Look for yourself. You will never learn if you look the other\r\nway just when a good-natured chap is showing you. I would have put the\r\ntire on again, but as you say you can do it better yourself, I won\'t.\r\nSorry to keep you waiting, Hester. And look here, James, you ought to\r\nbicycle more. Strengthen your legs for playing the harmonium on Sundays.\r\nWell, I could not tell you had an organ in that little one-horse church.\r\nGood-bye, Fr\xe4ulein; good-bye, James. Home, Coleman. And look here," said\r\nDick, putting his mischievous face out of the window as the carriage\r\nturned, "if you are getting up steam for another temperance meeting, I\'m\r\nyour man."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, dear James," interrupted Hester, hastily, and the carriage\r\ndrove away.\r\n\r\n"He looks pasty," said Dick, after an interval. "A chap like James has\r\nno power in his arms and legs. He can kneel down in church, and put his\r\narm round Mrs. Gresley\'s waist, but that\'s about all he\'s up to. He\r\ndoesn\'t take enough exercise."\r\n\r\n"He is not well. I don\'t think I ought to have left them."\r\n\r\n"You had no choice. Brown said, unless you could be got away at once you\r\nwould be laid up. I was at luncheon at the Palace when he said it. The\r\nBishop\'s sister was too busy with her good works to come herself, so I\r\ncame instead. I said I should not come back alive without you. They\r\nseemed to think I should all the same, but, of course, that was absurd.\r\nI wanted the Bishop to bet upon it, but he wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Do you always get what you want?" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Generally, if it depends on myself. But sometimes things depend on\r\nothers besides me. Then I may be beaten."\r\n\r\nThey were passing Westhope Abbey, wrapped in a glory of sunset and mist.\r\n\r\n"Did you know Miss West was there?" Dick said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"No," said Hester, surprised. "I thought she was in London."\r\n\r\n"She came down last night to be with Lady Newhaven who is not well. Miss\r\nWest is a great friend of yours, isn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, she has one fault, and it is one I can\'t put up with. She won\'t\r\nlook at me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t put up with it," said Hester, softly. "We women all have our\r\nfaults, dear Dick. But if men point them out to us in a nice way we can\r\nsometimes cure them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n     When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?\r\n                                  SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nTwo nights had passed since Lord Newhaven had left the Abbey. And now\r\nthe second day, the first day of December, was waning to its close. How\r\nRachel had lived through them she knew not. The twenty-ninth had been\r\nthe appointed day. Both women had endured till then, feeling that that\r\nday would make an end. Neither had contemplated the possibility of\r\nhearing nothing for two days more. Long afterwards, in quiet years,\r\nRachel tried to recall those two days and nights. But memory only gave\r\nlurid glimpses, as of lightning across darkness. In one of those\r\nglimpses she recalled that Lady Newhaven had become ill, that the doctor\r\nhad been sent for, that she had been stupefied with narcotics. In\r\nanother she was walking in the desolate frost-nipped gardens, and the\r\ntwo boys were running towards her across the grass.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sank on the afternoon of the second day it peered in at her\r\nsitting alone by her window. Lady Newhaven, after making the whole day\r\nfrightful, was mercifully asleep. Rachel sat looking out into the\r\ndistance beyond the narrow confines of her agony. Has not every man and\r\nwoman who has suffered sat thus by the window, looking out, seeing\r\nnothing, but still gazing blindly out hour after hour?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the quiet mother earth watches us, and whispers to our deaf\r\nears:\r\n\r\n     Warte nur, balde\r\n     Ruhest du auch.\r\n\r\nLittle pulse of life writhing in your shirt of fire, the shirt is but of\r\nclay of your mother\'s weaving, and she will take it from you presently\r\nwhen you lay back your head on her breast.\r\n\r\nThere had been wind all day, a high, dreadful wind, which had\r\naccompanied all the nightmare of the day as a wail accompanies pain. But\r\nnow it had dropped with the sun, who was setting with little pageant\r\nacross the level land. The whole sky, from north to south, from east to\r\nwest, was covered with a wind-threshed floor of thin wan clouds, and\r\nshreds of clouds, through which, as through a veil, the steadfast face\r\nof the heaven beyond looked down.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, from east to west, from north to south, as far as the\r\ntrees and wolds in the dim, forgotten east, the exhausted livid clouds\r\nblushed wave on wave, league on league, red as the heart of a rose. The\r\nwind-whipped earth was still. The trees held their breath. Very black\r\nagainst the glow the carved cross on the adjoining gable stood out. And\r\nin another moment the mighty tide of color went as it had come, swiftly\r\nebbing across its infinite shores of sky. And the waiting night came\r\ndown suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" said Rachel, stretching out her hands to ward off the\r\ndarkness. "Not another night. I cannot bear another night."\r\n\r\nA slow step came along the gravel; it passed below the window and\r\nstopped at the door. Some one knocked. Rachel tore open the throat of\r\nher gown. She was suffocating. Her long-drawn breathing seemed to deaden\r\nall other sounds. Nevertheless she heard it--the faint footfall of some\r\none in the hall, a distant opening and shutting of doors. A vague,\r\nindescribable tremor seemed to run through the house.\r\n\r\nShe stole out of her room and down the passage. At Lady Newhaven\'s door\r\nher French maid was hesitating, her hand on the handle.\r\n\r\nBelow, on the stairs, stood a clergyman and the butler.\r\n\r\n"I am the bearer of sad tidings," said the clergyman. Rachel recognized\r\nhim as the Archdeacon at whom Lord Newhaven had so often laughed.\r\n"Perhaps you would prepare Lady Newhaven before I break them to her."\r\n\r\nThe door was suddenly opened, and Lady Newhaven stood in the doorway.\r\nOne small clinched hand held together the long white dressing-gown,\r\nwhich she had hastily flung round her, while the other was outstretched\r\nagainst the door-post. She swayed as she stood. Morphia and terror\r\nburned in her glassy eyes fixed in agony upon the clergyman. The light\r\nin the hall below struck upward at her colorless face. In later days\r\nthis was the picture which Lady Newhaven recalled to mind as the most\r\nstriking of the whole series.\r\n\r\n"Tell her," said Rachel, sharply.\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon advanced.\r\n\r\n"Prepare yourself, dear Lady Newhaven," he said, sonorously. "Our dear\r\nfriend, Lord Newhaven, has met with a serious accident. Er--the Lord\r\ngave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" whispered Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon bowed his head.\r\n\r\nEvery one except the children heard the scream which rang through the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nRachel put her arms round the tottering, distraught figure, drew it\r\ngently back into the room, and closed the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n     And Nicanor lay dead in his harness.\r\n                            --1 MACABEES, xv. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel laid down the papers which were full of Lord Newhaven\'s death.\r\n\r\n"He has managed it well," she said to herself. "No one could suspect\r\nthat it was not an accident. He has played his losing game to the bitter\r\nend, weighing each move. None of the papers even hint that his death was\r\nnot an accident. He has provided against that."\r\n\r\nThe butler received a note from Lord Newhaven the morning after his\r\ndeath, mentioning the train by which he should return to Westhope that\r\nday, and ordering a carriage to meet him. A great doctor made public the\r\nfact that Lord Newhaven had consulted him the day before about the\r\nattacks of vertigo from which it appeared he had suffered of late. A\r\nsimilar attack seemed to have seized upon him while waiting at Clapham\r\nJunction when the down express thundered past. The few who saw him said\r\nthat, as he was pacing the empty platform, he staggered suddenly as the\r\ntrain was sweeping up behind him, put his hand to his head, and stumbled\r\nover the edge on to the line. Death was instantaneous. Only his wife and\r\none other woman knew that it was premeditated.\r\n\r\n"The only thing I cannot understand about it," said Rachel to herself,\r\n"is why a man, who from first to last could act with such caution, and\r\nwith such deliberate determination, should have been two days late. The\r\ntwenty-ninth of November was the last day of the five months, and he\r\ndied on the afternoon of December the first. Why did he wait two days\r\nafter he left Westhope? I should have thought he would have been the\r\nlast man in the world to overstep the allotted time by so much as an\r\nhour. Yet, nevertheless, he waited two whole days. I don\'t understand\r\nit."\r\n\r\nAfter an interminable interval Lord Newhaven\'s luggage returned, the\r\nfamiliar portmanteau and dressing-bag, and even the novel which he was\r\nreading when he left Westhope, with the mark still in it. All came back.\r\nAnd a coffin came back, too, and was laid before the little altar in the\r\ndisused chapel.\r\n\r\n"I will go and pray for him in the chapel as soon as the lid is fastened\r\ndown," said Lady Newhaven to Rachel, "but I dare not before. I can\'t\r\nbelieve he is really dead. And they say somebody ought to look, just to\r\nverify. I know it is always done. Dear Rachel, would you mind?"\r\n\r\nSo Rachel, familiar with death, as all are who have known poverty or who\r\nhave loved their fellows, went alone into the chapel, and stood a long\r\ntime looking down upon the muffled figure, the garment of flesh which\r\nthe soul had so deliberately rent and flung aside.\r\n\r\nThe face was fixed in a grave attention, as of one who sees that which\r\nhe awaits. The sarcasm, the weariness, the indifference, the impatient\r\npatience, these were gone, these were indeed dead. The sharp, thin face\r\nknew them no more. It looked intently, unflinchingly through its\r\nhalf-closed eyes into the beyond which some call death, which some call\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Forgive him," said Rachel, kneeling beside the coffin. "My friend,\r\nforgive him. He has injured you, I know. And your just revenge--for you\r\nthought it just--has failed to reach him. But the time for vengeance has\r\npassed. The time for forgiveness has come. Forgive my poor Hugh, who\r\nwill never forgive himself. Do you not see now, you who see so much,\r\nthat it was harder for him than for you; that it would have been the\r\neasier part for him if he had been the one to draw death, to have atoned\r\nto you for his sin against you by his death, instead of feeling, as he\r\nalways must, that your stroke failed, and that he has taken your life\r\nfrom you as well as your honor. Forgive him," said Rachel, over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut the unheeding face looked earnestly into the future. It had done\r\nwith the past.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Rachel, "if I who love him can forgive him, cannot you, who\r\nonly hated him, forgive him, too? For love is greater than hate."\r\n\r\nShe covered the face and went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n     Le nombre des \xeatres qui veulent voir vrai est extraordinairement\r\n     petit. Ce qui domineles hommes, c\'est la peur de la v\xe9rit\xe9, \xe0 moins\r\n     que la v\xe9rit\xe9 ne leur soit utile.--AMIEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven insisted on attending the funeral, a little boy in either\r\nhand. Rachel had implored that she would spare the children, knowing how\r\nannoyed their father would have been, but Lady Newhaven was obdurate.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "He may not have cared much about them, but that is no\r\nreason why they should forget he is their father."\r\n\r\nSo Teddy and Pauly stared with round eyes at the crowd, and at the\r\ncoffin, and the wealth of flowers, and the deep grave in which their old\r\nfriend and play-fellow was laid. Perhaps they did not understand. They\r\ndid not cry.\r\n\r\n"They are like their father. They have not much heart," Lady Newhaven\r\nsaid to Rachel.\r\n\r\nDick, who was at the funeral, looked at them, winking his hawk eyes a\r\nlittle, and afterwards he came back boldly to the silent house, and\r\nobtained leave to take them away for the afternoon. He brought them back\r\ntowards bed-time, with a dancing doll he had made for them, and a man\'s\r\nface cut out of cork. They met Rachel and the governess in the garden on\r\ntheir return, and flew to them with their trophies.\r\n\r\nDick waited a moment after the others had gone in.\r\n\r\n"It seems hard on him to have left it all," he said. "His wife and the\r\nlittle chaps, and his nice home and everything."\r\n\r\nRachel could say nothing.\r\n\r\n"He was very fond of the boys," he went on. "He would have done anything\r\nfor them."\r\n\r\n"He did what he could," said Rachel, almost inaudibly, and then added:\r\n"He was very fond of you."\r\n\r\n"He was a good friend," said Dick, his crooked mouth twitching a little,\r\n"and a good enemy. That was why I liked him. He was hard to make a\r\nfriend of or an enemy, but when he once did either he never let go."\r\n\r\nRachel shivered. The frost was settling white upon the grass.\r\n\r\n"I must go in," she said, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Are you staying much longer?" said Dick, keeping it in his.\r\n\r\n"I leave to-morrow morning very early."\r\n\r\n"You will be in London, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I think so for the present."\r\n\r\n"May I come and see you?"\r\n\r\nThe expression of Dick\'s eyes was unmistakable. In the dusk he seemed\r\nall eyes and hands.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Dick, it\'s no use."\r\n\r\n"I like plain speaking," said Dick. "I can\'t think why it\'s considered\r\nsuch a luxury. You are quite right to say that, and I should be quite\r\nwrong if I did not say that I mean to keep on till you are actually\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\nHe released her hand with difficulty. It was too dark to see his face.\r\nShe hesitated a moment, and then fled into the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that after the funeral the strictest etiquette\r\npermits, nay, encourages, certain slight relaxations on the part of the\r\nbereaved.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven lay on the sofa in her morning-room in her long black\r\ndraperies, her small hands folded. They were exquisite, little\r\nblue-veined hands. There were no rings on them except a wedding-ring.\r\nHer maid, who had been living in an atmosphere of pleasurable excitement\r\nsince Lord Newhaven\'s death, glanced with enthusiastic admiration at\r\nher mistress. Lady Newhaven was a fickle, inconsiderate mistress, but at\r\nthis moment her behavior was perfect. She, Ang\xe9lique, knew what her own\r\npart should be, and played it with effusion. She suffered no one to come\r\ninto the room. She, who would never do a hand\'s turn for the English\r\nservants, put on coal with her own hands. She took the lamps from the\r\nfootman at the door. Presently she brought in a little tray with food\r\nand wine, and softly besought "Miladi" to eat. Perhaps the mistress and\r\nmaid understood each other. Lady Newhaven impatiently shook her head,\r\nand Ang\xe9lique wrung her hands. In the end Ang\xe9lique prevailed.\r\n\r\n"Have they all gone?" Lady Newhaven asked, after the little meal was\r\nfinished, and, with much coaxing, she had drunk a glass of champagne.\r\n\r\nAng\xe9lique assured her they were all gone, the relations who had come to\r\nthe funeral--"Milor Windham and l\'Honorable Carson" were the last. They\r\nwere dining with Miss West, and were leaving immediately after dinner by\r\nthe evening express.\r\n\r\n"Ask Miss West to come to me as soon as they have gone," she said.\r\n\r\nAng\xe9lique hung about the room, and was finally dismissed.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven lay quite still, watching the fire. A great peace had\r\ndescended upon that much-tossed soul. The dreadful restlessness of the\r\nlast weeks was gone. The long suspense, prolonged beyond its time, was\r\nover. The shock of its ending, which shattered her at first, was over\r\ntoo. She was beginning to breathe again, to take comfort once more: not\r\nthe comfort that Rachel had tried so hard to give her, but the comfort\r\nof feeling that happiness and ease were in store for her once more; that\r\nthese five hideous months were to be wiped out, and not her own past, to\r\nwhich she still secretly clung, out of which she was already building\r\nher future.\r\n\r\n"It is December now. Hugh and I shall be married next December, D.V.,\r\nnot before. We will be married quietly in London and go abroad. I shall\r\nhave a few tailor-made gowns from Vernon, but I shall wait for my other\r\nthings till I am in Paris on my way back. The boys will be at school by\r\nthen. Pauly is rather young, but they had better go together, and they\r\nneed not come home for the holidays just at first. I don\'t think Hugh\r\nwould care to have the boys always about. I won\'t keep my title. I hate\r\neverything to do with _him_"--(Lord Newhaven was still _him_)--"and I\r\nknow the Queen does not like it. I will be presented as Mrs. Scarlett,\r\nand we will live at his place in Shropshire, and at last we shall be\r\nhappy. Hugh will never turn against me as _he_ did."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven\'s thoughts travelled back, in spite of herself, to her\r\nmarriage with Lord Newhaven, and the humble, boundless admiration which\r\nshe had accepted as a matter of course, which had been extinguished so\r\nentirely, so inexplicably, soon after marriage, which had been succeeded\r\nby still more inexplicable paroxysms of bitterness and contempt. Other\r\nmen, Lady Newhaven reflected, respected and loved their wives even after\r\nthey lost their complexions, and--she had kept hers. Why had he been\r\ndifferent from others? It was impossible to account for men and their\r\nways. And how he had sneered at her when she talked gravely to him,\r\nespecially on religious subjects. Decidedly, Edward had been very\r\ndifficult, until he settled down into the sarcastic indifference that\r\nhad marked all his intercourse with her after the first year.\r\n\r\n"Hugh will never be like that," she said to herself, "and he will never\r\nlaugh at me for being religious. He understands me as Edward never did.\r\nAnd I will be married in a pale shade of violet velvet trimmed with\r\nermine, as it will be a winter wedding. And my bouquet shall be of\r\nNeapolitan violets, to match my name."\r\n\r\n"May I come in?" said Rachel\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Do," said Lady Newhaven, but without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nShe no longer needed Rachel. The crisis during which she had clung to\r\nher was past. What shipwrecked seaman casts a second thought after his\r\nrescue to the log which supported him upon a mountainous sea? Rachel\r\ninterrupted pleasant thoughts. Lady Newhaven observed that her friend\'s\r\nface had grown unbecomingly thin, and that what little color there was\r\nin it was faded. "She is the same age as I am, but she looks much\r\nolder," said Lady Newhaven to herself, adding, aloud:\r\n\r\n"Dear Rachel!"\r\n\r\n"Every one has gone," said Rachel, "and I have had a telegram from Lady\r\nTrentham. She has reached Paris, and will be here to-morrow afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Dearest mamma!" said Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"So now," said Rachel, sitting down near the sofa with a set\r\ncountenance, "I shall feel quite happy about leaving you."\r\n\r\n"Must you go?"\r\n\r\n"I must. I have arranged to leave by the seven-thirty to-morrow morning.\r\nI think it will be better if we say good-bye over night."\r\n\r\n"I shall miss you dreadfully." Lady Newhaven perceived suddenly, and\r\nwith resentment, that Rachel was anxious to go.\r\n\r\n"I do not think you will miss me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you say that. You have been so dear and sympathetic.\r\nYou understand me much better than mamma. And then mamma was always so\r\nfond of Edward. She cried for joy when I was engaged to him. She said\r\nher only fear was that I should not appreciate him. She never could see\r\nthat he was in fault. I must say he was kind to her. I do wish I was not\r\nobliged to have her now. I know she will do nothing but talk of him. Now\r\nI come to think of it, do stay, Rachel."\r\n\r\n"There is a reason why I can\'t stay, and why you won\'t wish me to stay\r\nwhen I tell it you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Vernon! I saw you and him holding hands in the dusk. But I\r\ndon\'t mind if you marry him, Rachel. I believe he is a good sort of a\r\nyoung man--not the kind I could ever have looked at; but what does that\r\nmatter? I am afraid it has rankled in your mind that I once warned you\r\nagainst him. But, after all, it is your affair, not mine."\r\n\r\n"I was not going to speak of Mr. Vernon."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven sighed impatiently. She did not want to talk of Rachel\'s\r\naffairs. She wanted, now the funeral was over, to talk of her own. She\r\noften said there were few people with less curiosity about others than\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nRachel pulled herself together.\r\n\r\n"Violet," she said, "we have known each other five months, haven\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly. The first time you came to my house was that dreadful\r\nnight of the drawing of lots. I always thought Edward drew the short\r\nlighter. It was so like him to turn it off with a laugh."\r\n\r\n"I want you to remember, if ever you think hardly of me, that during\r\nthose five months I did try to be a friend. I may have failed, but--I\r\ndid my best."\r\n\r\n"But you did not fail. You have been a real friend, and you will always\r\nbe so, dear Rachel. And when Hugh and I are married you will often come\r\nand stay with us."\r\n\r\nA great compassion flooded Rachel\'s heart for this poor creature, with\r\nits house of cards. Then her face became fixed as a surgeon\'s who gets\r\nout his knife.\r\n\r\n"I think I ought to tell you--you ought to know--that I care for Mr.\r\nScarlett."\r\n\r\n"He is mine," said Lady Newhaven instantly, her blue eyes dilating.\r\n\r\n"He is unmarried, and I am unmarried," said Rachel, hoarsely. "I don\'t\r\nknow how it came about, but I have gradually become attached to him."\r\n\r\n"He is not unmarried. It is false. He is my husband in the sight of\r\nHeaven. I have always, through everything, looked upon him as such."\r\n\r\nThis seemed more probable than that Heaven had so regarded him. Rachel\r\ndid not answer. She had confided her love to no one, not even to Hester;\r\nand to speak of it to Lady Newhaven had been like tearing the words out\r\nof herself with hot pincers.\r\n\r\n"I knew he was poor, but I did, not know he was as poor as that," said\r\nLady Newhaven, after a pause.\r\n\r\nRachel got up suddenly, and moved away to the fireplace. She felt it\r\nwould be horribly easy to strangle that voice.\r\n\r\n"And you came down here pretending to be my friend, while all the time\r\nyou were stealing his heart from me."\r\n\r\nStill Rachel did not answer. Her forehead was pressed against the\r\nmantel-shelf. She prayed urgently that she might stay upon the\r\nhearth-rug, that whatever happened she might not go near the sofa.\r\n\r\n"And you think he is in love with you?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Are you not rather credulous? But I suppose he has told you over and\r\nover again that he cares for you yourself alone. Is the wedding-day\r\nfixed?"\r\n\r\n"No, he has not asked me to marry him yet. I wanted to tell you before\r\nit happened."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven threw herself back on the sofa. She laughed softly. A\r\nlittle mirror hung tilted at an angle which allowed her to see herself\r\nas she lay. She saw a very beautiful woman, and then she turned and\r\nlooked at Rachel, who had no beauty, as she understood it, and laughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear," she said, in a voice that made Rachel wince, "Hugh is no\r\nbetter than the worst. He has made love to you _pour passer le temps_,\r\nand you have taken him seriously, like the dear, simple woman you are.\r\nBut he will never marry you. You own he has not proposed? Of course not.\r\nMen are like that. It is hateful of them, but they will do it. They are\r\nthe vainest creatures in the world. Don\'t you see that the reason he has\r\nnot asked you is because he knew that Edward had to--and that I should\r\nsoon be free to marry him. And, Rachel, you need not feel the least\r\nlittle bit humiliated, for I shan\'t tell a soul, and, after all, he\r\nloved me first."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven was quite reassured. It had been a horrible moment, but it\r\nwas past.\r\n\r\n"Why do I always make trouble?" she said, with plaintive\r\nself-complacency. "Rachel, you must not be jealous of me. I can\'t help\r\nit."\r\n\r\nRachel tried to say "I am not," but the words would not come. She _was_\r\njealous, jealous of the past, cut to the heart every time she noticed\r\nthat Lady Newhaven\'s hair waved over her ears, and that she had taper\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"I think it is no use talking of this any more," Rachel said. "Perhaps I\r\nwas wrong to speak of it at all. I did as I would be done by. As I am\r\nstarting early I think I will say good-night and good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, dear Rachel, and perhaps, as you say, it had better be\r\ngood-bye. You may remain quite easy in your mind that I shall never\r\nbreathe a word of what you have said to any living soul--except Hugh,"\r\nshe added to herself, as Rachel left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n     "To every coward safety, and afterwards his evil hour."\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep, that fickle courtier of our hours of ease, had deserted Hugh.\r\nWhen the last hour of the last day was over, and the dawn which he had\r\nbound himself in honor not to see found him sitting alone in his room,\r\nwhere he had sat all night, horror fell upon him at what he had done.\r\nNow that its mire was upon him he saw by how foul, by how dastardly a\r\npath he had escaped.\r\n\r\n"To every coward safety, and afterwards his evil hour." Hugh\'s evil hour\r\nhad come. But was he a coward? Men not braver than he have earned the\r\nVictoria Cross, have given up their lives freely for others. Hugh had it\r\nin him to do as well as any man in hot blood, but not in cold. That was\r\nwhere Lord Newhaven had the advantage of him. He had been overmatched\r\nfrom the first. The strain without had been greater than the power of\r\nresistance within. As the light grew Hugh tasted of that cup which God\r\nholds to no man\'s lips--_remorse_. Would the cup of death which he had\r\npushed aside have been more bitter?\r\n\r\nHe took up his life like a thief. Was it not stolen? He could not bear\r\nhis rooms. He could not bear the crowded streets. He could not bear the\r\nparks. He wandered aimlessly from one to the other, driven out of each\r\nin turn, consumed by the smouldering flame of his self-contempt. Scorn\r\nseemed written on the faces of the passers-by. As the day waned, he\r\nfound himself once again for the twentieth time in the park, pacing in\r\n"the dim, persistent rain," which had been falling all day.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get away from the distant roar of the traffic. He\r\nheard it everywhere, like the Niagara which he had indeed escaped, but\r\nthe sound of which would be in his ears till he died. He drew nearer and\r\nnearer to the traffic, and stood still in the rain listening to it\r\nintently. Might one of those thousand wheels be even now bringing his\r\nenemy towards him, to force him to keep his unspoken word. Hugh had not\r\nrealized that his worst enemy was he who stood with him in the rain.\r\n\r\nThe forlorn London trees, black and bare, seemed to listen too, and to\r\ncling closer to their parks and grass, as if they dimly foresaw the\r\ninevitable time coming when they too should toil, and hate, and suffer,\r\nas they saw on all sides those stunted uprooted figures toil and suffer,\r\nwhich had once been trees like themselves. "We shall come to it," they\r\nseemed to say, shivering in all their branches, as they peered through\r\nthe iron rails at the stream of human life, much as man peers at a\r\npassing funeral.\r\n\r\nThe early night drove Hugh back to the house. He found a note, from a\r\nman who had rooms above him, enclosing a theatre ticket, which at the\r\nlast moment he had been prevented using. He instantly clutched at the\r\nidea of escaping from himself for a few hours at least. He hastily\r\nchanged his wet clothes, ate the food that had been prepared for him,\r\nand hurried out once more.\r\n\r\nThe play was "Julius C\xe6sar," at Her Majesty\'s. He had seen it several\r\ntimes, but to-night it appealed to him as it had never done before. He\r\nhardly noticed the other actors. His whole interest centred in the awful\r\nfigure of Cassius, splendid in its unswerving deathless passion of a\r\ngreat hate and a great love. His eyes never left the ruthless figure as\r\nit stood in silence with its unflinching eyes upon its victim. Had not\r\nLord Newhaven thus watched him, Hugh, ready to strike when the hour\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe moment of the murder was approaching. Hugh held his breath. Cassius\r\nknelt with the rest before C\xe6sar. Hugh saw his hand seek the handle of\r\nhis sword, saw the end of the sheath tilt upwards under his robe as the\r\nblade slipped out of it. Then came the sudden outburst of animal\r\nferocity long held in leash, of stab on stab, the self-recovery, the\r\ncold stare at the dead figure with Cassius\'s foot upon its breast.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the scene vanished. Hugh saw again the quiet study with its\r\nelectric reading-lamp, the pistols over the mantel-piece, the tiger\r\nglint in Lord Newhaven\'s eyes. He was like Cassius. He, too, had been\r\nready to risk life, everything in the prosecution of his hate.\r\n\r\n"He shall never stand looking down on my body," said Hugh to himself,\r\n"with his cursed foot upon me." And he realized that if he had been a\r\nworthier antagonist, that also might have been. The play dealt with men.\r\nCassius and Lord Newhaven were men. But what was he?\r\n\r\nThe fear of death leading the love of life by the hand took with shame a\r\nlower seat. Hugh saw them at last in their proper places. If he could\r\nhave died then he would have died cheerfully, gladly, as he saw Cassius\r\ndie by his own hand, counting death the little thing it is. Afterwards,\r\nas he stood in the crowd near the door, where the rain was delaying the\r\negress, he saw suddenly Lord Newhaven\'s face watching him. His heart\r\nleaped. "He has come to make me keep my word," he said to himself, the\r\nexaltation of the play still upon him. "I will not avoid him. Let him do\r\nit," and he pressed forward towards him.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven looked fixedly at him for a moment, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\n"He will follow me and stab me in the back," said Hugh. "I will walk\r\nhome by the street where the pavement is up, and let him do it."\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, steadily on, looking neither to right nor left.\r\nPresently he came to a barrier across a long deserted street, with a red\r\nlamp keeping guard over it. He walked deliberately up it. He had no\r\nfear. In the middle he stopped, and fumbled in his pocket for a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nA soft step was coming up behind him.\r\n\r\n"It will be quickly over," he said to himself. "Wait. Don\'t look round."\r\n\r\nHe stood motionless. His silver cigarette-case dropped from his hand. He\r\nlooked at it for a second, forgetting to pick it up. A dirty hand\r\nsuddenly pounced upon it, and a miserable ragged figure flew past him up\r\nthe street. Hugh stared after it, bewildered, and then looked round. The\r\nstreet was quite empty. He drew a long breath, and something between\r\nrelief and despair took hold of him.\r\n\r\n"Then he does not want to, after all. He has not even followed me. Why\r\nwas he there? He was waiting for me. What horrible revenge is he\r\nplanning against me. Is he laying a second trap for me?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following night Hugh read in the evening papers that Lord Newhaven\r\nhad been accidently killed on the line. The revulsion of feeling was too\r\nsudden, too overwhelming. He could not bear it. He could not live\r\nthrough it. He flung himself on his face upon the floor, and sobbed as\r\nif his heart would break.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cyclone of passion which had swept Hugh into its vortex spent itself\r\nand him, and flung him down at last. How long a time elapsed he never\r\nknew between the moment when he, read the news of the accident and the\r\nmoment when shattered, exhausted, disfigured by emotion, he raised\r\nhimself to his feet. He opened the window, and the night air laid its\r\ncool mother-touch upon his face and hands. The streets were silent. The\r\nhouse was silent. He leaned with closed eyes against the window-post.\r\nTime passed by on the other side.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while angels came and ministered to him. Thankfulness came\r\nsoftly, gently, to take his shaking hand in hers. The awful past was\r\nover. A false step, a momentary giddiness on the part of his enemy, and\r\nthe hideous strangling meshes of the past had fallen from him at a\r\ntouch, as if they had never wrapped him round. Lord Newhaven was gone\r\nto return no more. The past went with him. Dead men tell no tales. No\r\none knew of the godless compact between them, and of how he, Hugh, had\r\nfailed to keep to it, save they two alone. He and one other. And that\r\nother was dead--was dead.\r\n\r\nHope came next, shyly, silently, still pale from the embrace of her\r\nsister Despair, trimming anew her little lamp, which the laboring breath\r\nof Despair had wellnigh blown out. She held the light before Hugh,\r\nshading it with her veil, for his eyes were dazed with long gazing into\r\ndarkness. She turned it faintly upon the future, and he looked where the\r\nlight fell. And the light grew.\r\n\r\nHe had a future once more. He had been given that second chance for\r\nwhich he had so yearned. His life was his own once more: not the shamed\r\nlife in death--worse than death of the last two days--but his own to\r\ntake up again, to keep, to enjoy, best of all, to use worthily. No\r\nhorrible constraint was upon him to lay it down, or to live in torment\r\nbecause he still held it. He was free, free to marry Rachel whom he\r\nloved, and who loved him. He saw his life with her. Hope smiled, and\r\nturned up her light. It was too bright. Hugh hid his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nAnd, last of all, dwarfing Hope, came a divine constraining presence who\r\never stretches out strong hands to them that fall, who alone sets the\r\nstumbling feet upon the upward path. Repentance came to Hugh at last. In\r\nall this long time she had not come while he was suffering, while\r\nsmouldering Remorse had darkened his soul with smoke. But in this quiet\r\nhour she came and stood beside him.\r\n\r\nHugh had in the past leaned heavily on extenuating circumstances. He had\r\nmade many excuses for himself. But now he made none. Perhaps, for the\r\nfirst time in his life, under the pressure of that merciful, that benign\r\nhand, he was sincere with himself. He saw his conduct--that easily\r\ncondoned conduct--as it was. Love and Repentance, are not these the\r\ngreat teachers? Some of us so frame our lives that we never come face\r\nto face with either, or with ourselves. Hugh came to himself at last. He\r\nsaw how, whether detected or not, his sin had sapped his manhood, spread\r\nlike a leaven of evil through his whole life, laid its hideous touch of\r\ndesecration and disillusion even on his love for Rachel. It had\r\ntarnished his mind; his belief in others; his belief in good. These\r\nideals, these beliefs had been his possession once, his birthright. He\r\nhad sold his birthright for red pottage. Until now he had scorned the\r\nred pottage. Now he saw that his sin lay deeper, even in his original\r\nscorn of his birthright, his disbelief in the Divine Spirit who dwells\r\nwith man.\r\n\r\nNevertheless his just punishment had been remitted. Hitherto he had\r\nlooked solely at that punishment, feeling that it was too great. He had\r\nprayed many times that he might escape it. Now for the first time he\r\nprayed that he might be forgiven.\r\n\r\nRepentance took his hands and locked them together.\r\n\r\n"God helping me," he said, "I will lead a new life."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n     "Les sots sont plus \xe0 craindre que les m\xe9chants."\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley had often remarked to persons in affliction that when things\r\nare at their worst they generally take a turn for the better. This\r\nprofound truth was proving itself equal to the occasion at Warpington\r\nVicarage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley was well again, after a fortnight at the seaside with\r\nRegie. The sea air had blown back a faint color into Regie\'s cheeks. The\r\nnew baby\'s vaccination was ceasing to cast a vocal gloom over the\r\nthin-walled house. The old baby\'s whole attention was mercifully\r\ndiverted from his wrongs to the investigation of that connection between\r\na chair and himself, which he perceived the other children could assume\r\nat pleasure. He stood for hours looking at his own little chair,\r\nsolemnly seating himself at long intervals where no chair was. But his\r\nmind was working, and work, as we know, is the panacea for mental\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley had recovered that buoyancy of spirits which was the theme\r\nof Mrs. Gresley\'s increasing admiration.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening, when his wife had asked him if the beef were\r\ntender, he had replied, as he always did if in a humorous vein:\r\n"Douglas, Douglas, tender and true." The arrival of the pot of marmalade\r\n(that integral part of the mysterious meal which begins with meat and is\r\ncrowned with buns) had been hailed by the exclamation, "What! More\r\nfamily jars." In short, Mr. Gresley was himself again.\r\n\r\nThe jocund Vicar, with his arm round Mrs. Gresley, proceeded to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nOn the hall table was a large parcel insured for two hundred pounds. It\r\nhad evidently just arrived by rail.\r\n\r\n"Ah! ha!" said Mr. Gresley. "My pamphlets at last. Very methodical of\r\nSmithers insuring them for such a large sum," and, without looking at\r\nthe address, he cut the string.\r\n\r\n"Well packed," he remarked. "Water-proof sheeting, I do declare.\r\nSmithers is certainly a cautious man. Ha! at last!"\r\n\r\nThe inmost wrapping shelled off, and Mr. Gresley\'s jaw dropped. Where\r\nwere the little green and gold pamphlets entitled "Modern Dissent," for\r\nwhich his parental soul was yearning? He gazed down frowning at a solid\r\nmass of manuscript, written in a small, clear hand.\r\n\r\n"This is Hester\'s writing," he said. "There is some mistake."\r\n\r\nHe turned to the direction on the outer cover.\r\n\r\n"Miss Hester Gresley, care of Rev. James Gresley." He had only seen his\r\nown name.\r\n\r\n"I do believe," he said, "that this is Hester\'s book, refused by the\r\npublisher. Poor Hester! I am afraid she will feel that."\r\n\r\nHis turning over of the parcel dislodged an unfolded sheet of\r\nnote-paper, which made a parachute expedition to the floor. Mr. Gresley\r\npicked it up and laid it on the parcel.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s not refused, after all," he said, his eye catching the sense\r\nof the few words before him. "Hester seems to have sent for it back to\r\nmake some alterations, and Mr. Bentham--I suppose that is the\r\npublisher--asks for it back with as little delay as possible. Then she\r\nhas sold it to him. I wonder what she got for it. She got a hundred for\r\n_The Idyll_. It is wonderful to think of, when Bishop Heavysides got\r\nnothing at all for his Diocesan sermons, and had to make up thirty\r\npounds out of his own pocket as well. But as long as the public is\r\nwilling to pay through the nose for trashy fiction to amuse its\r\nidleness, so long will novelists reap in these large harvests. If I had\r\nHester\'s talent--"\r\n\r\n"You have. Mrs. Loftus was saying so only yesterday."\r\n\r\n"If I had time to work it out, I should not pander to the depraved\r\npublic taste as Hester does. I should use my talent, as I have often\r\ntold her, for the highest ends, not for the lowest. It would be my aim,"\r\nMr. Gresley\'s voice rose sonorously, "to raise my readers, to educate\r\nthem, to place a high ideal before them, to ennoble them."\r\n\r\n"You could do it," said Mrs. Gresley, with conviction. And it is\r\nprobable that the conviction both felt was a true one; that Mr. Gresley\r\ncould write a book which would, from their point of view, fulfil these\r\nvast requirements.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley shook his head, and put the parcel on a table in his study.\r\n\r\n"Hester will be back the day after to-morrow," he said, "and then she\r\ncan take charge of it herself." And he filled in the railway form of its\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley, who had been to tea with the Pratts for the first time\r\nsince her convalescence, was tired, and went early to bed; or, as Mr.\r\nGresley termed it, "Bedfordshire"; and Mr. Gresley retired to his study\r\nto put a few finishing touches to a paper he was writing on St.\r\nAugustine--not by request--for that receptacle of clerical genius, the\r\nparish magazine.\r\n\r\nWill the contents of parish magazines always be written by the clergy?\r\nIs it Utopian to hope that a day will dawn when it will be perceived\r\neven by clerical editors that Apostolic Succession does not invariably\r\nconfer literary talent? What can an intelligent artisan think when he\r\nreads--what he reads--in his parish magazine? A serial story by a Rector\r\nunknown to fame, who, if he possesses talent, conceals it in some other\r\nnapkin than the parish magazine; a short paper on "Bees," by an\r\nArchdeacon; "An Easter Hymn," by a Bishop, and such a good bishop,\r\ntoo--but what a hymn! "Poultry-Keeping," by Alice Brown. We draw breath,\r\nbut the relief is only momentary. "Side Lights on the Reformation," by\r\na Canon. "Half-hours with the Young," by a Rural Dean.\r\n\r\nBut as an invalid will rebel against a long course of milk puddings, and\r\nwill crave for the jam roll which is for others, so Mr. Gresley\'s mind\r\nrevolted from St. Augustine, and craved for something different.\r\n\r\nHis wandering eye fell on Hester\'s book.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t attend to graver things to-night," he said, "I will take a look\r\nat Hester\'s story. I showed her my paper on "Dissent," so, of course, I\r\ncan dip into her book. I hate lopsided confidences, and I dare say I\r\ncould give her a few hints, as she did me. Two heads are better than\r\none. The Pratts and Thursbys all think that bit in _The Idyll_ where the\r\ntwo men quarrelled was dictated by me. Strictly speaking, it wasn\'t, but\r\nno doubt she picked up her knowledge of men, which surprises people so\r\nmuch, from things she has heard me say. She certainly did not want me to\r\nread her book. She said I should not like it. But I shall have to read\r\nit some time, so I may as well skim it before it goes to the printers. I\r\nhave always told her I did not feel free from responsibility in the\r\nmatter after _The Idyll_ appeared with things in it which I should have\r\nmade a point of cutting out, if she had only consulted me before she\r\nrushed into print."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley lifted the heavy mass of manuscript to his writing-table,\r\nturned up his reading-lamp, and sat down before it.\r\n\r\nThe church clock struck nine. It was always wrong, but it set the time\r\nat Warpington.\r\n\r\nThere were two hours before bedtime--I mean "Bedfordshire."\r\n\r\nHe turned over the first blank sheet and came to the next, which had one\r\nword only written on it.\r\n\r\n"_Husks!_" said Mr. Gresley. "That must be the title. Husks that the\r\nswine did eat. Ha! I see. A very good sound story might be written on\r\nthat theme of a young man who left the Church, and how inadequate he\r\nfound the teaching--the spiritual food--of other denominations compared\r\nto what he had partaken freely of in his Father\'s house. Husks! It is\r\nnot a bad name, but it is too short. \'The Consequences of Sin\' would be\r\nbetter, more striking, and convey the idea in a more impressive manner."\r\nMr. Gresley took up his pen, and then laid it down. "I will run through\r\nthe story before I alter the name. It may not take the line I expect."\r\n\r\nIt did not.\r\n\r\nThe next page had two words on it:\r\n\r\n     "TO RACHEL."\r\n\r\nWhat an extraordinary thing! Any one, be they who they might, would\r\nnaturally have thought that if the book were dedicated to any one it\r\nwould be to her only brother. But Hester, it seemed, thought nothing of\r\nblood relations. She disregarded them entirely.\r\n\r\nThe blood relation began to read. He seemed to forget to skip. Page\r\nafter page was slowly turned. Sometimes he hesitated a moment to change\r\na word. He had always been conscious of a gift for finding the right\r\nword. This gift Hester did not share with him. She often got hold of the\r\nwrong end of the stick. He could hardly refrain from a smile when he\r\ncame across the sentence, "He was young enough to know better," as he\r\nsubstituted in a large illegible hand the word _old_ for _young_. There\r\nwere many obvious little mistakes of this kind that he corrected as he\r\nread, but now and then he stopped short.\r\n\r\nOne of the characters, an odious person, was continually saying things\r\nshe had no business to say. Mr. Gresley wondered how Hester had come\r\nacross such doubtful women--not under his roof. Lady Susan must have\r\nassociated with thoroughly unsuitable people.\r\n\r\n"I keep a smaller spiritual establishment than I did," said the odious\r\nperson. "I have dismissed that old friend of my childhood, the devil. I\r\nreally had no further use for him."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley crossed through the passage at once. How could Hester write\r\nso disrespectfully of the devil?\r\n\r\n"This is positive nonsense," said Mr. Gresley, irritably; "coming as it\r\ndoes just after the sensible chapter about the new vicar who made a\r\nclean sweep of all the old dead regulations in his parish because he\r\nfelt he must introduce spiritual life into the place. Now that is really\r\ngood. I don\'t quite know what Hester means by saying he took exercise in\r\nhis clerical _cul-de-sac_. I think she means _surtout_, but she is a\r\ngood French scholar, so she probably knows what she is talking about."\r\n\r\nWhatever the book lacked it did not lack interest. Still, it bristled\r\nwith blemishes.\r\n\r\nAnd then what could the Pratts, or indeed any one, make of such a\r\nsentence as this:\r\n\r\n"When we look back at what we were seven years ago, five years ago, and\r\nperceive the difference in ourselves, a difference amounting almost to\r\nchange of identity; when we look back and see in how many characters we\r\nhave lived and loved and suffered and died before we reached the\r\ncharacter that momentarily clothes us, and from which our soul is\r\nstruggling out to clothe itself anew; when we feel how the sympathy even\r\nof those who love us best is always with our last expression, never with\r\nour present feeling, always with the last dead self on which our\r\nclimbing feet are set--"\r\n\r\n"She is hopelessly confused," said Mr. Gresley, without reading to the\r\nend of the sentence, and substituting the word _ladder_ for _dead self_.\r\n"Of course, I see what she means, the different stages of life, the\r\ninfant, the boy, the man, but hardly any one else will so understand\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe clock struck ten. Mr. Gresley was amazed. The hour had seemed like\r\nten minutes.\r\n\r\n"I will just see what happens in the next chapter," he said. And he did\r\nnot hear the clock when it struck again. The story was absorbing. It was\r\nas if through that narrow, shut-up chamber a gust of mountain air were\r\nsweeping like a breath of fresh life. Mr. Gresley was vaguely stirred\r\nin spite of himself, until he remembered that it was all fantastic,\r\nvisionary. He had never felt like that, and his own experience was his\r\nmeasure of the utmost that is possible in human nature. He would have\r\ncalled a kettle visionary if he had never seen one himself. It was only\r\nsaved from that reproach by the fact that it hung on his kitchen hob.\r\nWhat was so unfair about him was that he took gorillas and alligators,\r\nand the "wart pig" and all its warts on trust, though he had never seen\r\nthem. But the emotions which have shaken the human soul since the world\r\nbegan, long before the first "wart pig" was thought of--these he\r\ndisbelieved.\r\n\r\nAll the love which could not be covered by his own mild courtship of the\r\nobviously grateful Mrs. Gresley, Mr. Gresley put down as exaggerated.\r\nThere was a good deal of such exaggeration in Hester\'s book, which could\r\nonly be attributed to the French novels of which he had frequently\r\nexpressed his disapproval when he saw Hester reading them. It was given\r\nto Mr. Gresley to perceive that the French classics are only read for\r\nthe sake of the hideous improprieties contained in them. He had\r\nexplained this to Hester, and was indignant that she had continued to\r\nread them just as frequently as before, even translating parts of some\r\nof them into English, and back again into the original. She would have\r\nlowered the Bishop forever in his Vicar\'s eyes, if she had mentioned by\r\nwhose advice and selection she read, so she refrained.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as he read, Mr. Gresley\'s face softened. He came to the\r\nillness and death of a child. It had been written long before Regie fell\r\nill, but Mr. Gresley supposed it could only have been the result of what\r\nhad happened a few weeks ago since the book was sent up to the\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nTwo large tears fell on to the sheet. Hester\'s had been there before\r\nthem. It was all true, every word. Here was no exaggeration, no\r\nfantastic overcoloring for the sake of effect.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Hester!" he said, wiping his eyes. "If only the rest were like\r\nthat. If you would only write like that."\r\n\r\nA few pages more, and his eyes were like flint. The admirable clergyman\r\nwho had attracted him from the first reappeared. His opinions were\r\nuncommonly well put. But gradually it dawned upon Mr. Gresley that the\r\nclergyman was toiling in very uncomfortable situations, in which he did\r\nnot appear to advantage. Mr. Gresley did not see that the uncomfortable\r\nsituations were the inevitable result of holding certain opinions, but\r\nhe did see that "Hester was running down the clergy." Any fault found\r\nwith the clergy was in Mr. Gresley\'s eyes an attack upon the Church,\r\nnay, upon religion itself. That a protest against a certain class of the\r\nclergy might be the result of a close observation of the causes that\r\nbring ecclesiastical Christianity into disrepute could find no admission\r\nto Mr. Gresley\'s mind. Yet a protest against the ignorance or\r\ninefficiency of some of our soldiers he would have seen without\r\ndifficulty might be the outcome, not of hatred of the army, but of a\r\nrealization of its vast national importance, and of a desire of its\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was outraged. "She holds nothing sacred," he said, striking\r\nthe book. "I told her after the _Idyll_, that I desired she would not\r\nmention the subject of religion in her next book, and this is worse than\r\never. She has entirely disregarded my expressed wishes. Everything she\r\nsays has a sting in it. Look at this. It begins well, but it ends with a\r\nsneer."\r\n\r\n"Christ lives. He wanders still in secret over the hills and the valleys\r\nof the soul, that little kingdom which should not be of this world,\r\nwhich knows not the things that belong unto its peace. And earlier or\r\nlater there comes an hour when Christ is arraigned before the judgment\r\nbar in each individual soul. Once again the Church and the world combine\r\nto crush Him who stands silent in their midst, to condemn Him who has\r\nalready condemned them. Together they raise their fierce cry, \'Crucify\r\nHim! Crucify Him!\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley tore the leaf out of the manuscript and threw it in the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nBut worse remained behind. To add to its other sins, the book, now\r\ndrawing to its close, took a turn which had been led up to inevitably\r\nstep by step from the first chapter, but which, in its reader\'s eyes,\r\nwho perceived none of the steps, was a deliberate gratuitous\r\nintermeddling with vice. Mr. Gresley could not help reading, but, as he\r\nlaid down the manuscript for a moment to rest his eyes, he felt that he\r\nhad reached the limit of Hester\'s powers, and that he could only\r\nattribute the last volume to the Evil One himself.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly paid this high tribute to his sister\'s talent when the\r\ndoor opened, and Mrs. Gresley came in in a wrapper that had once been\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n"Dear James," she said, "is anything wrong? It is past one o\'clock. Are\r\nyou never coming to bed?"\r\n\r\n"Minna," said her pastor and master, "I have been reading the worst book\r\nI have come across yet, and it was written by my own sister under my own\r\nroof."\r\n\r\nHe might have added "close under the roof," if he had remembered the\r\nlittle attic chamber where the cold of winter and the heat of summer had\r\neach struck in turn and in vain at the indomitable perseverence of the\r\nwriter of those many pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n     The only sin which we never forgive in each other is difference of\r\n     opinion.--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was troubled, more troubled than he had ever been since a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten period before his ordination, when he had come in\r\ncontact with worldly minds, and had had doubts as to the justice of\r\neternal punishment. He was apt to speak in after years of the furnace\r\nthrough which he had passed, and from which nothing short of a\r\nconversation with a bishop had had power to save him, as a great\r\nexperience which he could not regret, because it had brought him into\r\nsympathy with so many minds. As he often said in his favorite language\r\nof metaphor, he "had threshed out the whole subject of agnosticism, and\r\ncould consequently meet other minds still struggling in its turbid\r\nwaves."\r\n\r\nBut now again he was deeply perturbed, and it was difficult to see in\r\nwhat blessing to his fellow-creatures this particular agitation would\r\nresult. He walked with bent head for hours in the garden. He could not\r\nattend to his sermon, though it was Friday. He entirely forgot his\r\nBible-class at the alms-houses in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley watched him from her bedroom window, where she was mending\r\nthe children\'s stockings. At last she laid aside her work and went out.\r\n\r\nShe might not be his mental equal. She might be unable, with her small\r\nfeminine mind, to fathom the depths and heights of that great\r\nintelligence, but still she was his wife. Perhaps, though she did not\r\nknow it, it troubled her to see him so absorbed in his sister, for she\r\nwas sure it was of Hester and her book that he was thinking. "I am his\r\nwife," she said to herself, as she joined him in silence, and passed her\r\narm through his. He needed to be reminded of her existence. Mr. Gresley\r\npressed it, and they took a turn in silence.\r\n\r\nHe had not a high opinion of the feminine intellect. He was wont to say\r\nthat he was tired of most women in ten minutes. But he had learned to\r\nmake an exception of his wife. What mind does not feel confidence in the\r\nsentiments of its echo?\r\n\r\n"I am greatly troubled about Hester," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"It is not a new trouble," said Mrs. Gresley. "I sometimes think,\r\ndearest, it is we who are to blame in having her to live with us. She is\r\nworldly--I suppose she can\'t help it--and we are unworldly. She is\r\nirreligious, and you are deeply religious. I wish I could say I was too,\r\nbut I lag far behind you. And though I am sure she does her best--and so\r\ndo we--her presence is a continual friction. I feel she always drags us\r\ndown."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice the\r\ndiffident plea which his wife was putting forward that Hester might\r\ncease to live with them.\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of that," he said, "so much as of this novel which\r\nshe has written. It is a profane, immoral book, and will do incalculable\r\nharm if it is published."\r\n\r\n"I feel sure it will," said Mrs. Gresley, who had not read it.\r\n\r\n"It is dreadfully coarse in places," continued Mr. Gresley, who had the\r\nsame opinion of George Eliot\'s works. "And I warned Hester most solemnly\r\non that point when I found she had begun another book. I told her that I\r\nwell knew that to meet the public taste it was necessary to interlard\r\nfiction with _risqu\xe9_ things in order to make it sell, but that it was\r\nmy earnest hope she would in future resist this temptation. She only\r\nsaid that if she introduced improprieties into her book in order to make\r\nmoney, in her opinion she deserved to be whipped in the public streets.\r\nShe was very angry, I remember, and became as white as a sheet, and I\r\ndropped the subject."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t bear even the most loving word of advice," said Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"She holds nothing sacred," went on Mr. Gresley, remembering an\r\nunfortunate incident in the clergyman\'s career. "Her life here seems to\r\nhave had no softening effect upon her. She sneers openly at religion. I\r\nnever thought, I never allowed myself to think, that she was so dead to\r\nspiritual things as her book forces me to believe. Even her good people,\r\nher heroine, have not a vestige of religion, only a sort of vague\r\nmorality, right for the sake of right, and love teaching people things;\r\nnothing real."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"Hester is my sister," said Mr. Gresley, "and I am fond of her in spite\r\nof all, and she has no one to look to for help and guidance but me. I am\r\nher only near relation. That is why I feel so much the way she\r\ndisregards all I say. She does not realize that it is for her sake I\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley thought he was sincere, because he was touched.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley\'s cheek burned. That faithful, devoted little heart, which\r\nlived only for her husband and children, could not brook--_what?_ That\r\nher priest should be grieved and disregarded? Or was it any affection\r\nfor and interest in another woman that it could not brook?\r\n\r\n"I have made up my mind," said Mr. Gresley, "to forbid her most solemnly\r\nwhen she comes back to-morrow to publish that book."\r\n\r\n"She does not come back to-morrow, but this evening," said the young\r\nwife; and pushed by some violent, nameless feeling which was too strong\r\nfor her, she added, "She will not obey you. When has she ever listened\r\nto what you say? She will laugh at you, James. She always laughs at you.\r\nAnd the book will be published all the same."\r\n\r\n"It shall not," said Mr. Gresley, coloring darkly. "I shall not allow\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t prevent it," said Mrs. Gresley, her breath coming quickly.\r\nShe was not thinking of the book at all, but of the writer. What was a\r\nbook, one more or one less? It was her duty to speak the truth to her\r\nhusband. His sister, whom he thought so much of, had no respect for his\r\nopinion, and he ought to know it. Mr. Gresley did know it, but he felt\r\nno particular satisfaction in his wife\'s presentment of the fact.\r\n\r\n"It is no use saying I can\'t prevent it," he said, coldly, letting his\r\narm fall by his side. He was no longer thinking of the book either, but\r\nof the disregard of his opinion, nay, of his authority, which had long\r\ngravelled him in his sister\'s attitude towards him. "I shall use my\r\nauthority when I see fit, and if I have so far used persuasion rather\r\nthan authority, it was only because, in my humble opinion, it was the\r\nwisest course."\r\n\r\n"It has always failed," said Mrs. Gresley, stung by the slackening of\r\nhis arm. Yes. In spite of the new baby, she would rather have a hundred\r\na year less than have this woman in the house. The wife ought to come\r\nfirst. By first, Mrs. Gresley meant without a second. She had this\r\nmorning seen Emma laying Hester\'s clean clothes on her bed, just\r\nreturned from a distant washer-woman whom the Gresleys did not employ,\r\nand whom they had not wished Hester to employ. The sight of those two\r\nwhite dressing-gowns, beautifully "got up" with goffered frills, had\r\naroused afresh in Mrs. Gresley what she believed to be indignation at\r\nHester\'s extravagance, an indignation which had been increased when she\r\ncaught sight of her own untidy wrapper over her chair. She always\r\nappeared to disadvantage in Hester\'s presence. The old smouldering\r\ngrievance about the washing set a light to other feelings. They caught.\r\nThey burned. They had been drying in the oven a long time.\r\n\r\n"It has always failed," said Mrs. Gresley, with subdued passion, "and it\r\nwill fail again. I heard you tell Mrs. Loftus that you would never let\r\nHester publish another book like the _Idyll_. But though you say this\r\none is worse, you won\'t be able to stop her. You will see when she\r\ncomes back that she will pack up the parcel and send it back to the\r\npublishers, whatever you may say."\r\n\r\nThe young couple were so absorbed in their conversation that they had\r\nnot observed the approach of a tall, clerical figure whom the\r\nparlor-maid was escorting towards them.\r\n\r\n"I saw you through the window, and I said I would join you in the\r\ngarden," said Archdeacon Thursby, majestically. "I have been lunching\r\nwith the Pratts. They naturally wished to hear the details of the\r\nlamented death of our mutual friend, Lord Newhaven."\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Thursby was the clergyman who had been selected, as a friend\r\nof Lady Newhaven\'s, to break to her her husband\'s death.\r\n\r\n"It seems," he added, "that a Miss West, who was at the Abbey at the\r\ntime, is an intimate friend of the Pratts."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley slipped away to order tea, the silver teapot, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon was a friend of Mr. Gresley\'s. Mr. Gresley had not many\r\nfriends among the clergy, possibly because he always attributed the\r\npopularity of any of his brethren to a laxity of principle on their\r\npart, or their success, if they did succeed, to the peculiarly easy\r\ncircumstances in which they were placed. But he greatly admired the\r\nArchdeacon, and made no secret of the fact that, in his opinion, he\r\nought to have been the Bishop of the diocese.\r\n\r\nA long conversation now ensued on clerical matters, and Mr. Gresley\'s\r\ndrooping spirits revived under a refreshing _douche_ of compliments on\r\n"Modern Dissent."\r\n\r\nThe idea flashed across his mind of asking the Archdeacon\'s advice\r\nregarding Hester\'s book. His opinion carried weight. His remarks on\r\n"Modern Dissent" showed how clear, how statesmanlike his judgment was.\r\nMr. Gresley decided to lay the matter before him, and to consult him as\r\nto his responsibility in the matter. The Archdeacon did not know Hester.\r\nHe did not know--for he lived at a distance of several miles--that Mr.\r\nGresley had a sister who had written a book.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley did not wish him to become aware of this last fact, for we\r\nall keep our domestic skeletons in their cupboards, so he placed a\r\nhypothetical case before his friend.\r\n\r\nSupposing some one he knew, a person for whose actions he felt himself\r\npartly responsible, had written a most unwise letter, and this letter,\r\nby no fault of Mr. Gresley\'s, had fallen into his hands and been read by\r\nhim. What was he, Mr. Gresley, to do? The letter, if posted, would\r\ncertainly get the writer into trouble, and would cause acute humiliation\r\nto the writer\'s family. What would the Archdeacon do, in his place?\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley did not perceive that the hypothetical case was not "on all\r\nfours" with the real one. His first impulse had been to gain the opinion\r\nof an expert without disclosing family dissensions. Did some unconscious\r\nsecondary motive impel him to shape the case so that only one verdict\r\nwas probable?\r\n\r\nThe good Archdeacon ruminated, asked a few questions, and then said,\r\nwithout hesitation:\r\n\r\n"I cannot see your difficulty. Your course is clear. You are\r\nresponsible--"\r\n\r\n"To a certain degree."\r\n\r\n"To a certain degree for the action of an extremely injudicious friend\r\nor relation who writes a letter which will get him and others into\r\ntrouble. It providentially falls into your hands. If I were in your\r\nplace I should destroy it, inform your friend that I had done so\r\nprincipally for his own sake, and endeavor to bring him to a better mind\r\non the subject."\r\n\r\n"Supposing the burning of the letter entailed a money loss?"\r\n\r\n"I judge from what you say of this particular letter that any money that\r\naccrued from it would be ill-gotten gains."\r\n\r\n"Oh! decidedly."\r\n\r\n"Then burn it; and if your friend remains obstinate he can always write\r\nit again; but we must hope that by gaining time you will be able to\r\narouse his better feelings, and at least induce him to moderate its\r\ntone."\r\n\r\n"Of course he could write it again if he remains obstinate. I never\r\nthought of that," said Mr. Gresley, in a low voice. "So he would not\r\neventually lose the money if he was still decided to gain it in an\r\nunscrupulous manner. Or I could help him to rewrite it. I never thought\r\nof that before."\r\n\r\n"Your course is perfectly clear, my dear Gresley," said the Archdeacon,\r\nnot impatiently, but as one who is ready to open up a new subject. "Your\r\ntender conscience alone makes the difficulty. Is not Mrs. Gresley\r\nendeavoring to attract our attention?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley was beckoning them in to tea.\r\n\r\nWhen the Archdeacon had departed, Mr. Gresley said to his wife: "I have\r\ntalked over the matter with him, not mentioning names, of course. He is\r\na man of great judgment. He advises me to burn it."\r\n\r\n"Hester\'s book?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"He is quite right, I think," said Mrs. Gresley, her hands trembling, as\r\nshe took up her work. Hester would never forgive her brother if he did\r\nthat. It would certainly cause a quarrel between them. Young married\r\npeople did best without a third person in the house.\r\n\r\n"Will you follow his advice?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I--you see--poor Hester!--it has taken her a long time to\r\nwrite. I wish to goodness she would leave writing alone."\r\n\r\n"She is coming home this evening," said his wife, significantly.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley abruptly left the room, and went back to his study. He was\r\nirritated, distressed.\r\n\r\nProvidence seemed to have sent the Archdeacon to advise him. And the\r\nArchdeacon had spoken with decision. "Burn it," that was what he had\r\nsaid, "and tell your friend that you have done so."\r\n\r\nIt did not strike Mr. Gresley that the advice might have been somewhat\r\ndifferent if the question had been respecting the burning of a book\r\ninstead of a letter. Such subtleties had never been allowed to occupy\r\nMr. Gresley\'s mind. He was, as he often said, no splitter of hairs.\r\n\r\nHe told himself that from the very first moment of consulting him he had\r\ndreaded that the Archdeacon would counsel exactly as he had done. Mr.\r\nGresley stood a long time in silent prayer by his study window. If his\r\nprayers took the same bias as his recent statements to his friend, was\r\nthat his fault? If he silenced, as a sign of cowardice, a voice within\r\nhim which entreated for delay, was that his fault? If he had never\r\neducated himself to see any connection between a seed and a plant, a\r\ncause and a result, was that his fault? The first seedling impulse to\r\ndestroy the book was buried and forgotten. If he mistook this towering,\r\nfull-grown determination which had sprung from it for the will of God,\r\nthe direct answer to prayer, was that his fault?\r\n\r\nAs his painful duty became clear to him, a thin veil of smoke drifted\r\nacross the little lawn.\r\n\r\nRegie came dancing and caracoling round the corner.\r\n\r\n"Father!" he cried, rushing to the window, "Abel has made such a bonfire\r\nin the back-yard, and he is burning weeds and all kinds of things, and\r\nhe has given us each a \'\'tato\' to bake, and Fr\xe4ulein has given us a\r\nband-box she did not want, and we\'ve filled it quite full of dry leaves.\r\nAnd do you think if we wait a little Auntie Hester will be back in time\r\nto see it burn?"\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid bonfire. It leaped. It rose and fell. It was\r\nreplenished. Something alive in the heart of it died hard. The children\r\ndanced round it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if only Auntie Hester was here!" said Regie, clapping his hands as\r\nthe flame soared.\r\n\r\nBut "Auntie Hester" was too late to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n     And we are punished for our purest deeds,\r\n     And chasten\'d for our holiest thoughts; alas!\r\n     There is no reason found in all the creeds,\r\n     Why these things are, nor whence they come to pass.\r\n                                         --OWEN MEREDITH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was while Hester was at the Palace that Lord Newhaven died. She had\r\nperhaps hardly realized, till he was gone, how much his loyal friendship\r\nhad been to her. Yet she had hardly seen him for the last year, partly\r\nbecause she was absorbed in her book, and partly because, to her\r\nastonishment, she found that her brother and his wife looked coldly upon\r\n"an unmarried woman receiving calls from a married man."\r\n\r\nFor in the country individuality has not yet emerged. People are married\r\nor they are unmarried--that is all. Just as in London they are agreeable\r\nor dull--that is all.\r\n\r\n"Since I have been at Warpington," Hester said to Lord Newhaven one day,\r\nthe last time he found her in, "I have realized that I am unmarried. I\r\nnever thought of it all the years I lived in London, but when I visit\r\namong the country people here, as I drive through the park, I remember,\r\nwith a qualm, that I am a spinster, no doubt because I can\'t help it. As\r\nI enter the hall I recall, with a pang, that I am eight-and-twenty. By\r\nthe time I am in the drawing-room I am an old maid."\r\n\r\nShe had always imagined she would take up her friendship with him again,\r\nand when he died she reproached herself for having temporarily laid it\r\naside. Perhaps no one, except Lord Newhaven\'s brothers, felt his death\r\nmore than Dick and Hester and the Bishop. The Bishop had sincerely\r\nliked Lord Newhaven. A certain degree of friendship had existed between\r\nthe two men, which had often trembled on the verge of intimacy. But the\r\nverge had never been crossed. It was the younger man who always drew\r\nback. The Bishop, with the instinct of the true priest, had an unshaken\r\nbelief in his cynical neighbor. Lord Newhaven, who trusted no one,\r\ntrusted the Bishop. They might have been friends. But there was a deeper\r\nreason for grief at his death than any sense of personal loss. The\r\nBishop was secretly convinced that he had died by his own hand.\r\n\r\nLord Newhaven had come to see him, the night he left Westhope, on his\r\nway to the station. He had only stayed a few minutes, and had asked him\r\nto do him a trifling service. The older man had agreed, had seen a\r\nmomentary hesitation as Lord Newhaven turned to leave the room, and had\r\nforgotten the incident immediately in the press of continuous business.\r\nBut with the news of his death the remembrance of that momentary\r\ninterview returned, and with it the instant conviction that that\r\naccidental death had been carefully planned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now Hester\'s visit at the Palace had come to an end, and the\r\nBishop\'s carriage was taking her back to Warpington.\r\n\r\nThe ten days at Southminster had brought a little color back to her thin\r\ncheeks, a little calmness to her glance. She had experienced the\r\nrest--better than sleep--of being understood, of being able to say what\r\nshe thought without fear of giving offence. The Bishop\'s hospitality had\r\nbeen extended to her mind, instead of stopping short at the menu.\r\n\r\nHer hands were full of chrysanthemums which the Bishop had picked for\r\nher himself; her small head full of his parting words and counsel.\r\n\r\nYes, she would do as he so urgently advised, give up the attempt to live\r\nat Warpington. She had been there a whole year. If the project had\r\nfailed, as he seemed to think it had, at any rate, it had been given a\r\nfair trial. Both sides had done their best. She might ease money matters\r\nlater for her brother by laying by part of the proceeds of this book for\r\nRegie\'s schooling. She could see that the Bishop thought highly of the\r\nbook. He had read it before it was sent to the publisher. While she was\r\nat the Palace he had asked her to reconsider one or two passages in it\r\nwhich he thought might give needless offence to her brother and others\r\nof his mental calibre, and she had complied at once, and had sent for\r\nthe book. No doubt she should find it at Warpington on her return.\r\n\r\nWhen it was published she should give Minna a new sofa for the\r\ndrawing-room, and Fr\xe4ulein a fur boa and muff, and Miss Brown a\r\ntype-writer for her G.F.S. work, and Abel a barometer, and each of the\r\nservants a new gown, and James those four enormous volumes of Pusey for\r\nwhich his soul yearned. And what should she give Rachel--dear Rachel?\r\nAh! What need to give her anything? The book itself was hers. Was it not\r\ndedicated to her? And she would make her home with Rachel for the\r\npresent, as the Bishop advised, as Rachel had so urgently begged her to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n"And we will go abroad together after Christmas as she suggests," said\r\nHester to herself. "We will go to Madeira, or one of those warm places\r\nwhere one can sit like a cat in the sun, and do nothing, nothing,\r\nnothing, from morning till night. I used to be so afraid of going back\r\nto Warpington, but now that the time is coming to an end I am sure I\r\nshall not irritate them so much. And Minna will be glad. One can always\r\nmanage if it is only for a fixed time. And they shall not be the losers\r\nby my leaving them. I will put by the money for my little Regie. I shall\r\nfeel parting with him."\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting as she reached Warpington. All was gray, the church\r\ntower, the trees, the pointed gables of the Vicarage, set small\r\ntogether, as in a Christmas card, against the still red sky. It only\r\nneeded "Peace and Good-will" and a robin in the foreground to be\r\ncomplete. The stream was the only thing that moved, with its shimmering\r\nmesh of fire-tipped ripples fleeing into the darkness of the reeds. The\r\nlittle bridge, so vulgar in every-day life, leaned a mystery of darkness\r\nover a mystery of light. The white frost held the meadows, and binding\r\nthem to the gray house and church and bare trees was a thin floating\r\nribbon of--was it mist or smoke? In her own window a faint light\r\nwavered. They had lit a fire in her room. Hester\'s heart warmed to her\r\nsister-in-law at that little token of care and welcome. Minna should\r\nhave all her flowers, except one small bunch for Fr\xe4ulein. In another\r\nmoment she was ringing the bell, and Emma\'s smiling red face appeared\r\nbehind the glass door.\r\n\r\nHester ran past her into the drawing-room. Mrs. Gresley was sitting near\r\nthe fire with the old baby beside her. She returned Hester\'s kiss\r\nsomewhat nervously. She looked a little frightened.\r\n\r\nThe old baby, luxuriously seated in his own little arm-chair, rose, and\r\nholding it firmly against his small person to prevent any disconnection\r\nwith it, solemnly crossed the hearth-rug, and placed the chair with\r\nhimself in it by Hester.\r\n\r\n"You would like some tea," said Mrs. Gresley. "It is choir practice this\r\nevening, and we don\'t have supper till nine."\r\n\r\nBut Hester had had tea before she started.\r\n\r\n"And you are not cold?"\r\n\r\nHester was quite warm. The Bishop had ordered a foot-warmer in the\r\ncarriage for her.\r\n\r\n"You are looking much better."\r\n\r\nHester felt much better, thanks.\r\n\r\n"And what lovely flowers!"\r\n\r\nHester suggested, with diffidence, that they would look pretty in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Mrs. Gresley, who had thought the same till that\r\ninstant, "that they would look best in the hall."\r\n\r\n"And the rest of the family," said Hester, whose face had fallen a\r\nlittle. "Where are they?"\r\n\r\n"The children have just come in. They will be down directly. Come back\r\nto me, Toddy; you are boring your aunt. And James is in his study."\r\n\r\n"Is he busy, or may I go in and speak to him?"\r\n\r\n"He is not busy. He is expecting you."\r\n\r\nHester gathered up her rejected flowers and rose. She felt as if she had\r\nbeen back at Warpington a year--as if she had never been away.\r\n\r\nShe stopped a moment in the hall to look at her letters, and laid down\r\nher flowers beside them. Then she went on quickly to the study, and\r\ntapped at the door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said the well-known voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was found writing. Hester instantly perceived that it was a\r\npose, and that he had taken up the pen when he heard her tap.\r\n\r\nHer spirits sank a peg lower.\r\n\r\n"He is going to lecture me about something," she said to herself, as he\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n"Have you had tea? It is choir practice this evening, and we don\'t have\r\nsupper till nine."\r\n\r\nHester had had tea before she started.\r\n\r\n"And you are not cold?"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Hester was quite warm, thanks. Bishop, foot-warmer,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n"You are looking much stronger."\r\n\r\nHester felt much stronger. Certainly married people grew very much alike\r\nby living together.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley hesitated. He never saw the difficulties entailed by any\r\naction until they were actually upon him. He had had no idea he would\r\nfind it wellnigh impossible to open a certain subject.\r\n\r\nHester involuntarily came to his assistance.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps I ought to look at my letters. By the way, there ought to\r\nbe a large package for me from Bentham. It was not with my letters.\r\nPerhaps you sent it to my room."\r\n\r\n"It did arrive," said Mr. Gresley, "and perhaps I ought to apologize,\r\nfor I saw my name on it and I opened it by mistake. I was expecting some\r\nmore copies of my _Modern Dissent_."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I have no doubt you put it away safely. Where is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Having opened it, I glanced at it."\r\n\r\n"I am surprised to hear that," said Hester, a pink spot appearing on\r\neach cheek, and her eyes darkening. "When did I give you leave to read\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley looked dully at his sister, and went on without noticing her\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"I glanced at it. I do not see any difference between reading a book in\r\nmanuscript or in print. I don\'t pretend to quibble on a point like that.\r\nAfter looking at it, I felt that it was desirable I should read the\r\nwhole. You may remember, Hester, that I showed you my _Modern Dissent_.\r\nIf I did not make restrictions, why should you?"\r\n\r\n"The thing is done," said Hester. "I did not wish you to read it, and\r\nyou have read it. It can\'t be helped. We won\'t speak of it again."\r\n\r\n"It is my duty to speak of it."\r\n\r\nHester made an impatient movement.\r\n\r\n"But it is not mine to listen," she said. "Besides, I know all you are\r\ngoing to say--the same as about _The Idyll_, only worse. That it is\r\ncoarse and profane and exaggerated, and that I have put in improprieties\r\nin order to make it sell, and that I run down the clergy, and that the\r\nbook ought never to be published. Dear James, spare me. You and I shall\r\nnever agree on certain subjects. Let us be content to differ."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley was disconcerted. Your antagonist has no business to\r\ndiscount all you were going to remark by saying it first.\r\n\r\nHis color was gradually leaving him. This was worse than an Easter\r\nvestry meeting, and that was saying a good deal.\r\n\r\n"I cannot stand by calmly and see you walk over a precipice if I can\r\nforcibly hold you back," he said. "I think, Hester, you forget that it\r\nis my affection for you that makes me try to restrain you. It is for\r\nyour own sake that--that--"\r\n\r\n"That what?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot allow this book to be published," said Mr. Gresley, in a\r\nlow voice. He hardly ever lowered his voice.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s pause. Hester felt the situation was serious. How\r\nnot to wound him, yet not to yield?\r\n\r\n"I am eight-and-twenty," she said. "I am afraid I must follow my own\r\njudgment. You have no responsibility in the matter. If I am blamed," she\r\nsmiled proudly--at that instant she knew all that her book was\r\nworth--"the blame will not attach to you. And, after all, Minna and the\r\nPratts and the Thursbys need not read it."\r\n\r\n"No one will read it," said Mr. Gresley. "It was a profane, wicked book.\r\nNo one will read it."\r\n\r\n"I am not so sure of that," said Hester.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister looked at each other with eyes of flint.\r\n\r\n"No one will read it," repeated Mr. Gresley--he was courageous, but all\r\nhis courage was only just enough--"because, for your own sake, and for\r\nthe sake of the innocent minds which might be perverted by it, I have--I\r\nhave--burned it."\r\n\r\nHester stood motionless, like one struck by lightning, livid, dead\r\nalready--all but the eyes.\r\n\r\n"You dared not," said the dead lips. The terrible eyes were fixed on\r\nhim. They burned into him.\r\n\r\nHe was frightened.\r\n\r\n"Dear Hester," he said, "I will help you to rewrite it. I will give up\r\nan hour every morning till--" Would she never fall? Would she always\r\nstand up like that? "Some day you will know I was right to do it. You\r\nare angry now, but some day--" If she would only faint, or cry, or look\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"When Regie was ill," said the slow, difficult voice, "I did what I\r\ncould. I did not let your child die. Why have you killed mine?"\r\n\r\nThere was a little patter of feet in the passage. The door was slowly\r\nopened by Mary, and Regie walked solemnly in, holding with extreme care\r\na small tin-plate, on which reposed a large potato.\r\n\r\n"I baked it for you, Auntie Hester," he said, in his shrill voice, his\r\neyes on the offering. "It was my very own \'tato Abel gave me. And I\r\nbaked it in the bonfire and kept it for you."\r\n\r\nHester turned upon the child like some blinded, infuriated animal at\r\nbay, and thrust him violently from her. He fell shrieking. She rushed\r\npast him out of the room, and out of the house, his screams following\r\nher. "I\'ve killed him," she said.\r\n\r\nThe side gate was locked. Abel had just left for the night. She tore it\r\noff its hinges and ran into the back-yard.\r\n\r\nThe bonfire was out. A thread of smoke twisted up from the crater of\r\ngray ashes. She fell on her knees beside the dead fire, and thrust apart\r\nthe hot embers with her bare hands.\r\n\r\nA mass of thin black films that had once been paper met her eyes. The\r\nsmall writing on them was plainly visible as they fell to dust at the\r\ntouch of her hands.\r\n\r\n"It is dead," she said in a loud voice, getting up. Her gown was burned\r\nthrough where she had knelt down.\r\n\r\nIn the still air a few flakes of snow were falling in a great\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n"Quite dead," said Hester. "Regie and the book."\r\n\r\nAnd she set off running blindly across the darkening fields.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was close on eleven o\'clock. The Bishop was sitting alone in his\r\nstudy writing. The night was very still. The pen travelled, travelled.\r\nThe fire had burned down to a red glow. Presently he got up, walked to\r\nthe window, and drew aside the curtain.\r\n\r\n"The first snow," he said, half aloud.\r\n\r\nIt was coming down gently, through the darkness. He could just see the\r\nwhite rim on the stone sill outside.\r\n\r\n"I can do no more to-night," he said, and he bent to lock his\r\ndespatch-box with the key on his watch-chain.\r\n\r\nThe door suddenly opened. He turned to see a little figure rush towards\r\nhim, and fall at his feet, holding him convulsively by the knees.\r\n\r\n"Hester!" he said, in amazement. "Hester!"\r\n\r\nShe was bareheaded. The snow was upon her hair and shoulders. She\r\nbrought in the smell of fire with her.\r\n\r\nHe tried to raise her, but she held him tightly with her bleeding hands,\r\nlooking up at him with a convulsed face. His own hands were red, as he\r\nvainly tried to loosen hers.\r\n\r\n"They have killed my book," she said. "They have killed my book. They\r\nburned it alive when I was away. And my head went. I don\'t know what I\r\ndid, but I think I killed Regie. I know I meant to."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n     "Is it well with the child?"\r\n\r\n\r\n"I am not really anxious," said Mr. Gresley, looking out across the\r\nVicarage laurels to the white fields and hedges. All was blurred and\r\nvague and very still. The only thing that had a distinct outline was the\r\ngarden railing, with a solitary rook on it.\r\n\r\n"I am not really anxious," he said again, sitting down at the\r\nbreakfast-table. But his face contradicted him. It was blue and pinched,\r\nfor he had just returned from reading the morning service to himself in\r\nan ice-cold church, but there was a pucker in the brow that was not the\r\nresult of cold. The Vicarage porch had fallen down in the night, but he\r\nwas evidently not thinking of that. He drank a little coffee, and then\r\ngot up and walked to the window again.\r\n\r\n"She is with the Pratts," he said, with decision. "I am glad I sent a\r\nnote over early, if it will relieve your mind, but I am convinced she is\r\nwith the Pratts."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley murmured something. She looked scared. She made an attempt\r\nto eat something, but it was a mere pretence.\r\n\r\nThe swing door near the back staircase creaked. In the Vicarage you\r\ncould hear everything.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gresley looked eagerly at the door. The parlor-maid came in\r\nwith a note between her finger and thumb.\r\n\r\n"She is not there," said Mr. Gresley, in a shaking voice. "I wrote Mr.\r\nPratt such a guarded letter, saying Hester had imprudently run across to\r\nsee them on her return home, and how grateful I was to Mrs. Pratt for\r\nnot allowing her to return, as it had begun to snow. He says he and Mrs.\r\nPratt have not seen her."\r\n\r\n"James," said Mrs. Gresley, "where _is_ she?"\r\n\r\nA second step shuffled across the hail, and Fr\xe4ulein stood in the\r\ndoor-way. Her pale face was drawn with anxiety. In both hands she\r\nclutched a trailing skirt plastered with snow, hitched above a pair of\r\nlarge goloshed feet, into which the legs were grafted without ankles.\r\n\r\n"She has not return?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Gresley, "and she is not with the Pratts."\r\n\r\n"I know always she is not wiz ze Pratts," said Fr\xe4ulein, scornfully.\r\n"She never go to Pratt if she is in grief. I go out at half seven this\r\nmorning to ze Br-r-rowns, but Miss Br-r-rown know nozing. I go to\r\nWilderleigh, I see Mrs. Loftus still in bed, but she is not there. I go\r\nto Evannses, I go to Smeeth, I go last to Mistair Valsh, but she is not\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley began to experience something of what Fr\xe4ulein had been\r\nenduring all night.\r\n\r\n"She would certainly not go from my house to a Dissenter\'s," he said,\r\nstiffly. "You might have saved yourself the trouble of calling there,\r\nFr\xe4ulein."\r\n\r\n"She like Mr. and Mrs. Valsh. She gives them her book."\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein\'s voice drowned the muffled rumbling of a carriage and a ring\r\nat the bell, the handle of which, uninjured amid the chaos, kept watch\r\nabove the remains of the late porch.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop stood a moment in the little hall, while the maid went into\r\nthe dining-room to tell the Gresleys of his arrival. His eyes rested on\r\nthe pile of letters on the table, on the dead flowers beside them. They\r\nhad been so beautiful yesterday when he gave them to Hester. Hester\r\nherself had been so pretty yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe maid came back and asked him to "step" into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gresley had risen from their chairs. Their eyes were fixed\r\nanxiously upon him. Fr\xe4ulein gave a little shriek and rushed at him.\r\n\r\n"She is viz you?" she gasped, shaking him by the arm.\r\n\r\n"She is with me," said the Bishop, looking only at Fr\xe4ulein, and taking\r\nher shaking hands in his.\r\n\r\n"Thank God," said Mr. Gresley, and Mrs. Gresley sat down and began to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nSome of the sternness melted out of the Bishop\'s face as he looked at\r\nthe young couple.\r\n\r\n"I came as soon as I could," he said. "I started soon after seven, but\r\nthe roads are heavy."\r\n\r\n"This is a great relief," said Mr. Gresley. He began on his deepest\r\norgan note, but it quavered quite away on the word relief for want of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n"How is Regie?" said the Bishop. It was his turn to be anxious.\r\n\r\n"Regie is verr vell," said Fr\xe4ulein, with decision. "Tell her he is so\r\nvell as he vas."\r\n\r\n"He is very much shaken," said Mrs. Gresley, indignant mother-love\r\nflashing in her wet eyes. "He is a delicate child, and she, Hester--may\r\nGod forgive her!--struck him in one of her passions. She might have\r\nkilled him. And the poor child fell and bruised his arm and shoulder.\r\nAnd he was bringing her a little present when she did it. The child had\r\ndone nothing whatever to annoy her, had he, James?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Mr. Gresley, and his conscience pricking him, he added,\r\n"I must own Hester had always seemed fond of Regie till last night."\r\n\r\nHe felt that it would not be entirely fair to allow the Bishop to think\r\nthat Hester was in the habit of maltreating the children.\r\n\r\n"I have told him that his own mother will take care of him," said Mrs.\r\nGresley, "and that he need not be afraid, his aunt shall never come back\r\nagain. When I saw his little arm I felt I could never trust Hester in\r\nthe house again." As Mrs. Gresley spoke she felt she was making\r\ncertainty doubly sure that the woman of whom she was jealous would\r\nreturn no more.\r\n\r\n"Regie cry till his \'ead ache because you say Miss Gresley no come\r\nback," said Fr\xe4ulein, looking at Mrs. Gresley, as if she would have\r\nbitten a piece out of her.\r\n\r\n"I think, Fr\xe4ulein, it is the children\'s lesson-time," said Mr. Gresley,\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\nWho could have imagined that unobtrusive, submissive Fr\xe4ulein, gentlest\r\nand shyest of women, would put herself forward in this aggressive\r\nmanner. The truth is, it is all very well to talk, you never can tell\r\nwhat people will do. They suddenly turn round and act exactly opposite\r\nto their whole previous character. Look at Fr\xe4ulein!\r\n\r\nThat poor lady, recalled thus to a sense of duty, hurried from the room,\r\nand the Bishop, who had opened the door for her, closed it gently behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"You must excuse her, my lord," said Mr. Gresley; "the truth is, we are\r\nall somewhat upset this morning. Hester would have saved us much\r\nuneasiness, I may say anxiety, if she had mentioned to us yesterday\r\nevening that she was going back to you. No doubt she overtook your\r\ncarriage, which put up at the inn for half an hour."\r\n\r\n"No," said the Bishop, "she came on foot. She--walked all the way."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley smiled. "I am afraid, my lord, Hester has given you an\r\ninaccurate account. I assure you, she is incapable of walking five\r\nmiles, much less ten."\r\n\r\n"She took about five hours to do it," said the Bishop, who had hesitated\r\nan instant, as if swallowing something unpalatable. "In moments of great\r\nexcitement nervous persons like your sister are capable of almost\r\nanything. The question is, whether she will survive the shock that drove\r\nher out of your house last night. Her hands are severely burned. Dr.\r\nBrown, whom I left with her, fears brain fever."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop paused, giving his words time to sink in. Then he went on\r\nslowly in a level voice, looking into the fire.\r\n\r\n"She still thinks that she has killed Regie. She won\'t believe the\r\ndoctor and me when we assure her she has not. She turns against us for\r\ndeceiving her."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley wrestled with a very bitter feeling towards his sister,\r\novercame it, and said, hoarsely:\r\n\r\n"Tell her from me that Regie is not much the worse, and tell her that\r\nI--that his mother and I--forgive her."\r\n\r\n"Not me, James," sobbed Mrs. Gresley. "It is too soon. I don\'t. I can\'t.\r\nIf I said I did I should not feel it."\r\n\r\n"Hester is not in a condition to receive messages," said the Bishop.\r\n"She would not believe them. Dr. Brown says the only thing we can do for\r\nher is to show Regie to her. If she sees him she may believe her own\r\neyes, and this frightful excitement may be got under. I came to take him\r\nback with me now in the carriage."\r\n\r\n"I will not let him go," said Mrs. Gresley, the mother in her overriding\r\nher awe of the Bishop. "I am sorry if Hester is ill. I will"--and Mrs.\r\nGresley made a superhuman effort--"I will come and nurse her myself, but\r\nI won\'t have Regie frightened a second time."\r\n\r\n"He shall not be frightened a second time. But it is very urgent. While\r\nwe are wasting time talking, Hester\'s life is ebbing away as surely as\r\nif she were bleeding to death. If she were actually bleeding in this\r\nroom how quickly you two would run to her and bind up the wound. There\r\nwould be nothing you would not do to relieve her suffering."\r\n\r\n"If I would let Regie go," said Mrs. Gresley, "he would not be willing,\r\nand we could not have him taken away by force, could we, James?"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Regie appeared, gently pushed from behind by\r\nFr\xe4ulein\'s thin hand. Boulou followed. The door was closed again\r\nimmediately, almost on Boulou\'s tail.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and Regie looked hard at each other.\r\n\r\n"I send my love to Auntie Hester," said Regie, in his catechism voice,\r\n"and I am quite well."\r\n\r\n"I should like to have some conversation with Regie alone," said the\r\nBishop.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley wavered, but the Bishop\'s eye remained fixed on Mr.\r\nGresley, and the latter led his wife away. The door was left ajar, but\r\nthe Bishop closed it. Then he sat down by the fire and held out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nRegie went up to him fearlessly, and stood between his knees. The two\r\nfaces were exactly on the same level. Boulou sat down before the fire,\r\nhis tail uncurling in the heat.\r\n\r\n"Auntie Hester is very sorry," said the Bishop. "She is so sorry that\r\nshe can\'t even cry."\r\n\r\n"Tell her not to mind," said Regie.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good telling her. Does your arm hurt much?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Mother says it does, and Fr\xe4ulein says it doesn\'t. But it\r\nisn\'t that."\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that, or the \'tato being lost, it was only crumbs afterwards;\r\nbut, Mr. Bishop, _I hadn\'t done nothing_."\r\n\r\nRegie looked into the kind keen eyes, and his own little red ones filled\r\nagain with tears.\r\n\r\n"I had not done nothing," he repeated. "And I\'d kept my \'tato for her.\r\nIt\'s that--that--I don\'t mind about my arm. I\'m Christian soldiers about\r\nmy arm; but it\'s that--that--"\r\n\r\n"That hurts you in your heart," said the Bishop, putting his arm round\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Regie, producing a tight little ball that had once been a\r\nhandkerchief. "Auntie Hester and I were such friends. I told her all my\r\nsecrets, and she told me hers. I knew long before, when she gave father\r\nthe silver cream-jug, and about Fr\xe4ulein\'s muff. If it was a mistake,\r\nlike father treading on my foot at the school-feast, I should not mind,\r\nbut she did it on purpose."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s brow contracted. Time was ebbing away, ebbing away like a\r\nlife. Yet Dr. Brown\'s warning remained in his ears. "If the child is\r\nfrightened of her, and screams when he sees her, I won\'t answer for the\r\nconsequences."\r\n\r\n"Is that your little dog?" he said, after a moment\'s thought.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is Boulou."\r\n\r\n"Was he ever in a trap?" asked the Bishop, with a vague recollection of\r\nthe ways of clergymen\'s dogs, those "little rifts within the lute,"\r\nwhich so often break the harmony between a sporting squire and his\r\nclergyman.\r\n\r\n"He was once. Mr. Pratt says he hunts, but father says not, that he\r\ncould not catch anything if he tried."\r\n\r\n"I had a dog once," said the Bishop, "called Jock. And he got in a trap\r\nlike Boulou did. Now, Jock loved me. He cared for me more than anybody\r\nin the world. Yet, as I was letting him out of the trap, he bit me. Do\r\nyou know why he did that?"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because the trap hurt him so dreadfully that he could not help biting\r\nsomething. He did not really mean it. He licked me afterwards. Now,\r\nAuntie Hester was like Jock. She was in dreadful, dreadful pain like a\r\ntrap, and she hit you like Jock bit me. But Jock loved me best in the\r\nworld all the time. And Auntie Hester loves you, and is your friend she\r\ntells secrets to, all the time."\r\n\r\n"Mother says she does not love me really. It was only pretence." Regie\'s\r\nvoice shook. "Mother says she must never come back, because it might be\r\nbaby next. She said so to father."\r\n\r\n"Mother has made a mistake. I\'m so old that I know better even than\r\nmother. Auntie Hester loves you, and can\'t eat any breakfast till you\r\ntell her you don\'t mind. Will you come with me and kiss her, and tell\r\nher so? And we\'ll make up a new secret on the way."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Regie, eagerly, his wan little face turning pink. "But\r\nmother?" he said, stopping short.\r\n\r\n"Run and get your coat on. I will speak to mother. Quick, Regie."\r\n\r\nRegie rushed curveting out of the room. The Bishop followed more slowly,\r\nand went into the drawing-room where Mr. and Mrs. Gresley were sitting\r\nby the fireless hearth. The drawing-room fire was never lit till two\r\no\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Regie goes with me of his own free will," he said; "so that is settled.\r\nHe will be quite safe with me, Mrs. Gresley."\r\n\r\n"My wife demurs at sending him," said Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"No, no, she does not," said the Bishop, gently. "Hester saved Regie\'s\r\nlife, and it is only right that Regie should save hers. You will come\r\nover this afternoon to take him back," he continued to Mr. Gresley. "I\r\nwish to have some conversation with you."\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein appeared breathless, dragging Regie with her.\r\n\r\n"He has not got on his new overcoat," said Mrs. Gresley. "Regie, run up\r\nand change at once."\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein actually said, "Bozzer ze new coat," and she swept Regie into\r\nthe carriage, the Bishop following, stumbling over the ruins of the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\n"Have they had their hot mash?" he said to the coachman, who was tearing\r\noff the horses\' clothing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Then drive all you know. Put them at the hills at a gallop."\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein pressed a packet of biscuits into the Bishop\'s hand. "He eat no\r\nbreakfast," she said.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Dick said the porch would sit down, and it has," said Regie, in\r\nan awe-struck voice, as the carriage swayed from side to side of the\r\nroad. "Father knows a great deal, but sometimes I think Uncle Dick knows\r\nmost of all. First gates and flying half-pennies, and now porches."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Dick is staying in Southminster. Perhaps we shall see him."\r\n\r\n"I should like to ask him about his finger, if it isn\'t a secret."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is. Now, what secret shall we make up on the way?" The\r\nBishop put his head out of the window. "Drive faster," he said.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the secret should be a Christmas-present for\r\n"Auntie Hester," to be bought in Southminster. The Bishop found that\r\nRegie\'s entire capital was sixpence. But Regie explained that he could\r\nspend a shilling, because he was always given sixpence by his father\r\nwhen he pulled a tooth out. "And I\'ve one loose now," he said. "When I\r\nsuck it it moves. It will be ready by Christmas."\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence. The horses\' hoofs beat the muffled ground all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you find, Mr. Bishop," said Regie, tentatively, "that this riding\r\nso quick in carriages and talking secrets does make people very hungry?"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop blushed. "It is quite true, my boy. I ought to have thought\r\nof that before. I am uncommonly hungry myself," he said, looking in\r\nevery pocket for the biscuits Fr\xe4ulein had forced into his hand. When\r\nthey were at last discovered, in a somewhat dilapidated condition in the\r\nrug, the Bishop found they were a kind of biscuit that always made him\r\ncough, so he begged Regie, who was dividing them equally, as a personal\r\nfavor, to eat them all.\r\n\r\nIt was a crumb be-sprinkled Bishop who, half an hour later, hurried up\r\nthe stairs of the Palace.\r\n\r\n"What an age you have been," snapped Dr. Brown, from the landing.\r\n\r\n"How is she?"\r\n\r\n"The same, but weaker. Have you got Regie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it took time."\r\n\r\n"Is he frightened?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit."\r\n\r\n"Then bring him up."\r\n\r\nThe doctor went back into the bedroom, leaving the door ajar.\r\n\r\nA small shrunken figure with bandaged head and hands was sitting in an\r\narm-chair. The eyes of the rigid, discolored face were fixed.\r\n\r\nDr. Brown took the bandage off Hester\'s head, and smoothed her hair.\r\n\r\n"He is coming up-stairs now," he said, shaking her gently by the\r\nshoulders. "Regie is coming up-stairs now to see you. Regie is quite\r\nwell, and he is coming in now to see you."\r\n\r\n"Regie is dead, you old gray wolf," said Hester, in a monotonous voice.\r\n"I killed him in the back-yard. The place is quite black, and it\r\nsmokes."\r\n\r\n"Look at the door," repeated Dr. Brown, over and over again. "He is\r\ncoming in at the door now."\r\n\r\nHester trembled, and looked at the door. The doctor noticed, with a\r\nfrown, that she could hardly move her eyes.\r\n\r\nRegie stood in the doorway, holding the Bishop\'s hand. The cold snow\r\nlight fell upon the gallant little figure and white face.\r\n\r\nThe doctor moved between Hester and the window. His shadow was upon her.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the two men beat like hammers.\r\n\r\nA change came over Hester\'s face.\r\n\r\n"My little Reg," she said, holding out her bandaged hands.\r\n\r\nRegie ran to her, and put his arms round her neck. They clasped each\r\nother tightly. The doctor winced to watch her hands.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, Auntie Hester," said Regie. "I love you just the same,\r\nand you must not cry any more."\r\n\r\nFor Hester\'s tears were falling at last, quenching the wild fire in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"My little treasure, my little mouse," she said, over and over again,\r\nkissing his face and hands and little brown overcoat.\r\n\r\nThen all in a moment her face altered. Her agonized eyes turned to the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Dr. Brown\'s hand was over Regie\'s eyes, and he hurried him\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n"Take him out of hearing," he whispered to the Bishop, and darted back.\r\n\r\nHester was tearing the bandages off her hands.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what has happened," she wailed, "but my hands hurt me so\r\nthat I can\'t bear it."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" said the old doctor, blowing his nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n     The Devil has no stancher ally than _want of perception_.--PHILIP\r\n     H. WICKSTEED.\r\n\r\n     It takes two to speak truth--one to speak and another to\r\n     hear.--THOREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley had passed an uncomfortable day. In the afternoon all the\r\nPratts had called, and Mr. Gresley, who departed early in the afternoon\r\nfor Southminster, had left his wife no directions as to how to act in\r\nthis unforseen occurrence, or how to parry the questions with which she\r\nwas overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nAfter long hesitation she at last owned that Hester had returned to\r\nSouthminster in the Bishop\'s carriage not more than half an hour after\r\nit had brought her back.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain Hester\'s actions," she would only repeat over and over\r\nagain. "I don\'t pretend to understand clever people. I\'m not clever\r\nmyself. I can only say Hester went back to Southminster directly she\r\narrived here."\r\n\r\nHardly had the Pratts taken their departure when Doll Loftus was ushered\r\nin. His wife had sent him to ask where Hester was, as Fr\xe4ulein had\r\nalarmed her earlier in the day. Doll at least asked no questions. He had\r\nnever asked but one in his life, and that had been of his wife, five\r\nseconds before he had become engaged to her.\r\n\r\nHe accepted with equanimity the information that Hester had returned to\r\nSouthminster, and departed to impart the same to his exasperated wife.\r\n\r\n"But why did she go back? She had only that moment arrived," inquired\r\nSybell. How should Doll know. She, Sybell, had said she could not rest\r\ntill she knew where Hester was, and he, Doll, had walked to Warpington\r\nthrough the snow-drifts to find out for her. And he had found out, and\r\nnow she wanted to know something else. There was no satisfying some\r\nwomen. And the injured husband retired to unlace his boots.\r\n\r\nYes, Mrs. Gresley had passed an uncomfortable day. She had ventured out\r\nfor a few minutes, and had found Abel, with his arms akimbo;\r\ncontemplating the little gate which led to the stables. It was lying on\r\nthe ground. He had swept the snow off it.\r\n\r\n"I locked it up the same as usual last night," he said to Mrs. Gresley.\r\n"There\'s been somebody about as has tampered it off its hinges. Yet\r\nnothing hasn\'t been touched, the coal nor the stack. It doesn\'t seem\r\nnatural, twisting the gate off for nothing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley did not answer. She did not associate Hester with the gate.\r\nBut she was too much perturbed to care about such small matters at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"His lordship\'s coachman tell me as Miss Gresley was at the Palace,"\r\ncontinued Abel, "while I was a hotting up his mash for him, for William\r\nhad gone in with a note, and onst he\'s in the kitchen the hanimals might\r\nbe stocks and stones for what he cares. He said his nevvy, the footman,\r\nheard the front door-bell ring just as he was getting into bed last\r\nnight, and Miss Gresley come in without her hat, with the snow upon her.\r\nThe coachman said as she must ha\' run afoot all the way."\r\n\r\nAbel looked anxiously at Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking," he said, "as perhaps the little lady wasn\'t quite\r\nright in her \'ead. They do say as too much learning flies to the \'ead,\r\nthe same as spirits to them as ain\'t manured to \'em. And the little lady\r\ndoes work desperate hard."\r\n\r\n"Not as hard as Mr. Gresley," said Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"Maybe not, mem, maybe not. But when I come up when red cow was sick at\r\nfour in the morning, or maybe earlier, there was always a light in her\r\nwinder, and the shadder of her face agin the blind. Yes, she do work\r\nprecious hard."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley retreated into the house, picking her way over the debris\r\nof the porch. At any other time its demise would have occupied the minds\r\nof the Vicarage household for days. But, until this moment, it had\r\nhardly claimed the tribute of a sigh. Mrs. Gresley did sigh as she\r\ncrossed the threshold. That prostrate porch meant expense. She had\r\nunderstood from her husband that Dick had wantonly torn out the clamp\r\nthat supported it, and that the whole thing had in consequence given way\r\nunder the first snowfall. "He meant no harm," Mr. Gresley had added,\r\n"but I suppose in the Colonies they mistake horse-play for wit."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley went back to the drawing-room, and sat down to her\r\nneedle-work. She was an exquisite needlewoman, but all the activity of\r\nher untiring hands was hardly able to stem the tide of mending that was\r\nfor ever flowing in upon her. When was she to find time to finish the\r\ndarling little garments which the new baby required? Fr\xe4ulein had been\r\nkind in helping, but Fr\xe4ulein\'s eyes are not very strong, or her\r\nstitches in consequence very small. Mrs. Gresley would have liked to sit\r\nin the school-room when lessons were over, but Fr\xe4ulein had been so\r\ndistant at luncheon about a rissole that she had not the courage to go\r\nin.\r\n\r\nSo she sat and stitched with a heavy heart awaiting her husband\'s\r\nreturn. The fly was another expense. Southminster was ten miles from\r\nWarpington, eleven according to the Loftus Arms, from which it issued,\r\nthe owner of which was not on happy terms with his "teetotal" vicar. Yet\r\nit had been absolutely necessary to have the fly, in order that Regie,\r\nwho so easily caught cold, might return in safety.\r\n\r\nThe dusk was already falling, and more snow with it.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Mrs. Gresley at last caught the sound of wheels,\r\nand hurried to the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley came in, bearing Regie, fast asleep in a fur rug, and laid\r\nhim carefully on the sofa, and then went out to have an altercation with\r\nthe driver, who demurred in forcible language to the arrangement,\r\nadhered to by Mr. Gresley, that the cost of the fly should be considered\r\nas part payment of certain arrears of tithe which in those days it was\r\nthe unhappy duty of the clergyman to collect himself. Mr. Gresley\'s\r\nmethods of dealing with money matters generally brought in a high rate\r\nof interest in the way of friction, and it was a long time before the\r\ndriver drove away, turning his horse deliberately on the little patch of\r\nlawn under the dining-room windows.\r\n\r\nRegie in the meanwhile had waked up, and was having tea in the\r\ndrawing-room as a great treat.\r\n\r\nHe had much to tell about his expedition; how the Bishop had given him\r\nhalf-a-crown, and Uncle Dick had taken him into the town to spend it,\r\nand how after dinner he had ridden on Uncle Dick\'s back.\r\n\r\n"And Auntie Hester. How was she?"\r\n\r\n"She was very well, only she cried a little. I did not stay long,\r\nbecause Mr. Bishop was wanting to give me the half-crown, and he kept it\r\ndown-stairs. And when I went in again she was in bed, and she was so\r\nsleepy she hardly said anything at all."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley came in wearily and dropped into a chair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley gave him his tea, and presently took Regie up-stairs. Then\r\nshe came back and sat down in a low chair close to her husband. It was\r\nthe first drop of comfort in Mr. Gresley\'s cup to-day.\r\n\r\n"How is Hester?"\r\n\r\n"According to Dr. Brown she is very ill," said Mr. Gresley, in an\r\nextinguished voice. "But they would not let me see her."\r\n\r\n"Not see her own brother! My dear James, you should have insisted."\r\n\r\n"I did, but it was no use. You know how angry Dr. Brown gets at the\r\nleast opposition. And the Bishop backed him up. They said it would\r\nexcite her."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of such a thing. What is the matter with her?"\r\n\r\n"Shock, Dr. Brown calls it. They have been afraid of collapse all day,\r\nbut she is better this evening. They seemed to think a great deal of her\r\nknowing Regie."\r\n\r\n"Did the little lamb forgive her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; he kissed her, and she knew him and cried. And it seems her\r\nhands are severely burned. They have got a nurse, and they have\r\ntelegraphed for Miss West. The Bishop was very good to Regie and gave\r\nhim that fur rug."\r\n\r\nThey looked at the splendid blue fox rug on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Mrs. Gresley, after a pause, "that Hester did run\r\nall the way to Southminster as the Bishop said. Abel said the Bishop\'s\r\ncoachman told him that she came late last night to the Palace, and she\r\nwas white with snow when the footman let her in."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I should have thought you were too sensible to listen to\r\nservant\'s gossip," said Mr. Gresley, impatiently. "Your own common-sense\r\nwill tell you that Hester never performed that journey on foot. I told\r\nDr. Brown the same, but he lost his temper at once. It\'s curious how\r\npatient he is in a sick-room, and how furious he can be out of it. He\r\nwas very angry with me, too, because when he mentioned to the Bishop in\r\nmy presence that Hester was under morphia, I said I strongly objected to\r\nher being drugged, and when I repeated that morphia was a most dangerous\r\ndrug, with effects worse than intoxication, in fact, that morphia was a\r\nform of intoxication, he positively, before the Bishop, shook his fist\r\nin my face, and said he was not going to be taught his business by me.\r\n\r\n"The Bishop took me away into the study. Dick Vernon was sitting there,\r\nat least he was creeping about on all fours with Regie on his back. I\r\nthink he must be in love with Hester, he asked so anxiously if there was\r\nany change. He would not speak to me, pretended not to know me. I\r\nsuppose the Bishop had told him about the porch, and he was afraid I\r\nshould come on him for repairs, as he had tampered with it. The Bishop\r\nsent them away, and said he wanted to have a talk with me. The Bishop\r\nhimself was the only person who was kind."\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Mrs. Gresley laid her soft cheek against her\r\nhusband\'s, and put her small hand in a protecting manner over his large\r\none. It was not surprising that on the following Sunday Mr. Gresley said\r\nsuch beautiful things about women being pillows against which weary\r\nmasculine athletes could rest.\r\n\r\n"He spoke very nicely of you," went on Mr. Gresley at last. "He said he\r\nappreciated your goodness in letting Regie go after what had happened,\r\nand your offer to come and nurse Hester yourself. And then he spoke\r\nabout me. And he said he knew well how devoted I was to my work, and how\r\nanything I did for the Church was a real labor of love, and that my\r\nheart was in my work."\r\n\r\n"It is quite true. So it is," said Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"I never thought he understood me so well. And he went on to say that he\r\nknew I must be dreadfully anxious about my sister, but that as far as\r\nmoney was concerned--I had offered to pay for a nurse--I was to put all\r\nanxiety off my mind. He would take all responsibility about the illness.\r\nHe said he had a little fund laid by for emergencies of this kind, and\r\nthat he could not spend it better than on Hester, whom he loved like his\r\nown child. And then he went on to speak of Hester. I don\'t remember all\r\nhe said when he turned off about her, but he spoke of her as if she were\r\na person quite out of the common."\r\n\r\n"He always did spoil her," said Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"He went off on a long rigmarole about her and her talent, and how vain\r\nhe and I should be if leading articles appeared in the _Spectator_ about\r\nus as they did about her. I did not know there had been anything of the\r\nkind, but he said every one else did. And then he went on more slowly\r\nthat Hester was under a foolish hallucination, as groundless, no doubt,\r\nas that she had caused Regie\'s death, that her book was destroyed. He\r\nsaid, \'It is this idea which has got firm hold of her, but which has\r\nmomentarily passed off her mind in her anxiety about Regie, which has\r\ncaused her illness.\' And then he looked at me. He seemed really quite\r\nshaky. He held on to a chair. I think his health is breaking."\r\n\r\n"And what did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I said the truth, that it was no hallucination but the fact, that much\r\nas I regretted to say so Hester had written a profane and immoral book,\r\nand that I had felt it my duty to burn it, and a very painful duty it\r\nhad been. I said he would have done the same if he had read it."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you said that."\r\n\r\n"Well, the awkward part was that he said he had read it, every word, and\r\nthat he considered it the finest book that had been written in his day.\r\nAnd then he began to walk up and down and to become rather excited, and\r\nto say that he could not understand how I could take upon myself such a\r\nresponsibility, or on what grounds I considered myself a judge of\r\nliterature. As if I ever did consider myself a judge! But I do know\r\nright from wrong. We had got on all right up till then, especially when\r\nhe spoke so cordially of you and me, but directly he made a personal\r\nmatter of Hester\'s book, setting his opinion against mine, for he\r\nrepeated over and over again it was a magnificent book, his manner\r\nseemed to change. He tried to speak kindly, but all the time I saw that\r\nmy considering the book bad while he thought it good, gravelled him, and\r\nmade him feel annoyed with me. The truth is, he can\'t bear any one to\r\nthink differently from himself."\r\n\r\n"He always was like that," said the comforter.\r\n\r\n"I said I supposed he thought it right to run down the clergy and hold\r\nthem up to ridicule. He said, \'Certainly not, but he did not see how\r\nthat applied to anything in Hester\'s book.\' He said, \'She has drawn us,\r\nwithout bias towards us, exactly as we appear to three-quarters of the\r\nlaity. It won\'t do us any harm to see ourselves for once as others see\r\nus. There is in these days an increasing adverse criticism of us in many\r\nmen\'s minds, to which your sister\'s mild rebukes are as nothing. We have\r\ndrawn it upon ourselves, not so much by our conduct, which I believe to\r\nbe uniformly above reproach, or by any lack of zeal, as by our ignorance\r\nof our calling; by our inability to "convert life into truth," the\r\ncapital secret of our profession, as I was once told as a divinity\r\nstudent. I for one believe that the Church will regain her prestige and\r\nher hold on the heart of the nation, but if she does, it will be mainly\r\ndue to a new element in the minds of the clergy, a stronger realization,\r\nnot of our responsibilities--we have that--but of the education, the\r\npersonal search for truth, the knowledge of human nature, which are\r\nnecessary to enable us to meet them.\' He went on a long time about that.\r\nI think he grows very wordy. But I did not argue with him. I let him say\r\nwhat he liked. I knew that I must be obedient to my Bishop, just as I\r\nshould expect my clergy to be to me, if I ever am a Bishop myself. Not\r\nthat I expect I ever shall be"--Mr. Gresley was overtired--"but it\r\nseemed to me as he talked about the book, that all the time, though he\r\nput me down to the highest motives--he did me that justice--he was\r\ntrying to make me own I had done wrong."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t say so?" said the little wife, hotly.\r\n\r\n"My dear, need you ask? But I did say at last that I had consulted with\r\nArchdeacon Thursby on the matter, and he had strongly advised me to do\r\nas I did. The Bishop seemed thunderstruck. And then--it really seemed\r\nprovidential--who should come in but Archdeacon Thursby himself. The\r\nBishop went straight up to him, and said, \'You come at a fortunate\r\nmoment, for I am greatly distressed at the burning of Miss Gresley\'s\r\nbook, and Gresley tells me that you advised it.\' And would you believe\r\nit," said Mr. Gresley, in a strangled voice, "the Archdeacon actually\r\ndenied it then and there. He said he did not know Hester had written a\r\nbook, and had never been consulted on the subject."\r\n\r\nThe tears forced themselves out of Mr. Gresley\'s eyes. He was exhausted\r\nand overwrought. He sobbed against his wife\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Wicked liar!" whispered Mrs. Gresley, into his parting. "Wicked,\r\nwicked man! Oh, James, I never thought the Archdeacon could have behaved\r\nlike that!"\r\n\r\n"Nor I," gasped Mr. Gresley, "but he did. I suppose he did not want to\r\noffend the Bishop. And when I expostulated with him, and reminded him of\r\nwhat he had advised only the day before, he said that was about a\r\nletter, not a book, as if it mattered which it was. It was the principle\r\nthat mattered. But they neither of them would listen to me. I said I had\r\noffered to help to rewrite it, and the Bishop became quite fierce. He\r\nsaid I might as well try to rewrite Regie if he were in his coffin. And\r\nthen he mentioned, casually, as if it were quite an afterthought, that\r\nHester had sold it for a thousand pounds. All through, I knew he was\r\nreally trying to hurt my feelings, in spite of his manner, but when he\r\nsaid _that_ he succeeded."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley groaned.\r\n\r\n"A thousand pounds!" said Mrs. Gresley, turning white. "Oh, it isn\'t\r\npossible!"\r\n\r\n"He said he had seen the publisher\'s letter offering it, and that Hester\r\nhad accepted it by his advice. He seemed to know all about her affairs.\r\nWhen he said that, I was so distressed I could not help showing it, and\r\nhe made rather light of it, saying the money loss was the least serious\r\npart of the whole affair, but, of course, it is the worst. Poor Hester,\r\nwhen I think that owing to me she has lost a thousand pounds. Seventy\r\npounds a year, if I had invested it for her, and I know of several good\r\ninvestments, all perfectly safe, at seven per cent.--when I think of it\r\nit makes me absolutely miserable. We won\'t talk of it any more. The\r\nBishop sat with his head in his hands for a long time after the\r\nArchdeacon had gone, and afterwards he was quite kindly again, and said\r\nwe looked at the subject from such different points of view that perhaps\r\nthere was no use in discussing it. And we talked of the Church Congress\r\nuntil the fly came, only he seemed dreadfully tired, quite knocked up.\r\nAnd he promised to let us know first thing to-morrow morning how Hester\r\nwas. He was cordial when we left. I think he meant well. But I can\r\nnever feel the same to Archdeacon Thursby again. He was quite my\r\ngreatest friend among the clergy round here. I suppose I shall learn in\r\ntime not to have such a high ideal of people, but I certainly thought\r\nvery highly of him until to-day."\r\n\r\nMr. Gresley sat upright, and put away his handkerchief with decision.\r\n\r\n"One thing this miserable day has taught us," he said, "and that is that\r\nwe must part with Fr\xe4ulein. If she is to become impertinent the first\r\nmoment we are in trouble, such a thing is not to be borne. We could not\r\npossibly keep her after her behavior to-day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n     If two lives join, there is oft a scar. --ROBERT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel left Westhope Abbey the day after Lord Newhaven\'s funeral, and\r\nreturned to London. And the day after that Hugh came to see her, and\r\nproposed, and was accepted.\r\n\r\nHe had gone over in his mind a hundred times all that he should say to\r\nher on that occasion. If he had said all that he was fully resolved to\r\nsay, it is hardly credible that any woman, however well disposed towards\r\nhim, would have accepted so tedious a suitor. But what he really said,\r\nin a hoarse, inaudible voice, was, "Rachel, will you marry me?" He was\r\nlooking so intently into a little grove of Roman hyacinths, that perhaps\r\nthe hyacinths heard what he said; at any rate, she did not. But she\r\nsupposed, from long experience, that he was proposing, and she said\r\n"Yes" immediately.\r\n\r\nShe had not intended to say so--at least, not at first. She had made up\r\nher mind that it would be only right to inform him that she was fourteen\r\nmonths older than he (she had looked him out in Burke where she herself\r\nwas not to be found); that she was "old enough to be his mother"; also\r\nthat she was of a cold, revengeful temper not calculated to make a home\r\nhappy, and several other odious traits of character which she had never\r\ndreamed of confiding to any of the regiment of her previous lovers.\r\n\r\nBut the only word she had breath to say when the time came was "Yes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRachel had shivered and hesitated on the brink of a new love long\r\nenough. Her anxiety about Hugh had unconsciously undermined her\r\nresistance. His confession had given her instantly the confidence in him\r\nwhich had been wanting. It is not perfection that we look for in our\r\nfellow-creatures, but for what is apparently rarer, a little plain\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nHow they rise before us!--the sweet reproachful faces of those whom we\r\ncould have loved devotedly if they had been willing to be\r\nstraightforward with us; whom we have lost, not by our own will, but by\r\nthat paralysis of feeling which gradually invades the heart at the\r\ndiscovery of small insincerities. Sincerity seems our only security\r\nagainst losing those who love us, the only cup in which those who are\r\nworth keeping will care to pledge us when youth is past.\r\n\r\nRachel was not by nature _de celles qui se jettent dans l\'amour comme\r\ndans un pr\xe9cipice_. But she shut her eyes, recommended her soul to God,\r\nand threw herself over. She had climbed down once--with assistance--and\r\nshe was not going to do that again. That she found herself alive at the\r\nbottom was a surprise to her, but a surprise that was quickly forgotten\r\nin the constant wonder that Hugh could love her as devotedly as it was\r\nobvious he did.\r\n\r\nWomen would have shared that wonder, but not men. There was a home ready\r\nmade in Rachel\'s faithful, dog-like eyes, which at once appealed to the\r\ndesire of expansion of empire in the heart of the free-born Briton.\r\n\r\nHugh had, until lately, considered woman as connected with the downward\r\nslope of life. He would have loudly disclaimed such an opinion if it had\r\nbeen attributed to him; but nevertheless it was the key-note of his\r\nbehavior towards them, his belief concerning them which was of a piece\r\nwith his cheap cynicism and dilettante views of life. He now discovered\r\nthat woman was made out of something more than man\'s spare rib.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that if he had never been in love with Lady Newhaven,\r\nHugh would never have loved Rachel. He would have looked at her, as many\r\nmen did, with a view to marriage and would probably have dismissed her\r\nfrom his thoughts as commonplace. He knew better now. It was Lady\r\nNewhaven who was commonplace. His worldliness was dropping from him day\r\nby day as he learned to know Rachel better.\r\n\r\nWhere was his cynicism now that she loved him?\r\n\r\nHis love for her, humble, triumphant, diffident, passionate, impatient\r\nby turns, now exacting, now selfless, possessed him entirely. He\r\nremembered once, with astonishment, that he was making a magnificent\r\nmatch. He had never thought of it, as Rachel knew, as she knew well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDecember came in bleak and dark. The snow did its poor best, laying day\r\nafter day its white veil upon the dismal streets. But it was\r\nmisunderstood. It was scraped into murky heaps. It melted and then\r\nfroze, and then melted again. And London groaned and shivered on its\r\ndaily round.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon Hugh came, and every morning Rachel made her rooms\r\nbright with flowers for him. The flower shop at the corner sent her tiny\r\ntrees of white lilac, and sweet little united families of hyacinths and\r\ntulips. The time of azaleas was not yet. And once he sent her a bunch of\r\ndaffodils. He knew best how he had obtained them.\r\n\r\nTheir wild, sweet faces peered at Rachel, and she sat down faint and\r\ndizzy, holding them in her nerveless hands. If one daffodil knows\r\nanything, all daffodils know it to the third and fourth generation.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" they said. "That man whom you loved once? We were there\r\nwhen he spoke to you. We saw you stand together by the attic window. We\r\nnever say, but we heard, we remember. And you cried for joy at night\r\nafterwards. We never say. But we heard. We remember."\r\n\r\nRachel\'s secretary in the little room on the ground-floor was\r\ninterrupted by a tap at the door. Rachel came in laden with daffodils.\r\nTheir splendor filled the gray room.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind having them?" she said, smiling, and laying them down by\r\nher. "And would you kindly write a line to Jones telling him not to send\r\nme daffodils again. They are a flower I particularly dislike."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Rachel?"\r\n\r\n"Hugh!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it would be better if we were married immediately?"\r\n\r\n"Better than what?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know; better than breaking it off."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t break it off now. I\'m not a person to be trifled with. You\r\nhave gone too far."\r\n\r\n"If you gave me half your attention, you would understand that I am only\r\nexpressing a wish to go a little further, but you have become so\r\nfrivolous since we have been engaged that I hardly recognize you."\r\n\r\n"I suit myself to my company."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to talk to me in that flippant manner when we are\r\nmarried. I sometimes fear, Rachel, you don\'t look upon me with\r\nsufficient awe. I foresee I shall have to be very firm when we are\r\nmarried. When may I begin to be firm?"\r\n\r\n"Are these such evil days, Hugh?"\r\n\r\n"I am like Oliver Twist," he said. "I want more."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were sitting together one afternoon in the fire-light in silence.\r\nThey often sat in silence together.\r\n\r\n"A wise woman once advised me," said Rachel at last, "if I married,\r\nnever to tell my husband of any previous attachment. She said, Let him\r\nalways believe that he was the first\r\n\r\n     That ever burst\r\n     Into that silent sea.\r\n\r\nI believe it was good advice, but it seems to me to have one\r\ndrawback--to follow it may be to tell a lie. It would be in my case."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"I know that a lie and an adroit appeal to the vanity of man are\r\nsupposed to be a woman\'s recognized weapons. The same woman told me that\r\nI might find myself mistaken in many things in this world, but never in\r\ncounting on the vanity of man. She said that was a reed which would\r\nnever pierce my hand. I don\'t think you are vain, Hugh."\r\n\r\n"Not vain! Why, I am so conceited at the fact that you are going to\r\nmarry me that I look down on every one else. I only long to tell them\r\nso. When may I tell my mother, Rachel? She is coming to London this\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"You have the pertinacity of a fly. You always come back to the same\r\npoint. I am beginning to be rather bored with your marriage. You can\'t\r\ntalk of anything else."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think about anything else."\r\n\r\nHe drew her cheek against his. He was an ingratiating creature.\r\n\r\n"Neither can I," she whispered.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all Rachel ever said of all she meant to say about Mr.\r\nTristram.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA yellow fog. It made rings round the shaded electric lamp by which\r\nRachel was reading. The fire burned tawny and blurred. Even her red gown\r\nlooked dim. Hugh came in.\r\n\r\n"What are you reading?" he said, sitting down by her.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to know, but if you are reading a book on another\r\nperson\'s knee you cannot be a very long way off. He glanced with feigned\r\ninterest at the open page, stooping a little, for he was short-sighted\r\nnow and then--at least now.\r\n\r\nRachel took the opportunity to look at him. You can\'t really look at a\r\nperson when he is looking at you. Hugh was very handsome, especially\r\nside face, and he knew it; but he was not sure whether Rachel thought\r\nso.\r\n\r\nHe read mechanically:\r\n\r\n     "Take back your vows.\r\n     Elsewhere you trimmed and taught these lamps to burn;\r\n     You bring them stale and dim to serve my turn.\r\n     You lit those candles in another shrine,\r\n     Guttered and cold you offer them on mine.\r\n     Take back your vows."\r\n\r\nA shadow fell across Hugh\'s mind. Rachel saw it fall.\r\n\r\n"You do not think that of me, Rachel," he said, pointing to the verse.\r\nIt was the first time he had alluded to that halting confession which\r\nhad remained branded on the minds of both.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up at her, and she suffered him for a moment to look through\r\nher clear eyes into her soul.\r\n\r\n"I never thought that of you," she said, with difficulty. "I am so\r\nfoolish that I believe the candles are lit now for the first time. I am\r\nso foolish that I believe you love me nearly as much as I love you."\r\n\r\n"It is a dream," said Hugh, passionately, and he fell on his knees, and\r\nhid his white face against her knee. "It is a dream. I shall wake, and\r\nfind you never cared for me."\r\n\r\nShe sat for a moment stunned by the violence of his emotion, which was\r\nshaking him from head to foot. Then she drew him into her trembling\r\narms, and held his head against her breast.\r\n\r\nShe felt his tears through her gown.\r\n\r\n"What is past will never come between us," she said, brokenly, at last.\r\n"I have cried over it too, Hugh; but I have put it from my mind. When\r\nyou told me about it, knowing you risked losing me by telling me, I\r\nsuddenly trusted you entirely. I had not quite up till then. I can\'t say\r\nwhy, except that perhaps I had grown suspicious because I was once\r\ndeceived. But I do now, because you were open with me. I think, Hugh,\r\nyou and I can dare to be truthful to each other. You have been so to me,\r\nand I will be so to you. I knew about _that_ long before you told me.\r\nLady Newhaven--poor thing!--confided in me last summer. She had to tell\r\nsome one. I think you ought to know that I know. And oh, Hugh, I knew\r\nabout the drawing of lots, too."\r\n\r\nHugh started violently, but he did not move.\r\n\r\nWould she have recognized that ashen, convulsed face if he had raised\r\nit?\r\n\r\n"Lady Newhaven listened at the door when you were drawing lots, and she\r\ntold me. But we never knew which had drawn the short lighter till Lord\r\nNewhaven was killed on the line. Only she and I and you know that that\r\nwas not an accident. I know what you must have gone through all the\r\nsummer, feeling you had taken his life as well. But you must remember it\r\nwas his own doing, and a perfectly even chance. You ran the same risk.\r\nHis blood is on his own head. But oh, my darling, when I think it might\r\nhave been you!"\r\n\r\nHugh thought afterwards that if her arms had not been round him, if he\r\nhad been a little distance from her, he might have told her the truth.\r\nHe owed it to her, this woman who was the very soul of truth. But if she\r\nhad withdrawn from him, however gently, in the moment when her\r\ntenderness had, for the first time, vanquished her natural reserve, if\r\nshe had taken herself away then, he could not have borne it. In deep\r\nrepentance after Lord Newhaven\'s death, he had vowed that from that day\r\nforward he would never deviate again from the path of truth and honor,\r\nhowever difficult it might prove. But this frightful moment had come\r\nupon him unawares. He drew back instinctively, giddy and unnerved, as\r\nfrom a chasm yawning suddenly among the flowers, one step in front of\r\nhim. He was too stunned to think. When he rallied they were standing\r\ntogether on the hearth-rug, and she was saying--he did not know what she\r\nwas saying, for he was repeating over and over again to himself, "The\r\nmoment is past. The moment is past."\r\n\r\nAt last her words conveyed some meaning to him.\r\n\r\n"We will never speak of this again, my friend," she said; "but now that\r\nno harm can be done by it, it seemed right to tell you I knew."\r\n\r\n"I ought never to have drawn," said Hugh, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"No," said Rachel. "He was in fault to demand such a thing. It was\r\ninhuman. But having once drawn he had to abide by it, as you would have\r\ndone if you had drawn the short lighter."\r\n\r\nShe was looking earnestly at him, as at one given back from the grave.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Hugh, feeling she expected him to speak. "If I had drawn it\r\nI should have had to abide by it."\r\n\r\n"I thank God continually that you did not draw it. You made him the\r\ndreadful reparation he asked. If it recoiled upon himself you were not\r\nto blame. You have done wrong, and you have repented. You have suffered,\r\nHugh. I know it by your face. And perhaps I have suffered too, but that\r\nis past. We will shut up the past, and think of the future. Promise me\r\nthat you will never speak of this again."\r\n\r\n"I promise," said Hugh, mechanically.\r\n\r\n"The moment to speak is past," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHad it ever been present?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n     Dieu n\'oubl\xede personne. Il visite tout le monde.--VINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nHugh did not sleep that night.\r\n\r\nHis escape had been too narrow. He shivered at the mere thought of it.\r\nIt had never struck him as possible that Rachel and Lady Newhaven had\r\nknown of the drawing of lots. Now that he found they knew, sundry small\r\nincidents, unnoticed at the time, came crowding back to his memory. That\r\nwas why Lady Newhaven had written so continually those letters which he\r\nhad burned unread. That was why she had made that desperate attempt to\r\nsee him in the smoking-room at Wilderleigh after the boating accident.\r\nShe wanted to know which had drawn the short lighter. That explained the\r\nmysterious tension which Hugh had noticed in Rachel during the last days\r\nin London before--before the time was up. He saw it all now. And, of\r\ncourse, they naturally supposed that Lord Newhaven had committed\r\nsuicide. They could not think otherwise. They were waiting for one of\r\nthe two men to do it.\r\n\r\n"If Lord Newhaven had not turned giddy and stumbled on to the line, if\r\nhe had not died by accident when he did," said Hugh to himself, "where\r\nshould I be now?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to that question.\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of asking it? He _was_ dead. And, fortunately, the two\r\nwomen firmly believed he had died by his own hand. Hugh as firmly\r\nbelieved that the death was accidental.\r\n\r\nBut it could not be his duty to set them right, to rake up the whole\r\nhideous story again.\r\n\r\nBy an extraordinary, by a miraculous chance, he was saved, as it were, a\r\nsecond time. It could do no good to allude to the dreadful subject\r\nagain. Besides, he had promised Rachel never to speak of it again.\r\n\r\nHe groaned, and hid his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, coward and wretch that I am," he said. "Cannot I even be honest\r\nwith myself? I lied to her to-day. I never thought I could have told\r\nRachel a lie, but I did. I can\'t live without her. I must have her. I\r\nwould rather die than lose her now. And I should have lost her if I\'d\r\ntold her the truth. I felt that. I am not worthy. It was an ill day for\r\nher when she took my tarnished life into her white hands. She ought to\r\nhave trodden me under foot. But she does love me, and I will never\r\ndeceive her again. She does love me, and, God helping me, I will make\r\nher happy."\r\n\r\nThe strain of conflict was upon Hugh--the old, old conflict of the seed\r\nwith the earth, of the soul with love. How many little fibres and roots\r\nthe seed puts out, pushed by an unrecognized need within itself, not\r\nwithout pain, not without a gradual rending of its being, not without a\r\ndeath unto self into a higher life. Love was dealing with Hugh\'s soul as\r\nthe earth deals with the seed, and--he suffered.\r\n\r\nIt was a man who did not look like an accepted lover who presented\r\nhimself at Rachel\'s door the following afternoon.\r\n\r\nBut Rachel was not there. Her secretary handed Hugh a little note which\r\nshe had left for him, telling him that Hester had suddenly fallen ill,\r\nand that she had been sent for to Southminster. The note ended: "These\r\nfirst quiet days are past. So now you may tell your mother, and put our\r\nengagement in the _Morning Post_."\r\n\r\nHugh was astonished at the despair which overwhelmed him at the bare\r\nthought that he should not see Rachel that day and not the next either.\r\nIt was not to be borne. She had no right to make him suffer like this.\r\nDay by day, when a certain restless fever returned upon him, he had\r\nknown, as an opium-eater knows, that at a certain hour he should become\r\nrested and calm and sane once more. To be in the same room with Rachel,\r\nto hear her voice, to let his eyes dwell upon her, to lean his forehead\r\nfor a moment against her hand, was to enter, as we enter in dreams, a\r\nworld of joy and comfort, and boundless, endless, all-pervading peace.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was suddenly left shivering in a bleak world without her.\r\nWith her he was himself, a released, freed self, growing daily further\r\nand further away from all he had once been. Without her he felt he was\r\nnothing but a fierce, wounded animal.\r\n\r\nHe tried to laugh at himself as he walked slowly away from Rachel\'s\r\nhouse. He told himself that he was absurd, that an absence of a few days\r\nwas nothing. He turned his steps mechanically in the direction of his\r\nmother\'s lodgings. At any rate, he could tell her. He could talk about\r\nthis cruel woman to her. The smart was momentarily soothed by his\r\nmother\'s painful joy. He wrenched himself somewhat out of himself as she\r\nwept the tears of jealous love, which all mothers must weep when the\r\nwoman comes who takes their son away. "I am so glad," she kept\r\nrepeating. "These are tears of joy, Hughie. I can forgive her for\r\naccepting you, but I should never have forgiven her if she had refused\r\nyou--if she had made my boy miserable. And you have been miserable\r\nlately. I have seen it for a long time. I suppose it was all this coming\r\non."\r\n\r\nHe said it was. The remembrance of other causes of irritation and\r\nmoodiness had slipped entirely off his mind.\r\n\r\nHe stayed a long time with his mother, who pressed him to wait till his\r\nsister, who was shopping, returned. But his sister tarried long\r\nout-of-doors, and at last the pain of Rachel\'s absence returning on him,\r\nhe left suddenly, promising to return in the evening.\r\n\r\nHe did not go back to his rooms. He wandered aimlessly through the\r\ndarkening streets, impatient of the slow hours. At last he came out on\r\nthe Embankment. The sun was setting redly, frostily, in a gray world of\r\nsky-mist and river-mist and spectral bridge and spire. A shaking\r\npath-way of pale flame came across the gray of the hidden river to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe stood a long time looking at it. The low sun touched and forsook,\r\ntouched and forsook point by point the little crowded world which it was\r\nleaving.\r\n\r\n"My poor mother," said Hugh to himself. "Poor, gentle, loving soul whom\r\nI so nearly brought down with sorrow to the grave. She will never know\r\nwhat an escape she has had. I might have been more to her. I might have\r\nmade her happier, seeing her happiness is wrapped up in me. I will make\r\nup to her for it. I will be a better son to her in future. Rachel and I\r\ntogether will make her last years happy. Rachel and I together," said\r\nHugh, over and over again.\r\n\r\nAnd then he suddenly remembered that though Rachel had taken herself\r\naway he could write to her, and--he might look out the trains to\r\nSouthminster. He leaped into a hansom and hurried back to his rooms.\r\n\r\nThe porter met him in a mysterious manner in the entrance. Lady waiting\r\nto see him. Lady said she was his sister. Had been waiting two hours. In\r\nhis rooms now.\r\n\r\nHugh laughed, and ran up the wide, common staircase. His sister had\r\nheard the news from his mother and had rushed over at once.\r\n\r\nAs he stooped a little to fit the latch-key on his chain into the lock a\r\nman, who was coming down the stairs feeling in his pockets, stopped with\r\na sudden exclamation. It was Captain Pratt, pallid, smiling, hair newly\r\nvarnished, resplendent in a magnificent fur overcoat.\r\n\r\n"What luck," he said. "Scarlett, I think. We met at Wilderleigh. Have\r\nyou such a thing as a match about you?"\r\n\r\nHugh felt in his pockets. He had not one.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," he said, opening the door. "I\'ve plenty inside. Come in."\r\n\r\nHugh went in first, extricating his key. Captain Pratt followed,\r\nmurmuring, "Nice little dens, these. A pal of mine lives just\r\nabove--Streatham. You know Streatham, son of Lord--"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the sentence was lost.\r\n\r\nThe door opened straight into the little sitting-room.\r\n\r\nA woman in deep mourning rose suddenly out of a chair by the fire and\r\ncame towards them.\r\n\r\n"Hughie!" she said.\r\n\r\nIt was Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that none of the tableaux she had arranged were quite so\r\ndramatic as this one, in which she had not reckoned on that elaborate\r\nfigure in the door-way.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt\'s opinion of Hugh, whom he had hitherto regarded as a\r\npauper with an involved estate, leaped from temperate to summer\r\nheat--blood-heat. After the first instant he kept his eyes steadily\r\nfixed on Hugh.\r\n\r\n"I--er--thank you, Scarlett. I have found my matches. A thousand thanks.\r\nGood-night."\r\n\r\nHe was disappearing, but Hugh, his eyes flashing in his gray face, held\r\nhim forcibly by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Lady Newhaven," he said, "the porter is inexcusable. These are my rooms\r\nwhich he has shown you into by mistake, not Mr. Streatham\'s, your\r\nnephew. He is just above. I think," turning to Captain Pratt, "Streatham\r\nis out of town."\r\n\r\n"He is out of town," said Captain Pratt, looking with cold admiration at\r\nHugh. "Admirable," he said to himself; "a born gentleman."\r\n\r\n"This is not the first time Streatham\'s visitors have been shown in\r\nhere," continued Hugh. "The porter shall be dismissed. I trust you will\r\nforgive me my share in the annoyance he has caused you. Is your carriage\r\nwaiting?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Lady Newhaven, faintly, quite thrown off the lines of her\r\nprepared scene by the sudden intrusion into it of a foreign body.\r\n\r\n"My hansom is below," said Captain Pratt, deferentially, venturing, now\r\nthat the situation was, so to speak, draped, to turn his discreet agate\r\neyes towards Lady Newhaven. "If it could be of the least use, I myself\r\nshould prefer to walk."\r\n\r\nNow that he looked at her, he looked very hard at her. She was a\r\nbeautiful woman.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven\'s self-possession had returned sufficiently for her to\r\ntake up her fur cloak.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said, letting Captain Pratt help her on with it. "I\r\nshall be glad to make use of your hansom, if you are sure you can spare\r\nit. I am shocked at having taken possession of your rooms," turning to\r\nHugh; "I will write to Georgie Streatham to-night. I am staying with my\r\nmother, and I came across to ask him to take my boys to the pantomime,\r\nas I cannot take them myself--so soon," with a glance at her crape.\r\n"Don\'t come down, Mr. Scarlett. I have given you enough trouble\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt\'s arm was crooked. He conducted her in his best manner to\r\nthe foot of the staircase and helped her into his hansom. His manner was\r\nnot so unctuous as his father\'s, but it was slightly adhesive. Lady\r\nNewhaven shuddered involuntarily as she took his arm.\r\n\r\nHugh followed.\r\n\r\n"I hope you will both come and see my mother," she said, with an attempt\r\nat graciousness. "You know Lady Trentham, I think?"--to Captain Pratt.\r\n\r\n"Very slightly. No. Delighted!" murmured Captain Pratt, closing the\r\nhansom doors in an intimate manner. "And if I could be of the least use\r\nat any time in taking your boys to the pantomime--er--only too glad. The\r\nglass down, Richards!"\r\n\r\nThe hansom with its splendid bay horse rattled off.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt nodded to Hugh, who was still standing on the steps, and\r\nturned away to buy a box of matches from a passing urchin. Then he\r\nturned up his fur collar, and proceeded leisurely on his way.\r\n\r\n"Very stand-off both of them in the past," he said to himself, "but they\r\nwill have to be civil in future. I wonder if he will make her keep her\r\ntitle. Deuced awkward for them both though, only a month after\r\nNewhaven\'s death. I wish that sort of _contre-temps_ would happen to me\r\nwhen I\'m bringing in a lot of fellows suddenly. An opening like that is\r\nall I want to give me a start, and I should get on as well as anybody.\r\nThe aristocracy all hang together, whatever Selina and Ada may say.\r\nMoney don\'t buy everything, as the governor thinks. But if you\'re once\r\nin with \'em you\'re in."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHugh went back to his room and locked himself in. He was a delicate man,\r\nhighly strung, and he had not slept the night before. He collapsed into\r\na chair and remained a long time, his head in his hands.\r\n\r\nIt was too horrible, this woman coming back upon him suddenly, like the\r\nghost of some one whom he had murdered. His momentary infatuation had\r\nbeen clean forgotten in his overwhelming love for Rachel. His intrigue\r\nwith Lady Newhaven seemed so long ago that it had been relegated to the\r\nsame mental shelf in his mind as the nibbling of a certain forbidden\r\nginger-bread when he was home for his first holidays. He could not be\r\nheld responsible for either offence after this immense interval of time.\r\nIt was not he who had committed them, but that other embryo self, that\r\nenvelope of flesh and sense which he was beginning to abhor, through\r\nwhich he had passed before he reached himself, Hugh, the real man--the\r\nman who loved Rachel, and whom Rachel loved.\r\n\r\nHe had not flinched when he came unexpectedly on Lady Newhaven. At the\r\nsight of her a sudden passion of anger shot up and enveloped him as in\r\none flame from head to foot. His love for Rachel was a weapon, and he\r\nused it. He did not greatly care about his own good name, but the good\r\nname of the man whom Rachel loved was a thing to fight for. It was for\r\nher sake, not Lady Newhaven\'s, that he had concocted the story of the\r\nmistaken rooms. He should not have had the presence of mind if Rachel\r\nhad not been concerned.\r\n\r\nHe had not finished with Lady Newhaven. He should have trouble yet with\r\nher, hideous scenes, in which the corpse of his dead lust would be\r\ndragged up, a thing to shudder at, out of its nettly grave.\r\n\r\nHe could bear it. He must bear it. Nothing would induce him to marry\r\nLady Newhaven, as she evidently expected. He set his teeth. "She will\r\nknow the day after to-morrow," he said to himself, "when she sees my\r\nengagement to Rachel in the papers. Then she will get at me somehow, and\r\nmake my life a hell to me, while she can. And she will try and come\r\nbetween me and Rachel. I deserve it. I deserve anything I get. But\r\nRachel knows, and will stick to me. I will go down to her to-morrow. I\r\ncan\'t go on without seeing her. And she won\'t mind, as the engagement\r\nwill be given out next day."\r\n\r\nHe became more composed at the thought of Rachel. But presently his lip\r\nquivered. It would be all right in the end. But, oh! not to have done\r\nit! Not to have done it! To have come to his marriage with a whiter\r\npast, not to need her forgiveness on the very threshold of their life\r\ntogether, not to have been unfaithful to her before he knew her.\r\n\r\nWhat man who has disbelieved in his youth in the sanctity of Love, and\r\nthen later has knelt in its Holy of Holies, has escaped that pang?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n     There\'s neither honesty, manhood, nor good-fellowship in\r\n     thee.--SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n\r\n"My mind misgives me, Dick!" said the Bishop, a day or two later, as\r\nDick joined him and his sister and Rachel at luncheon at the Palace. "I\r\nam convinced that you have been up to some mischief."\r\n\r\n"I have just returned from Warpington, my lord. I understood it was your\r\nwish I should ride over and tell them Hester was better."\r\n\r\n"It certainly was my wish. I\'m very much obliged to you. But I\r\nremembered after you had gone that you had refused to speak to Gresley\r\nwhen he was over here, and I was sorry I sent you."\r\n\r\n"I spoke to him all right," said Dick, grimly. "That was why I was so\r\nalacritous to go."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked steadily at him.\r\n\r\n"Until you are my suffragan I should prefer to manage my own business\r\nwith my clergy."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Dick, helping himself to mustard. "But, you see, I\'m his\r\ncousin, and I thought it just as well to let him know quietly and\r\ndispassionately what I thought of him. So I told him I was not\r\nparticular about my acquaintances. I knew lots of bad eggs out in\r\nAustralia, half of them hatched in England, chaps who\'d been shaved and\r\ntubbed gratis by Government--in fact, I\'d a large visiting list, but\r\nthat I drew the line at such a cad as him, and that he might remember I\r\nwasn\'t going to preach for him at any more of his little cold-water\r\ncures"--a smile hovered on Dick\'s crooked mouth--"or ever take any\r\nnotice of him in future. That was what he wanted, my lord. You were too\r\nsoft with him, if you\'ll excuse my saying so. But that sort of chap\r\nwants it giving him hot and strong. He doesn\'t understand anything else.\r\nHe gets quite beyond himself, fizzing about on his little\r\npocket-handkerchief of a parish, thinking he is a sort of god, because\r\nno one makes it their business to keep him in his place, and rub it into\r\nhim that he is an infernal fool. That is why some clergymen jaw so,\r\nbecause they never have it brought home to them what rot they talk.\r\nThey\'d be no sillier than other men if they were only treated properly.\r\nI was very calm, but I let him have it. I told him he was a mean sneak,\r\nand that either he was the biggest fool or the biggest rogue going, and\r\nthat the mere fact of his cloth did not give him the right to do\r\ndishonest things with other people\'s property, though it did save him\r\nfrom the pounding he richly deserved. He tried to interrupt; indeed, he\r\nwas tooting all the time like a fog-horn, but I did not take any notice,\r\nand I wound up by saying it was men like him who brought discredit on\r\nthe Church and on the clergy, and who made the gorge rise of decent\r\nchaps like me. Yes," said Dick, after a pause, "when I left him he\r\nunderstood, I don\'t say entirely, but he had a distant glimmering. It\r\nisn\'t often I go on these errands of mercy, but I felt that the least I\r\ncould do was to back you up, my lord. Of course, it is in little matters\r\nlike this that lay helpers come in, who are not so hampered about their\r\nlanguage as I suppose the clergy are."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop tried, he tried hard, to look severe, but his mouth twitched.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t thank me," said Dick. "Nothing is a trouble where you are\r\nconcerned. It was--ahem--a pleasure."\r\n\r\n"That I can believe," said the Bishop. "Well, Dick, Providence makes use\r\nof strange instruments--the jawbone of an ass has a certain Scriptural\r\nprestige. I dare say you reached poor Gresley where I failed. I\r\ncertainly failed. But, if it is not too much to ask, I should regard it\r\nas a favor another time if I might be informed beforehand what\r\ndirection your diocesan aid was about to take."\r\n\r\nDr. Brown, who often came to luncheon at the Palace, came in now. He\r\ntook off his leathern driving-gloves and held his hands to the fire.\r\n\r\n"Cold," he said. "They\'re skating everywhere. How is Miss Gresley?"\r\n\r\n"She knows us to-day," said Rachel, "and she is quite cheerful."\r\n\r\n"Does the poor thing know her book is burned?"\r\n\r\n"No. She was speaking this morning of its coming out in the spring."\r\n\r\nThe little doctor thrust out his underlip and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"I travelled from Pontesbury this morning," he said, "with that man who\r\nwas nearly drowned at Beaumere in the summer. I doctored him at\r\nWilderleigh. Tall, thin, rather a fine gentleman. I forget his name."\r\n\r\nDr. Brown aways spoke of men above himself in the social scale as "fine\r\ngentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Redman," said Miss Keane, the Bishop\'s sister, a dignified person,\r\nwho had been hampered throughout life by a predilection for the wrong\r\nname, and by making engagements in illegible handwriting by last year\'s\r\nalmanacs.\r\n\r\n"Was it Mr. Scarlett?" said Rachel, feeling Dick\'s lynx eye upon her. "I\r\nwas at Wilderleigh when the accident happened."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the man. He got out at Southminster, and asked me which was the\r\nbest hotel. No, I won\'t have any more, thanks. I\'ll go up and see Miss\r\nGresley at once."\r\n\r\nRachel followed the Bishop into the library. They generally waited there\r\ntogether till the doctor came down.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know many young men I like better than Dick," said the Bishop.\r\n"I should marry him if I were a young woman. I admire the way he acts up\r\nto his principles. Very few of us do. Until he has a further light on\r\nthe subject, he is right to, knock a man down who insults him. And from\r\nhis point of view he was justified in speaking to Mr. Gresley as he did.\r\nI was sorely tempted to say something of that kind to him myself, but as\r\none grows gray one realizes that one can only speak in a spirit of love.\r\nA man of Dick\'s stamp will always be respected, because he does not\r\nassume virtues which belong to a higher grade than he is on at present.\r\nBut when he reaches that higher grade he will act as thoroughly upon the\r\nconvictions that accompany it as he does now on his present\r\nconvictions."\r\n\r\n"He certainly would not turn the other cheek to the smiter."\r\n\r\n"I should not advise the smiter to reckon on it. And unless it is turned\r\nfrom that rare sense of spiritual brotherhood it would be unmanly to\r\nturn it. To imitate the outward appearance of certain virtues is like\r\nimitating the clothes of a certain class. It does not make us belong to\r\nthe class to dress like it. The true foundation for the spiritual life,\r\nas far as I can see it, is in the full development of our human nature\r\nwith all its simple trusts and aspirations. I admire Dick\'s solid\r\nfoundation. It will carry a building worthy of him some day. But my\r\nwords of wisdom appear to be thrown away upon you. You are thinking of\r\nsomething else."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking that I ought to tell you that I am engaged to be\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s face lit up.\r\n\r\n"I am engaged to Mr. Scarlett. That is why he has come down here."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s face fell. Rachel had been three days at the Palace. Dick\r\nhad not allowed the grass to grow under his feet. "That admirable\r\npromptitude," the Bishop had remarked to himself, "deserves success."\r\n\r\n"Poor, dear Dick," he said, softly.\r\n\r\n"That is what Hester says. I told her yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I really have a very high opinion of Dick," said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"So have I. If I might have two I would certainly choose him second."\r\n\r\n"But this superfluous Mr. Scarlett comes first, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he does."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Bishop, with a sigh, "if you are so ungrateful as to\r\nmarry to please yourself, instead of to please me, there is nothing more\r\nto be said. I will have a look at your Mr. Scarlett when he comes to\r\ntea. I suppose he will come to tea. I notice the most _farouche_ men do\r\nwhen they are engaged. It is the first step in the turning process. I\r\nshall, of course, bring an entirely unprejudiced mind to bear upon him,\r\nas I always make a point of doing, but I warn you beforehand I shan\'t\r\nlike him."\r\n\r\n"Because he is not Mr. Dick."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; because he is not Dick. I suppose his name is Bertie."\r\n\r\n"Not Bertie," said Rachel, indignantly, "Hugh."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a poor, inefficient kind of name, only four letters, and a\r\nduplicate at each end. I don\'t think, my dear, he is worthy of you."\r\n\r\n"Dick has only four letters."\r\n\r\n"I make it a rule never to argue with women. Well, Rachel, I\'m glad you\r\nhave decided to marry. Heaven bless you, and may you be happy with this\r\nman. Ah! here comes Dr. Brown."\r\n\r\n"Well!" said the Bishop and Rachel, simultaneously.\r\n\r\n"She\'s better," said the little doctor, angrily; he was always angry\r\nwhen he was anxious. "She\'s round the first corner. But how to pull her\r\nround the next corner, that is what I\'m thinking."\r\n\r\n"Defer the next corner."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t now her mind is clear. She\'s as sane as you or I are, and a\r\ngood deal sharper. When she asks about her book she\'ll have to be told."\r\n\r\n"A lie would be quite justifiable under the circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course, but it would be useless. You might hoodwink her\r\nfor a day or two, and then she would find out, first, that the _magnum\r\nopus_ is gone, and secondly, that you and Miss West, whom she does trust\r\nentirely at present, have deceived her. You know what she is when she\r\nthinks she is being deceived. She abused you well, my lord, until you\r\nreinstated yourself by producing Regie Gresley. But you can\'t reinstate\r\nyourself a second time. You can\'t produce the book."\r\n\r\n"No," said the Bishop. "That is gone forever."\r\n\r\nRachel could not trust herself to speak. Perhaps she had realized more\r\nfully than even the Bishop had done what the loss of the book was to\r\nHester, at least, what it would be when she knew it was gone.\r\n\r\n"Tell her, and give her that if she becomes excitable," said Dr. Brown,\r\nproducing a minute bottle out of a voluminous pocket. "And if you want\r\nme I shall be at Canon Wylde\'s at five o\'clock. I\'ll look in anyhow\r\nbefore I go home."\r\n\r\nRachel and the Bishop stood a moment in silence after he was gone, and\r\nthen Rachel took up the little bottle, read the directions carefully,\r\nand turned to go up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked after her, but did not speak. He was sorry for her.\r\n\r\n"You can go out till tea-time," said Rachel, to the nurse. "I will stay\r\nwith Miss Gresley till then."\r\n\r\nHester was lying on a couch by the fire in a rose-colored wrapper. Her\r\nsmall face, set in its ruffle of soft lace, looked bright and eager. Her\r\nhair had been cut short, and she looked younger and more like Regie than\r\never.\r\n\r\nHer thin hands lay contentedly in her lap. The principal bandages were\r\ngone. Only three fingers of the right hand were in a chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be in too great a hurry to get well," she said to Rachel.\r\n"If I do you will rush away to London and get married.\r\n\r\n"Shall I?" Rachel set down the little bottle on the mantel-piece.\r\n\r\n"When is Mr. Scarlett coming down?"\r\n\r\n"He came down to-day."\r\n\r\n"Then possibly he may call."\r\n\r\n"Such things do happen."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see him."\r\n\r\n"In a day or two, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"And I want to see dear Dick, too."\r\n\r\n"He sent you his love. Mr. Pratt was here at luncheon yesterday, and he\r\nasked me who the old chap was who put on his clothes with a shoe-horn."\r\n\r\n"How like him! Has he said anything more to the Bishop on the uses of\r\nswearing?"\r\n\r\n"No. But the Bishop draws him on. He delights in him."\r\n\r\n"Rachel, are you sure you have chosen the best man?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure--I mean I never had any choice in the matter. You see I love\r\nHugh, and I\'m only fond of Mr. Dick."\r\n\r\n"I always liked Mr. Scarlett," said Hester. "I\'ve known him ever since I\r\ncame out, and that wasn\'t yesterday. He is so gentle and refined, and\r\none need not be on one\'s guard in talking to him. He understands what\r\none says, and he is charming looking."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I think so."\r\n\r\n"And this is the genuine thing, Rachel? Do you remember our talk last\r\nsummer?"\r\n\r\nRachel was silent a moment.\r\n\r\n"All I can say is," she said, brokenly, "that I thank God, day and\r\nnight, that Mr. Tristram did not marry me--that I\'m free to marry Hugh."\r\n\r\nHester\'s uncrippled hand stole into Rachel\'s.\r\n\r\n"Everybody will think," said Rachel, "when they see the engagement in\r\nto-morrow\'s papers that I give him everything because he is poor and his\r\nplace involved, and of course I am horribly wealthy. But in reality it\r\nis I who am poor and he who is rich. He has given me a thousand times\r\nmore than I could ever give him, because he has given me back the power\r\nof loving. It almost frightens me that I can care so much a second time.\r\nI should not have thought it possible. But I seem to have got the hang\r\nof it now, as Mr. Dick would say. I wish you were down-stairs, Hester,\r\nas you will be in a day or two. You would be amused by the way he shocks\r\nMiss Keane. She asked if he had written anything on his travels, and he\r\nsaid he was on the point of bringing out a little book on \'Cannibal\r\nCookery,\' for the use of Colonials. He said some of the recipes were\r\nvery simple. He began: \'You take a hand and close it round a yam.\' But\r\nthe Bishop stopped him."\r\n\r\nThe moment Rachel had said, "He is on the point of bringing out a book,"\r\nher heart stood still. How could she have said such a thing? But\r\napparently Hester took no notice.\r\n\r\n"He must have been experimenting on my poor hand," she said. "I\'m sure I\r\nnever burned it like this myself."\r\n\r\n"It will soon be better now."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t mind about it now that it doesn\'t hurt all the time."\r\n\r\n"And your head does not ache to-day, does it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing to matter. But I feel as if I had fallen on it from the top of\r\nthe cathedral. Dr. Brown says that is nonsense, but I think so all the\r\nsame. When you believe a thing, and you\'re told it\'s nonsense, and you\r\nstill believe it, that is an hallucination, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I have had a great many," said Hester, slowly. "I suppose I have been\r\nmore ill than I knew. I thought I saw, I really did see, the spirits of\r\nthe frost and the snow looking in at the window. And I talked to them a\r\nlong time, and asked them what quarrel they had with me, their sister,\r\nthat since I was a child they had always been going about to kill me.\r\nAunt Susan always seemed to think they were enemies who gave me\r\nbronchitis. And I told them how I loved them and all their works. And\r\nthey breathed on the pane and wrote beautiful things in frost-work, and\r\nI read them all. Now, Rachel, is that an hallucination about the\r\nfrost-work, because it seems to me still, now that I am better, though I\r\ncan\'t explain it, that I do see the meaning of it at last, and that I\r\nshall never be afraid of them again."\r\n\r\nRachel did not answer.\r\n\r\nShe had long since realized that Hester, when in her normal condition,\r\nsaw things which she herself did not see. She had long since realized\r\nthat Hester always accepted as final the limit of vision of the person\r\nshe was with, but that that limit changed with every person she met.\r\nRachel had seen her adjust it to persons more short-sighted than\r\nherself, with secret self-satisfaction, and then with sudden\r\nbewilderment had heard Hester accept as a commonplace from some one else\r\nwhat appeared to Rachel fantastic in the extreme. If Rachel had\r\nconsidered her own mind as the measure of the normal of all other minds,\r\nshe could not have escaped the conclusion that Hester was a victim of\r\nmanifold delusions. But, fortunately for herself, she saw that most\r\nladders possessed more than the one rung on which she was standing.\r\n\r\n"That is quite different, isn\'t it," said Hester, "from thinking Dr.\r\nBrown is a gray wolf?"\r\n\r\n"Quite different. That was an hallucination of fever. You see that for\r\nyourself now that you have no fever."\r\n\r\n"I see that, of course, now that I have no fever," repeated Hester, her\r\neyes widening. "But one hallucination quite as foolish as that is always\r\ncoming back, and I can\'t shake it off. The wolf was gone directly, but\r\nthis is just the same now I am better, only it gets worse and worse. I\r\nhave never spoken of it to any one, because I know it is so silly. But\r\nRachel--I have no fever now--and yet--I know you\'ll laugh at me--I laugh\r\nat my own foolish self--and yet all the time I have a horrible feeling\r\nthat"--Hester\'s eyes had in them a terror that was hardly human--"that\r\nmy book is burned."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n     The soul of thy brother is a dark forest. --_Russian Proverb_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"A marriage has been arranged, and will shortly take place, between Hugh\r\nSt. John Scarlett, of Kenstone Manor, Shropshire, only son of the late\r\nLord Henry Scarlett, and Rachel, only child of the late Joshua Hopkins\r\nWest, of Birmingham."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis announcement appeared in the _Morning Post_ a few days after\r\nChristmas, and aroused many different emotions in the breasts of those\r\nwho read it.\r\n\r\n"She has done it to spite me," said Mr. Tristram to himself over his\r\nmorning rasher, in the little eating-house near his studio. "I knew\r\nthere was some one else in her mind when she refused me. I rather\r\nthought it was that weedy fellow with the high nose. Will he make her\r\nhappy because he is a lord\'s son? That is what I should like to ask her.\r\nPoor Rachel, if we had been able to marry five years ago we should never\r\nhave heard of this society craze. Well, it\'s all over now." And Mr.\r\nTristram henceforward took the position of a man suffering from an\r\nindelible attachment to a woman who had thrown him over for a title.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Gresleys were astonished at the engagement. It was so extraordinary\r\nthat they should know both persons. Now that they came to think of it,\r\nboth of them had been to tea at the Vicarage only last summer.\r\n\r\n"A good many people pop in and out of this house," they agreed.\r\n\r\n"I am as certain as that I stand here," said Mr. Gresley, who was\r\nsitting down, "that that noisy boor, that underbred, foul-mouthed Dick\r\nVernon wanted to marry her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention him," said Mrs. Gresley. "When I think of what he dared\r\nto say--"\r\n\r\n"My love," said Mr. Gresley, "I have forgiven him. I have put from my\r\nmind all he said, for I am convinced he was under the influence of drink\r\nat the time. We must make allowance for those who live in hot climates.\r\nI bear him no grudge. But I am glad that a man of that stamp should not\r\nmarry Miss West. Drunkenness makes a hell of married life. Mr. Scarlett,\r\nthough he looked delicate, had at least the appearance of being\r\nabstemious."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein heard the news as she was packing her boxes to leave Warpington\r\nVicarage. She was greatly depressed. She could not be with her dear Miss\r\nGresley in this mysterious illness which some secret sorrow had brought\r\nupon her; but at least Miss West could minister to her. And now it\r\nseemed Miss West was thinking of "Bra\xfctigams" more than of Hester.\r\n\r\nFr\xe4ulein had been very uncomfortable at the Vicarage, but she wept at\r\nleaving. Mrs. Gresley had never attained to treating her with the\r\nconsideration which she would have accorded to one whom she considered\r\nher equal. The servants were allowed to disregard with impunity her\r\nsmall polite requests. The nurse was consistently, ferociously jealous\r\nof her. But the children had made up for all, and now she was leaving\r\nthem; and she did not own it to herself, for she was but five-and-thirty\r\nand the shyest of the shy; but she should see no more that\r\nnoble-hearted, that musical Herr B-r-r-rown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Doll," said Sybell Loftus to her husband at breakfast, "I\'ve made\r\nanother match. I thought at the time he liked her. You remember Rachel\r\nWest, not pretty, but with a nice expression--and what does beauty\r\nmatter? She is engaged to Mr. Scarlett."\r\n\r\n"Quiet, decent chap," said Doll; "and I like _her_. No nonsense about\r\nher. Good thing he wasn\'t drowned."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Harvey will feel it. He confided to me that she was his ideal. Now\r\nRachel is everything that is sweet and good and dear, and she will make\r\na most excellent wife, but I should never have thought, would you, that\r\nshe could be anybody\'s ideal?"\r\n\r\nDoll opened his mouth to say, "That depends," but remembered that his\r\nwife had taken an unaccountable dislike to that simple phrase, and\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt, who was spending Christmas with his family, was the only\r\nperson at Warpington Towers who read the papers. On this particular\r\nmorning he came down to a late breakfast after the others had finished.\r\nHis father, who was always down at eight, secretly admired his son\'s\r\naristocratic habits, while he affected to laugh at them. "Shameful\r\nluxurious ways, these young men in the Guards. Fashionable society is\r\nrotten, sir; rotten to the core. Never get up till noon. My boy is as\r\nbad as any of them."\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt propped up the paper open before him while he sipped his\r\ncoffee and glanced down the columns. His travelling eye reached Hugh\'s\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt rarely betrayed any feeling except ennui, but as he read,\r\nastonishment got the better of him.\r\n\r\n"By George!" he said, below his breath.\r\n\r\nThe bit of omelette on its way to his mouth was slowly lowered again,\r\nand remained sticking on the end of his fork.\r\n\r\n_What did it mean?_ He recalled that scene in Hugh\'s rooms _only last\r\nweek_. He had spoken of it to no one, for he intended to earn gratitude\r\nby his discretion. Of course, Scarlett was going to marry Lady Newhaven\r\nafter a decent interval. She was a very beautiful woman, with a large\r\njointure, and she was obviously in love with him. The question of her\r\nconduct was not considered. It never entered Captain Pratt\'s head, any\r\nmore than that of a ten-year-old child. He was aware that all the women\r\nof the upper classes were immoral, except newly come-out girls. That was\r\nan established fact. The only difference between the individuals, which\r\ncaused a separation as of the sheep from the goats, was whether they\r\nwere compromised or not. Lady Newhaven was not, unless he chose to\r\ncompromise her. No breath of scandal had ever touched her.\r\n\r\nBut what was Scarlett about? Could they have quarrelled? What did it\r\nmean? _And what would she do now?_\r\n\r\n"By George!" said Captain Pratt, again, and the agate eyes narrowed down\r\nto two slits.\r\n\r\nHe sat a long time motionless, his untasted breakfast before him. His\r\nmind was working, weighing, applying now its scales, now its\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRachel and Hugh were sitting together looking at a paragraph in the\r\n_Morning Post_.\r\n\r\n"Does Miss Gresley take any interest?" said Hugh.\r\n\r\nHe was a little jealous of Hester. This illness, the cause of which had\r\nsincerely grieved him, had come at an inopportune moment. Hester was\r\nalways taking Rachel from him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rachel, "a little when she remembers. But she can only think\r\nof one thing."\r\n\r\n"That unhappy book."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I think the book was to Hester something of what you are to me.\r\nHer whole heart was wrapped up in it--and she has lost it. Hugh,\r\nwhatever happens, you must not be lost now. It is too late. I could not\r\nbear it."\r\n\r\n"I can only be lost if you throw me away," said Hugh.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"Lady Newhaven will know to-day," said Rachel at last. "I tried to break\r\nit to her, but she did not believe me."\r\n\r\n"Rachel," said Hugh, stammering, "I meant to tell you the other day,\r\nonly we were interrupted, that _she_ came to my rooms the evening before\r\nI came down here. I should not have minded quite so much, but Captain\r\nPratt came in with me and--found her there."\r\n\r\n"Oh Hugh, that dreadful man! Poor woman!"\r\n\r\n"Poor woman!" said Hugh, his eyes flashing. "It was poor you I thought\r\nof. Poor Rachel! to be marrying a man who--"\r\n\r\nThere was another silence.\r\n\r\n"I have one great compensation," said Rachel, laying her cool, strong\r\nhand on his. "You are open with me. You keep nothing back. You need not\r\nhave mentioned this unlucky meeting, but you did. It was like you. I\r\ntrust you entirely, Hugh. I bless and thank you for loving me. If my\r\nlove can make you happy, oh Hughie, you will be happy."\r\n\r\nHugh shrank from her. The faltered words were as a two-edged sword.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the sensitive, paling face with tender comprehension. The\r\nmother-look crept into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"If there is anything else that you wish to tell me, tell me now."\r\n\r\nA wild, overwhelming impulse to fling himself over the precipice out of\r\nthe reach of those stabbing words! A horrible nauseating recoil that\r\nseemed to rend his whole being.\r\n\r\nSomebody said hoarsely:\r\n\r\n"There is nothing else."\r\n\r\nIt was his own voice, but not his will, that spoke. Had any one ever\r\nmade him suffer like this woman who loved him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven had returned to Westhope ill with suspense and anxiety.\r\nShe had felt sure she should successfully waylay Hugh in his rooms,\r\nconvinced that if they could but meet the clouds between them (to borrow\r\nfrom her vocabulary) would instantly roll away. They had met, and the\r\nclouds had not rolled away. She vainly endeavored to attribute Hugh\'s\r\nevident anger at the sight of her to her want of prudence, to the\r\naccident of Captain Pratt\'s presence. She would not admit the thought\r\nthat Hugh had ceased to care for her, but it needed a good deal of\r\nforcible thrusting away. She could hear the knock of the unwelcome guest\r\nupon her door, and though always refused admittance he withdrew only to\r\nreturn. She had been grievously frightened, too, at having been seen in\r\nequivocal circumstances by such a man as Captain Pratt. The very\r\nremembrance made her shiver.\r\n\r\n"How angry Edward would have been," she said to herself. "I wonder\r\nwhether he would have advised me to write a little note to Captain\r\nPratt, explaining how I came there, and asking him not to mention it.\r\nBut, of course, he won\'t repeat it. He won\'t want to make an enemy of me\r\nand Hugh. The Pratts think so much of me. And when I marry Hugh"--(knock\r\nat the mental door)--"_if ever_ I marry Hugh, we will be civil to him\r\nand have him to stay. Edward never would, but I don\'t think so much of\r\ngood family, and all that, as Edward did. We will certainly ask him."\r\n\r\nIt was not till after luncheon that Lady Newhaven, after scanning the\r\n_Ladies\' Pictorial_, languidly opened the _Morning Post_.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the paper fell from her hands on to the floor. She seized it up\r\nand read again the paragraph which had caught her eye.\r\n\r\n"No! No!" she gasped. "It is not true. It is not possible." And she read\r\nit a third time.\r\n\r\nThe paper fell from her nerveless hands again, and this time it remained\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether until this moment Lady Newhaven had known what\r\nsuffering was. She had talked freely of it to others. She had sung, as\r\nif it were her own composition, "Cleansing Fires." She often said it\r\nmight have been written for her.\r\n\r\n     In the cruel fire of sorrow,\r\n                   [_slow, soft pedal_.\r\n     Cast thy heart, do not faint or wail,\r\n                   [_both pedals down, quicker_.\r\n     Let thy hand be firm and steady,\r\n                   [_loud, and hold on to last syllable_.\r\n     Do not let thy spi-rit quail,\r\n                   [_bang! B natural. With resolution_.\r\n     Bu-ut. . . .\r\n         [_hurricane of false notes, etc., etc._\r\n\r\nBut now, poor thing, the fire had reached her, and her spirit quailed\r\nimmediately. Perhaps it was only natural that as her courage failed\r\nsomething else should take its place; an implacable burning resentment\r\nagainst her two betrayers, her lover and her friend. She rocked herself\r\nto and fro. Lover and friend. "Oh, never, never trust in man\'s love or\r\nwoman\'s friendship henceforth forever!" So learned Lady Newhaven the\r\nlesson of suffering.\r\n\r\n"Lover and friend hast Thou put far from me," she sobbed, "and mine\r\nacquaintance out of my sight."\r\n\r\nA ring at the door-bell proved that the latter part of the text, at any\r\nrate, was not true in her case.\r\n\r\nA footman entered.\r\n\r\n"Not at home. Not at home," she said, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I said not at home, but the gentleman said I was to take up his card,"\r\nsaid the man, presenting a card.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Pratt tipped, he tipped heavily.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven read it.\r\n\r\n"No. Yes. I will see him," she said. It flashed across her mind that she\r\nmust be civil to him, and that her eyes were not red. She had not shed\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe man picked the newspaper from the floor, put it on a side table, and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt came in, bland, deferential, orchid in button-hole.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he was actually in the room, his cold appraising eyes\r\nupon her, that the poor woman realized that her position towards him had\r\nchanged. She could not summon up the nonchalant distant civility which,\r\naccording to her ideas, was sufficient for her country neighbors in\r\ngeneral, and the Pratts in particular.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt opined that the weather, though cold, was seasonable.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven agreed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt regretted the hard frost on account of the hunting. Four\r\nhunters eating their heads off, etc.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven thought the thaw might come any day.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt had been skating yesterday on the parental flooded meadow.\r\nFlooded with fire-engine. Men out of work. Glad of employment, etc.\r\n\r\nHow kind of Captain Pratt to employ them.\r\n\r\nNot at all. It was his father. Duties of the landed gentry, etc. He\r\nbelieved if the frost continued they would skate on Beaumere.\r\n\r\nNo; no one was allowed to skate on Beaumere. The springs rendered the\r\nice treacherous.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt turned the gold knob of his stick slowly in his thick,\r\nwhite fingers. He looked carefully at Lady Newhaven, as a connoisseur\r\nwith intent to buy looks at a piece of valuable china. She was\r\naccustomed to being looked at, but there was something in Captain\r\nPratt\'s prolonged scrutiny which filled her with vague alarm. She\r\nwrithed under it. He observed her uneasiness, but he did not remove his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWere the boys well?\r\n\r\nThey were quite well, thanks. She was cowed.\r\n\r\nWere they fond of skating?\r\n\r\nVery fond.\r\n\r\nMight he suggest that they should come over and skate at Warpington\r\nTowers to-morrow. He himself would be there, and would take charge of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe rose slowly, as one who has made up his mind. Lady Newhaven feared it\r\nwould be troubling Captain Pratt too much.\r\n\r\nIt would be no trouble to Captain Pratt; on the contrary, a pleasure.\r\n\r\nHis hand was now extended. Lady Newhaven had to put hers into it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps next week if the frost held. She tried to withdraw her hand. Oh,\r\nwell, then, to-morrow; certainly, to-morrow.\r\n\r\n"You may rely on me to take care of them," said Captain Pratt, still\r\nholding her hand. He obliged her to look at him. His hard eyes met her\r\nfrightened blue ones. "You may rely on my discretion entirely--in all\r\nmatters," he said, meaningly.\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven winced, and her hand trembled violently in his.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the shrinking little hand, let it go, and went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n     "Le temps apporte, emporte, mais ne rapporte pas."\r\n\r\n\r\n"May I come in?" said the Bishop, tapping at Hester\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Do come in."\r\n\r\nHester was lying propped up by many cushions on a sofa in the little\r\nsitting-room leading out of her bedroom. She looked a mere shadow in the\r\nfire-light.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him mechanically, but her face relapsed at once into the\r\napathetic expression which sat so ill upon it. Her lustreless eyes fixed\r\nthemselves again on the fire.\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to do this afternoon?" she said, politely. It\r\nwas obvious she did not care what he did.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Westhope on business," he said, looking narrowly at her.\r\nIt was all very well for Dr. Brown to say she must be roused; but how\r\nwere his instructions to be carried out?\r\n\r\n"I am a great deal of trouble to you," said Hester. "Could not I be sent\r\nto a home, or a place where you go through a cure, where I should be out\r\nof the way till I\'m well?"\r\n\r\n"Have I deserved that, Hester?"\r\n\r\n"No; but you know I always try to wound my best friends."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t succeed, my child, because they know you are in heavy\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"We will not speak of that," said Hester, quickly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the time has come to speak of it. Why do you shut us out of this\r\nsorrow? Don\'t you see that you make our burdens heavier by refusing to\r\nlet us share yours?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t share it," said Hester; "no one can."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I have not grieved over it?"\r\n\r\n"I know you have, but it was waste of time. It\'s no good--no good.\r\nPlease don\'t cheer me, and tell me I shall write better books yet, and\r\nthat this trial is for my good. Dear Bishop, don\'t try and comfort me. I\r\ncan\'t bear it."\r\n\r\n"My poor child, I firmly believe you will write better books than the\r\none which is lost, and I firmly believe that you will one day look back\r\nupon this time as a stop in your spiritual life, but I had not intended\r\nto say so. The thought was in my mind, but it was you who put the words\r\ninto my mouth."\r\n\r\n"I was so afraid that--"\r\n\r\n"That I was going to improve the occasion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Dr. Brown and the nurse are so dreadfully cheerful now, and always\r\ntalking about the future, and how celebrated I shall be some day. If you\r\nand Rachel follow suit I shall--I think I shall--go out of my mind."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Brown may be right," Hester went on. "I may live to seventy, and I\r\nmay become--what does he call it?--a distinguished author. I don\'t know\r\nand I don\'t care. But whatever happens in the future, nothing will bring\r\nback the book which was burned."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not speak. He dared not.\r\n\r\n"If I had a child," Hester continued, in the exhausted voice with which\r\nhe was becoming familiar, "and it died, I might have ten more, beautiful\r\nand clever and affectionate, but they would not replace the one I had\r\nlost. Only if it were a child," a little tremor broke the dead level of\r\nthe passionless voice, "I should meet it again in heaven. There is the\r\nresurrection of the body for the children of the body, but there is no\r\nresurrection that I ever heard of for the children of the brain."\r\n\r\nHester held her thin right hand with its disfigured first finger to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n"A great writer who had married and had children, whom she worshipped,\r\nonce told me that the pang of motherhood is that even your children\r\ndon\'t seem your very own. They are often more like some one else than\r\ntheir parents, perhaps the spinster sister-in-law, whom every one\r\ndislikes, or some entire alien. Look at Regie. He is just like me, which\r\nmust be a great trial to Minna. And they grow up bewildering their\r\nparents at every turn by characteristics they don\'t understand. But she\r\nsaid the spiritual children, the books, are really ours.\r\n\r\n"If you were other than you are," said Hester, after a long pause, "you\r\nwould reprove me for worshipping my own work. I suppose love is worship.\r\nI loved it for itself, not for anything it was to bring me. That is what\r\npeople like Dr. Brown don\'t understand. It was part of myself. But it\r\nwas the better part. The side of me which loves success, and which he is\r\nalways appealing to, had no hand in it. My one prayer was that I might\r\nbe worthy to write it, that it might not suffer by contact with me. I\r\nspent myself upon it." Hester\'s voice sank. "I knew what I was doing. I\r\njoyfully spent my health, my eyesight, my very life upon it. I was\r\nimpelled to do it by what you perhaps will call a blind instinct, what\r\nI, poor simpleton and dupe, believed at the time to be nothing less than\r\nthe will of God."\r\n\r\n"You will think so again," said the Bishop, "when you realize that the\r\nbook has left its mark and influence upon your character. It has taught\r\nyou a great deal. The mere fact of writing it has strengthened you. The\r\noutward and visible form is dead, but its spirit lives on in you. You\r\nwill realize this presently."\r\n\r\n"Shall I? On the contrary, the only thing I realize is that it is not\r\nGod who is mocked, but His foolish children who try to do His bidding.\r\nIt seems He is not above putting a lying spirit in the mouth of his\r\nprophets. Do you think I still blame poor James for his bonfire, or his\r\njealous little wife who wanted to get rid of me? Why should I? They\r\nacted up to their lights as your beloved Jock did when he squeezed the\r\nlife out of that rabbit in Westhope Park. In all those days when I did\r\nnot say anything, it was because I felt I had been deceived. I had done\r\nmy part. God had not done His. He should have seen to it that the book\r\nwas not destroyed. You prayed by me once when you thought I was\r\nunconscious. I heard all right. I should have laughed if I could, but it\r\nwas too much trouble."\r\n\r\n"These thoughts will pass away with your illness," said the Bishop. "You\r\nare like a man who has had a blow, who staggers about giddy and dazed,\r\nand sees the pavement rising up to strike him. The pavement is firm\r\nunder his feet all the time."\r\n\r\n"Half of me knows in a dim blind way that God is the same always," said\r\nHester, "while the other half says, \'Curse God and die.\'"\r\n\r\n"That is the giddiness, the vertigo after the shock."\r\n\r\n"Is it? I dare say you are right. But I don\'t care either way."\r\n\r\n"Why trouble your mind about it, or about anything?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have a feeling, indeed, it would be extraordinary if I had\r\nnot, for Dr. Brown is always rubbing it in, that I ought to meet my\r\ntrouble bravely, and not sink down under it, as he thinks I am doing\r\nnow. He says others have suffered more than I have. I know that, for I\r\nhave been with them. It seems," said Hester, with the ghost of a smile,\r\n"that there is an etiquette about these things, just as the blinds are\r\ndrawn up after a funeral. The moment has come for me, but I have not\r\ndrawn up my blinds."\r\n\r\n"You will draw them up presently."\r\n\r\n"I would draw them up now," said Hester, looking at him steadily, "if I\r\ncould. I owe it to you and Rachel to try, and I have tried, but I\r\ncan\'t."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s cheek paled a little.\r\n\r\n"Take your own time," he said, but his heart sank.\r\n\r\nHe saw a little boat with torn sail and broken rudder, drifting on to a\r\nlee shore.\r\n\r\n"I seem to have been living at a great strain for the last year," said\r\nHester. "I don\'t know one word from another now, but I think I mean\r\nconcentration. That means holding your mind to one place, doesn\'t it?\r\nWell, now, something seems to have broken, and I can\'t fix it to\r\nanything any more. I can talk to you and Rachel for a few minutes if I\r\nhold my mind tight, but I can\'t really attend, and directly I am alone,\r\nor you leave off speaking, my mind gets loose from my body and wanders\r\naway to an immense distance, to long, dreary, desert places. And then if\r\nyou come in I make a great effort to bring it back, and to open my eyes,\r\nbecause if I don\'t you think I\'m ill. You don\'t mind if I shut them now,\r\ndo you?--because I\'ve explained about them, and holding them open does\r\ntire me so. I wish they could be propped open. And--my mind gets farther\r\nand further away every day. I hope you and Rachel won\'t think I am\r\ngiving way if--sometime--I really can\'t bring it back any longer."\r\n\r\n"Dear Hester, no."\r\n\r\n"I will not talk any more then. If you and Rachel understand, that is\r\nall that matters. I used to think so many things mattered, but I don\'t\r\nnow. And don\'t think I\'m grieving about the book while I\'m lying still.\r\nI have grieved, but it is over. I\'m too tired to be glad or sorry about\r\nanything any more."\r\n\r\nHester lay back spent and gray among her pillows.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop roused her to take the stimulant put ready near at hand, and\r\nthen sat a long time watching her. She seemed unconscious of his\r\npresence. At last the nurse came in, and he went out silently, and\r\nreturned to his study. Rachel was waiting there to hear the result of\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n"I can do nothing," he said. "I have no power to help her. After forty\r\nyears ministry I have not a word to say to her. She is beyond human\r\naid--at least, she is beyond mine."\r\n\r\n"You think she will die?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see what is going to happen to prevent it, but I am certain it\r\nmight be prevented."\r\n\r\n"You could not rouse her?"\r\n\r\n"No, she discounted anything I could have said, by asking me not to say\r\nit. That is the worst of Hester. The partition between her mind and that\r\nof other people is so thin that she sees what they are thinking about.\r\nThank God, Rachel, that you are not cursed with the artistic\r\ntemperament! That is why she has never married. She sees too much. I am\r\nnot a match-maker, but if I had had to take the responsibility, I should\r\nhave married her at seventeen to Lord Newhaven."\r\n\r\n"You know he asked her?"\r\n\r\n"No, I did not know it."\r\n\r\n"It was a long time ago, when first she came out. Lady Susan was anxious\r\nfor it, and pressed her. I sometimes think if she had been given time,\r\nand if her aunt had let her alone--but he married within the year. But\r\nwhat are we to do about Hester? Dr. Brown says something must be done,\r\nor she will sink in a decline. I would give my life for her, but I can\r\ndo nothing. I have tried."\r\n\r\n"So have I," said the Bishop. "But it has come to this. We have got to\r\ntrust the one person whom we always show we tacitly distrust by trying\r\nto take matters out of His hands. We must trust God. So far we have\r\nstrained ourselves to keep Hester alive, but she is past our help now.\r\nShe is in none the worse case for that. We are her two best friends save\r\none. We must leave her to the best Friend of all. God has her in His\r\nhand. For the moment the greater love holds her away from the less, like\r\nthe mother who takes her sick child into her arms, apart from the other\r\nchildren who are playing round her. Hester is in God\'s keeping, and that\r\nis enough for us. And now take a turn in the garden, Rachel. You are too\r\nmuch in-doors. I am going out on business."\r\n\r\nWhen Rachel had left him the Bishop opened his despatch-box and took out\r\na letter.\r\n\r\nIt was directed to Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"I promised to give it into her own hand a month after his death,\r\nwhenever that might happen to be," he said to himself. "There was some\r\ntrouble between them. I hope she won\'t confide it to me. Anyhow, I must\r\ngo and get it over. I wish I did not dislike her so much. I shall advise\r\nher not to read it till I am gone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n     The mouse fell from the ceiling, and the cat cried, "Allah!"\r\n                                                --Syrian Proverb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat help should come through such a recognized channel as a Bishop\r\ncould surprise no one, least of all Lady Newhaven, who had had the\r\ngreatest faith in the clergy all her life, but, nevertheless, so\r\noverwhelmed was she by despair and its physical sensations, that she\r\nvery nearly refused to see the Bishop when he called. Her faith even in\r\nlawn sleeves momentarily tottered. Who would show her any good? Poor\r\nLady Newhaven was crushed into a state of prostration so frightful that\r\nwe must not blame her if she felt that even an Archbishop would have\r\nbeen powerless to help her.\r\n\r\nShe had thought, after the engagement was announced, of rushing up to\r\nLondon and insisting on seeing Hugh; but always, after she had looked\r\nout the trains, her courage had shrunk back at the last moment. There\r\nhad been a look on Hugh\'s face during that last momentary meeting which\r\nshe could not nerve herself to see again. She had been to London already\r\nonce to see him, without success.\r\n\r\nShe knew Rachel was at the Palace at Southminster nursing Hester, and\r\ntwice she had ordered the carriage to drive over to see her, and make a\r\ndesperate appeal to her to give up Hugh. But she knew that she should\r\nfail. And Rachel would triumph over her. Women always did over a\r\ndefeated rival. Lady Newhaven had not gone. The frightful injustice of\r\nit all wrung Lady Newhaven\'s heart to the point of agony. To see her own\r\nproperty deliberately stolen from her in the light of day, as it were,\r\nin the very market-place, before everybody, without being able to raise\r\na finger to regain him! It was intolerable. For she loved Hugh as far as\r\nshe was capable of loving anything. And her mind had grown round the\r\nidea that he was hers as entirely as a tree will grow round a nail\r\nfastened into it.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was to marry Rachel, and soon. Let no one think they know\r\npain until they know jealousy.\r\n\r\nBut when the Bishop sent up a second time, asking to see her on\r\nbusiness, she consented.\r\n\r\nIt was too soon to see callers, of course. But a Bishop was different.\r\nAnd how could she refuse to admit him when she had admitted that odious\r\nCaptain Pratt only four days before. She hoped no one would become aware\r\nof that fact. It was as well for her that she could not hear the remarks\r\nof Selina and Ada Pratt, as they skated on the frozen meadows with half,\r\nnot the better-half, of Middleshire.\r\n\r\n"Poor Vi Newhaven. Yes, she won\'t see a creature. She saw Algy for a few\r\nminutes last week, but then he is an old friend, and does not count. He\r\nsaid she was quite heart-broken. He was quite upset himself. He was so\r\nfond of Ted Newhaven."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop would not even sit down. He said he was on the way to a\r\nconfirmation, and added that he had been entrusted with a letter for\r\nher, and held it towards her.\r\n\r\n"It is my husband\'s handwriting," she said, drawing back, with\r\ninstinctive fear.\r\n\r\n"It is from your husband," said the Bishop, gently, softening somewhat\r\nat the sight of the ravages which despair had made in the lovely face\r\nsince he had last seen it. "He asked me to give it into your own hand a\r\nmonth after his death."\r\n\r\n"Then he told you that--"\r\n\r\n"He told me nothing, and I wish to hear nothing."\r\n\r\n"I should like to confess all to you, to feel myself absolved," said\r\nLady Newhaven in a low voice, the letter in her trembling hand.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and he saw that she would not say all. She would\r\narrange details to suit herself, and would omit the main point\r\naltogether, whatever it might be, if, as it was more than probable, it\r\ntold against herself. He would at least save her from the hypocrisy of a\r\nhalf-confession.\r\n\r\n"If in a month\'s time you wish to make a full confession to me," he\r\nsaid, "I will hear it. But I solemnly charge you in the meanwhile to\r\nspeak to no one of this difficulty between you and your husband.\r\nWhatever it may have been, it is past. If he sinned against you, he is\r\ndead, and the least you can do is to keep silence. If you wronged\r\nhim"--Lady Newhaven shook her head vehemently--"if you wronged him,"\r\nrepeated the Bishop, his face hardening, "be silent for the sake of the\r\nchildren. It is the only miserable reparation you can make him."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand," she said, feebly.\r\n\r\n"I know that he was a kindly, gentle-natured man, and that he died a\r\nhard and bitter one," said the Bishop. "God knows what is in that\r\nletter, but your husband said it would be of the greatest comfort and\r\nassistance to you in a difficulty which he foresaw for you. I will leave\r\nyou to read it."\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe early December twilight was creeping over everything. Lady Newhaven\r\ntook the letter to the window, and after several futile attempts\r\nsucceeded in opening it.\r\n\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     "It is irreligious to mourn too long for the dead. \'I shall go to\r\n     him, but he shall not return to me\'--II. Sam. xii. 23. In the\r\n     meanwhile, until you rejoin me, I trust you will remember that it\r\n     is my especial wish that you should allow one who is in every way\r\n     worthy of you to console you for my loss, who will make you as\r\n     happy as you both deserve to be. That I died by my own hand you and\r\n     your so-called friend Miss West are of course aware. That \'the one\r\n     love of your life\' drew the short lighter you are perhaps not\r\n     aware. I waited two days to see if he would fulfil the compact, and\r\n     as he did not--I never thought he would--I retired in his place. I\r\n     present to you this small piece of information as a\r\n     wedding-present, which, if adroitly handled, may add to the harmony\r\n     of domestic life. And if by any chance he should have conceived the\r\n     dastardly, the immoral idea of deserting you in favor of some\r\n     mercenary marriage--of which I rather suspect him--you will find\r\n     this piece of information invaluable in restoring his allegiance at\r\n     once. He is yours by every sacred tie, and no treacherous female\r\n     friend must wrest him from you.\r\n\r\n                       "NEWHAVEN."\r\n\r\nLady Newhaven put the letter in her pocket, and then fainted away, with\r\nher fair head on the window-ledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\n     "There cannot be a pinch in death more sharp than this is."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s sister, Miss Keane, whose life was a perpetual orgy of\r\nmothers\' meetings and G.F.S. gatherings, was holding a district\r\nvisitors\' working party in the drawing-room at the Palace. The ladies\r\nknitted and stitched, while one of their number heaped fuel on the flame\r\nof their enthusiasm by reading aloud the "History of the Diocese of\r\nSouthminster."\r\n\r\nMiss Keane took but little heed of the presence of Rachel and Hester in\r\nher brother\'s house. Those who work mechanically on fixed lines seem, as\r\na rule, to miss the pith of life. She was kind when she remembered them,\r\nbut her heart was where her treasure was--namely, in her escritoire,\r\nwith her list of Bible-classes, and servants\' choral unions, and the\r\nlong roll of contributors to the guild of work which she herself had\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nWhen she had been up to Hester\'s room, invariably at hours when Hester\r\ncould not see her, and when she had entered Rachel\'s sledge-hammer\r\nsubscriptions in her various account-books, her attention left her\r\nvisitors. She considered them superficial, and wondered how it was that\r\nher brother could find time to spend hours talking to both of them,\r\nwhile he had rarely a moment in which to address her chosen band in the\r\ndrawing-room. She was one of those persons who find life a very prosaic\r\naffair, quite unlike the fiction she occasionally read.\r\n\r\nShe often remarked that nothing except the commonplace happened.\r\nCertainly she never observed anything else.\r\n\r\nSo Hester lay in the room above, halting feebly between two opinions,\r\nwhether to live or to die, and Rachel sat in the Bishop\'s study beneath,\r\nwaiting to make tea for him on his return from the confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf she did not make it, no one else did. Instead of ringing for it he\r\nwent without it.\r\n\r\nRachel watched the sun set--a red ball dropping down a frosty sky. It\r\nwas the last day of the year. The new year was bringing her everything.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, good-bye," she said, looking at the last rim of the sun as he\r\nsank. And she remembered other years when she had watched the sun set on\r\nthe last day of December, when life had been difficult--how difficult!\r\n\r\n"If Hester could only get better I should have nothing left to wish\r\nfor," she said, and she prayed the more fervently for her friend,\r\nbecause she knew that even if Hester died, life would still remain\r\nbeautiful; the future without her would still be flooded with happiness.\r\n\r\n"A year ago if Hester had died I should have had nothing left to live\r\nfor," she said to herself. "Now this newcomer, this man whom I have\r\nknown barely six months, fills my whole life. Are other women as narrow\r\nas I am? Can they care only for one person at a time like me? Ah,\r\nHester! forgive me, I can\'t help it."\r\n\r\nHugh was coming in presently. He had been in that morning, and the\r\nBishop had met him, and had asked him to come in again to tea. Rachel\r\ndid not know what the Bishop thought of him, but he had managed to see a\r\ngood deal of Hugh.\r\n\r\nRachel waited as impatiently as most of us, when our happiness lingers\r\nby us, loth to depart.\r\n\r\nAt last she heard the footman bringing some one across the hall.\r\n\r\nWould Hugh\'s coming ever become a common thing? Would she ever be able\r\nto greet him without this tumult of emotion, ever be able to take his\r\nhand without turning giddy on the sheer verge of bliss?\r\n\r\nThe servant announced, "Lady Newhaven."\r\n\r\nThe two women stood looking at each other. Rachel saw the marks of\r\nsuffering on the white face, and her own became as white. Her eyes fell\r\nguiltily before Lady Newhaven\'s.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me," she said.\r\n\r\n"Forgive you?" said Lady Newhaven, in a hoarse voice. "It is no use\r\nasking me for forgiveness."\r\n\r\n"You are right," said Rachel, recovering herself, and meeting Lady\r\nNewhaven\'s eyes fully. "But what is the use of coming here to abuse me?\r\nYou might have spared yourself and me this at least. It will only\r\nexhaust you and--wound me."\r\n\r\n"You must give him up," said Lady Newhaven, her hands fumbling under her\r\ncrape cloak. "I\'ve come to tell you that you must let him go."\r\n\r\nThe fact that Hugh had drawn the short lighter, and had not taken the\r\nconsequences, did not affect Lady Newhaven\'s feelings towards him in the\r\nleast, but she was vaguely aware that somehow it would affect Rachel\'s,\r\nand now it would be Rachel\'s turn to suffer.\r\n\r\nRachel paused a moment, and then said, slowly:\r\n\r\n"He does not wish to be let go."\r\n\r\n"He is mine."\r\n\r\n"He was yours once," said Rachel, her face turning from white to gray.\r\nThat wound was long in healing. "But he is mine now."\r\n\r\n"Rachel, you cannot be bad all through." Lady Newhaven was putting the\r\nconstraint upon herself which that tightly clutched paper, that poisoned\r\nweapon in reserve, enabled her to assume. For Hugh\'s sake she would only\r\nuse it if other means failed. "You must know that you ought to look upon\r\nhim as a married man. Don\'t you see"--wildly--"that we _must_ marry, to\r\nput right what was wrong? He owes it to me. People always do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they generally do," said Rachel; "but I don\'t see how it makes the\r\nwrong right."\r\n\r\n"I look upon Hugh as my husband," said Lady Newhaven.\r\n\r\n"So do I."\r\n\r\n"Rachel, he loves me. He is only marrying you for your money."\r\n\r\n"I will risk that."\r\n\r\n"I implore you on my knees to give him back to me."\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Newhaven knelt down with bare, white outstretched hands.\r\n(Tableau number one. New Series.)\r\n\r\nRachel shrank back involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Violet," she said, "and get up. I will not speak until you get\r\nup." Lady Newhaven obeyed. "If I gave back Hugh to you a hundred times\r\nit would not make him love you any more, or make him marry you. I am not\r\nkeeping him from you. This marriage is his own doing. Oh! Violet, I\'m\r\nnot young and pretty. I\'ve no illusions about myself; but I believe he\r\nreally does love me, in spite of that, and I know I love him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," said Lady Newhaven. "I mean about him. Not about\r\nyou, of course."\r\n\r\n"Here he is. Let him decide," said Rachel.\r\n\r\nHugh came in unannounced. Upon his grave face there was that\r\nconcentrated look of happiness which has settled in the very deep of the\r\nheart and gleams up into the eyes.\r\n\r\nHis face changed painfully. He glanced from one woman to the other.\r\nRachel was sorry for him. She would fain have spared him, but she could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n"Hugh," she said, gently, her steadfast eyes resting on him, "Lady\r\nNewhaven and I were talking of you. I think it would be best if she\r\nheard from your own lips what she, naturally, will not believe from\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"I will never believe," said Lady Newhaven, "that you will desert me\r\nnow, that all the past is nothing to you, and that you will cast me\r\naside for another woman."\r\n\r\nHugh looked at her steadily. Then he went up to Rachel, and taking her\r\nhand, raised it to his lips. There was in his manner a boundless\r\nreverent adoration that was to Lady Newhaven\'s jealousy as a match to\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\nRachel kept his hand.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you want him, Rachel?" gasped Lady Newhaven, holding\r\nconvulsively to a chair for support. "He has cast me aside. He will cast\r\nyou aside next, for he is a coward and a traitor. Are you sure you want\r\nto marry him? His hands are red with blood. He murdered my husband."\r\n\r\nRachel\'s hand tightened on Hugh\'s.\r\n\r\n"It was an even chance," she said. "Those who draw lots must abide by\r\nthe drawing."\r\n\r\n"It was an even chance," shrieked Lady Newhaven. "But who drew the short\r\nlighter, tell me that? Who refused to fulfil his part when the time was\r\nup? Tell me that."\r\n\r\n"You are mad," said Rachel.\r\n\r\n"I can prove it," said Lady Newhaven, holding out the letter in her\r\nshaking hands. "You may read it, Rachel. I can trust you. Not him, he\r\nwould burn it. It is from Edward; look, you know his writing, written to\r\ntell me that he," pointing at Hugh, "had drawn the short lighter, but\r\nthat, as he had not killed himself when the time came, he, Edward, did\r\nso instead. That was why he was late. We always wondered, Rachel, why he\r\nwas two days late. Read it! Read it!"\r\n\r\n"I will not read it," said Rachel, pushing away the paper. "I do not\r\nbelieve a word of it."\r\n\r\n"You shall believe it. Ask him to deny it, if he can."\r\n\r\n"You need not trouble to deny it," said Rachel, looking full at Hugh.\r\n\r\nThe world held only her and him. And as Hugh looked into her eyes his\r\nsoul rose up and scaled the heights above it till it stood beside hers.\r\n\r\nThere is a sacred place where, if we follow close in Love\'s footsteps,\r\nwe see him lay aside his earthly quiver and his bitter arrows, and turn\r\nto us as he is, with the light of God upon him, one with us as one with\r\nGod. In that pure light lies cease to be. We know them no more, neither\r\nremember them, for love and truth are one.\r\n\r\nHugh strode across to Lady Newhaven, took the letter from her, and threw\r\nit into the heart of the fire. Then he turned to Rachel.\r\n\r\n"I drew the short lighter," he said. "I meant to take the consequences\r\nat first, but when the time came--I did not. Partly I was afraid, and\r\npartly I could not leave you."\r\n\r\nIf Lady Newhaven yearned for revenge she had it then. They had both\r\nforgotten her. But she saw Rachel\'s eyes change as the eyes of a man at\r\nthe stake might change when the fire reached him. She shrank back from\r\nthe agony in them. Hugh\'s face became pinched and thin as a dead man\'s.\r\nA moment ago he saw no consequences. He saw only that he could not lie\r\nto her. His mind fell headlong from its momentary foothold. What mad\r\nimpulse had betrayed him to his ruin?\r\n\r\n"You drew the short lighter, and you let me think all the time he had,"\r\nsaid Rachel, her voice almost inaudible in its fierce passion. "You drew\r\nit, and you let him die instead of you, as any one who knew him would\r\nknow he would. And when he was dead you came to me, and kept me in\r\nignorance even--that time--when I said I trusted you."\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of that meeting was too much.\r\n\r\nRachel turned her eyes on Lady Newhaven, who was watching her\r\nterror-stricken.\r\n\r\n"I said I would not give him up, but I will," she said, violently. "You\r\ncan take him if you want him. What was it you said to me, Hugh? That if\r\nyou had drawn the short lighter you would have had to abide by it. Yes,\r\nthat was it. Your whole intercourse with me has been one lie from first\r\nto last. You were right, Violet, when you said he ought to marry you. It\r\nwill be another lie on the top of all the others."\r\n\r\n"It was what Edward wished," faltered his widow. "He says so in the\r\nletter that has just been burned."\r\n\r\n"Lord Newhaven wished it," said Rachel, looking at the miserable man\r\nbetween them. "Poor Lord Newhaven! First his honor. Then his life. You\r\nhave taken everything he had. But there are still his shoes."\r\n\r\n"Rachel!" said Hugh, suddenly, and he fell on his knees before her,\r\nclasping the hem of her gown.\r\n\r\nShe pushed him violently from her, tearing her gown in releasing it from\r\nhis frenzied grasp.\r\n\r\n"Leave me," she whispered. Her voice was almost gone. "Coward and liar,\r\nI will have nothing more to do with you."\r\n\r\nHe got upon his feet somehow. The two gray desperate faces spent with\r\npassion faced each other. They were past speech.\r\n\r\nHe read his death-warrant in her merciless eyes. She looked at the\r\ndespair in his without flinching.\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment, and then feeling his way, like one half blind, left\r\nthe room, unconsciously pushing aside Lady Newhaven, whom both had\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nShe gave one terrified glance at Rachel, and slipped out after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n     I thought, "Now, if I had been a woman, such\r\n     As God made women, to save men by love--\r\n     By just my love I might have saved this man."\r\n                       --ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Has Lady Newhaven been here?" said the Bishop, coming into the study,\r\nhis hands full of papers. "I thought I saw her carriage driving away as\r\nI came up."\r\n\r\n"She has been here."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked up suddenly, his attention arrested by Rachel\'s voice.\r\nThere is a white heat of anger that mimics the pallor of a fainting fit.\r\nThe Bishop thought she was about to swoon, until he saw her eyes. Those\r\ngentle faithful eyes were burning. He shrank as one who sees the glare\r\nof fire raging inside familiar windows.\r\n\r\n"My poor child," he said, and he sat down heavily in his leather\r\narm-chair.\r\n\r\nRachel still stood. She looked at him, and her lips moved, but no sound\r\ncame forth.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked intently at her.\r\n\r\n"Where is Scarlett?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Hugh is gone," she said, stammering. "I have broken off my engagement\r\nwith him. He will never come back."\r\n\r\nAnd she fell suddenly on her knees, and hid her convulsed face against\r\nthe arm of a chair.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not move. He waited for this paroxysm of anger to\r\nsubside. He had never seen Rachel angry before in all the years he had\r\nknown her, but he watched her without surprise. Only stupid people think\r\nthat coal cannot burn as fiercely as tow.\r\n\r\nShe remained a long time on her knees, her face hidden. The Bishop did\r\nnot hurry her. At last she began to sob silently, shuddering from head\r\nto foot.\r\n\r\nThen he came and sat down near her, and took the cold clinched hands in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n"Rachel, tell me," he said, gently.\r\n\r\nShe tried to pull her hands away, but he held them firmly. He obliged\r\nher to look up at him. She raised her fierce, disfigured face for a\r\nmoment, and then let it fall on his hands and hers.\r\n\r\n"I am a wicked woman," she said. "Don\'t trouble about me. I\'m not worth\r\nit. I thought I would have kept all suffering from him, but now--if I\r\ncould make him suffer--I would."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt he is suffering."\r\n\r\n"Not enough. Not like me. And I loved him and trusted him. And he is\r\nfalse, too, like that other man I loved; like you, only I have not found\r\nyou out yet; like Hester; like all the rest. I will never trust any one\r\nagain. I will never be deceived again. This is--the--second time."\r\n\r\nAnd Rachel broke into a passion of tears.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop released her hands and felt for his own handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen he waited, praying silently. The clock had made a long circuit\r\nbefore she raised herself.\r\n\r\n"I am very selfish," she said, looking with compunction at the kind,\r\ntired face. "I ought to have gone to my room instead of breaking down\r\nhere. Dear Bishop, forgive me. It is past now. I shall not give way\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Will you make me some tea?" he said.\r\n\r\nShe made the tea with shaking hands and awkward, half-blind movements.\r\nIt was close on dinner-time, but she did not notice it. He obliged her\r\nto drink some, and then he settled himself in his leather arm-chair. He\r\nwent over his engagements for the evening. In half an hour he ought to\r\nbe dining with Canon Glynn to meet an old college friend. At eleven he\r\nhad arranged to see a young clergyman whose conscience was harrying\r\nhim. He wrote a note on his knee without moving, saying he could not\r\ncome, and touched the bell at his elbow. When the servant had taken the\r\nnote he relapsed into the depths of his arm-chair and sipped his tea.\r\n\r\n"I think, Rachel," he said at last, "that I ought to tell you that I\r\npartly guess at your reason for breaking off your engagement. I have\r\nknown for some time that there was trouble between the Newhavens. From\r\nwhat Lady Newhaven said to me to-day, and from the fact that she has\r\nbeen here, and that immediately after seeing her you broke your\r\nengagement with Scarlett, I must come to the conclusion that Scarlett\r\nhad been the cause of this trouble."\r\n\r\nRachel had regained her composure. Her face was white and hard.\r\n\r\n"You are right," she said. "He was at one time--her lover."\r\n\r\n"And you consider, in consequence, that he is unfit to become your\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"No. He told me about it before he asked me to marry him. I accepted\r\nhim, knowing it."\r\n\r\n"Then he was trying to retrieve himself. He acted towards you, at any\r\nrate, like an honorable man."\r\n\r\nRachel laughed. "So I thought at the time."\r\n\r\n"If you accepted him, knowing about his past, I don\'t see why you should\r\nhave thrown him over. One dishonorable action sincerely repented does\r\nnot make a dishonorable man."\r\n\r\n"I did not know all," said Rachel. "I do now."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked into the fire.\r\n\r\nHer next words surprised him.\r\n\r\n"You really cared for Lord Newhaven, did you not?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"Then as you know the one thing he risked his life to conceal for the\r\nsake of his children--namely, his wife\'s misconduct--I think I had\r\nbetter tell you the rest."\r\n\r\nSo Rachel told him in harsh, bald language the story of the drawing of\r\nlots, and how she and Lady Newhaven had remained ignorant as to which\r\nhad drawn the short lighter. How Hugh had drawn it; how when the time\r\ncame he had failed to fulfil the agreement; how two days later Lord\r\nNewhaven had killed himself; and how she and Lady Newhaven had both, of\r\ncourse, concluded that Lord Newhaven must have drawn the short lighter.\r\n\r\nRachel went on, her hard voice shaking a little.\r\n\r\n"Hugh had told me that he had had an entanglement with a married woman.\r\nI knew it long before he spoke of it, but just because he risked losing\r\nme by owning it I loved and trusted him all the more. I thought he was,\r\nat any rate, an upright man. After Lord Newhaven\'s death he asked me to\r\nmarry him, and I accepted him. And when we were talking quietly one\r\nday"--Rachel\'s face became, if possible, whiter than before--"I told him\r\nthat I knew of the drawing of lots. (He thought no one knew of it except\r\nthe dead man and himself.) And I told him that he must not blame himself\r\nfor Lord Newhaven\'s death. He had brought it on himself. I said to\r\nhim"--Rachel\'s voice trembled more and more-"\'It was an even chance. You\r\nmight have drawn the short lighter yourself.\' And--he--said that if he\r\nhad, he should have had to abide by it."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop shaded his eyes with his hand. It seemed cruel to look at\r\nRachel, as it is cruel to watch a man drown.\r\n\r\n"And how do you know he did draw it?" he said.\r\n\r\n"It seems Lord Newhaven left his wife a letter, which she has only just\r\nreceived, telling her so. She brought it here to-day to show me."\r\n\r\n"Ah! A letter! And you read it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Rachel, scornfully, "I did not read it. I did not believe a\r\nword she said about it. Hugh was there, and I told him I trusted him;\r\nand he took the letter from her, and put it in the fire."\r\n\r\n"And did he not contradict it?"\r\n\r\n"No. He said it was true. He has lied to me over and over again; but I\r\nsaw he was speaking the truth for once."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how other people regard those things," said Rachel at\r\nlast, less harshly--she was gradually recovering herself--"but I know to\r\nme it was much worse that he could deceive me than that he should have\r\nbeen Lady Newhaven\'s lover. I did feel that dreadfully. I had to choke\r\ndown my jealousy when he kissed me. He had kissed her first. He had made\r\nthat side of his love common and profane; but the other side remained. I\r\nclung to that. I believed he really loved me, and that supported me and\r\nenabled me to forgive him, though men don\'t know what that forgiveness\r\ncosts us. Only the walls of our rooms know that. But it seems to me much\r\nworse to have failed me on that other side as well--to have deceived\r\nme--to have told me a lie--just when--just when we were talking\r\nintimately."\r\n\r\n"It was infinitely worse," said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"And it was the action of a coward to draw lots in the first instance if\r\nhe did not mean to abide by the drawing, and the action of a traitor,\r\nonce they were drawn, not to abide by them. But yet, if he had told\r\nme--if he had only told me the whole truth--I loved him so entirely that\r\nI would have forgiven--_even that_. But whenever I alluded to it, he\r\nlied."\r\n\r\n"He was afraid of losing you."\r\n\r\n"He has lost me by his deceit. He would not have lost me if he had told\r\nme the truth. I think--I know--that I could have got over anything,\r\nforgiven anything, even his cowardice, if he had only admitted it and\r\nbeen straightforward with me. A little plain dealing was all I asked,\r\nbut--I did not get it."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked sadly at her. Straightforwardness is so seldom the\r\nfirst requirement a woman makes of the man she loves. Women, as a rule,\r\nregard men and their conduct only from the point of view of their\r\nrelation to women--as sons, as husbands, as fathers. Yet Rachel, it\r\nseemed, could forgive Hugh\'s sin against her as a woman, but not his\r\nfurther sin against her as a friend.\r\n\r\n"Yet it seems he did speak the truth at last," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And after he had destroyed the letter, which was the only proof against\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have thrown him over," said the Bishop, slowly, "for you\r\nnever loved him."\r\n\r\n"I deceived myself in that case," said Rachel, bitterly. "My only fear\r\nwas that I loved him too much."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop\'s face had become fixed and stern.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Rachel," he said. "You fell desperately in love with an\r\ninferior man. He is charming, refined, well-bred, and with a picturesque\r\nmind, but that is all. He is inferior. He is by nature shallow and hard\r\n(the two generally go together), without moral backbone, the kind of man\r\nwho never faces a difficulty, who always flinches when it comes to the\r\npoint, the stuff out of which liars and cowards are made. His one\r\nredeeming quality is his love for you. I have seen men in love before. I\r\nhave never seen a man care more for a woman than he cares for you. His\r\nlove for you has taken entire possession of him, and by it he will sink\r\nor swim."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop paused. Rachel\'s face worked.\r\n\r\n"He deceived you," said the Bishop, "not because he wished to deceive\r\nyou, but because he was in a horrible position, and because his first\r\nimpulse of love was to keep you at any price. But his love for you was\r\nraising him even while he deceived you. Did he spend sleepless nights\r\nbecause for months he vilely deceived Lord Newhaven? No. Rectitude was\r\nnot in him. His conscience was not awake. But I tell you, Rachel, he has\r\nsuffered like a man on the rack from deceiving you. I knew by his face\r\nas soon as I saw him that he was undergoing some great mental strain. I\r\ndid not understand it, but I do now."\r\n\r\nRachel\'s mind, always slow, moved, stumbled to its bleeding feet.\r\n\r\n"It was remorse," she said, turning her face away.\r\n\r\n"It was not remorse. It was repentance. Remorse is bitter. Repentance is\r\nhumble. His love for you has led him to it. Not your love for him,\r\nRachel, which breaks down at the critical moment; his love for you which\r\nhas brought him for the first time to the perception of the higher life,\r\nto the need of God\'s forgiveness, which I know from things he has said,\r\nhas made him long to lead a better life, one worthier of you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t," said Rachel. "I can\'t bear it."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop rose, and stood facing her.\r\n\r\n"And at last," he went on--"at last, in a moment, when you showed your\r\nfull trust and confidence in him, he shook off for an instant the clogs\r\nof the nature which he brought into the world, and rose to what he had\r\nnever been before--your equal. And his love transcended the lies that\r\nlove itself on its lower plane had prompted. He reached the place where\r\nhe could no longer lie to you. And then, though his whole future\r\nhappiness depended on one more lie, he spoke the truth."\r\n\r\nRachel put out her hand as if to ward off what was coming.\r\n\r\n"And how did you meet him the first time he spoke the truth to you?"\r\ncontinued the Bishop, inexorably. "You say you loved him, and yet--you\r\nspurned him from you, you thrust him down into hell. You stooped to him\r\nin the beginning. He was nothing until your fancied love fell upon him.\r\nAnd then you break him. It is women like you who do more harm in the\r\nworld than the bad ones. The harm that poor fool Lady Newhaven did him\r\nis as nothing compared to the harm you have done him. You were his god,\r\nand you have deserted him. And you say you loved him. May God preserve\r\nmen from the love of women if that is all that a good woman\'s love is\r\ncapable of."\r\n\r\n"I can do nothing," said Rachel, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"Do nothing!" said the Bishop, fiercely. "You can do nothing when you\r\nare responsible for a man\'s soul God will require his soul at your\r\nhands. Scarlett gave it into your keeping, and you took it. You had no\r\nbusiness to take it if you meant to throw it away. And now you say you\r\ncan do nothing!"\r\n\r\n"What can I do?" said Rachel, faintly.\r\n\r\n"Forgive him."\r\n\r\n"Forgiveness won\'t help him. The only forgiveness he would care for is\r\nto marry me."\r\n\r\n"Of course. It is the only way you can forgive him."\r\n\r\nRachel turned away. Her stubborn, quivering face showed a frightful\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop watched her.\r\n\r\n"My child," he said, gently, "we all say we follow Christ, but most of\r\nus only follow him and his cross--part of the way. When we are told that\r\nour Lord bore our sins, and was wounded for our transgressions, I\r\nsuppose that meant that He felt as if they were His own in His great\r\nlove for us. But when you shrink from bearing your fellow-creature\'s\r\ntransgressions, it shows that your love is small."\r\n\r\nRachel was silent.\r\n\r\n"If you really love him you will forgive him."\r\n\r\nRachel clinched and unclinched her hands.\r\n\r\n"You are appealing to a nobility and goodness which are not in me," she\r\nsaid, stubbornly.\r\n\r\n"I appeal to nothing but your love. If you really love him you will\r\nforgive him."\r\n\r\n"He has broken my heart."\r\n\r\n"I thought that was it. It is yourself you are thinking of. But what is\r\nhe suffering at this moment? You do not know or care. Where is he now,\r\nthat poor man who loves you? Rachel, if you had ever known despair, you\r\nwould not thrust a fellow creature down into it."\r\n\r\n"I have known it," said Rachel, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"Were not you deserted once? You were deserted to very little purpose,\r\nif after that you can desert another. Go back in your mind,\r\nand--remember. Where you stood once he stands now. You and his sin have\r\nput him there. You and his sin have tied him to his stake. Will you\r\nrange yourself for ever on the side of his sin? Will you stand by and\r\nsee him perish?"\r\n\r\nSilence; like the silence round a death-bed.\r\n\r\n"He is in a great strait. Only love can save him."\r\n\r\nRachel flung out her arms with an inarticulate cry.\r\n\r\n"I will forgive him," she said. "I will forgive him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n     "Les \xe2mes dont j\'aurai besoin,\r\n     Et les \xe9toiles sont trop loin;\r\n     Je mourral dans un coin."\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Hugh shook off Lady Newhaven when she followed him out of the Palace\r\nhe did not know. There had been some difficulty. She had spoken to him,\r\nhad urged something upon him. But he had got rid of her somehow, and had\r\nfound himself sitting in his bedroom at the Southminster Hotel. Anything\r\nto be alone! He had felt that was the one thing in life to attain. But\r\nnow that he was alone, solitude suddenly took monstrous and hideous\r\nproportions, and became a horror to flee from. He could not bear the\r\nface of a fellow-creature. He could not bear this ghoul of solitude.\r\nThere was no room for him between these great millstones. They pressed\r\nupon him till he felt they were crushing him to death between them. In\r\nvain he endeavored to compose himself, to recollect himself. But\r\nexhaustion gradually did for him what he could not do for himself.\r\n\r\nRachel had thrown him over. He had always known she would, and--she had.\r\n\r\nThey were to have been married in a few weeks; three weeks and one day.\r\nHe marked a day off every morning when he waked. He had thought of her\r\nas his wife till the thought had become part of himself. Its roots were\r\nin his inmost being. He tore it out now, and looked at it apart from\r\nhimself, as a man bleeding and shuddering looks upon a dismembered limb.\r\n\r\nThe sweat broke from Hugh\'s forehead. The waiting and daily parting had\r\nseemed unbearable, that short waiting of a few weeks. Now she would\r\nnever be his. That long, ever-growing hunger of the heart would never be\r\nappeased. She had taken herself away, taking away with her her dear\r\nhands and her faithful eyes and the low voice, the very sound of which\r\nbrought comfort and peace. They were his hands and eyes. She had given\r\nthem to him. And now she had wrenched them away again, those faithful\r\neyes had seared him with their scorn, those white hands, against which\r\nhe had leaned his forehead, had thrust him violently from her. He could\r\nnot live without her. This was death, to be parted from her.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, Rachel, I can\'t," said Hugh, over and over again. What was any\r\nlesser death, compared to this, compared to her contempt?\r\n\r\nShe would never come back. She despised him. She would never love him\r\nany more. He had told her that it must be a dream that she could love\r\nhim, and that he should wake. And she had said it was all quite true.\r\nHow sweetly she had said it. But it was a dream, after all, and he _had_\r\nwaked--in torment. Life as long as he lived would be like this moment.\r\n\r\n"I will not bear it," he said, suddenly, with the frantic instinct of\r\nescape which makes a man climb out of a burning house over a\r\nwindow-ledge. Far down is the pavement, quiet, impassive, deadly. But\r\nbehind is the blast of the furnace. Panic staggers between the two,\r\nand--jumps.\r\n\r\n"I will not bear it," said Hugh, tears of anguish welling up into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe had not only lost her, but he had lost himself. That better, humble,\r\nearnest self had gone away with Rachel, and he was thrust back on the\r\nold false cowardly self whom, since she had loved him, he had abhorred.\r\nHe had disowned it. He had cast it off. Now it enveloped him again like\r\na shirt of fire, and a voice within him said, "This is the real you. You\r\ndeceived yourself for a moment. But this is the real you--the liar, the\r\ncoward, the traitor, who will live with you again forever."\r\n\r\n"I am forsaken," said Hugh. He repeated the words over and over again.\r\n"Forsaken! Forsaken!" And he looked round for a way of escape.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the back of his mind a picture hung which he had seen once\r\nand never looked at again. He turned and looked at it now, as a man\r\nturns and looks at a picture on the wall behind him.\r\n\r\nHe saw it again, the still upturned face of the little lake among its\r\nencircling trees, as he had seen it that day when he and Doll came\r\nsuddenly upon it in the woods. What had it to do with him? He had\r\nescaped from it once. _He understood now_.\r\n\r\nWho, that has once seen it, has ever forgotten it, the look that deep\r\nwater takes when life is unbearable! "Come down to me among my tall\r\nwater-plants," it says. "I am a refuge, a way of escape. This horror and\r\nnightmare of life cannot reach you in my bosom. Come down to me. I\r\npromise nothing but to lay my cool hand upon the fire in your brain, and\r\nthat the world shall release its clutch upon you, the world which\r\npromises, and will not keep its promises. I will keep mine."\r\n\r\nHugh\'s mind wavered, as the flame of a candle wavers in a sudden\r\ndraught. So had it wavered once in the fear of death, and he had yielded\r\nto that fear. So it wavered now in a greater fear, the fear of life, and\r\nhe yielded to that fear.\r\n\r\nHe caught up his hat and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was dark, and he hit against the people in the feebly lighted streets\r\nas he hurried past. How hot it was! How absurd to see those gathered\r\nheaps of snow, and the muffled figures of men and women.\r\n\r\nPresently he had left the town, and was in the open country. Where was\r\nhe going along this interminable road in this dim snow light?\r\n\r\nThe night was very still. The spirit of the frost stooped over the white\r\nface of the earth. The long homely lines of meadow and wold and hedgerow\r\nshowed like the austere folds of a shroud.\r\n\r\nHugh walked swiftly, looking neither to right nor left. The fire in his\r\nbrain mounted, mounted. The moon, entangled in a dim thicket, got up\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nAt last he stopped short. That farm on the right! He had seen it before.\r\nYes. That was Greenfields. Doll had pointed it out to him when they had\r\nwalked on that Sunday afternoon to Beaumere. They had left the road\r\nhere, and had taken to the fields. There was the gate. Hugh opened it.\r\nCrack had been lost here and had rejoined them in the wood. The field\r\nwas empty. A path like a crease ran across it.\r\n\r\nHe knew the way. It was the only way of escape from this shadow in front\r\nof him, this other self who had come back to him, and torn Rachel from\r\nhim, and made her hate him. She loved him really. She was faithful. She\r\nwould never have forsaken him. But she had mistaken this evil creeping\r\nshadow for him, and he had not been able to explain. But she would\r\nunderstand presently. He would make it all very clear and plain, and she\r\nwould love him again, when he had got rid of this other Hugh. He would\r\ntake him down and drown him in Beaumere. It was the only way to get rid\r\nof him. And he, the real Hugh, would get safely through. He had done it\r\nonce, and he knew. He should stifle and struggle for a little while.\r\nThere was a turn exceeding sharp to be passed, but he should reach that\r\nplace of peace beyond, as he had done before, and find Rachel waiting\r\nfor him, her arms round him again.\r\n\r\n"It is the only way," he said, over and over again, "the only way."\r\n\r\nHe reached the wood. The moon was up now, and smote white and sharp down\r\nthe long winding aisle of the cathedral, which God builds Him in every\r\nforest glade, where the hoar-frost and the snow held now their solemn\r\nservice of praise.\r\n\r\nHugh saw the little light of the keeper\'s cottage, and instinctively\r\nedged his way to the left. He was pressed for time. A wheel was turning\r\nin his head, so quickly, so quickly in this great heat that, unless he\r\nwere quicker than it, it would out-distance him altogether.\r\n\r\nAt last he saw the water, and ran down swiftly towards it. The white\r\ntree-trunks were in league against him, and waylaid him, striking him\r\nviolently. But he struck back, and got through them. They fell behind at\r\nlast. His shadow was beside him now, short and nimble. He looked round\r\nonce or twice to make sure it was still with him.\r\n\r\nHe reached the water\'s edge and then stopped short, aghast. Where was\r\nthe water gone? It had deceived him and deserted him, like everything\r\nelse. It was all hard as iron, one great white sheet of ice stretching\r\naway in front of him. He had thought of the little lake as he had last\r\nseen it, cool and deep, and with the shadows of the summer trees in it.\r\nIt was all changed and gone. There was no help here. The way of escape\r\nwas closed. With a hoarse cry he set off, running across the ice in the\r\ndirection of the place where he had been nearly drowned before.\r\n\r\nIt was here, opposite that clump of silver birch. The ice was a\r\ndifferent color here. It tilted and creaked suddenly beneath his feet.\r\nHe flung himself down upon it and struck it wildly with his fist. "Let\r\nme through," he stammered. But the ice resisted him. It made an ominous\r\ndry crackling, as if in mockery. It barely resisted him, but it did\r\nresist him. And he had no time, no time. He scrambled to his feet again,\r\nand it gave way instantly. The other self pounced suddenly upon him and\r\ncame through with him, and they struggled furiously together in deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"I must, I must," gasped Hugh, between his clinched teeth.\r\n\r\n"You shall not," said the other self, mad with terror. "Hold on to the\r\nice."\r\n\r\nHugh saw his bleeding hands holding tightly to the jagged edge. It\r\nbroke. He clutched another piece. It broke again. The current was\r\nsucking him slowly under the ice. The broken pieces pushed him. One arm\r\nwas under already, and he could not get it out. The animal horror of a\r\ntrap seized him. He had not known it would be like this. He was not\r\nprepared for this.\r\n\r\nThe other self fought furiously for life, clutching and tearing at the\r\nbreaking ice.\r\n\r\n"Call," it said to him, "while there is still time."\r\n\r\nHugh set his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe ice broke in a great piece and tilted heavily against him. It was\r\nover one shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Call," said the other self, sharply, again, "or you will be under the\r\nice."\r\n\r\nAnd up to the quiet heaven rose once and again a hoarse, wild cry of\r\nhuman agony and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n     Ueber allen Gipfeln\r\n                 Ist Ruh;\r\n     In allen Wipfeln\r\n                 Sp\xfcrest Du\r\n     Kaum einen Hauch;\r\n     Die V\xf6gelein schweigen im Walde.\r\n     Warte nur, balde\r\n     Ruhest Du auch.\r\n                   --GOETHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor was very late. Rachel, who was going to the Watch Service,\r\nwaited for the Bishop in the hall till he came out of his study with the\r\ncurate, who had doubts.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man had left, Rachel said, hesitating:\r\n\r\n"I shall not go to the service if Dr. Brown does not arrive before then.\r\nHugh was to have come with us. I don\'t want him to go all through the\r\nnight thinking--perhaps if I am prevented going you will see him, and\r\nspeak a word to him."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the Bishop, "I went across to his rooms two hours ago,\r\ndirectly you went up to Hester."\r\n\r\nHe loved Rachel, but he wondered at her lack of imagination.\r\n\r\n"Two hours ago! And what did you say to him?"\r\n\r\n"I did not see him. I was too late. He was gone."\r\n\r\n"Gone!" said Rachel, faintly. "Where?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I went up to his rooms. All his things were still\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Where is he now?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know."\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked at her compassionately. She had been a long time\r\nforgiving him. While she hesitated he had said to her, "Where is he\r\nnow?" and she had not understood.\r\n\r\nHer face became pinched and livid. She understood now, after the event.\r\n\r\n"I am frightened for him," she said.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had been alarmed while she poured out his tea before they\r\nbegan to talk.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he has gone back to London," she said, her eyes widening with a\r\nvague dread.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had gone on to the station, and had ascertained that Hugh had\r\nnot left by the one train which had stopped at Southminster between\r\nseven and nine. But he did not add to her anxiety by saying so.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s brougham, coming at full speed, drew up suddenly at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"There he is at last," said the Bishop, and before the bell could be\r\nrung he opened the door.\r\n\r\nA figure was already on the threshold, but it was not Dr. Brown. It was\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n"Where is Dr. Brown?" said Rachel and the Bishop simultaneously, looking\r\nat the doctor\'s well-known brougham and smoking horses.\r\n\r\n"He asked me to come," said Dick, measuring Rachel with his eye. Then he\r\ndid as he would be done by, and added, slowly: "He was kept. He was on\r\nhis way here from Wilderleigh, where one of the servants is ill, and as\r\nI was dining there he offered me a lift back. And when we were passing\r\nthat farm near the wood a man stopped us. He said there had been an\r\naccident--some one nearly drowned. I went, too. It turned out to be\r\nScarlett. Dr. Brown remained with him, and sent me to take you to him."\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" asked Rachel, her eyes never leaving Dick\'s face.\r\n\r\n"No, but he is very ill."\r\n\r\n"I will come now."\r\n\r\nThe chaplain came slowly across the hall, laden with books and papers.\r\n\r\n"Let Canon Sebright know at once that I cannot take part in the\r\nservice," said the Bishop, sharply; and he hurried down the steps after\r\nRachel, and got into the carriage with her. Dick turned up the collar of\r\nhis fur coat, and climbed up beside the coachman.\r\n\r\nThe carriage turned warily, and then set off at a great pace.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral loomed up suddenly, all aglow with light within. Out into\r\nthe night came the dirge of the organ for the dying year.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop kept his eyes fixed on the pane. The houses were left behind.\r\nThey were in the country.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" said Rachel, suddenly, as a long shadow ran beside them\r\nalong the white hedgerow.\r\n\r\n"It is only Dick. There is a rise in the ground here, and he is running\r\nto ease the horses."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"I believe he did it on purpose," said Rachel, at last. "I forsook him\r\nin his great need, and now he has forsaken me."\r\n\r\n"He would never forsake you, Rachel."\r\n\r\n"Not knowingly," she said. "I did it knowing. That is the difference\r\nbetween him and me."\r\n\r\nShe did not speak again.\r\n\r\nFor a lifetime, as it seemed to the Bishop, the carriage swayed from\r\nside to side of the white road. At last, when he had given up all hope,\r\nit turned into a field and jolted heavily over the frozen ruts. Then it\r\ncame to a stand-still.\r\n\r\nRachel was out of the carriage before Dick could get off the box.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without speaking, and he led the way swiftly through\r\nthe silent wood under the moon. The Bishop followed.\r\n\r\nThe keeper\'s cottage had a dim yellow glimmer in it. Man\'s little light\r\nlooked like a kind of darkness in the great white, all-pervading\r\nsplendor of the night. The cottage door was open. Dr. Brown was looking\r\nout.\r\n\r\nRachel went up to him.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" she said.\r\n\r\nHe tried to speak; he tried to hold her gently back while he explained\r\nsomething. But he saw she was past explanation, blind and deaf except\r\nfor one voice, one face.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" she repeated, shaking her head impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Here," said the doctor, and he led her through the kitchen. A man and\r\nwoman rose up from the fireside as she came in. He opened the door into\r\nthe little parlor.\r\n\r\nOn the floor on a mattress lay a tall figure. The head, supported on a\r\npillow, was turned towards the door, the wide eyes were fixed on the\r\ncandle on the table. The lips moved continually. The hands were picking\r\nat the blankets.\r\n\r\nFor the first moment Rachel did not know him. How could this be Hugh?\r\nHow could these blank, unrecognizing eyes be Hugh\'s eyes, which had\r\nnever until now met hers without love?\r\n\r\nBut it was he. Yes, it was he. She traced the likeness as we do in a\r\nman\'s son to the man himself.\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees beside him and took the wandering hands and kissed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, through her, with those bright, unseeing eyes, and the\r\nburning hands escaped from hers back to their weary work.\r\n\r\nDick, whose eyes had followed Rachel, turned away biting his lip, and\r\nsat down in a corner of the kitchen. The keeper and his wife had slipped\r\naway into the little scullery.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop went up to Dick and put his arm round his shoulders. Two\r\ntears of pain were standing in Dick\'s hawk-eyes. He had seen Rachel kiss\r\nHugh\'s hands. He ground his heel against the brick floor.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop understood, and understood, too, the sudden revulsion of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n"Poor chap!" said Dick, huskily. "It\'s frightful hard luck on him to\r\nhave to go just when she was to have married him. If it had been me I\r\ncould not have borne it; but then I would have taken care I was not\r\ndrowned. I\'d have seen to that. But it\'s frightful hard luck on him, all\r\nthe same."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he was taking a short cut across the ice."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dick, "and he got in where any one who knew the look of ice\r\nwould have known he would be sure to get in. The keeper watched him\r\ncross the ice. It was some time before they could get near him to get\r\nhim out, and it seems there is some injury."\r\n\r\nDr. Brown came slowly out, half closing the parlor door behind him.\r\n\r\n"I can do nothing more," he said. "If he lived he would have brain\r\nfever. But he is dying."\r\n\r\n"Does he know her?"\r\n\r\n"No. He may know her at the last, but it is doubtful. I can do nothing,\r\nand I am wanted elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"I will stop," said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"Shall I take you back?" said Dr. Brown, looking at Dick. But Dick shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"I might be of use to her," he said, when the doctor had gone.\r\n\r\nSo the two men who loved Rachel sat in impotent compassion in the little\r\nkitchen through the interminable hours of the night. At long intervals\r\nthe Bishop went quietly into the parlor, but apparently he was not\r\nwanted there. Once he went out and got a fresh candle, and put it into\r\nthe tin candlestick, and set it among the china ornaments on wool-work\r\nmats.\r\n\r\nHugh lay quite still now with his eyes half closed. His hands lay\r\npassive in Rachel\'s. The restless fever of movement was passed. She\r\nalmost wished it back, so far, so far was his life ebbing away from\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n"Hughie," she whispered to him over and over again. "I love you. Do not\r\nleave me."\r\n\r\nBut he muttered continually to himself and took no heed of her.\r\n\r\nAt last she gave up the hopeless task of making him hear, and listened\r\nintently. She could make no sense of what he said. The few words she\r\ncould catch were repeated a hundred times amid an unintelligible murmur.\r\nThe boat, and Loftus, and her own name--and Crack. Who was Crack? She\r\nremembered the little dog which had been drowned. And the lips which\r\nwere so soon to be silent talked on incoherently while Rachel\'s heart\r\nbroke for a word.\r\n\r\nThe night was wearing very thin. The darkness before the dawn, the\r\ndeathly chill before the dawn were here. Through the low uncurtained\r\nwindow Rachel could see the first wan light of the new day and the new\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would know her with the daylight.\r\n\r\nThe new day came up out of the white east in a great peace, pale as\r\nChrist newly risen from the dead, with the splendor of God\'s love upon\r\nHim.\r\n\r\nA great peace and light stole together into the little room.\r\n\r\nHugh stirred, and Rachel saw a change pass over his pinched, sunken\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"It was the only way to reach her," he said, slowly and distinctly; "the\r\nonly way. I shall get through, and I shall find her upon the other side,\r\nas I did before. It is very cold, but I shall get through. I am nearly\r\nthrough now."\r\n\r\nHe sat up, and looked directly at her. He seemed suddenly freed,\r\nreleased. A boyish look that she had never seen came into his face, a\r\nlook which remained in Rachel\'s heart while she lived.\r\n\r\nWould he know her?\r\n\r\nThe pure light was upon his face, more beautiful than she had ever seen\r\nit. He looked at her with tender love and trust shining in his eyes, and\r\nlaughed softly.\r\n\r\n"I have found you," he said, stretching out his arms towards her. "I\r\nlost you, I don\'t remember how, but I came to you through the water. I\r\nknew I should find you, my Rachel, my sweet wife."\r\n\r\nHe was past the place of our poor human forgiveness. He might have\r\ncared for it earlier, but he did not want it now. He had forgotten that\r\nhe had any need of it, for the former things had passed away. Love only\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nShe took him in her arms. She held him to her heart.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would," he said, smiling at her. "I knew it. We will never\r\npart again."\r\n\r\nAnd with a sigh of perfect happiness he turned wholly to her, his closed\r\neyes against her breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was autumn once more. The brambles were red in the hollow below\r\nWarpington Vicarage. Abel was gathering the apples in the orchard.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gresley were sitting together in the shade of the new\r\nporch, contemplating a triumphal arch which they had just erected across\r\nthe road. "Long life and happiness" was the original motto inscribed\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gresley, in an alarming new hat, sank back exhausted in her\r\ngarden-chair.\r\n\r\n"The Pratts are having six arches, all done with electric-light designs\r\nof hearts with their crest on the top," she said. "They are to be lit up\r\nat nine o\'clock. Mr. Pratt said he did not mind any expense on such an\r\noccasion. He said it made an epoch in the life of the county."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Gresley, "I lead too busy a life to be always poking my\r\nnose into other people\'s affairs, but I certainly never did expect that\r\nLady Newhaven would have married Algy Pratt."\r\n\r\n"Ada and Selina say Algy and she have been attached for years: that is\r\nwhy the wedding is so soon--only nine months--and she is to keep her\r\ntitle, and they are going to live at Westhope. I told Ada and Selina I\r\nhoped they did not expect too much from the marriage, for sometimes\r\npeople who did were disappointed, but they only laughed and said Vi had\r\npromised Algy to take them out next season."\r\n\r\n"We seem to live in an atmosphere of weddings," said Mr. Gresley.\r\n"First, Dr. Brown and Fr\xe4ulein, and now Algy Pratt and Lady Newhaven."\r\n\r\n"I was so dreadfully afraid that Fr\xe4ulein might think our arch was put\r\nup for her, and presume upon it," said Mrs. Gresley, "that I thought it\r\nbetter to send her a little note, just to welcome her cordially, and\r\ntell her how busy we were about the Pratt festivities, and what a\r\n_coincidence_ it was her arriving on the same day. I told her I would\r\nsend down the children to spend the morning with her to-morrow. I knew\r\nthat would please her, and it is Miss Baker\'s day in Southminster with\r\nher aunt, and I shall really be too busy to see after them. In some ways\r\nI don\'t like Miss Baker as much as Fr\xe4ulein. She is paid just the same,\r\nbut she does much less, and she is really quite short sometimes if I ask\r\nher to do any little thing for me, like copying out that church music."\r\n\r\n"Hester used to do it," said Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"Miss Brown told me she had heard from Hester, and that she and Miss\r\nWest are still in India. And they mean to go to Australia and New\r\nZealand, and come home next spring."\r\n\r\n"Was Hester well?"\r\n\r\n"Quite well. You know, James, I always told you that hers was not a\r\ngenuine illness. That was why they would not let us see her. It was only\r\nhysteria, which girls get when they are disappointed at not marrying,\r\nand are not so young as they were. Directly poor Mr. Scarlett died,\r\nHester left her room, and devoted herself to Miss West, and Dr. Brown\r\nsaid it was the saving of her. But for my part I always thought Hester\r\ntook in Dr. Brown and the Bishop about that illness."\r\n\r\n"I should not wonder if Hester married Dick Vernon," said Mr. Gresley.\r\n"It is rather marked, their going to Australia when he went back there\r\nonly a few months ago. If she had consulted me I should have advised her\r\nnot to follow him up."\r\n\r\nA burst of cheering, echoed by piercing howls from Boulou locked up in\r\nthe empty nursery.\r\n\r\n"I hope Miss Baker has put the children in a good place. She is sure to\r\nbe in a good one herself," said Mrs. Gresley, as she and her husband\r\ntook up their position by the gate.\r\n\r\nMore cheering! A sudden flourish of trumpets and a trombone from the\r\nvolunteer band at the corner, of which Mr. Pratt was colonel.\r\n\r\nA clatter of four white horses and an open carriage. A fleeting vision\r\nof Captain Pratt, white waistcoat, smile, teeth, eye-glass, hat waved in\r\nlavender-kid hand! A fleeting vision of a lovely woman in white, with a\r\nwonderful white-feathered hat, and a large diamond heart, possibly a\r\nlove token from Captain Pratt, hanging on a long diamond chain, bowing\r\nand smiling beside her elaborate bridegroom.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they were passed, and a report of cannon and field-artillery\r\nshowed that the east lodge of Warpington Towers had been reached, and\r\nthe solemn joy of the Pratts was finding adequate expression.\r\n\r\n"She looked rather frightened," said Mrs. Gresley.\r\n\r\n"Such a magnificent reception is alarming to a gentle, retiring nature,"\r\nsaid Mr. Gresley.\r\n\r\nMore cheering! this time much more enthusiastic than the last--louder,\r\ndeafening.\r\n\r\nDr. Brown\'s dog-cart came slowly in sight, accompanied by a crowd.\r\n\r\n"They have taken out the horse and are dragging them up," said Mrs.\r\nGresley, in astonishment. "Look at Dr. Brown waving his hat, and\r\nFr\xe4ulein bowing in that silly way. Well, I only hope her head won\'t be\r\nturned by the arches and everything. She will find my note directly she\r\ngets in. Really, James! two brides and bridegrooms in one day! It is\r\nlike the end of a novel."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe turn the pages of the Book of Life with impatient hands. And if we\r\nshut up the book at a sad page we say, hastily, "Life is sad." But it is\r\nnot so. There are other pages waiting to be turned. I, who have copied\r\nout one little chapter of the lives of Rachel and Hester, cannot see\r\nplainly, but I catch glimpses of those other pages. I seem to see Rachel\r\nwith children round her, and Dick not far off, and the old light\r\nrekindled in Hester\'s eyes. For Hope and Love and Enthusiasm never die.\r\nWe think in youth that we bury them in the graveyards of our hearts, but\r\nthe grass never yet grew over them. How, then, can life be sad, when\r\nthey walk beside us always in the growing light towards the Perfect Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red Pottage, by Mary Cholmondeley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RED POTTAGE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14885-8.txt or 14885-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/8/8/14885/\r\n\r\nProduced by Rick Niles, Charlie Kirschner and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
