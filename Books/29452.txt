She had looked at the sallow prints on the walls and\r\nat the lonely magazine, a year old, that combined, with a small lamp in\r\ncoloured glass and a knitted white centre-piece wanting in freshness,\r\nto enhance the effect of the purplish cloth on the principal table; she\r\nhad above all, from time to time, taken a brief stand on the small\r\nbalcony to which the pair of long windows gave access. The vulgar\r\nlittle street, in this view, offered scant relief from the vulgar\r\nlittle room; its main office was to suggest to her that the narrow\r\nblack house-fronts, adjusted to a standard that would have been low\r\neven for backs, constituted quite the publicity implied by such\r\nprivacies. One felt them in the room exactly as one felt the room--the\r\nhundred like it or worse--in the street. Each time she turned in again,\r\neach time, in her impatience, she gave him up, it was to sound to a\r\ndeeper depth, while she tasted the faint, flat emanation of things, the\r\nfailure of fortune and of honour. If she continued to wait it was\r\nreally, in a manner, that she might not add the shame of fear, of\r\nindividual, personal collapse, to all the other shames. To feel the\r\nstreet, to feel the room, to feel the table-cloth and the centre-piece\r\nand the lamp, gave her a small, salutary sense, at least, of neither\r\nshirking nor lying. This whole vision was the worst thing yet--as\r\nincluding, in particular, the interview for which she had prepared\r\nherself; and for what had she come but for the worst? She tried to be\r\nsad, so as not to be angry; but it made her angry that she couldn\'t be\r\nsad. And yet where was misery, misery too beaten for blame and\r\nchalk-marked by fate like a "lot" at a common auction, if not in these\r\nmerciless signs of mere mean, stale feelings?\r\n\r\nHer father\'s life, her sister\'s, her own, that of her two lost\r\nbrothers--the whole history of their house had the effect of some fine\r\nflorid, voluminous phrase, say even a musical, that dropped first into\r\nwords, into notes, without sense, and then, hanging unfinished, into no\r\nwords, no notes at all. Why should a set of people have been put in\r\nmotion, on such a scale and with such an air of being equipped for a\r\nprofitable journey, only to break down without an accident, to stretch\r\nthemselves in the wayside dust without a reason? The answer to these\r\nquestions was not in Chirk Street, but the questions themselves\r\nbristled there, and the girl\'s repeated pause before the mirror and the\r\nchimney-place might have represented her nearest approach to an escape\r\nfrom them. Was it not in fact the partial escape from this "worst" in\r\nwhich she was steeped to be able to make herself out again as agreeable\r\nto see? She stared into the tarnished glass too hard indeed to be\r\nstaring at her beauty alone. She readjusted the poise of her black,\r\nclosely-feathered hat; retouched, beneath it, the thick fall of her\r\ndusky hair; kept her eyes, aslant, no less on her beautiful averted\r\nthan on her beautiful presented oval. She was dressed altogether in\r\nblack, which gave an even tone, by contrast, to her clear face and made\r\nher hair more harmoniously dark. Outside, on the balcony, her eyes\r\nshowed as blue; within, at the mirror, they showed almost as black. She\r\nwas handsome, but the degree of it was not sustained by items and aids;\r\na circumstance moreover playing its part at almost any time in the\r\nimpression she produced. The impression was one that remained, but as\r\nregards the sources of it no sum in addition would have made up the\r\ntotal. She had stature without height, grace without motion, presence\r\nwithout mass. Slender and simple, frequently soundless, she was somehow\r\nalways in the line of the eye--she counted singularly for its pleasure.\r\nMore "dressed," often, with fewer accessories, than other women, or\r\nless dressed, should occasion require, with more, she probably could\r\nnot have given the key to these felicities. They were mysteries of\r\nwhich her friends were conscious--those friends whose general\r\nexplanation was to say that she was clever, whether or no it were taken\r\nby the world as the cause or as the effect of her charm. If she saw\r\nmore things than her fine face in the dull glass of her father\'s\r\nlodgings, she might have seen that, after all, she was not herself a\r\nfact in the collapse. She didn\'t judge herself cheap, she didn\'t make\r\nfor misery. Personally, at least, she was not chalk-marked for the\r\nauction. She hadn\'t given up yet, and the broken sentence, if she was\r\nthe last word, would end with a sort of meaning. There was a minute\r\nduring which, though her eyes were fixed, she quite visibly lost\r\nherself in the thought of the way she might still pull things round had\r\nshe only been a man. It was the name, above all, she would take in\r\nhand--the precious name she so liked and that, in spite of the harm her\r\nwretched father had done it, was not yet past praying for. She loved it\r\nin fact the more tenderly for that bleeding wound. But what could a\r\npenniless girl do with it but let it go?\r\n\r\nWhen her father at last appeared she became, as usual, instantly aware\r\nof the futility of any effort to hold him to anything. He had written\r\nher that he was ill, too ill to leave his room, and that he must see\r\nher without delay; and if this had been, as was probable, the sketch of\r\na design, he was indifferent even to the moderate finish required for\r\ndeception. He had clearly wanted, for perversities that he called\r\nreasons, to see her, just as she herself had sharpened for a talk; but\r\nshe now again felt, in the inevitability of the freedom he used with\r\nher, all the old ache, her poor mother\'s very own, that he couldn\'t\r\ntouch you ever so lightly without setting up. No relation with him\r\ncould be so short or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt;\r\nand this, in the strangest way in the world, not because he desired it\r\nto be--feeling often, as he surely must, the profit for him of its not\r\nbeing--but because there was never a mistake for you that he could\r\nleave unmade or a conviction of his impossibility in you that he could\r\napproach you without strengthening. He might have awaited her on the\r\nsofa in his sitting-room, or might have stayed in bed and received her\r\nin that situation. She was glad to be spared the sight of such\r\n_penetralia,_ but it would have reminded her a little less that there\r\nwas no truth in him. This was the weariness of every fresh meeting; he\r\ndealt out lies as he might the cards from the greasy old pack for the\r\ngame of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with him. The\r\ninconvenience--as always happens in such cases--was not that you minded\r\nwhat was false, but that you missed what was true. He might be ill, and\r\nit might suit you to know it, but no contact with him, for this, could\r\never be straight enough. Just so he even might die, but Kate fairly\r\nwondered on what evidence of his own she would some day have to believe\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe had not at present come down from his room, which she knew to be\r\nabove the one they were in: he had already been out of the house,\r\nthough he would either, should she challenge him, deny it or present it\r\nas a proof of his extremity. She had, however, by this time, quite\r\nceased to challenge him; not only, face to face with him, vain\r\nirritation dropped, but he breathed upon the tragic consciousness in\r\nsuch a way that after a moment nothing of it was left. The difficulty\r\nwas not less that he breathed in the same way upon the comic: she\r\nalmost believed that with this latter she might still have found a\r\nfoothold for clinging to him. He had ceased to be amusing--he was\r\nreally too inhuman. His perfect look, which had floated him so long,\r\nwas practically perfect still; but one had long since for every\r\noccasion taken it for granted. Nothing could have better shown than the\r\nactual how right one had been. He looked exactly as much as usual--all\r\npink and silver as to skin and hair, all straitness and starch as to\r\nfigure and dress--the man in the world least connected with anything\r\nunpleasant. He was so particularly the English gentleman and the\r\nfortunate, settled, normal person. Seen at a foreign _table d\'h\xf4te,_\r\nhe suggested but one thing: "In what perfection England produces them!"\r\nHe had kind, safe eyes, and a voice which, for all its clean fulness,\r\ntold, in a manner, the happy history of its having never had once to\r\nraise itself. Life had met him so, half-way, and had turned round so to\r\nwalk with him, placing a hand in his arm and fondly leaving him to\r\nchoose the pace. Those who knew him a little said, "How he does\r\ndress!"--those who knew him better said, "How _does_ he?" The one stray\r\ngleam of comedy just now in his daughter\'s eyes was the funny feeling\r\nhe momentarily made her have of being herself "looked up" by him in\r\nsordid lodgings. For a minute after he came in it was as if the place\r\nwere her own and he the visitor with susceptibilities. He gave you\r\nfunny feelings, he had indescribable arts, that quite turned the\r\ntables: that had been always how he came to see her mother so long as\r\nher mother would see him. He came from places they had often not known\r\nabout, but he patronised Lexham Gardens. Kate\'s only actual expression\r\nof impatience, however, was "I\'m glad you\'re so much better!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so much better, my dear--I\'m exceedingly unwell; the proof of\r\nwhich is, precisely, that I\'ve been out to the chemist\'s--that beastly\r\nfellow at the corner." So Mr. Croy showed he could qualify the humble\r\nhand that assuaged him. "I\'m taking something he has made up for me.\r\nIt\'s just why I\'ve sent for you--that you may see me as I really am."\r\n\r\n"Oh papa, it\'s long since I\'ve ceased to see you otherwise than as you\r\nreally are! I think we\'ve all arrived by this time at the right word\r\nfor that: \'You\'re beautiful--_n\'en parlons plus.\'_ You\'re as beautiful\r\nas ever--you look lovely." He judged meanwhile her own appearance, as\r\nshe knew she could always trust him to do; recognising, estimating,\r\nsometimes disapproving, what she wore, showing her the interest he\r\ncontinued to take in her. He might really take none at all, yet she\r\nvirtually knew herself the creature in the world to whom he was least\r\nindifferent. She had often enough wondered what on earth, at the pass\r\nhe had reached, could give him pleasure, and she had come back, on\r\nthese occasions, to that. It gave him pleasure that she was handsome,\r\nthat she was, in her way, a sensible value. It was at least as marked,\r\nnevertheless, that he derived none from similar conditions, so far as\r\nthey _were_ similar, in his other child. Poor Marian might be handsome,\r\nbut he certainly didn\'t care. The hitch here, of course, was that, with\r\nwhatever beauty, her sister, widowed and almost in want, with four\r\nbouncing children, was not a sensible value. She asked him, the next\r\nthing, how long he had been in his actual quarters, though aware of how\r\nlittle it mattered, how little any answer he might make would probably\r\nhave in common with the truth. She failed in fact to notice his answer,\r\ntruthful or not, already occupied as she was with what she had on her\r\nown side to say to him. This was really what had made her wait--what\r\nsuperseded the small remainder of her resentment at his constant\r\npractical impertinence; the result of all of which was that, within a\r\nminute, she had brought it out. "Yes--even now I\'m willing to go with\r\nyou. I don\'t know what you may have wished to say to me, and even if\r\nyou hadn\'t written you would within a day or two have heard from me.\r\nThings have happened, and I\'ve only waited, for seeing you, till I\r\nshould be quite sure. I _am_ quite sure. I\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\nIt produced an effect. "Go with me where?"\r\n\r\n"Anywhere. I\'ll stay with you. Even here." She had taken off her gloves\r\nand, as if she had arrived with her plan, she sat down.\r\n\r\nLionel Croy hung about in his disengaged way--hovered there as if, in\r\nconsequence of her words, looking for a pretext to back out easily: on\r\nwhich she immediately saw she had discounted, as it might be called,\r\nwhat he had himself been preparing. He wished her not to come to him,\r\nstill less to settle with him, and had sent for her to give her up with\r\nsome style and state; a part of the beauty of which, however, was to\r\nhave been his sacrifice to her own detachment. There was no style, no\r\nstate, unless she wished to forsake him. His idea had accordingly been\r\nto surrender her to her wish with all nobleness; it had by no means\r\nbeen to have positively to keep her off. She cared, however, not a\r\nstraw for his embarrassment--feeling how little, on her own part, she\r\nwas moved by charity. She had seen him, first and last, in so many\r\nattitudes that she could now deprive him quite without compunction of\r\nthe luxury of a new one. Yet she felt the disconcerted gasp in his tone\r\nas he said: "Oh my child, I can never consent to that!"\r\n\r\n"What then are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m turning it over," said Lionel Croy. "You may imagine if I\'m not\r\nthinking."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you thought then," his daughter asked, "of what I speak of? I\r\nmean of my being ready."\r\n\r\nStanding before her with his hands behind him and his legs a little\r\napart, he swayed slightly to and fro, inclined toward her as if rising\r\non his toes. It had an effect of conscientious deliberation. "No. I\r\nhaven\'t. I couldn\'t. I wouldn\'t." It was so respectable, a show that\r\nshe felt afresh, and with the memory of their old despair, the despair\r\nat home, how little his appearance ever by any chance told about him.\r\nHis plausibility had been the heaviest of her mother\'s crosses;\r\ninevitably so much more present to the world than whatever it was that\r\nwas horrid--thank God they didn\'t really know!--that he had done. He\r\nhad positively been, in his way, by the force of his particular type, a\r\nterrible husband not to live with; his type reflecting so invidiously\r\non the woman who had found him distasteful. Had this thereby not kept\r\ndirectly present to Kate herself that it might, on some sides, prove no\r\nlight thing for her to leave uncompanioned a parent with such a face\r\nand such a manner? Yet if there was much she neither knew nor dreamed\r\nof, it passed between them at this very moment that he was quite\r\nfamiliar with himself as the subject of such quandaries. If he\r\nrecognised his younger daughter\'s happy aspect as a sensible value, he\r\nhad from the first still more exactly appraised his own. The great\r\nwonder was not that in spite of everything his own had helped him; the\r\ngreat wonder was that it hadn\'t helped him more. However, it was, to\r\nits old, eternal, recurrent tune, helping him all the while; her drop\r\ninto patience with him showed how it was helping him at this moment.\r\nShe saw the next instant precisely the line he would take. "Do you\r\nreally ask me to believe you\'ve been making up your mind to that?"\r\n\r\nShe had to consider her own line. "I don\'t think I care, papa, what you\r\nbelieve. I never, for that matter, think of you as believing anything;\r\nhardly more," she permitted herself to add, "than I ever think of you\r\nas yourself believed. I don\'t know you, father, you see."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s your idea that you may make that up?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; not at all. That\'s no part of the question. If I haven\'t\r\nunderstood you by this time, I never shall, and it doesn\'t matter. It\r\nhas seemed to me that you may be lived with, but not that you may be\r\nunderstood. Of course I\'ve not the least idea how you get on."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t get on," Mr. Croy almost gaily replied.\r\n\r\nHis daughter took in the place again, and it might well have seemed odd\r\nthat in so little to meet the eye there should be so much to show. What\r\nshowed was the ugliness--so positive and palpable that it was somehow\r\nsustaining. It was a medium, a setting, and to that extent, after all,\r\na dreadful sign of life; so that it fairly put a point into her answer.\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon. You flourish."\r\n\r\n"Do you throw it up at me again," he pleasantly inquired, "that I\'ve\r\nnot made away with myself?"\r\n\r\nShe treated the question as needing no reply; she sat there for real\r\nthings. "You know how all our anxieties, under mamma\'s will, have come\r\nout. She had still less to leave than she feared. We don\'t know how we\r\nlived. It all makes up about two hundred a year for Marian, and two for\r\nme, but I give up a hundred to Marian."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you weak thing!" her father kindly sighed.\r\n\r\n"For you and me together," she went on, "the other hundred would do\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"And what would do the rest?"\r\n\r\n"Can you yourself do nothing?" He gave her a look; then, slipping his\r\nhands into his pockets and turning away, stood for a little at the\r\nwindow she had left open. She said nothing more--she had placed him\r\nthere with that question, and the silence lasted a minute, broken by\r\nthe call of an appealing costermonger, which came in with the mild\r\nMarch air, with the shabby sunshine, fearfully unbecoming to the room,\r\nand with the small homely hum of Chirk Street. Presently he moved\r\nnearer, but as if her question had quite dropped. "I don\'t see what has\r\nso suddenly wound you up."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you might perhaps guess. Let me at any rate tell\r\nyou. Aunt Maud has made me a proposal. But she has also made me a\r\ncondition. She wants to keep me."\r\n\r\n"And what in the world else _could_ she possibly want?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know--many things. I\'m not so precious a capture," the\r\ngirl a little dryly explained. "No one has ever wanted to keep me\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\nLooking always what was proper, her father looked now still more\r\nsurprised than interested. "You\'ve not had proposals?" He spoke as if\r\nthat were incredible of Lionel Croy\'s daughter; as if indeed such an\r\nadmission scarce consorted, even in filial intimacy, with her high\r\nspirit and general form.\r\n\r\n"Not from rich relations. She\'s extremely kind to me, but it\'s time,\r\nshe says, that we should understand each other."\r\n\r\nMr. Croy fully assented. "Of course it is--high time; and I can quite\r\nimagine what she means by it."\r\n\r\n"Are you very sure?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, perfectly. She means that she\'ll \'do\' for you handsomely if you\'ll\r\nbreak off all relations with me. You speak of her condition. Her\r\ncondition\'s of course that."\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Kate, "it\'s what has wound me up. Here I am."\r\n\r\nHe showed with a gesture how thoroughly he had taken it in; after\r\nwhich, within a few seconds, he had, quite congruously, turned the\r\nsituation about. "Do you really suppose me in a position to justify\r\nyour throwing yourself upon me?"\r\n\r\nShe waited a little, but when she spoke it was clear. "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well then, you\'re a bigger fool than I should have ventured to suppose\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Why so? You live. You flourish. You bloom."\r\n\r\n"Ah, how you\'ve all always hated me!" he murmured with a pensive gaze\r\nagain at the window.\r\n\r\n"No one could be less of a mere cherished memory," she declared as if\r\nshe had not heard him. "You\'re an actual person, if there ever was one.\r\nWe agreed just now that you\'re beautiful. You strike me, you know,\r\nas--in your own way--much more firm on your feet than I am. Don\'t put\r\nit to me therefore as monstrous that the fact that we are, after all,\r\nparent and child should at present in some manner count for us. My idea\r\nhas been that it should have some effect for each of us. I don\'t at\r\nall, as I told you just now," she pursued, "make out your life; but\r\nwhatever it is I hereby offer you to accept it. And, on my side, I\'ll\r\ndo everything I can for you."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Lionel Croy. Then, with the sound of extreme relevance,\r\n"And what _can_ you?" She only, at this, hesitated, and he took up her\r\nsilence. "You can describe yourself--_to_ yourself--as, in a fine\r\nflight, giving up your aunt for me; but what good, I should like to\r\nknow, would your fine flight do me?" As she still said nothing he\r\ndeveloped a little. "We\'re not possessed of so much, at this charming\r\npass, please to remember, as that we can afford not to take hold of any\r\nperch held out to us. I like the way you talk, my dear, about \'giving\r\nup!\' One doesn\'t give up the use of a spoon because one\'s reduced to\r\nliving on broth. And your spoon, that is your aunt, please consider, is\r\npartly mine as well." She rose now, as if in sight of the term of her\r\neffort, in sight of the futility and the weariness of many things, and\r\nmoved back to the poor little glass with which she had communed before.\r\nShe retouched here again the poise of her hat, and this brought to her\r\nfather\'s lips another remark in which impatience, however, had already\r\nbeen replaced by a funny flare of appreciation. "Oh, you\'re all right!\r\nDon\'t muddle yourself up with _me!"_\r\n\r\nHis daughter turned round to him. "The condition Aunt Maud makes is\r\nthat I shall have absolutely nothing to do with you; never see you, nor\r\nspeak, nor write to you, never go near you nor make you a sign, nor\r\nhold any sort of communication with you. What she requires is that you\r\nshall simply cease to exist for me."\r\n\r\nHe had always seemed--it was one of the marks of what they called the\r\n"unspeakable" in him--to walk a little more on his toes, as if for\r\njauntiness, in the presence of offence. Nothing, however, was more\r\nwonderful than what he sometimes would take for offence, unless it\r\nmight be what he sometimes wouldn\'t. He walked at any rate on his toes\r\nnow. "A very proper requirement of your Aunt Maud, my dear--I don\'t\r\nhesitate to say it!" Yet as this, much as she had seen, left her silent\r\nat first from what might have been a sense of sickness, he had time to\r\ngo on: "That\'s her condition then. But what are her promises? Just what\r\ndoes she engage to do? You must work it, you know."\r\n\r\n"You mean make her feel," Kate asked after a moment, "how much I\'m\r\nattached to you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what a cruel, invidious treaty it is for you to sign. I\'m a poor\r\nold dad to make a stand about giving up--I quite agree. But I\'m not,\r\nafter all, quite the old dad not to get something _for_ giving up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think her idea," said Kate almost gaily now, "is that I shall\r\nget a great deal."\r\n\r\nHe met her with his inimitable amenity. "But does she give you the\r\nitems?"\r\n\r\nThe girl went through the show. "More or less, I think. But many of\r\nthem are things I dare say I may take for granted--things women can do\r\nfor each other and that you wouldn\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing I understand so well, always, as the things I needn\'t!\r\nBut what I want to do, you see," he went on, "is to put it to your\r\nconscience that you\'ve an admirable opportunity; and that it\'s moreover\r\none for which, after all, damn you, you\'ve really to thank _me."_\r\n\r\n"I confess I don\'t see," Kate observed, "what my \'conscience\' has to do\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear girl, you ought simply to be ashamed of yourself. Do you\r\nknow what you\'re a proof of, all you hard, hollow people together?" He\r\nput the question with a charming air of sudden spiritual heat. "Of the\r\ndeplorably superficial morality of the age. The family sentiment, in\r\nour vulgarised, brutalised life, has gone utterly to pot. There was a\r\nday when a man like me--by which I mean a parent like me--would have\r\nbeen for a daughter like you a quite distinct value; what\'s called in\r\nthe business world, I believe, an \'asset.\'" He continued sociably to\r\nmake it out. "I\'m not talking only of what you might, with the right\r\nfeeling do _for_ me, but of what you might--it\'s what I call your\r\nopportunity--do _with_ me. Unless indeed," he the next moment\r\nimperturbably threw off, "they come a good deal to the same thing. Your\r\nduty as well as your chance, if you\'re capable of seeing it, is to use\r\nme. Show family feeling by seeing what I\'m good for. If you had it as\r\n_I_ have it you\'d see I\'m still good--well, for a lot of things.\r\nThere\'s in fact, my dear," Mr. Croy wound up, "a coach-and-four to be\r\ngot out of me." His drop, or rather his climax, failed a little of\r\neffect, indeed, through an undue precipitation of memory. Something his\r\ndaughter had said came back to him. "You\'ve settled to give away half\r\nyour little inheritance?"\r\n\r\nHer hesitation broke into laughter. "No--I haven\'t \'settled\' anything."\r\n\r\n"But you mean, practically, to let Marian collar it?" They stood there\r\nface to face, but she so denied herself to his challenge that he could\r\nonly go on. "You\'ve a view of three hundred a year for her in addition\r\nto what her husband left her with? Is _that,"_ the remote progenitor of\r\nsuch wantonness audibly wondered, "your morality?"\r\n\r\nKate found her answer without trouble. "Is it your idea that I should\r\ngive you everything?"\r\n\r\nThe "everything" clearly struck him--to the point even of determining\r\nthe tone of his reply. "Far from it. How can you ask that when I refuse\r\nwhat you tell me you came to offer? Make of my idea what you can; I\r\nthink I\'ve sufficiently expressed it, and it\'s at any rate to take or\r\nto leave. It\'s the only one, I may nevertheless add; it\'s the basket\r\nwith all my eggs. It\'s my conception, in short, of your duty."\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s tired smile watched the word as if it had taken on a small\r\ngrotesque visibility. "You\'re wonderful on such subjects! I think I\r\nshould leave you in no doubt," she pursued, "that if I were to sign my\r\naunt\'s agreement I should carry it out, in honour, to the letter."\r\n\r\n"Rather, my own love! It\'s just your honour that I appeal to. The only\r\nway to play the game _is_ to play it. There\'s no limit to what your\r\naunt can do for you."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean in the way of marrying me?"\r\n\r\n"What else should I mean? Marry properly----"\r\n\r\n"And then?" Kate asked as he hung fire.\r\n\r\n"And then--well, I _will_ talk with you. I\'ll resume relations."\r\n\r\nShe looked about her and picked up her parasol. "Because you\'re not so\r\nafraid of any one else in the world as you are of _her?_ My husband, if\r\nI should marry, would be, at the worst, less of a terror? If that\'s\r\nwhat you mean, there may be something in it. But doesn\'t it depend a\r\nlittle also on what you mean by my getting a proper one? However," Kate\r\nadded as she picked out the frill of her little umbrella, "I don\'t\r\nsuppose your idea of him is _quite_ that he should persuade you to live\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\n"Dear no--not a bit." He spoke as not resenting either the fear or the\r\nhope she imputed; met both imputations, in fact, with a sort of\r\nintellectual relief. "I place the case for you wholly in your aunt\'s\r\nhands. I take her view, with my eyes shut; I accept in all confidence\r\nany man she selects. If he\'s good enough for _her_--elephantine snob as\r\nshe is--he\'s good enough for me; and quite in spite of the fact that\r\nshe\'ll be sure to select one who can be trusted to be nasty to me. My\r\nonly interest is in your doing what she wants. You shan\'t be so beastly\r\npoor, my darling," Mr. Croy declared, "if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"Well then, good-bye, papa," the girl said after a reflection on this\r\nthat had perceptibly ended for her in a renunciation of further debate.\r\n"Of course you understand that it may be for long."\r\n\r\nHer companion, hereupon, had one of his finest inspirations. "Why not,\r\nfrankly, for ever? You must do me the justice to see that I don\'t do\r\nthings, that I\'ve never done them, by halves--that if I offer you to\r\nefface myself, it\'s for the final, fatal sponge that I ask, well\r\nsaturated and well applied."\r\n\r\nShe turned her handsome, quiet face upon him at such length that it\r\nmight well have been for the last time. "I don\'t know what you\'re like."\r\n\r\n"No more do I, my dear. I\'ve spent my life in trying, in vain, to\r\ndiscover. Like nothing--more\'s the pity. If there had been many of us,\r\nand we could have found each other out, there\'s no knowing what we\r\nmightn\'t have done. But it doesn\'t matter now. Good-bye, love." He\r\nlooked even not sure of what she would wish him to suppose on the\r\nsubject of a kiss, yet also not embarrassed by his uncertainty.\r\n\r\nShe forbore in fact for a moment longer to clear it up. "I wish there\r\nwere some one here who might serve--for any contingency--as a witness\r\nthat I _have_ put it to you that I\'m ready to come."\r\n\r\n"Would you like me," her father asked, "to call the landlady?"\r\n\r\n"You may not believe me," she pursued, "but I came really hoping you\r\nmight have found some way. I\'m very sorry, at all events, to leave you\r\nunwell." He turned away from her, on this, and, as he had done before,\r\ntook refuge, by the window, in a stare at the street. "Let me put\r\nit--unfortunately without a witness," she added after a moment, "that\r\nthere\'s only one word you really need speak."\r\n\r\nWhen he took this up it was still with his back to her. "If I don\'t\r\nstrike you as having already spoken it, our time has been singularly\r\nwasted."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll engage with you in respect to my aunt exactly to what she wants\r\nof me in respect to you. She wants me to choose. Very well, I _will_\r\nchoose. I\'ll wash my hands of her for you to just that tune."\r\n\r\nHe at last brought himself round. "Do you know, dear, you make me sick?\r\nI\'ve tried to be clear, and it isn\'t fair."\r\n\r\nBut she passed this over; she was too visibly sincere. "Father!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite see what\'s the matter with you," he said, "and if you\r\ncan\'t pull yourself together I\'ll--upon my honour--take you in hand.\r\nPut you into a cab and deliver you again safe at Lancaster Gate."\r\n\r\nShe was really absent, distant. "Father."\r\n\r\nIt was too much, and he met it sharply. "Well?"\r\n\r\n"Strange as it may be to you to hear me say it, there\'s a good you can\r\ndo me and a help you can render."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it then exactly what I\'ve been trying to make you feel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered patiently, "but so in the wrong way. I\'m perfectly\r\nhonest in what I say, and I know what I\'m talking about. It isn\'t that\r\nI\'ll pretend I could have believed a month ago in anything to call aid\r\nor support from you. The case is changed--that\'s what has happened; my\r\ndifficulty\'s a new one. But even now it\'s not a question of anything I\r\nshould ask you in a way to \'do.\' It\'s simply a question of your not\r\nturning me away--taking yourself out of my life. It\'s simply a question\r\nof your saying: \'Yes then, since you will, we\'ll stand together. We\r\nwon\'t worry in advance about how or where; we\'ll have a faith and find\r\na way.\' That\'s all--_that_ would be the good you\'d do me. I should\r\n_have_ you, and it would be for my benefit. Do you see?"\r\n\r\nIf he didn\'t it was not for want of looking at her hard. "The matter\r\nwith you is that you\'re in love, and that your aunt knows and--for\r\nreasons, I\'m sure, perfect--hates and opposes it. Well she may! It\'s a\r\nmatter in which I trust her with my eyes shut. Go, please." Though he\r\nspoke not in anger--rather in infinite sadness--he fairly turned her\r\nout. Before she took it up he had, as the fullest expression of what he\r\nfelt, opened the door of the room. He had fairly, in his deep\r\ndisapproval, a generous compassion to spare. "I\'m sorry for her,\r\ndeluded woman, if she builds on you."\r\n\r\nKate stood a moment in the draught. "She\'s not the person _I_ pity\r\nmost, for, deluded in many ways though she may be, she\'s not the person\r\nwho\'s most so. I mean," she explained, "if it\'s a question of what you\r\ncall building on me."\r\n\r\nHe took it as if what she meant might be other than her description of\r\nit. "You\'re deceiving _two_ persons then, Mrs. Lowder and somebody\r\nelse?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with detachment. "I\'ve no intention of that sort\r\nwith respect to any one now--to Mrs. Lowder least of all. If you fail\r\nme"--she seemed to make it out for herself--"that has the merit at\r\nleast that it simplifies. I shall go my way--as I see my way."\r\n\r\n"Your way, you mean then, will be to marry some blackguard without a\r\npenny?"\r\n\r\n"You ask a great deal of satisfaction," she observed, "for the little\r\nyou give."\r\n\r\nIt brought him up again before her as with a sense that she was not to\r\nbe hustled; and, though he glared at her a little, this had long been\r\nthe practical limit to his general power of objection. "If you\'re base\r\nenough to incur your aunt\'s disgust, you\'re base enough for my\r\nargument. What, if you\'re not thinking of an utterly improper person,\r\ndo your speeches to me signify? Who _is_ the beggarly sneak?" he\r\ndemanded as her response failed. Her response, when it came, was cold\r\nbut distinct. "He has every disposition to make the best of you. He\r\nonly wants in fact to be kind to you."\r\n\r\n"Then he _must_ be an ass! And how in the world can you consider it to\r\nimprove him for me," her father pursued, "that he\'s also destitute and\r\nimpossible? There are asses and asses, even--the right and the\r\nwrong--and you appear to have carefully picked out one of the wrong.\r\nYour aunt knows _them,_ by good fortune; I perfectly trust, as I tell\r\nyou, her judgment for them; and you may take it from me once for all\r\nthat I won\'t hear of any one of whom _she_ won\'t." Which led up to his\r\nlast word. "If you should really defy us both----!"\r\n\r\n"Well, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my sweet child, I think that--reduced to insignificance as you\r\nmay fondly believe me--I should still not be quite without some way of\r\nmaking you regret it."\r\n\r\nShe had a pause, a grave one, but not, as appeared, that she might\r\nmeasure this danger. "If I shouldn\'t do it, you know, it wouldn\'t be\r\nbecause I\'m afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you don\'t do it," he retorted, "you may be as bold as you like!"\r\n\r\n"Then you can do nothing at all for me?"\r\n\r\nHe showed her, this time unmistakably--it was before her there on the\r\nlanding, at the top of the tortuous stairs and in the midst of the\r\nstrange smell that seemed to cling to them--how vain her appeal\r\nremained. "I\'ve never pretended to do more than my duty; I\'ve given you\r\nthe best and the clearest advice." And then came up the spring that\r\nmoved him. "If it only displeases you, you can go to Marian to be\r\nconsoled." What he couldn\'t forgive was her dividing with Marian her\r\nscant share of the provision their mother had been able to leave them.\r\nShe should have divided it with _him._\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nShe had gone to Mrs. Lowder on her mother\'s death--gone with an effort\r\nthe strain and pain of which made her at present, as she recalled them,\r\nreflect on the long way she had travelled since then. There had been\r\nnothing else to do--not a penny in the other house, nothing but unpaid\r\nbills that had gathered thick while its mistress lay mortally ill, and\r\nthe admonition that there was nothing she must attempt to raise money\r\non, since everything belonged to the "estate." How the estate would\r\nturn out at best presented itself as a mystery altogether gruesome; it\r\nhad proved, in fact, since then a residuum a trifle less scant than,\r\nwith Marian, she had for some weeks feared; but the girl had had at the\r\nbeginning rather a wounded sense of its being watched on behalf of\r\nMarian and her children. What on earth was it supposed that _she_\r\nwanted to do to it? She wanted in truth only to give up--to abandon her\r\nown interest, which she, no doubt, would already have done had not the\r\npoint been subject to Aunt Maud\'s sharp intervention. Aunt Maud\'s\r\nintervention was all sharp now, and the other point, the great one, was\r\nthat it was to be, in this light, either all put up with or all\r\ndeclined. Yet at the winter\'s end, nevertheless, she could scarce have\r\nsaid what stand she conceived she had taken. It wouldn\'t be the first\r\ntime she had seen herself obliged to accept with smothered irony other\r\npeople\'s interpretation of her conduct. She often ended by giving up to\r\nthem--it seemed really the way to live--the version that met their\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe tall, rich, heavy house at Lancaster Gate, on the other side of the\r\nPark and the long South Kensington stretches, had figured to her,\r\nthrough childhood, through girlhood, as the remotest limit of her vague\r\nyoung world. It was further off and more occasional than anything else\r\nin the comparatively compact circle in which she revolved, and seemed,\r\nby a rigour early marked, to be reached through long, straight,\r\ndiscouraging vistas, which kept lengthening and straightening, whereas\r\nalmost everything else in life was either, at the worst, round about\r\nCromwell Road, or, at the furthest, in the nearer parts of Kensington\r\nGardens. Mrs. Lowder was her only "real" aunt, not the wife of an\r\nuncle, and had been thereby, both in ancient days and when the greater\r\ntrouble came, the person, of all persons, properly to make some sign;\r\nin accord with which our young woman\'s feeling was founded on the\r\nimpression, quite cherished for years, that the signs made across the\r\ninterval just mentioned had never been really in the note of the\r\nsituation. The main office of this relative, for the young Croys--apart\r\nfrom giving them their fixed measure of social greatness--had struck\r\nthem as being to form them to a conception of what they were not to\r\nexpect. When Kate came to think matters over with the aid of knowledge,\r\nshe failed quite to see how Aunt Maud could have been different--she\r\nhad rather perceived by this time how many other things might have\r\nbeen; yet she also made out that if they had all consciously lived\r\nunder a liability to the chill breath of _ultima Thule_ they couldn\'t,\r\neither, on the facts, very well have done less. What in the event\r\nappeared established was that if Mrs. Lowder had disliked them she had\r\nyet not disliked them so much as they supposed. It had at any rate been\r\nfor the purpose of showing how she struggled with her aversion that she\r\nsometimes came to see them, that she at regular periods invited them to\r\nher house, and in short, as it now looked, kept them along on the terms\r\nthat would best give her sister the perennial luxury of a grievance.\r\nThis sister, poor Mrs. Croy, the girl knew, had always judged her\r\nresentfully, and had brought them up, Marian, the boys and herself, to\r\nthe idea of a particular attitude, for signs of the practice of which\r\nthey watched each other with awe. The attitude was to make plain to\r\nAunt Maud, with the same regularity as her invitations, that they\r\nsufficed--thanks awfully--to themselves. But the ground of it, Kate\r\nlived to discern, was that this was only because _she_ didn\'t suffice\r\nto them. The little she offered was to be accepted under protest, yet\r\nnot, really, because it was excessive. It wounded them--there was the\r\nrub!--because it fell short.\r\n\r\nThe number of new things our young lady looked out on from the high\r\nsouth window that hung over the Park--this number was so great (though\r\nsome of the things were only old ones altered and, as the phrase was of\r\nother matters, done up), that life at present turned to her view from\r\nweek to week more and more the face of a striking and distinguished\r\nstranger. She had reached a great age--for it quite seemed to her that\r\nat twenty-five it was late to reconsider; and her most general sense\r\nwas a shade of regret that she had not known earlier. The world was\r\ndifferent--whether for worse or for better--from her rudimentary\r\nreadings, and it gave her the feeling of a wasted past. If she had only\r\nknown sooner she might have arranged herself more to meet it. She made,\r\nat all events, discoveries every day, some of which were about herself\r\nand others about other persons. Two of these--one under each head--more\r\nparticularly engaged, in alternation, her anxiety. She saw as she had\r\nnever seen before how material things spoke to her. She saw, and she\r\nblushed to see, that if, in contrast with some of its old aspects, life\r\nnow affected her as a dress successfully "done up," this was exactly by\r\nreason of the trimmings and lace, was a matter of ribbons and silk and\r\nvelvet. She had a dire accessibility to pleasure from such sources. She\r\nliked the charming quarters her aunt had assigned her--liked them\r\nliterally more than she had in all her other days liked anything; and\r\nnothing could have been more uneasy than her suspicion of her\r\nrelative\'s view of this truth. Her relative was prodigious--she had\r\nnever done her relative justice. These larger conditions all tasted of\r\nher, from morning till night; but she was a person in respect to whom\r\nthe growth of acquaintance could only--strange as it might seem--keep\r\nyour heart in your mouth.\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s second great discovery was that, so far from having been for\r\nMrs. Lowder a subject of superficial consideration, the blighted home\r\nin Lexham Gardens had haunted her nights and her days. Kate had spent,\r\nall winter, hours of observation that were not less pointed for being\r\nspent alone; recent events, which her mourning explained, assured her a\r\nmeasure of isolation, and it was in the isolation above all that her\r\nneighbour\'s influence worked. Sitting far downstairs Aunt Maud was yet\r\na presence from which a sensitive niece could feel herself extremely\r\nunder pressure. She knew herself now, the sensitive niece, as having\r\nbeen marked from far back. She knew more than she could have told you,\r\nby the upstairs fire, in a whole dark December afternoon. She knew so\r\nmuch that her knowledge was what fairly kept her there, making her at\r\ntimes more endlessly between the small silk-covered sofa that stood for\r\nher in the firelight and the great grey map of Middlesex spread beneath\r\nher lookout. To go down, to forsake her refuge, was to meet some of her\r\ndiscoveries half-way, to have to face them or fly before them; whereas\r\nthey were at such a height only like the rumble of a far-off siege\r\nheard in the provisioned citadel. She had almost liked, in these weeks,\r\nwhat had created her suspense and her stress: the loss of her mother,\r\nthe submersion of her father, the discomfort of her sister, the\r\nconfirmation of their shrunken prospects, the certainty, in especial,\r\nof her having to recognise that, should she behave, as she called it,\r\ndecently--that is still do something for others--she would be herself\r\nwholly without supplies. She held that she had a right to sadness and\r\nstillness; she nursed them for their postponing power. What they mainly\r\npostponed was the question of a surrender--though she could not yet\r\nhave said exactly of what: a general surrender of everything--that was\r\nat moments the way it presented itself--to Aunt Maud\'s looming\r\n"personality." It was by her personality that Aunt Maud was prodigious,\r\nand the great mass of it loomed because, in the thick, the foglike air\r\nof her arranged existence, there were parts doubtless magnified and\r\nparts certainly vague. They represented at all events alike, the dim\r\nand the distinct, a strong will and a high hand. It was perfectly\r\npresent to Kate that she might be devoured, and she likened herself to\r\na trembling kid, kept apart a day or two till her turn should come, but\r\nsure sooner or later to be introduced into the cage of the lioness.\r\n\r\nThe cage was Aunt Maud\'s own room, her office, her counting-house, her\r\nbattlefield, her especial scene, in fine, of action, situated on the\r\nground-floor, opening from the main hall and figuring rather to our\r\nyoung woman on exit and entrance as a guard house or a toll-gate. The\r\nlioness waited--the kid had at least that consciousness; was aware of\r\nthe neighbourhood of a morsel she had reason to suppose tender. She\r\nwould have been meanwhile a wonderful lioness for a show, an\r\nextraordinary figure in a cage or anywhere; majestic, magnificent,\r\nhigh-coloured, all brilliant gloss, perpetual satin, twinkling bugles\r\nand flashing gems, with a lustre of agate eyes, a sheen of raven hair,\r\na polish of complexion that was like that of well-kept china and\r\nthat--as if the skin were too tight--told especially at curves and\r\ncorners. Her niece had a quiet name for her--she kept it quiet;\r\nthinking of her, with a free fancy, as somehow typically insular, she\r\ntalked to herself of Britannia of the Market Place--Britannia\r\nunmistakable, but with a pen in her ear, and felt she should not be\r\nhappy till she might on some occasion add to the rest of the panoply a\r\nhelmet, a shield, a trident and a ledger. It was not in truth, however,\r\nthat the forces with which, as Kate felt, she would have to deal were\r\nthose most suggested by an image simple and broad; she was learning,\r\nafter all, each day, to know her companion, and what she had already\r\nmost perceived was the mistake of trusting to easy analogies. There was\r\na whole side of Britannia, the side of her florid philistinism, her\r\nplumes and her train, her fantastic furniture and heaving bosom, the\r\nfalse gods of her taste and false notes of her talk, the sole\r\ncontemplation of which would be dangerously misleading. She was a\r\ncomplex and subtle Britannia, as passionate as she was practical, with\r\na reticule for her prejudices as deep as that other pocket, the pocket\r\nfull of coins stamped in her image, that the world best knew her by.\r\nShe carried on, in short, behind her aggressive and defensive front,\r\noperations determined by her wisdom. It was in fact, we have hinted, as\r\na besieger that our young lady, in the provisioned citadel, had for the\r\npresent most to think of her, and what made her formidable in this\r\ncharacter was that she was unscrupulous and immoral. So, at all events,\r\nin silent sessions and a youthful off-hand way, Kate conveniently\r\npictured her: what this sufficiently represented being that her weight\r\nwas in the scale of certain dangers--those dangers that, by our\r\nshowing, made the younger woman linger and lurk above, while the elder,\r\nbelow, both militant and diplomatic, covered as much of the ground as\r\npossible. Yet what were the dangers, after all, but just the dangers of\r\nlife and of London? Mrs. Lowder _was_ London, _was_ life--the roar of\r\nthe siege and the thick of the fray. There were some things, after all,\r\nof which Britannia was afraid; but Aunt Maud was afraid of nothing--not\r\neven, it would appear, of arduous thought. These impressions, none the\r\nless, Kate kept so much to herself that she scarce shared them with\r\npoor Marian, the ostensible purpose of her frequent visits to whom yet\r\ncontinued to be to talk over everything. One of her reasons for holding\r\noff from the last concession to Aunt Maud was that she might be the\r\nmore free to commit herself to this so much nearer and so much less\r\nfortunate relative, with whom Aunt Maud would have, directly, almost\r\nnothing to do. The sharpest pinch of her state, meanwhile, was exactly\r\nthat all intercourse with her sister had the effect of casting down her\r\ncourage and tying her hands, adding daily to her sense of the part, not\r\nalways either uplifting or sweetening, that the bond of blood might\r\nplay in one\'s life. She was face to face with it now, with the bond of\r\nblood; the consciousness of it was what she seemed most clearly to have\r\n"come into" by the death of her mother, much of that consciousness as\r\nher mother had absorbed and carried away. Her haunting, harrassing\r\nfather, her menacing, uncompromising aunt, her portionless little\r\nnephews and nieces, were figures that caused the chord of natural piety\r\nsuperabundantly to vibrate. Her manner of putting it to herself--but\r\nmore especially in respect to Marian--was that she saw what you might\r\nbe brought to by the cultivation of consanguinity. She had taken, in\r\nthe old days, as she supposed, the measure of this liability; those\r\nbeing the days when, as the second-born, she had thought no one in the\r\nworld so pretty as Marian, no one so charming, so clever, so assured,\r\nin advance, of happiness and success. The view was different now, but\r\nher attitude had been obliged, for many reasons, to show as the same.\r\nThe subject of this estimate was no longer pretty, as the reason for\r\nthinking her clever was no longer plain; yet, bereaved, disappointed,\r\ndemoralised, querulous, she was all the more sharply and insistently\r\nKate\'s elder and Kate\'s own. Kate\'s most constant feeling about her was\r\nthat she would make her, Kate, do things; and always, in comfortless\r\nChelsea, at the door of the small house the small rent of which she\r\ncouldn\'t help having on her mind, she fatalistically asked herself,\r\nbefore going in, which thing it would probably be this time. She\r\nnoticed with profundity that disappointment made people selfish; she\r\nmarvelled at the serenity--it was the poor woman\'s only one--of what\r\nMarian took for granted: her own state of abasement as the second-born,\r\nher life reduced to mere inexhaustible sisterhood. She existed, in that\r\nview, wholly for the small house in Chelsea; the moral of which\r\nmoreover, of course, was that the more one gave oneself the less of one\r\nwas left. There were always people to snatch at one, and it would never\r\noccur to _them_ that they were eating one up. They did that without\r\ntasting.\r\n\r\nThere was no such misfortune, or at any rate no such discomfort, she\r\nfurther reasoned, as to be formed at once for being and for seeing. You\r\nalways saw, in this case, something else than what you were, and you\r\ngot, in consequence, none of the peace of your condition. However, as\r\nshe never really let Marian see what she was, Marian might well not\r\nhave been aware that she herself saw. Kate was accordingly, to her own\r\nvision, not a hypocrite of virtue, for she gave herself up; but she was\r\na hypocrite of stupidity, for she kept to herself everything that was\r\nnot herself. What she most kept was the particular sentiment with which\r\nshe watched her sister instinctively neglect nothing that would make\r\nfor her submission to their aunt; a state of the spirit that perhaps\r\nmarked most sharply how poor you might become when you minded so much\r\nthe absence of wealth. It was through Kate that Aunt Maud should be\r\nworked, and nothing mattered less than what might become of Kate in the\r\nprocess. Kate was to burn her ships, in short, so that Marian should\r\nprofit; and Marian\'s desire to profit was quite oblivious of a dignity\r\nthat had, after all, its reasons--if it had only cared for them--for\r\nkeeping itself a little stiff. Kate, to be properly stiff for both of\r\nthem, would therefore have had to be selfish, have had to prefer an\r\nideal of behaviour--than which nothing, ever, was more selfish--to the\r\npossibility of stray crumbs for the four small creatures. The tale of\r\nMrs. Lowder\'s disgust at her elder niece\'s marriage to Mr. Condrip had\r\nlost little of its point; the incredibly fatuous behaviour of Mr.\r\nCondrip, the parson of a dull suburban parish, with a saintly profile\r\nwhich was always in evidence, being so distinctly on record to keep\r\ncriticism consistent. He had presented his profile on system, having,\r\ngoodness knew, nothing else to present--nothing at all to full-face the\r\nworld with, no imagination of the propriety of living and minding his\r\nbusiness. Criticism had remained on Aunt Maud\'s part consistent enough;\r\nshe was not a person to regard such proceedings as less of a mistake\r\nfor having acquired more of the privilege of pathos. She had not been\r\nforgiving, and the only approach she made to overlooking them was by\r\noverlooking--with the surviving delinquent--the solid little phalanx\r\nthat now represented them. Of the two sinister ceremonies that she\r\nlumped together, the marriage and the interment, she had been present\r\nat the former, just as she had sent Marian, before it, a liberal\r\ncheque; but this had not been for her more than the shadow of an\r\nadmitted link with Mrs. Condrip\'s course. She disapproved of clamorous\r\nchildren for whom there was no prospect; she disapproved of weeping\r\nwidows who couldn\'t make their errors good; and she had thus put within\r\nMarian\'s reach one of the few luxuries left when so much else had gone,\r\nan easy pretext for a constant grievance. Kate Croy remembered well\r\nwhat their mother, in a different quarter, had made of it; and it was\r\nMarian\'s marked failure to pluck the fruit of resentment that committed\r\nthem, as sisters, to an almost equal fellowship in abjection. If the\r\ntheory was that, yes, alas, one of the pair had ceased to be noticed,\r\nbut that the other was noticed enough to make up for it, who would fail\r\nto see that Kate couldn\'t separate herself without a cruel pride? That\r\nlesson became sharp for our young lady the day after her interview with\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine," Marian on this occasion said to her, "how you can\r\nthink of anything else in the world but the horrid way we\'re situated."\r\n\r\n"And, pray, how do you know," Kate inquired in reply, "anything about\r\nmy thoughts? It seems to me I give you sufficient proof of how much I\r\nthink of _you._ I don\'t, really, my dear, know what else you\'ve to do\r\nwith!"\r\n\r\nMarian\'s retort, on this, was a stroke as to which she had supplied\r\nherself with several kinds of preparation, but there was, none the\r\nless, something of an unexpected note in its promptitude. She had\r\nforeseen her sister\'s general fear; but here, ominously, was the\r\nspecial one. "Well, your own business is of course your own business,\r\nand you may say there\'s no one less in a position than I to preach to\r\nyou. But, all the same, if you wash your hands of me for ever for it, I\r\nwon\'t, for this once, keep back that I don\'t consider you\'ve a right,\r\nas we all stand, to throw yourself away."\r\n\r\nIt was after the children\'s dinner, which was also their mother\'s, but\r\nwhich their aunt mostly contrived to keep from ever becoming her own\r\nluncheon; and the two young women were still in the presence of the\r\ncrumpled table-cloth, the dispersed pinafores, the scraped dishes, the\r\nlingering odour of boiled food. Kate had asked, with ceremony, if she\r\nmight put up a window a little, and Mrs. Condrip had replied without it\r\nthat she might do as she liked. She often received such inquiries as if\r\nthey reflected in a manner on the pure essence of her little ones. The\r\nfour had retired, with much movement and noise, under imperfect control\r\nof the small Irish governess whom their aunt had hunted out for them\r\nand whose brooding resolve not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she\r\nalready more than suspected. Their mother had become for Kate--who took\r\nit just for the effect of being their mother--quite a different thing\r\nfrom the mild Marian of the past: Mr. Condrip\'s widow expansively\r\nobscured that image. She was little more than a ragged relic, a plain,\r\nprosaic result of him, as if she had somehow been pulled through him as\r\nthrough an obstinate funnel, only to be left crumpled and useless and\r\nwith nothing in her but what he accounted for. She had grown red and\r\nalmost fat, which were not happy signs of mourning; less and less like\r\nany Croy, particularly a Croy in trouble, and sensibly like her\r\nhusband\'s two unmarried sisters, who came to see her, in Kate\'s view,\r\nmuch too often and stayed too long, with the consequence of inroads\r\nupon the tea and bread-and-butter--matters as to which Kate, not\r\nunconcerned with the tradesmen\'s books, had feelings. About them,\r\nmoreover, Marian _was_ touchy, and her nearer relative, who observed\r\nand weighed things, noted as an oddity that she would have taken any\r\nreflection on them as a reflection on herself. If that was what\r\nmarriage necessarily did to you, Kate Croy would have questioned\r\nmarriage. It was a grave example, at any rate, of what a man--and such\r\na man!--might make of a woman. She could see how the Condrip pair\r\npressed their brother\'s widow on the subject of Aunt Maud--who wasn\'t,\r\nafter all, _their_ aunt; made her, over their interminable cups,\r\nchatter and even swagger about Lancaster Gate, made her more vulgar\r\nthan it had seemed written that any Croy could possibly become on such\r\na subject. They laid it down, they rubbed it in, that Lancaster Gate\r\nwas to be kept in sight, and that she, Kate, was to keep it; so that,\r\ncuriously, or at all events sadly, our young woman was sure of being,\r\nin her own person, more permitted to them as an object of comment than\r\nthey would in turn ever be permitted to herself. The beauty of which,\r\ntoo, was that Marian didn\'t love them. But they were Condrips--they had\r\ngrown near the rose; they were almost like Bertie and Maudie, like\r\nKitty and Guy. They talked of the dead to her, which Kate never did; it\r\nbeing a relation in which Kate could but mutely listen. She couldn\'t\r\nindeed too often say to herself that if that was what marriage did to\r\nyou----! It may easily be guessed, therefore, that the ironic light of\r\nsuch reserves fell straight across the field of Marian\'s warning. "I\r\ndon\'t quite see," she answered, "where, in particular, it strikes you\r\nthat my danger lies. I\'m not conscious, I assure you, of the least\r\n\'disposition\' to throw myself anywhere. I feel as if, for the present,\r\nI have been quite sufficiently thrown."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t feel"--Marian brought it all out--"as if you would like to\r\nmarry Merton Densher?"\r\n\r\nKate took a moment to meet this inquiry. "Is it your idea that if I\r\nshould feel so I would be bound to give you notice, so that you might\r\nstep in and head me off? Is that your idea?" the girl asked. Then, as\r\nher sister also had a pause, "I don\'t know what makes you talk of Mr.\r\nDensher," she observed.\r\n\r\n"I talk of him just because you don\'t. That you never do, in spite of\r\nwhat I know--that\'s what makes me think of him. Or rather perhaps it\'s\r\nwhat makes me think of _you._ If you don\'t know by this time what I\r\nhope for you, what I dream of--my attachment being what it is--it\'s no\r\nuse my attempting to tell you." But Marian had in fact warmed to her\r\nwork, and Kate was sure she had discussed Mr. Densher with the Miss\r\nCondrips. "If I name that person I suppose it\'s because I\'m so afraid\r\nof him. If you want really to know, he fills me with terror. If you\r\nwant really to know, in fact, I dislike him as much as I dread him."\r\n\r\n"And yet don\'t think it dangerous to abuse him to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Mrs. Condrip confessed, "I do think it dangerous; but how can I\r\nspeak of him otherwise? I dare say, I admit, that I shouldn\'t speak of\r\nhim at all. Only I do want you for once, as I said just now, to know."\r\n\r\n"To know what, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"That I should regard it," Marian promptly returned, "as far and away\r\nthe worst thing that has happened to us yet."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean because he hasn\'t money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for one thing. And because I don\'t believe in him."\r\n\r\nKate was civil, but perfunctory. "What do you mean by not believing in\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Well, being sure he\'ll never get it. And you _must_ have it. You\r\n_shall_ have it."\r\n\r\n"To give it to you?"\r\n\r\nMarian met her with a readiness that was practically pert. "To _have_\r\nit, first. Not, at any rate, to go on not having it. Then we should\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"We should indeed!" said Kate Croy. It was talk of a kind she loathed,\r\nbut if Marian chose to be vulgar what was one to do? It made her think\r\nof the Miss Condrips with renewed aversion. "I like the way you arrange\r\nthings--I like what you take for granted. If it\'s so easy for us to\r\nmarry men who want us to scatter gold, I wonder we any of us do\r\nanything else. I don\'t see so many of them about, nor what interest I\r\nmight ever have for them. You live, my dear," she presently added, "in\r\na world of vain thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Not so much as you, Kate; for I see what I see, and you can\'t turn it\r\noff that way." The elder sister paused long enough for the younger\'s\r\nface to show, in spite of superiority, an apprehension. "I\'m not\r\ntalking of any man but Aunt Maud\'s man, nor of any money, even, if you\r\nlike, but Aunt Maud\'s money. I\'m not talking of anything but your doing\r\nwhat _she_ wants. You\'re wrong if you speak of anything that I want of\r\nyou; I want nothing but what she does. That\'s good enough for me!"--and\r\nMarian\'s tone struck her companion as dreadful. "If I don\'t believe in\r\nMerton Densher, I do at least in Mrs. Lowder."\r\n\r\n"Your ideas are the more striking," Kate returned, "that they\'re the\r\nsame as papa\'s. I had them from him, you may be interested to know--and\r\nwith all the brilliancy you may imagine--yesterday."\r\n\r\nMarian clearly was interested to know. "He has been to see you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I went to him."\r\n\r\n"Really?" Marian wondered. "For what purpose?"\r\n\r\n"To tell him I\'m ready to go to him."\r\n\r\nMarian stared. "To leave Aunt Maud----?"\r\n\r\n"For my father, yes."\r\n\r\nShe had fairly flushed, poor Mrs. Condrip, with horror. "You\'re\r\nready----?"\r\n\r\n"So I told him. I couldn\'t tell him less."\r\n\r\n"And, pray, could you tell him more?" Marian gasped in her distress.\r\n"What in the world is he _to_ us? You bring out such a thing as that\r\nthis way?"\r\n\r\nThey faced each other--the tears were in Marian\'s eyes. Kate watched\r\nthem there a moment and then said: "I had thought it well over--over\r\nand over. But you needn\'t feel injured. I\'m not going. He won\'t have\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHer companion still panted--it took time to subside. "Well, _I_\r\nwouldn\'t have you--wouldn\'t receive you at all, I can assure you--if he\r\nhad made you any other answer. I do feel injured--at your having been\r\nwilling. If you were to go to papa, my dear, you would have to stop\r\ncoming to me." Marian put it thus, indefinably, as a picture of\r\nprivation from which her companion might shrink. Such were the threats\r\nshe could complacently make, could think herself masterful for making.\r\n"But if he won\'t take you," she continued, "he shows at least his\r\nsharpness."\r\n\r\nMarian had always her views of sharpness; she was, as her sister\r\nprivately commented, great on it. But Kate had her refuge from\r\nirritation. "He won\'t take me," she simply repeated. "But he believes,\r\nlike you, in Aunt Maud. He threatens me with his curse if I leave her."\r\n\r\n"So you _won\'t?"_ As the girl at first said nothing her companion\r\ncaught at it. "You won\'t, of course? I see you won\'t. But I don\'t see\r\nwhy, nevertheless, I shouldn\'t insist to you once for all on the plain\r\ntruth of the whole matter. The truth, my dear, of your duty. Do you\r\never think about _that?_ It\'s the greatest duty of all."\r\n\r\n"There you are again," Kate laughed. "Papa\'s also immense on my duty."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t pretend to be immense, but I pretend to know more than you\r\ndo of life; more even perhaps than papa." Marian seemed to see that\r\npersonage at this moment, nevertheless, in the light of a kinder irony.\r\n"Poor old papa!"\r\n\r\nShe sighed it with as many condonations as her sister\'s ear had more\r\nthan once caught in her "Dear old Aunt Maud!" These were things that\r\nmade Kate, for the time, turn sharply away, and she gathered herself\r\nnow to go. They were the note again of the abject; it was hard to say\r\nwhich of the persons in question had most shown how little they liked\r\nher. The younger woman proposed, at any rate, to let discussion rest,\r\nand she believed that, for herself, she had done so during the ten\r\nminutes that, thanks to her wish not to break off short, elapsed before\r\nshe could gracefully withdraw. It then appeared, however, that Marian\r\nhad been discussing still, and there was something that, at the last,\r\nKate had to take up. "Whom do you mean by Aunt Maud\'s young man?"\r\n\r\n"Whom should I mean but Lord Mark?"\r\n\r\n"And where do you pick up such vulgar twaddle?" Kate demanded with her\r\nclear face. "How does such stuff, in this hole, get to you?"\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner spoken than she asked herself what had become of the\r\ngrace to which she had sacrificed. Marian certainly did little to save\r\nit, and nothing indeed was so inconsequent as her ground of complaint.\r\nShe desired her to "work" Lancaster Gate as she believed that scene of\r\nabundance could be worked; but she now didn\'t see why advantage should\r\nbe taken of the bloated connection to put an affront on her own poor\r\nhome. She appeared in fact for the moment to take the position that\r\nKate kept her in her "hole" and then heartlessly reflected on her being\r\nin it. Yet she didn\'t explain how she had picked up the report on which\r\nher sister had challenged her--so that it was thus left to her sister\r\nto see in it, once more, a sign of the creeping curiosity of the Miss\r\nCondrips. They lived in a deeper hole than Marian, but they kept their\r\near to the ground, they spent their days in prowling, whereas Marian,\r\nin garments and shoes that seemed steadily to grow looser and larger,\r\nnever prowled. There were times when Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips\r\nwere offered her by fate as a warning for her own future--to be taken\r\nas showing her what she herself might become at forty if she let things\r\ntoo recklessly go. What was expected of her by others--and by so many\r\nof them--could, all the same, on occasion, present itself as beyond a\r\njoke; and this was just now the aspect it particularly wore. She was\r\nnot only to quarrel with Merton Densher to oblige her five\r\nspectators--with the Miss Condrips there were five; she was to set\r\nforth in pursuit of Lord Mark on some preposterous theory of the\r\npremium attached to success. Mrs. Lowder\'s hand had attached it, and it\r\nfigured at the end of the course as a bell that would ring, break out\r\ninto public clamour, as soon as touched. Kate reflected sharply enough\r\non the weak points of this fond fiction, with the result at last of a\r\ncertain chill for her sister\'s confidence; though Mrs. Condrip still\r\ntook refuge in the plea--which was after all the great point--that\r\ntheir aunt would be munificent when their aunt should be pleased. The\r\nexact identity of her candidate was a detail; what was of the essence\r\nwas her conception of the kind of match it was open to her niece to\r\nmake with her aid. Marian always spoke of marriages as "matches," but\r\nthat was again a detail. Mrs. Lowder\'s "aid" meanwhile awaited them--if\r\nnot to light the way to Lord Mark, then to somebody better. Marian\r\nwould put up, in fine, with somebody better; she only wouldn\'t put up\r\nwith somebody so much worse. Kate had, once more, to go through all\r\nthis before a graceful issue was reached. It was reached by her paying\r\nwith the sacrifice of Mr. Densher for her reduction of Lord Mark to the\r\nabsurd. So they separated softly enough. She was to be let off hearing\r\nabout Lord Mark so long as she made it good that she wasn\'t underhand\r\nabout anybody else. She had denied everything and every one, she\r\nreflected as she went away--and that was a relief; but it also made\r\nrather a clean sweep of the future. The prospect put on a bareness that\r\nalready gave her something in common with the Miss Condrips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMerton Densher, who passed the best hours of each night at the office\r\nof his newspaper, had at times, during the day, to make up for it, a\r\nsense, or at least an appearance, of leisure, in accordance with which\r\nhe was not infrequently to be met, in different parts of the town, at\r\nmoments when men of business are hidden from the public eye. More than\r\nonce, during the present winter\'s end, he had deviated, toward three\r\no\'clock, or toward four, into Kensington Gardens, where he might for a\r\nwhile, on each occasion, have been observed to demean himself as a\r\nperson with nothing to do. He made his way indeed, for the most part,\r\nwith a certain directness, over to the north side; but once that ground\r\nwas reached his behaviour was noticeably wanting in point. He moved\r\nseemingly at random from alley to alley; he stopped for no reason and\r\nremained idly agaze; he sat down in a chair and then changed to a\r\nbench; after which he walked about again, only again to repeat both the\r\nvagueness and the vivacity. Distinctly, he was a man either with\r\nnothing at all to do or with ever so much to think about; and it was\r\nnot to be denied that the impression he might often thus easily make\r\nhad the effect of causing the burden of proof, in certain directions,\r\nto rest on him. It was a little the fault of his aspect, his personal\r\nmarks, which made it almost impossible to name his profession.\r\n\r\nHe was a longish, leanish, fairish young Englishman, not unamenable, on\r\ncertain sides, to classification--as for instance by being a gentleman,\r\nby being rather specifically one of the educated, one of the generally\r\nsound and generally pleasant; yet, though to that degree neither\r\nextraordinary nor abnormal, he would have failed to play straight into\r\nan observer\'s hands. He was young for the House of Commons, he was\r\nloose for the army. He was refined, as might have been said, for the\r\ncity, and, quite apart from the cut of his cloth, he was sceptical, it\r\nmight have been felt, for the church. On the other hand he was\r\ncredulous for diplomacy, or perhaps even for science, while he was\r\nperhaps at the same time too much in his mere senses for poetry, and\r\nyet too little in them for art. You would have got fairly near him by\r\nmaking out in his eyes the potential recognition of ideas; but you\r\nwould have quite fallen away again on the question of the ideas\r\nthemselves. The difficulty with Densher was that he looked vague\r\nwithout looking weak--idle without looking empty. It was the accident,\r\npossibly, of his long legs, which were apt to stretch themselves; of\r\nhis straight hair and his well-shaped head, never, the latter, neatly\r\nsmooth, and apt, into the bargain, at the time of quite other calls\r\nupon it, to throw itself suddenly back and, supported behind by his\r\nuplifted arms and interlocked hands, place him for unconscionable\r\nperiods in communion with the ceiling, the tree-tops, the sky. He was\r\nin short visibly absent-minded, irregularly clever, liable to drop what\r\nwas near and to take up what was far; he was more a respecter, in\r\ngeneral, than a follower of custom. He suggested above all, however,\r\nthat wondrous state of youth in which the elements, the metals more or\r\nless precious, are so in fusion and fermentation that the question of\r\nthe final stamp, the pressure that fixes the value, must wait for\r\ncomparative coolness. And it was a mark of his interesting mixture that\r\nif he was irritable it was by a law of considerable subtlety--a law\r\nthat, in intercourse with him, it might be of profit, though not easy,\r\nto master. One of the effects of it was that he had for you surprises\r\nof tolerance as well as of temper.\r\n\r\nHe loitered, on the best of the relenting days, the several occasions\r\nwe speak of, along the part of the Gardens nearest to Lancaster Gate,\r\nand when, always, in due time, Kate Croy came out of her aunt\'s house,\r\ncrossed the road and arrived by the nearest entrance, there was a\r\ngeneral publicity in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous.\r\nIf their meeting was to be bold and free it might have taken place\r\nwithin doors; if it was to be shy or secret it might have taken place\r\nalmost anywhere better than under Mrs. Lowder\'s windows. They failed\r\nindeed to remain attached to that spot; they wandered and strolled,\r\ntaking in the course of more than one of these interviews a\r\nconsiderable walk, or else picked out a couple of chairs under one of\r\nthe great trees and sat as much apart--apart from every one else--as\r\npossible. But Kate had, each time, at first, the air of wishing to\r\nexpose herself to pursuit and capture if those things were in question.\r\nShe made the point that she was not underhand, any more than she was\r\nvulgar; that the Gardens were charming in themselves and this use of\r\nthem a matter of taste; and that, if her aunt chose to glare at her\r\nfrom the drawing-room or to cause her to be tracked and overtaken, she\r\ncould at least make it convenient that this should be easily done. The\r\nfact was that the relation between these young persons abounded in such\r\noddities as were not inaptly symbolised by assignations that had a good\r\ndeal more appearance than motive. Of the strength of the tie that held\r\nthem we shall sufficiently take the measure; but it was meanwhile\r\nalmost obvious that if the great possibility had come up for them it\r\nhad done so, to an exceptional degree, under the protection of the\r\nfamous law of contraries. Any deep harmony that might eventually govern\r\nthem would not be the result of their having much in common--having\r\nanything, in fact, but their affection; and would really find its\r\nexplanation in some sense, on the part of each, of being poor where the\r\nother was rich. It is nothing new indeed that generous young persons\r\noften admire most what nature hasn\'t given them--from which it would\r\nappear, after all, that our friends were both generous.\r\n\r\nMerton Densher had repeatedly said to himself--and from far back--that\r\nhe should be a fool not to marry a woman whose value would be in her\r\ndifferences; and Kate Croy, though without having quite so\r\nphilosophised, had quickly recognised in the young man a precious\r\nunlikeness. He represented what her life had never given her and\r\ncertainly, without some such aid as his, never would give her; all the\r\nhigh, dim things she lumped together as of the mind. It was on the side\r\nof the mind that Densher was rich for her, and mysterious and strong;\r\nand he had rendered her in especial the sovereign service of making\r\nthat element real. She had had, all her days, to take it terribly on\r\ntrust; no creature she had ever encountered having been able in any\r\ndegree to testify for it directly. Vague rumours of its existence had\r\nmade their precarious way to her; but nothing had, on the whole, struck\r\nher as more likely than that she should live and die without the chance\r\nto verify them. The chance had come--it was an extraordinary one--on\r\nthe day she first met Densher; and it was to the girl\'s lasting honour\r\nthat she knew on the spot what she was in the presence of. That\r\noccasion indeed, for everything that straightway flowered in it, would\r\nbe worthy of high commemoration; Densher\'s perception went out to meet\r\nthe young woman\'s and quite kept pace with her own recognition. Having\r\nso often concluded on the fact of his weakness, as he called it, for\r\nlife--his strength merely for thought--life, he logically opined, was\r\nwhat he must somehow arrange to annex and possess. This was so much a\r\nnecessity that thought by itself only went on in the void; it was from\r\nthe immediate air of life that it must draw its breath. So the young\r\nman, ingenious but large, critical but ardent too, made out both his\r\ncase and Kate Croy\'s. They had originally met before her mother\'s\r\ndeath--an occasion marked for her as the last pleasure permitted by the\r\napproach of that event; after which the dark months had interposed a\r\nscreen and, for all Kate knew, made the end one with the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe beginning--to which she often went back--had been a scene, for our\r\nyoung woman, of supreme brilliancy; a party given at a "gallery" hired\r\nby a hostess who fished with big nets. A Spanish dancer, understood to\r\nbe at that moment the delight of the town, an American reciter, the joy\r\nof a kindred people, an Hungarian fiddler, the wonder of the world at\r\nlarge--in the name of these and other attractions the company in which,\r\nby a rare privilege, Kate found herself had been freely convoked. She\r\nlived under her mother\'s roof, as she considered, obscurely, and was\r\nacquainted with few persons who entertained on that scale; but she had\r\nhad dealings with two or three connected, as appeared, with such--two\r\nor three through whom the stream of hospitality, filtered or diffused,\r\ncould thus now and then spread to outlying receptacles. A good-natured\r\nlady in fine, a friend of her mother and a relative of the lady of the\r\ngallery, had offered to take her to the party in question and had there\r\nfortified her, further, with two or three of those introductions that,\r\nat large parties, lead to other things--that had at any rate, on this\r\noccasion, culminated for her in conversation with a tall, fair,\r\nslightly unbrushed and rather awkward, but on the whole not dreary,\r\nyoung man. The young man had affected her as detached, as--it was\r\nindeed what he called himself--awfully at sea, as much more distinct\r\nfrom what surrounded them than any one else appeared to be, and even as\r\nprobably quite disposed to be making his escape when pulled up to be\r\nplaced in relation with her. He gave her his word for it indeed, that\r\nsame evening, that only their meeting had prevented his flight, but\r\nthat now he saw how sorry he should have been to miss it. This point\r\nthey had reached by midnight, and though in respect to such remarks\r\neverything was in the tone, the tone was by midnight there too. She had\r\nhad originally her full apprehension of his coerced, certainly of his\r\nvague, condition--full apprehensions often being with her immediate;\r\nthen she had had her equal consciousness that, within five minutes,\r\nsomething between them had--well, she couldn\'t call it anything but\r\n_come._ It was nothing, but it was somehow everything--it was that\r\nsomething for each of them had happened.\r\n\r\nThey had found themselves looking at each other straight, and for a\r\nlonger time on end than was usual even at parties in galleries; but\r\nthat, after all, would have been a small affair, if there hadn\'t been\r\nsomething else with it. It wasn\'t, in a word, simply that their eyes\r\nhad met; other conscious organs, faculties, feelers had met as well,\r\nand when Kate afterwards imaged to herself the sharp, deep fact she saw\r\nit, in the oddest way, as a particular performance. She had observed a\r\nladder against a garden wall, and had trusted herself so to climb it as\r\nto be able to see over into the probable garden on the other side. On\r\nreaching the top she had found herself face to face with a gentleman\r\nengaged in a like calculation at the same moment, and the two inquirers\r\nhad remained confronted on their ladders. The great point was that for\r\nthe rest of that evening they had been perched--they had not climbed\r\ndown; and indeed, during the time that followed, Kate at least had had\r\nthe perched feeling--it was as if she were there aloft without a\r\nretreat. A simpler expression of all this is doubtless but that they\r\nhad taken each other in with interest; and without a happy hazard six\r\nmonths later the incident would have closed in that account of it. The\r\naccident, meanwhile, had been as natural as anything in London ever is:\r\nKate had one afternoon found herself opposite Mr. Densher on the\r\nUnderground Railway. She had entered the train at Sloane Square to go\r\nto Queen\'s Road, and the carriage in which she had found a place was\r\nall but full. Densher was already in it--on the other bench and at the\r\nfurthest angle; she was sure of him before they had again started. The\r\nday and the hour were darkness, there were six other persons, and she\r\nhad been busy placing herself; but her consciousness had gone to him as\r\nstraight as if they had come together in some bright level of the\r\ndesert. They had on neither part a second\'s hesitation; they looked\r\nacross the choked compartment exactly as if she had known he would be\r\nthere and he had expected her to come in; so that, though in the\r\nconditions they could only exchange the greeting of movements, smiles,\r\nsilence, it would have been quite in the key of these passages that\r\nthey should have alighted for ease at the very next station. Kate was\r\nin fact sure that the very next station was the young man\'s true\r\ngoal--which made it clear that he was going on only from the wish to\r\nspeak to her. He had to go on, for this purpose, to High Street,\r\nKensington, as it was not till then that the exit of a passenger gave\r\nhim his chance.\r\n\r\nHis chance put him, however, in quick possession of the seat facing\r\nher, the alertness of his capture of which seemed to show her his\r\nimpatience. It helped them, moreover, with strangers on either side,\r\nlittle to talk; though this very restriction perhaps made such a mark\r\nfor them as nothing else could have done. If the fact that their\r\nopportunity had again come round for them could be so intensely\r\nexpressed between them without a word, they might very well feel on the\r\nspot that it had not come round for nothing. The extraordinary part of\r\nthe matter was that they were not in the least meeting where they had\r\nleft off, but ever so much further on, and that these added links added\r\nstill another between High Street and Notting Hill Gate, and then\r\nbetween the latter station and Queen\'s Road an extension really\r\ninordinate. At Notting Hill Gate, Kate\'s right-hand neighbour\r\ndescended, whereupon Densher popped straight into that seat; only there\r\nwas not much gained when a lady, the next instant, popped into\r\nDensher\'s. He could say almost nothing to her--she scarce knew, at\r\nleast, what he said; she was so occupied with a certainty that one of\r\nthe persons opposite, a youngish man with a single eyeglass, which he\r\nkept constantly in position, had made her out from the first as\r\nvisibly, as strangely affected. If such a person made her out, what\r\nthen did Densher do?--a question in truth sufficiently answered when,\r\non their reaching her station, he instantly followed her out of the\r\ntrain. That had been the real beginning--the beginning of everything\r\nelse; the other time, the time at the party, had been but the beginning\r\nof _that._ Never in life before had she so let herself go; for always\r\nbefore--so far as small adventures could have been in question for\r\nher--there had been, by the vulgar measure, more to go upon. He had\r\nwalked with her to Lancaster Gate, and then she had walked with him\r\naway from it--for all the world, she said to herself, like the\r\nhousemaid giggling to the baker.\r\n\r\nThis appearance, she was afterwards to feel, had been all in order for\r\na relation that might precisely best be described in the terms of the\r\nbaker and the housemaid. She could say to herself that from that hour\r\nthey had kept company; that had come to represent, technically\r\nspeaking, alike the range and the limit of their tie. He had on the\r\nspot, naturally, asked leave to call upon her--which, as a young person\r\nwho wasn\'t really young, who didn\'t pretend to be a sheltered flower,\r\nshe as rationally gave. That--she was promptly clear about it--was now\r\nher only possible basis; she was just the contemporary London female,\r\nhighly modern, inevitably battered, honourably free. She had of course\r\ntaken her aunt straight into her confidence--had gone through the form\r\nof asking her leave; and she subsequently remembered that though, on\r\nthis occasion, she had left the history of her new alliance as scant as\r\nthe facts themselves, Mrs. Lowder had struck her at the time\r\nsurprisingly mild. It had been, in every way, the occasion, full of the\r\nreminder that her hostess was deep: it was definitely then that she had\r\nbegun to ask herself what Aunt Maud was, in vulgar parlance, "up to."\r\n"You may receive, my dear, whom you like"--that was what Aunt Maud, who\r\nin general objected to people\'s doing as they liked, had replied; and\r\nit bore, this unexpectedness, a good deal of looking into. There were\r\nmany explanations, and they were all amusing--amusing, that is, in the\r\nline of the sombre and brooding amusement, cultivated by Kate in her\r\nactual high retreat. Merton Densher came the very next Sunday; but Mrs.\r\nLowder was so consistently magnanimous as to make it possible to her\r\nniece to see him alone. She saw him, however, on the Sunday following,\r\nin order to invite him to dinner; and when, after dining, he came\r\nagain--which he did three times, she found means to treat his visit as\r\npreponderantly to herself. Kate\'s conviction that she didn\'t like him\r\nmade that remarkable; it added to the evidence, by this time\r\nvoluminous, that she was remarkable all round. If she had been, in the\r\nway of energy, merely usual, she would have kept her dislike direct;\r\nwhereas it was now as if she were seeking to know him in order to see\r\nbest where to "have" him. That was one of the reflections made in our\r\nyoung woman\'s high retreat; she smiled from her lookout, in the silence\r\nthat was only the fact of hearing irrelevant sounds, as she caught the\r\ntruth that you could easily accept people when you wanted them so to be\r\ndelivered to you. When Aunt Maud wished them despatched, it was not to\r\nbe done by deputy; it was clearly always a matter reserved for her own\r\nhand. But what made the girl wonder most was the implications of so\r\nmuch diplomacy in respect to her own value. What view might she take of\r\nher position in the light of this appearance that her companion feared\r\nso, as yet, to upset her? It was as if Densher were accepted partly\r\nunder the dread that if he hadn\'t been she would act in resentment.\r\nHadn\'t her aunt considered the danger that she would in that case have\r\nbroken off, have seceded? The danger was exaggerated--she would have\r\ndone nothing so gross; but that, it seemed, was the way Mrs. Lowder saw\r\nher and believed her to be reckoned with. What importance therefore did\r\nshe really attach to her, what strange interest could she take on their\r\nkeeping on terms? Her father and her sister had their answer to\r\nthis--even without knowing how the question struck her; they saw the\r\nlady of Lancaster Gate as panting to make her fortune, and the\r\nexplanation of that appetite was that, on the accident of a nearer view\r\nthan she had before enjoyed, she had been charmed, been dazzled. They\r\napproved, they admired in her one of the belated fancies of rich,\r\ncapricious, violent old women--the more marked, moreover, because the\r\nresult of no plot; and they piled up the possible results for the\r\nperson concerned. Kate knew what to think of her own power thus to\r\ncarry by storm; she saw herself as handsome, no doubt, but as hard, and\r\nfelt herself as clever but as cold; and as so much too imperfectly\r\nambitious, furthermore, that it was a pity, for a quiet life, she\r\ncouldn\'t settle to be either finely or stupidly indifferent. Her\r\nintelligence sometimes kept her still--too still--but her want of it\r\nwas restless; so that she got the good, it seemed to her, of neither\r\nextreme. She saw herself at present, none the less, in a situation, and\r\neven her sad, disillusioned mother, dying, but with Aunt Maud\r\ninterviewing the nurse on the stairs, had not failed to remind her that\r\nit was of the essence of situations to be, under Providence, worked.\r\nThe dear woman had died in the belief that she was actually working the\r\none then produced.\r\n\r\nKate took one of her walks with Densher just after her visit to Mr.\r\nCroy; but most of it went, as usual, to their sitting in talk. They\r\nhad, under the trees, by the lake, the air of old friends--phases of\r\napparent earnestness, in particular, in which they might have been\r\nsettling every question in their vast young world; and periods of\r\nsilence, side by side, perhaps even more, when "a long engagement!"\r\nwould have been the final reading of the signs on the part of a passer\r\nstruck with them, as it was so easy to be. They would have presented\r\nthemselves thus as very old friends rather than as young persons who\r\nhad met for the first time but a year before and had spent most of the\r\ninterval without contact. It was indeed for each, already, as if they\r\nwere older friends; and though the succession of their meetings might,\r\nbetween them, have been straightened out, they only had a confused\r\nsense of a good many, very much alike, and a confused intention of a\r\ngood many more, as little different as possible. The desire to keep\r\nthem just as they were had perhaps to do with the fact that in spite of\r\nthe presumed diagnosis of the stranger there had been for them as yet\r\nno formal, no final understanding. Densher had at the very first\r\npressed the question, but that, it had been easy to reply, was too\r\nsoon; so that a singular thing had afterwards happened. They had\r\naccepted their acquaintance as too short for an engagement, but they\r\nhad treated it as long enough for almost anything else, and marriage\r\nwas somehow before them like a temple without an avenue. They belonged\r\nto the temple and they met in the grounds; they were in the stage at\r\nwhich grounds in general offered much scattered refreshment. But Kate\r\nhad meanwhile had so few confidants that she wondered at the source of\r\nher father\'s suspicions. The diffusion of rumour was of course, in\r\nLondon, remarkable, and for Marian not less--as Aunt Maud touched\r\nneither directly--the mystery had worked. No doubt she had been seen.\r\nOf course she had been seen. She had taken no trouble not to be seen,\r\nand it was a thing, clearly, she was incapable of taking. But she had\r\nbeen seen how?--and _what_ was there to see? She was in love--she knew\r\nthat: but it was wholly her own business, and she had the sense of\r\nhaving conducted herself, of still so doing, with almost violent\r\nconformity.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve an idea--in fact I feel sure--that Aunt Maud means to write to\r\nyou; and I think you had better know it." So much as this she said to\r\nhim as soon as they met, but immediately adding to it: "So as to make\r\nup your mind how to take her. I know pretty well what she\'ll say to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Then will you kindly tell me?"\r\n\r\nShe thought a little. "I can\'t do that. I should spoil it. She\'ll do\r\nthe best for her own idea."\r\n\r\n"Her idea, you mean, that I\'m a sort of a scoundrel; or, at the best,\r\nnot good enough for you?"\r\n\r\nThey were side by side again in their penny chairs, and Kate had\r\nanother pause. "Not good enough for _her."_\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see. And that\'s necessary."\r\n\r\nHe put it as a truth rather more than as a question; but there had been\r\nplenty of truths between them that each had contradicted. Kate,\r\nhowever, let this one sufficiently pass, only saying the next moment:\r\n"She has behaved extraordinarily."\r\n\r\n"And so have we," Densher declared. "I think, you know, we\'ve been\r\nawfully decent."\r\n\r\n"For ourselves, for each other, for people in general, yes. But not for\r\n_her._ For her," said Kate, "we\'ve been monstrous. She has been giving\r\nus rope. So if she does send for you," the girl repeated, "you must\r\nknow where you are."\r\n\r\n"That I always know. It\'s where _you_ are that concerns me."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Kate after an instant, "her idea of that is what you\'ll\r\nhave from her." He gave her a long look, and whatever else people who\r\nwouldn\'t let her alone might have wished, for her advancement, his long\r\nlooks were the thing in the world she could never have enough of. What\r\nshe felt was that, whatever might happen, she must keep them, must make\r\nthem most completely her possession; and it was already strange enough\r\nthat she reasoned, or at all events began to act, as if she might work\r\nthem in with other and alien things, privately cherish them, and yet,\r\nas regards the rigour of it, pay no price. She looked it well in the\r\nface, she took it intensely home, that they were lovers; she rejoiced\r\nto herself and, frankly, to him, in their wearing of the name; but,\r\ndistinguished creature that, in her way, she was, she took a view of\r\nthis character that scarce squared with the conventional. The character\r\nitself she insisted on as their right, taking that so for granted that\r\nit didn\'t seem even bold; but Densher, though he agreed with her, found\r\nhimself moved to wonder at her simplifications, her values. Life might\r\nprove difficult--was evidently going to; but meanwhile they had each\r\nother, and that was everything. This was her reasoning, but meanwhile,\r\nfor _him,_ each other was what they didn\'t have, and it was just the\r\npoint. Repeatedly, however, it was a point that, in the face of strange\r\nand special things, he judged it rather awkwardly gross to urge. It was\r\nimpossible to keep Mrs. Lowder out of their scheme. She stood there too\r\nclose to it and too solidly; it had to open a gate, at a given point,\r\ndo what they would to take her in. And she came in, always, while they\r\nsat together rather helplessly watching her, as in a coach-in-four; she\r\ndrove round their prospect as the principal lady at the circus drives\r\nround the ring, and she stopped the coach in the middle to alight with\r\nmajesty. It was our young man\'s sense that she was magnificently\r\nvulgar, but yet, quite, that this wasn\'t all. It wasn\'t with her\r\nvulgarity that she felt his want of means, though that might have\r\nhelped her richly to embroider it; nor was it with the same infirmity\r\nthat she was strong, original, dangerous.\r\n\r\nHis want of means--of means sufficient for anyone but himself--was\r\nreally the great ugliness, and was, moreover, at no time more ugly for\r\nhim than when it rose there, as it did seem to rise, shameless, face to\r\nface with the elements in Kate\'s life colloquially and conveniently\r\nclassed by both of them as funny. He sometimes indeed, for that matter,\r\nasked himself if these elements were as funny as the innermost fact, so\r\noften vivid to him, of his own consciousness--his private inability to\r\nbelieve he should ever be rich. His conviction on this head was in\r\ntruth quite positive and a thing by itself; he failed, after analysis,\r\nto understand it, though he had naturally more lights on it than any\r\none else. He knew how it subsisted in spite of an equal consciousness\r\nof his being neither mentally nor physically quite helpless, neither a\r\ndunce nor a cripple; he knew it to be absolute, though secret, and\r\nalso, strange to say, about common undertakings, not discouraging, not\r\nprohibitive. Only now was he having to think if it were prohibitive in\r\nrespect to marriage; only now, for the first time, had he to weigh his\r\ncase in scales. The scales, as he sat with Kate, often dangled in the\r\nline of his vision; he saw them, large and black, while he talked or\r\nlistened, take, in the bright air, singular positions. Sometimes the\r\nright was down and sometimes the left; never a happy equipoise--one or\r\nthe other always kicking the beam. Thus was kept before him the\r\nquestion of whether it were more ignoble to ask a woman to take her\r\nchance with you, or to accept it from one\'s conscience that her chance\r\ncould be at the best but one of the degrees of privation; whether, too,\r\notherwise, marrying for money mightn\'t after all be a smaller cause of\r\nshame than the mere dread of marrying without. Through these variations\r\nof mood and view, all the same, the mark on his forehead stood clear;\r\nhe saw himself remain without whether he married or not. It was a line\r\non which his fancy could be admirably active; the innumerable ways of\r\nmaking money were beautifully present to him; he could have handled\r\nthem, for his newspaper, as easily as he handled everything. He was\r\nquite aware how he handled everything; it was another mark on his\r\nforehead; the pair of smudges from the thumb of fortune, the brand on\r\nthe passive fleece, dated from the primal hour and kept each other\r\ncompany. He wrote, as for print, with deplorable ease; since there had\r\nbeen nothing to stop him even at the age of ten, so there was as little\r\nat twenty; it was part of his fate in the first place and part of the\r\nwretched public\'s in the second. The innumerable ways of making money\r\nwere, no doubt, at all events, what his imagination often was busy with\r\nafter he had tilted his chair and thrown back his head with his hands\r\nclasped behind it. What would most have prolonged that attitude,\r\nmoreover, was the reflection that the ways were ways only for others.\r\nWithin the minute, now--however this might be--he was aware of a nearer\r\nview than he had yet quite had of those circumstances on his\r\ncompanion\'s part that made least for simplicity of relation. He saw\r\nabove all how she saw them herself, for she spoke of them at present\r\nwith the last frankness, telling him of her visit to her father and\r\ngiving him, in an account of her subsequent scene with her sister, an\r\ninstance of how she was perpetually reduced to patching up, in one way\r\nor another, that unfortunate woman\'s hopes.\r\n\r\n"The tune," she exclaimed, "to which we\'re a failure as a family!" With\r\nwhich he had it again all from her--and this time, as it seemed to him,\r\nmore than all: the dishonour her father had brought them, his folly and\r\ncruelty and wickedness; the wounded state of her mother, abandoned,\r\ndespoiled and helpless, yet, for the management of such a home as\r\nremained to them, dreadfully unreasonable too; the extinction of her\r\ntwo young brothers--one, at nineteen, the eldest of the house, by\r\ntyphoid fever, contracted at a poisonous little place, as they had\r\nafterwards found out, that they had taken for a summer; the other, the\r\nflower of the flock, a middy on the _Britannia,_ dreadfully drowned,\r\nand not even by an accident at sea, but by cramp, unrescued, while\r\nbathing, too late in the autumn, in a wretched little river during a\r\nholiday visit to the home of a shipmate. Then Marian\'s unnatural\r\nmarriage, in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the other cheek to\r\nfortune: her actual wretchedness and plaintiveness, her greasy\r\nchildren, her impossible claims, her odious visitors--these things\r\ncompleted the proof of the heaviness, for them all, of the hand of\r\nfate. Kate confessedly described them with an excess of impatience; it\r\nwas much of her charm for Densher that she gave in general that turn to\r\nher descriptions, partly as if to amuse him by free and humorous\r\ncolour, partly--and that charm was the greatest--as if to work off, for\r\nher own relief, her constant perception of the incongruity of things.\r\nShe had seen the general show too early and too sharply, and she was so\r\nintelligent that she knew it and allowed for that misfortune; therefore\r\nwhen, in talk with him, she was violent and almost unfeminine, it was\r\nalmost as if they had settled, for intercourse, on the short cut of the\r\nfantastic and the happy language of exaggeration. It had come to be\r\ndefinite between them at a primary stage that, if they could have no\r\nother straight way, the realm of thought at least was open to them.\r\nThey could think whatever they liked about whatever they would--or, in\r\nother words, they could say it. Saying it for each other, for each\r\nother alone, only of course added to the taste. The implication was\r\nthereby constant that what they said when not together had no taste for\r\nthem at all, and nothing could have served more to launch them, at\r\nspecial hours, on their small floating island than such an assumption\r\nthat they were only making believe everywhere else. Our young man, it\r\nmust be added, was conscious enough that it was Kate who profited most\r\nby this particular play of the fact of intimacy. It always seemed to\r\nhim that she had more life than he to react from, and when she\r\nrecounted the dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard, odd\r\noffset of her present exaltation--since as exaltation it was apparently\r\nto be considered--he felt his own grey domestic annals to make little\r\nshow. It was naturally, in all such reference, the question of her\r\nfather\'s character that engaged him most, but her picture of her\r\nadventure in Chirk Street gave him a sense of how little as yet that\r\ncharacter was clear to him. What was it, to speak plainly, that Mr.\r\nCroy had originally done?\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--and I don\'t want to. I only know that years and years\r\nago--when I was about fifteen--something or other happened that made\r\nhim impossible. I mean impossible for the world at large first, and\r\nthen, little by little, for mother. We of course didn\'t know it at the\r\ntime," Kate explained, "but we knew it later; and it was, oddly enough,\r\nmy sister who first made out that he had done something. I can hear her\r\nnow--the way, one cold, black Sunday morning when, on account of an\r\nextraordinary fog, we had not gone to church, she broke it to me by the\r\nschool-room fire. I was reading a history-book by the lamp--when we\r\ndidn\'t go to church we had to read history-books--and I suddenly heard\r\nher say, out of the fog, which was in the room, and _apropos_ of\r\nnothing: \'Papa has done something wicked.\' And the curious thing was\r\nthat I believed it on the spot and have believed it ever since, though\r\nshe could tell me nothing more--neither what was the wickedness, nor\r\nhow she knew, nor what would happen to him, nor anything else about it.\r\nWe had our sense, always, that all sorts of things _had_ happened, were\r\nall the while happening, to him; so that when Marian only said she was\r\nsure, tremendously sure, that she had made it out for herself, but that\r\nthat was enough, I took her word for it--it seemed somehow so natural.\r\nWe were not, however, to ask mother--which made it more natural still,\r\nand I said never a word. But mother, strangely enough, spoke of it to\r\nme, in time, of her own accord very much later on. He hadn\'t been with\r\nus for ever so long, but we were used to that. She must have had some\r\nfear, some conviction that I had an idea, some idea of her own that it\r\nwas the best thing to do. She came out as abruptly as Marian had done:\r\n\'If you hear anything against your father--anything I mean, except that\r\nhe\'s odious and vile--remember it\'s perfectly false.\' That was the way\r\nI knew--it was true, though I recall that I said to her then that I of\r\ncourse knew it wasn\'t. She might have told me it was true, and yet have\r\ntrusted me to contradict fiercely enough any accusation of him that I\r\nshould meet--to contradict it much more fiercely and effectively, I\r\nthink, than she would have done herself. As it happens, however," the\r\ngirl went on, "I\'ve never had occasion, and I\'ve been conscious of it\r\nwith a sort of surprise. It has made the world, at times, seem more\r\ndecent. No one has so much as breathed to me. That has been a part of\r\nthe silence, the silence that surrounds him, the silence that, for the\r\nworld, has washed him out. He doesn\'t exist for people. And yet I\'m as\r\nsure as ever. In fact, though I know no more than I did then, I\'m more\r\nsure. And that," she wound up, "is what I sit here and tell you about\r\nmy own father. If you don\'t call it a proof of confidence I don\'t know\r\nwhat will satisfy you."\r\n\r\n"It satisfies me beautifully," Densher declared, "but it doesn\'t, my\r\ndear child, very greatly enlighten me. You don\'t, you know, really tell\r\nme anything. It\'s so vague that what am I to think but that you may\r\nvery well be mistaken? What has he done, if no one can name it?"\r\n\r\n"He has done everything."\r\n\r\n"Oh--everything! Everything\'s nothing."\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Kate, "he has done some particular thing. It\'s\r\nknown--only, thank God, not to us. But it has been the end of him. You\r\ncould doubtless find out with a little trouble. You can ask about."\r\n\r\nDensher for a moment said nothing; but the next moment he made it up.\r\n"I wouldn\'t find out for the world, and I\'d rather lose my tongue than\r\nput a question."\r\n\r\n"And yet it\'s a part of me," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"A part of you?"\r\n\r\n"My father\'s dishonour." Then she sounded for him, but more deeply than\r\never yet, her note of proud, still pessimism. "How can such a thing as\r\nthat not be the great thing in one\'s life?"\r\n\r\nShe had to take from him again, on this, one of his long looks, and she\r\ntook it to its deepest, its headiest dregs. "I shall ask you, for the\r\ngreat thing in your life," he said, "to depend on _me_ a little more."\r\nAfter which, just hesitating, "Doesn\'t he belong to some club?" he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nShe had a grave headshake. "He used to--to many."\r\n\r\n"But he has dropped them?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve dropped _him._ Of that I\'m sure. It ought to do for you. I\r\noffered him," the girl immediately continued--"and it was for that I\r\nwent to him--to come and be with him, make a home for him so far as is\r\npossible. But he won\'t hear of it."\r\n\r\nDensher took this in with visible, but generous, wonder. "You offered\r\nhim--\'impossible\' as you describe him to me--to live with him and share\r\nhis disadvantages?" The young man saw for the moment but the high\r\nbeauty of it. "You _are_ gallant!"\r\n\r\n"Because it strikes you as being brave for him?" She wouldn\'t in the\r\nleast have this. "It wasn\'t courage--it was the opposite. I did it to\r\nsave myself--to escape."\r\n\r\nHe had his air, so constant at this stage, as of her giving him finer\r\nthings than any one to think about. "Escape from what?"\r\n\r\n"From everything."\r\n\r\n"Do you by any chance mean from me?"\r\n\r\n"No; I spoke to him of you, told him--or what amounted to it--that I\r\nwould bring you, if he would allow it, with me."\r\n\r\n"But he won\'t allow it," said Densher.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t hear of it on any terms. He won\'t help me, won\'t save me, won\'t\r\nhold out a finger to me," Kate went on; "he simply wriggles away, in\r\nhis inimitable manner, and throws me back."\r\n\r\n"Back then, after all, thank goodness," Densher concurred, "on me."\r\n\r\nBut she spoke again as with the sole vision of the whole scene she had\r\nevoked. "It\'s a pity, because you\'d like him. He\'s wonderful--he\'s\r\ncharming." Her companion gave one of the laughs that marked in him,\r\nagain, his feeling in her tone, inveterately, something that banished\r\nthe talk of other women, so far as he knew other women, to the dull\r\ndesert of the conventional, and she had already continued. "He would\r\nmake himself delightful to you."\r\n\r\n"Even while objecting to me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he likes to please," the girl explained--"personally. He would\r\nappreciate you and be clever with you. It\'s to _me_ he objects--that is\r\nas to my liking you."\r\n\r\n"Heaven be praised then," Densher exclaimed, "that you like me enough\r\nfor the objection!"\r\n\r\nBut she met it after an instant with some inconsequence. "I don\'t. I\r\noffered to give you up, if necessary, to go to him. But it made no\r\ndifference, and that\'s what I mean," she pursued, "by his declining me\r\non any terms. The point is, you see, that I don\'t escape."\r\n\r\nDensher wondered. "But if you didn\'t wish to escape _me?"_\r\n\r\n"I wished to escape Aunt Maud. But he insists that it\'s through her and\r\nthrough her only that I may help him; just as Marian insists that it\'s\r\nthrough her, and through her only, that I can help _her._ That\'s what I\r\nmean," she again explained, "by their turning me back."\r\n\r\nThe young man thought. "Your sister turns you back too?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, with a push!"\r\n\r\n"But have you offered to live with your sister?"\r\n\r\n"I would in a moment if she\'d have me. That\'s all my virtue--a narrow\r\nlittle family feeling. I\'ve a small stupid piety--I don\'t know what to\r\ncall it." Kate bravely sustained it; she made it out. "Sometimes,\r\nalone, I\'ve to smother my shrieks when I think of my poor mother. She\r\nwent through things--they pulled her down; I know what they were now--I\r\ndidn\'t then, for I was a pig; and my position, compared with hers, is\r\nan insolence of success. That\'s what Marian keeps before me; that\'s\r\nwhat papa himself, as I say, so inimitably does. My position\'s a value,\r\na great value, for them both"--she followed and followed. Lucid and\r\nironic, she knew no merciful muddle. "It\'s _the_ value--the only one\r\nthey have."\r\n\r\nEverything between our young couple moved today, in spite of their\r\npauses, their margin, to a quicker measure--the quickness and anxiety\r\nplaying lightning-like in the sultriness. Densher watched, decidedly,\r\nas he had never done before. "And the fact you speak of holds you!"\r\n\r\n"Of course, it holds me. It\'s a perpetual sound in my ears. It makes me\r\nask myself if I\'ve any right to personal happiness, any right to\r\nanything but to be as rich and overflowing, as smart and shining, as I\r\ncan be made."\r\n\r\nDensher had a pause. "Oh, you might, with good luck, have the personal\r\nhappiness too."\r\n\r\nHer immediate answer to this was a silence like his own; after which\r\nshe gave him straight in the face, but quite simply and quietly:\r\n"Darling!"\r\n\r\nIt took him another moment; then he was also quiet and simple. "Will\r\nyou settle it by our being married to-morrow--as we can, with perfect\r\nease, civilly?"\r\n\r\n"Let us wait to arrange it," Kate presently replied, "till after you\'ve\r\nseen her."\r\n\r\n"Do you call that adoring me?" Densher demanded.\r\n\r\nThey were talking, for the time, with the strangest mixture of\r\ndeliberation and directness, and nothing could have been more in the\r\ntone of it than the way she at last said: "You\'re afraid of her\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nHe gave a smile a trifle glassy. "For young persons of a great\r\ndistinction and a very high spirit, we\'re a caution!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she took it straight up; "we\'re hideously intelligent. But\r\nthere\'s fun in it too. We must get our fun where we can. I think," she\r\nadded, and for that matter, not without courage, "our relation\'s\r\nbeautiful. It\'s not a bit vulgar. I cling to some saving romance in\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nIt made him break into a laugh which had more freedom than his smile.\r\n"How you must be afraid you\'ll chuck me!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, _that_ would be vulgar. But, of course, I do see my danger,"\r\nshe admitted, "of doing something base."\r\n\r\n"Then what can be so base as sacrificing me?"\r\n\r\n"I _shan\'t_ sacrifice you; don\'t cry out till you\'re hurt. I shall\r\nsacrifice nobody and nothing, and that\'s just my situation, that I want\r\nand that I shall try for everything. That," she wound up, "is how I see\r\nmyself, and how I see you quite as much, acting for them."\r\n\r\n"For \'them\'?" and the young man strongly, extravagantly marked his\r\ncoldness. "Thank you!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you care for them?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I? What are they to me but a serious nuisance?"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had permitted himself this qualification of the\r\nunfortunate persons she so perversely cherished, he repented of his\r\nroughness--and partly because he expected a flash from her. But it was\r\none of her finest sides that she sometimes flashed with a mere mild\r\nglow. "I don\'t see why you don\'t make out a little more that if we\r\navoid stupidity we may do _all._ We may keep her."\r\n\r\nHe stared. "Make her pension us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, wait at least till we have seen."\r\n\r\nHe thought. "Seen what can be got out of her?"\r\n\r\nKate for a moment said nothing. "After all I never asked her; never,\r\nwhen our troubles were at the worst, appealed to her nor went near her.\r\nShe fixed upon me herself, settled on me with her wonderful gilded\r\nclaws."\r\n\r\n"You speak," Densher observed, "as if she were a vulture."\r\n\r\n"Call it an eagle--with a gilded beak as well, and with wings for great\r\nflights. If she\'s a thing of the air, in short--say at once a\r\nballoon--I never myself got into her car. I was her choice."\r\n\r\nIt had really, her sketch of the affair, a high colour and a great\r\nstyle; at all of which he gazed a minute as at a picture by a master.\r\n"What she must see in you!"\r\n\r\n"Wonders!" And, speaking it loud, she stood straight up. "Everything.\r\nThere it is."\r\n\r\nYes, there it was, and as she remained before him he continued to face\r\nit. "So that what you mean is that I\'m to do my part in somehow\r\nsquaring her?"\r\n\r\n"See her, see her," Kate said with impatience.\r\n\r\n"And grovel to her?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, do what you like!" And she walked in her impatience away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHis eyes had followed her at this time quite long enough, before he\r\novertook her, to make out more than ever, in the poise of her head, the\r\npride of her step--he didn\'t know what best to call it--a part, at\r\nleast, of Mrs. Lowder\'s reasons. He consciously winced while he figured\r\nhis presenting himself as a reason opposed to these; though, at the\r\nsame moment, with the source of Aunt Maud\'s inspiration thus before\r\nhim, he was prepared to conform, by almost any abject attitude or\r\nprofitable compromise, to his companion\'s easy injunction. He would do\r\nas _she_ liked--his own liking might come off as it would. He would\r\nhelp her to the utmost of his power; for, all the rest of that day and\r\nthe next, her easy injunction, tossed off that way as she turned her\r\nbeautiful back, was like the crack of a great whip in the blue air, the\r\nhigh element in which Mrs. Lowder hung. He wouldn\'t grovel perhaps--he\r\nwasn\'t quite ready for that; but he would be patient, ridiculous,\r\nreasonable, unreasonable, and above all deeply diplomatic. He would be\r\nclever, with all his cleverness--which he now shook hard, as he\r\nsometimes shook his poor, dear, shabby, old watch, to start it up\r\nagain. It wasn\'t, thank goodness, as if there weren\'t plenty of that,\r\nand with what they could muster between them it would be little to the\r\ncredit of their star, however pale, that defeat and\r\nsurrender--surrender so early, so immediate--should have to ensue. It\r\nwas not indeed that he thought of that disaster as, at the worst, a\r\ndirect sacrifice of their possibilities: he imaged--it which was enough\r\nas some proved vanity, some exposed fatuity, in the idea of bringing\r\nMrs. Lowder round. When, shortly afterwards, in this lady\'s vast\r\ndrawing-room--the apartments at Lancaster Gate had struck him from the\r\nfirst as of prodigious extent--he awaited her, at her request, conveyed\r\nin a "reply-paid" telegram, his theory was that of their still clinging\r\nto their idea, though with a sense of the difficulty of it really\r\nenlarged to the scale of the place.\r\n\r\nHe had the place for a long time--it seemed to him a quarter of an\r\nhour--to himself; and while Aunt Maud kept him and kept him, while\r\nobservation and reflection crowded on him, he asked himself what was to\r\nbe expected of a person who could treat one like that. The visit, the\r\nhour were of her own proposing, so that her delay, no doubt, was but\r\npart of a general plan of putting him to inconvenience. As he walked to\r\nand fro, however, taking in the message of her massive, florid\r\nfurniture, the immense expression of her signs and symbols, he had as\r\nlittle doubt of the inconvenience he was prepared to suffer. He found\r\nhimself even facing the thought that he had nothing to fall back on,\r\nand that that was as great a humiliation in a good cause as a proud man\r\ncould desire. It had not yet been so distinct to him that he made no\r\nshow--literally not the smallest; so complete a show seemed made there\r\nall about him; so almost abnormally affirmative, so aggressively erect,\r\nwere the huge, heavy objects that syllabled his hostess story. "When\r\nall\'s said and done, you know, she\'s colossally vulgar"--he had once\r\nall but said that of Mrs. Lowder to her niece; only just keeping it\r\nback at the last, keeping it to himself with all its danger about it.\r\nIt mattered because it bore so directly, and he at all events quite\r\nfelt it a thing that Kate herself would some day bring out to him. It\r\nbore directly at present, and really all the more that somehow,\r\nstrangely, it didn\'t in the least imply that Aunt Maud was dull or\r\nstale. She was vulgar with freshness, almost with beauty, since there\r\nwas beauty, to a degree, in the play of so big and bold a temperament.\r\nShe was in fine quite the largest possible quantity to deal with; and\r\nhe was in the cage of the lioness without his whip--the whip, in a\r\nword, of a supply of proper retorts. He had no retort but that he loved\r\nthe girl--which in such a house as that was painfully cheap. Kate had\r\nmentioned to him more than once that her aunt was Passionate, speaking\r\nof it as a kind of offset and uttering it as with a capital P, marking\r\nit as something that he might, that he in fact ought to, turn about in\r\nsome way to their advantage. He wondered at this hour to what advantage\r\nhe could turn it; but the case grew less simple the longer he waited.\r\nDecidedly there was something he hadn\'t enough of. He stood as one fast.\r\n\r\nHis slow march to and fro seemed to give him the very measure; as he\r\npaced and paced the distance it became the desert of his poverty; at\r\nthe sight of which expanse moreover he could pretend to himself as\r\nlittle as before that the desert looked redeemable. Lancaster Gate\r\nlooked rich--that was all the effect; which it was unthinkable that any\r\nstate of his own should ever remotely resemble. He read more vividly,\r\nmore critically, as has been hinted, the appearances about him; and\r\nthey did nothing so much as make him wonder at his aesthetic reaction.\r\nHe hadn\'t known--and in spite of Kate\'s repeated reference to her own\r\nrebellions of taste--that he should "mind" so much how an independent\r\nlady might decorate her house. It was the language of the house itself\r\nthat spoke to him, writing out for him, with surpassing breadth and\r\nfreedom, the associations and conceptions, the ideals and possibilities\r\nof the mistress. Never, he flattered himself, had he seen anything so\r\ngregariously ugly--operatively, ominously so cruel. He was glad to have\r\nfound this last name for the whole character; "cruel" somehow played\r\ninto the subject for an article--that his impression put straight into\r\nhis mind. He would write about the heavy horrors that could still\r\nflourish, that lifted their undiminished heads, in an age so proud of\r\nits short way with false gods; and it would be funny if what he should\r\nhave got from Mrs. Lowder were to prove, after all, but a small amount\r\nof copy. Yet the great thing, really the dark thing, was that, even\r\nwhile he thought of the quick column he might add up, he felt it less\r\neasy to laugh at the heavy horrors than to quail before them. He\r\ncouldn\'t describe and dismiss them collectively, call them either\r\nMid-Victorian or Early; not being at all sure they were rangeable under\r\none rubric. It was only manifest they were splendid and were\r\nfurthermore conclusively British. They constituted an order and they\r\nabounded in rare material--precious woods, metals, stuffs, stones. He\r\nhad never dreamed of anything so fringed and scalloped, so buttoned and\r\ncorded, drawn everywhere so tight, and curled everywhere so thick. He\r\nhad never dreamed of so much gilt and glass, so much satin and plush,\r\nso much rosewood and marble and malachite. But it was, above all, the\r\nsolid forms, the wasted finish, the misguided cost, the general\r\nattestation of morality and money, a good conscience and a big balance.\r\nThese things finally represented for him a portentous negation of his\r\nown world of thought--of which, for that matter, in the presence of\r\nthem, he became as for the first time hopelessly aware. They revealed\r\nit to him by their merciless difference. His interview with Aunt Maud,\r\nnone the less, took by no means the turn he had expected. Passionate\r\nthough her nature, no doubt Mrs. Lowder, on this occasion, neither\r\nthreatened nor appealed. Her arms of aggression, her weapons of\r\ndefence, were presumably close at hand, but she left them untouched and\r\nunmentioned, and was in fact so bland that he properly perceived only\r\nafterwards how adroit she had been. He properly perceived something\r\nelse as well, which complicated his case; he shouldn\'t have known what\r\nto call it if he hadn\'t called it her really imprudent good-nature. Her\r\nblandness, in other words, was not mere policy--he wasn\'t dangerous\r\nenough for policy; it was the result, he could see, of her fairly\r\nliking him a little. From the moment she did that she herself became\r\nmore interesting; and who knew what might happen should he take to\r\nliking _her?_ Well, it was a risk he naturally must face. She fought\r\nhim, at any rate, but with one hand, with a few loose grains of stray\r\npowder. He recognised at the end of ten minutes, and even without her\r\nexplaining it, that if she had made him wait it had not been to wound\r\nhim; they had by that time almost directly met on the fact of her\r\nintention. She had wanted him to think for himself of what she proposed\r\nto say to him--not having otherwise announced it; wanted to let it come\r\nhome to him on the spot, as she had shrewdly believed it would. Her\r\nfirst question, on appearing, had practically been as to whether he\r\nhadn\'t taken her hint, and this inquiry assumed so many things that it\r\nmade discussion, immediately, frank and large. He knew, with the\r\nquestion put, that the hint was just what he _had_ taken; knew that she\r\nhad made him quickly forgive her the display of her power; knew that if\r\nhe didn\'t take care he should understand her, and the strength of her\r\npurpose, to say nothing of that of her imagination, nothing of the\r\nlength of her purse, only too well. Yet he pulled himself up with the\r\nthought, too, that he was not going to be afraid of understanding her;\r\nhe was just going to understand and understand without detriment to the\r\nfeeblest, even, of his passions. The play of one\'s mind let one in, at\r\nthe best, dreadfully, in action, in the need of action, where\r\nsimplicity was all; but when one couldn\'t prevent it the thing was to\r\nmake it complete. There would never be mistakes but for the original\r\nfun of mistakes. What he must use his fatal intelligence for was to\r\nresist. Mrs. Lowder, meanwhile, might use it for whatever she liked.\r\n\r\nIt was after she had begun her statement of her own idea about Kate\r\nthat he began, on his side, to reflect that--with her manner of\r\noffering it as really sufficient if he would take the trouble to\r\nembrace--it she couldn\'t half hate him. That was all, positively, she\r\nseemed to show herself for the time as attempting; clearly, if she did\r\nher intention justice, she would have nothing more disagreeable to do.\r\n"If I hadn\'t been ready to go very much further, you understand, I\r\nwouldn\'t have gone so far. I don\'t care what you repeat to her--the\r\nmore you repeat to her, perhaps the better; and, at any rate, there\'s\r\nnothing she doesn\'t already know. I don\'t say it for her; I say it for\r\nyou--when I want to reach my niece I know how to do it straight." So\r\nAunt Maud delivered herself--as with homely benevolence, in the\r\nsimplest, but the clearest terms; virtually conveying that, though a\r\nword to the wise was, doubtless, in spite of the advantage, _not_\r\nalways enough, a word to the good could never fail to be. The sense our\r\nyoung man read into her words was that she liked him because he was\r\ngood--was really, by her measure, good enough: good enough, that is, to\r\ngive up her niece for her and go his way in peace. But _was_ he good\r\nenough--by his own measure? He fairly wondered, while she more fully\r\nexpressed herself, if it might be his doom to prove so. "She\'s the\r\nfinest possible creature--of course you flatter yourself that you know\r\nit. But I know it, quite as well as you possibly can--by which I mean a\r\ngood deal better yet; and the tune to which I\'m ready to prove my faith\r\ncompares favourably enough, I think, with anything _you_ can do. I\r\ndon\'t say it because she\'s my niece--that\'s nothing to me: I might have\r\nhad fifty nieces, and I wouldn\'t have brought one of them to this place\r\nif I hadn\'t found her to my taste. I don\'t say I wouldn\'t have done\r\nsomething else, but I wouldn\'t have put up with her presence. Kate\'s\r\npresence, by good fortune, I marked early; Kate\'s presence--unluckily\r\nfor _you_--is everything I could possibly wish; Kate\'s presence is, in\r\nshort, as fine as you know, and I\'ve been keeping it for the comfort of\r\nmy declining years. I\'ve watched it long; I\'ve been saving it up and\r\nletting it, as you say of investments, appreciate, and you may judge\r\nwhether, now it has begun to pay so, I\'m likely to consent to treat for\r\nit with any but a high bidder. I can do the best with her, and I\'ve my\r\nidea of the best."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I quite conceive," said Densher, "that your idea of the best isn\'t\r\nme."\r\n\r\nIt was an oddity of Mrs. Lowder\'s that her face in speech was like a\r\nlighted window at night, but that silence immediately drew the curtain.\r\nThe occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never easy to take;\r\nyet she was still less easy to interrupt. The great glaze of her\r\nsurface, at all events, gave her visitor no present help. "I didn\'t ask\r\nyou to come to hear what it isn\'t--I asked you to come to hear what it\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"Of course," Densher laughed, "it\'s very great indeed."\r\n\r\nHis hostess went on as if his contribution to the subject were barely\r\nrelevant. "I want to see her high, high up--high up and in the light."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you naturally want to marry her to a duke, and are eager to smooth\r\naway any hitch."\r\n\r\nShe gave him so, on this, the mere effect of the drawn blind that it\r\nquite forced him, at first, into the sense, possibly just, of having\r\naffected her as flippant, perhaps even as low. He had been looked at\r\nso, in blighted moments of presumptuous youth, by big cold public men,\r\nbut never, so far as he could recall, by any private lady. More than\r\nanything yet it gave him the measure of his companion\'s subtlety, and\r\nthereby of Kate\'s possible career. "Don\'t be _too_ impossible!"--he\r\nfeared from his friend, for a moment, some such answer as that; and\r\nthen felt, as she spoke otherwise, as if she were letting him off\r\neasily. "I want her to marry a great man." That was all; but, more and\r\nmore, it was enough; and if it hadn\'t been her next words would have\r\nmade it so. "And I think of her what I think. There you are."\r\n\r\nThey sat for a little face to face upon it, and he was conscious of\r\nsomething deeper still, of something she wished him to understand if he\r\nonly would. To that extent she did appeal--appealed to the intelligence\r\nshe desired to show she believed him to possess. He was meanwhile, at\r\nall events, not the man wholly to fail of comprehension. "Of course I\'m\r\naware how little I can answer to any fond, proud dream. You\'ve a\r\nview--a magnificent one; into which I perfectly enter. I thoroughly\r\nunderstand what I\'m not, and I\'m much obliged to you for not reminding\r\nme of it in any rougher way." She said nothing--she kept that up; it\r\nmight even have been to let him go further, if he was capable of it, in\r\nthe way of poorness of spirit. It was one of those cases in which a man\r\ncouldn\'t show, if he showed at all, save for poor; unless indeed he\r\npreferred to show for asinine. It was the plain truth: he _was_--on\r\nMrs. Lowder\'s basis, the only one in question--a very small quantity,\r\nand he did know, damnably, what made quantities large. He desired to be\r\nperfectly simple; yet in the midst of that effort a deeper apprehension\r\nthrobbed. Aunt Maud clearly conveyed it, though he couldn\'t later on\r\nhave said how. "You don\'t really matter, I believe, so much as you\r\nthink, and I\'m not going to make you a martyr by banishing you. Your\r\nperformances with Kate in the Park are ridiculous so far as they\'re\r\nmeant as consideration for me; and I had much rather see you\r\nmyself--since you\'re, in your way, my dear young man, delightful--and\r\narrange with you, count with you, as I easily, as I perfectly should.\r\nDo you suppose me so stupid as to quarrel with you if it\'s not really\r\nnecessary? It won\'t--it would be too absurd!--_be_ necessary. I can\r\nbite your head off any day, any day I really open my mouth; and I\'m\r\ndealing with you now, see--and successfully judge--without opening it.\r\nI do things handsomely all round--I place you in the presence of the\r\nplan with which, from the moment it\'s a case of taking you seriously,\r\nyou\'re incompatible. Come then as near it as you like, walk all round\r\nit--don\'t be afraid you\'ll hurt it!--and live on with it before you."\r\n\r\nHe afterwards felt that if she hadn\'t absolutely phrased all this it\r\nwas because she so soon made him out as going with her far enough. He\r\nwas so pleasantly affected by her asking no promise of him, her not\r\nproposing he should pay for her indulgence by his word of honour not to\r\ninterfere, that he gave her a kind of general assurance of esteem.\r\nImmediately afterwards, then, he spoke of these things to Kate, and\r\nwhat then came back to him first of all was the way he had said to\r\nher--he mentioned it to the girl--very much as one of a pair of lovers\r\nsays in a rupture by mutual consent: "I hope immensely, of course, that\r\nyou\'ll always regard me as a friend." This had perhaps been going\r\nfar--he submitted it all to Kate; but really there had been so much in\r\nit that it was to be looked at, as they might say, wholly in its own\r\nlight. Other things than those we have presented had come up before the\r\nclose of his scene with Aunt Maud, but this matter of her not treating\r\nhim as a peril of the first order easily predominated. There was\r\nmoreover plenty to talk about on the occasion of his subsequent passage\r\nwith our young woman, it having been put to him abruptly, the night\r\nbefore, that he might give himself a lift and do his newspaper a\r\nservice--so flatteringly was the case expressed--by going, for fifteen\r\nor twenty weeks, to America. The idea of a series of letters from the\r\nUnited States from the strictly social point of view had for some time\r\nbeen nursed in the inner sanctuary at whose door he sat, and the moment\r\nwas now deemed happy for letting it loose. The imprisoned thought had,\r\nin a word, on the opening of the door, flown straight out into\r\nDensher\'s face, or perched at least on his shoulder, making him look up\r\nin surprise from his mere inky office-table. His account of the matter\r\nto Kate was that he couldn\'t refuse--not being in a position, as yet,\r\nto refuse anything; but that his being chosen for such an errand\r\nconfounded his sense of proportion. He was definite as to his scarce\r\nknowing how to measure the honour, which struck him as equivocal; he\r\nhad not quite supposed himself the man for the class of job. This\r\nconfused consciousness, he intimated, he had promptly enough betrayed\r\nto his manager; with the effect, however, of seeing the question\r\nsurprisingly clear up. What it came to was that the sort of twaddle\r\nthat was not in his chords was, unexpectedly, just what they happened\r\nthis time not to want. They wanted his letters, for queer reasons,\r\nabout as good as he could let them come; he was to play his own little\r\ntune and not be afraid; that was the whole point.\r\n\r\nIt would have been the whole, that is, had there not been a sharper one\r\nstill in the circumstance that he was to start at once. His mission, as\r\nthey called it at the office, would probably be over by the end of\r\nJune, which was desirable; but to bring that about he must now not lose\r\na week; his inquiries, he understood, were to cover the whole ground,\r\nand there were reasons of State--reasons operating at the seat of\r\nempire in Fleet Street--why the nail should be struck on the head.\r\nDensher made no secret to Kate of his having asked for a day to decide;\r\nand his account of that matter was that he felt he owed it to her to\r\nspeak to her first. She assured him on this that nothing so much as\r\nthat scruple had yet shown her how they were bound together; she was\r\nclearly proud of his letting a thing of such importance depend on her;\r\nbut she was clearer still as to his instant duty. She rejoiced in his\r\nprospect and urged him to his task; she should miss him intensely--of\r\ncourse she should miss him; but she made so little of it that she spoke\r\nwith jubilation of what he would see and would do. She made so much of\r\nthis last quantity that he laughed at her innocence, though also with\r\nscarce the heart to give her the real size of his drop in the daily\r\nbucket. He was struck at the same time with her happy grasp of what had\r\nreally occurred in Fleet Street--all the more that it was his own final\r\nreading. He was to pull the subject up--that was just what they wanted;\r\nand it would take more than all the United States together, visit them\r\neach as he might, to let _him_ down. It was just because he didn\'t nose\r\nabout and wasn\'t the usual gossipmonger that they had picked him out;\r\nit was a branch of their correspondence with which they evidently\r\nwished a new tone associated, such a tone as, from now on, it would\r\nhave always to take from his example.\r\n\r\n"How you ought indeed, when you understand so well, to be a\r\njournalist\'s wife!" Densher exclaimed in admiration, even while she\r\nstruck him as fairly hurrying him off.\r\n\r\nBut she was almost impatient of the praise. "What do you expect one\r\n_not_ to understand when one cares for you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah then, I\'ll put it otherwise and say \'How much you care for me!\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she assented; "it fairly redeems my stupidity. I _shall,_ with a\r\nchance to show it," she added, "have some imagination for you."\r\n\r\nShe spoke of the future this time as so little contingent, that he felt\r\na queerness of conscience in making her the report that he presently\r\narrived at on what had passed for him with the real arbiter of their\r\ndestiny. The way for that had been blocked a little by his news from\r\nFleet Street; but in the crucible of their happy discussion this\r\nelement soon melted into the other, and in the mixture that ensued the\r\nparts were not to be distinguished. The young man moreover, before\r\ntaking his leave, was to see why Kate had just spoken of the future as\r\nif they now really possessed it, and was to come to the vision by a\r\ndevious way that deepened the final cheer. Their faces were turned to\r\nthe illumined quarter as soon as he had answered her question in\r\nrespect to the appearance of their being able to play a waiting game\r\nwith success. It was for the possibility of that appearance that she\r\nhad, a few days before, so earnestly pressed him to see her aunt; and\r\nif after his hour with that lady it had not struck Densher that he had\r\nseen her to the happiest purpose the poor facts flushed with a better\r\nmeaning as Kate, one by one, took them up.\r\n\r\n"If she consents to your coming, why isn\'t that everything?"\r\n\r\n"It _is_ everything; everything _she_ thinks it. It\'s the\r\nprobability--I mean as Mrs. Lowder measures probability--that I may be\r\nprevented from becoming a complication for her by some arrangement,\r\n_any_ arrangement, through which you shall see me often and easily.\r\nShe\'s sure of my want of money, and that gives her time. She believes\r\nin my having a certain amount of delicacy, in my wishing to better my\r\nstate before I put the pistol to your head in respect to sharing it.\r\nThe time that will take figures for her as the time that will help her\r\nif she doesn\'t spoil her chance by treating me badly. She doesn\'t at\r\nall wish moreover," Densher went on, "to treat me badly, for I believe,\r\nupon my honour, funny as it may sound to you, that she personally\r\nrather likes me, and that if you weren\'t in question I might almost\r\nbecome her pet young man. She doesn\'t disparage intellect and\r\nculture--quite the contrary; she wants them to adorn her board and be\r\nnamed in her programme; and I\'m sure it has sometimes cost her a real\r\npang that I should be so desirable, at once, and so impossible." He\r\npaused a moment, and his companion then saw that a strange smile was in\r\nhis face--a smile as strange even as the adjunct, in her own, of this\r\ninforming vision. "I quite suspect her of believing that, if the truth\r\nwere known, she likes me literally better than--deep down--you yourself\r\ndo: wherefore she does me the honour to think that I may be safely left\r\nto kill my own cause. There, as I say, comes in her margin. I\'m not the\r\nsort of stuff of romance that wears, that washes, that survives use,\r\nthat resists familiarity. Once in any degree admit that, and your pride\r\nand prejudice will take care of the rest! the pride fed full,\r\nmeanwhile, by the system she means to practise with you, and the\r\nprejudice excited by the comparison she\'ll enable you to make, from\r\nwhich I shall come off badly. She likes me, but she\'ll never like me so\r\nmuch as when she succeeded a little better in making me look wretched.\r\nFor then _you\'ll_ like me less."\r\n\r\nKate showed for this evocation a due interest, but no alarm; and it was\r\na little as if to pay his tender cynicism back in kind that she after\r\nan instant replied: "I see, I see; what an immense affair she must\r\nthink me! One was aware, but you deepen the impression."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ll make no mistake," said Densher, "in letting it go as\r\ndeep as it will."\r\n\r\nHe had given her indeed, she made no scruple of showing, plenty to\r\nconsider. "Her facing the music, her making you boldly as welcome as\r\nyou say--that\'s an awfully big theory, you know, and worthy of all the\r\nother big things that, in one\'s acquaintance with people, give her a\r\nplace so apart."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s grand," the young man conceded; "she\'s on the scale,\r\naltogether, of the car of Juggernaut which was a kind of image that\r\ncame to me yesterday while I waited for her at Lancaster Gate. The\r\nthings in your drawing-room there were like the forms of the strange\r\nidols, the mystic excrescences, with which one may suppose the front of\r\nthe car to bristle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, aren\'t they?" the girl returned; and they had, over all that\r\naspect of their wonderful lady, one of those deep and free interchanges\r\nthat made everything but confidence a false note for them. There were\r\ncomplications, there were questions; but they were so much more\r\ntogether than they were anything else. Kate uttered for a while no word\r\nof refutation of Aunt Maud\'s "big" diplomacy, and they left it there,\r\nas they would have left any other fine product, for a monument to her\r\npowers. But, Densher related further, he had had in other respects too\r\nthe car of Juggernaut to face; he omitted nothing from his account of\r\nhis visit, least of all the way Aunt Maud had frankly at last--though\r\nindeed only under artful pressure--fallen foul of his very type, his\r\nwant of the right marks, his foreign accidents, his queer antecedents.\r\nShe had told him he was but half a Briton, which, he granted Kate,\r\nwould have been dreadful if he hadn\'t so let himself in for it.\r\n\r\n"I was really curious, you see," he explained, "to find out from her\r\nwhat sort of queer creature, what sort of social anomaly, in the light\r\nof such conventions as hers, such an education as mine makes one pass\r\nfor."\r\n\r\nKate said nothing for a little; but then, "Why should you care?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he laughed, "I like her so much; and then, for a man of my trade,\r\nher views, her spirit, are essentially a thing to get hold of; they\r\nbelong to the great public mind that we meet at every turn and that we\r\nmust keep setting up \'codes\' with. Besides," he added, "I want to\r\nplease her personally."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, we must please her personally!" his companion echoed; and the\r\nwords may represent all their definite recognition, at the time, of\r\nDensher\'s politic gain. They had in fact between this and his start for\r\nNew York many matters to handle, and the question he now touched upon\r\ncame up for Kate above all. She looked at him as if he had really told\r\nher aunt more of his immediate personal story than he had ever told\r\nherself. That, if it were so, was an accident, and it put him, for half\r\nan hour, on as much of the picture of his early years abroad, his\r\nmigratory parents, his Swiss schools, his German university, as she had\r\neasy attention for. A man, he intimated, a man of their world, would\r\nhave spotted him straight as to many of these points; a man of their\r\nworld, so far as they had a world, would have been through the English\r\nmill. But it was none the less charming to make his confession to a\r\nwoman; women had, in fact, for such differences, so much more\r\nimagination. Kate showed at present all his case could require; when\r\nshe had had it from beginning to end she declared that she now made out\r\nmore than ever yet of what she loved him for. She had herself, as a\r\nchild, lived with some continuity in the world across the Channel,\r\ncoming home again still a child; and had participated after that, in\r\nher teens, in her mother\'s brief but repeated retreats to Dresden, to\r\nFlorence, to Biarritz, weak and expensive attempts at economy from\r\nwhich there stuck to her--though in general coldly expressed, through\r\nthe instinctive avoidance of cheap raptures--the religion of foreign\r\nthings. When it was revealed to her how many more foreign things were\r\nin Merton Densher than he had hitherto taken the trouble to catalogue,\r\nshe almost faced him as if he were a map of the continent or a handsome\r\npresent of a delightful new "Murray." He hadn\'t meant to swagger, he\r\nhad rather meant to plead, though with Mrs. Lowder he had meant also a\r\nlittle to explain. His father had been, in strange countries, in twenty\r\nsettlements of the English, British chaplain, resident or occasional,\r\nand had had for years the unusual luck of never wanting a billet. His\r\ncareer abroad had therefore been unbroken, and, as his stipend had\r\nnever been great, he had educated his children at the smallest cost, in\r\nthe schools nearest; which was also a saving of railway fares.\r\nDensher\'s mother, it further appeared, had practised on her side a\r\ndistinguished industry, to the success of which--so far as success ever\r\ncrowned it--this period of exile had much contributed: she copied,\r\npatient lady, famous pictures in great museums, having begun with a\r\nhappy natural gift and taking in betimes the scale of her opportunity.\r\nCopyists abroad of course swarmed, but Mrs. Densher had had a sense and\r\na hand of her own, had arrived at a perfection that persuaded, that\r\neven deceived, and that made the disposal of her work blissfully usual.\r\nHer son, who had lost her, held her image sacred, and the effect of his\r\ntelling Kate all about her, as well as about other matters until then\r\nmixed and dim, was to render his history rich, his sources full, his\r\noutline anything but common. He had come round, he had come back, he\r\ninsisted abundantly, to being a Briton: his Cambridge years, his happy\r\nconnection, as it had proved, with his father\'s college, amply\r\ncertified to that, to say nothing of his subsequent plunge into London,\r\nwhich filled up the measure. But brave enough though his descent to\r\nEnglish earth, he had passed, by the way, through zones of air that had\r\nleft their ruffle on his wings, had been exposed to initiations\r\nineffaceable. Something had happened to him that could never be undone.\r\n\r\nWhen Kate Croy said to him as much he besought her not to insist,\r\ndeclaring that this indeed was what was too much the matter with him,\r\nthat he had been but too probably spoiled for native, for insular use.\r\nOn which, not unnaturally, she insisted the more, assuring him, without\r\nmitigation, that if he was complicated and brilliant she wouldn\'t for\r\nthe world have had him any thing less; so that he was reduced in the\r\nend to accusing her of putting the dreadful truth to him in the hollow\r\nguise of flattery. She was making out how abnormal he was in order that\r\nshe might eventually find him impossible; and, as she could fully make\r\nit out but with his aid, she had to bribe him by feigned delight to\r\nhelp her. If her last word for him, in the connection, was that the way\r\nhe saw himself was just a precious proof the more of his having tasted\r\nof the tree and being thereby prepared to assist her to eat, this gives\r\nthe happy tone of their whole talk, the measure of the flight of time\r\nin the near presence of his settled departure. Kate showed, however,\r\nthat she was to be more literally taken when she spoke of the relief\r\nAunt Maud would draw from the prospect of his absence.\r\n\r\n"Yet one can scarcely see why," he replied, "when she fears me so\r\nlittle."\r\n\r\nHis friend weighed his objection. "Your idea is that she likes you so\r\nmuch that she\'ll even go so far as to regret losing you?"\r\n\r\nWell, he saw it in their constant comprehensive way. "Since what she\r\nbuilds on is the gradual process of your alienation, she may take the\r\nview that the process constantly requires me. Mustn\'t I be there to\r\nkeep it going? It\'s in my exile that it may languish."\r\n\r\nHe went on with that fantasy, but at this point Kate ceased to attend.\r\nHe saw after a little that she had been following some thought of her\r\nown, and he had been feeling the growth of something determinant even\r\nthrough the extravagance of much of the pleasantry, the warm,\r\ntransparent irony, into which their livelier intimacy kept plunging\r\nlike a confident swimmer. Suddenly she said to him with extraordinary\r\nbeauty: "I engage myself to you for ever."\r\n\r\nThe beauty was in everything, and he could have separated\r\nnothing--couldn\'t have thought of her face as distinct from the whole\r\njoy. Yet her face had a new light. "And I pledge you--I call God to\r\nwitness!--every spark of my faith; I give you every drop of my life."\r\nThat was all, for the moment, but it was enough, and it was almost as\r\nquiet as if it were nothing. They were in the open air, in an alley of\r\nthe Gardens; the great space, which seemed to arch just then higher and\r\nspread wider for them, threw them back into deep concentration. They\r\nmoved by a common instinct to a spot, within sight, that struck them as\r\nfairly sequestered, and there, before their time together was spent,\r\nthey had extorted from concentration every advance it could make them.\r\nThey had exchanged vows and tokens, sealed their rich compact,\r\nsolemnized, so far as breathed words and murmured sounds and lighted\r\neyes and clasped hands could do it, their agreement to belong only, and\r\nto belong tremendously, to each other. They were to leave the place\r\naccordingly an affianced couple; but before they left it other things\r\nstill had passed. Densher had declared his horror of bringing to a\r\npremature end her happy relation with her aunt; and they had worked\r\nround together to a high level of wisdom and patience. Kate\'s free\r\nprofession was that she wished not to deprive _him_ of Mrs. Lowder\'s\r\ncountenance, which, in the long run, she was convinced he would\r\ncontinue to enjoy; and as, by a blessed turn, Aunt Maud had demanded of\r\nhim no promise that would tie his hands, they should be able to\r\ncultivate their destiny in their own way and yet remain loyal. One\r\ndifficulty alone stood out, which Densher named.\r\n\r\n"Of course it will never do--we must remember that--from the moment you\r\nallow her to found hopes of you for any one else in particular. So long\r\nas her view is content to remain as general as at present appears, I\r\ndon\'t see that we deceive her. At a given moment, you see, she must be\r\nundeceived: the only thing therefore is to be ready for the moment and\r\nto face it. Only, after all, in that case," the young man observed,\r\n"one doesn\'t quite make out what we shall have got from her."\r\n\r\n"What she\'ll have got from _us?"_ Kate inquired with a smile. "What\r\nshe\'ll have got from us," the girl went on, "is her own affair--it\'s\r\nfor _her_ to measure. I asked her for nothing," she added; "I never put\r\nmyself upon her. She must take her risks, and she surely understands\r\nthem. What we shall have got from her is what we\'ve already spoken of,"\r\nKate further explained; "it\'s that we shall have gained time. And so,\r\nfor that matter, will she."\r\n\r\nDensher gazed a little at all this clearness; his gaze was not at the\r\npresent hour into romantic obscurity. "Yes; no doubt, in our particular\r\nsituation, time\'s everything. And then there\'s the joy of it."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. "Of our secret?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much perhaps of our secret in itself, but of what\'s represented\r\nand, as we must somehow feel, protected and made deeper and closer by\r\nit." And his fine face, relaxed into happiness, covered her with all\r\nhis meaning. "Our being as we are."\r\n\r\nIt was as if for a moment she let the meaning sink into her. "So gone?"\r\n\r\n"So gone. So extremely gone. However," he smiled, "we shall go a good\r\ndeal further." Her answer to which was only the softness of her\r\nsilence--a silence that looked out for them both at the far reach of\r\ntheir prospect. This was immense, and they thus took final possession\r\nof it. They were practically united and they were splendidly strong;\r\nbut there were other things--things they were precisely strong enough\r\nto be able successfully to count with and safely to allow for; in\r\nconsequence of which they would, for the present, subject to some\r\nbetter reason, keep their understanding to themselves. It was not\r\nindeed, however, till after one more observation of Densher\'s that they\r\nfelt the question completely straightened out. "The only thing of\r\ncourse is that she may any day absolutely put it to you."\r\n\r\nKate considered. "Ask me where, on my honour, we are? She may,\r\nnaturally; but I doubt if in fact she will. While you\'re away she\'ll\r\nmake the most of it. She\'ll leave me alone."\r\n\r\n"But there\'ll be my letters."\r\n\r\nThe girl faced his letters. "Very, very many?"\r\n\r\n"Very, very, very many--more than ever; and you know what that is! And\r\nthen," Densher added, "there\'ll be yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shan\'t leave mine on the hall-table. I shall post them myself."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her a moment. "Do you think then I had best address you\r\nelsewhere?" After which, before she could quite answer, he added with\r\nsome emphasis: "I\'d rather not, you know. It\'s straighter."\r\n\r\nShe might again have just waited. "Of course it\'s straighter. Don\'t be\r\nafraid I shan\'t be straight. Address me," she continued, "where you\r\nlike. I shall be proud enough of its being known you write to me."\r\n\r\nHe turned it over for the last clearness. "Even at the risk of its\r\nreally bringing down the inquisition?"\r\n\r\nWell, the last clearness now filled her. "I\'m not afraid of the\r\ninquisition. If she asks if there\'s anything definite between us, I\r\nknow perfectly what I shall say."\r\n\r\n"That I _am,_ of course, \'gone\' for you?"\r\n\r\n"That I love you as I shall never in my life love any one else, and\r\nthat she can make what she likes of that." She said it out so\r\nsplendidly that it was like a new profession of faith, the fulness of a\r\ntide breaking through; and the effect of that, in turn, was to make her\r\ncompanion meet her with such eyes that she had time again before he\r\ncould otherwise speak. "Besides, she\'s just as likely to ask _you."_\r\n\r\n"Not while I\'m away."\r\n\r\n"Then when you come back."\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Densher, "we shall have had our particular joy. But\r\nwhat I feel is," he candidly added, "that, by an idea of her own, her\r\nsuperior policy, she _won\'t_ ask me. She\'ll let me off. I shan\'t have\r\nto lie to her."\r\n\r\n"It will be left all to me?" asked Kate.\r\n\r\n"All to you!" he tenderly laughed.\r\n\r\nBut it was, oddly, the very next moment as if he had perhaps been a\r\nshade too candid. His discrimination seemed to mark a possible, a\r\nnatural reality, a reality not wholly disallowed by the account the\r\ngirl had just given of her own intention. There _was_ a difference in\r\nthe air--even if none other than the supposedly usual difference in\r\ntruth between man and woman; and it was almost as if the sense of this\r\nprovoked her. She seemed to cast about an instant, and then she went\r\nback a little resentfully to something she had suffered to pass a\r\nminute before. She appeared to take up rather more seriously than she\r\nneed the joke about her freedom to deceive. Yet she did this too in a\r\nbeautiful way. "Men are too stupid--even you. You didn\'t understand\r\njust now why, if I post my letters myself, it won\'t be for any thing so\r\nvulgar as to hide them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you said--for the pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but you didn\'t, you don\'t understand what the pleasure may be.\r\nThere are refinements----!" she more patiently dropped. "I mean of\r\nconsciousness, of sensation, of appreciation," she went on. "No," she\r\nsadly insisted--_"men_ don\'t know. They know, in such matters, almost\r\nnothing but what women show them."\r\n\r\nThis was one of the speeches, frequent in her, that, liberally,\r\njoyfully, intensely adopted and, in itself, as might be, embraced, drew\r\nhim again as close to her, and held him as long, as their conditions\r\npermitted. "Then that\'s exactly why we\'ve such an abysmal need of you!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two ladies who, in advance of the Swiss season, had been warned\r\nthat their design was unconsidered, that the passes would not be clear,\r\nnor the air mild, nor the inns open--the two ladies who,\r\ncharacteristically, had braved a good deal of possibly interested\r\nremonstrance were finding themselves, as their adventure turned out,\r\nwonderfully sustained. It was the judgment of the head-waiters and\r\nother functionaries on the Italian lakes that approved itself now as\r\ninterested; they themselves had been conscious of impatiences, of\r\nbolder dreams--at least the younger had; so that one of the things they\r\nmade out together--making out as they did an endless variety--was that\r\nin those operatic palaces of the Villa d\'Este, of Cadenabbia, of\r\nPallanza and Stresa, lone women, however reinforced by a\r\ntravelling-library of instructive volumes, were apt to be beguiled and\r\nundone. Their flights of fancy moreover had been modest; they had for\r\ninstance risked nothing vital in hoping to make their way by the\r\nBr\xfcnig. They were making it in fact happily enough as we meet them, and\r\nwere only wishing that, for the wondrous beauty of the early\r\nhigh-climbing spring, it might have been longer and the places to pause\r\nand rest more numerous.\r\n\r\nSuch at least had been the intimated attitude of Mrs. Stringham, the\r\nelder of the companions, who had her own view of the impatiences of the\r\nyounger, to which, however, she offered an opposition but of the most\r\ncircuitous. She moved, the admirable Mrs. Stringham, in a fine cloud of\r\nobservation and suspicion; she was in the position, as she believed, of\r\nknowing much more about Milly Theale than Milly herself knew, and yet\r\nof having to darken her knowledge as well as make it active. The woman\r\nin the world least formed by nature, as she was quite aware, for\r\nduplicities and labyrinths, she found herself dedicated to personal\r\nsubtlety by a new set of circumstances, above all by a new personal\r\nrelation; had now in fact to recognise that an education in the\r\noccult--she could scarce say what to call it--had begun for her the day\r\nshe left New York with Mildred. She had come on from Boston for that\r\npurpose; had seen little of the girl--or rather had seen her but\r\nbriefly, for Mrs. Stringham, when she saw anything at all, saw much,\r\nsaw everything--before accepting her proposal; and had accordingly\r\nplaced herself, by her act, in a boat that she more and more estimated\r\nas, humanly speaking, of the biggest, though likewise, no doubt, in\r\nmany ways, by reason of its size, of the safest. In Boston, the winter\r\nbefore, the young lady in whom we are interested had, on the spot,\r\ndeeply, yet almost tacitly, appealed to her, dropped into her mind the\r\nshy conceit of some assistance, some devotion to render. Mrs.\r\nStringham\'s little life had often been visited by shy conceits--secret\r\ndreams that had fluttered their hour between its narrow walls without,\r\nfor any great part, so much as mustering courage to look out of its\r\nrather dim windows. But this imagination--the fancy of a possible link\r\nwith the remarkable young thing from New York--_had_ mustered courage:\r\nhad perched, on the instant, at the clearest look-out it could find,\r\nand might be said to have remained there till, only a few months later,\r\nit had caught, in surprise and joy, the unmistakable flash of a signal.\r\n\r\nMilly Theale had Boston friends, such as they were, and of recent\r\nmaking; and it was understood that her visit to them--a visit that was\r\nnot to be meagre--had been undertaken, after a series of bereavements,\r\nin the interest of the particular peace that New York could not give.\r\nIt was recognised, liberally enough, that there were many\r\nthings--perhaps even too many--New York _could_ give; but this was felt\r\nto make no difference in the constant fact that what you had most to\r\ndo, under the discipline of life, or of death, was really to feel your\r\nsituation as grave. Boston could help you to that as nothing else\r\ncould, and it had extended to Milly, by every presumption, some such\r\nmeasure of assistance. Mrs. Stringham was never to forget--for the\r\nmoment had not faded, nor the infinitely fine vibration it set up in\r\nany degree ceased--her own first sight of the striking apparition, then\r\nunheralded and unexplained: the slim, constantly pale, delicately\r\nhaggard, anomalously, agreeably angular young person, of not more than\r\ntwo-and-twenty in spite of her marks, whose hair was some how\r\nexceptionally red even for the real thing, which it innocently\r\nconfessed to being, and whose clothes were remarkably black even for\r\nrobes of mourning, which was the meaning they expressed. It was New\r\nYork mourning, it was New York hair, it was a New York history,\r\nconfused as yet, but multitudinous, of the loss of parents, brothers,\r\nsisters, almost every human appendage, all on a scale and with a sweep\r\nthat had required the greater stage; it was a New York legend of\r\naffecting, of romantic isolation, and, beyond everything, it was by\r\nmost accounts, in respect to the mass of money so piled on the girl\'s\r\nback, a set of New York possibilities. She was alone, she was stricken,\r\nshe was rich, and, in particular, she was strange--a combination in\r\nitself of a nature to engage Mrs. Stringham\'s attention. But it was the\r\nstrangeness that most determined our good lady\'s sympathy, convinced as\r\nshe was that it was much greater than any one else--any one but the\r\nsole Susan Stringham--supposed. Susan privately settled it that Boston\r\nwas not in the least seeing her, was only occupied with her seeing\r\nBoston, and that any assumed affinity between the two characters was\r\ndelusive and vain. She was seeing her, and she had quite the deepest\r\nmoment of her life in now obeying the instinct to conceal the vision.\r\nShe couldn\'t explain it--no one would understand. They would say clever\r\nBoston things--Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont, which she\r\nboldly upheld as the real heart of New England, Boston being "too far\r\nsouth"--but they would only darken counsel.\r\n\r\nThere could be no better proof, than this quick intellectual split, of\r\nthe impression made on our friend, who shone, herself, she was well\r\naware, with but the reflected light of the admirable city. She too had\r\nhad her discipline, but it had not made her striking; it had been\r\nprosaically usual, though doubtless a decent dose; and had only made\r\nher usual to match it--usual, that is, as Boston went. She had lost\r\nfirst her husband, and then her mother, with whom, on her husband\'s\r\ndeath, she had lived again; so that now, childless, she was but more\r\nsharply single than before. But she sat rather coldly light, having, as\r\nshe called it, enough to live on--so far, that is, as she lived by\r\nbread alone: how little indeed she was regularly content with that diet\r\nappeared from the name she had made--Susan Shepherd Stringham--as a\r\ncontributor to the best magazines. She wrote short stories, and she\r\nfondly believed she had her "note," the art of showing New England\r\nwithout showing it wholly in the kitchen. She had not herself been\r\nbrought up in the kitchen; she knew others who had not; and to speak\r\nfor them had thus become with her a literary mission. To _be_ in truth\r\nliterary had ever been her dearest thought, the thought that kept her\r\nbright little nippers perpetually in position. There were masters,\r\nmodels, celebrities, mainly foreign, whom she finely accounted so and\r\nin whose light she ingeniously laboured; there were others whom,\r\nhowever chattered about, she ranked with the inane, for she was full of\r\ndiscrimination; but all categories failed her--they ceased at least to\r\nsignify--as soon as she found herself in presence of the real thing,\r\nthe romantic life itself. That was what she saw in Mildred--what\r\npositively made her hand a while tremble too much for the pen. She had\r\nhad, it seemed to her, a revelation--such as even New England refined\r\nand grammatical couldn\'t give; and, all made up as she was of small\r\nneat memories and ingenuities, little industries and ambitions, mixed\r\nwith something moral, personal, that was still more intensely\r\nresponsive, she felt her new friend would have done her an ill turn if\r\ntheir friendship shouldn\'t develop, and yet that nothing would be left\r\nof anything else if it should. It was for the surrender of everything\r\nelse that she was, however, quite prepared, and while she went about\r\nher usual Boston business with her usual Boston probity she was really\r\nall the while holding herself. She wore her "handsome" felt hat, so\r\nTyrolese, yet some how, though feathered from the eagle\'s wing, so\r\ntruly domestic, with the same straightness and security; she attached\r\nher fur boa with the same honest precautions; she preserved her balance\r\non the ice-slopes with the same practised skill; she opened, each\r\nevening, her "Transcript" with the same interfusion of suspense and\r\nresignation; she attended her almost daily concert with the same\r\nexpenditure of patience and the same economy of passion; she flitted in\r\nand out of the Public Library with the air of conscientiously returning\r\nor bravely carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself; and\r\nfinally--it was what she most did--she watched the thin trickle of a\r\nfictive "love-interest" through that somewhat serpentine channel, in\r\nthe magazines, which she mainly managed to keep clear for it. But the\r\nreal thing, all the while, was elsewhere; the real thing had gone back\r\nto New York, leaving behind it the two unsolved questions, quite\r\ndistinct, of why it _was_ real, and whether she should ever be so near\r\nit again.\r\n\r\nFor the figure to which these questions attached themselves she had\r\nfound a convenient description--she thought of it for herself, always,\r\nas that of a girl with a background. The great reality was in the fact\r\nthat, very soon, after but two or three meetings, the girl with the\r\nbackground, the girl with the crown of old gold and the mourning that\r\nwas not as the mourning of Boston, but at once more rebellious in its\r\ngloom and more frivolous in its frills, had told her she had never seen\r\nany one like her. They had met thus as opposed curiosities, and that\r\nsimple remark of Milly\'s--if simple it was--became the most important\r\nthing that had ever happened to her; it deprived the love-interest, for\r\nthe time, of actuality and even of pertinence; it moved her first, in\r\nshort, in a high degree, to gratitude, and then to no small compassion.\r\nYet in respect to this relation at least it was what did prove the key\r\nof knowledge; it lighted up as nothing else could do the poor young\r\nwoman\'s history. That the potential heiress of all the ages should\r\nnever have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber, after all, to\r\nthe "Transcript" was a truth that--in especial as announced with\r\nmodesty, with humility, with regret--described a situation. It laid\r\nupon the elder woman, as to the void to be filled, a weight of\r\nresponsibility; but in particular it led her to ask whom poor Mildred\r\n_had_ then seen, and what range of contacts it had taken to produce\r\nsuch queer surprises. That was really the inquiry that had ended by\r\nclearing the air: the key of knowledge was felt to click in the lock\r\nfrom the moment it flashed upon Mrs. Stringham that her friend had been\r\nstarved for culture. Culture was what she herself represented for her,\r\nand it was living up to that principle that would surely prove the\r\ngreat business. She knew, the clever lady, what the principle itself\r\nrepresented, and the limits of her own store; and a certain alarm would\r\nhave grown upon her if something else hadn\'t grown faster.\r\n\r\nThis was, fortunately for her--and we give it in her own words--the\r\nsense of a harrowing pathos. That, primarily, was what appealed to her,\r\nwhat seemed to open the door of romance for her still wider than any,\r\nthan a still more reckless, connection with the "picture-papers." For\r\nsuch was essentially the point: it was rich, romantic, abysmal, to\r\nhave, as was evident, thousands and thousands a year, to have youth and\r\nintelligence and if not beauty, at least, in equal measure, a high,\r\ndim, charming, ambiguous oddity, which was even better, and then on top\r\nof all to enjoy boundless freedom, the freedom of the wind in the\r\ndesert--it was unspeakably touching to be so equipped and yet to have\r\nbeen reduced by fortune to little humble-minded mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt brought our friend\'s imagination back again to New York, where\r\naberrations were so possible in the intellectual sphere, and it in fact\r\ncaused a visit she presently paid there to overflow with interest. As\r\nMilly had beautifully invited her, so she would hold out if she could\r\nagainst the strain of so much confidence in her mind; and the\r\nremarkable thing was that even at the end of three weeks she _had_ held\r\nout. But by this time her mind had grown comparatively bold and free;\r\nit was dealing with new quantities, a different proportion\r\naltogether--and that had made for refreshment: she had accordingly gone\r\nhome in convenient possession of her subject. New York was vast, New\r\nYork was startling, with strange histories, with wild cosmopolite\r\nbackward generations that accounted for anything; and to have got\r\nnearer the luxuriant tribe of which the rare creature was the final\r\nflower, the immense, extravagant, unregulated cluster, with free-living\r\nancestors, handsome dead cousins, lurid uncles, beautiful vanished\r\naunts, persons all busts and curls, preserved, though so exposed, in\r\nthe marble of famous French chisels--all this, to say nothing of the\r\neffect of closer growths of the stem, was to have had one\'s small\r\nworld-space both crowded and enlarged. Our couple had at all events\r\neffected an exchange; the elder friend had been as consciously\r\nintellectual as possible, and the younger, abounding in personal\r\nrevelation, had been as unconsciously distinguished. This was\r\npoetry--it was also history--Mrs. Stringham thought, to a finer tune\r\neven than Maeterlink and Pater, than Marbot and Gregorovius. She\r\nappointed occasions for the reading of these authors with her hostess,\r\nrather perhaps than actually achieved great spans; but what they\r\nmanaged and what they missed speedily sank for her into the dim depths\r\nof the merely relative, so quickly, so strongly had she clutched her\r\ncentral clue. All her scruples and hesitations, all her anxious\r\nenthusiasms, had reduced themselves to a single alarm--the fear that\r\nshe really might act on her companion clumsily and coarsely. She was\r\npositively afraid of what she might do to her, and to avoid that, to\r\navoid it with piety and passion, to do, rather, nothing at all, to\r\nleave her untouched because no touch one could apply, however light,\r\nhowever just, however earnest and anxious, would be half good enough,\r\nwould be anything but an ugly smutch upon perfection--this now imposed\r\nitself as a consistent, an inspiring thought.\r\n\r\nLess than a month after the event that had so determined Mrs.\r\nStringham\'s attitude--close upon the heels, that is, of her return from\r\nNew York--she was reached by a proposal that brought up for her the\r\nkind of question her delicacy might have to contend with. Would she\r\nstart for Europe with her young friend at the earliest possible date,\r\nand should she be willing to do so without making conditions? The\r\ninquiry was launched by wire; explanations, in sufficiency, were\r\npromised; extreme urgency was suggested, and a general surrender\r\ninvited. It was to the honour of her sincerity that she made the\r\nsurrender on the spot, though it was not perhaps altogether to that of\r\nher logic. She had wanted, very consciously, from the first, to give\r\nsomething up for her new acquaintance, but she had now no doubt that\r\nshe was practically giving up all. What settled this was the fulness of\r\na particular impression, the impression that had throughout more and\r\nmore supported her and which she would have uttered so far as she might\r\nby saying that the charm of the creature was positively in the\r\ncreature\'s greatness. She would have been content so to leave it;\r\nunless indeed she had said, more familiarly, that Mildred was the\r\nbiggest impression of her life. That was at all events the biggest\r\naccount of her, and none but a big, clearly, would do. Her situation,\r\nas such things were called, was on the grand scale; but it still was\r\nnot that. It was her nature, once for all--a nature that reminded Mrs.\r\nStringham of the term always used in the newspapers about the great new\r\nsteamers, the inordinate number of "feet of water" they drew; so that\r\nif, in your little boat, you had chosen to hover and approach, you had\r\nbut yourself to thank, when once motion was started, for the way the\r\ndraught pulled you. Milly drew the feet of water, and odd though it\r\nmight seem that a lonely girl, who was not robust and who hated sound\r\nand show, should stir the stream like a leviathan, her companion\r\nfloated off with the sense of rocking violently at her side. More than\r\nprepared, however, for that excitement, Mrs. Stringham mainly failed of\r\nease in respect to her own consistency. To attach herself for an\r\nindefinite time seemed a roundabout way of holding her hands off. If\r\nshe wished to be sure of neither touching nor smutching, the straighter\r\nplan would doubtless have been not to keep her friend within reach.\r\nThis in fact she fully recognised, and with it the degree to which she\r\ndesired that the girl should lead her life, a life certain to be so\r\nmuch finer than that of anybody else. The difficulty, however, by good\r\nfortune, cleared away as soon as she had further recognised, as she was\r\nspeedily able to do, that she, Susan Shepherd--the name with which\r\nMilly for the most part amused herself--was _not_ anybody else. She had\r\nrenounced that character; she had now no life to lead; and she honestly\r\nbelieved that she was thus supremely equipped for leading Milly\'s own.\r\nNo other person whatever, she was sure, had to an equal degree this\r\nqualification, and it was really to assert it that she fondly embarked.\r\n\r\nMany things, though not in many weeks, had come and gone since then,\r\nand one of the best of them, doubtless, had been the voyage itself, by\r\nthe happy southern course, to the succession of Mediterranean ports,\r\nwith the dazzled wind-up at Naples. Two or three others had preceded\r\nthis; incidents, indeed rather lively marks, of their last fortnight at\r\nhome, and one of which had determined on Mrs. Stringham\'s part a rush\r\nto New York, forty-eight breathless hours there, previous to her final\r\nrally. But the great sustained sea-light had drunk up the rest of the\r\npicture, so that for many days other questions and other possibilities\r\nsounded with as little effect as a trio of penny whistles might sound\r\nin a Wagner overture. It was the Wagner overture that practically\r\nprevailed, up through Italy, where Milly had already been, still\r\nfurther up and across the Alps, which were also partly known to Mrs.\r\nStringham; only perhaps "taken" to a time not wholly congruous, hurried\r\nin fact on account of the girl\'s high restlessness. She had been\r\nexpected, she had frankly promised, to be restless--that was partly why\r\nshe was "great"--or was a consequence, at any rate, if not a cause; yet\r\nshe had not perhaps altogether announced herself as straining so hard\r\nat the cord. It was familiar, it was beautiful to Mrs. Stringham that\r\nshe had arrears to make up, the chances that had lapsed for her through\r\nthe wanton ways of forefathers fond of Paris, but not of its higher\r\nsides, and fond almost of nothing else; but the vagueness, the\r\nopenness, the eagerness without point and the interest without\r\npause--all a part of the charm of her oddity as at first presented--had\r\nbecome more striking in proportion as they triumphed over movement and\r\nchange. She had arts and idiosyncrasies of which no great account could\r\nhave been given, but which were a daily grace if you lived with them;\r\nsuch as the art of being almost tragically impatient and yet making it\r\nas light as air; of being inexplicably sad and yet making it as clear\r\nas noon; of being unmistakably gay, and yet making it as soft as dusk.\r\nMrs. Stringham by this time understood everything, was more than ever\r\nconfirmed in wonder and admiration, in her view that it was life enough\r\nsimply to feel her companion\'s feelings; but there were special keys\r\nshe had not yet added to her bunch, impressions that, of a sudden, were\r\napt to affect her as new.\r\n\r\nThis particular day on the great Swiss road had been, for some reason,\r\nfull of them, and they referred themselves, provisionally, to some\r\ndeeper depth than she had touched--though into two or three such\r\ndepths, it must be added, she had peeped long enough to find herself\r\nsuddenly draw back. It was not Milly\'s unpacified state, in short, that\r\nnow troubled her--though certainly, as Europe was the great American\r\nsedative, the failure was to some extent to be noted: it was the\r\nsuspected presence of something behind it--which, however, could\r\nscarcely have taken its place there since their departure. What any\r\nfresh motive of unrest could suddenly have sprung from was, in short,\r\nnot to be divined. It was but half an explanation to say that\r\nexcitement, for each of them, had naturally dropped, and that what they\r\nhad left behind, or tried to--the great serious facts of life, as Mrs.\r\nStringham liked to call them--was once more coming into sight as\r\nobjects loom through smoke when smoke begins to clear; for these were\r\ngeneral appearances from which the girl\'s own aspect, her really larger\r\nvagueness, seemed rather to disconnect itself. The nearest approach to\r\na personal anxiety indulged in as yet by the elder lady was on her\r\ntaking occasion to wonder if what she had more than anything else got\r\nhold of mightn\'t be one of the finer, one of the finest, one of the\r\nrarest--as she called it so that she might call it nothing worse--cases\r\nof American intensity. She had just had a moment of alarm--asked\r\nherself if her young friend were merely going to treat her to some\r\ncomplicated drama of nerves. At the end of a week, however, with their\r\nfurther progress, her young friend had effectively answered the\r\nquestion and given her the impression, indistinct indeed as yet, of\r\nsomething that had a reality compared with which the nervous\r\nexplanation would have been coarse. Mrs. Stringham found herself from\r\nthat hour, in other words, in presence of an explanation that remained\r\na muffled and intangible form, but that, assuredly, should it take on\r\nsharpness, would explain everything and more than everything, would\r\nbecome instantly the light in which Milly was to be read.\r\n\r\nSuch a matter as this may at all events speak of the style in which our\r\nyoung woman could affect those who were near her, may testify to the\r\nsort of interest she could inspire. She worked--and seemingly quite\r\nwithout design--upon the sympathy, the curiosity, the fancy of her\r\nassociates, and we shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer\r\nto her than by feeling their impression and sharing, if need be, their\r\nconfusion. She reduced them, Mrs. Stringham would have said, reduced\r\nthem to a consenting bewilderment; which was precisely, for that good\r\nlady, on a last analysis, what was most in harmony with her greatness.\r\nShe exceeded, escaped measure, was surprising only because _they_ were\r\nso far from great. Thus it was that on this wondrous day on the Br\xfcnig\r\nthe spell of watching her had grown more than ever irresistible; a\r\nproof of what--or of a part of what--Mrs. Stringham had, with all the\r\nrest, been reduced to. She had almost the sense of tracking her young\r\nfriend as if at a given moment to pounce. She knew she shouldn\'t\r\npounce, she hadn\'t come out to pounce; yet she felt her attention\r\nsecretive, all the same, and her observation scientific. She struck\r\nherself as hovering like a spy, applying tests, laying traps,\r\nconcealing signs. This would last, however, only till she should fairly\r\nknow what was the matter; and to watch was, after all, meanwhile, a way\r\nof clinging to the girl, not less than an occupation, a satisfaction in\r\nitself. The pleasure of watching, moreover, if a reason were needed,\r\ncame from a sense of her beauty. Her beauty hadn\'t at all originally\r\nseemed a part of the situation, and Mrs. Stringham had, even in the\r\nfirst flush of friendship, not named it, grossly, to any one; having\r\nseen early that, for stupid people--and who, she sometimes secretly\r\nasked herself, wasn\'t stupid?--it would take a great deal of\r\nexplaining. She had learned not to mention it till it was mentioned\r\nfirst--which occasionally happened, but not too often; and then she was\r\nthere in force. Then she both warmed to the perception that met her own\r\nperception, and disputed it, suspiciously, as to special items; while,\r\nin general, she had learned to refine even to the point of herself\r\nemploying the word that most people employed. She employed it to\r\npretend that she was also stupid and so have done with the matter;\r\nspoke of her friend as plain, as ugly even, in a case of especially\r\ndense insistence; but as, in appearance, so "awfully full of things."\r\nThis was her own way of describing a face that, thanks, doubtless, to\r\nrather too much forehead, too much nose and too much mouth, together\r\nwith too little mere conventional colour and conventional line, was\r\nexpressive, irregular, exquisite, both for speech and for silence. When\r\nMilly smiled it was a public event--when she didn\'t it was a chapter of\r\nhistory. They had stopped, on the Br\xfcnig, for luncheon, and there had\r\ncome up for them under the charm of the place the question of a longer\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham was now on the ground of thrilled recognitions, small\r\nsharp echoes of a past which she kept in a well-thumbed case, but\r\nwhich, on pressure of a spring and exposure to the air, still showed\r\nitself ticking as hard as an honest old watch. The embalmed "Europe" of\r\nher younger time had partly stood for three years of Switzerland, a\r\nterm of continuous school at Vevey, with rewards of merit in the form\r\nof silver medals tied by blue ribbons and mild mountain-passes attacked\r\nwith alpenstocks. It was the good girls who, in the holidays, were\r\ntaken highest, and our friend could now judge, from what she supposed\r\nher familiarity with the minor peaks, that she had been one of the\r\nbest. These reminiscences, sacred to-day because prepared in the hushed\r\nchambers of the past, had been part of the general train laid for the\r\npair of sisters, daughters early fatherless, by their brave Vermont\r\nmother, who struck her at present as having apparently, almost like\r\nColumbus, worked out, all unassisted, a conception of the other side of\r\nthe globe. She had focussed Vevey, by the light of nature, and with\r\nextraordinary completeness, at Burlington; after which she had\r\nembarked, sailed, landed, explored and, above all, made good her\r\npresence. She had given her daughters the five years in Switzerland and\r\nGermany that were to leave them ever afterwards a standard of\r\ncomparison for all cycles of Cathay, and to stamp the younger in\r\nespecial--Susan was the younger--with a character that, as Mrs.\r\nStringham had often had occasion, through life, to say to herself, made\r\nall the difference. It made all the difference for Mrs. Stringham, over\r\nand over again and in the most remote connections, that, thanks to her\r\nparent\'s lonely, thrifty, hardy faith, she was a woman of the world.\r\nThere were plenty of women who were all sorts of things that she\r\nwasn\'t, but who, on the other hand, were not that, and who didn\'t know\r\n_she_ was (which she liked--it relegated them still further) and didn\'t\r\nknow, either, how it enabled her to judge them. She had never seen\r\nherself so much in this light as during the actual phase of her\r\nassociated, if slightly undirected, pilgrimage; and the consciousness\r\ngave perhaps to her plea for a pause more intensity than she knew. The\r\nirrecoverable days had come back to her from far off; they were part of\r\nthe sense of the cool upper air and of everything else that hung like\r\nan indestructible scent to the torn garment of youth--the taste of\r\nhoney and the luxury of milk, the sound of cattle-bells and the rush of\r\nstreams, the fragrance of trodden balms and the dizziness of deep\r\ngorges.\r\n\r\nMilly clearly felt these things too, but they affected her companion at\r\nmoments--that was quite the way Mrs. Stringham would have expressed\r\nit--as the princess in a conventional tragedy might have affected the\r\nconfidant if a personal emotion had ever been permitted to the latter.\r\nThat a princess could only be a princess was a truth with which,\r\nessentially, a confidant, however responsive, had to live. Mrs.\r\nStringham was a woman of the world, but Milly Theale was a princess,\r\nthe only one she had yet had to deal with, and this in its way, too,\r\nmade all the difference. It was a perfectly definite doom for the\r\nwearer--it was for every one else a perfectly palpable quality. It\r\nmight have been, possibly, with its involved loneliness and other\r\nmysteries, the weight under which she fancied her companion\'s admirable\r\nhead occasionally, and ever so submissively, bowed. Milly had quite\r\nassented at luncheon to their staying over, and had left her to look at\r\nrooms, settle questions, arrange about their keeping on their carriage\r\nand horses; cares that had now moreover fallen to Mrs. Stringham as a\r\nmatter of course and that yet for some reason, on this occasion\r\nparticularly, brought home to her--all agreeably, richly, almost\r\ngrandly--what it was to live with the great. Her young friend had, in a\r\nsublime degree, a sense closed to the general question of difficulty,\r\nwhich she got rid of, furthermore, not in the least as one had seen\r\nmany charming persons do, by merely passing it on to others. She kept\r\nit completely at a distance: it never entered the circle; the most\r\nplaintive confidant couldn\'t have dragged it in; and to tread the path\r\nof a confidant was accordingly to live exempt. Service was in other\r\nwords so easy to render that the whole thing was like court life\r\nwithout the hardships. It came back of course to the question of money,\r\nand our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected that if\r\none were talking of the "difference," it was just this, this\r\nincomparably and nothing else, that when all was said and done most\r\nmade it. A less vulgarly, a less obviously purchasing or parading\r\nperson she couldn\'t have imagined; but it was, all the same, the truth\r\nof truths that the girl couldn\'t get away from her wealth. She might\r\nleave her conscientious companion as freely alone with it as possible\r\nand never ask a question, scarce even tolerate a reference; but it was\r\nin the fine folds of the helplessly expensive little black frock that\r\nshe drew over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off; it was in the\r\ncurious and splendid coils of hair, "done" with no eye whatever to the\r\n_mode du jour,_ that peeped from under the corresponding indifference\r\nof her hat, the merely personal tradition that suggested a sort of\r\nnoble inelegance; it lurked between the leaves of the uncut but\r\nantiquated Tauchnitz volume of which, before going out, she had\r\nmechanically possessed herself. She couldn\'t dress it away, nor walk it\r\naway, nor read it away, nor think it away; she could neither smile it\r\naway in any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened sigh. She\r\ncouldn\'t have lost it if she had tried--that was what it was to be\r\nreally rich. It had to be _the_ thing you were. When at the end of an\r\nhour she had not returned to the house Mrs. Stringham, though the\r\nbright afternoon was yet young, took, with precautions, the same\r\ndirection, went to join her in case of her caring for a walk. But the\r\npurpose of joining her was in truth less distinct than that of a due\r\nregard for a possibly preferred detachment: so that, once more, the\r\ngood lady proceeded with a quietness that made her slightly "underhand"\r\neven in her own eyes. She couldn\'t help that, however, and she didn\'t\r\ncare, sure as she was that what she really wanted was not to overstep,\r\nbut to stop in time. It was to be able to stop in time that she went\r\nsoftly, but she had on this occasion further to go than ever yet, for\r\nshe followed in vain, and at last with some anxiety, the footpath she\r\nbelieved Milly to have taken. It wound up a hillside and into the\r\nhigher Alpine meadows in which, all these last days, they had so often\r\nwanted, as they passed above or below, to stray; and then it obscured\r\nitself in a wood, but always going up, up, and with a small cluster of\r\nbrown old high-perched chalets evidently for its goal. Mrs. Stringham\r\nreached in due course the chalets, and there received from a bewildered\r\nold woman, a very fearful person to behold, an indication that\r\nsufficiently guided her. The young lady had been seen not long before\r\npassing further on, over a crest and to a place where the way would\r\ndrop again, as our unappeased inquirer found it, in fact, a quarter of\r\nan hour later, markedly and almost alarmingly to do. It led somewhere,\r\nyet apparently quite into space, for the great side of the mountain\r\nappeared, from where she pulled up, to fall away altogether, though\r\nprobably but to some issue below and out of sight. Her uncertainty\r\nmoreover was brief, for she next became aware of the presence on a\r\nfragment of rock, twenty yards off, of the Tauchnitz volume that the\r\ngirl had brought out, and that therefore pointed to her shortly\r\nprevious passage. She had rid herself of the book, which was an\r\nencumbrance, and meant of course to pick it up on her return; but as\r\nshe hadn\'t yet picked it up what on earth had become of her? Mrs.\r\nStringham, I hasten to add, was within a few moments to see; but it was\r\nquite an accident that she had not, before they were over, betrayed by\r\nher deeper agitation the fact of her own nearness.\r\n\r\nThe whole place, with the descent of the path and as a sequel to a\r\nsharp turn that was masked by rocks and shrubs, appeared to fall\r\nprecipitously and to become a "view" pure and simple, a view of great\r\nextent and beauty, but thrown forward and vertiginous. Milly, with the\r\npromise of it from just above, had gone straight down to it, not\r\nstopping till it was all before her; and here, on what struck her\r\nfriend as the dizzy edge of it, she was seated at her ease. The path\r\nsomehow took care of itself and its final business, but the girl\'s seat\r\nwas a slab of rock at the end of a short promontory or excrescence that\r\nmerely pointed off to the right into gulfs of air and that was so\r\nplaced by good fortune, if not by the worst, as to be at last\r\ncompletely visible. For Mrs. Stringham stifled a cry on taking in what\r\nshe believed to be the danger of such a perch for a mere maiden; her\r\nliability to slip, to slide, to leap, to be precipitated by a single\r\nfalse movement, by a turn of the head--how could one tell? into\r\nwhatever was beneath. A thousand thoughts, for the minute, roared in\r\nthe poor lady\'s ears, but without reaching, as happened, Milly\'s. It\r\nwas a commotion that left our observer intensely still and holding her\r\nbreath. What had first been offered her was the possibility of a latent\r\nintention--however wild the idea--in such a posture; of some betrayed\r\naccordance of Milly\'s caprice with a horrible hidden obsession. But\r\nsince Mrs. Stringham stood as motionless as if a sound, a syllable,\r\nmust have produced the start that would be fatal, so even the lapse of\r\na few seconds had a partly reassuring effect. It gave her time to\r\nreceive the impression which, when she some minutes later softly\r\nretraced her steps, was to be the sharpest she carried away. This was\r\nthe impression that if the girl was deeply and recklessly meditating\r\nthere, she was not meditating a jump; she was on the contrary, as she\r\nsat, much more in a state of uplifted and unlimited possession that had\r\nnothing to gain from violence. She was looking down on the kingdoms of\r\nthe earth, and though indeed that of itself might well go to the brain,\r\nit wouldn\'t be with a view of renouncing them. Was she choosing among\r\nthem, or did she want them all? This question, before Mrs. Stringham\r\nhad decided what to do, made others vain; in accordance with which she\r\nsaw, or believed she did, that if it might be dangerous to call out, to\r\nsound in any way a surprise, it would probably be safe enough to\r\nwithdraw as she had come. She watched a while longer, she held her\r\nbreath, and she never knew afterwards what time had elapsed.\r\n\r\nNot many minutes probably, yet they had not seemed few, and they had\r\ngiven her so much to think of, not only while creeping home, but while\r\nwaiting afterwards at the inn, that she was still busy with them when,\r\nlate in the afternoon, Milly reappeared. She had stopped at the point\r\nof the path where the Tauchnitz lay, had taken it up and, with the\r\npencil attached to her watch-guard, had scrawled a word--_\xe0\r\nbient\xf4t!_--across the cover; then, even under the girl\'s continued\r\ndelay, had measured time without a return of alarm. For she now saw\r\nthat the great thing she had brought away was precisely a conviction\r\nthat the future was not to exist for her princess in the form of any\r\nsharp or simple release from the human predicament. It wouldn\'t be for\r\nher a question of a flying leap and thereby of a quick escape. It would\r\nbe a question of taking full in the face the whole assault of life, to\r\nthe general muster of which indeed her face might have been directly\r\npresented as she sat there on her rock. Mrs. Stringham was thus able to\r\nsay to herself, even after another interval of some length, that if her\r\nyoung friend still continued absent it wouldn\'t be because--whatever\r\nthe opportunity--she had cut short the thread. She wouldn\'t have\r\ncommitted suicide; she knew herself unmistakably reserved for some more\r\ncomplicated passage; this was the very vision in which she had, with no\r\nlittle awe, been discovered. The image that thus remained with the\r\nelder lady kept the character of revelation. During the breathless\r\nminutes of her watch she had seen her companion afresh; the latter\'s\r\ntype, aspect, marks, her history, her state, her beauty, her mystery,\r\nall unconsciously betrayed themselves to the Alpine air, and all had\r\nbeen gathered in again to feed Mrs. Stringham\'s flame. They are things\r\nthat will more distinctly appear for us, and they are meanwhile briefly\r\nrepresented by the enthusiasm that was stronger on our friend\'s part\r\nthan any doubt. It was a consciousness she was scarce yet used to\r\ncarrying, but she had as beneath her feet a mine of something precious.\r\nShe seemed to herself to stand near the mouth, not yet quite cleared.\r\nThe mine but needed working and would certainly yield a treasure. She\r\nwas not thinking, either, of Milly\'s gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing, when they met, about the words scrawled on the\r\nTauchnitz, and Mrs. Stringham then noticed that she had not the book\r\nwith her. She had left it lying and probably would never remember it at\r\nall. Her comrade\'s decision was therefore quickly made not to speak of\r\nhaving followed her; and within five minutes of her return, wonderfully\r\nenough, the preoccupation denoted by her forgetfulness further declared\r\nitself. "Should you think me quite abominable if I were to say that\r\nafter all----?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham had already thought, with the first sound of the\r\nquestion, everything she was capable of thinking, and had immediately\r\nmade such a sign that Milly\'s words gave place to visible relief at her\r\nassent. "You don\'t care for our stop here--you\'d rather go straight on?\r\nWe\'ll start then with the peep of to-morrow\'s dawn--or as early as you\r\nlike; it\'s only rather late now to take the road again." And she smiled\r\nto show how she meant it for a joke that an instant onward rush was\r\nwhat the girl would have wished. "I bullied you into stopping," she\r\nadded; "so it serves me right."\r\n\r\nMilly made in general the most of her good friend\'s jokes; but she\r\nhumoured this one a little absently. "Oh yes, you do bully me." And it\r\nwas thus arranged between them, with no discussion at all, that they\r\nwould resume their journey in the morning. The younger tourist\'s\r\ninterest in the detail of the matter--in spite of a declaration from\r\nthe elder that she would consent to be dragged anywhere--appeared\r\nalmost immediately afterwards quite to lose itself; she promised,\r\nhowever, to think till supper of where, with the world all before them,\r\nthey might go--supper having been ordered for such time as permitted of\r\nlighted candles. It had been agreed between them that lighted candles\r\nat wayside inns, in strange countries, amid mountain scenery, gave the\r\nevening meal a peculiar poetry--such being the mild adventures, the\r\nrefinements of impression, that they, as they would have said, went in\r\nfor. It was now as if, before this repast, Milly had designed to "lie\r\ndown"; but at the end of three minutes more she was not lying down, she\r\nwas saying instead, abruptly, with a transition that was like a jump of\r\nfour thousand miles: "What was it that, in New York, on the ninth, when\r\nyou saw him alone, Dr. Finch said to you?"\r\n\r\nIt was not till later that Mrs. Stringham fully knew why the question\r\nhad startled her still more than its suddenness explained; though the\r\neffect of it even at the moment was almost to frighten her into a false\r\nanswer. She had to think, to remember the occasion, the "ninth," in New\r\nYork, the time she had seen Dr. Finch alone, and to recall what he had\r\nthen said to her; and when everything had come back it was quite, at\r\nfirst, for a moment, as if he had said something that immensely\r\nmattered. He hadn\'t, however, in fact; it was only as if he might\r\nperhaps after all have been going to. It was on the sixth--within ten\r\ndays of their sailing--that she had hurried from Boston under the\r\nalarm, a small but a sufficient shock, of hearing that Mildred had\r\nsuddenly been taken ill, had had, from some obscure cause, such an\r\nupset as threatened to stay their journey. The bearing of the accident\r\nhad happily soon announced itself as slight, and there had been, in the\r\nevent, but a few hours of anxiety; the journey had been pronounced\r\nagain not only possible, but, as representing "change," highly\r\nadvisable; and if the zealous guest had had five minutes by herself\r\nwith the doctor, that was, clearly, no more at his instance than at her\r\nown. Almost nothing had passed between them but an easy exchange of\r\nenthusiasms in respect to the remedial properties of "Europe"; and this\r\nassurance, as the facts came back to her, she was now able to give.\r\n"Nothing whatever, on my word of honour, that you mayn\'t know or\r\nmightn\'t then have known. I\'ve no secret with him about you. What makes\r\nyou suspect it? I don\'t quite make out how you know I did see him\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"No--you never told me," said Milly. "And I don\'t mean," she went on,\r\n"during the twenty-four hours while I was bad, when your putting your\r\nheads together was natural enough. I mean after I was better--the last\r\nthing before you went home."\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham continued to wonder. "Who told you I saw him then?"\r\n\r\n_"He_ didn\'t himself--nor did you write me it afterwards. We speak of\r\nit now for the first time. That\'s exactly why!" Milly declared--with\r\nsomething in her face and voice that, the next moment, betrayed for her\r\ncompanion that she had really known nothing, had only conjectured and,\r\nchancing her charge, made a hit. Yet why had her mind been busy with\r\nthe question? "But if you\'re not, as you now assure me, in his\r\nconfidence," she smiled, "it\'s no matter."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in his confidence, and he had nothing to confide. But are you\r\nfeeling unwell?"\r\n\r\nThe elder woman was earnest for the truth, though the possibility she\r\nnamed was not at all the one that seemed to fit--witness the long climb\r\nMilly had just indulged in. The girl showed her constant white face,\r\nbut that her friends had all learned to discount, and it was often\r\nbrightest when superficially not bravest. She continued for a little\r\nmysteriously to smile. "I don\'t know--haven\'t really the least idea.\r\nBut it might be well to find out."\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham, at this, flared into sympathy. "Are you in trouble--in\r\npain?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least little bit. But I sometimes wonder----!"\r\n\r\n"Yes"--she pressed: "wonder what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, if I shall have much of it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham stared. "Much of what? Not of pain?"\r\n\r\n"Of everything. Of everything I have."\r\n\r\nAnxiously again, tenderly, our friend cast about. "You \'have\'\r\neverything; so that when you say \'much\' of it----"\r\n\r\n"I only mean," the girl broke in, "shall I have it for long? That is if\r\nI _have_ got it."\r\n\r\nShe had at present the effect, a little, of confounding, or at least of\r\nperplexing her comrade, who was touched, who was always touched, by\r\nsomething helpless in her grace and abrupt in her turns, and yet\r\nactually half made out in her a sort of mocking light. "If you\'ve got\r\nan ailment?"\r\n\r\n"If I\'ve got everything," Milly laughed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, _that_--like almost nobody else."\r\n\r\n"Then for how long?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham\'s eyes entreated her; she had gone close to her, half\r\nenclosed her with urgent arms. "Do you want to see some one?" And then\r\nas the girl only met it with a slow headshake, though looking perhaps a\r\nshade more conscious: "We\'ll go straight to the best near doctor." This\r\ntoo, however, produced but a gaze of qualified assent and a silence,\r\nsweet and vague, that left everything open. Our friend decidedly lost\r\nherself. "Tell me, for God\'s sake, if you\'re in distress."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'ve really _everything,"_ Milly said as if to\r\nexplain--and as if also to put it pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"But what on earth can I do for you?" The girl hesitated, then seemed\r\non the point of being able to say; but suddenly changed and expressed\r\nherself otherwise. "Dear, dear thing--I\'m only too happy!"\r\n\r\nIt brought them closer, but it rather confirmed Mrs. Stringham\'s doubt.\r\n"Then what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the matter--that I can scarcely bear it."\r\n\r\n"But what is it you think you haven\'t got?"\r\n\r\nMilly waited another moment; then she found it, and found for it a dim\r\nshow of joy. "The power to resist the bliss of what I _have!"_\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham took it in--her sense of being "put off" with it, the\r\npossible, probable irony of it--and her tenderness renewed itself in\r\nthe positive grimness of a long murmur. "Whom will you see?"--for it\r\nwas as if they looked down from their height at a continent of doctors.\r\n"Where will you first go?"\r\n\r\nMilly had for the third time her air of consideration; but she came\r\nback with it to her plea of some minutes before. "I\'ll tell you at\r\nsupper--good-bye till then." And she left the room with a lightness\r\nthat testified for her companion to something that again particularly\r\npleased her in the renewed promise of motion. The odd passage just\r\nconcluded, Mrs. Stringham mused as she once more sat alone with a\r\nhooked needle and a ball of silk, the "fine" work with which she was\r\nalways provided--this mystifying mood had simply been precipitated, no\r\ndoubt, by their prolonged halt, with which the girl hadn\'t really been\r\nin sympathy. One had only to admit that her complaint was in fact but\r\nthe excess of the joy of life, and everything _did_ then fit. She\r\ncouldn\'t stop for the joy, but she could go on for it, and with the\r\nsense of going on she floated again, was restored to her great spaces.\r\nThere was no evasion of any truth--so at least Susan Shepherd hoped--in\r\none\'s sitting there while the twilight deepened and feeling still more\r\nfinely that the position of this young lady was magnificent. The\r\nevening at that height had naturally turned to cold, and the travellers\r\nhad bespoken a fire with their meal; the great Alpine road asserted its\r\nbrave presence through the small panes of the low, clean windows, with\r\nincidents at the inn-door, the yellow _diligence,_ the great waggons,\r\nthe hurrying, hooded, private conveyances, reminders, for our fanciful\r\nfriend, of old stories, old pictures, historic flights, escapes,\r\npursuits, things that had happened, things indeed that by a sort of\r\nstrange congruity helped her to read the meanings of the greatest\r\ninterest into the relation in which she was now so deeply involved. It\r\nwas natural that this record of the magnificence of her companion\'s\r\nposition should strike her as, after all, the best meaning she could\r\nextract; for she herself was seated in the magnificence as in a\r\ncourt-carriage--she came back to that, and such a method of\r\nprogression, such a view from crimson cushions, would evidently have a\r\ngreat deal more to give. By the time the candles were lighted for\r\nsupper and the short, white curtains were drawn, Milly had reappeared,\r\nand the little scenic room had then all its romance. That charm\r\nmoreover was far from broken by the words in which she, without further\r\nloss of time, satisfied her patient mate. "I want to go straight to\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\nIt was unexpected, corresponding with no view positively taken at their\r\ndeparture; when England had appeared, on the contrary, rather relegated\r\nand postponed--seen for the moment, as who should say, at the end of an\r\navenue of preparations and introductions. London, in short, might have\r\nbeen supposed to be the crown, and to be achieved like a siege by\r\ngradual approaches. Milly\'s actual fine stride was therefore the more\r\nexciting, as any simplification almost always was to Mrs. Stringham;\r\nwho, besides, was afterwards to recall as the very beginning of a drama\r\nthe terms in which, between their smoky candles, the girl had put her\r\npreference and in which still other things had come up, come while the\r\nclank of waggon-chains in the sharp air reached their ears, with the\r\nstamp of hoofs, the rattle of buckets and the foreign questions,\r\nforeign answers, that were all alike a part of the cheery converse of\r\nthe road. The girl brought it out in truth as she might have brought a\r\nhuge confession, something she admitted herself shy about and that\r\nwould seem to show her as frivolous; it had rolled over her that what\r\nshe wanted of Europe was "people," so far as they were to be had, and\r\nthat if her friend really wished to know, the vision of this same\r\nequivocal quantity was what had haunted her during their previous days,\r\nin museums and churches, and what was again spoiling for her the pure\r\ntaste of scenery. She was all for scenery--yes; but she wanted it human\r\nand personal, and all she could say was that there would be in\r\nLondon--wouldn\'t there? more of that kind than anywhere else. She came\r\nback to her idea that if it wasn\'t for long--if nothing should happen\r\nto be so for _her_--why, the particular thing she spoke of would\r\nprobably have most to give her in the time, would probably be less than\r\nanything else a waste of her remainder. She produced this last\r\nconsideration indeed with such gaiety that Mrs. Stringham was not again\r\ndisconcerted by it, was in fact quite ready--if talk of early dying was\r\nin order--to match it from her own future. Good, then; they would, eat\r\nand drink because of what might happen to-morrow; and they would direct\r\ntheir course from that moment with a view to such eating and drinking.\r\nThey ate and drank that night, in truth, as if in the spirit of this\r\ndecision; whereby the air, before they separated, felt itself the\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\nIt had cleared perhaps to a view only too extensive--extensive, that\r\nis, in proportion to the signs of life presented. The idea of "people"\r\nwas not so entertained on Milly\'s part as to connect itself with\r\nparticular persons, and the fact remained for each of the ladies that\r\nthey would, completely unknown, disembark at Dover amid the completely\r\nunknowing. They had no relation already formed; this plea Mrs.\r\nStringham put forward to see what it would produce. It produced nothing\r\nat first but the observation on the girl\'s side that what she had in\r\nmind was no thought of society nor of scraping acquaintance; nothing\r\nwas further from her than to desire the opportunities represented for\r\nthe compatriot in general by a trunkful of "letters." It wasn\'t a\r\nquestion, in short, of the people the compatriot was after; it was the\r\nhuman, the English picture itself, as they might see it in their own\r\nway--the world imagined always in what one had read and dreamed. Mrs.\r\nStringham did every justice to this world, but when later on an\r\noccasion chanced to present itself, she made a point of not omitting to\r\nremark that it might be a comfort to know in advance even an\r\nindividual. This still, however, failed in vulgar parlance, to "fetch"\r\nMilly, so that she had presently to go all the way. "Haven\'t I\r\nunderstood from you, for that matter, that you gave Mr. Densher\r\nsomething of a promise?"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment, on this, when Milly\'s look had to be taken as\r\nrepresenting one of two things--either that she was completely vague\r\nabout the promise or that Mr. Densher\'s name itself started no train.\r\nBut she really couldn\'t be so vague about the promise, her\r\ninterlocutress quickly saw, without attaching it to something; it had\r\nto be a promise to somebody in particular to be so repudiated. In the\r\nevent, accordingly, she acknowledged Mr. Merton Densher, the so\r\nunusually clever young Englishman who had made his appearance in New\r\nYork on some special literary business--wasn\'t it?--shortly before\r\ntheir departure, and who had been three or four times in her house\r\nduring the brief period between her visit to Boston and her companion\'s\r\nsubsequent stay with her; but she required much reminding before it\r\ncame back to her that she had mentioned to this companion just\r\nafterwards the confidence expressed by the personage in question in her\r\nnever doing so dire a thing as to come to London without, as the phrase\r\nwas, looking a fellow up. She had left him the enjoyment of his\r\nconfidence, the form of which might have appeared a trifle free--that\r\nshe now reasserted; she had done nothing either to impair or to enhance\r\nit; but she had also left Mrs. Stringham, in the connection and at the\r\ntime, rather sorry to have missed Mr. Densher. She had thought of him\r\nagain after that, the elder woman; she had likewise gone so far as to\r\nnotice that Milly appeared not to have done so--which the girl might\r\neasily have betrayed; and, interested as she was in everything that\r\nconcerned her, she had made out for herself, for herself only and\r\nrather idly, that, but for interruptions, the young Englishman might\r\nhave become a better acquaintance. His being an acquaintance at all was\r\none of the signs that in the first days had helped to place Milly, as a\r\nyoung person with the world before her, for sympathy and wonder.\r\nIsolated, unmothered, unguarded, but with her other strong marks, her\r\nbig house, her big fortune, her big freedom, she had lately begun to\r\n"receive," for all her few years, as an older woman might have done--as\r\nwas done, precisely, by princesses who had public considerations to\r\nobserve and who came of age very early. If it was thus distinct to Mrs.\r\nStringham then that Mr. Densher had gone off somewhere else in\r\nconnection with his errand before her visit to New York, it had been\r\nalso not undiscoverable that he had come back for a day or two later\r\non, that is after her own second excursion--that he had in fine\r\nreappeared on a single occasion on his way to the West: his way from\r\nWashington as she believed, though he was out of sight at the time of\r\nher joining her friend for their departure. It had not occurred to her\r\nbefore to exaggerate--it had not occurred to her that she could; but\r\nshe seemed to become aware to-night that there had been just enough in\r\nthis relation to meet, to provoke, the free conception of a little more.\r\n\r\nShe presently put it that, at any rate, promise or no promise, Milly\r\nwould, at a pinch, be able, in London, to act on his permission to make\r\nhim a sign; to which Milly replied with readiness that her ability,\r\nthough evident, would be none the less quite wasted, inasmuch as the\r\ngentleman would, to a certainty, be still in America. He had a great\r\ndeal to do there--which he would scarce have begun; and in fact she\r\nmight very well not have thought of London at all if she hadn\'t been\r\nsure he wasn\'t yet near coming back. It was perceptible to her\r\ncompanion that the moment our young woman had so far committed herself\r\nshe had a sense of having overstepped; which was not quite patched up\r\nby her saying the next minute, possibly with a certain failure of\r\npresence of mind, that the last thing she desired was the air of\r\nrunning after him. Mrs. Stringham wondered privately what question\r\nthere could be of any such appearance--the danger of which thus\r\nsuddenly came up; but she said, for the time, nothing of it--she only\r\nsaid other things: one of which was, for instance, that if Mr. Densher\r\nwas away he was away, and that this was the end of it; also that of\r\ncourse they must be discreet at any price. But what was the measure of\r\ndiscretion, and how was one to be sure? So it was that, as they sat\r\nthere, she produced her own case: _she_ had a possible tie with London,\r\nwhich she desired as little to disown as she might wish to risk\r\npresuming on it. She treated her companion, in short, for their\r\nevening\'s end, to the story of Maud Manningham, the odd but interesting\r\nEnglish girl who had formed her special affinity in the old days at the\r\nVevey school; whom she had written to, after their separation, with a\r\nregularity that had at first faltered and then altogether failed, yet\r\nthat had been for the time quite a fine case of crude constancy; so\r\nthat it had in fact flickered up again of itself on the occasion of the\r\nmarriage of each. They had then once more fondly, scrupulously\r\nwritten--Mrs. Lowder first; and even another letter or two had\r\nafterwards passed. This, however, had been the end--though with no\r\nrupture, only a gentle drop: Maud Manningham had made, she believed, a\r\ngreat marriage, while she herself had made a small; on top of which,\r\nmoreover, distance, difference, diminished community and impossible\r\nreunion had done the rest of the work. It was but after all these years\r\nthat reunion had begun to show as possible--if the other party to it,\r\nthat is, should be still in existence. That was exactly what it now\r\nstruck our friend as interesting to ascertain, as, with one aid and\r\nanother, she believed she might. It was an experiment she would at all\r\nevents now make if Milly didn\'t object.\r\n\r\nMilly in general objected to nothing, and, though she asked a question\r\nor two, she raised no present plea. Her questions--or at least her own\r\nanswers to them--kindled, on Mrs. Stringham\'s part, a backward train:\r\nshe hadn\'t known till tonight how much she remembered, or how fine it\r\nmight be to see what had become of large, high-coloured Maud, florid,\r\nexotic and alien--which had been just the spell--even to the\r\nperceptions of youth. There was the danger--she frankly touched\r\nit--that such a temperament mightn\'t have matured, with the years, all\r\nin the sense of fineness; it was the sort of danger that, in renewing\r\nrelations after long breaks, one had always to look in the face. To\r\ngather in strayed threads was to take a risk--for which, however, she\r\nwas prepared if Milly was. The possible "fun," she confessed, was by\r\nitself rather tempting; and she fairly sounded, with this--wound up a\r\nlittle as she was--the note of fun as the harmless final right of fifty\r\nyears of mere New England virtue. Among the things she was afterwards\r\nto recall was the indescribable look dropped on her, at this, by her\r\ncompanion; she was still seated there between the candles and before\r\nthe finished supper, while Milly moved about, and the look was long to\r\nfigure for her as an inscrutable comment on _her_ notion of freedom.\r\nChallenged, at any rate, as for the last wise word, Milly showed\r\nperhaps, musingly, charmingly, that, though her attention had been\r\nmainly soundless, her friend\'s story--produced as a resource\r\nunsuspected, a card from up the sleeve--half surprised, half beguiled\r\nher. Since the matter, such as it was, depended on that, she brought\r\nout, before she went to bed, an easy, a light "Risk everything!"\r\n\r\nThis quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny weight to Maud\r\nLowder\'s evoked presence--as Susan Stringham, still sitting up, became,\r\nin excited reflection, a trifle more conscious. Something determinant,\r\nwhen the girl had left her, took place in her--nameless but, as soon as\r\nshe had given way, coercive. It was as if she knew again, in this\r\nfulness of time, that she had been, after Maud\'s marriage, just\r\nsensibly outlived or, as people nowadays said, shunted. Mrs. Lowder had\r\nleft her behind, and on the occasion, subsequently, of the\r\ncorresponding date in her own life--not the second, the sad one, with\r\nits dignity of sadness, but the first, with the meagreness of its\r\nsupposed felicity--she had been, in the same spirit, almost\r\npatronisingly pitied. If that suspicion, even when it had ceased to\r\nmatter, had never quite died out for her, there was doubtless some\r\noddity in its now offering itself as a link, rather than as another\r\nbreak, in the chain; and indeed there might well have been for her a\r\nmood in which the notion of the development of patronage in her quondam\r\nschoolmate would have settled her question in another sense. It was\r\nactually settled--if the case be worth our analysis--by the happy\r\nconsummation, the poetic justice, the generous revenge, of her having\r\nat last something to show. Maud, on their parting company, had appeared\r\nto have so much, and would now--for wasn\'t it also, in general, quite\r\nthe rich law of English life?--have, with accretions, promotions,\r\nexpansions, ever so much more. Very good; such things might be; she\r\nrose to the sense of being ready for them. Whatever Mrs. Lowder might\r\nhave to show--and one hoped one did the presumptions all justice--she\r\nwould have nothing like Milly Theale, who constituted the trophy\r\nproducible by poor Susan. Poor Susan lingered late--till the candles\r\nwere low, and as soon as the table was cleared she opened her neat\r\nportfolio. She had not lost the old clue; there were connections she\r\nremembered, addresses she could try; so the thing was to begin. She\r\nwrote on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOURTH\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt had all gone so fast after this that Milly uttered but the truth\r\nnearest to hand in saying to the gentleman on her right--who was, by\r\nthe same token, the gentleman on her hostess\'s left--that she scarce\r\neven then knew where she was: the words marking her first full sense of\r\na situation really romantic. They were already dining, she and her\r\nfriend, at Lancaster Gate, and surrounded, as it seemed to her, with\r\nevery English accessory; though her consciousness of Mrs. Lowder\'s\r\nexistence, and still more of her remarkable identity, had been of so\r\nrecent and so sudden a birth. Susie, as she was apt to call her\r\ncompanion for a lighter change, had only had to wave a neat little wand\r\nfor the fairy-tale to begin at once; in consequence of which Susie now\r\nglittered--for, with Mrs. Stringham\'s new sense of success, it came to\r\nthat--in the character of a fairy godmother. Milly had almost insisted\r\non dressing her, for the present occasion, as one; and it was no fault\r\nof the girl\'s if the good lady had not now appeared in a peaked hat, a\r\nshort petticoat and diamond shoe-buckles, brandishing the magic crutch.\r\nThe good lady, in truth, bore herself not less contentedly than if\r\nthese insignia had marked her work; and Milly\'s observation to Lord\r\nMark had just been, doubtless, the result of such a light exchange of\r\nlooks with her as even the great length of the table had not baffled.\r\nThere were twenty persons between them, but this sustained passage was\r\nthe sharpest sequel yet to that other comparison of views during the\r\npause on the Swiss pass. It almost appeared to Milly that their fortune\r\nhad been unduly precipitated--as if, properly, they were in the\r\nposition of having ventured on a small joke and found the answer out of\r\nproportion grave. She could not at this moment, for instance, have said\r\nwhether, with her quickened perceptions, she were more enlivened or\r\noppressed; and the case might in fact have been serious had she not, by\r\ngood fortune, from the moment the picture loomed, quickly made up her\r\nmind that what finally most concerned her was neither to seek nor to\r\nshirk, was not even to wonder too much, but was to let things come as\r\nthey would, since there was little enough doubt of how they would go.\r\n\r\nLord Mark had been brought to her before dinner--not by Mrs. Lowder,\r\nbut by the handsome girl, that lady\'s niece, who was now at the other\r\nend and on the same side as Susie; he had taken her in, and she meant\r\npresently to ask him about Miss Croy, the handsome girl, actually\r\noffered to her sight--though now in a splendid way--but for the second\r\ntime. The first time had been the occasion--only three days before--of\r\nher calling at their hotel with her aunt and then making, for our other\r\ntwo heroines, a great impression of beauty and eminence. This\r\nimpression had remained so with Milly that, at present, and although\r\nher attention was aware at the same time of everything else, her eyes\r\nwere mainly engaged with Kate Croy when not engaged with Susie. That\r\nwonderful creature\'s eyes moreover readily met them--she ranked now as\r\na wonderful creature; and it seemed a part of the swift prosperity of\r\nthe American visitors that, so little in the original reckoning, she\r\nshould yet appear conscious, charmingly, frankly conscious, of\r\npossibilities of friendship for them. Milly had easily and, as a guest,\r\ngracefully generalised: English girls had a special, strong beauty, and\r\nit particularly showed in evening dress--above all when, as was\r\nstrikingly the case with this one, the dress itself was what it should\r\nbe. That observation she had all ready for Lord Mark when they should,\r\nafter a little, get round to it. She seemed even now to see that there\r\nmight be a good deal they would get round to; the indication being\r\nthat, taken up once for all with her other neighbour, their hostess\r\nwould leave them much to themselves. Mrs. Lowder\'s other neighbour was\r\nthe Bishop of Murrum--a real bishop, such as Milly had never seen, with\r\na complicated costume, a voice like an old-fashioned wind instrument,\r\nand a face all the portrait of a prelate; while the gentleman on our\r\nyoung lady\'s left, a gentleman thick-necked, large and literal, who\r\nlooked straight before him and as if he were not to be diverted by vain\r\nwords from that pursuit, clearly counted as an offset to the possession\r\nof Lord Mark. As Milly made out these things--with a shade of\r\nexhilaration at the way she already fell in--she saw how she was\r\njustified of her plea for people and her love of life. It wasn\'t then,\r\nas the prospect seemed to show, so difficult to get into the current,\r\nor to stand, at any rate, on the bank. It was easy to get near--if they\r\n_were_ near; and yet the elements were different enough from any of her\r\nold elements, and positively rich and strange.\r\n\r\nShe asked herself if her right-hand neighbour would understand what she\r\nmeant by such a description of them, should she throw it off; but\r\nanother of the things to which, precisely, her sense was awakened was\r\nthat no, decidedly, he wouldn\'t. It was nevertheless by this time open\r\nto her that his line would be to be clever; and indeed, evidently, no\r\nlittle of the interest was going to be in the fresh reference and fresh\r\neffect both of people\'s cleverness and of their simplicity. She\r\nthrilled, she consciously flushed, and turned pale with the\r\ncertitude--it had never been so present--that she should find herself\r\ncompletely involved: the very air of the place, the pitch of the\r\noccasion, had for her so positive a taste and so deep an undertone. The\r\nsmallest things, the faces, the hands, the jewels of the women, the\r\nsound of words, especially of names, across the table, the shape of the\r\nforks, the arrangement of the flowers, the attitude of the servants,\r\nthe walls of the room, were all touches in a picture and denotements in\r\na play; and they marked for her, moreover, her alertness of vision. She\r\nhad never, she might well believe, been in such a state of vibration;\r\nher sensibility was almost too sharp for her comfort: there were, for\r\nexample, more indications than she could reduce to order in the manner\r\nof the friendly niece, who struck her as distinguished and interesting,\r\nas in fact surprisingly genial. This young woman\'s type had, visibly,\r\nother possibilities; yet here, of its own free movement, it had already\r\nsketched a relation. Were they, Miss Croy and she, to take up the tale\r\nwhere their two elders had left it off so many years before?--were they\r\nto find they liked each other and to try for themselves if a scheme of\r\nconstancy on more modern lines could be worked? She had doubted, as\r\nthey came to England, of Maud Manningham, had believed her a broken\r\nreed and a vague resource, had seen their dependence on her as a state\r\nof mind that would have been shamefully silly--so far as it _was_\r\ndependence--had they wished to do any thing so inane as "get into\r\nsociety." To have made their pilgrimage all for the sake of such\r\nsociety as Mrs. Lowder might have in reserve for them--that didn\'t bear\r\nthinking of at all, and she herself had quite chosen her course for\r\ncuriosity about other matters. She would have described this curiosity\r\nas a desire to see the places she had read about, and _that_\r\ndescription of her motive she was prepared to give her neighbour--even\r\nthough, as a consequence of it, he should find how little she had read.\r\nIt was almost at present as if her poor prevision had been rebuked by\r\nthe majesty--she could scarcely call it less--of the event, or at all\r\nevents by the commanding character of the two figures--she could\r\nscarcely call _that_ less either--mainly presented. Mrs. Lowder and her\r\nniece, however dissimilar, had at least in common that each was a great\r\nreality. That was true, primarily, of the aunt--so true that Milly\r\nwondered how her own companion had arrived, in other days, at so odd an\r\nalliance; yet she none the less felt Mrs. Lowder as a person of whom\r\nthe mind might in two or three days roughly make the circuit. She would\r\nsit there massive, at least, while one attempted it; whereas Miss Croy,\r\nthe handsome girl, would indulge in incalculable movements that might\r\ninterfere with one\'s tour. She was real, none the less, and everything\r\nand everybody were real; and it served them right, no doubt, the pair\r\nof them, for having rushed into their adventure.\r\n\r\nLord Mark\'s intelligence meanwhile, however, had met her own quite\r\nsufficiently to enable him to tell her how little he could clear up her\r\nsituation. He explained, for that matter--or at least he hinted--that\r\nthere was no such thing, to-day in London, as saying where any one was.\r\nEvery one was everywhere--nobody was anywhere. He should be put to\r\nit--yes, frankly--to give a name of any sort or kind to their hostess\'s\r\n"set." _Was_ it a set at all, or wasn\'t it, and were there not really\r\nno such things as sets, in the place, any more?--was there any thing\r\nbut the senseless shifting tumble, like that of some great greasy sea\r\nin mid-Channel, of an overwhelming melted mixture? He threw out the\r\nquestion, which seemed large; Milly felt that at the end of five\r\nminutes he had thrown out a great many, though he followed none more\r\nthan a step or two; perhaps he would prove suggestive, but he helped\r\nher as yet to no discriminations: he spoke as if he had given them up\r\nfrom too much knowledge. He was thus at the opposite extreme from\r\nherself, but, as a consequence of it, also wandering and lost; and he\r\nwas furthermore, for all his temporary incoherence, to which she\r\nguessed there would be some key, as great a reality as either Mrs.\r\nLowder or Kate. The only light in which he placed the former of these\r\nladies was that of an extraordinary woman--a most extraordinary woman,\r\nand "the more extraordinary the more one knows her," while of the\r\nlatter he said nothing, for the moment, but that she was tremendously,\r\nyes, quite tremendously, good-looking. It was some time, she thought,\r\nbefore his talk showed his cleverness, and yet each minute she believed\r\nin it more, quite apart from what her hostess had told her on first\r\nnaming him. Perhaps he was one of the cases she had heard of at\r\nhome--those characteristic cases of people in England who concealed\r\ntheir play of mind so much more than they showed it. Even Mr. Densher a\r\nlittle did that. And what made Lord Mark, at any rate, so real either,\r\nwhen this was a thing he so definitely insisted on? His type some how,\r\nas by a life, a need, an intention of its own, insisted _for_ him; but\r\nthat was all. It was difficult to guess his age--whether he were a\r\nyoung man who looked old or an old man who looked young; it seemed to\r\nprove nothing, as against other things, that he was bald and, as might\r\nhave been said, slightly stale, or, more delicately perhaps, dry: there\r\nwas such a fine little fidget of preoccupied life in him, and his eyes,\r\nat moments--though it was an appearance they could suddenly lose--were\r\nas candid and clear as those of a pleasant boy. Very neat, very light,\r\nand so fair that there was little other indication of his moustache\r\nthan his constantly feeling it--which was again boyish--he would have\r\naffected her as the most intellectual person present if he had not\r\naffected her as the most frivolous. The latter quality was rather in\r\nhis look than in anything else, though he constantly wore his double\r\neyeglass, which was, much more, Bostonian and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThe idea of his frivolity had, no doubt, to do with his personal\r\ndesignation, which represented--as yet, for our young woman, a little\r\nconfusedly--a connection with an historic patriciate, a class that, in\r\nturn, also confusedly, represented an affinity with a social element\r\nthat she had never heard otherwise described than as "fashion." The\r\nsupreme social element in New York had never known itself but as\r\nreduced to that category, and though Milly was aware that, as applied\r\nto a territorial and political aristocracy, the label was probably too\r\nsimple, she had for the time none other at hand. She presently, it is\r\ntrue, enriched her idea with the perception that her interlocutor was\r\nindifferent; yet this, indifferent as aristocracies notoriously were,\r\nsaw her but little further, inasmuch as she felt that, in the first\r\nplace, he would much rather get on with her than not, and in the second\r\nwas only thinking of too many matters of his own. If he kept her in\r\nview on the one hand and kept so much else on the other--the way he\r\ncrumbed up his bread was a proof--why did he hover before her as a\r\npotentially insolent noble? She couldn\'t have answered the question,\r\nand it was precisely one of those that swarmed. They were complicated,\r\nshe might fairly have said, by his visibly knowing, having known from\r\nafar off, that she was a stranger and an American, and by his none the\r\nless making no more of it than if she and her like were the chief of\r\nhis diet. He took her, kindly enough, but imperturbably, irreclaimably,\r\nfor granted, and it wouldn\'t in the least help that she herself knew\r\nhim, as quickly, for having been in her country and threshed it out.\r\nThere would be nothing for her to explain or attenuate or brag about;\r\nshe could neither escape nor prevail by her strangeness; he would have,\r\nfor that matter, on such a subject, more to tell her than to learn from\r\nher. She might learn from _him_ why she was so different from the\r\nhandsome girl--which she didn\'t know, being merely able to feel it; or\r\nat any rate might learn from him why the handsome girl was so different\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nOn these lines, however, they would move later; the lines immediately\r\nlaid down were, in spite of his vagueness for his own convenience,\r\ndefinite enough. She was already, he observed to her, thinking what she\r\nshould say on her other side--which was what Americans were always\r\ndoing. She needn\'t in conscience say anything at all; but Americans\r\nnever knew that, nor ever, poor creatures, yes (_she_ had interposed\r\nthe "poor creatures!") what not to do. The burdens they took on--the\r\nthings, positively, they made an affair of! This easy and, after all,\r\nfriendly jibe at her race was really for her, on her new friend\'s part,\r\nthe note of personal recognition so far as she required it; and she\r\ngave him a prompt and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting\r\nthat her desire to be, herself, "lovely" all round was justly founded\r\non the lovely way Mrs. Lowder had met her. He was directly interested\r\nin that, and it was not till afterwards that she fully knew how much\r\nmore information about their friend he had taken than given. Here\r\nagain, for instance, was a pertinent note for her: she had, on the\r\nspot, with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a society\r\nconstituted from far back, encountered the interesting phenomenon of\r\ncomplicated, of possibly sinister motive. However, Maud Manningham (her\r\nname, even in her presence, somehow still fed the fancy) _had,_ all the\r\nsame, been lovely, and one was going to meet her now quite as far on as\r\none had one\'s self been met. She had been with them at their\r\nhotel--they were a pair--before even they had supposed she could have\r\ngot their letter. Of course indeed they had written in advance, but\r\nthey had followed that up very fast. She had thus engaged them to dine\r\nbut two days later, and on the morrow again, without waiting for a\r\nreturn visit, waiting for anything, she had called with her niece. It\r\nwas as if she really cared for them, and it was magnificent\r\nfidelity--fidelity to Mrs. Stringham, her own companion and Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s former schoolmate, the lady with the charming face and the\r\nrather high dress down there at the end.\r\n\r\nLord Mark took in through his nippers these balanced attributes of\r\nSusie. "But isn\'t Mrs. Stringham\'s fidelity then equally magnificent?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a beautiful sentiment; but it isn\'t as if she had anything\r\nto _give."_\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t she got you?" Lord Mark presently asked.\r\n\r\n"Me--to give Mrs. Lowder?" Milly had clearly not yet seen herself in\r\nthe light of such an offering. "Oh, I\'m rather a poor present; and I\r\ndon\'t feel as if, even at that, I\'ve as yet quite been given."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been shown, and if our friend has jumped at you it comes to the\r\nsame thing." He made his jokes, Lord Mark, without amusement for\r\nhimself; yet it wasn\'t that he was grim. "To be seen you must\r\nrecognise, _is,_ for you, to be jumped at; and, if it\'s a question of\r\nbeing shown, here you are again. Only it has now been taken out of your\r\nfriend\'s hands; it\'s Mrs. Lowder, already, who\'s getting the benefit.\r\nLook round the table and you\'ll make out, I think, that you\'re being,\r\nfrom top to bottom, jumped at."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Milly, "I seem also to feel that I like it better\r\nthan being made fun of."\r\n\r\nIt was one of the things she afterwards saw--Milly was for ever seeing\r\nthings afterwards--that her companion had here had some way of his own,\r\nquite unlike any one\'s else, of assuring her of his consideration. She\r\nwondered how he had done it, for he had neither apologised nor\r\nprotested. She said to herself, at any rate, that he had led her on;\r\nand what was most odd was the question by which he had done so. "Does\r\nshe know much about you?"\r\n\r\n"No, she just likes us."\r\n\r\nEven for this his travelled lordship, seasoned and saturated, had no\r\nlaugh. "I mean _you_ particularly. Has that lady with the charming\r\nface, which _is_ charming, told her?"\r\n\r\nMilly hesitated. "Told her what?"\r\n\r\n"Everything."\r\n\r\nThis, with the way he dropped it, again considerably moved her--made\r\nher feel for a moment that, as a matter of course, she was a subject\r\nfor disclosures. But she quickly found her answer. "Oh, as for that,\r\nyou must ask _her."_\r\n\r\n"Your clever companion?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lowder."\r\n\r\nHe replied to this that their hostess was a person with whom there were\r\ncertain liberties one never took, but that he was none the less fairly\r\nupheld, inasmuch as she was for the most part kind to him and as,\r\nshould he be very good for a while, she would probably herself tell\r\nhim. "And I shall have, at any rate, in the meantime, the interest of\r\nseeing what she does with you. That will teach me more or less, you\r\nsee, how much she knows."\r\n\r\nMilly followed this--it was lucid; but it suggested something apart.\r\n"How much does she know about _you?"_\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Lord Mark serenely. "But that doesn\'t matter--for what\r\nshe does with me." And then, as to anticipate Milly\'s question about\r\nthe nature of such doing: "This, for instance--turning me straight on\r\nfor _you."_\r\n\r\nThe girl thought. "And you mean she wouldn\'t if she did know----?"\r\n\r\nHe met it as if it were really a point. "No. I believe, to do her\r\njustice, she still would. So you can be easy."\r\n\r\nMilly had the next instant, then, acted on the permission. "Because\r\nyou\'re even at the worst the best thing she has?"\r\n\r\nWith this he was at last amused. "I was till you came. You\'re the best\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nIt was strange his words should have given her the sense of his\r\nknowing, but it was positive that they did so, and to the extent of\r\nmaking her believe them, though still with wonder. That, really, from\r\nthis first of their meetings, was what was most to abide with her: she\r\naccepted almost helplessly, she surrendered to the inevitability of\r\nbeing the sort of thing, as he might have said, that he at least\r\nthoroughly believed he had, in going about, seen here enough of for all\r\npractical purposes. Her submission was naturally, moreover, not to be\r\nimpaired by her learning later on that he had paid at short intervals,\r\nthough at a time apparently just previous to her own emergence from the\r\nobscurity of extreme youth, three separate visits to New York, where\r\nhis nameable friends and his contrasted contacts had been numerous. His\r\nimpression, his recollection of the whole mixed quantity, was still\r\nvisibly rich. It had helped him to place her, and she was more and more\r\nsharply conscious of having--as with the door sharply slammed upon her\r\nand the guard\'s hand raised in signal to the train--been popped into\r\nthe compartment in which she was to travel for him. It was a use of her\r\nthat many a girl would have been doubtless quick to resent; and the\r\nkind of mind that thus, in our young lady, made all for mere seeing and\r\ntaking is precisely one of the charms of our subject. Milly had\r\npractically just learned from him, had made out, as it were, from her\r\nrumbling compartment, that he gave her the highest place among their\r\nfriend\'s actual properties. She was a success, that was what it came\r\nto, he presently assured her, and that was what it was to be a success:\r\nit always happened before one could know it. One\'s ignorance was in\r\nfact often the greatest part of it. "You haven\'t had time yet," he\r\nsaid; "this is nothing. But you\'ll see. You\'ll see everything. You can,\r\nyou know--everything you dream of."\r\n\r\nHe made her more and more wonder; she almost felt as if he were showing\r\nher visions while he spoke; and strangely enough, though it was visions\r\nthat had drawn her on, she hadn\'t seen them in connection--that is in\r\nsuch preliminary and necessary connection--with such a face as Lord\r\nMark\'s, such eyes and such a voice, such a tone and such a manner. He\r\nhad for an instant the effect of making her ask herself if she were\r\nafter all going to be afraid; so distinct was it for fifty seconds that\r\na fear passed over her. There they were again--yes, certainly: Susie\'s\r\noverture to Mrs. Lowder had been their joke, but they had pressed in\r\nthat gaiety an electric bell that continued to sound. Positively, while\r\nshe sat there, she had the loud rattle in her ears, and she wondered,\r\nduring these moments, why the others didn\'t hear it. They didn\'t stare,\r\nthey didn\'t smile, and the fear in her that I speak of was but her own\r\ndesire to stop it. That dropped, however, as if the alarm itself had\r\nceased; she seemed to have seen in a quick, though tempered glare that\r\nthere were two courses for her, one to leave London again the first\r\nthing in the morning, the other to do nothing at all. Well, she would\r\ndo nothing at all; she was already doing it; more than that, she had\r\nalready done it, and her chance was gone. She gave herself up--she had\r\nthe strangest sense, on the spot, of so deciding; for she had turned a\r\ncorner before she went on again with Lord Mark. Inexpressive, but\r\nintensely significant, he met as no one else could have done the very\r\nquestion she had suddenly put to Mrs. Stringham on the Br\xfcnig. Should\r\nshe have it, whatever she did have, that question had been, for long?\r\n"Ah, so possibly not," her neighbour appeared to reply; "therefore,\r\ndon\'t you see? _I\'m_ the way." It was vivid that he might be, in spite\r\nof his absence of flourish; the way being doubtless just _in_ that\r\nabsence. The handsome girl, whom she didn\'t lose sight of and who, she\r\nfelt, kept her also in view--Mrs. Lowder\'s striking niece would,\r\nperhaps, be the way as well, for in her too was the absence of\r\nflourish, though she had little else, so far as one could tell, in\r\ncommon with Lord Mark. Yet how indeed _could_ one tell, what did one\r\nunderstand, and of what was one, for that matter, provisionally\r\nconscious but of their being somehow together in what they represented?\r\nKate Croy, fine but friendly, looked over at her as really with a guess\r\nat Lord Mark\'s effect on her. If she could guess this effect what then\r\ndid she know about it and in what degree had she felt it herself? Did\r\nthat represent, as between them, anything particular, and should she\r\nhave to count with them as duplicating, as intensifying by a mutual\r\nintelligence, the relation into which she was sinking? Nothing was so\r\nodd as that she should have to recognise so quickly in each of these\r\nglimpses of an instant the various signs of a relation; and this\r\nanomaly itself, had she had more time to give to it, might well, might\r\nalmost terribly have suggested to her that her doom was to live fast.\r\nIt was queerly a question of the short run and the consciousness\r\nproportionately crowded.\r\n\r\nThese were immense excursions for the spirit of a young person at Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s mere dinner-party; but what was so significant and so\r\nadmonitory as the fact of their being possible? What could they have\r\nbeen but just a part, already, of the crowded consciousness? And it was\r\njust a part, likewise, that while plates were changed and dishes\r\npresented and periods in the banquet marked; while appearances insisted\r\nand phenomena multiplied and words reached her from here and there like\r\nplashes of a slow, thick tide; while Mrs. Lowder grew somehow more\r\nstout and more instituted and Susie, at her distance and in comparison,\r\nmore thinly improvised and more different--different, that is, from\r\nevery one and everything: it was just a part that while this process\r\nwent forward our young lady alighted, came back, taking up her destiny\r\nagain as if she had been able by a wave or two of her wings to place\r\nherself briefly in sight of an alternative to it. Whatever it was it\r\nhad showed in this brief interval as better than the alternative; and\r\nit now presented itself altogether in the image and in the place in\r\nwhich she had left it. The image was that of her being, as Lord Mark\r\nhad declared, a success. This depended more or less of course on his\r\nidea of the thing--into which at present, however, she wouldn\'t go.\r\nBut, renewing soon, she had asked him what he meant then that Mrs.\r\nLowder would do with her, and he had replied that this might safely be\r\nleft. "She\'ll get back," he pleasantly said, "her money." He could say\r\nit too--which was singular--without affecting her either as vulgar or\r\nas "nasty "; and he had soon explained himself by adding: "Nobody here,\r\nyou know, does anything for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if you mean that we shall reward her as hard as ever we can,\r\nnothing is more certain. But she\'s an idealist," Milly continued, "and\r\nidealists, in the long run, I think, _don\'t_ feel that they lose."\r\n\r\nLord Mark seemed, within the limits of his enthusiasm, to find this\r\ncharming. "Ah, she strikes you as an idealist?"\r\n\r\n"She idealises _us,_ my friend and me, absolutely. She sees us in a\r\nlight," said Milly. "That\'s all I\'ve got to hold on by. So don\'t\r\ndeprive me of it."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t for the world. But do you think," he continued as if it\r\nwere suddenly important for him--"do you think she sees _me_ in a\r\nlight?"\r\n\r\nShe neglected his question for a little, partly because her attention\r\nattached itself more and more to the handsome girl, partly because,\r\nplaced so near their hostess, she wished not to show as discussing her\r\ntoo freely. Mrs. Lowder, it was true, steering in the other quarter a\r\ncourse in which she called at subjects as if they were islets in an\r\narchipelago, continued to allow them their ease, and Kate Croy, at the\r\nsame time, steadily revealed herself as interesting. Milly in fact\r\nfound, of a sudden, her ease--found it all--as she bethought herself\r\nthat what Mrs. Lowder was really arranging for was a report on her\r\nquality and, as perhaps might be said, her value from Lord Mark. She\r\nwished him, the wonderful lady, to have no pretext for not knowing what\r\nhe thought of Miss Theale. Why his judgment so mattered remained to be\r\nseen; but it was this divination, in any case, that now determined\r\nMilly\'s rejoinder. "No. She knows you. She has probably reason to. And\r\nyou all, here, know each other--I see that--so far as you know\r\nanything. You know what you\'re used to, and it\'s your being used to\r\nit--that, and that only--that makes you. But there are things you don\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nHe took it in as if it might fairly, to do him justice, be a point.\r\n"Things that _I_ don\'t--with all the pains I take and the way I\'ve run\r\nabout the world to leave nothing unlearned?"\r\n\r\nMilly thought, and it was perhaps the very truth of his claim--its not\r\nbeing negligible--that sharpened her impatience and thereby her wit.\r\n"You\'re _blas\xe9,_ but you\'re not enlightened. You\'re familiar with\r\neverything, but conscious, really of nothing. What I mean is that\r\nyou\'ve no imagination."\r\n\r\nLord Mark, at this, threw back his head, ranging with his eyes the\r\nopposite side of the room and showing himself at last so much more\r\ncompletely as diverted that it fairly attracted their hostess\'s notice.\r\nMrs. Lowder, however, only smiled on Milly for a sign that something\r\nracy was what she had expected, and resumed, with a splash of her\r\nscrew, her cruise among the islands. "Oh, I\'ve heard that," the young\r\nman replied, "before!"\r\n\r\n"There it is then. You\'ve heard everything before. You\'ve heard _me_ of\r\ncourse before, in my country, often enough."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never too often," he protested; "I\'m sure I hope I shall still\r\nhear you again and again."\r\n\r\n"But what good then has it done you?" the girl went on as if now\r\nfrankly to amuse him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll see when you know me."\r\n\r\n"But, most assuredly, I shall never know you."\r\n\r\n"Then that will be exactly," he laughed, "the good!"\r\n\r\nIf it established thus that they couldn\'t, or Wouldn\'t, mix, why, none\r\nthe less, did Milly feel, through it, a perverse quickening of the\r\nrelation to which she had been, in spite of herself, appointed?\r\n\r\nWhat queerer consequence of their not mixing than their talking--for it\r\nwas what they had arrived at--almost intimately? She wished to get away\r\nfrom him, or indeed, much rather, away from herself so far as she was\r\npresent to him. She saw already--wonderful creature, after all, herself\r\ntoo--that there would be a good deal more of him to come for her, and\r\nthat the special sign of their intercourse would be to keep herself out\r\nof the question. Everything else might come in--only never that; and\r\nwith such an arrangement they might even go far. This in fact might\r\nquite have begun, on the spot, with her returning again to the topic of\r\nthe handsome girl. If she was to keep herself out she could naturally\r\nbest do so by putting in somebody else. She accordingly put in Kate\r\nCroy, being ready to that extent--as she was not at all afraid for\r\nher--to sacrifice her if necessary. Lord Mark himself, for that matter,\r\nhad made it easy by saying a little while before that no one among them\r\ndid anything for nothing. "What then"--she was aware of being\r\nabrupt--"does Miss Croy, if she\'s so interested, do it for? What has\r\nshe to gain by _her_ lovely welcome? Look at her _now!"_ Milly broke\r\nout with characteristic freedom of praise, though pulling herself up\r\nalso with a compunctious "Oh!" as the direction thus given to their\r\neyes happened to coincide with a turn of Kate\'s face to them. All she\r\nhad meant to do was to insist that this face was fine; but what she had\r\nin fact done was to renew again her effect of showing herself to its\r\npossessor as conjoined with Lord Mark for some interested view of it.\r\nHe had, however, promptly met her question.\r\n\r\n"To gain? Why, your acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s my acquaintance to her? She can care for me--she must\r\nfeel that--only by being sorry for me; and that\'s why she\'s lovely: to\r\nbe already willing to take the trouble to be. It\'s the height of the\r\ndisinterested."\r\n\r\nThere were more things in this than one that Lord Mark might have taken\r\nup; but in a minute he had made his choice. "Ah then, I\'m nowhere, for\r\nI\'m afraid _I\'m_ not sorry for you in the least. What do you make\r\nthen," he asked, "of your success?"\r\n\r\n"Why, just the great reason of all. It\'s just because our friend there\r\nsees it that she pities me. She understands," Milly said; "she\'s better\r\nthan any of you. She\'s beautiful."\r\n\r\nHe appeared struck with this at last--with the point the girl made of\r\nit; to which she came back even after a diversion created by a dish\r\npresented between them. "Beautiful in character, I see. _Is_ she so?\r\nYou must tell me about her."\r\n\r\nMilly wondered. "But haven\'t you known her longer than I? Haven\'t you\r\nseen her for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No--I\'ve failed with her. It\'s no use. I don\'t make her out. And I\r\nassure you I really should like to." His assurance had in fact for his\r\ncompanion a positive suggestion of sincerity; he affected her as now\r\nsaying something that he felt; and she was the more struck with it as\r\nshe was still conscious of the failure even of curiosity he had just\r\nshown in respect to herself. She had meant something--though indeed for\r\nherself almost only--in speaking of their friend\'s natural pity; it had\r\nbeen a note, doubtless, of questionable taste, but it had quavered out\r\nin spite of her; and he had not so much as cared to inquire "Why\r\n\'natural\'?" Not that it wasn\'t really much better for her that he\r\nshouldn\'t: explanations would in truth have taken her much too far.\r\nOnly she now perceived that, in comparison, her word about this other\r\nperson really "drew" him; and there were things in that, probably, many\r\nthings, as to which she would learn more and which glimmered there\r\nalready as part and parcel of that larger "real" with which, in her new\r\nsituation, she was to be beguiled. It was in fact at the very moment,\r\nthis element, not absent from what Lord Mark was further saying. "So\r\nyou\'re wrong, you see, as to our knowing all about each other. There\r\nare cases where we break down. I at any rate give _her_ up--up, that\r\nis, to you. You must do her for me--tell me, I mean, when you know\r\nmore. You\'ll notice," he pleasantly wound up, "that I\'ve confidence in\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t you have?" Milly asked, observing in this, as she\r\nthought, a fine, though, for such a man, a surprisingly artless,\r\nfatuity. It was as if there might have been a question of her\r\nfalsifying for the sake of her own show--that is of her honesty not\r\nbeing proof against her desire to keep well with him herself. She\r\ndidn\'t, none the less, otherwise protest against his remark; there was\r\nsomething else she was occupied in seeing. It was the handsome girl\r\nalone, one of his own species and his own society, who had made him\r\nfeel uncertain; of his certainties about a mere little American, a\r\ncheap exotic, imported almost wholesale, and whose habitat, with its\r\nconditions of climate, growth, and cultivation, its immense profusion,\r\nbut its few varieties and thin development, he was perfectly satisfied.\r\nThe marvel was, too, that Milly understood his satisfaction--feeling\r\nthat she expressed the truth in presently saying: "Of course; I make\r\nout that she must be difficult; just as I see that I myself must be\r\neasy." And that was what, for all the rest of this occasion, remained\r\nwith her--as the most interesting thing that could remain. She was more\r\nand more content herself to be easy; she would have been resigned, even\r\nhad it been brought straighter home to her, to passing for a cheap\r\nexotic. Provisionally, at any rate, that protected her wish to keep\r\nherself, with Lord Mark, in abeyance. They _had_ all affected her as\r\ninevitably knowing each other, and if the handsome girl\'s place among\r\nthem was something even their initiation couldn\'t deal with--why, then,\r\nshe would indeed be a quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThat sense of quantities, separate or mixed, was indeed doubtless what\r\nmost prevailed at first for our slightly gasping American pair; it\r\nfound utterance for them in their frequent remark to each other that\r\nthey had no one but themselves to thank. It dropped from Milly more\r\nthan once that if she had ever known it was so easy--! though her\r\nexclamation mostly ended without completing her idea. This, however,\r\nwas a trifle to Mrs. Stringham, who cared little whether she meant that\r\nin this case she would have come sooner. She couldn\'t have come sooner,\r\nand she perhaps, on the contrary, meant--for it would have been like\r\nher--that she wouldn\'t have come at all; why it was so easy being at\r\nany rate a matter as to which her companion had begun quickly to pick\r\nup views. Susie kept some of these lights for the present to herself,\r\nsince, freely communicated, they might have been a little disturbing;\r\nwith which, moreover, the quantities that we speak of as surrounding\r\nthe two ladies were, in many cases, quantities of things--and of other\r\nthings--to talk about. Their immediate lesson, accordingly, was that\r\nthey just had been caught up by the incalculable strength of a wave\r\nthat was actually holding them aloft and that would naturally dash them\r\nwherever it liked. They meanwhile, we hasten to add, make the best of\r\ntheir precarious position, and if Milly had had no other help for it\r\nshe would have found not a little in the sight of Susan Shepherd\'s\r\nstate. The girl had had nothing to say to her, for three days, about\r\nthe "success" announced by Lord Mark--which they saw, besides,\r\notherwise established; she was too taken up, too touched, by Susie\'s\r\nown exaltation. Susie glowed in the light of her justified faith;\r\neverything had happened that she had been acute enough to think least\r\nprobable; she had appealed to a possible delicacy in Maud Manningham--a\r\ndelicacy, mind you, but _barely_ possible--and her appeal had been met\r\nin a way that was an honour to human nature. This proved sensibility of\r\nthe lady of Lancaster Gate performed verily, for both our friends,\r\nduring these first days, the office of a fine floating gold-dust,\r\nsomething that threw over the prospect a harmonising blur. The forms,\r\nthe colours behind it were strong and deep--we have seen how they\r\nalready stood out for Milly; but nothing, comparatively, had had so\r\nmuch of the dignity of truth as the fact of Maud\'s fidelity to a\r\nsentiment. That was what Susie was proud of, much more than of her\r\ngreat place in the world, which she was moreover conscious of not as\r\nyet wholly measuring. That was what was more vivid even than her\r\nbeing--in senses more worldly and in fact almost in the degree of a\r\nrevelation--English and distinct and positive, with almost no inward,\r\nbut with the finest outward resonance.\r\n\r\nSusan Shepherd\'s word for her, again and again, was that she was\r\n"large"; yet it was not exactly a case, as to the soul, of echoing\r\nchambers: she might have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle,\r\noriginally perhaps loose, but now drawn as tightly as possible over its\r\naccumulated contents--a packed mass, for her American admirer, of\r\ncurious detail. When the latter good lady, at home, had handsomely\r\nfigured her friends as not small--which was the way she mostly figured\r\nthem--there was a certain implication that they were spacious because\r\nthey were empty. Mrs. Lowder, by a different law, was spacious because\r\nshe was full, because she had something in common, even in repose, with\r\na projectile, of great size, loaded and ready for use. That indeed, to\r\nSusie\'s romantic mind, announced itself as half the charm of their\r\nrenewal--a charm as of sitting in springtime, during a long peace, on\r\nthe daisied, grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress. True to her\r\npsychological instincts, certainly, Mrs. Stringham had noted that the\r\n"sentiment" she rejoiced in on her old schoolmate\'s part was all a\r\nmatter of action and movement, was not, save for the interweaving of a\r\nmore frequent plump "dearest" than she would herself perhaps have used,\r\na matter of much other embroidery. She brooded, with interest, on this\r\nfurther remark of race, feeling in her own spirit a different economy.\r\nThe joy, for her, was to know _why_ she acted--the reason was half the\r\nbusiness; whereas with Mrs. Lowder there might have been no reason:\r\n"why" was the trivial seasoning-substance, the vanilla or the nutmeg,\r\nomittable from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it. Mrs. Lowder\'s\r\ndesire was clearly sharp that their young companions should also\r\nprosper together; and Mrs. Stringham\'s account of it all to Milly,\r\nduring the first days, was that when, at Lancaster Gate, she was not\r\noccupied in telling, as it were, about her, she was occupied in hearing\r\nmuch of the history of her hostess\'s brilliant niece.\r\n\r\nThey had plenty, on these lines, the two elder women, to give and to\r\ntake, and it was even not quite clear to the pilgrim from Boston that\r\nwhat she should mainly have arranged for in London was not a series of\r\nthrills for herself. She had a bad conscience, indeed almost a sense of\r\nimmorality, in having to recognise that she was, as she said, carried\r\naway. She laughed to Milly when she also said that she didn\'t know\r\nwhere it would end; and the principal of her uneasiness was that Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s life bristled for her with elements that she was really having\r\nto look at for the first time. They represented, she believed, the\r\nworld, the world that, as a consequence of the cold shoulder turned to\r\nit by the Pilgrim Fathers, had never yet boldly crossed to Boston--it\r\nwould surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder--and she couldn\'t pretend\r\nthat she faced the prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice. She\r\nwas in the act herself of having one, directed precisely to their\r\npresent spectacle. She could but seek strength in the thought that she\r\nhad never had one--or had never yielded to one, which came to the same\r\nthing--before. The sustaining sense of it all, moreover, as literary\r\nmaterial--that quite dropped from her. She must wait, at any rate, she\r\nshould see: it struck her, so far as she had got, as vast, obscure,\r\nlurid. She reflected in the watches of the night that she was probably\r\njust going to love it for itself--that is for itself and Milly. The odd\r\nthing was that she could think of Milly\'s loving it without dread--or\r\nwith dread, at least not on the score of conscience, only on the score\r\nof peace. It was a mercy, at all events, for the hour, that their\r\nfancies jumped together.\r\n\r\nWhile, for this first week that followed their dinner, she drank deep\r\nat Lancaster Gate, her companion was no less happily, appeared to be\r\nindeed on the whole quite as romantically, provided for. The handsome\r\nEnglish girl from the heavy English house had been as a figure in a\r\npicture stepping by magic out of its frame: it was a case, in truth,\r\nfor which Mrs. Stringham presently found the perfect image. She had\r\nlost none of her grasp, but quite the contrary, of that other conceit\r\nin virtue of which Milly was the wandering princess: so what could be\r\nmore in harmony now than to see the princess waited upon at the city\r\ngate by the worthiest maiden, the chosen daughter of the burgesses? It\r\nwas the real again, evidently, the amusement of the meeting for the\r\nprincess too; princesses living for the most part, in such an appeased\r\nway, on the plane of mere elegant representation. That was why they\r\npounced, at city gates, on deputed flower-strewing damsels; that was\r\nwhy, after effigies, processions, and other stately games, frank human\r\ncompany was pleasant to them. Kate Croy really presented herself to\r\nMilly--the latter abounded for Mrs. Stringham in accounts of it--as the\r\nwondrous London girl in person, by what she had conceived, from far\r\nback, of the London girl; conceived from the tales of travellers and\r\nthe anecdotes of New York, from old porings over _Punch_ and a liberal\r\nacquaintance with the fiction of the day. The only thing was that she\r\nwas nicer, for the creature in question had rather been, to our young\r\nwoman, an image of dread. She had thought of her, at her best, as\r\nhandsome just as Kate was, with turns of head and tones of voice,\r\nfelicities of stature and attitude, things "put on" and, for that\r\nmatter, put off, all the marks of the product of a packed society who\r\nshould be at the same time the heroine of a strong story. She placed\r\nthis striking young person from the first in a story, saw her, by a\r\nnecessity of the imagination, for a heroine, felt it the only character\r\nin which she wouldn\'t be wasted; and this in spite of the heroine\'s\r\npleasant abruptness, her forbearance from gush, her umbrellas and\r\njackets and shoes--as these things sketched themselves to Milly--and\r\nsomething rather of a breezy boy in the carriage of her arms and the\r\noccasional freedom of her slang.\r\n\r\nWhen Milly had settled that the extent of her goodwill itself made her\r\nshy, she had found for the moment quite a sufficient key, and they were\r\nby that time thoroughly afloat together. This might well have been the\r\nhappiest hour they were to know, attacking in friendly independence\r\ntheir great London--the London of shops and streets and suburbs oddly\r\ninteresting to Milly, as well as of museums, monuments, "sights" oddly\r\nunfamiliar to Kate, while their elders pursued a separate course, both\r\nrejoicing in their intimacy and each thinking the other\'s young woman a\r\ngreat acquisition for her own. Milly expressed to Susan Shepherd more\r\nthan once that Kate had some secret, some smothered trouble, besides\r\nall the rest of her history; and that if she had so good-naturedly\r\nhelped Mrs. Lowder to meet them this was exactly to create a diversion,\r\nto give herself something else to think about. But on the case thus\r\npostulated our young American had as yet had no light: she only felt\r\nthat when the light should come it would greatly deepen the colour; and\r\nshe liked to think she was prepared for anything. What she already\r\nknew, moreover, was full to her vision, of English, of eccentric, of\r\nThackerayan character, Kate Croy having gradually become not a little\r\nexplicit on the subject of her situation, her past, her present, her\r\ngeneral predicament, her small success, up to the present hour, in\r\ncontenting at the same time her father, her sister, her aunt and\r\nherself. It was Milly\'s subtle guess, imparted to her Susie, that the\r\ngirl had somebody else as well, as yet unnamed, to content, it being\r\nmanifest that such a creature couldn\'t help having; a creature not\r\nperhaps, if one would, exactly formed to inspire passions, since that\r\nalways implied a certain silliness, but essentially seen, by the\r\nadmiring eye of friendship, under the clear shadow of some probably\r\neminent male interest. The clear shadow, from whatever source\r\nprojected, hung, at any rate, over Milly\'s companion the whole week,\r\nand Kate Croy\'s handsome face smiled out of it, under bland skylights,\r\nin the presence alike of old masters passive in their glory and of\r\nthoroughly new ones, the newest, who bristled restlessly with pins and\r\nbrandished snipping shears.\r\n\r\nIt was meanwhile a pretty part of the intercourse of these young ladies\r\nthat each thought the other more remarkable than herself--that each\r\nthought herself, or assured the other she did, a comparatively dusty\r\nobject and the other a favourite of nature and of fortune. Kate was\r\namused, amazed at the way her friend insisted on "taking" her, and\r\nMilly wondered if Kate were sincere in finding her the most\r\nextraordinary--quite apart from her being the most charming--person she\r\nhad come across. They had talked, in long drives, and quantities of\r\nhistory had not been wanting--in the light of which Mrs. Lowder\'s niece\r\nmight superficially seem to have had the best of the argument. Her\r\nvisitor\'s American references, with their bewildering immensities,\r\ntheir confounding moneyed New York, their excitements of high pressure,\r\ntheir opportunities of wild freedom, their record of used-up relatives,\r\nparents, clever, eager, fair, slim brothers--these the most loved--all\r\nengaged, as well as successive superseded guardians, in a high\r\nextravagance of speculation and dissipation that had left this\r\nexquisite being her black dress, her white face and her vivid hair as\r\nthe mere last broken link: such a picture quite threw into the shade\r\nthe brief biography, however sketchily amplified, of a mere\r\nmiddle-class nobody in Bayswater. And though that indeed might be but a\r\nBayswater way of putting it, in addition to which Milly was in the\r\nstage of interest in Bayswater ways, this critic so far prevailed that,\r\nlike Mrs. Stringham herself, she fairly got her companion to accept\r\nfrom her that she was quite the nearest approach to a practical\r\nprincess Bayswater could hope ever to know. It was a fact--it became\r\none at the end of three days--that Milly actually began to borrow from\r\nthe handsome girl a sort of view of her state; the handsome girl\'s\r\nimpression of it was clearly so sincere. This impression was a tribute,\r\na tribute positively to power, power the source of which was the last\r\nthing Kate treated as a mystery. There were passages, under all their\r\nskylights, the succession of their shops being large, in which the\r\nlatter\'s easy, yet the least bit dry manner sufficiently gave out that\r\nif she had had so deep a pocket----!\r\n\r\nIt was not moreover by any means with not having the imagination of\r\nexpenditure that she appeared to charge her friend, but with not having\r\nthe imagination of terror, of thrift, the imagination or in any degree\r\nthe habit of a conscious dependence on others. Such moments, when all\r\nWigmore Street, for instance, seemed to rustle about and the pale girl\r\nherself to be facing the different rustlers, usually so\r\nundiscriminated, as individual Britons too, Britons personal, parties\r\nto a relation and perhaps even intrinsically remarkable--such moments\r\nin especial determined in Kate a perception of the high happiness of\r\nher companion\'s liberty. Milly\'s range was thus immense; she had to ask\r\nnobody for anything, to refer nothing to any one; her freedom, her\r\nfortune and her fancy were her law; an obsequious world surrounded her,\r\nshe could sniff up at every step its fumes. And Kate, in these days,\r\nwas altogether in the phase of forgiving her so much bliss; in the\r\nphase moreover of believing that, should they continue to go on\r\ntogether, she would abide in that generosity. She had, at such a point\r\nas this, no suspicion of a rift within the lute--by which we mean not\r\nonly none of anything\'s coming between them, but none of any definite\r\nflaw in so much clearness of quality. Yet, all the same, if Milly, at\r\nMrs. Lowder\'s banquet, had described herself to Lord Mark as kindly\r\nused by the young woman on the other side because of some faintly-felt\r\nspecial propriety in it, so there really did match with this,\r\nprivately, on the young woman\'s part, a feeling not analysed but\r\ndivided, a latent impression that Mildred Theale was not, after all, a\r\nperson to change places, to change even chances with. Kate, verily,\r\nwould perhaps not quite have known what she meant by this reservation,\r\nand she came near naming it only when she said to herself that, rich as\r\nMilly was, one probably wouldn\'t--which was singular--ever hate her for\r\nit. The handsome girl had, with herself, these felicities and\r\ncrudities: it wasn\'t obscure to her that, without some very particular\r\nreason to help, it might have proved a test of one\'s philosophy not to\r\nbe irritated by a mistress of millions, or whatever they were, who, as\r\na girl, so easily might have been, like herself, only vague and fatally\r\nfemale. She was by no means sure of liking Aunt Maud as much as she\r\ndeserved, and Aunt Maud\'s command of funds was obviously inferior to\r\nMilly\'s. There was thus clearly, as pleading for the latter, some\r\ninfluence that would later on become distinct; and meanwhile,\r\ndecidedly, it was enough that she was as charming as she was queer and\r\nas queer as she was charming--all of which was a rare amusement; as\r\nwell, for that matter, as further sufficient that there were objects of\r\nvalue she had already pressed on Kate\'s acceptance. A week of her\r\nsociety in these conditions--conditions that Milly chose to sum up as\r\nministering immensely, for a blind, vague pilgrim, to aid and\r\ncomfort--announced itself from an early hour as likely to become a week\r\nof presents, acknowledgments, mementos, pledges of gratitude and\r\nadmiration that were all on one side. Kate as promptly embraced the\r\npropriety of making it clear that she must forswear shops till she\r\nshould receive some guarantee that the contents of each one she entered\r\nas a humble companion should not be placed at her feet; yet that was in\r\ntruth not before she had found herself in possession, under whatever\r\nprotests, of several precious ornaments and other minor conveniences.\r\n\r\nGreat was the absurdity, too, that there should have come a day, by the\r\nend of the week, when it appeared that all Milly would have asked in\r\ndefinite "return," as might be said, was to be told a little about Lord\r\nMark and to be promised the privilege of a visit to Mrs. Condrip. Far\r\nother amusements had been offered her, but her eagerness was\r\nshamelessly human, and she seemed really to count more on the\r\nrevelation of the anxious lady of Chelsea than on the best nights of\r\nthe opera. Kate admired, and showed it, such an absence of fear: to the\r\nfear of being bored, in such a connection, she would have been so\r\nobviously entitled. Milly\'s answer to this was the plea of her\r\ncuriosities--which left her friend wondering as to their odd direction.\r\nSome among them, no doubt, were rather more intelligible, and Kate had\r\nheard without wonder that she was blank about Lord Mark. This young\r\nlady\'s account of him, at the same time, professed itself as frankly\r\nimperfect; for what they best knew him by at Lancaster Gate was a thing\r\ndifficult to explain. One knew people in general by something they had\r\nto show, something that, either for them or against, could be touched\r\nor named or proved; and she could think of no other case of a value\r\ntaken as so great and yet flourishing untested. His value was his\r\nfuture, which had somehow got itself as accepted by Aunt Maud as if it\r\nhad been his good cook or his steam-launch. She, Kate, didn\'t mean she\r\nthought him a humbug; he might do great things--but they were all, as\r\nyet, so to speak, he had done. On the other hand it was of course\r\nsomething of an achievement, and not open to every one, to have got\r\none\'s self taken so seriously by Aunt Maud. The best thing about him,\r\ndoubtless, on the whole, was that Aunt Maud believed in him. She was\r\noften fantastic, but she knew a humbug, and--no, Lord Mark wasn\'t that.\r\nHe had been a short time in the House, on the Tory side, but had lost\r\nhis seat on the first opportunity, and this was all he had to point to.\r\nHowever, he pointed to nothing; which was very possibly just a sign of\r\nhis real cleverness, one of those that the really clever had in common\r\nwith the really void. Even Aunt Maud frequently admitted that there was\r\na good deal, for her view of him, to come up in the rear. And he wasn\'t\r\nmeanwhile himself indifferent--indifferent to himself--for he was\r\nworking Lancaster Gate for all it was worth: just as it was, no doubt,\r\nworking _him,_ and just as the working and the worked were in London,\r\nas one might explain, the parties to every relation.\r\n\r\nKate did explain, for her listening friend: every one who had anything\r\nto give--it was true they were the fewest--made the sharpest possible\r\nbargain for it, got at least its value in return. The strangest thing,\r\nfurthermore, was that this might be, in cases, a happy understanding.\r\nThe worker in one connection was the worked in another; it was as broad\r\nas it was long--with the wheels of the system, as might be seen,\r\nwonderfully oiled. People could quite like each other in the midst of\r\nit, as Aunt Maud, by every appearance, quite liked Lord Mark, and as\r\nLord Mark, it was to be hoped, liked Mrs. Lowder, since if he didn\'t he\r\nwas a greater brute than one could believe. She, Kate, had not yet, it\r\nwas true, made out what he was doing for her--besides which the dear\r\nwoman needed him, even at the most he could do, much less than she\r\nimagined; so far as all of which went, moreover, there were plenty of\r\nthings on every side she had not yet made out. She believed, on the\r\nwhole, in any one Aunt Maud took up; and she gave it to Milly as worth\r\nthinking of that, whatever wonderful people this young lady might meet\r\nin the land, she would meet no more extraordinary woman. There were\r\ngreater celebrities by the million, and of course greater swells, but a\r\nbigger _person,_ by Kate\'s view, and a larger natural handful every\r\nway, would really be far to seek. When Milly inquired with interest if\r\nKate\'s belief in _her_ was primarily on the lines of what Mrs. Lowder\r\n"took up," her interlocutress could handsomely say yes, since by the\r\nsame principle she believed in herself. Whom but Aunt Maud\'s niece,\r\npre-eminently, had Aunt Maud taken up, and who was thus more in the\r\ncurrent, with her, of working and of being worked? "You may ask," Kate\r\nsaid, "what in the world I have to give; and that indeed is just what\r\nI\'m trying to learn. There must be something, for her to think she can\r\nget it out of me. She _will_ get it--trust her; and then I shall see\r\nwhat it is; which I beg you to believe I should never have found out\r\nfor myself." She declined to treat any question of Milly\'s own "paying"\r\npower as discussable; that Milly would pay a hundred per cent.--and\r\neven to the end, doubtless, through the nose--was just the beautiful\r\nbasis on which they found themselves.\r\n\r\nThese were fine facilities, pleasantries, ironies, all these luxuries\r\nof gossip and philosophies of London and of life, and they became\r\nquickly, between the pair, the common form of talk, Milly professing\r\nherself delighted to know that something was to be done with her. If\r\nthe most remarkable woman in England was to do it, so much the better,\r\nand if the most remarkable woman in England had them both in hand\r\ntogether, why, what could be jollier for each? When she reflected\r\nindeed a little on the oddity of her wanting two at once, Kate had the\r\nnatural reply that it was exactly what showed her sincerity. She\r\ninvariably gave way to feeling, and feeling had distinctly popped up in\r\nher on the advent of her girlhood\'s friend. The way the cat would jump\r\nwas always, in presence of anything that moved her, interesting to see;\r\nvisibly enough, moreover, for a long time, it hadn\'t jumped anything\r\nlike so far. This, in fact, as we already know, remained the marvel for\r\nMilly Theale, who, on sight of Mrs. Lowder, found fifty links in\r\nrespect to Susie absent from the chain of association. She knew so\r\nherself what she thought of Susie that she would have expected the lady\r\nof Lancaster Gate to think something quite different; the failure of\r\nwhich endlessly mystified her. But her mystification was the cause for\r\nher of another fine impression, inasmuch as when she went so far as to\r\nobserve to Kate that Susan Shepherd--and especially Susan Shepherd\r\nemerging so uninvited from an irrelevant past--ought, by all the\r\nproprieties, simply to have bored Aunt Maud, her confidant agreed with\r\nher without a protest and abounded in the sense of her wonder. Susan\r\nShepherd at least bored the niece--that was plain; this young woman saw\r\nnothing in her--nothing to account for anything, not even for Milly\'s\r\nown indulgence: which little fact became in turn to the latter\'s mind a\r\nfact of significance. It was a light on the handsome girl--representing\r\nmore than merely showed--that poor Susie was simply as nought to her.\r\nThis was, in a manner too, a general admonition to poor Susie\'s\r\ncompanion, who seemed to see marked by it the direction in which she\r\nhad best most look out.\r\n\r\nIt just faintly rankled in her that a person who was good enough and to\r\nspare for Milly Theale shouldn\'t be good enough for another girl;\r\nthough, oddly enough, she could easily have forgiven Mrs. Lowder\r\nherself the impatience. Mrs. Lowder didn\'t feel it, and Kate Croy felt\r\nit with ease; yet in the end, be it added, she grasped the reason, and\r\nthe reason enriched her mind. Wasn\'t it sufficiently the reason that\r\nthe handsome girl was, with twenty other splendid qualities, the least\r\nbit brutal too, and didn\'t she suggest, as no one yet had ever done for\r\nher new friend, that there might be a wild beauty in that, and even a\r\nstrange grace? Kate wasn\'t brutally brutal--which Milly had hitherto\r\nbenightedly supposed the only way; she wasn\'t even aggressively so, but\r\nrather indifferently, defensively and, as might be said, by the habit\r\nof anticipation. She simplified in advance, was beforehand with her\r\ndoubts, and knew with singular quickness what she wasn\'t, as they said\r\nin New York, going to like. In that way at least people were clearly\r\nquicker in England than at home; and Milly could quite see, after a\r\nlittle, how such instincts might become usual in a world in which\r\ndangers abounded. There were more dangers, clearly, round about\r\nLancaster Gate than one suspected in New York or could dream of in\r\nBoston. At all events, with more sense of them, there were more\r\nprecautions, and it was a remarkable world altogether in which there\r\ncould be precautions, on whatever ground, against Susie.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nShe certainly made up with Susie directly, however, for any allowance\r\nshe might have had privately to extend to tepid appreciation; since the\r\nlate and long talks of these two embraced not only everything offered\r\nand suggested by the hours they spent apart, but a good deal more\r\nbesides. She might be as detached as the occasion required at four\r\no\'clock in the afternoon, but she used no such freedom to any one about\r\nanything as she habitually used about everything to Susan Shepherd at\r\nmidnight. All the same, it should with much less delay than this have\r\nbeen mentioned, she had not yet--had not, that is, at the end of six\r\ndays--produced any news for her comrade to compare with an announcement\r\nmade her by the latter as a result of a drive with Mrs. Lowder, for a\r\nchange, in the remarkable Battersea Park. The elder friends had\r\nsociably revolved there while the younger ones followed bolder fancies\r\nin the admirable equipage appointed to Milly at the hotel--a heavier,\r\nmore emblazoned, more amusing chariot than she had ever, with "stables"\r\nnotoriously mismanaged, known at home; whereby, in the course of the\r\ncircuit, more than once repeated, it had "come out," as Mrs. Stringham\r\nsaid, that the couple at Lancaster Gate were, of all people, acquainted\r\nwith Mildred\'s other English friend--the gentleman, the one connected\r\nwith the English newspaper (Susie hung fire a little over his name) who\r\nhad been with her in New York so shortly previous to present\r\nadventures. He had been named of course in Battersea Park--else he\r\ncouldn\'t have been identified; and Susie had naturally, before she\r\ncould produce her own share in the matter as a kind of confession, to\r\nmake it plain that her allusion was to Mr. Merton Densher. This was\r\nbecause Milly had at first a little air of not knowing whom she meant;\r\nand the girl really kept, as well, a certain control of herself while\r\nshe remarked that the case was surprising, the chance one in a\r\nthousand. They knew him, both Maud and Miss Croy knew him, she gathered\r\ntoo, rather well, though indeed it was not on any show of intimacy that\r\nhe had happened to be mentioned. It had not been--Susie made the\r\npoint--she herself who brought him in: he had in fact not been brought\r\nin at all, but only referred to as a young journalist known to Mrs.\r\nLowder and who had lately gone to their wonderful country--Mrs. Lowder\r\nalways said "your wonderful country"--on behalf of his journal. But\r\nMrs. Stringham had taken it up--with the tips of her fingers indeed;\r\nand that was the confession: she had, without meaning any harm,\r\nrecognised Mr. Densher as an acquaintance of Milly\'s, though she had\r\nalso pulled herself up before getting in too far. Mrs. Lowder had been\r\nstruck, clearly--it wasn\'t too much to say; then she also, it had\r\nrather seemed, had pulled herself up; and there had been a little\r\nmoment during which each might have been keeping something from the\r\nother. "Only," said Milly\'s mate, "I luckily remembered in time that I\r\nhad nothing whatever to keep--which was much simpler and nicer. I don\'t\r\nknow what Maud has, but there it is. She was interested, distinctly, in\r\nyour knowing him--in his having met you over there with so little loss\r\nof time. But I ventured to tell her it hadn\'t been so long as to make\r\nyou as yet great friends. I don\'t know if I was right."\r\n\r\nWhatever time this explanation might have taken, there had been moments\r\nenough in the matter now--before the elder woman\'s conscience had done\r\nitself justice--to enable Milly to reply that although the fact in\r\nquestion doubtless had its importance she imagined they wouldn\'t find\r\nthe importance overwhelming. It _was_ odd that their one Englishman\r\nshould so instantly fit; it wasn\'t, however, miraculous--they surely\r\nall had often seen that, as every one said, the world was\r\nextraordinarily "small." Undoubtedly, too, Susie had done just the\r\nplain thing in not letting his name pass. Why in the world should there\r\nbe a mystery?--and what an immense one they would appear to have made\r\nif he should come back and find they had concealed their knowledge of\r\nhim! "I don\'t know, Susie dear," the girl observed, "what you think I\r\nhave to conceal."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter, at a given moment," Mrs. Stringham returned, "what\r\nyou know or don\'t know as to what I think; for you always find out the\r\nvery next moment, and when you do find out, dearest, you never _really_\r\ncare. Only," she presently asked, "have you heard of him from Miss\r\nCroy?"\r\n\r\n"Heard of Mr. Densher? Never a word. We haven\'t mentioned him. Why\r\nshould we?"\r\n\r\n"That _you_ haven\'t, I understand; but that she hasn\'t," Susie opined,\r\n"may mean something."\r\n\r\n"May mean what?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Mrs. Stringham presently brought out, "I tell you all when I\r\ntell you that Maud asks me to suggest to you that it may perhaps be\r\nbetter for the present not to speak of him: not to speak of him to her\r\nniece, that is, unless she herself speaks to you first. But Maud thinks\r\nshe won\'t."\r\n\r\nMilly was ready to engage for anything; but in respect to the facts--as\r\nthey so far possessed them--it all sounded a little complicated. "Is it\r\nbecause there\'s anything between them?"\r\n\r\n"No--I gather not; but Maud\'s state of mind is precautionary. She\'s\r\nafraid of something. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say she\'s\r\nafraid of everything."\r\n\r\n"She\'s afraid, you mean," Milly asked, "of their--a--liking each other?"\r\n\r\nSusie had an intense thought and then an effusion. "My dear child, we\r\nmove in a labyrinth."\r\n\r\n"Of course we do. That\'s just the fun of it!" said Milly with a strange\r\ngaiety. Then she added: "Don\'t tell me that--in this for\r\ninstance--there are not abysses. I want abysses."\r\n\r\nHer friend looked at her--it was not unfrequently the case--a little\r\nharder than the surface of the occasion seemed to require; and another\r\nperson present at such times might have wondered to what inner thought\r\nof her own the good lady was trying to fit the speech. It was too much\r\nher disposition, no doubt, to treat her young companion\'s words as\r\nsymptoms of an imputed malady. It was none the less, however, her\r\nhighest law to be light when the girl was light. She knew how to be\r\nquaint with the new quaintness--the great Boston gift; it had been,\r\nhappily, her note in the magazines; and Maud Lowder, to whom it was new\r\nindeed and who had never heard anything remotely like it, quite\r\ncherished her, as a social resource, for it. It should not therefore\r\nfail her now; with it in fact one might face most things. "Ah, then let\r\nus hope we shall sound the depths--I\'m prepared for the worst--of\r\nsorrow and sin! But she would like her niece--we\'re not ignorant of\r\nthat, are we?--to marry Lord Mark. Hasn\'t she told you so?"\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t Mrs. Lowder told me?"\r\n\r\n"No; hasn\'t Kate? It isn\'t, you know, that she doesn\'t know it."\r\n\r\nMilly had, under her comrade\'s eyes, a minute of mute detachment. She\r\nhad lived with Kate Croy for several days in a state of intimacy as\r\ndeep as it had been sudden, and they had clearly, in talk, in many\r\ndirections, proceeded to various extremities. Yet it now came over her\r\nas in a clear cold way that there was a possible account of their\r\nrelations in which the quantity her new friend had told her might have\r\nfigured as small, as smallest, beside the quantity she hadn\'t. She\r\ncouldn\'t say, at any rate, whether or no she had made the point that\r\nher aunt designed her for Lord Mark: it had only sufficiently come\r\nout--which had been, moreover, eminently guessable--that she was\r\ninvolved in her aunt\'s designs. Somehow, for Milly, brush it over\r\nnervously as she might and with whatever simplifying hand, this abrupt\r\nextrusion of Mr. Densher altered all proportions, had an effect on all\r\nvalues. It was fantastic of her to let it make a difference that she\r\ncouldn\'t in the least have defined--and she was at least, even during\r\nthese instants, rather proud of being able to hide, on the spot, the\r\ndifference it did make. Yet, all the same, the effect for her was,\r\nalmost violently, of Mr. Densher\'s having been there--having been where\r\nshe had stood till now in her simplicity--before her. It would have\r\ntaken but another free moment to make her see abysses--since abysses\r\nwere what she wanted--in the mere circumstance of his own silence, in\r\nNew York, about his English friends. There had really been in New York\r\nlittle time for anything; but, had she liked, Milly could have made it\r\nout for herself that he had avoided the subject of Miss Croy, and that\r\nMiss Croy was yet a subject it could never be natural to avoid. It was\r\nto be added at the same time that even if his silence had been\r\nlabyrinthe--which was absurd in view of all the other things too he\r\ncouldn\'t possibly have spoken of--this was exactly what must suit her,\r\nsince it fell under the head of the plea she had just uttered to Susie.\r\nThese things, however, came and went, and it set itself up between the\r\ncompanions, for the occasion, in the oddest way, both that their\r\nhappening all to know Mr. Densher--except indeed that Susie didn\'t, but\r\nprobably would,--was a fact belonging, in a world of rushing about, to\r\none of the common orders of chance; and yet further that it was\r\namusing--oh, awfully amusing!--to be able fondly to hope that there was\r\n"something in" its having been left to crop up with such suddenness.\r\nThere seemed somehow a possibility that the ground or, as it were, the\r\nair might, in a manner, have undergone some pleasing preparation;\r\nthough the question of this possibility would probably, after all, have\r\ntaken some threshing out. The truth, moreover--and there they were,\r\nalready, our pair, talking about it, the "truth!"--had not in fact\r\nquite cropped out. This, obviously, in view of Mrs. Lowder\'s request to\r\nher old friend.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly on Mrs. Lowder\'s recommendation that nothing should\r\nbe said to Kate--it was on this rich attitude of Aunt Maud\'s that the\r\nidea of an interesting complication might best hope to perch; and when,\r\nin fact, after the colloquy we have reported Milly saw Kate again\r\nwithout mentioning any name, her silence succeeded in passing muster\r\nwith her as the beginning of a new sort of fun. The sort was all the\r\nnewer by reason of its containing a small element of anxiety: when she\r\nhad gone in for fun before it had been with her hands a little more\r\nfree. Yet it _was,_ none the less, rather exciting to be conscious of a\r\nstill sharper reason for interest in the handsome girl, as Kate\r\ncontinued, even now, pre-eminently to remain for her; and a\r\nreason--this was the great point--of which the young woman herself\r\ncould have no suspicion. Twice over, thus, for two or three hours\r\ntogether, Milly found herself seeing Kate, quite fixing her in the\r\nlight of the knowledge that it was a face on which Mr. Densher\'s eyes\r\nhad more or less familiarly rested and which, by the same token, had\r\nlooked, rather _more_ beautifully than less, into his own. She pulled\r\nherself up indeed with the thought that it had inevitably looked, as\r\nbeautifully as one would, into thousands of faces in which one might\r\none\'s self never trace it; but just the odd result of the thought was\r\nto intensify for the girl that side of her friend which she had\r\ndoubtless already been more prepared than she quite knew to think of as\r\nthe "other," the not wholly calculable. It was fantastic, and Milly was\r\naware of this; but the other side was what had, of a sudden, been\r\nturned straight towards her by the show of Mr. Densher\'s propinquity.\r\nShe hadn\'t the excuse of knowing it for Kate\'s own, since nothing\r\nwhatever as yet proved it particularly to be such. Never mind; it was\r\nwith this other side now fully presented that Kate came and went,\r\nkissed her for greeting and for parting, talked, as usual, of\r\neverything but--as it had so abruptly become for Milly--_the_ thing.\r\nOur young woman, it is true, would doubtless not have tasted so sharply\r\na difference in this pair of occasions had she not been tasting so\r\npeculiarly her own possible betrayals. What happened was that\r\nafterwards, on separation, she wondered if the matter had not mainly\r\nbeen that she herself was so "other," so taken up with the unspoken;\r\nthe strangest thing of all being, still subsequently, that when she\r\nasked herself how Kate could have failed to feel it she became\r\nconscious of being here on the edge of a great darkness. She should\r\nnever know how Kate truly felt about anything such a one as Milly\r\nTheale should give her to feel. Kate would never--and not from\r\nill-will, nor from duplicity, but from a sort of failure of common\r\nterms--reduce it to such a one\'s comprehension or put it within her\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt was as such a one, therefore, that, for three or four days more,\r\nMilly watched Kate as just such another; and it was presently as such a\r\none that she threw herself into their promised visit, at last achieved,\r\nto Chelsea, the quarter of the famous Carlyle, the field of exercise of\r\nhis ghost, his votaries, and the residence of "poor Marian," so often\r\nreferred to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit there. With our\r\nyoung woman\'s first view of poor Marian everything gave way but the\r\nsense of how, in England, apparently, the social situation of sisters\r\ncould be opposed, how common ground, for a place in the world, could\r\nquite fail them: a state of things sagely perceived to be involved in\r\nan hierarchical, an aristocratic order. Just whereabouts in the order\r\nMrs. Lowder had established her niece was a question not wholly void,\r\nas yet, no doubt, of ambiguity--though Milly was withal sure Lord Mark\r\ncould exactly have fixed the point if he would, fixing it at the same\r\ntime for Aunt Maud herself; but it was clear that Mrs. Condrip was, as\r\nmight have been said, in quite another geography. She would not, in\r\nshort, have been to be found on the same social map, and it was as if\r\nher visitors had turned over page after page together before the final\r\nrelief of their benevolent "Here!" The interval was bridged, of course,\r\nbut the bridge, verily, was needed, and the impression left Milly to\r\nwonder whether, in the general connection, it were of bridges or of\r\nintervals that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself\r\nmost conscious. It was as if at home, by contrast, there were\r\nneither--neither the difference itself, from position to position, nor,\r\non either side, and particularly on one, the awfully good manner, the\r\nconscious sinking of a consciousness, that made up for it. The\r\nconscious sinking, at all events, and the awfully good manner, the\r\ndifference, the bridge, the interval, the skipped leaves of the social\r\natlas--these, it was to be confessed, had a little, for our young lady,\r\nin default of stouter stuff, to work themselves into the light literary\r\nlegend--a mixed, wandering echo of Trollope, of Thackeray, perhaps\r\nmostly of Dickens--under favour of which her pilgrimage had so much\r\nappealed. She could relate to Susie later on, late the same evening,\r\nthat the legend, before she had done with it, had run clear, that the\r\nadored author of _The Newcomes_, in fine, had been on the whole the\r\nnote: the picture lacking thus more than she had hoped, or rather\r\nperhaps showing less than she had feared, a certain possibility of\r\nPickwickian outline. She explained how she meant by this that Mrs.\r\nCondrip had not altogether proved another Mrs. Nickleby, nor even--for\r\nshe might have proved almost anything, from the way poor worried Kate\r\nhad spoken--a widowed and aggravated Mrs. Micawber.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringham, in the midnight conference, intimated rather yearningly\r\nthat, however the event might have turned, the side of English life\r\nsuch experiences opened to Milly were just those she herself seemed\r\n"booked"--as they were all, roundabout her now, always saying--to miss:\r\nshe had begun to have a little, for her fellow-observer, these moments\r\nof fanciful reaction--reaction in which she was once more all Susan\r\nShepherd--against the high sphere of colder conventions into which her\r\noverwhelming connection with Maud Manningham had rapt her. Milly never\r\nlost sight, for long, of the Susan Shepherd side of her, and was always\r\nthere to meet it when it came up and vaguely, tenderly, impatiently to\r\npat it, abounding in the assurance that they would still provide for\r\nit. They had, however, to-night, another matter in hand; which proved\r\nto be presently, on the girl\'s part, in respect to her hour of Chelsea,\r\nthe revelation that Mrs. Condrip, taking a few minutes when Kate was\r\naway with one of the children, in bed upstairs for some small\r\ncomplaint, had suddenly, without its being in the least "led up to,"\r\nbroken ground on the subject of Mr. Densher, mentioned him with\r\nimpatience as a person in love with her sister. "She wished me, if I\r\ncared for Kate, to know," Milly said--"for it would be quite too\r\ndreadful, and one might do something."\r\n\r\nSusie wondered. "Prevent anything coming of it? That\'s easily said. Do\r\nwhat?"\r\n\r\nMilly had a dim smile. "I think that what she would like is that I\r\nshould come a good deal to see her about it."\r\n\r\n"And doesn\'t she suppose you\'ve anything else to do?"\r\n\r\nThe girl had by this time clearly made it out. "Nothing but to admire\r\nand make much of her sister--whom she doesn\'t, however, herself in the\r\nleast understand--and give up one\'s time, and everything else, to it."\r\nIt struck the elder friend that she spoke with an almost unprecedented\r\napproach to sharpness; as if Mrs. Condrip had been rather specially\r\ndisconcerting. Never yet so much as just of late had Mrs. Stringham\r\nseen her companion as exalted, and by the very play of something\r\nwithin, into a vague golden air that left irritation below. That was\r\nthe great thing with Milly--it was her characteristic poetry; or at\r\nleast it was Susan Shepherd\'s. "But she made a point," the former\r\ncontinued, "of my keeping what she says from Kate. I\'m not to mention\r\nthat she has spoken."\r\n\r\n"And why," Mrs. Stringham presently asked, "is Mr. Densher so dreadful?"\r\n\r\nMilly had, she thought, an hesitation--something that suggested a\r\nfuller talk with Mrs. Condrip than she inclined perhaps to report. "It\r\nisn\'t so much he himself." Then the girl spoke a little as for the\r\nromance of it; one could never tell, with her, where romance would come\r\nin. "It\'s the state of his fortunes."\r\n\r\n"And is that very bad?"\r\n\r\n"He has no \'private means,\' and no prospect of any. He has no income,\r\nand no ability, according to Mrs. Condrip, to make one. He\'s as poor,\r\nshe calls it, as \'poverty,\' and she says she knows what that is."\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Stringham considered, and it presently produced something.\r\n"But isn\'t he brilliantly clever?"\r\n\r\nMilly had also then an instant that was not quite fruitless. "I haven\'t\r\nthe least idea."\r\n\r\nTo which, for the time, Susie only answered "Oh!"--though by the end of\r\na minute she had followed it with a slightly musing "I see"; and that\r\nin turn with: "It\'s quite what Maud Lowder thinks."\r\n\r\n"That he\'ll never do anything?"\r\n\r\n"No--quite the contrary: that he\'s exceptionally able."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I know"--Milly had again, in reference to what her friend had\r\nalready told her of this, her little tone of a moment before. "But Mrs.\r\nCondrip\'s own great point is that Aunt Maud herself won\'t hear of any\r\nsuch person. Mr. Densher, she holds that\'s the way, at any rate, it was\r\nexplained to me--won\'t ever be either a public man or a rich man. If he\r\nwere public she\'d be willing, as I understand, to help him; if he were\r\nrich--without being anything else--she\'d do her best to swallow him. As\r\nit is, she taboos him."\r\n\r\n"In short," said Mrs. Stringham as with a private purpose, "she told\r\nyou, the sister, all about it. But Mrs. Lowder likes him," she added.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Condrip didn\'t tell me that."\r\n\r\n"Well, she does, all the same, my dear, extremely."\r\n\r\n"Then there it is!" On which, with a drop and one of those sudden,\r\nslightly sighing surrenders to a vague reflux and a general fatigue\r\nthat had recently more than once marked themselves for her companion,\r\nMilly turned away. Yet the matter was not left so, that night, between\r\nthem, albeit neither perhaps could afterwards have said which had first\r\ncome back to it. Milly\'s own nearest approach, at least, for a little,\r\nto doing so, was to remark that they appeared all--every one they\r\nsaw--to think tremendously of money. This prompted in Susie a laugh,\r\nnot untender, the innocent meaning of which was that it came, as a\r\nsubject for indifference, money did, easier to some people than to\r\nothers: she made the point in fairness, however, that you couldn\'t have\r\ntold, by any too crude transparency of air, what place it held for Maud\r\nManningham. She did her worldliness with grand proper silences--if it\r\nmightn\'t better be put perhaps that she did her detachment with grand\r\noccasional pushes. However Susie put it, in truth, she was really, in\r\njustice to herself, thinking of the difference, as favourites of\r\nfortune, between her old friend and her new. Aunt Maud sat somehow in\r\nthe midst of her money, founded on it and surrounded by it, even if\r\nwith a clever high manner about it, her manner of looking, hard and\r\nbright, as if it weren\'t there. Milly, about hers, had no manner at\r\nall--which was possibly, from a point of view, a fault: she was at any\r\nrate far away on the edge of it, and you hadn\'t, as might be said, in\r\norder to get at her nature, to traverse, by whatever avenue, any piece\r\nof her property. It was clear, on the other hand, that Mrs. Lowder was\r\nkeeping her wealth as for purposes, imaginations, ambitions, that would\r\nfigure as large, as honourably unselfish, on the day they should take\r\neffect. She would impose her will, but her will would be only that a\r\nperson or two shouldn\'t lose a benefit by not submitting if they could\r\nbe made to submit. To Milly, as so much younger, such far views\r\ncouldn\'t be imputed: there was nobody she was supposable as interested\r\nfor. It was too soon, since she wasn\'t interested for herself. Even the\r\nrichest woman, at her age, lacked motive, and Milly\'s motive doubtless\r\nhad plenty of time to arrive. She was meanwhile beautiful, simple,\r\nsublime without it--whether missing it and vaguely reaching out for it\r\nor not; and with it, for that matter, in the event, would really be\r\nthese things just as much. Only then she might very well have, like\r\nAunt Maud, a manner. Such were the connections, at all events, in which\r\nthe colloquy of our two ladies freshly flickered up--in which it came\r\nround that the elder asked the younger if she had herself, in the\r\nafternoon, named Mr. Densher as an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"Oh no--I said nothing of having seen him. I remembered," the girl\r\nexplained, "Mrs. Lowder\'s wish."\r\n\r\n"But that," her friend observed after a moment, "was for silence to\r\nKate."\r\n\r\n"Yes--but Mrs. Condrip would immediately have told Kate."\r\n\r\n"Why so?--since she must dislike to talk about him."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Condrip must?" Milly thought. "What she would like most is that\r\nher sister should be brought to think ill of him; and if anything she\r\ncan tell her will help that--" But Milly dropped suddenly here, as if\r\nher companion would see.\r\n\r\nHer companion\'s interest, however, was all for what she herself saw.\r\n"You mean she\'ll immediately speak?" Mrs. Stringham gathered that this\r\nwas what Milly meant, but it left still a question. "How will it be\r\nagainst him that you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. It won\'t be so much one\'s knowing him as one\'s\r\nhaving kept it out of sight."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Mrs. Stringham, as if for comfort, _"you_ haven\'t kept it\r\nout of sight. Isn\'t it much rather Miss Croy herself who has?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t my acquaintance with him," Milly smiled, "that she has\r\ndissimulated."\r\n\r\n"She has dissimulated only her own? Well then, the responsibility\'s\r\nhers."\r\n\r\n"Ah but," said the girl, not perhaps with marked consequence, "she has\r\na right to do as she likes."\r\n\r\n"Then so, my dear, have you!" smiled Susan Shepherd.\r\n\r\nMilly looked at her as if she were almost venerably simple, but also as\r\nif this were what one loved her for. "We\'re not quarrelling about it,\r\nKate and I, _yet."_\r\n\r\n"I only meant," Mrs. Stringham explained, "that I don\'t see what Mrs.\r\nCondrip would gain."\r\n\r\n"By her being able to tell Kate?" Milly thought. "I only meant that I\r\ndon\'t see what I myself should gain."\r\n\r\n"But it will have to come out--that he knows you both--some time."\r\n\r\nMilly scarce assented. "Do you mean when he comes back?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll find you both here, and he can hardly be looked to, I take it,\r\nto \'cut\' either of you for the sake of the other."\r\n\r\nThis placed the question at last on a basis more distinctly cheerful.\r\n"I might get at him somehow beforehand," the girl suggested; "I might\r\ngive him what they call here the tip--that he\'s not to know me when we\r\nmeet. Or, better still, I mightn\'t be here at all."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to run away from him?"\r\n\r\nIt was, oddly enough, an idea Milly seemed half to accept. "I don\'t\r\nknow _what_ I want to run away from!"\r\n\r\nIt dispelled, on the spot--something, to the elder woman\'s ear, in the\r\nsad, sweet sound of it--any ghost of any need of explaining. The sense\r\nwas constant for her that their relation was as if afloat, like some\r\nisland of the south, in a great warm sea that made, for every\r\nconceivable chance, a margin, an outer sphere of general emotion; and\r\nthe effect of the occurrence of anything in particular was to make the\r\nsea submerge the island, the margin flood the text. The great wave now\r\nfor a moment swept over. "I\'ll go anywhere else in the world you like."\r\n\r\nBut Milly came up through it. "Dear old Susie--how I do work you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is nothing yet."\r\n\r\n"No indeed--to what it will be."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not--and it\'s vain to pretend," said dear old Susie, who had\r\nbeen taking her in, "as sound and strong as I insist on having you."\r\n\r\n"Insist, insist--the more the better. But the day I _look_ as sound and\r\nstrong as that, you know," Milly went on--"on that day I shall be just\r\nsound and strong enough to take leave of you sweetly for ever. That\'s\r\nwhere one is," she continued thus agreeably to embroider, "when even\r\none\'s _most_ \'beaux moments\' aren\'t such as to qualify, so far as\r\nappearance goes, for anything gayer than a handsome cemetery. Since\r\nI\'ve lived all these years as if I were dead, I shall die, no doubt, as\r\nif I were alive--which will happen to be as you want me. So, you see,"\r\nshe wound up, "you\'ll never really know where I am. Except indeed when\r\nI\'m gone; and then you\'ll only know where I\'m not."\r\n\r\n"I\'d die _for_ you," said Susan Shepherd after a moment.\r\n\r\n"\'Thanks awfully\'! Then stay here for me."\r\n\r\n"But we can\'t be in London for August, nor for many of all these next\r\nweeks."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll go back."\r\n\r\nSusie blenched. "Back to America?"\r\n\r\n"No, abroad--to Switzerland, Italy, anywhere. I mean by your staying\r\nhere for me," Milly pursued, "your staying with me wherever I may be,\r\neven though we may neither of us know at the time where it is. No," she\r\ninsisted, "I _don\'t_ know where I am, and you never will, and it\r\ndoesn\'t matter--and I dare say it\'s quite true," she broke off, "that\r\neverything will have to come out." Her friend would have felt of her\r\nthat she joked about it now, had not her scale from grave to gay been a\r\nthing of such unnamable shades that her contrasts were never sharp. She\r\nmade up for failures of gravity by failures of mirth; if she hadn\'t,\r\nthat is, been at times as earnest as might have been liked, so she was\r\ncertain not to be at other times as easy as she would like herself. "I\r\nmust face the music. It isn\'t, at any rate, its \'coming out,\'" she\r\nadded; "it\'s that Mrs. Condrip would put the fact before her to his\r\ninjury."\r\n\r\nHer companion wondered. "But how to _his?"_\r\n\r\n"Why, if he pretends to love her----!"\r\n\r\n"And does he only \'pretend\'?"\r\n\r\n"I mean if, trusted by her in strange countries, he forgets her so far\r\nas to make up to other people."\r\n\r\nThe amendment, however, brought Susie in, as if with gaiety, for a\r\ncomfortable end. "Did he make up, the false creature, to _you?"_\r\n\r\n"No--but the question isn\'t of that. It\'s of what Kate might be made to\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\n"That, given the fact that he evidently more or less followed up his\r\nacquaintance with you, to say nothing of your obvious weird charm, he\r\nmust have been all ready if you had at all led him on?"\r\n\r\nMilly neither accepted nor qualified this; she only said, after a\r\nmoment, as with a conscious excess of the pensive: "No, I don\'t think\r\nshe\'d quite wish to suggest that I made up to _him;_ for that I should\r\nhave had to do so would only bring out his constancy. All I mean is,"\r\nshe added--and now at last, as with a supreme impatience "that her\r\nbeing able to make him out a little a person who could give cause for\r\njealousy would evidently help her, since she\'s afraid of him, to do him\r\nin her sister\'s mind a useful ill turn."\r\n\r\nSusan Shepherd perceived in this explanation such signs of an appetite\r\nfor motive as would have sat gracefully even on one of her own New\r\nEngland heroines. It was seeing round several corners; but that was\r\nwhat New England heroines did, and it was moreover interesting for the\r\nmoment to make out how many really her young friend had undertaken to\r\nsee round. Finally, too, weren\'t they braving the deeps? They got their\r\namusement where they could. "Isn\'t it only," she asked, "rather\r\nprobable she\'d see that Kate\'s knowing him as (what\'s the pretty old\r\nword?) _volage_----?"\r\n\r\n"Well?" She hadn\'t filled out her idea, but neither, it seemed, could\r\nMilly.\r\n\r\n"Well, might but do what that often does--by all _our_ blessed little\r\nlaws and arrangements at least; excite Kate\'s own sentiment instead of\r\ndepressing it."\r\n\r\nThe idea was bright, yet the girl but beautifully stared. "Kate\'s own\r\nsentiment? Oh, she didn\'t speak of that. I don\'t think," she added as\r\nif she had been unconsciously giving a wrong impression, "I don\'t think\r\nMrs. Condrip imagines _she\'s_ in love."\r\n\r\nIt made Mrs. Stringham stare in turn. "Then what\'s her fear?"\r\n\r\n"Well, only the fact of Mr. Densher\'s possibly himself keeping it\r\nup--the fear of some final result from _that._\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Susie, intellectually a little disconcerted--"she looks far\r\nahead!"\r\n\r\nAt this, however, Milly threw off another of her sudden vague "sports."\r\n"No--it\'s only we who do."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t let us be more interested for them than they are for\r\nthemselves!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not"--the girl promptly assented. A certain interest\r\nnevertheless remained; she appeared to wish to be clear. "It wasn\'t of\r\nanything on Kate\'s own part she spoke."\r\n\r\n"You mean she thinks her sister does _not_ care for him?"\r\n\r\nIt was still as if, for an instant, Milly had to be sure of what she\r\nmeant; but there it presently was. "If she did care Mrs. Condrip would\r\nhave told me."\r\n\r\nWhat Susan Shepherd seemed hereupon for a little to wonder was why then\r\nthey had been talking so. "But did you ask her?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, no!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Susan Shepherd.\r\n\r\nMilly, however, easily explained that she wouldn\'t have asked her for\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nLord Mark looked at her to-day in particular as if to wring from her a\r\nconfession that she had originally done him injustice; and he was\r\nentitled to whatever there might be in it of advantage or merit that\r\nhis intention really in a manner took effect: he cared about something,\r\nthat is, after all, sufficiently to make her feel absurdly as if she\r\n_were_ confessing--all the while it was quite the case that neither\r\njustice nor injustice was what had been in question between them. He\r\nhad presented himself at the hotel, had found her and had found Susan\r\nShepherd at home, had been "civil" to Susan--it was just that shade,\r\nand Susan\'s fancy had fondly caught it; and then had come again and\r\nmissed them, and then had come and found them once more: besides\r\nletting them easily see that if it hadn\'t by this time been the end of\r\neverything--which they could feel in the exhausted air, that of the\r\nseason at its last gasp--the places they might have liked to go to were\r\nsuch as they would have had only to mention. Their feeling was--or at\r\nany rate their modest general plea--that there was no place they would\r\nhave liked to go to; there was only the sense of finding they liked,\r\nwherever they were, the place to which they had been brought. Such was\r\nhighly the case as to their current consciousness--which could be\r\nindeed, in an equally eminent degree, but a matter of course;\r\nimpressions this afternoon having by a happy turn of their wheel been\r\ngathered for them into a splendid cluster, an offering like an armful\r\nof the rarest flowers. They were in presence of the offering--they had\r\nbeen led up to it; and if it had been still their habit to look at each\r\nother across distances for increase of unanimity his hand would have\r\nbeen silently named between them as the hand applied to the wheel. He\r\nhad administered the touch that, under light analysis, made the\r\ndifference--the difference of their not having lost, as Susie on the\r\nspot and at the hour phrased it again and again, both for herself and\r\nfor such others as the question might concern, so beautiful and\r\ninteresting an experience; the difference also, in fact, of Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s not having lost it either, though it was with Mrs. Lowder,\r\nsuperficially, they had come, and though it was further with that lady\r\nthat our young woman was directly engaged during the half-hour or so of\r\nher most agreeably inward response to the scene.\r\n\r\nThe great historic house had, for Milly, beyond terrace and garden, as\r\nthe centre of an almost extravagantly grand Watteau-composition, a tone\r\nas of old gold kept "down" by the quality of the air, summer\r\nfull-flushed, but attuned to the general perfect taste. Much, by her\r\nmeasure, for the previous hour, appeared, in connection with this\r\nrevelation of it, to have happened to her--a quantity expressed in\r\nintroductions of charming new people, in walks through halls of armour,\r\nof pictures, of cabinets, of tapestry, of tea-tables, in an assault of\r\nreminders that this largeness of style was the sign of _appointed_\r\nfelicity. The largeness of style was the great containing vessel, while\r\neverything else, the pleasant personal affluence, the easy, murmurous\r\nwelcome, the honoured age of illustrious host and hostess, all at once\r\nso distinguished and so plain, so public and so shy, became but this or\r\nthat element of the infusion. The elements melted together and seasoned\r\nthe draught, the essence of which might have struck the girl as\r\ndistilled into the small cup of iced coffee she had vaguely accepted\r\nfrom somebody, while a fuller flood, somehow, kept bearing her up--all\r\nthe freshness of response of her young life the freshness of the first\r\nand only prime. What had perhaps brought on just now a kind of climax\r\nwas the fact of her appearing to make out, through Aunt Maud, what was\r\nreally the matter. It couldn\'t be less than a climax for a poor shaky\r\nmaiden to find it put to her of a sudden that she herself was the\r\nmatter--for that was positively what, on Mrs. Lowder\'s part, it came\r\nto. Everything was great, of course, in great pictures, and it was\r\ndoubtless precisely a part of the brilliant life--since the brilliant\r\nlife, as one had faintly figured it, clearly _was_ humanly led--that\r\nall impressions within its area partook of its brilliancy; still,\r\nletting that pass, it fairly stamped an hour as with the official seal\r\nfor one to be able to take in so comfortably one\'s companion\'s broad\r\nblandness. "You must stay among us--you must stay; anything else is\r\nimpossible and ridiculous; you don\'t know yet, no doubt--you can\'t; but\r\nyou will soon enough: you can stay in _any_ position." It had been as\r\nthe murmurous consecration to follow the murmurous welcome; and even if\r\nit were but part of Aunt Maud\'s own spiritual ebriety--for the dear\r\nwoman, one could see, was spiritually "keeping" the day--it served to\r\nMilly, then and afterwards, as a high-water mark of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was to be the end of the short parenthesis which had begun but the\r\nother day at Lancaster Gate with Lord Mark\'s informing her that she was\r\na "success"--the key thus again struck; and though no distinct, no\r\nnumbered revelations had crowded in, there had, as we have seen, been\r\nplenty of incident for the space and the time. There had been thrice as\r\nmuch, and all gratuitous and genial--if, in portions, not exactly\r\nhitherto _the_ revelation--as three unprepared weeks could have been\r\nexpected to produce. Mrs. Lowder had improvised a "rush" for them, but\r\nout of elements, as Milly was now a little more freely aware, somewhat\r\nroughly combined. Therefore if at this very instant she had her reasons\r\nfor thinking of the parenthesis as about to close--reasons completely\r\npersonal--she had on behalf of her companion a divination almost as\r\ndeep. The parenthesis would close with this admirable picture, but the\r\nadmirable picture still would show Aunt Maud as not absolutely sure\r\neither if she herself were destined to remain in it. What she was\r\ndoing, Milly might even not have escaped seeming to see, was to talk\r\nherself into a sublimer serenity while she ostensibly talked Milly. It\r\nwas fine, the girl fully felt, the way she did talk _her,_ little as,\r\nat bottom, our young woman needed it or found other persuasions at\r\nfault. It was in particular during the minutes of her grateful\r\nabsorption of iced coffee--qualified by a sharp doubt of her\r\nwisdom--that she most had in view Lord Mark\'s relation to her being\r\nthere, or at least to the question of her being amused at it. It\r\nwouldn\'t have taken much by the end of five minutes quite to make her\r\nfeel that this relation was charming. It might, once more, simply have\r\nbeen that everything, anything, was charming when one was so justly and\r\ncompletely charmed; but, frankly, she had not supposed anything so\r\nserenely sociable could define itself between them as the friendly\r\nunderstanding that was at present somehow in the air. They were, many\r\nof them together, near the marquee that had been erected on a stretch\r\nof sward as a temple of refreshment and that happened to have the\r\nproperty--which was all to the good of making Milly think of a\r\n"durbar"; her iced coffee had been a consequence of this connection, in\r\nwhich, further, the bright company scattered about fell thoroughly into\r\nplace. Certain of its members might have represented the contingent of\r\n"native princes"--familiar, but scarce the less grandly gregarious\r\nterm!--and Lord Mark would have done for one of these even though for\r\nchoice he but presented himself as a supervisory friend of the family.\r\nThe Lancaster Gate family, he clearly intended, in which he included\r\nits American recruits, and included above all Kate Croy--a young person\r\nblessedly easy to take care of. She knew people, and people knew her,\r\nand she was the handsomest thing there--this last a declaration made by\r\nMilly, in a sort of soft mid-summer madness, a straight skylark-flight\r\nof charity, to Aunt Maud.\r\n\r\nKate had, for her new friend\'s eyes, the extraordinary and attaching\r\nproperty of appearing at a given moment to show as a beautiful\r\nstranger, to cut her connections and lose her identity, letting the\r\nimagination for the time make what it would of them--make her merely a\r\nperson striking from afar, more and more pleasing as one watched, but\r\nwho was above all a subject for curiosity. Nothing could have given\r\nher, as a party to a relation, a greater freshness than this\r\nsense--which sprang up at its own hours--of being as curious about her\r\nas if one hadn\'t known her. It had sprung up, we have gathered, as soon\r\nas Milly had seen her after hearing from Mrs. Stringham of her\r\nknowledge of Merton Densher; she had _looked_ then other and, as Milly\r\nknew the real critical mind would call it, more objective; and our\r\nyoung woman had foreseen it of her, on the spot, that she would often\r\nlook so again. It was exactly what she was doing this afternoon; and\r\nMilly, who had amusements of thought that were like the secrecies of a\r\nlittle girl playing with dolls when conventionally "too big," could\r\nalmost settle to the game of what one would suppose her, how one would\r\nplace her, if one didn\'t know her. She became thus, intermittently, a\r\nfigure conditioned only by the great facts of aspect, a figure to be\r\nwaited for, named and fitted. This was doubtless but a way of feeling\r\nthat it was of her essence to be peculiarly what the occasion, whatever\r\nit might be, demanded when its demand was highest. There were probably\r\nways enough, on these lines, for such a consciousness; another of them\r\nwould be, for instance, to say that she was made for great social uses.\r\nMilly was not wholly sure that she herself knew what great social uses\r\nmight be--unless, as a good example, exerting just that sort of glamour\r\nin just that sort of frame were one of them: she would have fallen back\r\non knowing sufficiently that they existed at all events for her friend.\r\nIt imputed a primness, all round, to be reduced but to saying, by way\r\nof a translation of one\'s amusement, that she was always so\r\n_right_--since that, too often, was what the _insupportables_\r\nthemselves were; yet it was, in overflow to Aunt Maud, what she had to\r\ncontent herself withal--save for the lame enhancement of saying she was\r\nlovely. It served, all the same, the purpose, strengthened the bond\r\nthat for the time held the two ladies together, distilled in short its\r\ndrop of rose-colour for Mrs. Lowder\'s own view. That was really the\r\nview Milly had, for most of the rest of the occasion, to give herself\r\nto immediately taking in; but it didn\'t prevent the continued play of\r\nthose swift cross-lights, odd beguilements of the mind, at which we\r\nhave already glanced.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lowder herself found it enough simply to reply, in respect to\r\nKate, that she was indeed a luxury to take about the world: she\r\nexpressed no more surprise than that at her "rightness" to-day. Wasn\'t\r\nit by this time sufficiently manifest that it was precisely as the very\r\nluxury she was proving that she had, from far back, been appraised and\r\nwaited for? Crude elation, however, might be kept at bay, and the\r\ncircumstance none the less demonstrated that they were all swimming\r\ntogether in the blue. It came back to Lord Mark again, as he seemed\r\nslowly to pass and repass and conveniently to linger before them; he\r\nwas personally the note of the blue--like a suspended skein of silk\r\nwithin reach of the broiderer\'s hand. Aunt Maud\'s free-moving shuttle\r\ntook a length of him at rhythmic intervals; and one of the intermixed\r\ntruths that flickered across to Milly was that he ever so consentingly\r\nknew he was being worked in. This was almost like an understanding with\r\nher at Mrs. Lowder\'s expense, which she would have none of; she\r\nwouldn\'t for the world have had him make any such point as that he\r\nwouldn\'t have launched them at Matcham--or whatever it was he _had_\r\ndone--only for Aunt Maud\'s _beaux yeux._ What he had done, it would\r\nhave been guessable, was something he had for some time been desired in\r\nvain to do; and what they were all now profiting by was a change\r\ncomparatively sudden, the cessation of hope delayed. What had caused\r\nthe cessation easily showed itself as none of Milly\'s business; and she\r\nwas luckily, for that matter, in no real danger of hearing from him\r\ndirectly that her individual weight had been felt in the scale. Why\r\nthen indeed was it an effect of his diffused but subdued participation\r\nthat he might absolutely have been saying to her "Yes, let the dear\r\nwoman take her own tone? Since she\'s here she may stay," he might have\r\nbeen adding--"for whatever she can make of it. But you and I are\r\ndifferent." Milly knew _she_ was different in truth--his own difference\r\nwas his own affair; but also she knew that, after all, even at their\r\ndistinctest, Lord Mark\'s "tips" in this line would be tacit. He\r\npractically placed her--it came round again to that--under no\r\nobligation whatever. It was a matter of equal ease, moreover, her\r\nletting Mrs. Lowder take a tone. She might have taken twenty--they\r\nwould have spoiled nothing.\r\n\r\n"You must stay on with us; you _can,_ you know, in any position you\r\nlike; any, any, _any,_ my dear child"--and her emphasis went deep. "You\r\nmust make your home with us; and it\'s really open to you to make the\r\nmost beautiful one in the world. You mustn\'t be under a mistake--under\r\nany of any sort; and you must let us all think for you a little, take\r\ncare of you and watch over you. Above all you must help me with Kate,\r\nand you must stay a little _for_ her; nothing for a long time has\r\nhappened to me so good as that you and she should have become friends.\r\nIt\'s beautiful; it\'s great; it\'s everything. What makes it perfect is\r\nthat it should have come about through our dear delightful Susie,\r\nrestored to me, after so many years, by such a miracle. No--that\'s more\r\ncharming to me than even your hitting it off with Kate. God has been\r\ngood to one--positively; for I couldn\'t, at my age, have made a new\r\nfriend--undertaken, I mean, out of whole cloth, the real thing. It\'s\r\nlike changing one\'s bankers--after fifty: one doesn\'t do that. That\'s\r\nwhy Susie has been kept for me, as you seem to keep people in your\r\nwonderful country, in lavender and pink paper--coming back at last as\r\nstraight as out of a fairy-tale and with you as an attendant fairy."\r\nMilly hereupon replied appreciatively that such a description of\r\nherself made her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender its\r\ntrimming; but Aunt Maud was not to be deterred by a weak joke from\r\nkeeping it up. Her interlocutress could feel besides that she kept it\r\nup in perfect sincerity. She was somehow at this hour a very happy\r\nwoman, and a part of her happiness might precisely have been that her\r\naffections and her views were moving as never before in concert.\r\nUnquestionably she loved Susie; but she also loved Kate and loved Lord\r\nMark, loved their funny old host and hostess, loved every one within\r\nrange, down to the very servant who came to receive Milly\'s empty\r\niceplate--down, for that matter, to Milly herself, who was, while she\r\ntalked, really conscious of the enveloping flap of a protective mantle,\r\na shelter with the weight of an eastern carpet. An eastern carpet, for\r\nwishing-purposes of one\'s own, was a thing to be on rather than under;\r\nstill, however, if the girl should fail of breath it wouldn\'t be, she\r\ncould feel, by Mrs. Lowder\'s fault. One of the last things she was\r\nafterwards to recall of this was Aunt Maud\'s going on to say that she\r\nand Kate must stand together because together they could do anything.\r\nIt was for Kate of course she was essentially planning; but the plan,\r\nenlarged and uplifted now, somehow required Milly\'s prosperity too for\r\nits full operation, just as Milly\'s prosperity at the same time\r\ninvolved Kate\'s. It was nebulous yet, it was slightly confused, but it\r\nwas unmistakably free and genial, and it made our young woman\r\nunderstand things Kate had said of her aunt\'s possibilities as well as\r\ncharacterisations that had fallen from Susan Shepherd. One of the most\r\nfrequent on the lips of the latter had been that dear Maud was a\r\nnatural force.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nA prime reason, we must add, why sundry impressions were not to be\r\nfully present to the girl till later on was that they yielded at this\r\nstage, with an effect of sharp supersession, to a detached quarter of\r\nan hour--her only one--with Lord Mark. "Have you seen the picture in\r\nthe house, the beautiful one that\'s so like you?"--he was asking that\r\nas he stood before her; having come up at last with his smooth\r\nintimation that any wire he had pulled and yet wanted not to remind her\r\nof wasn\'t quite a reason for his having no joy at all.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been through rooms and I\'ve seen pictures. But if I\'m \'like\'\r\nanything so beautiful as most of them seemed to me----!" It needed in\r\nshort for Milly some evidence, which he only wanted to supply. She was\r\nthe image of the wonderful Bronzino, which she must have a look at on\r\nevery ground. He had thus called her off and led her away; the more\r\neasily that the house within was above all what had already drawn round\r\nher its mystic circle. Their progress, meanwhile, was not of the\r\nstraightest; it was an advance, without haste, through innumerable\r\nnatural pauses and soft concussions, determined for the most part by\r\nthe appearance before them of ladies and gentlemen, singly, in couples,\r\nin groups, who brought them to a stand with an inveterate "I say,\r\nMark." What they said she never quite made out; it was their all so\r\ndomestically knowing him, and his knowing them, that mainly struck her,\r\nwhile her impression, for the rest, was but of fellow-strollers more\r\nvaguely afloat than themselves, supernumeraries mostly a little\r\nbattered, whether as jaunty males or as ostensibly elegant women. They\r\nmight have been moving a good deal by a momentum that had begun far\r\nback, but they were still brave and personable, still warranted for\r\ncontinuance as long again, and they gave her, in especial collectively,\r\na sense of pleasant voices, pleasanter than those of actors, of\r\nfriendly, empty words and kind, lingering eyes. The lingering eyes\r\nlooked her over, the lingering eyes were what went, in almost confessed\r\nsimplicity, with the pointless "I say, Mark "; and what was really most\r\nsensible of all was that, as a pleasant matter of course, if she didn\'t\r\nmind, he seemed to suggest their letting people, poor dear things, have\r\nthe benefit of her.\r\n\r\nThe odd part was that he made her herself believe, for amusement, in\r\nthe benefit, measured by him in mere manner--for wonderful, of a truth,\r\nwas, as a means of expression, his slightness of emphasis--that her\r\npresent good-nature conferred. It was, as she could easily see, a mild\r\ncommon carnival of good-nature--a mass of London people together, of\r\nsorts and sorts, but who mainly knew each other and who, in their way,\r\ndid, no doubt, confess to curiosity. It had gone round that she was\r\nthere; questions about her would be passing; the easiest thing was to\r\nrun the gauntlet with _him_--just as the easiest thing was in fact to\r\ntrust him generally. Couldn\'t she know for herself, passively, how\r\nlittle harm they meant her?--to that extent that it made no difference\r\nwhether or not he introduced them. The strangest thing of all for Milly\r\nwas perhaps the uplifted assurance and indifference with which she\r\ncould simply give back the particular bland stare that appeared in such\r\ncases to mark civilisation at its highest. It was so little her fault,\r\nthis oddity of what had "gone round" about her, that to accept it\r\nwithout question might be as good a way as another of feeling life. It\r\nwas inevitable to supply the probable description--that of the awfully\r\nrich young American who was so queer to behold, but nice, by all\r\naccounts, to know; and she had really but one instant of speculation as\r\nto fables or fantasies perchance originally launched. She asked herself\r\nonce only if Susie could, inconceivably, have been blatant about her;\r\nfor the question, on the spot, was really blown away for ever. She knew\r\nin fact on the spot and with sharpness just why she had "elected" Susan\r\nShepherd: she had had from the first hour the conviction of her being\r\nprecisely the person in the world least possibly a trumpeter. So it\r\nwasn\'t their fault, it wasn\'t their fault, and anything might happen\r\nthat would, and everything now again melted together, and kind eyes\r\nwere always kind eyes--if it were never to be worse than that! She got\r\nwith her companion into the house; they brushed, beneficently, past all\r\ntheir accidents. The Bronzino was, it appeared, deep within, and the\r\nlong afternoon light lingered for them on patches of old colour and\r\nwaylaid them, as they went, in nooks and opening vistas.\r\n\r\nIt was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark had really had something\r\nother than this spoken pretext in view; as if there were something he\r\nwanted to say to her and were only--consciously yet not awkwardly, just\r\ndelicately--hanging fire. At the same time it was as if the thing had\r\npractically been said by the moment they came in sight of the picture;\r\nsince what it appeared to amount to was "Do let a fellow who isn\'t a\r\nfool take care of you a little." The thing somehow, with the aid of the\r\nBronzino, was done; it hadn\'t seemed to matter to her before if he were\r\na fool or no; but now, just where they were, she liked his not being;\r\nand it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of\r\nthe same sound as Mrs. Lowder\'s so recent reminder. She too wished to\r\ntake care of her--and wasn\'t it, _\xe0 peu pr\xe8s_ what all the people with\r\nthe kind eyes were wishing? Once more things melted together--the\r\nbeauty and the history and the facility and the splendid midsummer\r\nglow: it was a sort of magnificent maximum, the pink dawn of an\r\napotheosis, coming so curiously soon. What in fact befell was that, as\r\nshe afterwards made out, it was Lord Mark who said nothing in\r\nparticular--it was she herself who said all. She couldn\'t help that--it\r\ncame; and the reason it came was that she found herself, for the first\r\nmoment, looking at the mysterious portrait through tears. Perhaps it\r\nwas her tears that made it just then so strange and fair--as wonderful\r\nas he had said: the face of a young woman, all magnificently drawn,\r\ndown to the hands, and magnificently dressed; a face almost livid in\r\nhue, yet handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled\r\nback and high, that must, before fading with time, have had a family\r\nresemblance to her own. The lady in question, at all events, with her\r\nslightly Michaelangelesque squareness, her eyes of other days, her full\r\nlips, her long neck, her recorded jewels, her brocaded and wasted reds,\r\nwas a very great personage--only unaccompanied by a joy. And she was\r\ndead, dead, dead. Milly recognised her exactly in words that had\r\nnothing to do with her. "I shall never be better than this."\r\n\r\nHe smiled for her at the portrait. "Than she? You\'d scarce need to be\r\nbetter, for surely that\'s well enough. But you _are,_ one feels, as it\r\nhappens, better; because, splendid as she is, one doubts if she was\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t understood. She was before the picture, but she had turned to\r\nhim, and she didn\'t care if, for the minute, he noticed her tears. It\r\nwas probably as good a moment as she should ever have with him. It was\r\nperhaps as good a moment as she should have with any one, or have in\r\nany connection whatever. "I mean that everything this afternoon has\r\nbeen too beautiful, and that perhaps everything together will never be\r\nso right again. I\'m very glad therefore you\'ve been a part of it."\r\n\r\nThough he still didn\'t understand her he was as nice as if he had; he\r\ndidn\'t ask for insistence, and that was just a part of his looking\r\nafter her. He simply protected her now from herself, and there was a\r\nworld of practice in it. "Oh, we must talk about these things!"\r\n\r\nAh, they had already done that, she knew, as much as she ever would;\r\nand she was shaking her head at her pale sister the next moment with a\r\nworld, on her side, of slowness. "I wish I could see the resemblance.\r\nOf course her complexion\'s green," she laughed; "but mine\'s several\r\nshades greener."\r\n\r\n"It\'s down to the very hands," said Lord Mark.\r\n\r\n"Her hands are large," Milly went on, "but mine are larger. Mine are\r\nhuge."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you go her, all round, \'one better\'--which is just what I said.\r\nBut you\'re a pair. You must surely catch it," he added as if it were\r\nimportant to his character as a serious man not to appear to have\r\ninvented his plea.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know one never knows one\'s self. It\'s a funny fancy, and I\r\ndon\'t imagine it would have occurred----"\r\n\r\n"I see it _has_ occurred"--he has already taken her up. She had her\r\nback, as she faced the picture, to one of the doors of the room, which\r\nwas open, and on her turning, as he spoke, she saw that they were in\r\nthe presence of three other persons, also, as appeared, interested\r\ninquirers. Kate Croy was one of these; Lord Mark had just become aware\r\nof her, and she, all arrested, had immediately seen, and made the best\r\nof it, that she was far from being first in the field. She had brought\r\na lady and a gentleman to whom she wished to show what Lord Mark was\r\nshowing Milly, and he took her straightway as a reinforcement. Kate\r\nherself had spoken, however, before he had had time to tell her so.\r\n\r\n_"You_ had noticed too?"--she smiled at him without looking at Milly.\r\n"Then I\'m not original--which one always hopes one has been. But the\r\nlikeness is so great." And now she looked at Milly--for whom again it\r\nwas, all round indeed, kind, kind eyes. "Yes, there you are, my dear,\r\nif you want to know. And you\'re superb." She took now but a glance at\r\nthe picture, though it was enough to make her question to her friends\r\nnot too straight. "Isn\'t she superb?"\r\n\r\n"I brought Miss Theale," Lord Mark explained to the latter, "quite off\r\nmy own bat."\r\n\r\n"I wanted Lady Aldershaw," Kate continued to Milly, "to see for\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n_"Les grands esprits se rencontrent!"_ laughed her attendant gentleman,\r\na high, but slightly stooping, shambling and wavering person, who\r\nrepresented urbanity by the liberal aid of certain prominent front\r\nteeth and whom Milly vaguely took for some sort of great man.\r\n\r\nLady Aldershaw meanwhile looked at Milly quite as if Milly had been the\r\nBronzino and the Bronzino only Milly. "Superb, superb. Of course I had\r\nnoticed you. It is wonderful," she went on with her back to the\r\npicture, but with some other eagerness which Milly felt gathering,\r\ndirecting her motions now. It was enough--they were introduced, and she\r\nwas saying "I wonder if you could give us the pleasure of coming----"\r\nShe was not fresh, for she was not young, even though she denied at\r\nevery pore that she was old; but she was vivid and much bejewelled for\r\nthe midsummer daylight; and she was all in the palest pinks and blues.\r\nShe didn\'t think, at this pass, that she could "come" anywhere--Milly\r\ndidn\'t; and she already knew that somehow Lord Mark was saving her from\r\nthe question. He had interposed, taking the words out of the lady\'s\r\nmouth and not caring at all if the lady minded. That was clearly the\r\nright way to treat her--at least for him; as she had only dropped,\r\nsmiling, and then turned away with him. She had been dealt with--it\r\nwould have done an enemy good. The gentleman still stood, a little\r\nhelpless, addressing himself to the intention of urbanity as if it were\r\na large loud whistle; he had been signing sympathy, in his way, while\r\nthe lady made her overture; and Milly had, in this light, soon arrived\r\nat their identity. They were Lord and Lady Aldershaw, and the wife was\r\nthe clever one. A minute or two later the situation had changed, and\r\nshe knew it afterwards to have been by the subtle operation of Kate.\r\nShe was herself saying that she was afraid she must go now if Susie\r\ncould be found; but she was sitting down on the nearest seat to say it.\r\nThe prospect, through opened doors, stretched before her into other\r\nrooms, down the vista of which Lord Mark was strolling with Lady\r\nAldershaw, who, close to him and much intent, seemed to show from\r\nbehind as peculiarly expert. Lord Aldershaw, for his part, had been\r\nleft in the middle of the room, while Kate, with her back to him, was\r\nstanding before her with much sweetness of manner. The sweetness was\r\nall for _her;_ she had the sense of the poor gentleman\'s having somehow\r\nbeen handled as Lord Mark had handled his wife. He dangled there, he\r\nshambled a little; then he bethought himself of the Bronzino, before\r\nwhich, with his eyeglass, he hovered. It drew from him an odd, vague\r\nsound, not wholly distinct from a grunt, and a "Humph--most\r\nremarkable!" which lighted Kate\'s face with amusement. The next moment\r\nhe had creaked away, over polished floors, after the others, and Milly\r\nwas feeling as if _she_ had been rude. But Lord Aldershaw was in every\r\nway a detail, and Kate was saying to her that she hoped she wasn\'t ill.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, aloft there in the great gilded historic chamber and\r\nthe presence of the pale personage on the wall, whose eyes all the\r\nwhile seemed engaged with her own, she found herself suddenly sunk in\r\nsomething quite intimate and humble and to which these grandeurs were\r\nstrange enough witnesses. It had come up, in the form in which she had\r\nhad to accept it, all suddenly, and nothing about it, at the same time,\r\nwas more marked than that she had in a manner plunged into it to escape\r\nfrom something else. Something else, from her first vision of her\r\nfriend\'s appearance three minutes before, had been present to her even\r\nthrough the call made by the others on her attention; something that\r\nwas perversely _there,_ she was more and more uncomfortably finding, at\r\nleast for the first moments and by some spring of its own, with every\r\nrenewal of their meeting. "Is it the way she looks to _him?"_ she asked\r\nherself--the perversity being that she kept in remembrance that Kate\r\nwas known to him. It wasn\'t a fault in Kate--nor in him assuredly; and\r\nshe had a horror, being generous and tender, of treating either of them\r\nas if it had been. To Densher himself she couldn\'t make it up--he was\r\ntoo far away; but her secondary impulse was to make it up to Kate. She\r\ndid so now with a strange soft energy--the impulse immediately acting.\r\n"Will you render me to-morrow a great service?"\r\n\r\n"Any service, dear child, in the world."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a secret one--nobody must know. I must be wicked and false\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m your woman," Kate smiled, "for that\'s the kind of thing I\r\nlove. _Do_ let us do something bad. You\'re impossibly without sin, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nMilly\'s eyes, on this, remained a little with their companion\'s. "Ah, I\r\nshan\'t perhaps come up to your idea. It\'s only to deceive Susan\r\nShepherd."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Kate as if this were indeed mild.\r\n\r\n"But thoroughly--as thoroughly as I can."\r\n\r\n"And for cheating," Kate asked, "my powers will contribute? Well, I\'ll\r\ndo my best for you." In accordance with which it was presently settled\r\nbetween them that Milly should have the aid and comfort of her presence\r\nfor a visit to Sir Luke Strett. Kate had needed a minute for\r\nenlightenment, and it was quite grand for her comrade that this name\r\nshould have said nothing to her. To Milly herself it had for some days\r\nbeen secretly saying much. The personage in question was, as she\r\nexplained, the greatest of medical lights if she had got hold, as she\r\nbelieved (and she had used to this end the wisdom of the serpent) of\r\nthe right, the special man. She had written to him three days before,\r\nand he had named her an hour, eleven-twenty; only it had come to her,\r\non the eve, that she couldn\'t go alone. Her maid, on the other hand,\r\nwasn\'t good enough, and Susie was too good. Kate had listened, above\r\nall, with high indulgence. "And I\'m betwixt and between, happy thought!\r\nToo good for what?"\r\n\r\nMilly thought. "Why, to be worried if it\'s nothing. And to be still\r\nmore worried--I mean before she need be--if it isn\'t."\r\n\r\nKate fixed her with deep eyes. "What in the world is the matter with\r\nyou?" It had inevitably a sound of impatience, as if it had been a\r\nchallenge really to produce something; so that Milly felt her for the\r\nmoment only as a much older person, standing above her a little,\r\ndoubting the imagined ailments, suspecting the easy complaints, of\r\nignorant youth. It somewhat checked her, further, that the matter with\r\nher was what exactly as yet she wanted knowledge about; and she\r\nimmediately declared, for conciliation, that if she were merely\r\nfanciful Kate would see her put to shame. Kate vividly uttered, in\r\nreturn, the hope that, since she could come out and be so charming,\r\ncould so universally dazzle and interest, she wasn\'t all the while in\r\ndistress or in anxiety--didn\'t believe herself, in short, to be in any\r\ndegree seriously menaced. "Well, I want to make out--to make out!" was\r\nall that this consistently produced. To which Kate made clear answer:\r\n"Ah then, let us by all means!"\r\n\r\n"I thought," Milly said, "you would like to help me. But I must ask\r\nyou, please, for the promise of absolute silence."\r\n\r\n"And how, if you _are_ ill, can your friends remain in ignorance?"\r\n\r\n"Well, if I am, it must of course finally come out. But I can go for a\r\nlong time." Milly spoke with her eyes again on her painted\r\nsister\'s--almost as if under their suggestion. She still sat there\r\nbefore Kate, yet not without a light in her face. "That will be one of\r\nmy advantages. I think I could die without its being noticed."\r\n\r\n"You\'re an extraordinary young woman," her friend, visibly held by her,\r\ndeclared at last. "What a remarkable time to talk of such things!"\r\n\r\n"Well, we won\'t talk, precisely"--Milly got herself together again. "I\r\nonly wanted to make sure of you."\r\n\r\n"Here in the midst of----!" But Kate could only sigh for wonder--almost\r\nvisibly too for pity.\r\n\r\nIt made a moment during which her companion waited on her word; partly\r\nas if from a yearning, shy but deep, to have her case put to her just\r\nas Kate was struck by it; partly as if the hint of pity were already\r\ngiving a sense to her whimsical "shot," with Lord Mark, at Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s first dinner. Exactly this--the handsome girl\'s compassionate\r\nmanner, her friendly descent from her own strength--was what she had\r\nthen foretold. She took Kate up as if positively for the deeper taste\r\nof it. "Here in the midst of what?"\r\n\r\n"Of everything. There\'s nothing you can\'t have. There\'s nothing you\r\ncan\'t do."\r\n\r\n"So Mrs. Lowder tells me."\r\n\r\nIt just kept Kate\'s eyes fixed as possibly for more of that; then,\r\nhowever, without waiting, she went on. "We all adore you."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wonderful--you dear things!" Milly laughed.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s _you."_ And Kate seemed struck with the real interest of it.\r\n"In three weeks!"\r\n\r\nMilly kept it up. "Never were people on such terms! All the more\r\nreason," she added, "that I shouldn\'t needlessly torment you."\r\n\r\n"But me? what becomes of _me?"_ said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Well, you--" Milly thought--"if there\'s anything to bear, you\'ll bear\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But I _won\'t_ bear it!" said Kate Croy.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you will: all the same! You\'ll pity me awfully, but you\'ll\r\nhelp me very much. And I absolutely trust you. So there we are." There\r\nthey were, then, since Kate had so to take it; but there, Milly felt,\r\nshe herself in particular was; for it was just the point at which she\r\nhad wished to arrive. She had wanted to prove to herself that she\r\ndidn\'t horribly blame her friend for any reserve; and what better proof\r\ncould there be than this quite special confidence? If she desired to\r\nshow Kate that she really believed the latter liked her, how could she\r\nshow it more than by asking her for help?\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nWhat it really came to, on the morrow, this first time--the time Kate\r\nwent with her--was that the great man had, a little, to excuse himself;\r\nhad, by a rare accident--for he kept his consulting-hours in general\r\nrigorously free--but ten minutes to give her; ten mere minutes which he\r\nyet placed at her service in a manner that she admired even more than\r\nshe could meet it: so crystal-clean the great empty cup of attention\r\nthat he set between them on the table. He was presently to jump into\r\nhis carriage, but he promptly made the point that he must see her\r\nagain, see her within a day or two; and he named for her at once\r\nanother hour--easing her off beautifully too even then in respect to\r\nher possibly failing of justice to her errand. The minutes affected her\r\nin fact as ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items could\r\nmuster, and they would probably have gone without her doing much more\r\nthan secure another hearing, had it not been for her sense, at the\r\nlast, that she had gained above all an impression. The impression--all\r\nthe sharp growth of the final few moments--was neither more nor less\r\nthan that she might make, of a sudden, in quite another world, another\r\nstraight friend, and a friend who would moreover be, wonderfully, the\r\nmost appointed, the most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection,\r\ninasmuch as he would somehow wear the character scientifically,\r\nponderably, proveably--not just loosely and sociably. Literally,\r\nfurthermore, it wouldn\'t really depend on herself, Sir Luke Strett\'s\r\nfriendship, in the least; perhaps what made her most stammer and pant\r\nwas its thus queerly coming over her that she might find she had\r\ninterested him even beyond her intention, find she was in fact launched\r\nin some current that would lose itself in the sea of science. At the\r\nsame time that she struggled, however, she also surrendered; there was\r\na moment at which she almost dropped the form of stating, of\r\nexplaining, and threw herself, without violence, only with a supreme\r\npointless quaver that had turned, the next instant, to an intensity of\r\ninterrogative stillness, upon his general goodwill. His large, settled\r\nface, though firm, was not, as she had thought at first, hard; he\r\nlooked, in the oddest manner, to her fancy, half like a general and\r\nhalf like a bishop, and she was soon sure that, within some such\r\nhandsome range, what it would show her would be what was good, what was\r\nbest for her. She had established, in other words, in this time-saving\r\nway, a relation with it; and the relation was the special trophy that,\r\nfor the hour, she bore off. It was like an absolute possession, a new\r\nresource altogether, something done up in the softest silk and tucked\r\naway under the arm of memory. She hadn\'t had it when she went in, and\r\nshe had it when she came out; she had it there under her cloak, but\r\ndissimulated, invisibly carried, when smiling, smiling, she again faced\r\nKate Croy. That young lady had of course awaited her in another room,\r\nwhere, as the great man was to absent himself, no one else was in\r\nattendance; and she rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might\r\nhave graced the vestibule of a dentist. "Is it out?" she seemed to ask\r\nas if it had been a question of a tooth; and Milly indeed kept her in\r\nno suspense at all.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a dear. I\'m to come again."\r\n\r\n"But what does he say?"\r\n\r\nMilly was almost gay. "That I\'m not to worry about anything in the\r\nworld, and that if I\'ll be a good girl and do exactly what he tells me,\r\nhe\'ll take care of me for ever and ever."\r\n\r\nKate wondered as if things scarce fitted. "But does he allow then that\r\nyou\'re ill?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he allows, and I don\'t care. I shall know, and\r\nwhatever it is it will be enough. He knows all about me, and I like it.\r\nI don\'t hate it a bit."\r\n\r\nStill, however, Kate stared. "But could he, in so few minutes, ask you\r\nenough----?"\r\n\r\n"He asked me scarcely anything--he doesn\'t need to do anything so\r\nstupid," Milly said. "He can tell. He knows," she repeated; "and when I\r\ngo back--for he\'ll have thought me over a little--it will be all right."\r\n\r\nKate, after a moment, made the best of this. "Then when are we to come?"\r\n\r\nIt just pulled her friend up, for even while they talked--at least it\r\nwas one of the reasons--she stood there suddenly, irrelevantly, in the\r\nlight of her _other_ identity, the identity she would have for Mr.\r\nDensher. This was always, from one instant to another, an incalculable\r\nlight, which, though it might go off faster than it came on,\r\nnecessarily disturbed. It sprang, with a perversity all its own, from\r\nthe fact that, with the lapse of hours and days, the chances themselves\r\nthat made for his being named continued so oddly to fail. There were\r\ntwenty, there were fifty, but none of them turned up. This, in\r\nparticular, was of course not a juncture at which the least of them\r\nwould naturally be present; but it would make, none the less, Milly\r\nsaw, another day practically all stamped with avoidance. She saw in a\r\nquick glimmer, and with it all Kate\'s unconsciousness; and then she\r\nshook off the obsession. But it had lasted long enough to qualify her\r\nresponse. No, she had shown Kate how she trusted her; and that, for\r\nloyalty, would somehow do. "Oh, dear thing, now that the ice is broken\r\nI shan\'t trouble _you_ again."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come alone?"\r\n\r\n"Without a scruple. Only I shall ask you, please, for your absolute\r\ndiscretion still."\r\n\r\nOutside, before the door, on the wide pavement of the great square,\r\nthey had to wait again while their carriage, which Milly had kept,\r\ncompleted a further turn of exercise, engaged in by the coachman for\r\nreasons of his own. The footman was there, and had indicated that he\r\nwas making the circuit; so Kate went on while they stood. "But don\'t\r\nyou ask a good deal, darling, in proportion to what you give?"\r\n\r\nThis pulled Milly up still shorter--so short in fact that she yielded\r\nas soon as she had taken it in. But she continued to smile. "I see.\r\nThen you _can_ tell."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to \'tell,\'" said Kate. "I\'ll be as silent as the tomb if\r\nI can only have the truth from you. All I want is that you shouldn\'t\r\nkeep from me how you find out that you really are."\r\n\r\n"Well then, I won\'t, ever. But you see for yourself," Milly went on,\r\n"how I really am. I\'m satisfied. I\'m happy."\r\n\r\nKate looked at her long. "I believe you like it. The way things turn\r\nout for you----!"\r\n\r\nMilly met her look now without a thought of anything but the spoken.\r\nShe had ceased to be Mr. Densher\'s image; she was all her own memento\r\nand she was none the less fine. Still, still, what had passed was a\r\nfair bargain, and it would do. "Of course I like it. I feel--I can\'t\r\notherwise describe it--as if I had been, on my knees, to the priest.\r\nI\'ve confessed and I\'ve been absolved. It has been lifted off."\r\n\r\nKate\'s eyes never quitted her. "He must have liked _you."_\r\n\r\n"Oh--doctors!" Milly said. "But I hope," she added, "he didn\'t like me\r\ntoo much." Then as if to escape a little from her friend\'s deeper\r\nsounding, or as impatient for the carriage, not yet in sight, her eyes,\r\nturning away, took in the great stale square. As its staleness,\r\nhowever, was but that of London fairly fatigued, the late hot London\r\nwith its dance all danced and its story all told, the air seemed a\r\nthing of blurred pictures and mixed echoes, and an impression met the\r\nsense--an impression that broke, the next moment, through the girl\'s\r\ntightened lips. "Oh, it\'s a beautiful big world, and everyone, yes,\r\neveryone----!" It presently brought her back to Kate, and she hoped she\r\ndidn\'t actually look as much as if she were crying as she must have\r\nlooked to Lord Mark among the portraits at Matcham.\r\n\r\nKate at all events understood. "Everyone wants to be so nice?"\r\n\r\n"So nice," said the grateful Milly.\r\n\r\n"Oh," Kate laughed, "we\'ll pull you through! And won\'t you now bring\r\nMrs. Stringham?"\r\n\r\nBut Milly after an instant was again clear about that. "Not till I\'ve\r\nseen him once more."\r\n\r\nShe was to have found this preference, two days later, abundantly\r\njustified; and yet when, in prompt accordance with what had passed\r\nbetween them, she reappeared before her distinguished friend--that\r\ncharacter having, for him, in the interval, built itself up still\r\nhigher--the first thing he asked her was whether she had been\r\naccompanied. She told him, on this, straightway, everything; completely\r\nfree at present from her first embarrassment, disposed even--as she\r\nfelt she might become--to undue volubility, and conscious moreover of\r\nno alarm from his thus perhaps wishing that she had not come alone. It\r\nwas exactly as if, in the forty-eight hours that had passed, her\r\nacquaintance with him had somehow increased, and his own knowledge in\r\nparticular received mysterious additions. They had been together,\r\nbefore, scarce ten minutes; but the relation, the one the ten minutes\r\nhad so beautifully created, was there to take straight up: and this\r\nnot, on his own part, from mere professional heartiness, mere bedside\r\nmanner, which she would have disliked--much rather from a quiet,\r\npleasant air in him of having positively asked about her, asked here\r\nand there and found out. Of course he couldn\'t in the least have asked,\r\nor have wanted to; there was no source of information to his hand, and\r\nhe had really needed none: he had found out simply by his genius--and\r\nfound out, she meant, literally everything. Now she knew not only that\r\nshe didn\'t dislike this--the state of being found out about; but that,\r\non the contrary, it was truly what she had come for, and that, for the\r\ntime at least, it would give her something firm to stand on. She struck\r\nherself as aware, aware as she had never been, of really not having had\r\nfrom the beginning anything firm. It would be strange for the firmness\r\nto come, after all, from her learning in these agreeable conditions\r\nthat she was in some way doomed; but above all it would prove how\r\nlittle she had hitherto had to hold her up. If she was now to be held\r\nup by the mere process--since that was perhaps on the cards--of being\r\nlet down, this would only testify in turn to her queer little history.\r\n_That_ sense of loosely rattling had been no process at all; and it was\r\nridiculously true that her thus sitting there to see her life put into\r\nthe scales represented her first approach to the taste of orderly\r\nliving. Such was Milly\'s romantic version--that her life, especially by\r\nthe fact of this second interview, _was_ put into the scales; and just\r\nthe best part of the relation established might have been, for that\r\nmatter, that the great grave charming man knew, had known at once, that\r\nit was romantic, and in that measure allowed for it. Her only doubt,\r\nher only fear, was whether he perhaps wouldn\'t even take advantage of\r\nher being a little romantic to treat her as romantic altogether. This\r\ndoubtless was her danger with him; but she should see, and dangers in\r\ngeneral meanwhile dropped and dropped.\r\n\r\nThe very place, at the end of a few minutes, the commodious, "handsome"\r\nroom, far back in the fine old house, soundless from position, somewhat\r\nsallow with years of celebrity, somewhat sombre even at midsummer--the\r\nvery place put on for her a look of custom and use, squared itself\r\nsolidly round her as with promises and certainties. She had come forth\r\nto see the world, and this then was to be the world\'s light, the rich\r\ndusk of a London "back," these the world\'s walls, those the world\'s\r\ncurtains and carpet. She should be intimate with the great bronze clock\r\nand mantel-ornaments, conspicuously presented in gratitude and long\r\nago; she should be as one of the circle of eminent contemporaries,\r\nphotographed, engraved, signatured, and in particular framed and\r\nglazed, who made up the rest of the decoration, and made up as well so\r\nmuch of the human comfort; and while she thought of all the clean\r\ntruths, unfringed, unfingered, that the listening stillness, strained\r\ninto pauses and waits, would again and again, for years, have kept\r\ndistinct, she also wondered what she would eventually decide upon to\r\npresent in gratitude. She would give something better at least than the\r\nbrawny Victorian bronzes. This was precisely an instance of what she\r\nfelt he knew of her before he had done with her: that she was secretly\r\nromancing at that rate, in the midst of so much else that was more\r\nurgent, all over the place. So much for her secrets with him, none of\r\nwhich really required to be phrased. It would have been, for example, a\r\nsecret for her from any one else that without a dear lady she had\r\npicked up just before coming over she wouldn\'t have a decently near\r\nconnection, of any sort, for such an appeal as she was making, to put\r\nforward: no one in the least, as it were, to produce for\r\nrespectability. But _his_ seeing it she didn\'t mind a scrap, and not a\r\nscrap either his knowing how she had left the dear lady in the dark.\r\nShe had come alone, putting her friend off with a fraud: giving a\r\npretext of shops, of a whim, of she didn\'t know what--the amusement of\r\nbeing for once in the streets by herself. The streets by herself were\r\nnew to her--she had always had in them a companion, or a maid; and he\r\nwas never to believe, moreover, that she couldn\'t take full in the face\r\nanything he might have to say. He was softly amused at her account of\r\nher courage; though he yet showed it somehow without soothing her too\r\ngrossly. Still, he did want to know whom she had. Hadn\'t there been a\r\nlady with her on Wednesday?\r\n\r\n"Yes--a different one. Not the one who\'s travelling with me. I\'ve told\r\n_her."_\r\n\r\nDistinctly he was amused, and it added to his air--the greatest charm\r\nof all--of giving her lots of time. "You\'ve told her what?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Milly, "that I visit you in secret."\r\n\r\n"And how many persons will she tell?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s devoted. Not one."\r\n\r\n"Well, if she\'s devoted doesn\'t that make another friend for you?"\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t take much computation, but she nevertheless had to think a\r\nmoment, conscious as she was that he distinctly _would_ want to fill\r\nout his notion of her--even a little, as it were, to warm the air for\r\nher. That, however--and better early than late--he must accept as of no\r\nuse; and she herself felt for an instant quite a competent certainty on\r\nthe subject of any such warming. The air, for Milly Theale, was, from\r\nthe very nature of the case, destined never to rid itself of a\r\nconsiderable chill. This she could tell him with authority, if she\r\ncould tell him nothing else; and she seemed to see now, in short, that\r\nit would importantly simplify. "Yes, it makes another; but they all\r\ntogether wouldn\'t make--well, I don\'t know what to call it but the\r\ndifference. I mean when one is--really alone. I\'ve never seen anything\r\nlike the kindness." She pulled up a minute while he waited--waited\r\nagain as if with his reasons for letting her, for almost making her,\r\ntalk. What she herself wanted was not, for the third time, to cry, as\r\nit were, in public. She _had_ never seen anything like the kindness,\r\nand she wished to do it justice; but she knew what she was about, and\r\njustice was not wronged by her being able presently to stick to her\r\npoint. "Only one\'s situation is what it is. It\'s me it concerns. The\r\nrest is delightful and useless. Nobody can really help. That\'s why I\'m\r\nby myself to-day. I _want_ to be--in spite of Miss Croy, who came with\r\nme last. If you can help, so much the better and also of course if one\r\ncan, a little, one\'s self. Except for that--you and me doing our\r\nbest--I like you to see me just as I am. Yes, I like it--and I don\'t\r\nexaggerate. Shouldn\'t one, at the start, show the worst--so that\r\nanything after that may be better? It wouldn\'t make any real\r\ndifference--it _won\'t_ make any, anything that may happen won\'t--to any\r\none. Therefore I feel myself, this way, with you, just as I am; and--if\r\nyou do in the least care to know--it quite positively bears me up." She\r\nput it as to his caring to know, because his manner seemed to give her\r\nall her chance, and the impression was there for her to take. It was\r\nstrange and deep for her, this impression, and she did, accordingly,\r\ntake it straight home. It showed him--showed him in spite of\r\nhimself--as allowing, somewhere far within, things comparatively\r\nremote, things in fact quite, as she would have said, outside,\r\ndelicately to weigh with him; showed him as interested, on her behalf,\r\nin other questions beside the question of what was the matter with her.\r\nShe accepted such an interest as regular in the highest type of\r\nscientific mind--his _being_ the even highest, magnificently because\r\notherwise, obviously, it wouldn\'t be there; but she could at the same\r\ntime take it as a direct source of light upon herself, even though that\r\nmight present her a little as pretending to equal him. Wanting to know\r\nmore about a patient than how a patient was constructed or deranged\r\ncouldn\'t be, even on the part of the greatest of doctors, anything but\r\nsome form or other of the desire to let the patient down easily. When\r\nthat was the case the reason, in turn, could only be, too manifestly,\r\npity; and when pity held up its tell-tale face like a head on a pike,\r\nin a French revolution, bobbing before a window, what was the inference\r\nbut that the patient was bad? He might say what he would now--she would\r\nalways have seen the head at the window; and in fact from this moment\r\nshe only wanted him to say what he would. He might say it too with the\r\ngreater ease to himself as there wasn\'t one of her divinations that--as\r\nher own--he would in any way put himself out for. Finally, if he was\r\nmaking her talk she _was_ talking; and what it could, at any rate, come\r\nto for him was that she wasn\'t afraid. If he wanted to do the dearest\r\nthing in the world for her he would show her he believed she wasn\'t;\r\nwhich undertaking of hers--not to have misled him--was what she counted\r\nat the moment as her presumptuous little hint to him that she was as\r\ngood as himself. It put forward the bold idea that he could really _be_\r\nmisled; and there actually passed between them for some seconds a sign,\r\na sign of the eyes only, that they knew together where they were. This\r\nmade, in their brown old temple of truth, its momentary flicker; then\r\nwhat followed it was that he had her, all the same, in his pocket; and\r\nthe whole thing wound up, for that consummation, with its kind dim\r\nsmile. Such kindness was wonderful with such dimness; but\r\nbrightness--that even of sharp steel--was of course for the other side\r\nof the business, and it would all come in for her in one way or\r\nanother. "Do you mean," he asked, "that you\'ve no relations at\r\nall?--not a parent, not a sister, not even a cousin nor an aunt?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head as with the easy habit of an interviewed heroine or\r\na freak of nature at a show. "Nobody whatever." But the last thing she\r\nhad come for was to be dreary about it. "I\'m a survivor--a survivor of\r\na general wreck. You see," she added, "how that\'s to be taken into\r\naccount--that everyone else _has_ gone. When I was ten years old there\r\nwere, with my father and my mother, six of us. I\'m all that\'s left. But\r\nthey died," she went on, to be fair all round, "of different things.\r\nStill, there it is. And, as I told you before, I\'m American. Not that I\r\nmean that makes me worse. However, you\'ll probably know what it makes\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he discreetly indulged her; "I know perfectly what it makes you.\r\nIt makes you, to begin with, a capital case."\r\n\r\nShe sighed, though gratefully, as if again before the social scene.\r\n"Ah, there you are!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; there \'we\' aren\'t at all. There I am only--but as much as you\r\nlike. I\'ve no end of American friends: there _they_ are, if you please,\r\nand it\'s a fact that you couldn\'t very well be in a better place than\r\nin their company. It puts you with plenty of others--and that isn\'t\r\npure solitude." Then he pursued: "I\'m sure you\'ve an excellent spirit;\r\nbut don\'t try to bear more things than you need." Which after an\r\ninstant he further explained. "Hard things have come to you in youth,\r\nbut you mustn\'t think life will be for you all hard things. You\'ve the\r\nright to be happy. You must make up your mind to it. You must accept\r\nany form in which happiness may come."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll accept any whatever!" she almost gaily returned. "And it\r\nseems to me, for that matter, that I\'m accepting a new one every day.\r\nNow _this!"_ she smiled.\r\n\r\n"This is very well so far as it goes. You can depend on me," the great\r\nman said, "for unlimited interest. But I\'m only, after all, one element\r\nin fifty. We must gather in plenty of others. Don\'t mind who knows.\r\nKnows, I mean, that you and I are friends."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you do want to see some one!" she broke out. "You want to get at\r\nsome one who cares for me." With which, however, as he simply met this\r\nspontaneity in a manner to show that he had often had it from young\r\npersons of her race, and that he was familiar even with the\r\npossibilities of their familiarity, she felt her freedom rendered vain\r\nby his silence, and she immediately tried to think of the most\r\nreasonable thing she could say. This would be, precisely, on the\r\nsubject of that freedom, which she now quickly spoke of as complete.\r\n"That\'s of course by itself a great boon; so please don\'t think I don\'t\r\nknow it. I can do exactly what I like--anything in all the wide world.\r\nI haven\'t a creature to ask--there\'s not a finger to stop me. I can\r\nshake about till I\'m black and blue. That perhaps isn\'t _all_ joy; but\r\nlots of people, I know, would like to try it." He had appeared about to\r\nput a question, but then had let her go on, which she promptly did, for\r\nshe understood him the next moment as having thus taken it from her\r\nthat her means were as great as might be. She had simply given it to\r\nhim so, and this was all that would ever pass between them on the\r\nodious head. Yet she couldn\'t help also knowing that an important\r\neffect, for his judgment, or at least for his amusement--which was his\r\nfeeling, since, marvellously, he did have feeling--was produced by it.\r\nAll her little pieces had now then fallen together for him like the\r\nmorsels of coloured glass that used to make combinations, under the\r\nhand, in the depths of one of the polygonal peepshows of childhood. "So\r\nthat if it\'s a question of my doing anything under the sun that will\r\nhelp----!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll _do_ anything under the sun? Good." He took that beautifully,\r\never so pleasantly, for what it was worth; but time was needed--ten\r\nminutes or so were needed on the spot--to deal even provisionally, with\r\nthe substantive question. It was convenient, in its degree, that there\r\nwas nothing she wouldn\'t do; but it seemed also highly and agreeably\r\nvague that she should have to do anything. They thus appeared to be\r\ntaking her, together, for the moment, and almost for sociability, as\r\nprepared to proceed to gratuitous extremities; the upshot of which was\r\nin turn, that after much interrogation, auscultation, exploration, much\r\nnoting of his own sequences and neglecting of hers, had duly kept up\r\nthe vagueness, they might have struck themselves, or may at least\r\nstrike us, as coming back from an undeterred but useless voyage to the\r\nnorth pole. Milly was ready, under orders, for the north pole; which\r\nfact was doubtless what made a blinding anticlimax of her friend\'s\r\nactual abstention from orders. "No," she heard him again distinctly\r\nrepeat it, "I don\'t want you for the present to do anything at all;\r\nanything, that is, but obey a small prescription or two that will be\r\nmade clear to you, and let me within a few days come to see you at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nIt was at first heavenly. "Then you\'ll see Mrs. Stringham." But she\r\ndidn\'t mind a bit now.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shan\'t be afraid of Mrs. Stringham." And he said it once more\r\nas she asked once more: "Absolutely not; I \'send\' you nowhere.\r\nEngland\'s all right--anywhere that\'s pleasant, convenient, decent, will\r\nbe all right. You say you can do exactly as you like. Oblige me\r\ntherefore by being so good as to do it. There\'s only one thing: you\r\nought of course, now, as soon as I\'ve seen you again, to get out of\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\nMilly thought. "May I then go back to the continent?"\r\n\r\n"By all means back to the continent. Do go back to the continent."\r\n\r\n"Then how will you keep seeing me? But perhaps," she quickly added,\r\n"you won\'t want to keep seeing me."\r\n\r\nHe had it all ready; he had really everything all ready. "I shall\r\nfollow you up; though if you mean that I don\'t want you to keep seeing\r\n_me_----"\r\n\r\n"Well?" she asked.\r\n\r\nIt was only just here that he struck her the least bit as stumbling.\r\n"Well, see all you can. That\'s what it comes to. Worry about nothing.\r\nYou _have_ at least no worries. It\'s a great, rare chance."\r\n\r\nShe had got up, for she had had from him both that he would send her\r\nsomething and would advise her promptly of the date of his coming to\r\nher, by which she was virtually dismissed. Yet, for herself, one or two\r\nthings kept her. "May I come back to England too?"\r\n\r\n"Rather! Whenever you like. But always, when you do come, immediately\r\nlet me know."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Milly, "it won\'t be a great going to and fro."\r\n\r\n"Then if you\'ll stay with us, so much the better."\r\n\r\nIt touched her, the way he controlled his impatience of her; and the\r\nfact itself affected her as so precious that she yielded to the wish to\r\nget more from it. "So you don\'t think I\'m out of my mind?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that _is,"_ he smiled, "all that\'s the matter."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him longer. "No, that\'s too good. Shall I, at any rate,\r\nsuffer?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit."\r\n\r\n"And yet then live?"\r\n\r\n"My dear young lady," said her distinguished friend, "isn\'t to \'live\'\r\nexactly what I\'m trying to persuade you to take the trouble to do?"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nShe had gone out with these last words so in her ears that when once\r\nshe was well away--back this time in the great square alone--it was as\r\nif some instant application of them had opened out there before her. It\r\nwas positively, this effect, an excitement that carried her on; she\r\nwent forward into space under the sense of an impulse received--an\r\nimpulse simple and direct, easy above all to act upon. She was borne up\r\nfor the hour, and now she knew why she had wanted to come by herself.\r\nNo one in the world could have sufficiently entered into her state; no\r\ntie would have been close enough to enable a companion to walk beside\r\nher without some disparity. She literally felt, in this first flush,\r\nthat her only company must be the human race at large, present all\r\nround her, but inspiringly impersonal, and that her only field must be,\r\nthen and there, the grey immensity of London. Grey immensity had\r\nsomehow of a sudden become her element; grey immensity was what her\r\ndistinguished friend had, for the moment, furnished her world with and\r\nwhat the question of "living," as he put it to her, living by option,\r\nby volition, inevitably took on for its immediate face. She went\r\nstraight before her, without weakness, altogether with strength; and\r\nstill as she went she was more glad to be alone, for nobody--not Kate\r\nCroy, not Susan Shepherd either--would have wished to rush with her as\r\nshe rushed. She had asked him at the last whether, being on foot, she\r\nmight go home so, or elsewhere, and he had replied as if almost amused\r\nagain at her extravagance: "You\'re active, luckily, by nature--it\'s\r\nbeautiful: therefore rejoice in it. _Be_ active, without folly--for\r\nyou\'re not foolish: be as active as you can and as you like." That had\r\nbeen in fact the final push, as well as the touch that most made a\r\nmixture of her consciousness--a strange mixture that tasted at one and\r\nthe same time of what she had lost and what had been given her. It was\r\nwonderful to her, while she took her random course, that these\r\nquantities felt so equal: she had been treated--hadn\'t she?--as if it\r\nwere in her power to live; and yet one wasn\'t treated so--was\r\none?--unless it came up, quite as much, that one might die. The beauty\r\nof the bloom had gone from the small old sense of safety--that was\r\ndistinct: she had left it behind her there forever. But the beauty of\r\nthe idea of a great adventure, a big dim experiment or struggle in\r\nwhich she might, more responsibly than ever before, take a hand, had\r\nbeen offered her instead. It was as if she had had to pluck off her\r\nbreast, to throw away, some friendly ornament, a familiar flower, a\r\nlittle old jewel, that was part of her daily dress; and to take up and\r\nshoulder as a substitute some queer defensive weapon, a musket, a\r\nspear, a battle-axe conducive possibly in a higher degree to a striking\r\nappearance, but demanding all the effort of the military posture. She\r\nfelt this instrument, for that matter, already on her back, so that she\r\nproceeded now in very truth as a soldier on a march--proceeded as if,\r\nfor her initiation, the first charge had been sounded. She passed along\r\nunknown streets, over dusty littery ways, between long rows of fronts\r\nnot enhanced by the August light; she felt good for miles and only\r\nwanted to get lost; there were moments at corners, where she stopped\r\nand chose her direction, in which she quite lived up to his injunction\r\nto rejoice that she was active. It was like a new pleasure to have so\r\nnew a reason; she would affirm, without delay, her option, her\r\nvolition; taking this personal possession of what surrounded her was a\r\nfair affirmation to start with; and she really didn\'t care if she made\r\nit at the cost of alarms for Susie. Susie would wonder in due course\r\n"whatever," as they said at the hotel, had become of her; yet this\r\nwould be nothing either, probably, to wonderments still in store.\r\nWonderments in truth, Milly felt, even now attended her steps: it was\r\nquite as if she saw in people\'s eyes the reflection of her appearance\r\nand pace. She found herself moving at times in regions visibly not\r\nhaunted by odd-looking girls from New York, duskily draped,\r\nsable-plumed, all but incongruously shod and gazing about them with\r\nextravagance; she might, from the curiosity she clearly excited in\r\nbyways, in side-streets peopled with grimy children and costermongers\r\ncarts, which she hoped were slums, literally have had her musket on her\r\nshoulder, have announced herself as freshly on the warpath. But for the\r\nfear of overdoing this character she would here and there have begun\r\nconversation, have asked her way; in spite of the fact that, as that\r\nwould help the requirements of adventure, her way was exactly what she\r\nwanted not to know. The difficulty was that she at last accidentally\r\nfound it; she had come out, she presently saw, at the Regent\'s Park,\r\nround which, on two or three occasions with Kate Croy, her public\r\nchariot had solemnly rolled. But she went into it further now; this was\r\nthe real thing; the real thing was to be quite away from the pompous\r\nroads, well within the centre and on the stretches of shabby grass.\r\nHere were benches and smutty sheep; here were idle lads at games of\r\nball, with their cries mild in the thick air; here were wanderers,\r\nanxious and tired like herself; here doubtless were hundreds of others\r\njust in the same box. Their box, their great common anxiety, what was\r\nit, in this grim breathing-space, but the practical question of life?\r\nThey could live if they would; that is, like herself, they had been\r\ntold so; she saw them all about her, on seats, digesting the\r\ninformation, feeling it altered, assimilated, recognising it again as\r\nsomething, in a slightly different shape, familiar enough, the blessed\r\nold truth that they would live if they could. All she thus shared with\r\nthem made her wish to sit in their company; which she so far did that\r\nshe looked for a bench that was empty, eschewing a still emptier chair\r\nthat she saw hard by and for which she would have paid, with\r\nsuperiority, a fee.\r\n\r\nThe last scrap of superiority had soon enough left her, if only because\r\nshe before long knew herself for more tired than she had proposed. This\r\nand the charm, after a fashion, of the situation in itself made her\r\nlinger and rest; there was a sort of spell in the sense that nobody in\r\nthe world knew where she was. It was the first time in her life that\r\nthis had happened; somebody, everybody appeared to have known before,\r\nat every instant of it, where she was; so that she was now suddenly\r\nable to put it to herself that that hadn\'t been a life. This present\r\nkind of thing therefore might be--which was where precisely her\r\ndistinguished friend seemed to be wishing her to come out. He wished\r\nher also, it was true, not to make, as she was perhaps doing now, too\r\nmuch of her isolation; at the same time however as he clearly desired\r\nto deny her no decent source of interest. He was interested--she\r\narrived at that--in her appealing to as many sources as possible; and\r\nit fairly filtered into her, as she sat and sat, that he was\r\nessentially propping her up. Had she been doing it herself she would\r\nhave called it bolstering--the bolstering that was simply for the weak;\r\nand she thought and thought as she put together the proofs that it was\r\nas one of the weak he was treating her. It was of course as one of the\r\nweak that she had gone to him--but, oh, with how sneaking a hope that\r\nhe might pronounce her, as to all indispensables, a veritable young\r\nlioness! What indeed she was really confronted with was the\r\nconsciousness that he had not, after all, pronounced her anything: she\r\nnursed herself into the sense that he had beautifully got out of it.\r\nDid he think, however, she wondered, that he could keep out of it to\r\nthe end?--though, as she weighed the question, she yet felt it a little\r\nunjust. Milly weighed, in this extraordinary hour, questions numerous\r\nand strange; but she had, happily, before she moved, worked round to a\r\nsimplification. Stranger than anything, for instance, was the effect of\r\nits rolling over her that, when one considered it, he might perhaps\r\nhave "got out" by one door but to come in with a beautiful, beneficent\r\ndishonesty by another. It kept her more intensely motionless there that\r\nwhat he might fundamentally be "up to" was some disguised intention of\r\nstanding by her as a friend. Wasn\'t that what women always said they\r\nwanted to do when they deprecated the addresses of gentlemen they\r\ncouldn\'t more intimately go on with? It was what they, no doubt,\r\nsincerely fancied they could make of men of whom they couldn\'t make\r\nhusbands. And she didn\'t even reason that it was, by a similar law, the\r\nexpedient of doctors in general for the invalids of whom they couldn\'t\r\nmake patients: she was somehow so sufficiently aware that _her_ doctor\r\nwas--however fatuous it might sound--exceptionally moved. This was the\r\ndamning little fact--if she could talk of damnation: that she could\r\nbelieve herself to have caught him in the act of irrelevantly liking\r\nher. She hadn\'t gone to him to be liked, she had gone to him to be\r\njudged; and he was quite a great enough man to be in the habit, as a\r\nrule, of observing the difference. She could like _him,_ as she\r\ndistinctly did--that was another matter; all the more that her doing so\r\nwas now, so obviously for herself, compatible with judgment. Yet it\r\nwould have been all portentously mixed had not, as we say, a final,\r\nmerciful wave, chilling rather, but washing clear, come to her\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIt came, of a sudden, when all other thought was spent. She had been\r\nasking herself why, if her case was grave--and she knew what she meant\r\nby that--he should have talked to her at all about what she might with\r\nfutility "do"; or why on the other hand, if it were light, he should\r\nattach an importance to the office of friendship. She had him, with her\r\nlittle lonely acuteness--as acuteness went during the dog-days in the\r\nRegent\'s Park--in a cleft stick: she either mattered, and then she was\r\nill; or she didn\'t matter, and then she was well enough. Now he was\r\n"acting," as they said at home, as if she did matter--until he should\r\nprove the contrary. It was too evident that a person at his high\r\npressure must keep his inconsistencies, which were probably his highest\r\namusements, only for the very greatest occasions. Her prevision, in\r\nfine, of just where she should catch him furnished the light of that\r\njudgment in which we describe her as daring to indulge. And the\r\njudgment it was that made her sensation simple. He _had_ distinguished\r\nher--that was the chill. He hadn\'t known--how could he?--that she was\r\ndevilishly subtle, subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected, the\r\nsuspicious, the condemned. He in fact confessed to it, in his way, as\r\nto an interest in her combinations, her funny race, her funny losses,\r\nher funny gains, her funny freedom, and, no doubt, above all, her funny\r\nmanners--funny, like those of Americans at their best, without being\r\nvulgar, legitimating amiability and helping to pass it off. In his\r\nappreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for her the\r\ncompassion he so signally permitted himself to waste; but its operation\r\nfor herself was as directly divesting, denuding, exposing. It reduced\r\nher to her ultimate state, which was that of a poor girl with her rent\r\nto pay for example--staring before her in a great city. Milly had her\r\nrent to pay, her rent for her future; everything else but how to meet\r\nit fell away from her in pieces, in tatters. This was the sensation the\r\ngreat man had doubtless not purposed. Well, she must go home, like the\r\npoor girl, and see. There might after all be ways; the poor girl too\r\nwould be thinking. It came back for that matter perhaps to views\r\nalready presented. She looked about her again, on her feet, at her\r\nscattered, melancholy comrades--some of them so melancholy as to be\r\ndown on their stomachs in the grass, turned away, ignoring, burrowing;\r\nshe saw once more, with them, those two faces of the question between\r\nwhich there was so little to choose for inspiration. It was perhaps\r\nsuperficially more striking that one could live if one would; but it\r\nwas more appealing, insinuating, irresistible, in short, that one would\r\nlive if one could.\r\n\r\nShe found after this, for the day or two, more amusement than she had\r\nventured to count on in the fact, if it were not a mere fancy, of\r\ndeceiving Susie; and she presently felt that what made the difference\r\nwas the mere fancy--as this _was_ one--of a countermove to her great\r\nman. His taking on himself--should he do so--to get at her companion\r\nmade her suddenly, she held, irresponsible, made any notion of her own\r\nall right for her; though indeed at the very moment she invited herself\r\nto enjoy this impunity she became aware of new matter for surprise, or\r\nat least for speculation. Her idea would rather have been that Mrs.\r\nStringham would have looked at her hard--her sketch of the grounds of\r\nher long, independent excursion showing, she could feel, as almost\r\ncynically superficial. Yet the dear woman so failed, in the event, to\r\navail herself of any right of criticism that it was sensibly tempting,\r\nfor an hour, to wonder if Kate Croy had been playing perfectly fair.\r\nHadn\'t she possibly, from motives of the highest benevolence,\r\npromptings of the finest anxiety, just given poor Susie what she would\r\nhave called the straight tip? It must immediately be mentioned,\r\nhowever, that, quite apart from a remembrance of the distinctness of\r\nKate\'s promise, Milly, the next thing, found her explanation in a truth\r\nthat had the merit of being general. If Susie, at this crisis,\r\nsuspiciously spared her, it was really that Susie was always\r\nsuspiciously sparing her--yet occasionally, too, with portentous and\r\nexceptional mercies. The girl was conscious of how she dropped at times\r\ninto inscrutable, impenetrable deferences--attitudes that, though\r\nwithout at all intending it, made a difference for familiarity, for the\r\nease of intimacy. It was as if she recalled herself to manners, to the\r\nlaw of court-etiquette--which last note above all helped our young\r\nwoman to a just appreciation. It was definite for her, even if not\r\nquite solid, that to treat her as a princess was a positive need of her\r\ncompanion\'s mind; wherefore she couldn\'t help it if this lady had her\r\ntranscendent view of the way the class in question were treated. Susan\r\nhad read history, had read Gibbon and Froude and Saint-Simon; she had\r\nhigh-lights as to the special allowances made for the class, and, since\r\nshe saw them, when young, as effete and overtutored, inevitably ironic\r\nand infinitely refined, one must take it for amusing if she inclined to\r\nan indulgence verily Byzantine. If one _could_ only be\r\nByzantine!--wasn\'t _that_ what she insidiously led one on to sigh?\r\nMilly tried to oblige her--for it really placed Susan herself so\r\nhandsomely to be Byzantine now. The great ladies of that race--it would\r\nbe somewhere in Gibbon--weren\'t, apparently, questioned about their\r\nmysteries. But oh, poor Milly and hers! Susan at all events proved\r\nscarce more inquisitive than if she had been a mosaic at Ravenna. Susan\r\nwas a porcelain monument to the odd moral that consideration might,\r\nlike cynicism, have abysses. Besides, the Puritan finally\r\ndisencumbered----! What starved generations wasn\'t Mrs. Stringham, in\r\nfancy, going to make up for?\r\n\r\nKate Croy came straight to the hotel--came that evening shortly before\r\ndinner; specifically and publicly moreover, in a hansom that, driven\r\napparently very fast, pulled up beneath their windows almost with the\r\nclatter of an accident, a "smash." Milly, alone, as happened, in the\r\ngreat garnished void of their sitting-room, where, a little, really,\r\nlike a caged Byzantine, she had been pacing through the queer,\r\nlong-drawn, almost sinister delay of night, an effect she yet\r\nliked--Milly, at the sound, one of the French windows standing open,\r\npassed out to the balcony that overhung, with pretensions, the general\r\nentrance, and so was in time for the look that Kate, alighting, paying\r\nher cabman, happened to send up to the front. The visitor moreover had\r\na shilling back to wait for, during which Milly, from the balcony,\r\nlooked down at her, and a mute exchange, but with smiles and nods, took\r\nplace between them on what had occurred in the morning. It was what\r\nKate had called for, and the tone was thus, almost by accident,\r\ndetermined for Milly before her friend came up. What was also, however,\r\ndetermined for her was, again, yet irrepressibly again, that the image\r\npresented to her, the splendid young woman who looked so particularly\r\nhandsome in impatience, with the fine freedom of her signal, was the\r\npeculiar property of somebody else\'s vision, that this fine freedom in\r\nshort was the fine freedom she showed Mr. Densher. Just so was how she\r\nlooked to him, and just so was how Milly was held by her--held as by\r\nthe strange sense of seeing through that distant person\'s eyes. It\r\nlasted, as usual, the strange sense, but fifty seconds; yet in so\r\nlasting it produced an effect. It produced in fact more than one, and\r\nwe take them in their order. The first was that it struck our young\r\nwoman as absurd to say that a girl\'s looking so to a man could possibly\r\nbe without connections; and the second was that by the time Kate had\r\ngot into the room Milly was in mental possession of the main connection\r\nit must have for herself.\r\n\r\nShe produced this commodity on the spot--produced it, that is, in\r\nstraight response to Kate\'s frank "Well, what?" The inquiry bore of\r\ncourse, with Kate\'s eagerness, on the issue of the morning\'s scene, the\r\ngreat man\'s latest wisdom, and it doubtless affected Milly a little as\r\nthe cheerful demand for news is apt to affect troubled spirits when\r\nnews is not, in one of the neater forms, prepared for delivery. She\r\ncouldn\'t have said what it was exactly that, on the instant, determined\r\nher; the nearest description of it would perhaps have been as the more\r\nvivid impression of all her friend took for granted. The contrast\r\nbetween this free quantity and the maze of possibilities through which,\r\nfor hours, she had herself been picking her way, put on, in short, for\r\nthe moment, a grossness that even friendly forms scarce lightened: it\r\nhelped forward in fact the revelation to herself that she absolutely\r\nhad nothing to tell. Besides which, certainly, there was something\r\nelse--an influence, at the particular juncture, still more obscure.\r\nKate had lost, on the way upstairs, the look--_the_ look--that made her\r\nyoung hostess so subtly think and one of the signs of which was that\r\nshe never kept it for many moments at once; yet she stood there, none\r\nthe less, so in her bloom and in her strength, so completely again the\r\n"handsome girl" beyond all others, the "handsome girl" for whom Milly\r\nhad at first gratefully taken her, that to meet her now with the note\r\nof the plaintive would amount somehow to a surrender, to a confession.\r\n_She_ would never in her life be ill; the greatest doctor would keep\r\nher, at the worst, the fewest minutes; and it was as if she had asked\r\njust _with_ all this practical impeccability for all that was most\r\nmortal in her friend. These things, for Milly, inwardly danced their\r\ndance; but the vibration produced and the dust kicked up had lasted\r\nless than our account of them. Almost before she knew it she was\r\nanswering, and answering, beautifully, with no consciousness of fraud,\r\nonly as with a sudden flare of the famous "will-power" she had heard\r\nabout, read about, and which was what her medical adviser had mainly\r\nthrown her back on. "Oh, it\'s all right. He\'s lovely."\r\n\r\nKate was splendid, and it would have been clear for Milly now, had the\r\nfurther presumption been needed, that she had said no word to Mrs.\r\nStringham. "You mean you\'ve been absurd?"\r\n\r\n"Absurd." It was a simple word to say, but the consequence of it, for\r\nour young woman, was that she felt it, as soon as spoken, to have done\r\nsomething for her safety.\r\n\r\nAnd Kate really hung on her lips. "There\'s nothing at all the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing to worry about. I shall take a little watching, but I shan\'t\r\nhave to do anything dreadful, or even, in the least, inconvenient. I\r\ncan do in fact as I like." It was wonderful for Milly how just to put\r\nit so made all its pieces fall at present quite properly into places.\r\n\r\nYet even before the full effect came Kate had seized, kissed, blessed\r\nher. "My love, you\'re too sweet! It\'s too dear! But it\'s as I was\r\nsure." Then she grasped the full beauty. "You can do as you like?"\r\n\r\n"Quite. Isn\'t it charming?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, but catch you," Kate triumphed with gaiety, _"not_ doing----! And\r\nwhat _shall_ you do?"\r\n\r\n"For the moment simply enjoy it. Enjoy"--Milly was completely\r\nluminous--"having got out of my scrape."\r\n\r\n"Learning, you mean, so easily, that you _are_ well."\r\n\r\nIt was as if Kate had but too conveniently put the words into her\r\nmouth. "Learning, I mean, so easily, that I _am_ well."\r\n\r\n"Only, no one\'s of course well enough to stay in London now. He can\'t,"\r\nKate went on, "want this of you."\r\n\r\n"Mercy, no--I\'m to knock about. I\'m to go to places."\r\n\r\n"But not beastly \'climates\'--Engadines, Rivieras, boredoms?"\r\n\r\n"No; just, as I say, where I prefer. I\'m to go in for pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the duck!"--Kate, with her own shades of familiarity, abounded.\r\n"But what kind of pleasure?"\r\n\r\n"The highest," Milly smiled.\r\n\r\nHer friend met it as nobly. "Which is the highest?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s just our chance to find out. You must help me."\r\n\r\n"What have I wanted to do but help you," Kate asked, "from the moment I\r\nfirst laid eyes on you?" Yet with this too Kate had her wonder. "I like\r\nyour talking, though, about that. What help, with your luck all round,\r\ndo you want?"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nMilly indeed at last couldn\'t say; so that she had really for the time\r\nbrought it along to the point so oddly marked for her by her visitor\'s\r\narrival, the truth that she was enviably strong. She carried this out,\r\nfrom that evening, for each hour still left her, and the more easily\r\nperhaps that the hours were now narrowly numbered. All she actually\r\nwaited for was Sir Luke Strett\'s promised visit; as to her proceeding\r\non which, however, her mind was quite made up. Since he wanted to get\r\nat Susie he should have the freest access, and then perhaps he would\r\nsee how he liked it. What was between _them_ they might settle as\r\nbetween them, and any pressure it should lift from her own spirit they\r\nwere at liberty to convert to their use. If the dear man wished to fire\r\nSusan Shepherd with a still higher ideal, he would only after all, at\r\nthe worst, have Susan on his hands. If devotion, in a word, was what it\r\nwould come up for the interested pair to organise, she was herself\r\nready to consume it as the dressed and served dish. He had talked to\r\nher of her "appetite" her account of which, she felt, must have been\r\nvague. But for devotion, she could now see, this appetite would be of\r\nthe best. Gross, greedy, ravenous--these were doubtless the proper\r\nnames for her: she was at all events resigned in advance to the\r\nmachinations of sympathy. The day that followed her lonely excursion\r\nwas to be the last but two or three of their stay in London; and the\r\nevening of that day practically ranked for them as, in the matter of\r\noutside relations, the last of all. People were by this time quite\r\nscattered, and many of those who had so liberally manifested in calls,\r\nin cards, in evident sincerity about visits, later on, over the land,\r\nhad positively passed in music out of sight; whether as members, these\r\nlatter, more especially, of Mrs. Lowder\'s immediate circle or as\r\nmembers of Lord Mark\'s--our friends being by this time able to make the\r\ndistinction. The general pitch had thus, decidedly, dropped, and the\r\noccasions still to be dealt with were special and few. One of these,\r\nfor Milly, announced itself as the doctor\'s call already mentioned, as\r\nto which she had now had a note from him: the single other, of\r\nimportance, was their appointed leave-taking--for the shortest\r\nseparation--in respect to Mrs. Lowder and Kate. The aunt and the niece\r\nwere to dine with them alone, intimately and easily--as easily as\r\nshould be consistent with the question of their afterwards going on\r\ntogether to some absurdly belated party, at which they had had it from\r\nAunt Maud that they would do well to show. Sir Luke was to make his\r\nappearance on the morrow of this, and in respect to that complication\r\nMilly had already her plan.\r\n\r\nThe night was, at all events, hot and stale, and it was late enough by\r\nthe time the four ladies had been gathered in, for their small session,\r\nat the hotel, where the windows were still open to the high balconies\r\nand the flames of the candles, behind the pink shades--disposed as for\r\nthe vigil of watchers--were motionless in the air in which the season\r\nlay dead. What was presently settled among them was that Milly, who\r\nbetrayed on this occasion a preference more marked than usual, should\r\nnot hold herself obliged to climb that evening the social stair,\r\nhowever it might stretch to meet her, and that, Mrs. Lowder and Mrs.\r\nStringham facing the ordeal together, Kate Croy should remain with her\r\nand await their return. It was a pleasure to Milly, ever, to send Susan\r\nShepherd forth; she saw her go with complacency, liked, as it were, to\r\nput people off with her, and noted with satisfaction, when she so moved\r\nto the carriage, the further denudation--a markedly ebbing tide--of her\r\nlittle benevolent back. If it wasn\'t quite Aunt Maud\'s ideal, moreover,\r\nto take out the new American girl\'s funny friend instead of the new\r\nAmerican girl herself, nothing could better indicate the range of that\r\nlady\'s merit than the spirit in which--as at the present hour for\r\ninstance--she made the best of the minor advantage. And she did this\r\nwith a broad, cheerful absence of illusion; she did it--confessing even\r\nas much to poor Susie--because, frankly, she _was_ good-natured. When\r\nMrs. Stringham observed that her own light was too abjectly borrowed\r\nand that it was as a link alone, fortunately not missing, that she was\r\nvalued, Aunt Maud concurred to the extent of the remark: "Well, my\r\ndear, you\'re better than nothing." To-night, furthermore, it came up\r\nfor Milly that Aunt Maud had something particular in mind. Mrs.\r\nStringham, before adjourning with her, had gone off for some shawl or\r\nother accessory, and Kate, as if a little impatient for their\r\nwithdrawal, had wandered out to the balcony, where she hovered, for the\r\ntime, unseen, though with scarce more to look at than the dim London\r\nstars and the cruder glow, up the street, on a corner, of a small\r\npublic-house, in front of which a fagged cab-horse was thrown into\r\nrelief. Mrs. Lowder made use of the moment: Milly felt as soon as she\r\nhad spoken that what she was doing was somehow for use.\r\n\r\n"Dear Susan tells me that you saw, in America, Mr. Densher--whom I\'ve\r\nnever till now, as you may have noticed, asked you about. But do you\r\nmind at last, in connection with him, doing something for me?" She had\r\nlowered her fine voice to a depth, though speaking with all her rich\r\nglibness; and Milly, after a small sharpness of surprise, was already\r\nguessing the sense of her appeal. "Will you name him, in any way you\r\nlike, to _her"_--and Aunt Maud gave a nod at the window; "so that you\r\nmay perhaps find out whether he\'s back?"\r\n\r\nEver so many things, for Milly, fell into line at this; it was a\r\nwonder, she afterwards thought, that she could be conscious of so many\r\nat once. She smiled hard, however, for them all. "But I don\'t know that\r\nit\'s important to me to \'find out.\'" The array of things was further\r\nswollen, however, even as she said this, by its striking her as too\r\nmuch to say. She therefore tried as quickly to say less. "Except you\r\nmean, of course, that it\'s important to _you."_ She fancied Aunt Maud\r\nwas looking at her almost as hard as she was herself smiling, and that\r\ngave her another impulse. "You know I never _have_ yet named him to\r\nher; so that if I should break out now----"\r\n\r\n"Well?"--Mrs. Lowder waited.\r\n\r\n"Why, she may wonder what I\'ve been making a mystery of. She hasn\'t\r\nmentioned him, you know," Milly went on, "herself."\r\n\r\n"No"--her friend a little heavily weighed it--"she wouldn\'t. So it\'s\r\nshe, you see then, who has made the mystery."\r\n\r\nYes, Milly but wanted to see; only there was so much. "There has been\r\nof course no particular reason." Yet that indeed was neither here nor\r\nthere. "Do you think," she asked, "he is back?"\r\n\r\n"It will be about his time, I gather, and rather a comfort to me\r\ndefinitely to know."\r\n\r\n"Then can\'t you ask her yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, we never speak of him!"\r\n\r\nIt helped Milly for the moment to the convenience of a puzzled pause.\r\n"Do you mean he\'s an acquaintance of whom you disapprove for her?"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud, as well, just hung fire. "I disapprove of _her_ for the poor\r\nyoung man. She doesn\'t care for him."\r\n\r\n"And _he_ cares so much----?"\r\n\r\n"Too much, too much. And my fear is," said Mrs. Lowder, "that he\r\nprivately besets her. She keeps it to herself, but I don\'t want her\r\nworried. Neither, in truth," she both generously and confidentially\r\nconcluded, "do I want _him."_\r\n\r\nMilly showed all her own effort to meet the case. "But what can _I_ do?"\r\n\r\n"You can find out where they are. If I myself try," Mrs. Lowder\r\nexplained, "I shall appear to treat them as if I supposed them\r\ndeceiving me."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t. You don\'t," Milly mused for her, "suppose them\r\ndeceiving you."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Aunt Maud, whose fine onyx eyes failed to blink, even\r\nthough Milly\'s questions might have been taken as drawing her rather\r\nfurther than she had originally meant to go--"well, Kate is thoroughly\r\naware of my views for her, and that I take her being with me, at\r\npresent, in the way she is with me, if you know what I mean, as a loyal\r\nassent to them. Therefore as my views don\'t happen to provide a place,\r\nat all, for Mr. Densher, much, in a manner, as I like him"--therefore,\r\ntherefore in short she had been prompted to this step, though she\r\ncompleted her sense, but sketchily, with the rattle of her large fan.\r\n\r\nIt assisted them perhaps, however, for the moment, that Milly was able\r\nto pick out of her sense what might serve as the clearest part of it.\r\n"You do like him then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nMilly hesitated, for the question was somehow as the sudden point of\r\nsomething sharp on a nerve that winced. She just caught her breath, but\r\nshe had ground for joy afterwards, she felt, in not really having\r\nfailed to choose with quickness sufficient, out of fifteen possible\r\nanswers, the one that would best serve her. She was then almost proud,\r\nas well, that she had cheerfully smiled. "I did--three times--in New\r\nYork." So came and went for her, in these simple words, the speech that\r\nwas to figure for her, later on, that night, as the one she had ever\r\nuttered that cost her most. She was to lie awake, at all events, half\r\nthe night, for the gladness of not having taken any line so really\r\ninferior as the denial of a happy impression.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Lowder also, moreover, her simple words were the right ones;\r\nthey were at any rate, that lady\'s laugh showed, in the natural note of\r\nthe racy. "You dear American thing! But people may be very good, and\r\nyet not good for what one wants."\r\n\r\n"Yes," the girl assented, "even I suppose when what one wants is\r\nsomething very good."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my child, it would take too long just now to tell you all _I_\r\nwant! I want everything at once and together--and ever so much for you\r\ntoo, you know. But you\'ve seen us," Aunt Maud continued; "you\'ll have\r\nmade out."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Milly, "I _don\'t_ make out"; for again--it came that way in\r\nrushes--she felt an obscurity in things. "Why, if our friend here\r\ndoesn\'t like him----"\r\n\r\n"Should I conceive her interested in keeping things from me?" Mrs.\r\nLowder did justice to the question. "My dear, how can you ask? Put\r\nyourself in her place. She meets me, but on _her_ terms. Proud young\r\nwomen are proud young women. And proud old ones are--well, what _I_ am.\r\nFond of you as we both are, you can help us."\r\n\r\nMilly tried to be inspired. "Does it come back then to my asking her\r\nstraight?"\r\n\r\nAt this, however, finally, Aunt Maud threw her up. "Oh, if you\'ve so\r\nmany reasons not----!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not so many," Milly smiled "but I\'ve one. If I break out so\r\nsuddenly as knowing him, what will she make of my not having spoken\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lowder looked blank at it. "Why should you care what she makes?\r\nYou may have only been decently discreet."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I _have_ been," the girl made haste to say.\r\n\r\n"Besides," her friend went on, "I suggested to you, through Susan, your\r\nline."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that reason\'s a reason for _me."_\r\n\r\n"And for _me,"_ Mrs. Lowder insisted. "She\'s not therefore so stupid as\r\nnot to do justice to grounds so marked. You can tell her perfectly that\r\nI had asked you to say nothing."\r\n\r\n"And may I tell her that you\'ve asked me now to speak?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lowder might well have thought, yet, oddly, this pulled her up.\r\n"You can\'t do it without----?"\r\n\r\nMilly was almost ashamed to be raising so many difficulties. "I\'ll do\r\nwhat I can if you\'ll kindly tell me one thing more." She faltered a\r\nlittle--it was so prying; but she brought it out. "Will he have been\r\nwriting to her?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s exactly, my dear, what I should like to know." Mrs. Lowder was at\r\nlast impatient. "Push in for yourself, and I dare say she\'ll tell you."\r\n\r\nEven now, all the same, Milly had not quite fallen back. "It will be\r\npushing in," she continued to smile, "for _you"_ She allowed her\r\ncompanion, however, no time to take this up. "The point will be that if\r\nhe _has_ been writing she may have answered."\r\n\r\n"But what point, you subtle thing, is that?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t subtle, it seems to me, but quite simple," Milly said, "that\r\nif she has answered she has very possibly spoken of me."\r\n\r\n"Very certainly indeed. But what difference will it make?"\r\n\r\nThe girl had a moment, at this, of thinking it natural that her\r\ninterlocutress herself should so fail of subtlety. "It will make the\r\ndifference that he will have written to her in answer that he knows me.\r\nAnd that, in turn," our young woman explained, "will give an oddity to\r\nmy own silence."\r\n\r\n"How so, if she\'s perfectly aware of having given you no opening? The\r\nonly oddity," Aunt Maud lucidly professed, "is for yourself. It\'s in\r\n_her_ not having spoken."\r\n\r\n"Ah, there we are!" said Milly.\r\n\r\nAnd she had uttered it, evidently, in a tone that struck her friend.\r\n"Then it _has_ troubled you?"\r\n\r\nBut ah, the inquiry had only to be made to bring the rare colour with\r\nfine inconsequence, to her face. "Not, really, the least little bit!"\r\nAnd, quickly feeling the need to abound in this sense, she was on the\r\npoint, to cut short, of declaring that she cared, after all, no scrap\r\nhow much she obliged. Only she felt at this instant too the\r\nintervention of still other things. Mrs. Lowder was, in the first\r\nplace, already beforehand, already affected as by the sudden vision of\r\nher having herself pushed too far. Milly could never judge from her\r\nface of her uppermost motive--it was so little, in its hard, smooth\r\nsheen, that kind of human countenance. She looked hard when she spoke\r\nfair; the only thing was that when she spoke hard she likewise didn\'t\r\nlook soft. Something, none the less, had arisen in her now--a full\r\nappreciable tide, entering by the rupture of some bar. She announced\r\nthat if what she had asked was to prove in the least a bore her young\r\nfriend was not to dream of it; making her young friend at the same\r\ntime, by the change in her tone, dream on the spot more profusely. She\r\nspoke with a belated light, Milly could apprehend--she could always\r\napprehend--from pity; and the result of that perception, for the girl,\r\nwas singular: it proved to her as quickly that Kate, keeping her\r\nsecret, had been straight with her. From Kate distinctly then, as to\r\nwhy she was to be pitied, Aunt Maud knew nothing, and was thereby\r\nsimply putting in evidence the fine side of her own character. This\r\nfine side was that she could almost at any hour, by a kindled\r\npreference or a diverted energy, glow for another interest than her\r\nown. She exclaimed as well, at this moment, that Milly must have been\r\nthinking, round the case, much more than she had supposed; and this\r\nremark could, at once, affect the girl as sharply as any other form of\r\nthe charge of weakness. It was what everyone, if she didn\'t look out,\r\nwould soon be saying--"There\'s something the matter with you!" What one\r\nwas therefore one\'s self concerned immediately to establish was that\r\nthere was nothing at all. "I shall like to help you; I shall like, so\r\nfar as that goes, to help Kate herself," she made such haste as she\r\ncould to declare; her eyes wandering meanwhile across the width of the\r\nroom to that dusk of the balcony in which their companion perhaps a\r\nlittle unaccountably lingered. She suggested hereby her impatience to\r\nbegin; she almost overtly wondered at the length of the opportunity\r\nthis friend was giving them--referring it, however, so far as words\r\nwent, to the other friend, breaking off with an amused: "How\r\ntremendously Susie must be beautifying!"\r\n\r\nIt only marked Aunt Maud, none the less, as too preoccupied for her\r\nallusion. The onyx eyes were fixed upon her with a polished pressure\r\nthat must signify some enriched benevolence. "Let it go, my dear. We\r\nshall, after all, soon enough see."\r\n\r\n"If he _has_ come back we shall certainly see," Milly after a moment\r\nreplied; "for he\'ll probably feel that he can\'t quite civilly not come\r\nto see me. Then _there,"_ she remarked, "we shall be. It wouldn\'t then,\r\nyou see, come through Kate at all--it would come through him. Except,"\r\nshe wound up with a smile, "that he won\'t find me."\r\n\r\nShe had the most extraordinary sense of interesting her interlocutress,\r\nin spite of herself, more than she wanted; it was as if her doom so\r\nfloated her on that she couldn\'t stop--by very much the same trick it\r\nhad played her with her doctor. "Shall you run away from him?"\r\n\r\nShe neglected the question, wanting only now to get off. "Then," she\r\nwent on, "you\'ll deal with Kate directly."\r\n\r\n"Shall you run away from _her?"_ Mrs. Lowder profoundly inquired, while\r\nthey became aware of Susie\'s return through the room, opening out\r\nbehind them, in which they had dined.\r\n\r\nThis affected Milly as giving her but an instant; and suddenly, with\r\nit, everything she felt in the connection rose to her lips in a\r\nquestion that, even as she put it, she knew she was failing to keep\r\ncolourless. "Is it your own belief that he _is_ with her?"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud took it in--took in, that is, everything of the tone that she\r\njust wanted her not to; and the result for some seconds, was but to\r\nmake their eyes meet in silence. Mrs. Stringham had rejoined them and\r\nwas asking if Kate had gone--an inquiry at once answered by this young\r\nlady\'s reappearance. They saw her again in the open window, where,\r\nlooking at them, she had paused--producing thus, on Aunt Maud\'s part,\r\nalmost too impressive a "Hush!" Mrs. Lowder indeed, without loss of\r\ntime, smothered any danger in a sweeping retreat with Susie; but\r\nMilly\'s words to her, just uttered, about dealing with her niece\r\ndirectly, struck our young woman as already recoiling on herself.\r\nDirectness, however evaded, would be, fully, for _her;_ nothing in fact\r\nwould ever have been for her so direct as the evasion. Kate had\r\nremained in the window, very handsome and upright, the outer dark\r\nframing in a highly favourable way her summery simplicities and\r\nlightnesses of dress. Milly had, given the relation of space, no real\r\nfear she had heard their talk; only she hovered there as with conscious\r\neyes and some added advantage. Then indeed, with small delay, her\r\nfriend sufficiently saw. The conscious eyes, the added advantage were\r\nbut those she had now always at command--those proper to the person\r\nMilly knew as known to Merton Densher. It was for several seconds again\r\nas if the _total_ of her identity had been that of the person known to\r\nhim--a determination having for result another sharpness of its own.\r\nKate had positively but to be there just as she was to tell her he had\r\ncome back. It seemed to pass between them, in fine, without a word,\r\nthat he was in London, that he was perhaps only round the corner; and\r\nsurely therefore no dealing of Milly\'s with her would yet have been so\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless because this queer form of directness had in itself,\r\nfor the hour, seemed so sufficient that Milly was afterwards aware of\r\nhaving really, all the while--during the strange, indescribable session\r\nbefore the return of their companions--done nothing to intensify it. If\r\nshe was most aware only afterwards, under the long, discurtained ordeal\r\nof the morrow\'s dawn, that was because she had really, till their\r\nevening\'s end came, ceased, after a little, to miss anything from their\r\nostensible comfort. What was behind showed but in gleams and glimpses;\r\nwhat was in front never at all confessed to not holding the stage.\r\nThree minutes had not passed before Milly quite knew she should have\r\ndone nothing Aunt Maud had just asked her. She knew it moreover by much\r\nthe same light that had acted for her with that lady and with Sir Luke\r\nStrett. It pressed upon her then and there that she was still in a\r\ncurrent determined, through her indifference, timidity, bravery,\r\ngenerosity--she scarce could say which--by others; that not she but the\r\ncurrent acted, and that somebody else, always, was the keeper of the\r\nlock or the dam. Kate for example had but to open the flood-gate: the\r\ncurrent moved in its mass--the current, as it had been, of her doing as\r\nKate wanted. What, somehow, in the most extraordinary way in the world,\r\n_had_ Kate wanted but to be, of a sudden, more interesting than she had\r\never been? Milly, for their evening then, quite held her breath with\r\nthe appreciation of it. If she hadn\'t been sure her companion would\r\nhave had nothing, from her moments with Mrs. Lowder, to go by, she\r\nwould almost have seen the admirable creature "cutting in" to\r\nanticipate a danger. This fantasy indeed, while they sat together,\r\ndropped after a little; even if only because other fantasies multiplied\r\nand clustered, making fairly, for our young woman, the buoyant medium\r\nin which her friend talked and moved. They sat together, I say, but\r\nKate moved as much as she talked; she figured there, restless and\r\ncharming, just perhaps a shade perfunctory, repeatedly quitting her\r\nplace, taking slowly, to and fro, in the trailing folds of her light\r\ndress, the length of the room, and almost avowedly performing for the\r\npleasure of her hostess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lowder had said to Milly at Matcham that she and her niece, as\r\nallies, could practically conquer the world; but though it was a speech\r\nabout which there had even then been a vague, grand glamour, the girl\r\nread into it at present more of an approach to a meaning. Kate, for\r\nthat matter, by herself, could conquer anything, and _she,_ Milly\r\nTheale, was probably concerned with the "world" only as the small scrap\r\nof it that most impinged on her and that was therefore first to be\r\ndealt with. On this basis of being dealt with she would doubtless\r\nherself do her share of the conquering: she would have something to\r\nsupply, Kate something to take--each of them thus, to that tune,\r\nsomething for squaring with Aunt Maud\'s ideal. This in short was what\r\nit came to now--that the occasion, in the quiet late lamplight, had the\r\nquality of a rough rehearsal of the possible big drama. Milly knew\r\nherself dealt with--handsomely, completely: she surrendered to the\r\nknowledge, for so it was, she felt, that she supplied her helpful\r\nforce. And what Kate had to take Kate took as freely and, to all\r\nappearance, as gratefully; accepting afresh, with each of her long,\r\nslow walks, the relation between them so established and consecrating\r\nher companion\'s surrender simply by the interest she gave it. The\r\ninterest to Milly herself we naturally mean; the interest to Kate Milly\r\nfelt as probably inferior. It easily and largely came for their present\r\ntalk, for the quick flight of the hour before the breach of the\r\nspell--it all came, when considered, from the circumstance, not in the\r\nleast abnormal, that the handsome girl was in extraordinary "form."\r\nMilly remembered her having said that she was at her best late at\r\nnight; remembered it by its having, with its fine assurance, made her\r\nwonder when _she_ was at her best and how happy people must be who had\r\nsuch a fixed time. She had no time at all; she was never at her\r\nbest--unless indeed it were exactly, as now, in listening, watching,\r\nadmiring, collapsing. If Kate moreover, quite mercilessly, had never\r\nbeen so good, the beauty and the marvel of it was that she had never\r\nreally been so frank; being a person of such a calibre, as Milly would\r\nhave said, that, even while "dealing" with you and thereby, as it were,\r\npicking her steps, she could let herself go, could, in irony, in\r\nconfidence, in extravagance, tell you things she had never told before.\r\nThat was the impression--that she was telling things, and quite\r\nconceivably for her own relief as well; almost as if the errors of\r\nvision, the mistakes of proportion, the residuary innocence of spirit\r\nstill to be remedied on the part of her auditor had their moments of\r\nproving too much for her nerves. She went at them just now, these\r\nsources of irritation, with an amused energy that it would have been\r\nopen to Milly to regard as cynical and that was nevertheless called\r\nfor--as to this the other was distinct--by the way that in certain\r\nconnections the American mind broke down. It seemed at least--the\r\nAmerican mind as sitting there thrilled and dazzled in Milly--not to\r\nunderstand English society without a separate confrontation with _all_\r\nthe cases. It couldn\'t proceed by--there was some technical term she\r\nlacked until Milly suggested both analogy and induction, and then,\r\ndifferently, instinct, none of which were right: it had to be led up\r\nand introduced to each aspect of the monster, enabled to walk all round\r\nit, whether for the consequent exaggerated ecstasy or for the still\r\nmore as appeared to this critic disproportionate shock. It might, the\r\nmonster, Kate conceded, loom large for those born amid forms less\r\ndeveloped and therefore no doubt less amusing; it might on some sides\r\nbe a strange and dreadful monster, calculated to devour the unwary, to\r\nabase the proud, to scandalize the good; but if one had to live with it\r\none must, not to be for ever sitting up, learn how: which was virtually\r\nin short to-night what the handsome girl showed herself as teaching.\r\n\r\nShe gave away publicly, in this process, Lancaster Gate and everything\r\nit contained; she gave away, hand over hand, Milly\'s thrill continued\r\nto note, Aunt Maud and Aunt Maud\'s glories and Aunt Maud\'s\r\ncomplacencies; she gave herself away most of all, and it was naturally\r\nwhat most contributed to her candour. She didn\'t speak to her friend\r\nonce more, in Aunt Maud\'s strain, of how they could scale the skies;\r\nshe spoke, by her bright, perverse preference on this occasion, of the\r\nneed, in the first place, of being neither stupid nor vulgar. It might\r\nhave been a lesson, for our young American, in the art of seeing things\r\nas they were--a lesson so various and so sustained that the pupil had,\r\nas we have shown, but receptively to gape. The odd thing furthermore\r\nwas that it could serve its purpose while explicitly disavowing every\r\npersonal bias. It wasn\'t that she disliked Aunt Maud, who was\r\neverything she had on other occasions declared; but the dear woman,\r\nineffaceably stamped by inscrutable nature and a dreadful art,\r\nwasn\'t--how _could_ she be?--what she wasn\'t. She wasn\'t any one. She\r\nwasn\'t anything. She wasn\'t anywhere. Milly mustn\'t think it--one\r\ncouldn\'t, as a good friend, let her. Those hours at Matcham were\r\n_inesp\xe9r\xe9es,_ were pure manna from heaven; or if not wholly that\r\nperhaps, with humbugging old Lord Mark as a backer, were vain as a\r\nground for hopes and calculations. Lord Mark was very well, but he\r\nwasn\'t _the_ cleverest creature in England, and even if he had been he\r\nstill wouldn\'t have been the most obliging. He weighed it out in\r\nounces, and indeed each of the pair was really waiting for what the\r\nother would put down.\r\n\r\n"She has put down _you."_ said Milly, attached to the subject still;\r\n"and I think what you mean is that, on the counter, she still keeps\r\nhold of you."\r\n\r\n"Lest"--Kate took it up--"he should suddenly grab me and run? Oh, as he\r\nisn\'t ready to run, he\'s much less ready, naturally, to grab. I\r\n_am_--you\'re so far right as that--on the counter, when I\'m not in the\r\nshop-window; in and out of which I\'m thus conveniently, commercially\r\nwhisked: the essence, all of it, of my position, and the price, as\r\nproperly, of my aunt\'s protection." Lord Mark was substantially what\r\nshe had begun with as soon as they were alone; the impression was even\r\nyet with Milly of her having sounded his name, having imposed it, as a\r\ntopic, in direct opposition to the other name that Mrs. Lowder had left\r\nin the air and that all her own look, as we have seen, kept there at\r\nfirst for her companion. The immediate strange effect had been that of\r\nher consciously needing, as it were, an alibi--which, successfully, she\r\nso found. She had worked it to the end, ridden it to and fro across the\r\ncourse marked for Milly by Aunt Maud, and now she had quite, so to\r\nspeak, broken it in. "The bore is that if she wants him so much--wants\r\nhim, heaven forgive her! for _me_--he has put us all out, since your\r\narrival, by wanting somebody else. I don\'t mean somebody else than you."\r\n\r\nMilly threw off the charm sufficiently to shake her head. "Then I\r\nhaven\'t made out who it is. If I\'m any part of his alternative he had\r\nbetter stop where he is."\r\n\r\n"Truly, truly?--always, always?"\r\n\r\nMilly tried to insist with an equal gaiety. "Would you like me to\r\nswear?"\r\n\r\nKate appeared for a moment--though that was doubtless but gaiety\r\ntoo--to think. "Haven\'t we been swearing enough?"\r\n\r\n"You have perhaps, but I haven\'t, and I ought to give you the\r\nequivalent. At any rate there it is. Truly, truly as you say--\'always,\r\nalways.\' So I\'m not in the way."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Kate--"but that doesn\'t help me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s as simplifying for _him_ that I speak of it."\r\n\r\n"The difficulty really is that he\'s a person with so many ideas that\r\nit\'s particularly hard to simplify for him. That\'s exactly of course\r\nwhat Aunt Maud has been trying. He won\'t," Kate firmly continued, "make\r\nup his mind about me."\r\n\r\n"Well," Milly smiled, "give him time."\r\n\r\nHer friend met it in perfection. "One is _doing_ that--one _is._ But\r\none remains, all the same, but one of his ideas."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no harm in that," Milly returned, "if you come out in the end\r\nas the best of them. What\'s a man," she pursued, "especially an\r\nambitious one, without a variety of ideas?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt. The more the merrier." And Kate looked at her grandly. "One\r\ncan but hope to come out, and do nothing to prevent it."\r\n\r\nAll of which made for the impression, fantastic or not, of the _alibi._\r\nThe splendour, the grandeur were, for Milly, the bold ironic spirit\r\nbehind it, so interesting too in itself. What, moreover, was not less\r\ninteresting was the fact, as our young woman noted it, that Kate\r\nconfined her point to the difficulties, so far as _she_ was concerned,\r\nraised only by Lord Mark. She referred now to none that her own taste\r\nmight present; which circumstance again played its little part. She was\r\ndoing what she liked in respect to another person, but she was in no\r\nway committed to the other person, and her furthermore talking of Lord\r\nMark as not young and not true were only the signs of her clear\r\nself-consciousness, were all in the line of her slightly hard, but\r\nscarce the less graceful extravagance. She didn\'t wish to show too much\r\nher consent to be arranged for, but that was a different thing from not\r\nwishing sufficiently to give it. There was something moreover, on it\r\nall, that Milly still found occasion to say, "If your aunt has been, as\r\nyou tell me, put out by me, I feel that she has remained remarkably\r\nkind."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but she has--whatever might have happened in that respect--plenty\r\nof use for you! You put her in, my dear, more than you put her out. You\r\ndon\'t half see it, but she has clutched your petticoat. You can do\r\nanything--you can do, I mean, lots that _we_ can\'t. You\'re an outsider,\r\nindependent and standing by yourself; you\'re not hideously relative to\r\ntiers and tiers of others." And Kate, facing in that direction, went\r\nfurther and further; wound up, while Milly gaped, with extraordinary\r\nwords. "We\'re of no use to you--it\'s decent to tell you. You\'d be of\r\nuse to us, but that\'s a different matter. My honest advice to you would\r\nbe--" she went indeed all lengths--"to drop us while you can. It would\r\nbe funny if you didn\'t soon see how awfully better you can do. We\'ve\r\nnot really done for you the least thing worth speaking of--nothing you\r\nmightn\'t easily have had in some other way. Therefore you\'re under no\r\nobligation. You won\'t want us next year; we shall only continue to want\r\n_you._ But that\'s no reason for you, and you mustn\'t pay too dreadfully\r\nfor poor Mrs. Stringham\'s having let you in. She has the best\r\nconscience in the world; she\'s enchanted with what she has done; but\r\nyou shouldn\'t take your people from _her._ It has been quite awful to\r\nsee you do it."\r\n\r\nMilly tried to be amused, so as not--it was too absurd--to be fairly\r\nfrightened. Strange enough indeed--if not natural enough--that, late at\r\nnight thus, in a mere mercenary house, with Susie away, a want of\r\nconfidence should possess her. She recalled, with all the rest of it,\r\nthe next day, piecing things together in the dawn, that she had felt\r\nherself alone with a creature who paced like a panther. That was a\r\nviolent image, but it made her a little less ashamed of having been\r\nscared. For all her scare, none the less, she had now the sense to find\r\nwords. "And yet without Susie I shouldn\'t have had you."\r\n\r\nIt had been at this point, however, that Kate flickered highest. "Oh,\r\nyou may very well loathe me yet!"\r\n\r\nReally at last, thus, it had been too much; as, with her own least\r\nfeeble flare, after a wondering watch, Milly had shown. She hadn\'t\r\ncared; she had too much wanted to know; and, though a small solemnity\r\nof reproach, a sombre strain, had broken into her tone, it was to\r\nfigure as her nearest approach to serving Mrs. Lowder. "Why do you say\r\nsuch things to me?"\r\n\r\nThis unexpectedly had acted, by a sudden turn of Kate\'s attitude, as a\r\nhappy speech. She had risen as she spoke, and Kate had stopped before\r\nher, shining at her instantly with a softer brightness. Poor Milly\r\nhereby enjoyed one of her views of how people, wincing oddly, were\r\noften touched by her. "Because you\'re a dove." With which she felt\r\nherself ever so delicately, so considerately, embraced; not with\r\nfamiliarity or as a liberty taken, but almost ceremonially and in the\r\nmanner of an accolade; partly as if, though a dove who could perch on a\r\nfinger, one were also a princess with whom forms were to be observed.\r\nIt even came to her, through the touch of her companion\'s lips, that\r\nthis form, this cool pressure, fairly sealed the sense of what Kate had\r\njust said. It was moreover, for the girl, like an inspiration: she\r\nfound herself accepting as the right one, while she caught her breath\r\nwith relief, the name so given her. She met it on the instant as she\r\nwould have met the revealed truth; it lighted up the strange dusk in\r\nwhich she lately had walked. _That_ was what was the matter with her.\r\nShe was a dove. Oh, _wasn\'t_ she?--it echoed within her as she became\r\naware of the sound, outside, of the return of their friends. There was,\r\nthe next thing, little enough doubt about it after Aunt Maud had been\r\ntwo minutes in the room. She had come up, Mrs. Lowder, with\r\nSusan--which she needn\'t have done, at that hour, instead of letting\r\nKate come down to her; so that Milly could be quite sure it was to\r\ncatch hold, in some way, of the loose end they had left. Well, the way\r\nshe did catch was simply to make the point that it didn\'t now in the\r\nleast matter. She had mounted the stairs for this, and she had her\r\nmoment again with her younger hostess while Kate, on the spot, as the\r\nlatter at the time noted, gave Susan Shepherd unwonted opportunities.\r\nKate was in other words, as Aunt Maud engaged her friend, listening\r\nwith the handsomest response to Mrs. Stringham\'s impression of the\r\nscene they had just quitted. It was in the tone of the fondest\r\nindulgence--almost, really, that of dove cooing to dove--that Mrs.\r\nLowder expressed to Milly the hope that it had all gone beautifully.\r\nHer "all" had an ample benevolence; it soothed and simplified; she\r\nspoke as if it were the two young women, not she and her comrade, who\r\nhad been facing the town together. But Milly\'s answer had prepared\r\nitself while Aunt Maud was on the stair; she had felt in a rush all the\r\nreasons that would make it the most dovelike; and she gave it, while\r\nshe was about it, as earnest, as candid. "I don\'t _think,_ dear lady,\r\nhe\'s here."\r\n\r\nIt gave her straightway the measure of the success she could have as a\r\ndove: that was recorded in the long look of deep criticism, a look\r\nwithout a word, that Mrs. Lowder poured forth. And the word, presently,\r\nbettered it still. "Oh, you exquisite thing!" The luscious innuendo of\r\nit, almost startling, lingered in the room, after the visitors had\r\ngone, like an oversweet fragrance. But left alone with Mrs. Stringham\r\nMilly continued to breathe it: she studied again the dovelike and so\r\nset her companion to mere rich reporting that she averted all inquiry\r\ninto her own case.\r\n\r\nThat, with the new day, was once more her law--though she saw before\r\nher, of course, as something of a complication, her need, each time, to\r\ndecide. She should have to be clear as to how a dove _would_ act. She\r\nsettled it, she thought, well enough this morning by quite readopting\r\nher plan in respect to Sir Luke Strett. That, she was pleased to\r\nreflect, had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent\r\ndrab; and although Mrs. Stringham, after breakfast, began by staring at\r\nit as if it had been a priceless Persian carpet suddenly unrolled at\r\nher feet, she had no scruple, at the end of five minutes, in leaving\r\nher to make the best of it. "Sir Luke Strett comes, by appointment, to\r\nsee me at eleven, but I\'m going out on purpose. He\'s to be told,\r\nplease, deceptively, that I\'m at home, and, you, as my representative,\r\nwhen he comes up, are to see him instead. He will like that, this time,\r\nbetter. So do be nice to him." It had taken, naturally, more\r\nexplanation, and the mention, above all, of the fact that the visitor\r\nwas the greatest of doctors; yet when once the key had been offered\r\nSusie slipped it on her bunch, and her young friend could again feel\r\nher lovely imagination operate. It operated in truth very much as Mrs.\r\nLowder\'s, at the last, had done the night before: it made the air heavy\r\nonce more with the extravagance of assent. It might, afresh, almost\r\nhave frightened our young woman to see how people rushed to meet her:\r\n_had_ she then so little time to live that the road must always be\r\nspared her? It was as if they were helping her to take it out on the\r\nspot. Susie--she couldn\'t deny, and didn\'t pretend to--might, of a\r\ntruth, on _her_ side, have treated such news as a flash merely lurid;\r\nas to which, to do Susie justice, the pain of it was all there. But,\r\nnone the less, the margin always allowed her young friend was all there\r\nas well; and the proposal now made her what was it in short but\r\nByzantine? The vision of Milly\'s perception of the propriety of the\r\nmatter had, at any rate, quickly engulfed, so far as her attitude was\r\nconcerned, any surprise and any shock; so that she only desired, the\r\nnext thing, perfectly to possess the facts. Milly could easily speak,\r\non this, as if there were only one: she made nothing of such another as\r\nthat she had felt herself menaced. The great fact, in fine, was that\r\nshe _knew_ him to desire just now, more than anything else, to meet,\r\nquite apart, some one interested in her. Who therefore so interested as\r\nher faithful Susan? The only other circumstance that, by the time she\r\nhad quitted her friend, she had treated as worth mentioning was the\r\ncircumstance of her having at first intended to keep quiet. She had\r\noriginally best seen herself as sweetly secretive. As to that she had\r\nchanged, and her present request was the result. She didn\'t say why she\r\nhad changed, but she trusted her faithful Susan. Their visitor would\r\ntrust her not less, and she herself would adore their visitor. Moreover\r\nhe wouldn\'t--the girl felt sure--tell her anything dreadful. The worst\r\nwould be that he was in love and that he needed a confidant to work it.\r\nAnd now she was going to the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nThe idea of the National Gallery had been with her from the moment of\r\nher hearing from Sir Luke Strett about his hour of coming. It had been\r\nin her mind as a place so meagrely visited, as one of the places that\r\nhad seemed at home one of the attractions of Europe and one of its\r\nhighest aids to culture, but that--the old story--the typical frivolous\r\nalways ended by sacrificing to vulgar pleasures. She had had perfectly,\r\nat those whimsical moments on the Br\xfcnig, the half-shamed sense of\r\nturning her back on such opportunities for real improvement as had\r\nfigured to her, from of old, in connection with the continental tour,\r\nunder the general head of "pictures and things"; and now she knew for\r\nwhat she had done so. The plea had been explicit--she had done so for\r\nlife, as opposed to learning; the upshot of which had been that life\r\nwas now beautifully provided for. In spite of those few dips and dashes\r\ninto the many-coloured stream of history for which of late Kate Croy\r\nhad helped her to find time, there were possible great chances she had\r\nneglected, possible great moments she should, save for to-day, have all\r\nbut missed. She might still, she had felt, overtake one or two of them\r\namong the Titians and the Turners; she had been honestly nursing the\r\nhour, and, once she was in the benignant halls, her faith knew itself\r\njustified. It was the air she wanted and the world she would now\r\nexclusively choose; the quiet chambers, nobly overwhelming, rich but\r\nslightly veiled, opened out round her and made her presently say "If I\r\ncould lose myself _here!"_ There were people, people in plenty, but,\r\nadmirably, no personal question. It was immense, outside, the personal\r\nquestion; but she had blissfully left it outside, and the nearest it\r\ncame, for a quarter of an hour, to glimmering again into sight was when\r\nshe watched for a little one of the more earnest of the lady-copyists.\r\nTwo or three in particular, spectacled, aproned, absorbed, engaged her\r\nsympathy to an absurd extent, seemed to show her for the time the right\r\nway to live. She should have been a lady copyist--it met so the case.\r\nThe case was the case of escape, of living under water, of being at\r\nonce impersonal and firm. There it was before one--one had only to\r\nstick and stick.\r\n\r\nMilly yielded to this charm till she was almost ashamed; she watched\r\nthe lady-copyists till she found herself wondering what would be\r\nthought by others of a young woman, of adequate aspect, who should\r\nappear to regard them as the pride of the place. She would have liked\r\nto talk to them, to get, as it figured to her, into their lives, and\r\nwas deterred but by the fact that she didn\'t quite see herself as\r\npurchasing imitations and yet feared she might excite the expectation\r\nof purchase. She really knew before long that what held her was the\r\nmere refuge, that something within her was after all too weak for the\r\nTurners and Titians. They joined hands about her in a circle too vast,\r\nthough a circle that a year before she would only have desired to\r\ntrace. They were truly for the larger, not for the smaller life, the\r\nlife of which the actual pitch, for example, was an interest, the\r\ninterest of compassion, in misguided efforts. She marked absurdly her\r\nlittle stations, blinking, in her shrinkage of curiosity, at the\r\nglorious walls, yet keeping an eye on vistas and approaches, so that\r\nshe shouldn\'t be flagrantly caught. The vistas and approaches drew her\r\nin this way from room to room, and she had been through many parts of\r\nthe show, as she supposed, when she sat down to rest. There were chairs\r\nin scant clusters, places from which one could gaze. Milly indeed at\r\npresent fixed her eyes more than elsewhere on the appearance, first,\r\nthat she couldn\'t quite, after all, have accounted to an examiner for\r\nthe order of her "schools," and then on that of her being more tired\r\nthan she had meant, in spite of her having been so much less\r\nintelligent. They found, her eyes, it should be added, other occupation\r\nas well, which she let them freely follow: they rested largely, in her\r\nvagueness, on the vagueness of other visitors; they attached themselves\r\nin especial, with mixed results, to the surprising stream of her\r\ncompatriots. She was struck with the circumstance that the great\r\nmuseum, early in August, was haunted with these pilgrims, as also with\r\nthat of her knowing them from afar, marking them easily, each and all,\r\nand recognising not less promptly that they had ever new lights for\r\nher--new lights on their own darkness. She gave herself up at last, and\r\nit was a consummation like another: what she should have come to the\r\nNational Gallery for to-day would be to watch the copyists and reckon\r\nthe Baedekers. That perhaps was the moral of a menaced state of\r\nhealth--that one would sit in public places and count the Americans. It\r\npassed the time in a manner; but it seemed already the second line of\r\ndefence, and this notwithstanding the pattern, so unmistakable, of her\r\ncountry-folk. They were cut out as by scissors, coloured, labelled,\r\nmounted; but their relation to her failed to act--they somehow did\r\nnothing for her. Partly, no doubt, they didn\'t so much as notice or\r\nknow her, didn\'t even recognise their community of collapse with her,\r\nthe sign on her, as she sat there, that for her too Europe was "tough."\r\nIt came to her idly thus--for her humour could still play--that she\r\ndidn\'t seem then the same success with them as with the inhabitants of\r\nLondon, who had taken her up on scarce more of an acquaintance. She\r\ncould wonder if they would be different should she go back with that\r\nglamour attached; and she could also wonder, if it came to that,\r\nwhether she should ever go back. Her friends straggled past, at any\r\nrate, in all the vividness of their absent criticism, and she had even\r\nat last the sense of taking a mean advantage. There was a finer\r\ninstant, however, at which three ladies, clearly a mother and\r\ndaughters, had paused before her under compulsion of a comment\r\napparently just uttered by one of them and referring to some object on\r\nthe other side of the room. Milly had her back to the object, but her\r\nface very much to her young compatriot, the one who had spoken and in\r\nwhose look she perceived a certain gloom of recognition. Recognition,\r\nfor that matter, sat confessedly in her own eyes: she _knew_ the three,\r\ngenerically, as easily as a schoolboy with a crib in his lap would know\r\nthe answer in class; she felt, like the schoolboy, guilty\r\nenough--questioned, as honour went, as to her right so to possess, to\r\ndispossess, people who hadn\'t consciously provoked her. She would have\r\nbeen able to say where they lived, and how, had the place and the way\r\nbeen but amenable to the positive; she bent tenderly, in imagination,\r\nover marital, paternal Mr. Whatever-he-was, at home, eternally named,\r\nwith all the honours and placidities, but eternally unseen and existing\r\nonly as some one who could be financially heard from. The mother, the\r\npuffed and composed whiteness of whose hair had no relation to her\r\napparent age, showed a countenance almost chemically clean and dry; her\r\ncompanions wore an air of vague resentment humanised by fatigue; and\r\nthe three were equally adorned with short cloaks of coloured cloth\r\nsurmounted by little tartan hoods. The tartans were doubtless\r\nconceivable as different, but the cloaks, curiously, only thinkable as\r\none. "Handsome? Well, if you choose to say so." It was the mother who\r\nhad spoken, who herself added, after a pause during which Milly took\r\nthe reference as to a picture: "In the English style." The three pair\r\nof eyes had converged, and their possessors had for an instant rested,\r\nwith the effect of a drop of the subject, on this last\r\ncharacterisation--with that, too, of a gloom not less mute in one of\r\nthe daughters than murmured in the other. Milly\'s heart went out to\r\nthem while they turned their backs; she said to herself that they ought\r\nto have known her, that there was something between them they might\r\nhave beautifully put together. But she had lost _them_ also--they were\r\ncold; they left her in her weak wonder as to what they had been looking\r\nat. The "handsome" disposed her to turn--all the more that the "English\r\nstyle" would be the English school, which she liked; only she saw,\r\nbefore moving, by the array on the side facing her, that she was in\r\nfact among small Dutch pictures. The action of this was again\r\nappreciable--the dim surmise that it wouldn\'t then be by a picture that\r\nthe spring in the three ladies had been pressed. It was at all events\r\ntime she should go, and she turned as she got on her feet. She had had\r\nbehind her one of the entrances and various visitors who had come in\r\nwhile she sat, visitors single and in pairs--by one of the former of\r\nwhom she felt her eyes suddenly held.\r\n\r\nThis was a gentleman in the middle of the place, a gentleman who had\r\nremoved his hat and was for a moment, while he glanced, absently, as\r\nshe could see, at the top tier of the collection, tapping his forehead\r\nwith his pocket-handkerchief. The occupation held him long enough to\r\ngive Milly time to take for granted--and a few seconds sufficed--that\r\nhis face was the object just observed by her friends. This could only\r\nhave been because she concurred in their tribute, even qualified, and\r\nindeed "the English style" of the gentleman--perhaps by instant\r\ncontrast to the American--was what had had the arresting power. This\r\narresting power, at the same time--and that was the marvel--had already\r\nsharpened almost to pain, for in the very act of judging the bared head\r\nwith detachment she felt herself shaken by a knowledge of it. It was\r\nMerton Densher\'s own, and he was standing there, standing long enough\r\nunconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate. These successions\r\nwere swift, so that she could still ask herself in freedom if she had\r\nbest let him see her. She could still reply to that that she shouldn\'t\r\nlike him to catch her in the effort to prevent this; and she might\r\nfurther have decided that he was too preoccupied to see anything had\r\nnot a perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence. She\r\nwas unable to think afterwards how long she had looked at him before\r\nknowing herself as otherwise looked at; all she was coherently to put\r\ntogether was that she had had a second recognition without his having\r\nnoticed her. The source of this latter shock was nobody less than Kate\r\nCroy--Kate Croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and whose\r\neyes met her eyes at their next movement. Kate was but two yards\r\noff--Mr. Densher wasn\'t alone. Kate\'s face specifically said so, for\r\nafter a stare as blank at first as Milly\'s it broke into a far smile.\r\nThat was what, wonderfully--in addition to the marvel of their\r\nmeeting--passed from her for Milly; the instant reduction to easy terms\r\nof the fact of their being there, the two young women, together. It was\r\nperhaps only afterwards that the girl fully felt the connection between\r\nthis touch and her already established conviction that Kate was a\r\nprodigious person; yet on the spot she none the less, in a degree, knew\r\nherself handled and again, as she had been the night before, dealt\r\nwith--absolutely even dealt with for her greater pleasure. A minute in\r\nfine hadn\'t elapsed before Kate had somehow made her provisionally take\r\neverything as natural. The provisional was just the charm--acquiring\r\nthat character from one moment to the other; it represented happily so\r\nmuch that Kate would explain on the very first chance. This left\r\nmoreover--and that was the greatest wonder--all due margin for\r\namusement at the way things happened, the monstrous oddity of their\r\nturning up in such a place on the very heels of their having separated\r\nwithout allusion to it. The handsome girl was thus literally in control\r\nof the scene by the time Merton Densher was ready to exclaim with a\r\nhigh flush, or a vivid blush--one didn\'t distinguish the embarrassment\r\nfrom the joy--"Why, Miss Theale: fancy!" and "Why, Miss Theale: what\r\nluck!"\r\n\r\nMiss Theale had meanwhile the sense that for him too, on Kate\'s part,\r\nsomething wonderful and unspoken was determinant; and this although,\r\ndistinctly, his companion had no more looked at him with a hint than he\r\nhad looked at her with a question. He had looked and he was looking\r\nonly at Milly herself, ever so pleasantly and considerately--she scarce\r\nknew what to call it; but without prejudice to her consciousness, all\r\nthe same, that women got out of predicaments better than men. The\r\npredicament of course wasn\'t definite or phraseable--and the way they\r\nlet all phrasing pass was presently to recur to our young woman as a\r\ncharacteristic triumph of the civilised state; but she took it for\r\ngranted, insistently, with a small private flare of passion, because\r\nthe one thing she could think of to do for him was to show him how she\r\neased him off. She would really, tired and nervous, have been much\r\ndisconcerted, were it not that the opportunity in question had saved\r\nher. It was what had saved her most, what had made her, after the first\r\nfew seconds, almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her, had made her\r\nonly ask herself what their friend would like of her. That he was at\r\nthe end of three minutes, without the least complicated reference, so\r\nsmoothly "their" friend was just the effect of their all being\r\nsublimely civilised. The flash in which he saw this was, for Milly,\r\nfairly inspiring--to that degree in fact that she was even now, on such\r\na plane, yearning to be supreme. It took, no doubt, a big dose of\r\ninspiration to treat as not funny--or at least as not unpleasant--the\r\nanomaly, for Kate, that _she_ knew their gentleman, and for herself,\r\nthat Kate was spending the morning with him; but everything continued\r\nto make for this after Milly had tasted of her draught. She was to\r\nwonder in subsequent reflection what in the world they had actually\r\nsaid, since they had made such a success of what they didn\'t say; the\r\nsweetness of the draught for the time, at any rate, was to feel success\r\nassured. What depended on this for Mr. Densher was all obscurity to\r\nher, and she perhaps but invented the image of his need as a short cut\r\nto service. Whatever were the facts, their perfect manners, all round,\r\nsaw them through. The finest part of Milly\'s own inspiration, it may\r\nfurther be mentioned, was the quick perception that what would be of\r\nmost service was, so to speak, her own native wood-note. She had long\r\nbeen conscious with shame for her thin blood, or at least for her poor\r\neconomy, of her unused margin as an American girl--closely indeed as,\r\nin English air, the text might appear to cover the page. She still had\r\nreserves of spontaneity, if not of comicality; so that all this cash in\r\nhand could now find employment. She became as spontaneous as possible\r\nand as American as it might conveniently appeal to Mr. Densher, after\r\nhis travels, to find her. She said things in the air, and yet flattered\r\nherself that she struck him as saying them not in the tone of agitation\r\nbut in the tone of New York. In the tone of New York agitation was\r\nbeautifully discounted, and she had now a sufficient view of how much\r\nit might accordingly help her.\r\n\r\nThe help was fairly rendered before they left the place; when her\r\nfriends presently accepted her invitation to adjourn with her to\r\nluncheon at her hotel, it was in the Fifth Avenue that the meal might\r\nhave waited. Kate had never been there so straight, but Milly was at\r\npresent taking her; and if Mr. Densher had been he had at least never\r\nhad to come so fast. She proposed it as the natural thing--proposed it\r\nas the American girl; and she saw herself quickly justified by the pace\r\nat which she was followed. The beauty of the case was that to do it all\r\nshe had only to appear to take Kate\'s hint. This had said, in its fine\r\nfirst smile, "Oh yes, our look is queer--but give me time;" and the\r\nAmerican girl could give time as nobody else could. What Milly thus\r\ngave she therefore made them take--even if, as they might surmise, it\r\nwas rather more than they wanted. In the porch of the museum she\r\nexpressed her preference for a four-wheeler; they would take their\r\ncourse in that guise precisely to multiply the minutes. She was more\r\nthan ever justified by the positive charm that her spirit imparted even\r\nto their use of this conveyance; and she touched her highest\r\npoint--that is, certainly, for herself--as she ushered her companions\r\ninto the presence of Susie. Susie was there with luncheon, with her\r\nreturn, in prospect; and nothing could now have filled her own\r\nconsciousness more to the brim than to see this good friend take in how\r\nlittle she was abjectly anxious. The cup itself actually offered to\r\nthis good friend might in truth well be startling, for it was composed\r\nbeyond question of ingredients oddly mixed. She caught Susie fairly\r\nlooking at her as if to know whether she had brought in guests to hear\r\nSir Luke Strett\'s report. Well, it was better her companion should have\r\ntoo much than too little to wonder about; she had come out "anyway," as\r\nthey said at home, for the interest of the thing; and interest truly\r\nsat in her eyes. Milly was none the less, at the sharpest crisis, a\r\nlittle sorry for her; she could of necessity extract from the odd scene\r\nso comparatively little of a soothing secret. She saw Mr. Densher\r\nsuddenly popping up, but she saw nothing else that had happened. She\r\nsaw in the same way her young friend indifferent to her young friend\'s\r\ndoom, and she lacked what would explain it. The only thing to keep her\r\nin patience was the way, after luncheon, Kate almost, as might be said,\r\nmade up to her. This was actually perhaps as well what most kept Milly\r\nherself in patience. It had in fact for our young woman a positive\r\nbeauty--was so marked as a deviation from the handsome girl\'s previous\r\ncourses. Susie had been a bore to the handsome girl, and the change was\r\nnow suggestive. The two sat together, after they had risen from table,\r\nin the apartment in which they had lunched, making it thus easy for the\r\nother guest and his entertainer to sit in the room adjacent. This, for\r\nthe latter personage, was the beauty; it was almost, on Kate\'s part,\r\nlike a prayer to be relieved. If she honestly liked better to be\r\n"thrown with" Susan Shepherd than with their other friend, why that\r\nsaid practically everything. It didn\'t perhaps altogether say why she\r\nhad gone out with him for the morning, but it said, as one thought,\r\nabout as much as she could say to his face.\r\n\r\nLittle by little indeed, under the vividness of Kate\'s behaviour, the\r\nprobabilities fell back into their order. Merton Densher was in love,\r\nand Kate couldn\'t help it--could only be sorry and kind: wouldn\'t that,\r\nwithout wild flurries, cover everything? Milly at all events tried it\r\nas a cover, tried it hard, for the time; pulled it over her, in the\r\nfront, the larger room, drew it up to her chin with energy. If it\r\ndidn\'t, so treated, do everything for her, it did so much that she\r\ncould herself supply the rest. She made that up by the interest of her\r\ngreat question, the question of whether, seeing him once more, with all\r\nthat, as she called it to herself, had come and gone, her impression of\r\nhim would be different from the impression received in New York. That\r\nhad held her from the moment of their leaving the museum; it kept her\r\ncompany through their drive and during luncheon; and now that she was a\r\nquarter of an hour alone with him it became acute. She was to feel at\r\nthis crisis that no clear, no common answer, no direct satisfaction on\r\nthis point, was to reach her; she was to see her question itself simply\r\ngo to pieces. She couldn\'t tell if he were different or not, and she\r\ndidn\'t know nor care if _she_ were: these things had ceased to matter\r\nin the light of the only thing she did know. This was that she liked\r\nhim, as she put it to herself, as much as ever; and if that were to\r\namount to liking a new person the amusement would be but the greater.\r\nShe had thought him at first very quiet, in spite of recovery from his\r\noriginal confusion; though even the shade of bewilderment, she yet\r\nperceived, had not been due to such vagueness on the subject of her\r\nreintensified identity as the probable sight, over there, of many\r\nthousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified. No, he was\r\nquiet, inevitably, for the first half of the time, because Milly\'s own\r\nlively line--the line of spontaneity--made everything else relative;\r\nand because too, so far as Kate was spontaneous, it was ever so finely\r\nin the air among them that the normal pitch must be kept. Afterwards,\r\nwhen they had got a little more used, as it were, to each other\'s\r\nseparate felicity, he had begun to talk more, clearly bethought\r\nhimself, at a given moment, of what _his_ natural lively line would be.\r\nIt would be to take for granted she must wish to hear of the States,\r\nand to give her, in its order, everything he had seen and done there.\r\nHe abounded, of a sudden he almost insisted; he returned, after breaks,\r\nto the charge; and the effect was perhaps the more odd as he gave no\r\nclue whatever to what he had admired, as he went, or to what he hadn\'t.\r\nHe simply drenched her with his sociable story--especially during the\r\ntime they were away from the others. She had stopped then being\r\nAmerican--all to let him be English; a permission of which he took, she\r\ncould feel, both immense and unconscious advantage. She had really\r\nnever cared less for the "States" than at this moment; but that had\r\nnothing to do with the matter. It would have been the occasion of her\r\nlife to learn about them, for nothing could put him off, and he\r\nventured on no reference to what had happened for herself. It might\r\nhave been almost as if he had known that the greatest of all these\r\nadventures was her doing just what she did then.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that she saw the smash of her great question as\r\ncomplete, saw that all she had to do with was the sense of being there\r\nwith him. And there was no chill for this in what she also presently\r\nsaw--that, however he had begun, he was now acting from a particular\r\ndesire, determined either by new facts or new fancies, to be like\r\neveryone else, simplifyingly "kind" to her. He had caught on already as\r\nto manner--fallen into line with everyone else; and if his spirits\r\nverily _had_ gone up it might well be that he had thus felt himself\r\nlighting on the remedy for all awkwardness. Whatever he did or he\r\ndidn\'t, Milly knew she should still like him--there was no alternative\r\nto that; but her heart could none the less sink a little on feeling how\r\nmuch his view of her was destined to have in common with--as she now\r\nsighed over it--_the_ view. She could have dreamed of his not having\r\n_the_ view, of his having something or other, if need be quite\r\nviewless, of his own; but he might have what he could with least\r\ntrouble, and _the_ view wouldn\'t be, after all, a positive bar to her\r\nseeing him. The defect of it in general--if she might so ungraciously\r\ncriticise--was that, by its sweet universality, it made relations\r\nrather prosaically a matter of course. It anticipated and superseded\r\nthe--likewise sweet--operation of real affinities. It was this that was\r\ndoubtless marked in her power to keep him now--this and her glassy\r\nlustre of attention to his pleasantness about the scenery in the\r\nRockies. She was in truth a little measuring her success in detaining\r\nhim by Kate\'s success in "standing" Susan. It would not be, if she\r\ncould help it, Mr. Densher who should first break down. Such at least\r\nwas one of the forms of the girl\'s inward tension; but beneath even\r\nthis deep reason was a motive still finer. What she had left at home on\r\ngoing out to give it a chance was meanwhile still, was more sharply and\r\nactively, there. What had been at the top of her mind about it and then\r\nbeen violently pushed down--this quantity was again working up. As soon\r\nas their friends should go Susie would break out, and what she would\r\nbreak out upon wouldn\'t be--interested in that gentleman as she had\r\nmore than once shown herself--the personal fact of Mr. Densher. Milly\r\nhad found in her face at luncheon a feverish glitter, and it told what\r\nshe was full of. She didn\'t care now for Mr. Densher\'s personal fact.\r\nMr. Densher had risen before her only to find his proper place in her\r\nimagination already, of a sudden, occupied. His personal fact failed,\r\nso far as she was concerned, to be personal, and her companion noted\r\nthe failure. This could only mean that she was full to the brim, of Sir\r\nLuke Strett, and of what she had had from him. What _had_ she had from\r\nhim? It was indeed now working upward again that Milly would do well to\r\nknow, though knowledge looked stiff in the light of Susie\'s glitter. It\r\nwas therefore, on the whole, because Densher\'s young hostess was\r\ndivided from it by so thin a partition that she continued to cling to\r\nthe Rockies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wings of the Dove, Volume 1 of 2, by\r\nHenry James\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WINGS OF THE DOVE, VOL 1 OF 2 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 29452-8.txt or 29452-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/5/29452/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Adcock.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
