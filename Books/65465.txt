Professor St. Peter was alone in the\r\ndismantled house where he had lived ever since his marriage, where he\r\nhad worked out his career and brought up his two daughters. It was\r\nalmost as ugly as it is possible for a house to be; square, three\r\nstories in height, painted the colour of ashes--the front porch just too\r\nnarrow for comfort, with a slanting floor and sagging steps. As he\r\nwalked slowly about the empty, echoing rooms on that bright September\r\nmorning, the Professor regarded thoughtfully the needless inconveniences\r\nhe had put up with for so long; the stairs that were too steep, the\r\nhalls that were too cramped, the awkward oak mantles with thick round\r\nposts crowned by bumptious wooden balls, over green-tiled fire-places.\r\n\r\nCertain wobbly stair treads, certain creaky boards in the upstairs hall,\r\nhad made him wince many times a day for twenty-odd years--and they still\r\ncreaked and wobbled. He had a deft hand with tools, he could easily have\r\nfixed them, but there were always so many things to fix, and there was\r\nnot time enough to go round. He went into the kitchen, where he had\r\ncarpentered under a succession of cooks, went up to the bath-room on the\r\nsecond floor, where there was only a painted tin tub; the taps were so\r\nold that no plumber could ever screw them tight enough to stop the drip,\r\nthe window could only be coaxed up and down by wriggling, and the doors\r\nof the linen closet didn\'t fit. He had sympathized with his daughters\'\r\ndissatisfaction, though he could never quite agree with them that the\r\nbath should be the most attractive room in the house. He had spent the\r\nhappiest years of his youth in a house at Versailles where it distinctly\r\nwas not, and he had known many charming people who had no bath at all.\r\nHowever, as his wife said: "If your country has contributed one thing,\r\nat least, to civilization, why not have it?" Many a night, after blowing\r\nout his study lamp, he had leaped into that tub, clad in his pyjamas, to\r\ngive it another coat of some one of the many paints that were advertised\r\nto behave like porcelain, and didn\'t.\r\n\r\nThe Professor in pyjamas was not an unpleasant sight; for looks, the\r\nfewer clothes he had on, the better. Anything that clung to his body\r\nshowed it to be built upon extremely good bones, with the slender hips\r\nand springy shoulders of a tireless swimmer. Though he was born on Lake\r\nMichigan, of mixed stock (Canadian French on one side, and American\r\nfarmers on the other), St. Peter was commonly said to look like a\r\nSpaniard. That was possibly because he had been in Spain a good deal,\r\nand was an authority on certain phases of Spanish history. He had a long\r\nbrown face, with an oval chin over which he wore a close-trimmed Van\r\nDyke, like a tuft of shiny black fur. With this silky, very black hair,\r\nhe had a tawny skin with gold lights in it, a hawk nose, and hawk-like\r\neyes--brown and gold and green. They were set in ample cavities, with\r\nplenty of room to move about, under thick, curly, black eyebrows that\r\nturned up sharply at the outer ends, like military moustaches. His\r\nwicked-looking eyebrows made his students call him Mephistopheles--and\r\nthere was no evading the searching eyes underneath them; eyes that in a\r\nflash could pick out a friend or an unusual stranger from a throng. They\r\nhad lost none of their fire, though just now the man behind them was\r\nfeeling a diminution of ardour.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Kathleen, who had done several successful studies of him in\r\nwater-colour, had once said:--"The thing that really makes Papa handsome\r\nis the modelling of his head between the top of his ear and his crown;\r\nit is quite the best thing about him." That part of his head was high,\r\npolished, hard as bronze, and the close-growing black hair threw off a\r\nstreak of light along the rounded ridge where the skull was fullest. The\r\nmould of his head on the side was so individual and definite, so far\r\nfrom casual, that it was more like a statue\'s head than a man\'s.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the dismantled windows the Professor happened to look out\r\ninto his back garden, and at that cheerful sight he went quickly\r\ndownstairs and escaped from the dusty air and brutal light of the empty\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nHis walled-in garden had been the comfort of his life--and it was the\r\none thing his neighbours held against him. He started to make it soon\r\nafter the birth of his first daughter, when his wife began to be\r\nunreasonable about his spending so much time at the lake and on the\r\ntennis court. In this undertaking he got help and encouragement from his\r\nlandlord, a retired German farmer, good-natured and lenient about\r\neverything but spending money. If the Professor happened to have a new\r\nbaby at home, or a faculty dinner, or an illness in the family, or any\r\nunusual expense, Appelhoff cheerfully waited for the rent; but pay for\r\nrepairs he would not. When it was a question of the garden, however, the\r\nold man sometimes stretched a point. He helped his tenant with seeds and\r\nslips and sound advice, and with his twisted old back. He even spent a\r\nlittle money to bear half the expense of the stucco wall.\r\n\r\nThe Professor had succeeded in making a French garden in Hamilton. There\r\nwas not a blade of grass; it was a tidy half-acre of glistening gravel\r\nand glistening shrubs and bright flowers. There were trees, of course; a\r\nspreading horse-chestnut, a row of slender Lombardy poplars at the back,\r\nalong the white wall, and in the middle two symmetrical, round-topped\r\nlinden-trees. Masses of green-brier grew in the corners, the prickly\r\nstems interwoven and clipped until they were like great bushes. There\r\nwas a bed for salad herbs. Salmon-pink geraniums dripped over the wall.\r\nThe French marigolds and dahlias were just now at their best--such\r\ndahlias as no one else in Hamilton could grow. St. Peter had tended this\r\nbit of ground for over twenty years, and had got the upper hand of it.\r\nIn the spring, when home-sickness for other lands and the fret of things\r\nunaccomplished awoke, he worked off his discontent here. In the long hot\r\nsummers, when he could not go abroad, he stayed at home with his garden,\r\nsending his wife and daughters to Colorado to escape the humid prairie\r\nheat, so nourishing to wheat and corn, so exhausting to human beings. In\r\nthose months when he was a bachelor again, he brought down his books and\r\npapers and worked in a deck chair under the linden-trees; breakfasted\r\nand lunched and had his tea in the garden. And it was there he and Tom\r\nOutland used to sit and talk half through the warm, soft nights.\r\n\r\nOn this September morning, however, St. Peter knew that he could not\r\nevade the unpleasant effects of change by tarrying among his autumn\r\nflowers. He must plunge in like a man, and get used to the feeling that\r\nunder his work-room there was a dead, empty house. He broke off a\r\ngeranium blossom, and with it still in his hand went resolutely up two\r\nflights of stairs to the third floor where, under the slope of the\r\nmansard roof, there was one room still furnished--that is, if it had\r\never been furnished.\r\n\r\nThe low ceiling sloped down on three sides, the slant being interrupted\r\non the east by a single square window, swinging outward on hinges and\r\nheld ajar by a hook in the sill. This was the sole opening for light and\r\nair. Walls and ceiling alike were covered with a yellow paper which had\r\nonce been very ugly, but had faded into inoffensive neutrality. The\r\nmatting on the floor was worn and scratchy. Against the wall stood an\r\nold walnut table, with one leaf up, holding piles of orderly papers.\r\nBefore it was a cane-backed office chair that turned on a screw. This\r\ndark den had for many years been the Professor\'s study.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, off the back parlour, he had a show study, with roomy\r\nshelves where his library was housed, and a proper desk at which he\r\nwrote letters. But it was a sham. This was the place where he worked.\r\nAnd not he alone. For three weeks in the fall, and again three in the\r\nspring, he shared his cuddy with Augusta, the sewing-woman, niece of his\r\nold landlord, a reliable, methodical spinster, a German Catholic and\r\nvery devout.\r\n\r\nSince Augusta finished her day\'s work at five o\'clock, and the\r\nProfessor, on week-days, worked here only at night, they did not elbow\r\neach other too much. Besides, neither was devoid of consideration. Every\r\nevening, before she left, Augusta swept up the scraps from the floor,\r\nrolled her patterns, closed the sewing-machine, and picked ravellings\r\noff the box-couch, so that there would be no threads to stick to the\r\nProfessor\'s old smoking-jacket if he should happen to lie down for a\r\nmoment in working-hours.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter, in his turn, when he put out his lamp after midnight, was\r\ncareful to brush away ashes and tobacco crumbs--smoking was very\r\ndistasteful to Augusta--and to open the hinged window back as far as it\r\nwould go, on the second hook, so that the night wind might carry away\r\nthe smell of his pipe as much as possible. The unfinished dresses which\r\nshe left hanging on the forms, however, were often so saturated with\r\nsmoke that he knew she found it a trial to work on them next morning.\r\n\r\nThese "forms" were the subject of much banter between them. The one\r\nwhich Augusta called "the bust" stood in the darkest corner of the room,\r\nupon a high wooden chest in which blankets and winter wraps were yearly\r\nstored. It was a headless, armless female torso, covered with strong\r\nblack cotton, and so richly developed in the part for which it was named\r\nthat the Professor once explained to Augusta how, in calling it so, she\r\nfollowed a natural law of language, termed, for convenience, metonymy.\r\nAugusta enjoyed the Professor when he was _risqu\xc3\xa9_, since she was sure\r\nof his ultimate delicacy. Though this figure looked so ample and billowy\r\n(as if you might lay your head upon its deep-breathing softness and rest\r\nsafe forever), if you touched it you suffered a severe shock, no matter\r\nhow many times you had touched it before. It presented the most\r\nunsympathetic surface imaginable. Its hardness was not that of wood,\r\nwhich responds to concussion with living vibration and is stimulating to\r\nthe hand, nor that of felt, which drinks something from the fingers. It\r\nwas a dead, opaque, lumpy solidity, like chunks of putty, or tightly\r\npacked sawdust--very disappointing to the tactile sense, yet somehow\r\nalways fooling you again. For no matter how often you had bumped up\r\nagainst that torso, you could never believe that contact with it would\r\nbe as bad as it was.\r\n\r\nThe second form was more self-revelatory; a full-length female figure in\r\na smart wire skirt with a trim metal waist line. It had no legs, as one\r\ncould see all too well, no viscera behind its glistening ribs, and its\r\nbosom resembled a strong wire bird-cage. But St. Peter contended that it\r\nhad a nervous system. When Augusta left it clad for the night in a new\r\nparty dress for Rosamond or Kathleen, it often took on a sprightly,\r\ntricky air, as if it were going out for the evening to make a great show\r\nof being harum-scarum, giddy, _folle._ It seemed just on the point of\r\ntripping downstairs, or on tiptoe, waiting for the waltz to begin. At\r\ntimes the wire lady was most convincing in her pose as a woman of light\r\nbehaviour, but she never fooled St. Peter. He had his blind spots, but\r\nhe had never been taken in by one of her kind!\r\n\r\nAugusta had somehow got it into her head that these forms were\r\nunsuitable companions for one engaged in scholarly pursuits, and she\r\nperiodically apologized for their presence when she came to install\r\nherself and fulfil her "time" at the house.\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Augusta," the Professor had often said. "If they were good\r\nenough for _Monsieur Bergeret_, they are certainly good enough for me."\r\n\r\nThis morning, as St. Peter was sitting in his desk chair, looking\r\nmusingly at the pile of papers before him, the door opened and there\r\nstood Augusta herself. How astonishing that he had not heard her heavy,\r\ndeliberate tread on the now uncarpeted stair!\r\n\r\n"Why, Professor St. Peter! I never thought of finding you here, or I\'d\r\nhave knocked. I guess we will have to do our moving together."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had risen--Augusta loved his manners--but he offered her the\r\nsewing-machine chair and resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Augusta, and we\'ll talk it over. I\'m not moving just\r\nyet--don\'t want to disturb all my papers. I\'m staying on until I finish\r\na piece of writing. I\'ve seen your uncle about it. I\'ll work here, and\r\nboard at the new house. But this is confidential. If it were noised\r\nabout, people might begin to say that Mrs. St. Peter and I had--how do\r\nthey put it, parted, separated?"\r\n\r\nAugusta dropped her eyes in an indulgent smile. "I think people in your\r\nstation would say separated."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; a good scientific term, too. Well, we haven\'t, you know. But\r\nI\'m going to write on here for a while."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. And I won\'t always be getting in your way now. In the\r\nnew house you have a beautiful study downstairs, and I have a light,\r\nairy room on the third floor."\r\n\r\n"Where you won\'t smell smoke, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Professor, I never really minded!" Augusta spoke with feeling. She\r\nrose and took up the black bust in her long arms.\r\n\r\nThe Professor also rose, very quickly. "What are you doing?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. "Oh, I\'m not going to carry them through the street,\r\nProfessor! The grocery boy is downstairs with his cart, to wheel them\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"Wheel them over?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, to the new house, Professor. I\'ve come a week before my\r\nregular time, to make curtains and hem linen for Mrs. St. Peter. I\'ll\r\ntake everything over this morning except the sewing-machine--that\'s too\r\nheavy for the cart, so the boy will come back for it with the delivery\r\nwagon. Would you just open the door for me, please?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t! Not at all. You don\'t need her to make curtains. I can\'t\r\nhave this room changed if I\'m going to work here. He can take the\r\nsewing-machine--yes. But put her back on the chest where she belongs,\r\nplease. She does very well there." St. Peter had got to the door, and\r\nstood with his back against it.\r\n\r\nAugusta rested her burden on the edge of the chest.\r\n\r\n"But next week I\'ll be working on Mrs. St. Peter\'s clothes, and I\'ll\r\nneed the forms. As the boy\'s here, he\'ll just wheel them over," she said\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m damned if he will! They shan\'t be wheeled. They stay right there in\r\ntheir own place. You shan\'t take away my ladies. I never heard of such a\r\nthing!"\r\n\r\nAugusta was vexed with him now, and a little ashamed of him. "But,\r\nProfessor, I can\'t work without my forms. They\'ve been in your way all\r\nthese years, and you\'ve always complained of them, so don\'t be contrary,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"I never complained, Augusta. Perhaps of certain disappointments they\r\nrecalled, or of cruel biological necessities they imply--but of them\r\nindividually, never! Go and buy some new ones for remind me when it\'s\r\nAll Souls\' day, or Ember day, or Maundy Thursday, or anything?"\r\n\r\nAugusta said she must be leaving. St. Peter heard her well-known tread\r\nas she descended the stairs. How much she reminded him of, to be sure!\r\nShe had been most at the house in the days when his daughters were\r\nlittle girls and needed so many clean frocks. It was in those very years\r\nthat he was beginning his great work; when the desire to do it and the\r\ndifficulties attending such a project strove together in his mind like\r\nMacbeth\'s two spent swimmers--years when he had the courage to say to\r\nhimself: "I will do this dazzling, this beautiful, this utterly\r\nimpossible thing!"\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen years he had been working on his _Spanish Adventurers\r\nin North America_, this room had been his centre of operations. There\r\nhad been delightful excursions and digressions; the two Sabbatical years\r\nwhen he was in Spain studying records, two summers in the South-west on\r\nthe trail of his adventurers, another in Old Mexico, dashes to France to\r\nsee his foster-brothers. But the notes and the records and the ideas\r\nalways came back to this room. It was here they were digested and\r\nsorted, and woven into their proper place in his history.\r\n\r\nFairly considered, the sewing-room was the most inconvenient study a man\r\ncould possibly have, but it was the one place in the house where he\r\ncould get isolation, insulation from the engaging drama of domestic\r\nlife. No one was tramping over him, and only a vague sense, generally\r\npleasant, of what went on below came up the narrow stairway. There were\r\ncertainly no other advantages. The furnace heat did not reach the third\r\nfloor. There was no way to warm the sewing-room, except by a rusty,\r\nround gas stove with no flue--a stove which consumed gas imperfectly and\r\ncontaminated the air. To remedy this, the window must be left\r\nopen--otherwise, with the ceiling so low, the air would speedily become\r\nunfit to breathe. If the stove were turned down, and the window left\r\nopen a little way, a sudden gust of wind would blow the wretched thing\r\nout altogether, and a deeply absorbed man might be asphyxiated before he\r\nknew it. The Professor had found that the best method, in winter, was to\r\nturn the gas on full and keep the window wide on the hook, even if he\r\nhad to put on a leather jacket over his working-coat. By that\r\narrangement he had somehow managed to get air enough to work by.\r\n\r\nHe wondered now why he had never looked about for a better stove, a\r\nnewer model; or why he had not at least painted this one, flaky with\r\nrust. But he had been able to get on only by neglecting negative\r\ncomforts. He was by no means an ascetic. He knew that he was terribly\r\nselfish about personal pleasures, fought for them. If a thing gave him\r\ndelight, he got it, if he sold his shirt for it. By doing without many\r\nso-called necessities he had managed to have his luxuries. He might, for\r\ninstance, have had a convenient electric drop-light attached to the\r\nsocket above his writing-table. Preferably he wrote by a faithful\r\nkerosene lamp which he filled and tended himself. But sometimes he found\r\nthat the oil-can in the closet was empty; then, to get more, he would\r\nhave had to go down through the house to the cellar, and on his way he\r\nwould almost surely become interested in what the children were doing,\r\nor in what his wife was doing--or he would notice that the kitchen\r\nlinoleum was breaking under the sink where the maid kicked it up, and he\r\nwould stop to tack it down. On that perilous journey down through the\r\nhuman house he might lose his mood, his enthusiasm, even his temper. So\r\nwhen the lamp was empty--and that usually occurred when he was in the\r\nmiddle of a most important passage--he jammed an eyeshade on his\r\nforehead and worked by the glare of that tormenting pear-shaped bulb,\r\nsticking out of the wall on a short curved neck just about four feet\r\nabove his table. It was hard on eyes even as good as his. But once at\r\nhis desk, he didn\'t dare quit it. He had found that you can train the\r\nmind to be active at a fixed time, just as the stomach is trained to be\r\nhungry at certain hours of the day.\r\n\r\nIf someone in the family happened to be sick, he didn\'t go to his study\r\nat all. Two evenings of the week he spent with his wife and daughters,\r\nand one evening he and his wife went out to dinner, or to the theatre or\r\na concert. That left him only four. He had Saturdays and Sundays, of\r\ncourse, and on those two days he worked like a miner under a landslide.\r\nAugusta was not allowed to come on Saturday, though she was paid for\r\nthat day. All the while that he was working so fiercely by night, he was\r\nearning his living during the day; carrying full university work and\r\nfeeding himself out to hundreds of students in lectures and\r\nconsultations. But that was another life.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had managed for years to live two lives, both of them very\r\nintense. He would willingly have cut down on his university work, would\r\nwillingly have given his students chaff and sawdust--many instructors\r\nhad nothing else to give them and got on very well--but his misfortune\r\nwas that he loved youth--he was weak to it, it kindled him. If there was\r\none eager eye, one doubting, critical mind, one lively curiosity in a\r\nwhole lecture-room full of commonplace boys and girls, he was its\r\nservant. That ardour could command him. It hadn\'t worn out with years,\r\nthis responsiveness, any more than the magnetic currents wear out; it\r\nhad nothing to do with Time.\r\n\r\nBut he had burned his candle at both ends to some purpose--he had got\r\nwhat he wanted. By many petty economies of purse, he had managed to be\r\nextravagant with not a cent in the world but his professor\'s salary--he\r\ndidn\'t, of course, touch his wife\'s small income from her father. By\r\neliminations and combinations so many and subtle that it now made his\r\nhead ache to think of them, he had done full justice to his university\r\nlectures, and at the same time carried on an engrossing piece of\r\ncreative work. A man can do anything if he wishes to enough, St. Peter\r\nbelieved. Desire is creation, is the magical element in that process. If\r\nthere were an instrument by which to measure desire, one could foretell\r\nachievement. He had been able to measure it, roughly, just once, in his\r\nstudent Tom Outland,--and he had foretold.\r\n\r\nThere was one fine thing about this room that had been the scene of so\r\nmany defeats and triumphs. From the window he could see, far away, just\r\non the horizon, a long, blue, hazy smear--Lake Michigan, the inland sea\r\nof his childhood. Whenever he was tired and dull, when the white pages\r\nbefore him remained blank or were full of scratched-out sentences, then\r\nhe left his desk, took the train to a little station twelve miles away,\r\nand spent a day on the lake with his sail-boat; jumping out to swim,\r\nfloating on his back alongside, then climbing into his boat again.\r\n\r\nWhen he remembered his childhood, he remembered blue water. There were\r\ncertain human figures against it, of course; his practical,\r\nstrong-willed Methodist mother, his gentle, weaned-away Catholic father,\r\nthe old Kanuck grandfather, various brothers and sisters. But the great\r\nfact in life, the always possible escape from dullness, was the lake.\r\nThe sun rose out of it, the day began there; it was like an open door\r\nthat nobody could shut. The land and all its dreariness could never\r\nclose in on you. You had only to look at the lake, and you knew you\r\nwould soon be free. It was the first thing one saw in the morning,\r\nacross the rugged cow pasture studded with shaggy pines, and it ran\r\nthrough the days like the weather, not a thing thought about, but a part\r\nof consciousness itself. When the ice chunks came in of a winter\r\nmorning, crumbly and white, throwing off gold and rose-coloured\r\nreflections from a copper-coloured sun behind the grey clouds, he didn\'t\r\nobserve the detail or know what it was that made him happy; but now,\r\nforty years later, he could recall all its aspects perfectly. They had\r\nmade pictures in him when he was unwilling and unconscious, when his\r\neyes were merely open wide.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eight years old, his parents sold the lakeside farm and\r\ndragged him and his brothers and sisters out to the wheat lands of\r\ncentral Kansas. St. Peter nearly died of it. Never could he forget the\r\nfew moments on the train when that sudden, innocent blue across the sand\r\ndunes was dying for ever from his sight. It was like sinking for the\r\nthird time. No later anguish, and he had had his share, went so deep or\r\nseemed so final. Even in his long, happy student years with the\r\nThierault family in France, that stretch of blue water was the one thing\r\nhe was home-sick for. In the summer he used to go with the Thierault\r\nboys to Brittany or to the Languedoc coast; but his lake was itself, as\r\nthe Channel and the Mediterranean were themselves. "No," he used to tell\r\nthe boys, who were always asking him about _le Michigan_, "it is\r\naltogether different. It is a sea, and yet it is not salt. It is blue,\r\nbut quite another blue. Yes, there are clouds and mists and sea-gulls,\r\nbut--I don\'t know, _il est toujours plus na\xc3\xaff._"\r\n\r\nAfterward, when St. Peter was looking for a professorship, because he\r\nwas very much in love and must marry at once, out of the several\r\npositions offered him he took the one at Hamilton, not because it was\r\nthe best, but because it seemed to him that any place near the lake was\r\na place where one could live. The sight of it from his study window\r\nthese many years had been of more assistance than all the convenient\r\nthings he had done without would have been.\r\n\r\nJust in that corner, under Augusta\'s archaic "forms," he had always\r\nmeant to put the filing-cabinets he had never spared the time or money\r\nto buy. They would have held all his notes and pamphlets, and the\r\nspasmodic rough drafts of passages far ahead. But he had never got them,\r\nand now he really didn\'t need them; it would be like locking the stable\r\nafter the horse is stolen. For the horse was gone--that was the thing he\r\nwas feeling most just now. In spite of all he\'d neglected, he had\r\ncompleted his _Spanish Adventurers_ in eight volumes--without\r\nfiling-cabinets or money or a decent study or a decent stove--and\r\nwithout encouragement, Heaven knew! For all the interest the first three\r\nvolumes awoke in the world, he might as well have dropped them into Lake\r\nMichigan. They had been timidly reviewed by other professors of history,\r\nin technical and educational journals. Nobody saw that he was trying to\r\ndo something quite different--they merely thought he was trying to do\r\nthe usual thing, and had not succeeded very well. They recommended to\r\nhim the more even and genial style of John Fiske.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter hadn\'t, he could honestly say, cared a whoop--not in those\r\ngolden days. When the whole plan of his narrative was coming clearer and\r\nclearer all the time, when he could feel his hand growing easier with\r\nhis material, when all the foolish conventions about that kind of\r\nwriting were falling away and his relation with his work was becoming\r\nevery day more simple, natural, and happy,--he cared as little as the\r\nSpanish Adventurers themselves what Professor So-and-So thought about\r\nthem. With the fourth volume he began to be aware that a few young men,\r\nscattered about the United States and England, were intensely interested\r\nin his experiment. With the fifth and sixth, they began to express their\r\ninterest in lectures and in print. The two last volumes brought him a\r\ncertain international reputation and what were called rewards--among\r\nthem, the Oxford prize for history, with its five thousand pounds, which\r\nhad built him the new house into which he did not want to move.\r\n\r\n"Godfrey," his wife had gravely said one day, when she detected an\r\nironical turn in some remark he made about the new house, "is there\r\nsomething you would rather have done with that money than to have built\r\na house with it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, my dear, nothing. If with that cheque I could have bought back\r\nthe fun I had writing my history, you\'d never have got your house. But\r\none couldn\'t get that for twenty thousand dollars. The great pleasures\r\ndon\'t come so cheap. There is nothing else, thank you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening St. Peter was in the new house, dressing for dinner. His\r\ntwo daughters and their husbands were dining with them, also an English\r\nvisitor. Mrs. St. Peter heard the shower going as she passed his door.\r\nShe entered his room and waited until he came out in his bath-robe,\r\nrubbing his wet, ink-black hair with a towel.\r\n\r\n"Surely you\'ll admit that you like having your own bath," she said,\r\nlooking past him into the glittering white cubicle, flooded with\r\nelectric light, which he had just quitted.\r\n\r\n"Whoever said I didn\'t? But more than anything else, I like my closets.\r\nI like having room for all my clothes, without hanging one coat on top\r\nof another, and not having to get down on my marrow-bones and fumble in\r\ndark corners to find my shoes."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do. And it\'s much more dignified, at your age, to have a\r\nroom of your own."\r\n\r\n"It\'s convenient, certainly, though I hope I\'m not so old as to be\r\npersonally repulsive?" He glanced into the mirror and straightened his\r\nshoulders as if he were trying on a coat.\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter laughed,--a pleasant, easy laugh with genuine amusement\r\nin it. "No, you are very handsome, my dear, especially in your\r\nbath-robe. You grow better-looking and more intolerant all the time."\r\n\r\n"Intolerant?" He put down his shoe and looked up at her. The thing that\r\nstuck in his mind constantly was that she was growing more and more\r\nintolerant, about everything except her sons-in-law; that she would\r\nprobably continue to do so, and that he must school himself to bear it.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s a natural process," she went on, "but you ought to try,\r\ntry seriously, I mean, to curb it where it affects the happiness of your\r\ndaughters. You are too severe with Scott and Louie. All young men have\r\nfoolish vanities--you had plenty."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter sat with his elbows on his knees, leaning forward and playing\r\nabsently with the tassels of his bath-robe. "Why, Lillian, I have\r\nexercised the virtue of patience with those two young men more than with\r\nall the thousands of young ruffians who have gone through my\r\nclass-rooms. My forbearance is overstrained, it\'s gone flat. That\'s\r\nwhat\'s the matter with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Godfrey, how can you be such a poor judge of your own behaviour?\r\nBut we won\'t argue about it now. You\'ll put on your dinner coat? And do\r\ntry to be sympathetic and agreeable to-night."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Mr. and Mrs. Scott McGregor and Mr. and Mrs. Louie\r\nMarsellus arrived, and soon after them the English scholar, Sir Edgar\r\nSpilling, so anxious to do the usual thing in America that he wore a\r\nmorning street suit. He was a gaunt, rugged, large-boned man of fifty,\r\nwith long legs and arms, a pear-shaped face, and a drooping, pre-war\r\nmoustache. His specialty was Spanish history, and he had come all the\r\nway to Hamilton, from his cousin\'s place in Saskatchewan, to enquire\r\nabout some of Doctor St. Peter\'s "sources."\r\n\r\nIntroductions over, it was the Professor\'s son-in-law, Louie Marsellus,\r\nwho took Sir Edgar in hand. He remembered having met in China a Walter\r\nSpilling, who was, it turned out, a brother of Sir Edgar. Marsellus had\r\nalso a brother there, engaged in the silk trade. They exchanged opinions\r\non conditions in the Orient, while young McGregor put on his horn-rimmed\r\nspectacles and roamed restlessly up and down the library. The two\r\ndaughters sat near their mother, listening to the talk about China.\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter was very fair, pink and gold,--a pale gold, now that she\r\nwas becoming a little grey. The tints of her face and hair and lashes\r\nwere so soft that one did not realize, on first meeting her, how very\r\ndefinitely and decidedly her features were cut, under the smiling\r\ninfusion of colour. When she was annoyed or tired, the lines became\r\nsevere. Rosamond, the elder daughter, resembled her mother in feature,\r\nthough her face was heavier. Her colouring was altogether different;\r\ndusky black hair, deep dark eyes, a soft white skin with rich brunette\r\nred in her cheeks and lips. Nearly everyone considered Rosamond\r\nbrilliantly beautiful. Her father, though he was very proud of her,\r\ndemurred from the general opinion. He thought her too tall, with a\r\nrather awkward carriage. She stooped a trifle, and was wide in the hips\r\nand shoulders. She had, he sometimes remarked to her mother, exactly the\r\nwide femur and flat shoulder-blade of his old slab-sided Kanuck\r\ngrandfather. For a tree-hewer they were an asset. But St. Peter was very\r\ncritical. Most people saw only Rosamond\'s smooth black head and white\r\nthroat, and the red of her curved lips that was like the duskiness of\r\ndark, heavy-scented roses.\r\n\r\nKathleen, the younger daughter, looked even younger than she was--had\r\nthe slender, undeveloped figure then very much in vogue. She was pale,\r\nwith light hazel eyes, and her hair was hazel-coloured with distinctly\r\ngreen glints in it. To her father there was something very charming in\r\nthe curious shadows her wide cheekbones cast over her cheeks, and in the\r\nspirited tilt of her head. Her figure in profile, he used to tell her,\r\nlooked just like an interrogation point.\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter frankly liked having a son-in-law who could tot up\r\nacquaintances with Sir Edgar from the Soudan to Alaska. Scott, she saw,\r\nwas going to be sulky because Sir Edgar and Marsellus were talking about\r\nthings beyond his little circle of interests. She made no effort to draw\r\nhim into the conversation, but let him prowl like a restless leopard\r\namong the books. The Professor was amiable, but quiet. When the second\r\nmaid came to the door and signalled that dinner was ready--dinner was\r\nsignalled, not announced--Mrs. St. Peter took Sir Edgar and guided him\r\nto his seat at her right, while the others found their usual places.\r\nAfter they had finished the soup, she had some difficulty in summoning\r\nthe little maid to take away the plates, and explained to her guest that\r\nthe electric bell, under the table, wasn\'t connected as yet--they had\r\nbeen in the new house less than a week, and the trials of building were\r\nnot over.\r\n\r\n"Oh? Then if I had happened along a fortnight ago I shouldn\'t have found\r\nyou here? But it must be very interesting, building your own house and\r\narranging it as you like," he responded.\r\n\r\nMarsellus, silenced during the soup, came in with a warm smile and a\r\nslight shrug of the shoulders. "Building is the word with us, Sir Edgar,\r\nmy--oh, isn\'t it! My wife and I are in the throes of it. We are building\r\na country house, rather an ambitious affair, out on the wooded shores of\r\nLake Michigan. Perhaps you would like to run out in my car and see it?\r\nWhat are your engagements for to-morrow? I can take you out in half an\r\nhour, and we can lunch at the Country Club. We have a magnificent site;\r\nprimeval forest behind us and the lake in front, with our own beach--my\r\nfather-in-law, you must know, is a formidable swimmer. We\'ve been\r\nsingularly fortunate in our architect,--a young Norwegian, trained in\r\nParis. He\'s doing us a Norwegian manor house, very harmonious with its\r\nsetting, just the right thing for rugged pine woods and high headlands."\r\n\r\nSir Edgar seemed most willing to make this excursion, and allowed\r\nMarsellus to fix an hour, greatly to the surprise of McGregor, whose\r\nlook at his wife implied that he entertained serious doubts whether this\r\nbaronet with walrus moustaches amounted to much after all.\r\n\r\nThe engagement made, Louie turned to Mrs. St. Peter. "And won\'t you come\r\ntoo, Dearest? You haven\'t been out since we got our wonderful\r\nwrought-iron door fittings from Chicago. We found just the right sort of\r\nhinge and latch, Sir Edgar, and had all the others copied from it. None\r\nof your Colonial glass knobs for us!"\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter sighed. Scott and Kathleen had just glass-knobbed their\r\nnew bungalow throughout, yet she knew Louie didn\'t mean to hurt their\r\nfeelings--it was his heedless enthusiasm that made him often say\r\nuntactful things.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been extremely fortunate in getting all the little things right,"\r\nLouie was gladly confiding to Sir Edgar. "There\'s really not a flaw in\r\nthe conception. I can say that, because I\'m a mere onlooker; the whole\r\nthing\'s been done by the Norwegian and my wife and Mrs. St. Peter. And,"\r\nhe put his hand down affectionately upon Mrs. St. Peter\'s bare arm, "and\r\nwe\'ve named our place! I\'ve already ordered the house stationery. No,\r\nRosamond, I won\'t keep our little secret any longer. It will please your\r\nfather, as well as your mother. We call our place \'Outland,\' Sir Edgar."\r\n\r\nHe dropped the announcement and drew back. His mother-in-law rose to\r\nit--Spilling could scarcely be expected to understand.\r\n\r\n"How splendid, Louie! A real inspiration."\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it? I knew that would go to your hearts." The Professor had\r\nexpressed his emotion only by lifting his heavy, sharply uptwisted\r\neyebrows. "Let me explain, Sir Edgar," Marsellus went on eagerly. "We\r\nhave named our place for Tom Outland, a brilliant young American\r\nscientist and inventor, who was killed in Flanders, fighting with the\r\nForeign Legion, the second year of the war, when he was barely thirty\r\nyears of age. Before he dashed off to the front, this youngster had\r\ndiscovered the principle of the Outland vacuum, worked out the\r\nconstruction of the Outland engine that is revolutionizing aviation. He\r\nnot only invented it, but, curiously enough for such a hot-headed\r\nfellow, had taken pains to protect it by patent. He had no time to\r\ncommunicate his discovery or to commercialize it--simply bolted to the\r\nfront and left the most important discovery of his time to take care of\r\nitself."\r\n\r\nSir Edgar, fork arrested, looked a trifle dazed. "Am I to understand\r\nthat you are referring to the inventor of the Outland engine?"\r\n\r\nLouie was delighted. "Exactly that! Of course you would know all about\r\nit. My wife was young Outland\'s fianc\xc3\xa9e--is virtually his widow. Before\r\nhe went to France he made a will in her favour; he had no living\r\nrelatives, indeed. Toward the close of the war we began to sense the\r\nimportance of what Outland had been doing in his laboratory--I am an\r\nelectrical engineer by profession. We called in the assistance of\r\nexperts and got the idea over from the laboratory to the trade. The\r\nmonetary returns have been and are, of course, large."\r\n\r\nWhile Louie paused long enough to have some intercourse with the roast\r\nbefore it was taken away. Sir Edgar remarked that he himself had been in\r\nthe Air Service during the war, in the construction department, and that\r\nit was most extraordinary to come thus by chance upon the genesis of the\r\nOutland engine.\r\n\r\n"You see," Louie told him, "Outland got nothing out of it but death and\r\nglory. Naturally, we feel terribly indebted. We feel it\'s our first duty\r\nin life to use that money as he would have wished--we\'ve endowed\r\nscholarships in his own university here, and that sort of thing. But our\r\nhouse we want to have as a sort of memorial to him. We are going to\r\ntransfer his laboratory there, if the university will permit,--all the\r\napparatus he worked with. We have a room for his library and pictures.\r\nWhen his brother scientists come to Hamilton to look him up, to get\r\ninformation about him, as they are doing now already, at Outland they\r\nwill find his books and instruments, all the sources of his\r\ninspiration."\r\n\r\n"Even Rosamond," murmured McGregor, his eyes upon his cool green salad.\r\nHe was struggling with a desire to shout to the Britisher that Marsellus\r\nhad never so much as seen Tom Outland, while he, McGregor, had been his\r\nclassmate and friend.\r\n\r\nSir Edgar was as much interested as he was mystified. He had come here\r\nto talk about manuscripts shut up in certain mouldering monasteries in\r\nSpain, but he had almost forgotten them in the turn the conversation had\r\ntaken. He was genuinely interested in aviation and all its problems. He\r\nasked few questions, and his comments were almost entirely limited to\r\nthe single exclamation, "Oh!" But this, from his lips, could mean a\r\ngreat many things; indifference, sharp interrogation, sympathetic\r\ninterest, the nervousness of a modest man on hearing disclosures of a\r\ndelicately personal nature. McGregor, before the others had finished\r\ndessert, drew a big cigar from his pocket and lit it at one of the table\r\ncandles, as the horridest thing he could think of to do.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the dining-room, St. Peter, who had scarcely spoken\r\nduring dinner, took Sir Edgar\'s arm and said to his wife: "If you will\r\nexcuse us, my dear, we have some technical matters to discuss." Leading\r\nhis guest into the library, he shut the door.\r\n\r\nMarsellus looked distinctly disappointed. He stood gazing wistfully\r\nafter them, like a little boy told to go to bed. Louie\'s eyes were\r\nvividly blue, like hot sapphires, but the rest of his face had little\r\ncolour--he was a rather mackerel-tinted man. Only his eyes, and his\r\nquick, impetuous movements, gave out the zest for life with which he was\r\nalways bubbling. There was nothing Semitic about his countenance except\r\nhis nose--that took the lead. It was not at all an unpleasing feature,\r\nbut it grew out of his face with masterful strength, well-rooted, like a\r\nvigorous oak-tree growing out of a hill-side.\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter, always concerned for Louie, asked him to come and look\r\nat the new rug in her bedroom. This revived him; he took her arm, and\r\nthey went upstairs together.\r\n\r\nMcGregor was left with the two sisters. "Outland, outlandish!" he\r\nmuttered, while he fumbled about for an ash-tray. Rosamond pretended not\r\nto hear him, but the dusky red on her cheeks crept a little farther\r\ntoward her ears.\r\n\r\n"Remember, we are leaving early, Scott," said Kathleen. "You have to\r\nfinish your editorial to-night."\r\n\r\n"Surely you don\'t make him work at night, too?" Rosamond asked. "Doesn\'t\r\nhe have to rest his brain sometimes? Humour is always better if it\'s\r\nspontaneous."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s the trouble with me," Scott assured her. "Unless I keep my\r\nnose to the grindstone, I\'m too damned spontaneous and tell the truth,\r\nand the public won\'t stand for it. It\'s not an editorial I have to\r\nfinish, it\'s the daily prose poem I do for the syndicate, for which I\r\nget twenty-five beans. This is the motif:\r\n\r\n\r\n\'When your pocket is under-moneyed and your fancy is over-girled, you\'ll\r\nhave to admit while you\'re cursing it, it\'s a mighty darned good old\r\nworld.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nBang, bang!"\r\n\r\nHe threw his cigar-end savagely into the fireplace. He knew that\r\nRosamond detested his editorials and his jingles. She had fastidious\r\ntaste in literature, like her mother--though he didn\'t think she had\r\nhalf the general intelligence of his wife. She also, now that she was\r\nTom Outland\'s heir, detested to hear sums of money mentioned, especially\r\nsmall sums.\r\n\r\nAfter the good-nights were said, and they were outside the front door,\r\nMcGregor seized his wife\'s elbow and rushed her down the walk to the\r\ngate where his Ford was parked, breaking out in her ear as they ran:\r\n"Now what the hell is a virtual widow? Does he mean a virtuous widow, or\r\nthe reverseous? Bang, bang!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter awoke the next morning with the wish that he could be\r\ntransported on his mattress from the new house to the old. But it was\r\nSunday, and on that day his wife always breakfasted with him. There was\r\nno way out; they would meet at compt.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the dining-room Lillian was already at the table, behind\r\nthe percolator. "Good morning, Godfrey. I hope you had a good night."\r\nHer tone just faintly implied that he hadn\'t deserved one.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. And you?"\r\n\r\n"I had a good conscience." She smiled ruefully at him. "How can you let\r\nyourself be ungracious in your own house?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! And I went to sleep happy in the belief that I hadn\'t said\r\nanything amiss the whole evening."\r\n\r\n"Nor anything aright, that I heard. Your disapproving silence can kill\r\nthe life of any company."\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t seem to, last night. You\'re entirely wrong about Marsellus.\r\nHe doesn\'t notice."\r\n\r\n"He\'s too polite to _take_ notice, but he feels it. He\'s very sensitive,\r\nunder a well-schooled impersonal manner."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter laughed. "Nonsense, Lillian! If he were, he couldn\'t pick up a\r\ndinner party and walk off with it, as he almost always does. I don\'t\r\nmind when it\'s our dinner, but I hate seeing him do it in other people\'s\r\nhouses."\r\n\r\n"Be fair, Godfrey. You know that if you\'d once begun to talk about your\r\nwork in Spain, Louie would have followed it up with enthusiasm. Nobody\r\nis prouder of you than he."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I kept quiet. Support can be too able--certainly too\r\nfluent."\r\n\r\n"There you are; the dog in the manger! You won\'t let him discuss your\r\naffairs, and you are annoyed when he talks about his own."\r\n\r\n"I admit I can\'t bear it when he talks about Outland as his affair. (I\r\nmean Tom, of course, not their confounded place!) This calling it after\r\nhim passes my comprehension. And Rosamond\'s standing for it! It\'s brazen\r\nimpudence."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter frowned pensively. "I knew you wouldn\'t like it, but they\r\nwere so pleased about it, and their motives are so generous----"\r\n\r\n"Hang it, Outland doesn\'t need their generosity! They\'ve got everything\r\nhe ought to have had, and the least they can do is to be quiet about it,\r\nand not convert his very bones into a personal asset. It all comes down\r\nto this, my dear: one likes the florid style, or one doesn\'t. You\r\nyourself used not to like it. And will you give me some more coffee,\r\nplease?"\r\n\r\nShe refilled his cup and handed it across the table. "Nice hands," he\r\nmurmured, looking critically at them as he took it, "always such nice\r\nhands."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I dislike floridity when it is beaten up to cover the lack\r\nof something, to take the place of something. I never disliked it when\r\nit came from exuberance. Then it isn\'t floridness, it\'s merely strong\r\ncolour."\r\n\r\n"Very well; some people don\'t care for strong colour. It fatigues them."\r\nHe folded his napkin. "Now I must be off to my desk."\r\n\r\n"Not quite yet. You never have time to talk to me. Just when did it\r\nbegin, Godfrey, in the history of manners--that convention that if a man\r\nwere pleased with his wife or his house or his success, he shouldn\'t say\r\nso, frankly?" Mrs. St. Peter spoke thoughtfully, as if she had\r\nconsidered this matter before.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it goes back a long way. I rather think it began in the Age of\r\nChivalry--King Arthur\'s knights. Whoever it was lived in that time, some\r\nfeeling grew up that a man should do fine deeds and not speak of them,\r\nand that he shouldn\'t speak the name of his lady, but sing of her as a\r\nPhyllis or a Nicolette. It\'s a nice idea, reserve about one\'s deepest\r\nfeelings: keeps them fresh."\r\n\r\n"The Oriental peoples didn\'t have an Age of Chivalry. They didn\'t need\r\none," Lillian observed. "And this reserve--it becomes in itself\r\nostentatious, a vain-glorious vanity."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, all is vanity! I don\'t dispute that. Now I must really go,\r\nand I wish I could play the game as well as you do. I have no enthusiasm\r\nfor being a father-in-law. It\'s you who keep the ball rolling. I fully\r\nappreciate that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," mused his wife, as he rose, "it\'s because you didn\'t get the\r\nson-in-law you wanted. And yet he was highly coloured, too."\r\n\r\nThe Professor made no reply to this. Lillian had been fiercely jealous\r\nof Tom Outland. As he left the house, he was reflecting that people who\r\nare intensely in love when they marry, and who go on being in love,\r\nalways meet with something which suddenly or gradually makes a\r\ndifference. Sometimes it is the children, or the grubbiness of being\r\npoor, sometimes a second infatuation. In their own case it had been,\r\ncuriously enough, his pupil, Tom Outland.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had met his wife in Paris, when he was but twenty-four, and\r\nstudying for his doctorate. She too was studying there. French people\r\nthought her an English girl because of her gold hair and fair\r\ncomplexion. With her really radiant charm, she had a very interesting\r\nmind--but it was quite wrong to call it mind, the connotation was false.\r\nWhat she had was a richly endowed nature that responded strongly to life\r\nand art, and very vehement likes and dislikes which were often quite out\r\nof all proportion to the trivial object or person that aroused them.\r\nBefore his marriage, and for years afterward, Lillian\'s prejudices, her\r\ndivinations about people and art (always instinctive and unexplained,\r\nbut nearly always right), were the most interesting things in St.\r\nPeter\'s life. When he accepted almost the first position offered him, in\r\norder to marry at once, and came to take the chair of European history\r\nat Hamilton, he was thrown upon his wife for mental companionship. Most\r\nof his colleagues were much older than he, but they were not his equals\r\neither in scholarship or in experience of the world. The only other man\r\nin the faculty who was carrying on important research work was Doctor\r\nCrane, the professor of physics. St. Peter saw a good deal of him,\r\nthough outside his specialty he was uninteresting--a narrow-minded man,\r\nand painfully unattractive. Years ago Crane had begun to suffer from a\r\nmalady which in time proved incurable, and which now sent him up for an\r\noperation periodically. St. Peter had had no friend in Hamilton of whom\r\nLillian could possibly be jealous until Tom Outland came along, so well\r\nfitted by nature and early environment to help him with his work on the\r\nSpanish Adventurers.\r\n\r\nWhen he had almost reached his old house and his study, the Professor\r\nremembered that he really must have an understanding with his landlord,\r\nor the place would be rented over his head. He turned and went down into\r\nanother part of the city, by the car shops, where only workmen lived,\r\nand found his landlord\'s little toy house, set on a hill-side, over a\r\nbasement faced up with red brick and covered with hop vines. Old\r\nAppelhoff was sitting on a bench before his door, making a broom.\r\nRaising broom corn was one of his economies. Beside him was his\r\ndachshund bitch, Minna.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter explained that he wanted to stay on in the empty house, and\r\nwould pay the full rent each month. So irregular a project annoyed\r\nAppelhoff. "I like fine to oblige you, Professor, but dey is several\r\nparties looking at de house already, an\' I don\'t like to lose a year\'s\r\nrent for maybe a few months."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right, Fred. I\'ll take it for the year, to simplify\r\nmatters. I want to finish my new book before I move."\r\n\r\nFred still looked uneasy. "I better see de insurance man, eh? It says\r\nfor purposes of domestic dwelling."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t object. Let\'s have a look at your garden. What a fine crop of\r\napples and sickle pears you have!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like dem trees what don\'t bear not\'ing," said the old man with\r\nsly humour, remembering the Professor\'s glistening, barren shrubs and\r\nthe good ground wasted behind his stucco wall.\r\n\r\n"How about your linden-trees?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dem flowers is awful good for de headache!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look as if you were subject to it, Fred."\r\n\r\n"Not me, but my woman always had."\r\n\r\n"Pretty lonesome without her, Applehoff?"\r\n\r\n"I miss her, Professor, but I ain\'t just lonesome." The old man rubbed\r\nhis bristly chin. "My Minna here is most like a person, and den I got so\r\nmany t\'ings to t\'ink about."\r\n\r\n"Have you? Pleasant things, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Well, all kinds. When I was young, in de old country, I had it hard to\r\ngit my wife at all, an\' I never had time to t\'ink. When I come to dis\r\ncountry I had to work so terrible hard on dat farm to make crops an\' pay\r\ndebts, dat I was like a horse. Now I have it easy, an\' I take time to\r\nt\'ink about all dem t\'ings."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter laughed. "We all come to it, Applehoff. That\'s one thing I\'m\r\nrenting your house for, to have room to think. Good morning."\r\n\r\nCrossing the public park, on his way back to the old house, he espied\r\nhis professional rival and enemy, Professor Horace Langtry, taking a\r\nSunday morning stroll--very well got up in English clothes he had\r\nbrought back from his customary summer in London, with a bowler hat of\r\nunusual block and a horn-handled walking-stick. In twenty years the two\r\nmen had scarcely had speech with each other beyond a stiff "good\r\nmorning." When Langtry first came to the university he looked hardly\r\nmore than a boy, with curly brown hair and such a fresh complexion that\r\nthe students called him Lily Langtry. His round pink cheeks and round\r\neyes and round chin made him look rather like a baby grown big. All\r\nthese years had made little difference, except that his curls were now\r\nquite grey, his rosy cheeks even rosier, and his mouth dropped a little\r\nat the corners, so that he looked like a baby suddenly grown old and\r\nrather cross about it.\r\n\r\nSeeing St. Peter, the younger man turned abruptly into a side alley, but\r\nthe Professor overtook him.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Langtry. These elms are becoming real trees at last.\r\nThey\'ve changed a good deal since we first came here."\r\n\r\nDoctor Langtry moved his rosy chin sidewise over his high double collar.\r\n"Good morning, Doctor St. Peter. I really don\'t remember much about the\r\ntrees. They seem to be doing well now."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter stepped abreast of him. "There have been many changes,\r\nLangtry, and not all of them are good. Don\'t you notice a great\r\ndifference in the student body as a whole, in the new crop that comes\r\nalong every year now--how different they are from the ones of our early\r\nyears here?"\r\n\r\nThe smooth chin turned again, and the other professor of European\r\nhistory blinked. "In just what respect?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, in the all-embracing respect of quality! We have hosts of students,\r\nbut they\'re a common sort."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. I can\'t say I\'ve noticed it." The air between the two\r\ncolleagues was not thawing out any. A church-bell rang. Langtry started\r\nhopefully. "You must excuse me, Doctor St. Peter, I am on my way to\r\nservice."\r\n\r\nThe Professor gave it up with a shrug. "All right, all right, Langtry,\r\nas you will. _Quelle folie!_"\r\n\r\nLangtry half turned back, hesitated on the ball of his suddenly speeding\r\nfoot, and said with faultless politeness: "I beg your pardon?"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter waved his hand with a gesture of negation, and detained the\r\nchurch-goer no longer. He sauntered along slackly through the hot\r\nSeptember sunshine, wondering why Langtry didn\'t see the absurdity of\r\ntheir long grudge. They had always been directly opposed in matters of\r\nuniversity policy, until it had almost become a part of their\r\nprofessional duties to outwit and cramp each other.\r\n\r\nWhen young Langtry first came there, his specialty was supposed to be\r\nAmerican history. His uncle was president of the board of regents, and\r\nvery influential in State politics; the institution had to look to him,\r\nindeed, to get its financial appropriations passed by the Legislature.\r\nLangtry was a Tory in his point of view, and was considered very English\r\nin his tone and manner. His lectures were dull, and the students didn\'t\r\nlike him. Every inducement was offered to make his courses popular.\r\nLiberal credits were given for collateral reading. A student could read\r\nalmost anything that had ever been written in the United States and get\r\ncredit for it in American history. He could charge up the time spent in\r\nperusing "The Scarlet Letter" to Colonial history, and "Tom Sawyer" to\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, it was said. St. Peter openly criticized these\r\nlax methods, both to the faculty and to the regents. Naturally, "Madame\r\nLangtry" paid him out. During the Professor\'s second Sabbatical year in\r\nSpain, Horace and his uncle together very nearly got his department away\r\nfrom him. They worked so quietly that it was only at the eleventh hour\r\nthat St. Peter\'s old students throughout the State got wind of what was\r\ngoing on, dropped their various businesses and professions for a few\r\ndays, and came up to the capital in dozens and saved his place for him.\r\nThe opposition had been so formidable that when it came time for his\r\nthird year away, the Professor had not dared ask for it, but had taken\r\nan extension of his summer vacation instead. The fact that he was\r\ncarrying on another line of work than his lectures, and was publishing\r\nbooks that weren\'t strictly text-books, had been used against him by\r\nLangtry\'s uncle.\r\n\r\nAs Langtry felt that the unpopularity of his course was due to his\r\nsubject, a new chair was created for him. There couldn\'t be two heads in\r\nEuropean history, so the board of regents made for him a chair of\r\nRenaissance history, or, as St. Peter said, a Renaissance chair of\r\nhistory. Of late years, for reasons that had not much to do with his\r\nlectures, Langtry had prospered better. To the new generations of\r\ncountry and village boys now pouring into the university in such large\r\nnumbers, Langtry had become, in a curious way, an instructor in\r\nmanners,--what is called an "influence." To the football-playing farmer\r\nboy who had a good allowance but didn\'t know how to dress or what to\r\nsay, Langtry looked like a short cut. He had several times taken parties\r\nof undergraduates to London for the summer, and they had come back\r\nwonderfully brushed up. He introduced a very popular fraternity into the\r\nuniversity, and its members looked after his interests, as did its\r\naffiliated sorority. His standing on the faculty was now quite as good\r\nas St. Peter\'s own, and the Professor wondered what Langtry still had to\r\nbe sore about.\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of keeping up the feud? They had both come there young\r\nmen, fighting for their places and their lives; now they were not very\r\nyoung any more; they would neither of them, probably, ever hold a better\r\nposition. Couldn\'t Langtry see it was a draw, that they had both been\r\nbeaten?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday afternoon St. Peter mounted to his study and lay down on the\r\nbox-couch, tired out with his day at the university. The first few weeks\r\nof the year were very fatiguing for him; there were so many exhausting\r\nthings besides his lectures and all the new students; long faculty\r\nmeetings in which almost no one was ever frank, and always the old fight\r\nto keep up the standard of scholarship, to prevent the younger\r\nprofessors, who had a sharp eye to their own interests, from farming the\r\nwhole institution out to athletics, and to the agricultural and\r\ncommercial schools favoured and fostered by the State Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe September heat, too, was hard on him. He wanted to be out at the\r\nlake every day--it was never so fine as in late September. He was lying\r\nwith closed eyes, resting his mind on the picture of intense autumn-blue\r\nwater, when he heard a tap at the door and his daughter Rosamond\r\nentered, very handsome in a silk suit of a vivid shade of lilac,\r\nadmirably suited to her complexion and showing that in the colour of her\r\ncheeks there was actually a tone of warm lavender. In that low room she\r\nseemed very tall indeed, a little out of drawing, as, to her father\'s\r\neye, she so often did. Usually, however, people were aware only of her\r\nrich complexion, her curving, unresisting mouth and mysterious eyes. Tom\r\nOutland had seen nothing else, and he was a young man who saw a great\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n"Am I interrupting something important, Papa?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at all, my dear. Sit down."\r\n\r\nOn his writing-table she caught a glimpse of pages in a handwriting not\r\nhis--a script she knew very well.\r\n\r\n"Not much choice of chairs, is there?" she smiled. "Papa, I don\'t like\r\nto have you working in a place like this. It\'s not fitting."\r\n\r\n"Much easier than to break in a new room, Rosie. A work-room should be\r\nlike an old shoe; no matter how shabby, it\'s better than a new one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s really what I came to see you about." Rosamond traced the edge\r\nof a hole in the matting with the tip of her lilac sunshade. "Won\'t you\r\nlet me build you a little study in the back yard of the new house? I\r\nhave such good ideas for it, and you would have no bother about it at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, Rosamond. It\'s most awfully nice of you to think of it.\r\nBut keep it just an idea--it\'s better so. Lots of things are. For the\r\npresent I\'ll plod on here. It\'s absurd, but it suits me. Habit is such a\r\nbig part of work."\r\n\r\n"With Augusta\'s old things lying about, and those dusty old forms? Why\r\ndidn\'t she at least get those out of your way?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they have a right here, by long tenure. It\'s their room, too. I\r\ndon\'t want to come upon them lying in some dump-heap on the road to the\r\nlake. They remind me of the times when you were little girls, and your\r\nfirst party frocks used to hang on them at night, when I worked."\r\n\r\nRosamond smiled, unconvinced. "Papa, don\'t joke with me. I\'ve come to\r\ntalk about something serious, and it\'s very difficult. You know I\'m a\r\nlittle afraid of you." She dropped her shadowy, bewitching eyes.\r\n\r\n"Afraid of me? Never!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I am when you\'re sarcastic. You musn\'t be to-day, please.\r\nLouie and I have often talked this over. We feel strongly about it. He\'s\r\noften been on the point of blurting out with it, but I\'ve curbed him.\r\nYou don\'t always approve of Louie and me. Of course it was only Louie\'s\r\nenergy and technical knowledge that ever made Tom\'s discovery succeed\r\ncommercially, but we don\'t feel that we ought to have all the returns\r\nfrom it. We think you ought to let us settle an income on you, so that\r\nyou could give up your university work and devote all your time to\r\nwriting and research. That is what Tom would have wanted."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter rose quickly, with the light, supple spring he had when he was\r\nvery nervous, crossed to the window, wide on its hook, and half closed\r\nit. "My dear daughter," he said decisively, when he had turned round to\r\nher, "I couldn\'t possibly take any of Outland\'s money."\r\n\r\n"But why not? You were the best friend he had in the world, he owed more\r\nto you than to anyone else, and he hated having you hampered by\r\nteaching. He admired your mind, and nothing would have pleased him more\r\nthan helping you to do the work you do better than anyone else. If he\r\nwere alive, that would be one of the first things he would use this\r\nmoney for."\r\n\r\n"But he is not alive, and there was no word about me in his will, and so\r\nthere is nothing to build your pretty theory upon. It\'s wonderfully nice\r\nof you and Louie, and I\'m very pleased, you know."\r\n\r\n"But Tom was so impractical, Father. He never thought it would mean more\r\nthan a liberal dress allowance for me, if he thought at all. I don\'t\r\nknow--he never spoke to me about it."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter smiled quizzically. "I\'m not so sure about his\r\nimpracticalness. When he was working on that gas, he once remarked to me\r\nthat there might be a fortune in it. To be sure, he didn\'t wait to find\r\nout whether there was a fortune, but that had to do with quite another\r\nside of him. Yes, I think he knew his idea would make money and he\r\nwanted you to have it, with him or without him."\r\n\r\nThe young woman\'s face grew troubled. "Even if I married?"\r\n\r\n"He wanted you to have whatever would make you happy."\r\n\r\nShe sighed luxuriously. "Louie has done that. The only thing that\r\ntroubles me is, I feel you ought to have some of this money, that he\r\nwould wish it. He was so full of gratitude, felt that he owed you so\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\nHer father again rose, with that guarded, nervous movement. "Once and\r\nfor all, Rosamond, understand that he owed me no more than I owed him.\r\nNothing hurts me so much as to have any member of my family talk as if\r\nwe had done something fine for that young man, brought him out, produced\r\nhim. In a lifetime of teaching, I\'ve encountered just one remarkable\r\nmind; but for that, I\'d consider my good years largely wasted. And there\r\ncan be no question of money between me and Tom Outland. I can\'t explain\r\njust how I feel about it, but it would somehow damage my recollections\r\nof him, would make that episode in my life commonplace like everything\r\nelse. And that would be a great loss to me. I\'m purely selfish in\r\nrefusing your offer; my friendship with Outland is the one thing I will\r\nnot have translated into the vulgar tongue."\r\n\r\nHis daughter looked perplexed and a little resentful.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," she murmured, "I think you feel I oughtn\'t to have taken\r\nit, either."\r\n\r\n"You had no choice. For you it was settled by his own hand. Your bond\r\nwith him was social, and it follows the laws of society, and they are\r\nbased on property. Mine wasn\'t, and there was no material clause in it.\r\nHe empowered you to carry out all his wishes, and I realize that you\r\nhave responsibilities--but none toward me. There is Rodney Blake, of\r\ncourse, if he should ever turn up. You keep up some search for him?"\r\n\r\n"Louie attends to it. He has investigated and rejected several\r\nimpostors."\r\n\r\n"Then, of course, there are other friends of Tom\'s. The Cranes, for\r\ninstance?"\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s face grew hard. "I won\'t bother you about the Cranes, Papa.\r\nWe will attend to them. Mrs. Crane is a common creature, and she is\r\nadvised by that dreadful shyster brother of hers, Homer Bright. You know\r\nwhat he is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! He was about the greatest bluffer I ever had in my classes."\r\n\r\nRosamond had risen to go. "I want you to be awfully happy, daughter,"\r\nSt. Peter went on, "and Tom did. It\'s only young people like you and\r\nLouie who can get any fun out of money. And there is enough to cover the\r\nfine, the almost imaginary obligations. You won\'t be sorry if you are\r\ngenerous with people like the Cranes."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Papa. I shan\'t forget." Rosamond went down the narrow\r\nstairway, leaving behind her a faint, fresh odour of lavender and\r\norrisroot, and her father lay down again on the box-couch. "A hint about\r\nthe Cranes will be enough," he was thinking.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t in the least understand his older daughter. Not that he\r\npretended to understand Kathleen, either; but he usually knew how she\r\nwould feel about things, and she had always seemed to need his\r\nprotection more than Rosamond. When she was a student at the university,\r\nhe used sometimes to see her crossing the campus alone, her head and\r\nshoulders lowered against the wind, her muff beside her face, her narrow\r\nskirt clinging close. There was something too plucky, too "I\r\ncan-go-it-alone," about her quick step and jaunty little head; he didn\'t\r\nlike it, it gave him a sudden pang. He would always call to her and\r\ncatch up with her, and make her take his arm and be docile.\r\n\r\nShe had been much quicker at her lessons than Rosie, and very clever at\r\nwater-colour portrait sketches. She had done several really good\r\nlikenesses of her father--one, at least, was the man himself. With her\r\nmother she had no luck. She tried again and again, but the face was\r\nalways hard, the upper lip longer than it seemed in life, the nose long\r\nand severe, and she made something cold and plaster-like of Lillian\'s\r\nbeautiful complexion. "No, I don\'t see Mamma like that," she used to\r\nsay, throwing out her chin. "Of course I don\'t! It just _comes_ like\r\nthat." She had done many heads of her sister, all very sentimental and\r\ncuriously false, though Louie Marsellus protested to like them. Her\r\ndrawing-teacher at the university had urged Kathleen to go to Chicago\r\nand study in the life classes at the Art Institute, but she said\r\nresolutely: "No, I can\'t really do anybody but Papa, and I can\'t make a\r\nliving painting him."\r\n\r\n"The only unusual thing about Kitty," her father used to tell his\r\nfriends, "is that she doesn\'t think herself a bit unusual. Nowadays the\r\ngirls in my classes who have a spark of aptitude for anything seem to\r\nthink themselves remarkable."\r\n\r\nThough wilfulness was implied in the line of her figure, in the way she\r\nsometimes threw out her chin, Kathleen had never been deaf to reasoning,\r\ndeaf to her father, but once; and that was when, shortly after\r\nRosamond\'s engagement to Tom, she announced that she was going to marry\r\nScott McGregor. Scott was young, was just getting a start as a\r\njournalist, and his salary was not large enough for two people to live\r\nupon. That fact, the St. Peters thought, would act as a brake upon the\r\nimpetuous young couple. But soon after they were engaged Scott began to\r\ndo his daily prose poem for a newspaper syndicate. It was a success from\r\nthe start, and increased his earnings enough to enable him to marry. The\r\nProfessor had expected a better match for Kitty. He was no snob, and he\r\nliked Scott and trusted him; but he knew that Scott had a usual sort of\r\nmind, and Kitty had flashes of something quite different. Her father\r\nthought a more interesting man would make her happier. There was no\r\nholding her back, however, and the curious part of it was that, after\r\nthe very first, her mother supported her. St. Peter had a vague\r\nsuspicion that this was somehow on Rosamond\'s account more than on\r\nKathleen\'s; Lillian always worked things out for Rosamond. Yet at the\r\ntime he couldn\'t see how Kathleen\'s marriage would benefit Rosie. "Rosie\r\nis like your second self," he once declared to his wife, "but you never\r\npampered yourself at her age as you do her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an intense September noon--warm, windy, golden, with the smell of\r\nripe grapes and drying vines in the air, and the lake rolling blue on\r\nthe horizon. Scott McGregor, going into the west corner of the\r\nuniversity campus, caught sight of Mrs. St. Peter, just ahead of him,\r\nwalking in the same direction. He ran and caught up with her.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Lillian! Going in to see the Professor? So am I. I want him to\r\ngo swimming with me--I\'m cutting work. Shall we drop in and hear the end\r\nof his lecture, or sit down here on a bench in the sun?"\r\n\r\n"We can go quietly to the door and listen. If it\'s not interesting, we\r\ncan come back and sit down for a chat."\r\n\r\n"Good! I came early to overhear a bit. This is the hour he\'s with his\r\nseniors, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThey entered and went along the hall until they came to number 17; the\r\ndoor was ajar, and at the moment one of the students was speaking. When\r\nhe finished, they heard the Professor reply to him.\r\n\r\n"No, Miller, I don\'t myself think much of science as a phase of human\r\ndevelopment. It has given us a lot of ingenious toys; they take our\r\nattention away from the real problems, of course, and since the problems\r\nare insoluble, I suppose we ought to be grateful for distraction. But\r\nthe fact is, the human mind, the individual mind, has always been made\r\nmore interesting by dwelling on the old riddles, even if it makes\r\nnothing of them. Science hasn\'t given us any new amazements, except of\r\nthe superficial kind we get from witnessing dexterity and\r\nsleight-of-hand. It hasn\'t given us any richer pleasures, as the\r\nRenaissance did, nor any new sins--not one! Indeed, it takes our old\r\nones away. It\'s the laboratory, not the Lamb of God, that taketh away\r\nthe sins of the world. You\'ll agree there is not much thrill about a\r\nphysiological sin. We were better off when even the prosaic matter of\r\ntaking nourishment could have the magnificence of a sin. I don\'t think\r\nyou help people by making their conduct of no importance--you impoverish\r\nthem. As long as every man and woman who crowded into the cathedrals on\r\nEaster Sunday was a principal in a gorgeous drama with God, glittering\r\nangels on one side and the shadows of evil coming and going on the\r\nother, life was a rich thing. The king and the beggar had the same\r\nchance at miracles and great temptations and revelations. And that\'s\r\nwhat makes men happy, believing in the mystery and importance of their\r\nown little individual lives. It makes us happy to surround our creature\r\nneeds and bodily instincts with as much pomp and circumstance as\r\npossible. Art and religion (they are the same thing, in the end, of\r\ncourse) have given man the only happiness he has ever had.\r\n\r\n"Moses learned the importance of that in the Egyptian court, and when he\r\nwanted to make a population of slaves into an independent people in the\r\nshortest possible time, he invented elaborate ceremonials to give them a\r\nfeeling of dignity and purpose. Every act had some imaginative end. The\r\ncutting of the finger nails was a religious observance. The Christian\r\ntheologians went over the books of the Law, like great artists,\r\ngetting splendid effects by excision. They reset the stage with\r\nmore space and mystery, throwing all the light upon a few sins of\r\ngreat dramatic value--only seven, you remember, and of those only\r\nthree that are perpetually enthralling. With the theologians came the\r\ncathedral-builders; the sculptors and glassworkers and painters. They\r\nmight, without sacrilege, have changed the prayer a little and said,\r\n_Thy will be done in art, as it is in heaven._ How can it be done\r\nanywhere else as it is in heaven? But I think the hour is up. You might\r\ntell me next week, Miller, what you think science has done for us,\r\nbesides making us very comfortable."\r\n\r\nAs the young men filed out of the room, Mrs. St. Peter and McGregor went\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"I came over to get you to go to the electrician\'s with me, Godfrey, but\r\nI won\'t make you. Scott wants you to run out to the lake, and it\'s such\r\na fine day, you really should go."\r\n\r\n"Car\'s outside. We\'ll just drop Lillian at the house, Doctor, and you\r\ncan pick up your bathing-suit. We heard part of your lecture, by the\r\nway. How you get by the Methodists is still a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n"I wish he would get into trouble, Scott," said Lillian as they left the\r\nbuilding. "I wish he wouldn\'t talk to those fat-faced boys as if they\r\nwere intelligent beings. You cheapen yourself, Godfrey. It makes me a\r\nlittle ashamed."\r\n\r\n"I was rather rambling on to-day. I\'m sorry you happened along. There\'s\r\na fellow in that lot, Tod Miller, who isn\'t slow, and he excites me to\r\ncontroversy."\r\n\r\n"All the same," murmured his wife, "it\'s hardly dignified to think aloud\r\nin such company. It\'s in rather bad taste."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for the tip, Lillian. I won\'t do it again."\r\n\r\nIt took Scott only twenty minutes to get out to the lake. He drew up at\r\nthe bit of beach St. Peter had bought for himself years before; a little\r\ntriangle of sand running out into the water, with a bath-house and seven\r\nshaggy pine-trees on it. Scott had to fuss with the car, and the\r\nProfessor was undressed and in the water before him.\r\n\r\nWhen McGregor was ready to go in, his father-in-law was some distance\r\nout, swimming with an over-arm stroke, his head and shoulders well out\r\nof the water. He wore on his head a rubber visor of a kind he always\r\nbrought home from France in great numbers. This one was vermilion, and\r\nwas like a continuation of his flesh--his arms and back were burned a\r\ndeep terra-cotta from a summer in the lake. His head and powerful\r\nreaching arms made a strong red pattern against the purple blue of the\r\nwater. The visor was picturesque--his head looked sheathed and small and\r\nintensely alive, like the heads of the warriors on the Parthenon frieze\r\nin their tight, archaic helmets.\r\n\r\nBy five o\'clock St. Peter and McGregor were dressed and lying on the\r\nsand, their overcoats wrapped about them, smoking. Suddenly Scott began\r\nto chuckle.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Professor, you know your English friend, Sir Edgar Spilling? The\r\nday after I met him at your house, he came up to my office at the\r\n_Herald_ to get some facts you\'d been too modest to give him. When he\r\nwas leaving he stood and looked at one of these motto cards I have over\r\nmy desk, DON\'T KNOCK, and said: \'May I ask why you don\'t have that\r\nnotice on the outside of your door? I didn\'t observe any other way of\r\ngetting in.\' They never get wise, do they? He really went out to see\r\nMarsellus\' place--seemed interested. Doctor, are you going to let them\r\ncall that place after Tom?"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, how can I prevent it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you surely don\'t like the idea, do you?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor lit another cigarette and was a long while about it. When\r\nhe had got it going, he turned on his elbow and looked at McGregor.\r\n"Scott, you must see that I can\'t make suggestions to Louie. He\'s\r\nperfectly consistent. He\'s a great deal more generous and\r\npublic-spirited than I am, and my preferences would be enigmatical to\r\nhim. I can\'t, either, very gracefully express myself to you about his\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\n"I get you. Sorry he riles me so. I always say it shan\'t occur the next\r\ntime, but it does." Scott took out his pipe and lay silent for a time,\r\nlooking at the gold glow burning on the water and on the wings of the\r\ngulls as they flew by. His expression was wistful, rather mournful. He\r\nwas a good-looking fellow, with sunburned blond hair, splendid teeth,\r\nattractive eyes that usually frowned a little unless he was laughing\r\noutright, a small, prettily cut mouth, restless at the corners. There\r\nwas something moody and discontented about his face. The Professor had a\r\ngreat deal of sympathy for him; Scott was too good for his work. He had\r\nbeen delighted when his daily poem and his "uplift" editorials first\r\nproved successful, because that enabled him to marry. Now he could sell\r\nas many good-cheer articles as he had time to write, on any subject, and\r\nhe loathed doing them. Scott had early picked himself out to do\r\nsomething very fine, and he felt that he was wasting his life and his\r\ntalents. The new group of poets made him angry. When a new novel was\r\ndiscussed seriously by his friends, he was perfectly miserable. St.\r\nPeter knew that the poor boy had seasons of desperate unhappiness. His\r\ndisappointed vanity ate away at his vitals like the Spartan boy\'s wolf,\r\nand only the deep lines in his young forehead and the twitching at the\r\ncorners of his mouth showed that he suffered.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, when the students were giving an historical pageant to\r\ncommemorate the deeds of an early French explorer among the Great Lakes,\r\nthey asked St. Peter to do a picture for them, and he had arranged one\r\nwhich amused him very much, though it had nothing to do with the\r\nsubject. He posed his two sons-in-law in a tapestry-hung tent, for a\r\nconference between Richard Plantagenet and the Saladin, before the walls\r\nof Jerusalem. Marsellus, in a green dressing-gown and turban, was seated\r\nat a table with a chart, his hands extended in reasonable, patient\r\nargument. The Plantagenet was standing, his plumed helmet in his hand,\r\nhis square yellow head haughtily erect, his unthoughtful brows fiercely\r\nfrowning, his lips curled and his fresh face full of arrogance. The\r\ntableau had received no special notice, and Mrs. St. Peter had said\r\ndryly that she was afraid nobody saw his little joke. But the Professor\r\nliked his picture, and he thought it quite fair to both the young men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Professor happened to come home earlier than usual one bright\r\nOctober afternoon. He left the walk and cut across the turf, intending\r\nto enter by the open French window, but he paused a moment outside to\r\nadmire the scene within. The drawing-room was full of autumn flowers,\r\ndahlias and wild asters and goldenrod. The red-gold sunlight lay in\r\nbright puddles on the thick blue carpet, made hazy aureoles about the\r\nstuffed blue chairs. There was, in the room, as he looked through the\r\nwindow, a rich, intense effect of autumn, something that presented\r\nOctober much more sharply and sweetly to him than the coloured maples\r\nand the aster-bordered paths by which he had come home. It struck him\r\nthat the seasons sometimes gain by being brought into the house, just as\r\nthey gain by being brought into painting, and into poetry. The hand,\r\nfastidious and bold, which selected and placed--it was that which made\r\nthe difference. In Nature there is no selection.\r\n\r\nIn a corner, beside the steaming brass tea-kettle, sat Lillian and\r\nLouie, a little lacquer table between them, bending, it seemed, over a\r\ncasket of jewels. Lillian held up lovingly in her fingers a green-gold\r\nnecklace, evidently an old one, without stones. "Of course emeralds\r\nwould be beautiful, Louie, but they seem a little out of scale--to\r\nbelong to a different scheme of life than any you and Rosamond can live\r\nhere. You aren\'t, after all, outrageously rich. When would she wear\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"At home, Dearest, with me, at our own dinner-table at Outland! I like\r\nthe idea of their being out of scale. I\'ve never given her any jewels.\r\nI\'ve waited all this time to give her these. To me, her name spells\r\nemeralds."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter smiled, easily persuaded. "You\'ll never be able to keep\r\nthem. You\'ll show them to her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I won\'t! They are to stay at the jeweller\'s, in Chicago, until\r\nwe all go down for the birthday party. That\'s another secret we have to\r\nkeep. We have such lots of them!" He bent over her hand and kissed it\r\nwith warmth.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter swung in over the window rail. "That is always the cue for the\r\nhusband to enter, isn\'t it? What\'s this about Chicago, Louie?"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and Marsellus brought him some tea, lingering beside his\r\nchair. "It must be a secret from Rosie, but you see it happens that the\r\ndate of your lecture engagement at the University of Chicago is\r\ncoincident with her birthday, so I have planned that we shall all go\r\ndown together. And among other diversions, we shall attend your\r\nlectures."\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s eyebrows rose. "Bus-man\'s holiday for the ladies, I\r\nshould say."\r\n\r\n"But not for me. Remember, I wasn\'t in your classes, like Scott and\r\nOutland. I\'d give a good deal if I\'d had the chance!" Louie said\r\nsomewhat plaintively. "So you must make it up to me."\r\n\r\n"Come if you wish. Lectures seem to me a rather grim treat, Louie."\r\n\r\n"Not to me. With a wink of encouragement I\'ll go on to Boston with you\r\nnext winter, when you give the Lowell lectures."\r\n\r\n"Would you, really? Next year\'s a long way off. Now I must get clean.\r\nI\'ve been working in my other-house garden, and I\'m scarcely fit to have\r\ntea with a beautiful lady and a smartly dressed gentleman. What am I to\r\ndo about that garden in the end, Lillian? Destroy it? Or leave it to the\r\nmercy of the next tenants?"\r\n\r\nAs he went upstairs he turned at the bend of the staircase and looked\r\nback at them, again bending over their little box. Mrs. St. Peter was\r\nwearing the white silk cr\xc3\xaape that had been the most successful of her\r\nsummer dresses, and an orchid velvet ribbon about her shining hair. She\r\nwouldn\'t have made herself look quite so well if Louie hadn\'t been\r\ncoming, he reflected. Or was it that he wouldn\'t have noticed it if\r\nLouie hadn\'t been there? A man long accustomed to admire his wife in\r\ngeneral, seldom pauses to admire her in a particular gown or attitude,\r\nunless his attention is directed to her by the appreciative gaze of\r\nanother man.\r\n\r\nLillian\'s coquetry with her sons-in-law amused him. He hadn\'t foreseen\r\nit, and he found it rather the most piquant and interesting thing about\r\nhaving married daughters. It had begun with Scott--the younger sister\r\nwas married before the elder. St. Peter had thought that Scott McGregor\r\nwas the sort of fellow Lillian always found tiresome. But no; within a\r\nfew weeks after Kathleen\'s marriage, arch and confidential relations\r\nbegan to be evident between them. Even now, when Louie was so much in\r\nthe foreground, and Scott was touchy and jealous, Lillian was very\r\ntactful and patient with him.\r\n\r\nWith Louie, Lillian seemed to be launching into a new career, and\r\nGodfrey began to think that he understood his own wife very little. He\r\nwould have said that she would feel about Louie just as he did; would\r\nhave cultivated him as a stranger in the town, because he was so unusual\r\nand exotic, but without in the least wishing to adopt anyone so foreign\r\ninto the family circle. She had always been fastidious to an\r\nunreasonable degree about small niceties of deportment. She could never\r\nforgive poor Tom Outland for the angle at which he sometimes held a\r\ncigar in his mouth, or for the fact that he never learned to eat salad\r\nwith ease. At the dinner-table, if Tom, forgetting himself in talk,\r\nsometimes dropped back into railroad lunch-counter ways and pushed his\r\nplate away from him when he had finished a course, Lillian\'s face would\r\nbecome positively cruel in its contempt. Irregularities of that sort put\r\nher all on edge. But Louie could hurry audibly through his soup, or kiss\r\nher resoundingly on the cheek at a faculty reception, and she seemed to\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nYes, with her sons-in-law she had begun the game of being a woman all\r\nover again. She dressed for them, planned for them, schemed in their\r\ninterests. She had begun to entertain more than for years past--the new\r\nhouse made a plausible pretext--and to use her influence and charm in\r\nthe little anxious social world of Hamilton. She was intensely\r\ninterested in the success and happiness of these two young men, lived in\r\ntheir careers as she had once done in his. It was splendid, St. Peter\r\ntold himself. She wasn\'t going to have to face a stretch of boredom\r\nbetween being a young woman and being a young grandmother. She was less\r\nintelligent and more sensible than he had thought her.\r\n\r\nWhen Godfrey came downstairs ready for dinner, Louie was gone. He walked\r\nup to the chair where his wife was reading, and took her hand.\r\n\r\n"My dear," he said quite delicately, "I wish you could keep Louie from\r\nletting his name go up for the Arts and Letters. It\'s not safe yet. He\'s\r\nnot been here long enough. They\'re a fussy little bunch, and he ought to\r\nwait until they know him better."\r\n\r\n"You mean someone will blackball him? Do you really think so? But the\r\nCountry Club----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lillian; the Country Club is a big affair, and needs money. The\r\nArts and Letters is a little group of fellows, and, as I said, fussy."\r\n\r\n"Scott belongs," said Mrs. St. Peter rebelliously. "Did he tell you?"\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t, and I shall not tell you who did. But if you\'re tactful,\r\nyou can save Louie\'s feelings."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter closed her book without glancing down at it. A new\r\ninterest shone in her eyes and made them look quite through and beyond\r\nher husband. "I must see what I can do with Scott," she murmured.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter turned away to hide a smile. An old student of his, a friend\r\nwho belonged to "the Outland period," had told him laughingly that he\r\nwas sure Scott would blackball Marsellus if his name ever came to the\r\nvote. "You know Scott is a kid in some things," the friend had said.\r\n"He\'s a little sore at Marsellus, and says a secret ballot is the only\r\nway he can ever get him where it wouldn\'t hurt Mrs. St. Peter."\r\n\r\nWhile the Professor was eating his soup, he studied his wife\'s face in\r\nthe candlelight. It had changed so much since he found her laughing with\r\nLouie, and especially since he had dropped the hint about the Arts and\r\nLetters. It had become, he thought, too hard for the orchid velvet in\r\nher hair. Her upper lip had grown longer, and stiffened as it always did\r\nwhen she encountered opposition.\r\n\r\n"Well," he reflected, "it will be interesting to see what she can do\r\nwith Scott. That will make rather a test case."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in November there was a picturesque snow-storm, and that day\r\nKathleen telephoned her father at the university, asking him to stop on\r\nhis way home in the afternoon and help her to decide upon some new furs.\r\nAs he approached McGregor\'s spick-and-span bungalow at four o\'clock, he\r\nsaw Louie\'s Pierce-Arrow standing in front, with Ned, the chauffeur and\r\ngardener, in the driver\'s seat. Just then Rosamond came out of the\r\nbungalow alone, and down the path to the sidewalk, without seeing her\r\nfather. He noticed a singularly haughty expression on her face; her\r\nbrows drawn together over her nose. The curl of her lips was handsome,\r\nbut terrifying. He observed also something he had not seen before--a\r\ncoat of soft, purple-grey fur, that quite disguised the wide, slightly\r\nstooping shoulders he regretted in his truly beautiful daughter. He\r\ncalled to her, very much interested. "Wait a minute, Rosie. I\'ve not\r\nseen that before. It\'s extraordinarily becoming." He stroked his\r\ndaughter\'s sleeve with evident pleasure. "You know, these things with a\r\nkind of lurking purple and lavender in them are splendid for you. They\r\nmake your colour prettier than ever. It\'s only lately you\'ve begun to\r\nwear them. Louie\'s taste, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. He selects all my things for me," said Rosamond proudly.\r\n\r\n"Well, he does a good job. He knows what\'s right for you." St. Peter\r\ncontinued to look her up and down with satisfaction. "And Kathleen is\r\ngetting new furs. You were advising her?"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t mention it to me," Rosamond replied in a guarded voice.\r\n\r\n"No? And what do you call this, what beast?" he asked ingenuously, again\r\nstroking the fur with his bare hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s _taupe._"\r\n\r\n"Oh, moleskin!" He drew back a little. "Couldn\'t be better for your\r\ncomplexion. And is it warm?"\r\n\r\n"Very warm--and so light."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see!" He took Rosamond\'s arm and escorted her to her car.\r\n"Give Louie my compliments on his choice." The motor glided away--he\r\nwished he could escape as quickly and noiselessly, for he was a coward.\r\nBut he had a feeling that Kathleen was watching him from behind the sash\r\ncurtains. He went up to the door and made a long and thorough use of the\r\nfoot-scraper before he tapped on the glass. Kathleen let him in. She was\r\nvery pale; even her lips, which were always pink, like the inside of a\r\nwhite shell, were without colour. Neither of them mentioned the\r\njust-departed guest.\r\n\r\n"Have you been out in the park, Kitty? This is a pretty little storm.\r\nPerhaps you\'ll walk over to the old house with me presently." He talked\r\nsoothingly while he took off his coat and rubbers. "And now for the\r\nfurs!"\r\n\r\nKathleen went slowly into her bedroom. She was gone a great\r\nwhile--perhaps ten actual minutes. When she came back, the rims of her\r\neyes were red. She carried four large pasteboard boxes, tied together\r\nwith twine. St. Peter sprang up, took the parcel, and began untying the\r\nstring. He opened the first and pulled out a brown stole. "What is it,\r\nmink?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s Hudson Bay sable."\r\n\r\n"Very pretty." He put the collar round her neck and drew back to look at\r\nit. But after a sharp struggle Kathleen broke down. She threw off the\r\nfur and buried her face in a fresh handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry, Daddy, but it\'s no use to-day. I don\'t want any furs,\r\nreally. She spoils everything for me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, my dear, you hurt me terribly!" St. Peter put his hands\r\ntenderly on her soft hazel-coloured hair. "Face it squarely, Kitty; you\r\nmust not, you cannot, be envious. It\'s self-destruction."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it, Father. I envious. I don\'t think I would be if she let\r\nme alone, but she comes here with her magnificence and takes the life\r\nout of all our poor little things. Everybody knows she\'s rich, why does\r\nshe have to keep rubbing it in?"\r\n\r\n"But, Kitty dear, you wouldn\'t have her go home and change her coat\r\nbefore coming to see you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not that, Father, it\'s everything! You know we were never\r\njealous of each other at home. I was always proud of her good looks and\r\ngood taste. It\'s not her clothes, it\'s a feeling she has inside her.\r\nWhen she comes toward me, I feel hate coming toward me, like a snake\'s\r\nhate!"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter wiped his moist forehead. He was suffering with her, as if she\r\nhad been in physical anguish. "We can\'t, dear, we can\'t, in this world,\r\nlet ourselves think of things--of comparisons--like that. We are all too\r\nsusceptible to ugly suggestions. If Rosamond has a grievance, it\'s\r\nbecause you\'ve been untactful about Louie."\r\n\r\n"Even if I have, why should she be so revengeful? Does she think nobody\r\nelse calls him a Jew? Does she think it\'s a secret? I don\'t mind being\r\ncalled a Gentile."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all in the way it\'s done, you know, Kitty. And you\'ve shown that\r\nyou were a little bored with all their new things, now haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve shown that I don\'t like the way she overdresses, I suppose. I\r\nwould never have believed that Rosie could do anything in such bad\r\ntaste. While she is here among her old friends, she ought to dress like\r\nthe rest of us."\r\n\r\n"But doesn\'t she? It seems to me her things look about like yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Father, you\'re so simple! And Mother is very careful not to\r\nenlighten you. We go to the Guild to sew for the Mission fund, and Rosie\r\ncomes in a handmade French frock that cost more than all our dresses\r\nput together."\r\n\r\n"But if hers are no prettier, what does it matter how much they cost?"\r\nHe was watching Kathleen fearfully. Her pale skin had taken on a\r\ngreenish tinge--there was no doubt about it. He had never happened to\r\nsee that change occur in a face before, and he had never realized to\r\nwhat an ugly, painful transformation the common phrase "green with envy"\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\n"Oh, foolish, they are prettier, though you may not see it. It\'s not\r\njust the clothes"--she looked at him intently, and her eyes, in their\r\nreddened rims, expanded and cleared. "It\'s everything. When we were at\r\nhome, Rosamond was a kind of ideal to me. What she thought about\r\nanything, decided it for me. But she\'s entirely changed. She\'s become\r\nLouie. Indeed, she\'s worse than Louie. He and all this money have ruined\r\nher. Oh, Daddy, why didn\'t you and Professor Crane get to work and stop\r\nall this before it began? You were to blame. You knew that Tom had left\r\nsomething that was worth a lot, both of you. Why didn\'t you do\r\nsomething? You let it lie there in Crane\'s laboratory for this--this\r\nMarsellus to come along and exploit, until he almost thinks it\'s his own\r\nidea."\r\n\r\n"Things might have turned out the same, anyway," her father protested.\r\n"Whatever the process earned was Rosamond\'s. I wasn\'t in the mood to\r\nstruggle with manufacturers, I know nothing of such things. And Crane\r\nneeds every ounce of his strength for his own experiments. He doesn\'t\r\ncare about anything but the extent of space."\r\n\r\n"He\'d better have taken a few days off and saved his friend\'s\r\nreputation. Tom trusted him with everything. It\'s too foolish; that poor\r\nman being cut to pieces by surgeons all the time, and picking up the\r\nlittle that\'s left of himself and bothering about the limitations of\r\nspace--much good they\'ll do him!"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter rose, took both of his daughter\'s hands, and stood laughing at\r\nher. "Come now! You have more brains than that, Kitty. It happens you do\r\nunderstand that whatever poor Crane can find out about space is more\r\ngood to him than all the money the Marselluses will ever have. But are\r\nyou implying that if Crane and I had developed Tom\'s discovery, we might\r\nhave kept Rosie and her money in the family, for ourselves?"\r\n\r\nKathleen threw up her head. "Oh, I don\'t want her money!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly; nor do I. And we mustn\'t behave as if we did want it. If you\r\npermit yourself to be envious of Rosie, you\'ll be very foolish, and very\r\nunhappy."\r\n\r\nThe Professor walked away across the snowy park with a tired step. He\r\nwas heavy-hearted. For Kathleen he had a special kind of affection.\r\nPerhaps it was because he had had to take care of her for one whole\r\nsummer when she was little. Just as Mrs. St. Peter was ready to start\r\nfor Colorado with the children, the younger one developed whooping-cough\r\nand had to be left at home with her father. He had opportunity to\r\nobserve all her ways. She was only six, but he found her a\r\nsquare-dealing, dependable little creature. They worked out a\r\nsatisfactory plan of life together. She was to play in the garden all\r\nmorning, and was not on any account to disturb him in his study. After\r\nlunch he would take her to the lake or the woods, or he would read to\r\nher at home. She took pride in keeping her part of the contract. One day\r\nwhen he came out of his study at noon, he found her sitting on the third\r\nfloor stairs, just outside his door, with the arnica bottle in one hand\r\nand the fingers of the other puffed up like wee pink sausages. A bee had\r\nstung her in the garden, and she had waited half the morning for\r\nsympathy. She was very independent, and would tug at her leggings or\r\novershoes a great while before she asked for help.\r\n\r\nWhen they were little girls, Kathleen adored her older sister and liked\r\nto wait on her, was always more excited about Rosie\'s new dresses and\r\nwinter coat than about her own. This attachment had lasted even after\r\nthey were grown. St. Peter had never seen any change in it until\r\nRosamond announced her engagement to Louie Marsellus. Then, all at once,\r\nKathleen seemed to be done with her sister. Her father believed she\r\ncouldn\'t forgive Rosie\'s forgetting Tom so quickly.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when the Professor got back to the old house and sat down at\r\nhis writing-table. He would have an hour on his notes, he told himself,\r\nin spite of families and fortunes. And he had it. But when he looked up\r\nfrom his writing as the Angelus was ringing, two faces at once rose in\r\nthe shadows outside the yellow circle of his lamp: the handsome face of\r\nhis older daughter, surrounded by violet-dappled fur, with a cruel upper\r\nlip and scornful half-closed eyes, as she had approached her car that\r\nafternoon before she saw him; and Kathleen, her square little chin set\r\nso fiercely, her white cheeks actually becoming green under her swollen\r\neyes. He couldn\'t believe it. He rose quickly and went to his one\r\nwindow, opened it wider, and stood looking at the dark clump of\r\npine-trees that told where the Physics building stood. A sharp pain\r\nclutched his heart. Was it for this the light in Outland\'s laboratory\r\nused to burn so far into the night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following week St. Peter went to Chicago to give his lectures. He\r\nhad engaged rooms for himself and Lillian at a quiet hotel near the\r\nuniversity. The Marselluses went down by the same train, and they all\r\nalighted at the station together, in a raging snow-storm. The St. Peters\r\nwere to have tea with Louie at the Blackstone, before going to their own\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nTea was served in Louie\'s suite on the lake front, with a fine view of\r\nthe falling snow from the windows. The Professor was in a genial mood;\r\nhe was glad to be in a big city again, in a luxurious hotel, and\r\nespecially pleased to be able to sit in comfort and watch the storm over\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n"How snug you are here, Louie! This is really very nice," he said,\r\nturning back from the window when Rosamond called him.\r\n\r\nLouie came and put both hands on St. Peter\'s shoulders, exclaiming\r\ndelightedly: "And do you like these rooms, sir? Well, I\'m glad, for\r\nthey\'re yours! Rosie and I are farther down the corridor. Not a word!\r\nIt\'s all arranged. You are our guests for this engagement. We won\'t have\r\nour great scholar staying off in some grimy place on the South side. We\r\nwant him where we can keep an eye on him."\r\n\r\nLouie was so warm with his plan that the Professor could only express\r\nsatisfaction. "And our luggage?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s on the way. I cancelled your reservations and did everything in\r\norder. Now have your tea, but not too much. You dine early; you have an\r\nengagement for to-night. You and Dearest are going to the opera----Oh,\r\nnot with us! We have other fish to fry. You are going off alone."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Louie! And what are they giving to-night?"\r\n\r\n"_Mignon._ It will remind you of your student days in Paris."\r\n\r\n"It will. I always had _abonnement_ at the Op\xc3\xa9ra Comique, and _Mignon_\r\ncame round frequently. It\'s one of my favourites."\r\n\r\n"I thought so!" Louie kissed both the ladies, to express his\r\nsatisfaction. The Professor had forgotten his scruples about accepting\r\nlavish hospitalities. He was really very glad to have windows on the\r\nlake, and not to have to go away to another hotel. After the Marselluses\r\nwent to their own apartment, he remarked to his wife, while he unpacked\r\nhis bag, that it was much more convenient to be on the same floor with\r\nLouie and Rosamond. "Much better than cabbing across Chicago to meet\r\nthem all the time, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock he and his wife were in their places in the Auditorium.\r\nThe overture brought a smile to his lips and a gracious mood to his\r\nheart. The music seemed extraordinarily fresh and genuine still. It\r\nmight grow old-fashioned, he told himself, but never old, surely, while\r\nthere was any youth left in men. It was an expression of youth,--that,\r\nand no more; with the sweetness and foolishness, the lingering accent,\r\nthe heavy stresses--the delicacy, too--belonging to that time. After the\r\nentrance of the hero, Lillian leaned toward him and whispered: "Am I\r\nover-credulous? He looks to me exactly like the pictures of Goethe in\r\nhis youth."\r\n\r\n"So he does to me. He is certainly as tall as Goethe. I didn\'t know\r\ntenors were ever so tall. The _Mignon_ seems young, too."\r\n\r\nShe was slender, at any rate, and very fragile beside the courtly\r\n_Wilhelm._ When she began her immortal song, one felt that she was right\r\nfor the part, the pure lyric soprano that suits it best, and in her\r\nvoice there was something fresh and delicate, like deep wood flowers.\r\n"_Connais-tu-le-pays_"--it stirred one like the odours of early\r\nspring, recalled the time of sweet, impersonal emotions.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain fell on the first act, St. Peter turned to his wife. "A\r\nfine cast, don\'t you think? And the harps are very good. Except for the\r\nwood-winds, I should say it was as good as any performance I ever heard\r\nat the Comique."\r\n\r\n"How it does make one think of Paris, and of so many half-forgotten\r\nthings!" his wife murmured. It had been long since he had seen her face\r\nso relaxed and reflective and undetermined.\r\n\r\nThrough the next act he often glanced at her. Curious, how a young mood\r\ncould return and soften a face. More than once he saw a starry moisture\r\nshine in her eyes. If she only knew how much more lovely she was when\r\nshe wasn\'t doing her duty!\r\n\r\n"My dear," he sighed when the lights were turned on and they both looked\r\nolder, "it\'s been a mistake, our having a family and writing histories\r\nand getting middle-aged. We should have been picturesquely shipwrecked\r\ntogether when we were young."\r\n\r\n"How often I\'ve thought that!" she replied with a faint, melancholy\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"You? But you\'re so occupied with the future, you adapt yourself so\r\nreadily," he murmured in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"One must go on living, Godfrey. But it wasn\'t the children who came\r\nbetween us." There was something lonely and forgiving in her voice,\r\nsomething that spoke of an old wound, healed and hardened and hopeless.\r\n\r\n"You, you too?" he breathed in amazement. He took up one of her gloves\r\nand began drawing it out through his lingers. She said nothing, but he\r\nsaw her lip quiver, and she turned away and began looking at the house\r\nthrough the glasses. He likewise began to examine the audience. He\r\nwished he knew just how it seemed to her. He had been mistaken, he felt.\r\nThe heart of another is a dark forest, always, no matter how close it\r\nhas been to one\'s own. Presently the melting music of the tenor\'s last\r\naria brought their eyes together in a smile not altogether sad.\r\n\r\nThat night, after he was in bed, among unaccustomed surroundings and a\r\nlittle wakeful, St. Peter still played with his idea of a picturesque\r\nshipwreck, and he cast about for the particular occasion he would have\r\nchosen for such a finale. Before he went to sleep he found the very day,\r\nbut his wife was not in it. Indeed, nobody was in it but himself, and a\r\nweather-dried little sea captain from the Hautes-Pyr\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9es, half a\r\ndozen spry seamen, and a line of gleaming snow peaks, agonizingly high\r\nand sharp, along the southern coast of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouie arranged the birthday dinner in the public dining-room of the\r\nhotel, and three of the Professor\'s colleagues dined with them on that\r\noccasion. Louie had gone out to the university to hear St. Peter\r\nlecture, had met some of the faculty, and immediately invited them to\r\ndinner. They accepted--when was a professor known to refuse a good\r\ndinner? Rosamond was presented with her emeralds, and, as St. Peter\r\nafterward observed to his wife, practically all the guests in the\r\ndining-room were participants in the happy event. Lillian was doubtless\r\nright when she told him that, all the same, his fellow professors went\r\naway from the Blackstone that night respecting Godfrey St. Peter more\r\nthan they had ever done before, and if they had marriageable daughters,\r\nthey were certainly envying him his luck.\r\n\r\n"That," her husband replied, "is my chief objection to public\r\nmagnificence; it seems to show everybody up in the worst possible light.\r\nI\'m not finding fault with anyone but myself, understand. When I\r\nconsented to occupy an apartment I couldn\'t afford, I let myself in for\r\nwhatever might follow."\r\n\r\nThey got back to Hamilton in bitter weather. The lake winds were\r\nscourging the town, and Scott had laryngitis and was writing prose poems\r\nabout the pleasures of tending your own furnace when the thermometer is\r\ntwenty below.\r\n\r\n"Godfrey," said Mrs. St. Peter when he set off for his class-room on the\r\nmorning after their return, "surely you\'re not going to the old house\r\nthis afternoon. It will be like a refrigerating-plant. There\'s no way of\r\nheating your study except by that miserable little stove."\r\n\r\n"There never was, my dear. I got along a good many years."\r\n\r\n"It was very different when the house below was heated. That stove isn\'t\r\nsafe when you keep the window open. A gust of wind might blow it out at\r\nany moment, and if you were at work you\'d never notice until you were\r\nhalf poisoned by gas. You\'ll get a fine headache one of these days."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got headaches that way before, and survived them," he said\r\nstubbornly.\r\n\r\n"How can you be so perverse? You know things are different now, and you\r\nought to take more care of your health."\r\n\r\n"Why so? It\'s not worth half so much as it was then."\r\n\r\nHis wife disregarded this. "And don\'t you think it\'s a foolish\r\nextravagance to go on paying the rent of an entire house, in order to\r\nspend a few hours a day in one very uncomfortable room of it?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s dark skin reddened, and the ends of his formidable\r\neyebrows ascended toward his black hair. "It\'s almost my only\r\nextravagance," he muttered fiercely.\r\n\r\n"How irritable and unreasonable he is becoming!" his wife reflected, as\r\nshe heard him putting on his overshoes in the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Christmas day the weather turned mild again. There would be a family\r\ndinner in the evening, but St. Peter was going to have the whole day to\r\nhimself, in the old house. He asked his wife to put him up some\r\nsandwiches, so that he needn\'t come back for lunch. He kept a few\r\nbottles of sherry in his study, in the old chest under the forms.\r\nFortunately he had brought back a great deal of it from his last trip to\r\nSpain. It wasn\'t foresight--Prohibition was then unthinkable--but a\r\nlucky accident. He had gone with his innkeeper to an auction, and bought\r\nin a dozen dozens of a sherry that went very cheap. He came home by the\r\nCity of Mexico and got the wine through without duty.\r\n\r\nAs he was crossing the park with his sandwiches, he met Augusta coming\r\nback from Mass.\r\n\r\n"Are you still going to the old house, Professor?" she asked\r\nreproachfully, her face smiling at him between her stiff black fur\r\ncollar and her stiff black hat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Augusta, but it\'s not the same. I miss you. There are never\r\nany new dresses on my ladies in the evening now. Won\'t you come in\r\nsometime and deck them out, as a surprise for me? I like to see them\r\nlooking smart."\r\n\r\nAugusta laughed. "You are a funny man, Doctor St. Peter. If anyone else\r\nsaid the things you do to your classes, I\'d be scandalized. But I always\r\ntell people you don\'t mean half you say."\r\n\r\n"And how do you know what I say to my classes, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, they go out and talk about it when you say slighting\r\nthings about the Church," she said gravely.\r\n\r\n"But, really, Augusta, I don\'t think I ever do."\r\n\r\n"Well, they take it that way. They are not as smart as you, and you\r\nought to be careful."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter. What they think to-day, they\'ll forget to-morrow."\r\nHe was walking beside Augusta, with a slack, indifferent stride, very\r\nunlike the step he had when he was full of something. "That reminds me:\r\nI\'ve been wanting to ask you a question. That passage in the service\r\nabout the Mystical Rose, Lily of Zion, Tower of Ivory--is that the\r\nMagnificat?"\r\n\r\nAugusta stopped and looked at him. "Why, Professor! Did you receive no\r\nreligious instruction at all?"\r\n\r\n"How could I, Augusta? My mother was a Methodist, there was no Catholic\r\nchurch in our town in Kansas, and I guess my father forgot his\r\nreligion."\r\n\r\n"That happens, in mixed marriages." Augusta spoke meaningly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, I suppose so. But tell me, what is the Magnificat, then?"\r\n\r\n"The Magnificat begins, doth magnify _My soul dot magnify the Lord_; you\r\nmust know that."\r\n\r\n"But I thought the Magnificat was about the Virgin?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Professor! The Blessed Virgin composed the Magnificat."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter became intensely interested. "Oh, she did?"\r\n\r\nAugusta spoke gently, as if she were prompting him and did not wish to\r\nrebuke his ignorance too sharply. "Why, yes, just as soon as the angel\r\nhad announced to her that she would be the mother of our Lord, the\r\nBlessed Virgin composed the Magnificat. I always think of you as knowing\r\neverything, Doctor St. Peter!"\r\n\r\n"And you\'re always finding out how little I know. Well, you don\'t give\r\nme away. You are very discreet."\r\n\r\nTheir ways parted, and both went on more cheerful than when they met.\r\nThe Professor climbed to his study feeling quite as though Augusta had\r\nbeen there and brightened it up for him. (Surely she had said that the\r\nBlessed Virgin sat down and composed the Magnificat!) Augusta had been\r\nwith them often in the holiday season, back in the years when holidays\r\nwere holidays indeed. He had grown to like the reminders of herself that\r\nshe left in his work-room--especially the toilettes upon the figures.\r\nSometimes she made those terrible women entirely plausible!\r\n\r\nIn the early years, no matter how hard he was working, he had always\r\nfelt the sense of holiday, of a special warmth and fragrance in the air,\r\nsteal up to his study from the house below. When he was writing his\r\nbest, he was conscious of pretty little girls in fresh dresses--of\r\nflowers and greens in the comfortable, shabby sitting-room--of his\r\nwife\'s good looks and good taste--even of a better dinner than usual\r\nunder preparation downstairs. All the while he had been working so\r\nfiercely at his eight big volumes, he was not insensible to the domestic\r\ndrama that went on beneath him. His mind had played delightedly with all\r\nthose incidents. Just as, when Queen Mathilde was doing the long\r\ntapestry now shown at Bayeux,--working her chronicle of the deeds of\r\nknights and heroes,--alongside the big pattern of dramatic action she\r\nand her women carried the little playful pattern of birds and beasts\r\nthat are a story in themselves; so, to him, the most important chapters\r\nof his history were interwoven with personal memories.\r\n\r\nOn this Christmas morning, with that sense of the past in his mind, the\r\nProfessor went mechanically to work, and the morning disappeared. Before\r\nhe knew it was passing, the bells from Augusta\'s church across the park\r\nrang out and told him it was gone. He pushed back his papers and\r\narranged his writing-table for lunch.\r\n\r\nHe had been working hard, he judged, because he was so hungry. He peered\r\nwith interest into the basket his wife had given him--a wicker bag, it\r\nwas, really, that he had once bought full of strawberries at Gibraltar.\r\nChicken sandwiches with lettuce leaves, red California grapes, and two\r\nshapely, long-necked russet pears. That would do very well; and Lillian\r\nhad thoughtfully put in one of her best dinner napkins, knowing he hated\r\nugly linen. From the chest he took out a round cheese, and a bottle of\r\nhis wine, and began to polish a sherry glass.\r\n\r\nWhile he was enjoying his lunch, he was thinking of certain holidays he\r\nhad spent alone in Paris, when he was living at Versailles, with the\r\nThieraults, as tutor to their boys. There was one All Souls\' Day when he\r\nhad gone into Paris by an early train and had a magnificent breakfast on\r\nthe Rue de Vaugirard--not at Foyot\'s, he hadn\'t money enough in those\r\ndays to put his nose inside the place. After breakfast he went out to\r\nwalk in the soft rainfall. The sky was of such an intense silvery grey\r\nthat all the grey stone buildings along the Rue St. Jacques and the Rue\r\nSufflot came out in that silver shine stronger than in sunlight. The\r\nshop windows were shut; on the bleak ascent to the Pantheon there was\r\nnot a spot of colour, nothing but wet, shiny, quick-silvery grey,\r\naccented by black crevices, and weatherworn bosses white as wood-ash.\r\nAll at once, from somewhere behind the Pantheon itself, a man and woman,\r\npushing a hand-cart, came into the empty street. The cart was full of\r\npink dahlias, all exactly the same colour. The young man was fair and\r\nslight, with a pale face; the woman carried a baby. Both they and the\r\nwheels of their barrow were splashed with mud. They must have come from\r\na good way in the country, and were a weary, anxious-looking pair. They\r\nstopped at a corner before the Pantheon and fearfully scanned the bleak,\r\nsilvery, deserted streets. The man went into a bakery, and his wife\r\nbegan to spread out the flowers, which were done up in large bouquets\r\nwith fresh green chestnut-leaves. Young St. Peter approached and asked\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\n"_Deux francs cinquante, Monsieur_," she said with a kind of desperate\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nHe took a bunch and handed her a five-franc note. She had no change. Her\r\nhusband, watching from the bakery, came running across with a loaf of\r\nbread under his arm.\r\n\r\n"_Deux francs cinquante_," she called to him as he came up. He put his\r\nhand into his pocket and fumbled.\r\n\r\n"_Deux francs cinquante_," she repeated with painful tension. The price\r\nagreed upon had probably been a franc or a franc fifty. The man counted\r\nout the change to the student and looked at his wife with admiration.\r\nSt. Peter was so pleased with his flowers that it hadn\'t occurred to him\r\nto get more; but all his life he had regretted that he didn\'t buy two\r\nbunches, and push their fortunes a little further. He had never again\r\nfound dahlias of such a beautiful colour, or so charmingly arranged with\r\nbright chestnut-leaves.\r\n\r\nA moment later he was strolling down the hill, wondering to whom he\r\ncould give his bouquet, when a pathetic procession filed past him\r\nthrough the rain. The girls of a charity school came walking two and\r\ntwo, in hideous dark uniforms and round felt hats without ribbon or bow,\r\nmarshalled by four black-bonneted nuns. They were all looking down, all\r\nbut one--the pretty one, naturally--and she was looking sidewise,\r\ndirectly at the student and his flowers. Their eyes met, she smiled, and\r\njust as he put out his hand with the bouquet, one of the sisters flapped\r\nup like a black crow and shut the girl\'s pretty face from him. She would\r\nhave to pay for that smile, he was afraid. Godfrey spent his day in the\r\nLuxembourg Gardens and walked back to the Gare St. Lazare at evening\r\nwith nothing but his return ticket in his pocket, very glad to get home\r\nto Versailles in time for the family dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen he first went to live with the Thieraults, he had found Madame\r\nThierault severe and exacting, stingy about his laundry and grudging\r\nabout the cheese and fruit he ate for dinner. But in the end she was\r\nvery kind to him; she never pampered him, but he could depend upon her.\r\nHer three sons had always been his dearest friends. Gaston, the one he\r\nloved best, was dead--killed in the Boxer uprising in China. But Pierre\r\nstill lived at Versailles, and Charles had a business in Marseilles.\r\nWhen he was in France their homes were his. They were much closer to him\r\nthan his own brothers. It was one summer when he was in France, with\r\nLillian and the two little girls, that the idea of writing a work upon\r\nthe early Spanish explorers first occurred to him, and he had turned at\r\nonce to the Thieraults. After giving his wife enough money to finish the\r\nsummer and get home, he took the little that was left and went down to\r\nMarseilles to talk over his project with Charles Thierault _fils_, whose\r\nmercantile house did a business with Spain in cork. Clearly St. Peter\r\nwould have to be in Spain as much as possible for the next few years,\r\nand he would have to live there very cheaply. The Thieraults were always\r\nglad of a chance to help him. Not with money,--they were too French and\r\ntoo logical for that. But they would go to any amount of trouble and no\r\ninconsiderable expense to save him a few thousand francs.\r\n\r\nThat summer Charles kept him for three weeks in his oleander-buried\r\nhouse in the Prado, until his little brig, _L\'Espoir_, sailed out of the\r\nnew port with a cargo for Algeciras. The captain was from the\r\nHautes-Pyr\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9es, and his spare crew were all Proven\xc3\xa7als, seamen\r\ntrained in that hard school of the Gulf of Lyons. On the voyage\r\neverything seemed to feed the plan of the work that was forming in St.\r\nPeter\'s mind; the skipper, the old Catalan second mate, the sea itself.\r\nOne day stood out above the others. All day long they were skirting the\r\nsouth coast of Spain; from the rose of dawn to the gold of sunset the\r\nranges of the Sierra Nevadas towered on their right, snow peak after\r\nsnow peak, high beyond the flight of fancy, gleaming like crystal and\r\ntopaz. St. Peter lay looking up at them from a little boat riding low in\r\nthe purple water, and the design of his book unfolded in the air above\r\nhim, just as definitely as the mountain ranges themselves. And the\r\ndesign was sound. He had accepted it as inevitable, had never meddled\r\nwith it, and it had seen him through.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late on Christmas afternoon when the Professor got back to the\r\nnew house, but he was in such a happy frame of mind that he feared\r\nnothing, not even a family dinner. He quite looked forward to it, on the\r\ncontrary. His wife heard him humming his favorite air from _Matrimonio\r\nSegreto_ while he was dressing.\r\n\r\nThat evening the two daughters of the house arrived almost at the same\r\nmoment. When Rosamond threw off her cloak in the hall, her father\r\nnoticed that she was wearing her new necklace. Kathleen stood looking at\r\nit, and was evidently trying to find courage to say something about it,\r\nwhen Louie helped her by breaking in.\r\n\r\n"And, Kitty, you haven\'t seen our jewels! What do you think? Just look\r\nat it."\r\n\r\n"I was looking. It\'s too lovely!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s very old, you see, the gold. What a work I had finding it! She\r\ndoesn\'t like anything showy, you know, and she doesn\'t care about\r\nintrinsic values. It must be beautiful, first of all."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is that, surely."\r\n\r\nLouie walked up and down, admiring his wife. "She carries off things\r\nlike that, doesn\'t she? And yet, you know, I like her in simple things,\r\ntoo." He dropped into reflection, just as if he were alone and talking\r\nto himself. "I always remember a little bracelet she wore the night I\r\nfirst met her. A turquoise set in silver, wasn\'t it? Yes, a turquoise\r\nset in dull silver. Have you it yet, Rosie?"\r\n\r\n"I think so." There was a shade of displeasure in Rosamond\'s voice, and\r\nshe turned back into the hall to look for something. "Where are the\r\nviolets you brought for Mamma?"\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter came in, followed by the maid and the cocktails. Scott\r\nbegan the usual Prohibition lament.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you journalists tell the truth about it in print?" Louie\r\nasked him. "It\'s a case where you could do something."\r\n\r\n"And lose my job? Not much! This country\'s split in two, socially, and I\r\ndon\'t know if it\'s ever coming together. It\'s not so hard on me, I can\r\ndrink hard liquor. But you and the Professor like wine and fancy stuff."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s nothing to us! We\'re going to France for the summer," Louie\r\nput his arm round his wife and rubbed his cheek against hers, saying\r\ncaressingly, "and drink Burgundy, Burgundy, Burgundy!"\r\n\r\n"Please take me with you, Louie," Mrs. St. Peter pleaded, to distract\r\nhim from his wife. Nothing made the McGregors so uncomfortable and so\r\nwrathful as the tender moments which sometimes overtook the Marselluses\r\nin public.\r\n\r\n"We are going to take you, and Papa too. That\'s our plan. I take him for\r\nsafety. If I travelled on the Continent alone with two such handsome\r\nwomen, it wouldn\'t be tolerated. There would be a trumped-up quarrel,\r\nand a stiletto, and then somebody would be a widow," turning again to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"Come here, Louie." Mrs. St. Peter beckoned him. "I have a confession to\r\nmake. I\'m afraid there\'s no dinner for you to-night."\r\n\r\n"No dinner for me?"\r\n\r\n"No. There\'s nothing either you or Godfrey will like. It\'s Scott\'s\r\ndinner to-night. Your tastes are so different, I can\'t compromise. And\r\nthis is his, from the cream soup to the frozen pudding."\r\n\r\n"But who said I didn\'t like cream soup and frozen pudding?" Louie held\r\nout his hands to show their guiltlessness. "And are there _haricots\r\nverts_ in cream sauce? I thought so! And I like those, too. The truth\r\nis, Dearest," he stood before her and tapped her chin with his finger,\r\n"the truth is that I like all Scott\'s dinners, it\'s he who doesn\'t like\r\nmine! He\'s the intolerant one."\r\n\r\n"True for you, Louie," laughed the Professor.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s that way about lots of things," said Louie a little\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Kitty," said Scott as they were driving home that night, Kathleen in\r\nthe driver\'s seat beside him, "that silver bracelet Louie spoke of was\r\none of Tom\'s trinkets, wasn\'t it? Do you suppose she has some feeling\r\nfor him still, under all this pompuosity?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, and I don\'t care. But, oh, Scott, I do love you very\r\nmuch!" she cried vehemently.\r\n\r\nHe pinched off his driving-glove between his knees and snuggled his hand\r\nover hers, inside her muff. "Sure?" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I _do!_" she said fiercely, squeezing his knuckles together with\r\nall her might.\r\n\r\n"Awful nice of you to have told me all about it at the start, Kitty.\r\nMost girls wouldn\'t have thought it necessary. I\'m the only one who\r\nknows, ain\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"The only one who ever has known."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m just the one another girl wouldn\'t have told. Why did you,\r\nKit?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I suppose even then I must have had a feeling that you\r\nwere the real one." Her head dropped on his shoulder. "You know you are\r\nthe real one, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I guess!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThat winter there was a meeting of an Association of Electrical\r\nEngineers in Hamilton. Louie Marsellus, who was a member, gave a\r\nluncheon for the visiting engineers at the Country Club, and then\r\nmotored them to Outland. Scott McGregor was at the lunch, with the other\r\nnewspaper men. On his return he stopped at the university and picked up\r\nhis father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run you over home. Which house, the old? How did you get out of\r\nLouie\'s party?"\r\n\r\n"I had classes."\r\n\r\n"It was some lunch! Louie\'s a good host. First-rate cigars, and plenty\r\nof them," Scott tapped his breast-pocket. "We had poor Tom served up\r\nagain. It was all right, of course--the scientific men were interested,\r\ndidn\'t know much about him. Louie called on me for personal\r\nrecollections; he was very polite about it. I didn\'t express myself very\r\nwell. I\'m not much of a speaker, anyhow, and this time I seemed to be\r\ntalking uphill. You know, Tom isn\'t very real to me any more. Sometimes\r\nI think he was just a--a glittering idea. Here we are, Doctor."\r\n\r\nScott\'s remark rather troubled the Professor. He went up the two flights\r\nof stairs and sat down in his shadowy crypt at the top of the house.\r\nWith his right elbow on the table, his eyes on the floor, he began\r\nrecalling as clearly and definitely as he could every incident of that\r\nbright, windy spring day when he first saw Tom Outland.\r\n\r\nHe was working in his garden one Saturday morning, when a young man in a\r\nheavy winter suit and a Stetson hat, carrying a grey canvas telescope,\r\ncame in at the green door that led from the street.\r\n\r\n"Are you Professor St. Peter?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nUpon being assured, he set down his bag on the gravel, took out a blue\r\ncotton handkerchief, and wiped his face, which was covered with beads of\r\nmoisture. The first thing the Professor noticed about the visitor was\r\nhis manly, mature voice--low, calm, experienced, very different from the\r\nthin ring or the hoarse shouts of boyish voices about the campus. The\r\nnext thing he observed was the strong line of contrast below the young\r\nman\'s sandy hair--the very fair forehead which had been protected by his\r\nhat, and the reddish brown of his face, which had evidently been exposed\r\nto a stronger sun than the spring sun of Hamilton. The boy was\r\nfine-looking, he saw--tall and presumably well built, though the\r\nshoulders of his stiff, heavy coat were so preposterously padded that\r\nthe upper part of him seemed shut up in a case.\r\n\r\n"I want to go to school here, Professor St. Peter, and I\'ve come to ask\r\nyour advice. I don\'t know anybody in the town."\r\n\r\n"You want to enter the university, I take it? What high school are you\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never been to high school, sir. That\'s the trouble."\r\n\r\n"Why, yes. I hardly see how you can enter the university. Where are you\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"New Mexico. I haven\'t been to school, but I\'ve studied. I read Latin\r\nwith a priest down there."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter smiled incredulously. "How much Latin?"\r\n\r\n"I read C\xc3\xa6sar and Virgil, the _\xc3\x86neid._"\r\n\r\n"How many books?"\r\n\r\n"We went right through." He met the Professor\'s questions squarely, his\r\neyes were resolute, like his voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you did." St. Peter stood his spade against the wall. He had been\r\ndigging around his red-fruited thorn-trees. "Can you repeat any of it?"\r\n\r\nThe boy began: "_Infandum, jubes renovare dolorem_," and steadily\r\ncontinued for fifty lines or more, until St. Peter held up a checking\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Your priest was a thorough Latinist. You have a good\r\npronunciation and good intonation. Was the Father by any chance a\r\nFrenchman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. He was a missionary priest, from Belgium."\r\n\r\n"Did you learn any French from him?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. He wanted to practise his Spanish."\r\n\r\n"You speak Spanish?"\r\n\r\n"Not very well, Mexican Spanish."\r\n\r\nThe Professor tried him out in Spanish and told him he thought he knew\r\nenough to get credit for a modern language. "And what are your\r\ndeficiencies?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never had any mathematics or science, and I write a very bad\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not unusual," St. Peter told him. "But, by the way, how did you\r\nhappen to come to me instead of to the registrar?"\r\n\r\n"I just got in this morning, and your name was the only one here I knew.\r\nI read an article by you in a magazine, about Fray Marcos. Father\r\nDuchene said it was the only thing with any truth in it he\'d read about\r\nour country down there."\r\n\r\nThe Professor had noticed before that whenever he wrote for popular\r\nperiodicals it got him into trouble. "Well, what are your plans, young\r\nman? And, by the way, what is your name?"\r\n\r\n"Tom Outland."\r\n\r\nThe Professor repeated it. It seemed to suit the boy exactly.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m twenty." He blushed, and St. Peter supposed he was dropping off a\r\nfew years, but he found afterward that the boy didn\'t know exactly how\r\nold he was. "I thought I might get a tutor and make up my mathematics\r\nthis summer."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that could be managed. How are you fixed for money?"\r\n\r\nOutland\'s face grew grave. "I\'m rather awkwardly fixed. If you were to\r\nwrite to Tarpin, New Mexico, to inquire about me, you\'d find I have\r\nmoney in the bank there, and you\'d think I had been deceiving you. But\r\nit\'s money I can\'t touch while I\'m able-bodied. It\'s in trust for\r\nsomeone else. But I\'ve got three hundred dollars without any string on\r\nit, and I\'m hoping to get work here. I\'ve been bossing a section gang\r\nall winter, and I\'m in good condition. I\'ll do anything but wait table.\r\nI won\'t do that." On this point he seemed to feel strongly.\r\n\r\nThe Professor learned some of his story that morning. His parents, he\r\nsaid, were "mover people," and both died when they were crossing\r\nsouthern Kansas in a prairie schooner. He was a baby and had been\r\ninformally adopted by some kind people who took care of his mother in\r\nher last hours,--a locomotive engineer named O\'Brien, and his wife. This\r\nengineer was transferred to New Mexico and took the foundling boy along\r\nwith his own children. As soon as Tom was old enough to work, he got a\r\njob as call boy and did his share toward supporting the family.\r\n\r\n"What\'s a call boy, a messenger boy?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. It\'s a more responsible position. Our town was an important\r\nfreight division on the Santa F\xc3\xa9, and a lot of train men live there.\r\nThe freight schedule is always changing, because it\'s a single track\r\nroad and the dispatcher has to get the freights through when he can.\r\nSuppose you\'re a brakeman, and your train is due out at two A. M.; well,\r\nlike as not, it will be changed to midnight, or to four in the morning.\r\nYou go to bed as if you were going to sleep all night, with nothing on\r\nyour mind. The call boy watches the schedule board, and half an hour\r\nbefore your train goes out, he comes and taps on your window and gets\r\nyou up in time to make it. The call boy has to be on to things in the\r\ntown. He must know when there\'s a poker game on, and how to slip in\r\neasy. You can\'t tell when there\'s a spotter about, and if a man\'s\r\nreported for gambling, he\'s fired. Sometimes you have to get a man when\r\nhe isn\'t where he ought to be. I found there was usually a reason at\r\nhome for that." The boy spoke with gravity, as if he had reflected\r\ndeeply upon irregular behaviour.\r\n\r\nJust then Mrs. St. Peter came out into the garden and asked her husband\r\nif he wouldn\'t bring his young friend in to lunch. Outland started and\r\nlooked with panic toward the door by which he had come in; but the\r\nProfessor wouldn\'t hear of his going, and picked up his telescope to\r\nprevent his escape. As he carried it into the house and put it down in\r\nthe hall, he noticed that it was strangely light for its bulk. Mrs. St.\r\nPeter introduced the guest to her two little girls, and asked him if he\r\ndidn\'t want to go upstairs to wash his hands. He disappeared; as he came\r\nback something disconcerting happened. The front hall and the front\r\nstaircase were the only hard wood in the house, but as Tom came down the\r\nwaxed steps, his heavy new shoes shot out from under him, and he sat\r\ndown on the end of his spine with a thump. Little Kathleen burst into a\r\ngiggle, and her elder sister looked at her reprovingly; Mrs. St. Peter\r\napologized for the stairs.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much used to stairs, living mostly in \'dobe houses," Tom\r\nexplained, as he picked himself up.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon the boy was very silent at first. He sat looking admiringly\r\nat Mrs. St. Peter and the little girls. The day had grown warm, and the\r\nProfessor thought this was the hottest boy he had ever seen. His stiff\r\nwhite collar began to melt, and his handkerchief, as he kept wiping his\r\nface with it, became a rag. "I didn\'t know it would be so warm up here,\r\nor I\'d have picked a lighter suit," he said, embarrassed by the activity\r\nof his skin.\r\n\r\n"We would like to hear more about your life in the South-west," said his\r\nhost. "How long were you a call boy?"\r\n\r\n"Two years. Then I had pneumonia, and the doctor said I ought to go on\r\nthe range, so I went to work for a big cattle firm."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter began to question him about the Indian pueblos. He was\r\nreticent at first, but he presently warmed up in defence of Indian\r\nhousewifery. He forgot his shyness so far, indeed, that having made a\r\nneat heap of mashed potato beside his chop, he conveyed it to his mouth\r\non the blade of his knife, at which sight the little girls were not able\r\nto conceal their astonishment. Mrs. St. Peter went on quietly talking\r\nabout Indian pottery and asking him where they made the best.\r\n\r\n"I think the very best is the old,--the cliff-dweller pottery," he said.\r\n"Do you take an interest in pottery, Ma\'am? Maybe you\'d like to see some\r\nI have brought along." As they rose from the table he went to his\r\ntelescope underneath the hat-rack, knelt beside it, and undid the\r\nstraps. When he lifted the cover, it seemed full of bulky objects\r\nwrapped in newspapers. After feeling among them, he unwrapped one and\r\ndisplayed an earthen water jar, shaped like those common in Greek\r\nsculpture, and ornamented with a geometrical pattern in black and white.\r\n\r\n"That\'s one of the real old ones. I know, for I got it out myself. I\r\ndon\'t know just how old, but there\'s pi\xc3\xb1on trees three hundred years\r\nold by their rings, growing up in the stone trail that leads to the\r\nruins where I got it."\r\n\r\n"Stone trail . . . pi\xc3\xb1ons?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, deep, narrow trails in white rock, worn by their moccasin feet\r\ncoming and going for generations. And these old pi\xc3\xb1on trees have come\r\nup in the trails since the race died off. You can tell something about\r\nhow long ago it was by them." He showed her a coating of black on the\r\nunder side of the jar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not from the firing. See, I can scratch it off. It\'s soot, from\r\nwhen it was on the cook-fire last--and that was before Columbus landed,\r\nI guess. Nothing makes those people seem so real to me as their old\r\npots, with the fire-black on them." As she gave it back to him, he shook\r\nhis head. "That one\'s for you, Ma\'am, if you like it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I couldn\'t think of letting you give it to me! You must keep it for\r\nyourself, or put it in a museum." But that seemed to touch a sore spot.\r\n\r\n"Museums," he said bitterly, "they don\'t care about our things. They\r\nwant something that came from Crete or Egypt. I\'d break my jars sooner\r\nthan they should get them. But I\'d like this one to have a good home,\r\namong your nice things"--he looked about appreciatively. "I\'ve no place\r\nto keep them. They\'re in my way, especially that big one. My trunk is at\r\nthe station, but I was afraid to leave the pottery. You don\'t get them\r\nout whole like that very often."\r\n\r\n"But get them out of what, from where? I want to know all about it."\r\n\r\n"Maybe some day, Ma\'am, I can tell you," he said, wiping his sooty\r\nfingers on his handkerchief. His reply was courteous but final. He\r\nstrapped his bag and picked up his hat, then hesitated and smiled.\r\nTaking a buckskin bag from his pocket, he walked over to the window-seat\r\nwhere the children were, and held out his hand to them, saying: "These I\r\nwould like to give to the little girls." In his palm lay two lumps of\r\nsoft blue stone, the colour of robins\' eggs, or of the sea on halcyon\r\ndays of summer.\r\n\r\nThe children marvelled. "Oh, what are they?"\r\n\r\n"Turquoises, just the way they come out of the mine, before the\r\njewellers have tampered with them and made them look green. The Indians\r\nlike them this way."\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. St. Peter demurred. She told him very kindly that she\r\ncouldn\'t let him give his stones to the children. "They are worth a lot\r\nof money."\r\n\r\n"I\'d never sell them. They were given to me by a friend. I have a lot,\r\nand they\'re no use to me, but they\'ll make pretty playthings for little\r\ngirls." His voice was so wistful and winning that there was nothing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n"Hold them still a moment," said the Professor, looking down, not at the\r\nturquoises, but at the hand that held them: the muscular, many-lined\r\npalm, the long, strong fingers with soft ends, the straight little\r\nfinger, the flexible, beautifully shaped thumb that curved back from the\r\nrest of the hand as if it were its own master. What a hand! He could see\r\nit yet, with the blue stones lying in it.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the stranger was gone, and the St. Peter family sat down and\r\nlooked at one another. He remembered just what his wife had said on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is something new in students, Godfrey. We ask a poor\r\nperspiring tramp boy to lunch, to save his pennies, and he departs\r\nleaving princely gifts."\r\n\r\nYes, the Professor reflected, after all these years, that was still\r\ntrue. Fellows like Outland don\'t carry much luggage, yet one of the\r\nthings you know them by is their sumptuous generosity--and when they are\r\ngone, all you can say of them is that they departed leaving princely\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nWith a good tutor, young Outland had no difficulty in making up three\r\nyears\' mathematics in four months. Latin, he owned, had been hard for\r\nhim. But in mathematics, he didn\'t have to work, he had merely to give\r\nhis attention. His tutor had never known anything like it. But St. Peter\r\nheld the boy at arm\'s length. As a young teacher full of zeal, he had\r\nbeen fooled more than once. He knew that the wonderful seldom holds\r\nwater, that brilliancy has no staying power, and the unusual becomes\r\ncommonplace by a natural law.\r\n\r\nIn those first months Mrs. St. Peter saw more of their prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 than\r\nher husband did. She found him a good boarding-place, took care that he\r\nhad proper summer clothes and that he no longer addressed her as\r\n"Ma\'am." He came often to the house that summer, to play with the little\r\ngirls. He would spend hours with them in the garden, making Hopi\r\nvillages with sand and pebbles, drawing maps of the Painted Desert and\r\nthe Rio Grande country in the gravel, telling them stories, when there\r\nwas no one by to listen, about the adventures he had had with his friend\r\nRoddy.\r\n\r\n"Mother," Kathleen broke out one evening at dinner, "what do you think!\r\nTom hasn\'t any birthday."\r\n\r\n"How is that?"\r\n\r\n"When his mother died in the mover wagon, and Tom was a baby, she forgot\r\nto tell the O\'Briens when his birthday was. She even forgot to tell them\r\nhow old he was. They thought he must be a year and a half, because he\r\nwas so big, but Mrs. O\'Brien always said he didn\'t have enough teeth for\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter asked her whether Tom had ever said how it happened that his\r\nmother died in a wagon.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, she was very sick, and they were going West for her\r\nhealth. And one day, when they were camped beside a river, Tom\'s father\r\nwent in to swim, and had a cramp or something, and was drowned. Tom\'s\r\nmother saw it, and it made her worse. She was there all alone, till some\r\npeople found her and drove her on to the next town to a doctor. But when\r\nthey got her there, she was too sick to leave the wagon. They drove her\r\ninto the O\'Briens\' yard, because that was nearest the doctor\'s and Mrs.\r\nO\'Brien was a kind woman. And she died in a few hours."\r\n\r\n"Does Tom know anything about his father?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing except that he was a school-teacher in Missouri. His mother\r\ntold the O\'Briens that much. But the O\'Briens were just lovely to him."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had noticed that in the stories Tom told the children there\r\nwere no shadows. Kathleen and Rosamond regarded his free-lance childhood\r\nas a gay adventure they would gladly have shared. They loved to play at\r\nbeing Tom and Roddy. Roddy was the remarkable friend, ten years older\r\nthan Tom, who knew everything about snakes and panthers and deserts and\r\nIndians. "And he gave up a fine job firing on the Santa F\xc3\xa9, and went\r\noff with Tom to ride after cattle for hardly any wages, just to be with\r\nTom and take care of him after he\'d had pneumonia," Kathleen told them.\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t the only reason," Rosamond added dreamily. "Roddy was\r\nproud. He didn\'t like taking orders and living on pay cheques. He liked\r\nto be free, and to sit in his saddle all day and use it for a pillow at\r\nnight. You know Tom said that, Kitty."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, he was noble. He was always noble, noble Roddy!" Kathleen\r\nfinished it off.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day, when he had walked into the garden and introduced\r\nhimself, Tom never took up the story of his own life again, either with\r\nthe Professor or Mrs. St. Peter, though he was often encouraged to do\r\nso. He would talk about the New Mexico country when questioned, about\r\nFather Duchene, the missionary priest who had been his teacher, about\r\nthe Indians; but only with the two little girls did he ever speak freely\r\nand confidentially about himself. St. Peter used to wonder how the boy\r\ncould afford to spend so much time with the children. All through that\r\nsummer and fall he used to come in the afternoon and join them in the\r\ngarden. In the winter he dropped in two or three evenings a week to play\r\nFive Hundred or to take a dancing-lesson.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently something enchanting about the atmosphere of the\r\nhouse to a boy who had always lived a rough life. He enjoyed the\r\nprettiness and freshness and gaiety of the little girls as if they were\r\nflowers. Probably, too, he liked being so attractive to them. A flush of\r\npleasure would come over Tom\'s face--so much fairer now than when he\r\nfirst arrived in Hamilton--if Kathleen caught his hand and tried to\r\nsqueeze it hard enough to hurt, crying: "Oh, Tom, _tell_ us about the\r\ntime you and Roddy found the water hole dry, and then afterward tell us\r\nabout when the rattlesnake bit Henry!" He would whisper: "Pretty soon,"\r\nand after a while, through the open windows, the Professor would hear\r\nthem in the garden: the laughter and exclamations of the little girls,\r\nand that singularly individual voice of Tom\'s--mature, confident, seldom\r\nvarying in pitch, but full of slight, very moving modulations.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have wished for a better companion for his daughters, and\r\nthey were teaching Tom things that he needed more than mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting thus in his study, long afterward, St. Peter reflected that\r\nthose first years, before Outland had done anything remarkable, were\r\nreally the best of all. He liked to remember the charming groups of\r\nthree he was always coming upon,--in the hammock swung between the\r\nlinden-trees, in the window-seat, or before the dining-room fire. Oh,\r\nthere had been fine times in this old house then: family festivals and\r\nhospitalities, little girls dancing in and out, Augusta coming and\r\ngoing, gay dresses hanging in his study at night, Christmas shopping and\r\nsecrets and smothered laughter on the stairs. When a man had lovely\r\nchildren in his house, fragrant and happy, full of pretty fancies and\r\ngenerous impulses, why couldn\'t he keep them? Was there no way but\r\nMedea\'s, he wondered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had come in late from an afternoon lecture, and had just\r\nlighted his kerosene lamp to go to work, when he heard a light foot\r\nascending the stairs. In a moment Kathleen\'s voice called: "May I\r\ninterrupt for a moment, Papa?"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and drew her in.\r\n\r\n"Kitty, do you remember the time you sat out there with your bee-sting\r\nand your bottle? Nobody ever showed me more consideration than that, not\r\neven your mother."\r\n\r\nKathleen threw her hat and jacket into the sewing-chair and walked\r\nabout, touching things to see how dusty they were. "I\'ve been wondering\r\nif you didn\'t need me to come in and clean house for you, but it\'s not\r\nso bad as they report it. This is the first time I\'ve called on you\r\nsince you\'ve been here alone. I\'ve turned in from the walk more than\r\nonce, but I\'ve always run away again." She paused to warm her hands at\r\nthe little stove. "I\'m silly, you know; such queer things make me blue.\r\nAnd you still have Augusta\'s old forms. I don\'t think anything ever\r\nhappened to her that amused her so much. And now, you know, she\'s quite\r\nsentimental about their being here. It\'s about Augusta that I came,\r\nPapa. Did you know that she had lost some of her savings in the Kinkoo\r\nCopper Company?"\r\n\r\n"Augusta? Are you sure? What a shame!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She was sewing for me last week. I noticed that she seemed\r\ndepressed and hadn\'t much appetite for lunch--which, you know, is\r\nunusual for Augusta. She was ashamed to tell any of us about it, because\r\nit seems she\'d asked Louie\'s advice, and he told her not to invest in\r\nthat company. But a lot of the people in her church were putting money\r\ninto it, and of course that made it seem all right to her. She lost five\r\nhundred dollars, a fortune for her, and Scott says she\'ll never get a\r\ncent of it back."\r\n\r\n"Five hundred dollars," murmured St. Peter. "Let me see, at three\r\ndollars a day that means one hundred and sixty-six days. Now what can we\r\ndo about it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course we must do something. I knew you\'d feel that way, Father."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Among us, we must cover it. I\'ll speak to Rosamond\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t, dear." Kathleen tossed her head. "I have been to her. She\r\nrefuses."\r\n\r\n"Refuses? She can\'t refuse, my dear. I\'ll have a word to say." The\r\nfirmness of his tone, and the quick rush of claret colour under his\r\nskin, were a gratification to his daughter.\r\n\r\n"She says that Louie took the trouble to speak to his banker and to\r\nseveral copper men before he advised Augusta; and that if she doesn\'t\r\nlearn her lesson this time, she will do the same thing over again.\r\nRosamond said they would do something for Augusta later, but she didn\'t\r\nsay what."\r\n\r\n"Leave Rosamond to me. I\'ll convince her."\r\n\r\n"Even if you can do anything with her, she\'s determined to make Augusta\r\nadmit her folly, and it can\'t be done that way. Augusta is terribly\r\nproud. When I told her customers ought to make it up to her, she was\r\nvery haughty and said she wasn\'t that kind of a sewing-woman; that she\r\ngave her ladies good measure for their money. Scott thought we could buy\r\nstock in some good company and tell her we had used our influence and\r\ngot an exchange, but that she must keep quiet about it. We could manage\r\nsome such little fib, she knows so little about business. I know I can\r\nget the Dudleys and the Browns to help. We needn\'t go to the\r\nMarselluses."\r\n\r\n"Wait a few days. It\'s a disgrace to us as a family not to make it up\r\nourselves. On her own account, we oughtn\'t to let Rosamond out. She\'s\r\naltogether too blind to responsibilities of that kind. In a world full\r\nof blunderers, why should Augusta have to pay scrupulously for her\r\nmistakes? It\'s very petty of Rosie, really!"\r\n\r\nKathleen started to speak, stopped and turned away. "Scott will give a\r\nhundred dollars," she said a moment later.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very generous of him. I\'ll give another, and Rosie shall make up\r\nthe rest. If she doesn\'t, I\'ll speak to Louie. He\'s an absolutely\r\ngenerous chap. I\'ve never known him to refuse to give either time or\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nKathleen\'s eyes suddenly brightened. "Why, Daddy, you have Tom\'s Mexican\r\nblanket! I never knew he gave it to you. I\'ve often wondered what became\r\nof it." She picked up from the foot of the box-couch a purple blanket,\r\nfaded in streaks to amethyst, with a pale yellow stripe at either end.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I often get chilly when I lie down, especially if I turn the\r\nstove out, which your mother says I ought always to do. Nothing could\r\npart me from that blanket."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t have given it to anybody but you. It was like his skin. Do\r\nyou remember how horsey it smelled when he first brought it over and\r\nshowed it to us?"\r\n\r\n"Just like a livery stable! It had been strapped behind the saddle on so\r\nmany sweating cow-ponies. In damp weather that smell is still\r\nperceptible."\r\n\r\nKathleen stroked it thoughtfully. "Roddy brought it up from Old Mexico,\r\nyou know. He gave it to Tom that winter he had pneumonia. Tom ought to\r\nhave taken it to France with him. He used to say that Rodney Blake might\r\nturn up in the Foreign Legion. If he had taken this, it might have been\r\nlike the wooden cups that were always revealing _Amis_ and _Amile_ to\r\neach other."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter smiled and patted her hand on the blanket. "Do you know,\r\nKitty, I sometimes think I ought to go out and look for Blake myself.\r\nHe\'s on my conscience. If that country down there weren\'t so\r\neverlastingly big----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Father! That was my romantic dream when I was little, finding\r\nRoddy! I used to think about it for hours when I was supposed to be\r\ntaking my nap. I used to swim rivers and climb mountains and wander\r\nabout with Navajos, and rescue Roddy at the most critical moments, when\r\nhe was being stabbed in the back, or drugged in a gambling-house, and\r\nbring him back to Tom. You know Tom told us about him long before he\r\never told you."\r\n\r\n"You children used to live in his stories. You cared more about them\r\nthan about all your adventure books."\r\n\r\n"I still do," said Kathleen, rising. "Now that Rosamond has Outland, I\r\nconsider Tom\'s mesa entirely my own."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter put down the cigarette he had just lighted with anticipation.\r\n"Can\'t you stay awhile, Kitty? I almost never see anyone who remembers\r\nthat side of Tom. It was nice, all those years when he was in and out of\r\nthe house like an older brother. Always very different from the other\r\ncollege boys, wasn\'t he? Always had something in his voice, in his eyes\r\n. . . One seemed to catch glimpses of an unusual background behind his\r\nshoulders when he came into the room."\r\n\r\nKathleen smiled wanly. "Yes, and now he\'s all turned out chemicals and\r\ndollars and cents, hasn\'t he? But not for you and me! Our Tom is much\r\nnicer than theirs." She put on her jacket and went out of the study and\r\nquickly down the stairs. Her father, on the landing, looked after her\r\nuntil she disappeared. When she was gone he still stood there,\r\nmotionless, as if he were listening intently, or trying to fasten upon\r\nsome fugitive idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter was breakfasting at six-thirty, alone, reading last night\'s\r\nletters while he waited for the coffee to percolate. It had been long\r\nsince he had had an eight o\'clock class, but this year the schedule\r\ncommittee had slyly put him down for one. "He can afford to take a taxi\r\nover now," the Dean remarked.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he went upstairs and into his wife\'s room. "I have a\r\nrendezvous with a lady," he said, tossing an envelope upon her\r\ncounterpane. She read a note from Mrs. Crane, the least attractive of\r\nthe faculty ladies, requesting an interview with the Professor at his\r\nearliest convenience: as she wished to see him quite alone, might she\r\ncome to his study in the old house, where she understood he still\r\nworked?\r\n\r\n"Poor Godfrey!" murmured his wife.\r\n\r\n"One ought not to joke about it----" St. Peter went into his own room to\r\nget a handkerchief and came back, taking up his suspended sentence. "I\'m\r\nafraid it means poor Crane is coming up for another operation. Or, worse\r\nstill, that the surgeons tell her another would be useless. It\'s like\r\n_The Pit and the Pendulum._ I feel as if the poor fellow were strapped\r\ndown on a revolving disk that comes around under the knife just so\r\noften."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter looked judicially at the letter, then at her husband\'s\r\nback. She didn\'t believe that surgery would be the subject of discussion\r\nwhen they met. Mrs. Crane had been behaving very strangely of late.\r\n\r\nDoctor Crane had married a girl whom no other man ever thought of\r\ncourting, a girl of whom people always said: "Oh, she\'s so _good!_"\r\nchiefly because she was so homely. They had three very plain daughters,\r\nand only Crane\'s salary to live upon. Doctors and surgeons kept them\r\npoor enough.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter kissed his wife and went forth quite unconscious of what was\r\ngoing on in her mind. During the morning he telephoned Mrs. Crane, and\r\narranged a meeting with her at five o\'clock. As the bell in the old\r\nhouse didn\'t work now, he waited downstairs on the front porch, to\r\nreceive his visitor and conduct her up to his study. It was raining\r\ndrearily, and Mrs. Crane arrived in a rubber coat, and a knitted sport\r\nhat belonging to one of her daughters. St. Peter took her wet umbrella\r\nand led her up the two flights of stairs.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not very well appointed to receive ladies, Mrs. Crane. This was the\r\nsewing-room, you know. There\'s Augusta\'s chair, which she insisted was\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." Mrs. Crane sat down, took off her gloves, and tucked wisps\r\nof damp hair up under her crocheted hat. Her bleak, plain face wore an\r\nexpression of grievance.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come without my husband\'s knowledge, Doctor St. Peter, to ask you\r\nwhat you think can be done about our rights in the Outland patent. You\r\nknow how my husband\'s health has crippled us financially, and we never\r\nknow when his trouble may come on worse again. Myself, I\'ve never\r\ndoubted that you would see it is only right to share with us."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter looked at her in amazement. "But, my dear Mrs. Crane, how can\r\nI share with you what I haven\'t got? Tom willed his estate and royalties\r\nin a perfectly regular way. The fact that he named my daughter as his\r\nsole beneficiary doesn\'t affect me, any more than if he had named some\r\nrelative of his own. I tell you frankly, I have never received one\r\ndollar from the Outland patent."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all the same if it goes to your family, Doctor St. Peter. My\r\nhusband must be considered in this matter. He spent days and nights\r\nworking with Outland. Tom never could have worked his theory out without\r\nRobert\'s help. He said so, more than once, in my presence and in the\r\npresence of others."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe that, Mrs. Crane. But the difficulty is that Tom didn\'t\r\nmake any recognition of that assistance in his will."\r\n\r\nMrs. Crane had set her head and advanced her long chin with meek\r\ndetermination. "Well, this is how it was, Professor. Mr. Marsellus came\r\nhere a stranger, to put in the Edison power plant, just at the time the\r\ncity was stirred up about Outland\'s being killed at the front. Everybody\r\nwas wanting to do something in recognition of the young man. You brought\r\nMr. Marsellus to our house and introduced him. After that he came alone,\r\nagain and again, and he got round my husband. Robert thought he was\r\ndisinterested, and was only taking a scientific interest, and he told\r\nhim a great deal about what he and Outland had been working on. Then\r\nRosamond\'s lawyers came for the papers. Tom Outland had no laboratory of\r\nhis own. He was allowed the use of a room in the physics building, at my\r\nhusband\'s request. He wanted to be there, because he constantly needed\r\nRobert\'s help. The first thing we knew, your daughter\'s engagement to\r\nMarsellus was announced, and then we heard that all Outland\'s papers had\r\nbeen given over to him."\r\n\r\nHere St. Peter anticipated her. "But, Mrs. Crane, your husband couldn\'t,\r\nand wouldn\'t, have kept Tom\'s papers. They had to be given over to his\r\nexecutor, who was my daughter\'s attorney."\r\n\r\n"Well, I could have kept them, if he couldn\'t!"--Mrs. Crane threw up her\r\nhead as if to show that the worm had turned at last--"kept them until\r\njustice was done us, and some recognition had been made of my husband\'s\r\npart in all that research work. If he had taken the papers to court\r\nthen, with all the evidence we have, we could easily have got an equity.\r\nBut Mr. Marsellus is very smooth. He flattered Robert and got everything\r\nthere was."\r\n\r\n"But he didn\'t get anything from your husband. Outland\'s papers and\r\napparatus were delivered to his executor, as was inevitable."\r\n\r\n"That was a poor subterfuge," said Mrs. Crane, with deep meaning. "You\r\nknow how unworldly Robert is, and as an old friend you might have warned\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Of what, Mrs. Crane?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that Marsellus saw there was a fortune in the gas my husband and\r\nhis pupil had made, and we could have asked for our equity before we\r\ngave your son-in-law a free hand with everything."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter felt very unhappy. He began walking up and down the little\r\nroom. "Heaven knows I\'d like to see Crane get something out of it, but\r\nhow? How? I\'ve thought a great deal about this matter, and I\'ve blamed\r\nTom for making that kind of will. I don\'t think it occurred to the boy\r\nthat the will would ever be probated. He expected to come back from the\r\nwar and develop the thing himself. I doubt whether Robert, with all his\r\nsuperior knowledge, would have known the twists and turns by which the\r\npatent could be commercialized. It took a great deal of work and a\r\nspecial kind of ability to do that."\r\n\r\n"A salesman\'s ability!" Mrs. Crane was becoming nasty.\r\n\r\n"If you like; but certainly Robert would have been no man to convince\r\nmanufacturers and machinists, any more than I would. A great deal of\r\nmoney was put into it, too, before any came back; every cent Marsellus\r\nhad, and all he could borrow. He took heavy chances. Crane and I\r\ntogether could never have raised a hundredth part of the capital that\r\nwas necessary to get the thing started. Without capital to make it go,\r\nTom\'s idea was merely a formula written out on paper. It had lain for\r\ntwo years in your husband\'s laboratory, and would have lain there for\r\nyears more before he or I would have done anything about it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Crane\'s dreary face took on more animation than he had supposed it\r\ncapable of. "It had lain there because it belonged there, and was made\r\nthere! My husband was done out of it by an adventurer, and his\r\nfriendship for you tied his hands. I must say you\'ve shown very little\r\nconsideration for him. You might have warned us never to let those\r\npapers go. You see Robert getting weaker all the time and having those\r\nterrible operations, and our girls going shabby and teaching in the ward\r\nschools, and Rosamond riding about in a limousine and building country\r\nhouses,--and you do nothing about it. You take your honours--you\'ve\r\ndeserved them, we never forget that--and move into your new house, and\r\nyou don\'t remember what it is to be in straitened circumstances."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter drew his chair nearer to Mrs. Crane, and addressed her\r\npatiently. "Mrs. Crane, if you had any legal rights in the patent, I\'d\r\ndefend them against Rosamond as soon as against anyone else. I think she\r\nought to recognize Dr. Crane\'s long friendship and helpfulness to Tom in\r\nsome way. I don\'t see just how it can be done, but I feel it should be.\r\nAnd if you wish, I\'ll tell Rosamond how I feel. Why don\'t you put this\r\nmatter before her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care to ask anything of Mrs. Marsellus. I wrote her some time\r\nago, and she replied to me through her lawyer, saying that all claims\r\nagainst the Outland patent would be considered in due order. It\'s not\r\nworthy of a man in Robert\'s position to accept hush money from the\r\nMarselluses. We want justice, and my brother is confident the court will\r\ngive it to us."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose Bright knows more about what the courts will do than I.\r\nBut if you\'ve decided to go to law about it, why did you come to me?"\r\n\r\n"There are some things the law don\'t cover," said Mrs. Crane\r\nmysteriously, as she rose and put on her gloves. "I wanted you to know\r\nhow we feel about it."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter followed her downstairs and put up her umbrella for her, and\r\nthen went back to his study to think it over. His friendship with Crane\r\nhad been a strange one. Out in the world they would almost certainly\r\nhave kept clear of each other; but in the university they had fought\r\ntogether in a common cause. Both, with all their might, had resisted the\r\nnew commercialism, the aim to "show results" that was undermining and\r\nvulgarizing education. The State Legislature and the board of regents\r\nseemed determined to make a trade school of the university. Candidates\r\nfor the degree of Bachelor of Arts were allowed credits for commercial\r\nstudies; courses in book-keeping, experimental farming, domestic\r\nscience, dress-making, and what not. Every year the regents tried to\r\ndiminish the number of credits required in science and the humanities.\r\nThe liberal appropriations, the promotions and increases in salary, all\r\nwent to the professors who worked with the regents to abolish the purely\r\ncultural studies. Out of a faculty of sixty, there were perhaps twenty\r\nmen who made any serious stand for scholarship, and Robert Crane was one\r\nof the staunchest. He had lost the Deanship of the College of Science\r\nbecause of his uncompromising opposition to the degrading influence of\r\npoliticians in university affairs. The honour went, instead, to a much\r\nyounger man, head of the department of chemistry, who was willing "to\r\ngive the taxpayers what they wanted."\r\n\r\nThe struggle to preserve the dignity of the university, and their own,\r\nhad brought St. Peter and Dr. Crane much together. They were, moreover,\r\nthe only two men on the faculty who were doing research work of an\r\nuncommercial nature, and they occasionally dropped in on one another to\r\nexchange ideas. But that was as far as it went. St. Peter couldn\'t ask\r\nCrane to dinner; the presence of a bottle of claret on the table would\r\nhave made him uncomfortable. Dr. Crane had all the prejudices of the\r\nBaptist community in which he grew up. He carried them with him when he\r\nwent to study at a German university, and brought them back. But Crane\r\nknew that none of his colleagues followed his work so closely, and\r\nrejoiced at his little triumphs so heartily, as St. Peter.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter couldn\'t help admiring the man\'s courage; poor, ill,\r\noverworked, held by his conscience to a generous discharge of his duties\r\nas a teacher, he was all the while carrying on these tedious and\r\ndelicate experiments that had to do with determining the extent of\r\nspace. Fortunately, Crane seemed to have no social needs or impulses. He\r\nnever went anywhere, except, once or twice a year, to a dinner at the\r\nPresident\'s house. Music disturbed him too much, dancing shocked him--he\r\ncouldn\'t see why it was permitted among the students. Once, after Mrs.\r\nSt. Peter had sat next him at the President\'s dinner-table, she said to\r\nher husband: "The man is too dreary! All evening his heavy underwear\r\nkept coming down below his cuffs, and he kept poking it bade with his\r\nfore-finger. I believe he thinks it\'s wicked to live with even so plain\r\na woman as Mrs. Crane."\r\n\r\nAfter Tom Outland graduated from the university, he and Dr. Crane worked\r\nside by side in the Physics building for several years. The older man\r\nhad been of great assistance to the younger, without doubt. Though that\r\nkind of help, the result of criticism and suggestion, is not easily\r\nreckoned in percentages, still St. Peter thought Crane ought to get\r\nsomething out of the patent. He resolved to see Louie about it. But\r\nfirst he had better talk with Crane himself, and try to dissuade him\r\nfrom going to law. His brother-in-law, Homer Bright, would be tempted by\r\nthe publicity which an action involving the Outland patent would\r\ncertainly bring him. But he would lose the case, and Crane would get\r\nnothing. Whereas Louie, if he were properly approached, would be\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter looked at his watch. He would go home now, and after dinner he\r\nwould walk over to the Physics building, where his colleague worked\r\nevery night. He never went to see Crane at his house if he could help\r\nit. He lived in the most depressing and unnecessary ugliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dinner Lillian asked him no questions about his interview with Mrs.\r\nCrane, and he volunteered no information. She was not surprised,\r\nhowever, when he said he would not stop for a cigar, as he was going\r\nover to the Physics laboratory.\r\n\r\nHe walked through the park, past the old house and across the north end\r\nof the campus, to a building that stood off by itself in a grove of\r\npine-trees. It was constructed of red brick, after an English model. The\r\narchitect had had a good idea, and he very nearly succeeded in making a\r\ngood thing, something like the old Smithsonian building in Washington.\r\nBut after it was begun, the State Legislature had defeated him by\r\ngrinding down the contractor to cheap execution, and had spoiled\r\neverything, outside and in. Ever since it was finished, plumbers and\r\nmasons and carpenters had been kept busy patching and repairing it.\r\nCrane and St. Peter, both young men then, had wasted weeks of time with\r\nthe contractors, and had finally gone before the Legislative committee\r\nin person to plead for the integrity of that building. But nothing came\r\nof all their pains. It was one of many lost causes.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter entered the building and went upstairs to a small room at the\r\nend of a chain of laboratories. After knocking, he heard the familiar\r\nshuffle of Crane\'s carpet slippers, and the door opened.\r\n\r\nCrane was wearing a grey cotton coat, shrunk to a rag by washing, though\r\nhe wasn\'t working with fluids or batteries to-night, but at a roll-top\r\ndesk littered with papers. The room was like any study behind a lecture\r\nroom; dusty books, dusty files, but no apparatus--except a spirit-lamp\r\nand a little saucepan in which the physicist heated water for his cocoa\r\nat regular intervals. He was working by the glare of an unshaded\r\nelectric bulb of high power--the man seemed to have no feeling for\r\ncomfort of any kind. He asked his visitor to sit down, and to excuse him\r\nfor a moment while he copied some entries into a note-book.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter watched him scribbling with his fountain pen. The hands that\r\nwere so deft in delicate manipulations were white and soft-looking; the\r\nfingers long and loosely hung, stained with chemicals, and blunted at\r\nthe tips like a violinist\'s. His head was square, and the lower part of\r\nhis face was covered by a reddish, matted beard. His pale eyes and\r\nfawn-coloured eyebrows were outbalanced by his mouth, his most\r\nconspicuous feature. One always remembered about Crane that unexpected,\r\nstartling red mouth in a setting of kinky beard. The lips had no\r\nmodelling, they were as thick at the corners as in the middle, and he\r\nspoke through them rather than with them. He seemed painfully conscious\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter saw no use in beating about the bush. As soon as Crane put\r\ndown his pen, he remarked that Mrs. Crane had been to see him that\r\nafternoon. His colleague flushed, took up a large celluloid paper-knife,\r\nand began shutting and unshutting his hands about the blade.\r\n\r\n"I want to know exactly how you feel about this, and what the facts\r\nare," St. Peter began. "We\'ve never discussed it before, and there may\r\nbe things I know nothing about. Did Tom ever say that he meant you to\r\nhave a share in his profits, if there were any?"\r\n\r\n"No, not exactly. Not exactly that." Dr. Crane moved his shoulders about\r\nin his tight coat and looked embarrassed and unhappy. "More than once he\r\nsaid, in a general way, that he hoped it would go, on my account as well\r\nas on his own, and that we would use the income for further\r\nexperiments."\r\n\r\n"Did he talk much about the possible commercial value of the gas while\r\nhe was trying to make it?"\r\n\r\n"Not much. No, very seldom. Perhaps not more than half a dozen times in\r\nthe three years he was working in my laboratory. But whenever he did, he\r\nspoke as if there would be something in it for both of us if our gas\r\nbecame remunerative."\r\n\r\n"Just how much was it \'our gas,\' Crane?"\r\n\r\n"Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn\'t. The idea was Outland\'s. He\r\nbenefited by my criticism, and I often helped him with his experiments.\r\nHe never acquired a nice laboratory technic. He would fail repeatedly in\r\nsome perfectly sound experiment because of careless procedure."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he would have arrived at his results without your help?"\r\n\r\nDr. Crane was clenching the paper-knife with both hands. "That I cannot\r\nsay. He was impatient. He might have got discouraged and turned to\r\nsomething else. He would have been much slower in getting his results,\r\nat any rate. His conception was right, but very delicate manipulation\r\nwas necessary, and he was a careless experimentor."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter felt that this was becoming nothing less than\r\ncross-examination. He tried to change the tone of it.\r\n\r\n"I want to see you get recognition and compensation for whatever part\r\nyou had in his experiments, if there\'s any way to get it. But you\'ve\r\nbeen neglectful, Crane. You haven\'t taken the proper steps. Why in the\r\nworld didn\'t you have some understanding with Tom when he was getting\r\nhis patent? You knew all about it."\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t occur to me then. We\'d finished the experiments, and I put\r\nthem out of my mind. I was trying to concentrate on my own work. His\r\nresults weren\'t as interesting scientifically as I\'d expected them to\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"While his manuscripts and formulae were lying here those two years, did\r\nyou ever make the gas, or give any study to its behaviour?"\r\n\r\n"No, of course not. It\'s off my own line, and didn\'t interest me."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s only since this patent has begun to make money that it does\r\ninterest you?"\r\n\r\nDr. Crane twisted his shoulders. "Yes. It\'s the money."\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows I\'d like to see you get some of it. But why did you put it\r\noff so long? Why didn\'t you make some claim when you delivered the\r\npapers to his executor, since you hadn\'t done so before? Why didn\'t you\r\nbring the matter up to me then, and let me make a claim against the\r\nestate for you?"\r\n\r\nDr. Crane could endure his chair no longer. He began to walk softly\r\nabout in his slippers, looking at nothing, but, as he talked, picking up\r\nobjects here and there,--drawing-tools, his cocoa-cup, a china\r\ncream-pitcher, turning them round and carefully putting them down again,\r\njust as he often absently handled pieces of apparatus when he was\r\nlecturing.\r\n\r\n"I know," he said, "appearances are against me. But you must understand\r\nmy negligence. You know how little opportunity a man has to carry on his\r\nown line of investigation here. You know how much time I give to any of\r\nmy students who are doing honest work. Outland was, of course, the most\r\nbrilliant pupil I ever had, and I gave him time and thought without\r\nstint. Gladly, of course. If he were reaping the rewards of his\r\ndiscovery himself, I\'d have nothing to say--though I\'ve not the least\r\ndoubt he would compensate me liberally. But it does not seem right that\r\na stranger should profit, and not those who helped him. You, of course,\r\ndo profit--indirectly, if not directly. You cannot shut your eyes to the\r\nfact that this money, coming into your family, has strengthened your\r\ncredit and your general security. That\'s as it should be. But your claim\r\nwas less definite than mine. I spent time and strength I could ill\r\nafford to spare on the very series of experiments that led to this\r\nresult. Marsellus gets the benefit of my work as well as of Outland\'s.\r\nI have certainly been ill-used--and, as you say, it\'s difficult to get\r\nrecompense when I ask for it so late. It\'s not to my discredit,\r\ncertainly, that I didn\'t take measures to protect my interests. I never\r\nthought of my student\'s work in terms of money. There were others who\r\ndid, and I was not considered," he concluded bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you put in a claim to Marsellus, for your time and expert\r\nadvice? I think he\'d honour it. He is going to live here. He probably\r\ndoesn\'t wish to be more unpopular than a suddenly prosperous man is\r\nbound to be, and you have many friends. I believe I can convince him\r\nthat it would be poor policy to disregard any reasonable demand."\r\n\r\n"I had thought of that. But my wife\'s brother advises a different\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. Mrs. Crane said something of that sort. Well, Crane, if you\'re\r\ngoing to law about it, I hope you\'ll consult a sound lawyer, and you\r\nknow as well as I that Homer Bright is not one."\r\n\r\nDr. Crane coloured and bridled. "I\'m sure you are disinterested, St.\r\nPeter, but, frankly, I think your judgment has been warped by events.\r\nYou don\'t realize how clear the matter is to unprejudiced minds. Though\r\nI\'m such an unpractical man, I have evidence to rest my claims upon."\r\n\r\n"The more the better, if you are going to depend on such a windbag as\r\nBright. If you go to law, I\'d like to see you win your case."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter said good-night, went down the stairs, and out through the\r\ndark pine-trees. Evidence, Crane said; probably letters Tom had written\r\nhim during the winter he was working at Johns Hopkins. Well, there was\r\nnothing to be done, unless he could get old Dr. Hutchins to persuade\r\nCrane to employ an intelligent lawyer. Homer Bright\'s rhetoric might\r\ninfluence a jury in a rape or bigamy case, but it would antagonize a\r\njudge in an equity court.\r\n\r\nThe Professor took a turn in the park before going home. The interview\r\nhad depressed him, and he was afraid he might be wakeful. He had never\r\nseen his colleague in such an unbecoming light before. Crane was narrow,\r\nbut he was straight; a man you could count on in the shifty game of\r\ncollege politics. He had never been out to get anything for himself. St.\r\nPeter would have said that nothing about the vulgar success of Outland\'s\r\nidea could possibly matter to Crane, beyond gratifying his pride as a\r\nteacher and friend.\r\n\r\nThe park was deserted. The arc-lights were turned off. The leafless\r\ntrees stood quite motionless in the light of the clear stars. The world\r\nwas sad to St. Peter as he looked about him; the lake-shore country flat\r\nand heavy, Hamilton small and tight and airless. The university, his new\r\nhouse, his old house, everything around him, seemed insupportable, as\r\nthe boat on which he is imprisoned seems to a seasick man. Yes, it was\r\npossible that the little world, on its voyage among all the stars, might\r\nbecome like that; a boat on which one could travel no longer, from which\r\none could no longer look up and confront those bright rings or\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nHe brought himself back with a jerk. Ah, yes, Crane; that was the\r\ntrouble. If Outland were here to-night, he might say with Mark Antony,\r\n_My fortunes have corrupted honest men._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, St. Peter went to Chicago with Rosamond to\r\nhelp her buy things for her country house. He had very much wanted to\r\nstay at home and rest--the university work seemed to take it out of him\r\nthat winter more than ever before; but Rosamond had set her mind on his\r\ngoing, and Mrs. St. Peter told him he couldn\'t refuse. A Chicago\r\nmerchant had brought over a lot of old Spanish furniture, and on this\r\nnobody\'s judgment would be better than St. Peter\'s. He was supposed to\r\nknow a good deal about rugs, too. When his wife said a thing must be\r\ndone, the Professor usually did it, from long-established habit. Her\r\ninstincts about what one owed to other people were better than his.\r\n\r\nLouie accompanied them to Chicago, where he was to join his brother, the\r\none who was in the silk trade in China, and go on to New York with him\r\nfor a family reunion. St. Peter was amused, and pleased, to see that\r\nLouie sincerely hated to leave them--with very little encouragement he\r\nwould have sent his brother on alone and remained in Chicago with his\r\nwife and father-in-law. They all lunched together, after which the\r\nProfessor and Rosamond took the Marsellus brothers to the LaSalle Street\r\nstation. When Louie had again and again kissed his hand to them from the\r\nrear platform of the Twentieth Century observation car, and was rolled\r\naway in the very act of shouting something to his wife, St. Peter, who\r\nhad so often complained that there was too much Louie in his life, now\r\nfelt a sudden drop, a distinct sense of loss.\r\n\r\nHe took Rosamond\'s arm, and they turned away from the shining rails. "We\r\nmust be diligent, Rosie. He expects wonders of us."\r\n\r\n\r\nScott McGregor got on the Blue Bird Express one afternoon, returning\r\nfrom a business trip for his paper. On entering the smoking-car, he came\r\nupon his father-in-law lying back in a leather chair, his clothes\r\ncovered with dust, his eyes closed, a dead cigar hanging between the\r\nrelaxed lingers of his dark, muscular hand. It gave Scott a start; he\r\nthought the Professor didn\'t look well.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Doctor! What are you doing here? Oh, yes! the shopping\r\nexpedition. Where\'s Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"In Chicago. At the Blackstone."\r\n\r\n"Outlasted you, did she?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it." The Professor smiled apologetically, as if he were ashamed\r\nto admit it.\r\n\r\nScott sat down beside him and tried to interest him in one subject after\r\nanother, without success. It occurred to him that he had never before\r\nseen the Professor when he seemed absolutely flattened out and listless.\r\nThat was a bad sign; he was glad they were only half an hour from\r\nHamilton. "The old chap needs rest," he reflected. "Rosamond\'s run him\r\nto death in Chicago. He oughtn\'t to be used as a courier, anyhow! I\'m\r\ngoing to tell Kitty that we must look out for her father a little. The\r\nMarselluses have no mercy, and Lillian has always taken it for granted\r\nthat he was as strong as three men."\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Mrs. St. Peter was standing by the French windows in the\r\ndrawing-room, watching somewhat anxiously for her husband. The Chicago\r\ntrain was usually punctual, and surely he would have taken a cab from\r\nthe station, for it was a raw February night with a freezing wind\r\nblowing off the lake. St. Peter arrived on foot, however. As he came\r\nthrough the gate, she could see by his walk and the set of his shoulders\r\nthat he was very tired. She hurried to open the front door, and asked\r\nhim why he hadn\'t come up in a taxi.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t think of it, really. I\'m a creature of habit, and that\'s one of\r\nthe things I never used to do."\r\n\r\n"And in your lightest overcoat! I thought you only wore this one because\r\nyou were going to buy a new fur coat in Chicago."\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t," he said rather shortly. "Let\'s omit the verb \'to buy\'\r\nin all forms for a time. Keep dinner back a little, will you, Lillian? I\r\nwant to take a warm bath and dress. I did get rather chilled coming up."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter went to the kitchen, and, after a discreet interval,\r\nfollowed her husband upstairs and into his room.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'re tired, but tell me one thing: did you find the painted\r\nSpanish bedroom set?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes! Several of them."\r\n\r\n"And were they pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Very. At least, I think I\'d have found them so if I\'d come upon them\r\nwithout so many other things. Too much is certainly worse than too\r\nlittle--of anything. It turned out to be rather an orgy of acquisition."\r\n\r\n"Rosamond lost her head?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! Perfectly cool. I should say she had a faultless purchasing\r\nmanner. Wonder where a girl who grew up in that old house of ours ever\r\ngot it. She was like Napoleon looting the Italian palaces."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be harsh. You had a nice little vacation, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"A very expensive one, for a poor professor. And not much rest."\r\n\r\nA look of sharp anxiety came into Mrs. St. Peter\'s face. "You mean," she\r\nbreathed in a hushed voice, "that she let you----"\r\n\r\nHe cut in sharply. "I mean that I paid my way, as I hope always to be\r\nable to do. Any suggestion to the contrary might have been very\r\ngraceful, but it would have been rejected. I am quite ready to permit\r\nmyself a little extravagance to be of service to the women of my family.\r\nAny other arrangement is humiliating."\r\n\r\n"Then that was why you didn\'t get your fur coat."\r\n\r\n"That may have been one reason. I was not much in the humour for it."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter went swiftly downstairs to make him a cocktail. She\r\nsensed an unusual weariness in him, and felt, as it were, the bitter\r\ntaste on his tongue. A man, she knew, could get from his daughter a\r\npeculiar kind of hurt--one of the cruellest that flesh is heir to. Her\r\nheart ached for Godfrey.\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor had been warmed and comforted by a good dinner, he\r\nlit a cigar and sat down before the hearth to read. After a while his\r\nwife saw that the book had slid to his knee, and he was looking into the\r\nfire. Studying his dark profile, she noticed that the corners of his\r\nfunny eyebrows rose, as if he were amused by something.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking about, Godfrey?" she said presently. "Just then\r\nyou were smiling--quite agreeably!"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," he answered absently, "about Euripides; how, when he\r\nwas an old man, he went and lived in a cave by the sea, and it was\r\nthought queer, at the time. It seems that houses had become\r\ninsupportable to him. I wonder whether it was because he had observed\r\nwomen so closely all his life."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of March was the dreariest and bleakest of the year in\r\nHamilton, and Louie strove to brighten it by opening a discussion of\r\nplans for the summer. He had been hinting for some time that he had a\r\nvery attractive project up his sleeve, and though he had not succeeded\r\nin keeping it from Mrs. St. Peter, he said nothing to the Professor\r\nuntil one night when they were dining at the Marselluses\'. All through\r\ndinner Louie kept reminding them of the specialties of this and that\r\nParis restaurant, so that St. Peter was not altogether unprepared.\r\n\r\nAs they left the dining-room, Louie burst out with it. He and Rosamond\r\nwere to take Doctor and Mrs. St. Peter to France for the summer. Louie\r\nhad decided upon the dates, the boat, the itinerary; he was intoxicated\r\nwith the pleasure of planning.\r\n\r\n"Understand," he said, "it is to be our excursion, from Hamilton back to\r\nHamilton. We\'ll travel in the most ample comfort, but not in\r\nmagnificence. We\'ll go down to Biarritz for a little fashionable life,\r\nand stop at Marseilles to see your foster-brother, Charles Thierault.\r\nThe rest of the summer we\'ll lead a scholarly life in Paris. I have my\r\nown reasons for wishing you to go along, Professor. The pleasure of your\r\ncompany would be quite enough, but I have also other reasons. I want to\r\nsee the intellectual side of Paris, and to meet some of the savants and\r\nmen of letters whom you know. What a shame Gaston Paris is not living!\r\nWe could very nicely make up a little party at Lap\xc3\xa9rouse for him. But\r\nthere are others."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter developed the argument. "Yes, Louie, you and Godfrey can\r\nlunch with the scholars while Rosamond and I are shopping."\r\n\r\nMarsellus looked alarmed. "Not at all, Dearest! It\'s to be understood\r\nthat I always shop with you. I adore the shops in Paris. Besides, we\r\nshall want you with us when we lunch with celebrities. When was a\r\nsavant, and a Frenchman, not eager for the company of two charming\r\nladies at _d\xc3\xa9jeuner?_ And you may have too much of the society of your\r\n_sposi_; very nice for you to have variety. You must keep a little\r\nengagement book: _Lundi, d\xc3\xa9jeuner, M. Emile Faguet. Mercredi, diner, M.\r\nAnatole France_; and so on."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter chuckled. "I\'m afraid you exaggerate the circumference of my\r\nsocial circle, Louie. I haven\'t the pleasure of knowing Anatole France."\r\n\r\n"No matter; we can have M. Paul Bourget for Wednesday."\r\n\r\n"You can help us, too, about finding things for the house, Papa," said\r\nRosamond. "We expect to pick up a good many things. The Thieraults ought\r\nto know good shops down in the South, where prices have not gone up."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the antiquaries are centralized in Paris. I never saw\r\nanything very interesting in Lyons or the Midi. However, they may\r\nexist."\r\n\r\n"Charles Thierault is still interested in a shipping-line that runs to\r\nthe City of Mexico, isn\'t he? He could perfectly well send our purchases\r\nfrom Marseilles to the City of Mexico for us. They would go in without\r\nduty, and Louie thinks he can get them across the border as household\r\ngoods."\r\n\r\n"That sounds practicable, Rosie. It might be managed."\r\n\r\nMarsellus laughed and patted his wife\'s hand. "Oh-ho, _cher Papa_, you\r\nhaven\'t begun to find how practical we can be!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Louie, it\'s a tempting idea, and I\'ll think it over. I\'ll see\r\nwhether I can arrange my work." St. Peter knew at that moment that he\r\nwould never be one of this light-hearted expedition, and he hated\r\nhimself for the ungracious drawing-back that he felt in the region of\r\nhis diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe family discussed their summer plans all evening. Louie wanted to\r\nwrite at once for rooms at the Meurice, but Mrs. St. Peter ruled it out\r\nas too expensive.\r\n\r\nThat night, after he was in bed, St. Peter tried in vain to justify\r\nhimself in his inevitable refusal. He liked Paris, and he liked Louie.\r\nBut one couldn\'t do one\'s own things in another person\'s way; selfish or\r\nnot, that was the truth. Besides, he would not be needed. He could trust\r\nLouie to take every care of Lillian, and nobody could please her more\r\nthan her son-in-law. _Beaux-fils_, apparently, were meant by Providence\r\nto take the husband\'s place when husbands had ceased to be lovers.\r\nMarsellus never forgot one of the hundred foolish little attentions that\r\nLillian loved. Best of all, he admired her extravagantly, her\r\ndistinction was priceless to him. Many people admired her, but Louie\r\nmore than most. That worldliness, that willingness to get the most out\r\nof occasions and people, which had developed so strongly in Lillian in\r\nthe last few years, seemed to Louie as natural and proper as it seemed\r\nunnatural to Godfrey. It was an element that had always been in Lillian,\r\nand as long as it resulted in mere fastidiousness, was not a means to an\r\nend, St. Peter had liked it, too. He knew it was due to this worldliness,\r\neven more than to the fact that his wife had a little money of her own,\r\nthat she and his daughters had never been drab and a little pathetic,\r\nlike some of the faculty women. They hadn\'t much, but they were never\r\nabsurd. They never made shabby compromises. If they couldn\'t get the\r\nright thing, they went without. Usually they had the right thing, and it\r\ngot paid for, somehow. He couldn\'t say they were extravagant; the old\r\nhouse had been funny and bare enough, but there were no ugly things in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSince Rosamond\'s marriage to Marsellus, both she and her mother had\r\nchanged bewilderingly in some respects--changed and hardened. But Louie,\r\nwho had done the damage, had not damaged himself. It was to him that one\r\nappealed,--for Augusta, for Professor Crane, for the bruised feelings of\r\npeople less fortunate. It was less because of Louie than for any other\r\nreason that he would refuse this princely invitation.\r\n\r\nHe could get out of it without hurting anybody--though he knew Louie\r\nwould be sorry. He could simply insist that he must work, and that he\r\ncouldn\'t work away from his old study. There were some advantages about\r\nbeing a writer of histories. The desk was a shelter one could hide\r\nbehind, it was a hole one could creep into.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen St. Peter told his family of his decision, Louie was disappointed;\r\nbut he was respectful, and readily conceded that the Professor\'s first\r\nduty was to his work. Rosamond was incredulous and piqued; she didn\'t\r\nsee how he could be so ungenerous as to spoil an arrangement which would\r\ngive pleasure to everyone concerned. His wife looked at him with\r\nthoughtful disbelief.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone together, she approached the matter more directly\r\nthan was her wont nowadays.\r\n\r\n"Godfrey," she said slowly and sadly, "I wonder what it is that makes\r\nyou draw away from your family. Or who it is."\r\n\r\n"My dear, are you going to be jealous?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I were going to be. I\'d much rather see you foolish about some\r\nwoman than becoming lonely and inhuman."\r\n\r\n"Well, the habit of living with ideas grows on one, I suppose, just as\r\ninevitably as the more cheerful habit of living with various ladies.\r\nThere\'s something to be said for both."\r\n\r\n"I think your ideas were best when you were your most human self."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter sighed. "I can\'t contradict you there. But I must go on as I\r\ncan. It is not always May."\r\n\r\n"You are not old enough for the pose you take. That\'s what puzzles me.\r\nFor so many years you never seemed to grow at all older, though I did.\r\nTwo years ago you were an impetuous young man. Now you save yourself in\r\neverything. You\'re naturally warm and affectionate; all at once you\r\nbegin shutting yourself away from everybody. I don\'t think you\'ll be\r\nhappier for it." Up to this point she had been lecturing him. Now she\r\nsuddenly crossed the room and sat down on the arm of his chair, looking\r\ninto his face and twisting up the ends of his military eyebrows with her\r\nthumb and middle finger. "Why is it, Godfrey? I can\'t see any change in\r\nyour face, though I watch you so closely. It\'s in your mind, in your\r\nmood. Something has come over you. Is it merely that you know too much,\r\nI wonder? Too much to be happy? You were always the wisest person in the\r\nworld. What is it, can\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t altogether tell myself, Lillian. It\'s not wholly a matter of\r\nthe calendar. It\'s the feeling that I\'ve put a great deal behind me,\r\nwhere I can\'t go back to it again--and I don\'t really wish to go back.\r\nThe way would be too long and too fatiguing. Perhaps, for a home-staying\r\nman, I\'ve lived pretty hard. I wasn\'t willing to slight anything--you,\r\nor my desk, or my students. And now I seem to be tremendously tired. One\r\npays, coming or going. A man has got only just so much in him; when it\'s\r\ngone he slumps. Even the first Napoleon did." They both laughed. That\r\nwas an old joke--the Professor\'s darkest secret. At the font he had been\r\nchristened Napoleon Godfrey St. Peter. There had always been a Napoleon\r\nin the family, since a remote grandfather got his discharge from the\r\nGrande Arm\xc3\xa9e. Godfrey had abbreviated his name in Kansas, and even his\r\ndaughters didn\'t know what it had been originally.\r\n\r\n"I think, you know," he told his wife as he rose to go to bed, "that\r\nI\'ll get my second wind. But for the present I don\'t want anything very\r\nstimulating. Paris is too beautiful, and too full of memories."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Saturday morning in the spring, when the Professor was at work in\r\nthe old house, he heard energetic footsteps running up the uncarpeted\r\nstairway. Louie\'s voice called:\r\n\r\n"_Cher Papa_, shall I disturb you too much?"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter rose and opened to him. Louie was wearing his golf stockings,\r\nand a purple jacket with a fur collar.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not going golfing. I changed my mind, but didn\'t have time to\r\nchange my clothes. I want you to take a run out along the lake-shore\r\nwith us. Rosie is going to lunch with some friends at the Country Club.\r\nWe\'ll have a drive with her, and then drop her there. It\'s a glorious\r\nday." Louie\'s keen, interested eye ran about the shabby little room. He\r\nchuckled. "The old bear, he just likes his old den, doesn\'t he? I can\r\nreadily understand. Your children were born here. Not your\r\ndaughters--your sons, your splendid Spanish-adventurer sons! I\'m proud\r\nto be related to them, even by marriage. And your blanket, surely that\'s\r\na Spanish touch!" Louie pounced upon the purple blanket, threw it across\r\nhis chest, and, moving aside the wire lady, studied himself in Augusta\'s\r\nglass. "And a very proper dressing-gown it would make for Louie,\r\nwouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"It was Outland\'s--a precious possession. His lost chum brought it up\r\nfrom Mexico."\r\n\r\n"Was it Outland\'s, indeed?" Louie stroked it and regarded it in the\r\nglass with increased admiration. "I can never forgive destiny that I\r\nhadn\'t the chance to know that splendid fellow."\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s eyebrows rose in puzzled interrogation. "It might have\r\nbeen awkward--about Rosie, you know."\r\n\r\n"I never think of him as a rival," said Louie, throwing back the blanket\r\nwith a wide gesture. "I think of him as a brother, an adored and gifted\r\nbrother."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they were spinning along through the country, just\r\ncoming green, Rosamond and her father on the back seat, Louie facing\r\nthem. It struck the Professor that Louie had something on his mind; his\r\nrestless bright eyes watched his wife narrowly, as if to seize an\r\nopportune moment.\r\n\r\n"You know, Doctor," he said presently, "we\'ve decided to give up our\r\nhouse before we go abroad, and cut off the rent. We\'ll move the books\r\nand pictures up to Outland (and our wedding presents, of course), and\r\nthe silver we\'ll put in the bank. There won\'t be much of our present\r\nfurniture that we\'ll need. I wonder if you could use any of it? And it\r\nhas just occurred to me, Rosie," here he leaned forward and tapped her\r\nknee, "that we might ask Scott and Kathleen to come round and select\r\nanything they like. No use bothering to sell it, we\'d get so little."\r\n\r\nRosamond looked at him in astonishment. It was very evident they had not\r\ndiscussed anything of this sort before. "Don\'t be foolish, Louie," she\r\nsaid quietly. "They wouldn\'t want your things."\r\n\r\n"But why not?" he persisted playfully. "They are very nice things. Not\r\nright for Outland, but perfectly right for a little house. We chose them\r\nwith care, and we don\'t want them going into some dirty second-hand\r\nshop."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t have to. We can store them in the attic at Outland, Heaven\r\nknows it\'s big enough! You don\'t have to do anything with them just\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"It seems a pity, when somebody might be getting the good of them. I\r\nknow Scott could do very well with that chiffonier of mine. He admired\r\nit greatly, I remember, and said he\'d never had one with proper drawers\r\nfor his shirts."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s lip curled.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look like that, Rosie! It\'s naughty. Stop it!" Louie reached\r\nforward and shook her gently by the elbows. "And how can you be sure the\r\nMcGregors wouldn\'t like our things, when you\'ve never asked them? What\r\npositive ideas she does get into her head!"\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t want them because they are ours, yours and mine, if you\r\nwill have it," she said coldly, drawing away from him.\r\n\r\nLouie sank back into his seat and gave it up. "Why do you think such\r\nnaughty things? I don\'t believe it, you know! You are so touchy. Scott\r\nand Kitty may be a little stand-offish, but it might very possibly make\r\nthem feel better if you went at them nicely about this." He rallied and\r\nbegan to coax again. "She\'s got it into her head that the McGregors have\r\na grudge, Doctor. There\'s nothing to it."\r\n\r\nRosamond had grown quite pale. Her upper lip, that was so like her\r\nmother\'s when she was affable, so much harder when she was not, came\r\ndown like a steel curtain. "I happen to know, Louie, that Scott\r\nblackballed you for the Arts and Letters. You can call that a grudge or\r\nnot, as you please."\r\n\r\nMarsellus was visibly shaken. He looked sad. "Well, if he did, it wasn\'t\r\nvery nice of him, certainly. But are you sure, Rosie? Rumours do go\r\nabout, and people like to stir up family differences."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t people, and it\'s not rumour. I know it positively. Kathleen\'s\r\nbest friend told me."\r\n\r\nLouie lay back and shook with laughter. "Oh, the ladies, the ladies!\r\nWhat they do to each other, Professor!"\r\n\r\nSt. Peter was very uncomfortable. "I don\'t think I\'d accept such\r\nevidence, Rosamond. I don\'t believe it of Scott, and I think Louie has\r\nthe right idea. People are like children, and Scott\'s poor and proud. I\r\nthink Louie\'s chiffonier would go to his heart, if Louie offered it to\r\nhim. I\'m afraid you wouldn\'t do it very graciously."\r\n\r\n"Professor, I\'ll go to McGregor\'s office and put it up to him. If he\r\nscorns it, so much the worse for him. He\'ll lose a very handy piece of\r\nfurniture."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s paleness changed to red. Fortunately they were spinning over\r\nthe gravel loops that led through shaven turf to the Country Club. "You\r\ncan do as you like with your own things, Louie. But I don\'t want any of\r\nmine in the McGregors\' bungalow. I know Scott\'s brand of humour too\r\nwell, and the kind of jokes that would be made about them."\r\n\r\nThe car stopped. Louie sprang out and gave his arm to his wife. He\r\nwalked up the steps to the door with her, and his back expressed such\r\npatient, protecting kindness that the Professor bit his lower lip with\r\nindignation. Louie came back looking quite grey and tired, and sank into\r\nthe seat beside the Professor with a sadder-and-wiser smile.\r\n\r\n"Louie," St. Peter spoke with deep feeling, "do you happen to have read\r\na novel of Henry James, _The American?_ There\'s a rather nice scene in\r\nit, in which a young Frenchman, hurt in a duel, apologizes for the\r\nbehaviour of his family. I\'d like to do something of the sort. I\r\napologize to you for Rosamond, and for Scott, if he has done such a mean\r\nthing."\r\n\r\nLouie\'s downcast face brightened at once. He squeezed the Professor\'s\r\narm warmly. "Oh, _that\'s_ all right, sir! As for Scott, I can\r\nunderstand. He was the first son of the family, and he was the whole\r\nthing. Then I came along, a stranger, and carried off Rosie, and this\r\npatent began to pay so well--it\'s enough to make any man jealous, and he\r\na Scotchman! But I think Scott will come around in the end; people\r\nusually do, if you treat them well, and I mean to. I like the fellow. As\r\nfor Rosamond, you mustn\'t give that a thought. I love her when she\'s\r\nnaughty. She\'s a bit unreasonable sometimes, but I\'m always hoping for a\r\nperiod of utter, of fantastic unreasonableness, which will be the\r\nbeginning of a great happiness for us all."\r\n\r\n"Louie, you are magnanimous and magnificent!" murmured his vanquished\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nLillian and the Marselluses sailed for France early in May. The\r\nProfessor, left alone, had plenty of time to spray his rose-vines, and\r\nhis garden had never been so beautiful as it was that June. After his\r\nuniversity duties were over, he smuggled his bed and clothing back to\r\nthe old house and settled down to a leisurely bachelor life. He realized\r\nthat he ought to be getting to work. The garden, in which he sat all\r\nday, was no longer a valid excuse to keep him from his study. But the\r\ntask that awaited him up there was difficult. It was a little thing, but\r\none of those little things at which the hand becomes self-conscious,\r\nfeels itself stiff and clumsy.\r\n\r\nIt was his plan to give part of this summer to Tom Outland\'s diary--to\r\nedit and annotate it for publication. The bother was that he must write\r\nan introduction. The diary covered only about six months of the boy\'s\r\nlife, a summer he spent on the Blue Mesa, and in it there was almost\r\nnothing about Tom himself. To mean anything, it must be prefaced by a\r\nsketch of Outland, and some account of his later life and achievements.\r\nTo write of his scientific work would be comparatively easy. But that\r\nwas not all the story; his was a many-sided mind, though a simple and\r\nstraightforward personality.\r\n\r\nOf course Mrs. St. Peter had insisted that he was not altogether\r\nstraightforward; but that was merely because he was not altogether\r\nconsistent. As an investigator he was clear-sighted and hard-headed; but\r\nin personal relations he was apt to be exaggerated and quixotic. He\r\nidealized the people he loved and paid his devoir to the ideal rather\r\nthan to the individual, so that his behaviour was sometimes a little too\r\nexalted for the circumstances--"chivalry of the cinema," Lillian used to\r\nsay. One of his sentimental superstitions was that he must never on any\r\naccount owe any material advantage to his friends, that he must keep\r\naffection and advancement far apart, as if they were chemicals that\r\nwould disintegrate each other. St. Peter thought this the logical result\r\nof Tom\'s strange bringing-up and his early associations. There is, he\r\nknew, this dream of self-sacrificing friendship and disinterested love\r\ndown among the day-labourers, the men who run the railroad trains and\r\nboats and reapers and thrashers and mine-drills of the world. And Tom\r\nhad brought it along to the university, where advancement through\r\npersonal influence was considered honourable.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Outland was a senior that Lillian began to be jealous\r\nof him. He had been almost a member of the family for two years, and she\r\nhad never found fault with the boy. But after the Professor began to\r\ntake Tom up to the study and talk over his work with him, began to make\r\na companion of him, then Mrs. St. Peter withdrew her favour. She could\r\nchange like that; friendship was not a matter of habit with her. And\r\nwhen she was through with anyone, she of course found reasons for her\r\nfickleness. Tom, she reminded her husband, Was far from frank, though he\r\nhad such an open manner. He had been consistently reserved about his own\r\naffairs, and she could not believe the facts he withheld were altogether\r\ncreditable. They had always known he had a secret, something to do with\r\nthe mysterious Rodney Blake and the bank account in New Mexico upon\r\nwhich he was not at liberty to draw. The young man must have felt the\r\nchange in her, for he began that winter to make his work a pretext for\r\ncoming to the house less often. He and St. Peter now met in the alcove\r\nbehind the Professor\'s lecture room at the university.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, shortly before Tom\'s Commencement, he came to the house to\r\nask Rosamond to go to the senior dance with him. The family were having\r\ntea in the garden; a few days of intensely warm weather had come on and\r\nhurried the roses into bloom. Rosamond happened to ask Tom, who sat in\r\nhis white flannels, fanning himself with his straw hat, if spring in the\r\nSouth-west was as warm as this.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," he replied. "May is usually chilly down there--bright sun, but\r\na kind of edge in the wind, and cool nights. Last night reminded me of\r\nsmothery May nights in Washington."\r\n\r\nMrs. St. Peter glanced up. "You mean Washington City? I didn\'t know you\r\nhad ever been so far east."\r\n\r\nThere was no denying that the young man looked uncomfortable. He frowned\r\nand said in a low voice: "Yes, I\'ve been there. I suppose I don\'t speak\r\nof it because I haven\'t very pleasant recollections of it."\r\n\r\n"How long were you there?" his hostess asked.\r\n\r\n"A winter and spring, more than six months. Long enough to get very\r\nhome-sick." He went away almost at once, as if he were afraid of being\r\nquestioned further.\r\n\r\nThe subject came up again a few weeks later, however. After Tom\'s\r\ngraduation, two courses were open to him. He was offered an\r\ninstructorship, with a small salary, in the Physics department under Dr.\r\nCrane, and a graduate scholarship at Johns Hopkins University. St. Peter\r\nstrongly urged him to accept the latter. One evening when the family\r\nwere discussing Tom\'s prospects, the Professor summed up all the reasons\r\nwhy he ought to go to Baltimore and work in the laboratory made famous\r\nby Dr. Rowland. He assured him, moreover, that he would find the\r\natmosphere of an old Southern city delightful.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know something about the atmosphere," Tom broke out at last. "It\r\nis delightful, but it\'s all wrong for me. It discourages me dreadfully.\r\nI used to go over there when I was in Washington, and it always made me\r\nblue. I don\'t believe I could ever work there."\r\n\r\n"But can you trust a child\'s impressions to guide you now, in such an\r\nimportant decision?" asked Mrs. St. Peter gravely.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t a child, Mrs. St. Peter. I was as much grown up as I am\r\nnow--older, in some ways. It was only about a year before I came here."\r\n\r\n"But, Tom, you were on the section gang that year! Why do you mix us all\r\nup?" Kathleen caught his hand and squeezed the knuckles together, as she\r\ndid when she wanted to punish him.\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe it was two years before. It doesn\'t matter. It was long\r\nenough to count for two ordinary years," he muttered abstractedly.\r\n\r\nAgain he went away abruptly, and a few days later he told St. Peter that\r\nhe had definitely accepted the instructorship under Crane, and would\r\nstay on in Hamilton.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer after Outland\'s graduation, St. Peter got to know all\r\nthere was behind his reserve. Mrs. St. Peter and the two girls were in\r\nColorado, and the Professor was alone in the house, writing on volumes\r\nthree and four of his history. Tom was carrying on some experiments of\r\nhis own, over in the Physics laboratory. He and St. Peter were often\r\ntogether in the evening, and on fine afternoons they went swimming.\r\nEvery Saturday the Professor turned his house over to the\r\ncleaning-woman, and he and Tom went to the lake and spent the day in his\r\nsail-boat.\r\n\r\nIt was just the sort of summer St. Peter liked, if he had to be in\r\nHamilton at all. He was his own cook, and had laid in a choice\r\nassortment of cheeses and light Italian wines from a discriminating\r\nimporter in Chicago. Every morning before he sat down at his desk he\r\ntook a walk to the market and had his pick of the fruits and salads. He\r\ndined at eight o\'clock. When he cooked a fine leg of lamb, saignant,\r\nwell rubbed with garlic before it went into the pan, then he asked\r\nOutland to dinner. Over a dish of steaming asparagus, swathed in a\r\nnapkin to keep it hot, and a bottle of sparkling Asti, they talked and\r\nwatched night fall in the garden. If the evening happened to be rainy or\r\nchilly, they sat inside and read Lucretius.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of those rainy nights, before the fire in the dining-room,\r\nthat Tom at last told the story he had always kept back. It was nothing\r\nvery incriminating, nothing very remarkable; a story of youthful defeat,\r\nthe sort of thing a boy is sensitive about--until he grows older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TWO\r\n\r\nTOM OUTLAND\'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing that side-tracked me and made me so late coming to college was\r\na somewhat unusual accident, or string of accidents. It began with a\r\npoker game, when I was a call boy in Pardee, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nOne cold, clear night in the fall I started out to hunt up a freight\r\ncrew that was to go out soon after midnight. It was just after pay day,\r\nand one of the fellows had tipped me off that there would be a poker\r\ngame going on in the card-room behind the Ruby Light saloon. I knew most\r\nof my crew would be there, except Conductor Willis, who had a sick baby\r\nat home. The front windows were dark, of course. I went up the back\r\nalley, through a tumble-down ice house and a court, into a \'dobe room\r\nthat didn\'t open into the saloon proper at all. It was crowded, and hot\r\nand stuffy enough. There were six or seven in the game, and a crowd of\r\nfellows were standing about the walls, rubbing the whitewash off on to\r\ntheir coat shoulders. There was a bird-cage hanging in one window,\r\ncovered with an old flannel shirt, but the canary had wakened up and was\r\nsinging away for dear life. He was a beautiful singer--an old Mexican\r\nhad trained him--and he was one of the attractions of the place.\r\n\r\nI happened along when a jack-pot was running. Two of the fellows I\'d\r\ncome for were in it, and they naturally wanted to finish the hand. I\r\nstood by the door with my watch, keeping time for them. Among the\r\nplayers I saw two sheep men who always liked a lively game, and one of\r\nthe bystanders told me you had to buy a hundred dollars\' worth of chips\r\nto get in that night. The crowd was fussing about one fellow, Rodney\r\nBlake, who had come in from his engine without cleaning up. That wasn\'t\r\ncustomary; the minute a man got in from his run, he took a bath, put on\r\ncitizen\'s clothes, and went to a barber. This Blake was a new fireman on\r\nour division. He\'d come up town in his greasy overalls and sweaty blue\r\nshirt, with his face streaked up with smoke. He\'d been drinking; he\r\nsmelled of it, and his eyes were out of focus. All the other men were\r\nclean and freshly shaved, and they were sore at Blake--said his hands\r\nwere so greasy they marked the cards. Some of them wanted to put him out\r\nof the game, but he was a big, heavy-built fellow, and nobody wanted to\r\nbe the man to do it. It didn\'t please them any better when he took the\r\njack-pot.\r\n\r\nI got my two men and hurried them out, and two others from the row along\r\nthe wall took their places. One of the chaps who left with me asked me\r\nto go up to his house and get his grip with his work clothes. He\'d lost\r\nevery cent of his pay cheque and didn\'t want to face his wife. I asked\r\nhim who was winning.\r\n\r\n"Blake. The dirty boomer\'s been taking everything. But the fellows will\r\nclean him out before morning."\r\n\r\nAbout two o\'clock, when my work for that night was over and I was going\r\nhome to sleep, I just dropped in at the card-room to see how things had\r\ncome out. The game was breaking up. Since I left them at midnight, they\r\nhad changed to stud poker, and Blake, the fireman, had cleaned everybody\r\nout. He was cashing in his chips when I came in. The bank was a little\r\nshort, but Blake made no fuss about it. He had something over sixteen\r\nhundred dollars lying on the table before him in banknotes and gold.\r\nSome of the crowd were insulting him, trying to get him into a fight and\r\nloot him. He paid no attention and began to put the money away, not\r\nlooking at anybody. The bills he folded and put inside the band of his\r\nhat. He filled his overalls pockets with the gold, and swept the rest of\r\nit into his big red neckerchief.\r\n\r\nI\'d been interested in this fellow ever since he came on our division;\r\nhe was close-mouthed and unfriendly. He was one of those fellows with a\r\nsettled, mature body and a young face, such as you often see among\r\nworking-men. There was something calm, and sarcastic, and mocking about\r\nhis expression--that, too, you often see among working-men. When he had\r\nput all his money away, he got up and walked toward the door without a\r\nword, without saying good-night to anybody.\r\n\r\n"Manners of a hog, and a dirty hog!" little Barney Shea yelled after\r\nhim. Blake\'s back was just in the doorway; he hitched up one shoulder,\r\nbut didn\'t turn or make a sound.\r\n\r\nI slipped out after him and followed him down the street. His walk was\r\nunsteady, and the gold in his baggy overalls pockets clinked with every\r\nstep he took. I ran a little way and caught up with him. "What are you\r\ngoing to do with all that money, Blake?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Lose it, to-morrow night. I\'m no hog for money. Damned barber-pole\r\ndudes!"\r\n\r\nI thought I\'d better follow him home. I knew he lodged with an old\r\nMexican woman, in the yellow quarter, behind the round-house. His room\r\nopened on to the street, by a sky-blue door. He went in, didn\'t strike a\r\nlight or make a stab at undressing, but threw himself just as he was on\r\nthe bed and went to sleep. His hat stuck between the iron rods of the\r\nbed-head, the gold ran out of his pockets and rolled over the bare floor\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\nI struck a match and lit a candle. The bed took up half the room; on the\r\ndresser was a grip with his clean clothes in it, just as he\'d brought it\r\nin from his run. I took out the clothes and began picking up the money;\r\ngot the bills out of his hat, emptied his pockets, and collected the\r\ncoins that lay in the hollow of the bed about his hips, and put it all\r\ninto the grip. Then I blew out the light and sat down to listen. I\r\ntrusted all the boys who were at the Ruby Light that night, except\r\nBarney Shea. He might try to pull something off on a stranger, down in\r\nMexican town. We had a quiet night, however, and a cold one. I found\r\nBlake\'s winter overcoat hanging on the wall and wrapped up in it. I\r\nwasn\'t a bit sorry when the roosters began to crow and the dogs began\r\nbarking all over Mexican town. At last the sun came up and turned the\r\ndesert and the \'dobe town red in a minute. I began to shake the man on\r\nthe bed. Waking men who didn\'t want to get up was part of my job, and I\r\ndidn\'t let up on him until I had him on his feet.\r\n\r\n"Hello, kid, come to call me?"\r\n\r\nI told him I\'d come to call him to a Harvey House breakfast. "You owe me\r\na good one. I brought you home last night."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'m glad to have company. Wait till I wash up a bit." He took his\r\nsoap and towel and comb and went out into the patio, a neat little\r\nsanded square with flowers and vines all around, and washed at the\r\ntrough under the pump. Then he called me to come and pump water on his\r\nhead. After he\'d stood the gush of cold water for a few seconds, he\r\nstraightened up with his teeth chattering.\r\n\r\n"That ought to get the whisky out of a fellow\'s head, oughtn\'t it? Felt\r\ngood, Tom." Presently he began feeling his side pockets. "Was I dreaming\r\nsomething, or did I take a string of jack-pots last night?"\r\n\r\n"The money\'s in your grip," I told him. "You don\'t deserve it, for you\r\nwere too drunk to take care of it. I had to come after you and pick it\r\nup out of the mud."\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll go halvers. Easy come, easy go."\r\n\r\nI told him I didn\'t want anything off him but breakfast, and I wanted\r\nthat pretty soon.\r\n\r\n"Go easy, son. I\'ve got to change my shirt. This one\'s wet."\r\n\r\n"It\'s worse than wet. You oughtn\'t to go up town without changing.\r\nYou\'re a stranger here, and it makes a bad impression."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and looked superior. He had a square-built,\r\nhonest face and steady eyes that didn\'t carry a cynical expression very\r\nwell. I knew he was a decent chap, though he\'d been drinking and acting\r\nugly ever since he\'d been on our division.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we went out and sat in the sun at a place where the\r\nwooden sidewalk ran over a sand gully and made a sort of bridge. I had a\r\nlong talk with him. I was carrying the grip with his winnings in it, and\r\nI finally persuaded him to go with me to the bank. We put every cent of\r\nit into a savings account that he couldn\'t touch for a year.\r\n\r\nFrom that night Blake and I were fast friends. He was the sort of fellow\r\nwho can do anything for somebody else, and nothing for himself. There\r\nare lots like that among working-men. They aren\'t trained by success to\r\na sort of systematic selfishness. Rodney had been unlucky in personal\r\nrelations. He\'d run away from home when he was a kid because his mother\r\nmarried again--a man who had been paying attention to her while his\r\nfather was still alive. He got engaged to a girl down on the Southern\r\nPacific, and she double-crossed him, as he said. He went to Old Mexico\r\nand let his friends put all his savings into an oil well, and they\r\nskinned him. What he needed was a pal, a straight fellow to give an\r\naccount to. I was ten years younger, and that was an advantage. He liked\r\nto be an older brother. I suppose the fact that I was a kind of stray\r\nand had no family, made it easier for him to unbend to me. He surely got\r\nto think a lot of me, and I did of him. It was that winter I had\r\npneumonia. Mrs. O\'Brien couldn\'t do much for me; she was overworked,\r\npoor woman, with a houseful of children. Blake took me down to his room,\r\nand he and the old Mexican woman nursed me. He ought to have had boys of\r\nhis own to look after. Nature\'s full of such substitutions, but they\r\nalways seem to me sad, even in botany.\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t able to be about until spring, and then the doctor and Father\r\nDuchene said I must give up night work and live in the open all summer.\r\nBefore I knew anything about it, Blake had thrown up his job on the\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9, and got a berth for him and me with the Sitwell Cattle\r\nCompany. Jonas Sitwell was one of the biggest cattle men in our part of\r\nNew Mexico. Roddy and I were to ride the range with a bunch of grass\r\ncattle all summer, then take them down to a winter camp on the Cruzados\r\nriver and keep them on pasture until spring.\r\n\r\nWe went out about the first of May, and joined our cattle twenty miles\r\nsouth of Pardee, down toward the Blue Mesa. The Blue Mesa was one of the\r\nlandmarks we always saw from Pardee--landmarks mean so much in a flat\r\ncountry. To the northwest, over toward Utah, we had the Mormon Buttes,\r\nthree sharp blue peaks that always sat there. The Blue Mesa was south of\r\nus, and was much stronger in colour, almost purple. People said the rock\r\nitself had a deep purplish cast. It looked, from our town, like a naked\r\nblue rock set down alone in the plain, almost square, except that the\r\ntop was higher at one end. The old settlers said nobody had ever climbed\r\nit, because the sides were so steep and the Cruzados river wound round\r\nit at one end and under-cut it.\r\n\r\nBlake and I knew that the Sitwell winter camp was down on the Cruzados\r\nriver, directly under the mesa, and all summer long, while we drifted\r\nabout with our cattle from one water-hole to another, we planned how we\r\nwere going to climb the mesa and be the first men up there. After\r\nsupper, when we lit our pipes and watched the sunset, climbing the mesa\r\nwas our staple topic of conversation. Our job was a cinch; the actual\r\nwork wouldn\'t have kept one man busy. The Sitwell people were good to\r\ntheir hands. John Rapp, the foreman, came along once a month in his\r\nspring-wagon, to see how the cattle were doing and to bring us supplies\r\nand bundles of old newspapers.\r\n\r\nBlake was a conscientious reader of newspapers. He always wanted to know\r\nwhat was going on in the world, though most of it displeased him. He\r\nbrooded on the great injustices of his time; the hanging of the\r\nAnarchists in Chicago, which he could just remember, and the Dreyfus\r\ncase. We had long arguments about what we read in the papers, but we\r\nnever quarrelled. The only trouble I had with Blake was in getting to do\r\nmy share of the work. He made my health a pretext for taking all the\r\nheavy chores, long after I was as well as he was. I\'d brought my C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nalong, and had promised Father Duchene to read a hundred lines a day.\r\nBlake saw that I did it--made me translate the dull stuff aloud to him.\r\nHe said if I once knew Latin, I wouldn\'t have to work with my back all\r\nmy life like a burro. He had great respect for education, but he\r\nbelieved it was some kind of hocus-pocus that enabled a man to live\r\nwithout work. We had _Robinson Crusoe_ with us, and Roddy\'s favourite\r\nbook, _Gulliver\'s Travels_, which he never tired of.\r\n\r\nLate in October, Rapp, the foreman, came along to accompany us down to\r\nthe winter camp. Blake stayed with the cattle about fifteen miles to the\r\neast, where the grass was still good, and Rapp and I went down to air\r\nout the cabin and stow away our winter supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cabin stood in a little grove of pi\xc3\xb1ons, about thirty yards back\r\nfrom the Cruzados river, facing south and sheltered on the north by a\r\nlow hill. The grama grass grew right up to the door-step, and the\r\nrabbits were running about and the grasshoppers hitting the door when we\r\npulled up and looked at the place. There was no litter around, it was as\r\nclean as a prairie-dog\'s house. No outbuildings, except a shed for our\r\nhorses. The hill-side behind was sandy and covered with tall clumps of\r\ndeer-horn cactus, but there was nothing but grass to the south, with\r\nstreaks of bright yellow rabbit-brush. Along the river the cottonwoods\r\nand quaking asps had already turned gold. Just across from us,\r\noverhanging us, indeed, stood the mesa, a pile of purple rock, all\r\nbroken out with red sumach and yellow aspens up in the high crevices of\r\nthe cliffs. From the cabin, night and day, you could hear the river,\r\nwhere it made a bend round the foot of the mesa and churned over the\r\nrocks. It was the sort of place a man would like to stay in forever.\r\n\r\nI helped Rapp open the wooden shutters and sweep out the cabin. We put\r\nclean blankets on the bunks, and stowed away bacon and coffee and canned\r\nstuff on the shelves behind the cook-stove. I confess I looked forward\r\nto cooking on an iron stove with four holes. Rapp explained to me that\r\nBlake and I wouldn\'t be able to enjoy all this luxury together for a\r\ntime. He wanted the herd kept some distance to the north as long as the\r\ngrass held out up there, and Roddy and I could take turn about, one\r\ncamping near the cattle and one sleeping in a bed.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not pasture enough down here to take them through a long\r\nwinter," he said, "and it\'s safest to keep them grazing up north while\r\nyou can. Besides, if you bring them down here while the weather\'s so\r\nwarm, they get skittish, and that mesa over there makes trouble. They\r\nswim the river and bolt into the mesa, and that\'s the last you ever see\r\nof them. We\'ve lost a lot of critters that way. The mesa has been\r\npopulated by run-aways from our herd, till now there\'s a fine bunch of\r\nwild cattle up there. When the wind\'s right, our cows over here get the\r\nscent of them and make a break for the river. You\'ll have to watch \'em\r\nclose when you bring \'em down."\r\n\r\nI asked him whether nobody had ever gone over to get the lost cattle\r\nout.\r\n\r\nRapp glared at me. "Out of that mesa? Nobody has ever got into it yet.\r\nThe cliffs are like the base of a monument, all the way round. The only\r\nway into it is through that deep canyon that opens on the water level,\r\njust where the river makes the bend. You can\'t get in by that, because\r\nthe river\'s too deep to ford and too swift to swim. Oh, I suppose a\r\nhorse could swim it, if cattle can, but I don\'t want to be the man to\r\ntry."\r\n\r\nI remarked that I had had my eye on the mesa all summer and meant to\r\nclimb it.\r\n\r\n"Not while you\'re working for the Sitwell Company, you don\'t! If you\r\nboys try any nonsense of that sort, I\'ll fire you quick. You\'d break\r\nyour bones and lose the herd for us. You have to watch them close to\r\nkeep them from going over, I tell you. If it wasn\'t for that mesa, this\r\nwould be the best winter range in all New Mexico."\r\n\r\nAfter the foreman left us, we settled down to easy living and fine\r\nweather; blue and gold days, and clear, frosty nights. We kept the\r\ncattle off to the north and east and alternated in taking charge of\r\nthem. One man was with the herd while the other got his sleep and did\r\nthe cooking at the cabin. The mesa was our only neighbour, and the\r\ncloser we got to it, the more tantalizing it was. It was no longer a\r\nblue, featureless lump, as it had been from a distance. Its sky-line was\r\nlike the profile of a big beast lying down; the head to the north,\r\nhigher than the flanks around which the river curved. The north end we\r\ncould easily believe impassable--sheer cliffs that fell from the summit\r\nto the plain, more than a thousand feet. But the south flank, just\r\nacross the river from us, looked accessible by way of the deep canyon\r\nthat split the bulk in two, from the top rim to the river, then wound\r\nback into the solid cube so that it was invisible at a distance, like a\r\nmouse track winding into a big cheese. This canyon didn\'t break the\r\nsolid outline of the mesa, and you had to be close to see that it was\r\nthere at all. We faced the mesa on its shortest side; it was only about\r\nthree miles long from north to south, but east and west it measured\r\nnearly twice that distance. Whether the top was wooded we couldn\'t\r\nsee--it was too high above us; but the cliffs and canyon on the river\r\nside were fringed with beautiful growth, groves of quaking asps and\r\npi\xc3\xb1ons and a few dark cedars, perched up in the air like the hanging\r\ngardens of Babylon. At certain hours of the day, those cedars, growing\r\nso far up on the rocks, took on the bluish tint of the cliffs\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt was light up there long before it was with us. When I got up at\r\ndaybreak and went down to the river to get water, our camp would be cold\r\nand grey, but the mesa top would be red with sunrise, and all the slim\r\ncedars along the rocks would be gold--metallic, like tarnished\r\ngold-foil. Some mornings it would loom up above the dark river like a\r\nblazing volcanic mountain. It shortened our days, too, considerably. The\r\nsun got behind it early in the afternoon, and then our camp would lie in\r\nits shadow. After a while the sunset colour would begin to stream up\r\nfrom behind it. Then the mesa was like one great ink-black rock against\r\na sky on fire.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the thing bothered us and tempted us; it was always before us,\r\nand was always changing. Black thunder-storms used to roll up from\r\nbehind it and pounce on us like a panther without warning. The lightning\r\nwould play round it and jab into it so that we were always expecting it\r\nwould fire the brush. I\'ve never heard thunder so loud as it was there.\r\nThe cliffs threw it back at us, and we thought the mesa itself, though\r\nit seemed so solid, must be full of deep canyons and caverns, to account\r\nfor the prolonged growl and rumble that followed every crash of thunder.\r\nAfter the burst in the sky was over, the mesa went on sounding like a\r\ndrum, and seemed itself to be muttering and making noises.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I was out hunting turkeys. Just as the sun was getting\r\nlow, I came through a sea of rabbit-brush, still yellow, and the\r\nhorizontal rays of light, playing into it, brought out the contour of\r\nthe ground with great distinctness. I noticed a number of straight\r\nmounds, like plough furrows, running from the river inland. It was too\r\nlate to examine them. I cut a scrub willow and stuck a stake into one of\r\nthe ridges, to mark it. The next day I took a spade down to the\r\nplantation of rabbit-brush and dug around in the sandy soil. I came upon\r\nan old irrigation main, unmistakable, lined with hard smooth cobbles and\r\n\'dobe cement, with sluices where the water had been let out into\r\ntrenches. Along these ditches I turned up some pieces of pottery, all of\r\nit broken, and arrowheads, and a very neat, well-finished stone pick-ax.\r\n\r\nThat night I didn\'t go back to the cabin, but took my specimens out to\r\nBlake, who was still north with the cattle. Of course, we both knew\r\nthere had been Indians all over this country, but we felt sure that\r\nIndians hadn\'t used stone tools for a long while back. There must have\r\nbeen a colony of pueblo Indians here in ancient times: fixed residents,\r\nlike the Taos Indians and the Hopis, not wanderers like the Navajos.\r\n\r\nTo people off alone, as we were, there is something stirring about\r\nfinding evidences of human labour and care in the soil of an empty\r\ncountry. It comes to you as a sort of message, makes you feel\r\ndifferently about the ground you walk over every day. I liked the winter\r\nrange better than any place I\'d ever been in. I never came out of the\r\ncabin door in the morning to go after water that I didn\'t feel fresh\r\ndelight in our snug quarters and the river and the old mesa up there,\r\nwith its top burning like a bonfire. I wanted to see what it was like on\r\nthe other side, and very soon I took a day off and forded the river\r\nwhere it was wide and shallow, north of our camp. I rode clear around\r\nthe mesa, until I met the river again where it flowed under the south\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nOn that ride I got a better idea of its actual structure. All the way\r\nround were the same precipitous cliffs of hard blue rock, but in places\r\nit was mixed with a much softer stone. In these soft streaks there were\r\ndeep dry watercourses which could certainly be climbed as far as they\r\nwent, but nowhere did they reach to the top of the mesa. The top seemed\r\nto be one great slab of very hard rock, lying on the mixed mass of the\r\nbase like the top of an old-fashioned marble table. The channels worn\r\nout by water ran for hundreds of feet up the cliffs, but always stopped\r\nunder this great rimrock, which projected out over the erosions like a\r\ngranite shelf. Evidently, it was because of this unbroken top layer that\r\nthe butte was inaccessible. I rode back to camp that night, convinced\r\nthat if we ever climbed it, we must take the route the cattle took,\r\nthrough the river and up the one canyon that broke down to water-level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brought the bunch of cattle down to the winter range in the latter\r\npart of November. Early in December the foreman came along with generous\r\nprovisions for Christmas. This time he brought with him a supercargo, a\r\npitiful wreck of an old man he had picked up at Tarpin, the railroad\r\ntown thirty miles north-east of us, where the Sitwells bought their\r\nsupplies. This old man was a castaway Englishman, Henry Atkins by name.\r\nHe had been a valet, and a hospital orderly, and a cook, and for many\r\nyears was a table steward on the Anchor Line. Lately he had been cooking\r\nfor a sheep outfit that were grazing in the cattle country, where they\r\nweren\'t wanted. They had done something shady and had to get out in a\r\nhurry. They dropped old Henry at Tarpin, where he soon drank up all his\r\nwages. When Rapp picked him up there, he was living on hand-outs.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told him we can\'t pay him anything," Rapp explained. "But if he\r\nwants to stay here and cook for you boys till I make my next trip, he\'ll\r\nhave plenty to eat and a roof over him. He was sleeping in the livery\r\nstable in Tarpin. He says he\'s a good cook, and I thought he might liven\r\nthings up for you at Christmas time. He won\'t bother you, he\'s not got\r\nany of the mean ways of a bum--I know a bum when I see one. Next time I\r\ncome down I\'ll bring him some old clothes from the ranch, and you can\r\nlire him if you want to. All his baggage is that newspaper bundle, and\r\nthere\'s nothing in it but shoes--a pair of patent leathers and a pair of\r\nsneakers. The important thing is, never, on any account, go off\r\nskylarking, you two, and leave him with the cattle. Not for an hour,\r\nmind you. He ain\'t strong enough, and he\'s got no head."\r\n\r\nLife was a holiday for Blake and me after we got old Henry. He was a\r\nwonderful cook and a good housekeeper. He kept that cabin shining like\r\na playhouse; used to dress it all out with pi\xc3\xb1on boughs, and trimmed\r\nthe kitchen shelves with newspapers cut in fancy patterns. He had\r\nlearned to make up cots when he was a hospital orderly, and he made our\r\nbunks feel like a Harvey House bed. To this day that\'s the best I can\r\nsay for any bed. And he was such a polite, mannerly old boy; simple and\r\nkind as a child. I used to wonder how anybody so innocent and\r\ndefenceless had managed to get along at all, to keep alive for nearly\r\nseventy years in as hard a world as this. Anybody could take advantage\r\nof him. He held no grudge against any of the people who had misused him.\r\nHe loved to tell about the celebrated people he\'d been steward to, and\r\nthe liberal tips they had given him. There with us, where he couldn\'t\r\nget at whisky, he was a model of good behaviour. "Drink is me weakness,\r\nyou might say," he occasionally remarked apologetically. He shaved every\r\nmorning and was as clean as a pin. We got to be downright fond of him,\r\nand the three of us made a happy family.\r\n\r\nEver since we\'d brought our herd down to the winter camp, the wild\r\ncattle on the mesa were more in evidence. They came down to the river to\r\ndrink oftener, and loitered about, grazing in that low canyon so much\r\nthat we began to call it Cow Canyon. They were fine-looking beasts, too.\r\nOne could see they had good pasture up there. Henry had a theory that we\r\nought to be able to entice them over to our side with salt. He wanted to\r\nkill one for beefsteaks. Soon after he joined us we lost two cows.\r\nWithout warning they bolted into the mesa, as the foreman had said.\r\nAfter that we watched the herd closer; but a few days before Christmas,\r\nwhen Blake was off hunting and I was on duty, four fine young steers\r\nsneaked down to the water\'s edge through the brush, and before I knew it\r\nthey were swimming the river--seemed to do it with no trouble at all.\r\nThey frisked out on the other side, ambled up the canyon, and\r\ndisappeared. I was furious to have them steal a march on me, and I swore\r\nto myself I\'d follow them over and drive them back.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we took the herd a few miles east, to keep them out of\r\nmischief. I made some excuse to Blake, cut back to the cabin, and asked\r\nHenry to put me up a lunch. I told him my plan, but warned him not to\r\nbear tales. If I wasn\'t home when Blake came in at night, then he could\r\ntell him where I\'d gone.\r\n\r\nHenry went down to the river with me to watch me across. It had grown\r\ncolder since morning, and looked like snow. The old man was afraid of a\r\nstorm; said I might get snowed in. But I\'d got my nerve up, and I didn\'t\r\nwant to put off making a try at it. I strapped my blanket and my lunch\r\non my shoulders, hung my boots around my neck to keep them dry, stuffed\r\nmy socks inside my hat, and we waded in. My horse took the water without\r\nany fuss, though he shivered a good deal. He stepped out very carefully,\r\nand when it got too deep for him, he swam without panic. We were carried\r\ndown-stream a little by the current, but I didn\'t have to slide off his\r\nback. He found bottom after a while, and we easily made a landing. I\r\nwaved good-bye to Henry on the other side and started up the canyon,\r\nrunning beside my horse to get warm.\r\n\r\nThe canyon was wide at the water\'s edge, and though it corkscrewed back\r\ninto the mesa by abrupt turns, it preserved this open, roomy character.\r\nIt was, indeed, a very deep valley with gently sloping sides, rugged and\r\nrocky, but well grassed. There was a clear trail. Horses have no sense\r\nabout making a trail, but you can trust cattle to find the easiest\r\npossible path and to take the lowest grades. The bluish rock and the\r\nsun-tanned grass, under the unusual purple-grey of the sky, gave the\r\nwhole valley a very soft colour, lavender and pale gold, so that the\r\noccasional cedars growing beside the boulders looked black that morning.\r\nIt may have been the hint of snow in the air, but it seemed to me that I\r\nhad never breathed in anything that tasted so pure as the air in that\r\nvalley. It made my mouth and nostrils smart like charged water, seemed\r\nto go to my head a little and produce a kind of exaltation. I kept\r\ntelling myself that it was very different from the air on the other side\r\nof the river, though that was pure and uncontaminated enough.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone up this canyon for a mile or so, I came upon another,\r\nopening out to the north--a box canyon, very different in character. No\r\ngentle slope there. The walls were perpendicular, where they weren\'t\r\nactually overhanging, and they were anywhere from eight hundred to a\r\nthousand feet high, as we afterward found by measurement. The floor of\r\nit was a mass of huge boulders, great pieces of rock that had fallen\r\nfrom above ages back, and had been worn round and smooth as pebbles by\r\nthe long action of water. Many of them were as big as haystacks, yet\r\nthey lay piled on one another like a load of gravel. There was no\r\nfooting for my horse among those smooth stones, so I hobbled him and\r\nwent on alone a little way, just to see what it was like. My eyes were\r\nsteadily on the ground--a slip of the foot there might cripple one.\r\n\r\nIt was such rough scrambling that I was soon in a warm sweat under my\r\ndamp clothes. In stopping to take breath, I happened to glance up at the\r\ncanyon wall. I wish I could tell you what I saw there, just as I saw it,\r\non that first morning, through a veil of lightly falling snow. Far up\r\nabove me, a thousand feet or so, set in a great cavern in the face of\r\nthe cliff, I saw a little city of stone, asleep. It was as still as\r\nsculpture--and something like that. It all hung together, seemed to\r\nhave a kind of composition: pale little houses of stone nestling close\r\nto one another, perched on top of each other, with flat roofs, narrow\r\nwindows, straight walls, and in the middle of the group, a round tower.\r\n\r\nIt was beautifully proportioned, that tower, swelling out to a larger\r\ngirth a little above the base, then growing slender again. There was\r\nsomething symmetrical and powerful about the swell of the masonry. The\r\ntower was the fine thing that held all the jumble of houses together and\r\nmade them mean something. It was red in colour, even on that grey day.\r\nIn sunlight it was the colour of winter oak-leaves. A fringe of cedars\r\ngrew along the edge of the cavern, like a garden. They were the only\r\nliving things. Such silence and stillness and repose--immortal repose.\r\nThat village sat looking down into the canyon with the calmness of\r\neternity. The falling snow-flakes, sprinkling the pi\xc3\xb1ons, gave it a\r\nspecial kind of solemnity. I can\'t describe it. It was more like\r\nsculpture than anything else. I knew at once that I had come upon the\r\ncity of some extinct civilization, hidden away in this inaccessible mesa\r\nfor centuries, preserved in the dry air and almost perpetual sunlight\r\nlike a fly in amber, guarded by the cliffs and the river and the desert.\r\n\r\nAs I stood looking up at it, I wondered whether I ought to tell even\r\nBlake about it; whether I ought not to go back across the river and keep\r\nthat secret as the mesa had kept it. When I at last turned away, I saw\r\nstill another canyon branching out of this one, and in its wall still\r\nanother arch, with another group of buildings. The notion struck me like\r\na rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a bee-hive; it was full\r\nof little cliff-hung villages, it had been the home of a powerful tribe,\r\na particular civilization.\r\n\r\nThat night when I got home Blake was on the river-bank waiting for me. I\r\ntold him I\'d rather not talk about my trip until after supper,--that I\r\nwas beat out. I think he\'d meant to upbraid me for sneaking off, but he\r\ndidn\'t. He seemed to realize from the first that this was a serious\r\nmatter to me, and he accepted it in that way.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, when we had lit our pipes, I told Blake and Henry as\r\nclearly as I could what it was like over there, and we talked it over.\r\nThe town in the cliffs explained the irrigation ditches. Like all pueblo\r\nIndians, these people had had their farms away from their dwellings. For\r\na stronghold they needed rock, and for farming, soft earth and a water\r\nmain.\r\n\r\n"And this proves," said Roddy, "that there must have been a trail into\r\nthe mesa at the north end, and that they carried their harvest over by\r\nthe ford. If this Cow Canyon was the only entrance, they could never\r\nhave farmed down here." We agreed that he should go over on the first\r\nwarm day, and try to find a trail up to the Cliff City, as we already\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\nWe talked and speculated until after midnight. It was Christmas eve, and\r\nHenry said it was but right we should do something out of the ordinary.\r\nBut after we went to bed, tired as I was, I was unable to sleep. I got\r\nup and dressed and put on my overcoat and slipped outside to get sight\r\nof the mesa. The wind had come up and was blowing the squall clouds\r\nacross the sky. The moon was almost full, hanging directly over the\r\nmesa, which had never looked so solemn and silent to me before. I\r\nwondered how many Christmases had come and gone since that round tower\r\nwas built. I had been to Acoma and the Hopi villages, but I\'d never seen\r\na tower like that one. It seemed to me to mark a difference. I felt that\r\nonly a strong and aspiring people would have built it, and a people with\r\na feeling for design. That cluster of buildings, in its arch, with the\r\ndizzy drop into empty air from its doorways and the wall of cliff above,\r\nwas as clear in my mind as a picture. By closing my eyes I could see it\r\nagainst the dark, like a magic-lantern slide.\r\n\r\nBlake got over the river before New Year\'s day, but he didn\'t find any\r\nway of getting from the bottom of the box canyon up into the Cliff City.\r\nHe felt sure that the inhabitants of that sky village had reached it by\r\na trail from the top of the mesa down, not from the bottom of the canyon\r\nup. He explored the branch canyons a little, and found four other\r\nvillages, smaller than the first, placed in similar arches.\r\n\r\nThese arches we had often seen in other canyons. You can find them in\r\nthe Grand Canyon, and all along the Rio Grande. Whenever the surface\r\nrock is much harder than the rock beneath it, the softer stone begins to\r\ncrack and crumble with weather just at the line where it meets the hard\r\nrim rock. It goes on crumbling and falling away, and in time this\r\nwash-out grows to be a spacious cavern. The Cliff City sat in an\r\nunusually large cavern. We afterward found that it was three hundred and\r\nsixty feet long, and seventy feet high in the centre. The red tower was\r\nfifty feet in height.\r\n\r\nBlake and I began to make plans. Our engagement with the Sitwell Company\r\nterminated in May. When we turned our cattle over to the foreman, we\r\nwould go into the mesa with what food and tools we could carry, and try\r\nto find a trail down the north end, where we were sure there must once\r\nhave been one. If we could find an easier way to get in and out of the\r\nmesa, we would devote the summer, and our winter\'s wages, to exploring\r\nit. From Tarpin, the nearest railroad, we could get supplies and tools,\r\nand help if we needed it. We thought we could manage to do the work\r\nourselves if old Henry would stay with us. We didn\'t want to make our\r\ndiscovery any more public than necessary. We were reluctant to expose\r\nthose silent and beautiful places to vulgar curiosity. Finally we\r\noutlined our plan to Henry, telling him we couldn\'t promise him regular\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t mention it," he said, waving his hand. "I\'d ask nothing better\r\nthan to share your fortunes. In me youth it was me ambition to go to\r\nEgypt and see the tombs of the Pharaohs."\r\n\r\n"You may get a bad cold going over the river, Henry," Blake warned him.\r\n"It\'s bad crossing--makes you dizzy when you take to swimming. You have\r\nto keep your head."\r\n\r\n"I was never seasick in me life," he declared, "and at that, I\'ve helped\r\nin the cook\'s galley on the Anchor Line when she was fair standing on\r\nher head. You\'ll find me strong and active when I\'m once broke into the\r\nwork. I come of an enduring family, though, to be sure, I\'ve abused me\r\nconstitution somewhat."\r\n\r\nHenry liked to talk about his family, and the work they\'d done, and the\r\ngreat age to which they lived, and the brandy puddings his mother made.\r\n"Eighteen we was in all, when we sat down at table," he would often say\r\nwith his thin, apologetic smile. "Mother and father, and ten living, and\r\nfour dead, and two still-born." Roddy and I used to strain our\r\nimagination trying to visualize such a family dinner party.\r\n\r\nEverything worked out well for us. The foreman showed so much interest\r\nin our plans that we told him everything. He insisted that we should\r\nstay on at the winter camp as long as we needed a home base, and use up\r\nwhatever supplies were left. When he paid us off, he sold us our two\r\nhorses at a very reasonable figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBlake and I got over to the mesa together for the first time early in\r\nMay. We carried with us all the food we could, and an ax and spade. It\r\ntook us several days to find a trail leading from the bottom of the box\r\ncanyon up to the Cliff City. There were gaps in it; it was broken by\r\nledges too steep for a man to climb. Lying beside one of these, we found\r\nan old dried cedar trunk, with toe-notches cut in it. That was a plain\r\nsuggestion. We felled some trees and threw them up over the gaps in the\r\npath. Toward the end of the week, when our provisions were getting low,\r\nwe made the last lap in our climb, and stepped upon the ledge that was\r\nthe floor of the Cliff City.\r\n\r\nIn front of the cluster of buildings, there was an open space, like a\r\ncourt-yard. Along the outer edge of this yard ran a low stone wall. In\r\nsome places the wall had fallen away from the weather, but the buildings\r\nthemselves sat so far back under the rim rock that the rain had never\r\nbeat on them. In thunder-storms I\'ve seen the water come down in sheets\r\nover the face of that cavern without a drop touching the village.\r\n\r\nThe court-yard was not choked by vegetation, for there was no soil. It\r\nwas bare rock, with a few old, flat-topped cedars growing out of the\r\ncracks, and a little pale grass. But everything seemed open and clean,\r\nand the stones, I remember, were warm to the touch, smooth and pleasant\r\nto feel.\r\n\r\nThe outer walls of the houses were intact, except where sometimes an\r\noutjutting corner had crumbled. They were made of dressed stones,\r\nplastered inside and out with \'dobe, and were tinted in light colours,\r\npink and pale yellow and tan. Here and there a cedar log in the ceiling\r\nhad given way and let the second-story chamber down into the first;\r\nexcept for that, there was little rubbish or disorder. As Blake\r\nremarked, wind and sun are good housekeepers.\r\n\r\nThis village had never been sacked by an enemy, certainly. Inside the\r\nlittle rooms water jars and bowls stood about unbroken, and yucca-fibre\r\nmats were on the floors.\r\n\r\nWe could give only a hurried look over the place, as our food was\r\nexhausted, and we had to get back over the river before dark. We went\r\nabout softly, tried not to disturb anything--even the silence. Besides\r\nthe tower, there seemed to be about thirty little separate dwellings.\r\nBehind the cluster of houses was a kind of back court-yard, running from\r\nend to end of the cavern; a long, low, twilit space that got gradually\r\nlower toward the back until the rim rock met the floor of the cavern,\r\nexactly like the sloping roof of an attic. There was perpetual twilight\r\nback there, cool, shadowy, very grateful after the blazing sun in the\r\nfront court-yard. When we entered it we heard a soft trickling sound,\r\nand we came upon a spring that welled out of the rock into a stone basin\r\nand then ran off through a cobble-lined gutter and dripped down the\r\ncliffs. I\'ve never anywhere tasted water like it; as cold as ice, and so\r\npure. Long afterward Father Duchene came out to spend a week with us on\r\nthe mesa; he always carried a small drinking-glass with him, and he used\r\nto fill it at the spring and take it out into the sunlight. The water\r\nlooked like liquid crystal, absolutely colourless, without the slight\r\nbrownish or greenish tint that water nearly always has. It threw off the\r\nsunlight like a diamond.\r\n\r\nBeside this spring stood some of the most beautifully shaped water jars\r\nwe ever found--I gave Mrs. St. Peter one of them--standing there just as\r\nif they\'d been left yesterday. In the back court we found a great many\r\nthings besides jars and bowls: a row of grinding-stones, and several\r\nclay ovens, very much like those the Mexicans use to-day. There were\r\ncharred bones and charcoal, and the roof was thick with soot all the way\r\nalong. It was evidently a kind of common kitchen, where they roasted and\r\nbaked and probably gossiped. There were corncobs everywhere, and ears of\r\ncorn with the kernels still on them--little, like popcorn. We found\r\ndried beans, too, and strings of pumpkin seeds, and plum seeds, and a\r\ncupboard full of little implements made of turkey bones.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon Roddy and I crossed the river and got back to our\r\ncabin to rest for a few days.\r\n\r\nThe second time we went over, we found a long winding trail leading from\r\nthe Cliff City up to the top of the mesa--a narrow path worn deep into\r\nthe stone ledges that overhung the village, then running back into the\r\nwood of stunted pi\xc3\xb1ons on the summit. Following this to the north end\r\nof the mesa, we found what was left of an old road down to the plain.\r\nBut making this road passable was a matter of weeks, and we had to get\r\nworkmen and tools from Tarpin. It was a narrow foot-path, barely wide\r\nenough for a sure-footed mule, and it wound down through Black Canyon,\r\ndropping in loops along the face of terrifying cliffs. About a hundred\r\nfeet above the river, it ended--broke right off into the air. A wall of\r\nrock had fallen away there, probably from a landslide. That last piece\r\nof road cost us three weeks\' hard work, and most of our winter\'s wages.\r\nWe kept the workmen on long enough to build us a tight log cabin on the\r\nmesa top, a little way back from the ledge that hung over the Cliff\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nWhile we were engaged in road-building, we made a short cut from our\r\ncabin down to the Cliff City and Cow Canyon. Just over the Cliff City,\r\nthere was a crack in the ledge, a sort of manhole, and in this we hung a\r\nladder of pine-trunks spliced together with light chains, leaving the\r\nbranch forks for footholds. By climbing down this ladder we saved about\r\ntwo miles of winding trail, and dropped almost directly into Cow Canyon,\r\nwhere we meant always to leave one of the horses grazing. Taking this\r\nroute, we could at any time make a quick exit from the mesa--we were\r\nused to swimming the river now, and in summer our wet clothes dried very\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nBill Hook, the liveryman at Tarpin, who\'d sheltered old Henry when he\r\nwas down and out, proved a good friend to us. He got our workmen back\r\nand forth for us, brought our supplies up on to the mesa on his\r\npack-mules, and when one of us had to stay in town overnight he let us\r\nsleep in his hay barn to save a hotel bill. He knew our expenses were\r\nheavy, and did everything for us at a bottom price.\r\n\r\nBy the first of July our money was nearly gone, but we had our road\r\nmade, and our cabin built on top of the mesa. We brought old Henry up by\r\nthe new horse-trail and began housekeeping. We were now ready for what\r\nwe called excavating. We built wide shelves all around our\r\nsleeping-room, and there we put the smaller articles we found in the\r\nCliff City. We numbered each specimen, and in my day-book I wrote down\r\njust where and in what condition we had found it, and what we thought it\r\nhad been used for. I\'d got a merchant\'s ledger in Tarpin, and every\r\nnight after supper, while Roddy read the newspapers, I sat down at the\r\nkitchen table and wrote up an account of the day\'s work.\r\n\r\nHenry, besides doing the housekeeping, was very eager to help us in the\r\n"rew-ins," as he called them. He was more patient than we, and would dig\r\nwith his fingers half a day to get a pot out of a rubbish pile without\r\nbreaking it. After all, the old man had a wider knowledge of the world\r\nthan either of us, and it often came in handy. When we were working in a\r\npale pink house, with two stories, and a sort of balcony before the\r\nupper windows, we came on a closet in the wall of the upstairs room; in\r\nthis were a number of curious things, among them a deer-skin bag full of\r\nlittle tools. Henry said at once they were surgical instruments; a stone\r\nlancet, a bunch of fine bone needles, wooden forceps, and a catheter.\r\n\r\nOne thing we knew about these people; they hadn\'t built their town in a\r\nhurry. Everything proved their patience and deliberation. The cedar\r\njoists had been felled with stone axes and rubbed smooth with sand. The\r\nlittle poles that lay across them and held up the clay floor of the\r\nchamber above, were smoothly polished. The door lintels were carefully\r\nfitted (the doors were stone slabs held in place by wooden bars fitted\r\ninto hasps). The clay dressing that covered the stone walls was tinted,\r\nand some of the chambers were frescoed in geometrical patterns, one\r\ncolour laid on another. In one room was a painted border, little tents,\r\nlike Indian tepees, in brilliant red.\r\n\r\nBut the really splendid thing about our city, the thing that made it\r\ndelightful to work there, and must have made it delightful to live\r\nthere, was the setting. The town hung like a bird\'s nest in the cliff,\r\nlooking off into the box canyon below, and beyond into the wide valley\r\nwe called Cow Canyon, facing an ocean of clear air. A people who had the\r\nhardihood to build there, and who lived day after day looking down upon\r\nsuch grandeur, who came and went by those hazardous trails, must have\r\nbeen, as we often told each other, a fine people. But what had become of\r\nthem? What catastrophe had overwhelmed them?\r\n\r\nThey hadn\'t moved away, for they had taken none of their belongings, not\r\neven their clothes. Oh, yes, we found clothes; yucca moccasins, and what\r\nseemed like cotton cloth, woven in black and white. Never any wool, but\r\nsheepskins tanned with the fleece on them. They may have been mountain\r\nsheep; the mesa was full of them. We talked of shooting one for meat,\r\nbut we never did. When a mountain sheep comes out on a ledge hundreds of\r\nfeet above you, with his trumpet horns, there\'s something noble about\r\nhim--he looks like a priest. We didn\'t want to shoot at them and make\r\nthem shy. We liked to see them. We shot a wild cow when we wanted fresh\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nAt last we came upon one of the original inhabitants--not a skeleton,\r\nbut a dried human body, a woman. She was not in the Cliff City; we found\r\nher in a little group of houses stuck up in a high arch we called the\r\nEagle\'s Nest. She was lying on a yucca mat, partly covered with rags,\r\nand she had dried into a mummy in that water-drinking air. We thought\r\nshe had been murdered; there was a great wound in her side, the ribs\r\nstuck out through the dried flesh. Her mouth was open as if she were\r\nscreaming, and her face, through all those years, had kept a look of\r\nterrible agony. Part of the nose was gone, but she had plenty of teeth,\r\nnot one missing, and a great deal of coarse black hair. Her teeth were\r\neven and white, and so little worn that we thought she must have been a\r\nyoung woman. Henry named her Mother Eve, and we called her that. We put\r\nher in a blanket and let her down with great care, and kept her in a\r\nchamber in the Cliff City.\r\n\r\nYes, we found three other bodies, but afterward. One day, working in the\r\nCliff City, we came upon a stone slab at one end of the cavern, that\r\nseemed to lead straight into the rock. It was set in cement, and when we\r\nloosened it we found it opened into a small, dark chamber. In this there\r\nhad been a platform, of fine cedar poles laid side by side, but it had\r\ncrumbled. In the wreckage were three bodies, one man and two women,\r\nwrapped in yucca-fibre, all in the same posture and apparently prepared\r\nfor burial. They were the bodies of old people. We believed they were\r\namong the aged who were left behind when the tribe went down to live on\r\ntheir farms in the summer season; that they had died in the absence of\r\nthe villagers, and were put into this mortuary chamber to await the\r\nreturn of the tribe, when they would have their funeral rites. Probably\r\nthese people burned their dead. Of course an arch\xc3\xa6ologist could have\r\ntold a great deal about that civilization from those bodies. But they\r\nnever got to an archa\xc3\xa6logist--at least, not on this side of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of August came, and everything was going well with us. We\r\nhadn\'t met with any bad luck, and though we had very little money left,\r\nthere was Blake\'s untouched savings account in the bank at Pardee, and\r\nwe had plenty of credit in Tarpin. The merchants there took an interest\r\nand were friendly. But the little new moon, that looked so innocent,\r\nbrought us trouble. We lost old Henry, and in a terrible way. From the\r\nfirst we\'d been a little bothered by rattlesnakes--you generally find\r\nthem about old stone quarries and old masonry. We had got them pretty\r\nwell cleared out of the Cliff City, hadn\'t seen one there for weeks. But\r\none Sunday we took Henry and went on an exploring expedition at the\r\nnorth end of the mesa, along Black Canyon. We caught sight of a little\r\nbunch of ruins we\'d never noticed before, and made a foolhardy scramble\r\nto get up to them. We almost made it, and then there was a stretch of\r\nrock wall so smooth we couldn\'t climb it without a ladder. I was the\r\ntallest of the three, and Henry was the lightest; he thought he could\r\nget up there if he stood on my shoulders. He was standing on my back,\r\nhis head just above the floor of the cavern, groping for something to\r\nhoist himself by, when a snake struck him from the ledge--struck him\r\nsquare in the forehead. It happened in a flash. He came down and brought\r\nthe snake with him. By the time we picked him up and turned him over,\r\nhis face had begun to swell. In ten minutes it was purple, and he was so\r\ncrazy it took the two of us to hold him and keep him from jumping down\r\nthe chasm. He was struck so near the brain that there was nothing to do.\r\nIt lasted nearly two hours. Then we carried him home. Roddy dropped down\r\nthe ladder into Cow Canyon, caught his horse, and rode into Tarpin for\r\nthe coroner. Father Duchene was preaching there at the mission church\r\nthat Sunday, and came back with him.\r\n\r\nWe buried Henry on the mesa. Father Duchene stayed on with us a week to\r\nkeep us company. We were so cut up that we were almost ready to quit.\r\nBut he had been planning to come out to see our find for a long while,\r\nand he got our minds off our trouble. He worked hard every day. He went\r\nover everything we\'d done, and examined everything minutely: the\r\npottery, cloth, stone implements, and the remains of food. He measured\r\nthe heads of the mummies and declared they had good skulls. He cut down\r\none of the old cedars that grew exactly in the middle of the deep trail\r\nworn in the stone, and counted the rings under his pocket microscope.\r\nYou couldn\'t count them with the unassisted eye, for growing out of a\r\ntiny crevice in the rock as that tree did, the increase of each year was\r\nso scant that the rings were invisible except with a glass. The tree he\r\ncut down registered three hundred and thirty-six years\' growth, and it\r\ncould have begun to grow in that well-worn path only after human feet\r\nhad ceased to come and go there.\r\n\r\nWhy had they ceased? That question puzzled him, too. Smallpox, any\r\nepidemic, would have left unburied bodies. Father Duchene suggested what\r\nDr. Ripley, in Washington, afterward surmised: that the tribe had been\r\nexterminated, not here in their stronghold, but in their summer camp,\r\ndown among the farms across the river. Father Duchene had been among the\r\nIndians nearly twenty years then, he had seventeen Indian pueblos in his\r\nparish, and he spoke several Indian dialects. He was able to explain the\r\nuse of many of the implements we found, especially those used in\r\nreligious ceremonies. The night before he left us, he summed up the\r\nresults of his week\'s study, something like this:\r\n\r\n"The two square towers on the mesa top, to which you have given little\r\nattention, were unquestionably granaries. Under the stones and earth\r\nfallen from the walls, there is a quantity of dried corn on the ear. Not\r\na great harvest, for life must have come to an end here in the summer,\r\nwhen the new crop was not yet garnered and the last year\'s grain was\r\ngetting low. The semicircular ridge on the mesa top, which you can see\r\ndistinctly among the pi\xc3\xb1ons when the sun is low and brings it into high\r\nrelief, is the buried wall of an amphitheatre, where probably religious\r\nexercises and games took place. I advise you not to dig into it. It is\r\nprobably the most important thing here, and should be left for scholars\r\nto excavate.\r\n\r\n"The tower you so much admire in the cliff village may have been a watch\r\ntower, as you think, but from the curious placing of those narrow slits,\r\nlike windows, I believe it was used for astronomical observations. I am\r\ninclined to think that your tribe were a superior people. Perhaps they\r\nwere not so when they first came upon this mesa, but in an orderly and\r\nsecure life they developed considerably the arts of peace. There is\r\nevidence on every hand that they lived for something more than food and\r\nshelter. They had an appreciation of comfort, and went even further than\r\nthat. Their life, compared to that of our roving Navajos, must have been\r\nquite complex. There is unquestionably a distinct feeling for design in\r\nwhat you call the Cliff City. Buildings are not grouped like that by\r\npure accident, though convenience probably had much to do with it.\r\nConvenience often dictates very sound design.\r\n\r\n"The workmanship on both the wood and stone of the dwellings is good.\r\nThe shapes and decoration of the water jars and food bowls is better\r\nthan in any of the existing pueblos I know, better even than the pottery\r\nmade at Acoma. I have seen a collection of early pottery from the island\r\nof Crete. Many of the geometrical decorations on these jars are not only\r\nsimilar, but, if my memory is trustworthy, identical.\r\n\r\n"I see your tribe as a provident, rather thoughtful people, who made\r\ntheir livelihood secure by raising crops and fowl--the great number of\r\nturkey bones and feathers are evidence that they had domesticated the\r\nwild turkey. With grain in their store-rooms, and mountain sheep and\r\ndeer for their quarry, they rose gradually from the condition of\r\nsavagery. With the proper variation of meat and vegetable diet, they\r\ndeveloped physically and improved in the primitive arts. They had looms\r\nand mills, and experimented with dyes. At the same time, they possibly\r\ndeclined in the arts of war, in brute strength and ferocity.\r\n\r\n"I see them here, isolated, cut off from other tribes, working out their\r\ndestiny, making their mesa more and more worthy to be a home for man,\r\npurifying life by religious ceremonies and observances, caring\r\nrespectfully for their dead, protecting the children, doubtless\r\nentertaining some feelings of affection and sentiment for this\r\nstronghold where they were at once so safe and so comfortable, where\r\nthey had practically overcome the worst hardships that primitive man had\r\nto fear. They were, perhaps, too far advanced for their time and\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n"They were probably wiped out, utterly exterminated, by some roving\r\nIndian tribe without culture or domestic virtues, some horde that fell\r\nupon them in their summer camp and destroyed them for their hides and\r\nclothing and weapons, or from mere love of slaughter. I feel sure that\r\nthese brutal invaders never even learned of the existence of this mesa,\r\nhoneycombed with habitations. If they had come here, they would have\r\ndestroyed. They killed and went their way.\r\n\r\n"What I cannot understand is why you have not found more human remains.\r\nThe three bodies you found in the mortuary chamber were prepared for\r\nburial by the old people who were left behind. But what of the last\r\nsurvivors? It is possible that when autumn wore on, and no one returned\r\nfrom the farms, the aged banded together, went in search of their\r\npeople, and perished in the plain.\r\n\r\n"Like you, I feel a reverence for this place. Wherever humanity has made\r\nthat hardest of all starts and lifted itself out of mere brutality, is a\r\nsacred spot. Your people were cut off here without the influence of\r\nexample or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for\r\norder and security. They built themselves into this mesa and humanized\r\nit."\r\n\r\nFather Duchene warmly agreed with Blake that I ought to go to Washington\r\nand make some report to the Government, so that the proper specialists\r\nwould be sent out to study the remains we had found.\r\n\r\n"You must go to the Director of the Smithsonian Institution," he said.\r\n"He will send us an arch\xc3\xa6ologist who will interpret all that is obscure\r\nto us. He will revive this civilization in a scholarly work. It may be\r\nthat you will have thrown light on some important points in the history\r\nof your country."\r\n\r\nAfter he left us, Blake and I began to make definite plans for my trip\r\nto Washington. Blake was to work on the railroad that winter and save as\r\nmuch money as possible. The expense of my journey would be paid out of\r\nwhat we called the jack-pot account, in the bank at Pardee. All our\r\nfurther expenses on the mesa would be paid by the Government. Roddy\r\noften hinted that we would get a substantial reward of some kind. When\r\nwe broke or lost anything at our work, he used to smile and say: "Never\r\nmind. I guess our Uncle Sam will make that good to us."\r\n\r\nWe had a beautiful autumn that year, soft, sunny, like a dream. Even up\r\nthere in the air we had so little wind that the gold hung on the poplars\r\nand quaking aspens late in November. We stayed out on the mesa until\r\nafter Christmas. We wanted our arch\xc3\xa6ologist, when he came, to find\r\neverything in good order. We cleared up any litter we\'d made in digging\r\nthings out, stored all the specimens, even the mummies, in our cabin,\r\nand padlocked the doors and windows before we left it. I had written up\r\nmy day-book carefully to the very end, had even written out some of\r\nFather Duchene\'s deductions. This book I left in concealment on the\r\nmesa. I climbed up to the Eagle\'s Nest in which we had found the mummy\r\nof the murdered woman we called Mother Eve, where I had noticed a\r\nparticularly neat little cupboard in the wall. I put my book in this\r\nniche and sealed it up with cement. Mother Eve had greatly interested\r\nFather Duchene, by the way. He laughed and said she was well named. He\r\ndidn\'t believe her death could throw any light on the destruction of her\r\npeople. "I seem to smell," he said slyly, "a personal tragedy. Perhaps\r\nwhen the tribe went down to the summer camp, our lady was sick and would\r\nnot go. Perhaps her husband thought it worth while to return unannounced\r\nfrom the farms some night, and found her in improper company. The young\r\nman may have escaped. In primitive society the husband is allowed to\r\npunish an unfaithful wife with death."\r\n\r\nWhen the first snow began to fly, we said good-bye to our mesa and rode\r\ninto Tarpin. It took several days to outfit me for my journey to\r\nWashington. We bought a trunk (I\'d never owned one in my life), and a\r\nsupply of white shirts, an overcoat that was as heavy as lead and just\r\nabout as cold, and two suits of clothes. That conscienceless trader\r\nworked off on me a clawhammer coat he must have had in stock for twenty\r\nyears. He easily persuaded Roddy that it was the proper thing for dress\r\noccasions. I think Roddy expected that I would be received by\r\nambassadors--perhaps I did.\r\n\r\nRoddy drew six hundred dollars out of the bank to stake me, and bought\r\nmy ticket and Pullman through to Washington. He went to the station with\r\nme the morning I left, and a hard handshake was good-bye.\r\n\r\nFor a long while after my train pulled out, I could see our mesa bulking\r\nup blue on the sky-line. I hated to leave it, but I reflected that it\r\nhad taken care of itself without me for a good many hundred years. When\r\nI saw it again, I told myself, I would have done my duty by it; I would\r\nbring back with me men who would understand it, who would appreciate it\r\nand dig out all its secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI got off the train, just behind the Capitol building, one cold bright\r\nJanuary morning. I stood for a long while watching the white dome\r\nagainst a flashing blue sky, with a very religious feeling. After I had\r\nwalked about a little and seen the parks, so green though it was winter,\r\nand the Treasury building, and the War and Navy, I decided to put off my\r\nbusiness for a little and give myself a week to enjoy the city. That was\r\nthe most sensible thing I did while I was there. For that week I was\r\nwonderfully happy.\r\n\r\nMy sightseeing over, I got to work. First I went to see the\r\nRepresentative from our district, to ask for letters of introduction. He\r\nwas cordial enough, but he gave me bad advice. He was very positive that\r\nI ought to report to the Indian Commission, and gave me a letter to the\r\nCommissioner. The Commissioner was out of town, and I wasted three days\r\nwaiting about his office, being questioned by clerks and secretaries.\r\nThey were not very busy, and seemed to find me entertaining. I thought\r\nthey were interested in my mission, and interest was what I wanted to\r\narouse. I didn\'t know how influential these people might be--they talked\r\nas if they had great authority. I had brought along in my telescope bag\r\nsome good pieces of pottery--not the best, I was afraid of accident, but\r\nsome that were representative--and all the photographs Blake and I had\r\ntaken. We had only a small kodak, and these pictures didn\'t make much\r\nshow,--looked, indeed, like grubby little \'dobe ruins such as one can\r\nfind almost anywhere. They gave no idea of the beauty and vastness of\r\nthe setting. The clerks at the Indian Commission seemed very curious\r\nabout everything and made me talk a lot. I was green and didn\'t know any\r\nbetter. But when one of the fellows there tried to get me to give him my\r\nbest bowl for his cigarette ashes, I began to suspect the nature of\r\ntheir interest.\r\n\r\nAt last the Commissioner returned, but he had pressing engagements, and\r\nI hung around several days more before he would see me. After\r\nquestioning me for about half an hour, he told me that his business was\r\nwith living Indians, not dead ones, and that his office should have\r\ninformed me of that in the beginning. He advised me to go back to our\r\nCongressman and get a letter to the Smithsonian Institution. I packed up\r\nmy pottery and got out of the place, feeling pretty sore. The head clerk\r\nfollowed me down the corridor and asked me what I\'d take for that little\r\nbowl he\'d taken a fancy to. He said it had no market value, I\'d find\r\nWashington full of such things; there were cases of them in the cellar\r\nat the Smithsonian that they\'d never taken the trouble to unpack, hadn\'t\r\nany place to put them.\r\n\r\nI went back to my Congressman. This time he wasn\'t so friendly as\r\nbefore, but he gave me a letter to the Smithsonian. There I went through\r\nthe same experience. The Director couldn\'t be seen except by\r\nappointment, and his secretary had to be convinced that your business\r\nwas important before he would give you an appointment with his chief.\r\nAfter the first morning I found it difficult to see even the secretary.\r\nHe was always engaged. I was told to take a seat and wait, but when he\r\nwas disengaged he was hurrying off to luncheon. I would sit there all\r\nmorning with a group of unfortunate people: girls who wanted to get\r\ntype-writing to do, nice polite old men who wanted to be taken out on\r\nsurveys and expeditions next summer. The secretary would at last come\r\nout with his overcoat on, and would hurry through the waiting-room\r\nreading a letter or a report, without looking up.\r\n\r\nThe office assistants cheered me along, and I kept this up for some\r\ndays, sitting all morning in that room, studying the patterns of the\r\nrugs, and the shoes of the patient waiters who came as regularly as I.\r\nOne day after the secretary had gone out, his stenographer, a nice\r\nlittle Virginia girl, came and sat down in an empty chair next to mine\r\nand began talking to me. She wasn\'t pretty, but her kind eyes and soft\r\nSouthern voice took hold of me at once. She wanted to know what I had in\r\nmy telescope, and why I was there, and where I came from, and all about\r\nit. Nearly everyone else had gone out to lunch--that seemed to be the\r\none thing they did regularly in Washington--and we had the waiting-room\r\nto ourselves. I talked to her a good deal. Her name was Virginia Ward.\r\nShe was a tiny little thing, but she had lovely eyes and such gentle\r\nways. She seemed indignant that I had been put off so long after having\r\ncome so far.\r\n\r\n"Now you just let me fix it up for you," she said at last. "Mr. Wagner\r\nis bothered by a great many foolish people who waste his time, and he is\r\nsuspicious. The best way will be for you to invite him to lunch with\r\nyou. I\'ll arrange it. I keep a list of his appointments, and I know he\r\nis not engaged for luncheon to-morrow. I\'ll tell him that he is to lunch\r\nwith a nice boy who has come all the way from New Mexico to inform the\r\nDepartment about an important discovery. I\'ll tell him to meet you at\r\nthe Shoreham, at one. That\'s expensive, but it would do no good to\r\ninvite him to a cheap place. And, remember, you must ask him to order\r\nthe luncheon. It will maybe cost you ten dollars, but it will get you\r\nsomewhere."\r\n\r\nI felt grateful to the nice little thing,--she wasn\'t older than I. I\r\nbegged her wouldn\'t she please come to lunch with me herself to-day, and\r\ntalk to me.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" she said, blushing red as a poppy. "Why, I\'m afraid you\r\nthink----"\r\n\r\nI told her I didn\'t think anything but how nice she was to me, and how\r\nlonesome I was. She went with me, but she wouldn\'t go to any swell\r\nplace. She told me a great many useful things.\r\n\r\n"If you want to get attention from anybody in Washin\'ton," she said,\r\n"ask them to lunch. People here will do almost anything for a good\r\nlunch."\r\n\r\n"But the Director of the Smithsonian, for instance," I said, "surely you\r\ndon\'t mean that the high-up ones like that----? Why would he want to\r\nbother with a cow-puncher from New Mexico, when he can lunch with\r\nscientists and ambassadors?"\r\n\r\nShe had a pretty little fluttery Southern laugh. "You just name a hotel\r\nlike the Shoreham to the Director, and try it! There has to be somebody\r\nto pay for a lunch, and the scientists and ambassadors don\'t do that\r\nwhen they can avoid it. He\'d accept your invitation, and the next time\r\nhe went to dine with the Secretary of State he\'d make a nice little\r\nstory of it, and paint you up so pretty you\'d hardly know yourself."\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her whether I\'d better take my pottery--it was there under\r\nthe table between us--to the Shoreham to show Mr. Wagner, she tittered\r\nagain. "I wouldn\'t bother. If you show him enough of the Shoreham\r\npottery, that will be more effective."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when the secretary arrived at his office, he stopped\r\nby my chair and said he understood he had an engagement with me for one\r\no\'clock. That was a good idea, he added: his mind was freer when he was\r\naway from office routine.\r\n\r\nI had been in Washington twenty-two days when I took the secretary out\r\nto lunch. It was an excellent lunch. We had a bottle of Chateau d\'Yquem.\r\nI\'d never heard of such a wine before, but I remember it because it cost\r\nfive dollars. I drank only one glass, and that pleased him too, for he\r\ndrank the rest. Though he was friendly and talked a great deal, my heart\r\nsank lower, for he wouldn\'t let me explain my mission to him at all. He\r\nkept telling me that he knew all about the South-west. He had been sent\r\nby the Smithsonian to conduct parties of European arch\xc3\xa6ologists through\r\nall the show places, Frijoles and Canyon de Chelly, and Taos and the\r\nHopi pueblos. When some Austrian Archduke had gone to hunt in the Pecos\r\nrange, he had been sent by his chief and the German ambassador to manage\r\nthe tour, and he had done it with such success that both he and the\r\nDirector were given decorations from the Austrian Crown, in recognition\r\nof his services. Then I had to listen to a long story about how well he\r\nwas treated by the Archduke when he went to Vienna with his chief the\r\nfollowing summer. I had to hear about balls and receptions, and the\r\nnames and titles of all the people he had met at the Duke\'s country\r\nestate. I was amazed and ashamed that a man of fifty, a man of the\r\nworld, a scholar with ever so many degrees, should find it worth his\r\nwhile to show off before a boy, and a boy of such humble pretensions,\r\nwho didn\'t know how to eat the _hors d\'\xc5\x93uvres_ any more than if an\r\nassortment of cocoanuts had been set before him with no hammer.\r\n\r\nImagine my astonishment when, as he was drinking his liqueur, he said\r\ncarelessly: "By the way, I was successful in arranging an interview with\r\nthe Director for you. He will see you at four o\'clock on Monday."\r\n\r\nThat was Thursday. I spent the time between then and Monday trying to\r\nfind out something more about the kind of people I had come among. I\r\npersuaded Virginia Ward to go to the theatre with me, and she told me\r\nthat it always took a long while to get anything through with the\r\nDirector, that I mustn\'t lose heart, and she would always be glad to\r\ncheer me up. She lived with her mother, a widow lady, and they had me\r\ncome to dinner and were very nice to me.\r\n\r\nAll this time I was living with a young married couple who interested me\r\nvery much, for they were unlike any people I had ever known. The husband\r\nwas "in office," as they say there, he had some position in the War\r\nDepartment. How it did use to depress me to see all the hundreds of\r\nclerks come pouring out of that big building at sunset! Their lives\r\nseemed to me so petty, so slavish. The couple I lived with gave me a\r\nprejudice against that kind of life. I couldn\'t help knowing a good deal\r\nabout their affairs. They had only a small flat, and rented me one room\r\nof it, so I was very much in their confidence and couldn\'t help\r\noverhearing. They asked me not to mention the fact that I paid rent, as\r\nthey had told their friends I was making them a visit. It was like that\r\nin everything; they spent their lives trying to keep up appearances, and\r\nto make his salary do more than it could. When they weren\'t discussing\r\nwhere she should go in the summer, they talked about the promotions in\r\nhis department; how much the other clerks got and how they spent it, how\r\nmany new dresses their wives had. And there was always a struggle going\r\non for an invitation to a dinner or a reception, or even a tea-party.\r\nWhen once they got the invitation they had been scheming for, then came\r\nthe terrible question of what Mrs. Bixby should wear.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War gave a reception; there was to be dancing and a\r\ngreat showing of foreign uniforms. The Bixbys were in painful suspense\r\nuntil they got a card. Then for a week they talked about nothing but\r\nwhat Mrs. Bixby was going to wear. They decided that for such an\r\noccasion she must have a new dress. Bixby borrowed twenty-five dollars\r\nfrom me, and took his lunch hour to go shopping with his wife and choose\r\nthe satin. That seemed to me very strange. In New Mexico the Indian boys\r\nsometimes went to a trader\'s with their wives and bought shawls or\r\ncalico, and we thought it rather contemptible. On the night of the\r\nreception the Bixbys set off gaily in a cab; the dress they considered a\r\ngreat success. But they had bad luck. Somebody spilt claret-cup on Mrs.\r\nBixby\'s skirt before the evening was half over, and when they got home\r\nthat night I heard her weeping and reproaching him for having been so\r\nupset about it, and looking at nothing but her ruined dress all evening.\r\nShe said he cried out when it happened. I don\'t doubt it.\r\n\r\nEvery cab, every party, was more than they could afford. If he lost an\r\numbrella, it was a real misfortune. He wasn\'t lazy, he wasn\'t a fool,\r\nand he meant to be honest; but he was intimidated by that miserable sort\r\nof departmental life. He didn\'t know anything else. He thought working\r\nin a store or a bank not respectable. Living with the Bixbys gave me a\r\nkind of low-spiritedness I had never known before. During my days of\r\nwaiting for appointments, I used to walk for hours around the fence that\r\nshuts in the White House grounds, and watch the Washington monument\r\ncolour with those beautiful sunsets, until the time when all the clerks\r\nstreamed out of the Treasury building and the War and Navy. Thousands of\r\nthem, all more or less like the couple I lived with. They seemed to me\r\nlike people in slavery, who ought to be free. I remember the city\r\nchiefly by those beautiful, hazy, sad sunsets, white columns and green\r\nshrubbery, and the monument shaft still pink while the stars were coming\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI got my interview with the Director of the Smithsonian at last. He gave\r\nme his attention, he was interested. He told me to come again in three\r\ndays and meet Dr. Ripley, who was the authority on prehistoric Indian\r\nremains and had excavated a lot of them. Then came an exciting and\r\nrather encouraging time for me. Dr. Ripley asked the right sort of\r\nquestions, and evidently knew his business. He said he\'d like to take\r\nthe first train down to my mesa. But it required money to excavate, and\r\nhe had none. There was a bill up before Congress for an appropriation.\r\nWe\'d have to wait. I must use my influence with my Representative. He\r\ntook my pottery to study it. (I never got it back, by the way.) There\r\nwas a Dr. Fox, connected with the Smithsonian, who was also interested.\r\nThey told me a good many things I wanted to know, and kept me dangling\r\nabout the office. Of course they were very kind to take so much trouble\r\nwith a green boy. But I soon found that the Director and all his staff\r\nhad one interest which dwarfed every other. There was to be an\r\nInternational Exposition of some sort in Europe the following summer,\r\nand they were all pulling strings to get appointed on juries or sent to\r\ninternational congresses--appointments that would pay their expenses\r\nabroad, and give them a salary in addition. There was, indeed, a bill\r\nbefore Congress for appropriations for the Smithsonian; but there was\r\nalso a bill for Exposition appropriations, and that was the one they\r\nwere really pushing. They kept me hanging on through March and April,\r\nbut in the end it came to nothing. Dr. Ripley told me he was sorry, but\r\nthe sum Congress had allowed the Smithsonian wouldn\'t cover an\r\nexpedition to the South-west.\r\n\r\nVirginia Ward, who had been so kind to me, went out to lunch with me\r\nthat day, and admitted I had been let down. She was almost as much\r\ndisappointed as I. She said the only thing Dr. Ripley really cared about\r\nwas getting a free trip to Europe and acting on a jury, and maybe\r\ngetting a decoration. "And that\'s what the Director wants, too," she\r\nsaid. "They don\'t care much about dead and gone Indians. What they do\r\ncare about is going to Paris, and getting another ribbon on their\r\ncoats."\r\n\r\nThe only other person besides Virginia who was genuinely concerned about\r\nmy affair was a young Frenchman, a lieutenant attached to the French\r\nEmbassy, who came to the Smithsonian often on business connected with\r\nthis same International Exposition. He was nice and polite to Virginia,\r\nand she introduced him to me. We used to walk down along the Potomac\r\ntogether. He studied my photographs and asked me such intelligent\r\nquestions about everything that it was a pleasure to talk to him. He had\r\na fine attitude about it all; he was thoughtful, critical, and\r\nrespectful. I feel sure he\'d have gone back to New Mexico with me if\r\nhe\'d had the money. He was even poorer than I.\r\n\r\nI was utterly ashamed to go home to Roddy, dead broke after all the\r\nmoney I\'d spent, and without a thing to show for it. I hung on in\r\nWashington through May, trying to get a job of some sort, to at least\r\nearn my fare home. My letters to Blake had been pretty blue for some\r\ntime back. If I\'d been sensible, I\'d have kept my troubles to myself. He\r\nwas easily discouraged, and I knew that. At last I had to write him for\r\nmoney to go home. It was slow in coming, and I began to telegraph. I\r\nleft Washington at last, wiser than I came. I had no plans, I wanted\r\nnothing but to get back to the mesa and live a free life and breathe\r\nfree air, and never, never again to see hundreds of little black-coated\r\nmen pouring out of white buildings. Queer, how much more depressing they\r\nare than workmen coming out of a factory.\r\n\r\nI was terribly disappointed when I got off the train at Tarpin and Roddy\r\nwasn\'t at the station to meet me. It was late in the afternoon, almost\r\ndark, and I went straight to the livery stable to ask Bill Hook for news\r\nof Blake. Hook, you remember, had done all our hauling for us, and had\r\nbeen a good friend. He gave me a glad hand and said Blake was out on the\r\nmesa.\r\n\r\n"I expect maybe he\'s had his feelings hurt here. He\'s been shy of this\r\ntown lately. You see, Tom, folks weren\'t bothered none about that mesa\r\nso long as you fellows were playing Robinson Crusoe out there, digging\r\nup curios. But when it leaked out that Blake had got a lot of money for\r\nyour stuff, then they begun to feel jealous--said them ruins didn\'t\r\nbelong to Blake any more than to anybody else. It\'ll blow over in time;\r\npeople are always like that when money changes hands. But right now\r\nthere\'s a good deal of bad feeling."\r\n\r\nI told him I didn\'t know what he was talking about.\r\n\r\n"You mean you ain\'t heard about the German, Fechtig? Well, Rodney\'s got\r\nsome surprise waiting for you! Why, he\'s had the damnedest luck! He\'s\r\ncleaned up a neat little pile on your stuff."\r\n\r\nI begged him to tell me what stuff he meant.\r\n\r\n"Why, your curios. This German, Fechtig, come along; he\'d been buying up\r\na lot of Indian things out here, and he bought your whole outfit and\r\npaid four thousand dollars down for it. The transaction made quite a\r\nstir here in Tarpin. I\'m not kicking. I made a good thing out of it. My\r\nmules were busy three weeks packing the stuff out of there on their\r\nbacks, and I held the Dutchman up for a fancy price. He had packing\r\ncases made at the wagon shop and took \'em up to the mesa full of straw\r\nand sawdust, and packed the curios out there. I lost one of my mules,\r\ntoo. You remember Jenny? Well, they were leading her down with a big box\r\non her, and right there where the trail runs so narrow around a bump in\r\nthe cliff above Black Canyon, she lost her balance and fell clean to the\r\nbottom, her load on her. Pretty near a thousand feet, I guess. We never\r\nwent down to hold a post-mortem, but Fechtig paid for her like a\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\nI remember I sat down on the sofa in Hook\'s office because I couldn\'t\r\nstand up any longer, and the smell of the horse blankets began to make\r\nme deathly sick. In a minute I went over, like a girl in a novel. Hook\r\npulled me out on the sidewalk and gave me some whisky out of his pocket\r\nflask.\r\n\r\nWhen I felt better I asked him how long this German had been gone, and\r\nwhat he had done with the things.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he cleared out three weeks ago. He didn\'t waste no time. He treated\r\neverybody well, though; nobody\'s sore at him. It\'s your partner they\'re\r\nturned against. Fechtig took the stuff right along with him, chartered a\r\nfreight car, and travelled in the car with it. I reckon it\'s on the\r\nwater by now. He took it straight through into Old Mexico, and was to\r\nload it on a French boat. Seems he was afraid of having trouble getting\r\ncuriosities out of the United States ports. You know you can take\r\nanything out of the City of Mexico."\r\n\r\nI had heard all I wanted to hear. I went to the hotel, got a room, and\r\nlay down without undressing to wait for daylight. Hook was to drive me\r\nand my trunk out to the mesa early the next morning. All I\'d been\r\nthrough in Washington was nothing to what I went through that night. I\r\nthought Blake must have lost his mind. I didn\'t for a minute believe\r\nhe\'d meant to sell me out, but I cursed his stupidity and presumption. I\r\nhad never told him just how I felt about those things we\'d dug out\r\ntogether, it was the kind of thing one doesn\'t talk about directly. But\r\nhe must have known; he couldn\'t have lived with me all summer and fall\r\nwithout knowing. And yet, until that night, I had never known myself\r\nthat I cared more about them than about anything else in the world.\r\n\r\nAt the first blink of daylight I jumped up from my damnable bed and went\r\nround to the stable to rout Hook out of his bunk. We had breakfast and\r\ngot out of town with his best team. On the way to the mesa we had a\r\nbreak-down, one of the old dry wheels smashed to splinters. Hook had to\r\nunhitch and ride back to Tarpin and get another. Everything took an\r\nunreasonably long time, and the afternoon was half gone when he put me\r\nand my trunk down at the foot of the Black Canyon trail. Every inch of\r\nthat trail was dear to me, every delicate curve about the old pi\xc3\xb1on\r\nroots, every chancy track along the face of the cliffs, and the deep\r\nwindings back into shrubbery and safety. The wild-currant bushes were in\r\nbloom, and where the path climbed the side of a narrow ravine, the scent\r\nof them in the sun was so heavy that it made me soft, made me want to\r\nlie down and sleep. I wanted to see and touch everything, like home-sick\r\nchildren when they come home.\r\n\r\nWhen I pulled out on top of the mesa, the rays of sunlight fell\r\nslantingly through the little twisted pi\xc3\xb1ons,--the light was all in\r\nbetween them, as red as a daylight fire, they fairly swam in it. Once\r\nagain I had that glorious feeling that I\'ve never had anywhere else, the\r\nfeeling of being on mesa, in a world above the world. And the air, my\r\nGod, what air!--Soft, tingling, gold, hot with an edge of chill on it,\r\nfull of the smell of pi\xc3\xb1ons--it was like breathing the sun, breathing\r\nthe colour of the sky. Down there behind me was the plain, already\r\nstreaked with shadow, violet and purple and burnt orange until it met\r\nthe horizon. Before me was the flat mesa top, thinly sprinkled with old\r\ncedars that were not much taller than I, though their twisted trunks\r\nwere almost as thick as my body. I struck off across it, my long black\r\nshadow going ahead.\r\n\r\nI made straight for the cabin, it was about three miles from the spot\r\nwhere the trail emerged at the top. I saw smoke rising before I could\r\nsee the hut itself. Blake was in the doorway when I got there. I didn\'t\r\nlook at his face, but I could feel that he looked at mine.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say anything, Tom. Don\'t rip me up until you hear all about it,"\r\nhe said as I came toward him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard enough to about do for me," I blurted out. "What made you do\r\nit, Blake? What made you do it?"\r\n\r\n"It was a chance in a million, boy. There wasn\'t any time to consult\r\nyou. There\'s only one man in thousands that wants to buy relics and pay\r\nreal money for them. I could see how your Washington campaign was coming\r\nout. I know you\'d thought about big figures, so had I. But that was all\r\na pipe dream. Four thousand\'s not so bad, you don\'t pick it up every\r\nday. And he bore all the expenses. Why, it was a terrible expensive job,\r\ngetting all that frail stuff out of here. Who else would have bought it,\r\nI want to know? We\'d have had to pack it around at Harvey Houses,\r\nselling it at a dollar a bowl, like the poor Indians do. I took the best\r\nchance going, for both of us, Tom."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t say anything, because there was too much to say. I stood\r\noutside the cabin until the gold light went blue and a few stars came\r\nout, hardly brighter than the bright sky they twinkled in, and the\r\nswallows came flying over us, on their way to their nests in the cliffs.\r\nIt was the time of day when everything goes home. From habit and from\r\nweariness I went in through the door. The kitchen table was spread for\r\nsupper, I could smell a rabbit stew cooking on the stove. Blake lit the\r\nlantern and begged me to eat my supper. I didn\'t go into the bunk-room,\r\nfor I knew the shelves in there were empty. I heard Blake talking to me\r\nas you hear people talking when you are asleep.\r\n\r\n"Who else would have bought them?" he kept saying. "Folks make a lot of\r\nfuss over such things, but they don\'t want to pay good money for them."\r\n\r\nWhen I at last told him that such a thing as selling them had never\r\nentered my head, I\'m sure he thought I was lying. He reminded me about\r\nhow we used to talk of getting big money from the Government.\r\n\r\nI admitted I\'d hoped we\'d be paid for our work, and maybe get a bonus of\r\nsome kind, for our discovery. "But I never thought of selling them,\r\nbecause they weren\'t mine to sell--nor yours! They belonged to this\r\ncountry, to the State, and to all the people. They belonged to boys like\r\nyou and me, that have no other ancestors to inherit from. You\'ve gone\r\nand sold them to a country that\'s got plenty of relics of its own.\r\nYou\'ve gone and sold your country\'s secrets, like Dreyfus."\r\n\r\n"That man was innocent. It was a frame-up," Blake murmured. It was a\r\npoint he would never pass up.\r\n\r\n"Whether he\'s guilty or not, you are! If there was only anybody in\r\nWashington I could telegraph to, and have that German held up at the\r\nport!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. If there was anybody in Washington that cared a damn, I\r\nwouldn\'t have sold \'em. But you pretty well found out there ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"We could have kept them, then," I told him. "I\'ve got a strong back.\r\nI\'m not so poor that I have to sell the pots and pans that belonged to\r\nmy poor grandmothers a thousand years ago. I made all my plans on the\r\ntrain, coming back." (It was a lie, I hadn\'t.) "I meant to get a job on\r\nthe railroad and keep our find right here, and come back to it when I\r\nhad a lay-off. I think a lot more of it now than before I went to\r\nWashington. And after a while, when that Exposition is over and the\r\nSmithsonian people get home, they would come out here all right. I\'ve\r\nlearned enough from them so that I could go on with it myself."\r\n\r\nBlake reminded me that I had my way to make in the world, and that I\r\nwanted to go to school. "That money\'s in the bank this minute, in your\r\nname, and you\'re going to college on it. You\'re not going to be a\r\nday-labourer like me. After you\'ve got your sheepskin, then you can\r\ndivide with me.\r\n\r\n"You think I\'d touch that money?" I looked squarely at him for the first\r\ntime. "No more than if you\'d stolen it. You made the sale. Get what you\r\ncan out of it. I want to ask you one question: did you ever think I was\r\ndigging those things up for what I could sell them for?"\r\n\r\nRodney explained that he knew I cared about the things, and was proud of\r\nthem, but he\'d always supposed I meant to "realize" on them, just as he\r\ndid, and that it would come to money in the end. "Everything does," he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n"If that nice young Frenchman I met had come down here with me, and\r\noffered me four million instead of four thousand, I\'d have refused him.\r\nThere never was any question of money with me, where this mesa and its\r\npeople were concerned. They were something that had been preserved\r\nthrough the ages by a miracle, and handed on to you and me, two poor\r\ncow-punchers, rough and ignorant, but I thought we were men enough to\r\nkeep a trust. I\'d as soon have sold my own grandmother as Mother\r\nEve--I\'d have sold any living woman first."\r\n\r\n"Save your tears," said Roddy grimly. "She refused to leave us. She went\r\nto the bottom of Black Canyon and carried Hook\'s best mule along with\r\nher. They had to make her box extra wide, and she crowded Jenny out an\r\ninch or so too far from the canyon wall."\r\n\r\nThis painful interview went on for hours. I walked up and down the\r\nkitchen trying to make Blake understand the kind of value those objects\r\nhad had for me. Unfortunately, I succeeded. He sat slumping on the\r\nbench, his elbows on the table, shading his eyes from the lantern with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need to keep this up," he said at last. "You\'re away out of\r\nmy depth, but I think I get you. You might have given me some of this\r\nFourth of July talk a little earlier in the game. I didn\'t know you\r\nvalued that stuff any different than anything else a fellow might run on\r\nto: a gold mine or a pocket of turquoise."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you gave him my diary along with the rest?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Blake, his voice growing gloomier and darker, "that\'s in the\r\nEagle\'s Nest, where you hid it. That\'s your private property. I supposed\r\nI had some share in the relics we dug up--you always spoke of it that\r\nway. But I see now I was working for you like a hired man, and while you\r\nwere away I sold your property."\r\n\r\nI said again it wasn\'t mine or his. He took something out of the pocket\r\nof his flannel shirt and laid it on the table. I saw it was a bank\r\npassbook, with my name on the yellow cover.\r\n\r\n"You may as well keep it," I said. "I\'ll never touch it. You had no\r\nright to deposit it in my name. The townspeople are sore about the\r\nmoney, and they\'ll hold it against me."\r\n\r\n"No they won\'t. Can\'t you trust me to fix that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I can trust you with, Blake. I don\'t know where I\'m\r\nat with you," I said.\r\n\r\nHe got up and began putting on his coat. "Motives don\'t count, eh?" he\r\nsaid, his face turned away, as he put his arm into the sleeve.\r\n\r\n"They would in anything of our own, between you and me," I told him. "If\r\nit was my money you\'d lost gambling, or my girl you\'d made free with, we\r\ncould fight it out, and maybe be friends again. But this is different."\r\n\r\n"I see. You make it clear." He was quietly stirring around as he spoke.\r\nHe got his old knap-sack off its nail on the wall, opened his trunk and\r\ntook out some underwear and socks and a couple of shirts. After he had\r\nput these into the bag, he slung it over one shoulder, and his canvas\r\nwater-bag over the other. I let these preparations go on without a word.\r\nHe went to the cupboard over the stove and put some sticks of chocolate\r\ninto his pocket, then his pipe and a bag of tobacco. Presently I said\r\nhe\'d break his neck if he tried riding down the trail in the dark.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not riding the trail," he replied curtly. "I\'m going down the quick\r\nway. My horse is grazing in Cow Canyon."\r\n\r\n"I noticed the river\'s high. It\'s dangerous crossing," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"I got over that way a few days ago. I\'m surprised at you, using such\r\ncommon expressions!" he said sarcastically. "_Dangerous crossing_; it\'s\r\npainted on signboards all over the world!" He walked out of the cabin\r\nwithout looking back. I followed him to the V-shaped break in the rim\r\nrock, hardly larger than a man\'s body, where the spliced tree-trunks\r\nmade a swinging ladder down the face of the cliff. I wanted to protest,\r\nbut only succeeded in finding fault.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll catch your knap-sack on those forks and come to grief."\r\n\r\n"That\'s my look-out."\r\n\r\nBy this time my eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness, and I could\r\nsee Blake quite clearly--the stubborn, crouching set of his shoulders\r\nthat I used to notice when he first came to Pardee and was drinking all\r\nthe time. There was an ache in my arms to reach out and detain him, but\r\nthere was something else that made me absolutely powerless to do so. He\r\nstepped down and settled his foot into the first fork. Then he stopped a\r\nmoment and straightened his pack, buttoned his coat up to the chin, and\r\npulled his hat on tighter. There was always a night draught in the\r\ncanyon. He gripped the trunk with his hands. "Well," he said with grim\r\ncheerfulness, "here\'s luck! And I\'m glad it\'s you that\'s doing this to\r\nme, Tom; not me that\'s doing it to you."\r\n\r\nHis head disappeared below the rim. I could hear the trees creak under\r\nhis heavy body, and the chains rattle a little at the splicings. I lay\r\ndown on the ledge and listened. I could hear him for a long way down,\r\nand the sounds were comforting to me, though I didn\'t realize it. Then\r\nthe silence closed in. I went to sleep that night hoping I would never\r\nwaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the whinnying of my saddle-horse in the shed roused me.\r\nI took him down to the foot of the trail where I\'d left my trunk, and\r\npacked my things up to the cabin on his back. I sat up late that night,\r\nwaiting for Blake, though I knew he wouldn\'t come. A few days later I\r\nrode into Tarpin for news of him. Bill Hook showed me Roddy\'s horse. He\r\nhad sold him to the barn for sixty dollars. The station-master told me\r\nBlake had bought a ticket to Winslow, Arizona. I wired the\r\nstation-master and the dispatcher at Winslow, but they could give me no\r\ninformation. Father Duchene came along, on his rounds, and I told him\r\nthe whole story.\r\n\r\nHe thought Blake would come back sometime, that I\'d only miss him if I\r\nwent out to look for him. He advised me to stay on the mesa that summer\r\nand get ahead with my studies, work up my Spanish grammar and my Latin.\r\nHe had friends all along the Santa F\xc3\xa9, and he was sure we could catch\r\nBlake by advertising in the local papers along the road; Albuquerque,\r\nWinslow, Flagstaff, Williams, Los Angeles. After a few days with him, I\r\nwent back to the mesa to wait.\r\n\r\nI\'ll never forget the night I got back. I crossed the river an hour\r\nbefore sunset and hobbled my horse in the wide bottom of Cow Canyon. The\r\nmoon was up, though the sun hadn\'t set, and it had that glittering\r\nsilveriness the early stars have in high altitudes. The heavenly bodies\r\nlook so much more remote from the bottom of a deep canyon than they do\r\nfrom the level. The climb of the walls helps out the eye, somehow. I lay\r\ndown on a solitary rock that was like an island in the bottom of the\r\nvalley, and looked up. The grey sage-brush and the blue-grey rock around\r\nme were already in shadow, but high above me the canyon walls were dyed\r\nflame-colour with the sunset, and the Cliff City lay in a gold haze\r\nagainst its dark cavern. In a few minutes it, too, was grey, and only\r\nthe rim rock at the top held the red light. When that was gone, I could\r\nstill see the copper glow in the pi\xc3\xb1ons along the edge of the top\r\nledges. The arc of sky over the canyon was silvery blue, with its pale\r\nyellow moon, and presently stars shivered into it, like crystals dropped\r\ninto perfectly clear water.\r\n\r\nI remember these things, because, in a sense, that was the first night I\r\nwas ever really on the mesa at all--the first night that all of me was\r\nthere. This was the first time I ever saw it as a whole. It all came\r\ntogether in my understanding, as a series of experiments do when you\r\nbegin to see where they are leading. Something had happened in me that\r\nmade it possible for me to co-ordinate and simplify, and that process,\r\ngoing on in my mind, brought with it great happiness. It was possession.\r\nThe excitement of my first discovery was a very pale feeling compared to\r\nthis one. For me the mesa was no longer an adventure, but a religious\r\nemotion. I had read of filial piety in the Latin poets, and I knew that\r\nwas what I felt for this place. It had formerly been mixed up with other\r\nmotives; but now that they were gone, I had my happiness unalloyed.\r\n\r\nWhat that night began lasted all summer. I stayed on the mesa until\r\nNovember. It was the first time I\'d ever studied methodically, or\r\nintelligently. I got the better of the Spanish grammar and read the\r\ntwelve books of the _\xc3\x86neid._ I studied in the morning, and in the\r\nafternoon I worked at clearing away the mess the German had made in\r\npacking--tidying up the ruins to wait another hundred years, maybe, for\r\nthe right explorer. I can scarcely hope that life will give me another\r\nsummer like that one. It was my high tide. Every morning, when the sun\'s\r\nrays first hit the mesa top, while the rest of the world was in shadow,\r\nI wakened with the feeling that I had found everything, instead of\r\nhaving lost everything. Nothing tired me. Up there alone, a close\r\nneighbour to the sun, I seemed to get the solar energy in some direct\r\nway. And at night, when I watched it drop down behind the edge of the\r\nplain below me, I used to feel that I couldn\'t have borne another hour\r\nof that consuming light, that I was full to the brim, and needed dark\r\nand sleep.\r\n\r\nAll that summer, I never went up to the Eagle\'s Nest to get my\r\ndiary--indeed, it\'s probably there yet. I didn\'t feel the need of that\r\nrecord. It would have been going backward. I didn\'t want to go back and\r\nunravel things step by step. Perhaps I was afraid that I would lose the\r\nwhole in the parts. At any rate, I didn\'t go for my record.\r\n\r\nDuring those months I didn\'t worry much about poor Roddy. I told myself\r\nthe advertisements would surely get him--I knew his habit of reading\r\nnewspapers. There are times when one\'s vitality is too high to be\r\nclouded, too elastic to stay down. Hurrying from my cabin in the morning\r\nto the spot in the Cliff City where I studied under a cedar, I used to\r\nbe frightened at my own heartlessness. But the feel of the narrow\r\nmoccasin-worn trail in the flat rock made my feet glad, like a good\r\ntaste in the mouth, and I\'d forget all about Blake without knowing it. I\r\nfound I was reading too fast; so I began to commit long passages of\r\nVirgil to memory--if it hadn\'t been for that, I might have forgotten how\r\nto use my voice, or gone to talking to myself. When I look into the\r\n_\xc3\x86neid_ now, I can always see two pictures: the one on the page, and\r\nanother behind that: blue and purple rocks and yellow-green pi\xc3\xb1ons with\r\nflat tops, little clustered houses clinging together for protection, a\r\nrude tower rising in their midst, rising strong, with calmness and\r\ncourage--behind it a dark grotto, in its depths a crystal spring.\r\n\r\nHappiness is something one can\'t explain. You must take my word for it.\r\nTroubles enough came afterward, but there was that summer, high and\r\nblue, a life in itself.\r\n\r\nNext winter I went back to Pardee and stayed with the O\'Briens again,\r\nworking on the section and studying with Father Duchene and trying to\r\nget some word of Blake. Now that I was back on the railroad, I thought I\r\ncouldn\'t fail to find him. I went out to Winslow and to Williams, and I\r\nquestioned the railroad men. We advertised for him in every possible\r\nway, had all the Santa F\xc3\xa9 operatives and the police and the Catholic\r\nmissionaries on the watch for him, offered a thousand dollars reward for\r\nwhoever found him. But it came to nothing. Father Duchene and our\r\nfriends down there are still looking. But the older I grow, the more I\r\nunderstand what it was I did that night on the mesa. Anyone who requites\r\nfaith and friendship as I did, will have to pay for it. I\'m not very\r\nsanguine about good fortune for myself. I\'ll be called to account when I\r\nleast expect it.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, just a year after I quarrelled with Roddy, I landed here\r\nand walked into your garden, and the rest you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THREE\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the most important things in his life, St. Peter sometimes\r\nreflected, had been determined by chance. His education in France had\r\nbeen an accident. His married life had been happy largely through a\r\ncircumstance with which neither he nor his wife had anything to do. They\r\nhad been young people with good qualities, and very much in love, but\r\nthey could not have been happy if Lillian had not inherited a small\r\nincome from her father--only about sixteen hundred a year, but it had\r\nmade all the difference in the world. A few memorable interregnums\r\nbetween servants had let him know that Lillian couldn\'t pinch and be\r\nshabby and do housework, as the wives of some of his colleagues did.\r\nUnder such conditions she became another person, and a bitter one.\r\n\r\nTom Outland had been a stroke of chance he couldn\'t possibly have\r\nimagined; his strange coming, his strange story, his devotion, his early\r\ndeath and posthumous fame--it was all fantastic. Fantastic, too, that\r\nthis tramp boy should amass a fortune for someone whose name he had\r\nnever heard, for "an extravagant and wheeling stranger." The Professor\r\noften thought of that curiously bitter burst from the barytone in\r\nBrahms\' Requiem, attending the words, "_He heapeth up riches and cannot\r\ntell who shall scatter them!_" The vehemence of this passage had seemed\r\nto him uncalled for until he read it by the light of the history of his\r\nown family.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter thought he had fared well with fate. He wouldn\'t choose to\r\nlive his life over--he might not have such good luck again. He had had\r\ntwo romances: one of the heart, which had filled his life for many\r\nyears, and a second of the mind--of the imagination. Just when the\r\nmorning brightness of the world was wearing off for him, along came\r\nOutland and brought him a kind of second youth.\r\n\r\nThrough Outland\'s studies, long after they had ceased to be pupil and\r\nmaster, he had been able to experience afresh things that had grown dull\r\nwith use. The boy\'s mind had the superabundance of heat which is always\r\npresent where there is rich germination. To share his thoughts was to\r\nsee old perspectives transformed by new effects of light.\r\n\r\nIf the last four volumes of "The Spanish Adventurers" were more simple\r\nand inevitable than those that went before, it was largely because of\r\nOutland. When St. Peter first began his work, he realized that his great\r\ndrawback was the lack of early association, the fact that he had not\r\nspent his youth in the great dazzling South-west country which was the\r\nscene of his explorers\' adventures. By the time he had got as far as the\r\nthird volume, into his house walked a boy who had grown up there, a boy\r\nwith imagination, with the training and insight resulting from a very\r\ncurious experience; who had in his pocket the secrets which old trails\r\nand stones and water-courses tell only to adolescence.\r\n\r\nTwo years after Tom\'s graduation they took the copy of Fray Garces\'\r\nmanuscript that the Professor had made from the original in Spain, and\r\nwent down into the South-west together. By autumn they had been over\r\nevery mile of his trail on horseback. Tom could take a sentence from\r\nGarces\' diary and find the exact spot at which the missionary crossed\r\nthe Rio Colorado on a certain Sunday in 1775. Given one pueblo, he could\r\nalways find the route by which the priest had reached the next.\r\n\r\nIt was on that trip that they went to Tom\'s Blue Mesa, climbed the\r\nladder of spliced pine-trees to the Cliff City, and up to the Eagle\'s\r\nNest. There they took Tom\'s diary from the stone cupboard where he had\r\nsealed it up years ago, before he set out for Washington on his\r\nfruitless errand.\r\n\r\nThe next summer Tom went with the Professor to Old Mexico. They had\r\nplanned a third summer together, in Paris, but it never came off.\r\nOutland was delayed by the formalities of securing his patent, and then\r\ncame August, 1914. Father Duchene, the missionary priest who had been\r\nTom\'s teacher, stopped in Hamilton on his way back to Belgium, hurrying\r\nhome to serve in any capacity he might. The rugged old man stayed in\r\nHamilton only four days, but in that time Outland made up his mind, had\r\na will drawn, packed, and said good-bye. He sailed with Father Duchene\r\non the _Rochambeau._\r\n\r\nTo this day St. Peter regretted that he had never got that vacation in\r\nParis with Tom Outland. He had wanted to revisit certain spots with him:\r\nto go with him some autumn morning to the Luxembourg Gardens, when the\r\nyellow horse-chestnuts were bright and bitter after rain; to stand with\r\nhim before the monument to Delacroix and watch the sun gleam on the\r\nbronze figures--Time, bearing away the youth who was struggling to\r\nsnatch his palm--or was it to lay a palm? Not that it mattered. It might\r\nhave mattered to Tom, had not chance, in one great catastrophe, swept\r\naway all youth and all palms, and almost Time itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd suppose Tom had been more prudent, and had not gone away with his\r\nold teacher? St. Peter sometimes wondered what would have happened to\r\nhim, once the trap of worldly success had been sprung on him. He\r\ncouldn\'t see Tom building "Outland," or becoming a public-spirited\r\ncitizen of Hamilton. What change would have come in his blue eye, in his\r\nfine long hand with the back-springing thumb, which had never handled\r\nthings that were not the symbols of ideas? A hand like that, had he\r\nlived, must have been put to other uses. His fellow scientists, his\r\nwife, the town and State, would have required many duties of it. It\r\nwould have had to write thousands of useless letters, frame thousands of\r\nfalse excuses. It would have had to "manage" a great deal of money, to\r\nbe the instrument of a woman who would grow always more exacting. He had\r\nescaped all that. He had made something new in the world--and the\r\nrewards, the meaningless conventional gestures, he had left to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll those summer days, while the Professor was sending cheerful accounts\r\nof his activities to his family in France, he was really doing very\r\nlittle. He had begun, in a desultory way, to annotate the diary that Tom\r\nhad kept on the mesa, in which he had noted down the details of each\r\nday\'s work among the ruins, along with the weather and anything unusual\r\nin the routine of their life. There was a minute description of each\r\ntool they found, of every piece of cloth and pottery, frequently\r\naccompanied by a very suggestive pencil sketch of the object and a\r\nsurmise as to its use and the kind of life in which it had played a\r\npart. To St. Peter this plain account was almost beautiful, because of\r\nthe stupidities it avoided and the things it did not say. If words had\r\ncost money, Tom couldn\'t have used them more sparingly. The adjectives\r\nwere purely descriptive, relating to form and colour, and were used to\r\npresent the objects under consideration, not the young explorer\'s\r\nemotions. Yet through this austerity one felt the kindling imagination,\r\nthe ardour and excitement of the boy, like the vibration in a voice when\r\nthe speaker strives to conceal his emotion by using only conventional\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nWhen the first of August came round, the Professor realized that he had\r\npleasantly trifled away nearly two months at a task which should have\r\ntaken little more than a week. But he had been doing a good deal\r\nbesides--something he had never before been able to do.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter had always laughed at people who talked about "day-dreams,"\r\njust as he laughed at people who naively confessed that they had "an\r\nimagination." All his life his mind had behaved in a positive fashion.\r\nWhen he was not at work, or being actively amused, he went to sleep. He\r\nhad no twilight stage. But new he enjoyed this half-awake loafing with\r\nhis brain as if it were a new sense, arriving late, like wisdom teeth.\r\nHe found he could lie on his sand-spit by the lake for hours and watch\r\nthe seven motionless pines drink up the sun. In the evening, after\r\ndinner, he could sit idle and watch the stars, with the same immobility.\r\nHe was cultivating a novel mental dissipation--and enjoying a new\r\nfriendship. Tom Outland had not come back again through the garden door\r\n(as he had so often done in dreams!), but another boy had: the boy the\r\nProfessor had long ago left behind him in Kansas, in the Solomon\r\nValley--the original, unmodified Godfrey St. Peter.\r\n\r\nThis boy and he had meant, back in those faraway days, to live some sort\r\nof life together and to share good and bad fortune. They had not shared\r\ntogether, for the reason that they were unevenly matched. The young St.\r\nPeter who went to France to try his luck, had a more active mind than\r\nthe twin he left behind in the Solomon Valley. After his adoption into\r\nthe Thierault household, he remembered that other boy very rarely, in\r\nmoments of home-sickness. After he met Lillian Ornsley, St. Peter forgot\r\nthat boy had ever lived.\r\n\r\nBut now that the vivid consciousness of an earlier state had come back\r\nto him, the Professor felt that life with this Kansas boy, little as\r\nthere had been of it, was the realest of his lives, and that all the\r\nyears between had been accidental and ordered from the outside. His\r\ncareer, his wife, his family, were not his life at all, but a chain of\r\nevents which had happened to him. All these things had nothing to do\r\nwith the person he was in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe man he was now, the personality his friends knew, had begun to grow\r\nstrong during adolescence, during the years when he was always\r\nconsciously or unconsciously conjugating the verb "to love"--in society\r\nand solitude, with people, with books, with the sky and open country, in\r\nthe lonesomeness of crowded city streets. When he met Lillian, it\r\nreached its maturity. From that time to this, existence had been a\r\ncatching at handholds. One thing led to another and one development\r\nbrought on another, and the design of his life had been the work of this\r\nsecondary social man, the lover. It had been shaped by all the penalties\r\nand responsibilities of being and having been a lover. Because there was\r\nLillian, there must be marriage and a salary. Because there was\r\nmarriage, there were children. Because there were children, and fervour\r\nin the blood and brain, books were born as well as daughters. His\r\nhistories, he was convinced, had no more to do with his original ego\r\nthan his daughters had; they were a result of the high pressure of young\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas boy who had come back to St. Peter this summer was not a\r\nscholar. He was a primitive. He was only interested in earth and woods\r\nand water. Wherever sun sunned and rain rained and snow snowed, wherever\r\nlife sprouted and decayed, places were alike to him. He was not nearly\r\nso cultivated as Tom\'s old cliff-dwellers must have been--and yet he was\r\nterribly wise. He seemed to be at the root of the matter; Desire under\r\nall desires, Truth under all truths. He seemed to know, among other\r\nthings, that he was solitary and must always be so; he had never\r\nmarried, never been a father. He was earth, and would return to earth.\r\nWhen white clouds blew over the lake like bellying sails, when the seven\r\npine-trees turned red in the declining sun, he felt satisfaction and\r\nsaid to himself merely: "That is right." Coming upon a curly root that\r\nthrust itself across his path, he said: "That is it." When the\r\nmaple-leaves along the street began to turn yellow and waxy, and were\r\nsoft to the touch,--like the skin on old faces,--he said: "That is true;\r\nit is time." All these recognitions gave him a kind of sad pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen he was not dumbly, deeply recognizing, he was bringing up out of\r\nhimself long-forgotten, unimportant memories of his early childhood, of\r\nhis mother, his father, his grandfather. His grandfather, old Napoleon\r\nGodfrey, used to go about lost in profound, continuous meditation,\r\nsometimes chuckling to himself. Occasionally, at the family\r\ndinner-table, the old man would try to rouse himself, from motives of\r\npoliteness, and would ask some kindly question--nearly always absurd and\r\noften the same one he had asked yesterday. The boys used to shout with\r\nlaughter and wonder what profound matters could require such deep\r\nmeditation, and make a man speak so foolishly about what was going on\r\nunder his very eyes. St. Peter thought he was beginning to understand\r\nwhat the old man had been thinking about, though he himself was but\r\nfifty-two, and Napoleon had been well on in his eighties. There are only\r\na few years, at the last, in which man can consider his estate, and he\r\nthought he might be quite as near the end of his road as his grandfather\r\nhad been in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Professor knew, of course, that adolescence grafted a new creature\r\ninto the original one, and that the complexion of a man\'s life was\r\nlargely determined by how well or ill his original self and his nature\r\nas modified by sex rubbed on together.\r\n\r\nWhat he had not known was that, at a given time, that first nature could\r\nreturn to a man, unchanged by all the pursuits and passions and\r\nexperiences of his life; untouched even by the tastes and intellectual\r\nactivities which have been strong enough to give him distinction among\r\nhis fellows and to have made for him, as they say, a name in the world.\r\nPerhaps this reversion did not often occur, but he knew it had happened\r\nto him, and he suspected it had happened to his grandfather. He did not\r\nregret his life, but he was indifferent to it. It seemed to him like the\r\nlife of another person.\r\n\r\nAlong with other states of mind which attended his realization of the\r\nboy Godfrey, came a conviction (he did not see it coming, it was there\r\nbefore he was aware of its approach) that he was nearing the end of his\r\nlife. This conviction took its place so quietly, seemed so\r\nmatter-of-fact, that he gave it little thought. But one day, when he\r\nrealized that all the while he was preparing for the fall term he didn\'t\r\nin the least believe he would be alive during the fall term, he thought\r\nhe might better see a doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family doctor knew all about St. Peter. It was summer, moreover, and\r\nhe had plenty of time. He devoted several mornings to the Professor and\r\nmade tests of the most searching kind. In the end he of course told St.\r\nPeter there was nothing the matter with him.\r\n\r\n"What made you come to me, any discomfort or pain?"\r\n\r\n"None. I simply feel tired all the time."\r\n\r\nDr. Dudley shrugged. "So do I! Sleep well?"\r\n\r\n"Almost too much."\r\n\r\n"Eat well?"\r\n\r\n"In every sense of the word, well. I am my own chef."\r\n\r\n"Always a _gourmet_, and never anything wrong with your digestive tract!\r\nI wish you\'d ask me to dine with you some night. Any of that sherry\r\nleft?"\r\n\r\n"A little. I use it plentifully."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you do! But why did you think there was something wrong with\r\nyou? Low in your mind?"\r\n\r\n"No, merely low in energy. Enjoy doing nothing. I came to you from a\r\nsense of duty."\r\n\r\n"How about travel?"\r\n\r\n"I shrink from the thought of it. As I tell you, I enjoy doing nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then do it! There\'s nothing the matter with you. Follow your\r\ninclination."\r\n\r\nSt. Peter went home well satisfied. He did not mention to Dr. Dudley the\r\nreal reason for his asking for a medical examination. One doesn\'t\r\nmention such things. The feeling that he was near the conclusion of his\r\nlife was an instinctive conviction, such as we have when we waken in the\r\ndark and know at once that it is near morning; or when we are walking\r\nacross the country and suddenly know that we are near the sea.\r\n\r\nLetters came every week from France. Lillian and Louie alternated, so\r\nthat one or the other got off a letter to him on every fast boat. Louie\r\ntold him that wherever they went, when they had an especially delightful\r\nday, they bought him a present. At Trouville, for instance, they had\r\nlaid in dozens of the brilliant rubber casquettes he liked to wear when\r\nhe went swimming. At Aix-les-Bains they found a gorgeous dressing-gown\r\nfor him in a Chinese shop. St. Peter was happy in his mind about them\r\nall. He was glad they were there, and that he was here. Their generous\r\nletters, written when there were so many pleasant things to do,\r\ncertainly deserved more than one reading. He used to carry them out to\r\nthe lake to read them over again. After coming out of the water he would\r\nlie on the sand, holding them in his hand, but somehow never taking his\r\neyes off the pine-trees, appliqu\xc3\xa9d against the blue water, and their\r\nripe yellow cones, dripping with gum and clustering on the pointed tips\r\nlike a mass of golden bees in swarming-time. Usually he carried his\r\nletters home unread.\r\n\r\nHis family wrote constantly about their plans for next summer, when they\r\nwere going to take him over with them. Next summer? The Professor\r\nwondered. . . . Sometimes he thought he would like to drive up in front\r\nof Notre Dame, in Paris, again, and see it standing there like the Rock\r\nof Ages, with the frail generations breaking about its base. He hadn\'t\r\nseen it since the war.\r\n\r\nBut if he went anywhere next summer, he thought it would be down into\r\nOutland\'s country, to watch the sunrise break on sculptured peaks and\r\nimpassable mountain passes--to look off at those long, rugged, untamed\r\nvistas dear to the American heart. Dear to all hearts, probably--at\r\nleast, calling to all. Else why had his grandfather\'s grandfather, who\r\nhad tramped so many miles across Europe into Russia with the Grande\r\nArm\xc3\xa9e, come out to the Canadian wilderness to forget the chagrin of his\r\nEmperor\'s defeat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall term of the university opened, and now the Professor went to\r\nhis lectures instead of to the lake. He supposed he did his work; he\r\nheard no complaints from his assistants, and the students seemed\r\ninterested. He found, however, that he wasn\'t willing to take the\r\ntrouble to learn the names of several hundred new students. It wasn\'t\r\nworth while. He felt that his relations with them would be of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nThe McGregors got home from their vacation in Oregon, and Scott was much\r\namused to find the Professor so doggedly anchored in the old house.\r\n\r\n"It never struck me, Doctor, that you were a man who would be keeping up\r\ntwo establishments. They\'ll be coming home pretty soon, and then you\'ll\r\nhave to decide where you are going to live."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t leave my study, Scott. That\'s flat."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, then! Darn it, you\'ve a right to two houses if you want \'em."\r\n\r\nThis encounter took place on the street in front of the house. The\r\nProfessor went wearily upstairs and lay down on the couch, his refuge\r\nfrom this ever-increasing fatigue. He really didn\'t see what he was\r\ngoing to do about the matter of domicile. He couldn\'t make himself\r\nbelieve that he was ever going to live in the new house again. He didn\'t\r\nbelong there. He remembered some lines of a translation from the Norse\r\nhe used to read long ago in one of his mother\'s few books, a little\r\ntwo-volume Ticknor and Fields edition of Longfellow, in blue and gold,\r\nthat used to lie on the parlour table:\r\n\r\n\r\nFor thee a house was built\r\nEre thou wast born;\r\nFor thee a mould was made\r\nEre thou of woman earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLying on his old couch, he could almost believe himself in that house\r\nalready. The sagging springs were like the sham upholstery that is put\r\nin coffins. Just the equivocal American way of dealing with serious\r\nfacts, he reflected. Why pretend that it is possible to soften that last\r\nhard bed?\r\n\r\nHe could remember a time when the loneliness of death had terrified him,\r\nwhen the idea of it was insupportable. He used to feel that if his wife\r\ncould but lie in the same coffin with him, his body would not be so\r\ninsensible that the nearness of hers would not give it comfort. But now\r\nhe thought of eternal solitude with gratefulness; as a release from\r\nevery obligation, from every form of effort. It was the Truth.\r\n\r\nOne morning, just as St. Peter was leaving the house to go to his\r\nclass-room, the postman handed him two letters, one addressed in\r\nLillian\'s hand and one in Louie\'s. He put them into his pocket. The feel\r\nof them disturbed him. They were of a suspicious thinness--as if they\r\ndidn\'t contain amusing gossip, but announced sudden decisions. He set\r\noff down the street, sniffing the lake-cooled morning air and trying to\r\novercome a feeling of nervous dread.\r\n\r\nAll the morning those two letters lay in his breast pocket. Though they\r\nwere so light, their effect was to make him drop his shoulders and look\r\nwoefully tired. The weather, too, had changed, come on suddenly hot and\r\nsultry at noon, as if get ting ready for a storm. When his classes were\r\nover and he was back in his study again, St. Peter felt no interest in\r\nlunch. He took out the two letters and ripped them open with his\r\nforefinger to have it over. Yes, all plans were changed, and by the\r\nhappiest of expectations. The family were hurrying home to prepare for\r\nthe advent of a young Marsellus. They would sail on the sixteenth, on\r\nthe _Berengaria_.\r\n\r\nLillian added a postscript to the effect that by this same mail she was\r\ngetting off a letter to Augusta, who would come to him for the keys of\r\nthe new house. She would be the best person to open the house and\r\narrange to have the cleaning done. She would take it entirely off his\r\nshoulders and see that everything was properly put in order.\r\n\r\nThey were sailing on the sixteenth, and this was the seventeenth; they\r\nwere already on the water. The _Berengaria_ was a five-day boat. St.\r\nPeter caught up his hat and light overcoat and started down the stairs.\r\nHalf-way down, he stopped short, went back to his study, and softly shut\r\nthe door behind him. He sat down, forgetting to take off his overcoat,\r\nthough the afternoon was so hot and his face was damp with perspiration.\r\nHe sat motionless, breathing unevenly, one dark hand lying clenched on\r\nhis writing-table. There must, he was repeating to himself, there must\r\nbe some way in which a man who had always tried to live up to his\r\nresponsibilities could, when the hour of desperation came, avoid meeting\r\nhis own family.\r\n\r\nHe loved his family, he would make any sacrifice for them, but just now\r\nhe couldn\'t live with them. He must be alone. That was more necessary to\r\nhim than anything had ever been, more necessary, even, than his marriage\r\nhad been in his vehement youth. He could not live with his family\r\nagain--not even with Lillian. Especially not with Lillian! Her nature\r\nwas intense and positive; it was like a chiselled surface, a die, a\r\nstamp upon which he could not be beaten out any longer. If her character\r\nwere reduced to an heraldic device, it would be a hand (a beautiful\r\nhand) holding flaming arrows--the shafts of her violent loves and hates,\r\nher clear-cut ambitions.\r\n\r\n"In great misfortunes," he told himself, "people want to be alone. They\r\nhave a right to be. And the misfortunes that occur within one are the\r\ngreatest. Surely the saddest thing in the world is falling out of\r\nlove--if once one has ever fallen in."\r\n\r\nFalling out, for him, seemed to mean falling out of all domestic and\r\nsocial relations, out of his place in the human family, indeed.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter did not go out of the house that afternoon. He did not leave\r\nhis study. He sat at his desk with bent head, reviewing his life, trying\r\nto see where he had made his mistake, to account for the fact that he\r\nnow wanted to run away from everything he had intensely cared for.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the heaviness of the air in the room drove him to\r\nthe window. He saw that a storm was coming on. Great orange and purple\r\nclouds were blowing up from the lake, and the pine-trees over about the\r\nPhysics laboratory were blacker than cypresses and looked contracted, as\r\nif they were awaiting something. The rain broke, and it turned cold.\r\n\r\nThe rain-storm was over in half an hour, but a heavy blow had set in for\r\nthe night. The wind would be a protection, he thought. Even Augusta\r\nwould hardly come plodding up the stairs to-night It seemed strange to\r\nbe dreading Augusta, but just now he did dread her. He believed he was\r\nsafe, for to-night. Though it was only five o\'clock, the sky was black,\r\nand the room was dusky and chilly. He lit the stove and lay down on the\r\ncouch. The fire made a flickering pattern of light on the wall. He lay\r\nwatching it, vacantly; without meaning to, he fell asleep. For a long\r\nwhile he slept deeply and peacefully. Then the wind, increasing in\r\nviolence, disturbed him. He began to be aware of noises--things banging\r\nand slamming about. He turned over on his back and slept deeper still.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen St. Peter at last awoke, the room was pitch-black and full of gas.\r\nHe was cold and numb, felt sick and rather dazed. The long-anticipated\r\ncoincidence had happened, he realized. The storm had blown the stove out\r\nand the window shut. The thing to do was to get up and open the window.\r\nBut suppose he did not get up----? How far was a man required to exert\r\nhimself against accident? How would such a case be decided under English\r\nlaw? He hadn\'t lifted his hand against himself--was he required to lift\r\nit for himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt midnight St. Peter was lying in his study, on his box-couch, covered\r\nup with blankets, a hot water bottle at his feet; he knew it was\r\nmidnight, for the clock of Augusta\'s church across the park was ringing\r\nthe hour. Augusta herself was there in the room, sitting in her old\r\nsewing-chair by the kerosene lamp, wrapped up in a shawl. She was\r\nreading a little much-worn religious book that she always carried in her\r\nhandbag. Presently he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n"Just when did you come in, Augusta?"\r\n\r\nShe got up and came over to him.\r\n\r\n"Are you feeling comfortable, Doctor St. Peter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very, thank you. When did you happen in?"\r\n\r\n"Not any too soon, sir," she said gravely, with a touch of reproof. "You\r\nnever would take my cautions about that old stove, and it very nearly\r\nasphyxiated you. I was barely in time to pull you out."\r\n\r\n"You pulled me out, literally? Where to?"\r\n\r\n"Into the hall. I came over in the storm to ask you for the keys of the\r\nnew house--I didn\'t get Mrs. St. Peter\'s letter until I got home from\r\nwork this evening, and I came right over. When I opened the front door I\r\nsmelled gas, and I knew that stove had been up to its old tricks. I\r\nsupposed you\'d gone out and forgot to turn it off. When I got to the\r\nsecond floor I heard a fall overhead, and it flashed across me that you\r\nwere up here and had been overcome. I ran up and opened the two windows\r\nat the head of the stairs and dragged you out into the wind. You were\r\nlying on the floor." She lowered her voice. "It was perfectly frightful\r\nin here."\r\n\r\n"I seem to remember Dudley\'s being here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, after I\'d turned off the stove and opened everything up, I went\r\nnext door and telephoned for Doctor Dudley. I thought I\'d better not say\r\nwhat the trouble was, but I asked him to come at once, as you\'d been\r\ntaken ill. You soon came round, but you were flighty." Augusta hurried\r\nover her recital. She was evidently embarrassed by the behaviour of the\r\nstove and the condition in which she had found him. It was an ugly\r\naccident, and she didn\'t want the neighbours to know of it.\r\n\r\n"You must have great presence of mind, Augusta, and a strong arm as\r\nwell. You say you found me on the floor? I thought I was lying here on\r\nthe couch. I remember waking up and smelling gas."\r\n\r\n"You were stupefied, but you must have got up and tried to get to the\r\ndoor before you were overcome. I was on the second floor when I heard\r\nyou fall. I\'d never heard anyone fall before, that I can remember, but I\r\nseemed to know just what it was."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to have given you a fright. I hope the gas hasn\'t made your\r\nhead ache."\r\n\r\n"All\'s well that ends well, as they say. But I doubt if you ought to be\r\ntalking, sir. Could you go to sleep again? I can stay till morning, if\r\nyou prefer."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be greatly obliged if you would stay the night with me, Augusta. It\r\nwould be a comfort. I seem to feel rather lonely--for the first time in\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because your family are coming home. Very well, sir."\r\n\r\n"You do a good deal of this sort of thing--watching and sitting up with\r\npeople, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, when I happen to be sewing in a house where there\'s sickness, I\r\nam sometimes called upon."\r\n\r\nAugusta sat down by the table and again took up her little religious\r\nbook. St. Peter, with half-closed eyes, lay watching her--regarding in\r\nher humankind, as if after a definite absence from the world of men and\r\nwomen. If he had thought of Augusta sooner, he would have got up from\r\nthe couch sooner. Her image would have at once suggested the proper\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAugusta, he reflected, had always been a corrective, a remedial\r\ninfluence. When she sewed for them, she breakfasted at the house--that\r\nwas part of the arrangement. She came early, often directly from church,\r\nand had her breakfast with the Professor, before the rest of the family\r\nwere up. Very often she gave him some wise observation or discreet\r\ncomment to begin the day with. She wasn\'t at all afraid to say things\r\nthat were heavily, drearily true, and though he used to wince under\r\nthem, he hurried off with the feeling that they were good for him, that\r\nhe didn\'t have to hear such sayings half often enough. Augusta was like\r\nthe taste of bitter herbs; she was the bloomless side of life that he\r\nhad always run away from,--yet when he had to face it, he found that it\r\nwasn\'t altogether repugnant. Sometimes she used to telephone Mrs. St.\r\nPeter that she would be a day late, because there had been a death in\r\nthe family where she was sewing just then, and she was "needed." When\r\nshe met him at the table the next morning, she would look just a little\r\nmore grave than usual. While she ate a generous breakfast, she would\r\nreply to his polite questions about the illness or funeral with\r\nbefitting solemnity, and then go readily to another topic, not holding\r\nthe dolorous note. He used to say that he didn\'t mind hearing Augusta\r\nannounce these deaths which seemed to happen so frequently along her\r\nway, because her manner of speaking about it made death seem less\r\nuncomfortable. She hadn\'t any of the sentimentality that comes from a\r\nfear of dying. She talked about death as she spoke of a hard winter or a\r\nrainy March, or any of the sadnesses of nature.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to St. Peter, as he lay warm and relaxed but undesirous of\r\nsleep, that he would rather have Augusta with him just now than anyone\r\nhe could think of. Seasoned and sound and on the solid earth she surely\r\nwas, and, for all her matter-of-factness and hard-handedness, kind and\r\nloyal. He even felt a sense of obligation toward her, instinctive,\r\nescaping definition, but real. And when you admitted that a thing was\r\nreal, that was enough--now.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t, on being quite honest with himself, feel any obligations\r\ntoward his family. Lillian had had the best years of his life, nearly\r\nthirty, and joyful years they had been, nothing could ever change that.\r\nBut they were gone. His daughters had outgrown any great need of him. In\r\ncertain wayward moods Kitty would always come to him. But Rosamond, on\r\nthat shopping expedition in Chicago, had shown him how painful the\r\npaternal relation could be. There was still Augusta, however; a world\r\nfull of Augustas, with whom one was outward bound.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon he had sat there at the table where now Augusta was\r\nreading, thinking over his life, trying to see where he had made his\r\nmistake. Perhaps the mistake was merely in an attitude of mind. He had\r\nnever learned to live without delight. And he would have to learn to,\r\njust as, in a Prohibition country, he supposed he would have to learn to\r\nlive without sherry. Theoretically he knew that life is possible, may be\r\neven pleasant, without joy, without passionate griefs. But it had never\r\noccurred to him that he might have to live like that.\r\n\r\nThough he had been low-spirited all summer, he told the truth when he\r\ntold Dr. Dudley that he had not been melancholy. He had no more thought\r\nof suicide than he had thought of embezzling. He had always regarded it\r\nas a grave social misdemeanour--except when it occurred in very evil\r\ntimes, as a form of protest. Yet when he was confronted by accidental\r\nextinction, he had felt no will to resist, but had let chance take its\r\nway, as it had done with him so often. He did not remember springing up\r\nfrom the couch, though he did remember a crisis, a moment of acute,\r\nagonized strangulation.\r\n\r\nHis temporary release from consciousness seemed to have been beneficial.\r\nHe had let something go--and it was gone: something very precious, that\r\nhe could not consciously have relinquished, probably. He doubted whether\r\nhis family would ever realize that he was not the same man they had said\r\ngood-bye to; they would be too happily preoccupied with their own\r\naffairs. If his apathy hurt them, they could not possibly be so much\r\nhurt as he had been already. At least, he felt the ground under his\r\nfeet. He thought he knew where he was, and that he could face with\r\nfortitude the _Berengaria_ and the future.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROFESSOR\'S HOUSE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
