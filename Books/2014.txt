A casual stranger, more\r\nparticularly one of a Superior class to their own, on suddenly opening\r\nthe door of that sitting-room; would have thought that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBunting presented a very pleasant cosy picture of comfortable married\r\nlife. Bunting, who was leaning back in a deep leather arm-chair, was\r\nclean-shaven and dapper, still in appearance what he had been for many\r\nyears of his life\xe2\x80\x94a self-respecting man-servant.\r\n\r\nOn his wife, now sitting up in an uncomfortable straight-backed chair,\r\nthe marks of past servitude were less apparent; but they were there all\r\nthe same\xe2\x80\x94in her neat black stuff dress, and in her scrupulously clean,\r\nplain collar and cuffs. Mrs. Bunting, as a single woman, had been what\r\nis known as a useful maid.\r\n\r\nBut peculiarly true of average English life is the time-worn English\r\nproverb as to appearances being deceitful. Mr. and Mrs. Bunting were\r\nsitting in a very nice room and in their time\xe2\x80\x94how long ago it now\r\nseemed!\xe2\x80\x94both husband and wife had been proud of their carefully chosen\r\nbelongings. Everything in the room was strong and substantial, and each\r\narticle of furniture had been bought at a well-conducted auction held\r\nin a private house.\r\n\r\nThus the red damask curtains which now shut out the fog-laden,\r\ndrizzling atmosphere of the Marylebone Road, had cost a mere song, and\r\nyet they might have been warranted to last another thirty years. A\r\ngreat bargain also had been the excellent Axminster carpet which\r\ncovered the floor; as, again, the arm-chair in which Bunting now sat\r\nforward, staring into the dull, small fire. In fact, that arm-chair had\r\nbeen an extravagance of Mrs. Bunting. She had wanted her husband to be\r\ncomfortable after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done, and she had paid\r\nthirty-seven shillings for the chair. Only yesterday Bunting had tried\r\nto find a purchaser for it, but the man who had come to look at it,\r\nguessing their cruel necessities, had only offered them twelve\r\nshillings and sixpence for it; so for the present they were keeping\r\ntheir arm-chair.\r\n\r\nBut man and woman want something more than mere material comfort, much\r\nas that is valued by the Buntings of this world. So, on the walls of\r\nthe sitting-room, hung neatly framed if now rather faded\r\nphotographs\xe2\x80\x94photographs of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s various former\r\nemployers, and of the pretty country houses in which they had\r\nseparately lived during the long years they had spent in a not unhappy\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nBut appearances were not only deceitful, they were more than usually\r\ndeceitful with regard to these unfortunate people. In spite of their\r\ngood furniture\xe2\x80\x94that substantial outward sign of respectability which is\r\nthe last thing which wise folk who fall into trouble try to dispose\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94they were almost at the end of their tether. Already they had learnt\r\nto go hungry, and they were beginning to learn to go cold. Tobacco, the\r\nlast thing the sober man foregoes among his comforts, had been given up\r\nsome time ago by Bunting. And even Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94prim, prudent, careful\r\nwoman as she was in her way\xe2\x80\x94had realised what this must mean to him. So\r\nwell, indeed, had she understood that some days back she had crept out\r\nand bought him a packet of Virginia.\r\n\r\nBunting had been touched\xe2\x80\x94touched as he had not been for years by any\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s thought and love for him. Painful tears had forced themselves\r\ninto his eyes, and husband and wife had both felt in their odd,\r\nunemotional way, moved to the heart.\r\n\r\nFortunately he never guessed\xe2\x80\x94how could he have guessed, with his slow,\r\nnormal, rather dull mind?\xe2\x80\x94that his poor Ellen had since more than once\r\nbitterly regretted that fourpence-ha\xe2\x80\x99penny, for they were now very near\r\nthe soundless depths which divide those who dwell on the safe tableland\r\nof security\xe2\x80\x94those, that is, who are sure of making a respectable, if\r\nnot a happy, living\xe2\x80\x94and the submerged multitude who, through some lack\r\nin themselves, or owing to the conditions under which our strange\r\ncivilisation has become organised, struggle rudderless till they die in\r\nworkhouse, hospital, or prison.\r\n\r\nHad the Buntings been in a class lower than their own, had they\r\nbelonged to the great company of human beings technically known to so\r\nmany of us as the poor, there would have been friendly neighbours ready\r\nto help them, and the same would have been the case had they belonged\r\nto the class of smug, well-meaning, if unimaginative, folk whom they\r\nhad spent so much of their lives in serving.\r\n\r\nThere was only one person in the world who might possibly be brought to\r\nhelp them. That was an aunt of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s first wife. With this woman,\r\nthe widow of a man who had been well-to-do, lived Daisy, Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nchild by his first wife, and during the last long two days he had been\r\ntrying to make up his mind to write to the old lady, and that though he\r\nsuspected that she would almost certainly retort with a cruel, sharp\r\nrebuff.\r\n\r\nAs to their few acquaintances, former fellow-servants, and so on, they\r\nhad gradually fallen out of touch with them. There was but one friend\r\nwho often came to see them in their deep trouble. This was a young\r\nfellow named Chandler, under whose grandfather Bunting had been footman\r\nyears and years ago. Joe Chandler had never gone into service; he was\r\nattached to the police; in fact not to put too fine a point upon it,\r\nyoung Chandler was a detective.\r\n\r\nWhen they had first taken the house which had brought them, so they\r\nboth thought, such bad luck, Bunting had encouraged the young chap to\r\ncome often, for his tales were well worth listening to\xe2\x80\x94quite exciting\r\nat times. But now poor Bunting didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear that sort of\r\nstories\xe2\x80\x94stories of people being cleverly \xe2\x80\x9cnabbed,\xe2\x80\x9d or stupidly allowed\r\nto escape the fate they always, from Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, richly\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nBut Joe still came very faithfully once or twice a week, so timing his\r\ncalls that neither host nor hostess need press food upon him\xe2\x80\x94nay, more,\r\nhe had done that which showed him to have a good and feeling heart. He\r\nhad offered his father\xe2\x80\x99s old acquaintance a loan, and Bunting, at last,\r\nhad taken 30s. Very little of that money now remained: Bunting still\r\ncould jingle a few coppers in his pocket; and Mrs. Bunting had 2s. 9d.;\r\nthat and the rent they would have to pay in five weeks, was all they\r\nhad left. Everything of the light, portable sort that would fetch money\r\nhad been sold. Mrs. Bunting had a fierce horror of the pawnshop. She\r\nhad never put her feet in such a place, and she declared she never\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94she would rather starve first.\r\n\r\nBut she had said nothing when there had occurred the gradual\r\ndisappearance of various little possessions she knew that Bunting\r\nvalued, notably of the old-fashioned gold watch-chain which had been\r\ngiven to him after the death of his first master, a master he had\r\nnursed faithfully and kindly through a long and terrible illness. There\r\nhad also vanished a twisted gold tie-pin, and a large mourning ring,\r\nboth gifts of former employers.\r\n\r\nWhen people are living near that deep pit which divides the secure from\r\nthe insecure\xe2\x80\x94when they see themselves creeping closer and closer to its\r\ndread edge\xe2\x80\x94they are apt, however loquacious by nature, to fall into\r\nlong silences. Bunting had always been a talker, but now he talked no\r\nmore. Neither did Mrs. Bunting, but then she had always been a silent\r\nwoman, and that was perhaps one reason why Bunting had felt drawn to\r\nher from the very first moment he had seen her.\r\n\r\nIt had fallen out in this way. A lady had just engaged him as butler,\r\nand he had been shown, by the man whose place he was to take, into the\r\ndining-room. There, to use his own expression, he had discovered Ellen\r\nGreen, carefully pouring out the glass of port wine which her then\r\nmistress always drank at 11.30 every morning. And as he, the new\r\nbutler, had seen her engaged in this task, as he had watched her\r\ncarefully stopper the decanter and put it back into the old\r\nwine-cooler, he had said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the woman for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now her stillness, her\xe2\x80\x94her dumbness, had got on the unfortunate\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. He no longer felt like going into the various little\r\nshops, close by, patronised by him in more prosperous days, and Mrs.\r\nBunting also went afield to make the slender purchases which still had\r\nto be made every day or two, if they were to be saved from actually\r\nstarving to death.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, across the stillness of the dark November evening there came\r\nthe muffled sounds of hurrying feet and of loud, shrill shouting\r\noutside\xe2\x80\x94boys crying the late afternoon editions of the evening papers.\r\n\r\nBunting turned uneasily in his chair. The giving up of a daily paper\r\nhad been, after his tobacco, his bitterest deprivation. And the paper\r\nwas an older habit than the tobacco, for servants are great readers of\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nAs the shouts came through the closed windows and the thick damask\r\ncurtains, Bunting felt a sudden sense of mind hunger fall upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was a shame\xe2\x80\x94a damned shame\xe2\x80\x94that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was happening\r\nin the world outside! Only criminals are kept from hearing news of what\r\nis going on beyond their prison walls. And those shouts, those hoarse,\r\nsharp cries must portend that something really exciting had happened,\r\nsomething warranted to make a man forget for the moment his own\r\nintimate, gnawing troubles.\r\n\r\nHe got up, and going towards the nearest window strained his ears to\r\nlisten. There fell on them, emerging now and again from the confused\r\nbabel of hoarse shouts, the one clear word \xe2\x80\x9cMurder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s brain pieced the loud, indistinct cries into some sort\r\nof connected order. Yes, that was it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible Murder! Murder at St.\r\nPancras!\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting remembered vaguely another murder which had been\r\ncommitted near St. Pancras\xe2\x80\x94that of an old lady by her servant-maid. It\r\nhad happened a great many years ago, but was still vividly remembered,\r\nas of special and natural interest, among the class to which he had\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nThe newsboys\xe2\x80\x94for there were more than one of them, a rather unusual\r\nthing in the Marylebone Road\xe2\x80\x94were coming nearer and nearer; now they\r\nhad adopted another cry, but he could not quite catch what they were\r\ncrying. They were still shouting hoarsely, excitedly, but he could only\r\nhear a word or two now and then. Suddenly \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger! The Avenger at\r\nhis work again!\xe2\x80\x9d broke on his ear.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fortnight four very curious and brutal murders had been\r\ncommitted in London and within a comparatively small area.\r\n\r\nThe first had aroused no special interest\xe2\x80\x94even the second had only been\r\nawarded, in the paper Bunting was still then taking in, quite a small\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nThen had come the third\xe2\x80\x94and with that a wave of keen excitement, for\r\npinned to the dress of the victim\xe2\x80\x94a drunken woman\xe2\x80\x94had been found a\r\nthree-cornered piece of paper, on which was written, in red ink, and in\r\nprinted characters, the words,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE AVENGER\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was then realised, not only by those whose business it is to\r\ninvestigate such terrible happenings, but also by the vast world of men\r\nand women who take an intelligent interest in such sinister mysteries,\r\nthat the same miscreant had committed all three crimes; and before that\r\nextraordinary fact had had time to soak well into the public mind there\r\ntook place yet another murder, and again the murderer had been to\r\nspecial pains to make it clear that some obscure and terrible lust for\r\nvengeance possessed him.\r\n\r\nNow everyone was talking of The Avenger and his crimes! Even the man\r\nwho left their ha\xe2\x80\x99porth of milk at the door each morning had spoken to\r\nBunting about them that very day.\r\n\r\nBunting came back to the fire and looked down at his wife with mild\r\nexcitement. Then, seeing her pale, apathetic face, her look of weary,\r\nmournful absorption, a wave of irritation swept through him. He felt he\r\ncould have shaken her!\r\n\r\nEllen had hardly taken the trouble to listen when he, Bunting, had come\r\nback to bed that morning, and told her what the milkman had said. In\r\nfact, she had been quite nasty about it, intimating that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike hearing about such horrid things.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious fact that though Mrs. Bunting enjoyed tales of pathos\r\nand sentiment, and would listen with frigid amusement to the details of\r\na breach of promise action, she shrank from stories of immorality or of\r\nphysical violence. In the old, happy days, when they could afford to\r\nbuy a paper, aye, and more than one paper daily, Bunting had often had\r\nto choke down his interest in some exciting \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmystery\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nwas affording him pleasant mental relaxation, because any allusion to\r\nit sharply angered Ellen.\r\n\r\nBut now he was at once too dull and too miserable to care how she felt.\r\n\r\nWalking away from the window he took a slow, uncertain step towards the\r\ndoor; when there he turned half round, and there came over his\r\nclose-shaven, round face the rather sly, pleading look with which a\r\nchild about to do something naughty glances at its parent.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting remained quite still; her thin, narrow shoulders just\r\nshowed above the back of the chair on which she was sitting, bolt\r\nupright, staring before her as if into vacancy.\r\n\r\nBunting turned round, opened the door, and quickly he went out into the\r\ndark hall\xe2\x80\x94they had given up lighting the gas there some time ago\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nopened the front door.\r\n\r\nWalking down the small flagged path outside, he flung open the iron\r\ngate which gave on to the damp pavement. But there he hesitated. The\r\ncoppers in his pocket seemed to have shrunk in number, and he\r\nremembered ruefully how far Ellen could make even four pennies go.\r\n\r\nThen a boy ran up to him with a sheaf of evening papers, and Bunting,\r\nbeing sorely tempted\xe2\x80\x94fell. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a _Sun_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly, \xe2\x80\x9c_Sun_\r\nor _Echo!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the boy, scarcely stopping to take breath, shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\npenny papers left,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll yer \xe2\x80\x99ave, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an eagerness which was mingled with shame, Bunting drew a penny\r\nout of his pocket and took a paper\xe2\x80\x94it was the _Evening Standard_\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nThen, very slowly, he shut the gate and walked back through the raw,\r\ncold air, up the flagged path, shivering yet full of eager, joyful\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nThanks to that penny he had just spent so recklessly he would pass a\r\nhappy hour, taken, for once, out of his anxious, despondent, miserable\r\nself. It irritated him shrewdly to know that these moments of respite\r\nfrom carking care would not be shared with his poor wife, with\r\ncareworn, troubled Ellen.\r\n\r\nA hot wave of unease, almost of remorse, swept over Bunting. Ellen\r\nwould never have spent that penny on herself\xe2\x80\x94he knew that well\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94and if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so cold, so foggy, so\xe2\x80\x94so drizzly, he would\r\nhave gone out again through the gate and stood under the street lamp to\r\ntake his pleasure. He dreaded with a nervous dread the glance of\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s cold, reproving light-blue eye. That glance would tell him that\r\nhe had had no business to waste a penny on a paper, and that well he\r\nknew it!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door in front of him opened, and he heard a familiar voice\r\nsaying crossly, yet anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you doing out there,\r\nBunting? Come in\xe2\x80\x94do! You\xe2\x80\x99ll catch your death of cold! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhave you ill on my hands as well as everything else!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting\r\nrarely uttered so many words at once nowadays.\r\n\r\nHe walked in through the front door of his cheerless house. \xe2\x80\x9cI went out\r\nto get a paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sullenly.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he was master. He had as much right to spend the money as\r\nshe had; for the matter of that the money on which they were now both\r\nliving had been lent, nay, pressed on him\xe2\x80\x94not on Ellen\xe2\x80\x94by that decent\r\nyoung chap, Joe Chandler. And he, Bunting, had done all he could; he\r\nhad pawned everything he could pawn, while Ellen, so he resentfully\r\nnoticed, still wore her wedding ring.\r\n\r\nHe stepped past her heavily, and though she said nothing, he knew she\r\ngrudged him his coming joy. Then, full of rage with her and contempt\r\nfor himself, and giving himself the luxury of a mild, a very mild,\r\noath\xe2\x80\x94Ellen had very early made it clear she would have no swearing in\r\nher presence\xe2\x80\x94he lit the hall gas full-flare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we hope to get lodgers if they can\xe2\x80\x99t even see the card?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted angrily.\r\n\r\nAnd there was truth in what he said, for now that he had lit the gas,\r\nthe oblong card, though not the word \xe2\x80\x9cApartments\xe2\x80\x9d printed on it, could\r\nbe plainly seen out-lined against the old-fashioned fanlight above the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\nBunting went into the sitting-room, silently followed by his wife, and\r\nthen, sitting down in his nice arm-chair, he poked the little banked-up\r\nfire. It was the first time Bunting had poked the fire for many a long\r\nday, and this exertion of marital authority made him feel better. A man\r\nhas to assert himself sometimes, and he, Bunting, had not asserted\r\nhimself enough lately.\r\n\r\nA little colour came into Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s pale face. She was not used to\r\nbe flouted in this way. For Bunting, when not thoroughly upset, was the\r\nmildest of men.\r\n\r\nShe began moving about the room, flicking off an imperceptible touch of\r\ndust here, straightening a piece of furniture there.\r\n\r\nBut her hands trembled\xe2\x80\x94they trembled with excitement, with self-pity,\r\nwith anger. A penny? It was dreadful\xe2\x80\x94dreadful to have to worry about a\r\npenny! But they had come to the point when one has to worry about\r\npennies. Strange that her husband didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise that.\r\n\r\nBunting looked round once or twice; he would have liked to ask Ellen to\r\nleave off fidgeting, but he was fond of peace, and perhaps, by now, a\r\nlittle bit ashamed of himself, so he refrained from remark, and she\r\nsoon gave over what irritated him of her own accord.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting did not come and sit down as her husband would have\r\nliked her to do. The sight of him, absorbed in his paper as he was,\r\nirritated her, and made her long to get away from him. Opening the door\r\nwhich separated the sitting-room from the bedroom behind, and\xe2\x80\x94shutting\r\nout the aggravating vision of Bunting sitting comfortably by the now\r\nbrightly burning fire, with the _Evening Standard_ spread out before\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94she sat down in the cold darkness, and pressed her hands against\r\nher temples.\r\n\r\nNever, never had she felt so hopeless, so\xe2\x80\x94so broken as now. Where was\r\nthe good of having been an upright, conscientious, self-respecting\r\nwoman all her life long, if it only led to this utter, degrading\r\npoverty and wretchedness? She and Bunting were just past the age which\r\ngentlefolk think proper in a married couple seeking to enter service\r\ntogether, unless, that is, the wife happens to be a professed cook. A\r\ncook and a butler can always get a nice situation. But Mrs. Bunting was\r\nno cook. She could do all right the simple things any lodger she might\r\nget would require, but that was all.\r\n\r\nLodgers? How foolish she had been to think of taking lodgers! For it\r\nhad been her doing. Bunting had been like butter in her hands.\r\n\r\nYet they had begun well, with a lodging-house in a seaside place. There\r\nthey had prospered, not as they had hoped to do, but still pretty well;\r\nand then had come an epidemic of scarlet fever, and that had meant ruin\r\nfor them, and for dozens, nay, hundreds, of other luckless people. Then\r\nhad followed a business experiment which had proved even more\r\ndisastrous, and which had left them in debt\xe2\x80\x94in debt to an extent they\r\ncould never hope to repay, to a good-natured former employer.\r\n\r\nAfter that, instead of going back to service, as they might have done,\r\nperhaps, either together or separately, they had made up their minds to\r\nmake one last effort, and they had taken over, with the trifle of money\r\nthat remained to them, the lease of this house in the Marylebone Road.\r\n\r\nIn former days, when they had each been leading the sheltered,\r\nimpersonal, and, above all, financially easy existence which is the\r\ncompensation life offers to those men and women who deliberately take\r\nupon themselves the yoke of domestic service, they had both lived in\r\nhouses overlooking Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park. It had seemed a wise plan to settle\r\nin the same neighbourhood, the more so that Bunting, who had a good\r\nappearance, had retained the kind of connection which enables a man to\r\nget a job now and again as waiter at private parties.\r\n\r\nBut life moves quickly, jaggedly, for people like the Buntings. Two of\r\nhis former masters had moved to another part of London, and a caterer\r\nin Baker Street whom he had known went bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAnd now? Well, just now Bunting could not have taken a job had one been\r\noffered him, for he had pawned his dress clothes. He had not asked his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s permission to do this, as so good a husband ought to have done.\r\nHe had just gone out and done it. And she had not had the heart to say\r\nanything; nay, it was with part of the money that he had handed her\r\nsilently the evening he did it that she had bought that last packet of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as Mrs. Bunting sat there thinking these painful thoughts,\r\nthere suddenly came to the front door the sound of a loud, tremulous,\r\nuncertain double knock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bunting jumped nervously to her feet. She stood for a moment\r\nlistening in the darkness, a darkness made the blacker by the line of\r\nlight under the door behind which sat Bunting reading his paper.\r\n\r\nAnd then it came again, that loud, tremulous, uncertain double knock;\r\nnot a knock, so the listener told herself, that boded any good.\r\nWould-be lodgers gave sharp, quick, bold, confident raps. No; this must\r\nbe some kind of beggar. The queerest people came at all hours, and\r\nasked\xe2\x80\x94whining or threatening\xe2\x80\x94for money.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had had some sinister experiences with men and\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94especially women\xe2\x80\x94drawn from that nameless, mysterious class made\r\nup of the human flotsam and jetsam which drifts about every great city.\r\nBut since she had taken to leaving the gas in the passage unlit at\r\nnight she had been very little troubled with that kind of visitors,\r\nthose human bats which are attracted by any kind of light but leave\r\nalone those who live in darkness.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of the sitting-room. It was Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s place to go\r\nto the front door, but she knew far better than he did how to deal with\r\ndifficult or obtrusive callers. Still, somehow, she would have liked\r\nhim to go to-night. But Bunting sat on, absorbed in his newspaper; all\r\nhe did at the sound of the bedroom door opening was to look up and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear a knock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout answering his question she went out into the hall.\r\n\r\nSlowly she opened the front door.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the three steps which led up to the door, there stood the\r\nlong, lanky figure of a man, clad in an Inverness cape and an\r\nold-fashioned top hat. He waited for a few seconds blinking at her,\r\nperhaps dazzled by the light of the gas in the passage. Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrained perception told her at once that this man, odd as he looked,\r\nwas a gentleman, belonging by birth to the class with whom her former\r\nemployment had brought her in contact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not a fact that you let lodgings?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, and there was\r\nsomething shrill, unbalanced, hesitating, in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said uncertainly\xe2\x80\x94it was a long, long time since anyone\r\nhad come after their lodgings, anyone, that is, that they could think\r\nof taking into their respectable house.\r\n\r\nInstinctively she stepped a little to one side, and the stranger walked\r\npast her, and so into the hall.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for the first time, Mrs. Bunting noticed that he held a\r\nnarrow bag in his left hand. It was quite a new bag, made of strong\r\nbrown leather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking for some quiet rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; then he repeated the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cquiet rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d in a dreamy, absent way, and as he uttered them\r\nhe looked nervously round him.\r\n\r\nThen his sallow face brightened, for the hall had been carefully\r\nfurnished, and was very clean.\r\n\r\nThere was a neat hat-and-umbrella stand, and the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s weary feet\r\nfell soft on a good, serviceable dark-red drugget, which matched in\r\ncolour the flock-paper on the walls.\r\n\r\nA very superior lodging-house this, and evidently a superior\r\nlodging-house keeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d find my rooms quite quiet, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd just now\r\nI have four to let. The house is empty, save for my husband and me,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting spoke in a civil, passionless voice. It seemed too good to\r\nbe true, this sudden coming of a possible lodger, and of a lodger who\r\nspoke in the pleasant, courteous way and voice which recalled to the\r\npoor woman her happy, far-off days of youth and of security.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds very suitable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFour rooms? Well, perhaps I\r\nought only to take two rooms, but, still, I should like to see all four\r\nbefore I make my choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow fortunate, how very fortunate it was that Bunting had lit the gas!\r\nBut for that circumstance this gentleman would have passed them by.\r\n\r\nShe turned towards the staircase, quite forgetting in her agitation\r\nthat the front door was still open; and it was the stranger whom she\r\nalready in her mind described as \xe2\x80\x9cthe lodger,\xe2\x80\x9d who turned and rather\r\nquickly walked down the passage and shut it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you should have had the\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment their eyes met. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not safe to leave a front door open\r\nin London,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rather sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you do not often do that.\r\nIt would be so easy for anyone to slip in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting felt rather upset. The stranger had still spoken\r\ncourteously, but he was evidently very much put out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, sir, I never leave my front door open,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\nhastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be at all afraid of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, through the closed door of the sitting-room, came the sound\r\nof Bunting coughing\xe2\x80\x94it was just a little, hard cough, but Mrs.\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s future lodger started violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting out a hand and clutching her arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly my husband, sir. He went out to buy a paper a few minutes ago,\r\nand the cold just caught him, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d he looked at her intently, suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what,\r\nmay I ask, is your husband\xe2\x80\x99s occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting drew herself up. The question as to Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s occupation\r\nwas no one\xe2\x80\x99s business but theirs. Still, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for her to show\r\noffence. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes out waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant, sir. He could, of course, valet you should you require him to\r\ndo so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she turned and led the way up the steep, narrow staircase.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the first flight of stairs was what Mrs. Bunting, to\r\nherself, called the drawing-room floor. It consisted of a sitting-room\r\nin front, and a bedroom behind. She opened the door of the sitting-room\r\nand quickly lit the chandelier.\r\n\r\nThis front room was pleasant enough, though perhaps a little\r\nover-encumbered with furniture. Covering the floor was a green carpet\r\nsimulating moss; four chairs were placed round the table which occupied\r\nthe exact middle of the apartment, and in the corner, opposite the door\r\ngiving on to the landing, was a roomy, old-fashioned chiffonnier.\r\n\r\nOn the dark-green walls hung a series of eight engravings, portraits of\r\nearly Victorian belles, clad in lace and tarletan ball dresses, clipped\r\nfrom an old Book of Beauty. Mrs. Bunting was very fond of these\r\npictures; she thought they gave the drawing-room a note of elegance and\r\nrefinement.\r\n\r\nAs she hurriedly turned up the gas she was glad, glad indeed, that she\r\nhad summoned up sufficient energy, two days ago, to give the room a\r\nthorough turn-out.\r\n\r\nIt had remained for a long time in the state in which it had been left\r\nby its last dishonest, dirty occupants when they had been scared into\r\ngoing away by Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s rough threats of the police. But now it was in\r\napple-pie order, with one paramount exception, of which Mrs. Bunting\r\nwas painfully aware. There were no white curtains to the windows, but\r\nthat omission could soon be remedied if this gentleman really took the\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nBut what was this\xe2\x80\x94? The stranger was looking round him rather\r\ndubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather\xe2\x80\x94rather too grand for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like to see your other rooms, Mrs. er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBunting, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as she spoke the dark, heavy load of care again came down and\r\nsettled on her sad, burdened heart. Perhaps she had been mistaken,\r\nafter all\xe2\x80\x94or rather, she had not been mistaken in one sense, but\r\nperhaps this gentleman was a poor gentleman\xe2\x80\x94too poor, that is, to\r\nafford the rent of more than one room, say eight or ten shillings a\r\nweek; eight or ten shillings a week would be very little use to her and\r\nBunting, though better than nothing at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you just look at the bedroom, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cno. I think I should like to see what you have farther\r\nup the house, Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d and then, as if making a prodigious mental\r\neffort, he brought out her name, \xe2\x80\x9cBunting,\xe2\x80\x9d with a kind of gasp.\r\n\r\nThe two top rooms were, of course, immediately above the drawing-room\r\nfloor. But they looked poor and mean, owing to the fact that they were\r\nbare of any kind of ornament. Very little trouble had been taken over\r\ntheir arrangement; in fact, they had been left in much the same\r\ncondition as that in which the Buntings had found them.\r\n\r\nFor the matter of that, it is difficult to make a nice, genteel\r\nsitting-room out of an apartment of which the principal features are a\r\nsink and a big gas stove. The gas stove, of an obsolete pattern, was\r\nfed by a tiresome, shilling-in-the-slot arrangement. It had been the\r\nproperty of the people from whom the Buntings had taken over the lease\r\nof the house, who, knowing it to be of no monetary value, had thrown it\r\nin among the humble fittings they had left behind.\r\n\r\nWhat furniture there was in the room was substantial and clean, as\r\neverything belonging to Mrs. Bunting was bound to be, but it was a\r\nbare, uncomfortable-looking place, and the landlady now felt sorry that\r\nshe had done nothing to make it appear more attractive.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, however, her companion\xe2\x80\x99s dark, sensitive,\r\nhatchet-shaped face became irradiated with satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\r\nCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, for the first time putting down the bag he held\r\nat his feet, and rubbing his long, thin hands together with a quick,\r\nnervous movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is just what I have been looking for.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked with long, eager\r\nstrides towards the gas stove. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst-rate\xe2\x80\x94quite first-rate! Exactly\r\nwhat I wanted to find! You must understand, Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Bunting, that I am\r\na man of science. I make, that is, all sorts of experiments, and I\r\noften require the\xe2\x80\x94ah, well, the presence of great heat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shot out a hand, which she noticed shook a little, towards the\r\nstove. \xe2\x80\x9cThis, too, will be useful\xe2\x80\x94exceedingly useful, to me,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ntouched the edge of the stone sink with a lingering, caressing touch.\r\n\r\nHe threw his head back and passed his hand over his high, bare\r\nforehead; then, moving towards a chair, he sat down\xe2\x80\x94wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntired,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9ctired\xe2\x80\x94tired! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been walking\r\nabout all day, Mrs. Bunting, and I could find nothing to sit down upon.\r\nThey do not put benches for tired men in the London streets. They do so\r\non the Continent. In some ways they are far more humane on the\r\nContinent than they are in England, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said civilly; and then, after a nervous glance, she\r\nasked the question of which the answer would mean so much to her, \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nyou mean to take my rooms, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis room, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cThis room is exactly\r\nwhat I have been looking for, and longing for, the last few days;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen hastily he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean this kind of place is what I have always\r\nwanted to possess, Mrs. Bunting. You would be surprised if you knew how\r\ndifficult it is to get anything of the sort. But now my weary search\r\nhas ended, and that is a relief\xe2\x80\x94a very, very great relief to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up and looked round him with a dreamy, abstracted air. And\r\nthen, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my bag?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly, and there came a note of\r\nsharp, angry fear in his voice. He glared at the quiet woman standing\r\nbefore him, and for a moment Mrs. Bunting felt a tremor of fright shoot\r\nthrough her. It seemed a pity that Bunting was so far away, right down\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting was aware that eccentricity has always been a\r\nperquisite, as it were the special luxury, of the well-born and of the\r\nwell-educated. Scholars, as she well knew, are never quite like other\r\npeople, and her new lodger was undoubtedly a scholar. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely I had a\r\nbag when I came in?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a scared, troubled voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said soothingly, and, stooping, picked it up and\r\nhanded it to him. And as she did so she noticed that the bag was not at\r\nall heavy; it was evidently by no means full.\r\n\r\nHe took it eagerly from her. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthere is something in that bag which is very precious to me\xe2\x80\x94something I\r\nprocured with infinite difficulty, and which I could never get again\r\nwithout running into great danger, Mrs. Bunting. That must be the\r\nexcuse for my late agitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout terms, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little timidly, returning to the subject\r\nwhich meant so much, so very much to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout terms?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed. And then there came a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is\r\nSleuth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cS-l-e-u-t-h. Think of a hound, Mrs.\r\nBunting, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget my name. I could provide you with a\r\nreference\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he gave her what she described to herself as a funny,\r\nsideways look), \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should prefer you to dispense with that, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind. I am quite willing to pay you\xe2\x80\x94well, shall we say a month in\r\nadvance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spot of red shot into Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. She felt sick with\r\nrelief\xe2\x80\x94nay, with a joy which was almost pain. She had not known till\r\nthat moment how hungry she was\xe2\x80\x94how eager for\xe2\x80\x94a good meal. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would\r\nbe all right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you going to charge me?\xe2\x80\x9d There had come a kindly, almost\r\na friendly note into his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWith attendance, mind! I shall expect\r\nyou to give me attendance, and I need hardly ask if you can cook, Mrs.\r\nBunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a plain cook. What would you say to\r\ntwenty-five shillings a week, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him deprecatingly,\r\nand as he did not answer she went on falteringly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, sir, it may\r\nseem a good deal, but you would have the best of attendance and careful\r\ncooking\xe2\x80\x94and my husband, sir\xe2\x80\x94he would be pleased to valet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of that sort done for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth\r\nhastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer looking after my own clothes. I am used to waiting\r\non myself. But, Mrs. Bunting, I have a great dislike to sharing\r\nlodgings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cI could let you have the use of the two\r\nfloors for the same price\xe2\x80\x94that is, until we get another lodger. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like you to sleep in the back room up here, sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\npoor little room. You could do as you say, sir\xe2\x80\x94do your work and your\r\nexperiments up here, and then have your meals in the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sounds a good plan. And if I offered\r\nyou two pounds, or two guineas? Might I then rely on your not taking\r\nanother lodger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be very glad only to have you to wait on,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have a key to the door of this room, Mrs. Bunting? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to be disturbed while I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment, and then said again, rather urgently, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou have a key to this door, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a key\xe2\x80\x94a very nice little key. The people who\r\nlived here before had a new kind of lock put on to the door.\xe2\x80\x9d She went\r\nover, and throwing the door open, showed him that a round disk had been\r\nfitted above the old keyhole.\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head, and then, after standing silent a little, as if\r\nabsorbed in thought, \xe2\x80\x9cForty-two shillings a week? Yes, that will suit\r\nme perfectly. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin now by paying my first month\xe2\x80\x99s rent in\r\nadvance. Now, four times forty-two shillings is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he jerked his head\r\nback and stared at his new landlady; for the first time he smiled, a\r\nqueer, wry smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, just eight pounds eight shillings, Mrs.\r\nBunting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand through into an inner pocket of his long cape-like\r\ncoat and took out a handful of sovereigns. Then he began putting these\r\ndown in a row on the bare wooden table which stood in the centre of the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s five\xe2\x80\x94six\xe2\x80\x94seven\xe2\x80\x94eight\xe2\x80\x94nine\xe2\x80\x94ten pounds. You\xe2\x80\x99d better keep\r\nthe odd change, Mrs. Bunting, for I shall want you to do some shopping\r\nfor me to-morrow morning. I met with a misfortune to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d But the new\r\nlodger did not speak as if his misfortune, whatever it was, weighed on\r\nhis spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s heart was going\r\nthump\xe2\x80\x94thump\xe2\x80\x94thump. She felt extraordinarily moved, dizzy with relief\r\nand joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a very great misfortune! I lost my luggage, the few things I\r\nmanaged to bring away with me.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice dropped suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said that,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a fool to say that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, more loudly, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone said to me, \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t go into a\r\nlodging-house without any luggage. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take you in.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\n_you_ have taken me in, Mrs. Bunting, and I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful for\xe2\x80\x94for the kind\r\nway you have met me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her feelingly, appealingly, and Mrs.\r\nBunting was touched. She was beginning to feel very kindly towards her\r\nnew lodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I know a gentleman when I see one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a break in\r\nher staid voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to see about getting some clothes to-morrow, Mrs.\r\nBunting.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he looked at her appealingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99d like to wash your hands now, sir. And would you tell me\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99d like for supper? We haven\xe2\x80\x99t much in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, anything\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go out for\r\nme. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cold, foggy, wet night, Mrs. Bunting. If you have a little\r\nbread-and-butter and a cup of milk I shall be quite satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a nice sausage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nIt was a very nice sausage, and she had bought it that same morning for\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s supper; as to herself, she had been going to content herself\r\nwith a little bread and cheese. But now\xe2\x80\x94wonderful, almost, intoxicating\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94she could send Bunting out to get anything they both liked. The\r\nten sovereigns lay in her hand full of comfort and good cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sausage? No, I fear that will hardly do. I never touch flesh meat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a long, long time since I tasted a sausage, Mrs.\r\nBunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated a moment, then asked stiffly, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwill you be requiring any beer, or wine, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange, wild look of lowering wrath suddenly filled Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npale face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. I thought I had made that quite clear, Mrs. Bunting. I\r\nhad hoped to hear that you were an abstainer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am, sir, lifelong. And so\xe2\x80\x99s Bunting been since we married.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nmight have said, had she been a woman given to make such confidences,\r\nthat she had made Bunting abstain very early in their acquaintance.\r\nThat he had given in about that had been the thing that first made her\r\nbelieve, that he was sincere in all the nonsense that he talked to her,\r\nin those far-away days of his courting. Glad she was now that he had\r\ntaken the pledge as a younger man; but for that nothing would have kept\r\nhim from the drink during the bad times they had gone through.\r\n\r\nAnd then, going downstairs, she showed Mr. Sleuth the nice bedroom\r\nwhich opened out of the drawing-room. It was a replica of Mrs.\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s own room just underneath, excepting that everything up here\r\nhad cost just a little more, and was therefore rather better in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe new lodger looked round him with such a strange expression of\r\ncontent and peace stealing over his worn face. \xe2\x80\x9cA haven of rest,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmuttered; and then, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He bringeth them to their desired haven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBeautiful words, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting felt a little startled. It was the first time anyone had\r\nquoted the Bible to her for many a long day. But it seemed to set the\r\nseal, as it were, on Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s respectability.\r\n\r\nWhat a comfort it was, too, that she had to deal with only one lodger,\r\nand that a gentleman, instead of with a married couple! Very peculiar\r\nmarried couples had drifted in and out of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodgings, not only here, in London, but at the seaside.\r\n\r\nHow unlucky they had been, to be sure! Since they had come to London\r\nnot a single pair of lodgers had been even moderately respectable and\r\nkindly. The last lot had belonged to that horrible underworld of men\r\nand women who, having, as the phrase goes, seen better days, now only\r\nkeep their heads above water with the help of petty fraud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you up some hot water in a minute, sir, and some clean\r\ntowels,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going to the door.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Sleuth turned quickly round. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and as he\r\nspoke he stammered a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to interpret the word\r\nattendance too liberally. You need not run yourself off your feet for\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99m accustomed to look after myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, queerly, uncomfortably, she felt herself dismissed\xe2\x80\x94even a little\r\nsnubbed. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only just let you know when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve your supper ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what was a little snub compared with the intense relief and joy of\r\ngoing down and telling Bunting of the great piece of good fortune which\r\nhad fallen their way?\r\n\r\nStaid Mrs. Bunting seemed to make but one leap down the steep stairs.\r\nIn the hall, however, she pulled herself together, and tried to still\r\nher agitation. She had always disliked and despised any show of\r\nemotion; she called such betrayal of feeling \xe2\x80\x9cmaking a fuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOpening the door of their sitting-room, she stood for a moment looking\r\nat her husband\xe2\x80\x99s bent back, and she realised, with a pang of pain, how\r\nthe last few weeks had aged him.\r\n\r\nBunting suddenly looked round, and, seeing his wife, stood up. He put\r\nthe paper he had been holding down on to the table: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwell, who was it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt rather ashamed of himself; it was he who ought to have answered\r\nthe door and done all that parleying of which he had heard murmurs.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a moment his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand shot out, and the ten sovereigns\r\nfell in a little clinking heap on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, with an excited, tearful quiver in her\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cLook there, Bunting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting did look there, but with a troubled, frowning gaze.\r\n\r\nHe was not quick-witted, but at once he jumped to the conclusion that\r\nhis wife had just had in a furniture dealer, and that this ten pounds\r\nrepresented all their nice furniture upstairs. If that were so, then it\r\nwas the beginning of the end. That furniture in the first-floor front\r\nhad cost\xe2\x80\x94Ellen had reminded him of the fact bitterly only\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x94seventeen pounds nine shillings, and every single item had\r\nbeen a bargain. It was too bad that she had only got ten pounds for it.\r\n\r\nYet he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to reproach her.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak as he looked across at her, and meeting that troubled,\r\nrebuking glance, she guessed what it was that he thought had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve a new lodger!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94and, Bunting? He\xe2\x80\x99s quite the\r\ngentleman! He actually offered to pay four weeks in advance, at two\r\nguineas a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting moved quickly round the table, and together they stood there,\r\nfascinated by the little heap of gold. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s ten sovereigns\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the gentleman said I\xe2\x80\x99d have to buy some things for him to-morrow.\r\nAnd, oh, Bunting, he\xe2\x80\x99s so well spoken, I really felt that\xe2\x80\x94I really felt\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and then Mrs. Bunting, taking a step or two sideways, sat down,\r\nand throwing her little black apron over her face burst into gasping\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\nBunting patted her back timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cEllen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, much moved by her\r\nagitation, \xe2\x80\x9cEllen? Don\xe2\x80\x99t take on so, my dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99m a fool\xe2\x80\x94I know I am! But, oh, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think we was ever going to have any luck again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she told him\xe2\x80\x94or rather tried to tell him\xe2\x80\x94what the lodger was\r\nlike. Mrs. Bunting was no hand at talking, but one thing she did\r\nimpress on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind, namely, that Mr. Sleuth was eccentric,\r\nas so many clever people are eccentric\xe2\x80\x94that is, in a harmless way\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat he must be humoured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be waited on much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last wiping\r\nher eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can see he will want a good bit of looking after, all\r\nthe same, poor gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just as the words left her mouth there came the unfamiliar sound of\r\na loud ring. It was that of the drawing-room bell being pulled again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\nBunting looked at his wife eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d better go up, eh,\r\nEllen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He felt quite anxious to see their new lodger. For the\r\nmatter of that, it would be a relief to be doing something again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go up! Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep him waiting! I wonder what\r\nit is he wants? I said I\xe2\x80\x99d let him know when his supper was ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment later Bunting came down again. There was an odd smile on his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever d\xe2\x80\x99you think he wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered mysteriously. And\r\nas she said nothing, he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s asked me for the loan of a\r\nBible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything so out of the way in that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nhastily, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99specially if he don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it up to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then going to a small table which stood between the two windows,\r\nMrs. Bunting took off it a large Bible, which had been given to her as\r\na wedding present by a married lady with whose mother she had lived for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it would do quite well when you take up his supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBunting; and, then, \xe2\x80\x9cEllen? He\xe2\x80\x99s a queer-looking cove\xe2\x80\x94not like any\r\ngentleman I ever had to do with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting rather fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d But still he looked at her doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nasked him if he\xe2\x80\x99d like me to just put away his clothes. But, Ellen, he\r\nsaid he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got any clothes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t;\xe2\x80\x9d she spoke quickly, defensively. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had the\r\nmisfortune to lose his luggage. He\xe2\x80\x99s one dishonest folk \xe2\x80\x99ud take\r\nadvantage of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one can see that with half an eye,\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting agreed.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was silence for a few moments, while Mrs. Bunting put\r\ndown on a little bit of paper the things she wanted her husband to go\r\nout and buy for her. She handed him the list, together with a\r\nsovereign. \xe2\x80\x9cBe as quick as you can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I feel a bit\r\nhungry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be going down now to see about Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s supper. He\r\nonly wants a glass of milk and two eggs. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve never fallen to\r\nbad eggs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleuth,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Bunting, staring at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a queer name! How d\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nspell it\xe2\x80\x94S-l-u-t-h?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she shot out, \xe2\x80\x9cS-l-e\xe2\x80\x94u\xe2\x80\x94t\xe2\x80\x94h.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98Think of a hound and you\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget my name,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs.\r\nBunting smiled.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to the door, Bunting turned round: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll now be able to\r\npay young Chandler back some o\xe2\x80\x99 that thirty shillings. I am glad.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nnodded; her heart, as the saying is, too full for words.\r\n\r\nAnd then each went about his and her business\xe2\x80\x94Bunting out into the\r\ndrenching fog, his wife down to her cold kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe lodger\xe2\x80\x99s tray was soon ready; everything upon it nicely and\r\ndaintily arranged. Mrs. Bunting knew how to wait upon a gentleman.\r\n\r\nJust as the landlady was going up the kitchen stair, she suddenly\r\nremembered Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s request for a Bible. Putting the tray down in\r\nthe hall, she went into her sitting-room and took up the Book; but when\r\nback in the hall she hesitated a moment as to whether it was worth\r\nwhile to make two journeys. But, no, she thought she could manage;\r\nclasping the large, heavy volume under her arm, and taking up the tray,\r\nshe walked slowly up the staircase.\r\n\r\nBut a great surprise awaited her; in fact, when Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady\r\nopened the door of the drawing-room she very nearly dropped the tray.\r\nShe actually did drop the Bible, and it fell with a heavy thud to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe new lodger had turned all those nice framed engravings of the early\r\nVictorian beauties, of which Mrs. Bunting had been so proud, with their\r\nfaces to the wall!\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was really too surprised to speak. Putting the tray\r\ndown on the table, she stooped and picked up the Book. It troubled her\r\nthat the Book should have fallen to the ground; but really she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen able to help it\xe2\x80\x94it was mercy that the tray hadn\xe2\x80\x99t fallen, too.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth got up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I have taken the liberty to arrange the room as I\r\nshould wish it to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Bunting, I\r\nfelt as I sat here that these women\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed me about. It was a\r\nmost unpleasant sensation, and gave me quite an eerie feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady was now laying a small tablecloth over half of the table.\r\nShe made no answer to her lodger\xe2\x80\x99s remark, for the good reason that she\r\ndid not know what to say.\r\n\r\nHer silence seemed to distress Mr. Sleuth. After what seemed a long\r\npause, he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer bare walls, Mrs. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke with some agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\na matter of fact, I have been used to seeing bare walls about me for a\r\nlong time.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, at last his landlady answered him, in a composed,\r\nsoothing voice, which somehow did him good to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite\r\nunderstand, sir. And when Bunting comes in he shall take the pictures\r\nall down. We have plenty of space in our own rooms for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x94thank you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth appeared greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have brought you up my Bible, sir. I understood you wanted the\r\nloan of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth stared at her as if dazed for a moment; and then, rousing\r\nhimself, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I do. There is no reading like the Book.\r\nThere is something there which suits every state of mind, aye, and of\r\nbody too\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Mrs. Bunting, having laid out what really\r\nlooked a very appetising little meal, turned round and quietly shut the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nShe went down straight into her sitting-room and waited there for\r\nBunting, instead of going to the kitchen to clear up. And as she did so\r\nthere came to her a comfortable recollection, an incident of her\r\nlong-past youth, in the days when she, then Ellen Green, had maided a\r\ndear old lady.\r\n\r\nThe old lady had a favourite nephew\xe2\x80\x94a bright, jolly young gentleman,\r\nwho was learning to paint animals in Paris. And one morning Mr.\r\nAlgernon\xe2\x80\x94that was his rather peculiar Christian name\xe2\x80\x94had had the\r\nimpudence to turn to the wall six beautiful engravings of paintings\r\ndone by the famous Mr. Landseer!\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting remembered all the circumstances as if they had only\r\noccurred yesterday, and yet she had not thought of them for years.\r\n\r\nIt was quite early; she had come down\xe2\x80\x94for in those days maids weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthought so much of as they are now, and she slept with the upper\r\nhousemaid, and it was the upper housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s duty to be down very\r\nearly\xe2\x80\x94and, there, in the dining-room, she had found Mr. Algernon\r\nengaged in turning each engraving to the wall! Now, his aunt thought\r\nall the world of those pictures, and Ellen had felt quite concerned,\r\nfor it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do for a young gentleman to put himself wrong with a\r\nkind aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she had exclaimed in dismay, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\neven now she could almost hear his merry voice, as he had answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam doing my duty, fair Helen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had always called her \xe2\x80\x9cfair Helen\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhen no one was listening. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I draw ordinary animals when I see\r\nthese half-human monsters staring at me all the time I am having my\r\nbreakfast, my lunch, and my dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d That was what Mr. Algernon had\r\nsaid in his own saucy way, and that was what he repeated in a more\r\nserious, respectful manner to his aunt, when that dear old lady had\r\ncome downstairs. In fact he had declared, quite soberly, that the\r\nbeautiful animals painted by Mr. Landseer put his eye out!\r\n\r\nBut his aunt had been very much annoyed\xe2\x80\x94in fact, she had made him turn\r\nthe pictures all back again; and as long as he stayed there he just had\r\nto put up with what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthose half-human monsters.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBunting, sitting there, thinking the matter of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s odd\r\nbehaviour over, was glad to recall that funny incident of her long-gone\r\nyouth. It seemed to prove that her new lodger was not so strange as he\r\nappeared to be. Still, when Bunting came in, she did not tell him the\r\nqueer thing which had happened. She told herself that she would be\r\nquite able to manage the taking down of the pictures in the\r\ndrawing-room herself.\r\n\r\nBut before getting ready their own supper, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady went\r\nupstairs to clear away, and when on the staircase she heard the sound\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94was it talking, in the drawing-room? Startled, she waited a moment\r\non the landing outside the drawing-room door, then she realised that it\r\nwas only the lodger reading aloud to himself. There was something very\r\nawful in the words which rose and fell on her listening ears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange woman is a narrow gate. She also lieth in wait as for a\r\nprey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained where she was, her hand on the handle of the door, and\r\nagain there broke on her shrinking ears that curious, high, sing-song\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cHer house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made the listener feel quite queer. But at last she summoned up\r\ncourage, knocked, and walked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better clear away, sir, had I not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And Mr. Sleuth\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\nThen he got up and closed the Book. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very tired. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a long and a very weary day,\r\nMrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter he had disappeared into the back room, Mrs. Bunting climbed up on\r\na chair and unhooked the pictures which had so offended Mr. Sleuth.\r\nEach left an unsightly mark on the wall\xe2\x80\x94but that, after all, could not\r\nbe helped.\r\n\r\nTreading softly, so that Bunting should not hear her, she carried them\r\ndown, two by two, and stood them behind her bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting woke up the next morning feeling happier than she had felt\r\nfor a very, very long time.\r\n\r\nFor just one moment she could not think why she felt so different\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen she suddenly remembered.\r\n\r\nHow comfortable it was to know that upstairs, just over her head, lay,\r\nin the well-found bed she had bought with such satisfaction at an\r\nauction held in a Baker Street house, a lodger who was paying two\r\nguineas a week! Something seemed to tell her that Mr. Sleuth would be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca permanency.\xe2\x80\x9d In any case, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be her fault if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. As\r\nto his\xe2\x80\x94his queerness, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something funny in\r\neverybody. But after she had got up, and as the morning wore itself\r\naway, Mrs. Bunting grew a little anxious, for there came no sound at\r\nall from the new lodger\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. At twelve, however, the drawing-room\r\nbell rang. Mrs. Bunting hurried upstairs. She was painfully anxious to\r\nplease and satisfy Mr. Sleuth. His coming had only been in the nick of\r\ntime to save them from terrible disaster.\r\n\r\nShe found her lodger up, and fully dressed. He was sitting at the round\r\ntable which occupied the middle of the sitting-room, and his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge Bible lay open before him.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bunting came in, he looked up, and she was troubled to see how\r\ntired and worn he seemed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto have a Concordance, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; she had no idea what a Concordance could be, but\r\nshe was quite sure that she had nothing of the sort about.\r\n\r\nAnd then her new lodger proceeded to tell her what it was he desired\r\nher to buy for him. She had supposed the bag he had brought with him to\r\ncontain certain little necessaries of civilised life\xe2\x80\x94such articles, for\r\ninstance, as a comb and brush, a set of razors, a toothbrush, to say\r\nnothing of a couple of nightshirts\xe2\x80\x94but no, that was evidently not so,\r\nfor Mr. Sleuth required all these things to be bought now.\r\n\r\nAfter having cooked him a nice breakfast Mrs. Bunting hurried out to\r\npurchase the things of which he was in urgent need.\r\n\r\nHow pleasant it was to feel that there was money in her purse again\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nonly someone else\xe2\x80\x99s money, but money she was now in the very act of\r\nearning so agreeably.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting first made her way to a little barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop close by. It\r\nwas there she purchased the brush and comb and the razors. It was a\r\nfunny, rather smelly little place, and she hurried as much as she\r\ncould, the more so that the foreigner who served her insisted on\r\ntelling her some of the strange, peculiar details of this Avenger\r\nmurder which had taken place forty-eight hours before, and in which\r\nBunting took such a morbid interest.\r\n\r\nThe conversation upset Mrs. Bunting. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to think of\r\nanything painful or disagreeable on such a day as this.\r\n\r\nThen she came back and showed the lodger her various purchases. Mr.\r\nSleuth was pleased with everything, and thanked her most courteously.\r\nBut when she suggested doing his bedroom he frowned, and looked quite\r\nput out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease wait till this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my custom to\r\nstay at home all day. I only care to walk about the streets when the\r\nlights are lit. You must bear with me, Mrs. Bunting, if I seem a\r\nlittle, just a little, unlike the lodgers you have been accustomed to.\r\nAnd I must ask you to understand that I must not be disturbed when\r\nthinking out my problems\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off short, sighed, then added\r\nsolemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor mine are the great problems of life and death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Bunting willingly fell in with his wishes. In spite of her\r\nprim manner and love of order, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady was a true\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94she had, that is, an infinite patience with masculine vagaries\r\nand oddities.\r\n\r\nWhen she was downstairs again, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady met with a\r\nsurprise; but it was quite a pleasant surprise. While she had been\r\nupstairs, talking to the lodger, Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s young friend, Joe Chandler,\r\nthe detective, had come in, and as she walked into the sitting-room she\r\nsaw that her husband was pushing half a sovereign across the table\r\ntowards Joe.\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s fair, good-natured face was full of satisfaction: not at\r\nseeing his money again, mark you, but at the news Bunting had evidently\r\nbeen telling him\xe2\x80\x94that news of the sudden wonderful change in their\r\nfortunes, the coming of an ideal lodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to do his bedroom till he\xe2\x80\x99s gone out!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. And then she sat down for a bit of a rest.\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to know that the lodger was eating his good breakfast,\r\nand there was no need to think of him for the present. In a few minutes\r\nshe would be going down to make her own and Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, and she\r\ntold Joe Chandler that he might as well stop and have a bite with them.\r\n\r\nHer heart warmed to the young man, for Mrs. Bunting was in a mood which\r\nseldom surprised her\xe2\x80\x94a mood to be pleased with anything and everything.\r\nNay, more. When Bunting began to ask Joe Chandler about the last of\r\nthose awful Avenger murders, she even listened with a certain languid\r\ninterest to all he had to say.\r\n\r\nIn the morning paper which Bunting had begun taking again that very day\r\nthree columns were devoted to the extraordinary mystery which was now\r\nbeginning to be the one topic of talk all over London, West and East,\r\nNorth and South. Bunting had read out little bits about it while they\r\nate their breakfast, and in spite of herself Mrs. Bunting had felt\r\nthrilled and excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do say,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Bunting cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cThey do say, Joe, that the\r\npolice have a clue they won\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing about?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked expectantly\r\nat his visitor. To Bunting the fact that Chandler was attached to the\r\ndetective section of the Metropolitan Police invested the young man\r\nwith a kind of sinister glory\xe2\x80\x94especially just now, when these awful and\r\nmysterious crimes were amazing and terrifying the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem who says that says wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Chandler slowly, and a look\r\nof unease, of resentment came over his fair, stolid face. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould make\r\na good bit of difference to me if the Yard had a clue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy that, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling\r\nindulgently; the young man\xe2\x80\x99s keenness about his work pleased her. And\r\nin his slow, sure way Joe Chandler was very keen, and took his job very\r\nseriously. He put his whole heart and mind into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom to-day I\xe2\x80\x99m on this business\r\nmyself. You see, Mrs. Bunting, the Yard\xe2\x80\x99s nettled\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99re all on our mettle\xe2\x80\x94that we are. I was right down sorry for the\r\npoor chap who was on point duty in the street where the last one\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting incredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean there was a policeman\r\nthere, within a few yards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat fact hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been recorded in his newspaper.\r\n\r\nChandler nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I do mean, Mr. Bunting! The man\r\nis near off his head, so I\xe2\x80\x99m told. He did hear a yell, so he says, but\r\nhe took no notice\xe2\x80\x94there are a good few yells in that part o\xe2\x80\x99 London, as\r\nyou can guess. People always quarrelling and rowing at one another in\r\nsuch low parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the bits of grey paper on which the monster writes his\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Bunting eagerly.\r\n\r\nPublic imagination had been much stirred by the account of those\r\nthree-cornered pieces of grey paper, pinned to the victims\xe2\x80\x99 skirts, on\r\nwhich was roughly written in red ink and in printed characters the\r\nwords \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis round, fat face was full of questioning eagerness. He put his\r\nelbows on the table, and stared across expectantly at the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA funny kind of visiting card, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting laughed; the notion struck\r\nhim as downright comic.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting coloured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing to make a joke about,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid reprovingly.\r\n\r\nAnd Chandler backed her up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said feelingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever forget what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been made to see over this job. And as for that\r\ngrey bit of paper, Mr. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, those grey bits of paper\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncorrected himself hastily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou know they\xe2\x80\x99ve three of them now at the\r\nYard\xe2\x80\x94well, they gives me the horrors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds me that I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be wasting\r\nmy time in pleasant company\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you stay and have a bit of dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting\r\nsolicitously.\r\n\r\nBut the detective shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had a bite before I\r\ncame out. Our job\xe2\x80\x99s a queer kind of job, as you know. A lot\xe2\x80\x99s left to\r\nour discretion, so to speak, but it don\xe2\x80\x99t leave us much time for lazing\r\nabout, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the door he turned round, and with elaborate\r\ncarelessness he inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cAny chance of Miss Daisy coming to London\r\nagain soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting shook his head, but his face brightened. He was very, very fond\r\nof his only child; the pity was he saw her so seldom. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not Joe. Old Aunt, as we calls the old lady, keeps Daisy\r\npretty tightly tied to her apron-string. She was quite put about that\r\nweek the child was up with us last June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Well, so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter his wife had let their friend out, Bunting said cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\r\nseems to like our Daisy, eh, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting shook her head scornfully. She did not exactly dislike\r\nthe girl, though she did not hold with the way Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was\r\nbeing managed by that old aunt of hers\xe2\x80\x94an idle, good-for-nothing way,\r\nvery different from the fashion in which she herself had been trained\r\nat the Foundling, for Mrs. Bunting as a little child had known no other\r\nhome, no other family than those provided by good Captain Coram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s too sensible a young chap to be thinking of girls yet\r\nawhile,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cTimes be changed. In my young\r\ndays chaps always had time for that. \xe2\x80\x99Twas just a notion that came into\r\nmy head, hearing him asking, anxious-like, after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after the street lamps were well alight, Mr. Sleuth\r\nwent out, and that same evening there came two parcels addressed to his\r\nlandlady. These parcels contained clothes. But it was quite clear to\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that they were not new clothes. In fact, they had\r\nevidently been bought in some good second-hand clothes-shop. A funny\r\nthing for a real gentleman like Mr. Sleuth to do! It proved that he had\r\ngiven up all hope of getting back his lost luggage.\r\n\r\nWhen the lodger had gone out he had not taken his bag with him, of that\r\nMrs. Bunting was positive. And yet, though she searched high and low\r\nfor it, she could not find the place where Mr. Sleuth kept it. And at\r\nlast, had it not been that she was a very clear-headed woman, with a\r\ngood memory, she would have been disposed to think that the bag had\r\nnever existed, save in her imagination.\r\n\r\nBut no, she could not tell herself that! She remembered exactly how it\r\nhad looked when Mr. Sleuth had first stood, a strange, queer-looking\r\nfigure of a man, on her doorstep.\r\n\r\nShe further remembered how he had put the bag down on the floor of the\r\ntop front room, and then, forgetting what he had done, how he had asked\r\nher eagerly, in a tone of angry fear, where the bag was\xe2\x80\x94only to find it\r\nsafely lodged at his feet!\r\n\r\nAs time went on Mrs. Bunting thought a great deal about that bag, for,\r\nstrange and amazing fact, she never saw Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bag again. But, of\r\ncourse, she soon formed a theory as to its whereabouts. The brown\r\nleather bag which had formed Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s only luggage the afternoon of\r\nhis arrival was almost certainly locked up in the lower part of the\r\ndrawing-room chiffonnier. Mr. Sleuth evidently always carried the key\r\nof the little corner cupboard about his person; Mrs. Bunting had also\r\nhad a good hunt for that key, but, as was the case with the bag, the\r\nkey disappeared, and she never saw either the one or the other again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow quietly, how uneventfully, how pleasantly, sped the next few days.\r\nAlready life was settling down into a groove. Waiting on Mr. Sleuth was\r\njust what Mrs. Bunting could manage to do easily, and without tiring\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIt had at once become clear that the lodger preferred to be waited on\r\nonly by one person, and that person his landlady. He gave her very\r\nlittle trouble. Indeed, it did her good having to wait on the lodger;\r\nit even did her good that he was not like other gentlemen; for the fact\r\noccupied her mind, and in a way it amused her. The more so that\r\nwhatever his oddities Mr. Sleuth had none of those tiresome,\r\ndisagreeable ways with which landladies are only too familiar, and\r\nwhich seem peculiar only to those human beings who also happen to be\r\nlodgers. To take but one point: Mr. Sleuth did not ask to be called\r\nunduly early. Bunting and his Ellen had fallen into the way of lying\r\nrather late in the morning, and it was a great comfort not to have to\r\nturn out to make the lodger a cup of tea at seven, or even half-past\r\nseven. Mr. Sleuth seldom required anything before eleven.\r\n\r\nBut odd he certainly was.\r\n\r\nThe second evening he had been with them Mr. Sleuth had brought in a\r\nbook of which the queer name was Cruden\xe2\x80\x99s Concordance. That and the\r\nBible\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bunting had soon discovered that there was a relation\r\nbetween the two books\xe2\x80\x94seemed to be the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s only reading. He spent\r\nhours each day, generally after he had eaten the breakfast which also\r\nserved for luncheon, poring over the Old Testament and over that\r\nstrange kind of index to the Book.\r\n\r\nAs for the delicate and yet the all-important question of money, Mr.\r\nSleuth was everything\xe2\x80\x94everything that the most exacting landlady could\r\nhave wished. Never had there been a more confiding or trusting\r\ngentleman. On the very first day he had been with them he had allowed\r\nhis money\xe2\x80\x94the considerable sum of one hundred and eighty-four\r\nsovereigns\xe2\x80\x94to lie about wrapped up in little pieces of rather dirty\r\nnewspaper on his dressing-table. That had quite upset Mrs. Bunting. She\r\nhad allowed herself respectfully to point out to him that what he was\r\ndoing was foolish, indeed wrong. But as only answer he had laughed, and\r\nshe had been startled when the loud, unusual and discordant sound had\r\nissued from his thin lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know those I can trust,\xe2\x80\x9d he had answered, stuttering rather, as was\r\nhis way when moved. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94and I assure you, Mrs. Bunting, that I hardly\r\nhave to speak to a human being\xe2\x80\x94especially to a woman\xe2\x80\x9d (and he had drawn\r\nin his breath with a hissing sound) \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I know exactly what manner\r\nof person is before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken the landlady very long to find out that her lodger had\r\na queer kind of fear and dislike of women. When she was doing the\r\nstaircase and landings she would often hear Mr. Sleuth reading aloud to\r\nhimself passages in the Bible that were very uncomplimentary to her\r\nsex. But Mrs. Bunting had no very great opinion of her sister woman, so\r\nthat didn\xe2\x80\x99t put her out. Besides, where one\xe2\x80\x99s lodger is concerned, a\r\ndislike of women is better than\xe2\x80\x94well, than the other thing.\r\n\r\nIn any case, where would have been the good of worrying about the\r\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s funny ways? Of course, Mr. Sleuth was eccentric. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen, as Bunting funnily styled it, \xe2\x80\x9cjust a leetle touched upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here, living this strange, solitary life in lodgings. He\r\nwould be living in quite a different sort of way with some of his\r\nrelatives, or with a friend of his own class.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when Mrs. Bunting, looking back\xe2\x80\x94as even the least\r\nimaginative of us are apt to look back to any part of our own past\r\nlives which becomes for any reason poignantly memorable\xe2\x80\x94wondered how\r\nsoon it was that she had discovered that her lodger was given to\r\ncreeping out of the house at a time when almost all living things\r\nprefer to sleep.\r\n\r\nShe brought herself to believe\xe2\x80\x94but I am inclined to doubt whether she\r\nwas right in so believing\xe2\x80\x94that the first time she became aware of this\r\nstrange nocturnal habit of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s happened to be during the night\r\nwhich preceded the day on which she had observed a very curious\r\ncircumstance. This very curious circumstance was the complete\r\ndisappearance of one of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s three suits of clothes.\r\n\r\nIt always passes my comprehension how people can remember, over any\r\nlength of time, not every moment of certain happenings, for that is\r\nnatural enough, but the day, the hour, the minute when these happenings\r\ntook place! Much as she thought about it afterwards, even Mrs. Bunting\r\nnever quite made up her mind whether it was during the fifth or the\r\nsixth night of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s stay under her roof that she became aware\r\nthat he had gone out at two in the morning and had only come in at\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nBut that there did come such a night is certain\xe2\x80\x94as certain as is the\r\nfact that her discovery coincided with various occurrences which were\r\ndestined to remain retrospectively memorable.\r\n\r\nIt was intensely dark, intensely quiet\xe2\x80\x94the darkest quietest hour of the\r\nnight, when suddenly Mrs. Bunting was awakened from a deep, dreamless\r\nsleep by sounds at once unexpected and familiar. She knew at once what\r\nthose sounds were. They were those made by Mr. Sleuth, first coming\r\ndown the stairs, and walking on tiptoe\xe2\x80\x94she was sure it was on\r\ntiptoe\xe2\x80\x94past her door, and finally softly shutting the front door behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTry as she would, Mrs. Bunting found it quite impossible to go to sleep\r\nagain. There she lay wide awake, afraid to move lest Bunting should\r\nwaken up too, till she heard Mr. Sleuth, three hours later, creep back\r\ninto the house and so up to bed.\r\n\r\nThen, and not till then, she slept again. But in the morning she felt\r\nvery tired, so tired indeed, that she had been very glad when Bunting\r\ngood-naturedly suggested that he should go out and do their little bit\r\nof marketing.\r\n\r\nThe worthy couple had very soon discovered that in the matter of\r\ncatering it was not altogether an easy matter to satisfy Mr. Sleuth,\r\nand that though he always tried to appear pleased. This perfect lodger\r\nhad one serious fault from the point of view of those who keep\r\nlodgings. Strange to say, he was a vegetarian. He would not eat meat in\r\nany form. He sometimes, however, condescended to a chicken, and when he\r\ndid so condescend he generously intimated that Mr. and Mrs. Bunting\r\nwere welcome to a share in it.\r\n\r\nNow to-day\xe2\x80\x94this day of which the happenings were to linger in Mrs.\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s mind so very long, and to remain so very vivid, it had been\r\narranged that Mr. Sleuth was to have some fish for his lunch, while\r\nwhat he left was to be \xe2\x80\x9cdone up\xe2\x80\x9d to serve for his simple supper.\r\n\r\nKnowing that Bunting would be out for at least an hour, for he was a\r\ngregarious soul, and liked to have a gossip in the shops he frequented,\r\nMrs. Bunting rose and dressed in a leisurely manner; then she went and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid\xe2\x80\x9d her front sitting-room.\r\n\r\nShe felt languid and dull, as one is apt to feel after a broken night,\r\nand it was a comfort to her to know that Mr. Sleuth was not likely to\r\nring before twelve.\r\n\r\nBut long before twelve a loud ring suddenly clanged through the quiet\r\nhouse. She knew it for the front door bell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting frowned. No doubt the ring betokened one of those tiresome\r\npeople who come round for old bottles and such-like fal-lals.\r\n\r\nShe went slowly, reluctantly to the door. And then her face cleared,\r\nfor it was that good young chap, Joe Chandler, who stood waiting\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nHe was breathing a little hard, as if he had walked over-quickly\r\nthrough the moist, foggy air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in\xe2\x80\x94do! Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s out,\r\nbut he won\xe2\x80\x99t be very long now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite a stranger these last\r\nfew days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him for a moment, wondering what he could mean. Then,\r\nsuddenly she remembered. Why, of course, Joe was on a big job just\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94the job of trying to catch The Avenger! Her husband had alluded to\r\nthe fact again and again when reading out to her little bits from the\r\nhalfpenny evening paper he was taking again.\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the sitting-room. It was a good thing Bunting had\r\ninsisted on lighting the fire before he went out, for now the room was\r\nnice and warm\xe2\x80\x94and it was just horrible outside. She had felt a chill go\r\nright through her as she had stood, even for that second, at the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAnd she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been alone to feel it, for, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, it is jolly to be in\r\nhere, out of that awful cold!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Chandler, sitting down heavily\r\nin Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s easy chair.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting bethought herself that the young man was tired,\r\nas well as cold. He was pale, almost pallid under his usual healthy,\r\ntanned complexion\xe2\x80\x94the complexion of the man who lives much out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like me just to make you a cup of tea?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nsolicitously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell truth, I should be right down thankful for one, Mrs.\r\nBunting!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he looked round, and again he said her name, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in so odd, so thick a tone that she turned quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, what\r\nis it, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. And then, in sudden terror, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never come\r\nto tell me that anything\xe2\x80\x99s happened to Bunting? He\xe2\x80\x99s not had an\r\naccident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, no! Whatever made you think that? But\xe2\x80\x94but, Mrs. Bunting,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s been another of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice dropped almost to a whisper. He was staring at her with\r\nunhappy, it seemed to her terror-filled, eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother of them?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, bewildered\xe2\x80\x94at a loss. And then\r\nwhat he meant flashed across her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9canother of them\xe2\x80\x9d meant another of\r\nthese strange, mysterious, awful murders.\r\n\r\nBut her relief for the moment was so great\xe2\x80\x94for she really had thought\r\nfor a second that he had come to give her ill news of Bunting\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nfeeling that she did experience on hearing this piece of news was\r\nactually pleasurable, though she would have been much shocked had that\r\nfact been brought to her notice.\r\n\r\nAlmost in spite of herself, Mrs. Bunting had become keenly interested\r\nin the amazing series of crimes which was occupying the imagination of\r\nthe whole of London\xe2\x80\x99s nether-world. Even her refined mind had busied\r\nitself for the last two or three days with the strange problem so\r\nfrequently presented to it by Bunting\xe2\x80\x94for Bunting, now that they were\r\nno longer worried, took an open, unashamed, intense interest in \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x9d and his doings.\r\n\r\nShe took the kettle off the gas-ring. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity Bunting isn\xe2\x80\x99t here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, drawing in her breath. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d a-liked so much to hear you tell\r\nall about it, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she was pouring boiling water into a little teapot.\r\n\r\nBut Chandler said nothing, and she turned and glanced at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\r\ndo look bad!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the young fellow did look bad\xe2\x80\x94very bad indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a kind of gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was your saying\r\nthat about my telling you all about it that made me turn queer. You\r\nsee, this time I was one of the first there, and it fairly turned me\r\nsick\xe2\x80\x94that it did. Oh, it was too awful, Mrs. Bunting! Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began gulping down the hot tea before it was well made.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with sympathetic interest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever would have thought, with all the horrible sights you see, that\r\nanything could upset you like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t like anything there\xe2\x80\x99s ever been before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94oh, Mrs. Bunting, \xe2\x80\x99twas I that discovered the piece of paper\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it _is_ true,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s bit of\r\npaper! Bunting always said it was. He never believed in that practical\r\njoker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, there are some queer\r\nfellows even\xe2\x80\x94even\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he lowered his voice, and looked round him as if\r\nthe walls had ears)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceven in the Force, Mrs. Bunting, and these murders\r\nhave fair got on our nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think that a Bobby might do a thing like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded impatiently, as if the question wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth answering. Then,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all along of that bit of paper and my finding it while the poor\r\nsoul was still warm,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he shuddered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat brought me out West this\r\nmorning. One of our bosses lives close by, in Prince Albert Terrace,\r\nand I had to go and tell him all about it. They never offered me a bit\r\nor a sup\xe2\x80\x94I think they might have done that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said absently. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, there, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ought to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Chandler.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had me up in his dressing-room, and was very considerate-like to me\r\nwhile I was telling him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a bit of something now?\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if\r\nI could ever eat anything any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll only make you ill.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting spoke rather crossly, for she\r\nwas a sensible woman. And to please her he took a bite out of the slice\r\nof bread-and-butter she had cut for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve a goodish heavy day in\r\nfront of me. Been up since four, too\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it then they found\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated a moment, and\r\nthen said, \xe2\x80\x9cit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just a chance I was near by. If I\xe2\x80\x99d been half a\r\nminute sooner either I or the officer who found her must have knocked\r\nup against that\xe2\x80\x94that monster. But two or three people do think they saw\r\nhim slinking away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he like?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to answer. You see, there was such an awful fog. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing they all agree about. He was carrying a bag\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bag?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever sort of bag\r\nmight it have been, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere had come across her\xe2\x80\x94just right in her middle, like\xe2\x80\x94such a strange\r\nsensation, a curious kind of tremor, or fluttering.\r\n\r\nShe was at a loss to account for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a hand-bag,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Chandler vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman I spoke\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94cross-examining her, like\xe2\x80\x94who was positive she had seen him, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just a tall, thin shadow\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was, a tall, thin shadow of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94with a bag.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a bag?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting absently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow very strange and\r\npeculiar\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no, not strange at all. He has to carry the thing he does the\r\ndeed with in something, Mrs. Bunting. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always wondered how he hid\r\nit. They generally throws the knife or fire-arms away, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting still spoke in that absent, wondering\r\nway. She was thinking that she really must try and see what the lodger\r\nhad done with his bag. It was possible\xe2\x80\x94in fact, when one came to think\r\nof it, it was very probable\xe2\x80\x94that he had just lost it, being so\r\nforgetful a gentleman, on one of the days he had gone out, as she knew\r\nhe was fond of doing, into the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a description circulated in an hour or two,\xe2\x80\x9d went on\r\nChandler. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99ll help catch him. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a London man or\r\nwoman, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a good bit to lay that chap\r\nby the heels. Well, I suppose I must be going now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you wait a bit longer for Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d she said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in, maybe, either this evening or\r\nto-morrow, and tell you any more that\xe2\x80\x99s happened. Thanks kindly for the\r\ntea. It\xe2\x80\x99s made a man of me, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough to unman you, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Bunting did come in, and he and his wife had quite\r\na little tiff\xe2\x80\x94the first tiff they had had since Mr. Sleuth became their\r\nlodger.\r\n\r\nIt fell out this way. When he heard who had been there, Bunting was\r\nangry that Mrs. Bunting hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got more details of the horrible\r\noccurrence which had taken place that morning, out of Chandler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, Ellen, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t even tell me where it\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d he said indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you put Chandler off\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you did! Why, whatever did he come here for, excepting to tell us\r\nall about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to have something to eat and drink,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped out Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what the poor lad came for, if you wants to know. He could\r\nhardly speak of it at all\xe2\x80\x94he felt so bad. In fact, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word\r\nabout it until he\xe2\x80\x99d come right into the room and sat down. He told me\r\nquite enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell you if the piece of paper on which the murderer had\r\nwritten his name was square or three-cornered?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he did not. And that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of thing I should have cared\r\nto ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more fool you!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he stopped abruptly. The newsboys were\r\ncoming down the Marylebone Road, shouting out the awful discovery which\r\nhad been made that morning\xe2\x80\x94that of The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s fifth murder. Bunting\r\nwent out to buy a paper, and his wife took the things he had brought in\r\ndown to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe noise the newspaper-sellers made outside had evidently wakened Mr.\r\nSleuth, for his landlady hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in the kitchen ten minutes before\r\nhis bell rang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang again.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast was quite ready, but for the first time since he\r\nhad been her lodger Mrs. Bunting did not answer the summons at once.\r\nBut when there came the second imperative tinkle\xe2\x80\x94for electric bells had\r\nnot been fitted into that old-fashioned house\xe2\x80\x94she made up her mind to\r\ngo upstairs.\r\n\r\nAs she emerged into the hall from the kitchen stairway, Bunting,\r\nsitting comfortably in their parlour, heard his wife stepping heavily\r\nunder the load of the well-laden tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d and he came out\r\nand took the tray from her.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, and together they proceeded up to the drawing-room\r\nfloor landing.\r\n\r\nThere she stopped him. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou give me\r\nthat, Bunting. The lodger won\xe2\x80\x99t like your going in to him.\xe2\x80\x9d And then,\r\nas he obeyed her, and was about to turn downstairs again, she added in\r\na rather acid tone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou might open the door for me, at any rate! How\r\ncan I manage to do it with this here heavy tray on my hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a queer, jerky way, and Bunting felt surprised\xe2\x80\x94rather put\r\nout. Ellen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99d call a lively, jolly woman, but\r\nwhen things were going well\xe2\x80\x94as now\xe2\x80\x94she was generally equable enough. He\r\nsupposed she was still resentful of the way he had spoken to her about\r\nyoung Chandler and the new Avenger murder.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was always for peace, so he opened the drawing-room door,\r\nand as soon as he had started going downstairs Mrs. Bunting walked into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAnd then at once there came over her the queerest feeling of relief, of\r\nlightness of heart.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the lodger was sitting at his old place, reading the Bible.\r\n\r\nSomehow\xe2\x80\x94she could not have told you why, she would not willingly have\r\ntold herself\xe2\x80\x94she had expected to see Mr. Sleuth _looking different_.\r\nBut no, he appeared to be exactly the same\xe2\x80\x94in fact, as he glanced up at\r\nher a pleasanter smile than usual lighted up his thin, pallid face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said genially, \xe2\x80\x9cI overslept myself this\r\nmorning, but I feel all the better for the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad of that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the\r\nladies I once lived with used to say, \xe2\x80\x98Rest is an old-fashioned remedy,\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s the best remedy of all.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth himself removed the Bible and Cruden\xe2\x80\x99s Concordance off the\r\ntable out of her way, and then he stood watching his landlady laying\r\nthe cloth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he spoke again. He was not often so talkative in the morning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Mrs. Bunting, that there was someone with you outside the\r\ndoor just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. Bunting helped me up with the tray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I give you a good deal of trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nBut she answered quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir! Not at all, sir! I was only\r\nsaying yesterday that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a lodger that gave us as little\r\ntrouble as you do, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad of that. I am aware that my habits are somewhat peculiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her fixedly, as if expecting her to give some sort of\r\ndenial to this observation. But Mrs. Bunting was an honest and truthful\r\nwoman. It never occurred to her to question his statement. Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhabits were somewhat peculiar. Take that going out at night, or rather\r\nin the early morning, for instance? So she remained silent.\r\n\r\nAfter she had laid the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast on the table she prepared to\r\nleave the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m not to do your room till you goes out,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sleuth looked up sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never want my\r\nroom done when I am engaged in studying the Scriptures, Mrs. Bunting.\r\nBut I am not going out to-day. I shall be carrying out a somewhat\r\nelaborate experiment\xe2\x80\x94upstairs. If I go out at all\xe2\x80\x9d he waited a moment,\r\nand again he looked at her fixedly \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94I shall wait till night-time to do\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, coming back to the matter in hand, he added hastily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you could do my room when I go upstairs, about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthat time is convenient to you, that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir! That\xe2\x80\x99ll do nicely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting went downstairs, and as she did so she took herself\r\nwordlessly, ruthlessly to task, but she did not face\xe2\x80\x94even in her inmost\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94the strange tenors and tremors which had so shaken her. She only\r\nrepeated to herself again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got upset\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone,\xe2\x80\x9d and then she spoke aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI must get myself a dose at the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s next time I\xe2\x80\x99m out. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I must do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just as she murmured the word \xe2\x80\x9cdo,\xe2\x80\x9d there came a loud double knock\r\non the front door.\r\n\r\nIt was only the postman\xe2\x80\x99s knock, but the postman was an unfamiliar\r\nvisitor in that house, and Mrs. Bunting started violently. She was\r\nnervous, that\xe2\x80\x99s what was the matter with her,\xe2\x80\x94so she told herself\r\nangrily. No doubt this was a letter for Mr. Sleuth; the lodger must\r\nhave relations and acquaintances somewhere in the world. All gentlefolk\r\nhave. But when she picked the small envelope off the hall floor, she\r\nsaw it was a letter from Daisy, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunting!\xe2\x80\x9d she called out sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of their sitting-room and looked in. Yes, there was\r\nher husband, sitting back comfortably in his easy chair, reading a\r\npaper. And as she saw his broad, rather rounded back, Mrs. Bunting felt\r\na sudden thrill of sharp irritation. There he was, doing nothing\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, doing worse than nothing\xe2\x80\x94wasting his time reading all about those\r\nhorrid crimes.\r\n\r\nShe sighed\xe2\x80\x94a long, unconscious sigh. Bunting was getting into idle\r\nways, bad ways for a man of his years. But how could she prevent it? He\r\nhad been such an active, conscientious sort of man when they had first\r\nmade acquaintance. . .\r\n\r\nShe also could remember, even more clearly than Bunting did himself,\r\nthat first meeting of theirs in the dining-room of No. 90 Cumberland\r\nTerrace. As she had stood there, pouring out her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s glass of\r\nport wine, she had not been too much absorbed in her task to have a\r\ngood out-of-her-eye look at the spruce, nice, respectable-looking\r\nfellow who was standing over by the window. How superior he had\r\nappeared even then to the man she already hoped he would succeed as\r\nbutler!\r\n\r\nTo-day, perhaps because she was not feeling quite herself, the past\r\nrose before her very vividly, and a lump came into her throat.\r\n\r\nPutting the letter addressed to her husband on the table, she closed\r\nthe door softly, and went down into the kitchen; there were various\r\nlittle things to put away and clean up, as well as their dinner to\r\ncook. And all the time she was down there she fixed her mind\r\nobstinately, determinedly on Bunting and on the problem of Bunting. She\r\nwondered what she\xe2\x80\x99d better do to get him into good ways again.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Sleuth, their outlook was now moderately bright. A week\r\nago everything had seemed utterly hopeless. It seemed as if nothing\r\ncould save them from disaster. But everything was now changed!\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be well for her to go and see the new proprietor of\r\nthat registry office, in Baker Street, which had lately changed hands.\r\nIt would be a good thing for Bunting to get even an occasional job\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe matter of that he could now take up a fairly regular thing in the\r\nway of waiting. Mrs. Bunting knew that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to get a man out\r\nof idle ways once he has acquired those ways.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, she went upstairs again she felt a little ashamed of\r\nwhat she had been thinking, for Bunting had laid the cloth, and laid it\r\nvery nicely, too, and brought up the two chairs to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s news! Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-morrow!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s scarlet fever in their house. Old Aunt thinks she\xe2\x80\x99d better come\r\naway for a few days. So, you see, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for her birthday.\r\nEighteen, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she be on the nineteenth! It do make me feel\r\nold\xe2\x80\x94that it do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting put down the tray. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have the girl here just now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just as much to do as I can manage. The lodger\r\ngives me more trouble than you seem to think for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you with the lodger. It\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nown fault you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had help with him before. Of course, Daisy must\r\ncome here. Whatever other place could the girl go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting felt pugnacious\xe2\x80\x94so cheerful as to be almost light-hearted. But\r\nas he looked across at his wife his feeling of satisfaction vanished.\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s face was pinched and drawn to-day; she looked ill\xe2\x80\x94ill and\r\nhorribly tired. It was very aggravating of her to go and behave like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94just when they were beginning to get on nicely again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the matter of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to help\r\nyou with the work, Ellen, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll brisk us both up a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting made no answer. She sat down heavily at the table. And\r\nthen she said languidly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well show me the girl\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed it across to her, and she read it slowly to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR FATHER (it ran)\xe2\x80\x94I hope this finds you as well at it leaves me.\r\nMrs. Puddle\xe2\x80\x99s youngest has got scarlet fever, and Aunt thinks I had\r\nbetter come away at once, just to stay with you for a few days. Please\r\ntell Ellen I won\xe2\x80\x99t give her no trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start at ten if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear nothing.\xe2\x80\x94Your loving daughter,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDAISY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose Daisy will have to come here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting slowly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do her good to have a bit of work to do for once in her life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with that ungraciously worded permission Bunting had to content\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nQuietly the rest of that eventful day sped by. When dusk fell Mr.\r\nSleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady heard him go upstairs to the top floor. She\r\nremembered that this was the signal for her to go and do his room.\r\n\r\nHe was a tidy man, was the lodger; he did not throw his things about as\r\nso many gentlemen do, leaving them all over the place. No, he kept\r\neverything scrupulously tidy. His clothes, and the various articles\r\nMrs. Bunting had bought for him during the first two days he had been\r\nthere, were carefully arranged in the chest of drawers. He had lately\r\npurchased a pair of boots. Those he had arrived in were\r\npeculiar-looking footgear, buff leather shoes with rubber soles, and he\r\nhad told his landlady on that very first day that he never wished them\r\nto go down to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nA funny idea\xe2\x80\x94a funny habit that, of going out for a walk after midnight\r\nin weather so cold and foggy that all other folk were glad to be at\r\nhome, snug in bed. But then Mr. Sleuth himself admitted that he was a\r\nfunny sort of gentleman.\r\n\r\nAfter she had done his bedroom the landlady went into the sitting-room\r\nand gave it a good dusting. This room was not kept quite as nice as she\r\nwould have liked it to be. Mrs. Bunting longed to give the drawing-room\r\nsomething of a good turn out; but Mr. Sleuth disliked her to be moving\r\nabout in it when he himself was in his bedroom; and when up he sat\r\nthere almost all the time. Delighted as he had seemed to be with the\r\ntop room, he only used it when making his mysterious experiments, and\r\nnever during the day-time.\r\n\r\nAnd now, this afternoon, she looked at the rosewood chiffonnier with\r\nlonging eyes\xe2\x80\x94she even gave that pretty little piece of furniture a\r\nslight shake. If only the doors would fly open, as the locked doors of\r\nold cupboards sometimes do, even after they have been securely\r\nfastened, how pleased she would be, how much more comfortable somehow\r\nshe would feel!\r\n\r\nBut the chiffonnier refused to give up its secret.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock on that same evening Joe Chandler came in, just for\r\na few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 chat. He had recovered from his agitation of the\r\nmorning, but he was full of eager excitement, and Mrs. Bunting listened\r\nin silence, intensely interested in spite of herself, while he and\r\nBunting talked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as right as a trivet now! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good\r\nrest\xe2\x80\x94laid down all this afternoon. You see, the Yard thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to be something on to-night. He\xe2\x80\x99s always done them in pairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he has,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bunting wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he has! Now, I never\r\nthought o\xe2\x80\x99 that. Then you think, Joe, that the monster\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the job\r\nagain to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good chance of his\r\nbeing caught too\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a lot on the watch to-night, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think there will be! How many of our men d\xe2\x80\x99you think there\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe on night duty to-night, Mr. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean extra,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Chandler, in an encouraging voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand?\xe2\x80\x9d ventured Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive thousand, Mr. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bunting, amazed.\r\n\r\nAnd even Mrs. Bunting echoed \xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that there will. You see, the Boss has got his monkey up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nChandler drew a folded-up newspaper out of his coat pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nlisten to this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The police have reluctantly to admit that they have no clue to the\r\nperpetrators of these horrible crimes, and we cannot feel any surprise\r\nat the information that a popular attack has been organised on the\r\nChief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. There is even talk of an\r\nindignation mass meeting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you think of that? That\xe2\x80\x99s not a pleasant thing for a gentleman\r\nas is doing his best to read, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it does seem queer that the police can\xe2\x80\x99t catch him, now doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting argumentatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s queer at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Chandler crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nyou just listen again! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of the truth for once\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nnewspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d And slowly he read out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The detection of crime in London now resembles a game of blind man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuff, in which the detective has his hands tied and his eyes bandaged.\r\nThus is he turned loose to hunt the murderer through the slums of a\r\ngreat city.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cYour hands aren\xe2\x80\x99t tied, and\r\nyour eyes aren\xe2\x80\x99t bandaged, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s metaphorical-like that it\xe2\x80\x99s intended, Mr. Bunting. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nthe same facilities\xe2\x80\x94no, not a quarter of them\xe2\x80\x94that the French \xe2\x80\x99tecs\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, for the first time, Mrs. Bunting spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that word,\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98perpetrators\xe2\x80\x99? I mean that first bit you read out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to her eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do they think there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one of them?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and a\r\nlook of relief came over her thin face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some of our chaps thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a gang,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nsay it can\xe2\x80\x99t be the work of one man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ think, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Bunting, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think. I\xe2\x80\x99m fair puzzled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you come to the door. I\xe2\x80\x99ll shut it all right. So\r\nlong! See you to-morrow, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d As he had done the other evening,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s visitor stopped at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAny news of Miss\r\nDaisy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked casually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got scarlet\r\nfever at her place. So Old Aunt thinks she\xe2\x80\x99d better clear out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband and wife went to bed early that night, but Mrs. Bunting\r\nfound she could not sleep. She lay wide awake, hearing the hours, the\r\nhalf-hours, the quarters chime out from the belfry of the old church\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as she was dozing off\xe2\x80\x94it must have been about one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94she heard the sound she had half unconsciously been expecting\r\nto hear, that of the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s stealthy footsteps coming down the stairs\r\njust outside her room.\r\n\r\nHe crept along the passage and let himself out very, very quietly.\r\n\r\nBut though she tried to keep awake, Mrs. Bunting did not hear him come\r\nin again, for she soon fell into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, she was the first to wake the next morning; odder still,\r\nit was she, not Bunting, who jumped out of bed, and going out into the\r\npassage, picked up the newspaper which had just been pushed through the\r\nletter-box.\r\n\r\nBut having picked it up, Mrs. Bunting did not go back at once into her\r\nbedroom. Instead she lit the gas in the passage, and leaning up against\r\nthe wall to steady herself, for she was trembling with cold and\r\nfatigue, she opened the paper.\r\n\r\nYes, there was the heading she sought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE AVENGER MURDERS\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, oh, how glad she was to see the words that followed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp to the time of going to press there is little new to report\r\nconcerning the extraordinary series of crimes which are amazing, and,\r\nindeed, staggering not only London, but the whole civilised world, and\r\nwhich would seem to be the work of some woman-hating teetotal fanatic.\r\nSince yesterday morning, when the last of these dastardly murders was\r\ncommitted, no reliable clue to the perpetrator, or perpetrators, has\r\nbeen obtained, though several arrests were made in the course of the\r\nday. In every case, however, those arrested were able to prove a\r\nsatisfactory alibi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, a little lower down:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe excitement grows and grows. It is not too much to say that even a\r\nstranger to London would know that something very unusual was in the\r\nair. As for the place where the murder was committed last night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Bunting, startled; and then she realised\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9clast night,\xe2\x80\x9d in this connection, meant the night before last.\r\n\r\nShe began the sentence again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the place where the murder was committed last night, all\r\napproaches to it were still blocked up to a late hour by hundreds of\r\nonlookers, though, of course, nothing now remains in the way of traces\r\nof the tragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly and carefully Mrs. Bunting folded the paper up again in its\r\noriginal creases, and then she stooped and put it back down on the mat\r\nwhere she had found it. She then turned out the gas, and going back\r\ninto bed she lay down by her still sleeping husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting murmured, and stirred uneasily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything the matter, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered in a whisper, a whisper thrilling with a strange gladness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing, Bunting\xe2\x80\x94nothing the matter! Go to sleep again, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got up an hour later, both in a happy, cheerful mood. Bunting\r\nrejoiced at the thought of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s coming, and even Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstepmother told herself that it would be pleasant having the girl about\r\nthe house to help her a bit.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Bunting went out to do some shopping. He brought back\r\nwith him a nice little bit of pork for Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, and three\r\nmince-pies. He even remembered to get some apples for the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as twelve was striking a four-wheeler drew up to the gate.\r\n\r\nIt brought Daisy\xe2\x80\x94pink-cheeked, excited, laughing-eyed Daisy\xe2\x80\x94a sight to\r\ngladden any father\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Aunt said I was to have a cab if the weather was bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\nout joyously.\r\n\r\nThere was a bit of a wrangle over the fare. King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross, as all the\r\nworld knows, is nothing like two miles from the Marylebone Road, but\r\nthe man clamoured for one and sixpence, and hinted darkly that he had\r\ndone the young lady a favour in bringing her at all.\r\n\r\nWhile he and Bunting were having words, Daisy, leaving them to it,\r\nwalked up the flagged path to the door where her stepmother was\r\nawaiting her.\r\n\r\nAs they were exchanging a rather frigid kiss, indeed, \xe2\x80\x99twas a mere peck\r\non Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s part, there fell, with startling suddenness, loud\r\ncries on the still, cold air. Long-drawn and wailing, they sounded\r\nstrangely sad as they rose and fell across the distant roar of traffic\r\nin the Edgware Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bunting wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whatever\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cabman lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99a-crying out that \xe2\x80\x99orrible\r\naffair at King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross. He\xe2\x80\x99s done for two of \xe2\x80\x99em this time! That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI meant when I said I might \xe2\x80\x99a got a better fare. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nnothink before little missy there, but folk \xe2\x80\x99ave been coming from all\r\nover London the last five or six hours; plenty of toffs, too\xe2\x80\x94but there,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to see now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Another woman murdered last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting felt tremendously thrilled. What had the five thousand\r\nconstables been about to let such a dreadful thing happen?\r\n\r\nThe cabman stared at him, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo of \xe2\x80\x99em, I tell yer\xe2\x80\x94within a\r\nfew yards of one another. He \xe2\x80\x99ave\xe2\x80\x94got a nerve\xe2\x80\x94But, of course, they was\r\ndrunk. He are got a down on the drink!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they caught him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting perfunctorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, no! They\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch \xe2\x80\x99im! It must \xe2\x80\x99ave happened hours and\r\nhours ago\xe2\x80\x94they was both stone cold. One each end of a little passage\r\nwhat ain\xe2\x80\x99t used no more. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find \xe2\x80\x99em before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hoarse cries were coming nearer and nearer\xe2\x80\x94two news vendors trying\r\nto outshout each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Orrible discovery near King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross!\xe2\x80\x9d they yelled exultingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nAvenger again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting, with his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s large straw hold-all in his hand, ran\r\nforward into the roadway and recklessly gave a boy a penny for a\r\nhalfpenny paper.\r\n\r\nHe felt very much moved and excited. Somehow his acquaintance with\r\nyoung Joe Chandler made these murders seem a personal affair. He hoped\r\nthat Chandler would come in soon and tell them all about it, as he had\r\ndone yesterday morning when he, Bunting, had unluckily been out.\r\n\r\nAs he walked back into the little hall, he heard Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s voice\xe2\x80\x94high,\r\nvoluble, excited\xe2\x80\x94giving her stepmother a long account of the scarlet\r\nfever case, and how at first Old Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s neighbours had thought it was\r\nnot scarlet fever at all, but just nettlerash.\r\n\r\nBut as Bunting pushed open the door of the sitting-room, there came a\r\nnote of sharp alarm in his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and he heard her cry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen, whatever is the matter? You _do_ look bad!\xe2\x80\x9d and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuffled answer, \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the window\xe2\x80\x94do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Orrible discovery near King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross\xe2\x80\x94a clue at last!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the\r\nnewspaper-boys triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAnd then, helplessly, Mrs. Bunting began to laugh. She laughed, and\r\nlaughed, and laughed, rocking herself to and fro as if in an ecstasy of\r\nmirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, father, whatever\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy looked quite scared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s in \xe2\x80\x99sterics\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just get\r\nthe water-jug. Wait a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting felt very put out. Ellen was ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what she was, to\r\nbe so easily upset.\r\n\r\nThe lodger\xe2\x80\x99s bell suddenly pealed through the quiet house. Either that\r\nsound, or maybe the threat of the water-jug, had a magical effect on\r\nMrs. Bunting. She rose to her feet, still shaking all over, but\r\nmentally composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little chokingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for you, child, just run\r\ndown into the kitchen. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find a piece of pork roasting in the\r\noven. You might start paring the apples for the sauce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bunting went upstairs her legs felt as if they were made of\r\ncotton wool. She put out a trembling hand, and clutched at the banister\r\nfor support. But soon, making a great effort over herself, she began to\r\nfeel more steady; and after waiting for a few moments on the landing,\r\nshe knocked at the door of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s voice answered her from the bedroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not well,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled out querulously; \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught a chill. I should be\r\nobliged if you would kindly bring me up a cup of tea, and put it\r\noutside my door, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting turned and went downstairs. She still felt queer and\r\ngiddy, so instead of going into the kitchen, she made the lodger his\r\ncup of tea over her sitting-room gas-ring.\r\n\r\nDuring their midday dinner the husband and wife had a little discussion\r\nas to where Daisy should sleep. It had been settled that a bed should\r\nbe made up for her in the top back room, but Mrs. Bunting saw reason to\r\nchange this plan. \xe2\x80\x9cI think \xe2\x80\x99twould be better if Daisy were to sleep\r\nwith me, Bunting, and you was to sleep upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting felt and looked rather surprised, but he acquiesced. Ellen was\r\nprobably right; the girl would be rather lonely up there, and, after\r\nall, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the lodger, though he seemed a\r\nrespectable gentleman enough.\r\n\r\nDaisy was a good-natured girl; she liked London, and wanted to make\r\nherself useful to her stepmother. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wash up; don\xe2\x80\x99t you bother to\r\ncome downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nBunting began to walk up and down the room. His wife gave him a furtive\r\nglance; she wondered what he was thinking about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you get a paper?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve put it away. I\r\nthought you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not look at it, as you\xe2\x80\x99re that nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she glanced at him quickly, furtively, but he seemed just as\r\nusual\xe2\x80\x94he evidently meant just what he said and no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they was shouting something in the street\xe2\x80\x94I mean just before\r\nI was took bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s turn to stare at his wife quickly and rather\r\nfurtively. He had felt sure that her sudden attack of queerness, of\r\nhysterics\xe2\x80\x94call it what you might\xe2\x80\x94had been due to the shouting outside.\r\nShe was not the only woman in London who had got the Avenger murders on\r\nher nerves. His morning paper said quite a lot of women were afraid to\r\ngo out alone. Was it possible that the curious way she had been taken\r\njust now had had nothing to do with the shouts and excitement outside?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know what it was they were calling out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked slowly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked across at him. She would have given a very great\r\ndeal to be able to lie, to pretend that she did not know what those\r\ndreadful cries had portended. But when it came to the point she found\r\nshe could not do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said dully. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard a word here and there. There\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nanother murder, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo other murders,\xe2\x80\x9d he said soberly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo? That\xe2\x80\x99s worse news!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned so pale\xe2\x80\x94a sallow\r\ngreenish-white\xe2\x80\x94that Bunting thought she was again going queer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said warningly, \xe2\x80\x9cEllen, now do have a care! I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s come over you about these murders. Turn your mind away from\r\nthem, do! We needn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about them\xe2\x80\x94not so much, that is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wants to talk about them,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bunting hysterically.\r\n\r\nThe husband and wife were standing, one each side of the table, the man\r\nwith his back to the fire, the woman with her back to the door.\r\n\r\nBunting, staring across at his wife, felt sadly perplexed and\r\ndisturbed. She really did seem ill; even her slight, spare figure\r\nlooked shrunk. For the first time, so he told himself ruefully, Ellen\r\nwas beginning to look her full age. Her slender hands\xe2\x80\x94she had kept the\r\npretty, soft white hands of the woman who has never done rough\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94grasped the edge of the table with a convulsive movement.\r\n\r\nBunting didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all like the look of her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cI do hope Ellen isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be ill! That would be a to-do\r\njust now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwaiting to hear? Be quick now, Bunting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t very much to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s precious\r\nlittle in this paper, anyway. But the cabman what brought Daisy told\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I said just now. There\xe2\x80\x99s two of \xe2\x80\x99em this time, and they\xe2\x80\x99d both\r\nbeen drinking heavily, poor creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it where the others was done?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked looking at her husband\r\nfearfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Ellen. It was a good bit\r\nfarther West\xe2\x80\x94in fact, not so very far from here. Near King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCross\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how the cabman knew about it, you see. They seems to have\r\nbeen done in a passage which isn\xe2\x80\x99t used no more.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, as he\r\nthought his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were beginning to look rather funny, he added\r\nhastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for the present! We shall soon be\r\nhearing a lot more about it from Joe Chandler. He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sure to come\r\nin some time to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the five thousand constables weren\xe2\x80\x99t no use?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nShe had relaxed her grip of the table, and was standing more upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is artful and no mistake\r\nabout it. But wait a minute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he turned and took up the paper which he\r\nhad laid aside, on a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cYes they says here that they has a clue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clue, Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting spoke in a soft, weak, die-away voice,\r\nand again, stooping somewhat, she grasped the edge of the table.\r\n\r\nBut her husband was not noticing her now. He was holding the paper\r\nclose up to his eyes, and he read from it, in a tone of considerable\r\nsatisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is gratifying to be able to state that the police at last believe\r\nthey are in possession of a clue which will lead to the arrest of\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand then Bunting dropped the paper and rushed round the table.\r\n\r\nHis wife, with a curious sighing moan, had slipped down on to the\r\nfloor, taking with her the tablecloth as she went. She lay there in\r\nwhat appeared to be a dead faint. And Bunting, scared out of his wits,\r\nopened the door and screamed out, \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy! Daisy! Come up, child.\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s took bad again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Daisy, hurrying in, showed an amount of sense and resource which\r\neven at this anxious moment roused her fond father\xe2\x80\x99s admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a wet sponge, Dad\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9ca sponge,\xe2\x80\x94and, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsuch a thing, a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 brandy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see after her!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, after he\r\nhad got the little medicine flask, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with\r\nEllen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed quite all right when I\r\nfirst came in. She was listening, interested-like, to what I was\r\ntelling her, and then, suddenly\xe2\x80\x94well, you saw how she was took, father?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t like Ellen this, is it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t. But you see, child, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been going\r\nthrough a pretty bad time\xe2\x80\x94worse nor I should ever have let you know of,\r\nmy dear. Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s just feeling it now\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nnothing, for Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s a good plucked one, but it\xe2\x80\x99s told on her\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s told\r\non her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting, sitting up, slowly opened her eyes, and\r\ninstinctively put her hand up to her head to see if her hair was all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really been quite \xe2\x80\x9coff.\xe2\x80\x9d It would have been better for her\r\nif she had. She had simply had an awful feeling that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94more, that she must fall down. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s words touched a most\r\nunwonted chord in the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and the eyes which she opened\r\nwere full of tears. She had not thought her husband knew how she had\r\nsuffered during those weeks of starving and waiting.\r\n\r\nBut she had a morbid dislike of any betrayal of sentiment. To her such\r\nbetrayal betokened \xe2\x80\x9cfoolishness,\xe2\x80\x9d and so all she said was, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nneed to make a fuss! I only turned over a little queer. I never was\r\nright off, Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPettishly she pushed away the glass in which Bunting had hurriedly\r\npoured a little brandy. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch such stuff\xe2\x80\x94no, not if I was\r\ndying!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nPutting out a languid hand, she pulled herself up, with the help of the\r\ntable, on to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cGo down again to the kitchen, child\xe2\x80\x9d; but there\r\nwas a sob, a kind of tremor in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been eating properly, Ellen\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I come to think of it, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neat half enough these last two days. I always did say\xe2\x80\x94in old days many\r\na time I telled you\xe2\x80\x94that a woman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live on air. But there, you\r\nnever believed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy stood looking from one to the other, a shadow over her bright,\r\npretty face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no idea you\xe2\x80\x99d had such a bad time, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nfeelingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me know about it? I might have got\r\nsomething out of Old Aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said her stepmother hastily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course\xe2\x80\x94well, I expect I\xe2\x80\x99m still feeling the worry now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem able to forget it. Those days of waiting, of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she restrained\r\nherself; another moment and the word \xe2\x80\x9cstarving\xe2\x80\x9d would have left her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut everything\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9call right,\r\nthanks to Mr. Sleuth, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated his wife, in a low, strange tone of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall right now, and as you say, Bunting, it\xe2\x80\x99s all along of Mr. Sleuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked across to a chair and sat down on it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just a little\r\ntottery still,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered.\r\n\r\nAnd Daisy, looking at her, turned to her father and said in a whisper,\r\nbut not so low but that Mrs. Bunting heard her, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think Ellen\r\nought to see a doctor, father? He might give her something that would\r\npull her round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t see no doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting with sudden emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw\r\nenough of doctors in my last place. Thirty-eight doctors in ten months\r\ndid my poor missis have. Just determined on having \xe2\x80\x99em she was! Did\r\nthey save her? No! She died just the same! Maybe a bit sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a freak, was your last mistress, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d began Bunting\r\naggressively.\r\n\r\nEllen had insisted on staying on in that place till her poor mistress\r\ndied. They might have been married some months before they were married\r\nbut for that fact. Bunting had always resented it.\r\n\r\nHis wife smile wanly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t have no words about that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand again she spoke in a softer, kindlier tone than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy? If\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t go down to the kitchen again, then I must\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she turned to her\r\nstepdaughter, and the girl flew out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the child grows prettier every minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting fondly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolks are too apt to forget that beauty is but skin deep,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nwife. She was beginning to feel better. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still, I do agree,\r\nBunting, that Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s well enough. And she seems more willing, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting spoke uneasily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of fish to-day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better just tell Daisy\r\nto see to it, and then I can take it up to him, as you\xe2\x80\x99re not feeling\r\nquite the thing, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite well enough to take up Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s luncheon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nquickly. It irritated her to hear her husband speak of the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner. They had dinner in the middle of the day, but Mr. Sleuth had\r\nluncheon. However odd he might be, Mrs. Bunting never forgot her lodger\r\nwas a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, he likes me to wait on him, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he? I can manage all\r\nright. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry,\xe2\x80\x9d she added after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps because his luncheon was served to him a good deal later than\r\nusual, Mr. Sleuth ate his nice piece of steamed sole upstairs with far\r\nheartier an appetite than his landlady had eaten her nice slice of\r\nroast pork downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a little better, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting had forced\r\nherself to say when she first took in his tray.\r\n\r\nAnd he had answered plaintively, querulously, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I feel\r\nwell to-day, Mrs. Bunting. I am tired\xe2\x80\x94very tired. And as I lay in bed I\r\nseemed to hear so many sounds\xe2\x80\x94so much crying and shouting. I trust the\r\nMarylebone Road is not going to become a noisy thoroughfare, Mrs.\r\nBunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that. We\xe2\x80\x99re generally reckoned very quiet\r\nindeed, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment\xe2\x80\x94try as she would, she could not allude to what\r\nthose unwonted shouts and noises had betokened. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nchill, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was you, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go out this\r\nafternoon; I\xe2\x80\x99d just stay quietly indoors. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of rough people\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps there was an undercurrent of warning, of painful\r\npleading, in her toneless voice which penetrated in some way to the\r\nbrain of the lodger, for Mr. Sleuth looked up, and an uneasy, watchful\r\nlook came into his luminous grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that, Mrs. Bunting. But I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your\r\nadvice. That is, I will stay quietly at home, I am never at a loss to\r\nknow what to do with myself so long as I can study the Book of Books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid about your eyes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting\r\ncuriously. Somehow she was beginning to feel better. It comforted her\r\nto be up here, talking to Mr. Sleuth, instead of thinking about him\r\ndownstairs. It seemed to banish the terror which filled her soul\xe2\x80\x94aye,\r\nand her body, too\xe2\x80\x94at other times. When she was with him Mr. Sleuth was\r\nso gentle, so reasonable, so\xe2\x80\x94so grateful.\r\n\r\nPoor kindly, solitary Mr. Sleuth! This kind of gentleman surely\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a fly, let alone a human being. Eccentric\xe2\x80\x94so much must be\r\nadmitted. But Mrs. Bunting had seen a good deal of eccentric folk,\r\neccentric women rather than eccentric men, in her long career as useful\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\nBeing at ordinary times an exceptionally sensible, well-balanced woman,\r\nshe had never, in old days, allowed her mind to dwell on certain things\r\nshe had learnt as to the aberrations of which human nature is\r\ncapable\xe2\x80\x94even well-born, well-nurtured, gentle human nature\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nexemplified in some of the households where she had served. It would,\r\nindeed, be unfortunate if she now became morbid or\xe2\x80\x94or hysterical.\r\n\r\nSo it was in a sharp, cheerful voice, almost the voice in which she had\r\ntalked during the first few days of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s stay in her house,\r\nthat she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be up again to clear away in about\r\nhalf an hour. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me for saying so, I hope you will\r\nstay in and have a rest to-day. Nasty, muggy weather\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is!\r\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any little thing you want, me or Bunting can go out and get\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must have been about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock when there came a ring at the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\nThe three were sitting chatting together, for Daisy had washed up\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nreally was saving her stepmother a good bit of trouble\xe2\x80\x94and the girl was\r\nnow amusing her elders by a funny account of Old Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s pernickety\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too early for\r\nJoe Chandler, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, hurriedly jumping up from her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo! We don\xe2\x80\x99t want no strangers in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as she stepped down the short bit of passage she said to herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clue? What clue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when she opened the front door a glad sigh of relief broke from\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joe? We never thought \xe2\x80\x99twas you! But you\xe2\x80\x99re very welcome,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Chandler came in, a rather sheepish look on his good-looking, fair\r\nyoung face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought maybe that Mr. Bunting would like to know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in a\r\nloud, cheerful voice, and Mrs. Bunting hurriedly checked him. She\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want the lodger upstairs to hear what young Chandler might be\r\ngoing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk so loud,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lodger is not\r\nvery well to-day. He\xe2\x80\x99s had a cold,\xe2\x80\x9d she added hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cand during the\r\nlast two or three days he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered at her temerity, her\xe2\x80\x94her hypocrisy, and that moment, those\r\nfew words, marked an epoch in Ellen Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s life. It was the first\r\ntime she had told a bold and deliberate lie. She was one of those\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94there are many, many such\xe2\x80\x94to whom there is a whole world of\r\ndifference between the suppression of the truth and the utterance of an\r\nuntruth.\r\n\r\nBut Chandler paid no heed to her remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Miss Daisy arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, in a lower voice.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. And then he went through into the room where the father and\r\ndaughter were sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joe? Now you can tell us all\r\nabout that mysterious clue. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99d be too good news to expect\r\nyou to tell us they\xe2\x80\x99ve caught him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of such good news as that yet awhile. If they\xe2\x80\x99d caught him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Joe ruefully, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I should be here, Mr.\r\nBunting. But the Yard are circulating a description at last. And\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve found his weapon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bunting excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! Whatever sort of a\r\nthing is it? And are they sure \xe2\x80\x99tis his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t sure, but it seems to be likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had slipped into the room and shut the door behind her.\r\nBut she was still standing with her back against the door, looking at\r\nthe group in front of her. None of them were thinking of her\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nthanked God for that! She could hear everything that was said without\r\njoining in the talk and excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to this!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe Chandler exultantly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t given out\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94not for the public, that is\xe2\x80\x94but we was all given it by eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning. Quick work that, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d He read out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWANTED\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man, of age approximately 28, slight in figure, height approximately\r\n5 ft. 8 in. Complexion dark. No beard or whiskers. Wearing a black\r\ndiagonal coat, hard felt hat, high white collar, and tie. Carried a\r\nnewspaper parcel. Very respectable appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting walked forward. She gave a long, fluttering sigh of\r\nunutterable relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Chandler triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Miss\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he turned to her jokingly, but there was a funny little tremor\r\nin his frank, cheerful-sounding voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you knows of any nice, likely\r\nyoung fellow that answers to that description\xe2\x80\x94well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to\r\nwalk in and earn your reward of five hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy and her father simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Lord Mayor offered yesterday. Some private\r\nbloke\xe2\x80\x94nothing official about it. But we of the Yard is barred from\r\ntaking that reward, worse luck. And it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, for we has all the\r\ntrouble, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust hand that bit of paper over, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto con it over to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler threw over the bit of flimsy.\r\n\r\nA moment later Bunting looked up and handed it back. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear\r\nenough, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And there\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds\xe2\x80\x94nay, thousands\xe2\x80\x94of young fellows that might\r\nbe a description of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a pal of mine\r\nsaid this morning, \xe2\x80\x98There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a chap will like to carry a newspaper\r\nparcel after this.\xe2\x80\x99 And it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to have a respectable\r\nappearance\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s voice rang out in merry, pealing laughter. She greatly\r\nappreciated Mr. Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s witticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth didn\xe2\x80\x99t the people who saw him try and catch him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nBunting suddenly.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Bunting broke in, in a lower voice, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe\xe2\x80\x94that seems odd,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler coughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one person\r\ndid see all that. The man who\xe2\x80\x99s described here is just made up from the\r\ndescription of two different folk who _think_ they saw him. You see,\r\nthe murders must have taken place\xe2\x80\x94well, now, let me see\xe2\x80\x94perhaps at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock this last time. Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea. Well, at such a\r\ntime as that not many people are about, especially on a foggy night.\r\nYes, one woman declares she saw a young chap walking away from the spot\r\nwhere \xe2\x80\x99twas done; and another one\xe2\x80\x94but that was a good bit later\xe2\x80\x94says\r\nThe Avenger passed by her. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly her they\xe2\x80\x99re following in this\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ere description. And then the boss who has charge of that sort of\r\nthing looked up what other people had said\xe2\x80\x94I mean when the other crimes\r\nwas committed. That\xe2\x80\x99s how he made up this \xe2\x80\x98Wanted.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen The Avenger may be quite a different sort of man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\nslowly, disappointedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course he may be. But, no; I think that description fits him\r\nall right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler; but he also spoke in a hesitating voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was saying, Joe, that they found a weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Bunting\r\ninsinuatingly.\r\n\r\nHe was glad that Ellen allowed the discussion to go on\xe2\x80\x94in fact, that\r\nshe even seemed to take an intelligent interest in it. She had come up\r\nclose to them, and now looked quite her old self again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. They believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve found the weapon what he does his awful\r\ndeeds with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, within a hundred yards of\r\nthat little dark passage where they found the bodies\xe2\x80\x94one at each end,\r\nthat was\xe2\x80\x94there was discovered this morning a very peculiar kind o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98keen as a razor, pointed as a dagger\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the exact words the\r\nboss used when he was describing it to a lot of us. He seemed to think\r\na lot more of that clue than of the other\xe2\x80\x94I mean than of the\r\ndescription people gave of the chap who walked quickly by with a\r\nnewspaper parcel. But now there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty job in front of us. Every\r\nshop where they sell or might a\xe2\x80\x99 sold, such a thing as that knife,\r\nincluding every eating-house in the East End, has got to be called at!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, with an idea of finding out if anyone saw such a knife fooling\r\nabout there any time, and, if so, in whose possession it was at the\r\ntime. But, Mr. Bunting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s voice changed; it became\r\nbusinesslike, official\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say anything about\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94not in newspapers\xe2\x80\x94till to-morrow, so don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and tell\r\nanybody. You see, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to frighten the fellow off. If he knew\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d got his knife\xe2\x80\x94well, he might just make himself scarce, and they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want that! If it\xe2\x80\x99s discovered that any knife of that kind was\r\nsold, say a month ago, to some customer whose ways are known,\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll happen then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting, coming nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, nothing\xe2\x80\x99ll be put about it in the papers at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChandler deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only objec\xe2\x80\x99 of letting the public know\r\nabout it would be if nothink was found\xe2\x80\x94I mean if the search of the\r\nshops, and so on, was no good. Then, of course, we must try and find\r\nout someone\xe2\x80\x94some private person-like, who\xe2\x80\x99s watched that knife in the\r\ncriminal\xe2\x80\x99s possession. It\xe2\x80\x99s there the reward\xe2\x80\x94the five hundred pounds\r\nwill come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to see that knife!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Daisy, clasping\r\nher hands together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cruel, bloodthirsty, girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her stepmother passionately.\r\n\r\nThey all looked round at her, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Ellen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _is_ a horrible idea!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo go and\r\nsell a fellow-being for five hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Daisy was offended. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\ndefiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never said nothing about the reward. That was Mr.\r\nChandler said that! I only said I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler looked at her soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the day may come when you\r\n_will_ see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly.\r\n\r\nA great idea had come into his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! What makes you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they catches him, and if you comes along with me to see our Black\r\nMuseum at the Yard, you\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly see the knife, Miss Daisy. They\r\nkeeps all them kind of things there. So if, as I say, this weapon\r\n_should_ lead to the conviction of The Avenger\xe2\x80\x94well, then, that knife\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ull be there, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Museum? Why, whatever do they have a museum in your place\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought there was only the British\r\nMuseum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then even Mrs. Bunting, as well as Bunting and Chandler, laughed\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a goosey girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said her father fondly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of\r\nmuseums in London; the town\xe2\x80\x99s thick with \xe2\x80\x99em. Ask Ellen there. She and\r\nme used to go to them kind of places when we was courting\xe2\x80\x94if the\r\nweather was bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our museum\xe2\x80\x99s the one that would interest Miss Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in\r\nChandler eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a regular Chamber of \xe2\x80\x99Orrors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joe, you never told us about that place before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\nexcitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you really mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s a museum where they keeps\r\nall sorts of things connected with crimes? Things like knives murders\r\nhave been committed with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnives?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, pleased at having become the centre of attention,\r\nfor Daisy had also fixed her blue eyes on him, and even Mrs. Bunting\r\nlooked at him expectantly. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch more than knives, Mr. Bunting! Why,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got there, in little bottles, the real poison what people have\r\nbeen done away with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you go there whenever you like?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy wonderingly. She\r\nhad not realised before what extraordinary and agreeable privileges are\r\nattached to the position of a detective member of the London Police\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I _could_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Joe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway I can certainly get\r\nleave to take a friend there.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked meaningly at Daisy, and Daisy\r\nlooked eagerly at him.\r\n\r\nBut would Ellen ever let her go out by herself with Mr. Chandler? Ellen\r\nwas so prim, so\xe2\x80\x94so irritatingly proper. But what was this father was\r\nsaying? \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you really mean that, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, look here! If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t asking too much of a favour, I\r\nshould like to go along there with you very much one day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto wait till The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s caught\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Bunting smiled broadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nquite content as it is with what there is in that museum o\xe2\x80\x99 yours.\r\nEllen, there,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked across at his wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t agree with me about\r\nsuch things. Yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m a bloodthirsty man! But I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nterribly interested in all that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x94always have been. I used\r\nto positively envy the butler in that Balham Mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain a look passed between Daisy and the young man\xe2\x80\x94it was a look which\r\ncontained and carried a great many things backwards and forwards, such\r\nas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny that your father should want to go to such a\r\nplace? But still, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if he does want to go, so we must put\r\nup with his company, though it would have been much nicer for us to go\r\njust by our two selves.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s look answered quite as\r\nplainly, though perhaps Joe didn\xe2\x80\x99t read her glance quite as clearly as\r\nshe had read his: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is tiresome. But father means well; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twill be very pleasant going there, even if he does come too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what d\xe2\x80\x99you say to the day after to-morrow, Mr. Bunting? I\xe2\x80\x99d call\r\nfor you here about\xe2\x80\x94shall we say half-past two?\xe2\x80\x94and just take you and\r\nMiss Daisy down to the Yard. \xe2\x80\x99Twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take very long; we could go all\r\nthe way by bus, right down to Westminster Bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round at\r\nhis hostess: \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you join us, Mrs. Bunting? \xe2\x80\x99Tis truly a\r\nwonderful interesting place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his hostess shook her head decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould turn me sick,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the bottle of poison what had done away with the\r\nlife of some poor creature!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for knives\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d a look of real horror, of startled fear, crept\r\nover her pale face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cLive and let live\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nalways say. Ellen ain\xe2\x80\x99t on in this turn. She can just stay at home and\r\nmind the cat\xe2\x80\x94I beg his pardon, I mean the lodger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have Mr. Sleuth laughed at,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting darkly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthere! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, Joe, to think of giving Bunting\r\nand Daisy such a rare treat\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she spoke sarcastically, but none of the\r\nthree who heard her understood that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment she passed though the great arched door which admits the\r\nstranger to that portion of New Scotland Yard where throbs the heart of\r\nthat great organism which fights the forces of civilised crime, Daisy\r\nBunting felt that she had indeed become free of the Kingdom of Romance.\r\nEven the lift in which the three of them were whirled up to one of the\r\nupper floors of the huge building was to the girl a new and delightful\r\nexperience. Daisy had always lived a simple, quiet life in the little\r\ncountry town where dwelt Old Aunt and this was the first time a lift\r\nhad come her way.\r\n\r\nWith a touch of personal pride in the vast building, Joe Chandler\r\nmarched his friends down a wide, airy corridor.\r\n\r\nDaisy clung to her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm, a little bewildered, a little\r\noppressed by her good fortune. Her happy young voice was stilled by the\r\nawe she felt at the wonderful place where she found herself, and by the\r\nglimpses she caught of great rooms full of busy, silent men engaged in\r\nunravelling\xe2\x80\x94or so she supposed\xe2\x80\x94the mysteries of crime.\r\n\r\nThey were passing a half-open door when Chandler suddenly stopped\r\nshort. \xe2\x80\x9cLook in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice, addressing the father\r\nrather than the daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the Finger-Print Room. We\xe2\x80\x99ve records\r\nhere of over two hundred thousand men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s finger-tips! I\r\nexpect you know, Mr. Bunting, as how, once we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the print of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s five finger-tips, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s done for\xe2\x80\x94if he ever does anything\r\nelse, that is. Once we\xe2\x80\x99ve got that bit of him registered he can\xe2\x80\x99t never\r\nescape us\xe2\x80\x94no, not if he tries ever so. But though there\xe2\x80\x99s nigh on a\r\nquarter of a million records in there, yet it don\xe2\x80\x99t take\xe2\x80\x94well, not half\r\nan hour, for them to tell whether any particular man has ever been\r\nconvicted before! Wonderful thought, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, drawing a deep breath. And then a troubled\r\nlook came over his stolid face. \xe2\x80\x9cWonderful, but also a very fearful\r\nthought for the poor wretches as has got their finger-prints in, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAgreed!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the cleverer ones knows that only\r\ntoo well. Why, not long ago, one man who knew his record was here safe,\r\nmanaged to slash about his fingers something awful, just so as to make\r\na blurred impression\xe2\x80\x94you takes my meaning? But there, at the end of six\r\nweeks the skin grew all right again, and in exactly the same little\r\ncreases as before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting under his breath, and a cloud even came over\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s bright eager face.\r\n\r\nThey were now going along a narrower passage, and then again they came\r\nto a half-open door, leading into a room far smaller than that of the\r\nFinger-Print Identification Room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll glance in there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe briefly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see how we finds\r\nout all about any man whose finger-tips has given him away, so to\r\nspeak. It\xe2\x80\x99s here we keeps an account of what he\xe2\x80\x99s done, his previous\r\nconvictions, and so on. His finger-tips are where I told you, and his\r\nrecord in there\xe2\x80\x94just connected by a number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, drawing in his breath. But Daisy was longing\r\nto get on\xe2\x80\x94to get to the Black Museum. All this that Joe and her father\r\nwere saying was quite unreal to her, and, for the matter of that not\r\nworth taking the trouble to understand. However, she had not long to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nA broad-shouldered, pleasant-looking young fellow, who seemed on very\r\nfriendly terms with Joe Chandler, came forward suddenly, and, unlocking\r\na common-place-looking door, ushered the little party of three through\r\ninto the Black Museum.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there came across Daisy a feeling of keen disappointment\r\nand surprise. This big, light room simply reminded her of what they\r\ncalled the Science Room in the public library of the town where she\r\nlived with Old Aunt. Here, as there, the centre was taken up with plain\r\nglass cases fixed at a height from the floor which enabled their\r\ncontents to be looked at closely.\r\n\r\nShe walked forward and peered into the case nearest the door. The\r\nexhibits shown there were mostly small, shabby-looking little things,\r\nthe sort of things one might turn out of an old rubbish cupboard in an\r\nuntidy house\xe2\x80\x94old medicine bottles, a soiled neckerchief, what looked\r\nlike a child\xe2\x80\x99s broken lantern, even a box of pills. . .\r\n\r\nAs for the walls, they were covered with the queerest-looking objects;\r\nbits of old iron, odd-looking things made of wood and leather, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nIt was really rather disappointing.\r\n\r\nThen Daisy Bunting gradually became aware that standing on a shelf just\r\nbelow the first of the broad, spacious windows which made the great\r\nroom look so light and shadowless, was a row of life-size white plaster\r\nheads, each head slightly inclined to the right. There were about a\r\ndozen of these, not more\xe2\x80\x94and they had such odd, staring, helpless,\r\n_real_-looking faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever\xe2\x80\x99s those?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting in a low voice.\r\n\r\nDaisy clung a thought closer to her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Even she guessed that\r\nthese strange, pathetic, staring faces were the death-masks of those\r\nmen and women who had fulfilled the awful law which ordains that the\r\nmurderer shall be, in his turn, done to death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d said the guardian of the Black Museum briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cCasts\r\ntaken after death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting smiled nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t look dead somehow. They looks\r\nmore as if they were listening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of Jack Ketch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man facetiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94that of knotting his patient\xe2\x80\x99s necktie under the left ear! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat he does to each of the gentlemen to whom he has to act valet on\r\njust one occasion only. It makes them lean just a bit to one side. You\r\nlook here\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy and her father came a little closer, and the speaker pointed with\r\nhis finger to a little dent imprinted on the left side of each neck;\r\nrunning from this indentation was a curious little furrow, well ridged\r\nabove, showing how tightly Jack Ketch\xe2\x80\x99s necktie had been drawn when its\r\nwearer was hurried through the gates of eternity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looks foolish-like, rather than terrified, or\xe2\x80\x94or hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBunting wonderingly.\r\n\r\nHe was extraordinarily moved and fascinated by those dumb, staring\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nBut young Chandler exclaimed in a cheerful, matter-of-fact voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a man would look foolish at such a time as that, with all his\r\nplans brought to naught\xe2\x80\x94and knowing he\xe2\x80\x99s only got a second to live\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose he would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting slowly.\r\n\r\nDaisy had gone a little pale. The sinister, breathless atmosphere of\r\nthe place was beginning to tell on her. She now began to understand\r\nthat the shabby little objects lying there in the glass case close to\r\nher were each and all links in the chain of evidence which, in almost\r\nevery case, had brought some guilty man or woman to the gallows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a yellow gentleman here the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the guardian\r\nsuddenly; \xe2\x80\x9cone of those Brahmins\xe2\x80\x94so they calls themselves. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\na been quite surprised to see how that heathen took on! He\r\ndeclared\xe2\x80\x94what was the word he used?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he turned to Chandler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that each of these things, with the exception of the casts,\r\nmind you\xe2\x80\x94queer to say, he left them out\xe2\x80\x94exuded evil, that was the word\r\nhe used! Exuded\xe2\x80\x94squeezed out it means. He said that being here made him\r\nfeel very bad. And twasn\xe2\x80\x99t all nonsense either. He turned quite green\r\nunder his yellow skin, and we had to shove him out quick. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel better till he\xe2\x80\x99d got right to the other end of the passage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! Who\xe2\x80\x99d ever think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cI should say that\r\nman \xe2\x80\x99ud got something on his conscience, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t stay now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured friend. \xe2\x80\x9cYou show\r\nyour friends round, Chandler. You knows the place nearly as well as I\r\ndo, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, as if to say good-bye, but it seemed that\r\nhe could not tear himself away after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this here little case are the\r\ntools of Charles Peace. I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bunting eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany gents as comes here thinks this case the most interesting of all.\r\nPeace was such a wonderful man! A great inventor they say he would have\r\nbeen, had he been put in the way of it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s his ladder; you see it\r\nfolds up quite compactly, and makes a nice little bundle\xe2\x80\x94just like a\r\nbundle of old sticks any man might have been seen carrying about London\r\nin those days without attracting any attention. Why, it probably helped\r\nhim to look like an honest working man time and time again, for on\r\nbeing arrested he declared most solemnly he\xe2\x80\x99d always carried that\r\nladder openly under his arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe daring of that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and when the ladder was opened out it could reach from the ground\r\nto the second storey of any old house. And, oh! how clever he was! Just\r\nopen one section, and you see the other sections open automatically; so\r\nPeace could stand on the ground and force the thing quietly up to any\r\nwindow he wished to reach. Then he\xe2\x80\x99d go away again, having done his\r\njob, with a mere bundle of old wood under his arm! My word, he was\r\nartful! I wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the tale of how Peace once lost a\r\nfinger. Well, he guessed the constables were instructed to look out for\r\na man missing a finger; so what did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut on a false finger,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! Peace made up his mind just to do without a hand\r\naltogether. Here\xe2\x80\x99s his false stump: you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s made of wood\xe2\x80\x94wood and\r\nblack felt? Well, that just held his hand nicely. Why, we considers\r\nthat one of the most ingenious contrivances in the whole museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Daisy had let go her hold of her father. With Chandler in\r\ndelighted attendance, she had moved away to the farther end of the\r\ngreat room, and now she was bending over yet another glass case.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are those little bottles for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\nThere were five small phials, filled with varying quantities of cloudy\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re full of poison, Miss Daisy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they are. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough arsenic in that little whack o\xe2\x80\x99 brandy to do for you and me\xe2\x80\x94aye,\r\nand for your father as well, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen chemists shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell such stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, smiling. Poison\r\nwas so remote from herself, that the sight of these little bottles only\r\nbrought a pleasant thrill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more they don\xe2\x80\x99t. That was sneaked out of a flypaper, that was. Lady\r\nsaid she wanted a cosmetic for her complexion, but what she was really\r\ngoing for was flypapers for to do away with her husband. She\xe2\x80\x99d got a\r\nbit tired of him, I suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he was a horrid man, and deserved to be done away with,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDaisy. The idea struck them both as so very comic that they began to\r\nlaugh aloud in unison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear what a certain Mrs. Pearce did?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chandler,\r\nbecoming suddenly serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, and she shuddered a little. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the\r\nwicked, wicked woman what killed a pretty little baby and its mother.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got her in Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s. But Ellen, she won\xe2\x80\x99t let me go to\r\nthe Chamber of Horrors. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let father take me there last time\r\nI was in London. Cruel of her, I called it. But somehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as\r\nif I wanted to go there now, after having been here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve a case full of relics of Mrs.\r\nPearce. But the pram the bodies were found in, that\xe2\x80\x99s at Madame\r\nTussaud\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94at least so they claim, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\njust as curious, and not near so dreadful. See that man\xe2\x80\x99s jacket\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy falteringly. She was beginning to feel oppressed,\r\nfrightened. She no longer wondered that the Indian gentleman had been\r\ntaken queer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA burglar shot a man dead who\xe2\x80\x99d disturbed him, and by mistake he went\r\nand left that jacket behind him. Our people noticed that one of the\r\nbuttons was broken in two. Well, that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem much of a clue, does\r\nit, Miss Daisy? Will you believe me when I tells you that that other\r\nbit of button was discovered, and that it hanged the fellow? And \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nthe more wonderful because all three buttons was different!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy stared wonderingly, down at the little broken button which had\r\nhung a man. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd whatever\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, pointing to a piece of\r\ndirty-looking stuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s rather a horrible thing\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis. That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 shirt that was buried with a woman\xe2\x80\x94buried in the\r\nground, I mean\xe2\x80\x94after her husband had cut her up and tried to burn her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas that bit o\xe2\x80\x99 shirt that brought him to the gallows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI considers your museum\xe2\x80\x99s a very horrid place!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy pettishly,\r\nturning away.\r\n\r\nShe longed to be out in the passage again, away from this brightly\r\nlighted, cheerful-looking, sinister room.\r\n\r\nBut her father was now absorbed in the case containing various types of\r\ninfernal machines. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful little works of art some of them are,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid his guide eagerly, and Bunting could not but agree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along\xe2\x80\x94do, father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen about enough\r\nnow. If I was to stay in here much longer it \xe2\x80\x99ud give me the horrors. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to have no nightmares to-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think there\r\nare so many wicked people in the world. Why, we might knock up against\r\nsome murderer any minute without knowing it, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot you, Miss Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler smilingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\never come across even a common swindler, let alone anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommitted a murder\xe2\x80\x94not one in a million does that. Why, even I have\r\nnever had anything to do with a proper murder case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bunting was in no hurry. He was thoroughly enjoying every moment of\r\nthe time. Just now he was studying intently the various photographs\r\nwhich hung on the walls of the Black Museum; especially was he pleased\r\nto see those connected with a famous and still mysterious case which\r\nhad taken place not long before in Scotland, and in which the servant\r\nof the man who died had played a considerable part\xe2\x80\x94not in elucidating,\r\nbut in obscuring, the mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose a good many murderers get off?\xe2\x80\x9d he said musingly.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s friend nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think they did!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as justice here in England. \xe2\x80\x99Tis odds\r\non the murderer every time. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t one in ten that come to the end he\r\nshould do\xe2\x80\x94to the gallows, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xe2\x80\x99you think about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on now\xe2\x80\x94I mean about those\r\nAvenger murders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting lowered his voice, but Daisy and Chandler were already moving\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other confidentially.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways \xe2\x80\x99tis a lot more of a job to catch a madman than \xe2\x80\x99tis to\r\nrun down just an ordinary criminal. And, of course\xe2\x80\x94leastways to my\r\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94The Avenger _is_ a madman\xe2\x80\x94one of the cunning, quiet sort. Have\r\nyou heard about the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d his voice dropped lower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, staring eagerly at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s a letter\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll be in this museum some day\xe2\x80\x94which came\r\njust before that last double event. \xe2\x80\x99Twas signed \xe2\x80\x98The Avenger,\xe2\x80\x99 in just\r\nthe same printed characters as on that bit of paper he always leaves\r\nbehind him. Mind you, it don\xe2\x80\x99t follow that it actually was The Avenger\r\nwhat sent that letter here, but it looks uncommonly like it, and I know\r\nthat the Boss attaches quite a lot of importance to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where was it posted?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cThat might be a bit of a\r\nclue, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThey always goes a very long way to post\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94criminals do. It stands to reason they would. But this\r\nparticular one was put in the Edgware Road Post Office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Close to us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodness! dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny of us might knock up against him any minute. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x99s in any way peculiar-looking\xe2\x80\x94in fact we know he ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think that woman as says she saw him did see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nBunting hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur description was made up from what she said,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other\r\ncautiously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, there, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell! In a case like that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngroping\xe2\x80\x94groping in the dark all the time\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s just a lucky accident\r\nif it comes out right in the end. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s upsetting us all very\r\nmuch here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word, I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly\r\nthought of anything else for the last month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy had disappeared, and when her father joined her in the passage\r\nshe was listening, with downcast eyes, to what Joe Chandler was saying.\r\n\r\nHe was telling her about his real home, of the place where his mother\r\nlived, at Richmond\xe2\x80\x94that it was a nice little house, close to the park.\r\nHe was asking her whether she could manage to come out there one\r\nafternoon, explaining that his mother would give them tea, and how nice\r\nit would be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why Ellen shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said rebelliously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s that old-fashioned and pernickety is Ellen\xe2\x80\x94a regular old\r\nmaid! And, you see, Mr. Chandler, when I\xe2\x80\x99m staying with them, father\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like for me to do anything that Ellen don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of. But she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot quite fond of you, so perhaps if you ask her\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him,\r\nand he nodded sagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get round Mrs.\r\nBunting. But, Miss Daisy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he grew very red\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just like to ask you a\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94no offence meant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy a little breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s father close to us,\r\nMr. Chandler. Tell me quick; what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I take it, by what you said just now, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve never walked\r\nout with any young fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy hesitated a moment; then a very pretty dimple came into her\r\ncheek. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Chandler, that I have not.\xe2\x80\x9d In a\r\nburst of candour she added, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I never had the chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Joe Chandler smiled, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what she regarded as a fortunate chance, Mrs. Bunting found herself\r\nfor close on an hour quite alone in the house during her husband\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt with young Chandler.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth did not often go out in the daytime, but on this particular\r\nafternoon, after he had finished his tea, when dusk was falling, he\r\nsuddenly observed that he wanted a new suit of clothes, and his\r\nlandlady eagerly acquiesced in his going out to purchase it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had left the house, she went quickly up to the\r\ndrawing-room floor. Now had come her opportunity of giving the two\r\nrooms a good dusting; but Mrs. Bunting knew well, deep in her heart,\r\nthat it was not so much the dusting of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room she\r\nwanted to do\xe2\x80\x94as to engage in a vague search for\xe2\x80\x94she hardly knew for\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nDuring the years she had been in service Mrs. Bunting had always had a\r\ndeep, wordless contempt for those of her fellow-servants who read their\r\nemployers\xe2\x80\x99 private letters, and who furtively peeped into desks and\r\ncupboards in the hope, more vague than positive, of discovering family\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nBut now, with regard to Mr. Sleuth, she was ready, aye, eager, to do\r\nherself what she had once so scorned others for doing.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the bedroom, she started on a methodical search. He was\r\na very tidy gentleman was the lodger, and his few things,\r\nunder-garments, and so on, were in apple-pie order. She had early\r\nundertaken, much to his satisfaction, to do the very little bit of\r\nwashing he required done, with her own and Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s. Luckily he wore\r\nsoft shirts.\r\n\r\nAt one time Mrs. Bunting had always had a woman in to help her with\r\nthis tiresome weekly job, but lately she had grown quite clever at it\r\nherself. The only things she had to send out were Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s shirts.\r\nEverything else she managed to do herself.\r\n\r\nFrom the chest of drawers she now turned her attention to the\r\ndressing-table.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth did not take his money with him when he went out, he\r\ngenerally left it in one of the drawers below the old-fashioned\r\nlooking-glass. And now, in a perfunctory way, his landlady pulled out\r\nthe little drawer, but she did not touch what was lying there; she only\r\nglanced at the heap of sovereigns and a few bits of silver. The lodger\r\nhad taken just enough money with him to buy the clothes he required. He\r\nhad consulted her as to how much they would cost, making no secret of\r\nwhy he was going out, and the fact had vaguely comforted Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\nNow she lifted the toilet-cover, and even rolled up the carpet a little\r\nway, but no, there was nothing there, not so much as a scrap of paper.\r\nAnd at last, when more or less giving up the search, as she came and\r\nwent between the two rooms, leaving the connecting door wide open, her\r\nmind became full of uneasy speculation and wonder as to the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast life.\r\n\r\nOdd Mr. Sleuth must surely always have been, but odd in a sensible sort\r\nof way, having on the whole the same moral ideals of conduct as have\r\nother people of his class. He was queer about the drink\xe2\x80\x94one might say\r\nalmost crazy on the subject\xe2\x80\x94but there, as to that, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only\r\none! She, Ellen Bunting, had once lived with a lady who was just like\r\nthat, who was quite crazed, that is, on the question of drink and\r\ndrunkards\xe2\x80\x94She looked round the neat drawing-room with vague\r\ndissatisfaction. There was only one place where anything could be kept\r\nconcealed\xe2\x80\x94that place was the substantial if small mahogany chiffonnier.\r\nAnd then an idea suddenly came to Mrs. Bunting, one she had never\r\nthought of before.\r\n\r\nAfter listening intently for a moment, lest something should suddenly\r\nbring Mr. Sleuth home earlier than she expected, she went to the corner\r\nwhere the chiffonnier stood, and, exerting the whole of her not very\r\ngreat physical strength, she tipped forward the heavy piece of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nAs she did so, she heard a queer rumbling sound,\xe2\x80\x94something rolling\r\nabout on the second shelf, something which had not been there before\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. Slowly, laboriously, she tipped the chiffonnier\r\nbackwards and forwards\xe2\x80\x94once, twice, thrice\xe2\x80\x94satisfied, yet strangely\r\ntroubled in her mind, for she now felt sure that the bag of which the\r\ndisappearance had so surprised her was there, safely locked away by its\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a very uncomfortable thought came to Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She\r\nhoped Mr. Sleuth would not notice that his bag had shifted inside the\r\ncupboard. A moment later, with sharp dismay, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady\r\nrealised that the fact that she had moved the chiffonnier must become\r\nknown to her lodger, for a thin trickle of some dark-coloured liquid\r\nwas oozing out though the bottom of the little cupboard door.\r\n\r\nShe stooped down and touched the stuff. It showed red, bright red, on\r\nher finger.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting grew chalky white, then recovered herself quickly. In fact\r\nthe colour rushed into her face, and she grew hot all over.\r\n\r\nIt was only a bottle of red ink she had upset\xe2\x80\x94that was all! How could\r\nshe have thought it was anything else?\r\n\r\nIt was the more silly of her\xe2\x80\x94so she told herself in scornful\r\ncondemnation\xe2\x80\x94because she knew that the lodger used red ink. Certain\r\npages of Cruden\xe2\x80\x99s Concordance were covered with notes written in Mr.\r\nSleuth\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar upright handwriting. In fact in some places you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the margin, so closely covered was it with remarks and\r\nnotes of interrogation.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth had foolishly placed his bottle of red ink in the\r\nchiffonnier\xe2\x80\x94that was what her poor, foolish gentleman had done; and it\r\nwas owing to her inquisitiveness, her restless wish to know things she\r\nwould be none the better, none the happier, for knowing, that this\r\naccident had taken place.\r\n\r\nShe mopped up with her duster the few drops of ink which had fallen on\r\nthe green carpet and then, still feeling, as she angrily told herself,\r\nfoolishly upset she went once more into the back room.\r\n\r\nIt was curious that Mr. Sleuth possessed no notepaper. She would have\r\nexpected him to have made that one of his first purchases\xe2\x80\x94the more so\r\nthat paper is so very cheap, especially that rather dirty-looking grey\r\nSilurian paper. Mrs. Bunting had once lived with a lady who always used\r\ntwo kinds of notepaper, white for her friends and equals, grey for\r\nthose whom she called \xe2\x80\x9ccommon people.\xe2\x80\x9d She, Ellen Green, as she then\r\nwas, had always resented the fact. Strange she should remember it now,\r\nstranger in a way because that employer of her\xe2\x80\x99s had not been a real\r\nlady, and Mr. Sleuth, whatever his peculiarities, was, in every sense\r\nof the word, a real gentleman. Somehow Mrs. Bunting felt sure that if\r\nhe had bought any notepaper it would have been white\xe2\x80\x94white and probably\r\ncream-laid\xe2\x80\x94not grey and cheap.\r\n\r\nAgain she opened the drawer of the old-fashioned wardrobe and lifted up\r\nthe few pieces of underclothing Mr. Sleuth now possessed.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing there\xe2\x80\x94nothing, that is, hidden away. When one\r\ncame to think of it there seemed something strange in the notion of\r\nleaving all one\xe2\x80\x99s money where anyone could take it, and in locking up\r\nsuch a valueless thing as a cheap sham leather bag, to say nothing of a\r\nbottle of ink.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting once more opened out each of the tiny drawers below the\r\nlooking-glass, each delicately fashioned of fine old mahogany. Mr.\r\nSleuth kept his money in the centre drawer.\r\n\r\nThe glass had only cost seven-and-sixpence, and, after the auction a\r\ndealer had come and offered her first fifteen shillings, and then a\r\nguinea for it. Not long ago, in Baker Street, she had seen a\r\nlooking-glass which was the very spit of this one, labeled\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChippendale, Antique. \xc2\xa321 5s 0d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere lay Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s money\xe2\x80\x94the sovereigns, as the landlady well knew,\r\nwould each and all gradually pass into her\xe2\x80\x99s and Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s possession,\r\nhonestly earned by them no doubt but unattainable\xe2\x80\x94in act\r\nunearnable\xe2\x80\x94excepting in connection with the present owner of those\r\ndully shining gold sovereigns.\r\n\r\nAt last she went downstairs to await Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard the key turn in the door, she came out into the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say I\xe2\x80\x99ve had an accident, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little\r\nbreathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cTaking advantage of your being out I went up to dust the\r\ndrawing-room, and while I was trying to get behind the chiffonnier it\r\ntilted. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, sir, that a bottle of ink that was inside may have\r\ngot broken, for just a few drops oozed out, sir. But I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nharm done. I wiped it up as well as I could, seeing that the doors of\r\nthe chiffonnier are locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth stared at her with a wild, almost a terrified glance. But\r\nMrs. Bunting stood her ground. She felt far less afraid now than she\r\nhad felt before he came in. Then she had been so frightened that she\r\nhad nearly gone out of the house, on to the pavement, for company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I had no idea, sir, that you kept any ink in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if she were on the defensive, and the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s brow\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was aware you used ink, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have seen\r\nyou marking that book of yours\xe2\x80\x94I mean the book you read together with\r\nthe Bible. Would you like me to go out and get you another bottle,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you. I will at once proceed\r\nupstairs and see what damage has been done. When I require you I shall\r\nring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shuffled past her, and five minutes later the drawing-room bell did\r\nring.\r\n\r\nAt once, from the door, Mrs. Bunting saw that the chiffonnier was wide\r\nopen, and that the shelves were empty save for the bottle of red ink\r\nwhich had turned over and now lay in a red pool of its own making on\r\nthe lower shelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it will have stained the wood, Mrs. Bunting. Perhaps I was\r\nill-advised to keep my ink in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir! That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all. Only a drop or two fell out\r\non to the carpet, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t show, as you see, sir, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a dark\r\ncorner. Shall I take the bottle away? I may as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\r\nMrs. Bunting. For the very little I require it the ink remaining in the\r\nbottle will do quite well, especially if I add a little water, or\r\nbetter still, a little tea, to what already remains in the bottle. I\r\nonly require it to mark up passages which happen to be of peculiar\r\ninterest in my Concordance\xe2\x80\x94a work, Mrs. Bunting, which I should have\r\ntaken great pleasure in compiling myself had not this\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94this gentleman\r\ncalled Cruden, been before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot only Bunting, but Daisy also, thought Ellen far pleasanter in her\r\nmanner than usual that evening. She listened to all they had to say\r\nabout their interesting visit to the Black Museum, and did not snub\r\neither of them\xe2\x80\x94no, not even when Bunting told of the dreadful,\r\nhaunting, silly-looking death-masks taken from the hanged.\r\n\r\nBut a few minutes after that, when her husband suddenly asked her a\r\nquestion, Mrs. Bunting answered at random. It was clear she had not\r\nheard the last few words he had been saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA penny for your thoughts!\xe2\x80\x9d he said jocularly. But she shook her head.\r\n\r\nDaisy slipped out of the room, and, five minutes later, came back\r\ndressed up in a blue-and-white check silk gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy!\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do look fine, Daisy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen you\r\nwearing that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a rare figure of fun she looks in it!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Bunting\r\nsarcastically. And then, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose this dressing up means that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nexpecting someone. I should have thought both of you must have seen\r\nenough of young Chandler for one day. I wonder when that young chap\r\ndoes his work\xe2\x80\x94that I do! He never seems too busy to come and waste an\r\nhour or two here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that was the only nasty thing Ellen said all that evening. And even\r\nDaisy noticed that her stepmother seemed dazed and unlike herself. She\r\nwent about her cooking and the various little things she had to do even\r\nmore silently than was her wont.\r\n\r\nYet under that still, almost sullen, manner, how fierce was the storm\r\nof dread, of sombre anguish, and, yes, of sick suspense, which shook\r\nher soul, and which so far affected her poor, ailing body that often\r\nshe felt as if she could not force herself to accomplish her simple\r\nround of daily work.\r\n\r\nAfter they had finished supper Bunting went out and bought a penny\r\nevening paper, but as he came in he announced, with a rather rueful\r\nsmile, that he had read so much of that nasty little print this last\r\nweek or two that his eyes hurt him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me read aloud a bit to you, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy eagerly, and he\r\nhanded her the paper.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Daisy opened her lips when a loud ring and a knock echoed\r\nthrough the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only Joe. Somehow, even Bunting called him \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x9d now, and no\r\nlonger \xe2\x80\x9cChandler,\xe2\x80\x9d as he had mostly used to do.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had opened the front door only a very little way. She\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have any strangers pushing in past her.\r\n\r\nTo her sharpened, suffering senses her house had become a citadel which\r\nmust be defended; aye, even if the besiegers were a mighty horde _with\r\nright on their side_. And she was always expecting that first single\r\nspy who would herald the battalion against whom her only weapon would\r\nbe her woman\xe2\x80\x99s wit and cunning.\r\n\r\nBut when she saw who stood there smiling at her, the muscles of her\r\nface relaxed, and it lost the tense, anxious, almost agonised look it\r\nassumed the moment she turned her back on her husband and stepdaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, for she had left the door open behind her,\r\nand Daisy had already begun to read aloud, as her father had bidden\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, do! It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly cold to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance at his face had shown her that there was no fresh news.\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler walked in, past her, into the little hall. Cold? Well, he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t feel cold, for he had walked quickly to be the sooner where he\r\nwas now.\r\n\r\nNine days had gone by since that last terrible occurrence, the double\r\nmurder which had been committed early in the morning of the day Daisy\r\nhad arrived in London. And though the thousands of men belonging to the\r\nMetropolitan Police\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of the smaller, more alert body of\r\ndetectives attached to the Force\xe2\x80\x94were keenly on the alert, not one but\r\nhad begun to feel that there was nothing to be alert about.\r\nFamiliarity, even with horror, breeds contempt.\r\n\r\nBut with the public it was far otherwise. Each day something happened\r\nto revive and keep alive the mingled horror and interest this strange,\r\nenigmatic series of crimes had evoked. Even the more sober organs of\r\nthe Press went on attacking, with gathering severity and indignation,\r\nthe Commissioner of Police; and at the huge demonstration held in\r\nVictoria Park two days before violent speeches had also been made\r\nagainst the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\nBut just now Joe Chandler wanted to forget all that. The little house\r\nin the Marylebone Road had become to him an enchanted isle of dreams,\r\nto which his thoughts were ever turning when he had a moment to spare\r\nfrom what had grown to be a wearisome, because an unsatisfactory, job.\r\nHe secretly agreed with one of his pals who had exclaimed, and that\r\nwithin twenty-four hours of the last double crime, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99twould be\r\neasier to find a needle in a rick o\xe2\x80\x99 hay than this\xe2\x80\x94bloke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd if that had been true then, how much truer it was now\xe2\x80\x94after nine\r\nlong, empty days had gone by?\r\n\r\nQuickly he divested himself of his great-coat, muffler, and low hat.\r\nThen he put his finger on his lip, and motioned smilingly to Mrs.\r\nBunting to wait a moment. From where he stood in the hall the father\r\nand daughter made a pleasant little picture of contented domesticity.\r\nJoe Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s honest heart swelled at the sight.\r\n\r\nDaisy, wearing the blue-and-white check silk dress about which her\r\nstepmother and she had had words, sat on a low stool on the left side\r\nof the fire, while Bunting, leaning back in his own comfortable\r\narm-chair, was listening, his hand to his ear, in an attitude\xe2\x80\x94as it was\r\nthe first time she had caught him doing it, the fact brought a pang to\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94which showed that age was beginning to creep over the\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nOne of Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s duties as companion to her great-aunt was that of\r\nreading the newspaper aloud, and she prided herself on her\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nJust as Joe had put his finger on his lip Daisy had been asking, \xe2\x80\x9cShall\r\nI read this, father?\xe2\x80\x9d And Bunting had answered quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cAye, do, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was absorbed in what he was hearing, and, on seeing Joe at the door,\r\nhe had only just nodded his head. The young man was becoming so\r\nfrequent a visitor as to be almost one of themselves.\r\n\r\nDaisy read out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE AVENGER: A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she stopped short, for the next word puzzled her greatly.\r\nBravely, however, she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cA the-o-ry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Bunting to her visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we stay\r\nout here in the cold? It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to interrupt Miss Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Chandler back, rather\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear it all the better in the room. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstop because of you, bless you! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing shy about our Daisy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man resented the tart, short tone. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little girl!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is having a stepmother,\r\ninstead of a proper mother.\xe2\x80\x9d But he obeyed Mrs. Bunting, and then he\r\nwas pleased he had done so, for Daisy looked up, and a bright blush\r\ncame over her pretty face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe begs you won\xe2\x80\x99t stop yet awhile. Go on with your reading,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncommanded Mrs. Bunting quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joe, you can go and sit over\r\nthere, close to Daisy, and then you won\xe2\x80\x99t miss a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sarcastic inflection in her voice, even Chandler noticed\r\nthat, but he obeyed her with alacrity, and crossing the room he went\r\nand sat on a chair just behind Daisy. From there he could note with\r\nreverent delight the charming way her fair hair grew upwards from the\r\nnape of her slender neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE AVENGER: A THE-O-RY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nbegan Daisy again, clearing her throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR\xe2\x80\x94I have a suggestion to put forward for which I think there is\r\na great deal to be said. It seems to me very probable that The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x94to give him the name by which he apparently wishes to be\r\nknown\xe2\x80\x94comprises in his own person the peculiarities of Jekyll and Hyde,\r\nMr. Louis Stevenson\xe2\x80\x99s now famous hero.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe culprit, according to my point of view, is a quiet,\r\n    pleasant-looking gentleman who lives somewhere in the West End of\r\n    London. He has, however, a tragedy in his past life. He is the\r\n    husband of a dipsomaniac wife. She is, of course, under care, and\r\n    is never mentioned in the house where he lives, maybe with his\r\n    widowed mother and perhaps a maiden sister. They notice that he has\r\n    become gloomy and brooding of late, but he lives his usual life,\r\n    occupying himself each day with some harmless hobby. On foggy\r\n    nights, once the quiet household is plunged in sleep, he creeps out\r\n    of the house, maybe between one and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and swiftly makes\r\n    his way straight to what has become The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s murder area.\r\n    Picking out a likely victim, he approaches her with Judas-like\r\n    gentleness, and having committed his awful crime, goes quietly home\r\n    again. After a good bath and breakfast, he turns up happy, once\r\n    more the quiet individual who is an excellent son, a kind brother,\r\n    esteemed and even beloved by a large circle of friends and\r\n    acquaintances. Meantime, the police are searching about the scene\r\n    of the tragedy for what they regard as the usual type of criminal\r\n    lunatic.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI give this theory, Sir, for what it is worth, but I confess that\r\n    I am amazed the police have so wholly confined their inquiries to\r\n    the part of London where these murders have been actually\r\n    committed. I am quite sure from all that has come out\xe2\x80\x94and we must\r\n    remember that full information is never given to the newspapers\xe2\x80\x94The\r\n    Avenger should be sought for in the West and not in the East End of\r\n    London\xe2\x80\x94Believe me to remain, Sir, yours very truly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Daisy hesitated, and then with an effort she brought out the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGab-o-ri-you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny name!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting wonderingly.\r\n\r\nAnd then Joe broke in: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of a French chap what wrote\r\ndetective stories,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty good, some of them are, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this Gaboriyou has come over to study these Avenger murders, I\r\ntake it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe spoke with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever\xe2\x80\x99s written that silly\r\nletter just signed that name for fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a silly letter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting had broken in resentfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder a respectable paper prints such rubbish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy if The Avenger did turn out to be a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, in\r\nan awe-struck voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99d be a how-to-do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere may be something in the notion,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, the monster must be somewhere. This very minute he must be\r\nsomewhere a-hiding of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting scornfully.\r\n\r\nShe had just heard Mr. Sleuth moving overhead. \xe2\x80\x99Twould soon be time for\r\nthe lodger\xe2\x80\x99s supper.\r\n\r\nShe hurried on: \xe2\x80\x9cBut what I do say is that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94he has nothing to do\r\nwith the West End. Why, they say it\xe2\x80\x99s a sailor from the Docks\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood bit more likely, I take it. But there, I\xe2\x80\x99m fair sick of the whole\r\nsubject! We talk of nothing else in this house. The Avenger this\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nAvenger that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect Joe has something to tell us new to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\ncheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joe, is there anything new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, father, just listen to this!\xe2\x80\x9d Daisy broke in excitedly. She\r\nread out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBLOODHOUNDS TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBloodhounds?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting, and there was terror in her tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy bloodhounds? That do seem to me a most horrible idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting looked across at her, mildly astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99twould be a\r\nvery good idea, if \xe2\x80\x99twas possible to have bloodhounds in a town. But,\r\nthere, how can that be done in London, full of butchers\xe2\x80\x99 shops, to say\r\nnothing of slaughter-yards and other places o\xe2\x80\x99 that sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Daisy went on, and to her stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking ear there seemed a\r\nhorrible thrill of delight; of gloating pleasure, in her fresh young\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark to this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who had committed a murder in a lonely wood near Blackburn was\r\ntraced by the help of a bloodhound, and thanks to the sagacious\r\ninstincts of the animal, the miscreant was finally convicted and\r\nhanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, now! Who\xe2\x80\x99d ever have thought of such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting exclaimed,\r\nin admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe newspapers do have some useful hints in sometimes,\r\nJoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut young Chandler shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBloodhounds ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno use at all! If the Yard was to listen to all the suggestions that\r\nthe last few days have brought in\xe2\x80\x94well, all I can say is our work would\r\nbe cut out for us\xe2\x80\x94not but what it\xe2\x80\x99s cut out for us now, if it comes to\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed ruefully. He was beginning to feel very tired; if only\r\nhe could stay in this pleasant, cosy room listening to Daisy Bunting\r\nreading on and on for ever, instead of having to go out, as he would\r\npresently have to do, into the cold and foggy night!\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler was fast becoming very sick of his new job. There was a\r\nlot of unpleasantness attached to the business, too. Why, even in the\r\nhouse where he lived, and in the little cook-shop where he habitually\r\ntook his meals, the people round him had taken to taunt him with the\r\nremissness of the police. More than that one of his pals, a man he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nalways looked up to, because the young fellow had the gift of the gab,\r\nhad actually been among those who had spoken at the big demonstration\r\nin Victoria Park, making a violent speech, not only against the\r\nCommissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but also against the Home\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nBut Daisy, like most people who believe themselves blessed with the\r\npossession of an accomplishment, had no mind to leave off reading just\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s another notion!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother letter, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPARDON TO ACCOMPLICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR\xe2\x80\x94During the last day or two several of the more Intelligent of\r\nmy acquaintances have suggested that The Avenger, whoever he may be,\r\nmust be known to a certain number of persons. It is impossible that the\r\nperpetrator of such deeds, however nomad he may be in his habits\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I wonder what \xe2\x80\x98nomad\xe2\x80\x99 can be?\xe2\x80\x9d Daisy interrupted herself, and\r\nlooked round at her little audience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always declared the fellow had all his senses about him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Bunting confidently.\r\n\r\nDaisy went on, quite satisfied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94however nomad he may be in his habit; must have some habitat where\r\nhis ways are known to at least one person. Now the person who knows the\r\nterrible secret is evidently withholding information in expectation of\r\na reward, or maybe because, being an accessory after the fact, he or\r\nshe is now afraid of the consequences. My suggestion, Sir, is that the\r\nHome Secretary promise a free pardon. The more so that only thus can\r\nthis miscreant be brought to justice. Unless he was caught red-handed\r\nin the act, it will be exceedingly difficult to trace the crime\r\ncommitted to any individual, for English law looks very askance at\r\ncircumstantial evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something worth listening to in that letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe,\r\nleaning forward.\r\n\r\nNow he was almost touching Daisy, and he smiled involuntarily as she\r\nturned her gay, pretty little face the better to hear what he was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Chandler?\xe2\x80\x9d she said interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, d\xe2\x80\x99you remember that fellow what killed an old gentleman in a\r\nrailway carriage? He took refuge with someone\xe2\x80\x94a woman his mother had\r\nknown, and she kept him hidden for quite a long time. But at last she\r\ngave him up, and she got a big reward, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give anybody up for a reward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting,\r\nin his slow, dogmatic way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you would, Mr. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nonly be doing what it\xe2\x80\x99s the plain duty of everyone\xe2\x80\x94everyone, that is,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s a good citizen. And you\xe2\x80\x99d be getting something for doing it,\r\nwhich is more than most people gets as does their duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man as gives up someone for a reward is no better than a common\r\ninformer,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Bunting obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd no man \xe2\x80\x99ud care to be\r\ncalled that! It\xe2\x80\x99s different for you, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d he added hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\njob to catch those who\xe2\x80\x99ve done anything wrong. And a man\xe2\x80\x99d be a fool\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99d take refuge\xe2\x80\x94like with you. He\xe2\x80\x99d be walking into the lion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting laughed.\r\n\r\nAnd then Daisy broke in coquettishly: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d done anything I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind going for help to Mr. Chandler,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe, with eyes kindling, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And if you did you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid I\xe2\x80\x99d give you up, Miss Daisy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, to their amazement, there suddenly broke from Mrs. Bunting,\r\nsitting with bowed head over the table, an exclamation of impatience\r\nand anger, and, it seemed to those listening, of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen, don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel well?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a spasm, a sharp stitch in my side, like,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the poor\r\nwoman heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\xe2\x80\x94no, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody in the world\r\nwho knows who The Avenger is,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Chandler quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt stands to\r\nreason that anybody\xe2\x80\x99d give him up\xe2\x80\x94in their own interest, if not in\r\nanyone else\xe2\x80\x99s. Who\xe2\x80\x99d shelter such a creature? Why, \xe2\x80\x99twould be dangerous\r\nto have him in the house along with one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s your idea that he\xe2\x80\x99s not responsible for the wicked things he\r\ndoes?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting raised her head, and looked over at Chandler with\r\neager, anxious eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry to think he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t responsible enough to hang!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChandler deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all the trouble he\xe2\x80\x99s been giving us,\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanging\xe2\x80\x99d be too good for that chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if he\xe2\x80\x99s not responsible,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of\r\nanything so cruel\xe2\x80\x94that I never did! If the man\xe2\x80\x99s a madman, he ought to\r\nbe in an asylum\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where he ought to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark to her now!\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting looked at his Ellen with amusement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContrary isn\xe2\x80\x99t the word for her! But there, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed the last few\r\ndays that she seemed to be taking that monster\xe2\x80\x99s part. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\ncomes of being a born total abstainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had got up from her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense you do talk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cNot but what it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing if these murders have\r\nemptied the public-houses of women for a bit. England\xe2\x80\x99s drink is\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s shame\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll never depart from that! Now, Daisy, child, get up,\r\ndo! Put down that paper. We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard quite enough. You can be laying\r\nthe cloth while I goes down the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgetting the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s supper,\xe2\x80\x9d called out\r\nBunting. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth don\xe2\x80\x99t always ring\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he turned to Chandler. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\none thing, he\xe2\x80\x99s often out about this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot often\xe2\x80\x94just now and again, when he wants to buy something,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped\r\nout Mrs. Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t forgot his supper. He never do want it\r\nbefore eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take up the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s supper, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s eager voice broke\r\nin. She had got up in obedience to her stepmother, and was now laying\r\nthe cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not! I told you he only wanted me to wait on him. You have\r\nyour work cut out looking after things down here\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where I wants\r\nyou to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler also got up. Somehow he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be doing nothing while\r\nDaisy was so busy. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking across at Mrs. Bunting, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nforgotten about your lodger. Going on all right, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever knew so quiet and well-behaved a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nturned our luck, did Mr. Sleuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife left the room, and after she had gone Daisy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhardly believe it, Mr. Chandler, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen this wonderful\r\nlodger. Ellen keeps him to herself, that she does! If I was father I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe jealous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth men laughed. Ellen? No, the idea was too funny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is, I think Daisy ought to go. One can\xe2\x80\x99t always do just\r\nwhat one wants to do\xe2\x80\x94not in this world, at any rate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting did not seem to be addressing anyone in particular, though\r\nboth her husband and her stepdaughter were in the room. She was\r\nstanding by the table, staring straight before her, and as she spoke\r\nshe avoided looking at either Bunting or Daisy. There was in her voice\r\na tone of cross decision, of thin finality, with which they were both\r\nacquainted, and to which each listener knew the other would have to\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, then Daisy broke out passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should go if I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll allow\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been useful to you, Ellen? \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t even as if you was quite well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite well\xe2\x80\x94perfectly well!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped out Mrs. Bunting, and she\r\nturned her pale, drawn face, and looked angrily at her stepdaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t often I has a chance of being with you and father.\xe2\x80\x9d There were\r\ntears in Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and Bunting glanced deprecatingly at his wife.\r\n\r\nAn invitation had come to Daisy\xe2\x80\x94an invitation from her own dead\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who was housekeeper in a big house in Belgrave Square.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe family\xe2\x80\x9d had gone away for the Christmas holidays, and Aunt\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x94Daisy was her godchild\xe2\x80\x94had begged that her niece might come\r\nand spend two or three days with her.\r\n\r\nBut the girl had already had more than one taste of what life was like\r\nin the great gloomy basement of 100 Belgrave Square. Aunt Margaret was\r\none of those old-fashioned servants for whom the modern employer is\r\nalways sighing. While \xe2\x80\x9cthe family\xe2\x80\x9d were away it was her joy\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nregarded it as a privilege\xe2\x80\x94to wash sixty-seven pieces of very valuable\r\nchina contained in two cabinets in the drawing-room; she also slept in\r\nevery bed by turns, to keep them all well aired. These were the two\r\nduties with which she intended her young niece to assist her, and\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s soul sickened at the prospect.\r\n\r\nBut the matter had to be settled at once. The letter had come an hour\r\nago, containing a stamped telegraph form, and Aunt Margaret was not one\r\nto be trifled with.\r\n\r\nSince breakfast the three had talked of nothing else, and from the very\r\nfirst Mrs. Bunting had said that Daisy ought to go\xe2\x80\x94that there was no\r\ndoubt about it, that it did not admit of discussion. But discuss it\r\nthey all did, and for once Bunting stood up to his wife. But that, as\r\nwas natural, only made his Ellen harder and more set on her own view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the child says is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you was\r\nquite well. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been took bad twice in the last few days\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny of it, Ellen. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I just take a bus and go over and see\r\nMargaret? I\xe2\x80\x99d tell her just how it is. She\xe2\x80\x99d understand, bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have you doing nothing of the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bunting,\r\nspeaking almost as passionately as her stepdaughter had done. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI a right to be ill, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I a right to be took bad, aye, and to feel\r\nall right again\xe2\x80\x94same as other people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy turned round and clasped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ellen!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nsay that you can\xe2\x80\x99t spare me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go across to that horrid\r\nold dungeon of a place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fair tired of you\r\nboth! There\xe2\x80\x99ll come a day, Daisy, when you\xe2\x80\x99ll know, like me, that money\r\nis the main thing that matters in this world; and when your Aunt\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x99s left her savings to somebody else just because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspend a few days with her this Christmas, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll know what it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike to go without\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll know what a fool you were, and that nothing\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t alter it any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, with victory actually in her grasp, poor Daisy saw it\r\nsnatched from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen is right,\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting said heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney does matter\xe2\x80\x94a terrible\r\ndeal\xe2\x80\x94though I never thought to hear Ellen say \xe2\x80\x99twas the only thing that\r\nmattered. But \xe2\x80\x99twould be foolish\xe2\x80\x94very, very foolish, my girl, to offend\r\nyour Aunt Margaret. It\xe2\x80\x99ll only be two days after all\xe2\x80\x94two days isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nvery long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Daisy did not hear her father\xe2\x80\x99s last words. She had already rushed\r\nfrom the room, and gone down to the kitchen to hide her childish tears\r\nof disappointment\xe2\x80\x94the childish tears which came because she was\r\nbeginning to be a woman, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s natural instinct for building\r\nher own human nest.\r\n\r\nAunt Margaret was not one to tolerate the comings of any strange young\r\nman, and she had a peculiar dislike to the police.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99d ever have thought she\xe2\x80\x99d have minded as much as that!\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting\r\nlooked across at Ellen deprecatingly; already his heart was misgiving\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough why she\xe2\x80\x99s become so fond of us all of a sudden,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Bunting sarcastically. And as her husband stared at her\r\nuncomprehendingly, she added, in a tantalising tone, \xe2\x80\x9cas plain as the\r\nnose on your face, my man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit slow, Ellen, but I\r\nreally don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99d be at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember telling me before Daisy came here that Joe Chandler\r\nhad become sweet on her last summer? I thought it only foolishness\r\nthen, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve come round to your view\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting nodded his head slowly. Yes, Joe had got into the way of coming\r\nvery often, and there had been the expedition to that gruesome Scotland\r\nYard museum, but somehow he, Bunting, had been so interested in the\r\nAvenger murders that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of Joe in any other\r\nconnection\xe2\x80\x94not this time, at any rate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you think Daisy likes him?\xe2\x80\x9d There was an unwonted tone of\r\nexcitement, of tenderness, in Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nHis wife looked over at him; and a thin smile, not an unkindly smile by\r\nany means, lit up her pale face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been one to prophesy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you,\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x94Daisy\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 time to get tired of Joe Chandler\r\nbefore they two are dead. Mark my words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she might do worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting ruminatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as steady\r\nas God makes them, and he\xe2\x80\x99s already earning thirty-two shillings a\r\nweek. But I wonder how Old Aunt\xe2\x80\x99d like the notion? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see her\r\nparting with Daisy before she must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let no old aunt interfere with me about such a thing as\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not for millions of gold!\xe2\x80\x9d And Bunting\r\nlooked at her in silent wonder. Ellen was singing a very different tune\r\nnow to what she\xe2\x80\x99d sung a few minutes ago, when she was so keen about\r\nthe girl going to Belgrave Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she still seems upset while she\xe2\x80\x99s having her dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife\r\nsuddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, you just wait till I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone out for something, and\r\nthen you just say to her, \xe2\x80\x98Absence makes the heart grow fonder\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nthat, and nothing more! She\xe2\x80\x99ll take it from you. And I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsurprised if it comforted her quite a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the matter of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why Joe Chandler shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo over and see her there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, there is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting, smiling shrewdly. \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of\r\nreason. Daisy\xe2\x80\x99ll be a very foolish girl if she allows her aunt to know\r\nany of her secrets. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen that woman once, but I know exactly\r\nthe sort Margaret is. She\xe2\x80\x99s just waiting for Old Aunt to drop off and\r\nthen she\xe2\x80\x99ll want to have Daisy herself\xe2\x80\x94to wait on her, like. She\xe2\x80\x99d turn\r\nquite nasty if she thought there was a young fellow what stood in her\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the clock, the pretty little eight-day clock which had\r\nbeen a wedding present from a kind friend of her last mistress. It had\r\nmysteriously disappeared during their time of trouble, and had as\r\nmysteriously reappeared three or four days after Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve time to go out with that telegram,\xe2\x80\x9d she said briskly\xe2\x80\x94somehow she\r\nfelt better, different to what she had done the last few days\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand then\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll be done. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good having more words about it, and I expect we\r\nshould have plenty more words if I wait till the child comes upstairs\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not speak unkindly, and Bunting looked at her rather\r\nwonderingly. Ellen very seldom spoke of Daisy as \xe2\x80\x9cthe child\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in fact,\r\nhe could only remember her having done so once before, and that was a\r\nlong time ago. They had been talking over their future life together,\r\nand she had said, very solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cBunting, I promise I will do my\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x94as much as lies in my power, that is\xe2\x80\x94by the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ellen had not had much opportunity of doing her duty by Daisy. As\r\nnot infrequently happens with the duties that we are willing to do,\r\nthat particular duty had been taken over by someone else who had no\r\nmind to let it go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do if Mr. Sleuth rings?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting, rather nervously.\r\nIt was the first time since the lodger had come to them that Ellen had\r\noffered to go out in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. In her anxiety to have the matter of Daisy settled, she\r\nhad forgotten Mr. Sleuth. Strange that she should have done so\xe2\x80\x94strange,\r\nand, to herself, very comfortable and pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, you can just go up and knock at the door and say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nback in a few minutes\xe2\x80\x94that I had to go out with a message. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite a\r\nreasonable gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d She went into the back room to put on her bonnet\r\nand thick jacket for it was very cold\xe2\x80\x94getting colder every minute.\r\n\r\nAs she stood, buttoning her gloves\xe2\x80\x94she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone out untidy\r\nfor the world\xe2\x80\x94Bunting suddenly came across to her. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us a kiss, old\r\ngirl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And his wife turned up her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne \xe2\x80\x99ud think it was catching!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but there was a lilt in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting briefly answered. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t that old cook get married\r\njust after us? She\xe2\x80\x99d never \xe2\x80\x99a thought of it if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut once she was out, walking along the damp, uneven pavement, Mr.\r\nSleuth revenged himself for his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s temporary forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two days the lodger had been queer, odder than usual,\r\nunlike himself, or, rather, very much as he had been some ten days ago,\r\njust before that double murder had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe night before, while Daisy was telling all about the dreadful place\r\nto which Joe Chandler had taken her and her father, Mrs. Bunting had\r\nheard Mr. Sleuth moving about overhead, restlessly walking up and down\r\nhis sitting-room. And later, when she took up his supper, she had\r\nlistened a moment outside the door, while he read aloud some of the\r\ntexts his soul delighted in\xe2\x80\x94terrible texts telling of the grim joys\r\nattendant on revenge.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting was so absorbed in her thoughts, so possessed with the\r\ncurious personality of her lodger, that she did not look where she was\r\ngoing, and suddenly a young woman bumped up against her.\r\n\r\nShe started violently and looked round, dazed, as the young person\r\nmuttered a word of apology;\xe2\x80\x94then she again fell into deep thought.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing Daisy was going away for a few days; it made the\r\nproblem of Mr. Sleuth and his queer ways less disturbing. She, Ellen,\r\nwas sorry she had spoken so sharp-like to the girl, but after all it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t wonderful that she had been snappy. This last night she had\r\nhardly slept at all. Instead, she had lain awake listening\xe2\x80\x94and there is\r\nnothing so tiring as to lie awake listening for a sound that never\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nThe house had remained so still you could have heard a pin drop. Mr.\r\nSleuth, lying snug in his nice warm bed upstairs, had not stirred. Had\r\nhe stirred his landlady was bound to have heard him, for his bed was,\r\nas we know, just above hers. No, during those long hours of darkness\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s light, regular breathing was all that had fallen on Mrs.\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\n\r\nAnd then her mind switched off Mr. Sleuth. She made a determined effort\r\nto expel him, to toss him, as it were, out of her thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange that The Avenger had stayed his hand, for, as Joe had\r\nsaid only last evening, it was full time that he should again turn that\r\nawful, mysterious searchlight of his on himself. Mrs. Bunting always\r\nvisioned The Avenger as a black shadow in the centre a bright blinding\r\nlight\xe2\x80\x94but the shadow had no form or definite substance. Sometimes he\r\nlooked like one thing, sometimes like another . . .\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had now come to the corner which led up the street where\r\nthere was a Post Office. But instead of turning sharp to the left she\r\nstopped short for a minute.\r\n\r\nThere had suddenly come over her a feeling of horrible self-rebuke and\r\neven self-loathing. It was dreadful that she, of all women, should have\r\nlonged to hear that another murder had been committed last night!\r\n\r\nYet such was the shameful fact. She had listened all through breakfast\r\nhoping to hear the dread news being shouted outside; yes, and more or\r\nless during the long discussion which had followed on the receipt of\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x99s letter she had been hoping\xe2\x80\x94hoping against hope\xe2\x80\x94that those\r\ndreadful triumphant shouts of the newspaper-sellers still might come\r\nechoing down the Marylebone Road. And yet hypocrite that she was, she\r\nhad reproved Bunting when he had expressed, not disappointment\r\nexactly\xe2\x80\x94but, well, surprise, that nothing had happened last night.\r\n\r\nNow her mind switched off to Joe Chandler. Strange to think how afraid\r\nshe had been of that young man! She was no longer afraid of him, or\r\nhardly at all. He was dotty\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what was the matter with him, dotty\r\nwith love for rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed little Daisy. Anything might now\r\ngo on, right under Joe Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s very nose\xe2\x80\x94but, bless you, he\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nsee it! Last summer, when this affair, this nonsense of young Chandler\r\nand Daisy had begun, she had had very little patience with it all. In\r\nfact, the memory of the way Joe had gone on then, the tiresome way he\r\nwould be always dropping in, had been one reason (though not the most\r\nimportant reason of all) why she had felt so terribly put about at the\r\nidea of the girl coming again. But now? Well, now she had become quite\r\ntolerant, quite kindly\xe2\x80\x94at any rate as far as Joe Chandler was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why.\r\n\r\nStill, \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do Joe a bit of harm not to see the girl for a couple\r\nof days. In fact \xe2\x80\x99twould be a very good thing, for then he\xe2\x80\x99d think of\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x94think of her to the exclusion of all else. Absence does make the\r\nheart grow fonder\xe2\x80\x94at first, at any rate. Mrs. Bunting was well aware of\r\nthat. During the long course of hers and Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s mild courting,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d been separated for about three months, and it was that three\r\nmonths which had made up her mind for her. She had got so used to\r\nBunting that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without him, and she had felt\xe2\x80\x94oddest fact\r\nof all\xe2\x80\x94acutely, miserably jealous. But she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t let him know that\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nfear!\r\n\r\nOf course, Joe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t neglect his job\xe2\x80\x94that would never do. But what a\r\ngood thing it was, after all, that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like some of those\r\ndetective chaps that are written about in stories\xe2\x80\x94the sort of chaps\r\nthat know everything, see everything, guess everything\xe2\x80\x94even where there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to see, or know, or guess!\r\n\r\nWhy, to take only one little fact\xe2\x80\x94Joe Chandler had never shown the\r\nslightest curiosity about their lodger. . . .\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting pulled herself together with a start, and hurried quickly\r\non. Bunting would begin to wonder what had happened to her.\r\n\r\nShe went into the Post Office and handed the form to the young woman\r\nwithout a word. Margaret, a sensible woman, who was accustomed to\r\nmanage other people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, had even written out the words: \xe2\x80\x9cWill be\r\nwith you to tea.\xe2\x80\x94DAISY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to have the thing settled once for all. If anything\r\nhorrible was going to happen in the next two or three days\xe2\x80\x94it was just\r\nas well Daisy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at home. Not that there was any _real_\r\ndanger that anything would happen,\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bunting felt sure of that.\r\n\r\nBy this time she was out in the street again, and she began mentally\r\ncounting up the number of murders The Avenger had committed. Nine, or\r\nwas it ten? Surely by now The Avenger must be avenged? Surely by now,\r\nif\xe2\x80\x94as that writer in the newspaper had suggested\xe2\x80\x94he was a quiet,\r\nblameless gentleman living in the West End, whatever vengeance he had\r\nto wreak, must be satisfied?\r\n\r\nShe began hurrying homewards; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for the lodger to ring\r\nbefore she had got back. Bunting would never know how to manage Mr.\r\nSleuth, especially if Mr. Sleuth was in one of his queer moods.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting put the key into the front door lock and passed into the\r\nhouse. Then her heart stood still with fear and terror. There came the\r\nsound of voices\xe2\x80\x94of voices she thought she did not know\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, and then drew a long breath. It was only Joe\r\nChandler\xe2\x80\x94Joe, Daisy, and Bunting, talking together. They stopped rather\r\nguiltily as she came in, but not before she had heard Chandler utter\r\nthe words: \xe2\x80\x9cThat don\xe2\x80\x99t mean nothing! I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run out and send another\r\nsaying you won\xe2\x80\x99t come, Miss Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the strangest smile came over Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s face. There had\r\nfallen on her ear the still distant, but unmistakable, shouts which\r\nbetokened that something _had_ happened last night\xe2\x80\x94something which made\r\nit worth while for the newspaper-sellers to come crying down the\r\nMarylebone Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joe? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought us news? I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s been another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nas far as I know, that is. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of those newspaper\r\nchaps? They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cry out something,\xe2\x80\x9d he grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nthought folk was so bloodthirsty. They\xe2\x80\x99re just shouting out that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s been an arrest; but we don\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock of that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nScotchman what gave himself up last night at Dorking. He\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\ndrinking, and was a-pitying of himself. Why, since this business began,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s been about twenty arrests, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve all come to nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen, you looks quite sad, quite disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\njokingly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to think of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s high time The Avenger was at work\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed as he made his grim joke. Then turned to young\r\nChandler: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you\xe2\x80\x99ll_ be glad when its all over, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad in a way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler unwillingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one \xe2\x80\x99ud have liked to\r\nhave caught him. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to know such a creature\xe2\x80\x99s at large,\r\nnow, does one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had taken off her bonnet and jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cI must just go and\r\nsee about Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a weary, dispirited\r\nvoice, and left them there.\r\n\r\nShe felt disappointed, and very, very depressed. As to the plot which\r\nhad been hatching when she came in, that had no chance of success;\r\nBunting would never dare let Daisy send out another telegram\r\ncontradicting the first. Besides, Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s stepmother shrewdly suspected\r\nthat by now the girl herself wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to do such a thing. Daisy\r\nhad plenty of sense tucked away somewhere in her pretty little head. If\r\nit ever became her fate to live as a married woman in London, it would\r\nbe best to stay on the right side of Aunt Margaret.\r\n\r\nAnd when she came into her kitchen the stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s heart became very\r\nsoft, for Daisy had got everything beautifully ready. In fact, there\r\nwas nothing to do but to boil Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s two eggs. Feeling suddenly\r\nmore cheerful than she had felt of late, Mrs. Bunting took the tray\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was rather late, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for you to ring, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd the lodger looked up from the table where, as usual, he was\r\nstudying with painful, almost agonising intentness, the Book. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite\r\nright, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94quite right! I have been pondering over the\r\ncommand, \xe2\x80\x98Work while it is yet light.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and a queer, cold feeling stole over her heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The spirit is willing, but the flesh\xe2\x80\x94the flesh is weak,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nSleuth, with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou studies too hard, and too long\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s ailing you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Bunting went down again she found that a great deal had been\r\nsettled in her absence; among other things, that Joe Chandler was going\r\nto escort Miss Daisy across to Belgrave Square. He could carry Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmodest bag, and if they wanted to ride instead of walk, why, they could\r\ntake the bus from Baker Street Station to Victoria\xe2\x80\x94that would land them\r\nvery near Belgrave Square.\r\n\r\nBut Daisy seemed quite willing to walk; she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a walk, she\r\ndeclared, for a long, long time\xe2\x80\x94and then she blushed rosy red, and even\r\nher stepmother had to admit to herself that Daisy was very nice\r\nlooking, not at all the sort of girl who ought to be allowed to go\r\nabout the London streets by herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s father and stepmother stood side by side at the front door,\r\nwatching the girl and young Chandler walk off into the darkness.\r\n\r\nA yellow pall of fog had suddenly descended on London, and Joe had come\r\na full half-hour before they expected him, explaining, rather lamely,\r\nthat it was the fog which had brought him so soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we was to have waited much longer, perhaps, \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\npossible to walk a yard,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, and they had accepted,\r\nsilently, his explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s quite safe sending her off like that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting looked\r\ndeprecatingly at his wife. She had already told him more than once that\r\nhe was too fussy about Daisy, that about his daughter he was like an\r\nold hen with her last chicken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s safer than she would be, with you or me. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a\r\nsmarter young fellow to look after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be awful thick at Hyde Park Corner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nworse there than anywhere else. If I was Joe I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a taken her by the\r\nUnderground Railway to Victoria\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x99ud been the best way, considering\r\nthe weather \xe2\x80\x99tis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of the weather, bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll walk and walk as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s a glimmer left for \xe2\x80\x99em to\r\nsteer by. Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s just been pining to have a walk with that young chap.\r\nI wonder you didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice how disappointed they both were when you was\r\nso set on going along with them to that horrid place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you really mean that, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting looked upset. \xe2\x80\x9cI understood\r\nJoe to say he liked my company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect he liked it just\r\nabout as much as we liked the company of that old cook who would go out\r\nwith us when we was courting. It always was a wonder to me how the\r\nwoman could force herself upon two people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s father; and an old friend of Chandler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\nremonstratingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite different from that cook. She was nothing\r\nto us, and we was nothing to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d have liked to be something to you, I make no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nhis Ellen, shaking her head, and her husband smiled, a little\r\nfoolishly.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were back in their nice, cosy sitting-room, and a\r\nfeeling of not altogether unpleasant lassitude stole over Mrs. Bunting.\r\nIt was a comfort to have Daisy out of her way for a bit. The girl, in\r\nsome ways, was very wide awake and inquisitive, and she had early\r\nbetrayed what her stepmother thought to be a very unseemly and silly\r\ncuriosity concerning the lodger. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might just let me have one peep\r\nat him, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d she had pleaded, only that morning. But Ellen had\r\nshaken her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I won\xe2\x80\x99t! He\xe2\x80\x99s a very quiet gentleman; but he\r\nknows exactly what he likes, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t like anyone but me waiting on\r\nhim. Why, even your father\xe2\x80\x99s hardly seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that, naturally, had only increased Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s desire to view Mr.\r\nSleuth.\r\n\r\nThere was another reason why Mrs. Bunting was glad that her\r\nstepdaughter had gone away for two days. During her absence young\r\nChandler was far less likely to haunt them in the way he had taken to\r\ndoing lately, the more so that, in spite of what she had said to her\r\nhusband, Mrs. Bunting felt sure that Daisy would ask Joe Chandler to\r\ncall at Belgrave Square. \xe2\x80\x99Twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be human nature\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, not\r\ngirlish human nature\xe2\x80\x94not to do so, even if Joe\xe2\x80\x99s coming did anger Aunt\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\nYes, it was pretty safe that with Daisy away they, the Buntings, would\r\nbe rid of that young chap for a bit, and that would be a good thing.\r\n\r\nWhen Daisy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to occupy the whole of his attention, Mrs.\r\nBunting felt queerly afraid of Chandler. After all, he was a\r\ndetective\xe2\x80\x94it was his job to be always nosing about, trying to find out\r\nthings. And, though she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fairly say to herself that he had done\r\nmuch of that sort of thing in her house, he might start doing it any\r\nminute. And then\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94where would she, and\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Sleuth, be?\r\n\r\nShe thought of the bottle of red ink\xe2\x80\x94of the leather bag which must be\r\nhidden somewhere\xe2\x80\x94and her heart almost stopped beating. Those were the\r\nsort of things which, in the stories Bunting was so fond of reading,\r\nalways led to the detection of famous criminals. . . .\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bell for tea rang that afternoon far earlier than usual.\r\nThe fog had probably misled him, and made him think it later than it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nWhen she went up, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like a cup of tea now, and just one piece of\r\nbread-and-butter,\xe2\x80\x9d the lodger said wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like having\r\nanything else this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible day,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting observed, in a cheerier voice than\r\nusual. \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel hungry, sir. And then it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so very\r\nlong since you had your dinner, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said absently. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went down, made the tea, and brought it up again. And then, as she\r\ncame into the room, she uttered an exclamation of sharp dismay.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth was dressed for going out. He was wearing his long Inverness\r\ncloak, and his queer old high hat lay on the table, ready for him to\r\nput on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re never going out this afternoon, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked falteringly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fog\xe2\x80\x99s awful; you can\xe2\x80\x99t see a yard ahead of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnknown to herself, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s voice had risen almost to a scream.\r\nShe moved back, still holding the tray, and stood between the door and\r\nher lodger, as if she meant to bar his way\xe2\x80\x94to erect between Mr. Sleuth\r\nand the dark, foggy world outside a living barrier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weather never affects me at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sullenly; and he looked\r\nat her with so wild and pleading a look in his eyes that, slowly,\r\nreluctantly, she moved aside. As she did so she noticed for the first\r\ntime that Mr. Sleuth held something in his right hand. It was the key\r\nof the chiffonnier cupboard. He had been on his way there when her\r\ncoming in had disturbed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you to be so concerned about me,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94but, Mrs. Bunting, you must excuse me if I say that I do not\r\nwelcome such solicitude. I prefer to be left alone. I\xe2\x80\x94I cannot stay in\r\nyour house if I feel that my comings and goings are watched\xe2\x80\x94spied\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pulled herself together. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one spies upon you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith considerable dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best to satisfy you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have\xe2\x80\x94you have!\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke in a distressed, apologetic tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou spoke just now as if you were trying to prevent my doing what I\r\nwish to do\xe2\x80\x94indeed, what I have to do. For years I have been\r\nmisunderstood\xe2\x80\x94persecuted\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he waited a moment, then in a hollow voice\r\nadded the one word, \xe2\x80\x9ctortured! Do not tell me that you are going to add\r\nyourself to the number of my tormentors, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be that,\r\nsir. I only spoke as I did because\xe2\x80\x94well, sir, because I thought it\r\nreally wasn\xe2\x80\x99t safe for a gentleman to go out this afternoon. Why,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s hardly anyone about, though we\xe2\x80\x99re so near Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked across to the window and looked out. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fog is clearing\r\nsomewhat; Mrs. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d but there was no relief in his voice, rather\r\nwas there disappointment and dread.\r\n\r\nPlucking up courage, she followed him. Yes, Mr. Sleuth was right. The\r\nfog was lifting\xe2\x80\x94rolling off in that sudden, mysterious way in which\r\nlocal fogs sometimes do lift in London.\r\n\r\nHe turned sharply from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cOur conversation has made me forget\r\nan important thing, Mrs. Bunting. I should be glad if you would just\r\nleave out a glass of milk and some bread-and-butter for me this\r\nevening. I shall not require supper when I come in, for after my walk I\r\nshall probably go straight upstairs to carry through a very difficult\r\nexperiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Mrs. Bunting left the lodger.\r\n\r\nBut when she found herself downstairs in the fog-laden hall, for it had\r\ndrifted in as she and her husband had stood at the door seeing Daisy\r\noff, instead of going in to Bunting she did a very odd thing\xe2\x80\x94a thing\r\nshe had never thought of doing in her life before. She pressed her hot\r\nforehead against the cool bit of looking-glass let into the\r\nhat-and-umbrella stand. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned to\r\nherself, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut though she felt that her secret suspense and trouble was becoming\r\nintolerable, the one way in which she could have ended her misery never\r\noccurred to Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\nIn the long history of crime it has very, very seldom happened that a\r\nwoman has betrayed one who has taken refuge with her. The timorous and\r\ncautious woman has not infrequently hunted a human being fleeing from\r\nhis pursuer from her door, but she has not revealed the fact that he\r\nwas ever there. In fact, it may almost be said that such betrayal has\r\nnever taken place unless the betrayer has been actuated by love of\r\ngain, or by a longing for revenge. So far, perhaps because she is\r\nsubject rather than citizen, her duty as a component part of civilised\r\nsociety weighs but lightly on woman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd then\xe2\x80\x94and then, in a sort of way, Mrs. Bunting had become attached\r\nto Mr. Sleuth. A wan smile would sometimes light up his sad face when\r\nhe saw her come in with one of his meals, and when this happened Mrs.\r\nBunting felt pleased\xe2\x80\x94pleased and vaguely touched. In between\r\nthose\xe2\x80\x94those dreadful events outside, which filled her with such\r\nsuspicion, such anguish and such suspense, she never felt any fear,\r\nonly pity, for Mr. Sleuth.\r\n\r\nOften and often, when lying wide awake at night, she turned over the\r\nstrange problem in her mind. After all, the lodger must have lived\r\n_somewhere_ during his forty-odd years of life. She did not even know\r\nif Mr. Sleuth had any brothers or sisters; friends she knew he had\r\nnone. But, however odd and eccentric he was, he had evidently, or so\r\nshe supposed, led a quiet, undistinguished kind of life, till\xe2\x80\x94till now.\r\n\r\nWhat had made him alter all of a sudden\xe2\x80\x94if, that is, he had altered?\r\nThat was what Mrs. Bunting was always debating fitfully with herself;\r\nand, what was more, and very terribly, to the point, having altered,\r\nwhy should he not in time go back to what he evidently had been\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, a blameless, quiet gentleman?\r\n\r\nIf only he would! If only he would!\r\n\r\nAs she stood in the hall, cooling her hot forehead, all these thoughts,\r\nthese hopes and fears, jostled at lightning speed through her brain.\r\n\r\nShe remembered what young Chandler had said the other day\xe2\x80\x94that there\r\nhad never been, in the history of the world, so strange a murderer as\r\nThe Avenger had proved himself to be.\r\n\r\nShe and Bunting, aye, and little Daisy too, had hung, fascinated, on\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s words, as he had told them of other famous series of murders\r\nwhich had taken place in the past, not only in England but\r\nabroad\xe2\x80\x94especially abroad.\r\n\r\nOne woman, whom all the people round her believed to be a kind,\r\nrespectable soul, had poisoned no fewer than fifteen people in order to\r\nget their insurance money. Then there had been the terrible tale of an\r\napparently respectable, contented innkeeper and his wife, who, living\r\nat the entrance to a wood, killed all those humble travellers who took\r\nshelter under their roof, simply for their clothes, and any valuables\r\nthey possessed. But in all those stories the murderer or murderers\r\nalways had a very strong motive, the motive being, in almost every\r\ncase, a wicked lust for gold.\r\n\r\nAt last, after having passed her handkerchief over her forehead, she\r\nwent into the room where Bunting was sitting smoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fog\xe2\x80\x99s lifting a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in an ill-assured voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nthat by this time Daisy and that Joe Chandler are right out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the other shook his head silently. \xe2\x80\x9cNo such luck!\xe2\x80\x9d he said briefly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like in Hyde Park, Ellen. I expect \xe2\x80\x99twill\r\nsoon be just as heavy here as \xe2\x80\x99twas half an hour ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wandered over to the window, and pulled the curtain back. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite a\r\nlot of people have come out, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a fine Christmas show in the Edgware Road. I was thinking of\r\nasking if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to go along there with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said dully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite content to stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was listening\xe2\x80\x94listening for the sounds which would betoken that the\r\nlodger was coming downstairs.\r\n\r\nAt last she heard the cautious, stuffless tread of his rubber-soled\r\nshoes shuffling along the hall. But Bunting only woke to the fact when\r\nthe front door shut to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s never Mr. Sleuth going out?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned on his wife, startled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the poor gentleman\xe2\x80\x99ll come to harm\xe2\x80\x94that he will! One has to be\r\nwide awake on an evening like this. I hope he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken any of his\r\nmoney out with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s been out in a fog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBunting sombrely.\r\n\r\nSomehow she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help uttering these over-true words. And then she\r\nturned, eager and half frightened, to see how Bunting had taken what\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nBut he looked quite placid, as if he had hardly heard her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget the good old fogs we used to get\xe2\x80\x94not what people used to call\r\n\xe2\x80\x98London particulars.\xe2\x80\x99 I expect the lodger feels like Mrs. Crowley\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\noften told you about her, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting nodded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crowley had been one of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s ladies, one of those he had\r\nliked best\xe2\x80\x94a cheerful, jolly lady, who used often to give her servants\r\nwhat she called a treat. It was seldom the kind of treat they would\r\nhave chosen for themselves, but still they appreciated her kind\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Crowley used to say,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Bunting, in his slow, dogmatic way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat she never minded how bad the weather was in London, so long as it\r\nwas London and not the country. Mr. Crowley, he liked the country best,\r\nbut Mrs. Crowley always felt dull-like there. Fog never kept her from\r\ngoing out\xe2\x80\x94no, that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit afraid. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he turned\r\nround and looked at his wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am a bit surprised at Mr. Sleuth. I\r\nshould have thought him a timid kind of gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment, and she felt forced to answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly call him timid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\nis very quiet, certainly. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he dislikes going out when there\r\nare a lot of people bustling about the streets. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe out long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hoped with all her soul that Mr. Sleuth would be in very soon\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhe would be daunted by the now increasing gloom.\r\n\r\nSomehow she did not feel she could sit still for very long. She got up,\r\nand went over to the farthest window.\r\n\r\nThe fog had lifted, certainly. She could see the lamp-lights on the\r\nother side of the Marylebone Road, glimmering redly; and shadowy\r\nfigures were hurrying past, mostly making their way towards the Edgware\r\nRoad, to see the Christmas shops.\r\n\r\nAt last to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s relief, Bunting got up too. He went over to the\r\ncupboard where he kept his little store of books, and took one out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll read a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSeems a long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlooked at a book. The papers was so jolly interesting for a bit, but\r\nnow there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife remained silent. She knew what he meant. A good many days had\r\ngone by since the last two Avenger murders, and the papers had very\r\nlittle to say about them that they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said in different language a\r\ndozen times before.\r\n\r\nShe went into her bedroom and came back with a bit of plain sewing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting was fond of sewing, and Bunting liked to see her so\r\nengaged. Since Mr. Sleuth had come to be their lodger she had not had\r\nmuch time for that sort of work.\r\n\r\nIt was funny how quiet the house was without either Daisy, or\xe2\x80\x94or the\r\nlodger, in it.\r\n\r\nAt last she let her needle remain idle, and the bit of cambric slipped\r\ndown on her knee, while she listened, longingly, for Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nAnd as the minutes sped by she fell to wondering with a painful wonder\r\nif she would ever see her lodger again, for, from what she knew of Mr.\r\nSleuth, Mrs. Bunting felt sure that if he got into any kind of\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\ntrouble outside, he would never betray where he had lived during the\r\nlast few weeks.\r\n\r\nNo, in such a case the lodger would disappear in as sudden a way as he\r\nhad come. And Bunting would never suspect, would never know, until,\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94God, what a horrible thought\xe2\x80\x94a picture published in some\r\nnewspaper might bring a certain dreadful fact to Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut if that happened\xe2\x80\x94if that unthinkably awful thing came to pass, she\r\nmade up her mind, here and now, never to say anything. She also would\r\npretend to be amazed, shocked, unutterably horrified at the astounding\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is at last, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it, Ellen. \xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t a night you\r\nwould wish a dog to be out in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s voice was full of relief, but he did not turn round and look\r\nat his wife as he spoke; instead, he continued to read the evening\r\npaper he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe was still close to the fire, sitting back comfortably in his nice\r\narm-chair. He looked very well\xe2\x80\x94well and ruddy. Mrs. Bunting stared\r\nacross at him with a touch of sharp envy, nay, more, of resentment. And\r\nthis was very curious, for she was, in her own dry way, very fond of\r\nBunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so nervous about him; Mr. Sleuth can look out for\r\nhimself all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting laid the paper he had been reading down on his knee. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink why he wanted to go out in such weather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business, Bunting, now, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s true enough. Still, \xe2\x80\x99twould be a very bad thing for us if\r\nanything happened to him. This lodger\xe2\x80\x99s the first bit of luck we\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nfor a terrible long time, Ellen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting moved a little impatiently in her high chair. She remained\r\nsilent for a moment. What Bunting had said was too obvious to be worth\r\nanswering. Also she was listening, following in imagination her\r\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s quick, singularly quiet progress\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstealthy\xe2\x80\x9d she called it to\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94through the fog-filled, lamp-lit hall. Yes, now he was going up\r\nthe staircase. What was that Bunting was saying?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t safe for decent folk to be out in such weather\xe2\x80\x94no, that it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t, not unless they have something to do that won\xe2\x80\x99t wait till\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker was looking straight into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s narrow,\r\ncolourless face. Bunting was an obstinate man, and liked to prove\r\nhimself right. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a good mind to speak to him about it, that I have!\r\nHe ought to be told that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t safe\xe2\x80\x94not for the sort of man he is\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe wandering about the streets at night. I read you out the accidents\r\nin _Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s_\xe2\x80\x94shocking, they were, and all brought about by the fog! And\r\nthen, that horrid monster \xe2\x80\x99ull soon be at his work again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonster?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting absently.\r\n\r\nShe was trying to hear the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps overhead. She was very\r\ncurious to know whether he had gone into his nice sitting-room, or\r\nstraight upstairs, to that cold experiment-room, as he now always\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\nBut her husband went on as if he had not heard her, and she gave up\r\ntrying to listen to what was going on above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be very pleasant to run up against such a party as that in\r\nthe fog, eh, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if the notion had a certain pleasant\r\nthrill in it after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat stuff you do talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting sharply. And then she got\r\nup. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s remarks had disturbed her. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they talk of\r\nsomething pleasant when they did have a quiet bit of time together?\r\n\r\nBunting looked down again at his paper, and she moved quietly about the\r\nroom. Very soon it would be time for supper, and to-night she was going\r\nto cook her husband a nice piece of toasted cheese. That fortunate man,\r\nas she was fond of telling him, with mingled contempt and envy, had the\r\ndigestion of an ostrich, and yet he was rather fanciful, as gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants who have lived in good places often are.\r\n\r\nYes, Bunting was very lucky in the matter of his digestion. Mrs.\r\nBunting prided herself on having a nice mind, and she would never have\r\nallowed an unrefined word\xe2\x80\x94such a word as \xe2\x80\x9cstomach,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, to\r\nsay nothing of an even plainer term\xe2\x80\x94to pass her lips, except, of\r\ncourse, to a doctor in a sick-room.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady did not go down at once into her cold kitchen;\r\ninstead, with a sudden furtive movement, she opened the door leading\r\ninto her bedroom, and then, closing the door quietly, stepped back into\r\nthe darkness, and stood motionless, listening.\r\n\r\nAt first she heard nothing, but gradually there stole on her listening\r\nears the sound of someone moving softly about in the room just\r\noverhead, that is, in Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. But, try as she might, it\r\nwas impossible for her to guess what the lodger was doing.\r\n\r\nAt last she heard him open the door leading out on the little landing.\r\nShe could hear the stairs creaking. That meant, no doubt, that Mr.\r\nSleuth would pass the rest of the evening in the cheerless room above.\r\nHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spent any time up there for quite a long while\xe2\x80\x94in fact, not\r\nfor nearly ten days. \xe2\x80\x99Twas odd he chose to-night, when it was so foggy,\r\nto carry out an experiment.\r\n\r\nShe groped her way to a chair and sat down. She felt very\r\ntired\xe2\x80\x94strangely tired, as if she had gone through some great physical\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nYes, it was true that Mr. Sleuth had brought her and Bunting luck, and\r\nit was wrong, very wrong, of her ever to forget that.\r\n\r\nAs she sat there she also reminded herself, and not for the first time,\r\nwhat the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s departure would mean. It would almost certainly mean\r\nruin; just as his staying meant all sorts of good things, of which\r\nphysical comfort was the least. If Mr. Sleuth stayed on with them, as\r\nhe showed every intention of doing, it meant respectability, and, above\r\nall, security.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting thought of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s money. He never received a letter,\r\nand yet he must have some kind of income\xe2\x80\x94so much was clear. She\r\nsupposed he went and drew his money, in sovereigns, out of a bank as he\r\nrequired it.\r\n\r\nHer mind swung round, consciously, deliberately, away from Mr. Sleuth.\r\n\r\nThe Avenger? What a strange name! Again she assured herself that there\r\nwould come a time when The Avenger, whoever he was, must feel satiated;\r\nwhen he would feel himself to be, so to speak, avenged.\r\n\r\nTo go back to Mr. Sleuth; it was lucky that the lodger seemed so\r\npleased, not only with the rooms, but with his landlord and\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x94indeed, there was no real reason why Mr. Sleuth should ever\r\nwish to leave such nice lodgings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting suddenly stood up. She made a strong effort, and shook off\r\nher awful sense of apprehension and unease. Feeling for the handle of\r\nthe door giving into the passage she turned it, and then, with light,\r\nfirm steps, she went down into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen they had first taken the house, the basement had been made by her\r\ncare, if not into a pleasant, then, at any rate, into a very clean\r\nplace. She had had it whitewashed, and against the still white walls\r\nthe gas stove loomed up, a great square of black iron and bright steel.\r\nIt was a large gas-stove, the kind for which one pays four shillings a\r\nquarter rent to the gas company, and here, in the kitchen, there was no\r\nfoolish shilling-in-the-slot arrangement. Mrs. Bunting was too shrewd a\r\nwoman to have anything to do with that kind of business. There was a\r\nproper gas-meter, and she paid for what she consumed after she had\r\nconsumed it.\r\n\r\nPutting her candle down on the well-scrubbed wooden table, she turned\r\nup the gas-jet, and blew out the candle.\r\n\r\nThen, lighting one of the gas-rings, she put a frying-pan on the stove,\r\nand once more her mind reverted, as if in spite of herself, to Mr.\r\nSleuth. Never had there been a more confiding or trusting gentleman\r\nthan the lodger, and yet in some ways he was so secret, so\xe2\x80\x94so peculiar.\r\n\r\nShe thought of the bag\xe2\x80\x94that bag which had rumbled about so queerly in\r\nthe chiffonnier. Something seemed to tell her that tonight the lodger\r\nhad taken that bag out with him.\r\n\r\nAnd then she thrust away the thought of the bag almost violently from\r\nher mind, and went back to the more agreeable thought of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincome, and of how little trouble he gave. Of course, the lodger was\r\neccentric, otherwise he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be their lodger at all\xe2\x80\x94he would be\r\nliving in quite a different sort of way with some of his relations, or\r\nwith a friend in his own class.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts galloped disconnectedly through her mind, Mrs.\r\nBunting went on with her cooking, preparing the cheese, cutting it up\r\ninto little shreds, carefully measuring out the butter, doing\r\neverything, as was always her way, with a certain delicate and cleanly\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nAnd then, while in the middle of toasting the bread on which was to be\r\npoured the melted cheese, she suddenly heard sounds which startled her,\r\nmade her feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nShuffling, hesitating steps were creaking down the house.\r\n\r\nShe looked up and listened.\r\n\r\nSurely the lodger was not going out again into the cold and foggy\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94going out, as he had done the other evening, for a second time?\r\nBut no; the sounds she heard, the sounds of now familiar footsteps, did\r\nnot continue down the passage leading to the front door.\r\n\r\nInstead\xe2\x80\x94Why, what was this she heard now? She began to listen so\r\nintently that the bread she was holding at the end of the toasting-fork\r\ngrew quite black. With a start she became aware that this was so, and\r\nshe frowned, vexed with herself. That came of not attending to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth was evidently about to do what he had never yet done. He was\r\ncoming down into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the thudding sounds, treading heavily on the\r\nkitchen stairs, and Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat as if in\r\nresponse. She put out the flame of the gas-ring, unheedful of the fact\r\nthat the cheese would stiffen and spoil in the cold air.\r\n\r\nThen she turned and faced the door.\r\n\r\nThere came a fumbling at the handle, and a moment later the door\r\nopened, and revealed, as she had at once known and feared it would do,\r\nthe lodger.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth looked even odder than usual. He was clad in a plaid\r\ndressing-gown, which she had never seen him wear before, though she\r\nknew that he had purchased it not long after his arrival. In his hand\r\nwas a lighted candle.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the kitchen all lighted up, and the woman standing in it,\r\nthe lodger looked inexplicably taken aback, almost aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir? What can I do for you, sir? I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t ring, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting held her ground in front of the stove. Mr. Sleuth had no\r\nbusiness to come like this into her kitchen, and she intended to let\r\nhim know that such was her view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ring,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow you were here, Mrs. Bunting. Please excuse my costume. My\r\ngas-stove has gone wrong, or, rather, that shilling-in-the-slot\r\narrangement has done so. So I came down to see if you had a gas-stove.\r\nI am going to ask you to allow me to use it to-night for an important\r\nexperiment I wish to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating quickly\xe2\x80\x94quickly. She felt horribly\r\ntroubled, unnaturally so. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s experiment wait\r\ntill the morning? She stared at him dubiously, but there was that in\r\nhis face that made her at once afraid and pitiful. It was a wild,\r\neager, imploring look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly, sir; but you will find it very cold down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems most pleasantly warm,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, his voice full of relief,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwarm and cosy, after my cold room upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWarm and cosy? Mrs. Bunting stared at him in amazement. Nay, even that\r\ncheerless room at the top of the house must be far warmer and more cosy\r\nthan this cold underground kitchen could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a fire, sir. We never use the grate, but it\xe2\x80\x99s in perfect\r\norder, for the first thing I did after I came into the house was to\r\nhave the chimney swept. It was terribly dirty. It might have set the\r\nhouse on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s housewifely instincts were roused. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nthe matter of that, you ought to have a fire in your bedroom this cold\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means\xe2\x80\x94I would prefer not. I certainly do not want a fire there.\r\nI dislike an open fire, Mrs. Bunting. I thought I had told you as\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth frowned. He stood there, a strange-looking figure, his\r\ncandle still alight, just inside the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t be very long, sir. Just about a quarter of an hour. You could\r\ncome down then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have everything quite tidy for you. Is there\r\nanything I can do to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not require the use of your kitchen yet\xe2\x80\x94thank you all the same,\r\nMrs. Bunting. I shall come down later\xe2\x80\x94altogether later\xe2\x80\x94after you and\r\nyour husband have gone to bed. But I should be much obliged if you\r\nwould see that the gas people come to-morrow and put my stove in order.\r\nIt might be done while I am out. That the shilling-in-the-slot machine\r\nshould go wrong is very unpleasant. It has upset me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Bunting could put it right for you, sir. For the matter of\r\nthat, I could ask him to go up now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of that sort done to-night. Besides, he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it right. I am something of an expert, Mrs. Bunting, and I\r\nhave done all I could. The cause of the trouble is quite simple. The\r\nmachine is choked up with shillings; a very foolish plan, so I always\r\nfelt it to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth spoke pettishly, with far more heat than he was wont to\r\nspeak, but Mrs. Bunting sympathised with him in this matter. She had\r\nalways suspected that those slot machines were as dishonest as if they\r\nwere human. It was dreadful, the way they swallowed up the shillings!\r\nShe had had one once, so she knew.\r\n\r\nAnd as if he were divining her thoughts, Mr. Sleuth walked forward and\r\nstared at the stove. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a slot machine?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad of that, for I expect my experiment will\r\ntake some time. But, of course, I shall pay you something for the use\r\nof the stove, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of charging you anything for that. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t use our stove very much, you know, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m never in the kitchen\r\na minute longer than I can help this cold weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting was beginning to feel better. When she was actually in Mr.\r\nSleuth\xe2\x80\x99s presence her morbid fears would be lulled, perhaps because his\r\nmanner almost invariably was gentle and very quiet. But still there\r\ncame over her an eerie feeling, as, with him preceding her, they made a\r\nslow progress to the ground floor.\r\n\r\nOnce there, the lodger courteously bade his landlady good-night, and\r\nproceeded upstairs to his own apartments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting returned to the kitchen. Again she lighted the stove; but\r\nshe felt unnerved, afraid of she knew not what. As she was cooking the\r\ncheese, she tried to concentrate her mind on what she was doing, and on\r\nthe whole she succeeded. But another part of her mind seemed to be\r\nworking independently, asking her insistent questions.\r\n\r\nThe place seemed to her alive with alien presences, and once she caught\r\nherself listening\xe2\x80\x94which was absurd, for, of course, she could not hope\r\nto hear what Mr. Sleuth was doing two, if not three, flights upstairs.\r\nShe wondered in what the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s experiments consisted. It was odd\r\nthat she had never been able to discover what it was he really did with\r\nthat big gas-stove. All she knew was that he used a very high degree of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buntings went to bed early that night. But Mrs. Bunting made up her\r\nmind to keep awake. She was set upon knowing at what hour of the night\r\nthe lodger would come down into her kitchen to carry through his\r\nexperiment, and, above all, she was anxious to know how long he would\r\nstay there.\r\n\r\nBut she had had a long and a very anxious day, and presently she fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe church clock hard by struck two, and, suddenly Mrs. Bunting awoke.\r\nShe felt put out, sharply annoyed with herself. How could she have\r\ndropped off like that? Mr. Sleuth must have been down and up again\r\nhours ago!\r\n\r\nThen, gradually, she became aware that there was a faint acrid odour in\r\nthe room. Elusive, intangible, it yet seemed to encompass her and the\r\nsnoring man by her side, almost as a vapour might have done.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting sat up in bed and sniffed; and then, in spite of the cold,\r\nshe quietly crept out of her nice, warm bedclothes, and crawled along\r\nto the bottom of the bed. When there, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady did a very\r\ncurious thing; she leaned over the brass rail and put her face close to\r\nthe hinge of the door giving into the hall. Yes, it was from here that\r\nthis strange, horrible odor was coming; the smell must be very strong\r\nin the passage.\r\n\r\nAs, shivering, she crept back under the bedclothes, she longed to give\r\nher sleeping husband a good shake, and in fancy she heard herself\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cBunting, get up! There\xe2\x80\x99s something strange and dreadful going\r\non downstairs which we ought to know about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as she lay there, by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s side, listening with painful\r\nintentness for the slightest sound, she knew very well that she would\r\ndo nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nWhat if the lodger did make a certain amount of mess\xe2\x80\x94a certain amount\r\nof smell\xe2\x80\x94in her nice clean kitchen? Was he not\xe2\x80\x94was he not an almost\r\nperfect lodger? If they did anything to upset him, where could they\r\never hope to get another like him?\r\n\r\nThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck before Mrs. Bunting heard slow, heavy steps\r\ncreaking up the kitchen stairs. But Mr. Sleuth did not go straight up\r\nto his own quarters, as she had expected him to do. Instead, he went to\r\nthe front door, and, opening it, put on the chain. Then he came past\r\nher door, and she thought\xe2\x80\x94but could not be sure\xe2\x80\x94that he sat down on the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten minutes or so she heard him go down the passage\r\nagain. Very softly he closed the front door. By then she had divined\r\nwhy the lodger had behaved in this funny fashion. He wanted to get the\r\nstrong, acrid smell of burning\xe2\x80\x94was it of burning wool?\xe2\x80\x94out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting, lying there in the darkness, listening to the lodger\r\ncreeping upstairs, felt as if she herself would never get rid of the\r\nhorrible odour.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting felt herself to be all smell.\r\n\r\nAt last the unhappy woman fell into a deep, troubled sleep; and then\r\nshe dreamed a most terrible and unnatural dream. Hoarse voices seemed\r\nto be shouting in her ear: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger close here! The Avenger close\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Orrible murder off the Edgware Road!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger at his work\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd even in her dream Mrs. Bunting felt angered\xe2\x80\x94angered and impatient.\r\nShe knew so well why she was being disturbed by this horrid nightmare!\r\nIt was because of Bunting\xe2\x80\x94Bunting, who could think and talk of nothing\r\nelse than those frightful murders, in which only morbid and\r\nvulgar-minded people took any interest.\r\n\r\nWhy, even now, in her dream, she could hear her husband speaking to her\r\nabout it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so she heard Bunting murmur in her ear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEllen, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\njust going to get up to get a paper. It\xe2\x80\x99s after seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shouting\xe2\x80\x94nay, worse, the sound of tramping, hurrying feet smote on\r\nher shrinking ears. Pushing back her hair off her forehead with both\r\nhands, she sat up and listened.\r\n\r\nIt had been no nightmare, then, but something infinitely worse\xe2\x80\x94reality.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Bunting have lain quiet abed for awhile longer, and let\r\nhis poor wife go on dreaming? The most awful dream would have been\r\neasier to bear than this awakening.\r\n\r\nShe heard her husband go to the front door, and, as he bought the\r\npaper, exchange a few excited words with the newspaper-seller. Then he\r\ncame back. There was a pause, and she heard him lighting the gas-ring\r\nin the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nBunting always made his wife a cup of tea in the morning. He had\r\npromised to do this when they first married, and he had never yet\r\nbroken his word. It was a very little thing and a very usual thing, no\r\ndoubt, for a kind husband to do, but this morning the knowledge that he\r\nwas doing it brought tears to Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s pale blue eyes. This\r\nmorning he seemed to be rather longer than usual over the job.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, he came in with the little tray, Bunting found his wife\r\nlying with her face to the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your tea, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and there was a thrill of eager, nay\r\nhappy, excitement in his voice.\r\n\r\nShe turned herself round and sat up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWell? Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered out. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, Ellen, you\r\nnever heard nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I have slept through all that din? Of course I heard. Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly had time to glance at the paper myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was reading it just now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said severely, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I heard the\r\nrustling. You begun reading it before you lit the gas-ring. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme! What was that they was shouting about the Edgware Road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, \xe2\x80\x9cas you do know, I may as well tell you. The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x99s moving West\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Last time \xe2\x80\x99twas King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCross\xe2\x80\x94now \xe2\x80\x99tis the Edgware Road. I said he\xe2\x80\x99d come our way, and he _has_\r\ncome our way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just go and get me that paper,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI wants to see for\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting went into the next room; then he came back and handed her\r\nsilently the odd-looking, thin little sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whatever\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThis ain\xe2\x80\x99t our paper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, a trifle crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a special early\r\nedition of the Sun, just because of The Avenger. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the bit about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he showed her the exact spot. But she would have found it, even by\r\nthe comparatively bad light of the gas-jet now flaring over the\r\ndressing-table, for the news was printed in large, clear characters:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more the murder fiend who chooses to call himself The Avenger has\r\nescaped detection. While the whole attention of the police, and of the\r\ngreat army of amateur detectives who are taking an interest in this\r\nstrange series of atrocious crimes, were concentrating their attention\r\nround the East End and King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross, he moved swiftly and silently\r\nWestward. And, choosing a time when the Edgware Road is at its busiest\r\nand most thronged, did another human being to death with lightning-like\r\nquickness and savagery.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWithin fifty yards of the deserted warehouse yard where he had\r\n    lured his victim to destruction were passing up and down scores of\r\n    happy, busy people, intent on their Christmas shopping. Into that\r\n    cheerful throng he must have plunged within a moment of committing\r\n    his atrocious crime. And it was only owing to the merest accident\r\n    that the body was discovered as soon as it was\xe2\x80\x94that is, just after\r\n    midnight.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Dowtray, who was called to the spot at once, is of opinion\r\n    that the woman had been dead at least three hours, if not four. It\r\n    was at first thought\xe2\x80\x94we were going to say, hoped\xe2\x80\x94that this murder\r\n    had nothing to do with the series which is now puzzling and\r\n    horrifying the whole of the civilised world. But no\xe2\x80\x94pinned on the\r\n    edge of the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress was the usual now familiar\r\n    triangular piece of grey paper\xe2\x80\x94the grimmest visiting card ever\r\n    designed by the wit of man! And this time The Avenger has surpassed\r\n    himself as regards his audacity and daring\xe2\x80\x94so cold in its maniacal\r\n    fanaticism and abhorrent wickedness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the time that Mrs. Bunting was reading with slow, painful\r\nintentness, her husband was looking at her, longing, yet afraid, to\r\nburst out with a new idea which he was burning to confide even to his\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s unsympathetic ears.\r\n\r\nAt last, when she had quite finished, she looked up defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you anything better to do than to stare at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cMurder or no murder, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get up! Go away\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting went off into the next room.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone, his wife lay back and closed her eyes. She tried to\r\nthink of nothing. Nay, more\xe2\x80\x94so strong, so determined was her will that\r\nfor a few moments she actually did think of nothing. She felt terribly\r\ntired and weak, brain and body both quiescent, as does a person who is\r\nrecovering from a long, wearing illness.\r\n\r\nPresently detached, puerile thoughts drifted across the surface of her\r\nmind like little clouds across a summer sky. She wondered if those\r\nhorrid newspaper men were allowed to shout in Belgrave Square; she\r\nwondered if, in that case, Margaret, who was so unlike her\r\nbrother-in-law, would get up and buy a paper. But no. Margaret was not\r\none to leave her nice warm bed for such a silly reason as that.\r\n\r\nWas it to-morrow Daisy was coming back? Yes\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow, not to-day.\r\nWell, that was a comfort, at any rate. What amusing things Daisy would\r\nbe able to tell about her visit to Margaret! The girl had an excellent\r\ngift of mimicry. And Margaret, with her precise, funny ways, her\r\nperpetual talk about \xe2\x80\x9cthe family,\xe2\x80\x9d lent herself to the cruel gift.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x94her poor, weak, tired mind\xe2\x80\x94wandered off to\r\nyoung Chandler. A funny thing love was, when you came to think of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94which she, Ellen Bunting, didn\xe2\x80\x99t often do. There was Joe, a likely\r\nyoung fellow, seeing a lot of young women, and pretty young women,\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x94quite as pretty as Daisy, and ten times more artful\xe2\x80\x94and yet there!\r\nHe passed them all by, had done so ever since last summer, though you\r\nmight be sure that they, artful minxes, by no manner of means passed\r\nhim by,\xe2\x80\x94without giving them a thought! As Daisy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here, he would\r\nprobably keep away to-day. There was comfort in that thought, too.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting sat up, and memory returned in a dreadful turgid\r\nflood. If Joe _did_ come in, she must nerve herself to hear all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94that talk there\xe2\x80\x99d be about The Avenger between him and Bunting.\r\n\r\nSlowly she dragged herself out of bed, feeling exactly as if she had\r\njust recovered from an illness which had left her very weak, very, very\r\ntired in body and soul.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment listening\xe2\x80\x94listening, and shivering, for it was\r\nvery cold. Considering how early it still was, there seemed a lot of\r\ncoming and going in the Marylebone Road. She could hear the\r\nunaccustomed sounds through her closed door and the tightly fastened\r\nwindows of the sitting-room. There must be a regular crowd of men and\r\nwomen, on foot and in cabs, hurrying to the scene of The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nextraordinary crime.\r\n\r\nShe heard the sudden thud made by their usual morning paper falling\r\nfrom the letter-box on to the floor of the hall, and a moment later\r\ncame the sound of Bunting quickly, quietly going out and getting it.\r\nShe visualised him coming back, and sitting down with a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction by the newly-lit fire.\r\n\r\nLanguidly she began dressing herself to the accompaniment of distant\r\ntramping and of noise of passing traffic, which increased in volume and\r\nin sound as the moments slipped by.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Bunting went down into her kitchen everything looked just as\r\nshe had left it, and there was no trace of the acrid smell she had\r\nexpected to find there. Instead, the cavernous, whitewashed room was\r\nfull of fog, but she noticed that, though the shutters were bolted and\r\nbarred as she had left them, the windows behind them had been widely\r\nopened to the air. She had left them shut.\r\n\r\nMaking a \xe2\x80\x9cspill\xe2\x80\x9d out of a twist of newspaper\xe2\x80\x94she had been taught the\r\nart as a girl by one of her old mistresses\xe2\x80\x94she stooped and flung open\r\nthe oven-door of her gas-stove. Yes, it was as she had expected, a\r\nfierce heat had been generated there since she had last used the oven,\r\nand through to the stone floor below had fallen a mass of black, gluey\r\nsoot.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting took the ham and eggs that she had bought the previous day\r\nfor her own and Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast upstairs, and broiled them over the\r\ngas-ring in their sitting-room. Her husband watched her in surprised\r\nsilence. She had never done such a thing before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay down there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cit was so cold and foggy. I\r\nthought I\xe2\x80\x99d make breakfast up here, just for to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s quite right, Ellen. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nquite right, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, when it came to the point, his wife could not eat any of the nice\r\nbreakfast she had got ready; she only had another cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re ill, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting asked solicitously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not ill at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly! The\r\nthought of that horrible thing happening so close by has upset me, and\r\nput me off my food. Just hark to them now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough their closed windows penetrated the sound of scurrying feet and\r\nloud, ribald laughter. What a crowd; nay, what a mob, must be hastening\r\nbusily to and from the spot where there was now nothing to be seen!\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting made her husband lock the front gate. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of\r\nthose ghouls in here!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed angrily. And then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of\r\nidle people there are in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBunting began moving about the room restlessly. He would go to the\r\nwindow; stand there awhile staring out at the people hurrying past;\r\nthen, coming back to the fireplace, sit down.\r\n\r\nBut he could not stay long quiet. After a glance at his paper, up he\r\nwould rise from his chair, and go to the window again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d stay still,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife said at last. And then, a few\r\nminutes later, \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better put your hat and coat on and go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting, with a rather shamed expression, did put on his hat and\r\ncoat and go out.\r\n\r\nAs he did so he told himself that, after all, he was but human; it was\r\nnatural that he should be thrilled and excited by the dreadful,\r\nextraordinary thing which had just happened close by. Ellen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreasonable about such things. How queer and disagreeable she had been\r\nthat very morning\xe2\x80\x94angry with him because he had gone out to hear what\r\nall the row was about, and even more angry when he had come back and\r\nsaid nothing, because he thought it would annoy her to hear about it!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Bunting forced herself to go down again into the\r\nkitchen, and as she went through into the low, whitewashed place, a\r\ntremor of fear, of quick terror, came over her. She turned and did what\r\nshe had never in her life done before, and what she had never heard of\r\nanyone else doing in a kitchen. She bolted the door.\r\n\r\nBut, having done this, finding herself at last alone, shut off from\r\neverybody, she was still beset by a strange, uncanny dread. She felt as\r\nif she were locked in with an invisible presence, which mocked and\r\njeered, reproached and threatened her, by turns.\r\n\r\nWhy had she allowed, nay encouraged, Daisy to go away for two days?\r\nDaisy, at any rate, was company\xe2\x80\x94kind, young, unsuspecting company. With\r\nDaisy she could be her old sharp self. It was such a comfort to be with\r\nsomeone to whom she not only need, but ought to, say nothing. When with\r\nBunting she was pursued by a sick feeling of guilt, of shame. She was\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s wedded wife\xe2\x80\x94in his stolid way he was very kind to her, and\r\nyet she was keeping from him something he certainly had a right to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nNot for worlds, however, would she have told Bunting of her dreadful\r\nsuspicion\xe2\x80\x94nay, of her almost certainty.\r\n\r\nAt last she went across to the door and unlocked it. Then she went\r\nupstairs and turned out her bedroom. That made her feel a little\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nShe longed for Bunting to return, and yet in a way she was relieved by\r\nhis absence. She would have liked to feel him near by, and yet she\r\nwelcomed anything that took her husband out of the house.\r\n\r\nAnd as Mrs. Bunting swept and dusted, trying to put her whole mind into\r\nwhat she was doing, she was asking herself all the time what was going\r\non upstairs.\r\n\r\nWhat a good rest the lodger was having! But there, that was only\r\nnatural. Mr. Sleuth, as she well knew, had been up a long time last\r\nnight, or rather this morning.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the drawing-room bell rang. But Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady did not\r\ngo up, as she generally did, before getting ready the simple meal which\r\nwas the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s luncheon and breakfast combined. Instead, she went\r\ndownstairs again and hurriedly prepared the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s food.\r\n\r\nThen, very slowly, with her heart beating queerly, she walked up, and\r\njust outside the sitting-room\xe2\x80\x94for she felt sure that Mr. Sleuth had got\r\nup, that he was there already, waiting for her\xe2\x80\x94she rested the tray on\r\nthe top of the banisters and listened. For a few moments she heard\r\nnothing; then through the door came the high, quavering voice with\r\nwhich she had become so familiar:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She saith to him, stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret\r\nis pleasant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there, and that her\r\nguests are in the depths of hell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Mrs. Bunting could hear the leaves of her Bible\r\nbeing turned over, eagerly, busily; and then again Mr. Sleuth broke\r\nout, this time in a softer voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She hath cast down many wounded from her; yea, many strong men have\r\nbeen slain by her.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And in a softer, lower, plaintive tone came the\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out\r\nwisdom and the reason of things; and to know the wickedness of folly,\r\neven of foolishness and madness.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as she stood there listening, a feeling of keen distress, of\r\nspiritual oppression, came over Mrs. Bunting. For the first time in her\r\nlife she visioned the infinite mystery, the sadness and strangeness, of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x94poor unhappy, distraught Mr. Sleuth! An overwhelming\r\npity blotted out for a moment the fear, aye, and the loathing, she had\r\nbeen feeling for her lodger.\r\n\r\nShe knocked at the door, and then she took up her tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounded feebler, more\r\ntoneless than usual.\r\n\r\nShe turned the handle of the door and walked in. The lodger was not\r\nsitting in his usual place; he had taken the little round table on\r\nwhich his candle generally rested when he read in bed, out of his\r\nbedroom, and placed it over by the drawing-room window. On it were\r\nplaced, open, the Bible and the Concordance. But as his landlady came\r\nin, Mr. Sleuth hastily closed the Bible, and began staring dreamily out\r\nof the window, down at the sordid, hurrying crowd of men and women\r\nwhich now swept along the Marylebone Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seem a great many people out today,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, without\r\nlooking round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, there do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting began busying herself with laying the cloth and putting\r\nout the breakfast-lunch, and as she did so she was seized with a\r\nmortal, instinctive terror of the man sitting there.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Sleuth got up and turned round. She forced herself to look\r\nat him. How tired, how worn, he looked, and\xe2\x80\x94how strange!\r\n\r\nWalking towards the table on which lay his meal, he rubbed his hands\r\ntogether with a nervous gesture\xe2\x80\x94it was a gesture he only made when\r\nsomething had pleased, nay, satisfied him. Mrs. Bunting, looking at\r\nhim, remembered that he had rubbed his hands together thus when he had\r\nfirst seen the room upstairs, and realised that it contained a large\r\ngas-stove and a convenient sink.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Sleuth was doing now also reminded her in an odd way of a play\r\nshe had once seen\xe2\x80\x94a play to which a young man had taken her when she\r\nwas a girl, unnumbered years ago, and which had thrilled and fascinated\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cOut, out, damned spot!\xe2\x80\x9d that was what the tall, fierce, beautiful\r\nlady who had played the part of a queen had said, twisting her hands\r\ntogether just as the lodger was doing now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth, sitting down and unfolding his\r\nnapkin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fog has cleared. I do not know if you will agree with me,\r\nMrs. Bunting, but I always feel brighter when the sun is shining, as it\r\nis now, at any rate, trying to shine.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her inquiringly,\r\nbut Mrs. Bunting could not speak. She only nodded. However, that did\r\nnot affect Mr. Sleuth adversely.\r\n\r\nHe had acquired a great liking and respect for this well-balanced,\r\ntaciturn woman. She was the first woman for whom he had experienced any\r\nsuch feeling for many years past.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the still covered dish, and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel as if I could eat very much to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said plaintively. And then\r\nhe suddenly took a half-sovereign out of his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nAlready Mrs. Bunting had noticed that it was not the same waistcoat Mr.\r\nSleuth had been wearing the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bunting, may I ask you to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd after a moment of hesitation his landlady obeyed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please accept this little gift for the use you kindly allowed\r\nme to make of your kitchen last night?\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to\r\nmake as little mess as I could, Mrs. Bunting, but\xe2\x80\x94well, the truth is I\r\nwas carrying out a very elaborate experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting held out her hand, she hesitated, and then she took the\r\ncoin. The fingers which for a moment brushed lightly against her palm\r\nwere icy cold\xe2\x80\x94cold and clammy. Mr. Sleuth was evidently not well.\r\n\r\nAs she walked down the stairs, the winter sun, a scarlet ball hanging\r\nin the smoky sky, glinted in on Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady, and threw\r\nblood-red gleams, or so it seemed to her, on to the piece of gold she\r\nwas holding in her hand.\r\n\r\nThe day went by, as other days had gone by in that quiet household,\r\nbut, of course, there was far greater animation outside the little\r\nhouse than was usually the case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because the sun was shining for the first time for some days,\r\nthe whole of London seemed to be making holiday in that part of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWhen Bunting at last came back, his wife listened silently while he\r\ntold her of the extraordinary excitement reigning everywhere. And then,\r\nafter he had been talking a long while, she suddenly shot a strange\r\nlook at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you went to see the place?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd guiltily he acknowledged that he had done so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything much to see\xe2\x80\x94not now. But, oh, Ellen, the\r\ndaring of him! Why, Ellen, if the poor soul had had time to cry\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94which they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she had\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible someone wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a heard her. They say that if he goes on doing it like that\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nafternoon, like\xe2\x80\x94he never _will_ be caught. He must have just got mixed\r\nup with all the other people within ten seconds of what he\xe2\x80\x99d done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Bunting bought papers recklessly\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he must\r\nhave spent the best part of six-pence. But in spite of all the supposed\r\nand suggested clues, there was nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all new to read,\r\nless, in fact than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe police, it was clear, were quite at a loss, and Mrs. Bunting began\r\nto feel curiously better, less tired, less ill, less\xe2\x80\x94less terrified\r\nthan she had felt through the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd then something happened which broke with dramatic suddenness the\r\nquietude of the day.\r\n\r\nThey had had their tea, and Bunting was reading the last of the papers\r\nhe had run out to buy, when suddenly there came a loud, thundering,\r\ndouble knock at the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked up, startled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whoever can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBut as Bunting got up she added quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou just sit down again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo myself. Sounds like someone after lodgings. I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon send them to\r\nthe right-about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she left the room, but not before there had come another loud\r\ndouble knock.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting opened the front door. In a moment she saw that the person\r\nwho stood there was a stranger to her. He was a big, dark man, with\r\nfierce, black moustaches. And somehow\xe2\x80\x94she could not have told you\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94he suggested a policeman to Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nThis notion of hers was confirmed by the very first words he uttered.\r\nFor, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to execute a warrant!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in a theatrical,\r\nhollow tone.\r\n\r\nWith a weak cry of protest Mrs. Bunting suddenly threw out her arms as\r\nif to bar the way; she turned deadly white\xe2\x80\x94but then, in an instant the\r\nsupposed stranger\xe2\x80\x99s laugh rang out, with loud, jovial, familiar sound!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Mrs. Bunting! I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d take you in as well as\r\nall that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Joe Chandler\xe2\x80\x94Joe Chandler dressed up, as she knew he sometimes,\r\nnot very often, did dress up in the course of his work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting began laughing\xe2\x80\x94laughing helplessly, hysterically, just as\r\nshe had done on the morning of Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, when the\r\nnewspaper-sellers had come shouting down the Marylebone Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this about?\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting came out\r\n\r\nYoung Chandler ruefully shut the front door. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to upset\r\nher like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking foolish; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99twas just my silly\r\nnonsense, Mr. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d And together they helped her into the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nBut, once there, poor Mrs. Bunting went on worse than ever; she threw\r\nher black apron over her face, and began to sob hysterically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made sure she\xe2\x80\x99d know who I was when I spoke,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the young\r\nfellow apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, there now, I _have_ upset her. I _am_\r\nsorry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t matter!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, throwing the apron off her face, but\r\nthe tears were still streaming from her eyes as she sobbed and laughed\r\nby turns. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter one little bit, Joe! \xe2\x80\x99Twas stupid of me to be\r\nso taken aback. But, there, that murder that\xe2\x80\x99s happened close by, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust upset me\xe2\x80\x94upset me altogether to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to upset anyone\xe2\x80\x94that was,\xe2\x80\x9d acknowledged the young man ruefully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only come in for a minute, like. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t no right to come when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m on duty like this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler was looking longingly at what remains of the meal were\r\nstill on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can take a minute just to have a bite and a sup,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\nhospitably; \xe2\x80\x9cand then you can tell us any news there is, Joe. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright in the middle of everything now, ain\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with evident\r\nenjoyment, almost pride, in the gruesome fact.\r\n\r\nJoe nodded. Already his mouth was full of bread-and-butter. He waited a\r\nmoment, and then: \xe2\x80\x9cWell I have got one piece of news\xe2\x80\x94not that I suppose\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll interest _you_ very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both looked at him\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bunting suddenly calm, though her breast\r\nstill heaved from time to time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Boss has resigned!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Chandler slowly, impressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Not the Commissioner o\xe2\x80\x99 Police?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has. He just can\xe2\x80\x99t bear what\xe2\x80\x99s said about us any longer\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wonder! He done his best, and so\xe2\x80\x99s we all. The public have just\r\ngone daft\xe2\x80\x94in the West End, that is, to-day. As for the papers, well,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re something cruel\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they are. And the ridiculous ideas\r\nthey print! You\xe2\x80\x99d never believe the things they asks us to do\xe2\x80\x94and quite\r\nserious-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Mrs. Bunting. She really wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the _Courier_ declares that there ought to be a house-to-house\r\ninvestigation\xe2\x80\x94all over London. Just think of it! Everybody to let the\r\npolice go all over their house, from garret to kitchen, just to see if\r\nThe Avenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t concealed there. Dotty, I calls it! Why, \xe2\x80\x99twould take\r\nus months and months just to do that one job in a town like London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them dare come into my house!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all along of them blarsted papers that The Avenger went to work a\r\ndifferent way this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler slowly.\r\n\r\nBunting had pushed a tin of sardines towards his guest, and was eagerly\r\nlistening. \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take your meaning,\r\nJoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s this way. The newspapers was always saying how\r\nextraordinary it was that The Avenger chose such a peculiar time to do\r\nhis deeds\xe2\x80\x94I mean, the time when no one\xe2\x80\x99s about the streets. Now,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it stand to reason that the fellow, reading all that, and\r\nseeing the sense of it, said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on another tack this\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x99? Just listen to this!\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled a strip of paper, part of a\r\ncolumn cut from a newspaper, out of his pocket:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98AN EX-LORD MAYOR OF LONDON ON THE AVENGER\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Will the murderer be caught? Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sir John, \xe2\x80\x98he will\r\ncertainly be caught\xe2\x80\x94probably when he commits his next crime. A whole\r\narmy of bloodhounds, metaphorical and literal, will be on his track the\r\nmoment he draws blood again. With the whole community against him, he\r\ncannot escape, _especially when it be remembered that he chooses the\r\nquietest hour in the twenty-four to commit his crimes_.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Londoners are now in such a state of nerves\xe2\x80\x94if I may use the\r\n    expression, in such a state of funk\xe2\x80\x94that every passer-by, however\r\n    innocent, is looked at with suspicion by his neighbour if his\r\n    avocation happens to take him abroad between the hours of one and\r\n    three in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to gag that ex-Lord Mayor!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Joe Chandler\r\nwrathfully.\r\n\r\nJust then the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go up, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting.\r\n\r\nHis wife still looked pale and shaken by the fright she had had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stop down here, and talk to Joe. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlook after Mr. Sleuth. He may be wanting his supper just a bit earlier\r\nthan usual to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly, painfully, again feeling as if her legs were made of cotton\r\nwool, she dragged herself up to the first floor, knocked at the door,\r\nand then went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did ring, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her quiet, respectful way.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sleuth looked up.\r\n\r\nShe thought\xe2\x80\x94but, as she reminded herself afterwards, it might have been\r\njust her idea, and nothing else\xe2\x80\x94that for the first time the lodger\r\nlooked frightened\xe2\x80\x94frightened and cowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a noise downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said fretfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wanted to know\r\nwhat it was all about. As I told you, Mrs. Bunting, when I first took\r\nthese rooms, quiet is essential to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just a friend of ours, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you were disturbed. Would\r\nyou like the knocker taken off to-morrow? Bunting\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleased to do\r\nit if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear the sound of the knocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put you to such trouble as that.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sleuth looked\r\nquite relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cJust a friend of yours, was it, Mrs. Bunting? He made\r\na great deal of noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cThe son of one of\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s old friends. He often comes here, sir; but he never did give\r\nsuch a great big double knock as that before. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to him about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, Mrs. Bunting. I would really prefer you did nothing of the\r\nkind. It was just a passing annoyance\xe2\x80\x94nothing more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment. How strange that Mr. Sleuth said nothing of the\r\nhoarse cries which had made of the road outside a perfect Bedlam every\r\nhour or two throughout that day. But no, Mr. Sleuth made no allusion to\r\nwhat might well have disturbed any quiet gentleman at his reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have supper a little earlier to-night,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust when you like, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94just when it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient. I do not\r\nwish to put you out in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt herself dismissed, and going out quietly, closed the door.\r\n\r\nAs she did so, she heard the front door banging to. She sighed\xe2\x80\x94Joe\r\nChandler was really a very noisy young fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting slept well the night following that during which the\r\nlodger had been engaged in making his mysterious experiments in her\r\nkitchen. She was so tired, so utterly exhausted, that sleep came to her\r\nthe moment she laid her head upon her pillow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was why she rose so early the next morning. Hardly giving\r\nherself time to swallow the tea Bunting had made and brought her, she\r\ngot up and dressed.\r\n\r\nShe had suddenly come to the conclusion that the hall and staircase\r\nrequired a thorough \xe2\x80\x9cdoing down,\xe2\x80\x9d and she did not even wait till they\r\nhad eaten their breakfast before beginning her labours. It made Bunting\r\nfeel quite uncomfortable. As he sat by the fire reading his morning\r\npaper\xe2\x80\x94the paper which was again of such absorbing interest\xe2\x80\x94he called\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need for so much hurry, Ellen. Daisy\xe2\x80\x99ll be back\r\nto-day. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you wait till she\xe2\x80\x99s come home to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut from the hall where she was busy dusting, sweeping, polishing, his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s voice came back: \xe2\x80\x9cGirls ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good at this sort of work.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about me. I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy doing an extra bit of\r\ncleaning to-day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to feel as anyone could come in and see\r\nmy place dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of that!\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting chuckled. And then a new thought struck him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of waking the lodger?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth slept most of yesterday, and all last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs it is, I study him over-much; it\xe2\x80\x99s a long, long time since\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done this staircase down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the time she was engaged in doing the hall, Mrs. Bunting left the\r\nsitting-room door wide open.\r\n\r\nThat was a queer thing of her to do, but Bunting didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to get up\r\nand shut her out, as it were. Still, try as he would, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read\r\nwith any comfort while all that noise was going on. He had never known\r\nEllen make such a lot of noise before. Once or twice he looked up and\r\nfrowned rather crossly.\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden silence, and he was startled to see that Ellen was\r\nstanding in the doorway, staring at him, doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you finished yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only resting a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me nothing.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything\xe2\x80\x94I mean anything new\xe2\x80\x94in the paper\r\nthis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a muffled voice, almost as if she were ashamed of her\r\nunusual curiosity; and her look of fatigue, of pallor, made Bunting\r\nsuddenly uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done quite\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94and before breakfast, too. \xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t necessary. Come in and shut\r\nthat door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke authoritatively, and his wife, for a wonder, obeyed him.\r\n\r\nShe came in, and did what she had never done before\xe2\x80\x94brought the broom\r\nwith her, and put it up against the wall in the corner.\r\n\r\nThen she sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll make breakfast up here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I feel cold,\r\nBunting.\xe2\x80\x9d And her husband stared at her surprised, for drops of\r\nperspiration were glistening on her forehead.\r\n\r\nHe got up. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and bring the eggs up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nworry. For the matter of that, I can cook them downstairs if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather do my own work. You just bring\r\nthem up here\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. To-morrow morning we\xe2\x80\x99ll have Daisy\r\nto help see to things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome over here and sit down comfortable in my chair,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested\r\nkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never do take any bit of rest, Ellen. I never see\xe2\x80\x99d such a\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again she got up and meekly obeyed him, walking across the room\r\nwith languid steps.\r\n\r\nHe watched her, anxiously, uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nShe took up the newspaper he had just laid down, and Bunting took two\r\nsteps towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the most interesting bit\xe2\x80\x9d he said eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npiece headed, \xe2\x80\x98Our Special Investigator.\xe2\x80\x99 You see, they\xe2\x80\x99ve started a\r\nspecial investigator of their own, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got hold of a lot of little\r\nfacts the police seem to have overlooked. The man who writes all that\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean the Special Investigator\xe2\x80\x94was a famous \xe2\x80\x99tec in his time, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust come back out of his retirement o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to do this bit of work\r\nfor the paper. You read what he says\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bit surprised if\r\nhe ends by getting that reward! One can see he just loves the work of\r\ntracking people down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be proud of in such a job,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife\r\nlistlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have something to be proud of if he catches The Avenger!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nBunting. He was too keen about this affair to be put off by Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontradictory remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just notice that bit about the rubber\r\nsoles. Now, no one\xe2\x80\x99s thought o\xe2\x80\x99 that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell Chandler\xe2\x80\x94he don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to me to be half awake, that young man don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quite wide awake enough without you saying things to him! How\r\nabout those eggs, Bunting? I feel quite ready for my breakfast even if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting now spoke in what her husband sometimes secretly described\r\nto himself as \xe2\x80\x9cEllen\xe2\x80\x99s snarling voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away and left the room, feeling oddly troubled. There was\r\nsomething queer about her, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nit when she spoke sharply and nastily to him. He was used to that. But\r\nnow she was so up and down; so different from what she used to be! In\r\nold days she had always been the same, but now a man never knew where\r\nto have her.\r\n\r\nAnd as he went downstairs he pondered uneasily over his wife\xe2\x80\x99s changed\r\nways and manner.\r\n\r\nTake the question of his easy chair. A very small matter, no doubt, but\r\nhe had never known Ellen sit in that chair\xe2\x80\x94no, not even once, for a\r\nminute, since it had been purchased by her as a present for him.\r\n\r\nThey had been so happy, so happy, and so\xe2\x80\x94so restful, during that first\r\nweek after Mr. Sleuth had come to them. Perhaps it was the sudden,\r\ndramatic change from agonising anxiety to peace and security which had\r\nbeen too much for Ellen\xe2\x80\x94yes, that was what was the matter with her,\r\nthat and the universal excitement about these Avenger murders, which\r\nwere shaking the nerves of all London. Even Bunting, unobservant as he\r\nwas, had come to realise that his wife took a morbid interest in these\r\nterrible happenings. And it was the more queer of her to do so that at\r\nfirst she refused to discuss them, and said openly that she was utterly\r\nuninterested in murder or crime of any sort.\r\n\r\nHe, Bunting, had always had a mild pleasure in such things. In his time\r\nhe had been a great reader of detective tales, and even now he thought\r\nthere was no pleasanter reading. It was that which had first drawn him\r\nto Joe Chandler, and made him welcome the young chap as cordially as he\r\nhad done when they first came to London.\r\n\r\nBut though Ellen had tolerated, she had never encouraged, that sort of\r\ntalk between the two men. More than once she had exclaimed\r\nreproachfully: \xe2\x80\x9cTo hear you two, one would think there was no nice,\r\nrespectable, quiet people left in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now all that was changed. She was as keen as anyone could be to\r\nhear the latest details of an Avenger crime. True, she took her own\r\nview of any theory suggested. But there! Ellen always had had her own\r\nnotions about everything under the sun. Ellen was a woman who thought\r\nfor herself\xe2\x80\x94a clever woman, not an everyday woman by any manner of\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were going disconnectedly through his mind,\r\nBunting was breaking four eggs into a basin. He was going to give Ellen\r\na nice little surprise\xe2\x80\x94to cook an omelette as a French chef had once\r\ntaught him to do, years and years ago. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how she would\r\ntake his doing such a thing after what she had said; but never mind,\r\nshe would enjoy the omelette when done. Ellen hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been eating her\r\nfood properly of late.\r\n\r\nAnd when he went up again, his wife, to his relief, and, it must be\r\nadmitted, to his surprise, took it very well. She had not even noticed\r\nhow long he had been downstairs, for she had been reading with intense,\r\npainful care the column that the great daily paper they took in had\r\nallotted to the one-time famous detective.\r\n\r\nAccording to this Special Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s own account he had discovered\r\nall sorts of things that had escaped the eye of the police and of the\r\nofficial detectives. For instance, owing, he admitted, to a fortunate\r\nchance, he had been at the place where the two last murders had been\r\ncommitted very soon after the double crime had been discovered\xe2\x80\x94in fact\r\nwithin half an hour, and he had found, or so he felt sure, on the\r\nslippery, wet pavement imprints of the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s right foot.\r\n\r\nThe paper reproduced the impression of a half-worn rubber sole. At the\r\nsame time, he also admitted\xe2\x80\x94for the Special Investigator was very\r\nhonest, and he had a good bit of space to fill in the enterprising\r\npaper which had engaged him to probe the awful mystery\xe2\x80\x94that there were\r\nthousands of rubber soles being worn in London. . . .\r\n\r\nAnd when she came to that statement Mrs. Bunting looked up, and there\r\ncame a wan smile over her thin, closely-shut lips. It was quite\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94that about rubber soles; there were thousands of rubber soles\r\nbeing worn just now. She felt grateful to the Special Investigator for\r\nhaving stated the fact so clearly.\r\n\r\nThe column ended up with the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to-day will take place the inquest on the double crime of ten days\r\nago. To my mind it would be well if a preliminary public inquiry could\r\nbe held at once. Say, on the very day the discovery of a fresh murder\r\nis made. In that way alone would it be possible to weigh and sift the\r\nevidence offered by members of the general public. For when a week or\r\nmore has elapsed, and these same people have been examined and\r\ncross-examined in private by the police, their impressions have had\r\ntime to become blurred and hopelessly confused. On that last occasion\r\nbut one there seems no doubt that several people, at any rate two women\r\nand one man, actually saw the murderer hurrying from the scene of his\r\natrocious double crime\xe2\x80\x94this being so, to-day\xe2\x80\x99s investigation may be of\r\nthe highest value and importance. To-morrow I hope to give an account\r\nof the impression made on me by the inquest, and by any statements made\r\nduring its course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nEven when her husband had come in with the tray Mrs. Bunting had gone\r\non reading, only lifting up her eyes for a moment. At last he said\r\nrather crossly, \xe2\x80\x9cPut down that paper, Ellen, this minute! The omelette\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve cooked for you will be just like leather if you don\xe2\x80\x99t eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut once his wife had eaten her breakfast\xe2\x80\x94and, to Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmortification, she left more than half the nice omelette untouched\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ntook the paper up again. She turned over the big sheets, until she\r\nfound, at the foot of one of the ten columns devoted to The Avenger and\r\nhis crimes, the information she wanted, and then uttered an exclamation\r\nunder her breath.\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Bunting had been looking for\xe2\x80\x94what at last she had found\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nthe time and place of the inquest which was to be held that day. The\r\nhour named was a rather odd time\xe2\x80\x94two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, but,\r\nfrom Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, it was most convenient.\r\n\r\nBy two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, nay, by half-past one, the lodger would have had his\r\nlunch; by hurrying matters a little she and Bunting would have had\r\ntheir dinner, and\xe2\x80\x94and Daisy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming home till tea-time.\r\n\r\nShe got up out of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, in a quick, hoarse tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean about me seeing a doctor,\r\nBunting. I think I will go and see a doctor this very afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like me to go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. In fact I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go at all you was to go with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said vexedly. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease yourself, my dear; you know\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I did know best where my own health is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Bunting was incensed by this lack of gratitude. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas I said,\r\nlong ago, you ought to go and see the doctor; \xe2\x80\x99twas you said you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed pugnaciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said you was never right, have I? At any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a pain anywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d He stared at her with a look of real\r\nsolicitude on his fat, phlegmatic face.\r\n\r\nSomehow Ellen didn\xe2\x80\x99t look right, standing there opposite him. Her\r\nshoulders seemed to have shrunk; even her cheeks had fallen in a\r\nlittle. She had never looked so bad\xe2\x80\x94not even when they had been half\r\nstarving, and dreadfully, dreadfully worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said briefly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a pain in my head, at the back of my\r\nneck. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often leave me; it gets worse when anything upsets me,\r\nlike I was upset last night by Joe Chandler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a silly ass to come and do a thing like that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\ncrossly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d a good mind to tell him so, too. But I must say, Ellen, I\r\nwonder he took you in\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you had no chance he should\xe2\x80\x94you knew who it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting remained silent, for Ellen was right. Joe Chandler had\r\nalready spoken when he, Bunting, came out into the hall, and saw their\r\ncleverly disguised visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose big black moustaches,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on complainingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand that black\r\nwig\xe2\x80\x94why, \xe2\x80\x99twas too ridic\xe2\x80\x99lous\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to anyone who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a real man\xe2\x80\x94nohow. If he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwise lad, he won\xe2\x80\x99t let our Daisy ever see him looking like that!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nBunting laughed, a comfortable laugh.\r\n\r\nHe had thought a good deal about Daisy and young Chandler the last two\r\ndays, and, on the whole, he was well pleased. It was a dull, unnatural\r\nlife the girl was leading with Old Aunt. And Joe was earning good\r\nmoney. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have long to wait, these two young people, as a\r\nbeau and his girl often have to wait, as he, Bunting, and Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother had had to do, for ever so long before they could be married.\r\nNo, there was no reason why they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be spliced quite soon\xe2\x80\x94if so\r\nthe fancy took them. And Bunting had very little doubt that so the\r\nfancy would take Joe, at any rate.\r\n\r\nBut there was plenty of time. Daisy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be eighteen till the week\r\nafter next. They might wait till she was twenty. By that time Old Aunt\r\nmight be dead, and Daisy might have come into quite a tidy little bit\r\nof money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you smiling at?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife sharply.\r\n\r\nAnd he shook himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94smiling? At nothing that I knows of.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\nwaited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you will know, Ellen, I was just thinking of\r\nDaisy and that young chap Joe Chandler. He is gone on her, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d And then Mrs. Bunting laughed, a queer, odd, not unkindly\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cGone, Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight\xe2\x80\x94right,\r\nout of sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen hesitatingly, and looking narrowly at her husband, she went on,\r\ntwisting a bit of her black apron with her fingers as she spoke:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll be going over this afternoon to fetch her? Or\xe2\x80\x94or d\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be at that inquest, Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquest? What inquest?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the inquest on them bodies found in the passage near by King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; he\xe2\x80\x99d have no call to be at the inquest. For the matter o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s going over to fetch Daisy. He said so last night\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nwhen you went up to the lodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just as well.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting spoke with considerable\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 had to go. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthe house left\xe2\x80\x94not with us out of it. Mr. Sleuth _would_ be upset if\r\nthere came a ring at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave the house, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid, Ellen\xe2\x80\x94not while\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even if I\xe2\x80\x99m out a good while, Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear. Of course, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time if it\xe2\x80\x99s your idea to see\r\nthat doctor at Ealing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her questioningly, and Mrs. Bunting nodded. Somehow\r\nnodding didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as bad as speaking a lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny ordeal is far less terrifying, far easier to meet with courage,\r\nwhen it is repeated, than is even a milder experience which is entirely\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting had already attended an inquest, in the character of a\r\nwitness, and it was one of the few happenings of her life which was\r\nsharply etched against the somewhat blurred screen of her memory.\r\n\r\nIn a country house where the then Ellen Green had been staying for a\r\nfortnight with her elderly mistress, there had occurred one of those\r\nsudden, pitiful tragedies which occasionally destroy the serenity, the\r\napparent decorum, of a large, respectable household.\r\n\r\nThe under-housemaid, a pretty, happy-natured girl, had drowned herself\r\nfor love of the footman, who had given his sweetheart cause for bitter\r\njealousy. The girl had chosen to speak of her troubles to the strange\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s maid rather than to her own fellow-servants, and it was during\r\nthe conversation the two women had had together that the girl had\r\nthreatened to take her own life.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bunting put on her outdoor clothes, preparatory to going out,\r\nshe recalled very clearly all the details of that dreadful affair, and\r\nof the part she herself had unwillingly played in it.\r\n\r\nShe visualised the country inn where the inquest on that poor,\r\nunfortunate creature had been held.\r\n\r\nThe butler had escorted her from the Hall, for he also was to give\r\nevidence, and as they came up there had been a look of cheerful\r\nanimation about the inn yard; people coming and going, many women as\r\nwell as men, village folk, among whom the dead girl\xe2\x80\x99s fate had aroused\r\na great deal of interest, and the kind of horror which those who live\r\non a dull countryside welcome rather than avoid.\r\n\r\nEveryone there had been particularly nice and polite to her, to Ellen\r\nGreen; there had been a time of waiting in a room upstairs in the old\r\ninn, and the witnesses had been accommodated, not only with chairs, but\r\nwith cake and wine.\r\n\r\nShe remembered how she had dreaded being a witness, how she had felt as\r\nif she would like to run away from her nice, easy place, rather than\r\nhave to get up and tell the little that she knew of the sad business.\r\n\r\nBut it had not been so very dreadful after all. The coroner had been a\r\nkindly-spoken gentleman; in fact he had complimented her on the clear,\r\nsensible way she had given her evidence concerning the exact words the\r\nunhappy girl had used.\r\n\r\nOne thing Ellen Green had said, in answer to a question put by an\r\ninquisitive juryman, had raised a laugh in the crowded, low-ceilinged\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cOught not Miss Ellen Green,\xe2\x80\x9d so the man had asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto have told\r\nsomeone of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s threat? If she had done so, might not the girl\r\nhave been prevented from throwing herself into the lake?\xe2\x80\x9d And she, the\r\nwitness, had answered, with some asperity\xe2\x80\x94for by that time the\r\ncoroner\xe2\x80\x99s kind manner had put her at her ease\xe2\x80\x94that she had not attached\r\nany importance to what the girl had threatened to do, never believing\r\nthat any young woman could be so silly as to drown herself for love!\r\n\r\nVaguely Mrs. Bunting supposed that the inquest at which she was going\r\nto be present this afternoon would be like that country inquest of long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIt had been no mere perfunctory inquiry; she remembered very well how\r\nlittle by little that pleasant-spoken gentleman, the coroner, had got\r\nthe whole truth out\xe2\x80\x94the story, that is, of how that horrid footman,\r\nwhom she, Ellen Green, had disliked from the first minute she had set\r\neyes on him, had taken up with another young woman. It had been\r\nsupposed that this fact would not be elicited by the coroner; but it\r\nhad been, quietly, remorselessly; more, the dead girl\xe2\x80\x99s letters had\r\nbeen read out\xe2\x80\x94piteous, queerly expressed letters, full of wild love and\r\nbitter, threatening jealousy. And the jury had censured the young man\r\nmost severely; she remembered the look on his face when the people,\r\nshrinking back, had made a passage for him to slink out of the crowded\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it now, it was strange she had never told Bunting that\r\nlong-ago tale. It had occurred years before she knew him, and somehow\r\nnothing had ever happened to make her tell him about it.\r\n\r\nShe wondered whether Bunting had ever been to an inquest. She longed to\r\nask him. But if she asked him now, this minute, he might guess where\r\nshe was thinking of going.\r\n\r\nAnd then, while still moving about her bedroom, she shook her head\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nno, Bunting would never guess such a thing; he would never, never\r\nsuspect her of telling him a lie.\r\n\r\nStop\xe2\x80\x94had she told a lie? She did mean to go to the doctor after the\r\ninquest was finished\xe2\x80\x94if there was time, that is. She wondered uneasily\r\nhow long such an inquiry was likely to last. In this case, as so very\r\nlittle had been discovered, the proceedings would surely be very\r\nformal\xe2\x80\x94formal and therefore short.\r\n\r\nShe herself had one quite definite object\xe2\x80\x94that of hearing the evidence\r\nof those who believed they had seen the murderer leaving the spot where\r\nhis victims lay weltering in their still flowing blood. She was filled\r\nwith a painful, secret, and, yes, eager curiosity to hear how those who\r\nwere so positive about the matter would describe the appearance of The\r\nAvenger. After all, a lot of people must have seen him, for, as Bunting\r\nhad said only the day before to young Chandler, The Avenger was not a\r\nghost; he was a living man with some kind of hiding-place where he was\r\nknown, and where he spent his time between his awful crimes.\r\n\r\nAs she came back to the sitting-room, her extreme pallor struck her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is time you went to the doctor. You looks\r\njust as if you was going to a funeral. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come along with you as far\r\nas the station. You\xe2\x80\x99re going by train, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you? Not by bus, eh? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na very long way to Ealing, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go! Breaking your solemn promise to me the very first\r\nminute!\xe2\x80\x9d But somehow she did not speak unkindly, only fretfully and\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting hung his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure I\xe2\x80\x99d gone and clean forgot\r\nthe lodger! But will you be all right, Ellen? Why not wait till\r\nto-morrow, and take Daisy with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like doing my own business in my own way, and not in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway!\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped out; and then more gently, for Bunting really looked\r\nconcerned, and she did feel very far from well, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, old\r\nman. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she turned to go across to the door, she drew the black shawl she\r\nhad put over her long jacket more closely round her.\r\n\r\nShe felt ashamed, deeply ashamed, of deceiving so kind a husband. And\r\nyet, what could she do? How could she share her dreadful burden with\r\npoor Bunting? Why, \xe2\x80\x99twould be enough to make a man go daft. Even she\r\noften felt as if she could stand it no longer\xe2\x80\x94as if she would give the\r\nworld to tell someone\xe2\x80\x94anyone\xe2\x80\x94what it was that she suspected, what deep\r\nin her heart she so feared to be the truth.\r\n\r\nBut, unknown to herself, the fresh outside air, fog-laden though it\r\nwas, soon began to do her good. She had gone out far too little the\r\nlast few days, for she had had a nervous terror of leaving the house\r\nunprotected, as also a great unwillingness to allow Bunting to come\r\ninto contact with the lodger.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the Underground station she stopped short. There were\r\ntwo ways of getting to St. Pancras\xe2\x80\x94she could go by bus, or she could go\r\nby train. She decided on the latter. But before turning into the\r\nstation her eyes strayed over the bills of the early afternoon papers\r\nlying on the ground.\r\n\r\nTwo words,\r\n\r\nTHE AVENGER,\r\n\r\n\r\nstared up at her in varying type.\r\n\r\nDrawing her black shawl yet a little closer about her shoulders, Mrs.\r\nBunting looked down at the placards. She did not feel inclined to buy a\r\npaper, as many of the people round her were doing. Her eyes were\r\nsmarting, even now, from their unaccustomed following of the close\r\nprint in the paper Bunting took in.\r\n\r\nSlowly she turned, at last, into the Underground station.\r\n\r\nAnd now a piece of extraordinary good fortune befell Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\nThe third-class carriage in which she took her place happened to be\r\nempty, save for the presence of a police inspector. And once they were\r\nwell away she summoned up courage, and asked him the question she knew\r\nshe would have to ask of someone within the next few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere death inquests are\r\nheld\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she moistened her lips, waited a moment, and then concluded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nthe neighbourhood of King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man turned and, looked at her attentively. She did not look at all\r\nthe sort of Londoner who goes to an inquest\xe2\x80\x94there are many such\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nfor the fun of the thing. Approvingly, for he was a widower, he noted\r\nher neat black coat and skirt; and the plain Princess bonnet which\r\nframed her pale, refined face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Court myself.\xe2\x80\x9d he said good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nyou can come along of me. You see there\xe2\x80\x99s that big Avenger inquest\r\ngoing on to-day, so I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have had to make other arrangements\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94hum, hum\xe2\x80\x94ordinary cases.\xe2\x80\x9d And as she looked at him dumbly, he went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a mighty crowd of people at The Avenger inquest\xe2\x80\x94a lot\r\nof ticket folk to be accommodated, to say nothing of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the inquest I\xe2\x80\x99m going to,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Mrs. Bunting. She could\r\nscarcely get the words out. She realised with acute discomfort, yes,\r\nand shame, how strange, how untoward, was that which she was going to\r\ndo. Fancy a respectable woman wanting to attend a murder inquest!\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days all her perceptions had become sharpened by\r\nsuspense and fear. She realised now, as she looked into the stolid face\r\nof her unknown friend, how she herself would have regarded any woman\r\nwho wanted to attend such an inquiry from a simple, morbid feeling of\r\ncuriosity. And yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet that was just what she was about to do\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a reason for wanting to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. It was a\r\ncomfort to unburden herself this little way even to a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94a relative connected with one of the two\r\nvictims\xe2\x80\x99 husbands, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Bunting bent her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to give evidence?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked casually, and then he turned and\r\nlooked at Mrs. Bunting with far more attention than he had yet done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a world of horror, of fear in the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nAnd the inspector felt concerned and sorry. \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for quite\r\na long time, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had, seen her. I\xe2\x80\x99m from the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Something impelled Mrs.\r\nBunting to say these words. But she hastily corrected herself, \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nleast, I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him dumbly; not in the least knowing to whom he was\r\nalluding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean the husband,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the inspector hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt sorry for\r\nthe last poor chap\xe2\x80\x94I mean the husband of the last one\xe2\x80\x94he seemed so\r\nawfully miserable. You see, she\xe2\x80\x99d been a good wife and a good mother\r\ntill she took to the drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt always is so,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed out Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye.\xe2\x80\x9d He waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know anyone about the court?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you in along o\xe2\x80\x99 me. You\xe2\x80\x99d never get\r\nin by yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got out; and oh, the comfort of being in some one\xe2\x80\x99s charge, of\r\nhaving a determined man in uniform to look after one! And yet even now\r\nthere was to Mrs. Bunting something dream-like, unsubstantial about the\r\nwhole business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he knew\xe2\x80\x94if he only knew what I know!\xe2\x80\x9d she kept saying over and over\r\nagain to herself as she walked lightly by the big, burly form of the\r\npolice inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t far\xe2\x80\x94not three minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I walking too\r\nquick for you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m a quick walker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly they turned a corner and came on a mass of people, a\r\ndensely packed crowd of men and women, staring at a mean-looking little\r\ndoor sunk into a high wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter take my arm,\xe2\x80\x9d the inspector suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cMake way there! Make\r\nway!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried authoritatively; and he swept her through the serried\r\nranks which parted at the sound of his voice, at the sight of his\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky you met me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d never have got through\r\nalone. And \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t a nice crowd, not by any manner of means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe small door opened just a little way, and they found themselves on a\r\nnarrow stone-flagged path, leading into a square yard. A few men were\r\nout there, smoking.\r\n\r\nBefore preceding her into the building which rose at the back of the\r\nyard, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s kind new friend took out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother twenty minutes before they\xe2\x80\x99ll begin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmortuary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed with his thumb to a low room built out to the\r\nright of the court. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to go in and see them?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, in a tone of extreme horror. And he looked down at\r\nher with sympathy, and with increased respect. She was a nice,\r\nrespectable woman, she was. She had not come here imbued with any\r\nmorbid, horrible curiosity, but because she thought it her duty to do\r\nso. He suspected her of being sister-in-law to one of The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nThey walked through into a big room or hall, now full of men talking in\r\nsubdued yet eager, animated tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better sit down here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said considerately, and,\r\nleading her to one of the benches that stood out from the whitewashed\r\nwalls\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunless you\xe2\x80\x99d rather be with the witnesses, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut again she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cOughtn\xe2\x80\x99t I to\r\ngo into the court now, if it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be so full?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you get a proper place. I\r\nmust leave you now for a minute, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back in good time and\r\nlook after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised the thick veil she had pulled down over her face while they\r\nwere going through that sinister, wolfish-looking crowd outside, and\r\nlooked about her.\r\n\r\nMany of the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94they mostly wore tall hats and good\r\novercoats\xe2\x80\x94standing round and about her looked vaguely familiar. She\r\npicked out one at once. He was a famous journalist, whose shrewd,\r\nanimated face was familiar to her owing to the fact that it was widely\r\nadvertised in connection with a preparation for the hair\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npreparation which in happier, more prosperous days Bunting had had\r\ngreat faith in, and used, or so he always said, with great benefit to\r\nhimself. This gentleman was the centre of an eager circle; half a dozen\r\nmen were talking to him, listening deferentially when he spoke, and\r\neach of these men, so Mrs. Bunting realised, was a Somebody.\r\n\r\nHow strange, how amazing, to reflect that from all parts of London,\r\nfrom their doubtless important avocations, one unseen, mysterious\r\nbeckoner had brought all these men here together, to this sordid place,\r\non this bitterly cold, dreary day. Here they were, all thinking of,\r\ntalking of, evoking one unknown, mysterious personality\xe2\x80\x94that of the\r\nshadowy and yet terribly real human being who chose to call himself The\r\nAvenger. And somewhere, not so very far away from them all The Avenger\r\nwas keeping these clever, astute, highly trained minds\xe2\x80\x94aye, and bodies,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94at bay.\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Bunting, sitting here unnoticed, realised the irony of her\r\npresence among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mrs. Bunting that she had been sitting there a long\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94it was really about a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x94when her official friend\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter come along now,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll begin soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed him out into a passage, up a row of steep stone steps, and\r\nso into the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Court.\r\n\r\nThe court was big, well-lighted room, in some ways not unlike a chapel,\r\nthe more so that a kind of gallery ran half-way round, a gallery\r\nevidently set aside for the general public, for it was now crammed to\r\nits utmost capacity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting glanced timidly towards the serried row of faces. Had it\r\nnot been for her good fortune in meeting the man she was now following,\r\nit was there that she would have had to try and make her way. And she\r\nwould have failed. Those people had rushed in the moment the doors were\r\nopened, pushing, fighting their way in a way she could never have\r\npushed or fought.\r\n\r\nThere were just a few women among them, set, determined-looking women,\r\nbelonging to every class, but made one by their love of sensation and\r\ntheir power of forcing their way in where they wanted to be. But the\r\nwomen were few; the great majority of those standing there were men\xe2\x80\x94men\r\nwho were also representative of every class of Londoner.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the court was like an arena; it was sunk two or three\r\nsteps below the surrounding gallery. Just now it was comparatively\r\nclear of people, save for the benches on which sat the men who were to\r\ncompose the jury. Some way from these men, huddled together in a kind\r\nof big pew, stood seven people\xe2\x80\x94three women and four men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you see the witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the inspector, pointing these out\r\nto her. He supposed her to know one of them with familiar knowledge,\r\nbut, if that were so, she made no sign.\r\n\r\nBetween the windows, facing the whole room, was a kind of little\r\nplatform, on which stood a desk and an arm-chair. Mrs. Bunting guessed\r\nrightly that it was there the coroner would sit. And to the left of the\r\nplatform was the witness-stand, also raised considerably above the\r\njury.\r\n\r\nAmazingly different, and far, far more grim and awe-inspiring than the\r\nscene of the inquest which had taken place so long ago, on that bright\r\nApril day, in the village inn. There the coroner had sat on the same\r\nlevel as the jury, and the witnesses had simply stepped forward one by\r\none, and taken their place before him.\r\n\r\nLooking round her fearfully, Mrs. Bunting thought she would surely die\r\nif ever she were exposed to the ordeal of standing in that curious\r\nbox-like stand, and she stared across at the bench where sat the seven\r\nwitnesses with a feeling of sincere pity in her heart.\r\n\r\nBut even she soon realised that her pity was wasted. Each woman witness\r\nlooked eager, excited, and animated; well pleased to be the centre of\r\nattention and attraction to the general public. It was plain each was\r\nenjoying her part of important, if humble, actress in the thrilling\r\ndrama which was now absorbing the attention of all London\xe2\x80\x94it might\r\nalmost be said of the whole world.\r\n\r\nLooking at these women, Mrs. Bunting wondered vaguely which was which.\r\nWas it that rather draggle-tailed-looking young person who had\r\ncertainly, or almost certainly, seen The Avenger within ten seconds of\r\nthe double crime being committed? The woman who, aroused by one of his\r\nvictims\xe2\x80\x99 cry of terror, had rushed to her window and seen the\r\nmurderer\xe2\x80\x99s shadowy form pass swiftly by in the fog?\r\n\r\nYet another woman, so Mrs. Bunting now remembered, had given a most\r\ncircumstantial account of what The Avenger looked like, for he, it was\r\nsupposed, had actually brushed by her as he passed.\r\n\r\nThose two women now before her had been interrogated and cross-examined\r\nagain and again, not only by the police, but by representatives of\r\nevery newspaper in London. It was from what they had both\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94unluckily their accounts materially differed\xe2\x80\x94that that official\r\ndescription of The Avenger had been worked up\xe2\x80\x94that which described him\r\nas being a good-looking, respectable young fellow of twenty-eight,\r\ncarrying a newspaper parcel.\r\n\r\nAs for the third woman, she was doubtless an acquaintance, a boon\r\ncompanion of the dead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked away from the witnesses, and focused her gaze on\r\nanother unfamiliar sight. Specially prominent, running indeed through\r\nthe whole length of the shut-in space, that is, from the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s high\r\ndais right across to the opening in the wooden barrier, was an\r\nink-splashed table at which, when she had first taken her place, there\r\nhad been sitting three men busily sketching; but now every seat at the\r\ntable was occupied by tired, intelligent-looking men, each with a\r\nnotebook, or with some loose sheets of paper, before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s the reporters,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t like coming\r\ntill the last minute, for they has to be the last to go. At an ordinary\r\ninquest there are only two\xe2\x80\x94maybe three\xe2\x80\x94attending, but now every paper\r\nin the kingdom has pretty well applied for a pass to that reporters\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked consideringly down into the well of the court. \xe2\x80\x9cNow let me\r\nsee what I can do for you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he beckoned to the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s officer: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you could put this\r\nlady just over there, in a corner by herself? Related to a relation of\r\nthe deceased, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He whispered a word or two, and\r\nthe other nodded sympathetically, and looked at Mrs. Bunting with\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put her just here,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one coming\r\nthere to-day. You see, there are only seven witnesses\xe2\x80\x94sometimes we have\r\na lot more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he kindly put her on a now empty bench opposite to where the seven\r\nwitnesses stood and sat with their eager, set faces, ready\xe2\x80\x94aye, more\r\nthan ready\xe2\x80\x94to play their part.\r\n\r\nFor a moment every eye in the court was focused on Mrs. Bunting, but\r\nsoon those who had stared so hungrily, so intently, at her, realised\r\nthat she had nothing to do with the case. She was evidently there as a\r\nspectator, and, more fortunate than most, she had a \xe2\x80\x9cfriend at court,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand so was able to sit comfortably, instead of having to stand in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nBut she was not long left in isolation. Very soon some of the\r\nimportant-looking gentlemen she had seen downstairs came into the\r\ncourt, and were ushered over to her seat while two or three among them,\r\nincluding the famous writer whose face was so familiar that it almost\r\nseemed to Mrs. Bunting like that of a kindly acquaintance, were\r\naccommodated at the reporters\xe2\x80\x99 table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, the Coroner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jury stood up, shuffling their feet, and then sat down again; over\r\nthe spectators there fell a sudden silence.\r\n\r\nAnd then what immediately followed recalled to Mrs. Bunting, for the\r\nfirst time, that informal little country inquest of long ago.\r\n\r\nFirst came the \xe2\x80\x9cOyez! Oyez!\xe2\x80\x9d the old Norman-French summons to all whose\r\nbusiness it is to attend a solemn inquiry into the death\xe2\x80\x94sudden,\r\nunexplained, terrible\xe2\x80\x94of a fellow-being.\r\n\r\nThe jury\xe2\x80\x94there were fourteen of them\xe2\x80\x94all stood up again. They raised\r\ntheir hands and solemnly chanted together the curious words of their\r\noath.\r\n\r\nThen came a quick, informal exchange of sentences \xe2\x80\x99twixt the coroner\r\nand his officer.\r\n\r\nYes, everything was in order. The jury had viewed the bodies\xe2\x80\x94he quickly\r\ncorrected himself\xe2\x80\x94the body, for, technically speaking, the inquest just\r\nabout to be held only concerned one body.\r\n\r\nAnd then, amid a silence so absolute that the slightest rustle could be\r\nheard through the court, the coroner\xe2\x80\x94a clever-looking gentleman, though\r\nnot so old as Mrs. Bunting thought he ought to have been to occupy so\r\nimportant a position on so important a day\xe2\x80\x94gave a little history, as it\r\nwere, of the terrible and mysterious Avenger crimes.\r\n\r\nHe spoke very clearly, warming to his work as he went on.\r\n\r\nHe told them that he had been present at the inquest held on one of The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x99s former victims. \xe2\x80\x9cI only went through professional curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe threw in by way of parenthesis, \xe2\x80\x9clittle thinking, gentlemen, that\r\nthe inquest on one of these unhappy creatures would ever be held in my\r\ncourt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn and on, he went, though he had, in truth, but little to say, and\r\nthough that little was known to every one of his listeners.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting heard one of the older gentlemen sitting near her whisper\r\nto another: \xe2\x80\x9cDrawing it out all he can; that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Having\r\nthe time of his life, evidently!\xe2\x80\x9d And then the other whispered back, so\r\nlow that she could only just catch the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood chap\xe2\x80\x94I knew his father; we were at school together. Takes his job\r\nvery seriously, you know\xe2\x80\x94he does to-day, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was listening intently, waiting for a word, a sentence, which would\r\nrelieve her hidden terrors, or, on the other hand, confirm them. But\r\nthe word, the sentence, was never uttered.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at the very end of his long peroration, the coroner did throw\r\nout a hint which might mean anything\xe2\x80\x94or nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to say that we hope to obtain such evidence to-day as will\r\nin time lead to the apprehension of the miscreant who has committed,\r\nand is still committing, these terrible crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting stared uneasily up into the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s firm,\r\ndetermined-looking face. What did he mean by that? Was there any new\r\nevidence\xe2\x80\x94evidence of which Joe Chandler, for instance, was ignorant?\r\nAnd, as if in answer to the unspoken question, her heart gave a sudden\r\nleap, for a big, burly man had taken his place in the witness-box\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npoliceman who had not been sitting with the other witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut soon her uneasy terror became stilled. This witness was simply the\r\nconstable who had found the first body. In quick, business-like tones\r\nhe described exactly what had happened to him on that cold, foggy\r\nmorning ten days ago. He was shown a plan, and he marked it slowly,\r\ncarefully, with a thick finger. That was the exact place\xe2\x80\x94no, he was\r\nmaking a mistake\xe2\x80\x94that was the place where the other body had lain. He\r\nexplained apologetically that he had got rather mixed up between the\r\ntwo bodies\xe2\x80\x94that of Johanna Cobbett and Sophy Hurtle.\r\n\r\nAnd then the coroner intervened authoritatively: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the purpose of\r\nthis inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must, I think, for a moment consider the\r\ntwo murders together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, the witness went on far more comfortably; and as he\r\nproceeded, in a quick monotone, the full and deadly horror of The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x99s acts came over Mrs. Bunting in a great seething flood of sick\r\nfear and\xe2\x80\x94and, yes, remorse.\r\n\r\nUp to now she had given very little thought\xe2\x80\x94if, indeed, any thought\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe drink-sodden victims of The Avenger. It was he who had filled her\r\nthoughts,\xe2\x80\x94he and those who were trying to track him down. But now? Now\r\nshe felt sick and sorry she had come here to-day. She wondered if she\r\nwould ever be able to get the vision the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s words had conjured\r\nup out of her mind\xe2\x80\x94out of her memory.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came an eager stir of excitement and of attention\r\nthroughout the whole court, for the policeman had stepped down out of\r\nthe witness-box, and one of the women witnesses was being conducted to\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked with interest and sympathy at the woman,\r\nremembering how she herself had trembled with fear, trembled as that\r\npoor, bedraggled, common-looking person was trembling now. The woman\r\nhad looked so cheerful, so\xe2\x80\x94so well pleased with herself till a minute\r\nago, but now she had become very pale, and she looked round her as a\r\nhunted animal might have done.\r\n\r\nBut the coroner was very kind, very soothing and gentle in his manner,\r\njust as that other coroner had been when dealing with Ellen Green at\r\nthe inquest on that poor drowned girl.\r\n\r\nAfter the witness had repeated in a toneless voice the solemn words of\r\nthe oath, she began to be taken, step by step, though her story. At\r\nonce Mrs. Bunting realised that this was the woman who claimed to have\r\nseen The Avenger from her bedroom window. Gaining confidence, as she\r\nwent on, the witness described how she had heard a long-drawn, stifled\r\nscreech, and, aroused from deep sleep, had instinctively jumped out of\r\nbed and rushed to her window.\r\n\r\nThe coroner looked down at something lying on his desk. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see!\r\nHere is the plan. Yes\xe2\x80\x94I think I understand that the house in which you\r\nare lodging exactly faces the alley where the two crimes were\r\ncommitted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd there arose a quick, futile discussion. The house did not face the\r\nalley, but the window of the witness\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom faced the alley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA distinction without a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner testily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow tell us as clearly and quickly as you can what you saw when you\r\nlooked out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere fell a dead silence on the crowded court. And then the woman\r\nbroke out, speaking more volubly and firmly than she had yet done. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaw \xe2\x80\x99im!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forget it\xe2\x80\x94no, not till my dying\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked round defiantly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting suddenly remembered a chat one of the newspaper men had\r\nhad with a person who slept under this woman\xe2\x80\x99s room. That person had\r\nunkindly said she felt sure that Lizzie Cole had not got up that\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94that she had made up the whole story. She, the speaker, slept\r\nlightly, and that night had been tending a sick child. Accordingly, she\r\nwould have heard if there had been either the scream described by\r\nLizzie Cole, or the sound of Lizzie Cole jumping out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe quite understand that you think you saw the\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the coroner\r\nhesitated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe individual who had just perpetrated these terrible\r\ncrimes. But what we want to have from you is a description of him. In\r\nspite of the foggy atmosphere about which all are agreed, you say you\r\nsaw him distinctly, walking along for some yards below your window.\r\nNow, please, try and tell us what he was like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman began twisting and untwisting the corner of a coloured\r\nhandkerchief she held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us begin at the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner patiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort\r\nof a hat was this man wearing when you saw him hurrying from the\r\npassage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just a black \xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x9d said the witness at last, in a husky, rather\r\nanxious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94just a black hat. And a coat\xe2\x80\x94were you able to see what sort of a\r\ncoat he was wearing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99E \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t got no coat\xe2\x80\x9d she said decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo coat at all! I\r\nremembers that very perticulerly. I thought it queer, as it was so\r\ncold\xe2\x80\x94everybody as can wears some sort o\xe2\x80\x99 coat this weather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA juryman who had been looking at a strip of newspaper, and apparently\r\nnot attending at all to what the witness was saying, here jumped up and\r\nput out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d the coroner turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just want to say that this \xe2\x80\x99ere witness\xe2\x80\x94if her name is Lizzie Cole,\r\nbegan by saying The Avenger was wearing a coat\xe2\x80\x94a big, heavy coat. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot it here, in this bit of paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said so!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the woman passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI was made to say all\r\nthose things by the young man what came to me from the _Evening Sun_.\r\nJust put in what \xe2\x80\x99e liked in \xe2\x80\x99is paper, \xe2\x80\x99e did\xe2\x80\x94not what I said at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this there was some laughter, quickly suppressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn future,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner severely, addressing the juryman, who had\r\nnow sat down again, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must ask any question you wish to ask through\r\nyour foreman, and please wait till I have concluded my examination of\r\nthe witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this interruption, this\xe2\x80\x94this accusation, had utterly upset the\r\nwitness. She began contradicting herself hopelessly. The man she had\r\nseen hurrying by in the semi-darkness below was tall\xe2\x80\x94no, he was short.\r\nHe was thin\xe2\x80\x94no, he was a stoutish young man. And as to whether he was\r\ncarrying anything, there was quite an acrimonious discussion.\r\n\r\nMost positively, most confidently, the witness declared that she had\r\nseen a newspaper parcel under his arm; it had bulged out at the back\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nshe declared. But it was proved, very gently and firmly, that she had\r\nsaid nothing of the kind to the gentleman from Scotland Yard who had\r\ntaken down her first account\xe2\x80\x94in fact, to him she had declared\r\nconfidently that the man had carried nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all; that she\r\nhad seen his arms swinging up and down.\r\n\r\nOne fact\xe2\x80\x94if fact it could be called\xe2\x80\x94the coroner did elicit. Lizzie Cole\r\nsuddenly volunteered the statement that as he had passed her window he\r\nhad looked up at her. This was quite a new statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked up at you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the coroner. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said nothing of that\r\nin your examination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said nothink because I was scared\xe2\x80\x94nigh scared to death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could really see his countenance, for we know the night was\r\ndark and foggy, will you please tell me what he was like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the coroner was speaking casually, his hand straying over his desk;\r\nnot a creature in that court now believed the woman\xe2\x80\x99s story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cDark, almost black! If you can take\r\nmy meaning, with a sort of nigger look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a titter. Even the jury smiled. And sharply the\r\ncoroner bade Lizzie Cole stand down.\r\n\r\nFar more credence was given to the evidence of the next witness.\r\n\r\nThis was an older, quieter-looking woman, decently dressed in black.\r\nBeing the wife of a night watchman whose work lay in a big warehouse\r\nsituated about a hundred yards from the alley or passage where the\r\ncrimes had taken place, she had gone out to take her husband some food\r\nhe always had at one in the morning. And a man had passed her,\r\nbreathing hard and walking very quickly. Her attention had been drawn\r\nto him because she very seldom met anyone at that hour, and because he\r\nhad such an odd, peculiar look and manner.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting, listening attentively, realised that it was very much\r\nfrom what this witness had said that the official description of The\r\nAvenger had been composed\xe2\x80\x94that description which had brought such\r\ncomfort to her, Ellen Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s, soul.\r\n\r\nThis witness spoke quietly, confidently, and her account of the\r\nnewspaper parcel the man was carrying was perfectly clear and positive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a neat parcel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdone up with string.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had thought it an odd thing for a respectably dressed young man to\r\ncarry such a parcel\xe2\x80\x94that was what had made her notice it. But when\r\npressed, she had to admit that it had been a very foggy night\xe2\x80\x94so foggy\r\nthat she herself had been afraid of losing her way, though every step\r\nwas familiar.\r\n\r\nWhen the third woman went into the box, and with sighs and tears told\r\nof her acquaintance with one of the deceased, with Johanna Cobbett,\r\nthere was a stir of sympathetic attention. But she had nothing to say\r\nthrowing any light on the investigation, save that she admitted\r\nreluctantly that \xe2\x80\x9cAnny\xe2\x80\x9d would have been such a nice, respectable young\r\nwoman if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the drink.\r\n\r\nHer examination was shortened as much as possible; and so was that of\r\nthe next witness, the husband of Johanna Cobbett. He was a very\r\nrespectable-looking man, a foreman in a big business house at Croydon.\r\nHe seemed to feel his position most acutely. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen his wife\r\nfor two years; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had news of her for six months. Before she\r\ntook to drink she had been an admirable wife, and\xe2\x80\x94and yes, mother.\r\n\r\nYet another painful few minutes, to anyone who had a heart, or\r\nimagination to understand, was spent when the father of the murdered\r\nwoman was in the box. He had had later news of his unfortunate daughter\r\nthan her husband had had, but of course he could throw no light at all\r\non her murder or murderer.\r\n\r\nA barman, who had served both the women with drink just before the\r\npublic-house closed for the night, was handled rather roughly. He had\r\nstepped with a jaunty air into the box, and came out of it looking cast\r\ndown, uneasy.\r\n\r\nAnd then there took place a very dramatic, because an utterly\r\nunexpected, incident. It was one of which the evening papers made the\r\nutmost much to Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s indignation. But neither coroner nor\r\njury\xe2\x80\x94and they, after all, were the people who mattered\xe2\x80\x94thought a great\r\ndeal of it.\r\n\r\nThere had come a pause in the proceedings. All seven witnesses had been\r\nheard, and a gentleman near Mrs. Bunting whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are now going\r\nto call Dr. Gaunt. He\xe2\x80\x99s been in every big murder case for the last\r\nthirty years. He\xe2\x80\x99s sure to have something interesting to say. It was\r\nreally to hear him _I_ came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut before Dr. Gaunt had time even to get up from the seat with which\r\nhe had been accommodated close to the coroner, there came a stir among\r\nthe general public, or, rather, among those spectators who stood near\r\nthe low wooden door which separated the official part of the court from\r\nthe gallery.\r\n\r\nThe coroner\xe2\x80\x99s officer, with an apologetic air, approached the coroner,\r\nand handed him up an envelope. And again in an instant, there fell\r\nabsolute silence on the court.\r\n\r\nLooking rather annoyed, the coroner opened the envelope. He glanced\r\ndown the sheet of notepaper it contained. Then he looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d then he glanced down again. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\xe2\x80\x94is it Cannot?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ndoubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cmay come forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere ran a titter though the spectators, and the coroner frowned.\r\n\r\nA neat, jaunty-looking old gentleman, in a nice fur-lined overcoat,\r\nwith a fresh, red face and white side-whiskers, was conducted from the\r\nplace where he had been standing among the general public, to the\r\nwitness-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is somewhat out of order, Mr.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner\r\nseverely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have sent me this note before the proceedings\r\nbegan. This gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the jury, \xe2\x80\x9cinforms me that\r\nhe has something of the utmost importance to reveal in connection with\r\nour investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have remained silent\xe2\x80\x94I have locked what I knew within my own\r\nbreast\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94began Mr. Cannot in a quavering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I am so afraid\r\nof the Press! I knew if I said anything, even to the police, that my\r\nhouse would be besieged by reporters and newspaper men. . . . I have a\r\ndelicate wife, Mr. Coroner. Such a state of things\xe2\x80\x94the state of things\r\nI imagine\xe2\x80\x94might cause her death\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I hope she will never read a\r\nreport of these proceedings. Fortunately, she has an excellent trained\r\nnurse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will now take the oath,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner sharply. He already\r\nregretted having allowed this absurd person to have his say.\r\n\r\nMr. Cannot took the oath with a gravity and decorum which had been\r\nlacking in most of those who had preceded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will address myself to the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in the coroner. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, please\r\nattend to me. You assert in your letter that you know who is the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Mr. Cannot promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe perpetrator of these crimes. You further declare that you met him\r\non the very night he committed the murder we are now investigating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so declare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Cannot confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cThough in the best of\r\nhealth myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he beamed round the court, a now amused, attentive\r\ncourt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is my fate to be surrounded by sick people, to have only\r\nailing friends. I have to trouble you with my private affairs, Mr.\r\nCoroner, in order to explain why I happened to be out at so undue an\r\nhour as one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain a titter ran through the court. Even the jury broke into broad\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the witness solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI was with a sick friend\xe2\x80\x94in fact,\r\nI may say a dying friend, for since then he has passed away. I will not\r\nreveal my exact dwelling-place; you, sir, have it on my notepaper. It\r\nis not necessary to reveal it, but you will understand me when I say\r\nthat in order to come home I had to pass through a portion of the\r\nRegent\xe2\x80\x99s Park; and it was there\xe2\x80\x94to be exact, about the middle of\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s Terrace\xe2\x80\x94when a very peculiar-looking individual stopped and\r\naccosted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s hand shot up to her breast. A feeling of deadly fear\r\ntook possession of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t faint,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t faint!\r\nWhatever\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me?\xe2\x80\x9d She took out her bottle of\r\nsmelling-salts, and gave it a good, long sniff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a grim, gaunt man, was this stranger, Mr. Coroner, with a very\r\nodd-looking face. I should say an educated man\xe2\x80\x94in common parlance, a\r\ngentleman. What drew my special attention to him was that he was\r\ntalking aloud to himself\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he seemed to be repeating poetry. I\r\ngive you my word, I had no thought of The Avenger, no thought at all.\r\nTo tell you the truth, I thought this gentleman was a poor escaped\r\nlunatic, a man who\xe2\x80\x99d got away from his keeper. The Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, sir,\r\nas I need hardly tell you, is a most quiet and soothing neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then a member of the general public gave a loud guffaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to you; sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman suddenly cried out \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nprotect me from this unseemly levity! I have not come here with any\r\nother object than that of doing my duty as a citizen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask you to keep to what is strictly relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner\r\nstiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cTime is going on, and I have another important witness to\r\ncall\xe2\x80\x94a medical witness. Kindly tell me, as shortly as possible, what\r\nmade you suppose that this stranger could possibly be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d with an effort\r\nhe brought out for the first time since the proceedings began, the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming to that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Cannot hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am coming to that!\r\nBear with me a little longer, Mr. Coroner. It was a foggy night, but\r\nnot as foggy as it became later. And just when we were passing one\r\nanother, I and this man, who was talking aloud to himself\xe2\x80\x94he, instead\r\nof going on, stopped and turned towards me. That made me feel queer and\r\nuncomfortable, the more so that there was a very wild, mad look on his\r\nface. I said to him, as soothingly as possible, \xe2\x80\x98A very foggy night,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99 And he said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94yes, it is a foggy night, a night fit for the\r\ncommission of dark and salutary deeds.\xe2\x80\x99 A very strange phrase, sir,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98dark and salutary deeds.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the coroner expectantly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Well, Mr. Cannot? Was that all? Did you see this person go off\r\nin the direction of\xe2\x80\x94of King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cannot reluctantly shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I must honestly say I\r\ndid not. He walked along a certain way by my side, and then he crossed\r\nthe road and was lost in the fog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner. He spoke more kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\r\nMr. Cannot, for coming here and giving us what you evidently consider\r\nimportant information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cannot bowed, a funny, little, old-fashioned bow, and again some of\r\nthose present tittered rather foolishly.\r\n\r\nAs he was stepping down from the witness-box, he turned and looked up\r\nat the coroner, opening his lips as he did so. There was a murmur of\r\ntalking going on, but Mrs. Bunting, at any rate, heard quite distinctly\r\nwhat it was that he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I have forgotten, sir, which may be of importance. The man\r\ncarried a bag\xe2\x80\x94a rather light-coloured leather bag, in his left hand. It\r\nwas such a bag, sir, as might well contain a long-handled knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked at the reporters\xe2\x80\x99 table. She remembered suddenly\r\nthat she had told Bunting about the disappearance of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bag.\r\nAnd then a feeling of intense thankfulness came over her; not a single\r\nreporter at the long, ink-stained table had put down that last remark\r\nof Mr. Cannot. In fact, not one of them had heard it.\r\n\r\nAgain the last witness put up his hand to command attention. And then\r\nsilence did fall on the court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a quavering voice. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask to be\r\naccommodated with a seat for the rest of the proceedings? I see there\r\nis some room left on the witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 bench.\xe2\x80\x9d And, without waiting for\r\npermission, he nimbly stepped across and sat down.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked up, startled. Her friend, the inspector, was\r\nbending over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to come along now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said urgently.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose you want to hear the medical evidence. It\xe2\x80\x99s always painful for\r\na female to hear that. And there\xe2\x80\x99ll be an awful rush when the inquest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover. I could get you away quietly now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and, pulling her veil down over her pale face, followed him\r\nobediently.\r\n\r\nDown the stone staircase they went, and through the big, now empty,\r\nroom downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you out the back way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99re tired,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, and will like to get home to a cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d There were tears in her eyes. She was\r\ntrembling with excitement and emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_ been good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect you went\r\nthough a pretty bad time, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they be having that old gentleman again?\xe2\x80\x9d she spoke in a whisper,\r\nand looked up at him with a pleading, agonised look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, no! Crazy old fool! We\xe2\x80\x99re troubled with a lot of those sort\r\nof people, you know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and they often do have funny names, too.\r\nYou see, that sort is busy all their lives in the City, or what not;\r\nthen they retires when they gets about sixty, and they\xe2\x80\x99re fit to hang\r\nthemselves with dulness. Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of lunies of the sort to\r\nbe met in London. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go about at night and not meet \xe2\x80\x99em. Plenty\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was anything in what he said?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nventured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what that old gent said? Goodness\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed good-naturedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I _do_ think. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for the time that\r\nhad gone by, I should believe that the second witness _had_ seen that\r\ncrafty devil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, there, Dr. Gaunt declares\r\nmost positively\xe2\x80\x94so did two other medical gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94that the poor\r\ncreatures had been dead hours when they was found. Medical gentlemen\r\nare always very positive about their evidence. They have to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94otherwise who\xe2\x80\x99d believe \xe2\x80\x99em? If we\xe2\x80\x99d time I could tell you of a case\r\nin which\xe2\x80\x94well, \xe2\x80\x99twas all because of Dr. Gaunt that the murderer\r\nescaped. We all knew perfectly well the man we caught did it, but he\r\nwas able to prove an alibi as to the time Dr. Gaunt _said_ the poor\r\nsoul was killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not late even now, for the inquest had begun very punctually,\r\nbut Mrs. Bunting felt that no power on earth should force her to go to\r\nEaling. She felt quite tired out and as if she could think of nothing.\r\n\r\nPacing along very slowly, as if she were an old, old woman, she began\r\nlistlessly turning her steps towards home. Somehow she felt that it\r\nwould do her more good to stay out in the air than take the train. Also\r\nshe would thus put off the moment\xe2\x80\x94the moment to which she looked\r\nforward with dread and dislike\xe2\x80\x94when she would have to invent a\r\ncircumstantial story as to what she had said to the doctor, and what\r\nthe doctor had said to her.\r\n\r\nLike most men and women of his class, Bunting took a great interest in\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s ailments, the more interest that he was himself so\r\nremarkably healthy. He would feel quite injured if Ellen didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nhim everything that had happened; everything, that is, that the doctor\r\nhad told her.\r\n\r\nAs she walked swiftly along, at every corner, or so it seemed to her,\r\nand outside every public-house, stood eager boys selling the latest\r\nedition of the afternoon papers to equally eager buyers. \xe2\x80\x9cAvenger\r\nInquest?\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted exultantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the latest evidence!\xe2\x80\x9d At one\r\nplace, where there were a row of contents-bills pinned to the pavement\r\nby stones, she stopped and looked down. \xe2\x80\x9cOpening of the Avenger\r\nInquest. What is he really like? Full description.\xe2\x80\x9d On yet another ran\r\nthe ironic query: \xe2\x80\x9cAvenger Inquest. Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as that facetious question stared up at her in huge print, Mrs.\r\nBunting turned sick\xe2\x80\x94so sick and faint that she did what she had never\r\ndone before in her life\xe2\x80\x94she pushed her way into a public-house, and,\r\nputting two pennies down on the counter, asked for, and received, a\r\nglass of cold water.\r\n\r\nAs she walked along the now gas-lit streets, she found her mind\r\ndwelling persistently\xe2\x80\x94not on the inquest at which she had been present,\r\nnot even on The Avenger, but on his victims.\r\n\r\nShudderingly, she visualised the two cold bodies lying in the mortuary.\r\nShe seemed also to see that third body, which, though cold, must yet be\r\nwarmer than the other two, for at this time yesterday The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast victim had been alive, poor soul\xe2\x80\x94alive and, according to a\r\ncompanion of hers whom the papers had already interviewed, particularly\r\nmerry and bright.\r\n\r\nHitherto Mrs. Bunting had been spared in any real sense a vision of The\r\nAvenger\xe2\x80\x99s victims. Now they haunted her, and she wondered wearily if\r\nthis fresh horror was to be added to the terrible fear which\r\nencompassed her night and day.\r\n\r\nAs she came within sight of home, her spirit suddenly lightened. The\r\nnarrow, drab-coloured little house, flanked each side by others exactly\r\nlike it in every single particular, save that their front yards were\r\nnot so well kept, looked as if it could, aye, and would, keep any\r\nsecret closely hidden.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, at any rate, The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s victims receded from her mind.\r\nShe thought of them no more. All her thoughts were concentrated on\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x94Bunting and Mr. Sleuth. She wondered what had happened during\r\nher absence\xe2\x80\x94whether the lodger had rung his bell, and, if so, how he\r\nhad got on with Bunting, and Bunting with him?\r\n\r\nShe walked up the little flagged path wearily, and yet with a pleasant\r\nfeeling of home-coming. And then she saw that Bunting must have been\r\nwatching for her behind the now closely drawn curtains, for before she\r\ncould either knock or ring he had opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was getting quite anxious about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Ellen,\r\nquick! You must be fair perished a day like now\xe2\x80\x94and you out so little\r\nas you are. Well? I hope you found the doctor all right?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at\r\nher with affectionate anxiety.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came a sudden, happy thought to Mrs. Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Evans wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in. I waited, and waited, and waited,\r\nbut he never came in at all. \xe2\x80\x99Twas my own fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly.\r\nEven at such a moment as this she told herself that though she had, in\r\na sort of way, a kind of right to lie to her husband, she had no sight\r\nto slander the doctor who had been so kind to her years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought\r\nto have sent him a card yesterday night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I was a\r\nfool to go all that way, just on chance of finding a doctor in. It\r\nstands to reason they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go out to people at all times of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope they gave you a cup of tea?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAnd again she hesitated, debating a point with herself: if the doctor\r\nhad a decent sort of servant, of course, she, Ellen Bunting, would have\r\nbeen offered a cup of tea, especially if she explained she\xe2\x80\x99d known him\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nShe compromised. \xe2\x80\x9cI was offered some,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a weak, tired\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there, Bunting, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I wanted it. I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nvery grateful for a cup now\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99d just make it for me over the\r\nring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course I will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just come in and sit down, my\r\ndear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble to take your things off now\xe2\x80\x94wait till you\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she obeyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the\r\ngirl would be back by the time I got home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ain\xe2\x80\x99t coming home to-day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there was an odd, sly, smiling look on\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she send a telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Young Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s just come in and told me. He\xe2\x80\x99s been over there\r\nand,\xe2\x80\x94would you believe it, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s managed to make friends with\r\nMargaret. Wonderful what love will do, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? He went over there\r\njust to help Daisy carry her bag back, you know, and then Margaret told\r\nhim that her lady had sent her some money to go to the play, and she\r\nactually asked Joe to go with them this evening\xe2\x80\x94she and Daisy\xe2\x80\x94to the\r\npantomime. Did you ever hear o\xe2\x80\x99 such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nice for them, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting absently. But she was\r\npleased\xe2\x80\x94pleased to have her mind taken off herself. \xe2\x80\x9cThen when is that\r\ngirl coming home?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it appears that Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s got to-morrow morning off too\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nevening and to-morrow morning. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be on duty all night, but he\r\nproposes to go over and bring Daisy back in time for early dinner. Will\r\nthat suit you, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t grudge the girl her bit\r\nof pleasure. One\xe2\x80\x99s only young once. By the way, did the lodger ring\r\nwhile I was out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting turned round from the gas-ring, which he was watching to see\r\nthe kettle boil. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to think of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a\r\nfunny thing, but the truth is, Ellen, I never gave Mr. Sleuth a\r\nthought. You see, Chandler came in and was telling me all about\r\nMargaret, laughing-like, and then something else happened while you was\r\nout, Ellen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething else happened?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a startled voice. Getting up\r\nfrom her chair she came towards her husband: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened? Who came?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a message for me, asking if I could go to-night to wait at a\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party. In Hanover Terrace it is. A waiter\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthem nasty Swiss fellows as works for nothing\xe2\x80\x94fell out just at the last\r\nminute and so they had to send for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis honest face shone with triumph. The man who had taken over his old\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s business in Baker Street had hitherto behaved very badly to\r\nBunting, and that though Bunting had been on the books for ever so\r\nlong, and had always given every satisfaction. But this new man had\r\nnever employed him\xe2\x80\x94no, not once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t make yourself too cheap?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife jealously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! I hum\xe2\x80\x99d and haw\xe2\x80\x99d a lot; and I could see the fellow\r\nwas quite worried\xe2\x80\x94in fact, at the end he offered me half-a-crown more.\r\nSo I graciously consented!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHusband and wife laughed more merrily than they had done for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t mind being alone, here? I don\xe2\x80\x99t count the lodger\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting looked at her anxiously. He was only prompted to ask the\r\nquestion because lately Ellen had been so queer, so unlike herself.\r\nOtherwise it never would have occurred to him that she could be afraid\r\nof being alone in the house. She had often been so in the days when he\r\ngot more jobs.\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, a little suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cI be afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Why should I be? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been afraid before. What\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99you exactly mean by that, Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing. I only thought you might feel funny-like, all alone on\r\nthis ground floor. You was so upset yesterday when that young fool\r\nChandler came, dressed up, to the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been frightened if he\xe2\x80\x99d just been an ordinary\r\nstranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said something silly to me\xe2\x80\x94just in\r\nkeeping with his character-like, and it upset me. Besides, I feel\r\nbetter now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she was sipping gratefully her cup of tea, there came a noise\r\noutside, the shouts of newspaper-sellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just run out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cand see what\r\nhappened at that inquest to-day. Besides, they may have a clue about\r\nthe horrible affair last night. Chandler was full of it\xe2\x80\x94when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalking about Daisy and Margaret, that is. He\xe2\x80\x99s on to-night, luckily\r\nnot till twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock; plenty of time to escort the two of \xe2\x80\x99em back\r\nafter the play. Besides, he said he\xe2\x80\x99ll put them into a cab and blow the\r\nexpense, if the panto\xe2\x80\x99 goes on too long for him to take \xe2\x80\x99em home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s always done \xe2\x80\x99em in couples, so to speak.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a try again to-night. However, even\r\nso, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s only on from midnight till five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Then he\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\nturn in a bit before going off to fetch Daisy, Fine thing to be young,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he\xe2\x80\x99d go out on such a night as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, staring at her. Ellen had spoken so\r\noddly, as if to herself, and in so fierce and passionate a tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated\xe2\x80\x94and a great fear clutched at her heart.\r\nWhat had she said? She had been thinking aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, by saying he won\xe2\x80\x99t go out. Of course, he has to go out. Besides,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll have been to the play as it is. \xe2\x80\x99Twould be a pretty thing if the\r\npolice didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out, just because it was cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I was thinking of The Avenger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting. She looked at her\r\nhusband fixedly. Somehow she had felt impelled to utter those true\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t take no heed of heat nor cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting sombrely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntake it the man\xe2\x80\x99s dead to all human feeling\xe2\x80\x94saving, of course,\r\nrevenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s your idea about him, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked across at her\r\nhusband. Somehow this dangerous, this perilous conversation between\r\nthem attracted her strangely. She felt as if she must go on with it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think he was the man that woman said she saw? That young man\r\nwhat passed her with a newspaper parcel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that \xe2\x80\x99twas from the bedroom\r\nwindow a woman saw him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I mean the _other_ woman, what was taking her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreakfast to him in the warehouse. She was far the most\r\nrespectable-looking woman of the two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting impatiently.\r\n\r\nAnd then, seeing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s look of utter, blank astonishment, she\r\nfelt a thrill of unreasoning terror. She must have gone suddenly mad to\r\nhave said what she did! Hurriedly she got up from her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9chere I am gossiping all about nothing when I ought to\r\nbe seeing about the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s supper. It was someone in the train talked\r\nto me about that person as thinks she saw The Avenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she went into her bedroom, lit the gas,\r\nand shut the door. A moment later she heard Bunting go out to buy the\r\npaper they had both forgotten during their dangerous discussion.\r\n\r\nAs she slowly, languidly took off her nice, warm coat and shawl, Mrs.\r\nBunting found herself shivering. It was dreadfully cold, quite\r\nunnaturally cold even for the time of year.\r\n\r\nShe looked longingly towards the fireplace. It was now concealed by the\r\nwashhand-stand, but how pleasant it would be to drag that stand aside\r\nand light a bit of fire, especially as Bunting was going to be out\r\nto-night. He would have to put on his dress clothes, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike his dressing in the sitting-room. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit her ideas that he\r\nshould do so. How if she did light the fire here, in their bedroom? It\r\nwould be nice for her to have bit of fire to cheer her up after he had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting knew only too well that she would have very little sleep\r\nthe coming night. She looked over, with shuddering distaste, at her\r\nnice, soft bed. There she would lie, on that couch of little ease,\r\nlistening\xe2\x80\x94listening. . . .\r\n\r\nShe went down to the kitchen. Everything was ready for Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupper, for she had made all her preparations before going out so as\r\nnot to have to hurry back before it suited her to do so.\r\n\r\nLeaning the tray for a moment on the top of the banisters, she\r\nlistened. Even in that nice warm drawing-room, and with a good fire,\r\nhow cold the lodger must feel sitting studying at the table! But\r\nunwonted sounds were coming through the door. Mr. Sleuth was moving\r\nrestlessly about the room, not sitting reading, as was his wont at this\r\ntime of the evening.\r\n\r\nShe knocked, and then waited a moment.\r\n\r\nThere came the sound of a sharp click, that of the key turning in the\r\nlock of the chiffonnier cupboard\xe2\x80\x94or so Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady could have\r\nsworn.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause\xe2\x80\x94she knocked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth loudly, and she opened the door and carried\r\nin the tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a little earlier than usual, are you not Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a touch of irritation in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, sir, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out. Perhaps I lost count of the\r\ntime. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d like your breakfast early, as you had dinner\r\nrather sooner than usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast? Did you say breakfast, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure! I meant supper.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her\r\nfixedly. It seemed to Mrs. Bunting that there was a terrible\r\nquestioning look in his dark, sunken eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you well?\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look well, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not well. I went over to see a doctor this\r\nafternoon, to Ealing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he did you good, Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s voice had become\r\nsofter, kinder in quality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt always does me good to see the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting\r\nevasively.\r\n\r\nAnd then a very odd smile lit up Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cDoctors are a\r\nmaligned body of men,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you speak well of\r\nthem. They do their best, Mrs. Bunting. Being human they are liable to\r\nerr, but I assure you they do their best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they do, sir\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she spoke heartily, sincerely. Doctors had\r\nalways treated her most kindly, and even generously.\r\n\r\nAnd then, having laid the cloth, and put the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s one hot dish upon\r\nit, she went towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like me to bring up\r\nanother scuttleful of coals, sir? it\xe2\x80\x99s bitterly cold\xe2\x80\x94getting colder\r\nevery minute. A fearful night to have to go out in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she looked at him\r\ndeprecatingly.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Sleuth did something which startled her very much. Pushing\r\nhis chair back, he jumped up and drew himself to his full height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say that, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, fascinated, affrighted. Again there came an awful\r\nquestioning look over his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of Bunting, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a job to-night. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nact as waiter at a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party. I was thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npity he has to turn out, and in his thin clothes, too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she brought out\r\nher words jerkily.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth seemed somewhat reassured, and again he sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that! I hope your husband will not\r\ncatch cold, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she shut the door, and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nWithout telling Bunting what she meant to do, she dragged the heavy\r\nwashhand-stand away from the chimneypiece, and lighted the fire.\r\n\r\nThen in some triumph she called Bunting in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime for you to dress,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nlittle bit of fire for you to dress by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he exclaimed at her extravagance, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99twill be pleasant for me,\r\ntoo; keep me company-like while you\xe2\x80\x99re out; and make the room nice and\r\nwarm when you come in. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be fair perished, even walking that short\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then, while her husband was dressing, Mrs. Bunting went upstairs\r\nand cleared away Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s supper.\r\n\r\nThe lodger said no word while she was so engaged\xe2\x80\x94no word at all.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting away from the table, rather an unusual thing for him to\r\ndo, and staring into the fire, his hands on his knees.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth looked lonely, very, very lonely and forlorn. Somehow, a\r\ngreat rush of pity, as well as of horror, came over Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart. He was such a\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94she searched for a word in her mind, but could\r\nonly find the word \xe2\x80\x9cgentle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was such a nice, gentle gentleman, was\r\nMr. Sleuth. Lately he had again taken to leaving his money about, as he\r\nhad done the first day or two, and with some concern his landlady had\r\nseen that the store had diminished a good deal. A very simple\r\ncalculation had made her realise that almost the whole of that missing\r\nmoney had come her way, or, at any rate, had passed through her hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth never stinted himself as to food, or stinted them, his\r\nlandlord and his landlady, as to what he had said he would pay. And\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s conscience pricked her a little, for he hardly ever used\r\nthat room upstairs\xe2\x80\x94that room for which he had paid extra so generously.\r\nIf Bunting got another job or two through that nasty man in Baker\r\nStreet,\xe2\x80\x94and now that the ice had been broken between them it was very\r\nprobable that he would do so, for he was a very well-trained,\r\nexperienced waiter\xe2\x80\x94then she thought she would tell Mr. Sleuth that she\r\nno longer wanted him to pay as much as he was now doing.\r\n\r\nShe looked anxiously, deprecatingly, at his long, bent back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth turned round. His face looked sad and worn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shall sleep well. But perhaps I shall take a little\r\nturn first. Such is my way, Mrs. Bunting; after I have been studying\r\nall day I require a little exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go out to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said deprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t fit\r\nfor anyone to be out in the bitter cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked at her attentively\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere will probably be\r\nmany people out in the streets to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA many more than usual, I fear, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not a strange thing, Mrs.\r\nBunting, that people who have all day in which to amuse themselves\r\nshould carry their revels far into the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of revellers, sir; I was thinking\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhesitated, then, with a gasping effort Mrs. Bunting brought out the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cof the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police?\xe2\x80\x9d He put up his right hand and stroked his chin two or\r\nthree times with a nervous gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is man\xe2\x80\x94what is man\xe2\x80\x99s puny\r\npower or strength against that of God, or even of those over whose feet\r\nGod has set a guard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth looked at his landlady with a kind of triumph lighting up\r\nhis face, and Mrs. Bunting felt a shuddering sense of relief. Then she\r\nhad not offended her lodger? She had not made him angry by that,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94was it a hint she had meant to convey to him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said respectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Providence means us to\r\ntake care o\xe2\x80\x99 ourselves too.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she closed the door behind her\r\nand went downstairs.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady did not go on, down to the kitchen. She came\r\ninto her sitting-room, and, careless of what Bunting would think the\r\nnext morning, put the tray with the remains of the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s meal on her\r\ntable. Having done that, and having turned out the gas in the passage\r\nand the sitting-room, she went into her bedroom and closed the door.\r\n\r\nThe fire was burning brightly and clearly. She told herself that she\r\ndid not need any other light to undress by.\r\n\r\nWhat was it made the flames of the fire shoot up, shoot down, in that\r\nqueer way? But watching it for awhile, she did at last doze off a bit.\r\n\r\nAnd then\xe2\x80\x94and then Mrs. Bunting woke with a sudden thumping of her\r\nheart. Woke to see that the fire was almost out\xe2\x80\x94woke to hear a quarter\r\nto twelve chime out\xe2\x80\x94woke at last to the sound she had been listening\r\nfor before she fell asleep\xe2\x80\x94the sound of Mr. Sleuth, wearing his\r\nrubber-soled shoes, creeping downstairs, along the passage, and so out,\r\nvery, very quietly by the front door.\r\n\r\nBut once she was in bed Mrs. Bunting turned restless. She tossed this\r\nway and that, full of discomfort and unease. Perhaps it was the\r\nunaccustomed firelight dancing on the walls, making queer shadows all\r\nround her, which kept her so wide awake.\r\n\r\nShe lay thinking and listening\xe2\x80\x94listening and thinking. It even occurred\r\nto her to do the one thing that might have quieted her excited brain\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nget a book, one of those detective stories of which Bunting had a\r\nslender store in the next room, and then, lighting the gas, to sit up\r\nand read.\r\n\r\nNo, Mrs. Bunting had always been told it was very wrong to read in bed,\r\nand she was not in a mood just now to begin doing anything that she had\r\nbeen told was wrong. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very cold night\xe2\x80\x94so cold, so windy, so snow-laden was the\r\natmosphere, that everyone who could do so stayed indoors.\r\n\r\nBunting, however, was now on his way home from what had proved a really\r\npleasant job. A remarkable piece of luck had come his way this evening,\r\nall the more welcome because it was quite unexpected! The young lady at\r\nwhose birthday party he had been present in capacity of waiter had come\r\ninto a fortune that day, and she had had the gracious, the surprising\r\nthought of presenting each of the hired waiters with a sovereign!\r\n\r\nThis gift, which had been accompanied by a few kind words, had gone to\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s heart. It had confirmed him in his Conservative principles;\r\nonly gentlefolk ever behaved in that way; quiet, old-fashioned,\r\nrespectable, gentlefolk, the sort of people of whom those nasty\r\nRadicals know nothing and care less!\r\n\r\nBut the ex-butler was not as happy as he should have been. Slackening\r\nhis footsteps, he began to think with puzzled concern of how queer his\r\nwife had seemed lately. Ellen had become so nervous, so \xe2\x80\x9cjumpy,\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of her sometimes. She had never been really\r\ngood-tempered\xe2\x80\x94your capable, self-respecting woman seldom is\xe2\x80\x94but she had\r\nnever been like what she was now. And she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get better as the days\r\nwent on; in fact she got worse. Of late she had been quite hysterical,\r\nand for no reason at all! Take that little practical joke of young Joe\r\nChandler. Ellen knew quite well he often had to go about in some kind\r\nof disguise, and yet how she had gone on, quite foolish-like\xe2\x80\x94not at all\r\nas one would have expected her to do.\r\n\r\nThere was another queer thing about her which disturbed him in more\r\nsenses than one. During the last three weeks or so Ellen had taken to\r\ntalking in her sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she had cried out, only the night\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t true\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it said\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d And there had\r\nbeen a wail of horrible fear and revolt in her usually quiet, mincing\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nWhew! it was cold; and he had stupidly forgotten his gloves.\r\n\r\nHe put his hands in his pockets to keep them warm, and began walking\r\nmore quickly.\r\n\r\nAs he tramped steadily along, the ex-butler suddenly caught sight of\r\nhis lodger walking along the opposite side of the solitary street\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof those short streets leading off the broad road which encircles\r\nRegent\xe2\x80\x99s Park.\r\n\r\nWell! This was a funny time o\xe2\x80\x99 night to be taking a stroll for\r\npleasure, like!\r\n\r\nGlancing across, Bunting noticed that Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s tall, thin figure\r\nwas rather bowed, and that his head was bent toward the ground. His\r\nleft arm was thrust into his long Inverness cape, and so was quite\r\nhidden, but the other side of the cape bulged out, as if the lodger\r\nwere carrying a bag or parcel in the hand which hung down straight.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth was walking rather quickly, and as he walked he talked\r\naloud, which, as Bunting knew, is not unusual with gentlemen who live\r\nmuch alone. It was clear that he had not yet become aware of the\r\nproximity of his landlord.\r\n\r\nBunting told himself that Ellen was right. Their lodger was certainly a\r\nmost eccentric, peculiar person. Strange, was it not, that that odd,\r\nluny-like gentleman should have made all the difference to his,\r\nBunting\xe2\x80\x99s, and Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s happiness and comfort in life?\r\n\r\nAgain glancing across at Mr. Sleuth, he reminded himself, not for the\r\nfirst time, of this perfect lodger\xe2\x80\x99s one fault\xe2\x80\x94his odd dislike to meat,\r\nand to what Bunting vaguely called to himself, sensible food.\r\n\r\nBut there, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have everything! The more so that the lodger was\r\nnot one of those crazy vegetarians who won\xe2\x80\x99t eat eggs and cheese. No,\r\nhe was reasonable in this, as in everything else connected with his\r\ndealings with the Buntings.\r\n\r\nAs we know, Bunting saw far less of the lodger than did his wife.\r\nIndeed, he had been upstairs only three or four times since Mr. Sleuth\r\nhad been with them, and when his landlord had had occasion to wait on\r\nhim the lodger had remained silent. Indeed, their gentleman had made it\r\nvery clear that he did not like either the husband or wife to come up\r\nto his rooms without being definitely asked to do so.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, would be a good opportunity for a little genial\r\nconversation? Bunting felt pleased to see his lodger; it increased his\r\ngeneral comfortable sense of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the butler, still an active man for his years, crossed\r\nover the road, and, stepping briskly forward, began trying to overtake\r\nMr. Sleuth. But the more he hurried along, the more the other hastened,\r\nand that without ever turning round to see whose steps he could hear\r\nechoing behind him on the now freezing pavement.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s own footsteps were quite inaudible\xe2\x80\x94an odd circumstance,\r\nwhen you came to think of it\xe2\x80\x94as Bunting did think of it later, lying\r\nawake by Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s side in the pitch darkness. What it meant of\r\ncourse, was that the lodger had rubber soles on his shoes. Now Bunting\r\nhad never had a pair of rubber-soled shoes sent down to him to clean.\r\nHe had always supposed the lodger had only one pair of outdoor boots.\r\n\r\nThe two men\xe2\x80\x94the pursued and the pursuer\xe2\x80\x94at last turned into the\r\nMarylebone Road; they were now within a few hundred yards of home.\r\nPlucking up courage, Bunting called out, his voice echoing freshly on\r\nthe still air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth, sir? Mr. Sleuth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lodger stopped and turned round.\r\n\r\nHe had been walking so quickly, and he was in so poor a physical\r\ncondition, that the sweat was pouring down his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! So it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Mr. Bunting? I heard footsteps behind me, and I\r\nhurried on. I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d known that it was you; there are so many queer\r\ncharacters about at night in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on a night like this, sir. Only honest folk who have business out\r\nof doors would be out such a night as this. It _is_ cold, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then into Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s slow and honest mind there suddenly crept the\r\nquery as to what on earth Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s own business out could be on\r\nthis bitter night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d the lodger repeated; he was panting a little, and his words\r\ncame out sharp and quick through his thin lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I\r\nfind it cold, Mr. Bunting. When the snow falls, the air always becomes\r\nmilder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; but to-night there\xe2\x80\x99s such a sharp east wind. Why, it freezes\r\nthe very marrow in one\xe2\x80\x99s bones! Still, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like walking in\r\ncold weather to make one warm, as you seem to have found, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting noticed that Mr. Sleuth kept his distance in a rather strange\r\nway; he walked at the edge of the pavement, leaving the rest of it, on\r\nthe wall side, to his landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost my way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been over Primrose Hill to see\r\na friend of mine, a man with whom I studied when I was a lad, and then,\r\ncoming back, I lost my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow they had come right up to the little gate which opened on the\r\nshabby, paved court in front of the house\xe2\x80\x94that gate which now was never\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth, pushing suddenly forward, began walking up the flagged\r\npath, when, with a \xe2\x80\x9cBy your leave, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the ex-butler, stepping aside,\r\nslipped in front of his lodger, in order to open the front door for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs he passed by Mr. Sleuth, the back of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s bare left hand\r\nbrushed lightly against the long Inverness cape the lodger was wearing,\r\nand, to Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, the stretch of cloth against which his hand\r\nlay for a moment was not only damp, damp maybe from stray flakes of\r\nsnow which had settled upon it, but wet\xe2\x80\x94wet and gluey.\r\n\r\nBunting thrust his left hand into his pocket; it was with the other\r\nthat he placed the key in the lock of the door.\r\n\r\nThe two men passed into the hall together.\r\n\r\nThe house seemed blackly dark in comparison with the lighted-up road\r\noutside, and as he groped forward, closely followed by the lodger,\r\nthere came over Bunting a sudden, reeling sensation of mortal terror,\r\nan instinctive, assailing knowledge of frightful immediate danger.\r\n\r\nA stuffless voice\xe2\x80\x94the voice of his first wife, the long-dead girl to\r\nwhom his mind so seldom reverted nowadays\xe2\x80\x94uttered into his ear the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the lodger spoke. His voice was harsh and grating, though not\r\nloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Mr. Bunting, that you must have felt something dirty,\r\nfoul, on my coat? It\xe2\x80\x99s too long a story to tell you now, but I brushed\r\nup against a dead animal, a creature to whose misery some thoughtful\r\nsoul had put an end, lying across a bench on Primrose Hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, no. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice nothing. I scarcely touched you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if a power outside himself compelled Bunting to utter\r\nthese lying words. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying good-night to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nStepping back he pressed with all the strength that was in him against\r\nthe wall, and let the other pass him. There was a pause, and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Sleuth, in a hollow voice. Bunting\r\nwaited until the lodger had gone upstairs, and then, lighting the gas,\r\nhe sat down there, in the hall. Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlord felt very\r\nqueer\xe2\x80\x94queer and sick.\r\n\r\nHe did not draw his left hand out of his pocket till he heard Mr.\r\nSleuth shut the bedroom door upstairs. Then he held up his left hand\r\nand looked at it curiously; it was flecked, streaked with pale reddish\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nTaking off his boots, he crept into the room where his wife lay asleep.\r\nStealthily he walked across to the wash-hand-stand, and dipped a hand\r\ninto the water-jug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are you doing? What on earth are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d came a voice\r\nfrom the bed, and Bunting started guiltily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just washing my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing nothing of the sort! I never heard of such a\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94putting your hand into the water in which I was going to wash my\r\nface to-morrow morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said meekly; \xe2\x80\x9cI meant to throw it away. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I would have let you wash in dirty water, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said no more, but, as he began undressing himself, Mrs. Bunting lay\r\nstaring at him in a way that made her husband feel even more\r\nuncomfortable than he was already.\r\n\r\nAt last he got into bed. He wanted to break the oppressive silence by\r\ntelling Ellen about the sovereign the young lady had given him, but\r\nthat sovereign now seemed to Bunting of no more account than if it had\r\nbeen a farthing he had picked up in the road outside.\r\n\r\nOnce more his wife spoke, and he gave so great a start that it shook\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve left the light burning in\r\nthe hall, wasting our good money?\xe2\x80\x9d she observed tartly.\r\n\r\nHe got up painfully and opened the door into the passage. It was as she\r\nhad said; the gas was flaring away, wasting their good money\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nrather, Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s good money. Since he had come to be their lodger\r\nthey had not had to touch their rent money.\r\n\r\nBunting turned out the light and groped his way back to the room, and\r\nso to bed. Without speaking again to each other, both husband and wife\r\nlay awake till dawn.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlord awoke with a start; he felt\r\ncuriously heavy about the limbs, and tired about the eyes.\r\n\r\nDrawing his watch from under his pillow, he saw that it was seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Without waking his wife, he got out of bed and pulled the\r\nblind a little to one side. It was snowing heavily, and, as is the way\r\nwhen it snows, even in London, everything was strangely, curiously\r\nstill. After he had dressed he went out into the passage. As he had at\r\nonce dreaded and hoped, their newspaper was already lying on the mat.\r\nIt was probably the sound of its being pushed through the letter-box\r\nwhich had waked him from his unrestful sleep.\r\n\r\nHe picked the paper up and went into the sitting-room then, shutting\r\nthe door behind him carefully, he spread the newspaper wide open on the\r\ntable, and bent over it.\r\n\r\nAs Bunting at last looked up and straightened himself, an expression of\r\nintense relief shone upon his stolid face. The item of news he had felt\r\ncertain would be printed in big type on the middle sheet was not there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling amazingly light-hearted, almost light-headed, Bunting lit the\r\ngas-ring to make his wife her morning cup of tea.\r\n\r\nWhile he was doing it, he suddenly heard her call out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBunting!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cBunting!\xe2\x80\x9d Quickly he hurried in response\r\nto her call. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my dear? I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a minute\r\nwith your tea.\xe2\x80\x9d And he smiled broadly, rather foolishly.\r\n\r\nShe sat up and looked at him, a dazed expression on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you grinning at?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a wonderful piece of luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you was so\r\ncross last night that I simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare tell you about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell me now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a sovereign given me by the young lady. You see, it was her\r\nbirthday party, Ellen, and she\xe2\x80\x99d come into a nice bit of money, and she\r\ngave each of us waiters a sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting made no comment. Instead, she lay back and closed her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time d\xe2\x80\x99you expect Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked languidly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nwhat time Joe was going to fetch her, when we was talking about it\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Well, I expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, how long that old aunt of hers expects us to keep her?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bunting thoughtfully. All the cheer died out of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s round\r\nface. He became sullen and angry. It would be a pretty thing if he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have his own daughter for a bit\xe2\x80\x94especially now that they were\r\ndoing so well!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here just as long as she can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo bad of you, Ellen, to talk like that! She helps you all she can;\r\nand she brisks us both up ever so much. Besides, \xe2\x80\x99twould be cruel\xe2\x80\x94cruel\r\nto take the girl away just now, just as she and that young chap are\r\nmaking friends-like. One would suppose that even you would see the\r\njustice o\xe2\x80\x99 that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting made no answer.\r\n\r\nBunting went off, back into the sitting-room. The water was boiling\r\nnow, so he made the tea; and then, as he brought the little tray in,\r\nhis heart softened. Ellen did look really ill\xe2\x80\x94ill and wizened. He\r\nwondered if she had a pain about which she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t saying anything. She\r\nhad never been one to grouse about herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lodger and me came in together last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed genially.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a funny kind of gentleman. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of night\r\none would have chosen to go out for a walk, now was it? And yet he must\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a been out a long time if what he said was true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder a quiet gentleman like Mr. Sleuth hates the crowded\r\nstreets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey gets worse every day\xe2\x80\x94that they do! But\r\ngo along now; I want to get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back into their sitting-room, and, having laid the fire and put\r\na match to it, he sat down comfortably with his newspaper.\r\n\r\nDeep down in his heart Bunting looked back to this last night with a\r\nfeeling of shame and self-rebuke. Whatever had made such horrible\r\nthoughts and suspicions as had possessed him suddenly come into his\r\nhead? And just because of a trifling thing like that blood. No doubt\r\nMr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s nose had bled\xe2\x80\x94that was what had happened; though, come to\r\nthink of it, he _had_ mentioned brushing up against a dead animal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ellen was right after all. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t do for one to be always\r\nthinking of dreadful subjects, of murders and such-like. It made one go\r\ndotty\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it did.\r\n\r\nAnd just as he was telling himself that, there came to the door a loud\r\nknock, the peculiar rat-tat-tat of a telegraph boy. But before he had\r\ntime to get across the room, let alone to the front door, Ellen had\r\nrushed through the room, clad only in a petticoat and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go, Bunting; don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, surprised, and followed her into the hall.\r\n\r\nShe put out a hand, and hiding herself behind the door, took the\r\ntelegram from the invisible boy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an answer we\xe2\x80\x99ll send it out ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she tore the\r\nenvelope open\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a gasp of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only from Joe\r\nChandler, to say he can\xe2\x80\x99t go over to fetch Daisy this morning. Then\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked back into their sitting-room. \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere it\r\nis, Bunting. You just read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm on duty this morning. Cannot fetch Miss Daisy as\r\narranged.\xe2\x80\x94CHANDLER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why he\xe2\x80\x99s on duty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting slowly, uncomfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hours was as regular as clockwork\xe2\x80\x94that nothing could make\r\nany difference to them. However, there it is. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99ll do all\r\nright if I start about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock? It may have left off snowing by\r\nthen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like going out again just now. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty tired this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou start about twelve,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll give plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morning went on quietly, uneventfully. Bunting received a letter\r\nfrom Old Aunt saying Daisy must come back next Monday, a little under a\r\nweek from now. Mr. Sleuth slept soundly, or, at any rate, he made no\r\nsign of being awake; and though Mrs. Bunting often, stopped to listen,\r\nwhile she was doing her room, there came no sounds at all from\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nScarcely aware that it was so, both Bunting and his wife felt more\r\ncheerful than they had done for a long time. They had quite a pleasant\r\nlittle chat when Mrs. Bunting came and sat down for a bit, before going\r\ndown to prepare Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy will be surprised to see you\xe2\x80\x94not to say disappointed!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nobserved, and she could not help laughing a little to herself at the\r\nthought. And when, at eleven, Bunting got up to go, she made him stay\r\non a little longer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no such great hurry as that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\ngood-temperedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do quite well if you\xe2\x80\x99re there by half-past\r\ntwelve. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get dinner ready myself. Daisy needn\xe2\x80\x99t help with that. I\r\nexpect Margaret has worked her pretty hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at last there came the moment when Bunting had to start, and his\r\nwife went with him to the front door. It was still snowing, less\r\nheavily, but still snowing. There were very few people coming and\r\ngoing, and only just a few cabs and carts dragging cautiously along\r\nthrough the slush.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting was still in the kitchen when there came a ring and a\r\nknock at the door\xe2\x80\x94a now very familiar ring and knock. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe thinks\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s home again by now!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling to herself.\r\n\r\nBefore the door was well open, she heard Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nscared this time, Mrs. Bunting!\xe2\x80\x9d But though not exactly scared, she did\r\ngive a gasp of surprise. For there stood Joe, made up to represent a\r\npublic-house loafer; and he looked the part to perfection, with his\r\nhair combed down raggedly over his forehead, his seedy-looking,\r\nill-fitting, dirty clothes, and greenish-black pot hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\njust run in to know if Miss Daisy was safe home again. You got my\r\ntelegram all right? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t send no other kind of message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not back yet. Her father hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been gone long after her.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nstruck by a look in his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThere came a thrill of suspense in her voice, her face grew drawn,\r\nwhile what little colour there was in it receded, leaving it very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Bunting, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no business to say anything\r\nabout it\xe2\x80\x94but I _will_ tell _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked in and shut the door of the sitting-room carefully behind\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been another of \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this time no one\r\nis to know anything about it\xe2\x80\x94not for the present, I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected\r\nhimself hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Yard thinks we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a clue\xe2\x80\x94and a good clue,\r\ntoo, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x94and how?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99twas just a bit of luck being able to keep it dark for the\r\npresent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he still spoke in that stifled, hoarse whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor soul\r\nwas found dead on a bench on Primrose Hill. And just by chance \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\none of our fellows saw the body first. He was on his way home, over\r\nHampstead way. He knew where he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to get an ambulance quick,\r\nand he made a very clever, secret job of it. I \xe2\x80\x99spect he\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\npromotion for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the clue?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bunting, with dry lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said\r\nthere was a clue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly understand about the clue myself. All I knows is\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s got something to do with a public-house, \xe2\x80\x98The Hammer and Tongs,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhich isn\xe2\x80\x99t far off there. They feels sure The Avenger was in the bar\r\njust on closing-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Bunting sat down. She felt better now. It was natural the\r\npolice should suspect a public-house loafer. \xe2\x80\x9cThen that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to go and fetch Daisy, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cMum\xe2\x80\x99s the word, Mrs. Bunting! It\xe2\x80\x99ll all be in the last\r\neditions of the evening newspapers\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t be kep\xe2\x80\x99 out. There\xe2\x80\x99d be too\r\nmuch of a row if \xe2\x80\x99twas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going off to that public-house now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a awk\xe2\x80\x99ard job\xe2\x80\x94to try and worm something out of the\r\nbarmaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething out of the barmaid?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bunting nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nwhatever for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came and stood close to her. \xe2\x80\x9cThey think \xe2\x80\x99twas a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting stared at Chandler with a scared expression. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever\r\nmakes them think such a silly thing as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, just before closing-time a very peculiar-looking gent, with a\r\nleather bag in his hand, went into the bar and asked for a glass of\r\nmilk. And what d\xe2\x80\x99you think he did? Paid for it with a sovereign! He\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take no change\xe2\x80\x94just made the girl a present of it! That\xe2\x80\x99s why\r\nthe young woman what served him seems quite unwilling to give him away.\r\nShe won\xe2\x80\x99t tell now what he was like. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s wanted\r\nfor, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to know just yet. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason why\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x99s being said public about it. But there! I really must be going\r\nnow. My time\xe2\x80\x99ll be up at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I thought of coming in on the\r\nway back, and asking you for a cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, Joe. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d but there was no welcome\r\nin her tired voice.\r\n\r\nShe let him go alone to the door, and then she went down to her\r\nkitchen, and began cooking Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe lodger would be sure to ring soon; and then any minute Bunting and\r\nDaisy might be home, and they\xe2\x80\x99d want something, too. Margaret always\r\nhad breakfast even when \xe2\x80\x9cthe family\xe2\x80\x9d were away, unnaturally early.\r\n\r\nAs she bustled about Mrs. Bunting tried to empty her mind of all\r\nthought. But it is very difficult to do that when one is in a state of\r\ntorturing uncertainty. She had not dared to ask Chandler what they\r\nsupposed that man who had gone into the public-house was really like.\r\nIt was fortunate, indeed, that the lodger and that inquisitive young\r\nchap had never met face to face.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang\xe2\x80\x94a quiet little tinkle. But when she went\r\nup with his breakfast the lodger was not in his sitting-room.\r\n\r\nSupposing him to be still in his bedroom, Mrs. Bunting put the cloth on\r\nthe table, and then she heard the sound of his footsteps coming down\r\nthe stairs, and her quick ears detected the slight whirring sound which\r\nshowed that the gas-stove was alight. Mr. Sleuth had already lit the\r\nstove; that meant that he would carry out some elaborate experiment\r\nthis afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill snowing?\xe2\x80\x9d he said doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHow very, very quiet and still\r\nLondon is when under snow, Mrs. Bunting. I have never known it quite as\r\nquiet as this morning. Not a sound, outside or in. A very pleasant\r\nchange from the shouting which sometimes goes on in the Marylebone\r\nRoad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said dully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awful quiet to-day\xe2\x80\x94too quiet to my\r\nthinking. \xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t natural-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe outside gate swung to, making a noisy clatter in the still air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that someone coming in here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Sleuth, drawing a quick,\r\nhissing breath. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will oblige me by going to the window and\r\ntelling me who it is, Mrs. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his landlady obeyed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only Bunting, sir\xe2\x80\x94Bunting and his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth hurried after her, and she shrank back a little. She had\r\nnever been quite so near to the lodger before, save on that first day\r\nwhen she had been showing him her rooms.\r\n\r\nSide by side they stood, looking out of the window. And, as if aware\r\nthat someone was standing there, Daisy turned her bright face up\r\ntowards the window and smiled at her stepmother, and at the lodger,\r\nwhose face she could only dimly discern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very sweet-looking young girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth thoughtfully. And\r\nthen he quoted a little bit of poetry, and this took Mrs. Bunting very\r\nmuch aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWordsworth,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cA poet too little read nowadays,\r\nMrs. Bunting; but one with a beautiful feeling for nature, for youth,\r\nfor innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting stepped back a little. \xe2\x80\x9cYour breakfast will\r\nbe getting cold, sir, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to the table, obediently, and sat down as a child rebuked\r\nmight have done.\r\n\r\nAnd then his landlady left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything went off quite all right.\r\nAnd Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s a lucky girl\xe2\x80\x94that she is! Her Aunt Margaret gave her five\r\nshillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Daisy did not look as pleased as her father thought she ought to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened to Mr. Chandler,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little\r\ndisconsolately. \xe2\x80\x9cThe very last words he said to me last night was that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be there at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I got quite fidgety as the time went on\r\nand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen here?\xe2\x80\x9d cried her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThen why on earth didn\xe2\x80\x99t he go and\r\nfetch Daisy, if he\xe2\x80\x99d time to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was on the way to his job,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou run along,\r\nchild, downstairs. Now that you are here you can make yourself useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Daisy reluctantly obeyed. She wondered what it was her stepmother\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve something to tell you, Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked across uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been another o\xe2\x80\x99 those murders. But the police don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nanyone to know about it\xe2\x80\x94not yet. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Joe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go over and\r\nfetch Daisy. They\xe2\x80\x99re all on duty again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting put out his hand and clutched hold of the edge of the\r\nmantelpiece. He had gone very red, but his wife was far too much\r\nconcerned with her own feelings and sensations to notice it.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence between them. Then he spoke, making a great\r\neffort to appear unconcerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cClose to the other one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say. But hush!\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Daisy! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk of that horror in front of\r\nher-like. Besides, I promised Chandler I\xe2\x80\x99d be mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be laying the cloth, child, while I go up and clear away the\r\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d Without waiting for an answer, she hurried\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth had left the greater part of the nice lemon sole untouched.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said fretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Mrs. Bunting? I\r\nshould be much obliged if your husband would lend me that paper I saw\r\nin his hand. I do not often care to look at the public prints, but I\r\nshould like to do so now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flew downstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cBunting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little breathlessly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nlodger would like you just to lend him the Sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting handed it over to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve read it through,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell him that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn her way up she glanced down at the pink sheet. Occupying a third of\r\nthe space was an irregular drawing, and under it was written, in rather\r\nlarge characters:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are glad to be able to present our readers with an authentic\r\nreproduction of the footprint of the half-worn rubber sole which was\r\nalmost certainly worn by The Avenger when he committed his double\r\nmurder ten days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe went into the sitting-room. To her relief it was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly put the paper down on the table,\xe2\x80\x9d came Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s muffled\r\nvoice from the upper landing.\r\n\r\nShe did so. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. And Bunting don\xe2\x80\x99t want the paper back again,\r\nsir. He says he\xe2\x80\x99s read it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll afternoon it went on snowing; and the three of them sat there,\r\nlistening and waiting\xe2\x80\x94Bunting and his wife hardly knew for what; Daisy\r\nfor the knock which would herald Joe Chandler.\r\n\r\nAnd about four there came the now familiar sound.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting hurried out into the passage, and as she opened the front\r\ndoor she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t said anything to Daisy yet. Young girls\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t keep secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler nodded comprehendingly. He now looked the low character he had\r\nassumed to the life, for he was blue with cold, disheartened, and tired\r\nout.\r\n\r\nDaisy gave a little cry of shocked surprise, of amusement, of welcome,\r\nwhen she saw how cleverly he was disguised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a difference it do make, to be sure!\r\nWhy, you looks quite horrid, Mr. Chandler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, somehow, that little speech of hers amused her father so much that\r\nhe quite cheered up. Bunting had been very dull and quiet all that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t take me ten minutes to make myself respectable again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe young man rather ruefully.\r\n\r\nHis host and hostess, looking at him eagerly, furtively, both came to\r\nthe conclusion that he had been unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x94that he had failed, that\r\nis, in getting any information worth having. And though, in a sense,\r\nthey all had a pleasant tea together, there was an air of constraint,\r\neven of discomfort, over the little party.\r\n\r\nBunting felt it hard that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask the questions that were\r\ntrembling on his lips; he would have felt it hard any time during the\r\nlast month to refrain from knowing anything Joe could tell him, but now\r\nit seemed almost intolerable to be in this queer kind of half suspense.\r\nThere was one important fact he longed to know, and at last came his\r\nopportunity of doing so, for Joe Chandler rose to leave, and this time\r\nit was Bunting who followed him out into the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cJust tell me that, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimrose Hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know all about it in a\r\nminute or two, for it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all in the last editions of the evening\r\npapers. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo arrest I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler shook his head despondently. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to\r\nthink the Yard was on a wrong tack altogether this time. But one can\r\nonly do one\xe2\x80\x99s best. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Mrs. Bunting told you I\xe2\x80\x99d got to\r\nquestion a barmaid about a man who was in her place just before\r\nclosing-time. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s said all she knew, and it\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as\r\ndaylight to me that the eccentric old gent she talks about was only a\r\nharmless luny. He gave her a sovereign just because she told him she\r\nwas a teetotaller!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed ruefully.\r\n\r\nEven Bunting was diverted at the notion. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s a queer thing\r\nfor a barmaid to be!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s niece to the people what\r\nkeeps the public,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Chandler; and then he went out of the\r\nfront door with a cheerful \xe2\x80\x9cSo long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Bunting went back into the sitting-room Daisy had disappeared. She\r\nhad gone downstairs with the tray. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my girl?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just taken the tray downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out to the top of the kitchen stairs, and called out sharply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy! Daisy, child! Are you down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d came her eager, happy voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter come up out of that cold kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and came back to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cEllen, is the lodger in? I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him moving about. Now mind what I says, please! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant Daisy to be mixed up with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very well to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bunting\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t likely I should let Daisy have anything to do with\r\nhim. Why, she\xe2\x80\x99s never even seen him. \xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t likely I should allow her\r\nto begin waiting on him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut though she was surprised and a little irritated by the tone in\r\nwhich Bunting had spoken, no glimmer of the truth illumined her mind.\r\nSo accustomed had she become to bearing alone the burden of her awful\r\nsecret, that it would have required far more than a cross word or two,\r\nfar more than the fact that Bunting looked ill and tired, for her to\r\nhave come to suspect that her secret was now shared by another, and\r\nthat other her husband.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the poor soul had agonised and trembled at the thought\r\nof her house being invaded by the police, but that was only because she\r\nhad always credited the police with supernatural powers of detection.\r\nThat they should come to know the awful fact she kept hidden in her\r\nbreast would have seemed to her, on the whole, a natural thing, but\r\nthat Bunting should even dimly suspect it appeared beyond the range of\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even Daisy noticed a change in her father. He sat cowering over\r\nthe fire\xe2\x80\x94saying nothing, doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, father, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you well?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked more than once.\r\n\r\nAnd, looking up, he would answer, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m well enough, my girl, but I\r\nfeels cold. It\xe2\x80\x99s awful cold. I never did feel anything like the cold\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt eight the now familiar shouts and cries began again outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenger again!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnother horrible crime!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cExtra speshul\r\nedition!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such were the shouts, the exultant yells, hurled through the\r\nclear, cold air. They fell, like bombs into the quiet room.\r\n\r\nBoth Bunting and his wife remained silent, but Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks grew pink\r\nwith excitement, and her eye sparkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark, father! Hark, Ellen! D\xe2\x80\x99you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed childishly,\r\nand even clapped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI do wish Mr. Chandler had been here. He\r\n_would_ \xe2\x80\x99a been startled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Daisy!\xe2\x80\x9d and Bunting frowned.\r\n\r\nThen, getting up, he stretched himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fair getting on my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese horrible things happening. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get right away\r\nfrom London, just as far as I could\xe2\x80\x94that I would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp to John-o\xe2\x80\x99-Groat\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, laughing. And then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, father,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t you going out to get a paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly he went out of the room, and, lingering a moment in the hall, he\r\nput on his greatcoat and hat. Then he opened the front door, and walked\r\ndown the flagged path. Opening the iron gate, he stepped out on the\r\npavement, then crossed the road to where the newspaper-boys now stood.\r\n\r\nThe boy nearest to him only had the _Sun_\xe2\x80\x94a late edition of the paper\r\nhe had already read. It annoyed Bunting to give a penny for a ha\xe2\x80\x99penny\r\nrag of which he already knew the main contents. But there was nothing\r\nelse to do.\r\n\r\nStanding under a lamp-post, he opened out the newspaper. It was\r\nbitingly cold; that, perhaps, was why his hand shook as he looked down\r\nat the big headlines. For Bunting had been very unfair to the\r\nenterprise of the editor of his favourite evening paper. This special\r\nedition was full of new matter\xe2\x80\x94new matter concerning The Avenger.\r\n\r\nFirst, in huge type right across the page, was the brief statement that\r\nThe Avenger had now committed his ninth crime, and that he had chosen\r\nquite a new locality, namely, the lonely stretch of rising ground known\r\nto Londoners as Primrose Hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police,\xe2\x80\x9d so Bunting read, \xe2\x80\x9care very reserved as to the\r\ncircumstances which led to the finding of the body of The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlatest victim. But we have reason to believe that they possess several\r\nreally important clues, and that one of them is concerned with the\r\nhalf-worn rubber sole of which we are the first to reproduce an outline\r\nto-day. (See over page.)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting, turning the sheet round about, saw the irregular outline\r\nhe had already seen in the early edition of the Sun, that purporting to\r\nbe a facsimile of the imprint left by The Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s rubber sole.\r\n\r\nHe stared down at the rough outline which took up so much of the space\r\nwhich should have been devoted to reading matter with a queer, sinking\r\nfeeling of terrified alarm. Again and again criminals had been tracked\r\nby the marks their boots or shoes had made at or near the scenes of\r\ntheir misdoings.\r\n\r\nPractically the only job Bunting did in his own house of a menial kind\r\nwas the cleaning of the boots and shoes. He had already visualised\r\nearly this very afternoon the little row with which he dealt each\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94first came his wife\xe2\x80\x99s strong, serviceable boots, then his own\r\ntwo pairs, a good deal patched and mended, and next to his own Mr.\r\nSleuth\xe2\x80\x99s strong, hardly worn, and expensive buttoned boots. Of late a\r\ndear little coquettish high-heeled pair of outdoor shoes with thin,\r\npaperlike soles, bought by Daisy for her trip to London, had ended the\r\nrow. The girl had worn these thin shoes persistently, in defiance of\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s reproof and advice, and he, Bunting, had only once had to clean\r\nher more sensible country pair, and that only because the others had\r\nbecome wet through the day he and she had accompanied young Chandler to\r\nScotland Yard.\r\n\r\nSlowly he returned across the road. Somehow the thought of going in\r\nagain, of hearing his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sarcastic comments, of parrying Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neager questions, had become intolerable. So he walked slowly, trying to\r\nput off the evil moment when he would have to tell them what was in his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe lamp under which he had stood reading was not exactly opposite the\r\nhouse. It was rather to the right of it. And when, having crossed over\r\nthe roadway, he walked along the pavement towards his own gate, he\r\nheard odd, shuffling sounds coming from the inner side of the low wall\r\nwhich shut off his little courtyard from the pavement.\r\n\r\nNow, under ordinary circumstances Bunting would have rushed forward to\r\ndrive out whoever was there. He and his wife had often had trouble,\r\nbefore the cold weather began, with vagrants seeking shelter there. But\r\nto-night he stayed outside, listening intently, sick with suspense and\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that their place was being watched\xe2\x80\x94already? He thought\r\nit only too likely. Bunting, like Mrs. Bunting, credited the police\r\nwith almost supernatural powers, especially since he had paid that\r\nvisit to Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nBut to Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s amazement, and, yes, relief, it was his lodger who\r\nsuddenly loomed up in the dim light.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth must have been stooping down, for his tall, lank form had\r\nbeen quite concealed till he stepped forward from behind the low wall\r\non to the flagged path leading to the front door.\r\n\r\nThe lodger was carrying a brown paper parcel, and, as he walked along,\r\nthe new boots he was wearing creaked, and the tap-tap of hard\r\nnail-studded heels rang out on the flat-stones of the narrow path.\r\n\r\nBunting, still standing outside the gate, suddenly knew what it was his\r\nlodger had been doing on the other side of the low wall. Mr. Sleuth had\r\nevidently been out to buy himself another pair of new boots, and then\r\nhe had gone inside the gate and had put them on, placing his old\r\nfootgear in the paper in which the new pair had been wrapped.\r\n\r\nThe ex-butler waited\xe2\x80\x94waited quite a long time, not only until Mr.\r\nSleuth had let himself into the house, but till the lodger had had time\r\nto get well away, upstairs.\r\n\r\nThen he also walked up the flagged pathway, and put his latchkey in the\r\ndoor. He lingered as long over the job of hanging his hat and coat up\r\nin the hall as he dared, in fact till his wife called out to him. Then\r\nhe went in, and throwing the paper down on the table, he said sullenly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is! You can see it all for yourself\xe2\x80\x94not that there\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nmuch to see,\xe2\x80\x9d and groped his way to the fire.\r\n\r\nHis wife looked at him in sharp alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever have you done to\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ill\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, Bunting. You\r\ngot a chill last night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I\xe2\x80\x99d got a chill,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t last night,\r\nthough; \xe2\x80\x99twas going out this morning, coming back in the bus. Margaret\r\nkeeps that housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room o\xe2\x80\x99 hers like a hothouse\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\r\ndoes. \xe2\x80\x99Twas going out from there into the biting wind, that\xe2\x80\x99s what did\r\nfor me. It must be awful to stand about in such weather; \xe2\x80\x99tis a wonder\r\nto me how that young fellow, Joe Chandler, can stand the life\xe2\x80\x94being out\r\nin all weathers like he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting spoke at random, his one anxiety being to get away from what\r\nwas in the paper, which now lay, neglected, on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose that keep out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors all day never do come to no harm,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhis wife testily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you felt so bad, whatever was you out so long\r\nfor, Bunting? I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d gone away somewhere! D\xe2\x80\x99you mean you only\r\nwent to get the paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just stopped for a second to look at it under the lamp,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a silly thing to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted meekly.\r\n\r\nDaisy had taken up the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they don\xe2\x80\x99t say much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\ndisappointedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHardly anything at all! But perhaps Mr. Chandler \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe in soon again. If so, he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young girl like you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to want to know anything about\r\nmurders,\xe2\x80\x9d said her stepmother severely. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe won\xe2\x80\x99t think any the better\r\nof you for your inquisitiveness about such things. If I was you, Daisy,\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing about it if he does come in\xe2\x80\x94which I fair tell\r\nyou I hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough of that young chap to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in for long\xe2\x80\x94not to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, her lip trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you one thing that\xe2\x80\x99ll surprise you, my dear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bunting\r\nlooked significantly at her stepdaughter. She also wanted to get away\r\nfrom that dread news\xe2\x80\x94which yet was no news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, rather defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised to hear that Joe did come in this morning.\r\nHe knew all about that affair then, but he particular asked that you\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be told anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, much mortified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d went on her stepmother ruthlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just ask your father\r\nover there if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t a healthy thing to speak overmuch about such happenings,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBunting heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Mrs. Bunting, quickly pursuing her advantage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about such horrid things when I comes in to\r\nhave a quiet chat with friends. But the minute he comes in that poor\r\nyoung chap is set upon\xe2\x80\x94mostly, I admit, by your father,\xe2\x80\x9d she looked at\r\nher husband severely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you does your share, too, Daisy! You asks\r\nhim this, you asks him that\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s fair puzzled sometimes. It don\xe2\x80\x99t do to\r\nbe so inquisitive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps because of this little sermon on Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s part when\r\nyoung Chandler did come in again that evening, very little was said of\r\nthe new Avenger murder.\r\n\r\nBunting made no reference to it at all, and though Daisy said a word,\r\nit was but a word. And Joe Chandler thought he had never spent a\r\npleasanter evening in his life\xe2\x80\x94for it was he and Daisy who talked all\r\nthe time, their elders remaining for the most part silent.\r\n\r\nDaisy told of all that she had done with Aunt Margaret. She described\r\nthe long, dull hours and the queer jobs her aunt set her to do\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwashing up of all the fine drawing-room china in a big basin lined with\r\nflannel, and how terrified she (Daisy) had been lest there should come\r\neven one teeny little chip to any of it. Then she went on to relate\r\nsome of the funny things Aunt Margaret had told her about \xe2\x80\x9cthe family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere came a really comic tale, which hugely interested and delighted\r\nChandler. This was of how Aunt Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s lady had been taken in by an\r\nimpostor\xe2\x80\x94an impostor who had come up, just as she was stepping out of\r\nher carriage, and pretended to have a fit on the doorstep. Aunt\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x99s lady, being a soft one, had insisted on the man coming into\r\nthe hall, where he had been given all kinds of restoratives. When the\r\nman had at last gone off, it was found that he had \xe2\x80\x9cwolfed\xe2\x80\x9d young\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s best walking-stick, one with a fine tortoise-shell top to it.\r\nThus had Aunt Margaret proved to her lady that the man had been\r\nshamming, and her lady had been very angry\xe2\x80\x94near had a fit herself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of that about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIncorrigible\r\nrogues and vagabonds\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what those sort of people are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he, in his turn, told an elaborate tale of an exceptionally\r\nclever swindler whom he himself had brought to book. He was very proud\r\nof that job, it had formed a white stone in his career as a detective.\r\nAnd even Mrs. Bunting was quite interested to hear about it.\r\n\r\nChandler was still sitting there when Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang. For\r\nawhile no one stirred; then Bunting looked questioningly at his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, Ellen, that was the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up, without alacrity, and went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rang,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth weakly, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t require any\r\nsupper to-night, Mrs. Bunting. Only a glass of milk, with a lump of\r\nsugar in it. That is all I require\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. I feel very very far\r\nfrom well\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he had a hunted, plaintive expression on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthen I thought your husband would like his paper back again, Mrs.\r\nBunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting, looking at him fixedly, with a sad intensity of gaze of\r\nwhich she was quite unconscious, answered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir! Bunting don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrequire that paper now. He read it all through.\xe2\x80\x9d Something impelled her\r\nto add, ruthlessly, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got another paper by now, sir. You may have\r\nheard them come shouting outside. Would you like me to bring you up\r\nthat other paper, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sleuth shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said querulously. \xe2\x80\x9cI much\r\nregret now having asked for the one paper I did read, for it disturbed\r\nme, Mrs. Bunting. There was nothing of any value in it\xe2\x80\x94there never is\r\nin any public print. I gave up reading newspapers years ago, and I much\r\nregret that I broke through my rule to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if to indicate to her that he did not wish for any more\r\nconversation, the lodger then did what he had never done before in his\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He went over to the fireplace and deliberately\r\nturned his back on her.\r\n\r\nShe went down and brought up the glass of milk and the lump of sugar he\r\nhad asked for.\r\n\r\nNow he was in his usual place, sitting at the table, studying the Book.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Bunting went back to the others they were chatting merrily.\r\nShe did not notice that the merriment was confined to the two young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy pertly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about the lodger, Ellen? Is he all\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must feel pretty dull sitting up there all by himself\xe2\x80\x94awful\r\nlonely-like, I call it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\nBut her stepmother remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever does he do with himself all day?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now he\xe2\x80\x99s reading the Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting answered, shortly and\r\ndryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never! That\xe2\x80\x99s a funny thing for a gentleman to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Joe, alone of her three listeners, laughed\xe2\x80\x94a long hearty peal of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to laugh at,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nfeel ashamed of being caught laughing at anything connected with the\r\nBible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd poor Joe became suddenly quite serious. This was the first time\r\nthat Mrs. Bunting had ever spoken really nastily to him, and he\r\nanswered very humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon. I know I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have laughed\r\nat anything to do with the Bible, but you see, Miss Daisy said it so\r\nfunny-like, and, by all accounts, your lodger must be a queer card,\r\nMrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s no queerer than many people I could mention,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly;\r\nand with these enigmatic words she got up, and left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach hour of the days that followed held for Bunting its full meed of\r\naching fear and suspense.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy man was ever debating within himself what course he should\r\npursue, and, according to his mood and to the state of his mind at any\r\nparticular moment, he would waver between various widely-differing\r\nlines of action.\r\n\r\nHe told himself again and again, and with fretful unease, that the most\r\nawful thing about it all was that _he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure_. If only he could\r\nhave been _sure_, he might have made up his mind exactly what it was he\r\nought to do.\r\n\r\nBut when telling himself this he was deceiving himself, and he was\r\nvaguely conscious of the fact; for, from Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s point of view,\r\nalmost any alternative would have been preferable to that which to\r\nsome, nay, perhaps to most, householders would have seemed the only\r\nthing to do, namely, to go to the police. But Londoners of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclass have an uneasy fear of the law. To his mind it would be ruin for\r\nhim and for his Ellen to be mixed up publicly in such a terrible\r\naffair. No one concerned in the business would give them and their\r\nfuture a thought, but it would track them to their dying day, and,\r\nabove all, it would make it quite impossible for them ever to get again\r\ninto a good joint situation. It was that for which Bunting, in his\r\nsecret soul, now longed with all his heart.\r\n\r\nNo, some other way than going to the police must be found\xe2\x80\x94and he racked\r\nhis slow brain to find it.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that every hour that went by made his future course\r\nmore difficult and more delicate, and increased the awful weight on his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nIf only he really knew! If only he could feel quite sure! And then he\r\nwould tell himself that, after all, he had very little to go upon; only\r\nsuspicion\xe2\x80\x94suspicion, and a secret, horrible certainty that his\r\nsuspicion was justified.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last Bunting began to long for a solution which he knew to be\r\nindefensible from every point of view; he began to hope, that is, in\r\nthe depths of his heart, that the lodger would again go out one evening\r\non his horrible business and be caught\xe2\x80\x94red-handed.\r\n\r\nBut far from going out on any business, horrible or other, Mr. Sleuth\r\nnow never went out at all. He kept upstairs, and often spent quite a\r\nconsiderable part of his day in bed. He still felt, so he assured Mrs.\r\nBunting, very far from well. He had never thrown off the chill he had\r\ncaught on that bitter night he and his landlord had met on their\r\nseveral ways home.\r\n\r\nJoe Chandler, too, had become a terrible complication to Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather. The detective spent every waking hour that he was not on duty\r\nwith the Buntings; and Bunting, who at one time had liked him so well\r\nand so cordially, now became mortally afraid of him.\r\n\r\nBut though the young man talked of little else than The Avenger, and\r\nthough on one evening he described at immense length the\r\neccentric-looking gent who had given the barmaid a sovereign, picturing\r\nMr. Sleuth with such awful accuracy that both Bunting and Mrs. Bunting\r\nsecretly and separately turned sick when they listened to him, he never\r\nshowed the slightest interest in their lodger.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a morning when Bunting and Chandler held a strange\r\nconversation about The Avenger. The young fellow had come in earlier\r\nthan usual, and just as he arrived Mrs. Bunting and Daisy were starting\r\nout to do some shopping. The girl would fain have stopped behind, but\r\nher stepmother had given her a very peculiar, disagreeable look, daring\r\nher, so to speak, to be so forward, and Daisy had gone on with a\r\nflushed, angry look on her pretty face.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as young Chandler stepped through into the sitting-room, it\r\nsuddenly struck Bunting that the young man looked unlike\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94indeed, to the ex-butler\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension there was something\r\nalmost threatening in Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a word with you, Mr. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d he began abruptly, falteringly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to have the chance now that Mrs. Bunting and Miss Daisy\r\nare out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting braced himself to hear the awful words\xe2\x80\x94the accusation of having\r\nsheltered a murderer, the monster whom all the world was seeking, under\r\nhis roof. And then he remembered a phrase, a horrible legal\r\nphrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAccessory after the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, he had been that, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany doubt about it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d and then the unfortunate man sat\r\ndown in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d he said again uncertainly; for young Chandler\r\nhad now advanced to the table, he was looking at Bunting fixedly\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nother thought threateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, out with it, Joe! Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me in\r\nsuspense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then a slight smile broke over the young man\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say can take you by surprise, Mr. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting wagged his head in a way that might mean anything\xe2\x80\x94yes or\r\nno, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another for what seemed a very, very long\r\ntime to the elder of them. And then, making a great effort, Joe\r\nChandler brought out the words, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose you know what it is I\r\nwant to talk about. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Bunting would, from a look or two\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s lately cast on me. It\xe2\x80\x99s your daughter\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Bunting gave a kind of cry, \xe2\x80\x99twixt a sob and a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ngirl?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, Joe! Is that all you wants to talk about?\r\nWhy, you fair frightened me\xe2\x80\x94that you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the relief was so great that the room swam round as he\r\nstared across it at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s lover, that lover who was also the\r\nembodiment of that now awful thing to him, the law. He smiled, rather\r\nfoolishly, at his visitor; and Chandler felt a sharp wave of\r\nirritation, of impatience sweep over his good-natured soul. Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather was an old stupid\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was.\r\n\r\nAnd then Bunting grew serious. The room ceased to go round. \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a good deal of solemnity, even a little\r\ndignity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have my blessing, Joe. You\xe2\x80\x99re a very likely young chap,\r\nand I had a true respect for your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, Mr. Bunting. But how\r\nabout her\xe2\x80\x94her herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting stared at him. It pleased him to think that Daisy hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given\r\nherself away, as Ellen was always hinting the girl was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask her\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not a job any other man can do for you, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never gets a chance. I never sees her, not by our two selves,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChandler, with some heat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand, Mr. Bunting,\r\nthat I never do see Miss Daisy alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear now that\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s going away Monday, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only once had the chance of a walk\r\nwith her. Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s very particular, not to say pernickety in her\r\nideas, Mr. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fault on the right side, that is\xe2\x80\x94with a young girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBunting thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nAnd Chandler nodded. He quite agreed that as regarded other young chaps\r\nMrs. Bunting could not be too particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been brought up like a lady, my Daisy has,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Bunting,\r\nwith some pride. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Old Aunt of hers hardly lets her out of her\r\nsight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to the old aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bunting\r\nshe talks as if your daughter was going to stay with that old woman the\r\nwhole of her natural life\xe2\x80\x94now is that right? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I wants to ask\r\nyou, Mr. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x94is that right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say a word to Ellen, don\xe2\x80\x99t you fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting abstractedly.\r\n\r\nHis mind had wandered off, away from Daisy and this nice young chap, to\r\nhis now constant anxious preoccupation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come along to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you gets your walk with Daisy. It\xe2\x80\x99s only right you\r\nand she should have a chance of seeing one another without old folk\r\nbeing by; else how\xe2\x80\x99s the girl to tell whether she likes you or not! For\r\nthe matter of that, you hardly knows her, Joe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the young\r\nman consideringly.\r\n\r\nChandler shook his head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI knows her quite as well as I\r\nwants to know her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI made up my mind the very first time I\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x99d her, Mr. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Did you really?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, come to think of it, I did\r\nso with her mother; aye, and years after, with Ellen, too. But I hope\r\n_you\xe2\x80\x99ll_ never want no second, Chandler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man under his breath. And then he asked,\r\nrather longingly, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be out long now, Mr. Bunting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting woke up to a due sense of hospitality. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down, sit down;\r\ndo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they\xe2\x80\x99ll be very long. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nonly got a little bit of shopping to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, in a changed, in a ringing, nervous tone, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\r\nabout your job, Joe? Nothing new, I take it? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re all just\r\nwaiting for _the next time?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s about the figure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s voice had also changed;\r\nit was now sombre, menacing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re fair tired of it\xe2\x80\x94beginning to\r\nwonder when it\xe2\x80\x99ll end, that we are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever try and make to yourself a picture of what the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bunting. Somehow, he felt he must ask that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a sort of notion\xe2\x80\x94a savage, fierce-looking\r\ndevil, the chap must be. It\xe2\x80\x99s that description that was circulated put\r\nus wrong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was the man that knocked up against that\r\nwoman in the fog\xe2\x80\x94no, not one bit I don\xe2\x80\x99t. But I wavers, I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nmake up my mind. Sometimes I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sailor\xe2\x80\x94the foreigner they\r\ntalks about, that goes away for eight or nine days in between, to\r\nHolland maybe, or to France. Then, again, I says to myself that it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbutcher, a man from the Central Market. Whoever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s someone\r\nused to killing, that\xe2\x80\x99s flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to you possible\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d (Bunting got up and walked over\r\nto the window.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t take any stock, I suppose, in that idea some\r\nof the papers put out, that the man is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then he hesitated and brought\r\nout, with a gasp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler looked at him, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade up my mind that\xe2\x80\x99s quite a wrong tack, though I knows that some of\r\nour fellows\xe2\x80\x94big pots, too\xe2\x80\x94are quite sure that the fellow what gave the\r\ngirl the sovereign is the man we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for. You see, Mr. Bunting,\r\nif that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact\xe2\x80\x94well, it stands to reason the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s an escaped\r\nlunatic; and if he\xe2\x80\x99s an escaped lunatic he\xe2\x80\x99s got a keeper, and they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe raising a hue and cry after him; now, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Bunting, lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he could\r\nbe just staying somewhere, lodging like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean that The Avenger may be a toff, staying in some West-end\r\nhotel, Mr. Bunting? Well, things almost as funny as that \xe2\x80\x99ud be have\r\ncome to pass.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled as if the notion was a funny one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, something o\xe2\x80\x99 that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if your idea\xe2\x80\x99s correct, Mr. Bunting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said \xe2\x80\x99twas my idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting, all in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that idea\xe2\x80\x99s correct then, \xe2\x80\x99twill make our task more difficult\r\nthan ever. Why, \xe2\x80\x99twould be looking for a needle in a field of hay, Mr.\r\nBunting! But there! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s anything quite so unlikely as\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94not myself I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some of us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he lowered\r\nhis voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat hopes he\xe2\x80\x99ll betake himself off\xe2\x80\x94The Avenger, I mean\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nanother big city, to Manchester or to Edinburgh. There\xe2\x80\x99d be plenty of\r\nwork for him to do there,\xe2\x80\x9d and Chandler chuckled at his own grim joke.\r\n\r\nAnd then, to both men\xe2\x80\x99s secret relief, for Bunting was now mortally\r\nafraid of this discussion concerning The Avenger and his doings, they\r\nheard Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s key in the lock.\r\n\r\nDaisy blushed rosy-red with pleasure when she saw that young Chandler\r\nwas still there. She had feared that when they got home he would be\r\ngone, the more so that Ellen, just as if she was doing it on purpose,\r\nhad lingered aggravatingly long over each small purchase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Joe come to ask if he can take Daisy out for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d blurted\r\nout Bunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother says as how she\xe2\x80\x99d like you to come to tea, over at\r\nRichmond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler awkwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cI just come in to see whether we\r\ncould fix it up, Miss Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d And Daisy looked imploringly at her\r\nstepmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean now\xe2\x80\x94this minute?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bunting tartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, o\xe2\x80\x99 course not\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Bunting broke in hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you do go on,\r\nEllen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat day did your mother mention would be convenient to her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMrs. Bunting, looking at the young man satirically.\r\n\r\nChandler hesitated. His mother had not mentioned any special day\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, his mother had shown a surprising lack of anxiety to see Daisy at\r\nall. But he had talked her round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about Saturday?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Bunting. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twould be a birthday treat for her to go to Richmond, and she\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nback to Old Aunt on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler disconsolately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on duty\r\nSaturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let it be Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting firmly. And his wife\r\nlooked at him surprised; he seldom asserted himself so much in her\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, Miss Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunday would be very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy demurely. And then, as the\r\nyoung man took up his hat, and as her stepmother did not stir, Daisy\r\nventured to go out into the hall with him for a minute.\r\n\r\nChandler shut the door behind them, and so was spared the hearing of\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s whispered remark: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a young woman folk didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngallivant about on Sunday; those who was courting used to go to church\r\ntogether, decent-like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaisy\xe2\x80\x99s eighteenth birthday dawned uneventfully. Her father gave her\r\nwhat he had always promised she should have on her eighteenth\r\nbirthday\xe2\x80\x94a watch. It was a pretty little silver watch, which Bunting\r\nhad bought secondhand on the last day he had been happy\xe2\x80\x94it seemed a\r\nlong, long time ago now.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting thought a silver watch a very extravagant present but she\r\nwas far too wretched, far too absorbed in her own thoughts, to trouble\r\nmuch about it. Besides, in such matters she had generally had the good\r\nsense not to interfere between her husband and his child.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the birthday morning Bunting went out to buy himself\r\nsome more tobacco. He had never smoked so much as in the last four\r\ndays, excepting, perhaps, the week that had followed on his leaving\r\nservice. Smoking a pipe had then held all the exquisite pleasure which\r\nwe are told attaches itself to the eating of forbidden fruit.\r\n\r\nHis tobacco had now become his only relaxation; it acted on his nerves\r\nas an opiate, soothing his fears and helping him to think. But he had\r\nbeen overdoing it, and it was that which now made him feel so \xe2\x80\x9cjumpy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nso he assured himself, when he found himself starting at any casual\r\nsound outside, or even when his wife spoke to him suddenly.\r\n\r\nJust now Ellen and Daisy were down in the kitchen, and Bunting didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite like the sensation of knowing that there was only one pair of\r\nstairs between Mr. Sleuth and himself. So he quietly slipped out of the\r\nhouse without telling Ellen that he was going out.\r\n\r\nIn the last four days Bunting had avoided his usual haunts; above all,\r\nhe had avoided even passing the time of day to his acquaintances and\r\nneighbours. He feared, with a great fear, that they would talk to him\r\nof a subject which, because it filled his mind to the exclusion of all\r\nelse, might make him betray the knowledge\xe2\x80\x94no, not knowledge, rather\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94the suspicion\xe2\x80\x94that dwelt within him.\r\n\r\nBut to-day the unfortunate man had a curious, instinctive longing for\r\nhuman companionship\xe2\x80\x94companionship, that is, other than that of his wife\r\nand of his daughter.\r\n\r\nThis longing for a change of company finally led him into a small,\r\npopulous thoroughfare hard by the Edgware Road. There were more people\r\nthere than usual just now, for the housewives of the neighbourhood were\r\ndoing their Saturday marketing for Sunday. The ex-butler turned into a\r\nsmall old-fashioned shop where he generally bought his tobacco.\r\n\r\nBunting passed the time of day with the tobacconist, and the two fell\r\ninto desultory talk, but to his customer\xe2\x80\x99s relief and surprise the man\r\nmade no allusion to the subject of which all the neighbourhood must\r\nstill be talking.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite suddenly, while still standing by the counter, and\r\nbefore he had paid for the packet of tobacco he held in his hand,\r\nBunting, through the open door, saw with horrified surprise that Ellen,\r\nhis wife, was standing, alone, outside a greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop just\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nMuttering a word of apology, he rushed out of the shop and across the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped hoarsely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never gone and left my little girl\r\nalone in the house with the lodger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s face went yellow with fear. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was indoors,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _was_ indoors! Whatever made you come out for, without\r\nfirst making sure I\xe2\x80\x99d stay in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting made no answer; but, as they stared at each other in\r\nexasperated silence, each now knew that the other knew.\r\n\r\nThey turned and scurried down the crowded street. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nsuddenly; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall get there just as quickly if we walk fast. People\r\nare noticing you, Ellen. Don\xe2\x80\x99t run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke breathlessly, but it was breathlessness induced by fear and by\r\nexcitement, not by the quick pace at which they were walking.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached their own gate, and Bunting pushed past in front\r\nof his wife.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Daisy was his child; Ellen couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he was feeling.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to take the path in one leap, then fumbled for a moment with\r\nhis latchkey.\r\n\r\nOpening wide the door, \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, in a wailing voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy, my dear! where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, father. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d Bunting turned a grey face to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright, Ellen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment, leaning against the wall of the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did\r\ngive me a turn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then, warningly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t frighten the\r\ngirl, Ellen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy was standing before the fire in their sitting room, admiring\r\nherself in the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, without turning round, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the\r\nlodger! He\xe2\x80\x99s quite a nice gentleman, though, to be sure, he does look a\r\ncure. He rang his bell, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to go up; and so he came down\r\nto ask Ellen for something. We had quite a nice little chat\xe2\x80\x94that we\r\nhad. I told him it was my birthday, and he asked me and Ellen to go to\r\nMadame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s with him this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed, a little\r\nself-consciously. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I could see he was \xe2\x80\x99centric, and then at\r\nfirst he spoke so funnily. \xe2\x80\x98And who be you?\xe2\x80\x99 he says, threatening-like.\r\nAnd I says to him, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nvery fortunate girl\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he says, Ellen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98to \xe2\x80\x99ave such a nice\r\nstepmother as you\xe2\x80\x99ve got. That\xe2\x80\x99s why,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98you look such a good,\r\ninnocent girl.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he quoted a bit of the Prayer Book. \xe2\x80\x98Keep\r\ninnocency,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, wagging his head at me. Lor\xe2\x80\x99! It made me feel as\r\nif I was with Old Aunt again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have you going out with the lodger\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBunting spoke in a muffled, angry tone. He was wiping his forehead with\r\none hand, while with the other he mechanically squeezed the little\r\npacket of tobacco, for which, as he now remembered, he had forgotten to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nDaisy pouted. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, I think you might let me have a treat on my\r\nbirthday! I told him that Saturday wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good day\xe2\x80\x94at least, so\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d heard\xe2\x80\x94for Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s. Then he said we could go early, while\r\nthe fine folk are still having their dinners.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to her\r\nstepmother, then giggled happily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe particularly said you was to\r\ncome, too. The lodger has a wonderful fancy for you, Ellen; if I was\r\nfather, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel quite jealous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer last words were cut across by a tap-tap on the door.\r\n\r\nBunting and his wife looked at each other apprehensively. Was it\r\npossible that, in their agitation, they had left the front door open,\r\nand that _someone_, some merciless myrmidon of the law, had crept in\r\nbehind them?\r\n\r\nBoth felt a curious thrill of satisfaction when they saw that it was\r\nonly Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Sleuth dressed for going out; the tall hat he had\r\nworn when he had first come to them was in his hand, but he was wearing\r\na coat instead of his Inverness cape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you come in\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he addressed Mrs. Bunting in his high, whistling,\r\nhesitating voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand so I\xe2\x80\x99ve come down to ask you if you and Miss\r\nBunting will come to Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s now. I have never seen those\r\nfamous waxworks, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of the place all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Bunting forced himself to look fixedly at his lodger, a sudden doubt\r\nbringing with it a sense of immeasurable relief, came to Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\nSurely it was inconceivable that this gentle, mild-mannered gentleman\r\ncould be the monster of cruelty and cunning that Bunting had now for\r\nthe terrible space of four days believed him to be!\r\n\r\nHe tried to catch his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eye, but Mrs. Bunting was looking away,\r\nstaring into vacancy. She still, of course, wore the bonnet and cloak\r\nin which she had just been out to do her marketing. Daisy was already\r\nputting on her hat and coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth. Then Mrs. Bunting turned, and it seemed to his\r\nlandlady that he was looking at her threateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. We\xe2\x80\x99ll come in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said dully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s had hitherto held pleasant memories for Mrs. Bunting.\r\nIn the days when she and Bunting were courting they often spent there\r\npart of their afternoon-out.\r\n\r\nThe butler had an acquaintance, a man named Hopkins, who was one of the\r\nwaxworks staff, and this man had sometimes given him passes for \xe2\x80\x9cself\r\nand lady.\xe2\x80\x9d But this was the first time Mrs. Bunting had been inside the\r\nplace since she had come to live almost next door, as it were, to the\r\nbig building.\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence to the familiar entrance, and then, after the\r\nill-assorted trio had gone up the great staircase and into the first\r\ngallery, Mr. Sleuth suddenly stopped short. The presence of those\r\ncurious, still, waxen figures which suggest so strangely death in life,\r\nseemed to surprise and affright him.\r\n\r\nDaisy took quick advantage of the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation and unease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdo let us begin by going into the Chamber of\r\nHorrors! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in there. Old Aunt made father promise he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take me the only time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been here. But now that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\neighteen I can do just as I like; besides, Old Aunt will never know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth looked down at her, and a smile passed for a moment over his\r\nworn, gaunt face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go into the Chamber of Horrors; that\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nidea, Miss Bunting. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to see the Chamber of Horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned into the great room in which the Napoleonic relics were\r\nthen kept, and which led into the curious, vault-like chamber where\r\nwaxen effigies of dead criminals stand grouped in wooden docks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting was at once disturbed and relieved to see her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold acquaintance, Mr. Hopkins, in charge of the turnstile admitting the\r\npublic to the Chamber of Horrors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _are_ a stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d the man observed genially. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe\r\nthat this is the very first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you in here, Mrs. Bunting,\r\nsince you was married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is so. And this is my husband\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Daisy;\r\nI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of her, Mr. Hopkins. And this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she hesitated a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis our lodger, Mr. Sleuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sleuth frowned and shuffled away. Daisy, leaving her\r\nstepmother\xe2\x80\x99s side, joined him.\r\n\r\nTwo, as all the world knows, is company, three is none. Mrs. Bunting\r\nput down three sixpences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hopkins; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t go into the Chamber of\r\nHorrors just yet. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait more than four or five\r\nminutes, Mrs. Bunting. It\xe2\x80\x99s this way, you see; our boss is in there,\r\nshowing a party round.\xe2\x80\x9d He lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Sir John Burney\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsuppose you know who Sir John Burney is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered indifferently, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ever heard of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt slightly\xe2\x80\x94oh, very sightly\xe2\x80\x94uneasy about Daisy. She would have\r\nliked her stepdaughter to keep well within sight and sound, but Mr.\r\nSleuth was now taking the girl down to the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you never _will_ know him\xe2\x80\x94not in any personal sense, Mrs.\r\nBunting.\xe2\x80\x9d The man chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the Commissioner of Police\xe2\x80\x94the new\r\none\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what Sir John Burney is. One of the gentlemen he\xe2\x80\x99s showing\r\nround our place is the Paris Police boss\xe2\x80\x94whose job is on all fours, so\r\nto speak, with Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s. The Frenchy has brought his daughter with\r\nhim, and there are several other ladies. Ladies always likes horrors,\r\nMrs. Bunting; that\xe2\x80\x99s our experience here. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, take me to the Chamber\r\nof Horrors\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they say the minute they gets into this here\r\nbuilding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked at him thoughtfully. It occurred to Mr. Hopkins\r\nthat she was very wan and tired; she used to look better in the old\r\ndays, when she was still in service, before Bunting married her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what my stepdaughter said just now. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\ntake me to the Chamber of Horrors\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what she did say when\r\nwe got upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA group of people, all talking and laughing together; were advancing,\r\nfrom within the wooden barrier, toward the turnstile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting stared at them nervously. She wondered which of them was\r\nthe gentleman with whom Mr. Hopkins had hoped she would never be\r\nbrought into personal contact; she thought she could pick him out among\r\nthe others. He was a tall, powerful, handsome gentleman, with a\r\nmilitary appearance.\r\n\r\nJust now he was smiling down into the face of a young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\r\nBarberoux is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying in a loud, cheerful voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cour English law is too kind to the criminal, especially to the\r\nmurderer. If we conducted our trials in the French fashion, the place\r\nwe have just left would be very much fuller than it is to-day. A man of\r\nwhose guilt we are absolutely assured is oftener than not acquitted,\r\nand then the public taunt us with \xe2\x80\x98another undiscovered crime!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean, Sir John, that murderers sometimes escape scot-free? Take\r\nthe man who has been committing all these awful murders this last\r\nmonth? I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt _he\xe2\x80\x99ll_ be hanged\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99s ever\r\ncaught, that is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer girlish voice rang out, and Mrs. Bunting could hear every word that\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\nThe whole party gathered round, listening eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, no.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke\r\nvery deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if that particular murderer ever will be\r\nhanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch him?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl spoke with a touch of\r\nairy impertinence in her clear voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall end by catching him\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he waited a moment, then\r\nadded in a lower voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnow don\xe2\x80\x99t give me away to a newspaper fellow,\r\nMiss Rose\xe2\x80\x94because now I think we do know who the murderer in question\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral of those standing near by uttered expressions of surprise and\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t you catch him?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say we knew _where_ he was; I only said we knew who he was,\r\nor, rather, perhaps I ought to say that I personally have a very strong\r\nsuspicion of his identity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir John\xe2\x80\x99s French colleague looked up quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDe Leipsic and\r\nLiverpool man?\xe2\x80\x9d he said interrogatively.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the case turned up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, speaking very quickly, as if he wished to dismiss the subject\r\nfrom his own mind, and from that of his auditors, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour murders of the kind were committed eight years ago\xe2\x80\x94two in\r\nLeipsic, the others, just afterwards, in Liverpool,\xe2\x80\x94and there were\r\ncertain peculiarities connected with the crimes which made it clear\r\nthey were committed by the same hand. The perpetrator was caught,\r\nfortunately for us, red-handed, just as he was leaving the house of his\r\nlast victim, for in Liverpool the murder was committed in a house. I\r\nmyself saw the unhappy man\xe2\x80\x94I say unhappy, for there is no doubt at all\r\nthat he was mad\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he hesitated, and added in a lower tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csuffering\r\nfrom an acute form of religious mania. I myself saw him, as I say, at\r\nsome length. But now comes the really interesting point. I have just\r\nbeen informed that a month ago this criminal lunatic, as we must of\r\ncourse regard him, made his escape from the asylum where he was\r\nconfined. He arranged the whole thing with extraordinary cunning and\r\nintelligence, and we should probably have caught him long ago, were it\r\nnot that he managed, when on his way out of the place, to annex a\r\nconsiderable sum of money in gold, with which the wages of the asylum\r\nstaff were about to be paid. It is owing to that fact that his escape\r\nwas, very wrongly, concealed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, as if sorry he had said so much, and a moment\r\nlater the party were walking in Indian file through the turnstile, Sir\r\nJohn Burney leading the way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting looked straight before her. She felt\xe2\x80\x94so she expressed it\r\nto her husband later\xe2\x80\x94as if she had been turned to stone.\r\n\r\nEven had she wished to do so, she had neither the time nor the power to\r\nwarn her lodger of his danger, for Daisy and her companion were now\r\ncoming down the room, bearing straight for the Commissioner of Police.\r\nIn another moment Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s lodger and Sir John Burney were face\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth swerved to one side; there came a terrible change over his\r\npale, narrow face; it became discomposed, livid with rage and terror.\r\n\r\nBut, to Mrs. Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s relief\xe2\x80\x94yes, to her inexpressible relief\xe2\x80\x94Sir John\r\nBurney and his friends swept on. They passed Mr. Sleuth and the girl by\r\nhis side, unaware, or so it seemed to her, that there was anyone else\r\nin the room but themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, Mrs. Bunting,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnstile-keeper; \xe2\x80\x9cyou and your\r\nfriends will have the place all to yourselves for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d From an\r\nofficial he had become a man, and it was the man in Mr. Hopkins that\r\ngallantly addressed pretty Daisy Bunting: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems strange that a\r\nyoung lady like you should want to go in and see all those \xe2\x80\x99orrible\r\nfrights,\xe2\x80\x9d he said jestingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bunting, may I trouble you to come over here for a moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were hissed rather than spoken by Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\nHis landlady took a doubtful step towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA last word with you, Mrs. Bunting.\xe2\x80\x9d The lodger\xe2\x80\x99s face was still\r\ndistorted with fear and passion. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not think to escape the\r\nconsequences of your hideous treachery. I trusted you, Mrs. Bunting,\r\nand you betrayed me! But I am protected by a higher power, for I still\r\nhave much to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, his voice sinking to a whisper, he hissed out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour end will be bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword.\r\nYour feet shall go down to death, and your steps take hold on hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven while Mr. Sleuth was muttering these strange, dreadful words, he\r\nwas looking round, glancing this way and that, seeking a way of escape.\r\n\r\nAt last his eyes became fixed on a small placard placed above a\r\ncurtain. \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency Exit\xe2\x80\x9d was written there. Mrs. Bunting thought he\r\nwas going to make a dash for the place; but Mr. Sleuth did something\r\nvery different. Leaving his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s side, he walked over to the\r\nturnstile, he fumbled in his pocket for a moment, and then touched the\r\nman on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking very rapidly; \xe2\x80\x9cvery ill\r\nindeed! It is the atmosphere of this place. I want you to let me out by\r\nthe quickest way. It would be a pity for me to faint here\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nwith ladies about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis left hand shot out and placed what he had been fumbling for in his\r\npocket on the other\xe2\x80\x99s bare palm. \xe2\x80\x9cI see there\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency exit over\r\nthere. Would it be possible for me to get out that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, sir; I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated; he felt a slight, a very sight, feeling of\r\nmisgiving. He looked at Daisy, flushed and smiling, happy and\r\nunconcerned, and then at Mrs. Bunting. She was very pale; but surely\r\nher lodger\xe2\x80\x99s sudden seizure was enough to make her feel worried.\r\nHopkins felt the half-sovereign pleasantly tickling his palm. The Paris\r\nPrefect of Police had given him only half-a-crown\xe2\x80\x94mean, shabby\r\nforeigner!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; I can let you out that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cand p\xe2\x80\x99raps\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re standing out in the air, on the iron balcony, you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel\r\nbetter. But then, you know, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come round to the front\r\nif you wants to come in again, for those emergency doors only open\r\noutward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand! If I feel\r\nbetter I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in by the front way, and pay another shilling\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t do that if you\xe2\x80\x99ll just explain what happened here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man went and pulled the curtain aside, and put his shoulder against\r\nthe door. It burst open, and the light, for a moment, blinded Mr.\r\nSleuth.\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand over his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cthank you.\r\nI shall get all right out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn iron stairway led down into a small stable yard, of which the door\r\nopened into a side street.\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth looked round once more; he really did feel very ill\xe2\x80\x94ill and\r\ndazed. How pleasant it would be to take a flying leap over the balcony\r\nrailing and find rest, eternal rest, below.\r\n\r\nBut no\xe2\x80\x94he thrust the thought, the temptation, from him. Again a\r\nconvulsive look of rage came over his face. He had remembered his\r\nlandlady. How could the woman whom he had treated so generously have\r\nbetrayed him to his arch-enemy?\xe2\x80\x94to the official, that is, who had\r\nentered into a conspiracy years ago to have him confined\xe2\x80\x94him, an\r\nabsolutely sane man with a great avenging work to do in the world\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nlunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nHe stepped out into the open air, and the curtain, falling-to behind\r\nhim, blotted out the tall, thin figure from the little group of people\r\nwho had watched him disappear.\r\n\r\nEven Daisy felt a little scared. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did look bad, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he, now?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nturned appealingly to Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that he did, poor gentleman\xe2\x80\x94your lodger, too?\xe2\x80\x9d he looked\r\nsympathetically at Mrs. Bunting.\r\n\r\nShe moistened her lips with her tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated dully, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nlodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn vain Mr. Hopkins invited Mrs. Bunting and her pretty stepdaughter to\r\nstep through into the Chamber of Horrors. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we ought to go\r\nstraight home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s landlady decidedly. And Daisy meekly\r\nassented. Somehow the girl felt confused, a little scared by the\r\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance. Perhaps this unwonted feeling of hers\r\nwas induced by the look of stunned surprise and, yes, pain, on her\r\nstepmother\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nSlowly they made their way out of the building, and when they got home\r\nit was Daisy who described the strange way Mr. Sleuth had been taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll be long before he comes home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting\r\nheavily, and he cast an anxious, furtive look at his wife. She looked\r\nas if stricken in a vital part; he saw from her face that there was\r\nsomething wrong\xe2\x80\x94very wrong indeed.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged on. All three felt moody and ill at ease. Daisy knew\r\nthere was no chance that young Chandler would come in to-day.\r\n\r\nAbout six o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mrs. Bunting went upstairs. She lit the gas in Mr.\r\nSleuth\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room and looked about her with a fearful glance.\r\nSomehow everything seemed to speak to her of the lodger, there lay her\r\nBible and his Concordance, side by side on the table, exactly as he had\r\nleft them, when he had come downstairs and suggested that ill-starred\r\nexpedition to his landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. She took a few steps forward,\r\nlistening the while anxiously for the familiar sound of the click in\r\nthe door which would tell her that the lodger had come back, and then\r\nshe went over to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\nWhat a cold night for a man to be wandering about, homeless,\r\nfriendless, and, as she suspected with a pang, with but very little\r\nmoney on him!\r\n\r\nTurning abruptly, she went into the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom and opened the\r\ndrawer of the looking-glass.\r\n\r\nYes, there lay the much-diminished heap of sovereigns. If only he had\r\ntaken his money out with him! She wondered painfully whether he had\r\nenough on his person to secure a good night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and then\r\nsuddenly she remembered that which brought relief to her mind. The\r\nlodger had given something to that Hopkins fellow\xe2\x80\x94either a sovereign or\r\nhalf a sovereign, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure which.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Mr. Sleuth\xe2\x80\x99s cruel words to her, of his threat, did not\r\ndisturb her overmuch. It had been a mistake\xe2\x80\x94all a mistake. Far from\r\nbetraying Mr. Sleuth, she had sheltered him\xe2\x80\x94kept his awful secret as\r\nshe could not have kept it had she known, or even dimly suspected, the\r\nhorrible fact with which Sir John Burney\xe2\x80\x99s words had made her\r\nacquainted; namely, that Mr. Sleuth was victim of no temporary\r\naberration, but that he was, and had been for years, a madman, a\r\nhomicidal maniac.\r\n\r\nIn her ears there still rang the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s half careless yet\r\nconfident question, \xe2\x80\x9cDe Leipsic and Liverpool man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing a sudden impulse, she went back into the sitting-room, and\r\ntaking a black-headed pin out of her bodice stuck it amid the leaves of\r\nthe Bible. Then she opened the Book, and looked at the page the pin had\r\nmarked:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken . . . There is\r\nnone to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last leaving the Bible open, Mrs. Bunting went downstairs, and as\r\nshe opened the door of her sitting-room Daisy came towards her\r\nstepmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and start getting the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s supper ready for you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the girl good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s certain to come in when he gets\r\nhungry. But he did look upset, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Ellen? Right down bad\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\ndid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting made no answer; she simply stepped aside to allow Daisy to\r\ngo down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth won\xe2\x80\x99t never come back no more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sombrely, and then\r\nshe felt both glad and angry at the extraordinary change which came\r\nover her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face. Yet, perversely, that look of relief, of\r\nright-down joy, chiefly angered her, and tempted her to add, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nsay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s face altered again; the old, anxious, depressed look, the\r\nlook it had worn the last few days, returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t come back?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo long to tell you now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till the child\xe2\x80\x99s gone to\r\nbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting had to restrain his curiosity.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when at last Daisy had gone off to the back room where she\r\nnow slept with her stepmother, Mrs. Bunting beckoned to her husband to\r\nfollow her upstairs.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so he went down the passage and put the chain on the door.\r\nAnd about this they had a few sharp whispered words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re never going to shut him out?\xe2\x80\x9d she expostulated angrily, beneath\r\nher breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to leave Daisy down here with that man perhaps walking\r\nin any minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sleuth won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt Daisy, bless you! Much more likely to hurt me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand she gave a half sob.\r\n\r\nBunting stared at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nupstairs and tell me what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, in what had been the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, Mrs. Bunting told\r\nher husband exactly what it was that had happened.\r\n\r\nHe listened in heavy silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, Bunting, that \xe2\x80\x99twas me that\r\nwas right after all. The lodger was never responsible for his actions.\r\nI never thought he was, for my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting stared at her ruminatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cDepends on what you call\r\nresponsible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began argumentatively.\r\n\r\nBut she would have none of that. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard the gentleman say myself that\r\nhe was a lunatic,\xe2\x80\x9d she said fiercely. And then, dropping her voice, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nreligious maniac\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he called him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he never seemed so to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe simply\r\nseemed to me \xe2\x80\x99centric\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all he did. Not a bit madder than many I\r\ncould tell you of.\xe2\x80\x9d He was walking round the room restlessly, but he\r\nstopped short at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xe2\x80\x99you think we ought to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting shook her head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ought to do\r\nnothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then again he began walking round the room in an aimless fashion\r\nthat irritated her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could put out a bit of supper for him somewhere where he\r\nwould get it! And his money, too? I hate to feel it\xe2\x80\x99s in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you make any mistake\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll come back for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting,\r\nwith decision.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bunting shook her head. She knew better. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ngo off up to bed. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use us sitting up any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting acquiesced.\r\n\r\nShe ran down and got him a bedroom candle\xe2\x80\x94there was no gas in the\r\nlittle back bedroom upstairs. And then she watched him go slowly up.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned and came down again. \xe2\x80\x9cEllen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an urgent\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was you I\xe2\x80\x99d take the chain off the door, and I\xe2\x80\x99d lock\r\nmyself in\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. Then he can sneak in and take\r\nhis dirty money away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting neither nodded nor shook her head. Slowly she went\r\ndownstairs, and there she carried out half of Bunting\xe2\x80\x99s advice. She\r\ntook, that is, the chain off the front door. But she did not go to bed,\r\nneither did she lock herself in. She sat up all night, waiting. At\r\nhalf-past seven she made herself a cup of tea, and then she went into\r\nher bedroom.\r\n\r\nDaisy opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I was that tired, and slept so\r\nsound, that I never heard you come to bed or get up\xe2\x80\x94funny, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung people don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep as light as do old folks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bunting said\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the lodger come in after all? I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunting shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if \xe2\x80\x99twould be a fine day for\r\nyou down at Richmond,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed in a kindly tone.\r\n\r\nAnd Daisy smiled, a very happy, confident little smile.\r\n\r\nThat evening Mrs. Bunting forced herself to tell young Chandler that\r\ntheir lodger had, so to speak, disappeared. She and Bunting had thought\r\ncarefully over what they would say, and so well did they carry out\r\ntheir programme, or, what is more likely, so full was young Chandler of\r\nthe long happy day he and Daisy had spent together, that he took their\r\nnews very calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone away, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed casually. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope he paid up all\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bunting hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cNo trouble of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bunting said shamefacedly, \xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, the lodger was quite an\r\nhonest gentleman, Joe. But I feel worried, about him. He was such a\r\npoor, gentle chap\xe2\x80\x94not the sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man one likes to think of as\r\nwandering about by himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always said he was \xe2\x80\x99centric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cRegular right-down queer.\r\nLeetle touched, you know, under the thatch,\xe2\x80\x9d and, as he tapped his head\r\nsignificantly, both young people burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like a description of him circulated?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Joe\r\ngood-naturedly.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bunting looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Not yet awhile at any rate. \xe2\x80\x99Twould upset him\r\nawfully, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Joe acquiesced. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised at the number o\xe2\x80\x99 people who\r\ndisappears and are never heard of again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully. And then\r\nhe got up, very reluctantly.\r\n\r\nDaisy, making no bones about it this time, followed him out into the\r\npassage, and shut the sitting-room door behind her.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back she walked over to where her father was sitting in\r\nhis easy chair, and standing behind him she put her arms round his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThen she bent down her head. \xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a bit of news\r\nfor you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you surprised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do _you_ think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bunting fondly. Then he turned round\r\nand, catching hold of her head, gave her a good, hearty kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll Old Aunt say, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about Old Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his wife suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmanage Old Aunt! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and see her. She and I have always got on\r\npretty comfortable together, as you knows well, Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy a little wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have, Ellen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sleuth never came back, and at last after many days and many nights\r\nhad gone by, Mrs. Bunting left off listening for the click of the lock\r\nwhich she at once hoped and feared would herald her lodger\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nAs suddenly and as mysteriously as they had begun the \xe2\x80\x9cAvenger\xe2\x80\x9d murders\r\nstopped, but there came a morning in the early spring when a gardener,\r\nworking in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, found a newspaper in which was wrapped,\r\ntogether with a half-worn pair of rubber-soled shoes, a long,\r\npeculiarly shaped knife. The fact, though of considerable interest to\r\nthe police, was not chronicled in any newspaper, but about the same\r\ntime a picturesque little paragraph went the round of the press\r\nconcerning a small boxful of sovereigns which had been anonymously\r\nforwarded to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Bunting had been as good as her word about \xe2\x80\x9cOld Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand that lady had received the wonderful news concerning Daisy in a\r\nmore philosophical spirit than her great-niece had expected her to do.\r\nShe only observed that it was odd to reflect that if gentlefolks leave\r\na house in charge of the police a burglary is pretty sure to follow\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nremark which Daisy resented much more than did her Joe.\r\n\r\nMr. Bunting and his Ellen are now in the service of an old lady, by\r\nwhom they are feared as well as respected, and whom they make very\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LODGER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2014-0.txt or 2014-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/1/2014/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
