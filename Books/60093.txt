This book _is_ the South. I do not\r\nmean that _Cane_ covers the South or is the South\xe2\x80\x99s full voice. Merely\r\nthis: a poet has arisen among our American youth who has known how to\r\nturn the essences and materials of his Southland into the essences and\r\nmaterials of literature. A poet has arisen in that land who writes, not\r\nas a Southerner, not as a rebel against Southerners, not as a Negro,\r\nnot as apologist or priest or critic: who writes as a _poet_. The\r\nfashioning of beauty is ever foremost in his inspiration: not forcedly\r\nbut simply, and because these ultimate aspects of his world are to him\r\nmore real than all its specific problems. He has made songs and lovely\r\nstories of his land ... not of its yesterday, but of its immediate\r\nlife. And that has been enough.\r\n\r\nHow rare this is will be clear to those who have followed with\r\nconcern the struggle of the South toward literary expression, and the\r\nparticular trial of that portion of its folk whose skin is dark. The\r\ngifted Negro has been too often thwarted from becoming a poet because\r\nhis world was forever forcing him to recollect that he was a Negro.\r\nThe artist must lose such lesser identities in the great well of life.\r\nThe English poet is not forever protesting and recalling that he is\r\nEnglish. It is so natural and easy for him to be English that he can\r\nsing as a man. The French novelist is not forever noting: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nFrench.\xe2\x80\x9d It is so atmospheric for him to be French, that he can devote\r\nhimself to saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is human.\xe2\x80\x9d This is an imperative condition for\r\nthe creating of deep art. The whole will and mind of the creator must\r\ngo below the surfaces of race. And this has been an almost impossible\r\ncondition for the American Negro to achieve, forced every moment of his\r\nlife into a specific and superficial plane of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe first negative significance of _Cane_ is that this so natural\r\nand restrictive state of mind is completely lacking. For Toomer,\r\nthe Southland is not a problem to be solved; it is a field of\r\nloveliness to be sung: the Georgia Negro is not a downtrodden soul\r\nto be uplifted; he is material for gorgeous painting: the segregated\r\nself-conscious brown belt of Washington is not a topic to be discussed\r\nand exposed; it is a subject of beauty and of drama, worthy of creation\r\nin literary form.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, therefore, that this is a first book in more ways\r\nthan one. It is a harbinger of the South\xe2\x80\x99s literary maturity: of its\r\nemergence from the obsession put upon its minds by the unending racial\r\ncrisis\xe2\x80\x94an obsession from which writers have made their indirect escape\r\nthrough sentimentalism, exoticism, polemic, \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d fiction, and\r\nmoral melodrama. It marks the dawn of direct and unafraid creation.\r\nAnd, as the initial work of a man of twenty-seven, it is the harbinger\r\nof a literary force of whose incalculable future I believe no reader of\r\nthis book will be in doubt.\r\n\r\nHow typical is _Cane_ of the South\xe2\x80\x99s still virgin soil and of its\r\npressing seeds! and the book\xe2\x80\x99s chaos of verse, tale, drama, its\r\nrhythmic rolling shift from lyrism to narrative, from mystery to\r\nintimate pathos! But read the book through and you will see a\r\ncomplex and significant form take substance from its chaos. Part One\r\nis the primitive and evanescent black world of Georgia. Part Two is\r\nthe threshing and suffering brown world of Washington, lifted by\r\nopportunity and contact into the anguish of self-conscious struggle.\r\nPart Three is Georgia again ... the invasion into this black womb of\r\nthe ferment seed: the neurotic, educated, spiritually stirring Negro.\r\nAs a broad form this is superb, and the very looseness and unexpected\r\nwaves of the book\xe2\x80\x99s parts make _Cane_ still more _South_, still more of\r\nan \xc3\xa6sthetic equivalent of the land.\r\n\r\nWhat a land it is! What an \xc3\x86schylean beauty to its fateful problem!\r\nThose of you who love our South will find here some of your love. Those\r\nof you who know it not will perhaps begin to understand what a warm\r\nsplendor is at last at dawn.\r\n\r\n    A feast of moon and men and barking hounds,\r\n    An orgy for some genius of the South\r\n    With bloodshot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth\r\n    Surprised in making folk-songs....\r\n\r\nSo, in his still sometimes clumsy stride (for Toomer is finally a\r\npoet in prose) the author gives you an inkling of his revelation. An\r\nindividual force, wise enough to drink humbly at this great spring of\r\nhis land ... such is the first impression of Jean Toomer. But beyond\r\nthis wisdom and this power (which shows itself perhaps most splendidly\r\nin his complete freedom from the sense of persecution), there rises\r\na figure more significant: the artist, hard, self-immolating, the\r\nartist who is not interested in races, whose domain is Life. The book\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinal Part is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cpromise\xe2\x80\x9d; it is achievement. It is no mere\r\ndawn: it is a bit of the full morning. These materials ... the ancient\r\nblack man, mute, inaccessible, and yet so mystically close to the new\r\ntumultuous members of his race, the simple slave Past, the shredding\r\nNegro Present, the iridescent passionate dream of the To-morrow ...\r\nare made and measured by a craftsman into an unforgettable music. The\r\nnotes of his counterpoint are particular, the themes are of intimate\r\nconnection with us Americans. But the result is that abstract and\r\nabsolute thing called Art.\r\n\r\n                                                         WALDO FRANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Certain of these pieces have appeared in _Broom_, _Crisis_,\r\n  _Double Dealer_, _Liberator_, _Little Review_, _Modern Review_,\r\n  _Nomad_, _Prairie_, and _S 4 N_.\r\n\r\n  To these magazines: thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  FOREWORD, by _Waldo Frank_                                         vii\r\n\r\n\r\n  KARINTHA                                                             1\r\n\r\n  REAPERS                                                              6\r\n\r\n  NOVEMBER COTTON FLOWER                                               7\r\n\r\n  BECKY                                                                8\r\n\r\n  FACE                                                                14\r\n\r\n  COTTON SONG                                                         15\r\n\r\n  CARMA                                                               16\r\n\r\n  SONG OF THE SON                                                     21\r\n\r\n  GEORGIA DUSK                                                        22\r\n\r\n  FERN                                                                24\r\n\r\n  NULLO                                                               34\r\n\r\n  EVENING SONG                                                        35\r\n\r\n  ESTHER                                                              36\r\n\r\n  CONVERSION                                                          49\r\n\r\n  PORTRAIT IN GEORGIA                                                 50\r\n\r\n  BLOOD-BURNING MOON                                                  51\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEVENTH STREET                                                      71\r\n\r\n  RHOBERT                                                             73\r\n\r\n  AVEY                                                                76\r\n\r\n  BEEHIVE                                                             89\r\n\r\n  STORM ENDING                                                        90\r\n\r\n  THEATER                                                             91\r\n\r\n  HER LIPS ARE COPPER WIRE                                           101\r\n\r\n  CALLING JESUS                                                      102\r\n\r\n  BOX SEAT                                                           104\r\n\r\n  PRAYER                                                             131\r\n\r\n  HARVEST SONG                                                       132\r\n\r\n  BONA AND PAUL                                                      134\r\n\r\n\r\n  KABNIS                                                             157\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               KARINTHA\r\n\r\n    Her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon,\r\n    O cant you see it, O cant you see it,\r\n    Her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon\r\n    ... When the sun goes down.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen had always wanted her, this Karintha, even as a child, Karintha\r\ncarrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. Old men rode\r\nher hobby-horse upon their knees. Young men danced with her at frolics\r\nwhen they should have been dancing with their grown-up girls. God grant\r\nus youth, secretly prayed the old men. The young fellows counted the\r\ntime to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them. This\r\ninterest of the male, who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon,\r\ncould mean no good to her.\r\n\r\nKarintha, at twelve, was a wild flash that told the other folks just\r\nwhat it was to live. At sunset, when there was no wind, and the\r\npine-smoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth, and you couldnt\r\nsee more than a few feet in front, her sudden darting past you was a\r\nbit of vivid color, like a black bird that flashes in light. With the\r\nother children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping\r\nin the two-inch dust. Karintha\xe2\x80\x99s running was a whir. It had the sound\r\nof the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road. At dusk,\r\nduring the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before\r\nany of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her\r\nvoice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one\xe2\x80\x99s ears to itching. But no\r\none ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the cows,\r\nand beat her dog, and fought the other children... Even the preacher,\r\nwho caught her at mischief, told himself that she was as innocently\r\nlovely as a November cotton flower. Already, rumors were out about\r\nher. Homes in Georgia are most often built on the two-room plan. In\r\none, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on.\r\nKarintha had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving.\r\nOne could but imitate one\xe2\x80\x99s parents, for to follow them was the way of\r\nGod. She played \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d with a small boy who was not afraid to do her\r\nbidding. That started the whole thing. Old men could no longer ride her\r\nhobby-horse upon their knees. But young men counted faster.\r\n\r\n    Her skin is like dusk,\r\n    O cant you see it,\r\n    Her skin is like dusk,\r\n    When the sun goes down.\r\n\r\nKarintha is a woman. She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the\r\nsun goes down. She has been married many times. Old men remind her that\r\na few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Karintha\r\nsmiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it. She has\r\ncontempt for them. Karintha is a woman. Young men run stills to make\r\nher money. Young men go to the big cities and run on the road. Young\r\nmen go away to college. They all want to bring her money. These are\r\nthe young men who thought that all they had to do was to count time.\r\nBut Karintha is a woman, and she has had a child. A child fell out of\r\nher womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest. Pine-needles are\r\nsmooth and sweet. They are elastic to the feet of rabbits... A sawmill\r\nwas nearby. Its pyramidal sawdust pile smouldered. It is a year before\r\none completely burns. Meanwhile, the smoke curls up and hangs in odd\r\nwraiths about the trees, curls up, and spreads itself out over the\r\nvalley... Weeks after Karintha returned home the smoke was so heavy\r\nyou tasted it in water. Some one made a song:\r\n\r\n    Smoke is on the hills. Rise up.\r\n    Smoke is on the hills, O rise\r\n    And take my soul to Jesus.\r\n\r\nKarintha is a woman. Men do not know that the soul of her was a growing\r\nthing ripened too soon. They will bring their money; they will die not\r\nhaving found it out... Karintha at twenty, carrying beauty, perfect\r\nas dusk when the sun goes down. Karintha...\r\n\r\n    Her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon,\r\n    O cant you see it, O cant you see it,\r\n    Her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon\r\n    ... When the sun goes down.\r\n\r\n    Goes down...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                REAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Black reapers with the sound of steel on stones\r\n    Are sharpening scythes. I see them place the hones\r\n    In their hip-pockets as a thing that\xe2\x80\x99s done,\r\n    And start their silent swinging, one by one.\r\n    Black horses drive a mower through the weeds,\r\n    And there, a field rat, startled, squealing bleeds,\r\n    His belly close to ground. I see the blade,\r\n    Blood-stained, continue cutting weeds and shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOVEMBER COTTON FLOWER\r\n\r\n\r\n    Boll-weevil\xe2\x80\x99s coming, and the winter\xe2\x80\x99s cold,\r\n    Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,\r\n    And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,\r\n    Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,\r\n    Failed in its function as the autumn rake;\r\n    Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take\r\n    All water from the streams; dead birds were found\r\n    In wells a hundred feet below the ground\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Such was the season when the flower bloomed.\r\n    Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed\r\n    Significance. Superstition saw\r\n    Something it had never seen before:\r\n    Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,\r\n    Beauty so sudden for that time of year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BECKY\r\n\r\n  Becky was the white woman who had two Negro sons. She\xe2\x80\x99s dead;\r\n  they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone away. The pines whisper to Jesus. The Bible flaps\r\n  its leaves with an aimless rustle on her mound.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecky had one Negro son. Who gave it to her? Damn buck nigger, said the\r\nwhite folks\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. She wouldnt tell. Common, God-forsaken, insane\r\nwhite shameless wench, said the white folks\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. Her eyes were\r\nsunken, her neck stringy, her breasts fallen, till then. Taking their\r\nwords, they filled her, like a bubble rising\xe2\x80\x94then she broke. Mouth\r\nsetting in a twist that held her eyes, harsh, vacant, staring... Who\r\ngave it to her? Low-down nigger with no self-respect, said the black\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. She wouldnt tell. Poor Catholic poor-white crazy woman,\r\nsaid the black folks\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. White folks and black folks built her\r\ncabin, fed her and her growing baby, prayed secretly to God who\xe2\x80\x99d put\r\nHis cross upon her and cast her out.\r\n\r\nWhen the first was born, the white folks said they\xe2\x80\x99d have no more to do\r\nwith her. And black folks, they too joined hands to cast her out...\r\nThe pines whispered to Jesus.. The railroad boss said not to say he\r\nsaid it, but she could live, if she wanted to, on the narrow strip\r\nof land between the railroad and the road. John Stone, who owned the\r\nlumber and the bricks, would have shot the man who told he gave the\r\nstuff to Lonnie Deacon, who stole out there at night and built the\r\ncabin. A single room held down to earth... O fly away to Jesus ... by\r\na leaning chimney...\r\n\r\nSix trains each day rumbled past and shook the ground under her cabin.\r\nFords, and horse- and mule-drawn buggies went back and forth along the\r\nroad. No one ever saw her. Trainmen, and passengers who\xe2\x80\x99d heard about\r\nher, threw out papers and food. Threw out little crumpled slips of\r\npaper scribbled with prayers, as they passed her eye-shaped piece of\r\nsandy ground. Ground islandized between the road and railroad track.\r\nPushed up where a blue-sheen God with listless eyes could look at it.\r\nFolks from the town took turns, unknown, of course, to each other, in\r\nbringing corn and meat and sweet potatoes. Even sometimes snuff... O\r\nthank y Jesus... Old David Georgia, grinding cane and boiling syrup,\r\nnever went her way without some sugar sap. No one ever saw her. The boy\r\ngrew up and ran around. When he was five years old as folks reckoned\r\nit, Hugh Jourdon saw him carrying a baby. \xe2\x80\x9cBecky has another son,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nwhat the whole town knew. But nothing was said, for the part of man\r\nthat says things to the likes of that had told itself that if there was\r\na Becky, that Becky now was dead.\r\n\r\nThe two boys grew. Sullen and cunning... O pines, whisper to Jesus;\r\ntell Him to come and press sweet Jesus-lips against their lips and\r\neyes... It seemed as though with those two big fellows there, there\r\ncould be no room for Becky. The part that prayed wondered if perhaps\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d really died, and they had buried her. No one dared ask. They\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeat and cut a man who meant nothing at all in mentioning that they\r\nlived along the road. White or colored? No one knew, and least of all\r\nthemselves. They drifted around from job to job. We, who had cast out\r\ntheir mother because of them, could we take them in? They answered\r\nblack and white folks by shooting up two men and leaving town. \xe2\x80\x9cGodam\r\nthe white folks; godam the niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted as they left town.\r\nBecky? Smoke curled up from her chimney; she must be there. Trains\r\npassing shook the ground. The ground shook the leaning chimney. Nobody\r\nnoticed it. A creepy feeling came over all who saw that thin wraith\r\nof smoke and felt the trembling of the ground. Folks began to take\r\nher food again. They quit it soon because they had a fear. Becky if\r\ndead might be a hant, and if alive\xe2\x80\x94it took some nerve even to mention\r\nit... O pines, whisper to Jesus...\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday. Our congregation had been visiting at Pulverton, and\r\nwere coming home. There was no wind. The autumn sun, the bell from\r\nEbenezer Church, listless and heavy. Even the pines were stale, sticky,\r\nlike the smell of food that makes you sick. Before we turned the bend\r\nof the road that would show us the Becky cabin, the horses stopped\r\nstock-still, pushed back their ears, and nervously whinnied. We urged,\r\nthen whipped them on. Quarter of a mile away thin smoke curled up from\r\nthe leaning chimney... O pines, whisper to Jesus... Goose-flesh came\r\non my skin though there still was neither chill nor wind. Eyes left\r\ntheir sockets for the cabin. Ears burned and throbbed. Uncanny eclipse!\r\nfear closed my mind. We were just about to pass... Pines shout to\r\nJesus!.. the ground trembled as a ghost train rumbled by. The chimney\r\nfell into the cabin. Its thud was like a hollow report, ages having\r\npassed since it went off. Barlo and I were pulled out of our seats.\r\nDragged to the door that had swung open. Through the dust we saw the\r\nbricks in a mound upon the floor. Becky, if she was there, lay under\r\nthem. I thought I heard a groan. Barlo, mumbling something, threw his\r\nBible on the pile. (No one has ever touched it.) Somehow we got away.\r\nMy buggy was still on the road. The last thing that I remember was\r\nwhipping old Dan like fury; I remember nothing after that\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nuntil I reached town and folks crowded round to get the true word of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  Becky was the white woman who had two Negro sons. She\xe2\x80\x99s dead;\r\n  they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone away. The pines whisper to Jesus. The Bible flaps\r\n  its leaves with an aimless rustle on her mound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FACE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hair\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    silver-gray,\r\n    like streams of stars,\r\n    Brows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    recurved canoes\r\n    quivered by the ripples blown by pain,\r\n    Her eyes\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    mist of tears\r\n    condensing on the flesh below\r\n    And her channeled muscles\r\n    are cluster grapes of sorrow\r\n    purple in the evening sun\r\n    nearly ripe for worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COTTON SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come, brother, come.

Come along.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarma, in overalls, and strong as any man, stands behind the old brown\r\nmule, driving the wagon home. It bumps, and groans, and shakes as it\r\ncrosses the railroad track. She, riding it easy. I leave the men around\r\nthe stove to follow her with my eyes down the red dust road. Nigger\r\nwoman driving a Georgia chariot down an old dust road. Dixie Pike is\r\nwhat they call it. Maybe she feels my gaze, perhaps she expects it.\r\nAnyway, she turns. The sun, which has been slanting over her shoulder,\r\nshoots primitive rockets into her mangrove-gloomed, yellow flower face.\r\nHi! Yip! God has left the Moses-people for the nigger. \xe2\x80\x9cGedap.\xe2\x80\x9d Using\r\nreins to slap the mule, she disappears in a cloudy rumble at some\r\nindefinite point along the road.\r\n\r\n(The sun is hammered to a band of gold. Pine-needles, like mazda, are\r\nbrilliantly aglow. No rain has come to take the rustle from the falling\r\nsweet-gum leaves. Over in the forest, across the swamp, a sawmill\r\nblows its closing whistle. Smoke curls up. Marvelous web spun by the\r\nspider sawdust pile. Curls up and spreads itself pine-high above the\r\nbranch, a single silver band along the eastern valley. A black boy\r\n... you are the most sleepiest man I ever seed, Sleeping Beauty ...\r\ncradled on a gray mule, guided by the hollow sound of cow-bells, heads\r\nfor them through a rusty cotton field. From down the railroad track,\r\nthe chug-chug of a gas engine announces that the repair gang is coming\r\nhome. A girl in the yard of a whitewashed shack not much larger than\r\nthe stack of worn ties piled before it, sings. Her voice is loud.\r\nEchoes, like rain, sweep the valley. Dusk takes the polish from the\r\nrails. Lights twinkle in scattered houses. From far away, a sad strong\r\nsong. Pungent and composite, the smell of farmyards is the fragrance of\r\nthe woman. She does not sing; her body is a song. She is in the forest,\r\ndancing. Torches flare .. juju men, greegree, witch-doctors ..\r\ntorches go out... The Dixie Pike has grown from a goat path in Africa.\r\n\r\n                                                             _Night._\r\n\r\nFoxie, the bitch, slicks back her ears and barks at the rising moon.)\r\n\r\n    Wind is in the corn.

Come along.\r\n\r\nCarma\xe2\x80\x99s tale is the crudest melodrama. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s in the gang. And\r\nits her fault he got there. Working with a contractor, he was away most\r\nof the time. She had others. No one blames her for that. He returned\r\none day and hung around the town where he picked up week-old boasts and\r\nrumors... Bane accused her. She denied. He couldnt see that she was\r\nbecoming hysterical. He would have liked to take his fists and beat\r\nher. Who was strong as a man. Stronger. Words, like corkscrews, wormed\r\nto her strength. It fizzled out. Grabbing a gun, she rushed from the\r\nhouse and plunged across the road into a cane-brake.. There, in\r\nquarter heaven shone the crescent moon... Bane was afraid to follow\r\ntill he heard the gun go off. Then he wasted half an hour gathering\r\nthe neighbor men. They met in the road where lamp-light showed tracks\r\ndissolving in the loose earth about the cane. The search began. Moths\r\nflickered the lamps. They put them out. Really, because she still\r\nmight be live enough to shoot. Time and space have no meaning in a\r\ncanefield. No more than the interminable stalks... Some one stumbled\r\nover her. A cry went up. From the road, one would have thought that\r\nthey were cornering a rabbit or a skunk... It is difficult carrying\r\ndead weight through cane. They placed her on the sofa. A curious, nosey\r\nsomebody looked for the wound. This fussing with her clothes aroused\r\nher. Her eyes were weak and pitiable for so strong a woman. Slowly,\r\nthen like a flash, Bane came to know that the shot she fired, with\r\naverted head, was aimed to whistle like a dying hornet through the\r\ncane. Twice deceived, and one deception proved the other. His head went\r\noff. Slashed one of the men who\xe2\x80\x99d helped, the man who\xe2\x80\x99d stumbled over\r\nher. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s in the gang. Who was her husband. Should she not take\r\nothers, this Carma, strong as a man, whose tale as I have told it is\r\nthe crudest melodrama?\r\n\r\n    Wind is in the cane. Come along.\r\n    Cane leaves swaying, rusty with talk,\r\n    Scratching choruses above the guinea\xe2\x80\x99s squawk,\r\n    Wind is in the cane.

Flowed in soft cream foam and plaintive\r\nripples, in such a way that wherever your glance may momentarily have\r\nrested, it immediately thereafter wavered in the direction of her\r\neyes. The soft suggestion of down slightly darkened, like the shadow\r\nof a bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing might, the creamy brown color of her upper lip. Why,\r\nafter noticing it, you sought her eyes, I cannot tell you. Her nose was\r\naquiline, Semitic. If you have heard a Jewish cantor sing, if he has\r\ntouched you and made your own sorrow seem trivial when compared with\r\nhis, you will know my feeling when I follow the curves of her profile,\r\nlike mobile rivers, to their common delta. They were strange eyes. In\r\nthis, that they sought nothing\xe2\x80\x94that is, nothing that was obvious and\r\ntangible and that one could see, and they gave the impression that\r\nnothing was to be denied. When a woman seeks, you will have observed,\r\nher eyes deny. Fern\xe2\x80\x99s eyes desired nothing that you could give her;\r\nthere was no reason why they should withhold. Men saw her eyes and\r\nfooled themselves. Fern\xe2\x80\x99s eyes said to them that she was easy. When\r\nshe was young, a few men took her, but got no joy from it. And then,\r\nonce done, they felt bound to her (quite unlike their hit and run with\r\nother girls), felt as though it would take them a lifetime to fulfill\r\nan obligation which they could find no name for. They became attached\r\nto her, and hungered after finding the barest trace of what she might\r\ndesire. As she grew up, new men who came to town felt as almost\r\neveryone did who ever saw her: that they would not be denied. Men were\r\neverlastingly bringing her their bodies. Something inside of her got\r\ntired of them, I guess, for I am certain that for the life of her she\r\ncould not tell why or how she began to turn them off. A man in fever\r\nis no trifling thing to send away. They began to leave her, baffled\r\nand ashamed, yet vowing to themselves that some day they would do some\r\nfine thing for her: send her candy every week and not let her know whom\r\nit came from, watch out for her wedding-day and give her a magnificent\r\nsomething with no name on it, buy a house and deed it to her, rescue\r\nher from some unworthy fellow who had tricked her into marrying him.\r\nAs you know, men are apt to idolize or fear that which they cannot\r\nunderstand, especially if it be a woman. She did not deny them, yet the\r\nfact was that they were denied. A sort of superstition crept into their\r\nconsciousness of her being somehow above them. Being above them meant\r\nthat she was not to be approached by anyone. She became a virgin. Now a\r\nvirgin in a small southern town is by no means the usual thing, if you\r\nwill believe me. That the sexes were made to mate is the practice of\r\nthe South. Particularly, black folks were made to mate. And it is black\r\nfolks whom I have been talking about thus far. What white men thought\r\nof Fern I can arrive at only by analogy. They let her alone.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nAnyone, of course, could see her, could see her eyes. If you walked\r\nup the Dixie Pike most any time of day, you\xe2\x80\x99d be most like to see her\r\nresting listless-like on the railing of her porch, back propped against\r\na post, head tilted a little forward because there was a nail in the\r\nporch post just where her head came which for some reason or other she\r\nnever took the trouble to pull out. Her eyes, if it were sunset, rested\r\nidly where the sun, molten and glorious, was pouring down between the\r\nfringe of pines. Or maybe they gazed at the gray cabin on the knoll\r\nfrom which an evening folk-song was coming. Perhaps they followed a\r\ncow that had been turned loose to roam and feed on cotton-stalks and\r\ncorn leaves. Like as not they\xe2\x80\x99d settle on some vague spot above the\r\nhorizon, though hardly a trace of wistfulness would come to them. If it\r\nwere dusk, then they\xe2\x80\x99d wait for the search-light of the evening train\r\nwhich you could see miles up the track before it flared across the\r\nDixie Pike, close to her home. Wherever they looked, you\xe2\x80\x99d follow them\r\nand then waver back. Like her face, the whole countryside seemed to\r\nflow into her eyes. Flowed into them with the soft listless cadence of\r\nGeorgia\xe2\x80\x99s South. A young Negro, once, was looking at her, spellbound,\r\nfrom the road. A white man passing in a buggy had to flick him with\r\nhis whip if he was to get by without running him over. I first saw her\r\non her porch. I was passing with a fellow whose crusty numbness (I\r\nwas from the North and suspected of being prejudiced and stuck-up) was\r\nmelting as he found me warm. I asked him who she was. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Fern,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas all that I could get from him. Some folks already thought that I\r\nwas given to nosing around; I let it go at that, so far as questions\r\nwere concerned. But at first sight of her I felt as if I heard a Jewish\r\ncantor sing. As if his singing rose above the unheard chorus of a\r\nfolk-song. And I felt bound to her. I too had my dreams: something I\r\nwould do for her. I have knocked about from town to town too much not\r\nto know the futility of mere change of place. Besides, picture if you\r\ncan, this cream-colored solitary girl sitting at a tenement window\r\nlooking down on the indifferent throngs of Harlem. Better that she\r\nlisten to folk-songs at dusk in Georgia, you would say, and so would I.\r\nOr, suppose she came up North and married. Even a doctor or a lawyer,\r\nsay, one who would be sure to get along\xe2\x80\x94that is, make money. You and\r\nI know, who have had experience in such things, that love is not a\r\nthing like prejudice which can be bettered by changes of town. Could\r\nmen in Washington, Chicago, or New York, more than the men of Georgia,\r\nbring her something left vacant by the bestowal of their bodies? You\r\nand I who know men in these cities will have to say, they could not.\r\nSee her out and out a prostitute along State Street in Chicago. See\r\nher move into a southern town where white men are more aggressive. See\r\nher become a white man\xe2\x80\x99s concubine... Something I must do for her.\r\nThere was myself. What could I do for her? Talk, of course. Push back\r\nthe fringe of pines upon new horizons. To what purpose? and what for?\r\nHer? Myself? Men in her case seem to lose their selfishness. I lost\r\nmine before I touched her. I ask you, friend (it makes no difference\r\nif you sit in the Pullman or the Jim Crow as the train crosses her\r\nroad), what thoughts would come to you\xe2\x80\x94that is, after you\xe2\x80\x99d finished\r\nwith the thoughts that leap into men\xe2\x80\x99s minds at the sight of a pretty\r\nwoman who will not deny them; what thoughts would come to you, had\r\nyou seen her in a quick flash, keen and intuitively, as she sat there\r\non her porch when your train thundered by? Would you have got off at\r\nthe next station and come back for her to take her where? Would you\r\nhave completely forgotten her as soon as you reached Macon, Atlanta,\r\nAugusta, Pasadena, Madison, Chicago, Boston, or New Orleans? Would you\r\ntell your wife or sweetheart about a girl you saw? Your thoughts can\r\nhelp me, and I would like to know. Something I would do for her...\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nOne evening I walked up the Pike on purpose, and stopped to say hello.\r\nSome of her family were about, but they moved away to make room for me.\r\nDamn if I knew how to begin. Would you? Mr. and Miss So-and-So, people,\r\nthe weather, the crops, the new preacher, the frolic, the church\r\nbenefit, rabbit and possum hunting, the new soft drink they had at old\r\nPap\xe2\x80\x99s store, the schedule of the trains, what kind of town Macon was,\r\nNegro\xe2\x80\x99s migration north, boll-weevils, syrup, the Bible\xe2\x80\x94to all these\r\nthings she gave a yassur or nassur, without further comment. I began to\r\nwonder if perhaps my own emotional sensibility had played one of its\r\ntricks on me. \xe2\x80\x9cLets take a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d I at last ventured. The suggestion,\r\ncoming after so long an isolation, was novel enough, I guess, to\r\nsurprise. But it wasnt that. Something told me that men before me had\r\nsaid just that as a prelude to the offering of their bodies. I tried\r\nto tell her with my eyes. I think she understood. The thing from her\r\nthat made my throat catch, vanished. Its passing left her visible in a\r\nway I\xe2\x80\x99d thought, but never seen. We walked down the Pike with people on\r\nall the porches gaping at us. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesnt it make you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d She meant the\r\nrow of petty gossiping people. She meant the world. Through a canebrake\r\nthat was ripe for cutting, the branch was reached. Under a sweet-gum\r\ntree, and where reddish leaves had dammed the creek a little, we sat\r\ndown. Dusk, suggesting the almost imperceptible procession of giant\r\ntrees, settled with a purple haze about the cane. I felt strange, as I\r\nalways do in Georgia, particularly at dusk. I felt that things unseen\r\nto men were tangibly immediate. It would not have surprised me had\r\nI had vision. People have them in Georgia more often than you would\r\nsuppose. A black woman once saw the mother of Christ and drew her in\r\ncharcoal on the courthouse wall... When one is on the soil of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nancestors, most anything can come to one... From force of habit, I\r\nsuppose, I held Fern in my arms\xe2\x80\x94that is, without at first noticing\r\nit. Then my mind came back to her. Her eyes, unusually weird and open,\r\nheld me. Held God. He flowed in as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the countryside flow\r\nin. Seen men. I must have done something\xe2\x80\x94what, I dont know, in the\r\nconfusion of my emotion. She sprang up. Rushed some distance from me.\r\nFell to her knees, and began swaying, swaying. Her body was tortured\r\nwith something it could not let out. Like boiling sap it flooded arms\r\nand fingers till she shook them as if they burned her. It found her\r\nthroat, and spattered inarticulately in plaintive, convulsive sounds,\r\nmingled with calls to Christ Jesus. And then she sang, brokenly. A\r\nJewish cantor singing with a broken voice. A child\xe2\x80\x99s voice, uncertain,\r\nor an old man\xe2\x80\x99s. Dusk hid her; I could hear only her song. It seemed to\r\nme as though she were pounding her head in anguish upon the ground. I\r\nrushed to her. She fainted in my arms.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nThere was talk about her fainting with me in the canefield. And I\r\ngot one or two ugly looks from town men who\xe2\x80\x99d set themselves up to\r\nprotect her. In fact, there was talk of making me leave town. But\r\nthey never did. They kept a watch-out for me, though. Shortly after,\r\nI came back North. From the train window I saw her as I crossed her\r\nroad. Saw her on her porch, head tilted a little forward where the nail\r\nwas, eyes vaguely focused on the sunset.

Nothing ever came to Fern, not even I.\r\nSomething I would do for her. Some fine unnamed thing... And, friend,\r\nyou? She is still living, I have reason to know. Her name, against the\r\nchance that you might happen down that way, is Fernie May Rosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NULLO\r\n\r\n\r\n    A spray of pine-needles,\r\n    Dipped in western horizon gold,\r\n    Fell onto a path.\r\n    Dry moulds of cow-hoofs.\r\n    In the forest.\r\n    Rabbits knew not of their falling,\r\n    Nor did the forest catch aflame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EVENING SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    Full moon rising on the waters of my heart,\r\n    Lakes and moon and fires,\r\n    Cloine tires,\r\n    Holding her lips apart.\r\n\r\n    Promises of slumber leaving shore to charm the moon,\r\n    Miracle made vesper-keeps,\r\n    Cloine sleeps,\r\n    And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sleeping soon.\r\n\r\n    Cloine, curled like the sleepy waters where the moon-waves start,\r\n    Radiant, resplendently she gleams,\r\n    Cloine dreams,\r\n    Lips pressed against my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ESTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\n  _Nine._\r\n\r\nEsther\xe2\x80\x99s hair falls in soft curls about her high-cheek-boned\r\nchalk-white face. Esther\xe2\x80\x99s hair would be beautiful if there were\r\nmore gloss to it. And if her face were not prematurely serious, one\r\nwould call it pretty. Her cheeks are too flat and dead for a girl of\r\nnine. Esther looks like a little white child, starched, frilled, as\r\nshe walks slowly from her home towards her father\xe2\x80\x99s grocery store.\r\nShe is about to turn in Broad from Maple Street. White and black men\r\nloafing on the corner hold no interest for her. Then a strange thing\r\nhappens. A clean-muscled, magnificent, black-skinned Negro, whom she\r\nhad heard her father mention as King Barlo, suddenly drops to his knees\r\non a spot called the Spittoon. White men, unaware of him, continue\r\nsquirting tobacco juice in his direction. The saffron fluid splashes\r\non his face. His smooth black face begins to glisten and to shine.\r\nSoon, people notice him, and gather round. His eyes are rapturous\r\nupon the heavens. Lips and nostrils quiver. Barlo is in a religious\r\ntrance. Town folks know it. They are not startled. They are not afraid.\r\nThey gather round. Some beg boxes from the grocery stores. From old\r\nMcGregor\xe2\x80\x99s notion shop. A coffin-case is pressed into use. Folks line\r\nthe curb-stones. Business men close shop. And Banker Warply parks his\r\ncar close by. Silently, all await the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s voice. The sheriff,\r\na great florid fellow whose leggings never meet around his bulging\r\ncalves, swears in three deputies. \xe2\x80\x9cWall, y cant never tell what a\r\nnigger like King Barlo might be up t.\xe2\x80\x9d Soda bottles, five fingers full\r\nof shine, are passed to those who want them. A couple of stray dogs\r\nstart a fight. Old Goodlow\xe2\x80\x99s cow comes flopping up the street. Barlo,\r\nstill as an Indian fakir, has not moved. The town bell strikes six. The\r\nsun slips in behind a heavy mass of horizon cloud. The crowd is hushed\r\nand expectant. Barlo\xe2\x80\x99s under jaw relaxes, and his lips begin to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus has been awhisperin strange words deep down, O way down deep,\r\ndeep in my ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHums of awe and of excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe called me to His side an said, \xe2\x80\x98Git down on your knees beside me,\r\nson, Ise gwine t whisper in your ears.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old sister cries, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ise agwine t whisper in your ears,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, an I replied, \xe2\x80\x98Thy will\r\nbe done on earth as it is in heaven.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Lord. Amen. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Lord Jesus whispered strange good words deep down, O way down deep,\r\ndeep in my ears. An He said, \xe2\x80\x98Tell em till you feel your throat on\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x99 I saw a vision. I saw a man arise, an he was big an black an\r\npowerful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome one yells, \xe2\x80\x9cPreach it, preacher, preach it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94but his head was caught up in th clouds. An while he was agazin at\r\nth heavens, heart filled up with th Lord, some little white-ant biddies\r\ncame an tied his feet to chains. They led him t th coast, they led him\r\nt th sea, they led him across th ocean an they didnt set him free.\r\nThe old coast didnt miss him, an th new coast wasnt free, he left\r\nthe old-coast brothers, t give birth t you an me. O Lord, great God\r\nAlmighty, t give birth t you an me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarlo pauses. Old gray mothers are in tears. Fragments of melodies\r\nare being hummed. White folks are touched and curiously awed. Off to\r\nthemselves, white and black preachers confer as to how best to rid\r\nthemselves of the vagrant, usurping fellow. Barlo looks as though he is\r\nstruggling to continue. People are hushed. One can hear weevils work.\r\nDusk is falling rapidly, and the customary store lights fail to throw\r\ntheir feeble glow across the gray dust and flagging of the Georgia\r\ntown. Barlo rises to his full height. He is immense. To the people he\r\nassumes the outlines of his visioned African. In a mighty voice he\r\nbellows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers an sisters, turn your faces t th sweet face of the Lord, an\r\nfill your hearts with glory. Open your eyes an see th dawnin of th\r\nmornin light. Open your ears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYears afterwards Esther was told that at that very moment a great,\r\nheavy, rumbling voice actually was heard. That hosts of angels and of\r\ndemons paraded up and down the streets all night. That King Barlo rode\r\nout of town astride a pitch-black bull that had a glowing gold ring\r\nin its nose. And that old Limp Underwood, who hated niggers, woke up\r\nnext morning to find that he held a black man in his arms. This much is\r\ncertain: an inspired Negress, of wide reputation for being sanctified,\r\ndrew a portrait of a black madonna on the court-house wall. And King\r\nBarlo left town. He left his image indelibly upon the mind of Esther.\r\nHe became the starting point of the only living patterns that her mind\r\nwas to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\n  _Sixteen._\r\n\r\nEsther begins to dream. The low evening sun sets the windows of\r\nMcGregor\xe2\x80\x99s notion shop aflame. Esther makes believe that they really\r\nare aflame. The town fire department rushes madly down the road. It\r\nruthlessly shoves black and white idlers to one side. It whoops. It\r\nclangs. It rescues from the second-story window a dimpled infant\r\nwhich she claims for her own. How had she come by it? She thinks of\r\nit immaculately. It is a sin to think of it immaculately. She must\r\ndream no more. She must repent her sin. Another dream comes. There\r\nis no fire department. There are no heroic men. The fire starts. The\r\nloafers on the corner form a circle, chew their tobacco faster, and\r\nsquirt juice just as fast as they can chew. Gallons on top of gallons\r\nthey squirt upon the flames. The air reeks with the stench of scorched\r\ntobacco juice. Women, fat chunky Negro women, lean scrawny white women,\r\npull their skirts up above their heads and display the most ludicrous\r\nunderclothes. The women scoot in all directions from the danger zone.\r\nShe alone is left to take the baby in her arms. But what a baby! Black,\r\nsinged, woolly, tobacco-juice baby\xe2\x80\x94ugly as sin. Once held to her\r\nbreast, miraculous thing: its breath is sweet and its lips can nibble.\r\nShe loves it frantically. Her joy in it changes the town folks\xe2\x80\x99 jeers\r\nto harmless jealousy, and she is left alone.\r\n\r\n  _Twenty-two._\r\n\r\nEsther\xe2\x80\x99s schooling is over. She works behind the counter of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s grocery store. \xe2\x80\x9cTo keep the money in the family,\xe2\x80\x9d so he said.\r\nShe is learning to make distinctions between the business and the\r\nsocial worlds. \xe2\x80\x9cGood business comes from remembering that the white\r\nfolks dont divide the niggers, Esther. Be just as black as any man\r\nwho has a silver dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d Esther listlessly forgets that she is near\r\nwhite, and that her father is the richest colored man in town. Black\r\nfolk who drift in to buy lard and snuff and flour of her, call her a\r\nsweet-natured, accommodating girl. She learns their names. She forgets\r\nthem. She thinks about men. \xe2\x80\x9cI dont appeal to them. I wonder why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe recalls an affair she had with a little fair boy while still in\r\nschool. It had ended in her shame when he as much as told her that for\r\nsweetness he preferred a lollipop. She remembers the salesman from the\r\nNorth who wanted to take her to the movies that first night he was in\r\ntown. She refused, of course. And he never came back, having found out\r\nwho she was. She thinks of Barlo. Barlo\xe2\x80\x99s image gives her a slightly\r\nstale thrill. She spices it by telling herself his glories. Black.\r\nMagnetically so. Best cotton picker in the county, in the state,\r\nin the whole world for that matter. Best man with his fists, best\r\nman with dice, with a razor. Promoter of church benefits. Of colored\r\nfairs. Vagrant preacher. Lover of all the women for miles and miles\r\naround. Esther decides that she loves him. And with a vague sense of\r\nlife slipping by, she resolves that she will tell him so, whatever\r\npeople say, the next time he comes to town. After the making of this\r\nresolution which becomes a sort of wedding cake for her to tuck beneath\r\nher pillow and go to sleep upon, she sees nothing of Barlo for five\r\nyears. Her hair thins. It looks like the dull silk on puny corn ears.\r\nHer face pales until it is the color of the gray dust that dances with\r\ndead cotton leaves..\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\n  _Esther is twenty-seven._\r\n\r\nEsther sells lard and snuff and flour to vague black faces that drift\r\nin her store to ask for them. Her eyes hardly see the people to whom\r\nshe gives change. Her body is lean and beaten. She rests listlessly\r\nagainst the counter, too weary to sit down. From the street some one\r\nshouts, \xe2\x80\x9cKing Barlo has come back to town.\xe2\x80\x9d He passes her window,\r\ndriving a large new car. Cut-out open. He veers to the curb, and steps\r\nout. Barlo has made money on cotton during the war. He is as rich as\r\nanyone. Esther suddenly is animate. She goes to her door. She sees him\r\nat a distance, the center of a group of credulous men. She hears the\r\ndeep-bass rumble of his talk. The sun swings low. McGregor\xe2\x80\x99s windows\r\nare aflame again. Pale flame. A sharply dressed white girl passes by.\r\nFor a moment Esther wishes that she might be like her. Not white; she\r\nhas no need for being that. But sharp, sporty, with get-up about her.\r\nBarlo is connected with that wish. She mustnt wish. Wishes only make\r\nyou restless. Emptiness is a thing that grows by being moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot think. Not wish. Just set my mind against it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the thought\r\ncomes to her that those purposeless, easy-going men will possess him,\r\nif she doesnt. Purpose is not dead in her, now that she comes to think\r\nof it. That loose women will have their arms around him at Nat Bowle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace to-night. As if her veins are full of fired sun-bleached southern\r\nshanties, a swift heat sweeps them. Dead dreams, and a forgotten\r\nresolution are carried upward by the flames. Pale flames. \xe2\x80\x9cThey shant\r\nhave him. Oh, they shall not. Not if it kills me they shant have him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nJerky, aflutter, she closes the store and starts home. Folks lazing\r\non store window-sills wonder what on earth can be the matter with Jim\r\nCrane\xe2\x80\x99s gal, as she passes them. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to remember, she always was a\r\nlittle off, a little crazy, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d Esther seeks her own room, and\r\nlocks the door. Her mind is a pink mesh-bag filled with baby toes.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nUsing the noise of the town clock striking twelve to cover the creaks\r\nof her departure, Esther slips into the quiet road. The town, her\r\nparents, most everyone is sound asleep. This fact is a stable thing\r\nthat comforts her. After sundown a chill wind came up from the west.\r\nIt is still blowing, but to her it is a steady, settled thing like the\r\ncold. She wants her mind to be like that. Solid, contained, and blank\r\nas a sheet of darkened ice. She will not permit herself to notice the\r\npeculiar phosphorescent glitter of the sweet-gum leaves. Their movement\r\nwould excite her. Exciting too, the recession of the dull familiar\r\nhomes she knows so well. She doesnt know them at all. She closes her\r\neyes, and holds them tightly. Wont do. Her being aware that they are\r\nclosed recalls her purpose. She does not want to think of it. She opens\r\nthem. She turns now into the deserted business street. The corrugated\r\niron canopies and mule- and horse-gnawed hitching posts bring her a\r\nstrange composure. Ghosts of the commonplaces of her daily life take\r\nstride with her and become her companions. And the echoes of her heels\r\nupon the flagging are rhythmically monotonous and soothing. Crossing\r\nthe street at the corner of McGregor\xe2\x80\x99s notion shop, she thinks that the\r\nwindows are a dull flame. Only a fancy. She walks faster. Then runs. A\r\nturn into a side street brings her abruptly to Nat Bowle\xe2\x80\x99s place. The\r\nhouse is squat and dark. It is always dark. Barlo is within. Quietly\r\nshe opens the outside door and steps in. She passes through a small\r\nroom. Pauses before a flight of stairs down which people\xe2\x80\x99s voices,\r\nmuffled, come. The air is heavy with fresh tobacco smoke. It makes her\r\nsick. She wants to turn back. She goes up the steps. As if she were\r\nmounting to some great height, her head spins. She is violently dizzy.\r\nBlackness rushes to her eyes. And then she finds that she is in a large\r\nroom. Barlo is before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sholy damned\xe2\x80\x94skuse me, but what, what brought you here, lil\r\nmilk-white gal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice sounds like a frightened child\xe2\x80\x99s that calls homeward\r\nfrom some point miles away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you Barlo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis aint th place fer y. This aint th place fer y.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I know. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe manages to look deep and straight into his eyes. He is slow at\r\nunderstanding. Guffaws and giggles break out from all around the room.\r\nA coarse woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice remarks, \xe2\x80\x9cSo thats how th dictie niggers does\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Laughs. \xe2\x80\x9cMus give em credit fo their gall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsther doesnt hear. Barlo does. His faculties are jogged. She sees a\r\nsmile, ugly and repulsive to her, working upward through thick licker\r\nfumes. Barlo seems hideous. The thought comes suddenly, that conception\r\nwith a drunken man must be a mighty sin. She draws away, frozen. Like\r\na somnambulist she wheels around and walks stiffly to the stairs. Down\r\nthem. Jeers and hoots pelter bluntly upon her back. She steps out.\r\nThere is no air, no street, and the town has completely disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONVERSION\r\n\r\n\r\n    African Guardian of Souls,\r\n    Drunk with rum,\r\n    Feasting on a strange cassava,\r\n    Yielding to new words and a weak palabra\r\n    Of a white-faced sardonic god\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Grins, cries\r\n    Amen,\r\n    Shouts hosanna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PORTRAIT IN GEORGIA\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hair\xe2\x80\x94braided chestnut, coiled like a lyncher\xe2\x80\x99s rope,\r\n    Eyes\xe2\x80\x94fagots,\r\n    Lips\xe2\x80\x94old scars, or the first red blisters,\r\n    Breath\xe2\x80\x94the last sweet scent of cane,\r\n    And her slim body, white as the ash of black flesh after flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BLOOD-BURNING MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nUp from the skeleton stone walls, up from the rotting floor boards\r\nand the solid hand-hewn beams of oak of the pre-war cotton factory,\r\ndusk came. Up from the dusk the full moon came. Glowing like a fired\r\npine-knot, it illumined the great door and soft showered the Negro\r\nshanties aligned along the single street of factory town. The full moon\r\nin the great door was an omen. Negro women improvised songs against its\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nLouisa sang as she came over the crest of the hill from the white\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen. Her skin was the color of oak leaves on young trees\r\nin fall. Her breasts, firm and up-pointed like ripe acorns. And her\r\nsinging had the low murmur of winds in fig trees. Bob Stone, younger\r\nson of the people she worked for, loved her. By the way the world\r\nreckons things, he had won her. By measure of that warm glow which came\r\ninto her mind at thought of him, he had won her. Tom Burwell, whom the\r\nwhole town called Big Boy, also loved her. But working in the fields\r\nall day, and far away from her, gave him no chance to show it. Though\r\noften enough of evenings he had tried to. Somehow, he never got along.\r\nStrong as he was with hands upon the ax or plow, he found it difficult\r\nto hold her. Or so he thought. But the fact was that he held her to\r\nfactory town more firmly than he thought for. His black balanced, and\r\npulled against, the white of Stone, when she thought of them. And her\r\nmind was vaguely upon them as she came over the crest of the hill,\r\ncoming from the white folks\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen. As she sang softly at the evil\r\nface of the full moon.\r\n\r\nA strange stir was in her. Indolently, she tried to fix upon Bob or\r\nTom as the cause of it. To meet Bob in the canebrake, as she was going\r\nto do an hour or so later, was nothing new. And Tom\xe2\x80\x99s proposal which\r\nshe felt on its way to her could be indefinitely put off. Separately,\r\nthere was no unusual significance to either one. But for some reason,\r\nthey jumbled when her eyes gazed vacantly at the rising moon. And from\r\nthe jumble came the stir that was strangely within her. Her lips\r\ntrembled. The slow rhythm of her song grew agitant and restless. Rusty\r\nblack and tan spotted hounds, lying in the dark corners of porches\r\nor prowling around back yards, put their noses in the air and caught\r\nits tremor. They began plaintively to yelp and howl. Chickens woke up\r\nand cackled. Intermittently, all over the countryside dogs barked and\r\nroosters crowed as if heralding a weird dawn or some ungodly awakening.\r\nThe women sang lustily. Their songs were cotton-wads to stop their\r\nears. Louisa came down into factory town and sank wearily upon the step\r\nbefore her home. The moon was rising towards a thick cloud-bank which\r\nsoon would hide it.\r\n\r\n    Red nigger moon. Sinner!\r\n    Blood-burning moon. Sinner!\r\n    Come out that fact\xe2\x80\x99ry door.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nUp from the deep dusk of a cleared spot on the edge of the forest a\r\nmellow glow arose and spread fan-wise into the low-hanging heavens.\r\nAnd all around the air was heavy with the scent of boiling cane. A\r\nlarge pile of cane-stalks lay like ribboned shadows upon the ground. A\r\nmule, harnessed to a pole, trudged lazily round and round the pivot of\r\nthe grinder. Beneath a swaying oil lamp, a Negro alternately whipped\r\nout at the mule, and fed cane-stalks to the grinder. A fat boy waddled\r\npails of fresh ground juice between the grinder and the boiling stove.\r\nSteam came from the copper boiling pan. The scent of cane came from the\r\ncopper pan and drenched the forest and the hill that sloped to factory\r\ntown, beneath its fragrance. It drenched the men in circle seated\r\naround the stove. Some of them chewed at the white pulp of stalks, but\r\nthere was no need for them to, if all they wanted was to taste the\r\ncane. One tasted it in factory town. And from factory town one could\r\nsee the soft haze thrown by the glowing stove upon the low-hanging\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nOld David Georgia stirred the thickening syrup with a long ladle, and\r\never so often drew it off. Old David Georgia tended his stove and told\r\ntales about the white folks, about moonshining and cotton picking,\r\nand about sweet nigger gals, to the men who sat there about his stove\r\nto listen to him. Tom Burwell chewed cane-stalk and laughed with the\r\nothers till someone mentioned Louisa. Till some one said something\r\nabout Louisa and Bob Stone, about the silk stockings she must have\r\ngotten from him. Blood ran up Tom\xe2\x80\x99s neck hotter than the glow that\r\nflooded from the stove. He sprang up. Glared at the men and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my gal.\xe2\x80\x9d Will Manning laughed. Tom strode over to him. Yanked\r\nhim up and knocked him to the ground. Several of Manning\xe2\x80\x99s friends got\r\nup to fight for him. Tom whipped out a long knife and would have cut\r\nthem to shreds if they hadnt ducked into the woods. Tom had had enough.\r\nHe nodded to Old David Georgia and swung down the path to factory town.\r\nJust then, the dogs started barking and the roosters began to crow.\r\nTom felt funny. Away from the fight, away from the stove, chill got\r\nto him. He shivered. He shuddered when he saw the full moon rising\r\ntowards the cloud-bank. He who didnt give a godam for the fears of\r\nold women. He forced his mind to fasten on Louisa. Bob Stone. Better\r\nnot be. He turned into the street and saw Louisa sitting before her\r\nhome. He went towards her, ambling, touched the brim of a marvelously\r\nshaped, spotted, felt hat, said he wanted to say something to her, and\r\nthen found that he didnt know what he had to say, or if he did, that he\r\ncouldnt say it. He shoved his big fists in his overalls, grinned, and\r\nstarted to move off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYouall want me, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThats what us wants, sho, Louisa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn here I is, but that aint ahelpin none, all th same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to say something?..\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did that, sho. But words is like th spots on dice: no matter how y\r\nfumbles em, there\xe2\x80\x99s times when they jes wont come. I dunno why. Seems\r\nlike th love I feels fo yo done stole m tongue.

Ise carried y with me into th fields, day after day, an\r\nafter that, an I sho can plow when yo is there, an I can pick cotton.\r\nYassur! Come near beatin Barlo yesterday. I sho did. Yassur! An next\r\nyear if ole Stone\xe2\x80\x99ll trust me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a farm. My own. My bales will\r\nbuy yo what y gets from white folks now. Silk stockings an purple\r\ndresses\xe2\x80\x94course I dont believe what some folks been whisperin as t how\r\ny gets them things now. White folks always did do for niggers what they\r\nlikes. An they jes cant help alikin yo, Louisa. Bob Stone likes y.\r\nCourse he does. But not th way folks is awhisperin. Does he, hon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dont know what you mean, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse y dont. Ise already cut two niggers. Had t hon, t tell em so.\r\nNiggers always tryin t make somethin out a nothin. An then besides,\r\nwhite folks aint up t them tricks so much nowadays. Godam better not\r\nbe. Leastawise not with yo. Cause I wouldnt stand f it. Nassur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut him jes like I cut a nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Tom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I would an there aint no mo to it. But that aint th talk f now.\r\nSing, honey Louisa, an while I\xe2\x80\x99m listenin t y I\xe2\x80\x99ll be makin love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom took her hand in his. Against the tough thickness of his own, hers\r\nfelt soft and small. His huge body slipped down to the step beside her.\r\nThe full moon sank upward into the deep purple of the cloud-bank. An\r\nold woman brought a lighted lamp and hung it on the common well whose\r\nbulky shadow squatted in the middle of the road, opposite Tom and\r\nLouisa. The old woman lifted the well-lid, took hold the chain, and\r\nbegan drawing up the heavy bucket. As she did so, she sang. Figures\r\nshifted, restless-like, between lamp and window in the front rooms of\r\nthe shanties. Shadows of the figures fought each other on the gray dust\r\nof the road. Figures raised the windows and joined the old woman in\r\nsong. Louisa and Tom, the whole street, singing:\r\n\r\n    Red nigger moon. Sinner!\r\n    Blood-burning moon. Sinner!\r\n    Come out that fact\xe2\x80\x99ry door.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nBob Stone sauntered from his veranda out into the gloom of fir trees\r\nand magnolias. The clear white of his skin paled, and the flush of his\r\ncheeks turned purple. As if to balance this outer change, his mind\r\nbecame consciously a white man\xe2\x80\x99s. He passed the house with its huge\r\nopen hearth which, in the days of slavery, was the plantation cookery.\r\nHe saw Louisa bent over that hearth. He went in as a master should\r\nand took her. Direct, honest, bold. None of this sneaking that he had\r\nto go through now. The contrast was repulsive to him. His family had\r\nlost ground. Hell no, his family still owned the niggers, practically.\r\nDamned if they did, or he wouldnt have to duck around so. What would\r\nthey think if they knew? His mother? His sister? He shouldnt mention\r\nthem, shouldnt think of them in this connection. There in the dusk\r\nhe blushed at doing so. Fellows about town were all right, but how\r\nabout his friends up North? He could see them incredible, repulsed.\r\nThey didnt know. The thought first made him laugh. Then, with their\r\neyes still upon him, he began to feel embarrassed. He felt the need of\r\nexplaining things to them. Explain hell. They wouldnt understand, and\r\nmoreover, who ever heard of a Southerner getting on his knees to any\r\nYankee, or anyone. No sir. He was going to see Louisa to-night, and\r\nlove her. She was lovely\xe2\x80\x94in her way. Nigger way. What way was that?\r\nDamned if he knew. Must know. He\xe2\x80\x99d known her long enough to know. Was\r\nthere something about niggers that you couldnt know? Listening to\r\nthem at church didnt tell you anything. Looking at them didnt tell\r\nyou anything. Talking to them didnt tell you anything\xe2\x80\x94unless it was\r\ngossip, unless they wanted to talk. Of course, about farming, and\r\nlicker, and craps\xe2\x80\x94but those werent nigger. Nigger was something more.\r\nHow much more? Something to be afraid of, more? Hell no. Who ever heard\r\nof being afraid of a nigger? Tom Burwell. Cartwell had told him that\r\nTom went with Louisa after she reached home. No sir. No nigger had ever\r\nbeen with his girl. He\xe2\x80\x99d like to see one try. Some position for him\r\nto be in. Him, Bob Stone, of the old Stone family, in a scrap with a\r\nnigger over a nigger girl. In the good old days... Ha! Those were the\r\ndays. His family had lost ground. Not so much, though. Enough for him\r\nto have to cut through old Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s canefield by way of the woods, that\r\nhe might meet her. She was worth it. Beautiful nigger gal. Why nigger?\r\nWhy not, just gal? No, it was because she was nigger that he went to\r\nher. Sweet... The scent of boiling cane came to him. Then he saw the\r\nrich glow of the stove. He heard the voices of the men circled around\r\nit. He was about to skirt the clearing when he heard his own name\r\nmentioned. He stopped. Quivering. Leaning against a tree, he listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad nigger. Yassur, he sho is one bad nigger when he gets started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Burwell\xe2\x80\x99s been on th gang three times fo cuttin men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat y think he\xe2\x80\x99s agwine t do t Bob Stone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno yet. He aint found out. When he does\xe2\x80\x94 Baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAint no tellin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Stone aint no quitter an I ken tell y that. Blood of th old uns\r\nin his veins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThats right. He\xe2\x80\x99ll scrap, sho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe gettin too hot f niggers round this away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, nigger. Y dont know what y talkin bout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob Stone\xe2\x80\x99s ears burned as though he had been holding them over the\r\nstove. Sizzling heat welled up within him. His feet felt as if they\r\nrested on red-hot coals. They stung him to quick movement. He circled\r\nthe fringe of the glowing. Not a twig cracked beneath his feet. He\r\nreached the path that led to factory town. Plunged furiously down it.\r\nHalfway along, a blindness within him veered him aside. He crashed into\r\nthe bordering canebrake. Cane leaves cut his face and lips. He tasted\r\nblood. He threw himself down and dug his fingers in the ground. The\r\nearth was cool. Cane-roots took the fever from his hands. After a long\r\nwhile, or so it seemed to him, the thought came to him that it must\r\nbe time to see Louisa. He got to his feet and walked calmly to their\r\nmeeting place. No Louisa. Tom Burwell had her. Veins in his forehead\r\nbulged and distended. Saliva moistened the dried blood on his lips. He\r\nbit down on his lips. He tasted blood. Not his own blood; Tom Burwell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood. Bob drove through the cane and out again upon the road. A hound\r\nswung down the path before him towards factory town. Bob couldnt see\r\nit. The dog loped aside to let him pass. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s blind rushing made him\r\nstumble over it. He fell with a thud that dazed him. The hound yelped.\r\nAnswering yelps came from all over the countryside. Chickens cackled.\r\nRoosters crowed, heralding the bloodshot eyes of southern awakening.\r\nSingers in the town were silenced. They shut their windows down.\r\nPalpitant between the rooster crows, a chill hush settled upon the\r\nhuddled forms of Tom and Louisa. A figure rushed from the shadow and\r\nstood before them. Tom popped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhats y want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Bob Stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassur\xe2\x80\x94an I\xe2\x80\x99m Tom Burwell. Whats y want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob lunged at him. Tom side-stepped, caught him by the shoulder, and\r\nflung him to the ground. Straddled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassur\xe2\x80\x94but watch yo doins, Bob Stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few dark figures, drawn by the sound of scuffle stood about them. Bob\r\nsprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFight like a man, Tom Burwell, an I\xe2\x80\x99ll lick y.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he lunged. Tom side-stepped and flung him to the ground.\r\nStraddled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet off me, you godam nigger you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo sho has started somethin now. Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom yanked him up and began hammering at him. Each blow sounded as if\r\nit smashed into a precious, irreplaceable soft something. Beneath them,\r\nBob staggered back. He reached in his pocket and whipped out a knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThats my game, sho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlue flash, a steel blade slashed across Bob Stone\xe2\x80\x99s throat. He had\r\na sweetish sick feeling. Blood began to flow. Then he felt a sharp\r\ntwitch of pain. He let his knife drop. He slapped one hand against his\r\nneck. He pressed the other on top of his head as if to hold it down.\r\nHe groaned. He turned, and staggered towards the crest of the hill in\r\nthe direction of white town. Negroes who had seen the fight slunk into\r\ntheir homes and blew the lamps out. Louisa, dazed, hysterical, refused\r\nto go indoors. She slipped, crumbled, her body loosely propped against\r\nthe woodwork of the well. Tom Burwell leaned against it. He seemed\r\nrooted there.\r\n\r\nBob reached Broad Street. White men rushed up to him. He collapsed in\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Burwell....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite men like ants upon a forage rushed about. Except for the taut hum\r\nof their moving, all was silent. Shotguns, revolvers, rope, kerosene,\r\ntorches. Two high-powered cars with glaring search-lights. They came\r\ntogether. The taut hum rose to a low roar. Then nothing could be heard\r\nbut the flop of their feet in the thick dust of the road. The moving\r\nbody of their silence preceded them over the crest of the hill into\r\nfactory town. It flattened the Negroes beneath it. It rolled to the\r\nwall of the factory, where it stopped. Tom knew that they were coming.\r\nHe couldnt move. And then he saw the search-lights of the two cars\r\nglaring down on him. A quick shock went through him. He stiffened. He\r\nstarted to run. A yell went up from the mob. Tom wheeled about and\r\nfaced them. They poured down on him. They swarmed. A large man with\r\ndead-white face and flabby cheeks came to him and almost jabbed a\r\ngun-barrel through his guts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHands behind y, nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s wrist were bound. The big man shoved him to the well. Burn him\r\nover it, and when the woodwork caved in, his body would drop to the\r\nbottom. Two deaths for a godam nigger. Louisa was driven back. The mob\r\npushed in. Its pressure, its momentum was too great. Drag him to the\r\nfactory. Wood and stakes already there. Tom moved in the direction\r\nindicated. But they had to drag him. They reached the great door. Too\r\nmany to get in there. The mob divided and flowed around the walls to\r\neither side. The big man shoved him through the door. The mob pressed\r\nin from the sides. Taut humming. No words. A stake was sunk into the\r\nground. Rotting floor boards piled around it. Kerosene poured on the\r\nrotting floor boards. Tom bound to the stake. His breast was bare.\r\nNails scratches let little lines of blood trickle down and mat into\r\nthe hair. His face, his eyes were set and stony. Except for irregular\r\nbreathing, one would have thought him already dead. Torches were flung\r\nonto the pile. A great flare muffled in black smoke shot upward. The\r\nmob yelled. The mob was silent. Now Tom could be seen within the\r\nflames. Only his head, erect, lean, like a blackened stone. Stench\r\nof burning flesh soaked the air. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes popped. His head settled\r\ndownward. The mob yelled. Its yell echoed against the skeleton stone\r\nwalls and sounded like a hundred yells. Like a hundred mobs yelling.\r\nIts yell thudded against the thick front wall and fell back. Ghost of a\r\nyell slipped through the flames and out the great door of the factory.\r\nIt fluttered like a dying thing down the single street of factory town.\r\nLouisa, upon the step before her home, did not hear it, but her eyes\r\nopened slowly. They saw the full moon glowing in the great door. The\r\nfull moon, an evil thing, an omen, soft showering the homes of folks\r\nshe knew. Where were they, these people? She\xe2\x80\x99d sing, and perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome out and join her. Perhaps Tom Burwell would come. At any rate, the\r\nfull moon in the great door was an omen which she must sing to:\r\n\r\n    Red nigger moon. Sinner!\r\n    Blood-burning moon. Sinner!\r\n    Come out that fact\xe2\x80\x99ry door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SEVENTH STREET\r\n\r\n    Money burns the pocket, pocket hurts,\r\n    Bootleggers in silken shirts,\r\n    Ballooned, zooming Cadillacs,\r\n    Whizzing, whizzing down the street-car tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventh Street is a bastard of Prohibition and the War. A crude-boned,\r\nsoft-skinned wedge of nigger life breathing its loafer air, jazz\r\nsongs and love, thrusting unconscious rhythms, black reddish blood\r\ninto the white and whitewashed wood of Washington. Stale soggy wood\r\nof Washington. Wedges rust in soggy wood... Split it! In two! Again!\r\nShred it! .. the sun. Wedges are brilliant in the sun; ribbons of wet\r\nwood dry and blow away. Black reddish blood. Pouring for crude-boned\r\nsoft-skinned life, who set you flowing? Blood suckers of the War would\r\nspin in a frenzy of dizziness if they drank your blood. Prohibition\r\nwould put a stop to it. Who set you flowing? White and whitewash\r\ndisappear in blood. Who set you flowing? Flowing down the smooth\r\nasphalt of Seventh Street, in shanties, brick office buildings,\r\ntheaters, drug stores, restaurants, and cabarets? Eddying on the\r\ncorners? Swirling like a blood-red smoke up where the buzzards fly in\r\nheaven? God would not dare to suck black red blood. A Nigger God! He\r\nwould duck his head in shame and call for the Judgment Day. Who set you\r\nflowing?\r\n\r\n    Money burns the pocket, pocket hurts,\r\n    Bootleggers in silken shirts,\r\n    Ballooned, zooming Cadillacs,\r\n    Whizzing, whizzing down the street-car tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RHOBERT\r\n\r\n\r\nRhobert wears a house, like a monstrous diver\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, on his head.\r\nHis legs are banty-bowed and shaky because as a child he had rickets.\r\nHe is way down. Rods of the house like antenn\xc3\xa6 of a dead thing,\r\nstuffed, prop up in the air. He is way down. He is sinking. His house\r\nis a dead thing that weights him down. He is sinking as a diver would\r\nsink in mud should the water be drawn off. Life is a murky, wiggling,\r\nmicroscopic water that compresses him. Compresses his helmet and would\r\ncrush it the minute that he pulled his head out. He has to keep it in.\r\nLife is water that is being drawn off.\r\n\r\n    Brother, life is water that is being drawn off.\r\n    Brother, life is water that is being drawn off.\r\n\r\nThe dead house is stuffed. The stuffing is alive. It is sinful to draw\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s head out of live stuffing in a dead house. The propped-up antenn\xc3\xa6\r\nwould cave in and the stuffing be strewn .. shredded life-pulp .. in\r\nthe water. It is sinful to have one\xe2\x80\x99s own head crushed. Rhobert is an\r\nupright man whose legs are banty-bowed and shaky because as a child\r\nhe had rickets. The earth is round. Heaven is a sphere that surrounds\r\nit. Sink where you will. God is a Red Cross man with a dredge and a\r\nrespiration-pump who\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for you at the opposite periphery. God\r\nbuilt the house. He blew His breath into its stuffing. It is good to\r\ndie obeying Him who can do these things.\r\n\r\nA futile something like the dead house wraps the live stuffing of the\r\nquestion: how long before the water will be drawn off? Rhobert does not\r\ncare. Like most men who wear monstrous helmets, the pressure it exerts\r\nis enough to convince him of its practical infinity. And he cares not\r\ntwo straws as to whether or not he will ever see his wife and children\r\nagain. Many a time he\xe2\x80\x99s seen them drown in his dreams and has kicked\r\nabout joyously in the mud for days after. One thing about him goes\r\nstraight to the heart. He has an Adam\xe2\x80\x99s-apple which strains sometimes\r\nas if he were painfully gulping great globules of air .. air floating\r\nshredded life-pulp. It is a sad thing to see a banty-bowed, shaky,\r\nricket-legged man straining the raw insides of his throat against\r\nsmooth air. Holding furtive thoughts about the glory of pulp-heads\r\nstrewn in water.. He is way down. Down. Mud, coming to his banty\r\nknees, almost hides them. Soon people will be looking at him and\r\ncalling him a strong man. No doubt he is for one who has had rickets.\r\nLets give it to him. Lets call him great when the water shall have been\r\nall drawn off. Lets build a monument and set it in the ooze where he\r\ngoes down. A monument of hewn oak, carved in nigger-heads. Lets open\r\nour throats, brother, and sing \xe2\x80\x9cDeep River\xe2\x80\x9d when he goes down.\r\n\r\n    Brother, Rhobert is sinking.\r\n    Lets open our throats, brother,\r\n    Lets sing Deep River when he goes down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 AVEY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long while she was nothing more to me than one of those skirted\r\nbeings whom boys at a certain age disdain to play with. Just how I\r\ncame to love her, timidly, and with secret blushes, I do not know.\r\nBut that I did was brought home to me one night, the first night that\r\nNed wore his long pants. Us fellers were seated on the curb before an\r\napartment house where she had gone in. The young trees had not outgrown\r\ntheir boxes then. V Street was lined with them. When our legs grew\r\ncramped and stiff from the cold of the stone, we\xe2\x80\x99d stand around a box\r\nand whittle it. I like to think now that there was a hidden purpose in\r\nthe way we hacked them with our knives. I like to feel that something\r\ndeep in me responded to the trees, the young trees that whinnied like\r\ncolts impatient to be let free... On the particular night I have in\r\nmind, we were waiting for the top-floor light to go out. We wanted to\r\nsee Avey leave the flat. This night she stayed longer than usual and\r\ngave us a chance to complete the plans of how we were going to stone\r\nand beat that feller on the top floor out of town. Ned especially had\r\nit in for him. He was about to throw a brick up at the window when at\r\nlast the room went dark. Some minutes passed. Then Avey, as unconcerned\r\nas if she had been paying an old-maid aunt a visit, came out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember what she had on, and all that sort of thing. But I do know\r\nthat I turned hot as bare pavements in the summertime at Ned\xe2\x80\x99s boast:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell, bet I could get her too if you little niggers weren\xe2\x80\x99t always\r\nspying and crabbing everything.\xe2\x80\x9d I didnt say a word to him. It wasnt\r\nmy way then. I just stood there like the others, and something like\r\na fuse burned up inside of me. She never noticed us, but swung along\r\nlazy and easy as anything. We sauntered to the corner and watched her\r\ntill her door banged to. Ned repeated what he\xe2\x80\x99d said. I didnt seem\r\nto care. Sitting around old Mush-Head\xe2\x80\x99s bread box, the discussion\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cHang if I can see how she gets away with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Doc started.\r\nNed knew, of course. There was nothing he didnt know when it came to\r\nwomen. He dilated on the emotional needs of girls. Said they werent\r\nmuch different from men in that respect. And concluded with the solemn\r\navowal: \xe2\x80\x9cIt does em good.\xe2\x80\x9d None of us liked Ned much. We all talked\r\ndirt; but it was the way he said it. And then too, a couple of the\r\nfellers had sisters and had caught Ned playing with them. But there was\r\nno disputing the superiority of his smutty wisdom. Bubs Sanborn, whose\r\nmother was friendly with Avey\xe2\x80\x99s, had overheard the old ladies talking.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvey\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s ont her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. We thought that only natural and\r\nbegan to guess at what would happen. Some one said she\xe2\x80\x99d marry that\r\nfeller on the top floor. Ned called that a lie because Avey was going\r\nto marry nobody but him. We had our doubts about that, but we did agree\r\nthat she\xe2\x80\x99d soon leave school and marry some one. The gang broke up, and\r\nI went home, picturing myself as married.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nNothing I did seemed able to change Avey\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to me. I played\r\nbasket-ball, and when I\xe2\x80\x99d make a long clean shot she\xe2\x80\x99d clap with the\r\nothers, louder than they, I thought. I\xe2\x80\x99d meet her on the street, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be no difference in the way she said hello. She never took the\r\ntrouble to call me by my name. On the days for drill, I\xe2\x80\x99d let my voice\r\ndown a tone and call for a complicated maneuver when I saw her coming.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d smile appreciation, but it was an impersonal smile, never for me.\r\nIt was on a summer excursion down to Riverview that she first seemed to\r\ntake me into account. The day had been spent riding merry-go-rounds,\r\nscenic-railways, and shoot-the-chutes. We had been in swimming and we\r\nhad danced. I was a crack swimmer then. She didnt know how. I held her\r\nup and showed her how to kick her legs and draw her arms. Of course\r\nshe didnt learn in one day, but she thanked me for bothering with her.\r\nI was also somewhat of a dancer. And I had already noticed that love\r\ncan start on a dance floor. We danced. But though I held her tightly\r\nin my arms, she was way away. That college feller who lived on the top\r\nfloor was somewhere making money for the next year. I imagined that\r\nshe was thinking, wishing for him. Ned was along. He treated her until\r\nhis money gave out. She went with another feller. Ned got sore. One\r\nby one the boys\xe2\x80\x99 money gave out. She left them. And they got sore.\r\nEvery one of them but me got sore. This is the reason, I guess, why I\r\nhad her to myself on the top deck of the _Jane Mosely_ that night as\r\nwe puffed up the Potomac, coming home. The moon was brilliant. The air\r\nwas sweet like clover. And every now and then, a salt tang, a stale\r\ndrift of sea-weed. It was not my mind\xe2\x80\x99s fault if it went romancing. I\r\nshould have taken her in my arms the minute we were stowed in that old\r\nlifeboat. I dallied, dreaming. She took me in hers. And I could feel by\r\nthe touch of it that it wasnt a man-to-woman love. It made me restless.\r\nI felt chagrined. I didnt know what it was, but I did know that I\r\ncouldnt handle it. She ran her fingers through my hair and kissed\r\nmy forehead. I itched to break through her tenderness to passion.\r\nI wanted her to take me in her arms as I knew she had that college\r\nfeller. I wanted her to love me passionately as she did him. I gave her\r\none burning kiss. Then she laid me in her lap as if I were a child.\r\nHelpless. I got sore when she started to hum a lullaby. She wouldnt\r\nlet me go. I talked. I knew damned well that I could beat her at that.\r\nHer eyes were soft and misty, the curves of her lips were wistful, and\r\nher smile seemed indulgent of the irrelevance of my remarks. I gave up\r\nat last and let her love me, silently, in her own way. The moon was\r\nbrilliant. The air was sweet like clover, and every now and then, a\r\nsalt tang, a stale drift of sea-weed....\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nThe next time I came close to her was the following summer at Harpers\r\nFerry. We were sitting on a flat projecting rock they give the name of\r\nLover\xe2\x80\x99s Leap. Some one is supposed to have jumped off it. The river is\r\nabout six hundred feet beneath. A railroad track runs up the valley and\r\ncurves out of sight where part of the mountain rock had to be blasted\r\naway to make room for it. The engines of this valley have a whistle,\r\nthe echoes of which sound like iterated gasps and sobs. I always think\r\nof them as crude music from the soul of Avey. We sat there holding\r\nhands. Our palms were soft and warm against each other. Our fingers\r\nwere not tight. She would not let them be. She would not let me twist\r\nthem. I wanted to talk. To explain what I meant to her. Avey was as\r\nsilent as those great trees whose tops we looked down upon. She has\r\nalways been like that. At least, to me. I had the notion that if I\r\nreally wanted to, I could do with her just what I pleased. Like one\r\ncan strip a tree. I did kiss her. I even let my hands cup her breasts.\r\nWhen I was through, she\xe2\x80\x99d seek my hand and hold it till my pulse cooled\r\ndown. Evening after evening we sat there. I tried to get her to talk\r\nabout that college feller. She never would. There was no set time to go\r\nhome. None of my family had come down. And as for hers, she didnt give\r\na hang about them. The general gossips could hardly say more than they\r\nhad. The boarding-house porch was always deserted when we returned. No\r\none saw us enter, so the time was set conveniently for scandal. This\r\nworried me a little, for I thought it might keep Avey from getting an\r\nappointment in the schools. She didnt care. She had finished normal\r\nschool. They could give her a job if they wanted to. As time went on,\r\nher indifference to things began to pique me; I was ambitious. I left\r\nthe Ferry earlier than she did. I was going off to college. The more\r\nI thought of it, the more I resented, yes, hell, thats what it was,\r\nher downright laziness. Sloppy indolence. There was no excuse for a\r\nhealthy girl taking life so easy. Hell! she was no better than a cow.\r\nI was certain that she was a cow when I felt an udder in a Wisconsin\r\nstock-judging class. Among those energetic Swedes, or whatever they\r\nare, I decided to forget her. For two years I thought I did. When I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome home for the summer she\xe2\x80\x99d be away. And before she returned, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe gone. We never wrote; she was too damned lazy for that. But what a\r\nbluff I put up about forgetting her. The girls up that way, at least\r\nthe ones I knew, havent got the stuff: they dont know how to love.\r\nGiving themselves completely was tame beside just the holding of Avey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. One day I received a note from her. The writing, I decided, was\r\nslovenly. She wrote on a torn bit of note-book paper. The envelope had\r\na faint perfume that I remembered. A single line told me she had lost\r\nher school and was going away. I comforted myself with the reflection\r\nthat shame held no pain for one so indolent as she. Nevertheless, I\r\nleft Wisconsin that year for good. Washington had seemingly forgotten\r\nher. I hunted Ned. Between curses, I caught his opinion of her. She\r\nwas no better than a whore. I saw her mother on the street. The same\r\nold pinch-beck, jerky-gaited creature that I\xe2\x80\x99d always known.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nPerhaps five years passed. The business of hunting a job or something\r\nor other had bruised my vanity so that I could recognize it. I felt\r\nold. Avey and my real relation to her, I thought I came to know. I\r\nwanted to see her. I had been told that she was in New York. As I had\r\nno money, I hiked and bummed my way there. I got work in a ship-yard\r\nand walked the streets at night, hoping to meet her. Failing in this,\r\nI saved enough to pay my fare back home. One evening in early June,\r\njust at the time when dusk is most lovely on the eastern horizon, I saw\r\nAvey, indolent as ever, leaning on the arm of a man, strolling under\r\nthe recently lit arc-lights of U Street. She had almost passed before\r\nshe recognized me. She showed no surprise. The puff over her eyes\r\nhad grown heavier. The eyes themselves were still sleepy-large, and\r\nbeautiful. I had almost concluded\xe2\x80\x94indifferent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look older,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nwhat she said. I wanted to convince her that I was, so I asked her to\r\nwalk with me. The man whom she was with, and whom she never took the\r\ntrouble to introduce, at a nod from her, hailed a taxi, and drove away.\r\nThat gave me a notion of what she had been used to. Her dress was of\r\nsome fine, costly stuff. I suggested the park, and then added that the\r\ngrass might stain her skirt. Let it get stained, she said, for where it\r\ncame from there are others.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nI have a spot in Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Home to which I always go when I want the\r\nsimple beauty of another\xe2\x80\x99s soul. Robins spring about the lawn all\r\nday. They leave their footprints in the grass. I imagine that the\r\ngrass at night smells sweet and fresh because of them. The ground is\r\nhigh. Washington lies below. Its light spreads like a blush against\r\nthe darkened sky. Against the soft dusk sky of Washington. And when\r\nthe wind is from the South, soil of my homeland falls like a fertile\r\nshower upon the lean streets of the city. Upon my hill in Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHome. I know the policeman who watches the place of nights. When I go\r\nthere alone, I talk to him. I tell him I come there to find the truth\r\nthat people bury in their hearts. I tell him that I do not come there\r\nwith a girl to do the thing he\xe2\x80\x99s paid to watch out for. I look deep\r\nin his eyes when I say these things, and he believes me. He comes\r\nover to see who it is on the grass. I say hello to him. He greets me\r\nin the same way and goes off searching for other black splotches upon\r\nthe lawn. Avey and I went there. A band in one of the buildings a fair\r\ndistance off was playing a march. I wished they would stop. Their\r\nplaying was like a tin spoon in one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. I wanted the Howard Glee\r\nClub to sing \xe2\x80\x9cDeep River,\xe2\x80\x9d from the road. To sing \xe2\x80\x9cDeep River, Deep\r\nRiver,\xe2\x80\x9d from the road... Other than the first comments, Avey had been\r\nsilent. I started to hum a folk-tune. She slipped her hand in mine.\r\nPillowed her head as best she could upon my arm. Kissed the hand that\r\nshe was holding and listened, or so I thought, to what I had to say. I\r\ntraced my development from the early days up to the present time, the\r\nphase in which I could understand her. I described her own nature and\r\ntemperament. Told how they needed a larger life for their expression.\r\nHow incapable Washington was of understanding that need. How it\r\ncould not meet it. I pointed out that in lieu of proper channels, her\r\nemotions had overflowed into paths that dissipated them. I talked,\r\nbeautifully I thought, about an art that would be born, an art that\r\nwould open the way for women the likes of her. I asked her to hope, and\r\nbuild up an inner life against the coming of that day. I recited some\r\nof my own things to her. I sang, with a strange quiver in my voice,\r\na promise-song. And then I began to wonder why her hand had not once\r\nreturned a single pressure. My old-time feeling about her laziness came\r\nback. I spoke sharply. My policeman friend passed by. I said hello to\r\nhim. As he went away, I began to visualize certain possibilities. An\r\nimmediate and urgent passion swept over me. Then I looked at Avey.\r\nHer heavy eyes were closed. Her breathing was as faint and regular as\r\na child\xe2\x80\x99s in slumber. My passion died. I was afraid to move lest I\r\ndisturb her. Hours and hours, I guess it was, she lay there. My body\r\ngrew numb. I shivered. I coughed. I wanted to get up and whittle at\r\nthe boxes of young trees. I withdrew my hand. I raised her head to\r\nwaken her. She did not stir. I got up and walked around. I found my\r\npoliceman friend and talked to him. We both came up, and bent over her.\r\nHe said it would be all right for her to stay there just so long as she\r\ngot away before the workmen came at dawn. A blanket was borrowed from\r\na neighbor house. I sat beside her through the night. I saw the dawn\r\nsteal over Washington. The Capitol dome looked like a gray ghost ship\r\ndrifting in from sea. Avey\xe2\x80\x99s face was pale, and her eyes were heavy.\r\nShe did not have the gray crimson-splashed beauty of the dawn. I hated\r\nto wake her. Orphan-woman...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BEEHIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Within this black hive to-night\r\n    There swarm a million bees;\r\n    Bees passing in and out the moon,\r\n    Bees escaping out the moon,\r\n    Bees returning through the moon,\r\n    Silver bees intently buzzing,\r\n    Silver honey dripping from the swarm of bees\r\n    Earth is a waxen cell of the world comb,\r\n    And I, a drone,\r\n    Lying on my back,\r\n    Lipping honey,\r\n    Getting drunk with silver honey,\r\n    Wish that I might fly out past the moon\r\n    And curl forever in some far-off farmyard flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             STORM ENDING\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads,\r\n    Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,\r\n    Rumbling in the wind,\r\n    Stretching clappers to strike our ears ..\r\n    Full-lipped flowers\r\n    Bitten by the sun\r\n    Bleeding rain\r\n    Dripping rain like golden honey\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    And the sweet earth flying from the thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THEATER\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of nigger alleys, of pool rooms and restaurants and near-beer\r\nsaloons soaks into the walls of Howard Theater and sets them throbbing\r\njazz songs. Black-skinned, they dance and shout above the tick and\r\ntrill of white-walled buildings. At night, they open doors to people\r\nwho come in to stamp their feet and shout. At night, road-shows volley\r\nsongs into the mass-heart of black people. Songs soak the walls and\r\nseep out to the nigger life of alleys and near-beer saloons, of the\r\nPoodle Dog and Black Bear cabarets. Afternoons, the house is dark, and\r\nthe walls are sleeping singers until rehearsal begins. Or until John\r\ncomes within them. Then they start throbbing to a subtle syncopation.\r\nAnd the space-dark air grows softly luminous.\r\n\r\nJohn is the manager\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He is seated at the center of the\r\ntheater, just before rehearsal. Light streaks down upon him from a\r\nwindow high above. One half his face is orange in it. One half his\r\nface is in shadow. The soft glow of the house rushes to, and compacts\r\nabout, the shaft of light. John\xe2\x80\x99s mind coincides with the shaft of\r\nlight. Thoughts rush to, and compact about it. Life of the house and of\r\nthe slowly awakening stage swirls to the body of John, and thrills it.\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s body is separate from the thoughts that pack his mind.\r\n\r\nStage-lights, soft, as if they shine through clear pink fingers.\r\nBeneath them, hid by the shadow of a set, Dorris. Other chorus girls\r\ndrift in. John feels them in the mass. And as if his own body were the\r\nmass-heart of a black audience listening to them singing, he wants\r\nto stamp his feet and shout. His mind, contained above desires of\r\nhis body, singles the girls out, and tries to trace origins and plot\r\ndestinies.\r\n\r\nA pianist slips into the pit and improvises jazz. The walls awake. Arms\r\nof the girls, and their limbs, which .. jazz, jazz .. by lifting up\r\ntheir tight street skirts they set free, jab the air and clog the floor\r\nin rhythm to the music. (Lift your skirts, Baby, and talk t papa!)\r\nCrude, individualized, and yet .. monotonous...\r\n\r\nJohn: Soon the director will herd you, my full-lipped, distant\r\nbeauties, and tame you, and blunt your sharp thrusts in loosely\r\nsuggestive movements, appropriate to Broadway. (O dance!) Soon the\r\naudience will paint your dusk faces white, and call you beautiful. (O\r\ndance!) Soon I... (O dance!) I\xe2\x80\x99d like...\r\n\r\nGirls laugh and shout. Sing discordant snatches of other jazz songs.\r\nWhirl with loose passion into the arms of passing show-men.\r\n\r\nJohn: Too thick. Too easy. Too monotonous. Her whom I\xe2\x80\x99d love I\xe2\x80\x99d leave\r\nbefore she knew that I was with her. Her? Which? (O dance!) I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto...\r\n\r\nGirls dance and sing. Men clap. The walls sing and press inward. They\r\npress the men and girls, they press John towards a center of physical\r\necstasy. Go to it, Baby! Fan yourself, and feed your papa! Put ..\r\nnobody lied .. and take .. when they said I cried over you. No lie!\r\nThe glitter and color of stacked scenes, the gilt and brass and crimson\r\nof the house, converge towards a center of physical ecstasy. John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet and torso and his blood press in. He wills thought to rid his mind\r\nof passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, girls. Alaska. Miss Reynolds, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe director wants to get the rehearsal through with.\r\n\r\nThe girls line up. John sees the front row: dancing ponies. The rest\r\nare in shadow. The leading lady fits loosely in the front. Lack-life,\r\nmonotonous. \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Music starts. The song is somewhere\r\nwhere it will not strain the leading lady\xe2\x80\x99s throat. The dance is\r\nsomewhere where it will not strain the girls. Above the staleness,\r\none dancer throws herself into it. Dorris. John sees her. Her\r\nhair, crisp-curled, is bobbed. Bushy, black hair bobbing about her\r\nlemon-colored face. Her lips are curiously full, and very red. Her\r\nlimbs in silk purple stockings are lovely. John feels them. Desires\r\nher. Holds off.\r\n\r\nJohn: Stage-door johnny; chorus-girl. No, that would be all right.\r\nDictie, educated, stuck-up; show-girl. Yep. Her suspicion would be\r\nstronger than her passion. It wouldnt work. Keep her loveliness. Let\r\nher go.\r\n\r\nDorris sees John and knows that he is looking at her. Her own glowing\r\nis too rich a thing to let her feel the slimness of his diluted\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks her dancing partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh manager\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Dictie. Nothin doin, hon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorris tosses her head and dances for him until she feels she has him.\r\nThen, withdrawing disdainfully, she flirts with the director.\r\n\r\nDorris: Nothin doin? How come? Aint I as good as him? Couldnt I have\r\ngot an education if I\xe2\x80\x99d wanted one? Dont I know respectable folks, lots\r\nof em, in Philadelphia and New York and Chicago? Aint I had men as good\r\nas him? Better. Doctors an lawyers. Whats a manager\xe2\x80\x99s brother, anyhow?\r\n\r\nTwo steps back, and two steps front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Mame, where do you get that stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatshmean, Dorris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you two girls cant listen to what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, I know where I\r\ncan get some who can. Now listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMame: Go to hell, you black bastard.\r\n\r\nDorris: Whats eatin at him, anyway?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow follow me in this, you girls. Its three counts to the right,\r\nthree counts to the left, and then you shimmy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn: \xe2\x80\x94and then you shimmy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet she can. Some good cabaret, with\r\nrooms upstairs. And what in hell do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d get from it? Youre\r\ngoing wrong. Here\xe2\x80\x99s right: get her to herself\xe2\x80\x94(Christ, but how she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbore you after the first five minutes)\xe2\x80\x94not if you get her right she\r\nwouldnt. Touch her, I mean. To herself\xe2\x80\x94in some room perhaps. Some\r\ncheap, dingy bedroom. Hell no. Cant be done. But the point is, brother\r\nJohn, it can be done. Get her to herself somewhere, anywhere. Go down\r\nin yourself\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99d be calling you all sorts of asses while you were\r\nin the process of going down. Hold em, bud. Cant be done. Let her go.\r\n(Dance and I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you!) And keep her loveliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right now, Chicken Chaser. Dorris and girls. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Dorris? I\r\ntold you to stay on the stage, didnt I? Well? Now thats enough. All\r\nright. All right there, Professor? All right. One, two, three\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorris swings to the front. The line of girls, four deep, blurs within\r\nthe shadow of suspended scenes. Dorris wants to dance. The director\r\nfeels that and steps to one side. He smiles, and picks her for a\r\nleading lady, one of these days. Odd ends of stage-men emerge from the\r\nwings, and stare and clap. A crap game in the alley suddenly ends.\r\nBlack faces crowd the rear stage doors. The girls, catching joy from\r\nDorris, whip up within the footlights\xe2\x80\x99 glow. They forget set steps;\r\nthey find their own. The director forgets to bawl them out. Dorris\r\ndances.\r\n\r\nJohn: Her head bobs to Broadway. Dance from yourself. Dance! O just a\r\nlittle more.\r\n\r\nDorris\xe2\x80\x99 eyes burn across the space of seats to him.\r\n\r\nDorris: I bet he can love. Hell, he cant love. He\xe2\x80\x99s too skinny. His\r\nlips are too skinny. He wouldnt love me anyway, only for that. But I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nget a pair of silk stockings out of it. Red silk. I got purple. Cut\r\nit, kid. You cant win him to respect you that away. He wouldnt anyway.\r\nMaybe he would. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99d love. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard em say that men who look\r\nlike him (what does he look like?) will marry if they love. O will you\r\nlove me? And give me kids, and a home, and everything? (I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nmake your nest, and honest, hon, I wouldnt run out on you.) You will if\r\nI make you. Just watch me.\r\n\r\nDorris dances. She forgets her tricks. She dances.\r\n\r\nGlorious songs are the muscles of her limbs.\r\n\r\nAnd her singing is of canebrake loves and mangrove feastings.\r\n\r\nThe walls press in, singing. Flesh of a throbbing body, they press\r\nclose to John and Dorris. They close them in. John\xe2\x80\x99s heart beats\r\ntensely against her dancing body. Walls press his mind within his\r\nheart. And then, the shaft of light goes out the window high above him.\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s mind sweeps up to follow it. Mind pulls him upward into dream.\r\nDorris dances...\r\nJohn dreams:\r\n\r\n  Dorris is dressed in a loose black gown splashed with lemon\r\n  ribbons. Her feet taper long and slim from trim ankles. She\r\n  waits for him just inside the stage door. John, collar and tie\r\n  colorful and flaring, walks towards the stage door. There are\r\n  no trees in the alley. But his feet feel as though they step\r\n  on autumn leaves whose rustle has been pressed out of them by\r\n  the passing of a million satin slippers. The air is sweet with\r\n  roasting chestnuts, sweet with bonfires of old leaves. John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n  melancholy is a deep thing that seals all senses but his eyes,\r\n  and makes him whole.\r\n\r\n  Dorris knows that he is coming. Just at the right moment she\r\n  steps from the door, as if there were no door. Her face is\r\n  tinted like the autumn alley. Of old flowers, or of a southern\r\n  canefield, her perfume. \xe2\x80\x9cGlorious Dorris.\xe2\x80\x9d So his eyes speak.\r\n  And their sadness is too deep for sweet untruth. She barely\r\n  touches his arm. They glide off with footfalls softened on the\r\n  leaves, the old leaves powdered by a million satin slippers.\r\n\r\n  They are in a room. John knows nothing of it. Only, that the\r\n  flesh and blood of Dorris are its walls. Singing walls. Lights,\r\n  soft, as if they shine through clear pink fingers. Soft lights,\r\n  and warm.\r\n\r\n  John reaches for a manuscript of his, and reads. Dorris, who\r\n  has no eyes, has eyes to understand him. He comes to a dancing\r\n  scene. The scene is Dorris. She dances. Dorris dances. Glorious\r\n  Dorris. Dorris whirls, whirls, dances...\r\n\r\n                                                       Dorris dances.\r\n\r\nThe pianist crashes a bumper chord. The whole stage claps. Dorris,\r\nflushed, looks quick at John. His whole face is in shadow. She seeks\r\nfor her dance in it. She finds it a dead thing in the shadow which is\r\nhis dream. She rushes from the stage. Falls down the steps into her\r\ndressing-room. Pulls her hair. Her eyes, over a floor of tears, stare\r\nat the whitewashed ceiling. (Smell of dry paste, and paint, and soiled\r\nclothing.) Her pal comes in. Dorris flings herself into the old safe\r\narms, and cries bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you nothin doin,\xe2\x80\x9d is what Mame says to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HER LIPS ARE COPPER WIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n    whisper of yellow globes\r\n    gleaming on lamp-posts that sway\r\n    like bootleg licker drinkers in the fog\r\n\r\n    and let your breath be moist against me\r\n    like bright beads on yellow globes\r\n\r\n    telephone the power-house\r\n    that the main wires are insulate\r\n\r\n    (her words play softly up and down\r\n    dewy corridors of billboards)\r\n\r\n    then with your tongue remove the tape\r\n    and press your lips to mine\r\n    till they are incandescent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CALLING JESUS\r\n\r\n\r\nHer soul is like a little thrust-tailed dog that follows her,\r\nwhimpering. She is large enough, I know, to find a warm spot for it.\r\nBut each night when she comes home and closes the big outside storm\r\ndoor, the little dog is left in the vestibule, filled with chills till\r\nmorning. Some one ... eoho Jesus ... soft as a cotton boll brushed\r\nagainst the milk-pod cheek of Christ, will steal in and cover it that\r\nit need not shiver, and carry it to her where she sleeps upon clean hay\r\ncut in her dreams.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nWhen you meet her in the daytime on the streets, the little dog keeps\r\ncoming. Nothing happens at first, and then, when she has forgotten\r\nthe streets and alleys, and the large house where she goes to bed of\r\nnights, a soft thing like fur begins to rub your limbs, and you hear a\r\nlow, scared voice, lonely, calling, and you know that a cool something\r\nnozzles moisture in your palms. Sensitive things like nostrils, quiver.\r\nHer breath comes sweet as honeysuckle whose pistils bear the life of\r\ncoming song. And her eyes carry to where builders find no need for\r\nvestibules, for swinging on iron hinges, storm doors.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nHer soul is like a little thrust-tailed dog, that follows her,\r\nwhimpering. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it tagging on behind her, up streets where\r\nchestnut trees flowered, where dusty asphalt had been freshly sprinkled\r\nwith clean water. Up alleys where niggers sat on low door-steps before\r\ntumbled shanties and sang and loved. At night, when she comes home, the\r\nlittle dog is left in the vestibule, nosing the crack beneath the big\r\nstorm door, filled with chills till morning. Some one ... eoho Jesus\r\n... soft as the bare feet of Christ moving across bales of southern\r\ncotton, will steal in and cover it that it need not shiver, and carry\r\nit to her where she sleeps: cradled in dream-fluted cane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOX SEAT\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\n\r\nHouses are shy girls whose eyes shine reticently upon the dusk body of\r\nthe street. Upon the gleaming limbs and asphalt torso of a dreaming\r\nnigger. Shake your curled wool-blossoms, nigger. Open your liver lips\r\nto the lean, white spring. Stir the root-life of a withered people.\r\nCall them from their houses, and teach them to dream.\r\n\r\nDark swaying forms of Negroes are street songs that woo virginal houses.\r\n\r\nDan Moore walks southward on Thirteenth Street. The low limbs of\r\nbudding chestnut trees recede above his head. Chestnut buds and\r\nblossoms are wool he walks upon. The eyes of houses faintly touch him\r\nas he passes them. Soft girl-eyes, they set him singing. Girl-eyes\r\nwithin him widen upward to promised faces. Floating away, they dally\r\nwistfully over the dusk body of the street. Come on, Dan Moore, come\r\non. Dan sings. His voice is a little hoarse. It cracks. He strains to\r\nproduce tones in keeping with the houses\xe2\x80\x99 loveliness. Cant be done. He\r\nwhistles. His notes are shrill. They hurt him. Negroes open gates, and\r\ngo indoors, perfectly. Dan thinks of the house he\xe2\x80\x99s going to. Of the\r\ngirl. Lips, flesh-notes of a forgotten song, plead with him...\r\n\r\nDan turns into a side-street, opens an iron gate, bangs it to. Mounts\r\nthe steps, and searches for the bell. Funny, he cant find it. He\r\nfumbles around. The thought comes to him that some one passing by might\r\nsee him, and not understand. Might think that he is trying to sneak, to\r\nbreak in.\r\n\r\nDan: Break in. Get an ax and smash in. Smash in their faces. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show\r\nem. Break into an engine-house, steal a thousand horse-power fire\r\ntruck. Smash in with the truck. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show em. Grab an ax and brain\r\nem. Cut em up. Jack the Ripper. Baboon from the zoo. And then the\r\ncops come. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I aint a baboon. I aint Jack the Ripper. I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor\r\nman out of work. Take your hands off me, you bull-necked bears. Look\r\ninto my eyes. I am Dan Moore. I was born in a canefield. The hands of\r\nJesus touched me. I am come to a sick world to heal it. Only the other\r\nday, a dope fiend brushed against me\xe2\x80\x94 Dont laugh, you mighty, juicy,\r\nmeat-hook men. Give me your fingers and I will peel them as if they\r\nwere ripe bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome one might think he is trying to break in. He\xe2\x80\x99d better knock. His\r\nknuckles are raw bone against the thick glass door. He waits. No one\r\ncomes. Perhaps they havent heard him. He raps again. This time, harder.\r\nHe waits. No one comes. Some one is surely in. He fancies that he sees\r\ntheir shadows on the glass. Shadows of gorillas. Perhaps they saw him\r\ncoming and dont want to let him in. He knocks. The tension of his arms\r\nmakes the glass rattle. Hurried steps come towards him. The door opens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, you might break the glass\xe2\x80\x94the bell\xe2\x80\x94oh, Mr. Moore! I thought\r\nit must be some stranger. How do you do? Come in, wont you? Muriel?\r\nYes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call her. Take your things off, wont you? And have a seat in\r\nthe parlor. Muriel will be right down. Muriel! Oh Muriel! Mr. Moore to\r\nsee you. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be right down. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon me, wont you? So glad to\r\nsee you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes are weak. They are bluish and watery from reading newspapers.\r\nThe blue is steel. It gimlets Dan while her mouth flaps amiably to him.\r\n\r\nDan: Nothing for you to see, old mussel-head. Dare I show you? If I\r\ndid, delirium would furnish you headlines for a month. Now look here.\r\nThats enough. Go long, woman. Say some nasty thing and I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you.\r\nHuh. Better damned sight not. Ta-ta, Mrs. Pribby.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pribby retreats to the rear of the house. She takes up a\r\nnewspaper. There is a sharp click as she fits into her chair and draws\r\nit to the table. The click is metallic like the sound of a bolt being\r\nshot into place. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sting. Sinking into a soft couch, he closes\r\nthem. The house contracts about him. It is a sharp-edged, massed,\r\nmetallic house. Bolted. About Mrs. Pribby. Bolted to the endless rows\r\nof metal houses. Mrs. Pribby\xe2\x80\x99s house. The rows of houses belong to\r\nother Mrs. Pribbys. No wonder he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sing to them.\r\n\r\nDan: What\xe2\x80\x99s Muriel doing here? God, what a place for her. Whats she\r\ndoing? Putting her stockings on? In the bathroom. Come out of there,\r\nDan Moore. People must have their privacy. Peeping-toms. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\npeep. I\xe2\x80\x99ll listen. I like to listen.\r\n\r\nDan goes to the wall and places his ear against it. A passing street\r\ncar and something vibrant from the earth sends a rumble to him. That\r\nrumble comes from the earth\xe2\x80\x99s deep core. It is the mutter of powerful\r\nunderground races. Dan has a picture of all the people rushing to put\r\ntheir ears against walls, to listen to it. The next world-savior is\r\ncoming up that way. Coming up. A continent sinks down. The new-world\r\nChrist will need consummate skill to walk upon the waters where huge\r\nbubbles burst... Thuds of Muriel coming down. Dan turns to the\r\npiano and glances through a stack of jazz music sheets. \xe2\x80\x9cJi-ji-bo,\r\nJI-JI-BO!\xe2\x80\x9d..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Dan, stranger, what brought you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuriel comes in, shakes hands, and then clicks into a high-armed seat\r\nunder the orange glow of a floor-lamp. Her face is fleshy. It would\r\ntend to coarseness but for the fresh fragrant something which is the\r\nlife of it. Her hair like an Indian\xe2\x80\x99s. But more curly and bushed\r\nand vagrant. Her nostrils flare. The flushed ginger of her cheeks is\r\ntouched orange by the shower of color from the lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you havent told me, you havent answered my question, stranger.\r\nWhat brought you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan feels the pressure of the house, of the rear room, of the rows of\r\nhouses, shift to Muriel. He is light. He loves her. He is doubly heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDont know, Muriel\xe2\x80\x94wanted to see you\xe2\x80\x94wanted to talk to you\xe2\x80\x94to see\r\nyou and tell you that I know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through\xe2\x80\x94what pain the\r\nlast few months must have been\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLets dont mention that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not, Muriel? I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Muriel, life is full of things like that. One grows strong and\r\nbeautiful in facing them. What else is life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dont know, Dan. And I dont believe I care. Whats the use? Lets talk\r\nabout something else. I hear there\xe2\x80\x99s a good show at the Lincoln this\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so Harry was telling me. Going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan starts to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didnt know. I dont want to keep you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts all right. You dont have to go till Bernice comes. And she wont be\r\nhere till eight. I\xe2\x80\x99m all dressed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence. The rustle of a newspaper being turned comes from the rear\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMuriel: Shame about Dan. Something awfully good and fine about him. But\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in. In where? Me? Dan, I could love you if I tried. I dont\r\nhave to try. I do. O Dan, dont you know I do? Timid lover, brave talker\r\nthat you are. Whats the good of all you know if you dont know that? I\r\nwont let myself. I? Mrs. Pribby who reads newspapers all night wont.\r\nWhat has she got to do with me? She is me, somehow. No she\xe2\x80\x99s not. Yes\r\nshe is. She is the town, and the town wont let me love you, Dan. Dont\r\nyou know? You could make it let me if you would. Why wont you? Youre\r\nselfish. I\xe2\x80\x99m not strong enough to buck it. Youre too selfish to buck\r\nit, for me. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d go. You irritate me. Dan, please go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing now, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame old thing, Muriel. Nothing, as the world would have it. Living,\r\nas I look at things. Living as much as I can without\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you cant live without money, Dan. Why dont you get a good job and\r\nsettle down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan: Same old line. Shoot it at me, sister. Hell of a note, this loving\r\nbusiness. For ten minutes of it youve got to stand the torture of an\r\nintolerable heaviness and a hundred platitudes. Well, damit, shoot on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what? my dear. Rustling newspapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustnt say that, Dan. It isnt right. Mrs. Pribby has been awfully\r\ngood to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare say she has. Whats that got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dan, youre so unconsiderate and selfish. All you think of is\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much\xe2\x80\x94I mean, you ought to work more and think less. Thats the\r\nbest way to get along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMussel-heads get along, Muriel. There is more to you than that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I think there is, Dan. But I dont know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntried to do something with myself. Something real and beautiful, I\r\nmean. But whats the good of trying? I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make people, every\r\none I come in contact with, happy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan looks at her, directly. Her animalism, still unconquered by\r\nzoo-restrictions and keeper-taboos, stirs him. Passion tilts upward,\r\nbringing with it the elements of an old desire. Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s lips become\r\nthe flesh-notes of a futile, plaintive longing. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to direct\r\nher is its fresh life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy, Muriel? No, not happy. Your aim is wrong. There is no such\r\nthing as happiness. Life bends joy and pain, beauty and ugliness,\r\nin such a way that no one may isolate them. No one should want to.\r\nPerfect joy, or perfect pain, with no contrasting element to define\r\nthem, would mean a monotony of consciousness, would mean death. Not\r\nhappy, Muriel. Say that you have tried to make them create. Say that\r\nyou have used your own capacity for life to cradle them. To start them\r\nupward-flowing. Or if you cant say that you have, then say that you\r\nwill. My talking to you will make you aware of your power to do so.\r\nSay that you will love, that you will give yourself in love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness crudely swerves into his passions. They flare up in\r\nhis eyes. They set up quivers in his abdomen. He is suddenly over-tense\r\nand nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuriel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe newspaper rustles in the rear room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuriel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan rises. His arms stretch towards her. His fingers and his palms,\r\npink in the lamp-light, are glowing irons. Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s chair is close and\r\nstiff about her. The house, the rows of houses locked about her chair.\r\nDan\xe2\x80\x99s fingers and arms are fire to melt and bars to wrench and force\r\nand pry. Her arms hang loose. Her hands are hot and moist. Dan takes\r\nthem. He slips to his knees before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, you mustnt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuriel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, really you mustnt. No, Dan. No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, Muriel. Must I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShhh. Dan, please get up. Please. Mrs. Pribby is right in the next\r\nroom. She\xe2\x80\x99ll hear you. She may come in. Dont, Dan. She\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, lets go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cant. Let go, Dan. Oh, wont you please let go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuriel tries to pull her hands away. Dan tightens his grip. He feels\r\nthe strength of his fingers. His muscles are tight and strong. He\r\nstands up. Thrusts out his chest. Muriel shrinks from him. Dan becomes\r\naware of his crude absurdity. His lips curl. His passion chills. He has\r\nan obstinate desire to possess her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuriel, I love you. I want you, whatever the world of Pribby says.\r\nDamn your Pribby. Who is she to dictate my love? I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood enough of\r\nher. Enough of you. Come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuriel\xe2\x80\x99s mouth works in and out. Her eyes flash and waggle. She\r\nwrenches her hands loose and forces them against his breast to keep\r\nhim off. Dan grabs her wrists. Wedges in between her arms. Her face is\r\nclose to him. It is hot and blue and moist. Ugly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDont, Dan. Oh, dont. What are you killing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhats weak in both of us and a whole litter of Pribbys. For once in\r\nyour life youre going to face whats real, by God\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sharp rap on the newspaper in the rear room cuts between them. The\r\nrap is like cool thick glass between them. Dan is hot on one side.\r\nMuriel, hot on the other. They straighten. Gaze fearfully at one\r\nanother. Neither moves. A clock in the rear room, in the rear room,\r\nthe rear room, strikes eight. Eight slow, cool sounds. Bernice. Muriel\r\nfastens on her image. She smooths her dress. She adjusts her skirt.\r\nShe becomes prim and cool. Rising, she skirts Dan as if to keep the\r\nglass between them. Dan, gyrating nervously above the easy swing of his\r\nlimbs, follows her to the parlor door. Muriel retreats before him till\r\nshe reaches the landing of the steps that lead upstairs. She smiles\r\nat him. Dan sees his face in the hall mirror. He runs his fingers\r\nthrough his hair. Reaches for his hat and coat and puts them on. He\r\nmoves towards Muriel. Muriel steps backward up one step. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s jaw\r\nshoots out. Muriel jerks her arm in warning of Mrs. Pribby. She gasps\r\nand turns and starts to run. Noise of a chair scraping as Mrs. Pribby\r\nrises from it, ratchets down the hall. Dan stops. He makes a wry face,\r\nwheels round, goes out, and slams the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nPeople come in slowly ... mutter, laughs, flutter, whishadwash, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nchanged my work-clothes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d ... and fill vacant seats of Lincoln\r\nTheater. Muriel, leading Bernice who is a cross between a washerwoman\r\nand a blue-blood lady, a washer-blue, a washer-lady, wanders down the\r\nright aisle to the lower front box. Muriel has on an orange dress.\r\nIts color would clash with the crimson box-draperies, its color would\r\ncontradict the sweet rose smile her face is bathed in, should she take\r\nher coat off. She\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it on. Pale purple shadows rest on the planes\r\nof her cheeks. Deep purple comes from her thick-shocked hair. Orange\r\nof the dress goes well with these. Muriel presses her coat down from\r\naround her shoulders. Teachers are not supposed to have bobbed hair.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99ll keep her hat on. She takes the first chair, and indicates that\r\nBernice is to take the one directly behind her. Seated thus, her eyes\r\nare level with, and near to, the face of an imaginary man upon the\r\nstage. To speak to Berny she must turn. When she does, the audience is\r\nsquare upon her.\r\n\r\nPeople come in slowly ... \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94for my Sunday-go-to-meeting dress. O glory\r\nGod! O shout Amen!\xe2\x80\x9d ... and fill vacant seats of Lincoln Theater. Each\r\none is a bolt that shoots into a slot, and is locked there. Suppose\r\nthe Lord should ask, where was Moses when the light went out? Suppose\r\nGabriel should blow his trumpet! The seats are slots. The seats are\r\nbolted houses. The mass grows denser. Its weight at first is impalpable\r\nupon the box. Then Muriel begins to feel it. She props her arm against\r\nthe brass box-rail, to ward it off. Silly. These people are friends of\r\nhers: a parent of a child she teaches, an old school friend. She smiles\r\nat them. They return her courtesy, and she is free to chat with Berny.\r\nBerny\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, started, runs on, and on. O washer-blue! O washer-lady!\r\n\r\nMuriel: Never see Dan again. He makes me feel queer. Starts things he\r\ndoesnt finish. Upsets me. I am not upset. I am perfectly calm. I am\r\ngoing to enjoy the show. Good show. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some show! This damn tame\r\nthing. O Dan. Wont see Dan again. Not alone. Have Mrs. Pribby come in.\r\nShe _was_ in. Keep Dan out. If I love him, can I keep him out? Well\r\nthen, I dont love him. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s out. Who is that coming in? Blind as a\r\nbat. Ding-bat. Looks like Dan. He mustnt see me. Silly. He cant reach\r\nme. He wont dare come in here. He\xe2\x80\x99d put his head down like a goring\r\nbull and charge me. He\xe2\x80\x99d trample them. He\xe2\x80\x99d gore. He\xe2\x80\x99d rape! Berny! He\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t dare come in here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBerny, who was that who just came in? I havent my glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours, a _good_ friend so I hear. Mr. Daniel Moore, Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. He\xe2\x80\x99s no friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? I hear he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he isnt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan is ushered down the aisle. He has to squeeze past the knees of\r\nseated people to reach his own seat. He treads on a man\xe2\x80\x99s corns. The\r\nman grumbles, and shoves him off. He shrivels close beside a portly\r\nNegress whose huge rolls of flesh meet about the bones of seat-arms.\r\nA soil-soaked fragrance comes from her. Through the cement floor\r\nher strong roots sink down. They spread under the asphalt streets.\r\nDreaming, the streets roll over on their bellies, and suck their glossy\r\nhealth from them. Her strong roots sink down and spread under the river\r\nand disappear in blood-lines that waver south. Her roots shoot down.\r\nDan\xe2\x80\x99s hands follow them. Roots throb. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s heart beats violently. He\r\nplaces his palms upon the earth to cool them. Earth throbs. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nbeats violently. He sees all the people in the house rush to the walls\r\nto listen to the rumble. A new-world Christ is coming up. Dan comes up.\r\nHe is startled. The eyes of the woman dont belong to her. They look at\r\nhim unpleasantly. From either aisle, bolted masses press in. He doesnt\r\nfit. The mass grows agitant. For an instant, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s and Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nmeet. His weight there slides the weight on her. She braces an arm\r\nagainst the brass rail, and turns her head away.\r\n\r\nMuriel: Damn fool; dear Dan, what did you want to follow me here for?\r\nOh cant you ever do anything right? Must you always pain me, and\r\nmake me hate you? I do hate you. I wish some one would come in with a\r\nhorse-whip and lash you out. I wish some one would drag you up a back\r\nalley and brain you with the whip-butt.\r\n\r\nMuriel glances at her wrist-watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarter of nine. Berny, what time have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight-forty. Time to begin. Oh, look Muriel, that woman with the\r\nplume; doesnt she look good! They say she\xe2\x80\x99s going with, oh, whats his\r\nname. You know. Too much powder. I can see it from here. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\norchestra now. O fine! Jim Clem at the piano!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men fill the pit. Instruments run the scale and tune. The saxophone\r\nmoans and throws a fit. Jim Clem, poised over the piano, is ready to\r\nbegin. His head nods forward. Opening crash. The house snaps dark. The\r\ncurtain recedes upward from the blush of the footlights. Jazz overture\r\nis over. The first act is on.\r\n\r\nDan: Old stuff. Muriel\xe2\x80\x94bored. Must be. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll smile and she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nclap. Do what youre bid, you she-slave. Look at her. Sweet, tame woman\r\nin a brass box seat. Clap, smile, fawn, clap. Do what youre bid. Drag\r\nme in with you. Dirty me. Prop me in your brass box seat. I\xe2\x80\x99m there, am\r\nI not? because of you. He-slave. Slave of a woman who is a slave. I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ndamned sight worse than you are. I sing your praises, Beauty! I exalt\r\nthee, O Muriel! A slave, thou art greater than all Freedom because I\r\nlove thee.\r\n\r\nDan fidgets, and disturbs his neighbors. His neighbors glare at him.\r\nHe glares back without seeing them. The man whose corns have been trod\r\nupon speaks to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, cant you, mister. Other people have paid their money\r\nbesides yourself to see the show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s face is a blur about two sullen liquid things that are his\r\neyes. The eyes dissolve in the surrounding vagueness. Dan suddenly\r\nfeels that the man is an enemy whom he has long been looking for.\r\n\r\nDan bristles. Glares furiously at the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. All right then. Look at the show. I\xe2\x80\x99m not stopping you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShhh,\xe2\x80\x9d from some one in the rear.\r\n\r\nDan turns around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts that man there who started everything. I didnt say a thing to him\r\nuntil he tried to start something. What have I got to do with whether\r\nhe has paid his money or not? Thats the manager\xe2\x80\x99s business. Do I look\r\nlike the manager?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShhhh. Youre right. Shhhh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDont tell me to shhh. Tell him. That man there. He started everything.\r\nIf what he wanted was to start a fight, why didnt he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man leans forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter be quiet, sonny. I aint said a thing about fight, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts a good thing you havent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShhhh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan grips himself. Another act is on. Dwarfs, dressed like\r\nprize-fighters, foreheads bulging like boxing gloves, are led upon\r\nthe stage. They are going to fight for the heavyweight championship.\r\nGruesome. Dan glances at Muriel. He imagines that she shudders. His\r\nmind curves back into himself, and picks up tail-ends of experiences.\r\nHis eyes are open, mechanically. The dwarfs pound and bruise and bleed\r\neach other, on his eyeballs.\r\n\r\nDan: Ah, but she was some baby! And not vulgar either. Funny how some\r\nwomen can do those things. Muriel dancing like that! Hell. She rolled\r\nand wabbled. Her buttocks rocked. She pulled up her dress and showed\r\nher pink drawers. Baby! And then she caught my eyes. Dont know what my\r\neyes had in them. Yes I do. God, dont I though! Sometimes I think, Dan\r\nMoore, that your eyes could burn clean ... burn clean ... BURN CLEAN!..\r\n\r\nThe gong rings. The dwarfs set to. They spar grotesquely, playfully,\r\nuntil one lands a stiff blow. This makes the other sore. He commences\r\nslugging. A real scrap is on. Time! The dwarfs go to their corners\r\nand are sponged and fanned off. Gloves bulge from their wrists. Their\r\nwrists are necks for the tight-faced gloves. The fellow to the right\r\nlets his eyes roam over the audience. He sights Muriel. He grins.\r\n\r\nDan: Those silly women arguing feminism. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I should have said\r\nto them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be clear to you women, that the proposition must\r\nbe stated thus:\r\n\r\n    Me, horizontally above her.\r\n    Action: perfect strokes downward oblique.\r\n    Hence, man dominates because of limitation.\r\n    Or, so it shall be until women learn their stuff.\r\n\r\nSo framed, the proposition is a mental-filler, Dentist, I\r\nwant gold teeth. It should become cherished of the technical intellect.\r\nI hereby offer it to posterity as one of the important machine-age\r\ndesigns. P. S. It should be noted, that because it _is_ an achievement\r\nof this age, its growth and hence its causes, up to the point of\r\nmaturity, antedate machinery. Ery...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gong rings. No fooling this time. The dwarfs set to. They clinch.\r\nThe referee parts them. One swings a cruel upper-cut and knocks the\r\nother down. A huge head hits the floor. Pop! The house roars. The\r\nfighter, groggy, scrambles up. The referee whispers to the contenders\r\nnot to fight so hard. They ignore him. They charge. Their heads jab\r\nlike boxing-gloves. They kick and spit and bite. They pound each other\r\nfuriously. Muriel pounds. The house pounds. Cut lips. Bloody noses.\r\nThe referee asks for the gong. Time! The house roars. The dwarfs bow,\r\nare made to bow. The house wants more. The dwarfs are led from the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nDan: Strange I never really noticed him before. Been sitting there for\r\nyears. Born a slave. Slavery not so long ago. He\xe2\x80\x99ll die in his chair.\r\nSwing low, sweet chariot. Jesus will come and roll him down the river\r\nJordan. Oh, come along, Moses, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get lost; stretch out your rod\r\nand come across. LET MY PEOPLE GO! Old man. Knows everyone who passes\r\nthe corners. Saw the first horse-cars. The first Oldsmobile. And he was\r\nborn in slavery. I did see his eyes. Never miss eyes. But they were\r\nbloodshot and watery. It hurt to look at them. It hurts to look in most\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He saw Grant and Lincoln. He saw Walt\xe2\x80\x94old man, did you\r\nsee Walt Whitman? Did you see Walt Whitman! Strange force that drew me\r\nto him. And I went up to see. The woman thought I saw crazy. I told\r\nhim to look into the heavens. He did, and smiled. I asked him if he\r\nknew what that rumbling is that comes up from the ground. Christ, what\r\na stroke that was. And the jabbering idiots crowding around. And the\r\ncrossing-cop leaving his job to come over and wheel him away...\r\n\r\nThe house applauds. The house wants more. The dwarfs are led back. But\r\nno encore. Must give the house something. The attendant comes out and\r\nannounces that Mr. Barry, the champion, will sing one of his own songs,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor your approval.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Barry grins at Muriel as he wabbles from the\r\nwing. He holds a fresh white rose, and a small mirror. He wipes blood\r\nfrom his nose. He signals Jim Clem. The orchestra starts. A sentimental\r\nlove song, Mr. Barry sings, first to one girl, and then another in the\r\naudience. He holds the mirror in such a way that it flashes in the face\r\nof each one he sings to. The light swings around.\r\n\r\nDan: I am going to reach up and grab the girders of this building and\r\npull them down. The crash will be a signal. Hid by the smoke and dust\r\nDan Moore will arise. In his right hand will be a dynamo. In his left,\r\na god\xe2\x80\x99s face that will flash white light from ebony. I\xe2\x80\x99ll grab a girder\r\nand swing it like a walking-stick. Lightning will flash. I\xe2\x80\x99ll grab\r\nits black knob and swing it like a crippled cane. Lightning... Some\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s flashing ... some one\xe2\x80\x99s flashing... Who in hell is flashing that\r\nmirror? Take it off me, godam you.\r\n\r\nDan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are half blinded. He moves his head. The light follows.\r\nHe hears the audience laugh. He hears the orchestra. A man with a\r\nhigh-pitched, sentimental voice is singing. Dan sees the dwarf. Along\r\nthe mirror flash the song comes. Dan ducks his head. The audience\r\nroars. The light swings around to Muriel. Dan looks. Muriel is too\r\nclose. Mr. Barry covers his mirror. He sings to her. She shrinks away.\r\nNausea. She clutches the brass box-rail. She moves to face away.\r\nThe audience is square upon her. Its eyes smile. Its hands itch to\r\nclap. Muriel turns to the dwarf and forces a smile at him. With a\r\nshowy blare of orchestration, the song comes to its close. Mr. Barry\r\nbows. He offers Muriel the rose, first having kissed it. Blood of his\r\nbattered lips is a vivid stain upon its petals. Mr. Barry offers Muriel\r\nthe rose. The house applauds. Muriel flinches back. The dwarf steps\r\nforward, diffident; threatening. Hate pops from his eyes and crackles\r\nlike a brittle heat about the box. The thick hide of his face is drawn\r\nin tortured wrinkles. Above his eyes, the bulging, tight-skinned brow.\r\nDan looks at it. It grows calm and massive. It grows profound. It is\r\na thing of wisdom and tenderness, of suffering and beauty. Dan looks\r\ndown. The eyes are calm and luminous. Words come from them... Arms\r\nof the audience reach out, grab Muriel, and hold her there. Claps\r\nare steel fingers that manacle her wrists and move them forward to\r\nacceptance. Berny leans forward and whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts all right. Go on\xe2\x80\x94take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWords form in the eyes of the dwarf:\r\n\r\n    Do not shrink. Do not be afraid of me.\r\n    _Jesus_\r\n    See how my eyes look at you.\r\n    _the Son of God_\r\n    I too was made in His image.\r\n    _was once_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    I give you the rose.\r\n\r\nMuriel, tight in her revulsion, sees black, and daintily reaches for\r\nthe offering. As her hand touches it, Dan springs up in his seat and\r\nshouts:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cJESUS WAS ONCE A LEPER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan steps down.\r\n\r\nHe is as cool as a green stem that has just shed its flower.\r\n\r\nRows of gaping faces strain towards him. They are distant, beneath him,\r\nimpalpable. Squeezing out, Dan again treads upon the corn-foot man. The\r\nman shoves him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch where youre going, mister. Crazy or no, you aint going to walk\r\nover me. Watch where youre going there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan turns, and serenely tweaks the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s nose. The man jumps up. Dan\r\nis jammed against a seat-back. A slight swift anger flicks him. His\r\nfist hooks the other\xe2\x80\x99s jaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you have started something. Aint no man living can hit me and get\r\naway with it. Come on on the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house, tumultuously stirring, grabs its wraps and follows the men.\r\n\r\nThe man leads Dan up a black alley. The alley-air is thick and moist\r\nwith smells of garbage and wet trash. In the morning, singing niggers\r\nwill drive by and ring their gongs... Heavy with the scent of rancid\r\nflowers and with the scent of fight. The crowd, pressing forward, is a\r\nhollow roar. Eyes of houses, soft girl-eyes, glow reticently upon the\r\nhubbub and blink out. The man stops. Takes off his hat and coat. Dan,\r\nhaving forgotten him, keeps going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\n    My body is opaque to the soul.\r\n    Driven of the spirit, long have I sought to temper it unto the\r\n        spirit\xe2\x80\x99s longing,\r\n    But my mind, too, is opaque to the soul.\r\n    A closed lid is my soul\xe2\x80\x99s flesh-eye.\r\n    O Spirits of whom my soul is but a little finger,\r\n    Direct it to the lid of its flesh-eye.\r\n    I am weak with much giving.\r\n    I am weak with the desire to give more.\r\n    (How strong a thing is the little finger!)\r\n    So weak that I have confused the body with the soul,\r\n    And the body with its little finger.\r\n    (How frail is the little finger.)\r\n    My voice could not carry to you did you dwell in stars,\r\n    O Spirits of whom my soul is but a little finger..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HARVEST SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am a reaper whose muscles set at sundown. All my oats are\r\n        cradled.\r\n    But I am too chilled, and too fatigued to bind them.\r\n        And I hunger.\r\n\r\n    I crack a grain between my teeth. I do not taste it.\r\n    I have been in the fields all day. My throat is dry.\r\n        I hunger.\r\n\r\n    My eyes are caked with dust of oatfields at harvest-time.\r\n    I am a blind man who stares across the hills, seeking stack\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n        fields of other harvesters.\r\n\r\n    It would be good to see them .. crook\xe2\x80\x99d, split, and iron-ring\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n        handles of the scythes. It would be good to see them,\r\n        dust-caked and blind. I hunger.\r\n\r\n    (Dusk is a strange fear\xe2\x80\x99d sheath their blades are dull\xe2\x80\x99d in.)\r\n    My throat is dry. And should I call, a cracked grain like the oats\r\n        ... eoho\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    I fear to call. What should they hear me, and offer me their\r\n        grain, oats, or wheat, or corn? I have been in the fields all\r\n        day. I fear I could not taste it. I fear knowledge of my\r\n        hunger.\r\n\r\n    My ears are caked with dust of oatfields at harvest-time.\r\n    I am a deaf man who strains to hear the calls of other harvesters\r\n        whose throats are also dry.\r\n\r\n    It would be good to hear their songs .. reapers of the\r\n        sweet-stalk\xe2\x80\x99d cane, cutters of the corn .. even though their\r\n        throats cracked and the strangeness of their voices deafened\r\n        me.\r\n\r\n    I hunger. My throat is dry. Now that the sun has set and I am\r\n        chilled, I fear to call. (Eoho, my brothers!)\r\n\r\n    I am a reaper. (Eoho!) All my oats are cradled. But I am too\r\n        fatigued to bind them. And I hunger. I crack a grain. It has\r\n        no taste to it. My throat is dry...\r\n\r\n    O my brothers, I beat my palms, still soft, against the stubble of\r\n        my harvesting. (You beat your soft palms, too.) My pain is\r\n        sweet. Sweeter than the oats or wheat or corn. It will not\r\n        bring me knowledge of my hunger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BONA AND PAUL\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nOn the school gymnasium floor, young men and women are drilling. They\r\nare going to be teachers, and go out into the world .. thud, thud ..\r\nand give precision to the movements of sick people who all their lives\r\nhave been drilling. One man is out of step. In step. The teacher glares\r\nat him. A girl in bloomers, seated on a mat in the corner because she\r\nhas told the director that she is sick, sees that the footfalls of the\r\nmen are rhythmical and syncopated. The dance of his blue-trousered\r\nlimbs thrills her.\r\n\r\nBona: He is a candle that dances in a grove swung with pale balloons.\r\n\r\nColumns of the drillers thud towards her. He is in the front row. He is\r\nin no row at all. Bona can look close at him. His red-brown face\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBona: He is a harvest moon. He is an autumn leaf. He is a nigger. Bona!\r\nBut dont all the dorm girls say so? And dont you, when you are sane,\r\nsay so? Thats why I love\xe2\x80\x94Oh, nonsense. You have never loved a man who\r\ndidnt first love you. Besides\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nColumns thud away from her. Come to a halt in line formation. Rigid.\r\nThe period bell rings, and the teacher dismisses them.\r\n\r\nA group collects around Paul. They are choosing sides for basket-ball.\r\nGirls against boys. Paul has his. He is limbering up beneath the\r\nbasket. Bona runs to the girl captain and asks to be chosen. The girls\r\nfuss. The director comes to quiet them. He hears what Bona wants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Miss Hale, you were excused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I was, Mr. Boynton, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94you can play basket-ball, but you are too sick to drill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to put it that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe swings away from him to the girl captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, I want to play, and you must let me. This is the first time\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked and I dont see why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThats just it, Bona. We have our team.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, team or no team, I want to play and thats all there is to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snatches the ball from Helen\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and charges down the floor.\r\n\r\nHelen shrugs. One of the weaker girls says that she\xe2\x80\x99ll drop out. Helen\r\naccepts this. The team is formed. The whistle blows. The game starts.\r\nBona, in center, is jumping against Paul. He plays with her. Out-jumps\r\nher, makes a quick pass, gets a quick return, and shoots a goal from\r\nthe middle of the floor. Bona burns crimson. She fights, and tries to\r\nguard him. One of her team-mates advises her not to play so hard. Paul\r\nshoots his second goal.\r\n\r\nBona begins to feel a little dizzy and all in. She drives on. Almost\r\nhugs Paul to guard him. Near the basket, he attempts to shoot, and Bona\r\nlunges into his body and tries to beat his arms. His elbow, going up,\r\ngives her a sharp crack on the jaw. She whirls. He catches her. Her\r\nbody stiffens. Then becomes strangely vibrant, and bursts to a swift\r\nlife within her anger. He is about to give way before her hatred when\r\na new passion flares at him and makes his stomach fall. Bona squeezes\r\nhim. He suddenly feels stifled, and wonders why in hell the ring of\r\nsilly gaping faces that\xe2\x80\x99s caked about him doesnt make way and give\r\nhim air. He has a swift illusion that it is himself who has been\r\nstruck. He looks at Bona. Whir. Whir. They seem to be human distortions\r\nspinning tensely in a fog. Spinning .. dizzy .. spinning... Bona\r\njerks herself free, flushes a startling crimson, breaks through the\r\nbewildered teams, and rushes from the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nPaul is in his room of two windows.\r\n\r\nOutside, the South-Side L track cuts them in two.\r\n\r\nBona is one window. One window, Paul.\r\n\r\nHurtling Loop-jammed L trains throw them in swift shadow.\r\n\r\nPaul goes to his. Gray slanting roofs of houses are tinted lavender\r\nin the setting sun. Paul follows the sun, over the stock-yards where\r\na fresh stench is just arising, across wheat lands that are still\r\nwaving above their stubble, into the sun. Paul follows the sun to a\r\npine-matted hillock in Georgia. He sees the slanting roofs of gray\r\nunpainted cabins tinted lavender. A Negress chants a lullaby beneath\r\nthe mate-eyes of a southern planter. Her breasts are ample for the\r\nsuckling of a song. She weans it, and sends it, curiously weaving,\r\namong lush melodies of cane and corn. Paul follows the sun into himself\r\nin Chicago.\r\n\r\nHe is at Bona\xe2\x80\x99s window.\r\n\r\nWith his own glow he looks through a dark pane.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s room-mate comes in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Paul, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a date for you. Come on. Shake a leg, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis blonde hair is combed slick. His vest is snug about him.\r\n\r\nHe is like the electric light which he snaps on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatdoysay, Paul? Get a wiggle on. Come on. We havent got much time by\r\nthe time we eat and dress and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis bustling concentrates on the brushing of his hair.\r\n\r\nArt: What in hell\xe2\x80\x99s getting into Paul of late, anyway? Christ, but he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting moony. Its his blood. Dark blood: moony. Doesnt get anywhere\r\nunless you boost it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep it going\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Paul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94or it\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep on you. Dark blood; nigger? Thats what those\r\njealous she-hens say. Not Bona though, or she .. from the South ..\r\nwouldnt want me to fix a date for him and her. Hell of a thing, that\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s dark: you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to always be answering questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Paul, for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake leave that window, cant you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhats it, Art?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about fifty times. Got a date for you. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArt: He didnt use to ask; now he does. Getting up in the air. Getting\r\nfunny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeres your hat. Want a smoke? Paul! Here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a match. Now come\r\non and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it on the way to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul: He\xe2\x80\x99s going to Life this time. No doubt of that. Quit your\r\nkidding. Some day, dear Art, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kick the living slats out of\r\nyou, and you wont know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it for. And your slats will bring\r\nforth Life .. beautiful woman...\r\n\r\n_Pure Food Restaurant._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me some soup with a lot of crackers, understand? And then a\r\nroast-beef dinner. Same for you, eh, Paul? Now as I was saying, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a swell chance with her. And she\xe2\x80\x99s game. Best proof: she dont give\r\na damn what the dorm girls say about you and her in the gym, or about\r\nthe funny looks that Boynton gives her, or about what they say about,\r\nwell, hell, you know, Paul. And say, Paul, she\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetheart. Tall,\r\nnot puffy and pretty, more serious and deep\xe2\x80\x94the kind you like these\r\ndays. And they say she\xe2\x80\x99s got a car. And say, she\xe2\x80\x99s on fire. But you\r\nknow all about that. She got Helen to fix it up with me. The four of\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94remember the last party? Crimson Gardens! Boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s eyes take on a light that Art can settle in.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nArt has on his patent-leather pumps and fancy vest. A loose fall coat\r\nis swung across his arm. His face has been massaged, and over a close\r\nshave, powdered. It is a healthy pink the blue of evening tints a\r\npurple pallor. Art is happy and confident in the good looks that his\r\nmirror gave him. Bubbling over with a joy he must spend now if the\r\nnight is to contain it all. His bubbles, too, are curiously tinted\r\npurple as Paul watches them. Paul, contrary to what he had thought he\r\nwould be like, is cool like the dusk, and like the dusk, detached.\r\nHis dark face is a floating shade in evening\xe2\x80\x99s shadow. He sees Art,\r\ncuriously. Art is a purple fluid, carbon-charged, that effervesces\r\nbesides him. He loves Art. But is it not queer, this pale purple\r\nfacsimile of a red-blooded Norwegian friend of his? Perhaps for some\r\nreason, white skins are not supposed to live at night. Surely, enough\r\nnights would transform them fantastically, or kill them. And their red\r\npassion? Night paled that too, and made it moony. Moony. Thats what Art\r\nthought of him. Bona didnt, even in the daytime. Bona, would she be\r\npale? Impossible. Not that red glow. But the conviction did not set his\r\nemotion flowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome right in, wont you? The young ladies will be right down. Oh, Mr.\r\nCarlstrom, do play something for us while you are waiting. We just\r\nlove to listen to your music. You play so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHouses, and dorm sitting-rooms are places where white faces seclude\r\nthemselves at night. There is a reason...\r\n\r\nArt sat on the piano and simply tore it down. Jazz. The picture of Our\r\nPoets hung perilously.\r\n\r\nPaul: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the kid to play that stuff for me in the daytime.\r\nMight be different. More himself. More nigger. Different? There is.\r\nCurious, though.\r\n\r\nThe girls come in. Art stops playing, and almost immediately takes up a\r\npetty quarrel, where he had last left it, with Helen.\r\n\r\nBona, black-hair curled staccato, sharply contrasting with Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npuffy yellow, holds Paul\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She squeezes it. Her own emotion\r\nsupplements the return pressure. And then, for no tangible reason, her\r\nspirits drop. Without them, she is nervous, and slightly afraid. She\r\nresents this. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are critical. She resents Paul. She flares at\r\nhim. She flares to poise and security.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we be on our way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Bona, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2       \xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\nThe Boulevard is sleek in asphalt, and, with arc-lights and\r\nlimousines, aglow. Dry leaves scamper behind the whir of cars. The\r\nscent of exploded gasoline that mingles with them is faintly sweet.\r\nMellow stone mansions over-shadow clapboard homes which now resemble\r\nNegro shanties in some southern alley. Bona and Paul, and Art and\r\nHelen, move along an island-like, far-stretching strip of leaf-soft\r\nground. Above them, worlds of shadow-planes and solids, silently\r\nmoving. As if on one of these, Paul looks down on Bona. No doubt of it:\r\nher face is pale. She is talking. Her words have no feel to them. One\r\nsees them. They are pink petals that fall upon velvet cloth. Bona is\r\nsoft, and pale, and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul, tell me something about yourself\xe2\x80\x94or would you rather wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you anything you\xe2\x80\x99d like to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot what I want to know, Paul; what you want to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the beauty of a gem fathoms under sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that, but I dont want to be. I want to be near you. Perhaps I\r\nwill be if I tell you something. Paul, I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sea casts up its jewel into his hands, and burns them furiously. To\r\ntuck her arm under his and hold her hand will ease the burn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I say to you, brave dear woman\xe2\x80\x94I cant talk love. Love is a\r\ndry grain in my mouth unless it is wet with kisses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would dare? right here on the Boulevard? before Arthur and Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore myself? I dare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBona, in the slim shadow of a tree trunk, pulls Paul to her. Suddenly\r\nshe stiffens. Stops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not said you love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cant\xe2\x80\x94yet\xe2\x80\x94Bona.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, you never will. Youre cold. Cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBona: Colored; cold. Wrong somewhere.\r\n\r\nShe hurries and catches up with Art and Helen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nCrimson Gardens. Hurrah! So one feels. People ... University of Chicago\r\nstudents, members of the stock exchange, a large Negro in crimson\r\nuniform who guards the door .. had watched them enter. Had leaned\r\ntowards each other over ash-smeared tablecloths and highballs and\r\nwhispered: What is he, a Spaniard, an Indian, an Italian, a Mexican, a\r\nHindu, or a Japanese? Art had at first fidgeted under their stares ..\r\nwhat are _you_ looking at, you godam pack of owl-eyed hyenas? .. but\r\nsoon settled into his fuss with Helen, and forgot them. A strange thing\r\nhappened to Paul. Suddenly he knew that he was apart from the people\r\naround him. Apart from the pain which they had unconsciously caused.\r\nSuddenly he knew that people saw, not attractiveness in his dark skin,\r\nbut difference. Their stares, giving him to himself, filled something\r\nlong empty within him, and were like green blades sprouting in his\r\nconsciousness. There was fullness, and strength and peace about it all.\r\nHe saw himself, cloudy, but real. He saw the faces of the people at\r\nthe tables round him. White lights, or as now, the pink lights of the\r\nCrimson Gardens gave a glow and immediacy to white faces. The pleasure\r\nof it, equal to that of love or dream, of seeing this. Art and Bona and\r\nHelen? He\xe2\x80\x99d look. They were wonderfully flushed and beautiful. Not for\r\nhimself; because they were. Distantly. Who were they, anyway? God, if\r\nhe knew them. He\xe2\x80\x99d come in with them. Of that he was sure. Come where?\r\nInto life? Yes. No. Into the Crimson Gardens. A part of life. A carbon\r\nbubble. Would it look purple if he went out into the night and looked\r\nat it? His sudden starting to rise almost upset the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in hell\xe2\x80\x94pardon\xe2\x80\x94whats the matter, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot my cigarettes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoure smoking one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am. Pardon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter straightens them out. Takes their order.\r\n\r\nArt: What in hell\xe2\x80\x99s eating Paul? Moony aint the word for it. From bad\r\nto worse. And those godam people staring so. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s a queer fish.\r\nDoesnt seem to mind... He\xe2\x80\x99s my pal, let me tell you, you horn-rimmed\r\nowl-eyed hyena at that table, and a lot better than you whoever you\r\nare... Queer about him. I could stick up for him if he\xe2\x80\x99d only come\r\nout, one way or the other, and tell a feller. Besides, a room-mate has\r\na right to know. Thinks I wont understand. Said so. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a swell\r\nhead when it comes to brains, all right. God, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good straight\r\nfeller, though. Only, moony. Nut. Nuttish. Nuttery. Nutmeg... \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nyou say, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was talking to Bona, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, its nothing to get spiffy about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Oh, of course not. Please lets dont start some silly argument\r\nall over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow thats enough. Say, waiter, whats the matter with our order? Make\r\nit snappy, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrimson Gardens. Hurrah! So one feels. The drinks come. Four highballs.\r\nArt passes cigarettes. A girl dressed like a bare-back rider in flaming\r\npink, makes her way through tables to the dance floor. All lights are\r\ndimmed till they seem a lush afterglow of crimson. Spotlights the girl.\r\nShe sings. \xe2\x80\x9cLiza, Little Liza Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul is rosy before his window.\r\n\r\nHe moves, slightly, towards Bona.\r\n\r\nWith his own glow, he seeks to penetrate a dark pane.\r\n\r\nPaul: From the South. What does that mean, precisely, except that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll love or hate a nigger? Thats a lot. What does it mean except\r\nthat in Chicago you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the courage to neither love or hate. A\r\npriori. But it would seem that you have. Queer words, arent these,\r\nfor a man who wears blue pants on a gym floor in the daytime. Well,\r\nnever matter. You matter. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know you whom I look at. Know,\r\nnot love. Not that knowing is a greater pleasure; but that I have\r\njust found the joy of it. You came just a month too late. Even this\r\nafternoon I dreamed. To-night, along the Boulevard, you found me cold.\r\nPaul Johnson, cold! Thats a good one, eh, Art, you fine old stupid\r\nfellow, you! But I feel good! The color and the music and the song...\r\nA Negress chants a lullaby beneath the mate-eyes of a southern planter.\r\nO song!.. And those flushed faces. Eager brilliant eyes. Hard to\r\nimagine them as unawakened. Your own. Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re awake all right. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou know it too, dont you Bona?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth of what I was thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know I know\xe2\x80\x94something of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will\xe2\x80\x94before the evening\xe2\x80\x99s over. I promise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrimson Gardens. Hurrah! So one feels. The bare-back rider balances\r\nagilely on the applause which is the tail of her song. Orchestral\r\ninstruments warm up for jazz. The flute is a cat that ripples its fur\r\nagainst the deep-purring saxophone. The drum throws sticks. The cat\r\njumps on the piano keyboard. Hi diddle, hi diddle, the cat and the\r\nfiddle. Crimson Gardens .. hurrah! .. jumps over the moon. Crimson\r\nGardens! Helen .. O Eliza .. rabbit-eyes sparkling, plays up to,\r\nand tries to placate what she considers to be Paul\xe2\x80\x99s contempt. She\r\nalways does that .. Little Liza Jane... Once home, she burns with\r\nthe thought of what she\xe2\x80\x99s done. She says all manner of snidy things\r\nabout him, and swears that she\xe2\x80\x99ll never go out again when he is along.\r\nShe tries to get Art to break with him, saying, that if Paul, whom\r\nthe whole dormitory calls a nigger, is more to him than she is, well,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s through. She does not break with Art. She goes out as often as\r\nshe can with Art and Paul. She explains this to herself by a piece of\r\ninformation which a friend of hers had given her: men like him (Paul)\r\ncan fascinate. One is not responsible for fascination. Not one girl had\r\nreally loved Paul; he fascinated them. Bona didnt; only thought she\r\ndid. Time would tell. And of course, _she_ didnt. Liza... She plays up\r\nto, and tries to placate, Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul is so deep these days, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad he\xe2\x80\x99s found some one to\r\ninterest him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dont believe I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought escapes from Bona just a moment before her anger at having\r\nsaid it.\r\n\r\nBona: You little puffy cat, I do. I do!\r\n\r\nDont I, Paul? her eyes ask.\r\n\r\nHer answer is a crash of jazz from the palm-hidden orchestra. Crimson\r\nGardens is a body whose blood flows to a clot upon the dance floor. Art\r\nand Helen clot. Soon, Bona and Paul. Paul finds her a little stiff, and\r\nhis mind, wandering to Helen (silly little kid who wants every highball\r\nspoon her hands touch, for a souvenir), supple, perfect little dancer,\r\nwishes for the next dance when he and Art will exchange.\r\n\r\nBona knows that she must win him to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince when have men like you grown cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first philosopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were a poet\xe2\x80\x94or a gym director.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHence, your failure to make love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBona\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flare. Water. Grow red about the rims. She would like to\r\ntear away from him and dash across the clotted floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMental concepts rule you. If they were flush with mine\xe2\x80\x94good. I dont\r\nbelieve they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know, Mr. Philosopher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMostly a priori.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk well for a gym director.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you. Ou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe presses away. Paul, conscious of the convention in it, pulls her\r\nto him. Her body close. Her head still strains away. He nearly crushes\r\nher. She tries to pinch him. Then sees people staring, and lets her\r\narms fall. Their eyes meet. Both, contemptuous. The dance takes blood\r\nfrom their minds and packs it, tingling, in the torsos of their swaying\r\nbodies. Passionate blood leaps back into their eyes. They are a dizzy\r\nblood clot on a gyrating floor.\r\n\r\nThey know that the pink-faced people have no part in what they feel.\r\nTheir instinct leads them away from Art and Helen, and towards the\r\nbig uniformed black man who opens and closes the gilded exit door.\r\nThe cloak-room girl is tolerant of their impatience over such trivial\r\nthings as wraps. And slightly superior. As the black man swings the\r\ndoor for them, his eyes are knowing. Too many couples have passed out,\r\nflushed and fidgety, for him not to know. The chill air is a shock to\r\nPaul. A strange thing happens. He sees the Gardens purple, as if he\r\nwere way off. And a spot is in the purple. The spot comes furiously\r\ntowards him. Face of the black man. It leers. It smiles sweetly like a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s. Paul leaves Bona and darts back so quickly that he doesnt give\r\nthe door-man a chance to open. He swings in. Stops. Before the huge\r\nbulk of the Negro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoure wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, youre wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came back to tell you, to shake your hand, and tell you that you are\r\nwrong. That something beautiful is going to happen. That the\r\nGardens are purple like a bed of roses would be at dusk. That I\r\ncame into the Gardens, into life in the Gardens with one whom I did\r\nnot know. That I danced with her, and did not know her. That I felt\r\npassion, contempt and passion for her whom I did not know. That I\r\nthought of her. That my thoughts were matches thrown into a dark\r\nwindow. And all the while the Gardens were purple like a bed of roses\r\nwould be at dusk. I came back to tell you, brother, that white faces\r\nare petals of roses. That dark faces are petals of dusk. That I am\r\ngoing out and gather petals. That I am going out and know her whom I\r\nbrought here with me to these Gardens which are purple like a bed of\r\nroses would be at dusk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul and the black man shook hands.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the spot where they had been standing, Bona was gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      to WALDO FRANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                KABNIS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nRalph Kabnis, propped in his bed, tries to read. To read himself to\r\nsleep. An oil lamp on a chair near his elbow burns unsteadily. The\r\ncabin room is spaced fantastically about it. Whitewashed hearth and\r\nchimney, black with sooty saw-teeth. Ceiling, patterned by the fringed\r\nglobe of the lamp. The walls, unpainted, are seasoned a rosin yellow.\r\nAnd cracks between the boards are black. These cracks are the lips the\r\nnight winds use for whispering. Night winds in Georgia are vagrant\r\npoets, whispering. Kabnis, against his will, lets his book slip down,\r\nand listens to them. The warm whiteness of his bed, the lamp-light, do\r\nnot protect him from the weird chill of their song:\r\n\r\n    White-man\xe2\x80\x99s land.\r\n    Niggers, sing.\r\n    Burn, bear black children\r\n    Till poor rivers bring\r\n    Rest, and sweet glory\r\n    In Camp Ground.\r\n\r\nKabnis\xe2\x80\x99 thin hair is streaked on the pillow. His hand strokes the slim\r\nsilk of his mustache. His thumb, pressed under his chin, seems to be\r\ntrying to give squareness and projection to it. Brown eyes stare from\r\na lemon face. Moisture gathers beneath his arm-pits. He slides down\r\nbeneath the cover, seeking release.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Near me. Now. Whoever you are, my warm glowing sweetheart,\r\ndo not think that the face that rests beside you is the real Kabnis.\r\nRalph Kabnis is a dream. And dreams are faces with large eyes and weak\r\nchins and broad brows that get smashed by the fists of square faces.\r\nThe body of the world is bull-necked. A dream is a soft face that fits\r\nuncertainly upon it... God, if I could develop that in words. Give\r\nwhat I know a bull-neck and a heaving body, all would go well with\r\nme, wouldnt it, sweetheart? If I could feel that I came to the South\r\nto face it. If I, the dream (not what is weak and afraid in me) could\r\nbecome the face of the South. How my lips would sing for it, my songs\r\nbeing the lips of its soul. Soul. Soul hell. There aint no such thing.\r\nWhat in hell was that?\r\n\r\nA rat had run across the thin boards of the ceiling. Kabnis thrusts his\r\nhead out from the covers. Through the cracks, a powdery faded red dust\r\nsprays down on him. Dust of slave-fields, dried, scattered... No use\r\nto read. Christ, if he only could drink himself to sleep. Something\r\nas sure as fate was going to happen. He couldnt stand this thing much\r\nlonger. A hen, perched on a shelf in the adjoining room begins to\r\ntread. Her nails scrape the soft wood. Her feathers ruffle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of that, you egg-laying bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis hurls a slipper against the wall. The hen flies from her perch\r\nand cackles as if a skunk were after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow cut out that racket or I\xe2\x80\x99ll wring your neck for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnswering cackles arise in the chicken yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s hell cant you leave me alone? Damn it, I wish your\r\ncackle would choke you. Choke every mother\xe2\x80\x99s son of them in this\r\nGod-forsaken hole. Go away. By God I\xe2\x80\x99ll wring your neck for you if you\r\ndont. Hell of a mess I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in: even the poultry is hostile. Go way.\r\nGo way. By God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis jumps from his bed. His eyes are wild. He makes for the door.\r\nBursts through it. The hen, driving blindly at the window-pane,\r\nscreams. Then flies and flops around trying to elude him. Kabnis\r\ncatches her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot you now, you she-bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his fingers about her neck, he thrusts open the outside door and\r\nsteps out into the serene loveliness of Georgian autumn moonlight. Some\r\ndistance off, down in the valley, a band of pine-smoke, silvered gauze,\r\ndrifts steadily. The half-moon is a white child that sleeps upon the\r\ntree-tops of the forest. White winds croon its sleep-song:\r\n\r\n    rock a-by baby..\r\n    Black mother sways, holding a white child on her bosom.\r\n    when the bough bends..\r\n    Her breath hums through pine-cones.\r\n    cradle will fall..\r\n    Teat moon-children at your breasts,\r\n    down will come baby..\r\n    Black mother.\r\n\r\nKabnis whirls the chicken by its neck, and throws the head away. Picks\r\nup the hopping body, warm, sticky, and hides it in a clump of bushes.\r\nHe wipes blood from his hands onto the coarse scant grass.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Thats done. Old Chromo in the big house there will wonder whats\r\nbecome of her pet hen. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99ll teach her a lesson: not to make a\r\nhen-coop of my quarters. Quarters. Hell of a fine quarters, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\r\nFive years ago; look at me now. Earth\xe2\x80\x99s child. The earth my mother. God\r\nis a profligate red-nosed man about town. Bastardy; me. A bastard son\r\nhas got a right to curse his maker. God...\r\n\r\nKabnis is about to shake his fists heaven-ward. He looks up, and the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s beauty strikes him dumb. He falls to his knees. Sharp stones\r\ncut through his thin pajamas. The shock sends a shiver over him. He\r\nquivers. Tears mist his eyes. He writhes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty, dear God, dear Jesus, do not torture me with beauty.\r\nTake it away. Give me an ugly world. Ha, ugly. Stinking like unwashed\r\nniggers. Dear Jesus, do not chain me to myself and set these hills\r\nand valleys, heaving with folk-songs, so close to me that I cannot\r\nreach them. There is a radiant beauty in the night that touches and\r\n... tortures me. Ugh. Hell. Get up, you damn fool. Look around. Whats\r\nbeautiful there? Hog pens and chicken yards. Dirty red mud. Stinking\r\nouthouse. Whats beauty anyway but ugliness if it hurts you? God, he\r\ndoesnt exist, but nevertheless He is ugly. Hence, what comes from\r\nHim is ugly. Lynchers and business men, and that cockroach Hanby,\r\nespecially. How come that he gets to be principal of a school? Of the\r\nschool I\xe2\x80\x99m driven to teach in? God\xe2\x80\x99s handiwork, doubtless. God and\r\nHanby, they belong together. Two godam moral-spouters. Oh, no, I wont\r\nlet that emotion come up in me. Stay down. Stay down, I tell you. O\r\nJesus, Thou art beautiful... Come, Ralph, pull yourself together.\r\nCurses and adoration dont come from what is sane. This loneliness,\r\ndumbness, awful, intangible oppression is enough to drive a man insane.\r\nMiles from nowhere. A speck on a Georgia hillside. Jesus, can you\r\nimagine it\xe2\x80\x94an atom of dust in agony on a hillside? Thats a spectacle\r\nfor you. Come, Ralph, old man, pull yourself together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis has stiffened. He is conscious now of the night wind, and\r\nof how it chills him. He rises. He totters as a man would who for\r\nthe first time uses artificial limbs. As a completely artificial man\r\nwould. The large frame house, squatting on brick pillars, where the\r\nprincipal of the school, his wife, and the boarding girls sleep, seems\r\na curious shadow of his mind. He tries, but cannot convince himself\r\nof its reality. His gaze drifts down into the vale, across the swamp,\r\nup over the solid dusk bank of pines, and rests, bewildered-like,\r\non the court-house tower. It is dull silver in the moonlight. White\r\nchild that sleeps upon the top of pines. Kabnis\xe2\x80\x99 mind clears. He sees\r\nhimself yanked beneath that tower. He sees white minds, with indolent\r\nassumption, juggle justice and a nigger... Somewhere, far off in\r\nthe straight line of his sight, is Augusta. Christ, how cut off from\r\neverything he is. And hours, hours north, why not say a lifetime\r\nnorth? Washington sleeps. Its still, peaceful streets, how desirable\r\nthey are. Its people whom he had always halfway despised. New York?\r\nImpossible. It was a fiction. He had dreamed it. An impotent nostalgia\r\ngrips him. It becomes intolerable. He forces himself to narrow to a cabin\r\nsilhouetted on a knoll about a mile away. Peace. Negroes within it are\r\ncontent. They farm. They sing. They love. They sleep. Kabnis wonders if\r\nperhaps they can feel him. If perhaps he gives them bad dreams. Things\r\nare so immediate in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThinking that now he can go to sleep, he re-enters his room. He builds\r\na fire in the open hearth. The room dances to the tongues of flames,\r\nand sings to the crackling and spurting of the logs. Wind comes up\r\nbetween the floor boards, through the black cracks of the walls.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Cant sleep. Light a cigarette. If that old bastard comes over\r\nhere and smells smoke, I\xe2\x80\x99m done for. Hell of a note, cant even smoke.\r\nThe stillness of it: where they burn and hang men, you cant smoke. Cant\r\ntake a swig of licker. What do they think this is, anyway, some sort\r\nof temperance school? How did I ever land in such a hole? Ugh. One\r\nmight just as well be in his grave. Still as a grave. Jesus, how still\r\neverything is. Does the world know how still it is? People make noise.\r\nThey are afraid of silence. Of what lives, and God, of what dies in\r\nsilence. There must be many dead things moving in silence. They come\r\nhere to touch me. I swear I feel their fingers... Come, Ralph, pull\r\nyourself together. What in hell was that? Only the rustle of leaves, I\r\nguess. You know, Ralph, old man, it wouldnt surprise me at all to see a\r\nghost. People dont think there are such things. They rationalize their\r\nfear, and call their cowardice science. Fine bunch, they are. Damit,\r\nthat was a noise. And not the wind either. A chicken maybe. Hell,\r\nchickens dont wander around this time of night. What in hell is it?\r\n\r\nA scraping sound, like a piece of wood dragging over the ground, is\r\ncoming near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha. The ghosts down this way havent got any chains to rattle,\r\nso they drag trees along with them. Thats a good one. But no joke,\r\nsomething is outside this house, as sure as hell. Whatever it is, it\r\ncan get a good look at me and I cant see it. Jesus Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis pours water on the flames and blows his lamp out. He picks up a\r\npoker and stealthily approaches the outside door. Swings it open, and\r\nlurches into the night. A calf, carrying a yoke of wood, bolts away\r\nfrom him and scampers down the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m damned. This godam place is sure getting the best of me.\r\nCome, Ralph, old man, pull yourself together. Nights cant last forever.\r\nThank God for that. Its Sunday already. First time in my life I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\r\nwanted Sunday to come. Hell of a day. And down here there\xe2\x80\x99s no such\r\nthing as ducking church. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Halsey and Layman, and get a\r\ngood square meal. Thats something. And Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s a damn good feller.\r\nCant talk to him, though. Who in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s world can I talk to? A hen.\r\nGod. Myself... I\xe2\x80\x99m going bats, no doubt of that. Come now, Ralph, go\r\nin and make yourself go to sleep. Come now .. in the door .. thats\r\nright. Put the poker down. There. All right. Slip under the sheets.\r\nClose your eyes. Think nothing .. a long time .. nothing, nothing.\r\nDont even think nothing. Blank. Not even blank. Count. No, mustnt count\r\nNothing .. blank .. nothing .. blank .. space without stars in it.\r\nNo, nothing .. nothing..\r\n\r\nKabnis sleeps. The winds, like soft-voiced vagrant poets sing:\r\n\r\n    White-man\xe2\x80\x99s land.\r\n    Niggers, sing.\r\n    Burn, bear black children\r\n    Till poor rivers bring\r\n    Rest, and sweet glory\r\n    In Camp Ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nThe parlor of Fred Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s home. There is a seediness about it.\r\nIt seems as though the fittings have given a frugal service to at\r\nleast seven generations of middle-class shop-owners. An open grate\r\nburns cheerily in contrast to the gray cold changed autumn weather.\r\nAn old-fashioned mantelpiece supports a family clock (not running),\r\na figure or two in imitation bronze, and two small group pictures.\r\nDirectly above it, in a heavy oak frame, the portrait of a bearded\r\nman. Black hair, thick and curly, intensifies the pallor of the high\r\nforehead. The eyes are daring. The nose, sharp and regular. The poise\r\nsuggests a tendency to adventure checked by the necessities of absolute\r\ncommand. The portrait is that of an English gentleman who has retained\r\nmuch of his culture, in that money has enabled him to escape being\r\ndrawn through a land-grubbing pioneer life. His nature and features,\r\nmodified by marriage and circumstances, have been transmitted to his\r\ngreat-grandson, Fred. To the left of this picture, spaced on the wall,\r\nis a smaller portrait of the great-grandmother. That here there is\r\na Negro strain, no one would doubt. But it is difficult to say in\r\nprecisely what feature it lies. On close inspection, her mouth is seen\r\nto be wistfully twisted. The expression of her face seems to shift\r\nbefore one\xe2\x80\x99s gaze\xe2\x80\x94now ugly, repulsive; now sad, and somehow beautiful\r\nin its pain. A tin wood-box rests on the floor below. To the right of\r\nthe great-grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s portrait hangs a family group: the father,\r\nmother, two brothers, and one sister of Fred. It includes himself\r\nsome thirty years ago when his face was an olive white, and his hair\r\nluxuriant and dark and wavy. The father is a rich brown. The mother,\r\npractically white. Of the children, the girl, quite young, is like\r\nFred; the two brothers, darker. The walls of the room are plastered\r\nand painted green. An old upright piano is tucked into the corner near\r\nthe window. The window looks out on a forlorn, box-like, whitewashed\r\nframe church. Negroes are gathering, on foot, driving questionable gray\r\nand brown mules, and in an occasional Ford, for afternoon service.\r\nBeyond, Georgia hills roll off into the distance, their dreary aspect\r\nheightened by the gray spots of unpainted one- and two-room shanties.\r\nClumps of pine trees here and there are the dark points the whole\r\nlandscape is approaching. The church bell tolls. Above its squat tower,\r\na great spiral of buzzards reaches far into the heavens. An ironic\r\ncomment upon the path that leads into the Christian land... Three\r\nrocking chairs are grouped around the grate. Sunday papers scattered on\r\nthe floor indicate a recent usage. Halsey, a well-built, stocky fellow,\r\nhair cropped close, enters the room. His Sunday clothes smell of wood\r\nand glue, for it is his habit to potter around his wagon-shop even\r\non the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s day. He is followed by Professor Layman, tall, heavy,\r\nloose-jointed Georgia Negro, by turns teacher and preacher, who has\r\ntraveled in almost every nook and corner of the state and hence knows\r\nmore than would be good for anyone other than a silent man. Kabnis,\r\ntrying to force through a gathering heaviness, trails in behind them.\r\nThey slip into chairs before the fire.\r\n\r\nLayman: Sholy fine, Mr. Halsey, sholy fine. This town\xe2\x80\x99s right good at\r\nfeedin folks, better\xe2\x80\x99n most towns in th state, even for preachers, but\r\nI ken say this beats um all. Yassur. Now aint that right, Professor\r\nKabnis?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Yes sir, this beats them all, all right\xe2\x80\x94best I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and\r\nthats a fact, though my comparison doesnt carry far, y\xe2\x80\x99know.\r\n\r\nLayman: Hows that, Professor?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Well, this is my first time out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLayman: For a fact. Aint seed you round so much. Whats th trouble? Dont\r\nlike our folks down this away?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Aint that, Layman. He aint like most northern niggers that way.\r\nAint a thing stuck up about him. He likes us, you an me, maybe all\xe2\x80\x94its\r\nthat red mud over yonder\xe2\x80\x94gets stuck in it an cant get out. (Laughs.)\r\nAn then he loves th fire so, warm as its been. Coldest Yankee I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\r\nseen. But I\xe2\x80\x99m goin t get him out now in a jiffy, eh, Kabnis?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Sure, I should say so, sure. Dont think its because I dont\r\nlike folks down this way. Just the opposite, in fact. Theres more\r\nhospitality and everything. Its diff\xe2\x80\x94that is, theres lots of northern\r\nexaggeration about the South. Its not half the terror they picture it.\r\nThings are not half bad, as one could easily figure out for himself\r\nwithout ever crossing the Mason and Dixie line: all these people\r\nwouldnt stay down here, especially the rich, the ones that could easily\r\nleave, if conditions were so mighty bad. And then too, sometime back,\r\nmy family were southerners y\xe2\x80\x99know. From Georgia, in fact\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLayman: Nothin t feel proud about, Professor. Neither your folks nor\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nHalsey (in a mock religious tone): Amen t that, brother Layman. Amen\r\n(turning to Kabnis, half playful, yet somehow dead in earnest). An Mr.\r\nKabnis, kindly remember youre in th land of cotton\xe2\x80\x94hell of a land.\r\nTh white folks get th boll; th niggers get th stalk. An dont you dare\r\ntouch th boll, or even look at it. They\xe2\x80\x99ll swing y sho. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nKabnis: But they wouldnt touch a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94fellows, men like us three\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLayman: Nigger\xe2\x80\x99s a nigger down this away, Professor. An only two\r\ndividins: good an bad. An even they aint permanent categories. They\r\nsometimes mixes um up when it comes t lynchin. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen um do it.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Dont let th fear int y, though, Kabnis. This county\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nun. Aint been a stringin up I can remember. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nLayman: This is a good town an a good county. But theres some that\r\nmakes up fer it.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Things are better now though since that stir about those\r\npeonage cases, arent they?\r\n\r\nLayman: Ever hear tell of a single shot killin moren one rabbit,\r\nProfessor?\r\n\r\nKabnis: No, of course not, that is, but then\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Now I know you werent born yesterday, sprung up so rapid like\r\nyou aint heard of th brick thrown in th hornets\xe2\x80\x99 nest. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nKabnis: Hardly, hardly, I know\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Course y do. (To Layman) See, northern niggers aint as dumb as\r\nthey make out t be.\r\n\r\nKabnis (overlooking the remark): Just stirs them up to sting.\r\n\r\nHalsey: T perfection. An put just like a professor should put it.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Thats what actually did happen?\r\n\r\nLayman: Well, if it aint sos only because th stingers already movin jes\r\nas fast as they ken go. An been goin ever since I ken remember, an then\r\nsome mo. Though I dont usually make mention of it.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Damn sight better not. Say, Layman, you come from where theyre\r\nalways swarmin, dont y?\r\n\r\nLayman: Yassur. I do that, sho. Dont want t mention it, but its a fact.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seed th time when there werent no use t even stretch out flat upon\r\nth ground. Seen um shoot an cut a man t pieces who had died th night\r\nbefo. Yassur. An they didnt stop when they found out he was dead\xe2\x80\x94jes\r\nwent on ahackin at him anyway.\r\n\r\nKabnis: What did you do? What did you say to them, Professor?\r\n\r\nLayman: Thems th things you neither does a thing or talks about if y\r\nwant t stay around this away, Professor.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Listen t what he\xe2\x80\x99s tellin y, Kabnis. May come in handy some day.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Cant something be done? But of course not. This\r\npreacher-ridden race. Pray and shout. Theyre in the preacher\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\nThats what it is. And the preacher\xe2\x80\x99s hands are in the white man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Present company always excepted.\r\n\r\nKabnis: The Professor knows I wasnt referring to him.\r\n\r\nLayman: Preacher\xe2\x80\x99s a preacher anywheres you turn. No use exceptin.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Well, of course, if you look at it that way. I didnt mean\xe2\x80\x94 But\r\ncant something be done?\r\n\r\nLayman: Sho. Yassur. An done first rate an well. Jes like Sam Raymon\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Hows that? What did he do?\r\n\r\nLayman: Th white folks (reckon I oughtnt tell it) had jes knocked two\r\nothers like you kill a cow\xe2\x80\x94brained um with an ax, when they caught Sam\r\nRaymon by a stream. They was about t do fer him when he up an says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite folks, I gotter die, I knows that. But wont y let me die in my\r\nown way?\xe2\x80\x9d Some was fer gettin after him, but th boss held um back an\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cJes so longs th nigger dies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d An Sam fell down ont his knees an\r\nprayed, \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, Ise comin to y,\xe2\x80\x9d an he up an jumps int th stream.\r\n\r\nSinging from the church becomes audible. Above it, rising and falling\r\nin a plaintive moan, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice swells to shouting. Kabnis hears\r\nit. His face gives way to an expression of mingled fear, contempt, and\r\npity. Layman takes no notice of it. Halsey grins at Kabnis. He feels\r\nlike having a little sport with him.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Lets go t church, eh, Kabnis?\r\n\r\nKabnis (seeking control): All right\xe2\x80\x94no sir, not by a damn sight. Once\r\na days enough for me. Christ, but that stuff gets to me. Meaning no\r\nreflection on you, Professor.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Course not. Say, Kabnis, noticed y this morning. What\xe2\x80\x99d y get\r\nup for an go out?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Couldnt stand the shouting, and thats a fact. We dont have that\r\nsort of thing up North. We do, but, that is, some one should see to it\r\nthat they are stopped or put out when they get so bad the preacher has\r\nto stop his sermon for them.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Is that th way youall sit on sisters up North?\r\n\r\nKabnis: In the church I used to go to no one ever shouted\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Lungs weak?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Hardly, that is\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Yankees are right up t th minute in tellin folk how t turn a\r\ntrick. They always were good at talkin.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Well, anyway, they should be stopped.\r\n\r\nLayman: Thats right. Thats true. An its th worst ones in th community\r\nthat comes int th church t shout. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sort a made a study of it. You\r\ntake a man what drinks, th biggest licker-head around will come int th\r\nchurch an yell th loudest. An th sister whats done wrong, an is always\r\ndoin wrong, will sit down in th Amen corner an swing her arms an shout\r\nher head off. Seems as if they cant control themselves out in th world;\r\nthey cant control themselves in church. Now dont that sound logical,\r\nProfessor?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Reckon its as good as any. But I heard that queer cuss over\r\nyonder\xe2\x80\x94y know him, dont y, Kabnis? Well, y ought t. He had a run-in\r\nwith your boss th other day\xe2\x80\x94same as you\xe2\x80\x99ll have if you dont walk th\r\nchalk-line. An th quicker th better. I hate that Hanby. Ornery bastard.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll mash his mouth in one of these days. Well, as I was sayin, that\r\nfeller, Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s name, I heard him sayin somethin about a stream whats\r\ndammed has got t cut loose somewheres. An that sounds good. I know th\r\nfeelin myself. He strikes me as knowin a bucketful bout most things,\r\nthat feller does. Seems like he doesnt want t talk, an does, sometimes,\r\nlike Layman here. Damn queer feller, him.\r\n\r\nLayman: Cant make heads or tails of him, an I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lots o queer\r\npossums in my day. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s wonderin about him. White folks too.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have t leave here soon, thats sho. Always askin questions. An I\r\naint seed his lips move once. Pokin round an notin somethin. Noted what\r\nI said th other day, an that werent fer notin down.\r\n\r\nKabnis: What was that?\r\n\r\nLayman: Oh, a lynchin that took place bout a year ago. Th worst I know\r\nof round these parts.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Bill Burnam?\r\n\r\nLayman: Na. Mame Lamkins.\r\n\r\nHalsey grunts, but says nothing.\r\n\r\nThe preacher\xe2\x80\x99s voice rolls from the church in an insistent chanting\r\nmonotone. At regular intervals it rises to a crescendo note. The\r\nsister begins to shout. Her voice, high-pitched and hysterical, is\r\nalmost perfectly attuned to the nervous key of Kabnis. Halsey notices\r\nhis distress, and is amused by it. Layman\xe2\x80\x99s face is expressionless.\r\nKabnis wants to hear the story of Mame Lamkins. He does not want to\r\nhear it. It can be no worse than the shouting.\r\n\r\nKabnis (his chair rocking faster): What about Mame Lamkins?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Tell him, Layman.\r\n\r\nThe preacher momentarily stops. The choir, together with the entire\r\ncongregation, sings an old spiritual. The music seems to quiet the\r\nshouter. Her heavy breathing has the sound of evening winds that blow\r\nthrough pinecones. Layman\xe2\x80\x99s voice is uniformly low and soothing. A\r\ncanebrake, murmuring the tale to its neighbor-road would be more\r\npassionate.\r\n\r\nLayman: White folks know that niggers talk, an they dont mind jes so\r\nlong as nothing comes of it, so here goes. She was in th family-way,\r\nMame Lamkins was. They killed her in th street, an some white man seein\r\nth risin in her stomach as she lay there soppy in her blood like any\r\ncow, took an ripped her belly open, an th kid fell out. It was living;\r\nbut a nigger baby aint supposed t live. So he jabbed his knife in it an\r\nstuck it t a tree. An then they all went away.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Christ no! What had she done?\r\n\r\nLayman: Tried t hide her husband when they was after him.\r\n\r\nA shriek pierces the room. The bronze pieces on the mantel hum. The\r\nsister cries frantically: \xe2\x80\x9cJesus, Jesus, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found Jesus. O Lord,\r\nglory t God, one mo sinner is acomin home.\xe2\x80\x9d At the height of this, a\r\nstone, wrapped round with paper, crashes through the window. Kabnis\r\nsprings to his feet, terror-stricken. Layman is worried. Halsey picks\r\nup the stone. Takes off the wrapper, smooths it out, and reads: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nnorthern nigger, its time fer y t leave. Git along now.\xe2\x80\x9d Kabnis knows\r\nthat the command is meant for him. Fear squeezes him. Caves him in. As\r\na violent external pressure would. Fear flows inside him. It fills him\r\nup. He bloats. He saves himself from bursting by dashing wildly from\r\nthe room. Halsey and Layman stare stupidly at each other. The stone,\r\nthe crumpled paper are things, huge things that weight them. Their\r\nthoughts are vaguely concerned with the texture of the stone, with the\r\ncolor of the paper. Then they remember the words, and begin to shift\r\nthem about in sentences. Layman even construes them grammatically.\r\nSuddenly the sense of them comes back to Halsey. He grips Layman by the\r\narm and they both follow after Kabnis.\r\n\r\nA false dusk has come early. The countryside is ashen, chill. Cabins\r\nand roads and canebrakes whisper. The church choir, dipping into a long\r\nsilence, sings:\r\n\r\n    My Lord, what a mourning,\r\n    My Lord, what a mourning,\r\n    My Lord, what a mourning,\r\n    When the stars begin to fall.\r\n\r\nSoftly luminous over the hills and valleys, the faint spray of a\r\nscattered star...\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nA splotchy figure drives forward along the cane- and corn-stalk\r\nhemmed-in road. A scarecrow replica of Kabnis, awkwardly animate.\r\nFantastically plastered with red Georgia mud. It skirts the big house\r\nwhose windows shine like mellow lanterns in the dusk. Its shoulder jogs\r\nagainst a sweet-gum tree. The figure caroms off against the cabin door,\r\nand lunges in. It slams the door as if to prevent some one entering\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty, theyre here. After me. On me. All along the road I saw\r\ntheir eyes flaring from the cane. Hounds. Shouts. What in God\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\ndid I run here for? A mud-hole trap. I stumbled on a rope. O God, a\r\nrope. Their clammy hands were like the love of death playing up and\r\ndown my spine. Trying to trip my legs. To trip my spine. Up and down my\r\nspine. My spine... My legs... Why in hell didn\xe2\x80\x99t they catch me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis wheels around, half defiant, half numbed with a more immediate\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted to trap me here. Get out o there. I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grabs a broom from beside the chimney and violently pokes it under\r\nthe bed. The broom strikes a tin wash-tub. The noise bewilders. He\r\nrecovers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot there. In the closet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe throws the broom aside and grips the poker. Starts towards the\r\ncloset door, towards somewhere in the perfect blackness behind the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll brain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stops short. The barks of hounds, evidently in pursuit, reach him. A\r\nvoice, liquid in distance, yells, \xe2\x80\x9cHi! Hi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, theyre after me. Holy Father, Mother of Christ\xe2\x80\x94hell, this aint\r\nno time for prayer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVoices, just outside the door:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReckon he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDont see no light though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door is flung open.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Get back or I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you.\r\n\r\nHe braces himself, brandishing the poker.\r\n\r\nHalsey (coming in): Aint as bad as all that. Put that thing down.\r\n\r\nLayman: Its only us, Professor. Nobody else after y.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Halsey. Layman. Close that door. Dont light that light. For\r\ngodsake get away from there.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s after y, Kabnis, I\xe2\x80\x99m tellin y. Put that thing down an\r\nget yourself together.\r\n\r\nKabnis: I tell you they are. I saw them. I heard the hounds.\r\n\r\nHalsey: These aint th days of hounds an Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin, feller.\r\nWhite folks aint in fer all them theatrics these days. Theys more\r\ndirect than that. If what they wanted was t get y, theyd have just\r\nmarched right in an took y where y sat. Somebodys down by th branch\r\nchasin rabbits an atreein possums.\r\n\r\nA shot is heard.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Got him, I reckon. Saw Tom goin out with his gun. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\r\nlucky most times.\r\n\r\nHe goes to the bureau and lights the lamp. The circular fringe is\r\npatterned on the ceiling. The moving shadows of the men are huge\r\nagainst the bare wall boards. Halsey walks up to Kabnis, takes the\r\npoker from his grip, and without more ado pushes him into a chair\r\nbefore the dark hearth.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Youre a mess. Here, Layman. Get some trash an start a fire.\r\n\r\nLayman fumbles around, finds some newspapers and old bags, puts them\r\nin the hearth, arranges the wood, and kindles the fire. Halsey sets a\r\nblack iron kettle where it soon will be boiling. Then takes from his\r\nhip-pocket a bottle of corn licker which he passes to Kabnis.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Here. This\xe2\x80\x99ll straighten y out a bit.\r\n\r\nKabnis nervously draws the cork and gulps the licker down.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Ha. Good stuff. Thanks. Thank y, Halsey.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Good stuff! Youre damn right. Hanby there dont think so. Wonder\r\nhe doesnt come over t find out whos burnin his oil. Miserly bastard,\r\nhim. Th boys what made this stuff\xe2\x80\x94are y listenin t me, Kabnis? th boys\r\nwhat made this stuff have got th art down like I heard you say youd\r\nlike t be with words. Eh? Have some, Layman?\r\n\r\nLayman: Dont think I care for none, thank y jes th same, Mr. Halsey.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Care hell. Course y care. Everybody cares around these parts.\r\nPreachers an school teachers an everybody. Here. Here, take it. Dont\r\ntry that line on me.\r\n\r\nLayman limbers up a little, but he cannot quite forget that he is on\r\nschool ground.\r\n\r\nLayman: Thats right. Thats true, sho. Shinin is th only business what\r\npays in these hard times.\r\n\r\nHe takes a nip, and passes the bottle to Kabnis. Kabnis is in the\r\nmiddle of a long swig when a rap sounds on the door. He almost\r\nspills the bottle, but manages to pass it to Halsey just as the door\r\nswings open and Hanby enters. He is a well-dressed, smooth, rich,\r\nblack-skinned Negro who thinks there is no one quite so suave and\r\npolished as himself. To members of his own race, he affects the manners\r\nof a wealthy white planter. Or, when he is up North, he lets it be\r\nknown that his ideas are those of the best New England tradition. To\r\nwhite men he bows, without ever completely humbling himself. Tradesmen\r\nin the town tolerate him because he spends his money with them. He\r\ndelivers his words with a full consciousness of his moral superiority.\r\n\r\nHanby: Hum. Erer, Professor Kabnis, to come straight to the point: the\r\nprogress of the Negro race is jeopardized whenever the personal habits\r\nand examples set by its guides and mentors fall below the acknowledged\r\nand hard-won standard of its average member. This institution, of which\r\nI am the humble president, was founded, and has been maintained at a\r\ncost of great labor and untold sacrifice. Its purpose is to teach our\r\nyouth to live better, cleaner, more noble lives. To prove to the world\r\nthat the Negro race can be just like any other race. It hopes to attain\r\nthis aim partly by the salutary examples set by its instructors. I\r\ncannot hinder the progress of a race simply to indulge a single member.\r\nI have thought the matter out beforehand, I can assure you. Therefore,\r\nif I find your resignation on my desk by to-morrow morning, Mr. Kabnis,\r\nI shall not feel obliged to call in the sheriff. Otherwise...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis: A fellow can take a drink in his own room if he wants to, in\r\nthe privacy of his own room.\r\n\r\nHanby: His room, but not the institution\xe2\x80\x99s room, Mr. Kabnis.\r\n\r\nKabnis: This is my room while I\xe2\x80\x99m in it.\r\n\r\nHanby: Mr. Clayborn (the sheriff) can inform you as to that.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Oh, well, what do I care\xe2\x80\x94glad to get out of this mud-hole.\r\n\r\nHanby: I should think so from your looks.\r\n\r\nKabnis: You neednt get sarcastic about it.\r\n\r\nHanby: No, that is true. And I neednt wait for your resignation either,\r\nMr. Kabnis.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get that all right. Dont worry.\r\n\r\nHanby: And I should like to have the room thoroughly aired and cleaned\r\nand ready for your successor by to-morrow noon, Professor.\r\n\r\nKabnis (trying to rise): You can have your godam room right away. I\r\ndont want it.\r\n\r\nHanby: But I wont have your cursing.\r\n\r\nHalsey pushes Kabnis back into his chair.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Sit down, Kabnis, till I wash y.\r\n\r\nHanby (to Halsey): I would rather not have drinking men on the\r\npremises, Mr. Halsey. You will oblige me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: I\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige you by stayin right on this spot, this spot, get\r\nme? till I get damned ready t leave.\r\n\r\nHe approaches Hanby. Hanby retreats, but manages to hold his dignity.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Let me get you told right now, Mr. Samuel Hanby. Now listen t\r\nme. I aint no slick an span slave youve hired, an dont y think it for\r\na minute. Youve bullied enough about this town. An besides, wheres\r\nthat bill youve been owin me? Listen t me. If I dont get it paid in by\r\ntmorrer noon, Mr. Hanby (he mockingly assumes Hanby\xe2\x80\x99s tone and manner),\r\nI shall feel obliged t call th sheriff. An that sheriff\xe2\x80\x99ll be myself\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll catch y in th road an pull y out your buggy an rightly attend t\r\ny. You heard me. Now leave him alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m takin him home with me. I got\r\nit fixed. Before you came in. He\xe2\x80\x99s goin t work with me. Shapin shafts\r\nand buildin wagons\xe2\x80\x99ll make a man of him what nobody, y get me? what\r\nnobody can take advantage of. Thats all...\r\n\r\nHalsey burrs off into vague and incoherent comment.\r\n\r\nPause. Disagreeable.\r\n\r\nLayman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are glazed on the spurting fire.\r\n\r\nKabnis wants to rise and put both Halsey and Hanby in their places.\r\nHe vaguely knows that he must do this, else the power of direction\r\nwill completely slip from him to those outside. The conviction is just\r\nstrong enough to torture him. To bring a feverish, quick-passing flare\r\ninto his eyes. To mutter words soggy in hot saliva. To jerk his arms\r\nupward in futile protest. Halsey, noticing his gestures, thinks it is\r\nwater that he desires. He brings a glass to him. Kabnis slings it to\r\nthe floor. Heat of the conviction dies. His arms crumple. His upper\r\nlip, his mustache, quiver. Rap! rap, on the door. The sounds slap\r\nKabnis. They bring a hectic color to his cheeks. Like huge cold finger\r\ntips they touch his skin and goose-flesh it. Hanby strikes a commanding\r\npose. He moves toward Layman. Layman\xe2\x80\x99s face is innocently immobile.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Whos there?\r\n\r\nVoice: Lewis.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Come in, Lewis. Come on in.\r\n\r\nLewis enters. He is the queer fellow who has been referred to. A tall\r\nwiry copper-colored man, thirty perhaps. His mouth and eyes suggest\r\npurpose guided by an adequate intelligence. He is what a stronger\r\nKabnis might have been, and in an odd faint way resembles him. As he\r\nsteps towards the others, he seems to be issuing sharply from a vivid\r\ndream. Lewis shakes hands with Halsey. Nods perfunctorily to Hanby, who\r\nhas stiffened to meet him. Smiles rapidly at Layman, and settles with\r\nreal interest on Kabnis.\r\n\r\nLewis: Kabnis passed me on the road. Had a piece of business of my own,\r\nand couldnt get here any sooner. Thought I might be able to help in\r\nsome way or other.\r\n\r\nHalsey: A good baths bout all he needs now. An somethin t put his mind\r\nt rest.\r\n\r\nLewis: I think I can give him that. That note was meant for me. Some\r\nNegroes have grown uncomfortable at my being here\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: You mean, Mr. Lewis, some colored folks threw it? Christ\r\nAmighty!\r\n\r\nHalsey: Thats what he means. An just as I told y. White folks more\r\ndirect than that.\r\n\r\nKabnis: What are they after you for?\r\n\r\nLewis: Its a long story, Kabnis. Too long for now. And it might involve\r\npresent company. (He laughs pleasantly and gestures vaguely in the\r\ndirection of Hanby.) Tell you about it later on perhaps.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Youre not going?\r\n\r\nLewis: Not till my month\xe2\x80\x99s up.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Hows that?\r\n\r\nLewis: I\xe2\x80\x99m on a sort of contract with myself. (Is about to leave.)\r\nWell, glad its nothing serious\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Come round t th shop sometime why dont y, Lewis? I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked y\r\nenough. I\xe2\x80\x99d like t have a talk with y. I aint as dumb as I look. Kabnis\r\nan me\xe2\x80\x99ll be in most any time. Not much work these days. Wish t hell\r\nthere was. This burg gets to me when there aint. (In answer to Lewis\xe2\x80\x99\r\nquestion.) He\xe2\x80\x99s goin t work with me. Ya. Night air this side th branch\r\naint good fer him. (Looks at Hanby. Laughs.)\r\n\r\nLewis: I see...\r\n\r\nHis eyes turn to Kabnis. In the instant of their shifting, a vision of\r\nthe life they are to meet. Kabnis, a promise of a soil-soaked beauty;\r\nuprooted, thinning out. Suspended a few feet above the soil whose\r\ntouch would resurrect him. Arm\xe2\x80\x99s length removed from him whose will\r\nto help... There is a swift intuitive interchange of consciousness.\r\nKabnis has a sudden need to rush into the arms of this man. His eyes\r\ncall, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother.\xe2\x80\x9d And then a savage, cynical twist-about within him\r\nmocks his impulse and strengthens him to repulse Lewis. His lips curl\r\ncruelly. His eyes laugh. They are glittering needles, stitching. With a\r\nthrobbing ache they draw Lewis to. Lewis brusquely wheels on Hanby.\r\n\r\nLewis: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you, sir, a moment, if you dont mind.\r\n\r\nHanby\xe2\x80\x99s tight collar and vest effectively preserve him.\r\n\r\nHanby: Yes, erer, Mr. Lewis. Right away.\r\n\r\nLewis: See you later, Halsey.\r\n\r\nHalsey: So long\xe2\x80\x94thanks\xe2\x80\x94sho hope so, Lewis.\r\n\r\nAs he opens the door and Hanby passes out, a woman, miles down the\r\nvalley, begins to sing. Her song is a spark that travels swiftly to the\r\nnear-by cabins. Like purple tallow flames, songs jet up. They spread\r\na ruddy haze over the heavens. The haze swings low. Now the whole\r\ncountryside is a soft chorus. Lord. O Lord... Lewis closes the door\r\nbehind him. A flame jets out...\r\n\r\nThe kettle is boiling. Halsey notices it. He pulls the wash-tub from\r\nbeneath the bed. He arranges for the bath before the fire.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Told y them theatrics didnt fit a white man. Th niggers, just\r\nlike I told y. An after him. Aint surprisin though. He aint bowed t\r\nnone of them. Nassur. T nairy a one of them nairy an inch nairy a time.\r\nAn only mixed when he was good an ready\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: That song, Halsey, do you hear it?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Thats a man. Hear me, Kabnis? A man\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: Jesus, do you hear it.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Hear it? Hear what? Course I hear it. Listen t what I\xe2\x80\x99m tellin\r\ny. A man, get me? They\xe2\x80\x99ll get him yet if he dont watch out.\r\n\r\nKabnis is jolted into his fear.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Get him? What do you mean? How? Not lynch him?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Na. Take a shotgun an shoot his eyes clear out. Well, anyway, it\r\nwasnt fer you, just like I told y. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay over at th house an work\r\nwith me, eh, boy? Good t get away from his nobs, eh? Damn big stiff\r\nthough, him. An youre not th first an I can tell y. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nHe bustles and fusses about Kabnis as if he were a child. Kabnis\r\nsubmits, wearily. He has no will to resist him.\r\n\r\nLayman (his voice is like a deep hollow echo): Thats right. Thats true,\r\nsho. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s been expectin that th bust up was comin. Surprised um\r\nall y held on as long as y did. Teachin in th South aint th thing fer\r\ny. Nassur. You ought t be way back up North where sometimes I wish I\r\nwas. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve hung on down this away so long\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: An there\xe2\x80\x99ll never be no leavin time fer y.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nA month has passed.\r\n\r\nHalsey\xe2\x80\x99s workshop. It is an old building just off the main street\r\nof Sempter. The walls to within a few feet of the ground are of an\r\nage-worn cement mixture. On the outside they are considerably crumbled\r\nand peppered with what looks like musket-shot. Inside, the plaster has\r\nfallen away in great chunks, leaving the laths, grayed and cobwebbed,\r\nexposed. A sort of loft above the shop proper serves as a break-water\r\nfor the rain and sunshine which otherwise would have free entry to the\r\nmain floor. The shop is filled with old wheels and parts of wheels,\r\nbroken shafts, and wooden litter. A double door, midway the street\r\nwall. To the left of this, a work-bench that holds a vise and a variety\r\nof wood-work tools. A window with as many panes broken as whole, throws\r\nlight on the bench. Opposite, in the rear wall, a second window looks\r\nout upon the back yard. In the left wall, a rickety smoke-blackened\r\nchimney, and hearth with fire blazing. Smooth-worn chairs grouped about\r\nthe hearth suggest the village meeting-place. Several large wooden\r\nblocks, chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the\r\nmiddle of the floor. They are the supports used in almost any sort of\r\nwagon-work. Their idleness means that Halsey has no worth-while job on\r\nfoot. To the right of the central door is a junk heap, and directly\r\nbehind this, stairs that lead down into the cellar. The cellar is known\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hole.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides being the home of a very old man, it is used by\r\nHalsey on those occasions when he spices up the life of the small town.\r\n\r\nHalsey, wonderfully himself in his work overalls, stands in the doorway\r\nand gazes up the street, expectantly. Then his eyes grow listless. He\r\nslouches against the smooth-rubbed frame. He lights a cigarette. Shifts\r\nhis position. Braces an arm against the door. Kabnis passes the window\r\nand stoops to get in under Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s arm. He is awkward and ludicrous,\r\nlike a schoolboy in his big brother\xe2\x80\x99s new overalls. He skirts the large\r\nblocks on the floor, and drops into a chair before the fire. Halsey\r\nsaunters towards him.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Time f lunch.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Ya.\r\n\r\nHe stands by the hearth, rocking backward and forward. He stretches his\r\nhands out to the fire. He washes them in the warm glow of the flames.\r\nThey never get cold, but he warms them.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Saw Lewis up th street. Said he\xe2\x80\x99d be down.\r\n\r\nHalsey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes brighten. He looks at Kabnis. Turns away. Says nothing.\r\nKabnis fidgets. Twists his thin blue cloth-covered limbs. Pulls closer\r\nto the fire till the heat stings his shins. Pushes back. Pokes the\r\nburned logs. Puts on several fresh ones. Fidgets. The town bell\r\nstrikes twelve.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Fix it up f tnight?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Leave it t me.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Get Lewis in?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Tryin t.\r\n\r\nThe air is heavy with the smell of pine and resin. Green logs spurt\r\nand sizzle. Sap trickles from an old pine-knot into the flames. Layman\r\nenters. He carries a lunch-pail. Kabnis, for the moment, thinks that he\r\nis a day laborer.\r\n\r\nLayman: Evenin, gen\xe2\x80\x99lemun.\r\n\r\nBoth: Whats say, Layman.\r\n\r\nLayman squares a chair to the fire and droops into it. Several town\r\nfellows, silent unfathomable men for the most part, saunter in.\r\nOveralls. Thick tan shoes. Felt hats marvelously shaped and twisted.\r\nOne asks Halsey for a cigarette. He gets it. The blacksmith, a\r\ntremendous black man, comes in from the forge. Not even a nod from\r\nhim. He picks up an axle and goes out. Lewis enters. The town men look\r\ncuriously at him. Suspicion and an open liking contest for possession\r\nof their faces. They are uncomfortable. One by one they drift into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nLayman: Heard y was leavin, Mr. Lewis.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Months up, eh? Hell of a month I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Sorry y goin, Lewis. Just getting acquainted like.\r\n\r\nLewis: Sorry myself, Halsey, in a way\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLayman: Gettin t like our town, Mr. Lewis?\r\n\r\nLewis: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid its on a different basis, Professor.\r\n\r\nHalsey: An I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet t hear about that basis. Been waitin long enough,\r\nGod knows. Seems t me like youd take pity a feller if nothin more.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Somethin that old black cockroach over yonder doesnt like,\r\nwhatever it is.\r\n\r\nLayman: Thats right. Thats right, sho.\r\n\r\nHalsey: A feller dropped in here tother day an said he knew what you\r\nwas about. Said you had queer opinions. Well, I could have told him\r\nyou was a queer one, myself. But not th way he was driftin. Didnt mean\r\nanything by it, but just let drop he thought you was a little wrong up\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94crazy, y\xe2\x80\x99know. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nKabnis: Y mean old Blodson? Hell, he\xe2\x80\x99s bats himself.\r\n\r\nLewis: I remember him. We had a talk. But what he found queer, I think,\r\nwas not my opinions, but my lack of them. In half an hour he had\r\nsettled everything: boll weevils, God, the World War. Weevils and wars\r\nare the pests that God sends against the sinful. People are too weak to\r\ncorrect themselves: the Redeemer is coming back. Get ready, ye sinners,\r\nfor the advent of Our Lord. Interesting, eh, Kabnis? but not exactly\r\nwhat we want.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Y could have come t me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sho been after y enough. Most\r\nevery time I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen y.\r\n\r\nKabnis (sarcastically): Hows it y never came t us professors?\r\n\r\nLewis: I did\xe2\x80\x94to one.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Y mean t say y got somethin from that\r\ncelluloid-collar-eraser-cleaned old codger over in th mud hole?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Rough on th old boy, aint he? (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nLewis: Something, yes. Layman here could have given me quite a deal,\r\nbut the incentive to his keeping quiet is so much greater than anything\r\nI could have offered him to open up, that I crossed him off my mind.\r\nAnd you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: What about me?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Tell him, Lewis, for godsake tell him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him. But its\r\nsomethin else he wants so bad I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him downstairs mumblin with th\r\nold man.\r\n\r\nLewis: The old man?\r\n\r\nKabnis: What about me? Come on now, you know so much.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Tell him, Lewis. Tell it t him.\r\n\r\nLewis: Life has already told him more than he is capable of knowing. It\r\nhas given him in excess of what he can receive. I have been offered.\r\nStuff in his stomach curdled, and he vomited me.\r\n\r\nKabnis\xe2\x80\x99 face twitches. His body writhes.\r\n\r\nKabnis: You know a lot, you do. How about Halsey?\r\n\r\nLewis: Yes... Halsey? Fits here. Belongs here. An artist in your way,\r\narent you, Halsey?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Reckon I am, Lewis. Give me th work and fair pay an I aint\r\naskin nothin better. Went over-seas an saw France; an I come back. Been\r\nup North; an I come back. Went t school; but there aint no books whats\r\ngot th feel t them of them there tools. Nassur. An I\xe2\x80\x99m atellin y.\r\n\r\nA shriveled, bony white man passes the window and enters the shop. He\r\ncarries a broken hatchet-handle and the severed head. He speaks with a\r\nflat, drawn voice to Halsey, who comes forward to meet him.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay: Can y fix this fer me, Halsey?\r\n\r\nHalsey (looking it over): Reckon so, Mr. Ramsay. Here, Kabnis. A little\r\npractice fer y.\r\n\r\nHalsey directs Kabnis, showing him how to place the handle in the vise,\r\nand cut it down. The knife hangs. Kabnis thinks that it must be dull.\r\nHe jerks it hard. The tool goes deep and shaves too much off. Mr.\r\nRamsay smiles brokenly at him.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay (to Halsey): Still breakin in the new hand, eh, Halsey?\r\nSeems like a likely enough faller once he gets th hang of it.\r\n\r\nHe gives a tight laugh at his own good humor. Kabnis burns red. The\r\nback of his neck stings him beneath his collar. He feels stifled.\r\nThrough Ramsay, the whole white South weighs down upon him. The\r\npressure is terrific. He sweats under the arms. Chill beads run down\r\nhis body. His brows concentrate upon the handle as though his own life\r\nwas staked upon the perfect shaving of it. He begins to out and out\r\nbotch the job. Halsey smiles.\r\n\r\nHalsey: He\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good un some of these days, Mr. Ramsay.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay: Y ought t know. Yer daddy was a good un before y. Runs in\r\nth family, seems like t me.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Thats right, Mr. Ramsay.\r\n\r\nKabnis is hopeless. Halsey takes the handle from him. With a few deft\r\nstrokes he shaves it. Fits it. Gives it to Ramsay.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay: How much on this?\r\n\r\nHalsey: No charge, Mr. Ramsay.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay (going out): All right, Halsey. Come down an take it out in\r\ntrade. Shoe-strings or something.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Yassur, Mr. Ramsay.\r\n\r\nHalsey rejoins Lewis and Layman. Kabnis, hangdog-fashion, follows him.\r\n\r\nHalsey: They like y if y work fer them.\r\n\r\nLayman: Thats right, Mr. Halsey. Thats right, sho.\r\n\r\nThe group is about to resume its talk when Hanby enters. He is all\r\nenergy, bustle, and business. He goes direct to Kabnis.\r\n\r\nHanby: An axle is out in the buggy which I would like to have shaped\r\ninto a crow-bar. You will see that it is fixed for me.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, and knowing that Kabnis will follow, he\r\npasses out. Kabnis, scowling, silent, trudges after him.\r\n\r\nHanby (from the outside): Have that ready for me by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nyoung man. I shall call for it.\r\n\r\nKabnis (under his breath as he comes in): Th hell you say, you old\r\nblack swamp-gut.\r\n\r\nHe slings the axle on the floor.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Wheeee!\r\n\r\nLayman, lunch finished long ago, rises, heavily. He shakes hands with\r\nLewis.\r\n\r\nLayman: Might not see y again befo y leave, Mr. Lewis. I enjoys t hear\r\ny talk. Y might have been a preacher. Maybe a bishop some day. Sho do\r\nhope t see y back this away again sometime, Mr. Lewis.\r\n\r\nLewis: Thanks, Professor. Hope I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you.\r\n\r\nLayman waves a long arm loosely to the others, and leaves. Kabnis goes\r\nto the door. His eyes, sullen, gaze up the street.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Carrie K.\xe2\x80\x99s comin with th lunch. Bout time.\r\n\r\nShe passes the window. Her red girl\xe2\x80\x99s-cap, catching the sun, flashes\r\nvividly. With a stiff, awkward little movement she crosses the\r\ndoor-sill and gives Kabnis one of the two baskets which she is\r\ncarrying. There is a slight stoop to her shoulders. The curves of her\r\nbody blend with this to a soft rounded charm. Her gestures are stiffly\r\nvariant. Black bangs curl over the forehead of her oval-olive face.\r\nHer expression is dazed, but on provocation it can melt into a wistful\r\nsmile. Adolescent. She is easily the sister of Fred Halsey.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Mother says excuse her, brother Fred an Ralph, fer bein late.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Everythings all right an O.K., Carrie Kate. O.K. an all right.\r\n\r\nThe two men settle on their lunch. Carrie, with hardly a glance in the\r\ndirection of the hearth, as is her habit, is about to take the second\r\nbasket down to the old man, when Lewis rises. In doing so he draws\r\nher unwitting attention. Their meeting is a swift sun-burst. Lewis\r\nimpulsively moves towards her. His mind flashes images of her life\r\nin the southern town. He sees the nascent woman, her flesh already\r\nstiffening to cartilage, drying to bone. Her spirit-bloom, even now\r\ntouched sullen, bitter. Her rich beauty fading... He wants to\xe2\x80\x94 He\r\nstretches forth his hands to hers. He takes them. They feel like warm\r\ncheeks against his palms. The sun-burst from her eyes floods up and\r\nhaloes him. Christ-eyes, his eyes look to her. Fearlessly she loves\r\ninto them. And then something happens. Her face blanches. Awkwardly\r\nshe draws away. The sin-bogies of respectable southern colored folks\r\nclamor at her: \xe2\x80\x9cLook out! Be a _good_ girl. A _good_ girl. Look out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe gropes for her basket that has fallen to the floor. Finds it, and\r\nmarches with a rigid gravity to her task of feeding the old man. Like\r\nthe glowing white ash of burned paper, Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 eyelids, wavering, settle\r\ndown. He stirs in the direction of the rear window. From the back yard,\r\nmules tethered to odd trees and posts blink dumbly at him. They too\r\nseem burdened with an impotent pain. Kabnis and Halsey are still busy\r\nwith their lunch. They havent noticed him. After a while he turns to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLewis: Your sister, Halsey, whats to become of her? What are you going\r\nto do for her?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Who? What? What am I goin t do?..\r\n\r\nLewis: What I mean is, what does she do down there?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Oh. Feeds th old man. Had lunch, Lewis?\r\n\r\nLewis: Thanks, yes. You have never felt her, have you, Halsey? Well,\r\nno, I guess not. I dont suppose you can. Nor can she... Old man?\r\nHalsey, some one lives down there? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of him. Tell me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis takes time from his meal to answer with some emphasis:\r\n\r\nKabnis: Theres lots of things you aint heard of.\r\n\r\nLewis: Dare say. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see him.\r\n\r\nKabnis: You\xe2\x80\x99ll get all th chance you want tnight.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Fixin a little somethin up fer tnight, Lewis. Th three of us an\r\nsome girls. Come round bout ten-thirty.\r\n\r\nLewis: Glad to. But what under the sun does he do down there?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Ask Kabnis. He blows off t him every chance he gets.\r\n\r\nKabnis gives a grunting laugh. His mouth twists. Carrie returns from\r\nthe cellar. Avoiding Lewis, she speaks to her brother.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Brother Fred, father hasnt eaten now goin on th second week,\r\nbut mumbles an talks funny, or tries t talk when I put his hands ont\r\nth food. He frightens me, an I dunno what t do. An oh, I came near\r\nfergettin, brother, but Mr. Marmon\xe2\x80\x94he was eatin lunch when I saw\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94told me t tell y that th lumber wagon busted down an he wanted y t\r\nfix it fer him. Said he reckoned he could get it t y after he ate.\r\n\r\nHalsey chucks a half-eaten sandwich in the fire. Gets up. Arranges his\r\nblocks. Goes to the door and looks anxiously up the street. The wind\r\nwhirls a small spiral in the gray dust road.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Why didnt y tell me sooner, little sister?\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: I fergot t, an just remembered it now, brother.\r\n\r\nHer soft rolled words are fresh pain to Lewis. He wants to take her\r\nNorth with him. What for? He wonders what Kabnis could do for her. What\r\nshe could do for him. Mother him. Carrie gathers the lunch things,\r\nsilently, and in her pinched manner, curtsies, and departs. Kabnis\r\nlights his after-lunch cigarette. Lewis, who has sensed a change,\r\nbecomes aware that he is not included in it. He starts to ask again\r\nabout the old man. Decides not to. Rises to go.\r\n\r\nLewis: Think I\xe2\x80\x99ll run along, Halsey.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Sure. Glad t see y any time.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Dont forget tnight.\r\n\r\nLewis: Dont worry. I wont. So long.\r\n\r\nKabnis: So long. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be expectin y.\r\n\r\nLewis passes Halsey at the door. Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks form a vacant smile.\r\nHis eyes are wide awake, watching for the wagon to turn from Broad\r\nStreet into his road.\r\n\r\nHalsey: So long.\r\n\r\nHis words reach Lewis halfway to the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nNight, soft belly of a pregnant Negress, throbs evenly against the\r\ntorso of the South. Night throbs a womb-song to the South. Cane- and\r\ncotton-fields, pine forests, cypress swamps, sawmills, and factories\r\nare fecund at her touch. Night\xe2\x80\x99s womb-song sets them singing. Night\r\nwinds are the breathing of the unborn child whose calm throbbing in the\r\nbelly of a Negress sets them somnolently singing. Hear their song.\r\n\r\n    White-man\xe2\x80\x99s land.\r\n    Niggers, sing.\r\n    Burn, bear black children\r\n    Till poor rivers bring\r\n    Rest, and sweet glory\r\n    In Camp Ground.\r\n\r\nSempter\xe2\x80\x99s streets are vacant and still. White paint on the wealthier\r\nhouses has the chill blue glitter of distant stars. Negro cabins\r\nare a purple blur. Broad Street is deserted. Winds stir beneath the\r\ncorrugated iron canopies and dangle odd bits of rope tied to horse-\r\nand mule-gnawed hitching-posts. One store window has a light in it.\r\nChesterfield cigarette and Chero-Cola cardboard advertisements are\r\nstacked in it. From a side door two men come out. Pause, for a last\r\nword and then say good night. Soon they melt in shadows thicker than\r\nthey. Way off down the street four figures sway beneath iron awnings\r\nwhich form a sort of corridor that imperfectly echoes and jumbles what\r\nthey say. A fifth form joins them. They turn into the road that leads\r\nto Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s workshop. The old building is phosphorescent above deep\r\nshade. The figures pass through the double door. Night winds whisper in\r\nthe eaves. Sing weirdly in the ceiling cracks. Stir curls of shavings\r\non the floor. Halsey lights a candle. A good-sized lumber wagon, wheels\r\noff, rests upon the blocks. Kabnis makes a face at it. An unearthly\r\nhush is upon the place. No one seems to want to talk. To move, lest the\r\nscraping of their feet..\r\n\r\nHalsey: Come on down this way, folks.\r\n\r\nHe leads the way. Stella follows. And close after her, Cora, Lewis, and\r\nKabnis. They descend into the Hole. It seems huge, limitless in the\r\ncandle light. The walls are of stone, wonderfully fitted. They have no\r\nopenings save a small iron-barred window toward the top of each. They\r\nare dry and warm. The ground slopes away to the rear of the building\r\nand thus leaves the south wall exposed to the sun. The blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop is plumb against the right wall. The floor is clay. Shavings have\r\nat odd times been matted into it. In the right-hand corner, under the\r\nstairs, two good-sized pine mattresses, resting on cardboard, are on\r\neither side of a wooden table. On this are several half-burned candles\r\nand an oil lamp. Behind the table, an irregular piece of mirror hangs\r\non the wall. A loose something that looks to be a gaudy ball costume\r\ndangles from a near-by hook. To the front, a second table holds a lamp\r\nand several whiskey glasses. Six rickety chairs are near this table.\r\nTwo old wagon wheels rest on the floor. To the left, sitting in a\r\nhigh-backed chair which stands upon a low platform, the old man. He\r\nis like a bust in black walnut. Gray-bearded. Gray-haired. Prophetic.\r\nImmobile. Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 eyes are sunk in him. The others, unconcerned, are\r\nabout to pass on to the front table when Lewis grips Halsey and so\r\nturns him that the candle flame shines obliquely on the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nLewis: And he rules over\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: Th smoke an fire of th forge.\r\n\r\nLewis: Black Vulcan? I wouldnt say so. That forehead. Great woolly\r\nbeard. Those eyes. A mute John the Baptist of a new religion\xe2\x80\x94or a\r\ntongue-tied shadow of an old.\r\n\r\nKabnis: His tongue is tied all right, an I can vouch f that.\r\n\r\nLewis: Has he never talked to you?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Kabnis wont give him a chance.\r\n\r\nHe laughs. The girls laugh. Kabnis winces.\r\n\r\nLewis: What do you call him?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Father.\r\n\r\nLewis: Good. Father what?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Father of hell.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Father\xe2\x80\x99s th only name we have fer him. Come on. Lets sit down\r\nan get t th pleasure of the evenin.\r\n\r\nLewis: Father John it is from now on...\r\n\r\nSlave boy whom some Christian mistress taught to read the Bible. Black\r\nman who saw Jesus in the ricefields, and began preaching to his people.\r\nMoses- and Christ-words used for songs. Dead blind father of a muted\r\nfolk who feel their way upward to a life that crushes or absorbs them.\r\n(Speak, Father!) Suppose your eyes could see, old man. (The years hold\r\nhands. O Sing!) Suppose your lips...\r\n\r\nHalsey, does he never talk?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Na. But sometimes. Only seldom. Mumbles. Sis says he talks\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk.\r\n\r\nHalsey: First I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of it. You dont give him a chance. Sis\r\nsays she\xe2\x80\x99s made out several words, mostly one\xe2\x80\x94an like as not cause it\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9csin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKabnis: All those old fogies stutter about sin.\r\n\r\nCora laughs in a loose sort of way. She is a tall, thin, mulatto woman.\r\nHer eyes are deep-set behind a pointed nose. Her hair is coarse and\r\nbushy. Seeing that Stella also is restless, she takes her arm and the\r\ntwo women move towards the table. They slip into chairs. Halsey follows\r\nand lights the lamp. He lays out a pack of cards. Stella sorts them as\r\nif telling fortunes. She is a beautifully proportioned, large-eyed,\r\nbrown-skin girl. Except for the twisted line of her mouth when she\r\nsmiles or laughs, there is about her no suggestion of the life she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen through. Kabnis, with great mock-solemnity, goes to the corner,\r\ntakes down the robe, and dons it. He is a curious spectacle, acting a\r\npart, yet very real. He joins the others at the table. They are used\r\nto him. Lewis is surprised. He laughs. Kabnis shrinks and then glares\r\nat him with a furtive hatred. Halsey, bringing out a bottle of corn\r\nlicker, pours drinks.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Come on, Lewis. Come on, you fellers. Heres lookin at y.\r\n\r\nThen, as if suddenly recalling something, he jerks away from the table\r\nand starts towards the steps.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Where y goin, Halsey?\r\n\r\nHalsey: Where? Where y think? That oak beam in th wagon\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: Come ere. Come ere. Sit down. What in hell\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you\r\nfellers? You with your wagon. Lewis with his Father John. This aint\r\nth time fer foolin with wagons. Daytime\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough f that. Ere, sit\r\ndown. Ere, Lewis, you too sit down. Have a drink. Thats right. Drink\r\ncorn licker, love th girls, an listen t th old man mumblin sin.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no good-time spirit to the party. Something in the\r\nair is too tense and deep for that. Lewis, seated now so that his eyes\r\nrest upon the old man, merges with his source and lets the pain and\r\nbeauty of the South meet him there. White faces, pain-pollen, settle\r\ndownward through a cane-sweet mist and touch the ovaries of yellow\r\nflowers. Cotton-bolls bloom, droop. Black roots twist in a parched\r\nred soil beneath a blazing sky. Magnolias, fragrant, a trifle futile,\r\nlovely, far off... His eyelids close. A force begins to heave and\r\nrise... Stella is serious, reminiscent.\r\n\r\nStella: Usall is brought up t hate sin worse than death\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: An then before you have y eyes half open, youre made t love it\r\nif y want t live.\r\n\r\nStella: Us never\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: Oh, I know your story: that old prim bastard over yonder, an\r\nthen old Calvert\xe2\x80\x99s office\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nStella: It wasnt them\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: I know. They put y out of church, an then I guess th preacher\r\ncame around an asked f some. But thats your body. Now me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey (passing him the bottle): All right, kid, we believe y. Here,\r\ntake another. Wheres Clover, Stel?\r\n\r\nStella: You know how Jim is when he\xe2\x80\x99s just out th swamp. Done up in\r\nshine an wouldnt let her come. Said he\xe2\x80\x99d bust her head open if she went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Dont see why he doesnt stay over with Laura, where he belongs.\r\n\r\nStella: Ask him, an I reckon he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell y. More than you want.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Th nigger hates th sight of a black woman worse than death.\r\nSorry t mix y up this way, Lewis. But y see how tis.\r\n\r\nLewis\xe2\x80\x99 skin is tight and glowing over the fine bones of his face. His\r\nlips tremble. His nostrils quiver. The others notice this and smile\r\nknowingly at each other. Drinks and smokes are passed around. They pay\r\nno neverminds to him. A real party is being worked up. Then Lewis opens\r\nhis eyes and looks at them. Their smiles disperse in hot-cold tremors.\r\nKabnis chokes his laugh. It sputters, gurgles. His eyes flicker and\r\nturn away. He tries to pass the thing off by taking a long drink which\r\nhe makes considerable fuss over. He is drawn back to Lewis. Seeing\r\nLewis\xe2\x80\x99 gaze still upon him, he scowls.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Whatsha lookin at me for? Y want t know who I am? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nRalph Kabnis\xe2\x80\x94lot of good its goin t do y. Well? Whatsha keep lookin\r\nfor? I\xe2\x80\x99m Ralph Kabnis. Aint that enough f y? Want th whole family\r\nhistory? Its none of your godam business, anyway. Keep off me. Do y\r\nhear? Keep off me. Look at Cora. Aint she pretty enough t look at? Look\r\nat Halsey, or Stella. Clover ought t be here an you could look at her.\r\nAn love her. Thats what you need. I know\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLewis: Ralph Kabnis gets satisfied that way?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Satisfied? Say, quit your kiddin. Here, look at that old man\r\nthere. See him? He\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied. Do I look like him? When I\xe2\x80\x99m dead I\r\ndont expect t be satisfied. Is that enough f y, with your godam nosin,\r\nor do you want more? Well, y wont get it, understand?\r\n\r\nLewis: The old man as symbol, flesh, and spirit of the past, what do\r\nthink he would say if he could see you? You look at him, Kabnis.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Just like any done-up preacher is what he looks t me. Jam some\r\nfalse teeth in his mouth and crank him, an youd have God Almighty spit\r\nin torrents all around th floor. Oh, hell, an he reminds me of that\r\nblack cockroach over yonder. An besides, he aint my past. My ancestors\r\nwere Southern blue-bloods\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLewis: And black.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Aint much difference between blue an black.\r\n\r\nLewis: Enough to draw a denial from you. Cant hold them, can you?\r\nMaster; slave. Soil; and the overarching heavens. Dusk; dawn. They\r\nfight and bastardize you. The sun tint of your cheeks, flame of\r\nthe great season\xe2\x80\x99s multi-colored leaves, tarnished, burned. Split,\r\nshredded: easily burned. No use...\r\n\r\nHis gaze shifts to Stella. Stella\xe2\x80\x99s face draws back, her breasts come\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\nStella: I aint got nothin f y, mister. Taint no use t look at me.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Youre a queer feller, Lewis, I swear y are. Told y so, didnt I,\r\ngirls? Just take him easy though, an he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ridin just th same as any\r\nGeorgia mule, eh, Lewis? (Laughs.)\r\n\r\nStella: I\xe2\x80\x99m goin t tell y somethin, mister. It aint t you, t th Mister\r\nLewis what noses about. Its t somethin different, I dunno what. That\r\nold man there\xe2\x80\x94maybe its him\xe2\x80\x94is like m father used t look. He used t\r\nsing. An when he could sing no mo, they\xe2\x80\x99d allus come f him an carry\r\nhim t church an there he\xe2\x80\x99d sit, befo th pulpit, aswayin an aleadin\r\nevery song. A white man took m mother an it broke th old man\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\nHe died; an then I didnt care what become of me, an I dont now. I dont\r\ncare now. Dont get it in y head I\xe2\x80\x99m some sentimental Susie askin for yo\r\nsop. Nassur. But theres somethin t yo th others aint got. Boars an kids\r\nan fools\xe2\x80\x94thats all I\xe2\x80\x99ve known. Boars when their fever\xe2\x80\x99s up. When their\r\nfever\xe2\x80\x99s up they come t me. Halsey asks me over when he\xe2\x80\x99s off th job.\r\nKabnis\xe2\x80\x94it ud be a sin t play with him. He takes it out in talk.\r\n\r\nHalsey knows that he has trifled with her. At odd things he has been\r\ninwardly penitent before her tasking him. But now he wants to hurt her.\r\nHe turns to Lewis.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Lewis, I got a little licker in me, an thats true. True\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI said. True. But th stuff just seems t wake me up an make my mind a\r\nman of me. Listen. You know a lot, queer as hell as y are, an I want\r\nt ask y some questions. Theyre too high fer them, Stella an Cora an\r\nKabnis, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just excuse em. A chat between ourselves. (Turns to\r\nthe others.) Youall cant listen in on this. Twont interest y. So just\r\nleave th table t this gen\xe2\x80\x99lemun an myself. Go long now.\r\n\r\nKabnis gets up, pompous in his robe, grotesquely so, and makes as if to\r\ngo through a grand march with Stella. She shoves him off, roughly, and\r\nin a mood swings her body to the steps. Kabnis grabs Cora and parades\r\naround, passing the old man, to whom he bows in mock-curtsy. He sweeps\r\nby the table, snatches the licker bottle, and then he and Cora sprawl\r\non the mattresses. She meets his weak approaches after the manner she\r\nthinks Stella would use.\r\n\r\nHalsey contemptuously watches them until he is sure that they are\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nHalsey: This aint th sort o thing f me, Lewis, when I got work\r\nupstairs. Nassur. You an me has got things t do. Wastin time on\r\ncommon low-down women\xe2\x80\x94say, Lewis, look at her now\xe2\x80\x94Stella\xe2\x80\x94aint she\r\na picture? Common wench\xe2\x80\x94na she aint, Lewis. You know she aint. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nonly tryin t fool y. I used t love that girl. Yassur. An sometimes\r\nwhen th moon is thick an I hear dogs up th valley barkin an some old\r\nwoman fetches out her song, an th winds seem like th Lord made them\r\nfer t fetch an carry th smell o pine an cane, an there aint no big\r\njob on foot, I sometimes get t thinkin that I still do. But I want t\r\ntalk t y, Lewis, queer as y are. Y know, Lewis, I went t school once.\r\nYa. In Augusta. But it wasnt a regular school. Na. It was a pussy\r\nSunday-school masqueradin under a regular name. Some goody-goody\r\nteachers from th North had come down t teach th niggers. If you was\r\nnearly white, they liked y. If you was black, they didnt. But it wasnt\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94I was all right, y see. I couldnt stand em messin an pawin over m\r\nbusiness like I was a child. So I cussed em out an left. Kabnis there\r\nought t have cussed out th old duck over yonder an left. He\xe2\x80\x99d a been a\r\nbetter man tday. But as I was sayin, I couldnt stand their ways. So I\r\nleft an came here an worked with my father. An been here ever since.\r\nHe died. I set in f myself. An its always been; give me a good job an\r\nsure pay an I aint far from being satisfied, so far as satisfaction\r\ngoes. Prejudice is everywheres about this country. An a nigger aint\r\nin much standin anywheres. But when it comes t pottin round an doin\r\nnothing, with nothin bigger\xe2\x80\x99n an ax-handle t hold a feller down, like\r\nit was a while back befo I got this job\xe2\x80\x94that beam ought t be\xe2\x80\x94but\r\ntmorrow mornin early\xe2\x80\x99s time enough f that. As I was sayin, I gets t\r\nthinkin. Play dumb naturally t white folks. I gets t thinkin. I used\r\nto subscribe t th _Literary Digest_ an that helped along a bit. But\r\nthere werent nothing I could sink m teeth int. Theres lots I want t ask\r\ny, Lewis. Been askin y t come around. Couldnt get y. Cant get in much\r\ntnight. (He glances at the others. His mind fastens on Kabnis.) Say,\r\ntell me this, whats on your mind t say on that feller there? Kabnis\xe2\x80\x99\r\nname. One queer bird ought t know another, seems like t me.\r\n\r\nLicker has released conflicts in Kabnis and set them flowing. He pricks\r\nhis ears, intuitively feels that the talk is about him, leaves Cora,\r\nand approaches the table. His eyes are watery, heavy with passion. He\r\nstoops. He is a ridiculous pathetic figure in his showy robe.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Talkin bout me. I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m th topic of conversation everywhere\r\ntheres talk about this town. Girls an fellers. White folks as well. An\r\nif its me youre talkin bout, guess I got a right t listen in. Whats\r\nsayin? Whats sayin bout his royal guts, the Duke? Whats sayin, eh?\r\n\r\nHalsey (to Lewis): We\xe2\x80\x99ll take it up another time.\r\n\r\nKabnis: No nother time bout it. Now. I\xe2\x80\x99m here now an talkin\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nbegun. I was born an bred in a family of orators, thats what I was.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Preachers.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Na. Preachers hell. I didnt say wind-busters. Y misapprehended\r\nme. Y understand what that means, dont y? All right then, y\r\nmisapprehended me. I didnt say preachers. I said orators. O R A T O R S.\r\nBorn one an I\xe2\x80\x99ll die one. You understand me, Lewis. (He turns to\r\nHalsey and begins shaking his finger in his face.) An as f you, youre\r\nall right f choppin things from blocks of wood. I was good at that th\r\nday I ducked th cradle. An since then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shapin words after a\r\ndesign that branded here. Know whats here? M soul. Ever heard o that?\r\nTh hell y have. Been shapin words t fit m soul. Never told y that\r\nbefore, did I? Thought I couldnt talk. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell y. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shapin\r\nwords; ah, but sometimes theyre beautiful an golden an have a taste\r\nthat makes them fine t roll over with y tongue. Your tongue aint fit f\r\nnothin but t roll an lick hog-meat.\r\n\r\nStella and Cora come up to the table.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Give him a shove there, will y, Stel?\r\n\r\nStella jams Kabnis in a chair. Kabnis springs up.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Cant keep a good man down. Those words I was tellin y about,\r\nthey wont fit int th mold thats branded on m soul. Rhyme, y see? Poet,\r\ntoo. Bad rhyme. Bad poet. Somethin else youve learned tnight. Lewis\r\ndont know it all, an I\xe2\x80\x99m atellin y. Ugh. Th form thats burned int my\r\nsoul is some twisted awful thing that crept in from a dream, a godam\r\nnightmare, an wont stay still unless I feed it. An it lives on words.\r\nNot beautiful words. God Almighty no. Misshapen, split-gut, tortured,\r\ntwisted words. Layman was feedin it back there that day you thought I\r\nran out fearin things. White folks feed it cause their looks are words.\r\nNiggers, black niggers feed it cause theyre evil an their looks are\r\nwords. Yallar niggers feed it. This whole damn bloated purple country\r\nfeeds it cause its goin down t hell in a holy avalanche of words. I\r\nwant t feed th soul\xe2\x80\x94I know what that is; th preachers dont\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot t feed it. I wish t God some lynchin white man ud stick his knife\r\nthrough it an pin it to a tree. An pin it to a tree. You hear me? Thats\r\na wish f y, you little snot-nosed pups who\xe2\x80\x99ve been makin fun of me, an\r\nfakin that I\xe2\x80\x99m weak. Me, Ralph Kabnis weak. Ha.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Thats right, old man. There, there. Here, so much exertion\r\nmerits a fittin reward. Help him t be seated, Cora.\r\n\r\nHalsey gives him a swig of shine. Cora glides up, seats him, and then\r\nplumps herself down on his lap, squeezing his head into her breasts.\r\nKabnis mutters. Tries to break loose. Curses. Cora almost stifles\r\nhim. He goes limp and gives up. Cora toys with him. Ruffles his hair.\r\nBraids it. Parts it in the middle. Stella smiles contemptuously. And\r\nthen a sudden anger sweeps her. She would like to lash Cora from the\r\nplace. She\xe2\x80\x99d like to take Kabnis to some distant pine grove and nurse\r\nand mother him. Her eyes flash. A quick tensioning throws her breasts\r\nand neck into a poised strain. She starts towards them. Halsey grabs\r\nher arm and pulls her to him. She struggles. Halsey pins her arms and\r\nkisses her. She settles, spurting like a pine-knot afire.\r\n\r\nLewis finds himself completely cut out. The glowing within him\r\nsubsides. It is followed by a dead chill. Kabnis, Carrie, Stella,\r\nHalsey, Cora, the old man, the cellar, and the work-shop, the southern\r\ntown descend upon him. Their pain is too intense. He cannot stand it.\r\nHe bolts from the table. Leaps up the stairs. Plunges through the\r\nwork-shop and out into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   6\r\n\r\nThe cellar swims in a pale phosphorescence. The table, the chairs,\r\nthe figure of the old man are am\xc5\x93ba-like shadows which move about and\r\nfloat in it. In the corner under the steps, close to the floor, a\r\nsolid blackness. A sound comes from it. A forcible yawn. Part of the\r\nblackness detaches itself so that it may be seen against the grayness\r\nof the wall. It moves forward and then seems to be clothing itself in\r\nodd dangling bits of shadow. The voice of Halsey, vibrant and deepened,\r\ncalls.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Kabnis. Cora. Stella.\r\n\r\nHe gets no response. He wants to get them up, to get on the job. He is\r\nintolerant of their sleepiness.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Kabnis! Stella! Cora!\r\n\r\nGutturals, jerky and impeded, tell that he is shaking them.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Come now, up with you.\r\n\r\nKabnis (sleepily and still more or less intoxicated): Whats th big\r\nidea? What in hell\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHalsey: Work. But never you mind about that. Up with you.\r\n\r\nCora: Oooooo! Look here, mister, I aint used t bein thrown int th\r\nstreet befo day.\r\n\r\nStella: Any bunk whats worked is worth in wages moren this. But come\r\non. Taint no use t arger.\r\n\r\nKabnis: I\xe2\x80\x99ll arger. Its preposterous\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe girls interrupt him with none too pleasant laughs.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Thats what I said. Know what it means, dont y? All right, then.\r\nI said its preposterous t root an artist out o bed at this ungodly\r\nhour, when there aint no use t it. You can start your damned old work.\r\nNobody\xe2\x80\x99s stoppin y. But what we got t get up for? Fraid somebody\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee th girls leavin? Some sport, you are. I hand it t y.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Up you get, all th same.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Oh, th hell you say.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Well, son, seeing that I\xe2\x80\x99m th kind-hearted father, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give y\r\nchance t open your eyes. But up y get when I come down.\r\n\r\nHe mounts the steps to the work-shop and starts a fire in the hearth.\r\nIn the yard he finds some chunks of coal which he brings in and throws\r\non the fire. He puts a kettle on to boil. The wagon draws him. He lifts\r\nan oak-beam, fingers it, and becomes abstracted. Then comes to himself\r\nand places the beam upon the work-bench. He looks over some newly\r\ncut wooden spokes. He goes to the fire and pokes it. The coals are\r\nred-hot. With a pair of long prongs he picks them up and places them\r\nin a thick iron bucket. This he carries downstairs. Outside, darkness\r\nhas given way to the impalpable grayness of dawn. This early morning\r\nlight, seeping through the four barred cellar windows, is the color of\r\nthe stony walls. It seems to be an emanation from them. Halsey\xe2\x80\x99s coals\r\nthrow out a rich warm glow. He sets them on the floor, a safe distance\r\nfrom the beds.\r\n\r\nHalsey: No foolin now. Come. Up with you.\r\n\r\nOther than a soft rustling, there is no sound as the girls slip into\r\ntheir clothes. Kabnis still lies in bed.\r\n\r\nStella (to Halsey): Reckon y could spare us a light?\r\n\r\nHalsey strikes a match, lights a cigarette, and then bends over and\r\ntouches flame to the two candles on the table between the beds. Kabnis\r\nasks for a cigarette. Halsey hands him his and takes a fresh one for\r\nhimself. The girls, before the mirror, are doing up their hair. It is\r\nbushy hair that has gone through some straightening process. Character,\r\nhowever, has not all been ironed out. As they kneel there, heavy-eyed\r\nand dusky, and throwing grotesque moving shadows on the wall, they are\r\ntwo princesses in Africa going through the early-morning ablutions of\r\ntheir pagan prayers. Finished, they come forward to stretch their hands\r\nand warm them over the glowing coals. Red dusk of a Georgia sunset,\r\ntheir heavy, coal-lit faces... Kabnis suddenly recalls something.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Th old man talked last night.\r\n\r\nStella: An so did you.\r\n\r\nHalsey: In your dreams.\r\n\r\nKabnis: I tell y, he did. I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talkin about. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell y\r\nwhat he said. Wait now, lemme see.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Look out, brother, th old man\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting int you by way o\r\ndreams. Come, Stel, ready? Cora? Coffee an eggs f both of you.\r\n\r\nHalsey goes upstairs.\r\n\r\nStella: Gettin generous, aint he?\r\n\r\nShe blows the candles out. Says nothing to Kabnis. Then she and Cora\r\nfollow after Halsey. Kabnis, left to himself, tries to rise. He has\r\nslept in his robe. His robe trips him. Finally, he manages to stand\r\nup. He starts across the floor. Half-way to the old man, he falls and\r\nlies quite still. Perhaps an hour passes. Light of a new sun is about\r\nto filter through the windows. Kabnis slowly rises to support upon his\r\nelbows. He looks hard, and internally gathers himself together. The\r\nside face of Father John is in the direct line of his eyes. He scowls\r\nat him. No one is around. Words gush from Kabnis.\r\n\r\nKabnis: You sit there like a black hound spiked to an ivory pedestal.\r\nAn all night long I heard you murmurin that devilish word. They thought\r\nI didnt hear y, but I did. Mumblin, feedin that ornery thing thats\r\nlivin on my insides. Father John. Father of Satan, more likely. What\r\ndoes it mean t you? Youre dead already. Death. What does it mean t you?\r\nTo you who died way back there in th \xe2\x80\x99sixties. What are y throwin it\r\nin my throat for? Whats it goin t get y? A good smashin in th mouth,\r\nthats what. My fist\xe2\x80\x99ll sink int y black mush face clear t y guts\xe2\x80\x94if y\r\ngot any. Dont believe y have. Never seen signs of none. Death. Death.\r\nSin an Death. All night long y mumbled death. (He forgets the old man\r\nas his mind begins to play with the word and its associations.) Death\r\n... these clammy floors ... just like th place they used t stow away th\r\nworn-out, no-count niggers in th days of slavery ... that was long ago;\r\nnot so long ago ... no windows (he rises higher on his elbows to verify\r\nthis assertion. He looks around, and, seeing no one but the old man,\r\ncalls.) Halsey! Halsey! Gone an left me. Just like a nigger. I thought\r\nhe was a nigger all th time. Now I know it. Ditch y when it comes right\r\ndown t it. Damn him anyway. Godam him. (He looks and re-sees the old\r\nman.) Eh, you? T hell with you too. What do I care whether you can see\r\nor hear? You know what hell is cause youve been there. Its a feelin an\r\nits ragin in my soul in a way that\xe2\x80\x99ll pop out of me an run you through,\r\nan scorch y, an burn an rip your soul. Your soul. Ha. Nigger soul. A\r\ngin soul that gets drunk on a preacher\xe2\x80\x99s words. An screams. An shouts.\r\nGod Almighty, how I hate that shoutin. Where\xe2\x80\x99s th beauty in that? Gives\r\na buzzard a windpipe an I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a dollar t a dime th buzzard ud beat\r\ny to it. Aint surprisin th white folks hate y so. When you had eyes,\r\ndid you ever see th beauty of th world? Tell me that. Th hell y did.\r\nNow dont tell me. I know y didnt. You couldnt have. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk an\r\njust as good as dead, but no eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their\r\nsight. You aint got no sight. If you had, drunk as I am, I hope Christ\r\nwill kill me if I couldnt see it. Your eyes are dull and watery, like\r\nfish eyes. Fish eyes are dead eyes. Youre an old man, a dead fish man,\r\nan black at that. Theyve put y here t die, damn fool y are not t know\r\nit. Do y know how many feet youre under ground? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell y. Twenty.\r\nAn do y think you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see th light of day again, even if you wasnt\r\nblind? Do y think youre out of slavery? Huh? Youre where they used t\r\nthrow th worked-out, no-count slaves. On a damp clammy floor of a dark\r\nscum-hole. An they called that an infirmary. Th sons-a... Why I can\r\nalready see you toppled off that stool an stretched out on th floor\r\nbeside me\xe2\x80\x94not beside me, damn you, by yourself, with th flies buzzin\r\nan lickin God knows what they\xe2\x80\x99d find on a dirty, black, foul-breathed\r\nmouth like yours...\r\n\r\nSome one is coming down the stairs. Carrie, bringing food for the old\r\nman. She is lovely in her fresh energy of the morning, in the calm\r\nuntested confidence and nascent maternity which rise from the purpose\r\nof her present mission. She walks to within a few paces of Kabnis.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Brother says come up now, brother Ralph.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Brother doesnt know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talkin bout.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Yes he does, Ralph. He needs you on th wagon.\r\n\r\nKabnis: He wants me on th wagon, eh? Does he think some wooden thing\r\ncan lift me up? Ask him that.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: He told me t help y.\r\n\r\nKabnis: An how would you help me, child, dear sweet little sister?\r\n\r\nShe moves forward as if to aid him.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve more than once told you, brother\r\nRalph, an as I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you now.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Wait, Carrie. No, thats right. Youre not a child. But twont do\r\nt lift me bodily. You dont understand. But its th soul of me that needs\r\nth risin.\r\n\r\nCarrie K: Youre a bad brother an just wont listen t me when I\xe2\x80\x99m tellin\r\ny t go t church.\r\n\r\nKabnis doesnt hear her. He breaks down and talks to himself.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Great God Almighty, a soul like mine cant pin itself onto a\r\nwagon wheel an satisfy itself in spinnin round. Iron prongs an hickory\r\nsticks, an God knows what all ... all right for Halsey ... use him. Me?\r\nI get my life down in this scum-hole. Th old man an me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Has he been talkin?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Huh? Who? Him? No. Dont need to. I talk. An when I really talk,\r\nit pays th best of them t listen. Th old man is a good listener. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeaf; but he\xe2\x80\x99s a good listener. An I can talk t him. Tell him anything.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: He\xe2\x80\x99s deaf an blind, but I reckon he hears, an sees too, from\r\nth things I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard.\r\n\r\nKabnis: No. Cant. Cant I tell you. How\xe2\x80\x99s he do it?\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Dunno, except I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that th souls of old folks have a\r\nway of seein things.\r\n\r\nKabnis: An I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard them call that superstition.\r\n\r\nThe old man begins to shake his head slowly. Carrie and Kabnis watch\r\nhim, anxiously. He mumbles. With a grave motion his head nods up and\r\ndown. And then, on one of the down-swings\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFather John (remarkably clear and with great conviction): Sin.\r\n\r\nHe repeats this word several times, always the downward nodding.\r\nSurprised, indignant, Kabnis forgets that Carrie is with him.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Sin! Shut up. What do you know about sin, you old black\r\nbastard. Shut up, an stop that swayin an noddin your head.\r\n\r\nFather John: Sin.\r\n\r\nKabnis tries to get up.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Didnt I tell y t shut up?\r\n\r\nCarrie steps forward to help him. Kabnis is violently shocked at her\r\ntouch. He springs back.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Carrie! What .. how .. Baby, you shouldnt be down here. Ralph\r\nsays things. Doesnt mean to. But Carrie, he doesnt know what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalkin about. Couldnt know. It was only a preacher\xe2\x80\x99s sin they knew in\r\nthose old days, an that wasnt sin at all. Mind me, th only sin is whats\r\ndone against th soul. Th whole world is a conspiracy t sin, especially\r\nin America, an against me. I\xe2\x80\x99m th victim of their sin. I\xe2\x80\x99m what sin\r\nis. Does he look like me? Have you ever heard him say th things youve\r\nheard me say? He couldnt if he had th Holy Ghost t help him. Dont look\r\nshocked, little sweetheart, you hurt me.\r\n\r\nFather John: Sin.\r\n\r\nKabnis: Aw, shut up, old man.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Leave him be. He wants t say somethin. (She turns to the old\r\nman.) What is it, Father?\r\n\r\nKabnis: Whatsha talkin t that old deaf man for? Come away from him.\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: What is it, Father?\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s lips begin to work. Words are formed incoherently.\r\nFinally, he manages to articulate\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFather John: Th sin whats fixed... (Hesitates.)\r\n\r\nCarrie K. (restraining a comment from Kabnis): Go on, Father.\r\n\r\nFather John: ... upon th white folks\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKabnis: Suppose youre talkin about that bastard race thats roamin round\r\nth country. It looks like sin, if thats what y mean. Give us somethin\r\nnew an up t date.\r\n\r\nFather John:\xe2\x80\x94f tellin Jesus\xe2\x80\x94lies. O th sin th white folks \xe2\x80\x99mitted\r\nwhen they made th Bible lie.\r\n\r\nBoom. Boom. BOOM! Thuds on the floor above. The old man sinks back into\r\nhis stony silence. Carrie is wet-eyed. Kabnis, contemptuous.\r\n\r\nKabnis: So thats your sin. All these years t tell us that th white\r\nfolks made th Bible lie. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned. Lewis ought t have been\r\nhere. You old black fakir\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nCarrie K.: Brother Ralph, is that your best Amen?\r\n\r\nShe turns him to her and takes his hot cheeks in her firm cool hands.\r\nHer palms draw the fever out. With its passing, Kabnis crumples. He\r\nsinks to his knees before her, ashamed, exhausted. His eyes squeeze\r\ntight. Carrie presses his face tenderly against her. The suffocation of\r\nher fresh starched dress feels good to him. Carrie is about to lift her\r\nhands in prayer, when Halsey, at the head of the stairs, calls down.\r\n\r\nHalsey: Well, well. Whats up? Aint you ever comin? Come on. Whats up\r\ndown there? Take you all mornin t sleep off a pint? Youre weakenin,\r\nman, youre weakenin. Th axle an th beam\xe2\x80\x99s all ready waitin f y. Come on.\r\n\r\nKabnis rises and is going doggedly towards the steps. Carrie notices\r\nhis robe. She catches up to him, points to it, and helps him take it\r\noff. He hangs it, with an exaggerated ceremony, on its nail in the\r\ncorner. He looks down on the tousled beds. His lips curl bitterly.\r\nTurning, he stumbles over the bucket of dead coals. He savagely jerks\r\nit from the floor. And then, seeing Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon him, he swings\r\nthe pail carelessly and with eyes downcast and swollen, trudges\r\nupstairs to the work-shop. Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s gaze follows him till he is gone.\r\nThen she goes to the old man and slips to her knees before him. Her\r\nlips murmur, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLight streaks through the iron-barred cellar window. Within its soft\r\ncircle, the figures of Carrie and Father John.\r\n\r\nOutside, the sun arises from its cradle in the tree-tops of the\r\nforest. Shadows of pines are dreams the sun shakes from its eyes. The\r\nsun arises. Gold-glowing child, it steps into the sky and sends a\r\nbirth-song slanting down gray dust streets and sleepy windows of the\r\nsouthern town.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\xe2\x80\x99s Notes:\r\n - Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_).\r\n - Blank pages have been removed.\r\n - Redundant title page removed.\r\n - Silently corrected a few typographical errors.\r\n - Otherwise spelling and hyphenation left unchanged.\r\n - Ellipses period counts left unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CANE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 60093-0.txt or 60093-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/6/0/0/9/60093/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
