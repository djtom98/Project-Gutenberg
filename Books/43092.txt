She HAS lasted the night out. She has lived,\r\nRobert, to see ten minutes of the new day."\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken in the kitchen of a large country-house\r\nsituated on the west coast of Cornwall. The speakers were two of the\r\nmen-servants composing the establishment of Captain Treverton, an\r\nofficer in the navy, and the eldest male representative of an old\r\nCornish family. Both the servants communicated with each other\r\nrestrainedly, in whispers--sitting close together, and looking round\r\nexpectantly toward the door whenever the talk flagged between them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an awful thing," said the elder of the men, "for us two to be\r\nalone here, at this dark time, counting out the minutes that our\r\nmistress has left to live!"\r\n\r\n"Robert," said the other, "you have been in the service here since you\r\nwere a boy--did you ever hear that our mistress was a play-actress\r\nwhen our master married her?"\r\n\r\n"How came you to know that?" inquired the elder servant, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" cried the other, rising quickly from his chair.\r\n\r\nA bell rang in the passage outside.\r\n\r\n"Is that for one of us?" asked Mathew.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell, by the sound, which is which of those bells yet?"\r\nexclaimed Robert, contemptuously. "That bell is for Sarah Leeson. Go\r\nout into the passage and look."\r\n\r\nThe younger servant took a candle and obeyed. When he opened the\r\nkitchen-door, a long row of bells met his eye on the wall opposite.\r\nAbove each of them was painted, in neat black letters, the\r\ndistinguishing title of the servant whom it was specially intended to\r\nsummon. The row of letters began with Housekeeper and Butler, and\r\nended with Kitchen-maid and Footman\'s Boy.\r\n\r\nLooking along the bells, Mathew easily discovered that one of them was\r\nstill in motion. Above it were the words Lady\'s-Maid. Observing this,\r\nhe passed quickly along the passage, and knocked at an old-fashioned\r\noak door at the end of it. No answer being given, he opened the door\r\nand looked into the room. It was dark and empty.\r\n\r\n"Sarah is not in the housekeeper\'s room," said Mathew, returning to\r\nhis fellow-servant in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"She is gone to her own room, then," rejoined the other. "Go up and\r\ntell her that she is wanted by her mistress."\r\n\r\nThe bell rang again as Mathew went out.\r\n\r\n"Quick!--quick!" cried Robert. "Tell her she is wanted directly.\r\nWanted," he continued to himself in lower tones, "perhaps for the last\r\ntime!"\r\n\r\nMathew ascended three flights of stairs--passed half-way down a long\r\narched gallery--and knocked at another old-fashioned oak door. This\r\ntime the signal was answered. A low, clear, sweet voice, inside the\r\nroom, inquired who was waiting without? In a few hasty words Mathew\r\ntold his errand. Before he had done speaking the door was quietly and\r\nquickly opened, and Sarah Leeson confronted him on the threshold, with\r\nher candle in her hand.\r\n\r\nNot tall, not handsome, not in her first youth--shy and irresolute in\r\nmanner--simple in dress to the utmost limits of plainness--the\r\nlady\'s-maid, in spite of all these disadvantages, was a woman whom it\r\nwas impossible to look at without a feeling of curiosity, if not of\r\ninterest. Few men, at first sight of her, could have resisted the\r\ndesire to find out who she was; few would have been satisfied with\r\nreceiving for answer, She is Mrs. Treverton\'s maid; few would have\r\nrefrained from the attempt to extract some secret information for\r\nthemselves from her face and manner; and none, not even the most\r\npatient and practiced of observers, could have succeeded in\r\ndiscovering more than that she must have passed through the ordeal of\r\nsome great suffering at some former period of her life. Much in her\r\nmanner, and more in her face, said plainly and sadly: I am the wreck\r\nof something that you might once have liked to see; a wreck that can\r\nnever be repaired--that must drift on through life unnoticed,\r\nunguided, unpitied--drift till the fatal shore is touched, and the\r\nwaves of Time have swallowed up these broken relics of me forever.\r\nThis was the story that was told in Sarah Leeson\'s face--this, and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nNo two men interpreting that story for themselves, would probably have\r\nagreed on the nature of the suffering which this woman had undergone.\r\nIt was hard to say, at the outset, whether the past pain that had set\r\nits ineffaceable mark on her had been pain of the body or pain of the\r\nmind. But whatever the nature of the affliction she had suffered, the\r\ntraces it had left were deeply and strikingly visible in every part of\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHer cheeks had lost their roundness and their natural color; her lips,\r\nsingularly flexible in movement and delicate in form, had faded to an\r\nunhealthy paleness; her eyes, large and black and overshadowed by\r\nunusually thick lashes, had contracted an anxious startled look, which\r\nnever left them, and which piteously expressed the painful acuteness\r\nof her sensibility, the inherent timidity of her disposition. So far,\r\nthe marks which sorrow or sickness had set on her were the marks\r\ncommon to most victims of mental or physical suffering. The one\r\nextraordinary personal deterioration which she had undergone consisted\r\nin the unnatural change that had passed over the color of her hair. It\r\nwas as thick and soft, it grew as gracefully, as the hair of a young\r\ngirl; but it was as gray as the hair of an old woman. It seemed to\r\ncontradict, in the most startling manner, every personal assertion of\r\nyouth that still existed in her face. With all its haggardness and\r\npaleness, no one could have looked at it and supposed for a moment\r\nthat it was the face of an elderly woman. Wan as they might be, there\r\nwas not a wrinkle in her cheeks. Her eyes, viewed apart from their\r\nprevailing expression of uneasiness and timidity, still preserved that\r\nbright, clear moisture which is never seen in the eyes of the old. The\r\nskin about her temples was as delicately smooth as the skin of a\r\nchild. These and other physical signs which never mislead, showed\r\nthat she was still, as to years, in the very prime of her life. Sickly\r\nand sorrow-stricken as she was, she looked, from the eyes downward, a\r\nwoman who had barely reached thirty years of age. From the eyes\r\nupward, the effect of her abundant gray hair, seen in connection with\r\nher face, was not simply incongruous--it was absolutely startling; so\r\nstartling as to make it no paradox to say that she would have looked\r\nmost natural, most like herself, if her hair had been dyed. In her\r\ncase, Art would have seemed to be the truth, because Nature looked\r\nlike falsehood.\r\n\r\nWhat shock had stricken her hair, in the very maturity of its\r\nluxuriance, with the hue of an unnatural old age? Was it a serious\r\nillness, or a dreadful grief, that had turned her gray in the prime of\r\nher womanhood? That question had often been agitated among her\r\nfellow-servants, who were all struck by the peculiarities of her\r\npersonal appearance, and rendered a little suspicious of her, as well,\r\nby an inveterate habit that she had of talking to herself. Inquire as\r\nthey might, however, their curiosity was always baffled. Nothing more\r\ncould be discovered than that Sarah Leeson was, in the common phrase,\r\ntouchy on the subject of her gray hair and her habit of talking to\r\nherself, and that Sarah Leeson\'s mistress had long since forbidden\r\nevery one, from her husband downward, to ruffle her maid\'s\r\ntranquillity by inquisitive questions.\r\n\r\nShe stood for an instant speechless, on that momentous morning of the\r\ntwenty-third of August, before the servant who summoned her to her\r\nmistress\'s death-bed--the light of the candle flaring brightly over\r\nher large, startled, black eyes, and the luxuriant, unnatural gray\r\nhair above them. She stood a moment silent--her hand trembling while\r\nshe held the candlestick, so that the extinguisher lying loose in it\r\nrattled incessantly--then thanked the servant for calling her. The\r\ntrouble and fear in her voice, as she spoke, seemed to add to its\r\nsweetness; the agitation of her manner took nothing away from its\r\nhabitual gentleness, its delicate, winning, feminine restraint.\r\nMathew, who, like the other servants, secretly distrusted and disliked\r\nher for differing from the ordinary pattern of professed lady\'s-maids,\r\nwas, on this particular occasion, so subdued by her manner and her\r\ntone as she thanked him, that he offered to carry her candle for her\r\nto the door of her mistress\'s bed-chamber. She shook her head, and\r\nthanked him again, then passed before him quickly on her way out of\r\nthe gallery.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Mrs. Treverton lay dying was on the floor beneath.\r\nSarah hesitated twice before she knocked at the door. It was opened by\r\nCaptain Treverton.\r\n\r\nThe instant she saw her master she started back from him. If she had\r\ndreaded a blow she could hardly have drawn away more suddenly, or with\r\nan expression of greater alarm. There was nothing in Captain\r\nTreverton\'s face to warrant the suspicion of ill-treatment, or even of\r\nharsh words. His countenance was kind, hearty, and open; and the tears\r\nwere still trickling down it which he had shed by his wife\'s bedside.\r\n\r\n"Go in," he said, turning away his face. "She does not wish the nurse\r\nto attend; she only wishes for you. Call me if the doctor--" His voice\r\nfaltered, and he hurried away without attempting to finish the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nSarah Leeson, instead of entering her mistress\'s room, stood looking\r\nafter her master attentively, with her pale cheeks turned to a deathly\r\nwhiteness--with an eager, doubting, questioning terror in her eyes.\r\nWhen he had disappeared round the corner of the gallery, she listened\r\nfor a moment outside the door of the sick-room--whispered affrightedly\r\nto herself, "Can she have told him?"--then opened the door, with a\r\nvisible effort to recover her self-control; and, after lingering\r\nsuspiciously on the threshold for a moment, went in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s bed-chamber was a large, lofty room, situated in the\r\nwestern front of the house, and consequently overlooking the sea-view.\r\nThe night-light burning by the bedside displayed rather than dispelled\r\nthe darkness in the corners of the room. The bed was of the\r\nold-fashioned pattern, with heavy hangings and thick curtains drawn\r\nall round it. Of the other objects in the chamber, only those of the\r\nlargest and most solid kind were prominent enough to be tolerably\r\nvisible in the dim light. The cabinets, the wardrobe, the full-length\r\nlooking-glass, the high-backed arm-chair, these, with the great\r\nshapeless bulk of the bed itself, towered up heavily and gloomily into\r\nview. Other objects were all merged together in the general obscurity.\r\nThrough the open window, opened to admit the fresh air of the new\r\nmorning after the sultriness of the August night, there poured\r\nmonotonously into the room the dull, still, distant roaring of the\r\nsurf on the sandy coast. All outer noises were hushed at that first\r\ndark hour of the new day. Inside the room the one audible sound was\r\nthe slow, toilsome breathing of the dying woman, raising itself in its\r\nmortal frailness, awfully and distinctly, even through the far\r\nthunder-breathing from the bosom of the everlasting sea.\r\n\r\n"Mistress," said Sarah Leeson, standing close to the curtains, but not\r\nwithdrawing them, "my master has left the room, and has sent me here\r\nin his place."\r\n\r\n"Light!--give me more light."\r\n\r\nThe feebleness of mortal sickness was in the voice; but the accent of\r\nthe speaker sounded resolute even yet--doubly resolute by contrast\r\nwith the hesitation of the tones in which Sarah had spoken. The strong\r\nnature of the mistress and the weak nature of the maid came out, even\r\nin that short interchange of words spoken through the curtain of a\r\ndeath-bed.\r\n\r\nSarah lit two candles with a wavering hand--placed them hesitatingly\r\non a table by the bedside--waited for a moment, looking all round her\r\nwith suspicious timidity--then undrew the curtains.\r\n\r\nThe disease of which Mrs. Treverton was dying was one of the most\r\nterrible of all the maladies that afflict humanity, one to which women\r\nare especially subject, and one which undermines life without, in most\r\ncases, showing any remarkable traces of its corroding progress in the\r\nface. No uninstructed person, looking at Mrs. Treverton when her\r\nattendant undrew the bed-curtain, could possibly have imagined that\r\nshe was past all help that mortal skill could offer to her. The slight\r\nmarks of illness in her face, the inevitable changes in the grace and\r\nroundness of its outline, were rendered hardly noticeable by the\r\nmarvelous preservation of her complexion in all the light and delicacy\r\nof its first girlish beauty. There lay her face on the pillow--tenderly\r\nframed in by the rich lace of her cap, softly crowned by her shining\r\nbrown hair--to all outward appearance, the face of a beautiful woman\r\nrecovering from a slight illness, or reposing after unusual fatigue.\r\nEven Sarah Leeson, who had watched her all through her malady, could\r\nhardly believe, as she looked at her mistress, that the Gates of Life\r\nhad closed behind her, and that the beckoning hand of Death was\r\nsigning to her already from the Gates of the Grave.\r\n\r\nSome dog\'s-eared books in paper covers lay on the counterpane of the\r\nbed. As soon as the curtain was drawn aside Mrs. Treverton ordered her\r\nattendant by a gesture to remove them. They were plays, underscored in\r\ncertain places by ink lines, and marked with marginal annotations\r\nreferring to entrances, exits, and places on the stage. The servants,\r\ntalking down stairs of their mistress\'s occupation before her\r\nmarriage, had not been misled by false reports. Their master, after he\r\nhad passed the prime of life, had, in very truth, taken his wife from\r\nthe obscure stage of a country theatre, when little more than two\r\nyears had elapsed since her first appearance in public. The\r\ndog\'s-eared old plays had been once her treasured dramatic library;\r\nshe had always retained a fondness for them from old associations;\r\nand, during the latter part of her illness, they had remained on her\r\nbed for days and days together.\r\n\r\nHaving put away the plays, Sarah went back to her mistress; and, with\r\nmore of dread and bewilderment in her face than grief, opened her lips\r\nto speak. Mrs. Treverton held up her hand, as a sign that she had\r\nanother order to give.\r\n\r\n"Bolt the door," she said, in the same enfeebled voice, but with the\r\nsame accent of resolution which had so strikingly marked her first\r\nrequest to have more light in the room. "Bolt the door. Let no one in,\r\ntill I give you leave."\r\n\r\n"No one?" repeated Sarah, faintly. "Not the doctor? not even my\r\nmaster?"\r\n\r\n"Not the doctor--not even your master," said Mrs. Treverton, and\r\npointed to the door. The hand was weak; but even in that momentary\r\naction of it there was no mistaking the gesture of command.\r\n\r\nSarah bolted the door, returned irresolutely to the bedside, fixed her\r\nlarge, eager, startled eyes inquiringly on her mistress\'s face, and,\r\nsuddenly bending over her, said in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"Have you told my master?"\r\n\r\n"No," was the answer. "I sent for him, to tell him--I tried hard to\r\nspeak the words--it shook me to my very soul, only to think how I\r\nshould best break it to him--I am so fond of him! I love him so\r\ndearly! But I should have spoken in spite of that, if he had not\r\ntalked of the child. Sarah! he did nothing but talk of the child--and\r\nthat silenced me."\r\n\r\nSarah, with a forgetfulness of her station which might have appeared\r\nextraordinary even in the eyes of the most lenient of mistresses,\r\nflung herself back in a chair when the first word of Mrs. Treverton\'s\r\nreply was uttered, clasped her trembling hands over her face, and\r\ngroaned to herself, "Oh, what will happen! what will happen now!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s eyes had softened and moistened when she spoke of her\r\nlove for her husband. She lay silent for a few minutes; the working of\r\nsome strong emotion in her being expressed by her quick, hard, labored\r\nbreathing, and by the painful contraction of her eyebrows. Ere long,\r\nshe turned her head uneasily toward the chair in which her attendant\r\nwas sitting, and spoke again--this time in a voice which had sunk to a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n"Look for my medicine," said she; "I want it."\r\n\r\nSarah started up, and with the quick instinct of obedience brushed\r\naway the tears that were rolling fast over her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"The doctor," she said. "Let me call the doctor."\r\n\r\n"No! The medicine--look for the medicine."\r\n\r\n"Which bottle? The opiate--"\r\n\r\n"No. Not the opiate. The other."\r\n\r\nSarah took a bottle from the table, and looking attentively at the\r\nwritten direction on the label, said that it was not yet time to take\r\nthat medicine again.\r\n\r\n"Give me the bottle."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray don\'t ask me. Pray wait. The doctor said it was as bad as\r\ndram-drinking, if you took too much."\r\n\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s clear gray eyes began to flash; the rosy flush\r\ndeepened on her cheeks; the commanding hand was raised again, by an\r\neffort, from the counterpane on which it lay.\r\n\r\n"Take the cork out of the bottle," she said, "and give it to me. I\r\nwant strength. No matter whether I die in an hour\'s time or a week\'s.\r\nGive me the bottle."\r\n\r\n"No, no--not the bottle!" said Sarah, giving it up, nevertheless,\r\nunder the influence of her mistress\'s look. "There are two doses left.\r\nWait, pray wait till I get a glass."\r\n\r\nShe turned again toward the table. At the same instant Mrs. Treverton\r\nraised the bottle to her lips, drained it of its contents, and flung\r\nit from her on the bed.\r\n\r\n"She has killed herself!" cried Sarah, running in terror to the door.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said the voice from the bed, more resolute than ever, already.\r\n"Stop! Come back and prop me up higher on the pillows."\r\n\r\nSarah put her hand on the bolt.\r\n\r\n"Come back!" reiterated Mrs. Treverton. "While there is life in me, I\r\nwill be obeyed. Come back!" The color began to deepen perceptibly all\r\nover her face, and the light to grow brighter in her widely opened\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nSarah came back; and with shaking hands added one more to the many\r\npillows which supported the dying woman\'s head and shoulders. While\r\nthis was being done the bed-clothes became a little discomposed. Mrs.\r\nTreverton shuddered, and drew them up to their former position, close\r\nround her neck.\r\n\r\n"Did you unbolt the door?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I forbid you to go near it again. Get my writing-case, and the pen\r\nand ink, from the cabinet near the window."\r\n\r\nSarah went to the cabinet and opened it; then stopped, as if some\r\nsudden suspicion had crossed her mind, and asked what the writing\r\nmaterials were wanted for.\r\n\r\n"Bring them, and you will see."\r\n\r\nThe writing-case, with a sheet of note-paper on it, was placed upon\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s knees; the pen was dipped into the ink, and given to\r\nher; she paused, closed her eyes for a minute, and sighed heavily;\r\nthen began to write, saying to her waiting-maid, as the pen touched\r\nthe paper--"Look."\r\n\r\nSarah peered anxiously over her shoulder, and saw the pen slowly and\r\nfeebly form these three words: _To my Husband_.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! no! For God\'s sake, don\'t write it!" she cried, catching at\r\nher mistress\'s hand--but suddenly letting it go again the moment Mrs.\r\nTreverton looked at her.\r\n\r\nThe pen went on; and more slowly, more feebly, formed words enough to\r\nfill a line--then stopped. The letters of the last syllable were all\r\nblotted together.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" reiterated Sarah, dropping on her knees at the bedside.\r\n"Don\'t write it to him if you can\'t tell it to him. Let me go on\r\nbearing what I have borne so long already. Let the Secret die with you\r\nand die with me, and be never known in this world--never, never,\r\nnever!"\r\n\r\n"The Secret must be told," answered Mrs. Treverton. "My husband ought\r\nto know it, and must know it. I tried to tell him, and my courage\r\nfailed me. I can not trust you to tell him, after I am gone. It must\r\nbe written. Take you the pen; my sight is failing, my touch is dull.\r\nTake the pen, and write what I tell you."\r\n\r\nSarah, instead of obeying, hid her face in the bed-cover, and wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n"You have been with me ever since my marriage," Mrs. Treverton went\r\non. "You have been my friend more than my servant. Do you refuse my\r\nlast request? You do! Fool! look up and listen to me. On your peril,\r\nrefuse to take the pen. Write, or I shall not rest in my grave.\r\n_Write, or as true as there is a Heaven above us, I will come to you\r\nfrom the other world!_"\r\n\r\nSarah started to her feet with a faint scream.\r\n\r\n"You make my flesh creep!" she whispered, fixing her eyes on her\r\nmistress\'s face with a stare of superstitious horror.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, the overdose of the stimulating medicine began to\r\naffect Mrs. Treverton\'s brain. She rolled her head restlessly from\r\nside to side of the pillow--repeated vacantly a few lines from one of\r\nthe old play-books which had been removed from her bed--and suddenly\r\nheld out the pen to the servant, with a theatrical wave of the hand,\r\nand a glance upward at an imaginary gallery of spectators.\r\n\r\n"Write!" she cried, with an awful mimicry of her old stage voice.\r\n"Write!" And the weak hand was waved again with a forlorn, feeble\r\nimitation of the old stage gesture.\r\n\r\nClosing her fingers mechanically on the pen that was thrust between\r\nthem, Sarah, with her eyes still expressing the superstitious terror\r\nwhich her mistress\'s words had aroused, waited for the next command.\r\nSome minutes elapsed before Mrs. Treverton spoke again. She still\r\nretained her senses sufficiently to be vaguely conscious of the effect\r\nwhich the medicine was producing on her, and to be desirous of\r\ncombating its further progress before it succeeded in utterly\r\nconfusing her ideas. She asked first for the smelling-bottle, next\r\nfor some Eau de Cologne.\r\n\r\nThis last, poured onto her handkerchief and applied to her forehead,\r\nseemed to prove successful in partially clearing her faculties. Her\r\neyes recovered their steady look of intelligence; and, when she again\r\naddressed her maid, reiterating the word "Write," she was able to\r\nenforce the direction by beginning immediately to dictate in quiet,\r\ndeliberate, determined tones. Sarah\'s tears fell fast; her lips\r\nmurmured fragments of sentences in which entreaties, expressions of\r\npenitence, and exclamations of fear were all strangely mingled\r\ntogether; but she wrote on submissively, in wavering lines, until she\r\nhad nearly filled the first two sides of the note-paper. Then Mrs.\r\nTreverton paused, looked the writing over, and, taking the pen, signed\r\nher name at the end of it. With this effort, her powers of resistance\r\nto the exciting effect of the medicine seemed to fail her again. The\r\ndeep flush began to tinge her cheeks once more, and she spoke\r\nhurriedly and unsteadily when she handed the pen back to her maid.\r\n\r\n"Sign!" she cried, beating her hand feebly on the bed-clothes. "Sign\r\n\'Sarah Leeson, witness.\' No!--write \'Accomplice.\' Take your share of\r\nit; I won\'t have it shifted on me. Sign, I insist on it! Sign as I\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\nSarah obeyed; and Mrs. Treverton taking the paper from her, pointed to\r\nit solemnly, with a return of the stage gesture which had escaped her\r\na little while back.\r\n\r\n"You will give this to your master," she said, "when I am dead; and\r\nyou will answer any questions he puts to you as truly as if you were\r\nbefore the judgment-seat."\r\n\r\nClasping her hands fast together, Sarah regarded her mistress, for the\r\nfirst time, with steady eyes, and spoke to her for the first time in\r\nsteady tones.\r\n\r\n"If I only knew that I was fit to die," she said, "oh, how gladly I\r\nwould change places with you!"\r\n\r\n"Promise me that you will give the paper to your master," repeated\r\nMrs. Treverton. "Promise--no! I won\'t trust your promise--I\'ll have\r\nyour oath. Get the Bible--the Bible the clergyman used when he was\r\nhere this morning. Get it, or I shall not rest in my grave. Get it,\r\n_or I will come to you from the other world_."\r\n\r\nThe mistress laughed as she reiterated that threat. The maid\r\nshuddered, as she obeyed the command which it was designed to impress\r\non her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--the Bible the clergyman used," continued Mrs. Treverton,\r\nvacantly, after the book had been produced. "The clergyman--a poor\r\nweak man--I frightened him, Sarah. He said, \'Are you at peace with all\r\nthe world?\' and I said, \'All but one.\' You know who."\r\n\r\n"The Captain\'s brother? Oh, don\'t die at enmity with any body. Don\'t\r\ndie at enmity even with _him_," pleaded Sarah.\r\n\r\n"The clergyman said so too," murmured Mrs. Treverton, her eyes\r\nbeginning to wander childishly round the room, her tones growing\r\nsuddenly lower and more confused. "\'You must forgive him,\' the\r\nclergyman said. And I said, \'No, I forgive all the world, but not my\r\nhusband\'s brother.\' The clergyman got up from the bedside, frightened,\r\nSarah. He talked about praying for me, and coming back. Will he come\r\nback?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," answered Sarah. "He is a good man--he will come back--and\r\noh! tell him that you forgive the Captain\'s brother! Those vile words\r\nhe spoke of you when you were married will come home to him some day.\r\nForgive him--forgive him before you die!"\r\n\r\nSaying those words, she attempted to remove the Bible softly out of\r\nher mistress\'s sight. The action attracted Mrs. Treverton\'s attention,\r\nand roused her sinking faculties into observation of present things.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" she cried, with a gleam of the old resolution flashing once\r\nmore over the dying dimness of her eyes. She caught at Sarah\'s hand\r\nwith a great effort, placed it on the Bible, and held it there. Her\r\nother hand wandered a little over the bed-clothes, until it\r\nencountered the written paper addressed to her husband. Her fingers\r\nclosed on it, and a sigh of relief escaped her lips.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said, "I know what I wanted the Bible for. I\'m dying with\r\nall my senses about me, Sarah; you can\'t deceive me even yet." She\r\nstopped again, smiled a little, whispered to herself rapidly, "Wait,\r\nwait, wait!" then added aloud, with the old stage voice and the old\r\nstage gesture: "No! I won\'t trust you on your promise. I\'ll have your\r\noath. Kneel down. These are my last words in this world--disobey them\r\nif you dare!"\r\n\r\nSarah dropped on her knees by the bed. The breeze outside,\r\nstrengthening just then with the slow advance of the morning, parted\r\nthe window-curtains a little, and wafted a breath of its sweet\r\nfragrance joyously into the sick-room. The heavy beating hum of the\r\ndistant surf came in at the same time, and poured out its unresting\r\nmusic in louder strains. Then the window-curtains fell to again\r\nheavily, the wavering flame of the candle grew steady once more, and\r\nthe awful silence in the room sank deeper than ever.\r\n\r\n"Swear!" said Mrs. Treverton. Her voice failed her when she had\r\npronounced that one word. She struggled a little, recovered the power\r\nof utterance, and went on: "Swear that you will not destroy this paper\r\nafter I am dead."\r\n\r\nEven while she pronounced these solemn words, even at that last\r\nstruggle for life and strength, the ineradicable theatrical instinct\r\nshowed, with a fearful inappropriateness, how firmly it kept its place\r\nin her mind. Sarah felt the cold hand that was still laid on hers\r\nlifted for a moment--saw it waving gracefully toward her--felt it\r\ndescend again, and clasp her own hand with a trembling, impatient\r\npressure. At that final appeal, she answered faintly,\r\n\r\n"I swear it."\r\n\r\n"Swear that you will not take this paper away with you, if you leave\r\nthe house, after I am dead."\r\n\r\nAgain Sarah paused before she answered--again the trembling pressure\r\nmade itself felt on her hand, but more weakly this time--again the\r\nwords dropped affrightedly from her lips--\r\n\r\n"I swear it."\r\n\r\n"Swear!" Mrs. Treverton began for the third time. Her voice failed her\r\nonce more; and she struggled vainly to regain the command over it.\r\n\r\nSarah looked up, and saw signs of convulsion beginning to disfigure\r\nthe white face--saw the fingers of the white, delicate hand getting\r\ncrooked as they reached over toward the table on which the\r\nmedicine-bottles were placed.\r\n\r\n"You drank it all," she cried, starting to her feet, as she\r\ncomprehended the meaning of that gesture. "Mistress, dear mistress,\r\nyou drank it all--there is nothing but the opiate left. Let me go--let\r\nme go and call--"\r\n\r\nA look from Mrs. Treverton stopped her before she could utter another\r\nword. The lips of the dying woman were moving rapidly. Sarah put her\r\near close to them. At first she heard nothing but panting, quick-drawn\r\nbreaths--then a few broken words mingled confusedly with them:\r\n\r\n"I hav\'n\'t done--you must swear--close, close, come close--a third\r\nthing--your master--swear to give it--"\r\n\r\nThe last words died away very softly. The lips that had been forming\r\nthem so laboriously parted on a sudden and closed again no more. Sarah\r\nsprang to the door, opened it, and called into the passage for help;\r\nthen ran back to the bedside, caught up the sheet of note-paper on\r\nwhich she had written from her mistress\'s dictation, and hid it in her\r\nbosom. The last look of Mrs. Treverton\'s eyes fastened sternly and\r\nreproachfully on her as she did this, and kept their expression\r\nunchanged, through the momentary distortion of the rest of the\r\nfeatures, for one breathless moment. That moment passed, and, with the\r\nnext, the shadow which goes before the presence of death stole up and\r\nshut out the light of life in one quiet instant from all the face.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, followed by the nurse and by one of the servants, entered\r\nthe room; and, hurrying to the bedside, saw at a glance that the time\r\nfor his attendance there had passed away forever. He spoke first to\r\nthe servant who had followed him.\r\n\r\n"Go to your master," he said, "and beg him to wait in his own room\r\nuntil I can come and speak to him."\r\n\r\nSarah still stood--without moving or speaking, or noticing any one--by\r\nthe bedside.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, approaching to draw the curtains together, started at the\r\nsight of her face, and turned to the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I think this person had better leave the room, Sir?" said the nurse,\r\nwith some appearance of contempt in her tones and looks. "She seems\r\nunreasonably shocked and terrified by what has happened."\r\n\r\n"Quite right," said the doctor. "It is best that she should\r\nwithdraw.--Let me recommend you to leave us for a little while," he\r\nadded, touching Sarah on the arm.\r\n\r\nShe shrank back suspiciously, raised one of her hands to the place\r\nwhere the letter lay hidden in her bosom, and pressed it there firmly,\r\nwhile she held out the other hand for a candle.\r\n\r\n"You had better rest for a little in your own room," said the doctor,\r\ngiving her a candle. "Stop, though," he continued, after a moment\'s\r\nreflection. "I am going to break the sad news to your master, and I\r\nmay find that he is anxious to hear any last words that Mrs. Treverton\r\nmay have spoken in your presence. Perhaps you had better come with me,\r\nand wait while I go into Captain Treverton\'s room."\r\n\r\n"No! no!--oh, not now--not now, for God\'s sake!" Speaking those words\r\nin low, quick, pleading tones, and drawing back affrightedly to the\r\ndoor, Sarah disappeared without waiting a moment to be spoken to\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"A strange woman!" said the doctor, addressing the nurse. "Follow her,\r\nand see where she goes to, in case she is wanted and we are obliged to\r\nsend for her. I will wait here until you come back."\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse returned she had nothing to report but that she had\r\nfollowed Sarah Leeson to her own bedroom, had seen her enter it, had\r\nlistened outside, and had heard her lock the door.\r\n\r\n"A strange woman!" repeated the doctor. "One of the silent, secret\r\nsort."\r\n\r\n"One of the wrong sort," said the nurse. "She is always talking to\r\nherself, and that is a bad sign, in my opinion. I distrusted her, Sir,\r\nthe very first day I entered the house."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instant Sarah Leeson had turned the key of her bedroom door, she\r\ntook the sheet of note-paper from its place of concealment in her\r\nbosom--shuddering, when she drew it out, as if the mere contact of it\r\nhurt her--placed it open on her little dressing-table, and fixed her\r\neyes eagerly on the lines which the note contained. At first they swam\r\nand mingled together before her. She pressed her hands over her eyes,\r\nfor a few minutes, and then looked at the writing again.\r\n\r\nThe characters were clear now--vividly clear, and, as she fancied,\r\nunnaturally large and near to view. There was the address: "To my\r\nHusband;" there the first blotted line beneath, in her dead mistress\'s\r\nhandwriting; there the lines that followed, traced by her own pen,\r\nwith the signature at the end--Mrs. Treverton\'s first, and then her\r\nown. The whole amounted to but very few sentences, written on one\r\nperishable fragment of paper, which the flame of a candle would have\r\nconsumed in a moment. Yet there she sat, reading, reading, reading,\r\nover and over again; never touching the note, except when it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to turn over the first page; never moving, never\r\nspeaking, never raising her eyes from the paper. As a condemned\r\nprisoner might read his death-warrant, so did Sarah Leeson now read\r\nthe few lines which she and her mistress had written together not half\r\nan hour since.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the paralyzing effect of that writing on her mind lay,\r\nnot only in itself, but in the circumstances which had attended the\r\nact of its production.\r\n\r\nThe oath which had been proposed by Mrs. Treverton under no more\r\nserious influence than the last caprice of her disordered faculties,\r\nstimulated by confused remembrances of stage words and stage\r\nsituations, had been accepted by Sarah Leeson as the most sacred and\r\ninviolable engagement to which she could bind herself. The threat of\r\nenforcing obedience to her last commands from beyond the grave, which\r\nthe mistress had uttered in mocking experiment on the superstitious\r\nfears of the maid, now hung darkly over the weak mind of Sarah, as a\r\njudgment which might descend on her, visibly and inexorably, at any\r\nmoment of her future life. When she roused herself at last, and pushed\r\naway the paper and rose to her feet, she stood quite still for an\r\ninstant, before she ventured to look behind her. When she did look, it\r\nwas with an effort and a start, with a searching distrust of the empty\r\ndimness in the remoter corners of the room.\r\n\r\nHer old habit of talking to herself began to resume its influence, as\r\nshe now walked rapidly backward and forward, sometimes along the room\r\nand sometimes across it. She repeated incessantly such broken phrases\r\nas these: "How can I give him the letter?--Such a good master; so kind\r\nto us all.--Why did she die, and leave it all to _me_?--I can\'t bear\r\nit alone; it\'s too much for me." While reiterating these sentences,\r\nshe vacantly occupied herself in putting things about the room in\r\norder, which were set in perfect order already. All her looks, all her\r\nactions, betrayed the vain struggle of a weak mind to sustain itself\r\nunder the weight of a heavy responsibility. She arranged and\r\nre-arranged the cheap china ornaments on her chimney-piece a dozen\r\ntimes over--put her pin-cushion first on the looking-glass, then on\r\nthe table in front of it--changed the position of the little porcelain\r\ndish and tray on her wash-hand-stand, now to one side of the basin,\r\nand now to the other. Throughout all these trifling actions the\r\nnatural grace, delicacy, and prim neat-handedness of the woman still\r\nwaited mechanically on the most useless and aimless of her occupations\r\nof the moment. She knocked nothing down, she put nothing awry; her\r\nfootsteps at the fastest made no sound--the very skirts of her dress\r\nwere kept as properly and prudishly composed as if it was broad\r\ndaylight and the eyes of all her neighbors were looking at her.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the sense of the words she was murmuring confusedly\r\nto herself changed. Sometimes they disjointedly expressed bolder and\r\nmore self-reliant thoughts. Once they seemed to urge her again to the\r\ndressing-table and the open letter on it, against her own will. She\r\nread aloud the address, "To my Husband," and caught the letter up\r\nsharply, and spoke in firmer tones. "Why give it to him at all? Why\r\nnot let the secret die with her and die with me, as it ought? Why\r\nshould he know it? He shall _not_ know it!"\r\n\r\nSaying those last words, she desperately held the letter within an\r\ninch of the flame of the candle. At the same moment the white curtain\r\nover the window before her stirred a little, as the freshening air\r\nfound its way through the old-fashioned, ill-fitting sashes. Her eye\r\ncaught sight of it, as it waved gently backward and forward. She\r\nclasped the letter suddenly to her breast with both hands, and shrank\r\nback against the wall of the room, her eyes still fastened on the\r\ncurtain with the same blank look of horror which they had exhibited\r\nwhen Mrs. Treverton had threatened to claim her servant\'s obedience\r\nfrom the other world.\r\n\r\n"Something moves," she gasped to herself, in a breathless whisper.\r\n"Something moves in the room."\r\n\r\nThe curtain waved slowly to and fro for the second time. Still fixedly\r\nlooking at it over her shoulder, she crept along the wall to the door.\r\n\r\n"Do you come to me already?" she said, her eyes riveted on the curtain\r\nwhile her hand groped over the lock for the key. "Before your grave\r\nis dug? Before your coffin is made? Before your body is cold?"\r\n\r\nShe opened the door and glided into the passage; stopped there for a\r\nmoment, and looked back into the room.\r\n\r\n"Rest!" she said. "Rest, mistress--he shall have the letter."\r\n\r\nThe staircase-lamp guided her out of the passage. Descending\r\nhurriedly, as if she feared to give herself time to think, she reached\r\nCaptain Treverton\'s study, on the ground-floor, in a minute or two.\r\nThe door was wide open, and the room was empty.\r\n\r\nAfter reflecting a little, she lighted one of the chamber-candles\r\nstanding on the hall-table, at the lamp in the study, and ascended the\r\nstairs again to her master\'s bedroom. After repeatedly knocking at the\r\ndoor and obtaining no answer, she ventured to go in. The bed had not\r\nbeen disturbed, the candles had not been lit--to all appearance the\r\nroom had not even been entered during the night.\r\n\r\nThere was but one other place to seek him--the chamber in which his\r\nwife lay dead. Could she summon the courage to give him the letter\r\nthere? She hesitated a little--then whispered, "I must! I must!"\r\n\r\nThe direction she now compelled herself to take led her a little way\r\ndown the stairs again. She descended very slowly this time, holding\r\ncautiously by the banisters, and pausing to take breath almost at\r\nevery step. The door of what had been Mrs. Treverton\'s bedroom was\r\nopened, when she ventured to knock at it, by the nurse, who inquired,\r\nroughly and suspiciously, what she wanted there.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to my master."\r\n\r\n"Look for him somewhere else. He was here half an hour ago. He is gone\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where he has gone?"\r\n\r\n"No. I don\'t pry into other people\'s goings and comings. I mind my own\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nWith that discourteous answer, the nurse closed the door again. Just\r\nas Sarah turned away from it she looked toward the inner end of the\r\npassage. The door of the nursery was situated there. It was ajar, and\r\na dim gleam of candle-light was flickering through it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: "AND TOWARD THE OPENING THUS MADE SARAH NOW ADVANCED."]\r\n\r\nShe went in immediately, and saw that the candle-light came from an\r\ninner room, usually occupied, as she well knew, by the nursery-maid\r\nand by the only child of the house of Treverton--a little girl named\r\nRosamond, aged, at that time, nearly five years.\r\n\r\n"Can he be there?--in that room, of all the rooms in the house!"\r\n\r\nQuickly as the thought arose in her mind, Sarah raised the letter\r\n(which she had hitherto carried in her hand) to the bosom of her\r\ndress, and hid it for the second time, exactly as she had hidden it on\r\nleaving her mistress\'s bedside.\r\n\r\nShe then stole across the nursery on tiptoe toward the inner room. The\r\nentrance to it, to please some caprice of the child\'s, had been\r\narched, and framed with trellis-work, gayly colored, so as to resemble\r\nthe entrance to a summer-house. Two pretty chintz curtains, hanging\r\ninside the trellis-work, formed the only barrier between the day-room\r\nand the bedroom. One of these was looped up, and toward the opening\r\nthus made Sarah now advanced, after cautiously leaving her candle in\r\nthe passage outside.\r\n\r\nThe first object that attracted her attention in the child\'s bedroom\r\nwas the figure of the nurse-maid, leaning back, fast asleep, in an\r\neasy-chair by the window. Venturing, after this discovery, to look\r\nmore boldly into the room, she next saw her master sitting with his\r\nback toward her, by the side of the child\'s crib. Little Rosamond was\r\nawake, and was standing up in bed with her arms round her father\'s\r\nneck. One of her hands held over his shoulder the doll that she had\r\ntaken to bed with her, the other was twined gently in his hair. The\r\nchild had been crying bitterly, and had now exhausted herself, so that\r\nshe was only moaning a little from time to time, with her head laid\r\nwearily on her father\'s bosom.\r\n\r\nThe tears stood thick in Sarah\'s eyes as they looked on her master and\r\non the little hands that lay round his neck. She lingered by the\r\nraised curtain, heedless of the risk she ran, from moment to moment,\r\nof being discovered and questioned--lingered until she heard Captain\r\nTreverton say soothingly to the child:\r\n\r\n"Hush, Rosie, dear! hush, my own love! Don\'t cry any more for poor\r\nmamma. Think of poor papa, and try to comfort him."\r\n\r\nSimple as the words were, quietly and tenderly as they were spoken,\r\nthey seemed instantly to deprive Sarah Leeson of all power of\r\nself-control. Reckless whether she was heard or not, she turned and\r\nran into the passage as if she had been flying for her life. Passing\r\nthe candle she had left there, without so much as a look at it, she\r\nmade for the stairs, and descended them with headlong rapidity to the\r\nkitchen-floor. There one of the servants who had been sitting up met\r\nher, and, with a face of astonishment and alarm, asked what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"I\'m ill--I\'m faint--I want air," she answered, speaking thickly and\r\nconfusedly. "Open the garden door, and let me out."\r\n\r\nThe man obeyed, but doubtfully, as if he thought her unfit to be\r\ntrusted by herself.\r\n\r\n"She gets stranger than ever in her ways," he said, when he rejoined\r\nhis fellow-servant, after Sarah had hurried past him into the open\r\nair. "Now our mistress is dead, she will have to find another place, I\r\nsuppose. I, for one, sha\'n\'t break my heart when she\'s gone. Shall\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE HIDING OF THE SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cool, sweet air in the garden, blowing freshly over Sarah\'s face,\r\nseemed to calm the violence of her agitation. She turned down a side\r\nwalk, which led to a terrace and overlooked the church of the\r\nneighboring village.\r\n\r\nThe daylight out of doors was clear already. The misty auburn light\r\nthat goes before sunrise was flowing up, peaceful and lovely, behind a\r\nline of black-brown moorland, over all the eastern sky. The old\r\nchurch, with the hedge of myrtle and fuchsia growing round the little\r\ncemetery in all the luxuriance which is only seen in Cornwall, was\r\nclearing and brightening to view, almost as fast as the morning\r\nfirmament itself. Sarah leaned her arms heavily on the back of a\r\ngarden-seat, and turned her face toward the church. Her eyes wandered\r\nfrom the building itself to the cemetery by its side, rested there,\r\nand watched the light growing warmer and warmer over the lonesome\r\nrefuge where the dead lay at rest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my heart! my heart!" she said. "What must it be made of not to\r\nbreak?"\r\n\r\nShe remained for some time leaning on the seat, looking sadly toward\r\nthe church-yard, and pondering over the words which she had heard\r\nCaptain Treverton say to the child. They seemed to connect themselves,\r\nas every thing else now appeared to connect itself in her mind, with\r\nthe letter that had been written on Mrs. Treverton\'s death-bed. She\r\ndrew it from her bosom once more, and crushed it up angrily in her\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"Still in my hands! still not seen by any eyes but mine!" she said,\r\nlooking down at the crumpled pages. "Is it all my fault? If she was\r\nalive now--if she had seen what I saw, if she had heard what I heard\r\nin the nursery--could she expect me to give him the letter?"\r\n\r\nHer mind was apparently steadied by the reflection which her last\r\nwords expressed. She moved away thoughtfully from the garden-seat,\r\ncrossed the terrace, descended some wooden steps, and followed a\r\nshrubbery path which led round by a winding track from the east to the\r\nnorth side of the house.\r\n\r\nThis part of the building had been uninhabited and neglected for more\r\nthan half a century past. In the time of Captain Treverton\'s father\r\nthe whole range of the north rooms had been stripped of their finest\r\npictures and their most valuable furniture, to assist in redecorating\r\nthe west rooms, which now formed the only inhabited part of the house,\r\nand which were amply sufficient for the accommodation of the family\r\nand of any visitors who came to stay with them. The mansion had been\r\noriginally built in the form of a square, and had been strongly\r\nfortified. Of the many defenses of the place, but one now remained--a\r\nheavy, low tower (from which and from the village near, the house\r\nderived its name of Porthgenna Tower), standing at the southern\r\nextremity of the west front. The south side itself consisted of\r\nstables and out-houses, with a ruinous wall in front of them, which,\r\nrunning back eastward at right angles, joined the north side, and so\r\ncompleted the square which the whole outline of the building\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe outside view of the range of north rooms, from the weedy, deserted\r\ngarden below, showed plainly enough that many years had passed since\r\nany human creature had inhabited them. The window-panes were broken\r\nin some places, and covered thickly with dirt and dust in others.\r\nHere, the shutters were closed--there, they were only half opened. The\r\nuntrained ivy, the rank vegetation growing in fissures of the\r\nstone-work, the festoons of spiders\' webs, the rubbish of wood,\r\nbricks, plaster, broken glass, rags, and strips of soiled cloth, which\r\nlay beneath the windows, all told the same tale of neglect. Shadowed\r\nby its position, this ruinous side of the house had a dark, cold,\r\nwintry aspect, even on the sunny August morning when Sarah Leeson\r\nstrayed into the deserted northern garden. Lost in the labyrinth of\r\nher own thoughts, she moved slowly past flower-beds, long since rooted\r\nup, and along gravel walks overgrown by weeds; her eyes wandering\r\nmechanically over the prospect, her feet mechanically carrying her on\r\nwherever there was a trace of a footpath, lead where it might.\r\n\r\nThe shock which the words spoken by her master in the nursery had\r\ncommunicated to her mind, had set her whole nature, so to speak, at\r\nbay, and had roused in her, at last, the moral courage to arm herself\r\nwith a final and desperate resolution. Wandering more and more slowly\r\nalong the pathways of the forsaken garden, as the course of her ideas\r\nwithdrew her more and more completely from all outward things, she\r\nstopped insensibly on an open patch of ground, which had once been a\r\nwell-kept lawn, and which still commanded a full view of the long\r\nrange of uninhabited north rooms.\r\n\r\n"What binds me to give the letter to my master at all?" she thought to\r\nherself, smoothing out the crumpled paper dreamily in the palm of her\r\nhand. "My mistress died without making me swear to do that. Can she\r\nvisit it on me from the other world, if I keep the promises I swore to\r\nobserve, and do no more? May I not risk the worst that can happen, so\r\nlong as I hold religiously to all that I undertook to do on my oath?"\r\n\r\nShe paused here in reasoning with herself--her superstitious fears\r\nstill influencing her out of doors, in the daylight, as they had\r\ninfluenced her in her own room, in the time of darkness. She\r\npaused--then fell to smoothing the letter again, and began to recall\r\nthe terms of the solemn engagement which Mrs. Treverton had forced her\r\nto contract.\r\n\r\nWhat had she actually bound herself to do? Not to destroy the letter,\r\nand not to take it away with her if she left the house. Beyond that,\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s desire had been that the letter should be given to\r\nher husband. Was that last wish binding on the person to whom it had\r\nbeen confided? Yes. As binding as an oath? No.\r\n\r\nAs she arrived at that conclusion, she looked up.\r\n\r\nAt first her eyes rested vacantly on the lonely, deserted north front\r\nof the house; gradually they became attracted by one particular window\r\nexactly in the middle, on the floor above the ground--the largest and\r\nthe gloomiest of all the row; suddenly they brightened with an\r\nexpression of intelligence. She started; a faint flush of color flew\r\ninto her cheeks, and she hastily advanced closer to the wall of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe panes of the large window were yellow with dust and dirt, and\r\nfestooned about fantastically with cobwebs. Below it was a heap of\r\nrubbish, scattered over the dry mould of what might once have been a\r\nbed of flowers or shrubs. The form of the bed was still marked out by\r\nan oblong boundary of weeds and rank grass. She followed it\r\nirresolutely all round, looking up at the window at every step--then\r\nstopped close under it, glanced at the letter in her hand, and said to\r\nherself abruptly--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll risk it!"\r\n\r\nAs the words fell from her lips, she hastened back to the inhabited\r\npart of the house, followed the passage on the kitchen-floor which led\r\nto the housekeeper\'s room, entered it, and took down from a nail in\r\nthe wall a bunch of keys, having a large ivory label attached to the\r\nring that connected them, on which was inscribed, "Keys of the North\r\nRooms."\r\n\r\nShe placed the keys on a writing-table near her, took up a pen, and\r\nrapidly added these lines on the blank side of the letter which she\r\nhad written under her mistress\'s dictation--\r\n\r\n     "If this paper should ever be found (which I pray with my\r\n     whole heart it never may be), I wish to say that I have\r\n     come to the resolution of hiding it, because I dare not\r\n     show the writing that it contains to my master, to whom it\r\n     is addressed. In doing what I now propose to do, though I\r\n     am acting against my mistress\'s last wishes, I am not\r\n     breaking the solemn engagement which she obliged me to\r\n     make before her on her death-bed. That engagement forbids\r\n     me to destroy this letter, or to take it away with me if I\r\n     leave the house. I shall do neither--my purpose is to\r\n     conceal it in the place, of all others, where I think there\r\n     is least chance of its ever being found again. Any hardship\r\n     or misfortune which may follow as a consequence of this\r\n     deceitful proceeding on my part, will fall on myself.\r\n     Others, I believe in my conscience, will be the happier for\r\n     the hiding of the dreadful Secret which this letter\r\n     contains."\r\n\r\nShe signed those lines with her name--pressed them hurriedly over the\r\nblotting-pad that lay with the rest of the writing materials on the\r\ntable--took the note in her hand, after first folding it up--and then,\r\nsnatching at the bunch of keys, with a look all round her as if she\r\ndreaded being secretly observed, left the room. All her actions since\r\nshe had entered it had been hasty and sudden; she was evidently afraid\r\nof allowing herself one leisure moment to reflect.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the housekeeper\'s room, she turned to the left, ascended a\r\nback staircase, and unlocked a door at the top of it. A cloud of dust\r\nflew all about her as she softly opened the door; a mouldy coolness\r\nmade her shiver as she crossed a large stone hall, with some black old\r\nfamily portraits hanging on the walls, the canvases of which were\r\nbulging out of the frames. Ascending more stairs, she came upon a row\r\nof doors, all leading into rooms on the first floor of the north side\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nShe knelt down, putting the letter on the boards beside her, opposite\r\nthe key-hole of the fourth door she came to after reaching the top of\r\nthe stairs, peered in distrustfully for an instant, then began to try\r\nthe different keys till she found one that fitted the lock. She had\r\ngreat difficulty in accomplishing this, from the violence of her\r\nagitation, which made her hands tremble to such a degree that she was\r\nhardly able to keep the keys separate one from the other. At length\r\nshe succeeded in opening the door. Thicker clouds of dust than she had\r\nyet met with flew out the moment the interior of the room was visible;\r\na dry, airless, suffocating atmosphere almost choked her as she\r\nstooped to pick up the letter from the floor. She recoiled from it at\r\nfirst, and took a few steps back toward the staircase. But she\r\nrecovered her resolution immediately.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go back now!" she said, desperately, and entered the room.\r\n\r\nShe did not remain in it more than two or three minutes. When she came\r\nout again her face was white with fear, and the hand which had held\r\nthe letter when she went into the room held nothing now but a small\r\nrusty key.\r\n\r\nAfter locking the door again, she examined the large bunch of keys\r\nwhich she had taken from the housekeeper\'s room, with closer attention\r\nthan she had yet bestowed on them. Besides the ivory label attached to\r\nthe ring that connected them, there were smaller labels, of parchment,\r\ntied to the handles of some of the keys, to indicate the rooms to\r\nwhich they gave admission. The particular key which she had used had\r\none of these labels hanging to it. She held the little strip of\r\nparchment close to the light, and read on it, in written characters\r\nfaded by time--\r\n\r\n"_The Myrtle Room._"\r\n\r\nThe room in which the letter was hidden had a name, then! A prettily\r\nsounding name that would attract most people, and keep pleasantly in\r\ntheir memories. A name to be distrusted by her, after what she had\r\ndone, on that very account.\r\n\r\nShe took her housewife from its usual place in the pocket of her\r\napron, and, with the scissors which it contained, cut the label from\r\nthe key. Was it enough to destroy that one only? She lost herself in a\r\nmaze of useless conjecture; and ended by cutting off the other labels,\r\nfrom no other motive than instinctive suspicion of them.\r\n\r\nCarefully gathering up the strips of parchment from the floor, she put\r\nthem, along with the little rusty key which she had brought out of the\r\nMyrtle Room, in the empty pocket of her apron. Then, carrying the\r\nlarge bunch of keys in her hand, and carefully locking the doors that\r\nshe had opened on her way to the north side of Porthgenna Tower, she\r\nretraced her steps to the housekeeper\'s room, entered it without\r\nseeing any body, and hung up the bunch of keys again on the nail in\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nFearful, as the morning hours wore on, of meeting with some of the\r\nfemale servants, she next hastened back to her bedroom. The candle\r\nshe had left there was still burning feebly in the fresh daylight.\r\nWhen she drew aside the window-curtain, after extinguishing the\r\ncandle, a shadow of her former fear passed over her face, even in the\r\nbroad daylight that now flowed in upon it. She opened the window, and\r\nleaned out eagerly into the cool air.\r\n\r\nWhether for good or for evil, the fatal Secret was hidden now--the act\r\nwas done. There was something calming in the first consciousness of\r\nthat one fact. She could think more composedly, after that, of\r\nherself, and of the uncertain future that lay before her.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances could she have expected to remain in her\r\nsituation, now that the connection between herself and her mistress\r\nhad been severed by death. She knew that Mrs. Treverton, in the last\r\ndays of her illness, had earnestly recommended her maid to Captain\r\nTreverton\'s kindness and protection, and she felt assured that the\r\nwife\'s last entreaties, in this as in all other instances, would be\r\nviewed as the most sacred of obligations by the husband. But could she\r\naccept protection and kindness at the hand of the master whom she had\r\nbeen accessory to deceiving, and whom she had now committed herself to\r\ndeceiving still? The bare idea of such baseness was so revolting, that\r\nshe accepted, almost with a sense of relief, the one sad alternative\r\nthat remained--the alternative of leaving the house immediately.\r\n\r\nAnd how was she to leave it? By giving formal warning, and so exposing\r\nherself to questions which would be sure to confuse and terrify her?\r\nCould she venture to face her master again, after what she had\r\ndone--to face him, when his first inquiries would refer to her\r\nmistress, when he would be certain to ask her for the last mournful\r\ndetails, for the slightest word that had been spoken during the\r\ndeath-scene that she alone had witnessed? She started to her feet, as\r\nthe certain consequences of submitting herself to that unendurable\r\ntrial all crowded together warningly on her mind, took her cloak from\r\nits place on the wall, and listened at her door in sudden suspicion\r\nand fear. Had she heard footsteps? Was her master sending for her\r\nalready?\r\n\r\nNo; all was silent outside. A few tears rolled over her cheeks as she\r\nput on her bonnet, and felt that she was facing, by the performance of\r\nthat simple action, the last, and perhaps the hardest to meet, of the\r\ncruel necessities in which the hiding of the Secret had involved her.\r\nThere was no help for it. She must run the risk of betraying every\r\nthing, or brave the double trial of leaving Porthgenna Tower, and\r\nleaving it secretly.\r\n\r\nSecretly--as a thief might go? Without a word to her master? without\r\nso much as one line of writing to thank him for his kindness and to\r\nask his pardon? She had unlocked her desk, and had taken from it her\r\npurse, one or two letters, and a little book of Wesley\'s Hymns, before\r\nthese considerations occurred to her. They made her pause in the act\r\nof shutting up the desk. "Shall I write?" she asked herself, "and\r\nleave the letter here, to be found when I am gone?"\r\n\r\nA little more reflection decided her in the affirmative. As rapidly as\r\nher pen could form the letters, she wrote a few lines addressed to\r\nCaptain Treverton, in which she confessed to having kept a secret from\r\nhis knowledge which had been left in her charge to divulge; adding,\r\nthat she honestly believed no harm could come to him, or to any one in\r\nwhom he was interested, by her failing to perform the duty intrusted\r\nto her; and ended by asking his pardon for leaving the house secretly,\r\nand by begging, as a last favor, that no search might ever be made for\r\nher. Having sealed this short note, and left it on her table, with her\r\nmaster\'s name written outside, she listened again at the door; and,\r\nafter satisfying herself that no one was yet stirring, began to\r\ndescend the stairs at Porthgenna Tower for the last time.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the passage leading to the nursery she stopped. The\r\ntears which she had restrained since leaving her room began to flow\r\nagain. Urgent as her reasons now were for effecting her departure\r\nwithout a moment\'s loss of time, she advanced, with the strangest\r\ninconsistency, a few steps toward the nursery door. Before she had\r\ngone far, a slight noise in the lower part of the house caught her ear\r\nand instantly checked her further progress.\r\n\r\nWhile she stood doubtful, the grief at her heart--a greater grief than\r\nany she had yet betrayed--rose irresistibly to her lips, and burst\r\nfrom them in one deep gasping sob. The sound of it seemed to terrify\r\nher into a sense of the danger of her position, if she delayed a\r\nmoment longer. She ran out again to the stairs, reached the\r\nkitchen-floor in safety, and made her escape by the garden door which\r\nthe servant had opened for her at the dawn of the morning.\r\n\r\nOn getting clear of the premises at Porthgenna Tower, instead of\r\ntaking the nearest path over the moor that led to the high-road, she\r\ndiverged to the church; but stopped before she came to it, at the\r\npublic well of the neighborhood, which had been sunk near the cottages\r\nof the Porthgenna fishermen. Cautiously looking round her, she dropped\r\ninto the well the little rusty key which she had brought out of the\r\nMyrtle Room; then hurried on, and entered the church-yard. She\r\ndirected her course straight to one of the graves, situated a little\r\napart from the rest. On the head-stone were inscribed these words:\r\n\r\n     SACRED TO THE MEMORY\r\n     OF\r\n     HUGH POLWHEAL,\r\n     AGED 26 YEARS.\r\n     HE MET WITH HIS DEATH\r\n     THROUGH THE FALL OF A ROCK\r\n     IN\r\n     PORTHGENNA MINE,\r\n     DECEMBER 17TH, 1823.\r\n\r\nGathering a few leaves of grass from the grave, Sarah opened the\r\nlittle book of Wesley\'s Hymns which she had brought with her from the\r\nbedroom of Porthgenna Tower, and placed the leaves delicately and\r\ncarefully between the pages. As she did this, the wind blew open the\r\ntitle-page of the Hymns, and displayed this inscription on it, written\r\nin large, clumsy characters--"Sarah Leeson, her book. The gift of Hugh\r\nPolwheal."\r\n\r\nHaving secured the blades of grass between the pages of the book, she\r\nretraced her way toward the path leading to the high-road. Arrived on\r\nthe moor, she took out of her apron pocket the parchment labels that\r\nhad been cut from the keys, and scattered them under the furze-bushes.\r\n\r\n"Gone," she said, "as I am gone! God help and forgive me--it is all\r\ndone and over now!"\r\n\r\nWith those words she turned her back on the old house and the\r\nsea-view below it, and followed the moorland path on her way to the\r\nhigh-road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFour hours afterward Captain Treverton desired one of the servants at\r\nPorthgenna Tower to inform Sarah Leeson that he wished to hear all she\r\nhad to tell him of the dying moments of her mistress. The messenger\r\nreturned with looks and words of amazement, and with the letter that\r\nSarah had addressed to her master in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe moment Captain Treverton had read the letter, he ordered an\r\nimmediate search to be made after the missing woman. She was so easy\r\nto describe and to recognize, by the premature grayness of her hair,\r\nby the odd, scared look in her eyes, and by her habit of constantly\r\ntalking to herself, that she was traced with certainty as far as\r\nTruro. In that large town the track of her was lost, and never\r\nrecovered again.\r\n\r\nRewards were offered; the magistrates of the district were interested\r\nin the case; all that wealth and power could do to discover her was\r\ndone--and done in vain. No clew was found to suggest a suspicion of\r\nher whereabouts, or to help in the slightest degree toward explaining\r\nthe nature of the secret at which she had hinted in her letter. Her\r\nmaster never saw her again, never heard of her again, after the\r\nmorning of the twenty-third of August, eighteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN YEARS AFTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church of Long Beckley (a large agricultural village in one of the\r\nmidland counties of England), although a building in no way remarkable\r\neither for its size, its architecture, or its antiquity, possesses,\r\nnevertheless, one advantage which mercantile London has barbarously\r\ndenied to the noble cathedral church of St. Paul. It has plenty of\r\nroom to stand in, and it can consequently be seen with perfect\r\nconvenience from every point of view, all around the compass.\r\n\r\nThe large open space around the church can be approached in three\r\ndifferent directions. There is a road from the village, leading\r\nstraight to the principal door. There is a broad gravel walk, which\r\nbegins at the vicarage gates, crosses the church-yard, and stops, as\r\nin duty bound, at the vestry entrance. There is a footpath over the\r\nfields, by which the lord of the manor, and the gentry in general who\r\nlive in his august neighborhood, can reach the side door of the\r\nbuilding, whenever their natural humility may incline them to\r\nencourage Sabbath observance in the stables by going to church, like\r\nthe lower sort of worshipers, on their own legs.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven o\'clock, on a certain fine summer morning, in the\r\nyear eighteen hundred and forty-four, if any observant stranger had\r\nhappened to be standing in some unnoticed corner of the church-yard,\r\nand to be looking about him with sharp eyes, he would probably have\r\nbeen the witness of proceedings which might have led him to believe\r\nthat there was a conspiracy going on in Long Beckley, of which the\r\nchurch was the rallying-point, and some of the most respectable\r\ninhabitants the principal leaders. Supposing him to have been looking\r\ntoward the vicarage as the clock chimed the half-hour, he would have\r\nseen the vicar of Long Beckley, the Reverend Doctor Chennery, leaving\r\nhis house suspiciously, by the back way, glancing behind him guiltily\r\nas he approached the gravel walk that led to the vestry, stopping\r\nmysteriously just outside the door, and gazing anxiously down the road\r\nthat led from the village.\r\n\r\nAssuming that our observant stranger would, upon this, keep out of\r\nsight, and look down the road, like the vicar, he would next have seen\r\nthe clerk of the church--an austere, yellow-faced man--a Protestant\r\nLoyola in appearance, and a working shoemaker by trade--approaching\r\nwith a look of unutterable mystery in his face, and a bunch of big\r\nkeys in his hands. He would have seen the vicar nod in an abstracted\r\nmanner to the clerk, and say, "Fine morning, Thomas. Have you had your\r\nbreakfast yet?" He would have heard Thomas reply, with a suspicious\r\nregard for minute particulars: "I have had a cup of tea and a crust,\r\nSir." And he would then have seen these two local conspirators, after\r\nlooking up with one accord at the church clock, draw off together to\r\nthe side door which commanded a view of the footpath across the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nFollowing them--as our inquisitive stranger could not fail to do--he\r\nwould have detected three more conspirators advancing along the\r\nfootpath. The leader of this treasonable party was an elderly\r\ngentleman, with a weather-beaten face and a bluff, hearty manner. His\r\ntwo followers were a young gentleman and a young lady, walking\r\narm-in-arm, and talking together in whispers. They were dressed in the\r\nplainest morning costume. The faces of both were rather pale, and the\r\nmanner of the lady was a little flurried. Otherwise there was nothing\r\nremarkable to observe in them, until they came to the wicket-gate\r\nleading into the church-yard; and there the conduct of the young\r\ngentleman seemed, at first sight, rather inexplicable. Instead of\r\nholding the gate open for the lady to pass through, he hung back,\r\nallowed her to open it for herself, waited till she had got to the\r\nchurch-yard side, and then, stretching out his hand over the gate,\r\nallowed her to lead him through the entrance, as if he had suddenly\r\nchanged from a grown man to a helpless little child.\r\n\r\nNoting this, and remarking also that, when the party from the fields had\r\narrived within greeting distance of the vicar, and when the clerk had\r\nused his bunch of keys to open the church-door, the young lady\'s\r\ncompanion was led into the building (this time by Doctor Chennery\'s hand),\r\nas he had been previously led through the wicket-gate, our observant\r\nstranger must have arrived at one inevitable conclusion--that the\r\nperson requiring such assistance as this was suffering under the\r\naffliction of blindness. Startled a little by that discovery, he would\r\nhave been still further amazed, if he had looked into the church, by\r\nseeing the blind man and the young lady standing together before the\r\naltar rails, with the elderly gentleman in parental attendance. Any\r\nsuspicions he might now entertain that the bond which united the\r\nconspirators at that early hour of the morning was of the hymeneal\r\nsort, and that the object of their plot was to celebrate a wedding\r\nwith the strictest secrecy, would have been confirmed in five minutes\r\nby the appearance of Doctor Chennery from the vestry in full\r\ncanonicals, and by the reading of the marriage service in the reverend\r\ngentleman\'s most harmonious officiating tones. The ceremony concluded,\r\nthe attendant stranger must have been more perplexed than ever by\r\nobserving that the persons concerned in it all separated, the moment\r\nthe signing, the kissing, and congratulating duties proper to the\r\noccasion had been performed, and quickly retired in the various\r\ndirections by which they had approached the church.\r\n\r\nLeaving the clerk to return by the village road, the bride,\r\nbridegroom, and elderly gentleman to turn back by the footpath over\r\nthe fields, and the visionary stranger of these pages to vanish out of\r\nthem in any direction that he pleases--let us follow Doctor Chennery\r\nto the vicarage breakfast-table, and hear what he has to say about his\r\nprofessional exertions of the morning in the familiar atmosphere of\r\nhis own family circle.\r\n\r\nThe persons assembled at the breakfast were, first, Mr. Phippen, a\r\nguest; secondly, Miss Sturch, a governess; thirdly, fourthly, and\r\nfifthly, Miss Louisa Chennery (aged eleven years), Miss Amelia\r\nChennery (aged nine years), and Master Robert Chennery (aged eight\r\nyears). There was no mother\'s face present, to make the household\r\npicture complete. Doctor Chennery had been a widower since the birth\r\nof his youngest child.\r\n\r\nThe guest was an old college acquaintance of the vicar\'s, and he was\r\nsupposed to be now staying at Long Beckley for the benefit of his\r\nhealth. Most men of any character at all contrive to get a reputation\r\nof some sort which individualizes them in the social circle amid\r\nwhich they move. Mr. Phippen was a man of some little character, and\r\nhe lived with great distinction in the estimation of his friends on\r\nthe reputation of being A Martyr to Dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nWherever Mr. Phippen went, the woes of Mr. Phippen\'s stomach went with\r\nhim. He dieted himself publicly, and physicked himself publicly. He\r\nwas so intensely occupied with himself and his maladies, that he would\r\nlet a chance acquaintance into the secret of the condition of his\r\ntongue at five minutes\' notice; being just as perpetually ready to\r\ndiscuss the state of his digestion as people in general are to discuss\r\nthe state of the weather. On this favorite subject, as on all others,\r\nhe spoke with a wheedling gentleness of manner, sometimes in softly\r\nmournful, sometimes in languidly sentimental tones. His politeness was\r\nof the oppressively affectionate sort, and he used the word "dear"\r\ncontinually in addressing himself to others. Personally, he could not\r\nbe called a handsome man. His eyes were watery, large, and light gray;\r\nthey were always rolling from side to side in a state of moist\r\nadmiration of something or somebody. His nose was long, drooping,\r\nprofoundly melancholy--if such an expression may be permitted, in\r\nreference to that particular feature. For the rest, his lips had a\r\nlachrymose twist; his stature was small; his head large, bald, and\r\nloosely set on his shoulders; his manner of dressing himself\r\neccentric, on the side of smartness; his age about five-and-forty; his\r\ncondition that of a single man. Such was Mr. Phippen, the Martyr to\r\nDyspepsia, and the guest of the vicar of Long Beckley.\r\n\r\nMiss Sturch, the governess, may be briefly and accurately described as\r\na young lady who had never been troubled with an idea or a sensation\r\nsince the day when she was born. She was a little, plump, quiet,\r\nwhite-skinned, smiling, neatly dressed girl, wound up accurately to\r\nthe performance of certain duties at certain times; and possessed of\r\nan inexhaustible vocabulary of commonplace talk, which dribbled\r\nplacidly out of her lips whenever it was called for, always in the\r\nsame quantity, and always of the same quality, at every hour in the\r\nday, and through every change in the seasons. Miss Sturch never\r\nlaughed, and never cried, but took the safe middle course of smiling\r\nperpetually. She smiled when she came down on a morning in January,\r\nand said it was very cold. She smiled when she came down on a morning\r\nin July, and said it was very hot. She smiled when the bishop came\r\nonce a year to see the vicar; she smiled when the butcher\'s boy came\r\nevery morning for orders. Let what might happen at the vicarage,\r\nnothing ever jerked Miss Sturch out of the one smooth groove in which\r\nshe ran perpetually, always at the same pace. If she had lived in a\r\nroyalist family, during the civil wars in England, she would have rung\r\nfor the cook, to order dinner, on the morning of the execution of\r\nCharles the First. If Shakspeare had come back to life again, and had\r\ncalled at the vicarage at six o\'clock on Saturday evening, to explain\r\nto Miss Sturch exactly what his views were in composing the tragedy of\r\nHamlet, she would have smiled and said it was extremely interesting,\r\nuntil the striking of seven o\'clock; at which time she would have left\r\nhim in the middle of a sentence, to superintend the housemaid in the\r\nverification of the washing-book. A very estimable young person, Miss\r\nSturch (as the ladies of Long Beckley were accustomed to say); so\r\njudicious with the children, and so attached to her household duties;\r\nsuch a well-regulated mind, and such a crisp touch on the piano; just\r\nnice-looking enough, just well-dressed enough, just talkative enough;\r\nnot quite old enough, perhaps, and a little too much inclined to be\r\nembraceably plump about the region of the waist--but, on the whole, a\r\nmost estimable young person--very much so, indeed.\r\n\r\nOn the characteristic peculiarities of Miss Sturch\'s pupils, it is not\r\nnecessary to dwell at very great length. Miss Louisa\'s habitual\r\nweakness was an inveterate tendency to catch cold. Miss Amelia\'s\r\nprincipal defect was a disposition to gratify her palate by eating\r\nsupplementary dinners and breakfasts at unauthorized times and\r\nseasons. Master Robert\'s most noticeable failings were caused by\r\nalacrity in tearing his clothes, and obtuseness in learning the\r\nMultiplication Table. The virtues of all three were of much the same\r\nnature--they were well grown, they were genuine children, and they\r\nwere boisterously fond of Miss Sturch.\r\n\r\nTo complete the gallery of family portraits, an outline, at the least,\r\nmust be attempted of the vicar himself. Doctor Chennery was, in a\r\nphysical point of view, a credit to the Establishment to which he was\r\nattached. He stood six feet two in his shooting-shoes; he weighed\r\nfifteen stone; he was the best bowler in the Long Beckley\r\ncricket-club; he was a strictly orthodox man in the matter of wine and\r\nmutton; he never started disagreeable theories about people\'s future\r\ndestinies in the pulpit, never quarreled with any body out of the\r\npulpit, never buttoned up his pockets when the necessities of his poor\r\nbrethren (Dissenters included) pleaded with him to open them. His\r\ncourse through the world was a steady march along the high and dry\r\nmiddle of a safe turnpike-road. The serpentine side-paths of\r\ncontroversy might open as alluringly as they pleased on his right hand\r\nand on his left, but he kept on his way sturdily, and never regarded\r\nthem. Innovating young recruits in the Church army might entrappingly\r\nopen the Thirty-nine Articles under his very nose, but the veteran\'s\r\nwary eye never looked a hair\'s-breadth further than his own signature\r\nat the bottom of them. He knew as little as possible of theology, he\r\nhad never given the Privy Council a minute\'s trouble in the whole\r\ncourse of his life, he was innocent of all meddling with the reading\r\nor writing of pamphlets, and he was quite incapable of finding his way\r\nto the platform of Exeter Hall. In short, he was the most unclerical\r\nof clergymen--but, for all that, he had such a figure for a surplice\r\nas is seldom seen. Fifteen stone weight of upright muscular flesh,\r\nwithout an angry spot or sore place in any part of it, has the merit\r\nof suggesting stability, at any rate--an excellent virtue in pillars\r\nof all kinds, but an especially precious quality, at the present time,\r\nin a pillar of the Church.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the vicar entered the breakfast-parlor, the children\r\nassailed him with a chorus of shouts. He was a severe disciplinarian\r\nin the observance of punctuality at meal-times; and he now stood\r\nconvicted by the clock of being too late for breakfast by a quarter of\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to have kept you waiting, Miss Sturch," said the vicar; "but I\r\nhave a good excuse for being late this morning."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t mention it, Sir," said Miss Sturch, blandly rubbing her\r\nplump little hands one over the other. "A beautiful morning. I fear we\r\nshall have another warm day.--Robert, my love, your elbow is on the\r\ntable.--A beautiful morning, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Stomach still out of order--eh, Phippen?" asked the vicar, beginning\r\nto carve the ham.\r\n\r\nMr. Phippen shook his large head dolefully, placed his yellow\r\nforefinger, ornamented with a large turquoise ring, on the centre\r\ncheck of his light-green summer waistcoat--looked piteously at Doctor\r\nChennery, and sighed--removed the finger, and produced from the breast\r\npocket of his wrapper a little mahogany case--took out of it a neat\r\npair of apothecary\'s scales, with the accompanying weights, a morsel\r\nof ginger, and a highly polished silver nutmeg-grater. "Dear Miss\r\nSturch will pardon an invalid?" said Mr. Phippen, beginning to grate\r\nthe ginger feebly into the nearest tea-cup.\r\n\r\n"Guess what has made me a quarter of an hour late this morning," said\r\nthe vicar, looking mysteriously all round the table.\r\n\r\n"Lying in bed, papa," cried the three children, clapping their hands\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ say, Miss Sturch?" asked Doctor Chennery.\r\n\r\nMiss Sturch smiled as usual, rubbed her hands as usual, cleared her\r\nthroat softly as usual, looked at the tea-urn, and begged, with the\r\nmost graceful politeness, to be excused if she said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Your turn now, Phippen," said the vicar. "Come, guess what has kept\r\nme late this morning."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Mr. Phippen, giving the Doctor a brotherly\r\nsqueeze of the hand, "don\'t ask me to guess--I know! I saw what you\r\neat at dinner yesterday--I saw what you drank after dinner. No\r\ndigestion could stand it--not even yours. Guess what has made you late\r\nthis morning? Pooh! pooh! I know. You dear, good soul, you have been\r\ntaking physic!"\r\n\r\n"Hav\'n\'t touched a drop, thank God, for the last ten years!" said\r\nDoctor Chennery, with a look of devout gratitude. "No, no; you\'re all\r\nwrong. The fact is, I have been to church; and what do you think I\r\nhave been doing there? Listen, Miss Sturch--listen, girls, with all\r\nyour ears. Poor blind young Frankland is a happy man at last--I have\r\nmarried him to our dear Rosamond Treverton this very morning!"\r\n\r\n"Without telling us, papa!" cried the two girls together in their\r\nshrillest tones of vexation and surprise. "Without telling us, when\r\nyou know how we should have liked to see it!"\r\n\r\n"That was the very reason why I did not tell you, my dears," answered\r\nthe vicar. "Young Frankland has not got so used to his affliction yet,\r\npoor fellow, as to bear being publicly pitied and stared at in the\r\ncharacter of a blind bridegroom. He had such a nervous horror of being\r\nan object of curiosity on his wedding-day, and Rosamond, like a\r\nkind-hearted girl as she is, was so anxious that his slightest\r\ncaprices should be humored, that we settled to have the wedding at an\r\nhour in the morning when no idlers were likely to be lounging about\r\nthe neighborhood of the church. I was bound over to the strictest\r\nsecrecy about the day, and so was my clerk Thomas. Excepting us two,\r\nand the bride and bridegroom, and the bride\'s father, Captain\r\nTreverton, nobody knew--"\r\n\r\n"Treverton!" exclaimed Mr. Phippen, holding his tea-cup, with the\r\ngrated ginger in the bottom of it, to be filled by Miss Sturch.\r\n"Treverton! (No more tea, dear Miss Sturch.) How very remarkable! I\r\nknow the name. (Fill up with water, if you please.) Tell me, my dear\r\ndoctor (many, many thanks; no sugar--it turns acid on the stomach), is\r\nthis Miss Treverton whom you have been marrying (many thanks again; no\r\nmilk, either) one of the Cornish Trevertons?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure she is!" rejoined the vicar. "Her father, Captain\r\nTreverton, is the head of the family. Not that there\'s much family to\r\nspeak of now. The Captain, and Rosamond, and that whimsical old brute\r\nof an uncle of hers, Andrew Treverton, are the last left now of the\r\nold stock--a rich family, and a fine family, in former times--good\r\nfriends to Church and State, you know, and all that--"\r\n\r\n"Do you approve, Sir, of Amelia having a second helping of bread and\r\nmarmalade?" asked Miss Sturch, appealing to Doctor Chennery, with the\r\nmost perfect unconsciousness of interrupting him. Having no spare room\r\nin her mind for putting things away in until the appropriate time came\r\nfor bringing them out, Miss Sturch always asked questions and made\r\nremarks the moment they occurred to her, without waiting for the\r\nbeginning, middle, or end of any conversations that might be\r\nproceeding in her presence. She invariably looked the part of a\r\nlistener to perfection, but she never acted it except in the case of\r\ntalk that was aimed point-blank at her own ears.\r\n\r\n"Oh, give her a second helping, by all means!" said the vicar,\r\ncarelessly; "if she must over-eat herself, she may as well do it on\r\nbread and marmalade as on any thing else."\r\n\r\n"My dear, good soul," exclaimed Mr. Phippen, "look what a wreck I am,\r\nand don\'t talk in that shockingly thoughtless way of letting our sweet\r\nAmelia over-eat herself. Load the stomach in youth, and what becomes\r\nof the digestion in age? The thing which vulgar people call the\r\ninside--I appeal to Miss Sturch\'s interest in her charming pupil as an\r\nexcuse for going into physiological particulars--is, in point of fact,\r\nan Apparatus. Digestively considered, Miss Sturch, even the fairest\r\nand youngest of us is an Apparatus. Oil our wheels, if you like; but\r\nclog them at your peril. Farinaceous puddings and mutton-chops;\r\nmutton-chops and farinaceous puddings--those should be the parents\'\r\nwatch-words, if I had my way, from one end of England to the other.\r\nLook here, my sweet child--look at me. There is no fun, dear, about\r\nthese little scales, but dreadful earnest. See! I put in the balance\r\non one side dry bread (stale, dry bread, Amelia!), and on the other\r\nsome ounce weights. \'Mr. Phippen, eat by weight. Mr. Phippen! eat the\r\nsame quantity, day by day, to a hair\'s-breadth. Mr. Phippen! exceed\r\nyour allowance (though it is only stale, dry bread) if you dare!\'\r\nAmelia, love, this is not fun--this is what the doctors tell me--the\r\ndoctors, my child, who have been searching my Apparatus through and\r\nthrough for thirty years past with little pills, and have not found\r\nout where my wheels are clogged yet. Think of that, Amelia--think of\r\nMr. Phippen\'s clogged Apparatus--and say \'No, thank you,\' next time.\r\nMiss Sturch, I beg a thousand pardons for intruding on your province;\r\nbut my interest in that sweet child--Chennery, you dear, good soul,\r\nwhat were we talking about? Ah! the bride--the interesting bride! And\r\nso she is one of the Cornish Trevertons? I knew something of Andrew\r\nyears ago. He was a bachelor, like myself, Miss Sturch. His Apparatus\r\nwas out of order, like mine, dear Amelia. Not at all like his brother,\r\nthe Captain, I should suppose? And so she is married? A charming girl,\r\nI have no doubt. A charming girl!"\r\n\r\n"No better, truer, prettier girl in the world," said the vicar.\r\n\r\n"A very lively, energetic person," remarked Miss Sturch.\r\n\r\n"How I shall miss her!" cried Miss Louisa. "Nobody else amused me as\r\nRosamond did, when I was laid up with that last bad cold of mine."\r\n\r\n"She used to give us such nice little early supper-parties," said Miss\r\nAmelia.\r\n\r\n"She was the only girl I ever saw who was fit to play with boys," said\r\nMaster Robert. "She could catch a ball, Mr. Phippen, Sir, with one\r\nhand, and go down a slide with both her legs together."\r\n\r\n"Bless me!" said Mr. Phippen. "What an extraordinary wife for a blind\r\nman! You said he was blind from his birth, my dear doctor, did you\r\nnot? Let me see, what was his name? You will not bear too hardly on my\r\nloss of memory, Miss Sturch? When indigestion has done with the body,\r\nit begins to prey on the mind. Mr. Frank Something, was it not?"\r\n\r\n"No, no--Frankland," answered the vicar, "Leonard Frankland. And not\r\nblind from his birth by any means. It is not much more than a year ago\r\nsince he could see almost as well as any of us."\r\n\r\n"An accident, I suppose!" said Mr. Phippen. "You will excuse me if I\r\ntake the arm-chair?--a partially reclining posture is of great\r\nassistance to me after meals. So an accident happened to his eyes? Ah,\r\nwhat a delightfully easy chair to sit in!"\r\n\r\n"Scarcely an accident," said Doctor Chennery. "Leonard Frankland was a\r\ndifficult child to bring up: great constitutional weakness, you know,\r\nat first. He seemed to get over that with time, and grew into a quiet,\r\nsedate, orderly sort of boy--as unlike my son there as possible--very\r\namiable, and what you call easy to deal with. Well, he had a turn for\r\nmechanics (I am telling you all this to make you understand about his\r\nblindness), and, after veering from one occupation of that sort to\r\nanother, he took at last to watch-making. Curious amusement for a boy;\r\nbut any thing that required delicacy of touch, and plenty of patience\r\nand perseverance, was just the thing to amuse and occupy Leonard. I\r\nalways said to his father and mother, \'Get him off that stool, break\r\nhis magnifying-glasses, send him to me, and I\'ll give him a back at\r\nleap-frog, and teach him the use of a bat.\' But it was no use. His\r\nparents knew best, I suppose, and they said he must be humored. Well,\r\nthings went on smoothly enough for some time, till he got another\r\nlong illness--as I believe, from not taking exercise enough. As soon\r\nas he began to get round, back he went to his old watch-making\r\noccupations again. But the bad end of it all was coming. About the\r\nlast work he did, poor fellow, was the repairing of my watch--here it\r\nis; goes as regular as a steam-engine. I hadn\'t got it back into my\r\nfob very long before I heard that he was getting a bad pain at the\r\nback of his head, and that he saw all sorts of moving spots before his\r\neyes. \'String him up with lots of port wine, and give him three hours\r\na day on the back of a quiet pony\'--that was my advice. Instead of\r\ntaking it, they sent for doctors from London, and blistered him behind\r\nthe ears and between the shoulders, and drenched the lad with mercury,\r\nand moped him up in a dark room. No use. The sight got worse and\r\nworse, flickered and flickered, and went out at last like the flame of\r\na candle. His mother died--luckily for her, poor soul--before that\r\nhappened. His father was half out of his mind: took him to oculists in\r\nLondon and oculists in Paris. All they did was to call the blindness\r\nby a long Latin name, and to say that it was hopeless and useless to\r\ntry an operation. Some of them said it was the result of the long\r\nweaknesses from which he had twice suffered after illness. Some said\r\nit was an apoplectic effusion in his brain. All of them shook their\r\nheads when they heard of the watch-making. So they brought him back\r\nhome, blind; blind he is now; and blind he will remain, poor dear\r\nfellow, for the rest of his life."\r\n\r\n"You shock me; my dear Chennery, you shock me dreadfully," said Mr.\r\nPhippen. "Especially when you state that theory about long weakness\r\nafter illness. Good Heavens! Why, _I_ have had long weaknesses--I have\r\ngot them now. Spots did he see before his eyes? I see spots, black\r\nspots, dancing black spots, dancing black bilious spots. Upon my word\r\nof honor, Chennery, this comes home to me--my sympathies are painfully\r\nacute--I feel this blind story in every nerve of my body; I do,\r\nindeed!"\r\n\r\n"You would hardly know that Leonard was blind, to look at him," said\r\nMiss Louisa, striking into the conversation with a view to restoring\r\nMr. Phippen\'s equanimity. "Except that his eyes look quieter than\r\nother people\'s, there seems no difference in them now. Who was that\r\nfamous character you told us about, Miss Sturch, who was blind, and\r\ndidn\'t show it any more than Leonard Frankland?"\r\n\r\n"Milton, my love. I begged you to remember that he was the most famous\r\nof British epic poets," answered Miss Sturch with suavity. "He\r\npoetically describes his blindness as being caused by \'so thick a drop\r\nserene.\' You shall read about it, Louisa. After we have had a little\r\nFrench, we will have a little Milton, this morning. Hush, love, your\r\npapa is speaking."\r\n\r\n"Poor young Frankland!" said the vicar, warmly. "That good, tender,\r\nnoble creature I married him to this morning seems sent as a\r\nconsolation to him in his affliction. If any human being can make him\r\nhappy for the rest of his life, Rosamond Treverton is the girl to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"She has made a sacrifice," said Mr. Phippen; "but I like her for\r\nthat, having made a sacrifice myself in remaining single. It seems\r\nindispensable, indeed, on the score of humanity, that I should do so.\r\nHow could I conscientiously inflict such a digestion as mine on a\r\nmember of the fairer portion of creation? No; I am a sacrifice in my\r\nown proper person, and I have a fellow-feeling for others who are like\r\nme. Did she cry much, Chennery, when you were marrying her?"\r\n\r\n"Cry!" exclaimed the vicar, contemptuously. "Rosamond Treverton is not\r\none of the puling, sentimental sort, I can tell you. A fine, buxom,\r\nwarm-hearted, quick-tempered girl, who looks what she means when she\r\ntells a man she is going to marry him. And, mind you, she has been\r\ntried. If she hadn\'t loved him with all her heart and soul, she might\r\nhave been free months ago to marry any body she pleased. They were\r\nengaged long before this cruel affliction befell young Frankland--the\r\nfathers, on both sides, having lived as near neighbors in these parts\r\nfor years. Well, when the blindness came, Leonard at once offered to\r\nrelease Rosamond from her engagement. You should have read the letter\r\nshe wrote to him, Phippen, upon that. I don\'t mind confessing that I\r\nblubbered like a baby over it when they showed it to me. I should have\r\nmarried them at once the instant I read it, but old Frankland was a\r\nfidgety, punctilious kind of man, and he insisted on a six months\'\r\nprobation, so that she might be certain of knowing her own mind. He\r\ndied before the term was out, and that caused the marriage to be put\r\noff again. But no delays could alter Rosamond--six years, instead of\r\nsix months, would not have changed her. There she was this morning as\r\nfond of that poor, patient blind fellow as she was the first day they\r\nwere engaged. \'You shall never know a sad moment, Lenny, if I can help\r\nit, as long as you live\'--these were the first words she said to him\r\nwhen we all came out of church. \'I hear you, Rosamond,\' said I. \'And\r\nyou shall judge me, too, Doctor,\' says she, quick as lightning. \'We\r\nwill come back to Long Beckley, and you shall ask Lenny if I have not\r\nkept my word.\' With that she gave me a kiss that you might have heard\r\ndown here at the vicarage, bless her heart! We\'ll drink her health\r\nafter dinner, Miss Sturch--we\'ll drink both their healths, Phippen, in\r\na bottle of the best wine I have in my cellar."\r\n\r\n"In a glass of toast-and-water, so far as I am concerned, if you will\r\nallow me," said Mr. Phippen, mournfully. "But, my dear Chennery, when\r\nyou were talking of the fathers of these two interesting young people,\r\nyou spoke of their living as near neighbors here, at Long Beckley. My\r\nmemory is impaired, as I am painfully aware; but I thought Captain\r\nTreverton was the eldest of the two brothers, and that he always\r\nlived, when he was on shore, at the family place in Cornwall?"\r\n\r\n"So he did," returned the vicar, "in his wife\'s lifetime. But since\r\nher death, which happened as long ago as the year \'twenty-nine--let me\r\nsee, we are now in the year \'forty-four--and that makes--"\r\n\r\nThe vicar stopped for an instant to calculate, and looked at Miss\r\nSturch.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen years ago, Sir," said Miss Sturch, offering the accommodation\r\nof a little simple subtraction to the vicar, with her blandest smile.\r\n\r\n"Of course," continued Doctor Chennery. "Well, since Mrs. Treverton\r\ndied, fifteen years ago, Captain Treverton has never been near\r\nPorthgenna Tower. And, what is more, Phippen, at the first opportunity\r\nhe could get, he sold the place--sold it, out and out, mine,\r\nfisheries, and all--for forty thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so!" exclaimed Mr. Phippen. "Did he find the air\r\nunhealthy? I should think the local produce, in the way of food, must\r\nbe coarse now, in those barbarous regions? Who bought the place?"\r\n\r\n"Leonard Frankland\'s father," said the vicar. "It is rather a long\r\nstory, that sale of Porthgenna Tower, with some curious circumstances\r\ninvolved in it. Suppose we take a turn in the garden, Phippen? I\'ll\r\ntell you all about it over my morning cigar. Miss Sturch, if you want\r\nme, I shall be on the lawn somewhere. Girls! mind you know your\r\nlessons. Bob! remember that I\'ve got a cane in the hall, and a\r\nbirch-rod in my dressing-room. Come, Phippen, rouse up out of that\r\narm-chair. You won\'t say No to a turn in the garden?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, I will say Yes--if you will kindly lend me an\r\numbrella, and allow me to carry my camp-stool in my hand," said Mr.\r\nPhippen. "I am too weak to encounter the sun, and I can\'t go far\r\nwithout sitting down.--The moment I feel fatigued, Miss Sturch, I open\r\nmy camp-stool, and sit down any where, without the slightest regard\r\nfor appearances.--I am ready, Chennery, whenever you are--equally\r\nready, my good friend, for the garden and the story about the sale of\r\nPorthgenna Tower. You said it was a curious story, did you not?"\r\n\r\n"I said there was some curious circumstances connected with it,"\r\nreplied the vicar. "And when you hear about them, I think you will say\r\nso too. Come along! you will find your camp-stool, and a choice of all\r\nthe umbrellas in the house, in the hall."\r\n\r\nWith those words, Doctor Chennery opened his cigar-case, and led the\r\nway out of the breakfast-parlor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SALE OF PORTHGENNA TOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How charming! how pastoral! how exquisitely soothing!" said Mr.\r\nPhippen, sentimentally surveying the lawn at the back of the\r\nvicarage-house, under the shadow of the lightest umbrella he could\r\npick out of the hall. "Three years have passed, Chennery, since I last\r\nstood on this lawn. There is the window of your old study, where I had\r\nmy attack of heart-burn last time--in the strawberry season; don\'t\r\nyou remember? Ah! and there is the school-room! Shall I ever forget\r\ndear Miss Sturch coming to me out of that room--a ministering angel\r\nwith soda and ginger--so comforting, so sweetly anxious about stirring\r\nit up, so unaffectedly grieved that there was no sal-volatile in the\r\nhouse! I do so enjoy these pleasant recollections, Chennery; they are\r\nas great a luxury to me as your cigar is to you. Could you walk on the\r\nother side, my dear fellow? I like the smell, but the smoke is a\r\nlittle too much for me. Thank you. And now about the story? What was\r\nthe name of the old place--I am so interested in it--it began with a\r\nP, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Porthgenna Tower," said the vicar.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," rejoined Mr. Phippen, shifting the umbrella tenderly from\r\none shoulder to the other. "And what in the world made Captain\r\nTreverton sell Porthgenna Tower?"\r\n\r\n"I believe the reason was that he could not endure the place after the\r\ndeath of his wife," answered Doctor Chennery. "The estate, you know,\r\nhas never been entailed; so the Captain had no difficulty in parting\r\nwith it, except, of course, the difficulty of finding a purchaser."\r\n\r\n"Why not his brother?" asked Mr. Phippen. "Why not our eccentric\r\nfriend, Andrew Treverton?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call him my friend," said the vicar. "A mean, groveling,\r\ncynical, selfish old wretch! It\'s no use shaking your head, Phippen,\r\nand trying to look shocked. I know Andrew Treverton\'s early history as\r\nwell as you do. I know that he was treated with the basest ingratitude\r\nby a college friend, who took all he had to give, and swindled him at\r\nlast in the grossest manner. I know all about that. But one instance\r\nof ingratitude does not justify a man in shutting himself up from\r\nsociety, and railing against all mankind as a disgrace to the earth\r\nthey walk on. I myself have heard the old brute say that the greatest\r\nbenefactor to our generation would be a second Herod, who could\r\nprevent another generation from succeeding it. Ought a man who can\r\ntalk in that way to be the friend of any human being with the\r\nslightest respect for his species or himself?"\r\n\r\n"My friend!" said Mr. Phippen, catching the vicar by the arm, and\r\nmysteriously lowering his voice--"My dear and reverend friend! I\r\nadmire your honest indignation against the utterer of that exceedingly\r\nmisanthropical sentiment; but--I confide this to you, Chennery, in\r\nthe strictest secrecy--there are moments--morning moments\r\ngenerally--when my digestion is in such a state that I have actually\r\nagreed with that annihilating person, Andrew Treverton! I have woke up\r\nwith my tongue like a cinder--I have crawled to the glass and looked\r\nat it--and I have said to myself, \'Let there be an end of the human\r\nrace rather than a continuance of this!\'"\r\n\r\n"Pooh! pooh!" cried the vicar, receiving Mr. Phippen\'s confession with\r\na burst of irreverent laughter. "Take a glass of cool small beer next\r\ntime your tongue is in that state, and you will pray for a continuance\r\nof the brewing part of the human race, at any rate. But let us go back\r\nto Porthgenna Tower, or I shall never get on with my story. When\r\nCaptain Treverton had once made up his mind to sell the place, I have\r\nno doubt that, under ordinary circumstances, he would have thought of\r\noffering it to his brother, with a view, of course, to keeping the\r\nestate in the family. Andrew was rich enough to have bought it; for,\r\nthough he got nothing at his father\'s death but the old gentleman\'s\r\nrare collection of books, he inherited his mother\'s fortune, as the\r\nsecond son. However, as things were at that time (and are still, I am\r\nsorry to say), the Captain could make no personal offers of any kind\r\nto Andrew; for the two were not then, and are not now, on speaking, or\r\neven on writing terms. It is a shocking thing to say, but the worst\r\nquarrel of the kind I ever heard of is the quarrel between those two\r\nbrothers."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, my dear friend," said Mr. Phippen, opening his camp-stool,\r\nwhich had hitherto dangled by its silken tassel from the hooked handle\r\nof the umbrella. "May I sit down before you go any further? I am\r\ngetting a little excited about this part of the story, and I dare not\r\nfatigue myself. Pray go on. I don\'t think the legs of my camp-stool\r\nwill make holes in the lawn. I am so light--a mere skeleton, in fact.\r\nDo go on!"\r\n\r\n"You must have heard," pursued the vicar, "that Captain Treverton,\r\nwhen he was advanced in life, married an actress--rather a violent\r\ntemper, I believe; but a person of spotless character, and as fond of\r\nher husband as a woman could be; therefore, according to my view of\r\nit, a very good wife for him to marry. However, the Captain\'s friends,\r\nof course, made the usual senseless outcry, and the Captain\'s\r\nbrother, as the only near relation, took it on himself to attempt\r\nbreaking off the marriage in the most offensively indelicate way.\r\nFailing in that, and hating the poor woman like poison, he left his\r\nbrother\'s house, saying, among many other savage speeches, one\r\ninfamous thing about the bride, which--which, upon my honor, Phippen,\r\nI am ashamed to repeat. Whatever the words were, they were unluckily\r\ncarried to Mrs. Treverton\'s ears, and they were of the kind that no\r\nwoman--let alone a quick-tempered woman like the Captain\'s wife--ever\r\nforgives. An interview followed between the two brothers--and it led,\r\nas you may easily imagine, to very unhappy results. They parted in the\r\nmost deplorable manner. The Captain declared, in the heat of his\r\npassion, that Andrew had never had one generous impulse in his heart\r\nsince he was born, and that he would die without one kind feeling\r\ntoward any living soul in the world. Andrew replied that, if he had no\r\nheart, he had a memory, and that he should remember those farewell\r\nwords as long as he lived. So they separated. Twice afterward the\r\nCaptain made overtures of reconciliation. The first time when his\r\ndaughter Rosamond was born; the second time when Mrs. Treverton died.\r\nOn each occasion the elder brother wrote to say that, if the younger\r\nwould retract the atrocious words he had spoken against his\r\nsister-in-law, every atonement should be offered to him for the harsh\r\nlanguage which the Captain had used, in the hastiness of anger, when\r\nthey last met. No answer was received from Andrew to either letter;\r\nand the estrangement between the two brothers has continued to the\r\npresent time. You understand now why Captain Treverton could not\r\nprivately consult Andrew\'s inclinations before he publicly announced\r\nhis intention of parting with Porthgenna Tower."\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Phippen declared, in answer to this appeal, that he\r\nunderstood perfectly, and although he begged with the utmost\r\npoliteness that the vicar would go on, his attention seemed, for the\r\nmoment, to be entirely absorbed in inspecting the legs of his\r\ncamp-stool, and in ascertaining what impression they made on the\r\nvicarage lawn. Doctor Chennery\'s own interest, however, in the\r\ncircumstances that he was relating, seemed sufficiently strong to make\r\nup for any transient lapse of attention on the part of his guest.\r\nAfter a few vigorous puffs at his cigar (which had been several times\r\nin imminent danger of going out while he was speaking), he went on\r\nwith his narrative in these words:\r\n\r\n"Well, the house, the estate, the mine, and the fisheries of\r\nPorthgenna were all publicly put up for sale a few months after Mrs.\r\nTreverton\'s death; but no offers were made for the property which it\r\nwas possible to accept. The ruinous state of the house, the bad\r\ncultivation of the land, legal difficulties in connection with the\r\nmine, and quarter-day difficulties in the collection of the rents, all\r\ncontributed to make Porthgenna what the auctioneers would call a bad\r\nlot to dispose of. Failing to sell the place, Captain Treverton could\r\nnot be prevailed on to change his mind and live there again. The death\r\nof his wife almost broke his heart--for he was, by all accounts, just\r\nas fond of her as she had been of him--and the very sight of the place\r\nthat was associated with the greatest affliction of his life became\r\nhateful to him. He removed, with his little girl and a relative of\r\nMrs. Treverton, who was her governess, to our neighborhood, and rented\r\na pretty little cottage across the church fields. The house nearest to\r\nit was inhabited at that time by Leonard Frankland\'s father and\r\nmother. The new neighbors soon became intimate; and thus it happened\r\nthat the couple whom I have been marrying this morning were brought up\r\ntogether as children, and fell in love with each other almost before\r\nthey were out of their pinafores."\r\n\r\n"Chennery, my dear fellow, I don\'t look as if I was sitting all on one\r\nside, do I?" cried Mr. Phippen, suddenly breaking into the vicar\'s\r\nnarrative, with a look of alarm. "I am shocked to interrupt you; but\r\nsurely your grass is amazingly soft in this part of the country. One\r\nof my camp-stool legs is getting shorter and shorter every moment. I\'m\r\ndrilling a hole! I\'m toppling over! Gracious Heavens! I feel myself\r\ngoing--I shall be down, Chennery; upon my life, I shall be down!"\r\n\r\n"Stuff!" cried the vicar, pulling up first Mr. Phippen, and then Mr.\r\nPhippen\'s camp-stool, which had rooted itself in the grass, all on one\r\nside. "Here, come on to the gravel walk; you can\'t drill holes in\r\nthat. What\'s the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"Palpitations," said Mr. Phippen, dropping his umbrella, and placing\r\nhis hand over his heart, "and bile. I see those black spots\r\nagain--those infernal, lively black spots dancing before my eyes.\r\nChennery, suppose you consult some agricultural friend about the\r\nquality of your grass. Take my word for it, your lawn is softer than\r\nit ought to be.--Lawn!" repeated Mr. Phippen to himself,\r\ncontemptuously, as he turned round to pick up his umbrella. "It isn\'t\r\na lawn--it is a bog!"\r\n\r\n"There, sit down," said the vicar, "and don\'t pay the palpitations and\r\nthe black spots the compliment of bestowing the smallest attention on\r\nthem. Do you want any thing to drink? Shall it be physic, or beer, or\r\nwhat?"\r\n\r\n"No, no! I am so unwilling to give trouble," answered Mr. Phippen. "I\r\nwould rather suffer--rather, a great deal. I think if you would go on\r\nwith your story, Chennery, it would compose me. I have not the\r\nfaintest idea of what led to it, but I think you were saying something\r\ninteresting on the subject of pinafores!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Doctor Chennery. "I was only telling you of the\r\nfondness between the two children who have now grown up to be man and\r\nwife. And I was going on to tell you that Captain Treverton, shortly\r\nafter he settled in our neighborhood, took to the active practice of\r\nhis profession again. Nothing else seemed to fill up the gap that the\r\nloss of Mrs. Treverton had made in his life. Having good interest with\r\nthe Admiralty, he can always get a ship when he applies for one; and\r\nup to the present time, with intervals on shore, he has resolutely\r\nstuck to the sea--though he is getting, as his daughter and his\r\nfriends think, rather too old for it now. Don\'t look puzzled, Phippen;\r\nI am not going so wide of the mark as you think. These are some of the\r\nnecessary particulars that must be stated first. And now they are\r\ncomfortably disposed of, I can get round at last to the main part of\r\nmy story--the sale of Porthgenna Tower.--What is it now? Do you want\r\nto get up again?"\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Phippen did want to get up again, for the purpose of\r\ncomposing the palpitations and dispersing the black spots, by trying\r\nthe experiment of a little gentle exercise. He was most unwilling to\r\noccasion any trouble, but would his worthy friend Chennery give him an\r\narm, and carry the camp-stool, and walk slowly in the direction of the\r\nschool-room window, so as to keep Miss Sturch within easy hailing\r\ndistance, in case it became necessary to try the last resource of\r\ntaking a composing draught? The vicar, whose inexhaustible good nature\r\nwas proof against every trial that Mr. Phippen\'s dyspeptic infirmities\r\ncould inflict on it, complied with all these requests, and went on\r\nwith his story, unconsciously adopting the tone and manner of a\r\ngood-humored parent who was doing his best to soothe the temper of a\r\nfretful child.\r\n\r\n"I told you," he said, "that the elder Mr. Frankland and Captain\r\nTreverton were near neighbors here. They had not been long acquainted\r\nbefore the one found out from the other that Porthgenna Tower was for\r\nsale. On first hearing this, old Frankland asked a few questions about\r\nthe place, but said not a word on the subject of purchasing it. Soon\r\nafter that the Captain got a ship and went to sea. During his absence\r\nold Frankland privately set off for Cornwall to look at the estate,\r\nand to find out all he could about its advantages and defects from the\r\npersons left in charge of the house and lands. He said nothing when he\r\ncame back, until Captain Treverton returned from his first cruise; and\r\nthen the old gentleman spoke out one morning, in his quiet, decided\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"\'Treverton,\' said he, \'if you will sell Porthgenna Tower at the price\r\nat which you bought it in, when you tried to dispose of it by auction,\r\nwrite to your lawyer, and tell him to take the title-deeds to mine,\r\nand ask for the purchase-money.\'\r\n\r\n"Captain Treverton was naturally a little astonished at the readiness\r\nof this offer; but people like myself, who knew old Frankland\'s\r\nhistory, were not so surprised. His fortune had been made by trade,\r\nand he was foolish enough to be always a little ashamed of\r\nacknowledging that one simple and creditable fact. The truth was, that\r\nhis ancestors had been landed gentry of importance before the time of\r\nthe Civil War, and the old gentleman\'s great ambition was to sink the\r\nmerchant in the landed grandee, and to leave his son to succeed him in\r\nthe character of a squire of large estate and great county influence.\r\nHe was willing to devote half his fortune to accomplish this scheme;\r\nbut half his fortune would not buy him such an estate as he wanted, in\r\nan important agricultural county like ours. Rents are high, and land\r\nis made the most of with us. An estate as extensive as the estate at\r\nPorthgenna would fetch more than double the money which Captain\r\nTreverton could venture to ask for it, if it was situated in these\r\nparts. Old Frankland was well aware of that fact, and attached all\r\npossible importance to it. Besides, there was something in the feudal\r\nlook of Porthgenna Tower, and in the right over the mine and\r\nfisheries, which the purchase of the estate included, that flattered\r\nhis notions of restoring the family greatness. Here he and his son\r\nafter him could lord it, as he thought, on a large scale, and direct\r\nat their sovereign will and pleasure the industry of hundreds of poor\r\npeople, scattered along the coast, or huddled together in the little\r\nvillages inland. This was a tempting prospect, and it could be secured\r\nfor forty thousand pounds--which was just ten thousand pounds less\r\nthan he had made up his mind to give, when he first determined to\r\nmetamorphose himself from a plain merchant into a magnificent landed\r\ngentleman. People who knew these facts were, as I have said, not much\r\nsurprised at Mr. Frankland\'s readiness to purchase Porthgenna Tower;\r\nand Captain Treverton, it is hardly necessary to say, was not long in\r\nclinching the bargain on his side. The estate changed hands; and away\r\nwent old Frankland, with a tail of wiseacres from London at his heels,\r\nto work the mine and the fisheries on new scientific principles, and\r\nto beautify the old house from top to bottom with bran-new medi\xc3\xa6val\r\ndecorations under the direction of a gentleman who was said to be an\r\narchitect, but who looked, to my mind, the very image of a Popish\r\npriest in disguise. Wonderful plans and projects were they not? And\r\nhow do you think they succeeded?"\r\n\r\n"Do tell me, my dear fellow!" was the answer that fell from Mr.\r\nPhippen\'s lips.--"I wonder whether Miss Sturch keeps a bottle of\r\ncamphor julep in the family medicine-chest?" was the thought that\r\npassed through Mr. Phippen\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"Tell you!" exclaimed the vicar. "Why, of course, every one of his\r\nplans turned out a complete failure. His Cornish tenantry received him\r\nas an interloper. The antiquity of his family made no impression upon\r\nthem. It might be an old family, but it was not a Cornish family, and,\r\ntherefore, it was of no importance in their eyes. They would have gone\r\nto the world\'s end for the Trevertons; but not a man would move a\r\nstep out of his way for the Franklands. As for the mine, it seemed to\r\nbe inspired with the same mutinous spirit that possessed the tenantry.\r\nThe wiseacres from London blasted in all directions on the profoundest\r\nscientific principles, and brought about sixpennyworth of ore to the\r\nsurface for every five pounds spent in getting it up. The fisheries\r\nturned out little better. A new plan for curing pilchards, which was a\r\nmarvel of economy in theory, proved to be a perfect phenomenon of\r\nextravagance in practice. The only item of luck in old Frankland\'s\r\nlarge sum of misfortunes was produced by his quarreling in good time\r\nwith the medi\xc3\xa6val architect, who was like a Popish priest in disguise.\r\nThis fortunate event saved the new owner of Porthgenna all the money\r\nhe might otherwise have spent in restoring and redecorating the whole\r\nsuite of rooms on the north side of the house, which had been left to\r\ngo to rack and ruin for more than fifty years past, and which remain\r\nin their old neglected condition to this day. To make a long story\r\nshort, after uselessly spending more thousands of pounds at Porthgenna\r\nthan I should like to reckon up, old Frankland gave in at last, left\r\nthe place in disgust to the care of his steward, who was charged never\r\nto lay out another farthing on it, and returned to this neighborhood.\r\nBeing in high dudgeon, and happening to catch Captain Treverton on\r\nshore when he got back, the first thing he did was to abuse Porthgenna\r\nand all the people about it a little too vehemently in the Captain\'s\r\npresence. This led to a coolness between the two neighbors, which\r\nmight have ended in the breaking off of all intercourse, but for the\r\nchildren on either side, who would see each other just as often as\r\never, and who ended, by dint of willful persistency, in putting an end\r\nto the estrangement between the fathers by making it look simply\r\nridiculous. Here, in my opinion, lies the most curious part of the\r\nstory. Important family interests depended on those two young people\r\nfalling in love with each other; and, wonderful to relate, that (as\r\nyou know, after my confession at breakfast-time) was exactly what they\r\ndid. Here is a case of the most romantic love-match, which is also the\r\nmarriage, of all others, that the parents on both sides had the\r\nstrongest worldly interest in promoting. Shakspeare may say what he\r\npleases, the course of true love does run smooth sometimes. Never was\r\nthe marriage service performed to better purpose than when I read it\r\nthis morning. The estate being entailed on Leonard, Captain\r\nTreverton\'s daughter now goes back, in the capacity of mistress, to\r\nthe house and lands which her father sold. Rosamond being an only\r\nchild, the purchase-money of Porthgenna, which old Frankland once\r\nlamented as money thrown away, will now, when the Captain dies, be the\r\nmarriage-portion of young Frankland\'s wife. I don\'t know what you\r\nthink of the beginning and middle of my story, Phippen, but the end\r\nought to satisfy you, at any rate. Did you ever hear of a bride and\r\nbridegroom who started with fairer prospects in life than our bride\r\nand bridegroom of to-day?"\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Phippen could make any reply, Miss Sturch put her head out\r\nof the school-room window; and seeing the two gentlemen approaching,\r\nbeamed on them with her invariable smile. Then addressing the vicar,\r\nsaid in her softest tones:\r\n\r\n"I regret extremely to trouble you, Sir, but I find Robert very\r\nintractable this morning with his Multiplication Table."\r\n\r\n"Where does he stick now?" asked Doctor Chennery.\r\n\r\n"At seven times eight, Sir," replied Miss Sturch.\r\n\r\n"Bob!" shouted the vicar through the window. "Seven times eight?"\r\n\r\n"Forty-three," answered the whimpering voice of the invisible Bob.\r\n\r\n"You shall have one more chance before I get my cane," said Doctor\r\nChennery. "Now, then, look out! Seven times--"\r\n\r\n"My dear, good friend," interposed Mr. Phippen, "if you cane that very\r\nunhappy boy he will scream. My nerves have been tried once this\r\nmorning by the camp-stool. I shall be totally shattered if I hear\r\nscreams. Give me time to get out of the way, and allow me also to\r\nspare dear Miss Sturch the sad spectacle of correction (so shocking to\r\nsensibilities like hers) by asking her for a little camphor julep, and\r\nso giving her an excuse for getting out of the way like me. I think I\r\ncould have done without the camphor julep under any other\r\ncircumstances; but I ask for it unhesitatingly now, as much for Miss\r\nSturch\'s sake as for the sake of my own poor nerves.--Have you got\r\ncamphor julep, Miss Sturch? Say yes, I beg and entreat, and give me an\r\nopportunity of escorting you out of the way of the screams."\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Sturch--whose well-trained sensibilities were proof against\r\nthe longest paternal caning and the loudest filial acknowledgment of\r\nit in the way of screams--tripped up stairs to fetch the camphor\r\njulep, as smiling and self-possessed as ever, Master Bob, finding\r\nhimself left alone with his sisters in the school-room, sidled up to\r\nthe youngest of the two, produced from the pocket of his trowsers\r\nthree frowsy acidulated drops looking very much the worse for wear,\r\nand, attacking Miss Amelia on the weak, or greedy side of her\r\ncharacter, artfully offered the drops in exchange for information on\r\nthe subject of seven times eight. "You like \'em?" whispered Bob. "Oh,\r\ndon\'t I!" answered Amelia. "Seven times eight?" asked Bob.\r\n"Fifty-six," answered Amelia. "Sure?" said Bob. "Certain," said\r\nAmelia. The drops changed hands, and the catastrophe of the domestic\r\ndrama changed with them. Just as Miss Sturch appeared with the camphor\r\njulep at the garden door, in the character of medical Hebe to Mr.\r\nPhippen, her intractable pupil showed himself to his father at the\r\nschool-room window, in the character, arithmetically speaking, of a\r\nreformed son. The cane reposed for the day; and Mr. Phippen drank his\r\nglass of camphor julep with a mind at ease on the twin subjects of\r\nMiss Sturch\'s sensibilities and Master Bob\'s screams.\r\n\r\n"Most gratifying in every way," said the Martyr to Dyspepsia, smacking\r\nhis lips with great relish, as he drained the last drops out of the\r\nglass. "My nerves are spared, Miss Sturch\'s feelings are spared, and\r\nthe dear boy\'s back is spared. You have no idea how relieved I feel,\r\nChennery. Whereabouts were we in that delightful story of yours when\r\nthis little domestic interruption occurred?"\r\n\r\n"At the end of it, to be sure," said the vicar. "The bride and\r\nbridegroom are some miles on their way by this time to spend the\r\nhoney-moon at St. Swithin\'s-on-Sea. Captain Treverton is only left\r\nbehind for a day. He received his sailing orders on Monday, and he\r\nwill be off to Portsmouth to-morrow morning to take command of his\r\nship. Though he won\'t admit it in plain words, I happen to know that\r\nRosamond has persuaded him to make this his last cruise. She has a\r\nplan for getting him back to Porthgenna, to live there with her\r\nhusband, which I hope and believe will succeed. The west rooms at the\r\nold house, in one of which Mrs. Treverton died, are not to be used at\r\nall by the young married couple. They have engaged a builder--a\r\nsensible, practical man, this time--to survey the neglected north\r\nrooms, with a view to their redecoration and thorough repair in every\r\nway. This part of the house can not possibly be associated with any\r\nmelancholy recollections in Captain Treverton\'s mind, for neither he\r\nnor any one else ever entered it during the period of his residence at\r\nPorthgenna. Considering the change in the look of the place which this\r\nproject of repairing the north rooms is sure to produce, and taking\r\ninto account also the softening effect of time on all painful\r\nrecollections, I should say there was a fair prospect of Captain\r\nTreverton\'s returning to pass the end of his days among his old\r\ntenantry. It will be a great chance for Leonard Frankland if he does,\r\nfor he would be sure to dispose the people at Porthgenna kindly toward\r\ntheir new master. Introduced among his Cornish tenants under Captain\r\nTreverton\'s wing, Leonard is sure to get on well with them, provided\r\nhe abstains from showing too much of the family pride which he has\r\ninherited from his father. He is a little given to overrate the\r\nadvantages of birth and the importance of rank--but that is really the\r\nonly noticeable defect in his character. In all other respects I can\r\nhonestly say of him that he deserves what he has got--the best wife in\r\nthe world. What a life of happiness, Phippen, seems to be awaiting\r\nthese lucky young people! It is a bold thing to say of any mortal\r\ncreatures, but, look as far as I may, not a cloud can I see any where\r\non their future prospects."\r\n\r\n"You excellent creature!" exclaimed Mr. Phippen, affectionately\r\nsqueezing the vicar\'s hand. "How I enjoy hearing you! how I luxuriate\r\nin your bright view of life!"\r\n\r\n"And is it not the true view--especially in the case of young\r\nFrankland and his wife?" inquired the vicar.\r\n\r\n"If you ask me," said Mr. Phippen, with a mournful smile, and a\r\nphilosophic calmness of manner, "I can only answer that the direction\r\nof a man\'s speculative views depends--not to mince the matter--on the\r\nstate of his secretions. Your biliary secretions, dear friend, are all\r\nright, and you take bright views. My biliary secretions are all wrong,\r\nand I take dark views. You look at the future prospects of this young\r\nmarried couple, and say there is no cloud over them. I don\'t dispute\r\nthe assertion, not having the pleasure of knowing either bride or\r\nbridegroom. But I look up at the sky over our heads--I remember that\r\nthere was not a cloud on it when we first entered the garden--I now\r\nsee, just over those two trees growing so close together, a cloud that\r\nhas appeared unexpectedly from nobody knows where--and I draw my own\r\nconclusions. Such," said Mr. Phippen, ascending the garden steps on\r\nhis way into the house, "is my philosophy. It may be tinged with bile,\r\nbut it is philosophy for all that."\r\n\r\n"All the philosophy in the world," said the vicar, following his guest\r\nup the steps, "will not shake my conviction that Leonard Frankland and\r\nhis wife have a happy future before them."\r\n\r\nMr. Phippen laughed, and, waiting on the steps till his host joined\r\nhim, took Doctor Chennery\'s arm in the friendliest manner.\r\n\r\n"You have told a charming story, Chennery," he said, "and you have\r\nended it with a charming sentiment. But, my dear friend, though your\r\nhealthy mind (influenced by an enviably easy digestion) despises my\r\nbilious philosophy, don\'t quite forget the cloud over the two trees.\r\nLook up at it now--it is getting darker and bigger already."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the roof of a widowed mother, Miss Mowlem lived humbly at St.\r\nSwithin\'s-on-Sea. In the spring of the year eighteen hundred and\r\nforty-four, the heart of Miss Mowlem\'s widowed mother was gladdened by\r\na small legacy. Turning over in her mind the various uses to which the\r\nmoney might be put, the discreet old lady finally decided on investing\r\nit in furniture, on fitting up the first floor and the second floor of\r\nher house in the best taste, and on hanging a card in the parlor\r\nwindow to inform the public that she had furnished apartments to let.\r\nBy the summer the apartments were ready, and the card was put up. It\r\nhad hardly been exhibited a week before a dignified personage in black\r\napplied to look at the rooms, expressed himself as satisfied with\r\ntheir appearance, and engaged them for a month certain, for a newly\r\nmarried lady and gentleman, who might be expected to take possession\r\nin a few days. The dignified personage in black was Captain\r\nTreverton\'s servant, and the lady and gentleman, who arrived in due\r\ntime to take possession, were Mr. and Mrs. Frankland.\r\n\r\nThe natural interest which Mrs. Mowlem felt in her youthful first\r\nlodgers was necessarily vivid in its nature; but it was apathy itself\r\ncompared to the sentimental interest which her daughter took in\r\nobserving the manners and customs of the lady and gentleman in their\r\ncapacity of bride and bridegroom. From the moment when Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland entered the house, Miss Mowlem began to study them with all\r\nthe ardor of an industrious scholar who attacks a new branch of\r\nknowledge. At every spare moment of the day, this industrious young\r\nlady occupied herself in stealing up stairs to collect observations,\r\nand in running down stairs to communicate them to her mother. By the\r\ntime the married couple had been in the house a week, Miss Mowlem had\r\nmade such good use of her eyes, ears, and opportunities that she could\r\nhave written a seven days\' diary of the lives of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland with the truth and minuteness of Mr. Samuel Pepys himself.\r\n\r\nBut, learn as much as we may, the longer we live the more information\r\nthere is to acquire. Seven days\' patient accumulation of facts in\r\nconnection with the honey-moon had not placed Miss Mowlem beyond the\r\nreach of further discoveries. On the morning of the eighth day, after\r\nbringing down the breakfast tray, this observant spinster stole up\r\nstairs again, according to custom, to drink at the spring of knowledge\r\nthrough the key-hole channel of the drawing-room door. After an\r\nabsence of five minutes she descended to the kitchen, breathless with\r\nexcitement, to announce a fresh discovery in connection with Mr. and\r\nMrs. Frankland to her venerable mother.\r\n\r\n"Whatever do you think she\'s doing now?" cried Miss Mowlem, with\r\nwidely opened eyes and highly elevated hands.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that\'s useful," answered Mrs. Mowlem, with sarcastic\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\n"She\'s actually sitting on his knee! Mother, did you ever sit on\r\nfather\'s knee when you were married?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, my dear. When me and your poor father married, we were\r\nneither of us flighty young people, and we knew better."\r\n\r\n"She\'s got her head on his shoulder," proceeded Miss Mowlem, more and\r\nmore agitatedly, "and her arms round his neck--both her arms, mother,\r\nas tight as can be."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t believe it," exclaimed Mrs. Mowlem, indignantly. "A lady like\r\nher, with riches, and accomplishments, and all that, demean herself\r\nlike a housemaid with a sweetheart. Don\'t tell me, I won\'t believe\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nIt was true though, for all that. There were plenty of chairs in Mrs.\r\nMowlem\'s drawing-room; there were three beautifully bound books on\r\nMrs. Mowlem\'s Pembroke table (the Antiquities of St. Swithin\'s,\r\nSmallridge\'s Sermons, and Klopstock\'s Messiah in English prose)--Mrs.\r\nFrankland might have sat on purple morocco leather, stuffed with the\r\nbest horse-hair, might have informed and soothed her mind with\r\narch\xc3\xa6ological diversions, with orthodox native theology, and with\r\ndevotional poetry of foreign origin--and yet, so frivolous is the\r\nnature of woman, she was perverse enough to prefer doing nothing, and\r\nperching herself uncomfortably on her husband\'s knee!\r\n\r\nShe sat for some time in the undignified position which Miss Mowlem\r\nhad described with such graphic correctness to her mother--then drew\r\nback a little, raised her head, and looked earnestly into the quiet,\r\nmeditative face of the blind man.\r\n\r\n"Lenny, you are very silent this morning," she said. "What are you\r\nthinking about? If you will tell me all your thoughts, I will tell you\r\nall mine."\r\n\r\n"Would you really care to hear all my thoughts?" asked Leonard.\r\n\r\n"Yes; all. I shall be jealous of any thoughts that you keep to\r\nyourself. Tell me what you were thinking of just now! Me?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly of you."\r\n\r\n"More shame for you. Are you tired of me in eight days? I have not\r\nthought of any body but you ever since we have been here. Ah! you\r\nlaugh. Oh, Lenny, I do love you so; how can I think of any body but\r\nyou? No! I sha\'n\'t kiss you. I want to know what you were thinking\r\nabout first."\r\n\r\n"Of a dream, Rosamond, that I had last night. Ever since the first\r\ndays of my blindness--Why, I thought you were not going to kiss me\r\nagain till I had told you what I was thinking about!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help kissing you, Lenny, when you talk of the loss of your\r\nsight. Tell me, my poor love, do I help to make up for that loss? Are\r\nyou happier than you used to be? and have I some share in making that\r\nhappiness, though it is ever so little?"\r\n\r\nShe turned her head away as she spoke, but Leonard was too quick for\r\nher. His inquiring fingers touched her cheek. "Rosamond, you are\r\ncrying," he said.\r\n\r\n"I crying!" she answered, with a sudden assumption of gayety. "No,"\r\nshe continued, after a moment\'s pause. "I will never deceive you,\r\nlove, even in the veriest trifle. My eyes serve for both of us now,\r\ndon\'t they? you depend on me for all that your touch fails to tell\r\nyou, and I must never be unworthy of my trust--must I? I did cry,\r\nLenny--but only a very little. I don\'t know how it was, but I never,\r\nin all my life, seemed to pity you and feel for you as I did just at\r\nthat moment. Never mind, I\'ve done now. Go on--do go on with what you\r\nwere going to say."\r\n\r\n"I was going to say, Rosamond, that I have observed one curious thing\r\nabout myself since I lost my sight. I dream a great deal, but I never\r\ndream of myself as a blind man. I often visit in my dreams places that\r\nI saw and people whom I knew when I had my sight, and though I feel as\r\nmuch myself, at those visionary times, as I am now when I am\r\nwide-awake, I never by any chance feel blind. I wander about all sorts\r\nof old walks in my sleep, and never grope my way. I talk to all sorts\r\nof old friends in my sleep, and see the expression in their faces\r\nwhich, waking, I shall never see again. I have lost my sight more than\r\na year now, and yet it was like the shock of a new discovery to me to\r\nwake up last night from my dream, and remember suddenly that I was\r\nblind."\r\n\r\n"What dream was it, Lenny?"\r\n\r\n"Only a dream of the place where I first met you when we were both\r\nchildren. I saw the glen, as it was years ago, with the great twisted\r\nroots of the trees, and the blackberry bushes twining about them in a\r\nstill shadowed light that came through thick leaves from the rainy\r\nsky. I saw the mud on the walk in the middle of the glen, with the\r\nmarks of the cows\' hoofs in some places, and the sharp circles in\r\nothers where some countrywomen had been lately trudging by on pattens.\r\nI saw the muddy water running down on either side of the path after\r\nthe shower; and I saw you, Rosamond, a naughty girl, all covered with\r\nclay and wet--just as you were in the reality--soiling your bright\r\nblue pelisse and your pretty little chubby hands by making a dam to\r\nstop the running water, and laughing at the indignation of your\r\nnurse-maid when she tried to pull you away and take you home. I saw\r\nall that exactly as it really was in the by-gone time; but, strangely\r\nenough, I did not see myself as the boy I then was. You were a little\r\ngirl, and the glen was in its old neglected state, and yet, though I\r\nwas all in the past so far, I was in the present as regarded myself.\r\nThroughout the whole dream I was uneasily conscious of being a grown\r\nman--of being, in short, exactly what I am now, excepting always that\r\nI was not blind."\r\n\r\n"What a memory you must have, love, to be able to recall all those\r\nlittle circumstances after the years that have passed since that wet\r\nday in the glen! How well you recollect what I was as a child! Do you\r\nremember in the same vivid way what I looked like a year ago when you\r\nsaw me--Oh, Lenny, it almost breaks my heart to think of it!--when you\r\nsaw me for the last time?"\r\n\r\n"Do I remember, Rosamond! My last look at your face has painted your\r\nportrait in my memory in colors that can never change. I have many\r\npictures in my mind, but your picture is the clearest and brightest of\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"And it is the picture of me at my best--painted in my youth, dear,\r\nwhen my face was always confessing how I loved you, though my lips\r\nsaid nothing. There is some consolation in that thought. When years\r\nhave passed over us both, Lenny, and when time begins to set his mark\r\non me, you will not say to yourself, \'My Rosamond is beginning to\r\nfade; she grows less and less like what she was when I married her.\' I\r\nshall never grow old, love, for you! The bright young picture in your\r\nmind will still be my picture when my cheeks are wrinkled and my hair\r\nis gray."\r\n\r\n"Still your picture--always the same, grow as old as I may."\r\n\r\n"But are you sure it is clear in every part? Are there no doubtful\r\nlines, no unfinished corners any where? I have not altered yet since\r\nyou saw me--I am just what I was a year ago. Suppose I ask you what I\r\nam like now, could you tell me without making a mistake?"\r\n\r\n"Try me."\r\n\r\n"May I? You shall be put through a complete catechism! I don\'t tire\r\nyou sitting on your knee, do I? Well, in the first place, how tall am\r\nI when we both stand up side by side?"\r\n\r\n"You just reach to my ear."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, to begin with. Now for the next question. What does my\r\nhair look like in your portrait?"\r\n\r\n"It is dark brown--there is a great deal of it--and it grows rather\r\ntoo low on your forehead for the taste of some people--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind about \'some people;\' does it grow too low for your taste?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I like it to grow low; I like all those little natural\r\nwaves that it makes against your forehead; I like it taken back, as\r\nyou wear it, in plain bands, which leave your ears and your cheeks\r\nvisible; and above all things, I like that big glossy knot that it\r\nmakes where it is all gathered up together at the back of your head."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lenny, how well you remember me, so far! Now go a little lower."\r\n\r\n"A little lower is down to your eyebrows. They are very nicely shaped\r\neyebrows in my picture--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but they have a fault. Come! tell me what the fault is."\r\n\r\n"They are not quite so strongly marked as they might be."\r\n\r\n"Right again! And my eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Brown eyes, large eyes, wakeful eyes, that are always looking about\r\nthem. Eyes that can be very soft at one time, and very bright at\r\nanother. Eyes tender and clear, just at the present moment, but\r\ncapable, on very slight provocation, of opening rather too widely, and\r\nlooking rather too brilliantly resolute."\r\n\r\n"Mind you don\'t make them look so now! What is there below the eyes?"\r\n\r\n"A nose that is not quite big enough to be in proper proportion with\r\nthem. A nose that has a slight tendency to be--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say the horrid English word! Spare my feelings by putting it in\r\nFrench. Say _retrouss\xc3\xa9_, and skip over my nose as fast as possible."\r\n\r\n"I must stop at the mouth, then, and own that it is as near perfection\r\nas possible. The lips are lovely in shape, fresh in color, and\r\nirresistible in expression. They smile in my portrait, and I am sure\r\nthey are smiling at me now."\r\n\r\n"How could they do otherwise when they are getting so much praise? My\r\nvanity whispers to me that I had better stop the catechism here. If I\r\ntalk about my complexion, I shall only hear that it is of the dusky\r\nsort; and that there is never red enough in it except when I am\r\nwalking, or confused, or angry. If I ask a question about my figure, I\r\nshall receive the dreadful answer, \'You are dangerously inclined to be\r\nfat.\' If I say, How do I dress? I shall be told, Not soberly enough;\r\nyou are as fond as a child of gay colors--No! I will venture no more\r\nquestions. But, vanity apart, Lenny, I am so glad, so proud, so happy\r\nto find that you can keep the image of me clearly in your mind. I\r\nshall do my best now to look and dress like your last remembrance of\r\nme. My love of loves! I will do you credit--I will try if I can\'t make\r\nyou envied for your wife. You deserve a hundred thousand kisses for\r\nsaying your catechism so well--and there they are!"\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Frankland was conferring the reward of merit on her\r\nhusband, the sound of a faint, small, courteously significant cough\r\nmade itself timidly audible in a corner of the room. Turning round\r\ninstantly, with the quickness that characterized all her actions, Mrs.\r\nFrankland, to her horror and indignation, confronted Miss Mowlem\r\nstanding just inside the door, with a letter in her hand and a blush\r\nof sentimental agitation on her simpering face.\r\n\r\n"You wretch! how dare you come in without knocking at the door?" cried\r\nRosamond, starting to her feet with a stamp, and passing in an instant\r\nfrom the height of fondness to the height of indignation.\r\n\r\nMiss Mowlem shook guiltily before the bright, angry eyes that looked\r\nthrough and through her, turned very pale, held out the letter\r\napologetically, and said in her meekest tones that she was very\r\nsorry.\r\n\r\n"Sorry!" exclaimed Rosamond, getting even more irritated by the\r\napology than she had been by the intrusion, and showing it by another\r\nstamp of the foot; "who cares whether you are sorry? I don\'t want your\r\nsorrow--I won\'t have it. I never was so insulted in my life--never,\r\nyou mean, prying, inquisitive creature!"\r\n\r\n"Rosamond! Rosamond! pray don\'t forget yourself!" interposed the quiet\r\nvoice of Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"Lenny, dear, I can\'t help it! That creature would drive a saint mad.\r\nShe has been prying after us ever since we have been here--you have,\r\nyou ill-bred, indelicate woman!--I suspected it before--I am certain\r\nof it now! Must we lock our doors to keep you out?--we won\'t lock our\r\ndoors! Fetch the bill! We give you warning. Mr. Frankland gives you\r\nwarning--don\'t you, Lenny? I\'ll pack up all your things, dear: she\r\nsha\'n\'t touch one of them. Go down stairs and make out your bill, and\r\ngive your mother warning. Mr. Frankland says he won\'t have his rooms\r\nburst into, and his doors listened at by inquisitive women--and I say\r\nso too. Put that letter down on the table--unless you want to open it\r\nand read it--put it down, you audacious woman, and fetch the bill, and\r\ntell your mother we are going to leave the house directly!"\r\n\r\nAt this dreadful threat, Miss Mowlem, who was soft and timid, as well\r\nas curious, by nature, wrung her hands in despair, and overflowed\r\nmeekly in a shower of tears.\r\n\r\n"Oh! good gracious Heavens above!" cried Miss Mowlem, addressing\r\nherself distractedly to the ceiling, "what will mother say! whatever\r\nwill become of me now! Oh, ma\'am! I thought I knocked--I did, indeed!\r\nOh, ma\'am! I humbly beg pardon, and I\'ll never intrude again. Oh,\r\nma\'am! mother\'s a widow, and this is the first time we have let the\r\nlodgings, and the furniture\'s swallowed up all our money, and oh,\r\nma\'am! ma\'am! how I shall catch it if you go!" Here words failed Miss\r\nMowlem, and hysterical sobs pathetically supplied their place.\r\n\r\n"Rosamond!" said Mr. Frankland. There was an accent of sorrow in his\r\nvoice this time, as well as an accent of remonstrance. Rosamond\'s\r\nquick ear caught the alteration in his tone. As she looked round at\r\nhim her color changed, her head drooped a little, and her whole\r\nexpression altered on the instant. She stole gently to her husband\'s\r\nside with softened, saddened eyes, and put her lips caressingly close\r\nto his ear.\r\n\r\n"Lenny," she whispered, "have I made you angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be angry with you, Rosamond," was the quiet answer. "I only\r\nwish, love, that you could have controlled yourself a little sooner."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry--so very, very sorry!" The fresh, soft lips came closer\r\nstill to his ear as they whispered these penitent words; and the\r\ncunning little hand crept up tremblingly round his neck and began to\r\nplay with his hair. "So sorry, and so ashamed of myself! But it was\r\nenough to make almost any body angry, just at first--wasn\'t it, dear?\r\nAnd you will forgive me--won\'t you, Lenny?--if I promise never to\r\nbehave so badly again? Never mind that wretched whimpering fool at the\r\ndoor," said Rosamond, undergoing a slight relapse as she looked round\r\nat Miss Mowlem, standing immovably repentant against the wall, with\r\nher face buried in a dingy-white pocket-handkerchief. "I\'ll make it up\r\nwith her; I\'ll stop her crying; I\'ll take her out of the room; I\'ll do\r\nany thing in the world that\'s kind to her, if you will only forgive\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"A polite word or two is all that is wanted--nothing more than a\r\npolite word or two," said Mr. Frankland, rather coldly and\r\nconstrainedly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry any more, for goodness sake!" said Rosamond, walking\r\nstraight up to Miss Mowlem, and pulling the dingy-white\r\npocket-handkerchief away from her face without the least ceremony.\r\n"There! leave off, will you? I am very sorry I was in a\r\npassion--though you had no business to come in without knocking--I\r\nnever meant to distress you, and I\'ll never say a hard word to you\r\nagain, if you will only knock at the door for the future, and leave\r\noff crying now. _Do_ leave off crying, you tiresome creature! We are\r\nnot going away. We don\'t want your mother, or the bill, or any thing.\r\nHere! here\'s a present for you, if you\'ll leave off crying. Here\'s my\r\nneck-ribbon--I saw you trying it on yesterday afternoon, when I was\r\nlying down on the bedroom sofa, and you thought I was asleep. Never\r\nmind; I\'m not angry about that. Take the ribbon--take it as a\r\npeace-offering, if you won\'t as a present. You _shall_ take it!--No,\r\nI don\'t mean that--I mean, please take it! There, I\'ve pinned it on.\r\nAnd now, shake hands and be friends, and go up stairs and see how it\r\nlooks in the glass." With these words, Mrs. Frankland opened the door,\r\nadministered, under the pretense of a pat on the shoulder, a\r\ngood-humored shove to the amazed and embarrassed Miss Mowlem, closed\r\nthe door again, and resumed her place in a moment on her husband\'s\r\nknee.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve made it up with her, dear. I\'ve sent her away with my bright\r\ngreen ribbon, and it makes her look as yellow as a guinea, and as ugly\r\nas--" Rosamond stopped, and looked anxiously into Mr. Frankland\'s\r\nface. "Lenny!" she said, sadly, putting her cheek against his, "are\r\nyou angry with me still?"\r\n\r\n"My love, I was never angry with you. I never can be."\r\n\r\n"I will always keep my temper down for the future, Lenny!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will, Rosamond. But never mind that. I am not thinking\r\nof your temper now."\r\n\r\n"Of what, then?"\r\n\r\n"Of the apology you made to Miss Mowlem."\r\n\r\n"Did I not say enough? I\'ll call her back if you like--I\'ll make\r\nanother penitent speech--I\'ll do any thing but kiss her. I really\r\ncan\'t do that--I can\'t kiss any body now but you."\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear love, how very much like a child you are still in some\r\nof your ways! You said more than enough to Miss Mowlem--far more. And\r\nif you will pardon me for making the remark, I think in your\r\ngenerosity and good-nature you a little forgot yourself with the young\r\nwoman. I don\'t so much allude to your giving her the ribbon--though,\r\nperhaps, that might have been done a little less familiarly--but, from\r\nwhat I heard you say, I infer that you actually went the length of\r\nshaking hands with her."\r\n\r\n"Was that wrong? I thought it was the kindest way of making it up."\r\n\r\n"My dear, it is an excellent way of making it up between equals. But\r\nconsider the difference between your station in society and Miss\r\nMowlem\'s."\r\n\r\n"I will try and consider it, if you wish me, love. But I think I take\r\nafter my father, who never troubles his head (dear old man!) about\r\ndifferences of station. I can\'t help liking people who are kind to\r\nme, without thinking whether they are above my rank or below it; and\r\nwhen I got cool, I must confess I felt just as vexed with myself for\r\nfrightening and distressing that unlucky Miss Mowlem as if her station\r\nhad been equal to mine. I will try to think as you do, Lenny; but I am\r\nvery much afraid that I have got, without knowing exactly how, to be\r\nwhat the newspapers call a Radical."\r\n\r\n"My dear Rosamond! don\'t talk of yourself in that way, even in joke.\r\nYou ought to be the last person in the world to confuse those\r\ndistinctions in rank on which the whole well-being of society\r\ndepends."\r\n\r\n"Does it really? And yet, dear, we don\'t seem to have been created\r\nwith such very wide distinctions between us. We have all got the same\r\nnumber of arms and legs; we are all hungry and thirsty, and hot in the\r\nsummer and cold in the winter; we all laugh when we are pleased, and\r\ncry when we are distressed; and, surely, we have all got very much the\r\nsame feelings, whether we are high or whether we are low. I could not\r\nhave loved you better, Lenny, than I do now if I had been a duchess,\r\nor less than I do now if I had been a servant-girl."\r\n\r\n"My love, you are not a servant-girl. And, as to what you say about\r\nbeing a duchess, let me remind you that you are not so much below a\r\nduchess as you seem to think. Many a lady of high title can not look\r\nback on such a line of ancestors as yours. Your father\'s family,\r\nRosamond, is one of the oldest in England: even _my_ father\'s family\r\nhardly dates back so far; and we were landed gentry when many a name\r\nin the peerage was not heard of. It is really almost laughably absurd\r\nto hear you talking of yourself as a Radical."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t talk of myself so again, Lenny--only don\'t look so serious. I\r\nwill be a Tory, dear, if you will give me a kiss, and let me sit on\r\nyour knee a little longer."\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland\'s gravity was not proof against his wife\'s change of\r\npolitical principles, and the conditions which she annexed to it. His\r\nface cleared up, and he laughed almost as gayly as Rosamond herself.\r\n\r\n"By the bye," he said, after an interval of silence had given him time\r\nto collect his thoughts, "did I not hear you tell Miss Mowlem to put a\r\nletter down on the table? Is it a letter for you or for me?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot all about the letter," said Rosamond, running to the\r\ntable. "It is for you, Lenny--and, goodness me! here\'s the Porthgenna\r\npostmark on it."\r\n\r\n"It must be from the builder whom I sent down to the old house about\r\nthe repairs. Lend me your eyes, love, and let us hear what he says."\r\n\r\nRosamond opened the letter, drew a stool to her husband\'s feet, and,\r\nsitting down with her arms on his knees, read as follows:\r\n\r\n     "TO LEONARD FRANKLAND, ESQ.:\r\n\r\n     "SIR,--Agreeably to the instructions with which you favored\r\n     me, I have proceeded to survey Porthgenna Tower, with a\r\n     view to ascertaining what repairs the house in general, and\r\n     the north side of it in particular, may stand in need of.\r\n\r\n     "As regards the outside, a little cleaning and new pointing\r\n     is all that the building wants. The walls and foundations\r\n     seem made to last forever. Such strong, solid work I never\r\n     set eyes on before.\r\n\r\n     "Inside the house, I can not report so favorably. The rooms\r\n     in the west front, having been inhabited during the period\r\n     of Captain Treverton\'s occupation, and having been well\r\n     looked after since, are in tolerably sound condition. I\r\n     should say two hundred pounds would cover the expense of\r\n     all repairs in my line which these rooms need. This sum\r\n     would not include the restoration of the western staircase,\r\n     which has given a little in some places, and the banisters\r\n     of which are decidedly insecure from the first to the\r\n     second landing. From twenty-five to thirty pounds would\r\n     suffice to set this all right.\r\n\r\n     "In the rooms on the north front, the state of\r\n     dilapidation, from top to bottom, is as bad as can be. From\r\n     all that I could ascertain, nobody ever went near these\r\n     rooms in Captain Treverton\'s time, or has ever entered them\r\n     since. The people who now keep the house have a\r\n     superstitious dread of opening any of the north doors, in\r\n     consequence of the time that has elapsed since any living\r\n     being has passed through them. Nobody would volunteer to\r\n     accompany me in my survey, and nobody could tell me which\r\n     keys fitted which room doors in any part of the north side.\r\n     I could find no plan containing the names or numbers of\r\n     the rooms; nor, to my surprise, were there any labels\r\n     attached separately to the keys. They were given to me, all\r\n     hanging together on a large ring, with an ivory label on\r\n     it, which was only marked--Keys of the North Rooms. I take\r\n     the liberty of mentioning these particulars in order to\r\n     account for my having, as you might think, delayed my stay\r\n     at Porthgenna Tower longer than is needful. I lost nearly a\r\n     whole day in taking the keys off the ring, and fitting them\r\n     at hazard to the right doors. And I occupied some hours of\r\n     another day in marking each door with a number on the\r\n     outside, and putting a corresponding label to each key,\r\n     before I replaced it on the ring, in order to prevent the\r\n     possibility of future errors and delays.\r\n\r\n     "As I hope to furnish you, in a few days, with a detailed\r\n     estimate of the repairs needed in the north part of the\r\n     house, from basement to roof, I need only say here that\r\n     they will occupy some time, and will be of the most\r\n     extensive nature. The beams of the staircase and the\r\n     flooring of the first story have got the dry rot. The damp\r\n     in some rooms, and the rats in others, have almost\r\n     destroyed the wainscotings. Four of the mantel-pieces have\r\n     given out from the walls, and all the ceilings are either\r\n     stained, cracked, or peeled away in large patches. The\r\n     flooring is, in general, in a better condition than I had\r\n     anticipated; but the shutters and window-sashes are so\r\n     warped as to be useless. It is only fair to acknowledge\r\n     that the expense of setting all these things to\r\n     rights--that is to say, of making the rooms safe and\r\n     habitable, and of putting them in proper condition for the\r\n     upholsterer--will be considerable. I would respectfully\r\n     suggest, in the event of your feeling any surprise or\r\n     dissatisfaction at the amount of my estimate, that you\r\n     should name a friend in whom you place confidence, to go\r\n     over the north rooms with me, keeping my estimate in his\r\n     hand. I will undertake to prove, if needful, the necessity\r\n     of each separate repair, and the justice of each separate\r\n     charge for the same, to the satisfaction of any competent\r\n     and impartial person whom you may please to select.\r\n\r\n     "Trusting to send you the estimate in a few days,\r\n\r\n     "I remain, Sir,\r\n\r\n     "Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n     "THOMAS HORLOCK."\r\n\r\n\r\n"A very honest, straightforward letter," said Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"I wish he had sent the estimate with it," said Rosamond. "Why could\r\nnot the provoking man tell us at once in round numbers what the\r\nrepairs will really cost?"\r\n\r\n"I suspect, my dear, he was afraid of shocking us, if he mentioned the\r\namount in round numbers."\r\n\r\n"That horrid money! It is always getting in one\'s way, and upsetting\r\none\'s plans. If we haven\'t got enough, let us go and borrow of\r\nsomebody who has. Do you mean to dispatch a friend to Porthgenna to go\r\nover the house with Mr. Horlock? If you do, I know who I wish you\r\nwould send."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Me, if you please--under your escort, of course. Don\'t laugh, Lenny;\r\nI would be very sharp with Mr. Horlock; I would object to every one of\r\nhis charges, and beat him down without mercy. I once saw a surveyor go\r\nover a house, and I know exactly what to do. You stamp on the floor,\r\nand knock at the walls, and scrape at the brick-work, and look up all\r\nthe chimneys, and out of all the windows--sometimes you make notes in\r\na little book, sometimes you measure with a foot-rule, sometimes you\r\nsit down all of a sudden, and think profoundly--and the end of it is\r\nthat you say the house will do very well indeed, if the tenant will\r\npull out his purse, and put it in proper repair."\r\n\r\n"Well done, Rosamond! You have one more accomplishment than I knew of;\r\nand I suppose I have no choice now but to give you an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying it. If you don\'t object, my dear, to being associated with\r\na professional assistant in the important business of checking Mr.\r\nHorlock\'s estimate, I don\'t object to paying a short visit to\r\nPorthgenna whenever you please--especially now I know that the west\r\nrooms are still habitable."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how kind of you! how pleased I shall be! how I shall enjoy seeing\r\nthe old place again before it is altered! I was only five years old,\r\nLenny, when we left Porthgenna, and I am so anxious to see what I can\r\nremember of it, after such a long, long absence as mine. Do you know,\r\nI never saw any thing of that ruinous north side of the house?--and I\r\ndo so dote on old rooms! We will go all through them, Lenny. You shall\r\nhave hold of my hand, and look with my eyes, and make as many\r\ndiscoveries as I do. I prophesy that we shall see ghosts, and find\r\ntreasures, and hear mysterious noises--and, oh heavens! what clouds of\r\ndust we shall have to go through. Pouf! the very anticipation of them\r\nchokes me already."\r\n\r\n"Now we are on the subject of Porthgenna, Rosamond, let us be serious\r\nfor one moment. It is clear to me that these repairs of the north\r\nrooms will cost a large sum of money. Now, my love, I consider no sum\r\nof money misspent, however large it may be, if it procures you\r\npleasure. I am with you heart and soul--"\r\n\r\nHe paused. His wife\'s caressing arms were twining round his neck\r\nagain, and her cheek was laid gently against his. "Go on, Lenny," she\r\nsaid, with such an accent of tenderness in the utterance of those\r\nthree simple words that his speech failed him for the moment, and all\r\nhis sensations seemed absorbed in the one luxury of listening.\r\n"Rosamond," he whispered, "there is no music in the world that touches\r\nme as your voice touches me now! I feel it all through me, as I used\r\nsometimes to feel the sky at night, in the time when I could see." As\r\nhe spoke, the caressing arms tightened round his neck, and the fervent\r\nlips softly took the place which the cheek had occupied. "Go on,\r\nLenny," they repeated, happily as well as tenderly now, "you said you\r\nwere with me, heart and soul. With me in what?"\r\n\r\n"In your project, love, for inducing your father to retire from his\r\nprofession after this last cruise, and in your hope of prevailing on\r\nhim to pass the evening of his days happily with us at Porthgenna. If\r\nthe money spent in restoring the north rooms, so that we may all live\r\nin them for the future, does indeed so alter the look of the place to\r\nhis eyes as to dissipate his old sorrowful associations with it, and\r\nto make his living there again a pleasure instead of a pain to him, I\r\nshall regard it as money well laid out. But, Rosamond, are you sure of\r\nthe success of your plan before we undertake it? Have you dropped any\r\nhint of the Porthgenna project to your father?"\r\n\r\n"I told him, Lenny, that I should never be quite comfortable unless he\r\nleft the sea and came to live with us--and he said that he would. I\r\ndid not mention a word about Porthgenna--nor did he--but he knows that\r\nwe shall live there when we are settled, and he made no conditions\r\nwhen he promised that our home should be his home."\r\n\r\n"Is the loss of your mother the only sad association he has with the\r\nplace?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. There is another association, which has never been\r\nmentioned, but which I may tell you, because there are no secrets\r\nbetween us. My mother had a favorite maid who lived with her from the\r\ntime of her marriage, and who was, accidentally, the only person\r\npresent in her room when she died. I remember hearing of this woman as\r\nbeing odd in her look and manner, and no great favorite with any body\r\nbut her mistress. Well, on the morning of my mother\'s death, she\r\ndisappeared from the house in the strangest way, leaving behind her a\r\nmost singular and mysterious letter to my father, asserting that in my\r\nmother\'s dying moments a Secret had been confided to her which she was\r\ncharged to divulge to her master when her mistress was no more; and\r\nadding that she was afraid to mention this secret, and that, to avoid\r\nbeing questioned about it, she had resolved on leaving the house\r\nforever. She had been gone some hours when the letter was opened--and\r\nshe has never been seen or heard of since that time. This circumstance\r\nseemed to make almost as strong an impression on my father\'s mind as\r\nthe shock of my mother\'s death. Our neighbors and servants all thought\r\n(as I think) that the woman was mad; but he never agreed with them,\r\nand I know that he has neither destroyed nor forgotten the letter from\r\nthat time to this."\r\n\r\n"A strange event, Rosamond--a very strange event. I don\'t wonder that\r\nit has made a lasting impression on him."\r\n\r\n"Depend upon it, Lenny, the servants and the neighbors were right--the\r\nwoman was mad. Any way, however, it was certainly a singular event in\r\nour family. All old houses have their romance--and that is the romance\r\nof our house. But years and years have passed since then; and, what\r\nwith time, and what with the changes we are going to make, I have no\r\nfear that my dear, good father will spoil our plans. Give him a new\r\nnorth garden at Porthgenna, where he can walk the decks, as I call\r\nit--give him new north rooms to live in--and I will answer for the\r\nresult. But all this is in the future; let us get back to the present\r\ntime. When shall we pay our flying visit to Porthgenna, Lenny, and\r\nplunge into the important business of checking Mr. Horlock\'s estimate\r\nfor the repairs?"\r\n\r\n"We have three weeks more to stay here, Rosamond."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and then we must go back to Long Beckley. I promised that best\r\nand biggest of men, the vicar, that we would pay our first visit to\r\nhim. He is sure not to let us off under three weeks or a month."\r\n\r\n"In that case, then, we had better say two months hence for the visit\r\nto Porthgenna. Is your writing-case in the room, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; close by us, on the table."\r\n\r\n"Write to Mr. Horlock then, love--and appoint a meeting in two months\'\r\ntime at the old house. Tell him also, as we must not trust ourselves\r\non unsafe stairs--especially considering how dependent I am on\r\nbanisters--to have the west staircase repaired immediately. And, while\r\nyou have the pen in your hand, perhaps it may save trouble if you\r\nwrite a second note to the housekeeper at Porthgenna, to tell her when\r\nshe may expect us."\r\n\r\nRosamond sat down gayly at the table, and dipped her pen in the ink\r\nwith a little flourish of triumph.\r\n\r\n"In two months," she exclaimed joyfully, "I shall see the dear old\r\nplace again! In two months, Lenny, our profane feet will be raising\r\nthe dust in the solitudes of the North Rooms."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTIMON OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimon of Athens retreated from an ungrateful world to a cavern by the\r\nsea-shore, vented his misanthropy in magnificent poetry, and enjoyed\r\nthe honor of being called "My Lord." Timon of London took refuge from\r\nhis species in a detached house at Bayswater--expressed his sentiments\r\nin shabby prose--and was only addressed as "Mr. Treverton." The one\r\npoint of resemblance which it is possible to set against these points\r\nof contrast between the two Timons consisted in this: that their\r\nmisanthropy was, at least, genuine. Both were incorrigible haters of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no better proof of the accuracy of that definition\r\nof man which describes him as an imitative animal, than is to be found\r\nin the fact that the verdict of humanity is always against any\r\nindividual member of the species who presumes to differ from the rest.\r\nA man is one of a flock, and his wool must be of the general color. He\r\nmust drink when the rest drink, and graze where the rest graze. Let\r\nhim walk at noonday with perfect composure of countenance and decency\r\nof gait, with not the slightest appearance of vacancy in his eyes or\r\nwildness in his manner, from one end of Oxford Street to the other\r\nwithout his hat, and let every one of the thousands of hat-wearing\r\npeople whom he passes be asked separately what they think of him, how\r\nmany will abstain from deciding instantly that he is mad, on no other\r\nevidence than the evidence of his bare head? Nay, more; let him\r\npolitely stop each one of those passengers, and let him explain in the\r\nplainest form of words, and in the most intelligible manner, that his\r\nhead feels more easy and comfortable without a hat than with one, how\r\nmany of his fellow mortals who decided that he was mad on first\r\nmeeting him, will change their opinion when they part from him after\r\nhearing his explanation? In the vast majority of cases, the very\r\nexplanation itself would be accepted as an excellent additional proof\r\nthat the intellect of the hatless man was indisputably deranged.\r\n\r\nStarting at the beginning of the march of life out of step with the\r\nrest of the mortal regiment, Andrew Treverton paid the penalty of his\r\nirregularity from his earliest days. He was a phenomenon in the\r\nnursery, a butt at school, and a victim at college. The ignorant\r\nnurse-maid reported him as a queer child; the learned school-master\r\ngenteelly varied the phrase, and described him as an eccentric boy;\r\nthe college tutor, harping on the same string, facetiously likened his\r\nhead to a roof, and said there was a slate loose in it. When a slate\r\nis loose, if nobody fixes it in time, it ends by falling off. In the\r\nroof of a house we view that consequence as a necessary result of\r\nneglect; in the roof of a man\'s head we are generally very much\r\nshocked and surprised by it.\r\n\r\nOverlooked in some directions and misdirected in others, Andrew\'s\r\nuncouth capacities for good tried helplessly to shape themselves. The\r\nbetter side of his eccentricity took the form of friendship. He became\r\nviolently and unintelligibly fond of one among his school-fellows--a\r\nboy who treated him with no especial consideration in the play-ground,\r\nand who gave him no particular help in the class. Nobody could\r\ndiscover the smallest reason for it, but it was nevertheless a\r\nnotorious fact that Andrew\'s pocket-money was always at this boy\'s\r\nservice, that Andrew ran about after him like a dog, and that Andrew\r\nover and over again took the blame and punishment on his own shoulders\r\nwhich ought to have fallen on the shoulders of his friend. When, a few\r\nyears afterward, that friend went to college, the lad petitioned to be\r\nsent to college too, and attached himself there more closely than ever\r\nto the strangely chosen comrade of his school-boy days. Such devotion\r\nas this must have touched any man possessed of ordinary generosity of\r\ndisposition. It made no impression whatever on the inherently base\r\nnature of Andrew\'s friend. After three years of intercourse at\r\ncollege--intercourse which was all selfishness on one side and all\r\nself-sacrifice on the other--the end came, and the light was let in\r\ncruelly on Andrew\'s eyes. When his purse grew light in his friend\'s\r\nhand, and when his acceptances were most numerous on his friend\'s\r\nbills, the brother of his honest affection, the hero of his simple\r\nadmiration, abandoned him to embarrassment, to ridicule, and to\r\nsolitude, without the faintest affectation of penitence--without so\r\nmuch even as a word of farewell.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his father\'s house, a soured man at the outset of\r\nlife--returned to be upbraided for the debts that he had contracted to\r\nserve the man who had heartlessly outraged and shamelessly cheated\r\nhim. He left home in disgrace to travel on a small allowance. The\r\ntravels were protracted, and they ended, as such travels often do, in\r\nsettled expatriation. The life he led, the company he kept, during his\r\nlong residence abroad, did him permanent and fatal harm. When he at\r\nlast returned to England, he presented himself in the most hopeless of\r\nall characters--the character of a man who believes in nothing. At\r\nthis period of his life, his one chance for the future lay in the good\r\nresults which his brother\'s influence over him might have produced.\r\nThe two had hardly resumed their intercourse of early days, when the\r\nquarrel occasioned by Captain Treverton\'s marriage broke it off\r\nforever. From that time, for all social interests and purposes, Andrew\r\nwas a lost man. From that time he met the last remonstrances that were\r\nmade to him by the last friends who took any interest in his fortunes\r\nalways with the same bitter and hopeless form of reply: "My dearest\r\nfriend forsook and cheated me," he would say. "My only brother has\r\nquarreled with me for the sake of a play-actress. What am I to expect\r\nof the rest of mankind after that? I have suffered twice for my belief\r\nin others--I will never suffer a third time. The wise man is the man\r\nwho does not disturb his heart at its natural occupation of pumping\r\nblood through his body. I have gathered my experience abroad and at\r\nhome, and have learned enough to see through the delusions of life\r\nwhich look like realities to other men\'s eyes. My business in this\r\nworld is to eat, drink, sleep, and die. Every thing else is\r\nsuperfluity--and I have done with it."\r\n\r\nThe few people who ever cared to inquire about him again, after being\r\nrepulsed by such an avowal as this, heard of him three or four years\r\nafter his brother\'s marriage in the neighborhood of Bayswater. Local\r\nreport described him as having bought the first cottage he could find\r\nwhich was cut off from other houses by a wall all round it. It was\r\nfurther rumored that he was living like a miser; that he had got an\r\nold man-servant, named Shrowl, who was even a greater enemy to mankind\r\nthan himself; that he allowed no living soul, not even an occasional\r\nchar-woman, to enter the house; that he was letting his beard grow,\r\nand that he had ordered his servant Shrowl to follow his example. In\r\nthe year eighteen hundred and forty-four, the fact of a man\'s not\r\nshaving was regarded by the enlightened majority of the English nation\r\nas a proof of unsoundness of intellect. At the present time Mr.\r\nTreverton\'s beard would only have interfered with his reputation for\r\nrespectability. Seventeen years ago it was accepted as so much\r\nadditional evidence in support of the old theory that his intellects\r\nwere deranged. He was at that very time, as his stock-broker could\r\nhave testified, one of the sharpest men of business in London; he\r\ncould argue on the wrong side of any question with an acuteness of\r\nsophistry and sarcasm that Dr. Johnson himself might have envied; he\r\nkept his household accounts right to a farthing--but what did these\r\nadvantages avail him, in the estimation of his neighbors, when he\r\npresumed to live on another plan than theirs, and when he wore a hairy\r\ncertificate of lunacy on the lower part of his face? We have advanced\r\na little in the matter of partial toleration of beards since that\r\ntime; but we have still a good deal of ground to get over. In the\r\npresent year of progress, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, would the\r\nmost trustworthy banker\'s clerk in the whole metropolis have the\r\nslightest chance of keeping his situation if he left off shaving his\r\nchin?\r\n\r\nCommon report, which calumniated Mr. Treverton as mad, had another\r\nerror to answer for in describing him as a miser. He saved more than\r\ntwo thirds of the income derived from his comfortable fortune, not\r\nbecause he liked hoarding up money, but because he had no enjoyment of\r\nthe comforts and luxuries which money is spent in procuring. To do him\r\njustice, his contempt for his own wealth was quite as hearty as his\r\ncontempt for the wealth of his neighbors. Thus characteristically\r\nwrong in endeavoring to delineate his character, report was,\r\nnevertheless, for once in a way, inconsistently right in describing\r\nhis manner of life. It was true that he had bought the first cottage\r\nhe could find that was secluded within its own walls--true that nobody\r\nwas allowed, on any pretense whatever, to enter his doors--and true\r\nthat he had met with a servant, who was even bitterer against all\r\nmankind than himself, in the person of Mr. Shrowl.\r\n\r\nThe life these two led approached as nearly to the existence of the\r\nprimitive man (or savage) as the surrounding conditions of\r\ncivilization would allow. Admitting the necessity of eating and\r\ndrinking, the first object of Mr. Treverton\'s ambition was to sustain\r\nlife with the least possible dependence on the race of men who\r\nprofessed to supply their neighbors\' bodily wants, and who, as he\r\nconceived, cheated them infamously on the strength of their\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nHaving a garden at the back of the house, Timon of London dispensed\r\nwith the green-grocer altogether by cultivating his own vegetables.\r\nThere was no room for growing wheat, or he would have turned farmer\r\nalso on his own account; but he could outwit the miller and the baker,\r\nat any rate, by buying a sack of corn, grinding it in his own\r\nhand-mill, and giving the flour to Shrowl to make into bread. On the\r\nsame principle, the meat for the house was bought wholesale of the\r\nCity salesmen--the master and servant eating as much of it in the\r\nfresh state as they could, salting the rest, and setting butchers at\r\ndefiance. As for drink, neither brewer nor publican ever had the\r\nchance of extorting a farthing from Mr. Treverton\'s pocket. He and\r\nShrowl were satisfied with beer--and they brewed for themselves. With\r\nbread, vegetables, meat, and malt liquor, these two hermits of modern\r\ndays achieved the great double purpose of keeping life in and keeping\r\nthe tradesmen out.\r\n\r\nEating like primitive men, they lived in all other respects like\r\nprimitive men also. They had pots, pans, and pipkins, two deal tables,\r\ntwo chairs, two old sofas, two short pipes, and two long cloaks. They\r\nhad no stated meal-times, no carpets and bedsteads, no cabinets,\r\nbook-cases, or ornamental knickknacks of any kind, no laundress, and\r\nno char-woman. When either of the two wanted to eat and drink, he cut\r\noff his crust of bread, cooked his bit of meat, drew his drop of beer,\r\nwithout the slightest reference to the other. When either of the two\r\nthought he wanted a clean shirt, which was very seldom, he went and\r\nwashed one for himself. When either of the two discovered that any\r\npart of the house was getting very dirty indeed, he took a bucket of\r\nwater and a birch-broom, and washed the place out like a dog-kennel.\r\nAnd, lastly, when either of the two wanted to go to sleep, he wrapped\r\nhimself up in his cloak, lay down on one of the sofas, and took what\r\nrepose he required, early in the evening or late in the morning, just\r\nas he pleased.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no baking, brewing, gardening, or cleaning to be done,\r\nthe two sat down opposite each other, and smoked for hours, generally\r\nwithout uttering a word. Whenever they did speak, they quarreled.\r\nTheir ordinary dialogue was a species of conversational prize-fight,\r\nbeginning with a sarcastic affectation of good-will on either side,\r\nand ending in hearty exchanges of violent abuse--just as the boxers go\r\nthrough the feeble formality of shaking hands before they enter on the\r\nserious practical business of beating each other\'s faces out of all\r\nlikeness to the image of man. Not having so many disadvantages of\r\nearly refinement and education to contend against as his master,\r\nShrowl generally won the victory in these engagements of the tongue.\r\nIndeed, though nominally the servant, he was really the ruling spirit\r\nin the house--acquiring unbounded influence over his master by dint of\r\noutmarching Mr. Treverton in every direction on his own ground.\r\nShrowl\'s was the harshest voice; Shrowl\'s were the bitterest sayings;\r\nand Shrowl\'s was the longest beard. The surest of all retributions is\r\nthe retribution that lies in wait for a man who boasts. Mr. Treverton\r\nwas rashly given to boasting of his independence, and when retribution\r\novertook him it assumed a personal form, and bore the name of Shrowl.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a certain morning, about three weeks after Mrs. Frankland had\r\nwritten to the housekeeper at Porthgenna Tower to mention the period\r\nat which her husband and herself might be expected there, Mr.\r\nTreverton descended, with his sourest face and his surliest manner,\r\nfrom the upper regions of the cottage to one of the rooms on the\r\nground-floor, which civilized tenants would probably have called the\r\nparlor. Like his elder brother, he was a tall, well-built man; but his\r\nbony, haggard, sallow face bore not the slightest resemblance to the\r\nhandsome, open, sunburnt face of the Captain. No one seeing them\r\ntogether could possibly have guessed that they were brothers--so\r\ncompletely did they differ in expression as well as in feature. The\r\nheart-aches that he had suffered in youth; the reckless, wandering,\r\ndissipated life that he had led in manhood; the petulance, the\r\ndisappointment, and the physical exhaustion of his latter days, had so\r\nwasted and worn him away that he looked his brother\'s elder by almost\r\ntwenty years. With unbrushed hair and unwashed face, with a tangled\r\ngray beard, and an old, patched, dirty flannel dressing-gown that hung\r\nabout him like a sack, this descendant of a wealthy and ancient family\r\nlooked as if his birthplace had been the work-house, and his vocation\r\nin life the selling of cast-off clothes.\r\n\r\nIt was breakfast-time with Mr. Treverton--that is to say, it was the\r\ntime at which he felt hungry enough to think about eating something.\r\nIn the same position over the mantel-piece in which a looking-glass\r\nwould have been placed in a household of ordinary refinement, there\r\nhung in the cottage of Timon of London a side of bacon. On the deal\r\ntable by the fire stood half a loaf of heavy-looking brown-bread; in a\r\ncorner of the room was a barrel of beer, with two battered pewter pots\r\nhitched onto nails in the wall above it; and under the grate lay a\r\nsmoky old gridiron, left just as it had been thrown down when last\r\nused and done with. Mr. Treverton took a greasy clasp-knife out of the\r\npocket of his dressing-gown, cut off a rasher of bacon, jerked the\r\ngridiron onto the fire, and began to cook his breakfast. He had just\r\nturned the rasher, when the door opened, and Shrowl entered the room,\r\nwith his pipe in his mouth, bent on the same eating errand as his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance, Shrowl was short, fat, flabby, and perfectly\r\nbald, except at the back of his head, where a ring of bristly\r\niron-gray hair projected like a collar that had got hitched out of its\r\nplace. To make amends for the scantiness of his hair, the beard which\r\nhe had cultivated by his master\'s desire grew far over his cheeks, and\r\ndrooped down on his chest in two thick jagged peaks. He wore a very\r\nold long-tailed dress-coat, which he had picked up a bargain in\r\nPetticoat Lane--a faded yellow shirt, with a large torn\r\nfrill--velveteen trowsers, turned up at the ankles--and Blucher boots\r\nthat had never been blacked since the day when they last left the\r\ncobbler\'s stall. His color was unhealthily florid, his thick lips\r\ncurled upward with a malicious grin, and his eyes were the nearest\r\napproach, in form and expression, to the eyes of a bull terrier\r\nwhich those features are capable of achieving when they are placed in\r\nthe countenance of a man. Any painter wanting to express strength,\r\ninsolence, ugliness, coarseness, and cunning in the face and figure of\r\none and the same individual, could have discovered no better model for\r\nthe purpose, all the world over, than he might have found in the\r\nperson of Mr. Shrowl.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: "HE HAD JUST TURNED THE RASHER, WHEN THE DOOR OPENED,\r\n   AND SHROWL ENTERED THE ROOM."]\r\n\r\nNeither master nor servant exchanged a word or took the smallest\r\nnotice of each other on first meeting. Shrowl stood stolidly\r\ncontemplative, with his hands in his pockets, waiting for his turn at\r\nthe gridiron. Mr. Treverton finished his cooking, took his bacon to\r\nthe table, and, cutting a crust of bread, began to eat his breakfast.\r\nWhen he had disposed of the first mouthful, he condescended to look up\r\nat Shrowl, who was at that moment opening his clasp-knife and\r\napproaching the side of bacon with slouching steps and sleepily greedy\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?" asked Mr. Treverton, pointing with\r\nindignant surprise at Shrowl\'s breast. "You ugly brute, you\'ve got a\r\nclean shirt on!"\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Sir, for noticing it," said Shrowl, with a sarcastic\r\naffectation of humility. "This is a joyful occasion, this is. I\r\ncouldn\'t do no less than put a clean shirt on, when it\'s my master\'s\r\nbirthday. Many happy returns, Sir. Perhaps you thought I should forget\r\nthat to-day was your birthday? Lord bless your sweet face, I wouldn\'t\r\nhave forgot it on any account. How old are you to-day? It\'s a long\r\ntime ago, Sir, since you was a plump smiling little boy, with a frill\r\nround your neck, and marbles in your pocket, and trowsers and\r\nwaistcoat all in one, and kisses and presents from Pa and Ma and uncle\r\nand aunt, on your birthday. Don\'t you be afraid of me wearing out this\r\nshirt by too much washing. I mean to put it away in lavender against\r\nyour next birthday; or against your funeral, which is just as likely\r\nat your time of life--isn\'t it, Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t waste a clean shirt on my funeral," retorted Mr. Treverton. "I\r\nhav\'n\'t left you any money in my will, Shrowl. You\'ll be on your way\r\nto the work-house when I\'m on my way to the grave."\r\n\r\n"Have you really made your will at last, Sir?" inquired Shrowl,\r\npausing, with an appearance of the greatest interest, in the act of\r\ncutting off his slice of bacon. "I humbly beg pardon, but I always\r\nthought you was afraid to do it."\r\n\r\nThe servant had evidently touched intentionally on one of the master\'s\r\nsore points. Mr. Treverton thumped his crust of bread on the table,\r\nand looked up angrily at Shrowl.\r\n\r\n"Afraid of making my will, you fool!" said he. "I don\'t make it, and I\r\nwon\'t make it, on principle."\r\n\r\nShrowl slowly sawed off his slice of bacon, and began to whistle a\r\ntune.\r\n\r\n"On principle," repeated Mr. Treverton. "Rich men who leave money\r\nbehind them are the farmers who raise the crop of human wickedness.\r\nWhen a man has any spark of generosity in his nature, if you want to\r\nput it out, leave him a legacy. When a man is bad, if you want to make\r\nhim worse, leave him a legacy. If you want to collect a number of men\r\ntogether for the purpose of perpetuating corruption and oppression on\r\na large scale, leave them a legacy under the form of endowing a public\r\ncharity. If you want to give a woman the best chance in the world of\r\ngetting a bad husband, leave her a legacy. _Make my will!_ I have a\r\npretty strong dislike of my species, Shrowl, but I don\'t quite hate\r\nmankind enough yet to do such mischief among them as that!" Ending his\r\ndiatribe in those words, Mr. Treverton took down one of the battered\r\npewter pots, and refreshed himself with a pint of beer.\r\n\r\nShrowl shifted the gridiron to a clear place in the fire, and chuckled\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Who the devil would you have me leave my money to?" cried Mr.\r\nTreverton, overhearing him. "To my brother, who thinks me a brute now;\r\nwho would think me a fool then; and who would encourage swindling,\r\nanyhow, by spending all my money among doxies and strolling players?\r\nTo the child of that player-woman, whom I have never set eyes on, who\r\nhas been brought up to hate me, and who would turn hypocrite directly\r\nby pretending, for decency\'s sake, to be sorry for my death? To _you_,\r\nyou human baboon!--you, who would set up a usury office directly, and\r\nprey upon the widow, the fatherless, and the unfortunate generally,\r\nall over the world? Your good health, Mr. Shrowl! I can laugh as well\r\nas you--especially when I know I\'m not going to leave you sixpence."\r\n\r\nShrowl, in his turn, began to get a little irritated now. The jeering\r\ncivility which he had chosen to assume on first entering the room gave\r\nplace to his habitual surliness of manner and his natural growling\r\nintonation of voice.\r\n\r\n"You just let me alone--will you?" he said, sitting down sulkily to\r\nhis breakfast. "I\'ve done joking for to-day; suppose you finish too.\r\nWhat\'s the use of talking nonsense about your money? You must leave it\r\nto somebody."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Mr. Treverton. "I will leave it, as I have told\r\nyou over and over again, to the first Somebody I can find who honestly\r\ndespises money, and who can\'t be made the worse, therefore, by having\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"That means nobody," grunted Shrowl.\r\n\r\n"I know it does!" retorted his master.\r\n\r\nBefore Shrowl could utter a word of rejoinder, there was a ring at the\r\ngate-bell of the cottage.\r\n\r\n"Go out," said Mr. Treverton, "and see what that is. If it\'s a woman\r\nvisitor, show her what a scarecrow you are, and frighten her away. If\r\nit\'s a man visitor--"\r\n\r\n"If it\'s a man visitor," interposed Shrowl, "I\'ll punch his head for\r\ninterrupting me at my breakfast."\r\n\r\nMr. Treverton filled and lit his pipe during his servant\'s absence.\r\nBefore the tobacco was well alight, Shrowl returned, and reported a\r\nman visitor.\r\n\r\n"Did you punch his head?" asked Mr. Treverton.\r\n\r\n"No," said Shrowl. "I picked up his letter. He poked it under the gate\r\nand went away. Here it is."\r\n\r\nThe letter was written on foolscap paper, superscribed in a round\r\nlegal hand. As Mr. Treverton opened it, two slips cut from newspapers\r\ndropped out. One fell on the table before which he was sitting; the\r\nother fluttered to the floor. This last slip Shrowl picked up and\r\nlooked over its contents, without troubling himself to go through the\r\nceremony of first asking leave.\r\n\r\nAfter slowly drawing in and slowly puffing out again one mouthful of\r\ntobacco-smoke, Mr. Treverton began to read the letter. As his eye fell\r\non the first lines, his lips began to work round the mouth-piece of\r\nthe pipe in a manner that was very unusual with him. The letter was\r\nnot long enough to require him to turn over the first leaf of it--it\r\nended at the bottom of the opening sheet. He read it down to the\r\nsignature--then looked up to the address, and went through it again\r\nfrom the beginning. His lips still continued to work round the\r\nmouth-piece of the pipe, but he smoked no more. When he had finished\r\nthe second reading, he set the letter down very gently on the table,\r\nlooked at his servant with an unaccustomed vacancy in the expression\r\nof his eyes, and took the pipe out of his mouth with a hand that\r\ntrembled a little.\r\n\r\n"Shrowl," he said, very quietly, "my brother, the Captain, is\r\ndrowned."\r\n\r\n"I know he is," answered Shrowl, without looking up from the\r\nnewspaper-slip. "I\'m reading about it here."\r\n\r\n"The last words my brother said to me when we quarreled about the\r\nplayer-woman," continued Mr. Treverton, speaking as much to himself as\r\nto his servant, "were that I should die without one kind feeling in my\r\nheart toward any living creature."\r\n\r\n"So you will," muttered Shrowl, turning the slip over to see if there\r\nwas any thing worth reading at the back of it.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he thought about me when he was dying?" said Mr.\r\nTreverton, abstractedly, taking up the letter again from the table.\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t waste a thought on you or any body else," remarked Shrowl.\r\n"If he thought at all, he thought about how he could save his life.\r\nWhen he had done thinking about that, he had done living too." With\r\nthis expression of opinion Mr. Shrowl went to the beer-barrel, and\r\ndrew his morning draught.\r\n\r\n"Damn that player-woman!" muttered Mr. Treverton. As he said the words\r\nhis face darkened and his lips closed firmly. He smoothed the letter\r\nout on the table. There seemed to be some doubt in his mind whether he\r\nhad mastered all its contents yet--some idea that there ought to be\r\nmore in it than he had yet discovered. In going over it for the third\r\ntime, he read it to himself aloud and very slowly, as if he was\r\ndetermined to fix every separate word firmly in his memory. This was\r\nthe letter:\r\n\r\n     "SIR,--As the old legal adviser and faithful friend of your\r\n     family, I am desired by Mrs. Frankland, formerly Miss\r\n     Treverton, to acquaint you with the sad news of your\r\n     brother\'s death. This deplorable event occurred on board\r\n     the ship of which he was captain, during a gale of wind in\r\n     which the vessel was lost on a reef of rocks off the island\r\n     of Antigua. I inclose a detailed account of the shipwreck,\r\n     extracted from _The Times_, by which you will see that your\r\n     brother died nobly in the performance of his duty toward\r\n     the officers and men whom he commanded. I also send a slip\r\n     from the local Cornish paper, containing a memoir of the\r\n     deceased gentleman.\r\n\r\n     "Before closing this communication, I must add that no will\r\n     has been found, after the most rigorous search, among the\r\n     papers of the late Captain Treverton. Having disposed, as\r\n     you know, of Porthgenna, the only property of which he was\r\n     possessed at the time of his death was personal property,\r\n     derived from the sale of his estate; and this, in\r\n     consequence of his dying intestate, will go in due course\r\n     of law to his daughter, as his nearest of kin.\r\n\r\n     "I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n     "ALEXANDER NIXON."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newspaper-slip, which had fallen on the table, contained the\r\nparagraph from _The Times_. The slip from the Cornish paper, which had\r\ndropped to the floor, Shrowl poked under his master\'s eyes, in a fit\r\nof temporary civility, as soon as he had done reading it. Mr.\r\nTreverton took not the slightest notice either of the one paragraph or\r\nthe other. He still sat looking at the letter, even after he had read\r\nit for the third time.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you give the strip of print a turn, as well as the sheet of\r\nwriting?" asked Shrowl. "Why don\'t you read about what a great man\r\nyour brother was, and what a good life he led, and what a wonderful\r\nhandsome daughter he\'s left behind him, and what a capital marriage\r\nshe\'s made along with the man that\'s owner of your old family estate?\r\n_She_ don\'t want your money now, at any rate! The ill wind that blowed\r\nher father\'s ship on the rocks has blowed forty thousand pounds of\r\ngood into her lap. Why don\'t you read about it? She and her husband\r\nhave got a better house in Cornwall than you have got here. Ain\'t you\r\nglad of that? They were going to have repaired the place from top to\r\nbottom for your brother to go and live along with \'em in clover when\r\nhe came back from sea. Who will ever repair a place for you? I wonder\r\nwhether your niece would knock the old house about for your sake, now,\r\nif you was to clean yourself up and go and ask her?"\r\n\r\nAt the last question, Shrowl paused in the work of aggravation--not\r\nfor want of more words, but for want of encouragement to utter them.\r\nFor the first time since they had kept house together, he had tried to\r\nprovoke his master and had failed. Mr. Treverton listened, or appeared\r\nto listen, without moving a muscle--without the faintest change to\r\nanger in his face. The only words he said when Shrowl had done were\r\nthese two--\r\n\r\n"Go out!"\r\n\r\nShrowl was not an easy man to move, but he absolutely changed color\r\nwhen he heard himself suddenly ordered to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"Go out!" reiterated Mr. Treverton. "And hold your tongue henceforth\r\nand forever about my brother and my brother\'s daughter. I never _have_\r\nset eyes upon the player-woman\'s child, and I never will. Hold your\r\ntongue--leave me alone--go out!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be even with him for this," thought Shrowl as he slowly withdrew\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he had closed the door, he listened outside of it, and heard Mr.\r\nTreverton push aside his chair, and walk up and down, talking to\r\nhimself. Judging by the confused words that escaped him, Shrowl\r\nconcluded that his thoughts were still running on the "player-woman"\r\nwho had set his brother and himself at variance. He seemed to feel a\r\nbarbarous sense of relief in venting his dissatisfaction with himself,\r\nafter the news of Captain Treverton\'s death, on the memory of the\r\nwoman whom he hated so bitterly, and on the child whom she had left\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the low rumbling tones of his voice ceased altogether.\r\nShrowl peeped through the key-hole, and saw that he was reading the\r\nnewspaper-slips which contained the account of the shipwreck and the\r\nMemoir of his brother. The latter adverted to some of those family\r\nparticulars which the vicar of Long Beckley had mentioned to his\r\nguest; and the writer of the Memoir concluded by expressing a hope\r\nthat the bereavement which Mr. and Mrs. Frankland had suffered would\r\nnot interfere with their project for repairing Porthgenna Tower, after\r\nthey had gone the length already of sending a builder to survey the\r\nplace. Something in the wording of that paragraph seemed to take Mr.\r\nTreverton\'s memory back to his youth-time when the old family house\r\nhad been his home. He whispered a few words to himself which gloomily\r\nreferred to the days that were gone, rose from his chair impatiently,\r\nthrew both the newspaper-slips into the fire, watched them while they\r\nwere burning, and sighed when the black gossamer ashes floated upward\r\non the draught, and were lost in the chimney.\r\n\r\nThe sound of that sigh startled Shrowl as the sound of a pistol-shot\r\nmight have startled another man. His bull-terrier eyes opened wide in\r\nastonishment, and he shook his head ominously as he walked away from\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWILL THEY COME?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper at Porthgenna Tower had just completed the necessary\r\npreparations for the reception of her master and mistress, at the time\r\nmentioned in Mrs. Frankland\'s letter from St. Swithin\'s-on-Sea, when\r\nshe was startled by receiving a note sealed with black wax, and\r\nsurrounded by a thick mourning border. The note briefly communicated\r\nthe news of Captain Treverton\'s death, and informed her that the visit\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Frankland to Porthgenna was deferred for an indefinite\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBy the same post the builder, who was superintending the renovation of\r\nthe west staircase, also received a letter, requesting him to send in\r\nhis account as soon as the repairs on which he was then engaged were\r\ncompleted; and telling him that Mr. Frankland was unable, for the\r\npresent, to give any further attention to the project for making the\r\nnorth rooms habitable. On the receipt of this communication, the\r\nbuilder withdrew himself and his men as soon as the west stairs and\r\nbanisters had been made secure; and Porthgenna Tower was again left to\r\nthe care of the housekeeper and her servant, without master or\r\nmistress, friends or strangers, to thread its solitary passages or\r\nenliven its empty rooms.\r\n\r\nFrom this time eight months passed away, and the housekeeper heard\r\nnothing of her master and mistress, except through the medium of\r\nparagraphs in the local newspaper, which dubiously referred to the\r\nprobability of their occupying the old house, and interesting\r\nthemselves in the affairs of their tenantry, at no very distant\r\nperiod. Occasionally, too, when business took him to the post-town,\r\nthe steward collected reports about his employers among the old\r\nfriends and dependents of the Treverton family.\r\n\r\nFrom these sources of information, the housekeeper was led to conclude\r\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Frankland had returned to Long Beckley, after\r\nreceiving the news of Captain Treverton\'s death, and had lived there\r\nfor some months in strict retirement. When they left that place, they\r\nmoved (if the newspaper report was to be credited) to the neighborhood\r\nof London, and occupied the house of some friends who were traveling\r\non the Continent. Here they must have remained for some time, for the\r\nnew year came and brought no rumors of any change in their place of\r\nabode. January and February passed without any news of them. Early in\r\nMarch the steward had occasion to go to the post-town. When he\r\nreturned to Porthgenna, he came back with a new report relating to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Frankland, which excited the housekeeper\'s interest in an\r\nextraordinary degree. In two different quarters, each highly\r\nrespectable, the steward had heard it facetiously announced that the\r\ndomestic responsibilities of his master and mistress were likely to be\r\nincreased by their having a nurse to engage and a crib to buy at the\r\nend of the spring or the beginning of the summer. In plain English,\r\namong the many babies who might be expected to make their appearance\r\nin the world in the course of the next three months, there was one who\r\nwould inherit the name of Frankland, and who (if the infant luckily\r\nturned out to be a boy) would cause a sensation throughout West\r\nCornwall as heir to the Porthgenna estate.\r\n\r\nIn the next month, the month of April, before the housekeeper and the\r\nsteward had done discussing their last and most important fragment of\r\nnews, the postman made his welcome appearance at Porthgenna Tower, and\r\nbrought another note from Mrs. Frankland. The housekeeper\'s face\r\nbrightened with unaccustomed pleasure and surprise as she read the\r\nfirst line. The letter announced that the long-deferred visit of her\r\nmaster and mistress to the old house would take place early in May,\r\nand that they might be expected to arrive any day from the first to\r\nthe tenth of the month.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which had led the owners of Porthgenna to fix a period, at\r\nlast, for visiting their country seat, were connected with certain\r\nparticulars into which Mrs. Frankland had not thought it advisable to\r\nenter in her letter. The plain facts of the case were, that a little\r\ndiscussion had arisen between the husband and wife in relation to the\r\nnext place of residence which they should select, after the return\r\nfrom the Continent of the friends whose house they were occupying. Mr.\r\nFrankland had very reasonably suggested returning again to Long\r\nBeckley--not only because all their oldest friends lived in the\r\nneighborhood, but also (and circumstances made this an important\r\nconsideration) because the place had the advantage of possessing an\r\nexcellent resident medical man. Unfortunately this latter advantage,\r\nso far from carrying any weight with it in Mrs. Frankland\'s\r\nestimation, actually prejudiced her mind against the project of going\r\nto Long Beckley. She had always, she acknowledged, felt an\r\nunreasonable antipathy to the doctor there. He might be a very\r\nskillful, an extremely polite, and an undeniably respectable man; but\r\nshe never had liked him, and never should, and she was resolved to\r\noppose the plan for living at Long Beckley, because the execution of\r\nit would oblige her to commit herself to his care.\r\n\r\nTwo other places of residence were next suggested; but Mrs. Frankland\r\nhad the same objection to oppose to both--in each case the resident\r\ndoctor would be a stranger to her, and she did not like the notion of\r\nbeing attended by a stranger. Finally, as she had all along\r\nanticipated, the choice of the future abode was left entirely to her\r\nown inclinations; and then, to the amazement of her husband and her\r\nfriends, she immediately decided on going to Porthgenna. She had\r\nformed this strange project, and was now resolved on executing it,\r\npartly because she was more curious than ever to see the place again;\r\npartly because the doctor who had been with her mother in Mrs.\r\nTreverton\'s last illness, and who had attended her through all her own\r\nlittle maladies when she was a child, was still living and practicing\r\nin the Porthgenna neighborhood. Her father and the doctor had been\r\nold cronies, and had met for years at the same chess-board every\r\nSaturday night. They had kept up their friendship, when circumstances\r\nseparated them, by exchanges of Christmas presents every year; and\r\nwhen the sad news of the Captain\'s death had reached Cornwall, the\r\ndoctor had written a letter of sympathy and condolence to Rosamond,\r\nspeaking in such terms of his former friend and patron as she could\r\nnever forget. He must be a nice, fatherly old man now, the man of all\r\nothers who was fittest, on every account, to attend her. In short,\r\nMrs. Frankland was just as strongly prejudiced in favor of employing\r\nthe Porthgenna doctor as she was prejudiced against employing the Long\r\nBeckley doctor; and she ended, as all young married women with\r\naffectionate husbands may, and do end, whenever they please--by\r\ncarrying her own point, and having her own way.\r\n\r\nOn the first of May the west rooms were all ready for the reception of\r\nthe master and mistress of the house. The beds were aired, the carpets\r\ncleaned, the sofas and chairs uncovered. The housekeeper put on her\r\nsatin gown and her garnet brooch; the maid followed suit, at a\r\nrespectful distance, in brown merino and a pink ribbon; and the\r\nsteward, determining not to be outdone by the women, arrayed himself\r\nin a black brocaded waistcoat, which almost rivaled the gloom and\r\ngrandeur of the housekeeper\'s satin gown. The day wore on, evening\r\nclosed in, bed-time came, and there were no signs yet of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland.\r\n\r\nBut the first was an early day on which to expect them. The steward\r\nthought so, and the housekeeper added that it would be foolish to feel\r\ndisappointed, even if they did not arrive until the fifth. The fifth\r\ncame, and still nothing happened. The sixth, seventh, eighth, and\r\nninth followed, and no sound of the expected carriage-wheels came near\r\nthe lonely house.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth, and last day, the housekeeper, the steward, and the\r\nmaid, all three rose earlier than usual; all three opened and shut\r\ndoors, and went up and down stairs oftener than was needful; all three\r\nlooked out perpetually toward the moor and the high road, and thought\r\nthe view flatter and duller and emptier than ever it had appeared to\r\nthem before. The day waned, the sunset came; darkness changed the\r\nperpetual looking-out of the housekeeper, the steward, and the maid\r\ninto perpetual listening; ten o\'clock struck, and still there was\r\nnothing to be heard when they went to the open window but the\r\nwearisome beating of the surf on the sandy shore.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper began to calculate the time that would be consumed on\r\nthe railway journey from London to Exeter, and on the posting journey\r\nafterward through Cornwall to Porthgenna. When had Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland left Exeter?--that was the first question. And what delays\r\nmight they have encountered afterward in getting horses?--that was the\r\nsecond. The housekeeper and the steward differed in debating these\r\npoints; but both agreed that it was necessary to sit up until\r\nmidnight, on the chance of the master and mistress arriving late. The\r\nmaid, hearing her sentence of banishment from bed for the next two\r\nhours pronounced by the superior authorities, yawned and sighed\r\nmournfully--was reproved by the steward--and was furnished by the\r\nhousekeeper with a book of hymns to read to keep up her spirits.\r\n\r\nTwelve o\'clock struck, and still the monotonous beating of the surf,\r\nvaried occasionally by those loud, mysterious, cracking noises which\r\nmake themselves heard at night in an old house, were the only audible\r\nsounds. The steward was dozing; the maid was fast asleep under the\r\nsoothing influence of the hymns; the housekeeper was wide awake, with\r\nher eyes fixed on the window, and her head shaking forebodingly from\r\ntime to time. At the last stroke of the clock she left her chair,\r\nlistened attentively, and still hearing nothing, shook the maid\r\nirritably by the shoulder, and stamped on the floor to arouse the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n"We may go to bed," she said. "They are not coming. This is the second\r\ntime they have disappointed us. The first time the Captain\'s death\r\nstood in the way. What stops them now? Another death? I shouldn\'t\r\nwonder if it was."\r\n\r\n"Now I think of it, no more should I," said the steward, ominously\r\nknitting his brows.\r\n\r\n"Another death!" repeated the housekeeper, superstitiously. "If it\r\n_is_ another death, I should take it, in their place, as a warning to\r\nkeep away from the house."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMRS. JAZEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, instead of hazarding the guess that a second death stood in the\r\nway of Mr. and Mrs. Frankland\'s arrival at Porthgenna, the housekeeper\r\nhad, by way of variety, surmised this time that a birth was the\r\nobstacle which delayed them, she might have established her character\r\nas a wise woman, by hitting at random on the actual truth. Her master\r\nand mistress had started from London on the ninth of May, and had got\r\nthrough the greater part of their railway journey, when they were\r\nsuddenly obliged to stop, on Mrs. Frankland\'s account, at the station\r\nof a small town in Somersetshire. The little visitor, who was destined\r\nto increase the domestic responsibilities of the young married couple,\r\nhad chosen to enter on the scene, in the character of a robust\r\nboy-baby, a month earlier than he had been expected, and had modestly\r\npreferred to make his first appearance in a small Somersetshire inn,\r\nrather than wait to be ceremoniously welcomed to life in the great\r\nhouse of Porthgenna, which he was one day to inherit.\r\n\r\nVery few events had ever produced a greater sensation in the town of\r\nWest Winston than the one small event of the unexpected stoppage of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Frankland\'s journey at that place. Never since the last\r\nelection had the landlord and landlady of the Tiger\'s Head Hotel\r\nbustled about their house in such a fever of excitement as possessed\r\nthem when Mr. Frankland\'s servant and Mrs. Frankland\'s maid drew up at\r\nthe door in a fly from the station, to announce that their master and\r\nmistress were behind, and that the largest and quietest rooms in the\r\nhotel were wanted immediately, under the most unexpected\r\ncircumstances. Never since he had triumphantly passed his examination\r\nhad young Mr. Orridge, the new doctor, who had started in life by\r\npurchasing the West Winston practice, felt such a thrill of\r\npleasurable agitation pervade him from top to toe as when he heard\r\nthat the wife of a blind gentleman of great fortune had been taken\r\nill on the railway journey from London to Devonshire, and required\r\nall that his skill and attention could do for her without a moment\'s\r\ndelay. Never since the last archery meeting and fancy fair had the\r\nladies of the town been favored with such an all-absorbing subject for\r\nconversation as was now afforded to them by Mrs. Frankland\'s mishap.\r\nFabulous accounts of the wife\'s beauty and the husband\'s fortune\r\npoured from the original source of the Tiger\'s Head, and trickled\r\nthrough the highways and byways of the little town. There were a dozen\r\ndifferent reports, one more elaborately false than the other, about\r\nMr. Frankland\'s blindness, and the cause of it; about the lamentable\r\ncondition in which his wife had arrived at the hotel; and about the\r\npainful sense of responsibility which had unnerved the inexperienced\r\nMr. Orridge from the first moment when he set eyes on his patient. It\r\nwas not till eight o\'clock in the evening that the public mind was\r\nrelieved at last from all suspense by an announcement that the child\r\nwas born, and screaming lustily; that the mother was wonderfully well,\r\nconsidering all things; and that Mr. Orridge had covered himself with\r\ndistinction by the skill, tenderness, and attention with which he had\r\nperformed his duties.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, and the next, and for a week after that, the accounts\r\nwere still favorable. But on the tenth day a catastrophe was reported.\r\nThe nurse who was in attendance on Mrs. Frankland had been suddenly\r\ntaken ill, and was rendered quite incapable of performing any further\r\nservice for at least a week to come, and perhaps for a much longer\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn a large town this misfortune might have been readily remedied, but\r\nin a place like West Winston it was not so easy to supply the loss of\r\nan experienced nurse at a few hours\' notice. When Mr. Orridge was\r\nconsulted in the new emergency, he candidly acknowledged that he\r\nrequired a little time for consideration before he could undertake to\r\nfind another professed nurse of sufficient character and experience to\r\nwait on a lady like Mrs. Frankland. Mr. Frankland suggested\r\ntelegraphing to a medical friend in London for a nurse, but the doctor\r\nwas unwilling for many reasons to adopt that plan, except as a last\r\nresource. It would take some time to find the right person, and to\r\nsend her to West Winston and, moreover, he would infinitely prefer\r\nemploying a woman with whose character and capacity he was himself\r\nacquainted. He therefore proposed that Mrs. Frankland should be\r\ntrusted for a few hours to the care of her maid, under supervision of\r\nthe landlady of the Tiger\'s Head, while he made inquiries in the\r\nneighborhood. If the inquiries produced no satisfactory result, he\r\nshould be ready, when he called in the evening, to adopt Mr.\r\nFrankland\'s idea of telegraphing to London for a nurse.\r\n\r\nOn proceeding to make the investigation that he had proposed, Mr.\r\nOrridge, although he spared no trouble, met with no success. He found\r\nplenty of volunteers for the office of nurse, but they were all\r\nloud-voiced, clumsy-handed, heavy-footed countrywomen, kind and\r\nwilling enough, but sadly awkward, blundering attendants to place at\r\nthe bedside of such a lady as Mrs. Frankland. The morning hours passed\r\naway, and the afternoon came, and still Mr. Orridge had found no\r\nsubstitute for the invalided nurse whom he could venture to engage.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock he had half an hour\'s drive before him to a\r\ncountry-house where he had a child-patient to see. "Perhaps I may\r\nremember somebody who may do, on the way out or on the way back\r\nagain," thought Mr. Orridge, as he got into his gig. "I have some\r\nhours at my disposal still, before the time comes for my evening visit\r\nat the inn."\r\n\r\nPuzzling his brains, with the best intention in the world, all along\r\nthe road to the country-house, Mr. Orridge reached his destination\r\nwithout having arrived at any other conclusion than that he might just\r\nas well state his difficulty to Mrs. Norbury, the lady whose child he\r\nwas about to prescribe for. He had called on her when he bought the\r\nWest Winston practice, and had found her one of those frank,\r\ngood-humored, middle-aged women who are generally designated by the\r\nepithet "motherly." Her husband was a country squire, famous for his\r\nold politics, his old stories, and his old wine. He had seconded his\r\nwife\'s hearty reception of the new doctor, with all the usual jokes\r\nabout never giving him any employment, and never letting any bottles\r\ninto the house except the bottles that went down into the cellar. Mr.\r\nOrridge had been amused by the husband and pleased with the wife; and\r\nhe thought it might be at least worth while, before he gave up all\r\nhope of finding a fit nurse, to ask Mrs. Norbury, as an old resident\r\nin the West Winston neighborhood, for a word of advice.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after seeing the child, and pronouncing that there were\r\nno symptoms about the little patient which need cause the slightest\r\nalarm to any body, Mr. Orridge paved the way for a statement of the\r\ndifficulty that beset him by asking Mrs. Norbury if she had heard of\r\nthe "interesting event" that had happened at the Tiger\'s Head.\r\n\r\n"You mean," answered Mrs. Norbury, who was a downright woman, and a\r\nresolute speaker of the plainest possible English--"You mean, have I\r\nheard about that poor unfortunate lady who was taken ill on her\r\njourney, and who had a child born at the inn? We have heard so much,\r\nand no more--living as we do (thank Heaven!) out of reach of the West\r\nWinston gossip. How is the lady? Who is she? Is the child well? Is she\r\ntolerably comfortable? poor thing! Can I send her any thing, or do any\r\nthing for her?"\r\n\r\n"You would do a great thing for her, and render a great assistance to\r\nme," said Mr. Orridge, "if you could tell me of any respectable woman\r\nin this neighborhood who would be a proper nurse for her."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that the poor creature has not got a nurse!"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Norbury.\r\n\r\n"She has had the best nurse in West Winston," replied Mr. Orridge.\r\n"But, most unfortunately, the woman was taken ill this morning, and\r\nwas obliged to go home. I am now at my wit\'s end for somebody to\r\nsupply her place. Mrs. Frankland has been used to the luxury of being\r\nwell waited on; and where I am to find an attendant, who is likely to\r\nsatisfy her, is more than I can tell."\r\n\r\n"Frankland, did you say her name was?" inquired Mrs. Norbury.\r\n\r\n"Yes. She is, I understand, a daughter of that Captain Treverton who\r\nwas lost with his ship a year ago in the West Indies. Perhaps you may\r\nremember the account of the disaster in the newspapers?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do! and I remember the Captain too. I was acquainted with\r\nhim when he was a young man, at Portsmouth. His daughter and I ought\r\nnot to be strangers, especially under such circumstances as the poor\r\nthing is placed in now. I will call at the inn, Mr. Orridge, as soon\r\nas you will allow me to introduce myself to her. But, in the mean\r\ntime, what is to be done in this difficulty about the nurse? Who is\r\nwith Mrs. Frankland now?"\r\n\r\n"Her maid; but she is a very young woman, and doesn\'t understand\r\nnursing duties. The landlady of the inn is ready to help when she can;\r\nbut then she has constant demands on her time and attention. I suppose\r\nwe shall have to telegraph to London and get somebody sent here by\r\nrailway."\r\n\r\n"And that will take time, of course. And the new nurse may turn out to\r\nbe a drunkard or a thief, or both--when you have got her here," said\r\nthe outspoken Mrs. Norbury. "Dear, dear me! can\'t we do something\r\nbetter than that? I am ready, I am sure, to take any trouble, or make\r\nany sacrifice, if I can be of use to Mrs. Frankland. Do you know, Mr.\r\nOrridge, I think it would be a good plan if we consulted my\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Jazeph. She is an odd woman, with an odd name, you\r\nwill say; but she has lived with me in this house more than five\r\nyears, and she may know of somebody in our neighborhood who might suit\r\nyou, though I don\'t." With those words, Mrs. Norbury rang the bell,\r\nand ordered the servant who answered it to tell Mrs. Jazeph that she\r\nwas wanted up stairs immediately.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a minute or so a soft knock was heard at the door,\r\nand the housekeeper entered the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge looked at her, the moment she appeared, with an interest\r\nand curiosity for which he was hardly able to account. He judged her,\r\nat a rough guess, to be a woman of about fifty years of age. At the\r\nfirst glance, his medical eye detected that some of the intricate\r\nmachinery of the nervous system had gone wrong with Mrs. Jazeph. He\r\nnoted the painful working of the muscles of her face, and the hectic\r\nflush that flew into her cheeks when she entered the room and found a\r\nvisitor there. He observed a strangely scared look in her eyes, and\r\nremarked that it did not leave them when the rest of her face became\r\ngradually composed. "That woman has had some dreadful fright, some\r\ngreat grief, or some wasting complaint," he thought to himself. "I\r\nwonder which it is?"\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Orridge, the medical gentleman who has lately settled at\r\nWest Winston," said Mrs. Norbury, addressing the housekeeper. "He is\r\nin attendance on a lady who was obliged to stop, on her journey\r\nwestward, at our station, and who is now staying at the Tiger\'s Head.\r\nYou have heard something about it, have you not, Mrs. Jazeph?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph, standing just inside the door, looked respectfully toward\r\nthe doctor, and answered in the affirmative. Although she only said\r\nthe two common words, "Yes, ma\'am," in a quiet, uninterested way, Mr.\r\nOrridge was struck by the sweetness and tenderness of her voice. If he\r\nhad not been looking at her, he would have supposed it to be the voice\r\nof a young woman. His eyes remained fixed on her after she had spoken,\r\nthough he felt that they ought to have been looking toward her\r\nmistress. He, the most unobservant of men in such things, found\r\nhimself noticing her dress, so that he remembered, long afterward, the\r\nform of the spotless muslin cap that primly covered her smooth gray\r\nhair, and the quiet brown color of the silk dress that fitted so\r\nneatly and hung around her in such spare and disciplined folds. The\r\nlittle confusion which she evidently felt at finding herself the\r\nobject of the doctor\'s attention did not betray her into the slightest\r\nawkwardness of gesture or manner. If there can be such a thing,\r\nphysically speaking, as the grace of restraint, that was the grace\r\nwhich seemed to govern Mrs. Jazeph\'s slightest movements; which led\r\nher feet smoothly over the carpet, as she advanced when her mistress\r\nnext spoke to her; which governed the action of her wan right hand as\r\nit rested lightly on a table by her side, while she stopped to hear\r\nthe next question that was addressed to her.\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Mrs. Norbury, "this poor lady was just getting on\r\ncomfortably, when the nurse who was looking after her fell ill this\r\nmorning; and there she is now, in a strange place, with a first child,\r\nand no proper attendance--no woman of age and experience to help her\r\nas she ought to be helped. We want somebody fit to wait on a delicate\r\nwoman who has seen nothing of the rough side of humanity. Mr. Orridge\r\ncan find nobody at a day\'s notice, and I can tell him of nobody. Can\r\nyou help us, Mrs. Jazeph? Are there any women down in the village, or\r\namong Mr. Norbury\'s tenants, who understand nursing, and have some\r\ntact and tenderness to recommend them into the bargain?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph reflected for a little while, and then said, very\r\nrespectfully, but very briefly also, and still without any appearance\r\nof interest in her manner, that she knew of no one whom she could\r\nrecommend.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make too sure of that till you have thought a little longer,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Norbury. "I have a particular interest in serving this lady,\r\nfor Mr. Orridge told me just before you came in that she is the\r\ndaughter of Captain Treverton, whose shipwreck--"\r\n\r\nThe instant those words were spoken, Mrs. Jazeph turned round with a\r\nstart, and looked at the doctor. Apparently forgetting that her right\r\nhand was on the table, she moved it so suddenly that it struck against\r\na bronze statuette of a dog placed on some writing materials. The\r\nstatuette fell to the ground, and Mrs. Jazeph stooped to pick it up\r\nwith a cry of alarm which seemed strangely exaggerated by comparison\r\nwith the trifling nature of the accident.\r\n\r\n"Bless the woman! what is she frightened about?" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nNorbury. "The dog is not hurt--put it back again! This is the first\r\ntime, Mrs. Jazeph, that I ever knew you do an awkward thing. You may\r\ntake that as a compliment, I think. Well, as I was saying, this lady\r\nis the daughter of Captain Treverton, whose dreadful shipwreck we all\r\nread about in the papers. I knew her father in my early days, and on\r\nthat account I am doubly anxious to be of service to her now. Do think\r\nagain. Is there nobody within reach who can be trusted to nurse her?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, still watching Mrs. Jazeph with that secret medical\r\ninterest of his in her case, had seen her turn so deadly pale when she\r\nstarted and looked toward him that he would not have been surprised if\r\nshe had fainted on the spot. He now observed that she changed color\r\nagain when her mistress left off speaking. The hectic red tinged her\r\ncheeks once more with two bright spots. Her timid eyes wandered\r\nuneasily about the room; and her fingers, as she clasped her hands\r\ntogether, interlaced themselves mechanically. "That would be an\r\ninteresting case to treat," thought the doctor, following every\r\nnervous movement of the housekeeper\'s hands with watchful eyes.\r\n\r\n"Do think again," repeated Mrs. Norbury. "I am so anxious to help this\r\npoor lady through her difficulty, if I can."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry," said Mrs. Jazeph, in faint, trembling tones, but\r\nstill always with the same sweetness in her voice--"very sorry that I\r\ncan think of no one who is fit; but--"\r\n\r\nShe stopped. No shy child on its first introduction to the society of\r\nstrangers could have looked more disconcerted than she looked now. Her\r\neyes were on the ground; her color was deepening; the fingers of her\r\nclasped hands were working together faster and faster every moment.\r\n\r\n"But what?" asked Mrs. Norbury.\r\n\r\n"I was about to say, ma\'am," answered Mrs. Jazeph, speaking with the\r\ngreatest difficulty and uneasiness, and never raising her eyes to her\r\nmistress\'s face, "that, rather than this lady should want for a nurse,\r\nI would--considering the interest, ma\'am, which you take in her--I\r\nwould, if you thought you could spare me--"\r\n\r\n"What, nurse her yourself!" exclaimed Mrs. Norbury. "Upon my word,\r\nalthough you have got to it in rather a roundabout way, you have come\r\nto the point at last, in a manner which does infinite credit to your\r\nkindness of heart and your readiness to make yourself useful. As to\r\nsparing you, of course I am not so selfish, under the circumstances,\r\nas to think twice of the inconvenience of losing my housekeeper. But\r\nthe question is, are you competent as well as willing? Have you ever\r\nhad any practice in nursing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," answered Mrs. Jazeph, still without raising her eyes\r\nfrom the ground. "Shortly after my marriage" (the flush disappeared,\r\nand her face turned pale again as she said those words), "I had some\r\npractice in nursing, and continued it at intervals until the time of\r\nmy husband\'s death. I only presume to offer myself, Sir," she went on,\r\nturning toward the doctor, and becoming more earnest and\r\nself-possessed in her manner as she did so--"I only presume to offer\r\nmyself, with my mistress\'s permission, as a substitute for a nurse\r\nuntil some better qualified person can be found."\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Mr. Orridge?" asked Mrs. Norbury.\r\n\r\nIt had been the doctor\'s turn to start when he first heard Mrs. Jazeph\r\npropose herself for the office of nurse. He hesitated before he\r\nanswered Mrs. Norbury\'s question, then said:\r\n\r\n"I can have but one doubt about the propriety of thankfully accepting\r\nMrs. Jazeph\'s offer."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph\'s timid eyes looked anxiously and perplexedly at him as\r\nhe spoke. Mrs. Norbury, in her downright, abrupt way, asked\r\nimmediately what the doubt was.\r\n\r\n"I feel some uncertainty," replied Mr. Orridge, "as to whether Mrs.\r\nJazeph--she will pardon me, as a medical man, for mentioning it--as to\r\nwhether Mrs. Jazeph is strong enough, and has her nerves sufficiently\r\nunder control to perform the duties which she is so kindly ready to\r\nundertake."\r\n\r\nIn spite of the politeness of the explanation, Mrs. Jazeph was\r\nevidently disconcerted and distressed by it. A certain quiet,\r\nuncomplaining sadness, which it was very touching to see, overspread\r\nher face as she turned away, without another word, and walked slowly\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go yet!" cried Mrs. Norbury, kindly, "or, at least, if you do\r\ngo, come back again in five minutes. I am quite certain we shall have\r\nsomething more to say to you then."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph\'s eyes expressed her thanks in one grateful glance. They\r\nlooked so much brighter than usual while they rested on her mistress\'s\r\nface, that Mrs. Norbury half doubted whether the tears were not just\r\nrising in them at that moment. Before she could look again, Mrs.\r\nJazeph had courtesied to the doctor, and had noiselessly left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Now we are alone, Mr. Orridge," said Mrs. Norbury, "I may tell you,\r\nwith all submission to your medical judgment, that you are a little\r\nexaggerating Mrs. Jazeph\'s nervous infirmities. She looks poorly\r\nenough, I own; but, after five years\' experience of her, I can tell\r\nyou that she is stronger than she looks, and I honestly think you will\r\nbe doing good service to Mrs. Frankland if you try our volunteer\r\nnurse, at least for a day or two. She is the gentlest, tenderest\r\ncreature I ever met with, and conscientious to a fault in the\r\nperformance of any duty that she undertakes. Don\'t be under any\r\ndelicacy about taking her away. I gave a dinner-party last week, and\r\nshall not give another for some time to come. I never could have\r\nspared my housekeeper more easily than I can spare her now."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I may offer Mrs. Frankland\'s thanks to you as well as my\r\nown," said Mr. Orridge. "After what you have said, it would be\r\nungracious and ungrateful in me not to follow your advice. But will\r\nyou excuse me if I ask one question? Did you ever hear that Mrs.\r\nJazeph was subject to fits of any kind?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Not even to hysterical affections, now and then?"\r\n\r\n"Never, since she has been in this house."\r\n\r\n"You surprise me, there is something in her look and manner--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; every body remarks that at first; but it simply means that\r\nshe is in delicate health, and that she has not led a very happy life\r\n(as I suspect) in her younger days. The lady from whom I had her (with\r\nan excellent character) told me that she had married unhappily, when\r\nshe was in a sadly poor, unprotected state. She never says any thing\r\nabout her married troubles herself; but I believe her husband ill-used\r\nher. However, it does not seem to me that this is our business. I can\r\nonly tell you again that she has been an excellent servant here for\r\nthe last five years, and that, in your place, poorly as she may look,\r\nI should consider her as the best nurse that Mrs. Frankland could\r\npossibly wish for, under the circumstances. There is no need for me to\r\nsay any more. Take Mrs. Jazeph, or telegraph to London for a\r\nstranger--the decision of course rests with you."\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge thought he detected a slight tone of irritability in Mrs.\r\nNorbury\'s last sentence. He was a prudent man; and he suppressed any\r\ndoubts he might still feel in reference to Mrs. Jazeph\'s physical\r\ncapacities for nursing, rather than risk offending the most important\r\nlady in the neighborhood at the outset of his practice in West Winston\r\nas a medical man.\r\n\r\n"I can not hesitate a moment after what you have been good enough to\r\ntell me," he said. "Pray believe that I gratefully accept your\r\nkindness and your housekeeper\'s offer."\r\n\r\nMrs. Norbury rang the bell. It was answered on the instant by the\r\nhousekeeper herself.\r\n\r\nThe doctor wondered whether she had been listening outside the door,\r\nand thought it rather strange, if she had, that she should be so\r\nanxious to learn his decision.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Orridge accepts your offer with thanks," said Mrs. Norbury,\r\nbeckoning to Mrs. Jazeph to advance into the room. "I have persuaded\r\nhim that you are not quite so weak and ill as you look."\r\n\r\nA gleam of joyful surprise broke over the housekeeper\'s face. It\r\nlooked suddenly younger by years and years, as she smiled and\r\nexpressed her grateful sense of the trust that was about to be\r\nreposed in her. For the first time, also, since the doctor had seen\r\nher, she ventured on speaking before she was spoken to.\r\n\r\n"When will my attendance be required, Sir?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"As soon as possible," replied Mr. Orridge. How quickly and brightly\r\nher dim eyes seemed to clear as she heard that answer! How much more\r\nhasty than her usual movements was the movement with which she now\r\nturned round and looked appealingly at her mistress!\r\n\r\n"Go whenever Mr. Orridge wants you," said Mrs. Norbury. "I know your\r\naccounts are always in order, and your keys always in their proper\r\nplaces. You never make confusion and you never leave confusion. Go, by\r\nall means, as soon as the doctor wants you."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have some preparations to make?" said Mr. Orridge.\r\n\r\n"None, Sir, that need delay me more than half an hour," answered Mrs.\r\nJazeph.\r\n\r\n"This evening will be early enough," said the doctor, taking his hat,\r\nand bowing to Mrs. Norbury. "Come to the Tiger\'s Head, and ask for me.\r\nI shall be there between seven and eight. Many thanks again, Mrs.\r\nNorbury."\r\n\r\n"My best wishes and compliments to your patient, doctor."\r\n\r\n"At the Tiger\'s Head, between seven and eight this evening,"\r\nreiterated Mr. Orridge, as the housekeeper opened the door for him.\r\n\r\n"Between seven and eight, Sir," repeated the soft, sweet voice,\r\nsounding younger than ever, now that there was an under-note of\r\npleasure running through its tones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW NURSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the clock struck seven, Mr. Orridge put on his hat to go to the\r\nTiger\'s Head. He had just opened his own door, when he was met on the\r\nstep by a messenger, who summoned him immediately to a case of sudden\r\nillness in the poor quarter of the town. The inquiries he made\r\nsatisfied him that the appeal was really of an urgent nature, and that\r\nthere was no help for it but to delay his attendance for a little\r\nwhile at the inn. On reaching the bedside of the patient, he\r\ndiscovered symptoms in the case which rendered an immediate operation\r\nnecessary. The performance of this professional duty occupied some\r\ntime. It was a quarter to eight before he left his house, for the\r\nsecond time, on his way to the Tiger\'s Head.\r\n\r\nOn entering the inn door, he was informed that the new nurse had\r\narrived as early as seven o\'clock, and had been waiting for him in a\r\nroom by herself ever since. Having received no orders from Mr.\r\nOrridge, the landlady had thought it safest not to introduce the\r\nstranger to Mrs. Frankland before the doctor came.\r\n\r\n"Did she ask to go up into Mrs. Frankland\'s room?" inquired Mr.\r\nOrridge.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir," replied the landlady. "And I thought she seemed rather put\r\nout when I said that I must beg her to wait till you got here. Will\r\nyou step this way, and see her at once, Sir? She is in my parlor."\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge followed the landlady into a little room at the back of\r\nthe house, and found Mrs. Jazeph sitting alone in the corner farthest\r\nfrom the window. He was rather surprised to see that she drew her veil\r\ndown the moment the door was opened.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you should have been kept waiting," he said; "but I was\r\ncalled away to a patient. Besides, I told you between seven and eight,\r\nif you remember; and it is not eight o\'clock yet."\r\n\r\n"I was very anxious to be in good time, Sir," said Mrs. Jazeph.\r\n\r\nThere was an accent of restraint in the quiet tones in which she spoke\r\nwhich struck Mr. Orridge\'s ear, and a little perplexed him. She was,\r\napparently, not only afraid that her face might betray something, but\r\napprehensive also that her voice might tell him more than her words\r\nexpressed. What feeling was she anxious to conceal? Was it irritation\r\nat having been kept waiting so long by herself in the landlady\'s room?\r\n\r\n"If you will follow me," said Mr. Orridge, "I will take you to Mrs.\r\nFrankland immediately."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph rose slowly, and, when she was on her feet, rested her\r\nhand for an instant on a table near her. That action, momentary as it\r\nwas, helped to confirm the doctor in his conviction of her physical\r\nunfitness for the position which she had volunteered to occupy.\r\n\r\n"You seem tired," he said, as he led the way out of the door. "Surely,\r\nyou did not walk all the way here?"\r\n\r\n"No, Sir. My mistress was so kind as to let one of the servants drive\r\nme in the pony-chaise." There was the same restraint in her voice as\r\nshe made that answer; and still she never attempted to lift her veil.\r\nWhile ascending the inn stairs Mr. Orridge mentally resolved to watch\r\nher first proceedings in Mrs. Frankland\'s room closely, and to send,\r\nafter all, for the London nurse, unless Mrs. Jazeph showed remarkable\r\naptitude in the performance of her new duties.\r\n\r\nThe room which Mrs. Frankland occupied was situated at the back of the\r\nhouse, having been chosen in that position with the object of removing\r\nher as much as possible from the bustle and noise about the inn door.\r\nIt was lighted by one window overlooking a few cottages, beyond which\r\nspread the rich grazing grounds of West Somersetshire, bounded by a\r\nlong monotonous line of thickly wooded hills. The bed was of the\r\nold-fashioned kind, with the customary four posts and the inevitable\r\ndamask curtains. It projected from the wall into the middle of the\r\nroom, in such a situation as to keep the door on the right hand of the\r\nperson occupying it, the window on the left, and the fire-place\r\nopposite the foot of the bed. On the side of the bed nearest the\r\nwindow the curtains were open, while at the foot, and on the side near\r\nthe door, they were closely drawn. By this arrangement the interior of\r\nthe bed was necessarily concealed from the view of any person on first\r\nentering the room.\r\n\r\n"How do you find yourself to-night, Mrs. Frankland?" asked Mr.\r\nOrridge, reaching out his hand to undraw the curtains. "Do you think\r\nyou will be any the worse for a little freer circulation of air?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, doctor, I shall be all the better," was the answer.\r\n"But I am afraid--in case you have ever been disposed to consider me a\r\nsensible woman--that my character will suffer a little in your\r\nestimation when you see how I have been occupying myself for the last\r\nhour."\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge smiled as he undrew the curtains, and laughed outright\r\nwhen he looked at the mother and child.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frankland had been amusing herself, and gratifying her taste for\r\nbright colors, by dressing out her baby with blue ribbons as he lay\r\nasleep. He had a necklace, shoulder-knots, and bracelets, all of blue\r\nribbon; and, to complete the quaint finery of his costume, his\r\nmother\'s smart little lace cap had been hitched comically on one side\r\nof his head. Rosamond herself, as if determined to vie with the baby\r\nin gayety of dress, wore a light pink jacket, ornamented down the\r\nbosom and over the sleeves with bows of white satin ribbon. Laburnum\r\nblossoms, gathered that morning, lay scattered about over the white\r\ncounterpane, intermixed with some flowers of the lily of the valley,\r\ntied up into two nosegays with strips of cherry-colored ribbon. Over\r\nthis varied assemblage of colors, over the baby\'s smoothly rounded\r\ncheeks and arms, over his mother\'s happy, youthful face, the tender\r\nlight of the May evening poured tranquil and warm. Thoroughly\r\nappreciating the charm of the picture which he had disclosed on\r\nundrawing the curtains, the doctor stood looking at it for a few\r\nmoments, quite forgetful of the errand that had brought him into the\r\nroom. He was only recalled to a remembrance of the new nurse by a\r\nchance question which Mrs. Frankland addressed to him.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it, doctor," said Rosamond, with a look of apology. "I\r\nreally can\'t help treating my baby, now I am a grown woman, just as I\r\nused to treat my doll when I was a little girl. Did any body come into\r\nthe room with you? Lenny, are you there? Have you done dinner,\r\ndarling, and did you drink my health when you were left at dessert all\r\nby yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Frankland is still at dinner," said the doctor. "But I certainly\r\nbrought some one into the room with me. Where, in the name of wonder,\r\nhas she gone to?--Mrs. Jazeph!"\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper had slipped round to the part of the room between the\r\nfoot of the bed and the fire-place, where she was hidden by the\r\ncurtains that still remained drawn. When Mr. Orridge called to her,\r\ninstead of joining him where he stood, opposite the window, she\r\nappeared at the other side of the bed, where the window was behind\r\nher. Her shadow stole darkly over the bright picture which the doctor\r\nhad been admiring. It stretched obliquely across the counterpane, and\r\nits dusky edges touched the figures of the mother and child.\r\n\r\n"Gracious goodness! who are you?" exclaimed Rosamond. "A woman or a\r\nghost?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph\'s veil was up at last. Although her face was necessarily\r\nin shadow in the position which she had chosen to occupy, the doctor\r\nsaw a change pass over it when Mrs. Frankland spoke. The lips dropped\r\nand quivered a little; the marks of care and age about the mouth\r\ndeepened; and the eyebrows contracted suddenly. The eyes Mr. Orridge\r\ncould not see; they were cast down on the counterpane at the first\r\nword that Rosamond uttered. Judging by the light of his medical\r\nexperience, the doctor concluded that she was suffering pain, and\r\ntrying to suppress any outward manifestation of it. "An affection of\r\nthe heart, most likely," he thought to himself. "She has concealed it\r\nfrom her mistress, but she can\'t hide it from me."\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" repeated Rosamond. "And what in the world do you stand\r\nthere for--between us and the sunlight?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph neither answered nor raised her eyes. She only moved back\r\ntimidly to the farthest corner of the window.\r\n\r\n"Did you not get a message from me this afternoon?" asked the doctor,\r\nappealing to Mrs. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I did," replied Rosamond. "A very kind, flattering message\r\nabout a new nurse."\r\n\r\n"There she is," said Mr. Orridge, pointing across the bed to Mrs.\r\nJazeph.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so!" exclaimed Rosamond. "But of course it must be. Who\r\nelse could have come in with you? I ought to have known that. Pray come\r\nhere--(what is her name, doctor? Joseph, did you say?--No?--Jazeph?)\r\n--pray come nearer, Mrs. Jazeph, and let me apologize for speaking so\r\nabruptly to you. I am more obliged than I can say for your kindness in\r\ncoming here, and for your mistress\'s good-nature in resigning you to\r\nme. I hope I shall not give you much trouble, and I am sure you will\r\nfind the baby easy to manage. He is a perfect angel, and sleeps like a\r\ndormouse. Dear me! now I look at you a little closer, I am afraid you\r\nare in very delicate health yourself. Doctor, if Mrs. Jazeph would not\r\nbe offended with me, I should almost feel inclined to say that she\r\nlooks in want of nursing herself."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph bent down over the laburnum blossoms on the bed, and\r\nbegan hurriedly and confusedly to gather them together.\r\n\r\n"I thought as you do, Mrs. Frankland," said Mr. Orridge. "But I have\r\nbeen assured that Mrs. Jazeph\'s looks belie her, and that her\r\ncapabilities as a nurse quite equal her zeal."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to make all that laburnum into a nosegay?" asked Mrs.\r\nFrankland, noticing how the new nurse was occupying herself. "How\r\nthoughtful of you! and how magnificent it will be! I am afraid you\r\nwill find the room very untidy. I will ring for my maid to set it to\r\nrights."\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me to put it in order, ma\'am, I shall be very glad\r\nto begin being of use to you in that way," said Mrs. Jazeph. When she\r\nmade the offer she looked up; and her eyes and Mrs. Frankland\'s met.\r\nRosamond instantly drew back on the pillow, and her color altered a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"How strangely you look at me!" she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph started at the words, as if something had struck her, and\r\nmoved away suddenly to the window.\r\n\r\n"You are not offended with me, I hope?" said Rosamond, noticing the\r\naction. "I have a sad habit of saying any thing that comes uppermost.\r\nAnd I really thought you looked just now as if you saw something about\r\nme that frightened or grieved you. Pray put the room in order, if you\r\nare kindly willing to undertake the trouble. And never mind what I\r\nsay; you will soon get used to my ways--and we shall be as comfortable\r\nand friendly--"\r\n\r\nJust as Mrs. Frankland said the words "comfortable and friendly," the\r\nnew nurse left the window, and went back to the part of the room where\r\nshe was hidden from view, between the fire-place and the closed\r\ncurtains at the foot of the bed. Rosamond looked round to express her\r\nsurprise to the doctor, but he turned away at the same moment so as to\r\noccupy a position which might enable him to observe what Mrs. Jazeph\r\nwas doing on the other side of the bed-curtains.\r\n\r\nWhen he first caught sight of her, her hands were both raised to her\r\nface. Before he could decide whether he had surprised her in the act\r\nof clasping them over her eyes or not, they changed their position,\r\nand were occupied in removing her bonnet. After she had placed this\r\npart of her wearing apparel, and her shawl and gloves, on a chair in a\r\ncorner of the room, she went to the dressing-table, and began to\r\narrange the various useful and ornamental objects scattered about it.\r\nShe set them in order with remarkable dexterity and neatness, showing\r\na taste for arrangement, and a capacity for discriminating between\r\nthings that were likely to be wanted and things that were not, which\r\nimpressed Mr. Orridge very favorably. He particularly noticed the\r\ncarefulness with which she handled some bottles of physic, reading the\r\nlabels on each, and arranging the medicine that might be required at\r\nnight on one side of the table, and the medicine that might be\r\nrequired in the day-time on the other. When she left the\r\ndressing-table, and occupied herself in setting the furniture\r\nstraight, and in folding up articles of clothing that had been thrown\r\non one side, not the slightest movement of her thin, wasted hands\r\nseemed ever to be made at hazard or in vain. Noiselessly, modestly,\r\nobservantly, she moved from side to side of the room, and neatness and\r\norder followed her steps wherever she went. When Mr. Orridge resumed\r\nhis place at Mrs. Frankland\'s bedside, his mind was at ease on one\r\npoint at least--it was perfectly evident that the new nurse could be\r\ndepended on to make no mistakes.\r\n\r\n"What an odd woman she is," whispered Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Odd, indeed," returned Mr. Orridge, "and desperately broken in\r\nhealth, though she may not confess to it. However, she is wonderfully\r\nneat-handed and careful, and there can be no harm in trying her for\r\none night--that is to say, unless you feel any objection."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," said Rosamond, "she rather interests me. There is\r\nsomething in her face and manner--I can\'t say what--that makes me feel\r\ncurious to know more of her. I must get her to talk, and try if I\r\ncan\'t bring out all her peculiarities. Don\'t be afraid of my exciting\r\nmyself, and don\'t stop here in this dull room on my account. I would\r\nmuch rather you went down stairs, and kept my husband company over his\r\nwine. Do go and talk to him, and amuse him a little--he must be so\r\ndull, poor fellow, while I am up here; and he likes you, Mr.\r\nOrridge--he does, very much. Stop one moment, and just look at the\r\nbaby again. He doesn\'t take a dangerous quantity of sleep, does he?\r\nAnd, Mr. Orridge, one word more: When you have done your wine, you\r\nwill promise to lend my husband the use of your eyes, and bring him up\r\nstairs to wish me good-night, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nWillingly engaging to pay attention to Mrs. Frankland\'s request, Mr.\r\nOrridge left the bedside.\r\n\r\nAs he opened the room door, he stopped to tell Mrs. Jazeph that he\r\nshould be down stairs if she wanted him, and that he would give her\r\nany instructions of which she might stand in need later in the\r\nevening, before he left the inn for the night. The new nurse, when he\r\npassed by her, was kneeling over one of Mrs. Frankland\'s open trunks,\r\narranging some articles of clothing which had been rather carelessly\r\nfolded up. Just before he spoke to her, he observed that she had a\r\nchemisette in her hand, the frill of which was laced through with\r\nribbon.\r\n\r\nOne end of this ribbon she appeared to him to be on the point of\r\ndrawing out, when the sound of his footsteps disturbed her. The moment\r\nshe became aware of his approach she dropped the chemisette suddenly\r\nin the trunk, and covered it over with some handkerchiefs. Although\r\nthis proceeding on Mrs. Jazeph\'s part rather surprised the doctor, he\r\nabstained from showing that he had noticed it. Her mistress had\r\nvouched for her character, after five years\' experience of it, and the\r\nbit of ribbon was intrinsically worthless. On both accounts, it was\r\nimpossible to suspect her of attempting to steal it; and yet, as Mr.\r\nOrridge could not help feeling when he had left the room, her conduct,\r\nwhen he surprised her over the trunk, was exactly the conduct of a\r\nperson who is about to commit a theft.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t trouble yourself about my luggage," said Rosamond,\r\nremarking Mrs. Jazeph\'s occupation as soon as the doctor had gone.\r\n"That is my idle maid\'s business, and you will only make her more\r\ncareless than ever if you do it for her. I am sure the room is\r\nbeautifully set in order. Come here and sit down and rest yourself.\r\nYou must be a very unselfish, kind-hearted woman to give yourself all\r\nthis trouble to serve a stranger. The doctor\'s message this afternoon\r\ntold me that your mistress was a friend of my poor, dear father\'s. I\r\nsuppose she must have known him before my time. Any way, I feel doubly\r\ngrateful to her for taking an interest in me for my father\'s sake. But\r\nyou can have no such feeling; you must have come here from pure\r\ngood-nature and anxiety to help others. Don\'t go away, there, to the\r\nwindow. Come and sit down by me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph had risen from the trunk, and was approaching the\r\nbedside--when she suddenly turned away in the direction of the\r\nfire-place, just as Mrs. Frankland began to speak of her father.\r\n\r\n"Come and sit here," reiterated Rosamond, getting impatient at\r\nreceiving no answer. "What in the world are you doing there at the\r\nfoot of the bed?"\r\n\r\nThe figure of the new nurse again interposed between the bed and the\r\nfading evening light that glimmered through the window before there\r\nwas any reply.\r\n\r\n"The evening is closing in," said Mrs. Jazeph, "and the window is not\r\nquite shut. I was thinking of making it fast, and of drawing down the\r\nblind--if you had no objection, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not yet! not yet! Shut the window, if you please, in case the\r\nbaby should catch cold, but don\'t draw down the blind. Let me get my\r\npeep at the view as long as there is any light left to see it by. That\r\nlong flat stretch of grazing-ground out there is just beginning, at\r\nthis dim time, to look a little like my childish recollections of a\r\nCornish moor. Do you know any thing about Cornwall, Mrs. Jazeph?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard--" At those first three words of reply the nurse\r\nstopped. She was just then engaged in shutting the window, and she\r\nseemed to find some difficulty in closing the lock.\r\n\r\n"What have you heard?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I have heard that Cornwall is a wild, dreary country," said Mrs.\r\nJazeph, still busying herself with the lock of the window, and, by\r\nconsequence, still keeping her back turned to Mrs. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you shut the window, yet?" said Rosamond. "My maid always does\r\nit quite easily. Leave it till she comes up--I am going to ring for\r\nher directly. I want her to brush my hair and cool my face with a\r\nlittle Eau de Cologne and water."\r\n\r\n"I have shut it, ma\'am," said Mrs. Jazeph, suddenly succeeding in\r\nclosing the lock. "And if you will allow me, I should be very glad to\r\nmake you comfortable for the night, and save you the trouble of\r\nringing for the maid."\r\n\r\nThinking the new nurse the oddest woman she had ever met with, Mrs.\r\nFrankland accepted the offer. By the time Mrs. Jazeph had prepared the\r\nEau de Cologne and water, the twilight was falling softly over the\r\nlandscape outside, and the room was beginning to grow dark.\r\n\r\n"Had you not better light a candle?" suggested Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I think not, ma\'am," said Mrs. Jazeph, rather hastily. "I can see\r\nquite well without."\r\n\r\nShe began to brush Mrs. Frankland\'s hair as she spoke; and, at the\r\nsame time, asked a question which referred to the few words that had\r\npassed between them on the subject of Cornwall. Pleased to find that\r\nthe new nurse had grown familiar enough at last to speak before she\r\nwas spoken to, Rosamond desired nothing better than to talk about her\r\nrecollections of her native country. But, from some inexplicable\r\nreason, Mrs. Jazeph\'s touch, light and tender as it was, had such a\r\nstrangely disconcerting effect on her, that she could not succeed, for\r\nthe moment, in collecting her thoughts so as to reply, except in the\r\nbriefest manner. The careful hands of the nurse lingered with a\r\nstealthy gentleness among the locks of her hair; the pale, wasted face\r\nof the new nurse approached, every now and then, more closely to her\r\nown than appeared at all needful. A vague sensation of uneasiness,\r\nwhich she could not trace to any particular part of her--which she\r\ncould hardly say that she really felt, in a bodily sense, at\r\nall--seemed to be floating about her, to be hanging around and over\r\nher, like the air she breathed. She could not move, though she wanted\r\nto move in the bed; she could not turn her head so as to humor the\r\naction of the brush; she could not look round; she could not break the\r\nembarrassing silence which had been caused by her own short,\r\ndiscouraging answer. At last the sense of oppression--whether fancied\r\nor real--irritated her into snatching the brush out of Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nhand. The instant she had done so, she felt ashamed of the\r\ndiscourteous abruptness of the action, and confused at the alarm and\r\nsurprise which the manner of the nurse exhibited. With the strongest\r\nsense of the absurdity of her own conduct, and yet without the least\r\npower of controlling herself, she burst out laughing, and tossed the\r\nbrush away to the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t look surprised, Mrs. Jazeph," she said, still laughing\r\nwithout knowing why, and without feeling in the slightest degree\r\namused. "I\'m very rude and odd, I know. You have brushed my hair\r\ndelightfully; but--I can\'t tell how--it seemed, all the time, as if\r\nyou were brushing the strangest fancies into my head. I can\'t help\r\nlaughing at them--I can\'t indeed! Do you know, once or twice, I\r\nabsolutely fancied, when your face was closest to mine, that you\r\nwanted to kiss me! Did you ever hear of any thing so ridiculous? I\r\ndeclare I am more of a baby, in some things, than the little darling\r\nhere by my side!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph made no answer. She left the bed while Rosamond was\r\nspeaking, and came back, after an unaccountably long delay, with the\r\nEau de Cologne and water. As she held the basin while Mrs. Frankland\r\nbathed her face, she kept away at arm\'s length, and came no nearer\r\nwhen it was time to offer the towel. Rosamond began to be afraid that\r\nshe had seriously offended Mrs. Jazeph, and tried to soothe and\r\npropitiate her by asking questions about the management of the baby.\r\nThere was a slight trembling in the sweet voice of the new nurse, but\r\nnot the faintest tone of sullenness or anger, as she simply and\r\nquietly answered the inquiries addressed to her. By dint of keeping\r\nthe conversation still on the subject of the child, Mrs. Frankland\r\nsucceeded, little by little, in luring her back to the bedside--in\r\ntempting her to bend down admiringly over the infant--in emboldening\r\nher, at last, to kiss him tenderly on the cheek. One kiss was all that\r\nshe gave; and she turned away from the bed, after it, and sighed\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nThe sound of that sigh fell very sadly on Rosamond\'s heart. Up to this\r\ntime the baby\'s little span of life had always been associated with\r\nsmiling faces and pleasant words. It made her uneasy to think that any\r\none could caress him and sigh after it.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you must be fond of children," she said, hesitating a\r\nlittle from natural delicacy of feeling. "But will you excuse me for\r\nnoticing that it seems rather a mournful fondness? Pray--pray don\'t\r\nanswer my question if it gives you any pain--if you have any loss to\r\ndeplore; but--but I do so want to ask if you have ever had a child of\r\nyour own?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph was standing near a chair when that question was put. She\r\ncaught fast hold of the back of it, grasping it so firmly, or perhaps\r\nleaning on it so heavily, that the woodwork cracked. Her head dropped\r\nlow on her bosom. She did not utter, or even attempt to utter, a\r\nsingle word.\r\n\r\nFearing that she must have lost a child of her own, and dreading to\r\ndistress her unnecessarily by venturing to ask any more questions,\r\nRosamond said nothing, as she stooped over the baby to kiss him in her\r\nturn. Her lips rested on his cheek a little above where Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nlips had rested the moment before, and they touched a spot of wet on\r\nhis smooth warm skin. Fearing that some of the water in which she had\r\nbeen bathing her face might have dropped on him, she passed her\r\nfingers lightly over his head, neck, and bosom, and felt no other\r\nspots of wet any where. The one drop that had fallen on him was the\r\ndrop that wetted the cheek which the new nurse had kissed.\r\n\r\nThe twilight faded over the landscape, the room grew darker and\r\ndarker; and still, though she was now sitting close to the table on\r\nwhich the candles and matches were placed, Mrs. Jazeph made no attempt\r\nto strike a light. Rosamond did not feel quite comfortable at the idea\r\nof lying awake in the darkness, with nobody in the room but a person\r\nwho was as yet almost a total stranger; and she resolved to have the\r\ncandles lighted immediately.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Jazeph," she said, looking toward the gathering obscurity\r\noutside the window, "I shall be much obliged to you, if you will light\r\nthe candles and pull down the blind. I can trace no more resemblances\r\nout there, now, to a Cornish prospect; the view has gone altogether."\r\n\r\n"Are you very fond of Cornwall, ma\'am?" asked Mrs. Jazeph, rising, in\r\nrather a dilatory manner, to light the candles.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am," said Rosamond. "I was born there; and my husband and I\r\nwere on our way to Cornwall when we were obliged to stop, on my\r\naccount, at this place. You are a long time getting the candles lit.\r\nCan\'t you find the match-box?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph, with an awkwardness which was rather surprising in a\r\nperson who had shown so much neat-handedness in setting the room to\r\nrights, broke the first match in attempting to light it, and let the\r\nsecond go out the instant after the flame was kindled. At the third\r\nattempt she was more successful; but she only lit one candle, and that\r\none she carried away from the table which Mrs. Frankland could see, to\r\nthe dressing-table, which was hidden from her by the curtains at the\r\nfoot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Why do you move the candle?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was best for your eyes, ma\'am, not to have the light too\r\nnear them," replied Mrs. Jazeph; and then added hastily, as if she was\r\nunwilling to give Mrs. Frankland time to make any objections--"And so\r\nyou were going to Cornwall, ma\'am, when you stopped at this place? To\r\ntravel about there a little, I suppose?" After saying these words, she\r\ntook up the second candle, and passed out of sight as she carried it\r\nto the dressing-table.\r\n\r\nRosamond thought that the nurse, in spite of her gentle looks and\r\nmanners, was a remarkably obstinate woman. But she was too\r\ngood-natured to care about asserting her right to have the candles\r\nplaced where she pleased; and when she answered Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nquestion, she still spoke to her as cheerfully and familiarly as ever.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no! Not to travel about," she said, "but to go straight to\r\nthe old country-house where I was born. It belongs to my husband now,\r\nMrs. Jazeph. I have not been near it since I was a little girl of five\r\nyears of age. Such a ruinous, rambling old place! You, who talk of the\r\ndreariness and wildness of Cornwall, would be quite horrified at the\r\nvery idea of living in Porthgenna Tower."\r\n\r\nThe faintly rustling sound of Mrs. Jazeph\'s silk dress, as she moved\r\nabout the dressing-table, had been audible all the while Rosamond was\r\nspeaking. It ceased instantaneously when she said the words\r\n"Porthgenna Tower;" and for one moment there was a dead silence in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"You, who have been living all your life, I suppose, in nicely\r\nrepaired houses, can not imagine what a place it is that we are going\r\nto, when I am well enough to travel again," pursued Rosamond. "What do\r\nyou think, Mrs. Jazeph, of a house with one whole side of it that has\r\nnever been inhabited for sixty or seventy years past? You may get some\r\nnotion of the size of Porthgenna Tower from that. There is a west side\r\nthat we are to live in when we get there, and a north side, where the\r\nempty old rooms are, which I hope we shall be able to repair. Only\r\nthink of the hosts of odd, old-fashioned things that we may find in\r\nthose uninhabited rooms! I mean to put on the cook\'s apron and the\r\ngardener\'s gloves, and rummage all over them from top to bottom. How I\r\nshall astonish the housekeeper, when I get to Porthgenna, and ask her\r\nfor the keys of the ghostly north rooms!"\r\n\r\nA low cry, and a sound as if something had struck against the\r\ndressing-table, followed Mrs. Frankland\'s last words. She started in\r\nthe bed, and asked eagerly what was the matter.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," answered Mrs. Jazeph, speaking so constrainedly that her\r\nvoice dropped to a whisper. "Nothing, ma\'am--nothing, I assure you. I\r\nstruck my side, by accident, against the table--pray don\'t be\r\nalarmed!--it\'s not worth noticing."\r\n\r\n"But you speak as if you were in pain," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"No, no--not in pain. Not hurt--not hurt, indeed."\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Jazeph was declaring that she was not hurt, the door of the\r\nroom was opened, and the doctor entered, leading in Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"We come early, Mrs. Frankland, but we are going to give you plenty of\r\ntime to compose yourself for the night," said Mr. Orridge. He paused,\r\nand noticed that Rosamond\'s color was heightened. "I am afraid you\r\nhave been talking and exciting yourself a little too much," he went\r\non. "If you will excuse me for venturing on the suggestion, Mr.\r\nFrankland, I think the sooner good-night is said the better. Where is\r\nthe nurse?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph sat down with her back to the lighted candle when she\r\nheard herself asked for. Just before that, she had been looking at Mr.\r\nFrankland with an eager, undisguised curiosity, which, if any one had\r\nnoticed it, must have appeared surprisingly out of character with her\r\nusual modesty and refinement of manner.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid the nurse has accidentally hurt her side more than she is\r\nwilling to confess," said Rosamond to the doctor, pointing with one\r\nhand to the place in which Mrs. Jazeph was sitting, and raising the\r\nother to her husband\'s neck as he stooped over her pillow.\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge, on inquiring what had happened, could not prevail on the\r\nnew nurse to acknowledge that the accident was of the slightest\r\nconsequence. He suspected, nevertheless, that she was suffering, or,\r\nat least, that something had happened to discompose her; for he found\r\nthe greatest difficulty in fixing her attention, while he gave her a\r\nfew needful directions in case her services were required during the\r\nnight. All the time he was speaking, her eyes wandered away from him\r\nto the part of the room where Mr. and Mrs. Frankland were talking\r\ntogether. Mrs. Jazeph looked like the last person in the world who\r\nwould be guilty of an act of impertinent curiosity; and yet she openly\r\nbetrayed all the characteristics of an inquisitive woman while Mr.\r\nFrankland was standing by his wife\'s pillow. The doctor was obliged to\r\nassume his most peremptory manner before he could get her to attend to\r\nhim at all.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mrs. Frankland," said Mr. Orridge, turning away from the\r\nnurse, "as I have given Mrs. Jazeph all the directions she wants, I\r\nshall set the example of leaving you in quiet by saying good-night."\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the hint conveyed in these words, Mr. Frankland\r\nattempted to say good-night too, but his wife kept tight hold of both\r\nhis hands, and declared that it was unreasonable to expect her to let\r\nhim go for another half-hour at least. Mr. Orridge shook his head, and\r\nbegan to expatiate on the evils of over-excitement, and the blessings\r\nof composure and sleep. His remonstrances, however, would have\r\nproduced very little effect, even if Rosamond had allowed him to\r\ncontinue them, but for the interposition of the baby, who happened to\r\nwake up at that moment, and who proved himself a powerful auxiliary on\r\nthe doctor\'s side, by absorbing all his mother\'s attention\r\nimmediately. Seizing his opportunity at the right moment, Mr. Orridge\r\nquietly led Mr. Frankland out of the room, just as Rosamond was taking\r\nthe child up in her arms. He stopped before closing the door to\r\nwhisper one last word to Mrs. Jazeph.\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. Frankland wants to talk, you must not encourage her," he\r\nsaid. "As soon as she has quieted the baby, she ought to go to sleep.\r\nThere is a chair-bedstead in that corner, which you can open for\r\nyourself when you want to lie down. Keep the candle where it is now,\r\nbehind the curtain. The less light Mrs. Frankland sees, the sooner she\r\nwill compose herself to sleep."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph made no answer; she only looked at the doctor and\r\ncourtesied. That strangely scared expression in her eyes, which he had\r\nnoticed on first seeing her, was more painfully apparent than ever\r\nwhen he left her alone for the night with the mother and child. "She\r\nwill never do," thought Mr. Orridge, as he led Mr. Frankland down the\r\ninn stairs. "We shall have to send to London for a nurse, after all."\r\n\r\nFeeling a little irritated by the summary manner in which her husband\r\nhad been taken away from her, Rosamond fretfully rejected the offers\r\nof assistance which were made to her by Mrs. Jazeph as soon as the\r\ndoctor had left the room. The nurse said nothing when her services\r\nwere declined; and yet, judging by her conduct, she seemed anxious to\r\nspeak. Twice she advanced toward the bedside--opened her\r\nlips--stopped--and retired confusedly, before she settled herself\r\nfinally in her former place by the dressing-table. Here she remained,\r\nsilent and out of sight, until the child had been quieted, and had\r\nfallen asleep in his mother\'s arms, with one little pink, half-closed\r\nhand resting on her bosom. Rosamond could not resist raising the hand\r\nto her lips, though she risked waking him again by doing so. As she\r\nkissed it, the sound of the kiss was followed by a faint, suppressed\r\nsob, proceeding from the other side of the curtains at the lower end\r\nof the bed.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, ma\'am," said Mrs. Jazeph, in the same constrained,\r\nwhispering tones in which she had answered Mrs. Frankland\'s former\r\nquestion. "I think I was just falling asleep in the arm-chair here;\r\nand I ought to have told you perhaps that, having had my troubles, and\r\nbeing afflicted with a heart complaint, I have a habit of sighing in\r\nmy sleep. It means nothing, ma\'am, and I hope you will be good enough\r\nto excuse it."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s generous instincts were aroused in a moment.\r\n\r\n"Excuse it!" she said. "I hope I may do better than that, Mrs. Jazeph,\r\nand be the means of relieving it. When Mr. Orridge comes to-morrow you\r\nshall consult him, and I will take care that you want for nothing that\r\nhe may order. No! no! Don\'t thank me until I have been the means of\r\nmaking you well--and keep where you are, if the arm-chair is\r\ncomfortable. The baby is asleep again; and I should like to have half\r\nan hour\'s quiet before I change to the night side of the bed. Stop\r\nwhere you are for the present: I will call as soon as I want you."\r\n\r\nSo far from exercising a soothing effect on Mrs. Jazeph, these kindly\r\nmeant words produced the precisely opposite result of making her\r\nrestless. She began to walk about the room, and confusedly attempted\r\nto account for the change in her conduct by saying that she wished to\r\nsatisfy herself that all her arrangements were properly made for the\r\nnight. In a few minutes more she began, in defiance of the doctor\'s\r\nprohibition, to tempt Mrs. Frankland into talking again, by asking\r\nquestions about Porthgenna Tower, and by referring to the chances for\r\nand against its being chosen as a permanent residence by the young\r\nmarried couple.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, ma\'am," she said, speaking on a sudden, with an eagerness in\r\nher voice which was curiously at variance with the apparent\r\nindifference of her manner--"Perhaps when you see Porthgenna Tower you\r\nmay not like it so well as you think you will now. Who can tell that\r\nyou may not get tired and leave the place again after a few\r\ndays--especially if you go into the empty rooms? I should have\r\nthought--if you will excuse my saying so, ma\'am--I should have thought\r\nthat a lady like you would have liked to get as far away as possible\r\nfrom dirt and dust, and disagreeable smells."\r\n\r\n"I can face worse inconveniences than those, where my curiosity is\r\nconcerned," said Rosamond. "And I am more curious to see the\r\nuninhabited rooms at Porthgenna than to see the Seven Wonders of the\r\nWorld. Even if we don\'t settle altogether at the old house, I feel\r\ncertain that we shall stay there for some time."\r\n\r\nAt that answer, Mrs. Jazeph abruptly turned away, and asked no more\r\nquestions. She retired to a corner of the room near the door, where\r\nthe chair-bedstead stood which the doctor had pointed out to\r\nher--occupied herself for a few minutes in making it ready for the\r\nnight--then left it as suddenly as she had approached it, and began to\r\nwalk up and down once more. This unaccountable restlessness, which had\r\nalready surprised Rosamond, now made her feel rather uneasy--especially\r\nwhen she once or twice overheard Mrs. Jazeph talking to herself.\r\nJudging by words and fragments of sentences that were audible now and\r\nthen, her mind was still running, with the most inexplicable\r\npersistency, on the subject of Porthgenna Tower. As the minutes wore\r\non, and she continued to walk up and down, and still went on talking,\r\nRosamond\'s uneasiness began to strengthen into something like alarm.\r\nShe resolved to awaken Mrs. Jazeph, in the least offensive manner, to\r\na sense of the strangeness of her own conduct, by noticing that she\r\nwas talking, but by not appearing to understand that she was talking\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n"What did you say?" asked Rosamond, putting the question at a moment\r\nwhen the nurse\'s voice was most distinctly betraying her in the act of\r\nthinking aloud.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph stopped, and raised her head vacantly, as if she had been\r\nawakened out of a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were saying something more about our old house,"\r\ncontinued Rosamond. "I thought I heard you say that I ought not to go\r\nto Porthgenna, or that you would not go there in my place, or\r\nsomething of that sort."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph blushed like a young girl. "I think you must have been\r\nmistaken, ma\'am," she said, and stooped over the chair-bedstead again.\r\n\r\nWatching her anxiously, Rosamond saw that, while she was affecting to\r\narrange the bedstead, she was doing nothing whatever to prepare it for\r\nbeing slept in. What did that mean? What did her whole conduct mean\r\nfor the last half-hour? As Mrs. Frankland asked herself those\r\nquestions, the thrill of a terrible suspicion turned her cold to the\r\nvery roots of her hair. It had never occurred to her before, but it\r\nsuddenly struck her now, with the force of positive conviction, that\r\nthe new nurse was not in her right senses.\r\n\r\nAll that was unaccountable in her behavior--her odd disappearances\r\nbehind the curtains at the foot of the bed; her lingering, stealthy,\r\nover-familiar way of using the hair-brush; her silence at one time,\r\nher talkativeness at another; her restlessness, her whispering to\r\nherself, her affectation of being deeply engaged in doing something\r\nwhich she was not doing at all--every one of her strange actions\r\n(otherwise incomprehensible) became intelligible in a moment on that\r\none dreadful supposition that she was mad.\r\n\r\nTerrified as she was, Rosamond kept her presence of mind. One of her\r\narms stole instinctively round the child; and she had half raised the\r\nother to catch at the bell-rope hanging above her pillow, when she saw\r\nMrs. Jazeph turn and look at her.\r\n\r\nA woman possessed only of ordinary nerve would, probably, at that\r\ninstant have pulled at the bell-rope in the unreasoning desperation of\r\nsheer fright. Rosamond had courage enough to calculate consequences,\r\nand to remember that Mrs. Jazeph would have time to lock the door,\r\nbefore assistance could arrive, if she betrayed her suspicions by\r\nringing without first assigning some plausible reason for doing so.\r\nShe slowly closed her eyes as the nurse looked at her, partly to\r\nconvey the notion that she was composing herself to sleep--partly to\r\ngain time to think of some safe excuse for summoning her maid. The\r\nflurry of her spirits, however, interfered with the exercise of her\r\ningenuity. Minute after minute dragged on heavily, and still she could\r\nthink of no assignable reason for ringing the bell.\r\n\r\nShe was just doubting whether it would not be safest to send Mrs.\r\nJazeph out of the room, on some message to her husband, to lock the\r\ndoor the moment she was alone, and then to ring--she was just doubting\r\nwhether she would boldly adopt this course of proceeding or not, when\r\nshe heard the rustle of the nurse\'s silk dress approaching the\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nHer first impulse was to snatch at the bell-rope; but fear had\r\nparalyzed her hand; she could not raise it from the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe rustling of the silk dress ceased. She half unclosed her eyes, and\r\nsaw that the nurse was stopping midway between the part of the room\r\nfrom which she had advanced and the bedside. There was nothing wild or\r\nangry in her look. The agitation which her face expressed was the\r\nagitation of perplexity and alarm. She stood rapidly clasping and\r\nunclasping her hands, the image of bewilderment and distress--stood so\r\nfor nearly a minute--then came forward a few steps more, and said\r\ninquiringly, in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"Not asleep? not quite asleep, yet?"\r\n\r\nRosamond tried to speak in answer, but the quick beating of her heart\r\nseemed to rise up to her very lips, and to stifle the words on them.\r\n\r\nThe nurse came on, still with the same perplexity and distress in her\r\nface, to within a foot of the bedside--knelt down by the pillow, and\r\nlooked earnestly at Rosamond--shuddered a little, and glanced all\r\nround her, as if to make sure that the room was empty--bent\r\nforward--hesitated--bent nearer, and whispered into her ear these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n"When you go to Porthgenna, _keep out of the Myrtle Room_!"\r\n\r\nThe hot breath of the woman, as she spoke, beat on Rosamond\'s cheek,\r\nand seemed to fly in one fever-throb through every vein of her body.\r\nThe nervous shock of that unutterable sensation burst the bonds of the\r\nterror that had hitherto held her motionless and speechless. She\r\nstarted up in bed with a scream, caught hold of the bell-rope, and\r\npulled it violently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush! hush!" cried Mrs. Jazeph, sinking back on her knees, and\r\nbeating her hands together despairingly with the helpless\r\ngesticulation of a child.\r\n\r\nRosamond rang again and again. Hurrying footsteps and eager voices\r\nwere heard outside on the stairs. It was not ten o\'clock yet--nobody\r\nhad retired for the night--and the violent ringing had already alarmed\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe nurse rose to her feet, staggered back from the bedside, and\r\nsupported herself against the wall of the room, as the footsteps and\r\nthe voices reached the door. She said not another word. The hands that\r\nshe had been beating together so violently but an instant before hung\r\ndown nerveless at her side. The blank of a great agony spread over all\r\nher face, and stilled it awfully.\r\n\r\nThe first person who entered the room was Mrs. Frankland\'s maid, and\r\nthe landlady followed her.\r\n\r\n"Fetch Mr. Frankland," said Rosamond, faintly, addressing the\r\nlandlady. "I want to speak to him directly.--You," she continued,\r\nbeckoning to the maid, "sit by me here till your master comes. I have\r\nbeen dreadfully frightened. Don\'t ask me questions; but stop here."\r\n\r\nThe maid stared at her mistress in amazement; then looked round with a\r\ndisparaging frown at the nurse. When the landlady left the room to\r\nfetch Mr. Frankland, she had moved a little away from the wall, so as\r\nto command a full view of the bed. Her eyes were fixed with a look of\r\nbreathless suspense, of devouring anxiety, on Rosamond\'s face. From\r\nall her other features the expression seemed to be gone. She said\r\nnothing, she noticed nothing. She did not start, she did not move\r\naside an inch, when the landlady returned, and led Mr. Frankland to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"Lenny! don\'t let the new nurse stop here to-night--pray, pray don\'t!"\r\nwhispered Rosamond, eagerly catching her husband by the arm.\r\n\r\nWarned by the trembling of her hand, Mr. Frankland laid his fingers\r\nlightly on her temples and on her heart.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens, Rosamond! what has happened? I left you quiet and\r\ncomfortable, and now--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been frightened, dear--dreadfully frightened, by the new nurse.\r\nDon\'t be hard on her, poor creature; she is not in her right senses--I\r\nam certain she is not. Only get her away quietly--only send her back\r\nat once to where she came from. I shall die of the fright, if she\r\nstops here. She has been behaving so strangely--she has spoken such\r\nwords to me--Lenny! Lenny! don\'t let go of my hand. She came stealing\r\nup to me so horribly, just where you are now; she knelt down at my\r\near, and whispered--oh, such words!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, love!" said Mr. Frankland, getting seriously alarmed by\r\nthe violence of Rosamond\'s agitation. "Never mind repeating the words\r\nnow; wait till you are calmer--I beg and entreat of you, wait till you\r\nare calmer. I will do every thing you wish, if you will only lie down\r\nand be quiet, and try to compose yourself before you say another word.\r\nIt is quite enough for me to know that this woman has frightened you,\r\nand that you wish her to be sent away with as little harshness as\r\npossible. We will put off all further explanations till to-morrow\r\nmorning. I deeply regret now that I did not persist in carrying out my\r\nown idea of sending for a proper nurse from London. Where is the\r\nlandlady?"\r\n\r\nThe landlady placed herself by Mr. Frankland\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Is it late?" asked Leonard.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Sir; not ten o\'clock yet."\r\n\r\n"Order a fly to be brought to the door, then, as soon as possible, if\r\nyou please. Where is the nurse?"\r\n\r\n"Standing behind you, Sir, near the wall," said the maid.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Frankland turned in that direction, Rosamond whispered to him:\r\n"Don\'t be hard on her, Lenny."\r\n\r\nThe maid, looking with contemptuous curiosity at Mrs. Jazeph, saw the\r\nwhole expression of her countenance alter, as those words were spoken.\r\nThe tears rose thick in her eyes, and flowed down her cheeks. The\r\ndeathly spell of stillness that had lain on her face was broken in an\r\ninstant. She drew back again, close to the wall, and leaned against it\r\nas before. "Don\'t be hard on her!" the maid heard her repeat to\r\nherself, in a low sobbing voice. "Don\'t be hard on her! Oh, my God!\r\nshe said that kindly--she said that kindly, at least!"\r\n\r\n"I have no desire to speak to you, or to use you unkindly," said Mr.\r\nFrankland, imperfectly hearing what she said. "I know nothing of what\r\nhas happened, and I make no accusations. I find Mrs. Frankland\r\nviolently agitated and frightened; I hear her connect that agitation\r\nwith you--not angrily, but compassionately--and, instead of speaking\r\nharshly, I prefer leaving it to your own sense of what is right, to\r\ndecide whether your attendance here ought not to cease at once. I have\r\nprovided the proper means for your conveyance from this place; and I\r\nwould suggest that you should make our apologies to your mistress, and\r\nsay nothing more than that circumstances have happened which oblige us\r\nto dispense with your services."\r\n\r\n"You have been considerate toward me, Sir," said Mrs. Jazeph, speaking\r\nquietly, and with a certain gentle dignity in her manner, "and I will\r\nnot prove myself unworthy of your forbearance by saying what I might\r\nsay in my own defense." She advanced into the middle of the room, and\r\nstopped where she could see Rosamond plainly. Twice she attempted to\r\nspeak, and twice her voice failed her. At the third effort she\r\nsucceeded in controlling herself.\r\n\r\n"Before I go, ma\'am," she said, "I hope you will believe that I have\r\nno bitter feeling against you for sending me away. I am not\r\nangry--pray remember always that I was not angry, and that I never\r\ncomplained."\r\n\r\nThere was such a forlornness in her face, such a sweet, sorrowful\r\nresignation in every tone of her voice during the utterance of these\r\nfew words, that Rosamond\'s heart smote her.\r\n\r\n"Why did you frighten me?" she asked, half relenting.\r\n\r\n"Frighten you? How could I frighten you? Oh me! of all the people in\r\nthe world, how could _I_ frighten you?"\r\n\r\nMournfully saying those words, the nurse went to the chair on which\r\nshe had placed her bonnet and shawl, and put them on. The landlady and\r\nthe maid, watching her with curious eyes, detected that she was again\r\nweeping bitterly, and noticed with astonishment, at the same time, how\r\nneatly she put on her bonnet and shawl. The wasted hands were moving\r\nmechanically, and were trembling while they moved,--and yet, slight\r\nthing though it was, the inexorable instinct of propriety guided their\r\nmost trifling actions still.\r\n\r\nOn her way to the door, she stopped again at passing the bedside,\r\nlooked through her tears at Rosamond and the child, struggled a little\r\nwith herself, and then spoke her farewell words--\r\n\r\n"God bless you, and keep you and your child happy and prosperous," she\r\nsaid. "I am not angry at being sent away. If you ever think of me\r\nagain, after to-night, please to remember that I was not angry, and\r\nthat I never complained."\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment longer, still weeping, and still looking\r\nthrough her tears at the mother and child--then turned away and walked\r\nto the door. Something in the last tones of her voice caused a silence\r\nin the room. Of the four persons in it not one could utter a word, as\r\nthe nurse closed the door gently, and went out from them alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA COUNCIL OF THREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the departure of Mrs. Jazeph, the news that she\r\nhad been sent away from the Tiger\'s Head by Mr. Frankland\'s\r\ndirections, reached the doctor\'s residence from the inn just as he was\r\nsitting down to breakfast. Finding that the report of the nurse\'s\r\ndismissal was not accompanied by any satisfactory explanation of the\r\ncause of it, Mr. Orridge refused to believe that her attendance on\r\nMrs. Frankland had really ceased. However, although he declined to\r\ncredit the news, he was so far disturbed by it that he finished his\r\nbreakfast in a hurry, and went to pay his morning visit at the Tiger\'s\r\nHead nearly two hours before the time at which he usually attended on\r\nhis patient.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the inn, he was met and stopped by the one waiter\r\nattached to the establishment. "I was just bringing you a message from\r\nMr. Frankland, Sir," said the man. "He wants to see you as soon as\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"Is it true that Mrs. Frankland\'s nurse was sent away last night by\r\nMr. Frankland\'s order?" asked Mr. Orridge.\r\n\r\n"Quite true, Sir," answered the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe doctor colored, and looked seriously discomposed. One of the most\r\nprecious things we have about us--especially if we happen to belong to\r\nthe medical profession--is our dignity. It struck Mr. Orridge that he\r\nought to have been consulted before a nurse of his recommending was\r\ndismissed from her situation at a moment\'s notice. Was Mr. Frankland\r\npresuming upon his position as a gentleman of fortune? The power of\r\nwealth may do much with impunity, but it is not privileged to offer\r\nany practical contradictions to a man\'s good opinion of himself. Never\r\nhad the doctor thought more disrespectfully of rank and riches; never\r\nhad he been conscious of reflecting on republican principles with such\r\nabsolute impartiality, as when he now followed the waiter in sullen\r\nsilence to Mr. Frankland\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" asked Leonard, when he heard the door open.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Orridge, Sir," said the waiter.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," said Mr. Orridge, with self-asserting abruptness and\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland was sitting in an arm-chair, with his legs crossed. Mr.\r\nOrridge carefully selected another arm-chair, and crossed his legs on\r\nthe model of Mr. Frankland\'s the moment he sat down. Mr. Frankland\'s\r\nhands were in the pockets of his dressing-gown. Mr. Orridge had no\r\npockets, except in his coat-tails, which he could not conveniently get\r\nat; but he put his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, and\r\nasserted himself against the easy insolence of wealth in that way. It\r\nmade no difference to him--so curiously narrow is the range of a man\'s\r\nperceptions when he is insisting on his own importance--that Mr.\r\nFrankland was blind, and consequently incapable of being impressed by\r\nthe independence of his bearing. Mr. Orridge\'s own dignity was\r\nvindicated in Mr. Orridge\'s own presence, and that was enough.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have come so early, doctor," said Mr. Frankland. "A\r\nvery unpleasant thing happened here last night. I was obliged to send\r\nthe new nurse away at a moment\'s notice."\r\n\r\n"Were you, indeed!" said Mr. Orridge, defensively matching Mr.\r\nFrankland\'s composure by an assumption of the completest indifference.\r\n"Aha! were you indeed?"\r\n\r\n"If there had been time to send and consult you, of course I should\r\nhave been only too glad to have done so," continued Leonard; "but it\r\nwas impossible to hesitate. We were all alarmed by a loud ringing of\r\nmy wife\'s bell; I was taken up to her room, and found her in a\r\ncondition of the most violent agitation and alarm. She told me she had\r\nbeen dreadfully frightened by the new nurse; declared her conviction\r\nthat the woman was not in her right senses; and entreated that I would\r\nget her out of the house with as little delay and as little harshness\r\nas possible. Under these circumstances, what could I do? I may seem to\r\nhave been wanting in consideration toward you, in proceeding on my own\r\nsole responsibility; but Mrs. Frankland was in such a state of\r\nexcitement that I could not tell what might be the consequence of\r\nopposing her, or of venturing on any delays; and after the difficulty\r\nhad been got over, she would not hear of your being disturbed by a\r\nsummons to the inn. I am sure you will understand this explanation,\r\ndoctor, in the spirit in which I offer it."\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge began to look a little confused. His solid substructure of\r\nindependence was softening and sinking from under him. He suddenly\r\nfound himself thinking of the cultivated manners of the wealthy\r\nclasses; his thumbs slipped mechanically out of the arm-holes of his\r\nwaistcoat; and, before he well knew what he was about, he was\r\nstammering his way through all the choicest intricacies of a\r\ncomplimentary and respectful reply.\r\n\r\n"You will naturally be anxious to know what the new nurse said or did\r\nto frighten my wife so," pursued Mr. Frankland. "I can tell you\r\nnothing in detail; for Mrs. Frankland was in such a state of nervous\r\ndread last night that I was really afraid of asking for any\r\nexplanations; and I have purposely waited to make inquiries this\r\nmorning until you could come here and accompany me up stairs. You\r\nkindly took so much trouble to secure this unlucky woman\'s attendance,\r\nthat you have a right to hear all that can be alleged against her, now\r\nshe has been sent away. Considering all things, Mrs. Frankland is not\r\nso ill this morning as I was afraid she would be. She expects to see\r\nyou with me; and, if you will kindly give me your arm, we will go up\r\nto her immediately."\r\n\r\nOn entering Mrs. Frankland\'s room, the doctor saw at a glance that\r\nshe had been altered for the worse by the events of the past evening.\r\nHe remarked that the smile with which she greeted her husband was the\r\nfaintest and saddest he had seen on her face. Her eyes looked dim and\r\nweary, her skin was dry, her pulse was irregular. It was plain that\r\nshe had passed a wakeful night, and that her mind was not at ease. She\r\ndismissed the inquiries of her medical attendant as briefly as\r\npossible, and led the conversation immediately, of her own accord, to\r\nthe subject of Mrs. Jazeph.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have heard what has happened," she said, addressing Mr.\r\nOrridge. "I can\'t tell you how grieved I am about it. My conduct must\r\nlook in your eyes, as well as in the eyes of the poor unfortunate\r\nnurse, the conduct of a capricious, unfeeling woman. I am ready to cry\r\nwith sorrow and vexation when I remember how thoughtless I was, and\r\nhow little courage I showed. Oh, Lenny, it is dreadful to hurt the\r\nfeelings of any body, but to have pained that unhappy, helpless woman\r\nas we pained her, to have made her cry so bitterly, to have caused her\r\nsuch humiliation and wretchedness--"\r\n\r\n"My dear Rosamond," interposed Mr. Frankland, "you are lamenting\r\neffects, and forgetting causes altogether. Remember what a state of\r\nterror I found you in--there must have been some reason for that.\r\nRemember, too, how strong your conviction was that the nurse was out\r\nof her senses. Surely you have not altered your opinion on that point\r\nalready?"\r\n\r\n"It is that very opinion, love, that has been perplexing and worrying\r\nme all night. I can\'t alter it; I feel more certain than ever that\r\nthere must be something wrong with the poor creature\'s intellect--and\r\nyet, when I remember how good-naturedly she came here to help me, and\r\nhow anxious she seemed to make herself useful, I can\'t help feeling\r\nashamed of my suspicions; I can\'t help reproaching myself for having\r\nbeen the cause of her dismissal last night. Mr. Orridge, did you\r\nnotice any thing in Mrs. Jazeph\'s face or manner which might lead you\r\nto doubt whether her intellects were quite as sound as they ought to\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Mrs. Frankland, or I should never have brought her\r\nhere. I should not have been astonished to hear that she was suddenly\r\ntaken ill, or that she had been seized with a fit, or that some\r\nslight accident, which would have frightened nobody else, had\r\nseriously frightened her; but to be told that there is any thing\r\napproaching to derangement in her faculties, does, I own, fairly\r\nsurprise me."\r\n\r\n"Can I have been mistaken!" exclaimed Rosamond, looking confusedly and\r\nself-distrustfully from Mr. Orridge to her husband. "Lenny! Lenny! if\r\nI have been mistaken, I shall never forgive myself."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you tell us, my dear, what led you to suspect that she was\r\nmad?" suggested Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\nRosamond hesitated. "Things that are great in one\'s own mind," she\r\nsaid, "seem to get so little when they are put into words. I almost\r\ndespair of making you understand what good reason I had to be\r\nfrightened--and then, I am afraid, in trying to do justice to myself,\r\nthat I may not do justice to the nurse."\r\n\r\n"Tell your own story, my love, in your own way, and you will be sure\r\nto tell it properly," said Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"And pray remember," added Mr. Orridge, "that I attach no real\r\nimportance to my opinion of Mrs. Jazeph. I have not had time enough to\r\nform it. Your opportunities of observing her have been far more\r\nnumerous than mine."\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Rosamond plainly and simply related all that had\r\nhappened in her room on the previous evening, up to the time when she\r\nhad closed her eyes and had heard the nurse approaching her bedside.\r\nBefore repeating the extraordinary words that Mrs. Jazeph had\r\nwhispered in her ear, she made a pause, and looked earnestly in her\r\nhusband\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Why do you stop?" asked Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"I feel nervous and flurried still, Lenny, when I think of the words\r\nthe nurse said to me, just before I rang the bell."\r\n\r\n"What did she say? Was it something you would rather not repeat?"\r\n\r\n"No! no! I am most anxious to repeat it, and to hear what you think it\r\nmeans. As I have just told you, Lenny, we had been talking of\r\nPorthgenna, and of my project of exploring the north rooms as soon as\r\nI got there; and she had been asking many questions about the old\r\nhouse; appearing, I must say, to be unaccountably interested in it,\r\nconsidering she was a stranger."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Well, when she came to the bedside, she knelt down close at my ear,\r\nand whispered all on a sudden--\'When you go to Porthgenna, keep out of\r\nthe Myrtle Room!\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland started. "Is there such a room at Porthgenna?" he asked,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"I never heard of it," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of that?" inquired Mr. Orridge. Up to this moment the\r\ndoctor had privately suspected that Mrs. Frankland must have fallen\r\nasleep soon after he left her the evening before; and that the\r\nnarrative which she was now relating, with the sincerest conviction of\r\nits reality, was actually derived from nothing but a series of vivid\r\nimpressions produced by a dream.\r\n\r\n"I am certain I never heard of such a room," said Rosamond. "I left\r\nPorthgenna at five years old; and I had never heard of it then. My\r\nfather often talked of the house in after-years; but I am certain that\r\nhe never spoke of any of the rooms by any particular names; and I can\r\nsay the same of your father, Lenny, whenever I was in his company\r\nafter he had bought the place. Besides, don\'t you remember, when the\r\nbuilder we sent down to survey the house wrote you that letter, he\r\ncomplained that there were no names of the rooms on the different keys\r\nto guide him in opening the doors, and that he could get no\r\ninformation from any body at Porthgenna on the subject? How could I\r\never have heard of the Myrtle Room? Who was there to tell me?"\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge began to look perplexed; it seemed by no means so certain\r\nthat Mrs. Frankland had been dreaming, after all.\r\n\r\n"I have thought of nothing else," said Rosamond to her husband, in\r\nlow, whispering tones. "I can\'t get those mysterious words off my\r\nmind. Feel my heart, Lenny--it is beating quicker than usual only with\r\nsaying them over to you. They are such very strange, startling words.\r\nWhat do you think they mean?"\r\n\r\n"Who is the woman who spoke them?--that is the most important\r\nquestion," said Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"But why did she say the words to _me_? That is what I want to\r\nknow--that is what I must know, if I am ever to feel easy in my mind\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\n"Gently, Mrs. Frankland, gently!" said Mr. Orridge. "For your child\'s\r\nsake, as well as for your own, pray try to be calm, and to look at\r\nthis very mysterious event as composedly as you can. If any exertions\r\nof mine can throw light upon this strange woman and her still stranger\r\nconduct, I will not spare them. I am going to-day to her mistress\'s\r\nhouse to see one of the children; and, depend upon it, I will manage\r\nin some way to make Mrs. Jazeph explain herself. Her mistress shall\r\nhear every word that you have told me; and I can assure you she is\r\njust the sort of downright, resolute woman who will insist on having\r\nthe whole mystery instantly cleared up."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s weary eyes brightened at the doctor\'s proposal. "Oh, go at\r\nonce, Mr. Orridge!" she exclaimed--"go at once!"\r\n\r\n"I have a great deal of medical work to do in the town first," said\r\nthe doctor, smiling at Mrs. Frankland\'s impatience.\r\n\r\n"Begin it, then, without losing another instant," said Rosamond. "The\r\nbaby is quite well, and I am quite well--we need not detain you a\r\nmoment. And, Mr. Orridge, pray be as gentle and considerate as\r\npossible with the poor woman; and tell her that I never should have\r\nthought of sending her away if I had not been too frightened to know\r\nwhat I was about. And say how sorry I am this morning, and say--"\r\n\r\n"My dear, if Mrs. Jazeph is really not in her right senses, what would\r\nbe the use of overwhelming her with all these excuses?" interposed Mr.\r\nFrankland. "It will be more to the purpose if Mr. Orridge will kindly\r\nexplain and apologize for us to her mistress."\r\n\r\n"Go! Don\'t stop to talk--pray go at once!" cried Rosamond, as the\r\ndoctor attempted to reply to Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid; no time shall be lost," said Mr. Orridge, opening\r\nthe door. "But remember, Mrs. Frankland, I shall expect you to reward\r\nyour embassador, when he returns from his mission, by showing him that\r\nyou are a little more quiet and composed than I find you this\r\nmorning." With that parting hint, the doctor took his leave.\r\n\r\n"\'When you go to Porthgenna, keep out of the Myrtle Room,\'" repeated\r\nMr. Frankland, thoughtfully. "Those are very strange words, Rosamond.\r\nWho can this woman really be? She is a perfect stranger to both of us;\r\nwe are brought into contact with her by the merest accident; and we\r\nfind that she knows something about our own house of which we were\r\nboth perfectly ignorant until she chose to speak!"\r\n\r\n"But the warning, Lenny--the warning, so pointedly and mysteriously\r\naddressed to me? Oh, if I could only go to sleep at once, and not wake\r\nagain till the doctor comes back!"\r\n\r\n"My love, try not to count too certainly on our being enlightened,\r\neven then. The woman may refuse to explain herself to any body."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t even hint at such a disappointment as that, Lenny--or I shall\r\nbe wanting to get up, and go and question her myself!"\r\n\r\n"Even if you could get up and question her, Rosamond, you might find\r\nit impossible to make her answer. She may be afraid of certain\r\nconsequences which we can not foresee; and, in that case, I can only\r\nrepeat that it is more than probable she will explain nothing--or,\r\nperhaps, still more likely that she will coolly deny her own words\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\n"Then, Lenny, we will put them to the proof for ourselves."\r\n\r\n"And how can we do that?"\r\n\r\n"By continuing our journey to Porthgenna the moment I am allowed to\r\ntravel, and by leaving no stone unturned when we get there until we\r\nhave discovered whether there is or is not any room in the old house\r\nthat ever was known, at any time of its existence, by the name of the\r\nMyrtle Room."\r\n\r\n"And suppose it should turn out that there is such a room?" asked Mr.\r\nFrankland, beginning to feel the influence of his wife\'s enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"If it does turn out so," said Rosamond, her voice rising, and her\r\nface lighting up with its accustomed vivacity, "how can you doubt what\r\nwill happen next? Am I not a woman? And have I not been forbidden to\r\nenter the Myrtle Room? Lenny! Lenny! Do you know so little of my half\r\nof humanity as to doubt what I should do the moment the room was\r\ndiscovered? My darling, as a matter of course, I should walk into it\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nANOTHER SURPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the haste he could make, it was one o\'clock in the afternoon\r\nbefore Mr. Orridge\'s professional avocations allowed him to set forth\r\nin his gig for Mrs. Norbury\'s house. He drove there with such\r\ngood-will that he accomplished the half-hour\'s journey in twenty\r\nminutes. The footman having heard the rapid approach of the gig,\r\nopened the hall door the instant the horse was pulled up before it,\r\nand confronted the doctor with a smile of malicious satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Orridge, bustling into the hall, "you were all rather\r\nsurprised last night when the housekeeper came back, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir, we certainly were surprised when she came back last night,"\r\nanswered the footman; "but we were still more surprised when she went\r\naway again this morning."\r\n\r\n"Went away! You don\'t mean to say she is gone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do, Sir--she has lost her place, and gone for good." The\r\nfootman smiled again, as he made that reply; and the housemaid, who\r\nhappened to be on her way down stairs while he was speaking, and to\r\nhear what he said, smiled too. Mrs. Jazeph had evidently been no\r\nfavorite in the servants\' hall.\r\n\r\nAmazement prevented Mr. Orridge from uttering another word. Hearing no\r\nmore questions asked, the footman threw open the door of the\r\nbreakfast-parlor, and the doctor followed him into the room. Mrs.\r\nNorbury was sitting near the window in a rigidly upright attitude,\r\ninflexibly watching the proceedings of her invalid child over a basin\r\nof beef-tea.\r\n\r\n"I know what you are going to talk about before you open your lips,"\r\nsaid the outspoken lady. "But just look to the child first, and say\r\nwhat you have to say on that subject, if you please, before you enter\r\non any other."\r\n\r\nThe child was examined, was pronounced to be improving rapidly, and\r\nwas carried away by the nurse to lie down and rest a little. As soon\r\nas the door of the room had closed, Mrs. Norbury abruptly addressed\r\nthe doctor, interrupting him, for the second time, just as he was\r\nabout to speak.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Orridge," she said, "I want to tell you something at the\r\noutset. I am a remarkably just woman, and I have no quarrel with\r\n_you_. You are the cause of my having been treated with the most\r\naudacious insolence by three people--but you are the innocent cause,\r\nand, therefore, I don\'t blame you."\r\n\r\n"I am really at a loss," Mr. Orridge began--"quite at a loss, I assure\r\nyou--"\r\n\r\n"To know what I mean?" said Mrs. Norbury. "I will soon tell you. Were\r\nyou not the original cause of my sending my housekeeper to nurse Mrs.\r\nFrankland?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." Mr. Orridge could not hesitate to acknowledge that.\r\n\r\n"Well," pursued Mrs. Norbury, "and the consequence of my sending her\r\nis, as I said before, that I am treated with unparalleled insolence by\r\nno less than three people. Mrs. Frankland takes an insolent whim into\r\nher head, and affects to be frightened by my housekeeper. Mr.\r\nFrankland shows an insolent readiness to humor that whim, and hands me\r\nback my housekeeper as if she was a bad shilling; and last, and worst\r\nof all, my housekeeper herself insults me to my face as soon as she\r\ncomes back--insults me, Mr. Orridge, to that degree that I give her\r\ntwelve hours\' notice to leave the place. Don\'t begin to defend\r\nyourself! I know all about it; I know you had nothing to do with\r\nsending her back; I never said you had. All the mischief you have done\r\nis innocent mischief. I don\'t blame you, remember that--whatever you\r\ndo, Mr. Orridge, remember that!"\r\n\r\n"I had no idea of defending myself," said the doctor, "for I have no\r\nreason to do so. But you surprise me beyond all power of expression\r\nwhen you tell me that Mrs. Jazeph treated you with incivility."\r\n\r\n"Incivility!" exclaimed Mrs. Norbury. "Don\'t talk about\r\nincivility--it\'s not the word. Impudence is the word--brazen\r\nimpudence. The only charitable thing to say of Mrs. Jazeph is that she\r\nis not right in her head. I never noticed any thing odd about her\r\nmyself; but the servants used to laugh at her for being as timid in\r\nthe dark as a child, and for often running away to her candle in her\r\nown room when they declined to light the lamps before the night had\r\nfairly set in. I never troubled my head about this before; but I\r\nthought of it last night, I can tell you, when I found her looking me\r\nfiercely in the face, and contradicting me flatly the moment I spoke\r\nto her."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought she was the very last woman in the world to\r\nmisbehave herself in that way," answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now hear what happened when she came back last night,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Norbury. "She got here just as we were going up stairs to\r\nbed. Of course, I was astonished; and, of course, I called her into\r\nthe drawing-room for an explanation. There was nothing very unnatural\r\nin that course of proceeding, I suppose? Well, I noticed that her eyes\r\nwere swollen and red, and that her looks were remarkably wild and\r\nqueer; but I said nothing, and waited for the explanation. All that\r\nshe had to tell me was that something she had unintentionally said or\r\ndone had frightened Mrs. Frankland, and that Mrs. Frankland\'s husband\r\nhad sent her away on the spot. I disbelieved this at first--and very\r\nnaturally, I think--but she persisted in the story, and answered all\r\nmy questions by declaring that she could tell me nothing more. \'So\r\nthen,\' I said, \'I am to believe that, after I have inconvenienced\r\nmyself by sparing you, and after you have inconvenienced yourself by\r\nundertaking the business of nurse, I am to be insulted, and you are to\r\nbe insulted, by your being sent away from Mrs. Frankland on the very\r\nday when you get to her, because she chooses to take a whim into her\r\nhead?\' \'I never accused Mrs. Frankland of taking a whim into her\r\nhead,\' said Mrs. Jazeph, and stares me straight in the face, with such\r\na look as I never saw in her eyes before, after all my five years\'\r\nexperience of her. \'What do you mean?\' I asked, giving her back her\r\nlook, I can promise you. \'Are you base enough to take the treatment\r\nyou have received in the light of a favor?\' \'I am just enough,\' said\r\nMrs. Jazeph, as sharp as lightning, and still with that same stare\r\nstraight at me--\'I am just enough not to blame Mrs. Frankland.\' \'Oh,\r\nyou are, are you?\' I said. \'Then all I can tell you is, that I feel\r\nthis insult, if you don\'t; and that I consider Mrs. Frankland\'s\r\nconduct to be the conduct of an ill-bred, impudent, capricious,\r\nunfeeling woman.\' Mrs. Jazeph takes a step up to me--takes a step, I\r\ngive you my word of honor--and says distinctly, in so many words,\r\n\'Mrs. Frankland is neither ill-bred, impudent, capricious, nor\r\nunfeeling.\' \'Do you mean to contradict me, Mrs. Jazeph?\' I asked. \'I\r\nmean to defend Mrs. Frankland from unjust imputations,\' says she.\r\nThose were her words, Mr. Orridge--on my honor, as a gentlewoman,\r\nthose were exactly her words."\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s face expressed the blankest astonishment. Mrs. Norbury\r\nwent on--\r\n\r\n"I was in a towering passion--I don\'t mind confessing that, Mr.\r\nOrridge--but I kept it down. \'Mrs. Jazeph,\' I said, \'this is language\r\nthat I am not accustomed to, and that I certainly never expected to\r\nhear from your lips. Why you should take it on yourself to defend Mrs.\r\nFrankland for treating us both with contempt, and to contradict me for\r\nresenting it, I neither know nor care to know. But I must tell you, in\r\nplain words, that I will be spoken to by every person in my\r\nemployment, from my housekeeper to my scullery-maid, with respect. I\r\nwould have given warning on the spot to any other servant in this\r\nhouse who had behaved to me as you have behaved.\' She tried to\r\ninterrupt me there, but I would not allow her. \'No,\' I said, \'you are\r\nnot to speak to me just yet; you are to hear me out. Any other\r\nservant, I tell you again, should have left this place to-morrow\r\nmorning; but I will be more than just to _you_. I will give you the\r\nbenefit of your five years\' good conduct in my service. I will leave\r\nyou the rest of the night to get cool, and to reflect on what has\r\npassed between us; and I will not expect you to make the proper\r\napologies to me until the morning.\' You see, Mr. Orridge, I was\r\ndetermined to act justly and kindly; I was ready to make\r\nallowances--and what do you think she said in return? \'I am willing to\r\nmake any apologies, ma\'am, for offending you,\' she said, \'without the\r\ndelay of a single minute; but, whether it is to-night, or whether it\r\nis to-morrow morning, I can not stand by silent when I hear Mrs.\r\nFrankland charged with acting unkindly, uncivilly, or improperly\r\ntoward me or toward any one.\' \'Do you tell me that deliberately, Mrs.\r\nJazeph?\' I asked. \'I tell it you sincerely, ma\'am,\' she answered; \'and\r\nI am very sorry to be obliged to do so.\' \'Pray don\'t trouble yourself\r\nto be sorry,\' I said, \'for you may consider yourself no longer in my\r\nservice. I will order the steward to pay you the usual month\'s wages\r\ninstead of the month\'s warning the first thing to-morrow; and I beg\r\nthat you will leave the house as soon as you conveniently can\r\nafterward.\' \'I will leave to-morrow, ma\'am,\' says she, \'but without\r\ntroubling the steward. I beg respectfully, and with many thanks for\r\nyour past kindness, to decline taking a month\'s money which I have not\r\nearned by a month\'s service.\' And thereupon she courtesies and goes\r\nout. That is, word for word, what passed between us, Mr. Orridge.\r\nExplain the woman\'s conduct in your own way, if you can. I say that it\r\nis utterly incomprehensible, unless you agree with me that she was not\r\nin her right senses when she came back to this house last night."\r\n\r\nThe doctor began to think, after what he had just heard, that Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s suspicions in relation to the new nurse were not quite so\r\nunfounded as he had been at first disposed to consider them. He wisely\r\nrefrained, however, from complicating matters by giving utterance to\r\nwhat he thought; and, after answering Mrs. Norbury in a few vaguely\r\npolite words, endeavored to soothe her irritation against Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland by assuring her that he came as the bearer of apologies from\r\nboth husband and wife, for the apparent want of courtesy and\r\nconsideration in their conduct which circumstances had made\r\ninevitable. The offended lady, however, absolutely refused to be\r\npropitiated. She rose up, and waved her hand with an air of great\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n"I can not hear a word more from you, Mr. Orridge," she said; "I can\r\nnot receive any apologies which are made indirectly. If Mr. Frankland\r\nchooses to call, and if Mrs. Frankland condescends to write to me, I\r\nam willing to think no more of the matter. Under any other\r\ncircumstances, I must be allowed to keep my present opinions both of\r\nthe lady and the gentleman. Don\'t say another word, and be so kind as\r\nto excuse me if I leave you, and go up to the nursery to see how the\r\nchild is getting on. I am delighted to hear that you think her so much\r\nbetter. Pray call again to-morrow or next day, if you conveniently\r\ncan. Good-morning!"\r\n\r\nHalf amused at Mrs. Norbury, half displeased at the curt tone she\r\nadopted toward him, Mr. Orridge remained for a minute or two alone in\r\nthe breakfast-parlor, feeling rather undecided about what he should do\r\nnext. He was, by this time, almost as much interested in solving the\r\nmystery of Mrs. Jazeph\'s extraordinary conduct as Mrs. Frankland\r\nherself; and he felt unwilling, on all accounts, to go back to the\r\nTiger\'s Head, and merely repeat what Mrs. Norbury had told him,\r\nwithout being able to complete the narrative by informing Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland of the direction that the housekeeper had taken on leaving\r\nher situation. After some pondering, he determined to question the\r\nfootman, under the pretense of desiring to know if his gig was at the\r\ndoor. The man having answered the bell, and having reported the gig to\r\nbe ready, Mr. Orridge, while crossing the hall, asked him carelessly\r\nif he knew at what time in the morning Mrs. Jazeph had left her place.\r\n\r\n"About ten o\'clock, Sir," answered the footman. "When the carrier came\r\nby from the village, on his way to the station for the eleven o\'clock\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I suppose he took her boxes?" said Mr. Orridge.\r\n\r\n"And he took her, too, Sir," said the man, with a grin. "She had to\r\nride, for once in her life, at any rate, in a carrier\'s cart."\r\n\r\nOn getting back to West Winston, the doctor stopped at the station to\r\ncollect further particulars, before he returned to the Tiger\'s Head.\r\nNo trains, either up or down, happened to be due just at that time.\r\nThe station-master was reading the newspaper, and the porter was\r\ngardening on the slope of the embankment.\r\n\r\n"Is the train at eleven in the morning an up-train or a down-train?"\r\nasked Mr. Orridge, addressing the porter.\r\n\r\n"A down-train."\r\n\r\n"Did many people go by it?"\r\n\r\nThe porter repeated the names of some of the inhabitants of West\r\nWinston.\r\n\r\n"Were there no passengers but passengers from the town?" inquired the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir. I think there was one stranger--a lady."\r\n\r\n"Did the station-master issue the tickets for that train?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir."\r\n\r\nMr. Orridge went on to the station-master.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember giving a ticket this morning, by the eleven o\'clock\r\ndown-train, to a lady traveling alone?"\r\n\r\nThe station-master pondered. "I have issued tickets, up and down, to\r\nhalf-a-dozen ladies to-day," he answered, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I am speaking only of the eleven o\'clock train," said Mr.\r\nOrridge. "Try if you can\'t remember?"\r\n\r\n"Remember? Stop! I do remember; I know who you mean. A lady who seemed\r\nrather flurried, and who put a question to me that I am not often\r\nasked at this station. She had her veil down, I recollect, and she got\r\nhere for the eleven o\'clock train. Crouch, the carrier, brought her\r\ntrunk into the office."\r\n\r\n"That is the woman. Where did she take her ticket for?"\r\n\r\n"For Exeter."\r\n\r\n"You said she asked you a question?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: a question about what coaches met the rail at Exeter to take\r\ntravelers into Cornwall. I told her we were rather too far off here to\r\nhave the correct time-table, and recommended her to apply for\r\ninformation to the Devonshire people when she got to the end of her\r\njourney. She seemed a timid, helpless kind of woman to travel alone.\r\nAny thing wrong in connection with her, Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! nothing," said Mr. Orridge, leaving the station-master and\r\nhastening back to his gig again.\r\n\r\nWhen he drew up, a few minutes afterward, at the door of the Tiger\'s\r\nHead, he jumped out of his vehicle with the confident air of a man who\r\nhas done all that could be expected of him. It was easy to face Mrs.\r\nFrankland with the unsatisfactory news of Mrs. Jazeph\'s departure, now\r\nthat he could add, on the best authority, the important supplementary\r\ninformation that she had gone to Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA PLOT AGAINST THE SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the close of the evening, on the day after Mr. Orridge\'s\r\ninterview with Mrs. Norbury, the Druid fast coach, running through\r\nCornwall as far as Truro, set down three inside passengers at the door\r\nof the booking-office on arriving at its destination. Two of these\r\npassengers were an old gentleman and his daughter; the third was Mrs.\r\nJazeph.\r\n\r\nThe father and daughter collected their luggage and entered the hotel;\r\nthe outside passengers branched off in different directions with as\r\nlittle delay as possible; Mrs. Jazeph alone stood irresolute on the\r\npavement, and seemed uncertain what she should do next. When the\r\ncoachman good-naturedly endeavored to assist her in arriving at a\r\ndecision of some kind, by asking whether he could do any thing to help\r\nher, she started, and looked at him suspiciously; then, appearing to\r\nrecollect herself, thanked him for his kindness, and inquired, with a\r\nconfusion of words and a hesitation of manner which appeared very\r\nextraordinary in the coachman\'s eyes, whether she might be allowed to\r\nleave her trunk at the booking-office for a little while, until she\r\ncould return and call for it again.\r\n\r\nReceiving permission to leave her trunk as long as she pleased, she\r\ncrossed over the principal street of the town, ascended the pavement\r\non the opposite side, and walked down the first turning she came to.\r\nOn entering the by-street to which the turning led, she glanced back,\r\nsatisfied herself that nobody was following or watching her, hastened\r\non a few yards, and stopped again at a small shop devoted to the sale\r\nof book-cases, cabinets, work-boxes, and writing-desks. After first\r\nlooking up at the letters painted over the door--BUSCHMANN,\r\nCABINET-MAKER, &C.--she peered in at the shop window. A middle-aged\r\nman, with a cheerful face, sat behind the counter, polishing a\r\nrosewood bracket, and nodding briskly at regular intervals, as if he\r\nwere humming a tune and keeping time to it with his head. Seeing no\r\ncustomers in the shop, Mrs. Jazeph opened the door and walked in.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was inside, she became aware that the cheerful man\r\nbehind the counter was keeping time, not to a tune of his own humming,\r\nbut to a tune played by a musical box. The clear ringing notes came\r\nfrom a parlor behind the shop, and the air the box was playing was the\r\nlovely "Batti, Batti," of Mozart.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Buschmann at home?" asked Mrs. Jazeph.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said the cheerful man, pointing with a smile toward the\r\ndoor that led into the parlor. "The music answers for him. Whenever\r\nMr. Buschmann\'s box is playing, Mr. Buschmann himself is not far off\r\nfrom it. Did you wish to see him, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"If there is nobody with him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, he is quite alone. Shall I give any name?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph opened her lips to answer, hesitated, and said nothing.\r\nThe shopman, with a quicker delicacy of perception than might have\r\nbeen expected from him, judging by outward appearances, did not repeat\r\nthe question, but opened the door at once, and admitted the visitor to\r\nthe presence of Mr. Buschmann.\r\n\r\nThe shop parlor was a very small room, with an old three-cornered look\r\nabout it, with a bright green paper on the walls, with a large dried\r\nfish in a glass case over the fire-place, with two meerschaum pipes\r\nhanging together on the wall opposite, and a neat round table placed\r\nas accurately as possible in the middle of the floor. On the table\r\nwere tea-things, bread, butter, a pot of jam, and a musical box in a\r\nquaint, old-fashioned case; and by the side of the table sat a little,\r\nrosy-faced, white-haired, simple-looking old man, who started up, when\r\nthe door was opened, with an appearance of extreme confusion, and\r\ntouched the top of the musical box so that it might cease playing when\r\nit came to the end of the air.\r\n\r\n"A lady to speak with you, Sir," said the cheerful shopman. "That is\r\nMr. Buschmann, ma\'am," he added in a lower tone, seeing Mrs. Jazeph\r\nstop in apparent uncertainty on entering the parlor.\r\n\r\n"Will you please to take a seat, ma\'am?" said Mr. Buschmann, when the\r\nshopman had closed the door and gone back to his counter. "Excuse the\r\nmusic; it will stop directly." He spoke these words in a foreign\r\naccent, but with perfect fluency.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jazeph looked at him earnestly while he was addressing her, and\r\nadvanced a step or two before she said any thing. "Am I so changed?"\r\nshe asked softly. "So sadly, sadly changed, Uncle Joseph?"\r\n\r\n"Gott im Himmel! it\'s her voice--it\'s Sarah Leeson!" cried the old\r\nman, running up to his visitor as nimbly as if he was a boy again,\r\ntaking both her hands, and kissing her with an odd, brisk tenderness\r\non the cheek. Although his niece was not at all above the average\r\nheight of women, Uncle Joseph was so short that he had to raise\r\nhimself on tiptoe to perform the ceremony of embracing her.\r\n\r\n"To think of Sarah coming at last!" he said, pressing her into a\r\nchair. "After all these years and years, to think of Sarah Leeson\r\ncoming to see Uncle Joseph again!"\r\n\r\n"Sarah still, but not Sarah Leeson," said Mrs. Jazeph, pressing her\r\nthin, trembling hands firmly together, and looking down on the floor\r\nwhile she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Ah! married?" said Mr. Buschmann, gayly. "Married, of course. Tell me\r\nall about your husband, Sarah."\r\n\r\n"He is dead. Dead and forgiven." She murmured the last three words in\r\na whisper to herself.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I am so sorry for you! I spoke too suddenly, did I not, my\r\nchild?" said the old man. "Never mind! No, no; I don\'t mean that--I\r\nmean let us talk of something else. You will have a bit of bread and\r\njam, won\'t you, Sarah?--ravishing raspberry jam that melts in your\r\nmouth. Some tea, then? So, so, she will have some tea, to be sure. And\r\nwe won\'t talk of our troubles--at least, not just yet. You look very\r\npale, Sarah--very much older than you ought to look--no, I don\'t mean\r\nthat either; I don\'t mean to be rude. It was your voice I knew you by,\r\nmy child--your voice that your poor Uncle Max always said would have\r\nmade your fortune if you would only have learned to sing. Here\'s his\r\npretty music box going still. Don\'t look so downhearted--don\'t, pray.\r\nDo listen a little to the music: you remember the box?--my brother\r\nMax\'s box? Why, how you look! Have you forgotten the box that the\r\ndivine Mozart gave to my brother with his own hand, when Max was a\r\nboy in the music school at Vienna? Listen! I have set it going again.\r\nIt\'s a song they call \'Batti, Batti;\' it\'s a song in an opera of\r\nMozart\'s. Ah! beautiful! beautiful! Your Uncle Max said that all music\r\nwas comprehended in that one song. I know nothing about music, but I\r\nhave my heart and my ears, and they tell me that Max was right."\r\n\r\nSpeaking these words with abundant gesticulation and amazing\r\nvolubility, Mr. Buschmann poured out a cup of tea for his niece,\r\nstirred it carefully, and, patting her on the shoulder, begged that\r\nshe would make him happy by drinking it all up directly. As he came\r\nclose to her to press this request, he discovered that the tears were\r\nin her eyes, and that she was trying to take her handkerchief from her\r\npocket without being observed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind me," she said, seeing the old man\'s face sadden as he\r\nlooked at her; "and don\'t think me forgetful or ungrateful, Uncle\r\nJoseph. I remember the box--I remember every thing that you used to\r\ntake an interest in, when I was younger and happier than I am now.\r\nWhen I last saw you, I came to you in trouble; and I come to you in\r\ntrouble once more. It seems neglectful in me never to have written to\r\nyou for so many years past; but my life has been a very sad one, and I\r\nthought I had no right to lay the burden of my sorrow on other\r\nshoulders than my own."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph shook his head at these last words, and touched the stop\r\nof the musical box. "Mozart shall wait a little," he said, gravely,\r\n"till I have told you something. Sarah, hear what I say, and drink\r\nyour tea, and own to me whether I speak the truth or not. What did I,\r\nJoseph Buschmann, tell you, when you first came to me in trouble,\r\nfourteen, fifteen, ah more! sixteen years ago, in this town, and in\r\nthis same house? I said then, what I say again now: \'Sarah\'s sorrow is\r\nmy sorrow, and Sarah\'s joy is my joy;\' and if any man asks me reasons\r\nfor that, I have three to give him."\r\n\r\nHe stopped to stir up his niece\'s tea for the second time, and to draw\r\nher attention to it by tapping with the spoon on the edge of the cup.\r\n\r\n"Three reasons," he resumed. "First, you are my sister\'s child--some\r\nof her flesh and blood, and some of mine, therefore, also. Second, my\r\nsister, my brother, and lastly me myself, we owe to your good English\r\nfather--all. A little word that means much, and may be said again and\r\nagain--all. Your father\'s friends cry, Fie! Agatha Buschmann is poor!\r\nAgatha Buschmann is foreign! But your father loves the poor German\r\ngirl, and he marries her in spite of their Fie, Fie. Your father\'s\r\nfriends cry Fie! again; Agatha Buschmann has a musician brother, who\r\ngabbles to us about Mozart, and who can not make to his porridge salt.\r\nYour father says, Good! I like his gabble; I like his playing; I shall\r\nget him people to teach; and while I have pinches of salt in my\r\nkitchen, he to his porridge shall have pinches of salt too. Your\r\nfather\'s friends cry Fie! for the third time. Agatha Buschmann has\r\nanother brother, a little Stupid-Head, who to the other\'s gabble can\r\nonly listen and say Amen. Send him trotting; for the love of Heaven,\r\nshut up all the doors and send Stupid-Head trotting, at least. Your\r\nfather says, No! Stupid-Head has his wits in his hands; he can cut and\r\ncarve and polish; help him a little at the starting, and after he\r\nshall help himself. They are all gone now but me! Your father, your\r\nmother, and Uncle Max--they are all gone. Stupid-Head alone remains to\r\nremember and to be grateful--to take Sarah\'s sorrow for his sorrow,\r\nand Sarah\'s joy for his joy."\r\n\r\nHe stopped again to blow a speck of dust off the musical box. His\r\nniece endeavored to speak, but he held up his hand, and shook his\r\nforefinger at her warningly.\r\n\r\n"No," he said. "It is yet my business to talk, and your business to\r\ndrink tea. Have I not my third reason still? Ah! you look away from\r\nme; you know my third reason before I say a word. When I, in my turn,\r\nmarry, and my wife dies, and leaves me alone with little Joseph, and\r\nwhen the boy falls sick, who comes then, so quiet, so pretty, so neat,\r\nwith the bright young eyes, and the hands so tender and light? Who\r\nhelps me with little Joseph by night and by day? Who makes a pillow\r\nfor him on her arm when his head is weary? Who holds this box\r\npatiently at his ear?--yes! this box, that the hand of Mozart has\r\ntouched--who holds it closer, closer always, when little Joseph\'s\r\nsense grows dull, and he moans for the friendly music that he has\r\nknown from a baby, the friendly music that he can now so hardly,\r\nhardly hear? Who kneels down by Uncle Joseph when his heart is\r\nbreaking, and says, \'Oh, hush! hush! The boy is gone where the better\r\nmusic plays, where the sickness shall never waste or the sorrow touch\r\nhim more?\' Who? Ah, Sarah! you can not forget those days; you can not\r\nforget the Long Ago! When the trouble is bitter, and the burden is\r\nheavy, it is cruelty to Uncle Joseph to keep away; it is kindness to\r\nhim to come here."\r\n\r\nThe recollections that the old man had called up found their way\r\ntenderly to Sarah\'s heart. She could not answer him; she could only\r\nhold out her hand. Uncle Joseph bent down, with a quaint, affectionate\r\ngallantry, and kissed it; then stepped back again to his place by the\r\nmusical box. "Come!" he said, patting it cheerfully, "we will say no\r\nmore for a while. Mozart\'s box, Max\'s box, little Joseph\'s box, you\r\nshall talk to us again!"\r\n\r\nHaving put the tiny machinery in motion, he sat down by the table, and\r\nremained silent until the air had been played over twice. Then\r\nobserving that his niece seemed calmer, he spoke to her once more.\r\n\r\n"You are in trouble, Sarah," he said, quietly. "You tell me that, and\r\nI see it is true in your face. Are you grieving for your husband?"\r\n\r\n"I grieve that I ever met him," she answered. "I grieve that I ever\r\nmarried him. Now that he is dead, I can not grieve--I can only forgive\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Forgive him? How you look, Sarah, when you say that! Tell me--"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Joseph! I have told you that my husband is dead, and that I\r\nhave forgiven him."\r\n\r\n"You have forgiven him? He was hard and cruel with you, then? I see; I\r\nsee. That is the end, Sarah--but the beginning? Is the beginning that\r\nyou loved him?"\r\n\r\nHer pale cheeks flushed; and she turned her head aside. "It is hard\r\nand humbling to confess it," she murmured, without raising her eyes;\r\n"but you force the truth from me, uncle. I had no love to give to my\r\nhusband--no love to give to any man."\r\n\r\n"And yet you married him! Wait! it is not for me to blame. It is for\r\nme to find out, not the bad, but the good. Yes, yes; I shall say to\r\nmyself, she married him when she was poor and helpless; she married\r\nhim when she should have come to Uncle Joseph instead. I shall say\r\nthat to myself, and I shall pity, but I shall ask no more."\r\n\r\nSarah half reached her hand out to the old man again--then suddenly\r\npushed her chair back, and changed the position in which she was\r\nsitting. "It is true that I was poor," she said, looking about her in\r\nconfusion, and speaking with difficulty. "But you are so kind and so\r\ngood, I can not accept the excuse that your forbearance makes for me.\r\nI did not marry him because I was poor, but--" She stopped, clasped\r\nher hands together, and pushed her chair back still farther from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"So! so!" said the old man, noticing her confusion. "We will talk\r\nabout it no more."\r\n\r\n"I had no excuse of love; I had no excuse of poverty," she said, with\r\na sudden burst of bitterness and despair. "Uncle Joseph, I married him\r\nbecause I was too weak to persist in saying No! The curse of weakness\r\nand fear has followed me all the days of my life! I said No to him\r\nonce. I said No to him twice. Oh, uncle, if I could only have said it\r\nfor the third time! But he followed me, he frightened me, he took away\r\nfrom me all the little will of my own that I had. He made me speak as\r\nhe wished me to speak, and go where he wished me to go. No, no,\r\nno--don\'t come to me, uncle; don\'t say any thing. He is gone; he is\r\ndead--I have got my release; I have given my pardon! Oh, if I could\r\nonly go away and hide somewhere! All people\'s eyes seem to look\r\nthrough me; all people\'s words seem to threaten me. My heart has been\r\nweary ever since I was a young woman; and all these long, long years\r\nit has never got any rest. Hush! the man in the shop--I forgot the man\r\nin the shop. He will hear us; let us talk in a whisper. What made me\r\nbreak out so? I\'m always wrong. Oh me! I\'m wrong when I speak; I\'m\r\nwrong when I say nothing; wherever I go and whatever I do, I\'m not\r\nlike other people. I seem never to have grown up in my mind since I\r\nwas a little child. Hark! the man in the shop is moving--has he heard\r\nme? Oh, Uncle Joseph! do you think he has heard me?"\r\n\r\nLooking hardly less startled than his niece, Uncle Joseph assured her\r\nthat the door was solid, that the man\'s place in the shop was at some\r\ndistance from it, and that it was impossible, even if he heard voices\r\nin the parlor, that he could also distinguish any words that were\r\nspoken in it.\r\n\r\n"You are sure of that?" she whispered, hurriedly. "Yes, yes, you are\r\nsure of that, or you would not have told me so, would you? We may go\r\non talking now. Not about my married life: that is buried and past.\r\nSay that I had some years of sorrow and suffering, which I\r\ndeserved--say that I had other years of quiet, when I was living in\r\nservice with masters and mistresses who were often kind to me when my\r\nfellow-servants were not--say just that much about my life, and it is\r\nsaying enough. The trouble that I am in now, the trouble that brings\r\nme to you, goes back further than the years we have been talking\r\nabout--goes back, back, back, Uncle Joseph, to the distant day when we\r\nlast met."\r\n\r\n"Goes back all through the sixteen years!" exclaimed the old man,\r\nincredulously. "Goes back, Sarah, even to the Long Ago!"\r\n\r\n"Even to that time. Uncle, you remember where I was living, and what\r\nhad happened to me, when--"\r\n\r\n"When you came here in secret? When you asked me to hide you? That was\r\nthe same week, Sarah, when your mistress died; your mistress who lived\r\naway west in the old house. You were frightened, then--pale and\r\nfrightened as I see you now."\r\n\r\n"As every one sees me! People are always staring at me; always\r\nthinking that I am nervous, always pitying me for being ill."\r\n\r\nSaying these words with a sudden fretfulness, she lifted the tea-cup\r\nby her side to her lips, drained it of its contents at a draught, and\r\npushed it across the table to be filled again. "I have come all over\r\nthirsty and hot," she whispered. "More tea, Uncle Joseph--more tea."\r\n\r\n"It is cold," said the old man. "Wait till I ask for hot water."\r\n\r\n"No!" she exclaimed, stopping him as he was about to rise. "Give it me\r\ncold; I like it cold. Let nobody else come in--I can\'t speak if any\r\nbody else comes in." She drew her chair close to her uncle\'s, and went\r\non: "You have not forgotten how frightened I was in that by-gone\r\ntime--do you remember why I was frightened?"\r\n\r\n"You were afraid of being followed--that was it, Sarah. I grow old,\r\nbut my memory keeps young. You were afraid of your master, afraid of\r\nhis sending servants after you. You had run away; you had spoken no\r\nword to any body; and you spoke little--ah, very, very little--even to\r\nUncle Joseph--even to me."\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Sarah, dropping her voice to so faint a whisper\r\nthat the old man could barely hear her--"I told you that my mistress\r\nhad left me a Secret on her death-bed--a Secret in a letter, which I\r\nwas to give to my master. I told you I had hidden the letter, because\r\nI could not bring myself to deliver it, because I would rather die a\r\nthousand times over than be questioned about what I knew of it. I told\r\nyou so much, I know. Did I tell you no more? Did I not say that my\r\nmistress made me take an oath on the Bible?--Uncle! are there candles\r\nin the room? Are there candles we can light without disturbing any\r\nbody, without calling any body in here?"\r\n\r\n"There are candles and a match-box in my cupboard," answered Uncle\r\nJoseph. "But look out of window, Sarah. It is only twilight--it is not\r\ndark yet."\r\n\r\n"Not outside; but it is dark here."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"In that corner. Let us have candles. I don\'t like the darkness when\r\nit gathers in corners and creeps along walls."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph looked all round the room inquiringly; and smiled to\r\nhimself as he took two candles from the cupboard and lighted them.\r\n"You are like the children," he said, playfully, while he pulled down\r\nthe window-blind. "You are afraid of the dark."\r\n\r\nSarah did not appear to hear him. Her eyes were fixed on the corner of\r\nthe room which she had pointed out the moment before. When he resumed\r\nhis place by her side, she never looked round, but laid her hand on\r\nhis arm, and said to him suddenly--\r\n\r\n"Uncle! Do you believe that the dead can come back to this world, and\r\nfollow the living every where, and see what they do in it?"\r\n\r\nThe old man started. "Sarah!" he said, "why do you talk so? Why do you\r\nask me such a question?"\r\n\r\n"Are there lonely hours," she went on, still never looking away from\r\nthe corner, still not seeming to hear him, "when you are sometimes\r\nfrightened without knowing why--frightened all over in an instant,\r\nfrom head to foot? Tell me, uncle, have you ever felt the cold steal\r\nround and round the roots of your hair, and crawl bit by bit down your\r\nback? I have felt that even in the summer. I have been out of doors,\r\nalone on a wide heath, in the heat and brightness of noon, and have\r\nfelt as if chilly fingers were touching me--chilly, damp, softly\r\ncreeping fingers. It says in the New Testament that the dead came once\r\nout of their graves, and went into the holy city. The dead! Have they\r\nrested, rested always, rested forever, since that time?"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph\'s simple nature recoiled in bewilderment from the dark\r\nand daring speculations to which his niece\'s questions led. Without\r\nsaying a word, he tried to draw away the arm which she still held; but\r\nthe only result of the effort was to make her tighten her grasp, and\r\nbend forward in her chair so as to look closer still into the corner\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n"My mistress was dying," she said--"my mistress was very near her\r\ngrave, when she made me take my oath on the Bible. She made me swear\r\nnever to destroy the letter; and I did not destroy it. She made me\r\nswear not to take it away with me, if I left the house; and I did not\r\ntake it away. She would have made me swear, for the third time, to\r\ngive it to my master, but death was too quick for her--death stopped\r\nher from fastening that third oath on my conscience. But she\r\nthreatened me, uncle, with the dead dampness on her forehead, and the\r\ndead whiteness on her cheeks--she threatened to come to me from the\r\nother world if I thwarted her--and I _have_ thwarted her!"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, suddenly removed her hand from the old man\'s arm, and\r\nmade a strange gesture with it toward the part of the room on which\r\nher eyes remained fixed. "Rest, mistress, rest," she whispered under\r\nher breath. "Is my master alive now? Rest, till the drowned rise. Tell\r\nhim the Secret when the sea gives up her dead."\r\n\r\n"Sarah! Sarah! you are changed--you are ill--you frighten me!" cried\r\nUncle Joseph, starting to his feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: "WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, HE TRIED TO DRAW AWAY THE ARM\r\n   SHE STILL HELD."]\r\n\r\nShe turned round slowly, and looked at him with eyes void of all\r\nexpression, with eyes that seemed to be staring through him vacantly\r\nat something beyond.\r\n\r\n"Gott im Himmel! what does she see?" He looked round as the\r\nexclamation escaped him. "Sarah! what is it! Are you faint? Are you\r\nill? Are you dreaming with your eyes open?"\r\n\r\nHe took her by both arms and shook her. At the instant when she felt\r\nthe touch of his hands, she started violently and trembled all over.\r\nTheir natural expression flew back into her eyes with the rapidity of\r\na flash of light. Without saying a word, she hastily resumed her seat\r\nand began stirring the cold tea round and round in her cup, round and\r\nround so fast that the liquid overflowed into the saucer.\r\n\r\n"Come! she gets more like herself," said Uncle Joseph, watching her.\r\n\r\n"More like myself?" she repeated, vacantly.\r\n\r\n"So! so!" said the old man, trying to soothe her. "You are ill--what\r\nthe English call out of sort. They are good doctors here. Wait till\r\nto-morrow, you shall have the best."\r\n\r\n"I want no doctors. Don\'t speak of doctors. I can\'t bear them; they\r\nlook at me with such curious eyes; they are always prying into me, as\r\nif they wanted to find out something. What have we been stopping for?\r\nI had so much to say; and we seem to have been stopping just when we\r\nought to have been going on. I am in grief and terror, Uncle Joseph;\r\nin grief and terror again about the Secret--"\r\n\r\n"No more of that!" pleaded the old man. "No more to-night at least!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because you will be ill again with talking about it. You will be\r\nlooking into that corner, and dreaming with your eyes open. You are\r\ntoo ill--yes, yes, Sarah; you are too ill."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not ill! Oh, why does every body keep telling me that I am ill?\r\nLet me talk about it, uncle. I have come to talk about it; I can\'t\r\nrest till I have told you."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a changing color and an embarrassed manner, now\r\napparently conscious for the first time that she had allowed words and\r\nactions to escape her which it would have been more prudent to have\r\nrestrained.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t notice me again," she said, with her soft voice, and her\r\ngentle, pleading manner. "Don\'t notice me if I talk or look as I\r\nought not. I lose myself sometimes, without knowing it; and I suppose\r\nI lost myself just now. It means nothing, Uncle Joseph--nothing,\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\nEndeavoring thus to re-assure the old man, she again altered the\r\nposition of her chair, so as to place her back toward the part of the\r\nroom to which her face had been hitherto turned.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, it is good to hear that," said Uncle Joseph; "but speak\r\nno more about the past time, for fear you should lose yourself again.\r\nLet us hear about what is now. Yes, yes, give me my way. Leave the\r\nLong Ago to me, and take you the present time. I can go back through\r\nthe sixteen years as well as you. Ah! you doubt it? Hear me tell you\r\nwhat happened when we last met--hear me prove myself in three words:\r\nYou leave your place at the old house--you run away here--you stop in\r\nhiding with me, while your master and his servants are hunting after\r\nyou--you start off, when your road is clear, to work for your living,\r\nas far away from Cornwall as you can get--I beg and pray you to stop\r\nwith me, but you are afraid of your master, and away you go. There!\r\nthat is the whole story of your trouble the last time you came to this\r\nhouse. Leave it so; and tell me what is the cause of your trouble\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"The past cause of my trouble, Uncle Joseph, and the present cause of\r\nmy trouble are the same. The Secret--"\r\n\r\n"What! you will go back to that!"\r\n\r\n"I must go back to it."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Because the Secret is written in a letter--"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and what of that?"\r\n\r\n"And the letter is in danger of being discovered. It is, uncle--it is!\r\nSixteen years it has lain hidden--and now, after all that long time,\r\nthe dreadful chance of its being dragged to light has come like a\r\njudgment. The one person in all the world who ought never to set eyes\r\non that letter is the very person who is most likely to find it!"\r\n\r\n"So! so! Are you very certain, Sarah? How do you know it?"\r\n\r\n"I know it from her own lips. Chance brought us together--"\r\n\r\n"Us? us? What do you mean by us?"\r\n\r\n"I mean--uncle, you remember that Captain Treverton was my master when\r\nI lived at Porthgenna Tower?"\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten his name. But no matter--go on."\r\n\r\n"When I left my place, Miss Treverton was a little girl of five years\r\nold. She is a married woman now--so beautiful, so clever, such a\r\nsweet, youthful, happy face! And she has a child as lovely as herself.\r\nOh, uncle, if you could see her! I would give so much if you could\r\nonly see her!"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph kissed his hand and shrugged his shoulders; expressing by\r\nthe first action homage to the lady\'s beauty, and by the second\r\nresignation under the misfortune of not being able to see her. "Well,\r\nwell," he said, philosophically, "put this shining woman by, and let\r\nus go on."\r\n\r\n"Her name is Frankland now," said Sarah. "A prettier name than\r\nTreverton--a much prettier name, I think. Her husband is fond of\r\nher--I am sure he is. How can he have any heart at all, and not be\r\nfond of her?"\r\n\r\n"So! so!" exclaimed Uncle Joseph, looking very much perplexed. "Good,\r\nif he is fond of her--very good. But what labyrinth are we getting\r\ninto now? Wherefore all this about a husband and a wife? My word of\r\nhonor, Sarah, but your explanation explains nothing--it only softens\r\nmy brains."\r\n\r\n"I must speak of her and of Mr. Frankland, uncle. Porthgenna Tower\r\nbelongs to her husband now, and they are both going to live there."\r\n\r\n"Ah! we are getting back into the straight road at last."\r\n\r\n"They are going to live in the very house that holds the Secret; they\r\nare going to repair that very part of it where the letter is hidden.\r\nShe will go into the old rooms--I heard her say so; she will search\r\nabout in them to amuse her curiosity; workmen will clear them out, and\r\nshe will stand by in her idle hours, looking on."\r\n\r\n"But she suspects nothing of the Secret?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid she ever should!"\r\n\r\n"And there are many rooms in the house? And the letter in which the\r\nSecret is written is hidden in one of the many? Why should she hit on\r\nthat one?"\r\n\r\n"Because I always say the wrong thing! because I always get frightened\r\nand lose myself at the wrong time! The letter is hidden in a room\r\ncalled the Myrtle Room, and I was foolish enough, weak enough, crazed\r\nenough, to warn her against going into it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Sarah! Sarah! that was a mistake, indeed."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell what possessed me--I seemed to lose my senses when I\r\nheard her talking so innocently of amusing herself by searching\r\nthrough the old rooms, and when I thought of what she might find\r\nthere. It was getting on toward night, too; the horrible twilight was\r\ngathering in the corners and creeping along the walls. I longed to\r\nlight the candles, and yet I did not dare, for fear she should see the\r\ntruth in my face. And when I did light them it was worse. Oh, I don\'t\r\nknow how I did it! I don\'t know why I did it! I could have torn my\r\ntongue out for saying the words, and still I said them. Other people\r\ncan think for the best; other people can act for the best; other\r\npeople have had a heavy weight laid on their minds, and have not\r\ndropped under it as I have. Help me, uncle, for the sake of old times\r\nwhen we were happy--help me with a word of advice."\r\n\r\n"I will help you; I live to help you, Sarah! No, no, no--you must not\r\nlook so forlorn; you must not look at me with those crying eyes. Come!\r\nI will advise this minute--but say in what; only say in what."\r\n\r\n"Have I not told you?"\r\n\r\n"No; you have not told me a word yet."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you now."\r\n\r\nShe paused, looked away distrustfully toward the door leading into the\r\nshop, listened a little, and resumed: "I am not at the end of my\r\njourney yet, Uncle Joseph--I am here on my way to Porthgenna Tower--on\r\nmy way to the Myrtle Room--on my way, step by step, to the place where\r\nthe letter lies hid. I dare not destroy it; I dare not remove it; but\r\nrun what risk I may, I must take it out of the Myrtle Room."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph said nothing, but he shook his head despondingly.\r\n\r\n"I must," she repeated; "before Mrs. Frankland gets to Porthgenna, I\r\nmust take that letter out of the Myrtle Room. There are places in the\r\nold house where I may hide it again--places that she would never think\r\nof--places that she would never notice. Only let me get it out of the\r\none room that she is sure to search in, and I know where to hide it\r\nfrom her and from every one forever."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph reflected, and shook his head again--then said: "One\r\nword, Sarah; does Mrs. Frankland know which is the Myrtle Room?"\r\n\r\n"I did my best to destroy all trace of that name when I hid the\r\nletter; I hope and believe she does not. But she may find\r\nout--remember the words I was crazed enough to speak; they will set\r\nher seeking for the Myrtle Room; they are sure to do that."\r\n\r\n"And if she finds it? And if she finds the letter?"\r\n\r\n"It will cause misery to innocent people; it will bring death to _me_.\r\nDon\'t push your chair from me, uncle! It is not shameful death I speak\r\nof. The worst injury I have done is injury to myself; the worst death\r\nI have to fear is the death that releases a worn-out spirit and cures\r\na broken heart."\r\n\r\n"Enough--enough so," said the old man. "I ask for no secret, Sarah,\r\nthat is not yours to give. It is all dark to me--very dark, very\r\nconfused. I look away from it; I look only toward you. Not with doubt,\r\nmy child, but with pity, and with sorrow, too--sorrow that ever you\r\nwent near that house of Porthgenna--sorrow that you are now going to\r\nit again."\r\n\r\n"I have no choice, uncle, but to go. If every step on the road to\r\nPorthgenna took me nearer and nearer to my death, I must still tread\r\nit. Knowing what I know, I can\'t rest, I can\'t sleep--my very breath\r\nwon\'t come freely--till I have got that letter out of the Myrtle Room.\r\nHow to do it--oh, Uncle Joseph, how to do it, without being suspected,\r\nwithout being discovered by any body--that is what I would almost give\r\nmy life to know! You are a man; you are older and wiser than I am; no\r\nliving creature ever asked you for help in vain--help _me_ now! my\r\nonly friend in all the world, help me a little with a word of advice!"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph rose from his chair, and folded his arms resolutely, and\r\nlooked his niece full in the face.\r\n\r\n"You will go?" he said. "Cost what it may, you will go? Say, for the\r\nlast time, Sarah, is it yes or no?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! For the last time, I say Yes."\r\n\r\n"Good. And you will go soon?"\r\n\r\n"I must go to-morrow. I dare not waste a single day; hours even may be\r\nprecious for any thing I can tell."\r\n\r\n"You promise me, my child, that the hiding of this Secret does good,\r\nand that the finding of it will do harm?"\r\n\r\n"If it was the last word I had to speak in this world, I would say\r\nYes!"\r\n\r\n"You promise me, also, that you want nothing but to take the letter\r\nout of the Myrtle Room, and put it away somewhere else?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but that."\r\n\r\n"And it is yours to take and yours to put? No person has a better\r\nright to touch it than you?"\r\n\r\n"Now that my master is dead, no person."\r\n\r\n"Good. You have given me my resolution. I have done. Sit you there,\r\nSarah; and wonder, if you like, but say nothing." With these words,\r\nUncle Joseph stepped lightly to the door leading into the shop, opened\r\nit, and called to the man behind the counter.\r\n\r\n"Samuel, my friend," he said. "To-morrow I go a little ways into the\r\ncountry with my niece, who is this lady here. You keep shop and take\r\norders, and be just as careful as you always are, till I get back. If\r\nany body comes and asks for Mr. Buschmann, say he has gone a little\r\nways into the country, and will be back in a few days. That is all.\r\nShut up the shop, Samuel, my friend, for the night; and go to your\r\nsupper. I wish you good appetite, nice victuals, and sound sleep."\r\n\r\nBefore Samuel could thank his master, the door was shut again. Before\r\nSarah could say a word, Uncle Joseph\'s hand was on her lips, and Uncle\r\nJoseph\'s handkerchief was wiping away the tears that were now falling\r\nfast from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I will have no more talking, and no more crying," said the old man.\r\n"I am a German, and I glory in the obstinacy of six Englishmen, all\r\nrolled into one. To-night you sleep here, to-morrow we talk again of\r\nall this. You want me to help you with a word of advice. I will help\r\nyou with myself, which is better than advice, and I say no more till I\r\nfetch my pipe down from the wall there, and ask him to make me think.\r\nI smoke and think to-night--I talk and do to-morrow. And you, you go\r\nup to bed; you take Uncle Max\'s music box in your hand, and you let\r\nMozart sing the cradle song before you go to sleep. Yes, yes, my\r\nchild, there is always comfort in Mozart--better comfort than in\r\ncrying. What is there to cry about, or to thank about? Is it so great\r\na wonder that I will not let my sister\'s child go alone to make a\r\nventure in the dark? I said Sarah\'s sorrow was my sorrow, and Sarah\'s\r\njoy my joy; and now, if there is no way of escape--if it must indeed\r\nbe done--I also say: Sarah\'s risk to-morrow is Uncle Joseph\'s risk\r\nto-morrow, too! Good-night, my child--good-night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning wrought no change in the resolution at which Uncle\r\nJoseph had arrived overnight. Out of the amazement and confusion\r\nproduced in his mind by his niece\'s avowal of the object that had\r\nbrought her to Cornwall, he had contrived to extract one clear and\r\ndefinite conclusion--that she was obstinately bent on placing herself\r\nin a situation of uncertainty, if not of absolute peril. Once\r\npersuaded of this, his kindly instincts all sprang into action, his\r\nnatural firmness on the side of self sacrifice asserted itself, and\r\nhis determination not to let Sarah proceed on her journey alone,\r\nfollowed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nStrong in the self-denying generosity of his purpose--though strong in\r\nnothing else--when he and his niece met in the morning, and when Sarah\r\nspoke self-reproachfully of the sacrifice that he was making, of the\r\nserious hazards to which he was exposing himself for her sake, he\r\nrefused to listen to her just as obstinately as he had refused the\r\nprevious night. There was no need, he said, to speak another word on\r\nthat subject. If she had abandoned her intention of going to\r\nPorthgenna, she had only to say so. If she had not, it was mere waste\r\nof breath to talk any more, for he was deaf in both ears to every\r\nthing in the shape of a remonstrance that she could possibly address\r\nto him. Having expressed himself in these uncompromising terms, Uncle\r\nJoseph abruptly dismissed the subject, and tried to turn the\r\nconversation to a cheerful every-day topic by asking his niece how she\r\nhad passed the night.\r\n\r\n"I was too anxious to sleep," she answered. "I can\'t fight with my\r\nfears and misgivings as some people can. All night long they keep me\r\nwaking and thinking as if it was day."\r\n\r\n"Thinking about what?" asked Uncle Joseph. "About the letter that is\r\nhidden? about the house of Porthgenna? about the Myrtle Room?"\r\n\r\n"About how to get into the Myrtle Room," she said. "The more I try to\r\nplan and ponder, and settle beforehand what I shall do, the more\r\nconfused and helpless I seem to be. All last night, uncle, I was\r\ntrying to think of some excuse for getting inside the doors of\r\nPorthgenna Tower--and yet, if I was standing on the house-step at this\r\nmoment, I should not know what to say when the servant and I first\r\ncame face to face. How are we to persuade them to let us in? How am I\r\nto slip out of sight, even if we do get in? Can\'t you tell me?--you\r\nwill try, Uncle Joseph--I am sure you will try. Only help me so far,\r\nand I think I can answer for the rest. If they keep the keys where\r\nthey used to keep them in my time, ten minutes to myself is all I\r\nshould want--ten minutes, only ten short minutes, to make the end of\r\nmy life easier to me than the beginning has been; to help me to grow\r\nold quietly and resignedly, if it is God\'s will that I should live out\r\nmy years. Oh, how happy people must be who have all the courage they\r\nwant; who are quick and clever, and have their wits about them! You\r\nare readier than I am, uncle; you said last night that you would think\r\nabout how to advise me for the best--what did your thoughts end in?\r\nYou will make me so much easier if you will only tell me that."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph nodded assentingly, assumed a look of the profoundest\r\ngravity, and slowly laid his forefinger along the side of his nose.\r\n\r\n"What did I promise you last night?" he said. "Was it not to take my\r\npipe, and ask him to make me think? Good, I smoke three pipes, and\r\nthink three thoughts. My first thought is--Wait! My second thought is\r\nagain--Wait! My third thought is yet once more--Wait! You say you will\r\nbe easy, Sarah, if I tell you the end of all my thoughts. Good, I have\r\ntold you. There is the end--you are easy--it is all light."\r\n\r\n"Wait?" repeated Sarah, with a look of bewilderment which suggested\r\nany thing rather than a mind at ease. "I am afraid, uncle, I don\'t\r\nquite understand. Wait for what? Wait till when?"\r\n\r\n"Wait till we arrive at the house, to be sure! Wait till we are got\r\noutside the door; then is time enough to think how we are to get in,"\r\nsaid Uncle Joseph, with an air of conviction. "You understand now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--at least I understand better than I did. But there is still\r\nanother difficulty left. Uncle! I must tell you more than I intended\r\never to tell any body--I must tell you that the letter is locked up."\r\n\r\n"Locked up in a room?"\r\n\r\n"Worse than that--locked up in something inside the room. The key that\r\nopens the door--even if I get it--the key that opens the door of the\r\nroom is not all I want. There is another key besides that, a little\r\nkey--" She stopped, with a confused, startled look.\r\n\r\n"A little key that you have lost?" asked Uncle Joseph.\r\n\r\n"I threw it down the well in the village on the morning when I made my\r\nescape from Porthgenna. Oh, if I had only kept it about me! If it had\r\nonly crossed my mind that I might want it again!"\r\n\r\n"Well, well; there is no help for that now. Tell me, Sarah, what the\r\nsomething is which the letter is hidden in."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid of the very walls hearing me."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! Come! whisper it to me."\r\n\r\nShe looked all round her distrustfully, and then whispered into the\r\nold man\'s ear. He listened eagerly, and laughed when she was silent\r\nagain. "Bah!" he cried. "If that is all, make yourself happy. As you\r\nwicked English people say, it is as easy as lying. Why, my child, you\r\ncan burst him open for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Burst it open? How?"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph went to the window-seat, which was made on the\r\nold-fashioned plan, to serve the purpose of a chest as well as a seat.\r\nHe opened the lid, searched among some tools which lay in the\r\nreceptacle beneath, and took out a chisel. "See," he said,\r\ndemonstrating on the top of the window-seat the use to which the tool\r\nwas to be put. "You push him in so--crick! Then you pull him up\r\nso--crack! It is the business of one little moment--crick! crack!--and\r\nthe lock is done for. Take the chisel yourself, wrap him up in a bit\r\nof that stout paper there, and put him in your pocket. What are you\r\nwaiting for? Do you want me to show you again, or do you think you can\r\ndo it now for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I should like you to show me again, Uncle Joseph, but not now--not\r\ntill we have got to the end of our journey."\r\n\r\n"Good. Then I may finish my packing up, and go ask about the coach.\r\nFirst and foremost, Mozart must put on his great coat, and travel with\r\nus." He took up the musical box, and placed it carefully in a leather\r\ncase, which he slung by a strap over one shoulder. "Next, there is my\r\npipe, the tobacco to feed him with, and the matches to set him alight.\r\nLast, here is my old German knapsack, which I pack last night. See!\r\nhere is shirt, night-cap, comb, pocket-handkerchief, sock. Say I am an\r\nemperor, and what do I want more than that? Good. I have Mozart, I\r\nhave the pipe, I have the knapsack. I have--stop! stop; there is the\r\nold leather purse; he must not be forgotten. Look! here he is. Listen!\r\nTing, ting, ting! He jingles; he has in his inside money. Aha, my\r\nfriend, my good Leather, you shall be lighter and leaner before you\r\ncome home again. So, so--it is all complete; we are ready for the\r\nmarch now, from our tops to our toes. Good-by, Sarah, my child, for a\r\nlittle half-hour; you shall wait here and amuse yourself while I go\r\nask for the coach."\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Joseph came back, he brought his niece information that a\r\ncoach would pass through Truro in an hour\'s time, which would set them\r\ndown at a stage not more than five or six miles distant from the\r\nregular post-town of Porthgenna. The only direct conveyance to the\r\npost-town was a night-coach which carried the letter-bags, and which\r\nstopped to change horses at Truro at the very inconvenient hour of two\r\no\'clock in the morning. Being of opinion that to travel at bed-time\r\nwas to make a toil of a pleasure, Uncle Joseph recommended taking\r\nplaces in the day-coach, and hiring any conveyance that could be\r\nafterward obtained to carry his niece and himself on to the post-town.\r\nBy this arrangement they would not only secure their own comfort, but\r\ngain the additional advantage of losing as little time as possible at\r\nTruro before proceeding on their journey to Porthgenna.\r\n\r\nThe plan thus proposed was the plan followed. When the coach stopped\r\nto change horses, Uncle Joseph and his niece were waiting to take\r\ntheir places by it. They found all the inside seats but one\r\ndisengaged, were set down two hours afterward at the stage that was\r\nnearest to the destination for which they were bound, hired a\r\npony-chaise there, and reached the post-town between one and two\r\no\'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nDismissing their conveyance at the inn, from motives of caution which\r\nwere urged by Sarah, they set forth to walk across the moor to\r\nPorthgenna. On their way out of the town they met the postman\r\nreturning from his morning\'s delivery of letters in the surrounding\r\ndistrict. His bag had been much heavier and his walk much longer that\r\nmorning than usual. Among the extra letters that had taken him out of\r\nhis ordinary course was one addressed to the housekeeper at Porthgenna\r\nTower, which he had delivered early in the morning, when he first\r\nstarted on his rounds.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole journey, Uncle Joseph had not made a single\r\nreference to the object for which it had been undertaken. Possessing a\r\nchild\'s simplicity of nature, he was also endowed with a child\'s\r\nelasticity of disposition. The doubts and forebodings which troubled\r\nhis niece\'s spirit, and kept her silent and thoughtful and sad, cast\r\nno darkening shadow over the natural sunshine of his mind. If he had\r\nreally been traveling for pleasure alone, he could not have enjoyed\r\nmore thoroughly than he did the different sights and events of the\r\njourney. All the happiness which the passing minute had to give him he\r\ntook as readily and gratefully as if there was no uncertainty in the\r\nfuture, no doubt, difficulty, or danger lying in wait for him at the\r\njourney\'s end. Before he had been half an hour in the coach he had\r\nbegun to tell the third inside passenger--a rigid old lady, who stared\r\nat him in speechless amazement--the whole history of the musical box,\r\nending the narrative by setting it playing, in defiance of all the\r\nnoise that the rolling wheels could make. When they left the coach, he\r\nwas just as sociable afterward with the driver of the chaise, vaunting\r\nthe superiority of German beer over Cornish cider, and making his\r\nremarks upon the objects which they passed on the road with the\r\npleasantest familiarity, and the heartiest enjoyment of his own jokes.\r\nIt was not till he and Sarah were well out of the little town, and\r\naway by themselves on the great moor which stretched beyond it, that\r\nhis manner altered, and his talk ceased altogether. After walking on\r\nin silence for some little time, with his niece\'s arm in his, he\r\nsuddenly stopped, looked her earnestly and kindly in the face, and\r\nlaid his hand on hers.\r\n\r\n"There is yet one thing more I want to ask you, my child," he said.\r\n"The journey has put it out of my head, but it has been in my heart\r\nall the time. When we leave this place of Porthgenna, and get back to\r\nmy house, you will not go away? you will not leave Uncle Joseph again?\r\nAre you in service still, Sarah? Are you not your own master yet?"\r\n\r\n"I was in service a few days since," she answered; "but I am free now.\r\nI have lost my place."\r\n\r\n"Aha! You have lost your place; and why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would not hear an innocent person unjustly blamed.\r\nBecause--"\r\n\r\nShe checked herself. But the few words she had said were spoken with\r\nsuch a suddenly heightened color, and with such an extraordinary\r\nemphasis and resolution of tone, that the old man opened his eyes as\r\nwidely as possible, and looked at his niece in undisguised\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"So! so! so!" he exclaimed. "What! You have had a quarrel, Sarah!"\r\n\r\n"Hush! Don\'t ask me any more questions now!" she pleaded earnestly. "I\r\nam too anxious and too frightened to answer. Uncle! this is Porthgenna\r\nMoor--this is the road I passed over, sixteen years ago, when I ran\r\naway to you. Oh! let us get on, pray let us get on! I can\'t think of\r\nany thing now but the house we are so near, and the risk we are going\r\nto run."\r\n\r\nThey went on quickly, in silence. Half an hour\'s rapid walking brought\r\nthem to the highest elevation on the moor, and gave the whole western\r\nprospect grandly to their view.\r\n\r\nThere, below them, was the dark, lonesome, spacious structure of\r\nPorthgenna Tower, with the sunlight already stealing round toward the\r\nwindows of the west front! There was the path winding away to it\r\ngracefully over the brown moor, in curves of dazzling white! There,\r\nlower down, was the solitary old church, with the peaceful\r\nburial-ground nestling by its side! There, lower still, were the\r\nlittle scattered roofs of the fishermen\'s cottages! And there, beyond\r\nall, was the changeless glory of the sea, with its old seething lines\r\nof white foam, with the old winding margin of its yellow shores!\r\nSixteen long years--such years of sorrow, such years of suffering,\r\nsuch years of change, counted by the pulses of the living heart!--had\r\npassed over the dead tranquillity of Porthgenna, and had altered it as\r\nlittle as if they had all been contained within the lapse of a single\r\nday!\r\n\r\nThe moments when the spirit within us is most deeply stirred are\r\nalmost invariably the moments also when its outward manifestations are\r\nhardest to detect. Our own thoughts rise above us; our own feelings\r\nlie deeper than we can reach. How seldom words can help us, when their\r\nhelp is most wanted! How often our tears are dried up when we most\r\nlong for them to relieve us! Was there ever a strong emotion in this\r\nworld that could adequately express its own strength? What third\r\nperson, brought face to face with the old man and his niece, as they\r\nnow stood together on the moor, would have suspected, to look at them,\r\nthat the one was contemplating the landscape with nothing more than a\r\nstranger\'s curiosity, and that the other was viewing it through the\r\nrecollections of half a lifetime? The eyes of both were dry, the\r\ntongues of both were silent, the faces of both were set with equal\r\nattention toward the prospect. Even between themselves there was no\r\nreal sympathy, no intelligible appeal from one spirit to the other.\r\nThe old man\'s quiet admiration of the view was not more briefly and\r\nreadily expressed, when they moved forward and spoke to each other,\r\nthan the customary phrases of assent by which his niece replied to the\r\nlittle that he said. How many moments there are in this mortal life,\r\nwhen, with all our boasted powers of speech, the words of our\r\nvocabulary treacherously fade out, and the page presents nothing to us\r\nbut the sight of a perfect blank!\r\n\r\nSlowly descending the slope of the moor, the uncle and niece drew\r\nnearer and nearer to Porthgenna Tower. They were within a quarter of\r\nan hour\'s walk of the house when Sarah stopped at a place where a\r\nsecond path intersected the main foot-track which they had hitherto\r\nbeen following. On the left hand, as they now stood, the cross-path\r\nran on until it was lost to the eye in the expanse of the moor. On the\r\nright hand it led straight to the church.\r\n\r\n"What do we stop for now?" asked Uncle Joseph, looking first in one\r\ndirection and then in the other.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind waiting for me here a little while, uncle? I can\'t\r\npass the church path--" (she paused, in some trouble how to express\r\nherself)--"without wishing (as I don\'t know what may happen after we\r\nget to the house), without wishing to see--to look at something--" She\r\nstopped again, and turned her face wistfully toward the church. The\r\ntears, which had never wetted her eyes at the first view of\r\nPorthgenna, were beginning to rise in them now.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph\'s natural delicacy warned him that it would be best to\r\nabstain from asking her for any explanations.\r\n\r\n"Go you where you like, to see what you like," he said, patting her on\r\nthe shoulder. "I shall stop here to make myself happy with my pipe;\r\nand Mozart shall come out of his cage, and sing a little in this fine\r\nfresh air." He unslung the leather case from his shoulder while he\r\nspoke, took out the musical box, and set it ringing its tiny peal to\r\nthe second of the two airs which it was constructed to play--the\r\nminuet in Don Giovanni. Sarah left him looking about carefully, not\r\nfor a seat for himself, but for a smooth bit of rock to place the box\r\nupon. When he had found this, he lit his pipe, and sat down to his\r\nmusic and his smoking, like an epicure to a good dinner. "Aha!" he\r\nexclaimed to himself, looking round as composedly at the wild prospect\r\non all sides of him as if he was still in his own little parlor at\r\nTruro--"Aha! Here is a fine big music-room, my friend Mozart, for you\r\nto sing in! Ouf! there is wind enough in this place to blow your\r\npretty dance-tune out to sea, and give the sailor-people a taste of it\r\nas they roll about in their ships."\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: "SHE SIGHED HEAVILY AS SHE FOLLOWED THE LETTERS OF THE\r\n   INSCRIPTION MECHANICALLY, ONE BY ONE, WITH HER FINGER."]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sarah walked on rapidly toward the church, and entered the\r\ninclosure of the little burial-ground. Toward that same part of it to\r\nwhich she had directed her steps on the morning of her mistress\'s\r\ndeath, she now turned her face again, after a lapse of sixteen years.\r\nHere, at least, the march of time had left its palpable track--its\r\nfoot-prints whose marks were graves. How many a little spot of ground,\r\nempty when she last saw it, had its mound and its head-stone now! The\r\none grave that she had come to see--the grave which had stood apart in\r\nthe by-gone days, had companion graves on the right hand and on the\r\nleft. She could not have singled it out but for the weather stains on\r\nthe head-stone, which told of storm and rain over it, that had not\r\npassed over the rest. The mound was still kept in shape; but the\r\ngrass grew long, and waved a dreary welcome to her as the wind swept\r\nthrough it. She knelt down by the stone, and tried to read the\r\ninscription. The black paint which had once made the carved words\r\ndistinct was all flayed off from them now. To any other eyes but hers\r\nthe very name of the dead man would have been hard to trace. She\r\nsighed heavily as she followed the letters of the inscription\r\nmechanically, one by one, with her finger:\r\n\r\n     SACRED TO THE MEMORY\r\n     OF\r\n     HUGH POLWHEAL,\r\n     AGED 26 YEARS.\r\n     HE MET WITH HIS DEATH\r\n     THROUGH THE FALL OF A ROCK\r\n     IN\r\n     PORTHGENNA MINE,\r\n     DECEMBER 17TH, 1823.\r\n\r\nHer hand lingered over the letters after it had followed them to the\r\nlast line, and she bent forward and pressed her lips on the stone.\r\n\r\n"Better so!" she said to herself, as she rose from her knees, and\r\nlooked down at the inscription for the last time. "Better it should\r\nfade out so! Fewer strangers\' eyes will see it; fewer strangers\' feet\r\nwill follow where mine have been--he will lie all the quieter in the\r\nplace of his rest!"\r\n\r\nShe brushed the tears from her eyes, and gathered a few blades of\r\ngrass from the grave--then left the church-yard. Outside the hedge\r\nthat surrounded the inclosure she stopped for a moment, and drew from\r\nthe bosom of her dress the little book of Wesley\'s Hymns which she had\r\ntaken with her from the desk in her bedroom on the morning of her\r\nflight from Porthgenna. The withered remains of the grass that she had\r\nplucked from the grave sixteen years ago lay between the pages still.\r\nShe added to them the fresh fragments that she had just gathered,\r\nreplaced the book in the bosom of her dress, and hastened back over\r\nthe moor to the spot where the old man was waiting for her.\r\n\r\nShe found him packing up the musical box again in its leather case.\r\n"A good wind," he said, holding up the palm of his hand to the fresh\r\nbreeze that was sweeping over the moor--"A very good wind, indeed, if\r\nyou take him by himself--but a bitter bad wind if you take him with\r\nMozart. He blows off the tune as if it was the hat on my head. You\r\ncome back, my child, just at the nick of time--just when my pipe is\r\ndone, and Mozart is ready to travel along the road once more. Ah, have\r\nyou got the crying look in your eyes again, Sarah? What have you met\r\nwith to make you cry? So! so! I see--the fewer questions I ask just\r\nnow, the better you will like me. Good. I have done. No! I have a last\r\nquestion yet. What are we standing here for? why do we not go on?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; you are right, Uncle Joseph; let us go on at once. I shall\r\nlose all the little courage I have if we stay here much longer looking\r\nat the house."\r\n\r\nThey proceeded down the path without another moment of delay. When\r\nthey had reached the end of it, they stood opposite the eastern\r\nboundary wall of Porthgenna Tower. The principal entrance to the\r\nhouse, which had been very rarely used of late years, was in the west\r\nfront, and was approached by a terrace road that overlooked the sea.\r\nThe smaller entrance, which was generally used, was situated on the\r\nsouth side of the building, and led through the servants\' offices to\r\nthe great hall and the west staircase. Sarah\'s old experience of\r\nPorthgenna guided her instinctively toward this part of the house. She\r\nled her companion on until they gained the southern angle of the east\r\nwall--then stopped and looked about her. Since they had passed the\r\npostman and had entered on the moor, they had not set eyes on a living\r\ncreature; and still, though they were now under the very walls of\r\nPorthgenna, neither man, woman, nor child--not even a domestic\r\nanimal--appeared in view.\r\n\r\n"It is very lonely here," said Sarah, looking round her distrustfully;\r\n"much lonelier than it used to be."\r\n\r\n"Is it only to tell me what I can see for myself that you are stopping\r\nnow?" asked Uncle Joseph, whose inveterate cheerfulness would have\r\nbeen proof against the solitude of Sahara itself.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" she answered, in a quick, anxious whisper. "But the bell we\r\nmust ring at is so close--only round there--I should like to know\r\nwhat we are to say when we come face to face with the servant. You\r\ntold me it was time enough to think about that when we were at the\r\ndoor. Uncle! we are all but at the door now. What shall we do?"\r\n\r\n"The first thing to do," said Uncle Joseph, shrugging his shoulders,\r\n"is surely to ring."\r\n\r\n"Yes--but when the servant comes, what are we to say?"\r\n\r\n"Say?" repeated Uncle Joseph, knitting his eyebrows quite fiercely\r\nwith the effort of thinking, and rapping his forehead with his\r\nforefinger just under his hat--"Say? Stop, stop, stop, stop! Ah, I\r\nhave got it! I know! Make yourself quite easy, Sarah. The moment the\r\ndoor is opened, all the speaking to the servant shall be done by me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how you relieve me! What shall you say?"\r\n\r\n"Say? This--\'How do you do? We have come to see the house.\'"\r\n\r\nWhen he had disclosed that remarkable expedient for effecting an\r\nentrance into Porthgenna Tower, he spread out both his hands\r\ninterrogatively, drew back several paces from his niece, and looked at\r\nher with the serenely self-satisfied air of a man who has leaped, at\r\none mental bound, from a doubt to a discovery. Sarah gazed at him in\r\nastonishment. The expression of absolute conviction on his face\r\nstaggered her. The poorest of all the poor excuses for gaining\r\nadmission into the house which she herself had thought of, and had\r\nrejected, during the previous night, seemed like the very perfection\r\nof artifice by comparison with such a childishly simple expedient as\r\nthat suggested by Uncle Joseph. And yet there he stood, apparently\r\nquite convinced that he had hit on the means of smoothing away all\r\nobstacles at once. Not knowing what to say, not believing sufficiently\r\nin the validity of her own doubts to venture on openly expressing an\r\nopinion either one way or the other, she took the last refuge that was\r\nnow left open to her--she endeavored to gain time.\r\n\r\n"It is very, very good of you, uncle, to take all the difficulty of\r\nspeaking to the servant on your own shoulders," she said; the hidden\r\ndespondency at her heart expressing itself, in spite of her, in the\r\nfaintness of her voice and the forlorn perplexity of her eyes. "But\r\nwould you mind waiting a little before we ring at the door, and\r\nwalking up and down for a few minutes by the side of this wall, where\r\nnobody is likely to see us? I want to get a little more time to\r\nprepare myself for the trial that I have to go through; and--and in\r\ncase the servant makes any difficulties about letting us in--I mean\r\ndifficulties that we can not just now anticipate--would it not be as\r\nwell to think of something else to say at the door? Perhaps, if you\r\nwere to consider again--"\r\n\r\n"There is not the least need," interposed Uncle Joseph. "I have only\r\nto speak to the servant, and--crick! crack!--you will see that we\r\nshall get in. But I will walk up and down as long as you please. There\r\nis no reason, because I have done all my thinking in one moment, that\r\nyou should have done all your thinking in one moment too. No, no,\r\nno--no reason at all." Saying those words with a patronizing air and a\r\nself-satisfied smile, which would have been irresistibly comical under\r\nany less critical circumstances, the old man again offered his arm to\r\nhis niece, and led her back over the broken ground that lay under the\r\neastern wall of Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Sarah was waiting in doubt outside the walls, it happened, by a\r\ncurious coincidence, that another person, vested with the highest\r\ndomestic authority, was also waiting in doubt inside the walls. This\r\nperson was no other than the housekeeper of Porthgenna Tower; and the\r\ncause of her perplexity was nothing less than the letter which had\r\nbeen delivered by the postman that very morning.\r\n\r\nIt was a letter from Mrs. Frankland, which had been written after she\r\nhad held a long conversation with her husband and Mr. Orridge, on\r\nreceiving the last fragments of information which the doctor was able\r\nto communicate in reference to Mrs. Jazeph.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper had read the letter through over and over again, and\r\nwas more puzzled and astonished by it at every fresh reading. She was\r\nnow waiting for the return of the steward, Mr. Munder, from his\r\noccupations out of doors, with the intention of taking his opinion on\r\nthe singular communication which she had received from her mistress.\r\n\r\nWhile Sarah and her uncle were still walking up and down outside the\r\neastern wall, Mr. Munder entered the housekeeper\'s room. He was one of\r\nthose tall, grave, benevolent-looking men, with a conical head, a deep\r\nvoice, a slow step, and a heavy manner, who passively contrive to get\r\na great reputation for wisdom without the trouble of saying or doing\r\nany thing to deserve it. All round the Porthgenna neighborhood the\r\nsteward was popularly spoken of as a remarkably sound, sensible man;\r\nand the housekeeper, although a sharp woman in other matters, in this\r\none respect shared to a large extent in the general delusion.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Mrs. Pentreath," said Mr. Munder. "Any news to-day?"\r\nWhat a weight and importance his deep voice and his impressively slow\r\nmethod of using it, gave to those two insignificant sentences!\r\n\r\n"News, Mr. Munder, that will astonish you," replied the housekeeper.\r\n"I have received a letter this morning from Mrs. Frankland, which is,\r\nwithout any exception, the most mystifying thing of the sort I ever\r\nmet with. I am told to communicate the letter to you; and I have been\r\nwaiting the whole morning to hear your opinion of it. Pray sit down,\r\nand give me all your attention--for I do positively assure you that\r\nthe letter requires it."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder sat down, and became the picture of attention\r\nimmediately--not of ordinary attention, which can be wearied, but of\r\njudicial attention, which knows no fatigue, and is superior alike to\r\nthe power of dullness and the power of time. The housekeeper, without\r\nwasting the precious minutes--Mr. Munder\'s minutes, which ranked next\r\non the scale of importance to a prime minister\'s!--opened her\r\nmistress\'s letter, and, resisting the natural temptation to make a few\r\nmore prefatory remarks on it, immediately favored the steward with the\r\nfirst paragraph, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     "MRS. PENTREATH,--You must be tired of receiving letters\r\n     from me, fixing a day for the arrival of Mr. Frankland and\r\n     myself. On this, the third occasion of my writing to you\r\n     about our plans, it will be best, I think, to make no third\r\n     appointment, but merely to say that we shall leave West\r\n     Winston for Porthgenna the moment I can get the doctor\'s\r\n     permission to travel."\r\n\r\n"So far," remarked Mrs. Pentreath, placing the letter on her lap, and\r\nsmoothing it out rather irritably while she spoke--"so far, there is\r\nnothing of much consequence. The letter certainly seems to me\r\n(between ourselves) to be written in rather poor language--too much\r\nlike common talking to come up to my idea of what a lady\'s style of\r\ncomposition ought to be--but that is a matter of opinion. I can\'t say,\r\nand I should be the last person to wish to say, that the beginning of\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s letter is not, upon the whole, perfectly clear. It is\r\nthe middle and the end that I wish to consult you about, Mr. Munder."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mr. Munder. Only two words, but more meaning in them\r\nthan two hundred in the mouth of an ordinary man! The housekeeper\r\ncleared her throat with extraordinary loudness and elaboration, and\r\nread on thus:\r\n\r\n     "My principal object in writing these lines is to request,\r\n     by Mr. Frankland\'s desire, that you and Mr. Munder will\r\n     endeavor to ascertain, as privately as possible, whether a\r\n     person now traveling in Cornwall--in whom we happen to be\r\n     much interested--has been yet seen in the neighborhood of\r\n     Porthgenna. The person in question is known to us by the\r\n     name of Mrs. Jazeph. She is an elderly woman, of quiet,\r\n     lady-like manners, looking nervous and in delicate health.\r\n     She dresses, according to our experience of her, with\r\n     extreme propriety and neatness, and in dark colors. Her\r\n     eyes have a singular expression of timidity, her voice is\r\n     particularly soft and low, and her manner is frequently\r\n     marked by extreme hesitation. I am thus particular in\r\n     describing her, in case she should not be traveling under\r\n     the name by which we know her.\r\n\r\n     "For reasons which it is not necessary to state, both my\r\n     husband and myself think it probable that, at some former\r\n     period of her life, Mrs. Jazeph may have been connected\r\n     with the Porthgenna neighborhood. Whether this be the fact\r\n     or no, it is indisputably certain that she is familiar with\r\n     the interior of Porthgenna Tower, and that she has an\r\n     interest of some kind, quite incomprehensible to us, in the\r\n     house. Coupling these facts with the knowledge we have of\r\n     her being now in Cornwall, we think it just within the\r\n     range of possibility that you or Mr. Munder, or some other\r\n     person in our employment, may meet with her; and we are\r\n     particularly anxious, if she should by any chance ask to\r\n     see the house, not only that you should show her over it\r\n     with perfect readiness and civility, but also that you\r\n     should take private and particular notice of her conduct\r\n     from the time when she enters the building to the time when\r\n     she leaves it. Do not let her out of your sight for a\r\n     moment; and, if possible, pray get some trustworthy person\r\n     to follow her unperceived, and ascertain where she goes to\r\n     after she has quitted the house. It is of the most vital\r\n     importance that these instructions (strange as they may\r\n     seem to you) should be implicitly obeyed to the very\r\n     letter.\r\n\r\n     "I have only room and time to add that we know nothing to\r\n     the discredit of this person, and that we particularly\r\n     desire you will manage matters with sufficient discretion\r\n     (in case you meet with her) to prevent her from having any\r\n     suspicion that you are acting under orders, or that you\r\n     have any especial interest in watching her movements. You\r\n     will be good enough to communicate this letter to the\r\n     steward, and you are at liberty to repeat the instructions\r\n     in it to any other trustworthy person, if necessary.\r\n\r\n     "Yours truly,\r\n\r\n     "ROSAMOND FRANKLAND.\r\n\r\n     "P.S.--I have left my room, and the baby is getting on\r\n     charmingly."\r\n\r\n"There!" said the housekeeper. "Who is to make head or tail of that, I\r\nshould like to know! Did you ever, in all your experience, Mr. Munder,\r\nmeet with such a letter before? Here is a very heavy responsibility\r\nlaid on our shoulders, without one word of explanation. I have been\r\npuzzling my brains about what their interest in this mysterious woman\r\ncan be the whole morning; and the more I think, the less comes of it.\r\nWhat is your opinion, Mr. Munder? We ought to do something\r\nimmediately. Is there any course in particular which you feel disposed\r\nto point out?"\r\n\r\nMr. Munder coughed dubiously, crossed his right leg over his left, put\r\nhis head critically on one side, coughed for the second time, and\r\nlooked at the housekeeper. If it had belonged to any other man in the\r\nworld, Mrs. Pentreath would have considered that the face which now\r\nconfronted hers expressed nothing but the most profound and vacant\r\nbewilderment. But it was Mr. Munder\'s face, and it was only to be\r\nlooked at with sentiments of respectful expectation.\r\n\r\n"I rather think--" began Mr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said the housekeeper, eagerly.\r\n\r\nBefore another word could be spoken, the maid-servant entered the room\r\nto lay the cloth for Mrs. Pentreath\'s dinner.\r\n\r\n"There, there! never mind now, Betsey," said the housekeeper,\r\nimpatiently. "Don\'t lay the cloth till I ring for you. Mr. Munder and\r\nI have something very important to talk about, and we can\'t be\r\ninterrupted just yet."\r\n\r\nShe had hardly said the word, before an interruption of the most\r\nunexpected kind happened. The door-bell rang. This was a very unusual\r\noccurrence at Porthgenna Tower. The few persons who had any occasion\r\nto come to the house on domestic business always entered by a small\r\nside gate, which was left on the latch in the day-time.\r\n\r\n"Who in the world can that be!" exclaimed Mrs. Pentreath, hastening to\r\nthe window, which commanded a side view of the lower door steps.\r\n\r\nThe first object that met her eye when she looked out was a lady\r\nstanding on the lowest step--a lady dressed very neatly in quiet, dark\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens, Mr. Munder!" cried the housekeeper, hurrying back to\r\nthe table, and snatching up Mrs. Frankland\'s letter, which she had\r\nleft on it. "There is a stranger waiting at the door at this very\r\nmoment! a lady! or, at least, a woman--and dressed neatly, dressed in\r\ndark colors! You might knock me down, Mr. Munder, with a feather!\r\nStop, Betsey--stop where you are!"\r\n\r\n"I was only going, ma\'am, to answer the door," said Betsey, in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n"Stop where you are," reiterated Mrs. Pentreath, composing herself by\r\na great effort. "I happen to have certain reasons, on this particular\r\noccasion, for descending out of my own place and putting myself into\r\nyours. Stand out of the way, you staring fool! I am going up stairs to\r\nanswer that ring at the door myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINSIDE THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath\'s surprise at seeing a lady through the window, was\r\ndoubled by her amazement at seeing a gentleman when she opened the\r\ndoor. Waiting close to the bell-handle, after he had rung, instead of\r\nrejoining his niece on the step, Uncle Joseph stood near enough to the\r\nhouse to be out of the range of view from Mrs. Pentreath\'s window. To\r\nthe housekeeper\'s excited imagination, he appeared on the threshold\r\nwith the suddenness of an apparition--the apparition of a little\r\nrosy-faced old gentleman, smiling, bowing, and taking off his hat with\r\na superb flourish of politeness, which had something quite superhuman\r\nin the sweep and the dexterity of it.\r\n\r\n"How do you do? We have come to see the house," said Uncle Joseph,\r\ntrying his infallible expedient for gaining admission the instant the\r\ndoor was open.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath was struck speechless. Who was this familiar old\r\ngentleman with the foreign accent and the fantastic bow? and what did\r\nhe mean by talking to her as if she was his intimate friend? Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s letter said not so much, from beginning to end, as one\r\nword about him.\r\n\r\n"How do you do? We have come to see the house," repeated Uncle Joseph,\r\ngiving his irresistible form of salutation the benefit of a second\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n"So you said just now, Sir," remarked Mrs. Pentreath, recovering\r\nself-possession enough to use her tongue in her own defense. "Does the\r\nlady," she continued, looking down over the old man\'s shoulder at the\r\nstep on which his niece was standing--"does the lady wish to see the\r\nhouse too?"\r\n\r\nSarah\'s gently spoken reply in the affirmative, short as it was,\r\nconvinced the housekeeper that the woman described in Mrs. Frankland\'s\r\nletter really and truly stood before her. Besides the neat, quiet\r\ndress, there was now the softly toned voice, and, when she looked up\r\nfor a moment, there were the timid eyes also to identify her by! In\r\nrelation to this one of the two strangers, Mrs. Pentreath, however\r\nagitated and surprised she might be, could no longer feel any\r\nuncertainty about the course she ought to adopt. But in relation to\r\nthe other visitor, the incomprehensible old foreigner, she was beset\r\nby the most bewildering doubts. Would it be safest to hold to the\r\nletter of Mrs. Frankland\'s instructions, and ask him to wait outside\r\nwhile the lady was being shown over the house? or would it be best to\r\nact on her own responsibility, and to risk giving him admission as\r\nwell as his companion? This was a difficult point to decide, and\r\ntherefore one which it was necessary to submit to the superior\r\nsagacity of Mr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"Will you step in for a moment, and wait here while I speak to the\r\nsteward?" said Mrs. Pentreath, pointedly neglecting to notice the\r\nfamiliar old foreigner, and addressing herself straight through him to\r\nthe lady on the steps below.\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much," said Uncle Joseph, smiling and bowing,\r\nimpervious to rebuke. "What did I tell you?" he whispered triumphantly\r\nto his niece, as she passed him on her way into the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath\'s first impulse was to go down stairs at once, and\r\nspeak to Mr. Munder. But a timely recollection of that part of Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s letter which enjoined her not to lose sight of the lady in\r\nthe quiet dress, brought her to a stand-still the next moment. She was\r\nthe more easily recalled to a remembrance of this particular\r\ninjunction by a curious alteration in the conduct of the lady herself,\r\nwho seemed to lose all her diffidence, and to become surprisingly\r\nimpatient to lead the way into the interior of the house, the moment\r\nshe had stepped across the threshold.\r\n\r\n"Betsey!" cried Mrs. Pentreath, cautiously calling to the servant\r\nafter she had only retired a few paces from the visitors--"Betsey! ask\r\nMr. Munder to be so kind as to step this way."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder presented himself with great deliberation, and with a\r\ncertain lowering dignity in his face. He had been accustomed to be\r\ntreated with deference, and he was not pleased with the housekeeper\r\nfor unceremoniously leaving him the moment she heard the ring at the\r\nbell, without giving him time to pronounce an opinion on Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s letter. Accordingly, when Mrs. Pentreath, in a high state\r\nof excitement, drew him aside out of hearing, and confided to him, in\r\na whisper, the astounding intelligence that the lady in whom Mr. and\r\nMrs. Frankland were so mysteriously interested was, at that moment,\r\nactually standing before him in the house, he received her\r\ncommunication with an air of the most provoking indifference. It was\r\nworse still when she proceeded to state her difficulties--warily\r\nkeeping her eye on the two strangers all the while. Appeal as\r\nrespectfully as she might to Mr. Munder\'s superior wisdom for\r\nguidance, he persisted in listening with a disparaging frown, and\r\nended by irritably contradicting her when she ventured to add, in\r\nconclusion, that her own ideas inclined her to assume no\r\nresponsibility, and to beg the foreign gentleman to wait outside while\r\nthe lady, in conformity with Mrs. Frankland\'s instructions, was being\r\nshown over the house.\r\n\r\n"Such may be your opinion, ma\'am," said Mr. Munder, severely. "It is\r\nnot mine."\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper looked aghast. "Perhaps," she suggested,\r\ndeferentially, "you think that the foreign old gentleman would be\r\nlikely to insist on going over the house with the lady?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I think so," said Mr. Munder. (He had thought nothing of\r\nthe sort; his only idea just then being the idea of asserting his own\r\nsupremacy by setting himself steadily in opposition to any\r\npreconceived arrangements of Mrs. Pentreath.)\r\n\r\n"Then you would take the responsibility of showing them both over the\r\nhouse, seeing that they have both come to the door together?" asked\r\nthe housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"Of course I would," answered the steward, with the promptitude of\r\nresolution which distinguishes all superior men.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Munder, I am always glad to be guided by your opinion, and\r\nI will be guided by it now," said Mrs. Pentreath. "But, as there will\r\nbe two people to look after--for I would not trust the foreigner out\r\nof sight on any consideration whatever--I must really beg you to share\r\nthe trouble of showing them over the house along with me. I am so\r\nexcited and nervous that I don\'t feel as if I had all my wits about\r\nme--I never was placed in such a position as this before--I am in the\r\nmidst of mysteries that I don\'t understand--and, in short, if I can\'t\r\ncount on your assistance, I won\'t answer for it that I shall not make\r\nsome mistake. I should be very sorry to make a mistake, not only on my\r\nown account, but--" Here the housekeeper stopped, and looked hard at\r\nMr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"Go on, ma\'am," said Mr. Munder, with cruel composure.\r\n\r\n"Not only on my own account," resumed Mrs. Pentreath, demurely, "but\r\non yours; for Mrs. Frankland\'s letter certainly casts the\r\nresponsibility of conducting this delicate business on your shoulders\r\nas well as on mine."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder recoiled a few steps, turned red, opened his lips\r\nindignantly, hesitated, and closed them again. He was fairly caught in\r\na trap of his own setting. He could not retreat from the\r\nresponsibility of directing the housekeeper\'s conduct, the moment\r\nafter he had voluntarily assumed it; and he could not deny that Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s letter positively and repeatedly referred to him by name.\r\nThere was only one way of getting out of the difficulty with dignity,\r\nand Mr. Munder unblushingly took that way the moment he had recovered\r\nself-possession enough to collect himself for the effort.\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly amazed, Mrs. Pentreath," he began, with the gravest\r\ndignity. "Yes, I repeat, I am perfectly amazed that you should think\r\nme capable of leaving you to go over the house alone, under such\r\nremarkable circumstances as those we are now placed in. No, ma\'am!\r\nwhatever my other faults may be, shrinking from my share of\r\nresponsibility is not one of them. I don\'t require to be reminded of\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s letter; and--no!--I don\'t require any apologies. I am\r\nquite ready, ma\'am--quite ready to show the way up stairs whenever you\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"The sooner the better, Mr. Munder--for there is that audacious old\r\nforeigner actually chattering to Betsey now, as if he had known her\r\nall his life!"\r\n\r\nThe assertion was quite true. Uncle Joseph was exercising his gift of\r\nfamiliarity on the maid-servant (who had lingered to stare at the\r\nstrangers, instead of going back to the kitchen), just as he had\r\nalready exercised it on the old lady passenger in the stage-coach, and\r\non the driver of the pony-chaise which took his niece and himself to\r\nthe post-town of Porthgenna. While the housekeeper and the steward\r\nwere holding their private conference, he was keeping Betsey in\r\necstasies of suppressed giggling by the odd questions that he asked\r\nabout the house, and about how she got on with her work in it. His\r\ninquiries had naturally led from the south side of the building, by\r\nwhich he and his companion had entered, to the west side, which they\r\nwere shortly to explore; and thence round to the north side, which was\r\nforbidden ground to every body in the house. When Mrs. Pentreath came\r\nforward with the steward, she overheard this exchange of question and\r\nanswer passing between the foreigner and the maid:\r\n\r\n"But tell me, Betzee, my dear," said Uncle Joseph. "Why does nobody\r\never go into these mouldy old rooms?"\r\n\r\n"Because there\'s a ghost in them," answered Betsey, with a burst of\r\nlaughter, as if a series of haunted rooms and a series of excellent\r\njokes meant precisely the same thing.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue directly, and go back to the kitchen," cried Mrs.\r\nPentreath, indignantly. "The ignorant people about here," she\r\ncontinued, still pointedly overlooking Uncle Joseph, and addressing\r\nherself only to Sarah, "tell absurd stories about some old rooms on\r\nthe unrepaired side of the house, which have not been inhabited for\r\nmore than half a century past--absurd stories about a ghost; and my\r\nservant is foolish enough to believe them."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not," said Betsey, retiring, under protest, to the lower\r\nregions. "I don\'t believe a word about the ghost--at least not in the\r\nday-time." Adding that important saving clause in a whisper, Betsey\r\nunwillingly withdrew from the scene.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath observed, with some surprise, that the mysterious lady\r\nin the quiet dress turned very pale at the mention of the ghost story,\r\nand made no remark on it whatever. While she was still wondering what\r\nthis meant, Mr. Munder emerged into dignified prominence, and loftily\r\naddressed himself, not to Uncle Joseph, and not to Sarah, but to the\r\nempty air between them.\r\n\r\n"If you wish to see the house," he said, "you will have the goodness\r\nto follow me."\r\n\r\nWith those words, Mr. Munder turned solemnly into the passage that led\r\nto the foot of the west staircase, walking with that peculiar, slow\r\nstrut in which all serious-minded English people indulge when they go\r\nout to take a little exercise on Sunday. The housekeeper, adapting her\r\npace with feminine pliancy to the pace of the steward, walked the\r\nnational Sabbatarian Polonaise by his side, as if she was out with him\r\nfor a mouthful of fresh air between the services.\r\n\r\n"As I am a living sinner, this going over the house is like going to a\r\nfuneral!" whispered Uncle Joseph to his niece. He drew her arm into\r\nhis, and felt, as he did so, that she was trembling.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" he asked, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"Uncle! there is something unnatural about the readiness of these\r\npeople to show us over the house," was the faintly whispered answer.\r\n"What were they talking about just now, out of our hearing? Why did\r\nthat woman keep her eyes fixed so constantly on me?"\r\n\r\nBefore the old man could answer, the housekeeper looked round, and\r\nbegged, with the severest emphasis, that they would be good enough to\r\nfollow. In less than another minute they were all standing at the foot\r\nof the west staircase.\r\n\r\n"Aha!" cried Uncle Joseph, as easy and talkative as ever, even in the\r\npresence of Mr. Munder himself. "A fine big house, and a very good\r\nstaircase."\r\n\r\n"We are not accustomed to hear either the house or the staircase\r\nspoken of in these terms, Sir," said Mr. Munder, resolving to nip the\r\nforeigner\'s familiarity in the bud. "The Guide to West Cornwall, which\r\nyou would have done well to make yourself acquainted with before you\r\ncame here, describes Porthgenna Tower as a Mansion, and uses the word\r\nSpacious in speaking of the west staircase. I regret to find, Sir,\r\nthat you have not consulted the Guide-book to West Cornwall."\r\n\r\n"And why?" rejoined the unabashed German. "What do I want with a book,\r\nwhen I have got you for my guide? Ah, dear Sir, but you are not just\r\nto yourself! Is not a living guide like you, who talks and walks\r\nabout, better for me than dead leaves of print and paper? Ah, no, no!\r\nI shall not hear another word--I shall not hear you do any more\r\ninjustice to yourself." Here Uncle Joseph made another fantastic bow,\r\nlooked up smiling into the steward\'s face, and shook his head several\r\ntimes with an air of friendly reproach.\r\n\r\nMr. Munder felt paralyzed. He could not have been treated with more\r\nease and indifferent familiarity if this obscure foreign stranger had\r\nbeen an English duke. He had often heard of the climax of audacity;\r\nand here it was visibly embodied in one small, elderly individual, who\r\ndid not rise quite five feet from the ground he stood on!\r\n\r\nWhile the steward was swelling with a sense of injury too large for\r\nutterance, the housekeeper, followed by Sarah, was slowly ascending\r\nthe stairs. Uncle Joseph, seeing them go up, hastened to join his\r\nniece, and Mr. Munder, after waiting a little while on the mat to\r\nrecover himself, followed the audacious foreigner with the intention\r\nof watching his conduct narrowly, and chastising his insolence at the\r\nfirst opportunity with stinging words of rebuke.\r\n\r\nThe procession up the stairs thus formed was not, however, closed by\r\nthe steward; it was further adorned and completed by Betsey, the\r\nservant-maid, who stole out of the kitchen to follow the strange\r\nvisitors over the house, as closely as she could without attracting\r\nthe notice of Mrs. Pentreath. Betsey had her share of natural human\r\ncuriosity and love of change. No such event as the arrival of\r\nstrangers had ever before enlivened the dreary monotony of Porthgenna\r\nTower within her experience; and she was resolved not to stay alone in\r\nthe kitchen while there was a chance of hearing a stray word of the\r\nconversation, or catching a chance glimpse of the proceedings among\r\nthe company up stairs.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the housekeeper had led the way as far as the\r\nfirst-floor landing, on either side of which the principal rooms in\r\nthe west front were situated. Sharpened by fear and suspicion, Sarah\'s\r\neyes immediately detected the repairs which had been effected in the\r\nbanisters and stairs of the second flight.\r\n\r\n"You have had workmen in the house?" she said quickly to Mrs.\r\nPentreath.\r\n\r\n"You mean on the stairs?" returned the housekeeper. "Yes, we have had\r\nworkmen there."\r\n\r\n"And nowhere else?"\r\n\r\n"No. But they are wanted in other places badly enough. Even here, on\r\nthe best side of the house, half the bedrooms up stairs are hardly fit\r\nto sleep in. They were any thing but comfortable, as I have heard,\r\neven in the late Mrs. Treverton\'s time; and since she died--"\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper stopped with a frown and a look of surprise. The lady\r\nin the quiet dress, instead of sustaining the reputation for good\r\nmanners which had been conferred on her in Mrs. Frankland\'s letter,\r\nwas guilty of the unpardonable discourtesy of turning away from Mrs.\r\nPentreath before she had done speaking. Determined not to allow\r\nherself to be impertinently silenced in that way, she coldly and\r\ndistinctly repeated her last words--\r\n\r\n"And since Mrs. Treverton died--"\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted for the second time. The strange lady, turning\r\nquickly round again, confronted her with a very pale face and a very\r\neager look, and asked, in the most abrupt manner, an utterly\r\nirrelevant question:\r\n\r\n"Tell me about that ghost story," she said. "Do they say it is the\r\nghost of a man or of a woman?"\r\n\r\n"I was speaking of the late Mrs. Treverton," said the housekeeper, in\r\nher severest tones of reproof, "and not of the ghost story about the\r\nnorth rooms. You would have known that, if you had done me the favor\r\nto listen to what _I_ said."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon; I beg your pardon a thousand times for seeming\r\ninattentive! It struck me just then--or, at least, I wanted to know--"\r\n\r\n"If you care to know about any thing so absurd," said Mrs. Pentreath,\r\nmollified by the evident sincerity of the apology that had been\r\noffered to her, "the ghost, according to the story, is the ghost of a\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\nThe strange lady\'s face grew whiter than ever; and she turned away\r\nonce more to the open window on the landing.\r\n\r\n"How hot it is!" she said, putting her head out into the air.\r\n\r\n"Hot, with a northeast wind!" exclaimed Mrs. Pentreath, in amazement.\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Joseph came forward with a polite request to know when they\r\nwere going to look over the rooms. For the last few minutes he had\r\nbeen asking all sorts of questions of Mr. Munder; and, having received\r\nno answers which were not of the shortest and most ungracious kind,\r\nhad given up talking to the steward in despair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath prepared to lead the way into the breakfast-room,\r\nlibrary, and drawing-room. All three communicated with each other,\r\nand each room had a second door opening on a long passage, the\r\nentrance to which was on the right-hand side of the first-floor\r\nlanding. Before leading the way into these rooms, the housekeeper\r\ntouched Sarah on the shoulder to intimate that it was time to be\r\nmoving on.\r\n\r\n"As for the ghost story," resumed Mrs. Pentreath, while she opened the\r\nbreakfast-room door, "you must apply to the ignorant people who\r\nbelieve in it, if you want to hear it all told. Whether the ghost is\r\nan old ghost or a new ghost, and why she is supposed to walk, is more\r\nthan I can tell you." In spite of the housekeeper\'s affectation of\r\nindifference toward the popular superstition, she had heard enough of\r\nthe ghost-story to frighten her, though she would not confess it.\r\nInside the house, or outside the house, nobody much less willing to\r\nventure into the north rooms alone could in real truth have been found\r\nthan Mrs. Pentreath herself.\r\n\r\nWhile the housekeeper was drawing up the blinds in the\r\nbreakfast-parlor, and while Mr. Munder was opening the door that led\r\nout of it into the library, Uncle Joseph stole to his niece\'s side,\r\nand spoke a few words of encouragement to her in his quaint, kindly\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"Courage!" he whispered. "Keep your wits about you, Sarah, and catch\r\nyour little opportunity whenever you can."\r\n\r\n"My thoughts! My thoughts!" she answered in the same low key. "This\r\nhouse rouses them all against me. Oh, why did I ever venture into it\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\n"You had better look at the view from the window now," said Mrs.\r\nPentreath, after she had drawn up the blind. "It is very much\r\nadmired."\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were in this stage of progress on the first floor of the\r\nhouse, Betsey, who had been hitherto stealing up by a stair at a time\r\nfrom the hall, and listening with all her ears in the intervals of the\r\nascent, finding that no sound of voices now reached her, bethought\r\nherself of returning to the kitchen again, and of looking after the\r\nhousekeeper\'s dinner, which was being kept warm by the fire. She\r\ndescended to the lower regions, wondering what part of the house the\r\nstrangers would want to see next, and puzzling her brains to find out\r\nsome excuse for attaching herself to the exploring party.\r\n\r\nAfter the view from the breakfast-room window had been duly\r\ncontemplated, the library was next entered. In this room, Mrs.\r\nPentreath, having some leisure to look about her, and employing that\r\nleisure in observing the conduct of the steward, arrived at the\r\nunpleasant conviction that Mr. Munder was by no means to be depended\r\non to assist her in the important business of watching the proceedings\r\nof the two strangers. Doubly stimulated to assert his own dignity by\r\nthe disrespectfully easy manner in which he had been treated by Uncle\r\nJoseph, the sole object of Mr. Munder\'s ambition seemed to be to\r\ndivest himself as completely as possible of the character of guide,\r\nwhich the unscrupulous foreigner sought to confer on him. He sauntered\r\nheavily about the rooms, with the air of a casual visitor, staring out\r\nof window, peeping into books on tables, frowning at himself in the\r\nchimney-glasses--looking, in short, any where but where he ought to\r\nlook. The housekeeper, exasperated by this affectation of\r\nindifference, whispered to him irritably to keep his eye on the\r\nforeigner, as it was quite as much as she could do to look after the\r\nlady in the quiet dress.\r\n\r\n"Very good; very good," said Mr. Munder, with sulky carelessness. "And\r\nwhere are you going to next, ma\'am, after we have been into the\r\ndrawing-room? Back again, through the library, into the\r\nbreakfast-room? or out at once into the passage? Be good enough to\r\nsettle which, as you seem to be in the way of settling every thing."\r\n\r\n"Into the passage, to be sure," answered Mrs. Pentreath, "to show the\r\nnext three rooms beyond these."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder sauntered out of the library, through the door-way of\r\ncommunication, into the drawing-room, unlocked the door leading into\r\nthe passage--then, to the great disgust of the housekeeper, strolled\r\nto the fire-place, and looked at himself in the glass over it, just as\r\nattentively as he had looked at himself in the library mirror hardly a\r\nminute before.\r\n\r\n"This is the west drawing-room," said Mrs. Pentreath, calling to the\r\nvisitors. "The carving of the stone chimney-piece," she added, with\r\nthe mischievous intention of bringing them into the closest proximity\r\nto the steward, "is considered the finest thing in the whole\r\napartment."\r\n\r\nDriven from the looking-glass by this manoeuvre, Mr. Munder\r\nprovokingly sauntered to the window and looked out. Sarah, still pale\r\nand silent--but with a certain unwonted resolution just gathering, as\r\nit were, in the lines about her lips--stopped thoughtfully by the\r\nchimney-piece when the housekeeper pointed it out to her. Uncle\r\nJoseph, looking all round the room in his discursive manner, spied, in\r\nthe farthest corner of it from the door that led into the passage, a\r\nbeautiful maple-wood table and cabinet, of a very peculiar pattern.\r\nHis workmanlike enthusiasm was instantly aroused, and he darted across\r\nthe room to examine the make of the cabinet closely. The table beneath\r\nprojected a little way in front of it, and, of all the objects in the\r\nworld, what should he see reposing on the flat space of the projection\r\nbut a magnificent musical box at least three times the size of his\r\nown!\r\n\r\n"A\xc3\xafe! A\xc3\xafe!! A\xc3\xafe!!!" cried Uncle Joseph, in an ascending scale of\r\nadmiration, which ended at the very top of his voice. "Open him! set\r\nhim going! let me hear what he plays!" He stopped for want of words to\r\nexpress his impatience, and drummed with both hands on the lid of the\r\nmusical box in a burst of uncontrollable enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Munder!" exclaimed the housekeeper, hurrying across the room in\r\ngreat indignation. "Why don\'t you look? why don\'t you stop him? He\'s\r\nbreaking open the musical box. Be quiet, Sir! How dare you touch me?"\r\n\r\n"Set him going! set him going!" reiterated Uncle Joseph, dropping Mrs.\r\nPentreath\'s arm, which he had seized in his agitation. "Look here!\r\nthis by my side is a music box too! Set him going! Does he play\r\nMozart? He is three times bigger than ever I saw! See! see! this box\r\nof mine--this tiny bit of box that looks nothing by the side of\r\nyours--it was given to my own brother by the king of all\r\nmusic-composers that ever lived, by the divine Mozart himself. Set the\r\nbig box going, and you shall hear the little baby-box pipe after! Ah,\r\ndear and good madam, if you love me--"\r\n\r\n"Sir!!!" exclaimed the housekeeper, reddening with virtuous\r\nindignation to the very roots of her hair.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Sir, by addressing such outrageous language as that\r\nto a respectable female?" inquired Mr. Munder, approaching to the\r\nrescue. "Do you think we want your foreign noises, and your foreign\r\nmorals, and your foreign profanity here? Yes, Sir! profanity. Any man\r\nwho calls any human individual, whether musical or otherwise,\r\n\'divine,\' is a profane man. Who are you, you extremely audacious\r\nperson? Are you an infidel?"\r\n\r\nBefore Uncle Joseph could say a word in vindication of his principles,\r\nbefore Mr. Munder could relieve himself of any more indignation, they\r\nwere both startled into momentary silence by an exclamation of alarm\r\nfrom the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" cried Mrs. Pentreath, standing in the middle of the\r\ndrawing-room, and looking with bewildered eyes all around her.\r\n\r\nThe lady in the quiet dress had vanished.\r\n\r\nShe was not in the library, not in the breakfast-room, not in the\r\npassage outside. After searching in those three places, the\r\nhousekeeper came back to Mr. Munder with a look of downright terror in\r\nher face, and stood staring at him for a moment perfectly helpless and\r\nperfectly silent. As soon as she recovered herself she turned fiercely\r\non Uncle Joseph.\r\n\r\n"Where is she? I insist on knowing what has become of her! You\r\ncunning, wicked, impudent old man! where is she?" cried Mrs.\r\nPentreath, with no color in her cheeks and no mercy in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is looking about the house by herself," said Uncle\r\nJoseph. "We shall find her surely as we take our walks through the\r\nother rooms." Simple as he was, the old man had, nevertheless,\r\nacuteness enough to perceive that he had accidentally rendered the\r\nvery service to his niece of which she stood in need. If he had been\r\nthe most artful of mankind, he could have devised no better means of\r\ndiverting Mrs. Pentreath\'s attention from Sarah to himself than the\r\nvery means which he had just used in perfect innocence, at the very\r\nmoment when his thoughts were farthest away from the real object with\r\nwhich he and his niece had entered the house. "So! so!" thought Uncle\r\nJoseph to himself, "while these two angry people were scolding me for\r\nnothing, Sarah has slipped away to the room where the letter is. Good!\r\nI have only to wait till she comes back, and to let the two angry\r\npeople go on scolding me as long as they please."\r\n\r\n"What are we to do? Mr. Munder! what on earth are we to do?" asked the\r\nhousekeeper. "We can\'t waste the precious minutes staring at each\r\nother here. This woman must be found. Stop! she asked questions about\r\nthe stairs--she looked up at the second floor the moment we got on the\r\nlanding. Mr. Munder! wait here, and don\'t let that foreigner out of\r\nyour sight for a moment. Wait here while I run up and look into the\r\nsecond-floor passage. All the bedroom doors are locked--I defy her to\r\nhide herself if she has gone up there." With those words, the\r\nhousekeeper ran out of the drawing-room, and breathlessly ascended the\r\nsecond flight of stairs.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Pentreath was searching on the west side of the house,\r\nSarah was hurrying, at the top of her speed, along the lonely passages\r\nthat led to the north rooms.\r\n\r\nTerrified into decisive action by the desperate nature of the\r\nsituation, she had slipped out of the drawing-room into the passage\r\nthe instant she saw Mrs. Pentreath\'s back turned on her. Without\r\nstopping to think, without attempting to compose herself, she ran down\r\nthe stairs of the first floor, and made straight for the housekeeper\'s\r\nroom. She had no excuses ready, if she had found any body there, or if\r\nshe had met any body on the way. She had formed no plan where to seek\r\nfor them next, if the keys of the north rooms were not hanging in the\r\nplace where she still expected to find them. Her mind was lost in\r\nconfusion, her temples throbbed as if they would burst with the heat\r\nat her brain. The one blind, wild, headlong purpose of getting into\r\nthe Myrtle Room drove her on, gave unnatural swiftness to her\r\ntrembling feet, unnatural strength to her shaking hands, unnatural\r\ncourage to her sinking heart.\r\n\r\nShe ran into the housekeeper\'s room, without even the ordinary caution\r\nof waiting for a moment to listen outside the door. No one was there.\r\nOne glance at the well-remembered nail in the wall showed her the keys\r\nstill hanging to it in a bunch, as they had hung in the long-past\r\ntime. She had them in her possession in a moment; and was away again,\r\nalong the solitary passages that led to the north rooms, threading\r\ntheir turnings and windings as if she had left them but the day\r\nbefore; never pausing to listen or to look behind her, never\r\nslackening her speed till she was at the top of the back staircase,\r\nand had her hand on the locked door that led into the north hall.\r\n\r\nAs she turned over the bunch to find the first key that was required,\r\nshe discovered--what her hurry had hitherto prevented her from\r\nnoticing--the numbered labels which the builder had methodically\r\nattached to all the keys when he had been sent to Porthgenna by Mr.\r\nFrankland to survey the house. At the first sight of them, her\r\nsearching hands paused in their work instantaneously, and she shivered\r\nall over, as if a sudden chill had struck her.\r\n\r\nIf she had been less violently agitated, the discovery of the new\r\nlabels and the suspicions to which the sight of them instantly gave\r\nrise would, in all probability, have checked her further progress. But\r\nthe confusion of her mind was now too great to allow her to piece\r\ntogether even the veriest fragments of thoughts. Vaguely conscious of\r\na new terror, of a sharpened distrust that doubled and trebled the\r\nheadlong impatience which had driven her on thus far, she desperately\r\nresumed her search through the bunch of keys.\r\n\r\nOne of them had no label; it was larger than the rest--it was the key\r\nthat fitted the door of communication before which she stood. She\r\nturned it in the rusty lock with a strength which, at any other time,\r\nshe would have been utterly incapable of exerting; she opened the door\r\nwith a blow of her hand, which burst it away at one stroke from the\r\njambs to which it stuck. Panting for breath, she flew across the\r\nforsaken north hall, without stopping for one second to push the door\r\nto behind her. The creeping creatures, the noisome house-reptiles that\r\npossessed the place, crawled away, shadow-like, on either side of her\r\ntoward the walls. She never noticed them, never turned away for them.\r\nAcross the hall, and up the stairs at the end of it, she ran, till she\r\ngained the open landing at the top--and there she suddenly checked\r\nherself in front of the first door.\r\n\r\nThe first door of the long range of rooms that opened on the landing;\r\nthe door that fronted the topmost of the flight of stairs. She\r\nstopped; she looked at it--it was not the door she had come to open;\r\nand yet she could not tear herself away from it. Scrawled on the panel\r\nin white chalk was the figure--"I." And when she looked down at the\r\nbunch of keys in her hands, there was the figure "I." on a label,\r\nanswering to it.\r\n\r\nShe tried to think, to follow out any one of all the thronging\r\nsuspicions that beset her to the conclusion at which it might point.\r\nThe effort was useless; her mind was gone; her bodily senses of seeing\r\nand hearing--senses which had now become painfully and incomprehensibly\r\nsharpened--seemed to be the sole relics of intelligence that she had\r\nleft to guide her. She put her hand over her eyes, and waited a little\r\nso, and then went on slowly along the landing, looking at the doors.\r\n\r\nNo. "II.," No. "III.," No. "IV.," traced on the panels in the same\r\nwhite chalk, and answering to the numbered labels on the keys, the\r\nfigures on which were written in ink. No. "IV." the middle room of the\r\nfirst floor range of eight. She stopped there again, trembling from\r\nhead to foot. It was the door of the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\nDid the chalked numbers stop there? She looked on down the landing.\r\nNo. The four doors remaining were regularly numbered on to "VIII."\r\n\r\nShe came back again to the door of the Myrtle Room, sought out the key\r\nlabeled with the figure "IV."--hesitated--and looked back\r\ndistrustfully over the deserted hall.\r\n\r\nThe canvases of the old family pictures, which she had seen bulging\r\nout of their frames in the past time when she hid the letter, had, for\r\nthe most part, rotted away from them now, and lay in great black\r\nragged strips on the floor of the hall. Islands and continents of damp\r\nspread like the map of some strange region over the lofty vaulted\r\nceiling. Cobwebs, heavy with dust, hung down in festoons from broken\r\ncornices. Dirt stains lay on the stone pavement, like gross\r\nreflections of the damp stains on the ceiling. The broad flight of\r\nstairs leading up to the open landing before the rooms of the first\r\nfloor had sunk down bodily toward one side. The banisters which\r\nprotected the outer edge of the landing were broken away into ragged\r\ngaps. The light of day was stained, the air of heaven was stilled, the\r\nsounds of earth were silenced in the north hall.\r\n\r\nSilenced? Were _all_ sounds silenced? Or was there something stirring\r\nthat just touched the sense of hearing, that just deepened the dismal\r\nstillness, and no more?\r\n\r\nSarah listened, keeping her face still set toward the hall--listened,\r\nand heard a faint sound behind her. Was it outside the door on which\r\nher back was turned? Or was it inside--in the Myrtle Room?\r\n\r\nInside. With the first conviction of that, all thought, all sensation\r\nleft her. She forgot the suspicious numbering of the doors; she became\r\ninsensible to the lapse of time, unconscious of the risk of discovery.\r\nAll exercise of her other faculties was now merged in the exercise of\r\nthe one faculty of listening.\r\n\r\nIt was a still, faint, stealthily rustling sound; and it moved to and\r\nfro at intervals, to and fro softly, now at one end, now at the other\r\nof the Myrtle Room. There were moments when it grew suddenly\r\ndistinct--other moments when it died away in gradations too light to\r\nfollow. Sometimes it seemed to sweep over the floor at a\r\nbound--sometimes it crept with slow, continuous rustlings that just\r\nwavered on the verge of absolute silence.\r\n\r\nHer feet still rooted to the spot on which she stood, Sarah turned her\r\nhead slowly, inch by inch, toward the door of the Myrtle Room. A\r\nmoment before, while she was as yet unconscious of the faint sound\r\nmoving to and fro within it, she had been drawing her breath heavily\r\nand quickly. She might have been dead now, her bosom was so still, her\r\nbreathing so noiseless. The same mysterious change came over her face\r\nwhich had altered it when the darkness began to gather in the little\r\nparlor at Truro. The same fearful look of inquiry which she had then\r\nfixed on the vacant corner of the room was in her eyes now, as they\r\nslowly turned on the door.\r\n\r\n"Mistress!" she whispered. "Am I too late? _Are you there before me?_"\r\n\r\nThe stealthily rustling sound inside paused--renewed itself--died away\r\nagain faintly; away at the lower end of the room.\r\n\r\nHer eyes still remained fixed on the Myrtle Room, strained, and opened\r\nwider and wider--opened as if they would look through the very door\r\nitself--opened as if they were watching for the opaque wood to turn\r\ntransparent, and show what was behind it.\r\n\r\n"Over the lonesome floor, over the lonesome floor--how light it\r\nmoves!" she whispered again. "Mistress! does the black dress I made\r\nfor you rustle no louder than that?"\r\n\r\nThe sound stopped again--then suddenly advanced at one stealthy sweep\r\nclose to the inside of the door.\r\n\r\nIf she could have moved at that moment; if she could have looked down\r\nto the line of open space between the bottom of the door and the\r\nflooring below, when the faintly rustling sound came nearest to her,\r\nshe might have seen the insignificant cause that produced it lying\r\nself-betrayed under the door, partly outside, partly inside, in the\r\nshape of a fragment of faded red paper from the wall of the Myrtle\r\nRoom. Time and damp had loosened the paper all round the apartment.\r\nTwo or three yards of it had been torn off by the builder while he was\r\nexamining the walls--sometimes in large pieces, sometimes in small\r\npieces, just as it happened to come away--and had been thrown down by\r\nhim on the bare, boarded floor, to become the sport of the wind,\r\nwhenever it happened to blow through the broken panes of glass in the\r\nwindow. If she had only moved! If she had only looked down for one\r\nlittle second of time!\r\n\r\nShe was past moving and past looking: the paroxysm of superstitious\r\nhorror that possessed her held her still in every limb and every\r\nfeature. She never started, she uttered no cry, when the rustling\r\nnoise came nearest. The one outward sign which showed how the terror\r\nof its approach shook her to the very soul expressed itself only in\r\nthe changed action of her right hand, in which she still held the\r\nkeys. At the instant when the wind wafted the fragment of paper\r\nclosest to the door, her fingers lost their power of contraction, and\r\nbecame as nerveless and helpless as if she had fainted. The heavy\r\nbunch of keys slipped from her suddenly loosened grasp, dropped at her\r\nside on the outer edge of the landing, rolled off through a gap in the\r\nbroken banister, and fell on the stone pavement below, with a crash\r\nwhich made the sleeping echoes shriek again, as if they were sentient\r\nbeings writhing under the torture of sound!\r\n\r\nThe crash of the falling keys, ringing and ringing again through the\r\nstillness, woke her, as it were, to instant consciousness of present\r\nevents and present perils. She started, staggered backward, and raised\r\nboth her hands wildly to her head--paused so for a few seconds--then\r\nmade for the top of the stairs with the purpose of descending into the\r\nhall to recover the keys.\r\n\r\nBefore she had advanced three paces the shrill sound of a woman\'s\r\nscream came from the door of communication at the opposite end of the\r\nhall. The scream was twice repeated at a greater distance off, and was\r\nfollowed by a confused noise of rapidly advancing voices and\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nShe staggered desperately a few paces farther, and reached the first\r\nof the row of doors that opened on the landing. There nature sank\r\nexhausted: her knees gave way under her--her breath, her sight, her\r\nhearing all seemed to fail her together at the same instant--and she\r\ndropped down senseless on the floor at the head of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMR. MUNDER ON THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murmuring voices and the hurrying footsteps came nearer and\r\nnearer, then stopped altogether. After an interval of silence, one\r\nvoice called out loudly, "Sarah! Sarah! where are you?" and the next\r\ninstant Uncle Joseph appeared alone in the door-way that led into the\r\nnorth hall, looking eagerly all round him.\r\n\r\nAt first the prostrate figure on the landing at the head of the stairs\r\nescaped his view. But the second time he looked in that direction the\r\ndark dress, and the arm that lay just over the edge of the top stair,\r\ncaught his eye. With a loud cry of terror and recognition, he flew\r\nacross the hall and ascended the stairs. Just as he was kneeling by\r\nSarah\'s side, and raising her head on his arm, the steward, the\r\nhousekeeper, and the maid, all three crowded together after him into\r\nthe door-way.\r\n\r\n"Water!" shouted the old man, gesticulating at them wildly with his\r\ndisengaged hand. "She is here--she has fallen down--she is in a faint!\r\nWater! water!"\r\n\r\nMr. Munder looked at Mrs. Pentreath, Mrs. Pentreath looked at Betsey,\r\nBetsey looked at the ground. All three stood stock-still; all three\r\nseemed equally incapable of walking across the hall. If the science of\r\nphysiognomy be not an entire delusion, the cause of this amazing\r\nunanimity was legibly written in their faces; in other words, they all\r\nthree looked equally afraid of the ghost.\r\n\r\n"Water, I say! Water!" reiterated Uncle Joseph, shaking his fist at\r\nthem. "She is in a faint! Are you three at the door there, and not one\r\nheart of mercy among you? Water! water! water! Must I scream myself\r\ninto fits before I can make you hear?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get the water, ma\'am," said Betsey, "if you or Mr. Munder will\r\nplease to take it from here to the top of the stairs."\r\n\r\nShe ran to the kitchen, and came back with a glass of water, which she\r\noffered, with a respectful courtesy, first to the housekeeper, and\r\nthen to the steward.\r\n\r\n"How dare you ask us to carry things for you?" said Mrs. Pentreath,\r\nbacking out of the door-way.\r\n\r\n"Yes! how dare you ask us?" added Mr. Munder, backing after Mrs.\r\nPentreath.\r\n\r\n"Water!" shouted the old man for the third time. He drew his niece\r\nbackward a little, so that she could be supported against the wall\r\nbehind her. "Water! or I trample down this dungeon of a place about\r\nyour ears!" he shouted, stamping with impatience and rage.\r\n\r\n"If you please, Sir, are you sure it\'s really the lady who is up\r\nthere?" asked Betsey, advancing a few paces tremulously with the glass\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n"Am I sure?" exclaimed Uncle Joseph, descending the stairs to meet\r\nher. "What fool\'s question is this? Who should it be?"\r\n\r\n"The ghost, Sir," said Betsey, advancing more and more slowly. "The\r\nghost of the north rooms."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph met her a few yards in advance of the foot of the stairs,\r\ntook the glass of water from her with a gesture of contempt, and\r\nhastened back to his niece. As Betsey turned to effect her retreat,\r\nthe bunch of keys lying on the pavement below the landing caught her\r\neye. After a little hesitation she mustered courage enough to pick\r\nthem up, and then ran with them out of the hall as fast as her feet\r\ncould carry her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Uncle Joseph was moistening his niece\'s lips with the water,\r\nand sprinkling it over her forehead. After a while her breath began to\r\ncome and go slowly, in faint sighs, the muscles of her face moved a\r\nlittle, and she feebly opened her eyes. They fixed affrightedly on the\r\nold man, without any expression of recognition. He made her drink a\r\nlittle water, and spoke to her gently, and so brought her back at last\r\nto herself. Her first words were, "Don\'t leave me." Her first action,\r\nwhen she was able to move, was the action of crouching closer to him.\r\n\r\n"No fear, my child," he said, soothingly; "I will keep by you. Tell\r\nme, Sarah, what has made you faint? What has frightened you so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t ask me! For God\'s sake, don\'t ask me!"\r\n\r\n"There, there! I shall say nothing, then. Another mouthful of water? A\r\nlittle mouthful more?"\r\n\r\n"Help me up, uncle; help me to try if I can stand."\r\n\r\n"Not yet--not quite yet; patience for a little longer."\r\n\r\n"Oh, help me! help me! I want to get away from the sight of those\r\ndoors. If I can only go as far as the bottom of the stairs I shall be\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"So, so," said Uncle Joseph, assisting her to rise. "Wait now, and\r\nfeel your feet on the ground. Lean on me, lean hard, lean heavy.\r\nThough I am only a light and a little man, I am solid as a rock. Have\r\nyou been into the room?" he added, in a whisper. "Have you got the\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nShe sighed bitterly, and laid her head on his shoulder with a weary\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n"Why, Sarah! Sarah!" he exclaimed. "Have you been all this time away,\r\nand not got into the room yet?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her head as suddenly as she had laid it down, shuddered,\r\nand tried feebly to draw him toward the stairs. "I shall never see the\r\nMyrtle Room again--never, never, never more!" she said. "Let us go; I\r\ncan walk; I am strong now. Uncle Joseph, if you love me, take me away\r\nfrom this house; away any where, so long as we are in the free air and\r\nthe daylight again; any where, so long as we are out of sight of\r\nPorthgenna Tower."\r\n\r\nElevating his eyebrows in astonishment, but considerately refraining\r\nfrom asking any more questions, Uncle Joseph assisted his niece to\r\ndescend the stairs. She was still so weak that she was obliged to\r\npause on gaining the bottom of them to recover her strength. Seeing\r\nthis, and feeling, as he led her afterward across the hall, that she\r\nleaned more and more heavily on his arm at every fresh step, the old\r\nman, on arriving within speaking distance of Mr. Munder and Mrs.\r\nPentreath, asked the housekeeper if she possessed any restorative\r\ndrops which she would allow him to administer to his niece.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath\'s reply in the affirmative, though not very graciously\r\nspoken, was accompanied by an alacrity of action which showed that she\r\nwas heartily rejoiced to take the first fair excuse for returning to\r\nthe inhabited quarter of the house. Muttering something about showing\r\nthe way to the place where the medicine-chest was kept, she\r\nimmediately retraced her steps along the passage to her own room;\r\nwhile Uncle Joseph, disregarding all Sarah\'s whispered assurances that\r\nshe was well enough to depart without another moment of delay,\r\nfollowed her silently, leading his niece.\r\n\r\nMr. Munder, shaking his head, and looking woefully disconcerted,\r\nwaited behind to lock the door of communication. When he had done\r\nthis, and had given the keys to Betsey to carry back to their\r\nappointed place, he, in his turn, retired from the scene at a pace\r\nindecorously approaching to something like a run. On getting well away\r\nfrom the north hall, however, he regained his self-possession\r\nwonderfully. He abruptly slackened his pace, collected his scattered\r\nwits, and reflected a little, apparently with perfect satisfaction to\r\nhimself; for when he entered the housekeeper\'s room he had quite\r\nrecovered his usual complacent solemnity of look and manner. Like the\r\nvast majority of densely stupid men, he felt intense pleasure in\r\nhearing himself talk, and he now discerned such an opportunity of\r\nindulging in that luxury, after the events that had just happened in\r\nthe house, as he seldom enjoyed. There is only one kind of speaker who\r\nis quite certain never to break down under any stress of\r\ncircumstances--the man whose capability of talking does not include\r\nany dangerous underlying capacity for knowing what he means. Among\r\nthis favored order of natural orators, Mr. Munder occupied a prominent\r\nrank--and he was now vindictively resolved to exercise his abilities\r\non the two strangers, under pretense of asking for an explanation of\r\ntheir conduct, before he could suffer them to quit the house.\r\n\r\nOn entering the room, he found Uncle Joseph seated with his niece at\r\nthe lower end of it, engaged in dropping some sal volatile into a\r\nglass of water. At the upper end stood the housekeeper with an open\r\nmedicine-chest on the table before her. To this part of the room Mr.\r\nMunder slowly advanced, with a portentous countenance; drew an\r\narm-chair up to the table; sat himself down in it, with extreme\r\ndeliberation and care in the matter of settling his coat-tails; and\r\nimmediately became, to all outward appearance, the model of a Lord\r\nChief Justice in plain clothes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentreath, conscious from these preparations that something\r\nextraordinary was about to happen, seated herself a little behind the\r\nsteward. Betsey restored the keys to their place on the nail in the\r\nwall, and was about to retire modestly to her proper kitchen sphere,\r\nwhen she was stopped by Mr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"Wait, if you please," said the steward; "I shall have occasion to\r\ncall on you presently, young woman, to make a plain statement."\r\n\r\nObedient Betsey waited near the door, terrified by the idea that she\r\nmust have done something wrong, and that the steward was armed with\r\ninscrutable legal power to try, sentence, and punish her for the\r\noffense on the spot.\r\n\r\n"Now, Sir," said Mr. Munder, addressing Uncle Joseph as if he was the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, "if you have done with that sal\r\nvolatile, and if the person by your side has sufficiently recovered\r\nher senses to listen, I should wish to say a word or two to both of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAt this exordium, Sarah tried affrightedly to rise from her chair; but\r\nher uncle caught her by the hand, and pressed her back in it.\r\n\r\n"Wait and rest," he whispered. "I shall take all the scolding on my\r\nown shoulder, and do all the talking with my own tongue. As soon as\r\nyou are fit to walk again, I promise you this: whether the big man has\r\nsaid his word or two, or has not said it, we will quietly get up and\r\ngo our ways out of the house."\r\n\r\n"Up to the present moment," said Mr. Munder, "I have refrained from\r\nexpressing an opinion. The time has now come when, holding a position\r\nof trust as I do in this establishment, and being accountable, and\r\nindeed responsible, as I am, for what takes place in it, and feeling,\r\nas I must, that things can not be allowed or even permitted to rest as\r\nthey are--it is my duty to say that I think your conduct is very\r\nextraordinary." Directing this forcible conclusion to his sentence\r\nstraight at Sarah, Mr. Munder leaned back in his chair, quite full of\r\nwords, and quite empty of meaning, to collect himself comfortably for\r\nhis next effort.\r\n\r\n"My only desire," he resumed, with a plaintive impartiality, "is to\r\nact fairly by all parties. I don\'t wish to frighten any body, or to\r\nstartle any body, or even to terrify any body. I wish to unravel, or,\r\nif you please, to make out, what I may term, with perfect\r\npropriety--events. And when I have done that, I should wish to put it\r\nto you, ma\'am, and to you, Sir, whether--I say, I should wish to put\r\nit to you both, calmly, and impartially, and politely, and plainly,\r\nand smoothly--and when I say smoothly, I mean quietly--whether you are\r\nnot both of you bound to explain yourselves."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder paused, to let that last irresistible appeal work its way\r\nto the consciences of the persons whom he addressed. The housekeeper\r\ntook advantage of the silence to cough, as congregations cough just\r\nbefore the sermon, apparently on the principle of getting rid of\r\nbodily infirmities beforehand, in order to give the mind free play for\r\nundisturbed intellectual enjoyment. Betsey, following Mrs. Pentreath\'s\r\nlead, indulged in a cough on her own account--of the faint,\r\ndistrustful sort. Uncle Joseph sat perfectly easy and undismayed,\r\nstill holding his niece\'s hand in his, and giving it a little squeeze,\r\nfrom time to time, when the steward\'s oratory became particularly\r\ninvolved and impressive. Sarah never moved, never looked up, never\r\nlost the expression of terrified restraint which had taken possession\r\nof her face from the first moment when she entered the housekeeper\'s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Now what are the facts, and circumstances, and events?" proceeded Mr.\r\nMunder, leaning back in his chair, in calm enjoyment of the sound of\r\nhis own voice. "You, ma\'am, and you, Sir, ring at the bell of the door\r\nof this Mansion" (here he looked hard at Uncle Joseph, as much as to\r\nsay, "I don\'t give up that point about the house being a Mansion, you\r\nsee, even on the judgment-seat")--"you are let in, or, rather,\r\nadmitted. You, Sir, assert that you wish to inspect the Mansion (you\r\nsay \'see the house,\' but, being a foreigner, we are not surprised at\r\nyour making a little mistake of that sort); you, ma\'am, coincide, and\r\neven agree, in that request. What follows? You are shown over the\r\nMansion. It is not usual to show strangers over it, but we happen to\r\nhave certain reasons--"\r\n\r\nSarah started. "What reasons?" she asked, looking up quickly.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph felt her hand turn cold, and tremble in his. "Hush!\r\nhush!" he said, "leave the talking to me."\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mrs. Pentreath pulled Mr. Munder warily by the\r\ncoat-tail, and whispered to him to be careful. "Mrs. Frankland\'s\r\nletter," she said in his ear, "tells us particularly not to let it be\r\nsuspected that we are acting under orders."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you fancy, Mrs. Pentreath, that I forget what I ought to\r\nremember," rejoined Mr. Munder--who had forgotten, nevertheless. "And\r\ndon\'t you imagine that I was going to commit myself" (the very thing\r\nwhich he had just been on the point of doing). "Leave this business in\r\nmy hands, if you will be so good.--What reasons did you say, ma\'am?"\r\nhe added aloud, addressing himself to Sarah. "Never you mind about\r\nreasons; we have not got to do with them now; we have got to do with\r\nfacts, and circumstances, and events. I was observing, or remarking,\r\nthat you, Sir, and you, ma\'am, were shown over this Mansion. You were\r\nconducted, and indeed led, up the west staircase--the Spacious west\r\nstaircase, Sir! You were shown with politeness, and even with\r\ncourtesy, through the breakfast-room, the library, and the\r\ndrawing-room. In that drawing-room, you, Sir, indulge in outrageous,\r\nand, I will add, in violent language. In that drawing-room, you,\r\nma\'am, disappear, or, rather, go altogether out of sight. Such conduct\r\nas this, so highly unparalleled, so entirely unprecedented, and so\r\nvery unusual, causes Mrs. Pentreath and myself to feel--" Here Mr.\r\nMunder stopped, at a loss for a word for the first time.\r\n\r\n"Astonished," suggested Mrs. Pentreath after a long interval of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am!" retorted Mr. Munder. "Nothing of the sort. We were not at\r\nall astonished; we were--surprised. And what followed and succeeded\r\nthat? What did you and I hear, Sir, on the first floor?" (looking\r\nsternly at Uncle Joseph). "And what did you hear, Mrs. Pentreath,\r\nwhile you were searching for the missing and absent party on the\r\nsecond floor? What?"\r\n\r\nThus personally appealed to, the housekeeper answered briefly--"A\r\nscream."\r\n\r\n"No! no! no!" said Mr. Munder, fretfully tapping his hand on the\r\ntable. "A screech, Mrs. Pentreath--a screech. And what is the meaning,\r\npurport, and upshot of that screech?--Young woman!" (here Mr. Munder\r\nturned suddenly on Betsey) "we have now traced these extraordinary\r\nfacts and circumstances as far as you. Have the goodness to step\r\nforward, and tell us, in the presence of these two parties, how you\r\ncame to utter, or give, what Mrs. Pentreath calls a scream, but what I\r\ncall a screech. A plain statement will do, my good girl--quite a plain\r\nstatement, if you please. And, young woman, one word more--speak up.\r\nYou understand me? Speak up!"\r\n\r\nCovered with confusion by the public and solemn nature of this appeal,\r\nBetsey, on starting with her statement, unconsciously followed the\r\noratorical example of no less a person than Mr. Munder himself; that\r\nis to say, she spoke on the principle of drowning the smallest\r\npossible infusion of ideas in the largest possible dilution of words.\r\nExtricated from the mesh of verbal entanglement in which she contrived\r\nto involve it, her statement may be not unfairly represented as simply\r\nconsisting of the following facts:\r\n\r\nFirst, Betsey had to relate that she happened to be just taking the\r\nlid off a saucepan, on the kitchen fire, when she heard, in the\r\nneighborhood of the housekeeper\'s room, a sound of hurried footsteps\r\n(vernacularly termed by the witness a "scurrying of somebody\'s feet").\r\nSecondly, Betsey, on leaving the kitchen to ascertain what the sound\r\nmeant, heard the footsteps retreating rapidly along the passage which\r\nled to the north side of the house, and, stimulated by curiosity,\r\nfollowed the sound of them for a certain distance. Thirdly, at a sharp\r\nturn in the passage, Betsey stopped short, despairing of overtaking\r\nthe person whose footsteps she heard, and feeling also a sense of\r\ndread (termed by the witness, "creeping of the flesh") at the idea of\r\nventuring alone, even in broad daylight, into the ghostly quarter of\r\nthe house. Fourthly, while still hesitating at the turn in the\r\npassage, Betsey heard "the lock of a door go," and, stimulated afresh\r\nby curiosity, advanced a few steps farther--then stopped again,\r\ndebating within herself the difficult and dreadful question, whether\r\nit is the usual custom of ghosts, when passing from one place to\r\nanother, to unlock any closed door which may happen to be in their\r\nway, or to save trouble by simply passing through it. Fifthly, after\r\nlong deliberation, and many false starts--forward toward the north\r\nhall and backward toward the kitchen--Betsey decided that it was the\r\nimmemorial custom of all ghosts to pass through doors, and not unlock\r\nthem. Sixthly, fortified by this conviction, Betsey went on boldly\r\nclose to the door, when she suddenly heard a loud report, as of some\r\nheavy body falling (graphically termed by the witness a "banging\r\nscrash"). Seventhly, the noise frightened Betsey out of her wits,\r\nbrought her heart up into her mouth, and took away her breath.\r\nEighthly, and lastly, on recovering breath enough to scream (or\r\nscreech), Betsey did, with might and main, scream (or screech),\r\nrunning back toward the kitchen as fast as her legs would carry her,\r\nwith all her hair "standing up on end," and all her flesh "in a crawl"\r\nfrom the crown of her head to the soles of her feet.\r\n\r\n"Just so! just so!" said Mr. Munder, when the statement came to a\r\nclose--as if the sight of a young woman with all her hair standing on\r\nend and all her flesh in a crawl were an ordinary result of his\r\nexperience of female humanity--"Just so! You may stand back, my good\r\ngirl--you may stand back.--There is nothing to smile at, Sir," he\r\ncontinued, sternly addressing Uncle Joseph, who had been excessively\r\namused by Betsey\'s manner of delivering her evidence. "You would be\r\ndoing better to carry, or rather transport, your mind back to what\r\nfollowed and succeeded the young woman\'s screech. What did we all do,\r\nSir? We rushed to the spot, and we ran to the place. And what did we\r\nall see, Sir?--We saw _you_, ma\'am, lying horizontally prostrate, on\r\nthe top of the landing of the first of the flight of the north stairs;\r\nand we saw those keys, now hanging up yonder, abstracted and\r\npurloined, and, as it were, snatched from their place in this room,\r\nand lying horizontally prostrate likewise on the floor of the\r\nhall.--There are the facts, the circumstances, and the events, laid,\r\nor rather placed, before you. What have you got to say to them? I call\r\nupon you both solemnly, and, I will add, seriously! In my own name, in\r\nthe name of Mrs. Pentreath, in the name of our employers, in the name\r\nof decency, in the name of wonder--what do you mean by it?"\r\n\r\nWith that conclusion, Mr. Munder struck his fist on the table, and\r\nwaited, with a glare of merciless expectation, for any thing in the\r\nshape of an answer, an explanation, or a defense which the culprits at\r\nthe bottom of the room might be disposed to offer.\r\n\r\n"Tell him any thing," whispered Sarah to the old man. "Any thing to\r\nkeep him quiet; any thing to make him let us go! After what I have\r\nsuffered, these people will drive me mad!"\r\n\r\nNever very quick at inventing an excuse, and perfectly ignorant\r\nbesides of what had really happened to his niece while she was alone\r\nin the north hall, Uncle Joseph, with the best will in the world to\r\nprove himself equal to the emergency, felt considerable difficulty in\r\ndeciding what he should say or do. Determined, however, at all\r\nhazards, to spare Sarah any useless suffering, and to remove her from\r\nthe house as speedily as possible, he rose to take the responsibility\r\nof speaking on himself, looking hard, before he opened his lips, at\r\nMr. Munder, who immediately leaned forward on the table with his hand\r\nto his ear. Uncle Joseph acknowledged this polite act of attention\r\nwith one of his fantastic bows; and then replied to the whole of the\r\nsteward\'s long harangue in these six unanswerable words:\r\n\r\n"I wish you good-day, Sir!"\r\n\r\n"How dare you wish me any thing of the sort!" cried Mr. Munder,\r\njumping out of his chair in violent indignation. "How dare you trifle\r\nwith a serious subject and a serious question in that way? Wish me\r\ngood-day, indeed! Do you suppose I am going to let you out of this\r\nhouse without hearing some explanation of the abstracting and\r\npurloining and snatching of the keys of the north rooms?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is that you want to know?" said Uncle Joseph, stimulated to\r\nplunge headlong into an excuse by the increasing agitation and terror\r\nof his niece. "See, now! I shall explain. What was it, dear and good\r\nSir, that we said when we were first let in? This--\'We have come to\r\nsee the house.\' Now there is a north side to the house, and a west\r\nside to the house. Good! That is two sides; and I and my niece are two\r\npeople; and we divide ourselves in two, to see the two sides. I am the\r\nhalf that goes west, with you and the dear and good lady behind there.\r\nMy niece here is the other half that goes north, all by herself, and\r\ndrops the keys, and falls into a faint, because in that old part of\r\nthe house it is what you call musty-fusty, and there is smells of\r\ntombs and spiders, and that is all the explanation, and quite enough,\r\ntoo. I wish you good-day, Sir."\r\n\r\n"Damme! if ever I met with the like of you before!" roared Mr. Munder,\r\nentirely forgetting his dignity, his respectability, and his long\r\nwords in the exasperation of the moment. "You are going to have it all\r\nyour own way, are you, Mr. Foreigner? You will walk out of this place\r\nwhen you please, will you, Mr. Foreigner? We will see what the justice\r\nof the peace for this district has to say to that," cried Mr. Munder,\r\nrecovering his solemn manner and his lofty phraseology. "Property in\r\nthis house is confided to my care; and unless I hear some satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the purloining of those keys hanging up there, Sir, on\r\nthat wall, Sir, before your eyes, Sir--I shall consider it my duty to\r\ndetain you, and the person with you, until I can get legal advice, and\r\nlawful advice, and magisterial advice. Do you hear that, Sir?"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph\'s ruddy cheeks suddenly deepened in color, and his face\r\nassumed an expression which made the housekeeper rather uneasy, and\r\nwhich had an irresistibly cooling effect on the heat of Mr. Munder\'s\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n"You will keep us here? _You?_" said the old man, speaking very\r\nquietly, and looking very steadily at the steward. "Now, see. I take\r\nthis lady (courage, my child, courage! there is nothing to tremble\r\nfor)--I take this lady with me; I throw that door open, so! I stand\r\nand wait before it; and I say to you, \'Shut that door against us, if\r\nyou dare.\'"\r\n\r\nAt this defiance, Mr. Munder advanced a few steps, and then stopped.\r\nIf Uncle Joseph\'s steady look at him had wavered for an instant, he\r\nwould have closed the door.\r\n\r\n"I say again," repeated the old man, "shut it against us, if you dare.\r\nThe laws and customs of your country, Sir, have made me an Englishman.\r\nIf you can talk into one ear of a magistrate, I can talk into the\r\nother. If he must listen to you, a citizen of this country, he must\r\nlisten to me, a citizen of this country also. Say the word, if you\r\nplease. Do you accuse? or do you threaten? or do you shut the door?"\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Munder could reply to any one of these three direct\r\nquestions, the housekeeper begged him to return to his chair and to\r\nspeak to her. As he resumed his place, she whispered to him, in\r\nwarning tones, "Remember Mrs. Frankland\'s letter!"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, Uncle Joseph, considering that he had waited long\r\nenough, took a step forward to the door. He was prevented from\r\nadvancing any farther by his niece, who caught him suddenly by the\r\narm, and said in his ear, "Look! they are whispering about us again!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Mr. Munder, replying to the housekeeper. "I do remember\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s letter, ma\'am; and what then?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! not so loud," whispered Mrs. Pentreath. "I don\'t presume, Mr.\r\nMunder, to differ in opinion with you; but I want to ask one or two\r\nquestions. Do you think we have any charge that a magistrate would\r\nlisten to, to bring against these people?"\r\n\r\nMr. Munder looked puzzled, and seemed, for once in a way, to be at a\r\nloss for an answer.\r\n\r\n"Does what you remember of Mrs. Frankland\'s letter," pursued the\r\nhousekeeper, "incline you to think that she would be pleased at a\r\npublic exposure of what has happened in the house? She tells us to\r\ntake _private_ notice of that woman\'s conduct, and to follow her\r\n_unperceived_ when she goes away. I don\'t venture on the liberty of\r\nadvising you, Mr. Munder, but, as far as regards myself, I wash my\r\nhands of all responsibility, if we do any thing but follow Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s instructions (as she herself tells us) to the letter."\r\n\r\nMr. Munder hesitated. Uncle Joseph, who had paused for a minute when\r\nSarah directed his attention to the whispering at the upper end of the\r\nroom, now drew her on slowly with him to the door. "Betzee, my dear,"\r\nhe said, addressing the maid, with perfect coolness and composure, "we\r\nare strangers here; will you be so kind to us as to show the way out?"\r\n\r\nBetsey looked at the housekeeper, who motioned to her to appeal for\r\norders to the steward. Mr. Munder was sorely tempted, for the sake of\r\nhis own importance, to insist on instantly carrying out the violent\r\nmeasures to which he had threatened to have recourse; but Mrs.\r\nPentreath\'s objections made him pause in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n"Betzee, my dear," repeated Uncle Joseph, "has all this talking been\r\ntoo much for your ears? has it made you deaf?"\r\n\r\n"Wait!" cried Mr. Munder, impatiently. "I insist on your waiting,\r\nSir!"\r\n\r\n"You insist? Well, well, because you are an uncivil man is no reason\r\nwhy I should be an uncivil man too. We will wait a little, Sir, if you\r\nhave any thing more to say." Making that concession to the claims of\r\npoliteness, Uncle Joseph walked gently backward and forward with his\r\nniece in the passage outside the door. "Sarah, my child, I have\r\nfrightened the man of the big words," he whispered. "Try not to\r\ntremble so much; we shall soon be out in the fresh air again."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Mr. Munder continued his whispered conversation with\r\nthe housekeeper, making a desperate effort, in the midst of his\r\nperplexities, to maintain his customary air of patronage and his\r\ncustomary assumption of superiority. "There is a great deal of truth,\r\nma\'am," he softly began--"a great deal of truth, certainly, in what\r\nyou say. But you are talking of the woman, while I am talking of the\r\nman. Do you mean to tell me that I am to let him go, after what has\r\nhappened, without at least insisting on his giving me his name and\r\naddress?"\r\n\r\n"Do you put trust enough in the foreigner to believe that he would\r\ngive you his right name and address if you asked him?" inquired Mrs.\r\nPentreath. "With submission to your better judgment, I must confess\r\nthat I don\'t. But supposing you were to detain him and charge him\r\nbefore the magistrate--and how you are to do that, the magistrate\'s\r\nhouse being, I suppose, about a couple of hours\' walk from here, is\r\nmore than I can tell--you must surely risk offending Mrs. Frankland by\r\ndetaining the woman and charging the woman as well; for after all, Mr.\r\nMunder, though I believe the foreigner to be capable of any thing, it\r\nwas the woman that took the keys, was it not?"\r\n\r\n"Quite so! quite so!" said Mr. Munder, whose sleepy eyes were now\r\nopened to this plain and straightforward view of the case for the\r\nfirst time. "I was, oddly enough, putting that point to myself, Mrs.\r\nPentreath, just before you happened to speak of it. Just so! just so!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help thinking," continued the housekeeper, in a mysterious\r\nwhisper, "that the best plan, and the plan most in accordance with our\r\ninstructions, is to let them both go, as if we did not care to demean\r\nourselves by any more quarreling or arguing with them, and to have\r\nthem followed to the next place they stop at. The gardener\'s boy,\r\nJacob, is weeding the broad walk in the west garden this afternoon.\r\nThese people have not seen him about the premises, and need not see\r\nhim, if they are let out again by the south door. Jacob is a sharp\r\nlad, as you know; and, if he was properly instructed, I really don\'t\r\nsee--"\r\n\r\n"It is a most singular circumstance, Mrs. Pentreath," interposed Mr.\r\nMunder, with the gravity of consummate assurance; "but when I first\r\nsat down to this table, that idea about Jacob occurred to me. What\r\nwith the effort of speaking, and the heat of argument, I got led away\r\nfrom it in the most unaccountable manner--"\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Joseph, whose stock of patience and politeness was getting\r\nexhausted, put his head into the room again.\r\n\r\n"I shall have one last word to address to you, Sir, in a moment," said\r\nMr. Munder, before the old man could speak. "Don\'t you suppose that\r\nyour blustering and your bullying has had any effect on me. It may do\r\nwith foreigners, Sir; but it won\'t do with Englishmen, I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and rejoined his niece in\r\nthe passage outside. While the housekeeper and the steward had been\r\nconferring together, Sarah had been trying hard to persuade her uncle\r\nto profit by her knowledge of the passages that led to the south door,\r\nand to slip away unperceived. But the old man steadily refused to be\r\nguided by her advice. "I will not go out of a place guiltily," he\r\nsaid, "when I have done no harm. Nothing shall persuade me to put\r\nmyself, or to put you, in the wrong. I am not a man of much wits; but\r\nlet my conscience guide me, and so long I shall go right. They let us\r\nin here, Sarah, of their own accord; and they shall let us out of\r\ntheir own accord also."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Munder! Mr. Munder!" whispered the housekeeper, interfering to\r\nstop a fresh explosion of the steward\'s indignation, which threatened\r\nto break out at the contempt implied by the shrugging of Uncle\r\nJoseph\'s shoulders, "while you are speaking to that audacious man,\r\nshall I slip into the garden and give Jacob his instructions?"\r\n\r\nMr. Munder paused before answering--tried hard to see a more dignified\r\nway out of the dilemma in which he had placed himself than the way\r\nsuggested by the housekeeper--failed entirely to discern any thing of\r\nthe sort--swallowed his indignation at one heroic gulp--and replied\r\nemphatically in two words: "Go, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"What does that mean? what has she gone that way for?" said Sarah to\r\nher uncle, in a quick, suspicious whisper, as the housekeeper brushed\r\nhastily by them on her way to the west garden.\r\n\r\nBefore there was time to answer the question, it was followed by\r\nanother, put by Mr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"Now, Sir!" said the steward, standing in the door-way, with his hands\r\nunder his coat-tails and his head very high in the air. "Now, Sir, and\r\nnow, ma\'am, for my last words. Am I to have a proper explanation of\r\nthe abstracting and purloining of those keys, or am I not?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Sir, you are to have the explanation," replied Uncle\r\nJoseph. "It is, if you please, the same explanation that I had the\r\nhonor of giving to you a little while ago. Do you wish to hear it\r\nagain? It is all the explanation we have got about us."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is, is it?" said Mr. Munder. "Then all I have to say to both\r\nof you is--leave the house directly! Directly!" he added, in his most\r\ncoarsely offensive tones, taking refuge in the insolence of authority,\r\nfrom the dim consciousness of the absurdity of his own position, which\r\nwould force itself on him even while he spoke. "Yes, Sir!" he\r\ncontinued, growing more and more angry at the composure with which\r\nUncle Joseph listened to him--"Yes, Sir! you may bow and scrape, and\r\njabber your broken English somewhere else. I won\'t put up with you\r\nhere. I have reflected with myself, and reasoned with myself, and\r\nasked myself calmly--as Englishmen always do--if it is any use making\r\nyou of importance, and I have come to a conclusion, and that\r\nconclusion is--no, it isn\'t! Don\'t you go away with a notion that your\r\nblusterings and bullyings have had any effect on me. (Show them out,\r\nBetsey!) I consider you beneath--aye, and below!--my notice. Language\r\nfails, Sir, to express my contempt. Leave the house!"\r\n\r\n"And I, Sir," returned the object of all this withering derision,\r\nwith the most exasperating politeness, "I shall say, for having your\r\ncontempt, what I could by no means have said for having your respect,\r\nwhich is, briefly--thank you. I, the small foreigner, take the\r\ncontempt of you, the big Englishman, as the greatest compliment that\r\ncan be paid from a man of your composition to a man of mine." With\r\nthat, Uncle Joseph made a last fantastic bow, took his niece\'s arm,\r\nand followed Betsey along the passages that led to the south door,\r\nleaving Mr. Munder to compose a fit retort at his leisure.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the housekeeper returned breathless to her room, and\r\nfound the steward walking backward and forward in a high state of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n"Pray make your mind easy, Mr. Munder," she said. "They are both clear\r\nof the house at last, and Jacob has got them well in view on the path\r\nover the moor."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMOZART PLAYS FAREWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting that he took leave of Betsey, the servant-maid, with great\r\ncordiality, Uncle Joseph spoke not another word, after his parting\r\nreply to Mr. Munder, until he and his niece were alone again under the\r\neast wall of Porthgenna Tower. There he paused, looked up at the\r\nhouse, then at his companion, then back at the house once more, and at\r\nlast opened his lips to speak.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, my child," he said--"I am sorry from my heart. This has\r\nbeen what you call in England a bad job."\r\n\r\nThinking that he referred to the scene which had just passed in the\r\nhousekeeper\'s room, Sarah asked his pardon for having been the\r\ninnocent means of bringing him into angry collision with such a person\r\nas Mr. Munder.\r\n\r\n"No! no! no!" he cried. "I was not thinking of the man of the big body\r\nand the big words. He made me angry, it is not to be denied; but that\r\nis all over and gone now. I put him and his big words away from me, as\r\nI kick this stone, here, from the pathway into the road. It is not of\r\nyour Munders, or your housekeepers, or your Betzees, that I now\r\nspeak--it is of something that is nearer to you and nearer to me also,\r\nbecause I make of your interest my own interest too. I shall tell you\r\nwhat it is while we walk on--for I see in your face, Sarah, that you\r\nare restless and in fear so long as we stop in the neighborhood of\r\nthis dungeon-house. Come! I am ready for the march. There is the path.\r\nLet us go back by it, and pick up our little baggages at the inn where\r\nwe left them, on the other side of this windy wilderness of a place."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, uncle! Let us lose no time; let us walk fast. Don\'t be\r\nafraid of tiring me; I am much stronger now."\r\n\r\nThey turned into the same path by which they had approached Porthgenna\r\nTower in the afternoon. By the time they had walked over a little more\r\nthan the first hundred yards of their journey, Jacob, the gardener\'s\r\nboy, stole out from behind the ruinous inclosure at the north side of\r\nthe house with his hoe in his hand. The sun had just set, but there\r\nwas a fine light still over the wide, open surface of the moor; and\r\nJacob paused to let the old man and his niece get farther away from\r\nthe building before he followed them. The housekeeper\'s instructions\r\nhad directed him just to keep them in sight, and no more; and, if he\r\nhappened to observe that they stopped and turned round to look behind\r\nthem, he was to stop, too, and pretend to be digging with his hoe, as\r\nif he was at work on the moorland. Stimulated by the promise of a\r\nsixpence, if he was careful to do exactly as he had been told, Jacob\r\nkept his instructions in his memory, and kept his eye on the two\r\nstrangers, and promised as fairly to earn the reward in prospect for\r\nhim as a boy could.\r\n\r\n"And now, my child, I shall tell you what it is I am sorry for,"\r\nresumed Uncle Joseph, as they proceeded along the path. "I am sorry\r\nthat we have come out upon this journey, and run our little risk, and\r\nhad our little scolding, and gained nothing. The word you said in my\r\near, Sarah, when I was getting you out of the faint (and you should\r\nhave come out of it sooner, if the muddle-headed people of the\r\ndungeon-house had been quicker with the water)--the word you said in\r\nmy ear was not much, but it was enough to tell me that we have taken\r\nthis journey in vain. I may hold my tongue, I may make my best face at\r\nit, I may be content to walk blindfolded with a mystery that lets no\r\npeep of daylight into my eyes--but it is not the less true that the\r\none thing your heart was most set on doing, when we started on this\r\njourney, is the one thing also that you have not done. I know that,\r\nif I know nothing else; and I say again, it is a bad job--yes, yes,\r\nupon my life and faith, there is no disguise to put upon it; it is, in\r\nyour plainest English, a very bad job."\r\n\r\nAs he concluded the expression of his sympathy in these quaint terms,\r\nthe dread and distrust, the watchful terror, that marred the natural\r\nsoftness of Sarah\'s eyes, disappeared in an expression of sorrowful\r\ntenderness, which seemed to give back to them all their beauty.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be sorry for me, uncle," she said, stopping, and gently\r\nbrushing away with her hand some specks of dust that lay on the collar\r\nof his coat. "I have suffered so much and suffered so long, that the\r\nheaviest disappointments pass lightly over me now."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t hear you say it!" cried Uncle Joseph. "You give me shocks I\r\ncan\'t bear when you talk to me in this way. You shall have no more\r\ndisappointments--no, you shall not! I, Joseph Buschmann, the\r\nObstinate, the Pig-headed, I say it!"\r\n\r\n"The day when I shall have no more disappointments, uncle, is not far\r\noff now. Let me wait a little longer, and endure a little longer: I\r\nhave learned to be patient, and to hope for nothing. Fearing and\r\nfailing, fearing and failing--that has been my life ever since I was a\r\nyoung woman--the life I have become used to by this time. If you are\r\nsurprised, as I know you must be, at my not possessing myself of the\r\nletter, when I had the keys of the Myrtle Room in my hand, and when no\r\none was near to stop me, remember the history of my life, and take\r\nthat as an explanation. Fearing and failing, fearing and failing--if I\r\ntold you all the truth, I could tell no more than that. Let us walk\r\non, uncle."\r\n\r\nThe resignation in her voice and manner while she spoke was the\r\nresignation of despair. It gave her an unnatural self-possession,\r\nwhich altered her, in the eyes of Uncle Joseph, almost past\r\nrecognition. He looked at her in undisguised alarm.\r\n\r\n"No!" he said, "we will not walk on; we will walk back to the\r\ndungeon-house; we will make another plan; we will try to get at this\r\ndevil\'s imp of a letter in some other way. I care for no Munders, no\r\nhousekeepers, no Betzees--I! I care for nothing but the getting you\r\nthe one thing you want, and the taking you home again as easy in your\r\nmind as I am myself. Come! let us go back."\r\n\r\n"It is too late to go back."\r\n\r\n"How too late? Ah, dismal, dingy, dungeon-house of the devil, how I\r\nhate you!" cried Uncle Joseph, looking back over the prospect, and\r\nshaking both his fists at Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\n"It is too late, uncle," she repeated. "Too late, because the\r\nopportunity is lost; too late, because if I could bring it back, I\r\ndare not go near the Myrtle Room again. My last hope was to change the\r\nhiding-place of the letter--and that last hope I have given up. I have\r\nonly one object in life left now; you may help me in it; but I can not\r\ntell you how unless you come on with me at once--unless you say\r\nnothing more about going back to Porthgenna Tower."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph began to expostulate. His niece stopped him in the middle\r\nof a sentence, by touching him on the shoulder and pointing to a\r\nparticular spot on the darkening slope of the moor below them.\r\n\r\n"Look!" she said, "there is somebody on the path behind us. Is it a\r\nboy or a man?"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph looked through the fading light, and saw a figure at some\r\nlittle distance. It seemed like the figure of a boy, and he was\r\napparently engaged in digging on the moor.\r\n\r\n"Let us turn round, and go on at once," pleaded Sarah, before the old\r\nman could answer her. "I can\'t say what I want to say to you, uncle,\r\nuntil we are safe under shelter at the inn."\r\n\r\nThey went on until they reached the highest ground on the moor. There\r\nthey stopped, and looked back again. The rest of their way lay down\r\nhill; and the spot on which they stood was the last point from which a\r\nview could be obtained of Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\n"We have lost sight of the boy," said Uncle Joseph, looking over the\r\nground below them.\r\n\r\nSarah\'s younger and sharper eyes bore witness to the truth of her\r\nuncle\'s words--the view over the moor was lonely now, in every\r\ndirection, as far as she could see. Before going on again, she moved a\r\nlittle away from the old man, and looked at the tower of the ancient\r\nhouse, rising heavy and black in the dim light, with the dark sea\r\nbackground stretching behind it like a wall. "Never again!" she\r\nwhispered to herself. "Never, never, never again!" Her eyes wandered\r\naway to the church, and to the cemetery inclosure by its side, barely\r\ndistinguishable now in the shadows of the coming night. "Wait for me a\r\nlittle longer," she said, looking toward the burial-ground with\r\nstraining eyes, and pressing her hand on her bosom over the place\r\nwhere the book of Hymns lay hid. "My wanderings are nearly at an end;\r\nthe day for my coming home again is not far off!"\r\n\r\nThe tears filled her eyes and shut out the view. She rejoined her\r\nuncle, and, taking his arm again, drew him rapidly a few steps along\r\nthe downward path--then checked herself, as if struck by a sudden\r\nsuspicion, and walked back a few paces to the highest ridge of the\r\nground. "I am not sure," she said, replying to her companion\'s look of\r\nsurprise--"I am not sure whether we have seen the last yet of that boy\r\nwho was differing on the moor."\r\n\r\nAs the words passed her lips, a figure stole out from behind one of\r\nthe large fragments of granite rock which were scattered over the\r\nwaste on all sides of them. It was once more the figure of the boy,\r\nand again he began to dig, without the slightest apparent reason, on\r\nthe barren ground at his feet.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I see," said Uncle Joseph, as his niece eagerly directed\r\nhis attention to the suspicious figure. "It is the same boy, and he is\r\ndigging still--and, if you please, what of that?"\r\n\r\nSarah did not attempt to answer. "Let us get on," she said, hurriedly.\r\n"Let us get on as fast as we can to the inn."\r\n\r\nThey turned again, and took the downward path before them. In less\r\nthan a minute they had lost sight of Porthgenna Tower, of the old\r\nchurch, and of the whole of the western view. Still, though there was\r\nnow nothing but the blank darkening moorland to look back at, Sarah\r\npersisted in stopping at frequent intervals, as long as there was any\r\nlight left, to glance behind her. She made no remark, she offered no\r\nexcuse for thus delaying the journey back to the inn. It was only when\r\nthey arrived within sight of the lights of the post-town that she\r\nceased looking back, and that she spoke to her companion. The few\r\nwords she addressed to him amounted to nothing more than a request\r\nthat he would ask for a private sitting-room as soon as they reached\r\ntheir place of sojourn for the night.\r\n\r\nThey ordered beds at the inn, and were shown into the best parlor to\r\nwait for supper. The moment they were alone, Sarah drew a chair close\r\nto the old man\'s side, and whispered these words in his ear--\r\n\r\n"Uncle! we have been followed every step of the way from Porthgenna\r\nTower to this place."\r\n\r\n"So! so! And how do you know that?" inquired Uncle Joseph.\r\n\r\n"Hush! Somebody may be listening at the door, somebody may be creeping\r\nunder the window. You noticed that boy who was digging on the moor?--"\r\n\r\n"Bah! Why, Sarah! do you frighten yourself, do you try to frighten me\r\nabout a boy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not so loud! not so loud! They have laid a trap for us. Uncle! I\r\nsuspected it when we first entered the doors of Porthgenna Tower; I am\r\nsure of it now. What did all that whispering mean between the\r\nhousekeeper and the steward when we first got into the hall? I watched\r\ntheir faces, and I know they were talking about us. They were not half\r\nsurprised enough at seeing us, not half surprised enough at hearing\r\nwhat we wanted. Don\'t laugh at me, uncle! There is real danger: it is\r\nno fancy of mine. The keys--come closer--the keys of the north rooms\r\nhave got new labels on them; the doors have all been numbered. Think\r\nof that! Think of the whispering when we came in, and the whispering\r\nafterward, in the housekeeper\'s room, when you got up to go away. You\r\nnoticed the sudden change in that man\'s behavior after the housekeeper\r\nspoke to him--you must have noticed it? They let us in too easily, and\r\nthey let us out too easily. No, no! I am not deluding myself. There\r\nwas some secret motive for letting us into the house, and some secret\r\nmotive for letting us out again. That boy on the moor betrays it, if\r\nnothing else does. I saw him following us all the way here, as plainly\r\nas I see you. I am not frightened without reason, this time. As surely\r\nas we two are together in this room, there is a trap laid for us by\r\nthe people at Porthgenna Tower!"\r\n\r\n"A trap? What trap? And how? and why? and wherefore?" inquired Uncle\r\nJoseph, expressing bewilderment by waving both his hands rapidly to\r\nand fro close before his eyes.\r\n\r\n"They want to make me speak, they want to follow me, they want to\r\nfind out where I go, they want to ask me questions," she answered,\r\ntrembling violently. "Uncle! you remember what I told you of those\r\ncrazed words I said to Mrs. Frankland--I ought to have cut my tongue\r\nout rather than have spoken them! They have done dreadful mischief--I\r\nam certain of it--dreadful mischief already. I have made myself\r\nsuspected! I shall be questioned, if Mrs. Frankland finds me out\r\nagain. She will try to find me out--we shall be inquired after\r\nhere--we must destroy all trace of where we go to next--we must make\r\nsure that the people at this inn can answer no questions--oh, Uncle\r\nJoseph! whatever we do, let us make sure of that!"\r\n\r\n"Good," said the old man, nodding his head with a perfectly\r\nself-satisfied air. "Be quite easy, my child, and leave it to me to\r\nmake sure. When you are gone to bed, I shall send for the landlord,\r\nand I shall say, \'Get us a little carriage, if you please, Sir, to\r\ntake us back again to-morrow to the coach for Truro.\'"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no! we must not hire a carriage here."\r\n\r\n"And I say, yes, yes, yes! We will hire a carriage here, because I\r\nwill, first of all, make sure with the landlord. Listen. I shall say\r\nto him, \'If there come after us people with inquisitive looks in their\r\neyes and uncomfortable questions in their mouths--if you please, Sir,\r\nhold your tongue.\' Then I shall wink my eye, I shall lay my finger,\r\nso, to the side of my nose, I shall give one little laugh that means\r\nmuch--and, crick! crack! I have made sure of the landlord! and there\r\nis an end of it!"\r\n\r\n"We must not trust the landlord, uncle--we must not trust any body.\r\nWhen we leave this place to-morrow, we must leave it on foot, and take\r\ncare no living soul follows us. Look! here is a map of West Cornwall\r\nhanging up on the wall, with roads and cross-roads all marked on it.\r\nWe may find out beforehand what direction we ought to walk in. A\r\nnight\'s rest will give me all the strength I want; and we have no\r\nluggage that we can not carry. You have nothing but your knapsack, and\r\nI have nothing but the little carpet-bag you lent me. We can walk six,\r\nseven, even ten miles, with resting by the way. Come here and look at\r\nthe map--pray, pray come and look at the map!"\r\n\r\nProtesting against the abandonment of his own project, which he\r\ndeclared, and sincerely believed, to be perfectly adapted to meet the\r\nemergency in which they were placed, Uncle Joseph joined his niece in\r\nexamining the map. A little beyond the post-town, a cross-road was\r\nmarked, running northward at right angles with the highway that led to\r\nTruro, and conducting to another road, which looked large enough to be\r\na coach-road, and which led through a town of sufficient importance to\r\nhave its name printed in capital letters. On discovering this, Sarah\r\nproposed that they should follow the cross-road (which did not appear\r\non the map to be more than five or six miles long) on foot, abstaining\r\nfrom taking any conveyance until they had arrived at the town marked\r\nin capital letters. By pursuing this course, they would destroy all\r\ntrace of their progress after leaving the post-town--unless, indeed,\r\nthey were followed on foot from this place, as they had been followed\r\nover the moor. In the event of any fresh difficulty of that sort\r\noccurring, Sarah had no better remedy to propose than lingering on the\r\nroad till after nightfall, and leaving it to the darkness to baffle\r\nthe vigilance of any person who might be watching in the distance to\r\nsee where they went.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph shrugged his shoulders resignedly when his niece gave her\r\nreasons for wishing to continue the journey on foot. "There is much\r\ntramping through dust, and much looking behind us, and much spying and\r\npeeping and suspecting and roundabout walking in all this," he said.\r\n"It is by no means so easy, my child, as making sure of the landlord,\r\nand sitting at our ease on the cushions of the stage-coach. But if you\r\nwill have it so, so shall it be. What you please, Sarah; what you\r\nplease--that is all the opinion of my own that I allow myself to have\r\ntill we are back again at Truro, and are rested for good and all at\r\nthe end of our journey."\r\n\r\n"At the end of _your_ journey, uncle: I dare not say at the end of\r\n_mine_."\r\n\r\nThose few words changed the old man\'s face in an instant. His eyes\r\nfixed reproachfully on his niece, his ruddy cheeks lost their color,\r\nhis restless hands dropped suddenly to his sides. "Sarah!" he said, in\r\na low, quiet tone, which seemed to have no relation to the voice in\r\nwhich he spoke on ordinary occasions--"Sarah! have you the heart to\r\nleave me again?"\r\n\r\n"Have I the courage to stay in Cornwall? That is the question to ask\r\nme, uncle. If I had only my own heart to consult, oh! how gladly I\r\nshould live under your roof--live under it, if you would let me, to my\r\ndying day! But my lot is not cast for such rest and such happiness as\r\nthat. The fear that I have of being questioned by Mrs. Frankland\r\ndrives me away from Porthgenna, away from Cornwall, away from you.\r\nEven my dread of the letter being found is hardly so great now as my\r\ndread of being traced and questioned. I have said what I ought not to\r\nhave said already. If I find myself in Mrs. Frankland\'s presence\r\nagain, there is nothing that she might not draw out of me. Oh, my God!\r\nto think of that kind-hearted, lovely young woman, who brings\r\nhappiness with her wherever she goes, bringing terror to _me_! Terror\r\nwhen her pitying eyes look at me; terror when her kind voice speaks to\r\nme; terror when her tender hand touches mine! Uncle! when Mrs.\r\nFrankland comes to Porthgenna, the very children will crowd about\r\nher--every creature in that poor village will be drawn toward the\r\nlight of her beauty and her goodness, as if it was the sunshine of\r\nHeaven itself; and I--I, of all living beings--must shun her as if she\r\nwas a pestilence! The day when she comes into Cornwall is the day when\r\nI must go out of it--the day when we two must say farewell. Don\'t,\r\ndon\'t add to my wretchedness by asking me if I have the heart to leave\r\nyou! For my dead mother\'s sake, Uncle Joseph, believe that I am\r\ngrateful, believe that it is not my own will that takes me away when I\r\nleave you again." She sank down on a sofa near her, laid her head,\r\nwith one long, deep sigh, wearily on the pillow, and spoke no more.\r\n\r\nThe tears gathered thick in Uncle Joseph\'s eyes as he sat down by her\r\nside. He took one of her hands, and patted and stroked it as though he\r\nwere soothing a little child. "I will bear it as well as I can,\r\nSarah," he whispered, faintly, "and I will say no more. You will write\r\nto me sometimes, when I am left all alone? You will give a little time\r\nto Uncle Joseph, for the poor dead mother\'s sake?"\r\n\r\nShe turned toward him suddenly, and threw both her arms round his neck\r\nwith a passionate energy that was strangely at variance with her\r\nnaturally quiet self-repressed character. "I will write often, dear; I\r\nwill write always," she whispered, with her head on his bosom. "If I\r\nam ever in any trouble or danger, you shall know it." She stopped\r\nconfusedly, as if the freedom of her own words and actions terrified\r\nher, unclasped her arms, and, turning away abruptly from the old man,\r\nhid her face in her hands. The tyranny of the restraint that governed\r\nher whole life was all expressed--how sadly, how eloquently!--in that\r\none little action.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph rose from the sofa, and walked gently backward and\r\nforward in the room, looking anxiously at his niece, but not speaking\r\nto her. After a while the servant came in to prepare the table for\r\nsupper. It was a welcome interruption, for it obliged Sarah to make an\r\neffort to recover her self-possession. After the meal was over, the\r\nuncle and niece separated at once for the night, without venturing to\r\nexchange another word on the subject of their approaching separation.\r\n\r\nWhen they met the next morning, the old man had not recovered his\r\nspirits. Although he tried to speak as cheerfully as usual, there was\r\nsomething strangely subdued and quiet about him in voice, look, and\r\nmanner. Sarah\'s heart smote her as she saw how sadly he was altered by\r\nthe prospect of their parting. She said a few words of consolation and\r\nhope; but he only waved his hand negatively, in his quaint foreign\r\nmanner, and hastened out of the room to find the landlord and ask for\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast, to the surprise of the people at the inn, they\r\nset forth to continue their journey on foot, Uncle Joseph carrying his\r\nknapsack on his back, and his niece\'s carpet-bag in his hand. When\r\nthey arrived at the turning that led into the cross-road, they both\r\nstopped and looked back. This time they saw nothing to alarm them.\r\nThere was no living creature visible on the broad highway over which\r\nthey had been walking for the last quarter of an hour after leaving\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\n"The way is clear," said Uncle Joseph, as they turned into the\r\ncross-road. "Whatever might have happened yesterday, there is nobody\r\nfollowing us now."\r\n\r\n"Nobody that we can see," answered Sarah. "But I distrust the very\r\nstones by the road-side. Let us look back often, uncle, before we\r\nallow ourselves to feel secure. The more I think of it, the more I\r\ndread the snare that is laid for us by those people at Porthgenna\r\nTower."\r\n\r\n"You say _us_, Sarah. Why should they lay a snare for _me_?"\r\n\r\n"Because they have seen you in my company. You will be safer from them\r\nwhen we are parted; and that is another reason, Uncle Joseph, why we\r\nshould bear the misfortune of our separation as patiently as we can."\r\n\r\n"Are you going far, very far away, Sarah, when you leave me?"\r\n\r\n"I dare not stop on my journey till I can feel that I am lost in the\r\ngreat world of London. Don\'t look at me so sadly! I shall never forget\r\nmy promise; I shall never forget to write. I have friends--not friends\r\nlike you, but still friends--to whom I can go. I can feel safe from\r\ndiscovery nowhere but in London. My danger is great--it is, it is,\r\nindeed! I know, from what I have seen at Porthgenna, that Mrs.\r\nFrankland has an interest already in finding me out; and I am certain\r\nthat this interest will be increased tenfold when she hears (as she is\r\nsure to hear) of what happened yesterday in the house. If they\r\n_should_ trace you to Truro, oh, be careful, uncle! be careful how you\r\ndeal with them; be careful how you answer their questions!"\r\n\r\n"I will answer nothing, my child. But tell me--for I want to know all\r\nthe little chances that there are of your coming back--tell me, if\r\nMrs. Frankland finds the letter, what shall you do then?"\r\n\r\nAt that question, Sarah\'s hand, which had been resting languidly on\r\nher uncle\'s arm while they walked together, closed on it suddenly.\r\n"Even if Mrs. Frankland gets into the Myrtle Room," she said, stopping\r\nand looking affrightedly about her while she replied, "she may not\r\nfind the letter. It is folded up so small; it is hidden in such an\r\nunlikely place."\r\n\r\n"But if she does find it?"\r\n\r\n"If she does, there will be more reason than ever for my being miles\r\nand miles away."\r\n\r\nAs she gave that answer, she raised both her hands to her heart, and\r\npressed them firmly over it. A slight distortion passed rapidly across\r\nher features; her eyes closed; her face flushed all over--then turned\r\npaler again than ever. She drew out her pocket-handkerchief, and\r\npassed it several times over her face, on which the perspiration had\r\ngathered thickly. The old man, who had looked behind him when his\r\nniece stopped, under the impression that she had just seen somebody\r\nfollowing them, observed this latter action, and asked if she felt too\r\nhot. She shook her head, and took his arm again to go on, breathing,\r\nas he fancied, with some difficulty. He proposed that they should sit\r\ndown by the road-side and rest a little; but she only answered, "Not\r\nyet." So they went on for another half-hour; then turned to look\r\nbehind them again, and, still seeing nobody, sat down for a little\r\nwhile to rest on a bank by the way-side.\r\n\r\nAfter stopping twice more at convenient resting-places, they reached\r\nthe end of the cross-road. On the highway to which it led them they\r\nwere overtaken by a man driving an empty cart, who offered to give\r\nthem a lift as far as the next town. They accepted the proposal\r\ngratefully; and, arriving at the town, after a drive of half an hour,\r\nwere set down at the door of the principal inn. Finding on inquiry at\r\nthis place that they were too late for the coach, they took a private\r\nconveyance, which brought them to Truro late in the afternoon.\r\nThroughout the whole of the journey, from the time when they left the\r\npost-town of Porthgenna to the time when they stopped, by Sarah\'s\r\ndesire, at the coach-office in Truro, they had seen nothing to excite\r\nthe smallest suspicion that their movements were being observed. None\r\nof the people whom they saw in the inhabited places, or whom they\r\npassed on the road, appeared to take more than the most casual notice\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nIt was five o\'clock when they entered the office at Truro to ask about\r\nconveyances running in the direction of Exeter. They were informed\r\nthat a coach would start in an hour\'s time, and that another coach\r\nwould pass through Truro at eight o\'clock the next morning.\r\n\r\n"You will not go to-night?" pleaded Uncle Joseph. "You will wait, my\r\nchild, and rest with me till to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I had better go, uncle, while I have some little resolution left,"\r\nwas the sad answer.\r\n\r\n"But you are so pale, so tired, so weak."\r\n\r\n"I shall never be stronger than I am now. Don\'t set my own heart\r\nagainst me! It is hard enough to go without that."\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph sighed, and said no more. He led the way across the road\r\nand down the by-street to his house. The cheerful man in the shop was\r\npolishing a piece of wood behind the counter, sitting in the same\r\nposition in which Sarah had seen him when she first looked through the\r\nwindow on her arrival at Truro. He had good news for his master of\r\norders received, but Uncle Joseph listened absently to all that his\r\nshopman said, and hastened into the little back parlor without the\r\nfaintest reflection of its customary smile on his face. "If I had no\r\nshop and no orders, I might go away with you, Sarah," he said when he\r\nand his niece were alone. "A\xc3\xafe! A\xc3\xafe! the setting out on this journey\r\nhas been the only happy part of it. Sit down and rest, my child. I\r\nmust put my best face upon it, and get you some tea."\r\n\r\nWhen the tea-tray had been placed on the table, he left the room, and\r\nreturned, after an absence of some little time, with a basket in his\r\nhand. When the porter came to carry the luggage to the coach-office,\r\nhe would not allow the basket to be taken away at the same time, but\r\nsat down and placed it between his feet while he occupied himself in\r\npouring out a cup of tea for his niece.\r\n\r\nThe musical box still hung at his side in its traveling-case of\r\nleather. As soon as he had poured out the cup of tea, he unbuckled the\r\nstrap, removed the covering from the box, and placed it on the table\r\nnear him. His eyes wandered hesitatingly toward Sarah, as he did this;\r\nhe leaned forward, his lips trembling a little, his hand trifling\r\nuneasily with the empty leather case that now lay on his knees, and\r\nsaid to her in low, unsteady tones--\r\n\r\n"You will hear a little farewell song of Mozart? It may be a long\r\ntime, Sarah, before he can play to you again. A little farewell song,\r\nmy child, before you go?"\r\n\r\nHis hand stole up gently from the leather case to the table, and set\r\nthe box playing the same air that Sarah had heard on the evening when\r\nshe entered the parlor, after her journey from Somersetshire, and\r\nfound him sitting alone listening to the music. What depths of sorrow\r\nthere were now in those few simple notes! What mournful memories of\r\npast times gathered and swelled in the heart at the bidding of that\r\none little plaintive melody! Sarah could not summon the courage to\r\nlift her eyes to the old man\'s face--they might have betrayed to him\r\nthat she was thinking of the days when the box that he treasured so\r\ndearly played the air they were listening to now by the bedside of his\r\ndying child.\r\n\r\nThe stop had not been set, and the melody, after it had come to an\r\nend, began again. But now, after the first few bars, the notes\r\nsucceeded one another more and more slowly--the air grew less and less\r\nrecognizable--dropped at last to three notes, following each other at\r\nlong intervals--then ceased altogether. The chain that governed the\r\naction of the machinery had all run out; Mozart\'s farewell song was\r\nsilenced on a sudden, like a voice that had broken down.\r\n\r\nThe old man started, looked earnestly at his niece, and threw the\r\nleather case over the box as if he desired to shut out the sight of\r\nit. "The music stopped so," he whispered to himself, in his own\r\nlanguage, "when little Joseph died! Don\'t go!" he added quickly, in\r\nEnglish, almost before Sarah had time to feel surprised at the\r\nsingular change that had taken place in his voice and manner. "Don\'t\r\ngo! Think better of it, and stop with me."\r\n\r\n"I have no choice, uncle, but to leave you--indeed, indeed I have not!\r\nYou don\'t think me ungrateful? Comfort me at the last moment by\r\ntelling me that!"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand in silence, and kissed her on both cheeks. "My\r\nheart is very heavy for you, Sarah," he said. "The fear has come to me\r\nthat it is not for your own good that you are going away from Uncle\r\nJoseph now!"\r\n\r\n"I have no choice," she sadly repeated--"no choice but to leave you."\r\n\r\n"It is time, then, to get the parting over." The cloud of doubt and\r\nfear that had altered his face, from the moment when the music came to\r\nits untimely end, seemed to darken, when he had said those words. He\r\ntook up the basket which he had kept so carefully at his feet, and led\r\nthe way out in silence.\r\n\r\nThey were barely in time; the driver was mounting to his seat when\r\nthey got to the coach-office. "God preserve you, my child, and send\r\nyou back to me soon, safe and well. Take the basket on your lap; there\r\nare some little things in it for your journey." His voice faltered at\r\nthe last word, and Sarah felt his lips pressed on her hand. The next\r\ninstant the door was closed, and she saw him dimly through her tears\r\nstanding among the idlers on the pavement, who were waiting to see the\r\ncoach drive off.\r\n\r\nBy the time they were a little way out of the town she was able to\r\ndry her eyes and look into the basket. It contained a pot of jam and a\r\nhorn spoon, a small inlaid work-box from the stock in the shop, a\r\npiece of foreign-looking cheese, a French roll, and a little paper\r\npacket of money, with the words "Don\'t be angry" written on it, in\r\nUncle Joseph\'s hand. Sarah closed the cover of the basket again, and\r\ndrew down her veil. She had not felt the sorrow of the parting in all\r\nits bitterness until that moment. Oh, how hard it was to be banished\r\nfrom the sheltering home which was offered to her by the one friend\r\nshe had left in the world!\r\n\r\nWhile that thought was in her mind, the old man was just closing the\r\ndoor of his lonely parlor. His eyes wandered to the tea-tray on the\r\ntable and to Sarah\'s empty cup, and he whispered to himself in his own\r\nlanguage again--\r\n\r\n"The music stopped so when little Joseph died!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND AND A NEW SCHEME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn declaring, positively, that the boy whom she had seen digging on\r\nthe moor had followed her uncle and herself to the post-town of\r\nPorthgenna, Sarah had asserted the literal truth. Jacob had tracked\r\nthem to the inn, had waited a little while about the door, to\r\nascertain if there was any likelihood of their continuing their\r\njourney that evening, and had then returned to Porthgenna Tower to\r\nmake his report, and to claim his promised reward.\r\n\r\nThe same night, the housekeeper and the steward devoted themselves to\r\nthe joint production of a letter to Mrs. Frankland, informing her of\r\nall that had taken place, from the time when the visitors first made\r\ntheir appearance, to the time when the gardener\'s boy had followed\r\nthem to the door of the inn. The composition was plentifully garnished\r\nthroughout with the flowers of Mr. Munder\'s rhetoric, and was, by a\r\nnecessary consequence, inordinately long as a narrative, and\r\nhopelessly confused as a statement of facts.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that the letter, with all its faults and\r\nabsurdities, was read by Mrs. Frankland with the deepest interest. Her\r\nhusband and Mr. Orridge, to both of whom she communicated its\r\ncontents, were as much amazed and perplexed by it as she was herself.\r\nAlthough the discovery of Mrs. Jazeph\'s departure for Cornwall had led\r\nthem to consider it within the range of possibility that she might\r\nappear at Porthgenna, and although the housekeeper had been written to\r\nby Rosamond under the influence of that idea, neither she nor her\r\nhusband were quite prepared for such a speedy confirmation of their\r\nsuspicions as they had now received. Their astonishment, however, on\r\nfirst ascertaining the general purport of the letter, was as nothing\r\ncompared with their astonishment when they came to those particular\r\npassages in it which referred to Uncle Joseph. The fresh element of\r\ncomplication imparted to the thickening mystery of Mrs. Jazeph and the\r\nMyrtle Room, by the entrance of the foreign stranger on the scene, and\r\nby his intimate connection with the extraordinary proceedings that had\r\ntaken place in the house, fairly baffled them all. The letter was read\r\nagain and again; was critically dissected paragraph by paragraph; was\r\ncarefully annotated by the doctor, for the purpose of extricating all\r\nthe facts that it contained from the mass of unmeaning words in which\r\nMr. Munder had artfully and lengthily involved them; and was finally\r\npronounced, after all the pains that had been taken to render it\r\nintelligible, to be the most mysterious and bewildering document that\r\nmortal pen had ever produced.\r\n\r\nThe first practical suggestion, after the letter had been laid aside\r\nin despair, emanated from Rosamond. She proposed that her husband and\r\nherself (the baby included, as a matter of course) should start at\r\nonce for Porthgenna, to question the servants minutely about the\r\nproceedings of Mrs. Jazeph and the foreign stranger who had\r\naccompanied her, and to examine the premises on the north side of the\r\nhouse, with a view to discovering a clew to the locality of the Myrtle\r\nRoom, while events were still fresh in the memories of witnesses. The\r\nplan thus advocated, however excellent in itself, was opposed by Mr.\r\nOrridge on medical grounds. Mrs. Frankland had caught cold by exposing\r\nherself too carelessly to the air, on first leaving her room, and the\r\ndoctor refused to grant her permission to travel for at least a week\r\nto come, if not for a longer period.\r\n\r\nThe next proposal came from Mr. Frankland. He declared it to be\r\nperfectly clear to his mind that the only chance of penetrating the\r\nmystery of the Myrtle Room rested entirely on the discovery of some\r\nmeans of communicating with Mrs. Jazeph. He suggested that they should\r\nnot trouble themselves to think of any thing unconnected with the\r\naccomplishment of this purpose; and he proposed that the servant then\r\nin attendance on him at West Winston--a man who had been in his\r\nemployment for many years, and whose zeal, activity, and intelligence\r\ncould be thoroughly depended on--should be sent to Porthgenna\r\nforthwith, to start the necessary inquiries, and to examine the\r\npremises carefully on the north side of the house.\r\n\r\nThis advice was immediately acted on. At an hour\'s notice the servant\r\nstarted for Cornwall, thoroughly instructed as to what he was to do,\r\nand well supplied with money, in case he found it necessary to employ\r\nmany persons in making the proposed inquiries. In due course of time\r\nhe sent a report of his proceedings to his master. It proved to be of\r\na most discouraging nature.\r\n\r\nAll trace of Mrs. Jazeph and her companion had been lost at the\r\npost-town of Porthgenna. Investigations had been made in every\r\ndirection, but no reliable information had been obtained. People in\r\ntotally different parts of the country declared readily enough that\r\nthey had seen two persons answering to the description of the lady in\r\nthe dark dress and the old foreigner; but when they were called upon\r\nto state the direction in which the two strangers were traveling, the\r\nanswers received turned out to be of the most puzzling and\r\ncontradictory kind. No pains had been spared, no necessary expenditure\r\nof money had been grudged; but, so far, no results of the slightest\r\nvalue had been obtained. Whether the lady and the foreigner had gone\r\neast, west, north, or south, was more than Mr. Frankland\'s servant, at\r\nthe present stage of the proceedings, could take it on himself to say.\r\n\r\nThe report of the examination of the north rooms was not more\r\nsatisfactory. Here, again, nothing of any importance could be\r\ndiscovered. The servant had ascertained that there were twenty-two\r\nrooms on the uninhabited side of the house--six on the ground-floor\r\nopening into the deserted garden, eight on the first floor, and eight\r\nabove that, on the second story. He had examined all the doors\r\ncarefully from top to bottom, and had come to the conclusion that none\r\nof them had been opened. The evidence afforded by the lady\'s own\r\nactions led to nothing. She had, if the testimony of the servant could\r\nbe trusted, dropped the keys on the floor of the hall. She was found,\r\nas the housekeeper and the steward asserted, lying, in a fainting\r\ncondition, at the top of the landing of the first flight of stairs.\r\nThe door opposite to her, in this position, showed no more traces of\r\nhaving been recently opened than any of the other doors of the other\r\ntwenty-one rooms. Whether the room to which she wished to gain access\r\nwas one of the eight on the first floor, or whether she had fainted\r\non her way up to the higher range of eight rooms on the second floor,\r\nit was impossible to determine.\r\n\r\nThe only conclusions that could be fairly drawn from the events that\r\nhad taken place in the house were two in number. First, it might be\r\ntaken for granted that the lady had been disturbed before she had been\r\nable to use the keys to gain admission to the Myrtle Room. Secondly,\r\nit might be assumed, from the position in which she was found on the\r\nstairs, and from the evidence relating to the dropping of the keys,\r\nthat the Myrtle Room was not on the ground-floor, but was one of the\r\nsixteen rooms situated on the first and second stories. Beyond this\r\nthe writer of the report had nothing further to mention, except that\r\nhe had ventured to decide on waiting at Porthgenna, in the event of\r\nhis master having any further instructions to communicate.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done next? That was necessarily the first question\r\nsuggested by the servant\'s announcement of the unsuccessful result of\r\nhis inquiries at Porthgenna. How it was to be answered was not very\r\neasy to discover. Mrs. Frankland had nothing to suggest, Mr. Frankland\r\nhad nothing to suggest, the doctor had nothing to suggest. The more\r\nindustriously they all three hunted through their minds for a new\r\nidea, the less chance there seemed to be of their succeeding in\r\nfinding one. At last, Rosamond proposed, in despair, that they should\r\nseek the advice of some fourth person who could be depended on; and\r\nasked her husband\'s permission to write a confidential statement of\r\ntheir difficulties to the vicar of Long Beckley. Doctor Chennery was\r\ntheir oldest friend and adviser; he had known them both as children;\r\nhe was well acquainted with the history of their families; he felt a\r\nfatherly interest in their fortunes; and he possessed that invaluable\r\nquality of plain, clear-headed common-sense which marked him out as\r\nthe very man who would be most likely, as well as most willing, to\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland readily agreed to his wife\'s suggestion; and Rosamond\r\nwrote immediately to Doctor Chennery, informing him of every thing\r\nthat had happened since Mrs. Jazeph\'s first introduction to her, and\r\nasking him for his opinion on the course of proceeding which it would\r\nbe best for her husband and herself to adopt in the difficulty in\r\nwhich they were now placed. By return of post an answer was received,\r\nwhich amply justified Rosamond\'s reliance on her old friend. Doctor\r\nChennery not only sympathized heartily with the eager curiosity which\r\nMrs. Jazeph\'s language and conduct had excited in the mind of his\r\ncorrespondent, but he had also a plan of his own to propose for\r\nascertaining the position of the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\nThe vicar prefaced his suggestion by expressing a strong opinion\r\nagainst instituting any further search after Mrs. Jazeph. Judging by\r\nthe circumstances, as they were related to him, he considered that it\r\nwould be the merest waste of time to attempt to find her out.\r\nAccordingly he passed from that part of the subject at once, and\r\ndevoted himself to the consideration of the more important\r\nquestion--How Mr. and Mrs. Frankland were to proceed in the endeavor\r\nto discover for themselves the mystery of the Myrtle Room?\r\n\r\nOn this point Doctor Chennery entertained a conviction of the\r\nstrongest kind, and he warned Rosamond beforehand that she must expect\r\nto be very much surprised when he came to the statement of it. Taking\r\nit for granted that she and her husband could not hope to find out\r\nwhere the room was, unless they were assisted by some one better\r\nacquainted than themselves with the old local arrangements of the\r\ninterior of Porthgenna Tower, the vicar declared it to be his opinion\r\nthat there was only one individual living who could afford them the\r\ninformation they wanted, and that this person was no other than\r\nRosamond\'s own cross-grained relative, Andrew Treverton.\r\n\r\nThis startling opinion Doctor Chennery supported by two reasons. In\r\nthe first place, Andrew was the only surviving member of the elder\r\ngeneration who had lived at Porthgenna Tower in the by-gone days when\r\nall traditions connected with the north rooms were still fresh in the\r\nmemories of the inhabitants of the house. The people who lived in it\r\nnow were strangers, who had been placed in their situations by Mr.\r\nFrankland\'s father; and the servants employed in former days by\r\nCaptain Treverton were dead or dispersed. The one available person,\r\ntherefore, whose recollections were likely to be of any service to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Frankland, was indisputably the brother of the old owner of\r\nPorthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there was the chance, even if Andrew Treverton\'s\r\nmemory was not to be trusted, that he might possess written or\r\nprinted information relating to the locality of the Myrtle Room. By\r\nhis father\'s will--which had been made when Andrew was a young man\r\njust going to college, and which had not been altered at the period of\r\nhis departure from England, or at any after-time--he had inherited the\r\nchoice old collection of books in the library at Porthgenna. Supposing\r\nthat he still preserved these heir-looms, it was highly probable that\r\nthere might exist among them some plan, or some description of the\r\nhouse as it was in the olden time, which would supply all the\r\ninformation that was wanted. Here, then, was another valid reason for\r\nbelieving that if a clew to the position of the Myrtle Room existed\r\nany where, Andrew Treverton was the man to lay his hand on it.\r\n\r\nAssuming it, therefore, to be proved that the surly old misanthrope\r\nwas the only person who could be profitably applied to for the\r\nrequisite information, the next question was, How to communicate with\r\nhim? The vicar understood perfectly that after Andrew\'s inexcusably\r\nheartless conduct toward her father and mother, it was quite\r\nimpossible for Rosamond to address any direct application to him. The\r\nobstacle, however, might be surmounted by making the necessary\r\ncommunication proceed from Doctor Chennery. Heartily as the vicar\r\ndisliked Andrew Treverton personally, and strongly as he disapproved\r\nof the old misanthrope\'s principles, he was willing to set aside his\r\nown antipathies and objections to serve the interests of his young\r\nfriends; and he expressed his perfect readiness to write and recall\r\nhimself to Andrew\'s recollection, and to ask, as if it was a matter of\r\nantiquarian curiosity, for information on the subject of the north\r\nside of Porthgenna Tower--including, of course, a special request to\r\nbe made acquainted with the names by which the rooms had been\r\nindividually known in former days.\r\n\r\nIn making this offer, the vicar frankly acknowledged that he thought\r\nthe chances were very much against his receiving any answer at all to\r\nhis application, no matter how carefully he might word it, with a view\r\nto humoring Andrew\'s churlish peculiarities. However, considering\r\nthat, in the present posture of affairs, a forlorn hope was better\r\nthan no hope at all, he thought it was at least worth while to make\r\nthe attempt on the plan which he had just suggested. If Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland could devise any better means of opening communications\r\nwith Andrew Treverton, or if they had discovered any new method of\r\ntheir own for obtaining the information of which they stood in need,\r\nDoctor Chennery was perfectly ready to set aside his own opinions and\r\nto defer to theirs.\r\n\r\nA very brief consideration of the vicar\'s friendly letter convinced\r\nRosamond and her husband that they had no choice but gratefully to\r\naccept the offer which it contained. The chances were certainly\r\nagainst the success of the proposed application; but were they more\r\nunfavorable than the chances against the success of any unaided\r\ninvestigations at Porthgenna? There was, at least, a faint hope of\r\nDoctor Chennery\'s request for information producing some results; but\r\nthere seemed no hope at all of penetrating a mystery connected with\r\none room only, by dint of wandering, in perfect ignorance of what to\r\nsearch for, through two ranges of rooms which reached the number of\r\nsixteen. Influenced by these considerations, Rosamond wrote back to\r\nthe vicar to thank him for his kindness, and to beg that he would\r\ncommunicate with Andrew Treverton, as he had proposed, without a\r\nmoment\'s delay.\r\n\r\nDoctor Chennery immediately occupied himself in the composition of the\r\nimportant letter, taking care to make the application on purely\r\nantiquarian grounds, and accounting for his assumed curiosity on the\r\nsubject of the interior of Porthgenna Tower by referring to his former\r\nknowledge of the Treverton family, and to his natural interest in the\r\nold house with which their name and fortunes had been so closely\r\nconnected. After appealing to Andrew\'s early recollections for the\r\ninformation that he wanted, he ventured a step farther, and alluded to\r\nthe library of old books, mentioning his own idea that there might be\r\nfound among them some plan or verbal description of the house, which\r\nmight prove to be of the greatest service, in the event of Mr.\r\nTreverton\'s memory not having preserved all particulars in connection\r\nwith the names and positions of the north rooms. In conclusion, he\r\ntook the liberty of mentioning that the loan of any document of the\r\nkind to which he had alluded, or the permission to have extracts made\r\nfrom it, would be thankfully acknowledged as a great favor conferred;\r\nand he added, in a postscript, that, in order to save Mr. Treverton\r\nall trouble, a messenger would call for any answer he might be\r\ndisposed to give the day after the delivery of the letter. Having\r\ncompleted the application in these terms, the vicar inclosed it under\r\ncover to his man of business in London, with directions that it was to\r\nbe delivered by a trustworthy person, and that the messenger was to\r\ncall again the next morning to know if there was any answer.\r\n\r\nThree days after this letter had been dispatched to its\r\ndestination--at which time no tidings of any sort had been received\r\nfrom Doctor Chennery--Rosamond at last obtained her medical\r\nattendant\'s permission to travel. Taking leave of Mr. Orridge, with\r\nmany promises to let him know what progress they made toward\r\ndiscovering the Myrtle Room, Mr. and Mrs. Frankland turned their backs\r\non West Winston, and for the third time started on the journey to\r\nPorthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was baking-day in the establishment of Mr. Andrew Treverton when\r\nthe messenger intrusted with Doctor Chennery\'s letter found his way to\r\nthe garden door of the cottage at Bayswater. After he had rung three\r\ntimes, he heard a gruff voice, on the other side of the wall, roaring\r\nat him to let the bell alone, and asking who he was, and what the\r\ndevil he wanted.\r\n\r\n"A letter for Mr. Treverton," said the messenger, nervously backing\r\naway from the door while he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Chuck it over the wall, then, and be off with you!" answered the\r\ngruff voice.\r\n\r\nThe messenger obeyed both injunctions. He was a meek, modest, elderly\r\nman; and when Nature mixed up the ingredients of his disposition, the\r\ncapability of resenting injuries was not among them.\r\n\r\nThe man with the gruff voice--or, to put it in plainer terms, the man\r\nShrowl--picked up the letter, weighed it in his hand, looked at the\r\naddress on it with an expression of contemptuous curiosity in his\r\nbull-terrier eyes, put it in his waistcoat pocket, and walked around\r\nlazily to the kitchen entrance of the cottage.\r\n\r\nIn the apartment which would probably have been called the pantry, if\r\nthe house had belonged to civilized tenants, a hand-mill had been set\r\nup; and, at the moment when Shrowl made his way to this room, Mr.\r\nTreverton was engaged in asserting his independence of all the millers\r\nin England by grinding his own corn. He paused irritably in turning\r\nthe handle of the mill when his servant appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n"What do you come here for?" he asked. "When the flour\'s ready, I\'ll\r\ncall for you. Don\'t let\'s look at each other oftener than we can help!\r\nI never set eyes on you, Shrowl, but I ask myself whether, in the\r\nwhole range of creation, there is any animal as ugly as man? I saw a\r\ncat this morning on the garden wall, and there wasn\'t a single point\r\nin which you would bear comparison with him. The cat\'s eyes were\r\nclear--yours are muddy. The cat\'s nose was straight--yours is crooked.\r\nThe cat\'s whiskers were clean--yours are dirty. The cat\'s coat fitted\r\nhim--yours hangs about you like a sack. I tell you again, Shrowl, the\r\nspecies to which you (and I) belong is the ugliest on the whole face\r\nof creation. Don\'t let us revolt each other by keeping in company any\r\nlonger. Go away, you last, worst, infirmest freak of Nature--go away!"\r\n\r\nShrowl listened to this complimentary address with an aspect of surly\r\nserenity. When it had come to an end, he took the letter from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket, without condescending to make any reply. He was, by\r\nthis time, too thoroughly conscious of his own power over his master\r\nto attach the smallest importance to any thing Mr. Treverton might say\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve done your talking, suppose you take a look at that," said\r\nShrowl, dropping the letter carelessly on a deal table by his master\'s\r\nside. "It isn\'t often that people trouble themselves to send letters\r\nto you--is it? I wonder whether your niece has took a fancy to write\r\nto you? It was put in the papers the other day that she\'d got a son\r\nand heir. Open the letter, and see if it\'s an invitation to the\r\nchristening. The company would be sure to want your smiling face at\r\nthe table to make \'em jolly. Just let me take a grind at the mill,\r\nwhile you go out and get a silver mug. The son and heir expects a mug\r\nyou know, and his nurse expects half a guinea, and his mamma expects\r\nall your fortune. What a pleasure to make the three innocent creeturs\r\nhappy! It\'s shocking to see you pulling wry faces, like that, over the\r\nletter. Lord! lord! where can all your natural affection have gone\r\nto?--"\r\n\r\n"If I only knew where to lay my hand on a gag, I\'d cram it into your\r\ninfernal mouth!" cried Mr. Treverton. "How dare you talk to me about\r\nmy niece? You wretch! you know I hate her for her mother\'s sake. What\r\ndo you mean by harping perpetually on my fortune? Sooner than leave it\r\nto the play-actress\'s child, I\'d even leave it to you; and sooner than\r\nleave it to you, I would take every farthing of it out in a boat, and\r\nbury it forever at the bottom of the sea!" Venting his dissatisfaction\r\nin these strong terms, Mr. Treverton snatched up Doctor Chennery\'s\r\nletter, and tore it open in a humor which by no means promised\r\nfavorably for the success of the vicar\'s application.\r\n\r\nHe read the letter with an ominous scowl on his face, which grew\r\ndarker and darker as he got nearer and nearer to the end. When he came\r\nto the signature his humor changed, and he laughed sardonically.\r\n"Faithfully yours, Robert Chennery," he repeated to himself. "Yes!\r\nfaithfully mine, if I humor your whim. And what if I don\'t, parson?"\r\nHe paused, and looked at the letter again, the scowl re-appearing on\r\nhis face as he did so. "There\'s a lie of some kind lurking about under\r\nthese lines of fair writing," he muttered suspiciously. "_I_ am not\r\none of his congregation: the law gives him no privilege of imposing on\r\n_me_. What does he mean by making the attempt?" He stopped again,\r\nreflected a little, looked up suddenly at Shrowl, and said to him,\r\n\r\n"Have you lit the oven fire yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, I hav\'n\'t," answered Shrowl.\r\n\r\nMr. Treverton examined the letter for the third time--hesitated--then\r\nslowly tore it in half, and tossed the two pieces over contemptuously\r\nto his servant.\r\n\r\n"Light the fire at once," he said. "And, if you want paper, there it\r\nis for you. Stop!" he added, after Shrowl had picked up the torn\r\nletter. "If any body comes here to-morrow morning to ask for an\r\nanswer, tell them I gave you the letter to light the fire with, and\r\nsay that\'s the answer." With those words Mr. Treverton returned to the\r\nmill, and began to grind at it again, with a grin of malicious\r\nsatisfaction on his haggard face.\r\n\r\nShrowl withdrew into the kitchen, closed the door, and, placing the\r\ntorn pieces of the letter together on the dresser, applied himself,\r\nwith the coolest deliberation, to the business of reading it. When he\r\nhad gone slowly and carefully through it, from the address at the\r\nbeginning to the name at the end, he scratched reflectively for a\r\nlittle while at his ragged beard, then folded the letter up carefully\r\nand put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have another look at it later in the day," he thought to\r\nhimself, tearing off a piece of an old newspaper to light the fire\r\nwith. "It strikes me, just at present, that there may be better things\r\ndone with this letter than burning it."\r\n\r\nResolutely abstaining from taking the letter out of his pocket again\r\nuntil all the duties of the household for that day had been duly\r\nperformed, Shrowl lit the fire, occupied the morning in making and\r\nbaking the bread, and patiently took his turn afterward at digging in\r\nthe kitchen garden. It was four o\'clock in the afternoon before he\r\nfelt himself at liberty to think of his private affairs, and to\r\nventure on retiring into solitude with the object of secretly looking\r\nover the letter once more.\r\n\r\nA second perusal of Doctor Chennery\'s unlucky application to Mr.\r\nTreverton helped to confirm Shrowl in his resolution not to destroy\r\nthe letter. With great pains and perseverance, and much incidental\r\nscratching at his beard, he contrived to make himself master of three\r\ndistinct points in it, which stood out, in his estimation, as\r\npossessing prominent and serious importance.\r\n\r\nThe first point which he contrived to establish clearly in his mind\r\nwas that the person who signed the name of Robert Chennery was\r\ndesirous of examining a plan, or printed account, of the north side of\r\nthe interior of a certain old house in Cornwall, called Porthgenna\r\nTower. The second point appeared to resolve itself into this, that\r\nRobert Chennery believed some such plan or printed account might be\r\nfound among the collection of books belonging to Mr. Treverton. The\r\nthird point was that this same Robert Chennery would receive the loan\r\nof the plan or printed account as one of the greatest favors that\r\ncould be conferred on him. Meditating on the latter fact, with an eye\r\nexclusively fixed on the contemplation of his own interests, Shrowl\r\narrived at the conclusion that it might be well worth his while, in a\r\npecuniary point of view, to try if he could not privately place\r\nhimself in a position to oblige Robert Chennery by searching in secret\r\namong his master\'s books. "It might be worth a five-pound note to me,\r\nif I managed it well," thought Shrowl, putting the letter back in his\r\npocket again, and ascending the stairs thoughtfully to the\r\nlumber-rooms at the top of the house.\r\n\r\nThese rooms were two in number, were entirely unfurnished, and were\r\nlittered all over with the rare collection of books which had once\r\nadorned the library at Porthgenna Tower. Covered with dust, and\r\nscattered in all directions and positions over the floor, lay hundreds\r\nand hundreds of volumes, cast out of their packing-cases as coals are\r\ncast out of their sacks into a cellar. Ancient books, which students\r\nwould have treasured as priceless, lay in chaotic equality of neglect\r\nside by side with modern publications whose chief merit was the beauty\r\nof the binding by which they were inclosed. Into this wilderness of\r\nscattered volumes Shrowl now wandered, fortified by the supreme\r\nself-possession of ignorance, to search resolutely for one particular\r\nbook, with no other light to direct him than the faint glimmer of the\r\ntwo guiding words--Porthgenna Tower. Having got them firmly fixed in\r\nhis mind, his next object was to search until he found them printed on\r\nthe first page of any one of the hundreds of volumes that lay around\r\nhim. This was, for the time being, emphatically his business in life,\r\nand there he now stood, in the largest of the two attics, doggedly\r\nprepared to do it.\r\n\r\nHe cleared away space enough with his feet to enable him to sit down\r\ncomfortably on the floor, and then began to look over all the books\r\nthat lay within arm\'s-length of him. Odd volumes of rare editions of\r\nthe classics, odd volumes of the English historians, odd volumes of\r\nplays by the Elizabethan dramatists, books of travel, books of\r\nsermons, books of jests, books of natural history, books of sport,\r\nturned up in quaint and rapid succession; but no book containing on\r\nthe title-page the words "Porthgenna Tower" rewarded the searching\r\nindustry of Shrowl for the first ten minutes after he had sat himself\r\ndown on the floor.\r\n\r\nBefore removing to another position, and contending with a fresh\r\naccumulation of literary lumber, he paused and considered a little\r\nwith himself, whether there might not be some easier and more orderly\r\nmethod than any he had yet devised of working his way through the\r\nscattered mass of volumes which yet remained to be examined. The\r\nresult of his reflections was that it would be less confusing to him\r\nif he searched through the books in all parts of the room\r\nindifferently, regulating his selection of them solely by their\r\nvarious sizes; disposing of all the largest to begin with; then, after\r\nstowing them away together, proceeding to the next largest, and so\r\ngoing on until he came down at last to the pocket volumes.\r\nAccordingly, he cleared away another morsel of vacant space near the\r\nwall, and then, trampling over the books as coolly as if they were so\r\nmany clods of earth on a ploughed field, picked out the largest of all\r\nthe volumes that lay on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was an atlas; Shrowl turned over the maps, reflected, shook his\r\nhead, and removed the volume to the vacant space which he had cleared\r\nclose to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe next largest book was a magnificently bound collection of engraved\r\nportraits of distinguished characters. Shrowl saluted the\r\ndistinguished characters with a grunt of Gothic disapprobation, and\r\ncarried them off to keep the atlas company against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe third largest book lay under several others. It projected a little\r\nat one end, and it was bound in scarlet morocco. In another position,\r\nor bound in a quieter color, it would probably have escaped notice.\r\nShrowl drew it out with some difficulty, opened it with a portentous\r\nfrown of distrust, looked at the title-page--and suddenly slapped his\r\nthigh with a great oath of exultation. There were the very two words\r\nof which he was in search, staring him in the face, as it were, with\r\nall the emphasis of the largest capital letters.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward the door to make sure that his master was not\r\nmoving in the house; then checked himself and turned back. "What do I\r\ncare," thought Shrowl, "whether he sees me or not? If it comes to a\r\ntustle betwixt us which is to have his own way, I know who\'s master\r\nand who\'s servant in the house by this time." Composing himself with\r\nthat reflection, he turned to the first leaf of the book, with the\r\nintention of looking it over carefully, page by page, from beginning\r\nto end.\r\n\r\nThe first leaf was a blank. The second leaf had an inscription written\r\nat the top of it, in faded ink, which contained these words and\r\ninitials: "Rare. Only six copies printed. J. A. T." Below, on the\r\nmiddle of the leaf, was the printed dedication: "To John Arthur\r\nTreverton, Esquire, Lord of the Manor of Porthgenna, One of his\r\nMajesty\'s Justices of the Peace, F.R.S., etc., etc., etc., this work,\r\nin which an attempt is made to describe the ancient and honored\r\nMansion of his Ancestors--" There were many more lines, filled to\r\nbursting with all the largest and most obsequious words to be found in\r\nthe dictionary; but Shrowl wisely abstained from giving himself the\r\ntrouble of reading them, and turned over at once to the title-page.\r\n\r\nThere were the all-important words: "The History and Antiquities of\r\nPORTHGENNA TOWER. From the period of its first erection to the present\r\ntime; comprising interesting genealogical particulars relating to the\r\nTreverton family; with an inquiry into the Origin of Gothic\r\nArchitecture, and a few thoughts on the Theory of Fortification after\r\nthe period of the Norman Conquest. By the Reverend Job Dark, D.D.,\r\nRector of Porthgenna. The whole adorned with Portraits, Views, and\r\nPlans, executed in the highest style of art. Not published. Printed by\r\nSpaldock and Grimes, Truro, 1734."\r\n\r\nThat was the title-page. The next leaf contained an engraved view of\r\nPorthgenna Tower from the West. Then came several pages devoted to the\r\nOrigin of Gothic Architecture. Then more pages, explaining the Norman\r\nTheory of Fortification. These were succeeded by another\r\nengraving--Porthgenna Tower from the East. After that followed more\r\nreading, under the title of The Treverton Family; and then came the\r\nthird engraving--Porthgenna Tower from the North. Shrowl paused there,\r\nand looked with interest at the leaf opposite the print. It only\r\nannounced more reading still, about the Erection of the Mansion; and\r\nthis was succeeded by engravings from family portraits in the gallery\r\nat Porthgenna. Placing his left thumb between the leaves to mark the\r\nplace, Shrowl impatiently turned to the end of the book, to see what\r\nhe could find there. The last leaf contained a plan of the stables;\r\nthe leaf before that presented a plan of the north garden; and on the\r\nnext leaf, turning backward, was the very thing described in Robert\r\nChennery\'s letter--a plan of the interior arrangement of the north\r\nside of the house!\r\n\r\nShrowl\'s first impulse on making this discovery was to carry the book\r\naway to the safest hiding-place he could find for it, preparatory to\r\nsecretly offering it for sale when the messenger called the next\r\nmorning for an answer to the letter. A little reflection, however,\r\nconvinced him that a proceeding of this sort bore a dangerously close\r\nresemblance to the act of thieving, and might get him into trouble if\r\nthe person with whom he desired to deal asked him any preliminary\r\nquestions touching his right to the volume which he wanted to dispose\r\nof. The only alternative that remained was to make the best copy he\r\ncould of the Plan, and to traffic with that, as a document which the\r\nmost scrupulous person in the world need not hesitate to purchase.\r\n\r\nResolving, after some consideration, to undergo the trouble of making\r\nthe copy rather than run the risk of purloining the book, Shrowl\r\ndescended to the kitchen, took from one of the drawers of the dresser\r\nan old stump of a pen, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled half-sheet of\r\ndirty letter-paper, and returned to the garret to copy the Plan as he\r\nbest might. It was of the simplest kind, and it occupied but a small\r\nportion of the page; yet it presented to his eyes a hopelessly\r\ninvolved and intricate appearance when he now examined it for the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were represented by rows of small squares, with names neatly\r\nprinted inside them; and the positions of doors, staircases, and\r\npassages were indicated by parallel lines of various lengths and\r\nbreadths. After much cogitation, frowning, and pulling at his beard,\r\nit occurred to Shrowl that the easiest method of copying the Plan\r\nwould be to cover it with the letter-paper--which, though hardly half\r\nthe size of the page, was large enough to spread over the engraving on\r\nit--and then to trace the lines which he saw through the paper as\r\ncarefully as he could with his pen and ink. He puffed and snorted and\r\ngrumbled, and got red in the face over his task; but he accomplished\r\nit at last--bating certain drawbacks in the shape of blots and\r\nsmears--in a sufficiently creditable manner; then stopped to let the\r\nink dry and to draw his breath freely, before he attempted to do any\r\nthing more.\r\n\r\nThe next obstacle to be overcome consisted in the difficulty of\r\ncopying the names of the rooms, which were printed inside the squares.\r\nFortunately for Shrowl, who was one of the clumsiest of mankind in the\r\nuse of the pen, none of the names were very long. As it was, he found\r\nthe greatest difficulty in writing them in sufficiently small\r\ncharacters to fit into the squares. One name in particular--that of\r\nthe Myrtle Room--presented combinations of letters, in the word\r\n"Myrtle," which tried his patience and his fingers sorely when he\r\nattempted to reproduce them. Indeed, the result, in this case, when he\r\nhad done his best, was so illegible, even to his eyes, that he wrote\r\nthe word over again in larger characters at the top of the page, and\r\nconnected it by a wavering line with the square which represented the\r\nMyrtle Room. The same accident happened to him in two other instances,\r\nand was remedied in the same way. With the rest of the names, however,\r\nhe succeeded better; and, when he had finally completed the business\r\nof transcription by writing the title, "Plan of the North Side," his\r\ncopy presented, on the whole, a more respectable appearance than might\r\nhave been anticipated. After satisfying himself of its accuracy by a\r\ncareful comparison of it with the original, he folded it up along with\r\nDoctor Chennery\'s letter, and deposited it in his pocket with a hoarse\r\ngasp of relief and a grim smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the garden door of the cottage presented itself to\r\nthe public eye in the totally new aspect of standing hospitably ajar;\r\nand one of the bare posts had the advantage of being embellished by\r\nthe figure of Shrowl, who leaned against it easily, with his legs\r\ncrossed, his hands in his pockets, and his pipe in his mouth, looking\r\nout for the return of the messenger who had delivered Doctor\r\nChennery\'s letter the day before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAPPROACHING THE PRECIPICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling from London to Porthgenna, Mr. and Mrs. Frankland had\r\nstopped, on the ninth of May, at the West Winston station. On the\r\neleventh of June they left it again to continue their journey to\r\nCornwall. On the thirteenth, after resting two nights upon the road,\r\nthey arrived toward the evening at Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\nThere had been storm and rain all the morning; it had lulled toward\r\nthe afternoon, and at the hour when they reached the house the wind\r\nhad dropped, a thick white fog hid the sea from view, and sudden\r\nshowers fell drearily from time to time over the sodden land. Not even\r\na solitary idler from the village was hanging about the west terrace\r\nas the carriage containing Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, the baby, and the\r\ntwo servants drove up to the house.\r\n\r\nNo one was waiting with the door open to receive the travelers; for\r\nall hope of their arriving on that day had been given up, and the\r\nceaseless thundering of the surf, as the stormy sea surged in on the\r\nbeach beneath, drowned the roll of the carriage-wheels over the\r\nterrace road. The driver was obliged to leave his seat and ring at the\r\nbell for admittance. A minute or more elapsed before the door was\r\nopened. With the rain falling sullen and steady on the roof of the\r\ncarriage, with the raw dampness of the atmosphere penetrating through\r\nall coverings and defenses, with the booming of the surf sounding\r\nthreateningly near in the dense obscurity of the fog, the young couple\r\nwaited for admission to their own home, as strangers might have waited\r\nwho had called at an ill-chosen time.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened at last, the master and mistress, whom the\r\nservants would have welcomed with the proper congratulations on any\r\nother occasion, were now received with the proper apologies instead.\r\nMr. Munder, Mrs. Pentreath, Betsey, and Mr. Frankland\'s man all\r\ncrowded together in the hall, and all begged pardon confusedly for\r\nnot having been ready at the door when the carriage drove up. The\r\nappearance of the baby changed the conventional excuses of the\r\nhousekeeper and the maid into conventional expressions of admiration;\r\nbut the men remained grave and gloomy, and spoke of the miserable\r\nweather apologetically, as if the rain and the fog had been of their\r\nown making.\r\n\r\nThe reason for their persistency in dwelling on this one dreary topic\r\ncame out while Mr. and Mrs. Frankland were being conducted up the west\r\nstaircase. The storm of the morning had been fatal to three of the\r\nPorthgenna fishermen, who had been lost with their boat at sea, and\r\nwhose deaths had thrown the whole village into mourning. The servants\r\nhad done nothing but talk of the catastrophe ever since the\r\nintelligence of it had reached them early in the afternoon; and Mr.\r\nMunder now thought it his duty to explain that the absence of the\r\nvillagers, on the occasion of the arrival of his master and mistress,\r\nwas entirely attributable to the effect produced among the little\r\ncommunity by the wreck of the fishing-boat. Under any less lamentable\r\ncircumstances the west terrace would have been crowded, and the\r\nappearance of the carriage would have been welcomed with cheers.\r\n\r\n"Lenny, I almost wish we had waited a little longer before we came\r\nhere," whispered Rosamond, nervously pressing her husband\'s arm. "It\r\nis very dreary and disheartening to return to my first home on such a\r\nday as this. That story of the poor fishermen is a sad story, love, to\r\nwelcome me back to the place of my birth. Let us send the first thing\r\nto-morrow morning, and see what we can do for the poor helpless women\r\nand children. I shall not feel easy in my mind, after hearing that\r\nstory, till we have done something to comfort them."\r\n\r\n"I trust you will approve of the repairs, ma\'am," said the\r\nhousekeeper, pointing to the staircase which led to the second story.\r\n\r\n"The repairs?" said Rosamond, absently. "Repairs! I never hear the\r\nword now, without thinking of the north rooms, and of the plans we\r\ndevised for getting my poor dear father to live in them. Mrs.\r\nPentreath, I have a host of questions to ask you and Mr. Munder about\r\nall the extraordinary things that happened when the mysterious lady\r\nand the incomprehensible foreigner came here. But tell me first--this\r\nis the west front, I suppose?--how far are we from the north rooms? I\r\nmean, how long would it take us to get to them, if we wanted to go now\r\nto that part of the house?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me, ma\'am, not five minutes!" answered Mrs. Pentreath.\r\n\r\n"Not five minutes!" repeated Rosamond, whispering to her husband\r\nagain. "Do you hear that, Lenny? In five minutes we might be in the\r\nMyrtle Room!"\r\n\r\n"Yet," said Mr. Frankland, smiling, "in our present state of\r\nignorance, we are just as far from it as if we were at West Winston\r\nstill."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think that, Lenny. It may be only my fancy, but now we are on\r\nthe spot I feel as if we had driven the mystery into its last\r\nhiding-place. We are actually in the house that holds the Secret; and\r\nnothing will persuade me that we are not half-way already toward\r\nfinding it out. But don\'t let us stop on this cold landing. Which way\r\nare we to go next?"\r\n\r\n"This way, ma\'am," said Mr. Munder, seizing the first opportunity of\r\nplacing himself in a prominent position. "There is a fire in the\r\ndrawing-room. Will you allow me the honor of leading and conducting\r\nyou, Sir, to the apartment in question?" he added, officiously\r\nstretching out his hand to Mr. Frankland.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not!" interposed Rosamond sharply. She had noticed with her\r\nusual quickness of observation that Mr. Munder wanted the delicacy of\r\nfeeling which ought to have restrained him from staring curiously at\r\nhis blind master in her presence, and she was unfavorably disposed\r\ntoward him in consequence. "Wherever the apartment in question may\r\nhappen to be," she continued with satirical emphasis, "I will lead Mr.\r\nFrankland to it, if you please. If you want to make yourself useful,\r\nyou had better go on before us, and open the door."\r\n\r\nOutwardly crest-fallen, but inwardly indignant, Mr. Munder led the way\r\nto the drawing-room. The fire burned brightly, the old-fashioned\r\nfurniture displayed itself to the most picturesque advantage, the\r\npaper on the walls looked comfortably mellow, the carpet, faded as it\r\nwas, felt soft and warm underfoot. Rosamond led her husband to an easy\r\nchair by the fireside, and began to feel at home for the first time.\r\n\r\n"This looks really comfortable," she said. "When we have shut out that\r\ndreary white fog, and the candles are lit, and the tea is on the\r\ntable, we shall have nothing in the world to complain of. You enjoy\r\nthis nice warm atmosphere, don\'t you, Lenny? There is a piano in the\r\nroom, my dear; I can play to you in the evening at Porthgenna just as\r\nI used in London. Nurse, sit down and make yourself and the baby as\r\ncomfortable as you can. Before we take our bonnets off, I must go away\r\nwith Mrs. Pentreath and see about the bedrooms. What is your name, you\r\nvery rosy, good-natured looking girl? Betsey, is it? Well, then,\r\nBetsey, suppose you go down and get the tea; and we shall like you all\r\nthe better if you can contrive to bring us some cold meat with it."\r\nGiving her orders in those good-humored terms, and not noticing that\r\nher husband looked a little uneasy while she was talking so familiarly\r\nto a servant, Rosamond left the room in company with Mrs. Pentreath.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned, her face and manner were altered: she looked and\r\nspoke seriously and quietly.\r\n\r\n"I hope I have arranged every thing for the best, Lenny," she said.\r\n"The airiest and largest room, Mrs. Pentreath tells me, is the room in\r\nwhich my mother died. But I thought we had better not make use of\r\nthat: I felt as if it chilled and saddened me only to look at it.\r\nFarther on, along the passage, there is a room that was my nursery. I\r\nalmost fancied, when Mrs. Pentreath told me she had heard I used to\r\nsleep there, that I remembered the pretty little arched door-way\r\nleading into the second room--the night-nursery it used to be called\r\nin former days. I have ordered the fire to be lit there, and the beds\r\nto be made. There is a third room on the right hand, which\r\ncommunicates with the day-nursery. I think we might manage to\r\nestablish ourselves very comfortably in the three rooms--if you felt\r\nno objection--though they are not so large or so grandly furnished as\r\nthe company bedrooms. I will change the arrangement, if you like--but\r\nthe house looks rather lonesome and dreary, just at first--and my\r\nheart warms to the old nursery--and I think we might at least try it,\r\nto begin with, don\'t you, Lenny?"\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland was quite of his wife\'s opinion, and was ready to accede\r\nto any domestic arrangements that she might think fit to make. While\r\nhe was assuring her of this the tea came up, and the sight of it\r\nhelped to restore Rosamond to her usual spirits. When the meal was\r\nover, she occupied herself in seeing the baby comfortably established\r\nfor the night, in the room on the right hand which communicated with\r\nthe day-nursery. That maternal duty performed, she came back to her\r\nhusband in the drawing-room; and the conversation between them\r\nturned--as it almost always turned now when they were alone--on the\r\ntwo perplexing subjects of Mrs. Jazeph and the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\n"I wish it was not night," said Rosamond. "I should like to begin\r\nexploring at once. Mind, Lenny, you must be with me in all my\r\ninvestigations. I lend you my eyes, and you give me your advice. You\r\nmust never lose patience, and never tell me that you can be of no use.\r\nHow I do wish we were starting on our voyage of discovery at this very\r\nmoment! But we may make inquiries, at any rate," she continued,\r\nringing the bell. "Let us have the housekeeper and the steward up, and\r\ntry if we can\'t make them tell us something more than they told us in\r\ntheir letter."\r\n\r\nThe bell was answered by Betsey. Rosamond desired that Mr. Munder and\r\nMrs. Pentreath might be sent up stairs. Betsey having heard Mrs.\r\nFrankland express her intention of questioning the housekeeper and the\r\nsteward, guessed why they were wanted, and smiled mysteriously.\r\n\r\n"Did _you_ see any thing of those strange visitors who behaved so\r\noddly?" asked Rosamond, detecting the smile. "Yes, I am sure you did.\r\nTell us what you saw. We want to hear every thing that happened--every\r\nthing, down to the smallest trifle."\r\n\r\nAppealed to in these direct terms, Betsey contrived, with much\r\ncircumlocution and confusion, to relate what her own personal\r\nexperience had been of the proceedings of Mrs. Jazeph and her foreign\r\ncompanion. When she had done, Rosamond stopped her on her way to the\r\ndoor by asking this question--\r\n\r\n"You say the lady was found lying in a fainting-fit at the top of the\r\nstairs. Have you any notion, Betsey, why she fainted?"\r\n\r\nThe servant hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Come! come!" said Rosamond. "You have some notion, I can see. Tell us\r\nwhat it is."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you will be angry with me, ma\'am," said Betsey, expressing\r\nembarrassment by drawing lines slowly with her forefinger on a table\r\nat her side.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! I shall only be angry with you if you won\'t speak. Why do\r\nyou think the lady fainted?"\r\n\r\nBetsey drew a very long line with her embarrassed forefinger, wiped it\r\nafterward on her apron, and answered--\r\n\r\n"I think she fainted, if you please, ma\'am, because she see the\r\nghost."\r\n\r\n"The ghost! What! is there a ghost in the house? Lenny, here is a\r\nromance that we never expected. What sort of ghost is it? Let us have\r\nthe whole story."\r\n\r\nThe whole story, as Betsey told it, was not of a nature to afford her\r\nhearers any extraordinary information, or to keep them very long in\r\nsuspense. The ghost was a lady who had been at a remote period the\r\nwife of one of the owners of Porthgenna Tower, and who had been guilty\r\nof deceiving her husband in some way unknown. She had been condemned\r\nin consequence to walk about the north rooms as long as ever the walls\r\nof them held together. She had long, curling, light-brown hair, and\r\nvery white teeth, and a dimple in each cheek, and was altogether\r\n"awful beautiful" to look at. Her approach was heralded to any mortal\r\ncreature who was unfortunate enough to fall in her way by the blowing\r\nof a cold wind, and nobody who had once felt that wind had the\r\nslightest chance of ever feeling warm again. That was all Betsey knew\r\nabout the ghost; and it was in her opinion enough to freeze a person\'s\r\nblood only to think of it.\r\n\r\nRosamond smiled, then looked grave again. "I wish you could have told\r\nus a little more," she said. "But, as you can not, we must try Mrs.\r\nPentreath and Mr. Munder next. Send them up here, if you please,\r\nBetsey, as soon as you get down stairs."\r\n\r\nThe examination of the housekeeper and the steward led to no result\r\nwhatever. Nothing more than they had already communicated in their\r\nletter to Mrs. Frankland could be extracted from either of them. Mr.\r\nMunder\'s dominant idea was that the foreigner had entered the doors of\r\nPorthgenna Tower with felonious ideas on the subject of the family\r\nplate. Mrs. Pentreath concurred in that opinion, and mentioned, in\r\nconnection with it, her own private impression that the lady in the\r\nquiet dress was an unfortunate person who had escaped from a\r\nmad-house. As to giving a word of advice, or suggesting a plan for\r\nsolving the mystery, neither the housekeeper nor the steward appeared\r\nto think that the rendering of any assistance of that sort lay at all\r\nwithin their province. They took their own practical view of the\r\nsuspicious conduct of the two strangers, and no mortal power could\r\npersuade them to look an inch beyond it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the stupidity, the provoking, impenetrable, pretentious stupidity\r\nof respectable English servants!" exclaimed Rosamond, when she and her\r\nhusband were alone again. "No help, Lenny, to be hoped for from either\r\nof those two people. We have nothing to trust to now but the\r\nexamination of the house to-morrow; and that resource may fail us,\r\nlike all the rest. What can Doctor Chennery be about? Why did we not\r\nhear from him before we left West Winston?"\r\n\r\n"Patience, Rosamond, patience. We shall see what the post brings\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t talk about patience, dear! My stock of that virtue was\r\nnever a very large one, and it was all exhausted ten days ago, at\r\nleast. Oh, the weeks and weeks I have been vainly asking myself--Why\r\nshould Mrs. Jazeph warn me against going into the Myrtle Room? Is she\r\nafraid of my discovering a crime? or afraid of my tumbling through the\r\nfloor? What did she want to do in the room, when she made that attempt\r\nto get into it? Why, in the name of wonder, should she know something\r\nabout this house that I never knew, that my father never knew, that\r\nnobody else--"\r\n\r\n"Rosamond!" cried Mr. Frankland, suddenly changing color, and starting\r\nin his chair--"I think I can guess who Mrs. Jazeph is!"\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, Lenny! What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Something in those last words of yours started the idea in my mind\r\nthe instant you spoke. Do you remember, when we were staying at St.\r\nSwithin\'s-on-Sea, and talking about the chances for and against our\r\nprevailing on your father to live with us here--do you remember,\r\nRosamond, telling me at that time of certain unpleasant associations\r\nwhich he had with the house, and mentioning among them the mysterious\r\ndisappearance of a servant on the morning of your mother\'s death?"\r\n\r\nRosamond turned pale at the question. "How came we never to think of\r\nthat before?" she said.\r\n\r\n"You told me," pursued Mr. Frankland, "that this servant left a\r\nstrange letter behind her, in which she confessed that your mother had\r\ncharged her with the duty of telling a secret to your father--a secret\r\nthat she was afraid to divulge, and that she was afraid of being\r\nquestioned about. I am right, am I not, in stating those two reasons\r\nas the reasons she gave for her disappearance?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right."\r\n\r\n"And your father never heard of her again?"\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"It is a bold guess to make, Rosamond, but the impression is strong on\r\nmy mind that, on the day when Mrs. Jazeph came into your room at West\r\nWinston, you and that servant met, and _she_ knew it!"\r\n\r\n"And the Secret, dear--the Secret she was afraid to tell my father?"\r\n\r\n"Must be in some way connected with the Myrtle Room."\r\n\r\nRosamond said nothing in answer. She rose from her chair, and began to\r\nwalk agitatedly up and down the room. Hearing the rustle of her dress,\r\nLeonard called her to him, and, taking her hand, laid his fingers on\r\nher pulse, and then lifted them for a moment to her cheek.\r\n\r\n"I wish I had waited until to-morrow morning before I told you my idea\r\nabout Mrs. Jazeph," he said. "I have agitated you to no purpose\r\nwhatever, and have spoiled your chance of a good night\'s rest."\r\n\r\n"No, no! nothing of the kind. Oh, Lenny, how this guess of yours adds\r\nto the interest--the fearful, breathless interest--we have in tracing\r\nthat woman, and in finding out the Myrtle Room. Do you think--?"\r\n\r\n"I have done with thinking for the night, my dear; and you must have\r\ndone with it too. We have said more than enough about Mrs. Jazeph\r\nalready. Change the subject, and I will talk of any thing else you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"It is not so easy to change the subject," said Rosamond, pouting, and\r\nmoving away to walk up and down the room again.\r\n\r\n"Then let us change the place, and make it easier that way. I know you\r\nthink me the most provokingly obstinate man in the world, but there is\r\nreason in my obstinacy, and you will acknowledge as much when you\r\nawake to-morrow morning refreshed by a good night\'s rest. Come, let us\r\ngive our anxieties a holiday. Take me into one of the other rooms, and\r\nlet me try if I can guess what it is like by touching the furniture."\r\n\r\nThe reference to his blindness which the last words contained brought\r\nRosamond to his side in a moment. "You always know best," she said,\r\nputting her arm round his neck and kissing him. "I was looking cross,\r\nlove, a minute ago, but the clouds are all gone now. We will change\r\nthe scene, and explore some other room, as you propose."\r\n\r\nShe paused, her eyes suddenly sparkled, her color rose, and she smiled\r\nto herself as if some new fancy had that instant crossed her mind.\r\n\r\n"Lenny, I will take you where you shall touch a very remarkable piece\r\nof furniture indeed," she resumed, leading him to the door while she\r\nspoke. "We will see if you can tell me at once what it is like. You\r\nmust not be impatient, mind; and you must promise to touch nothing\r\ntill you feel me guiding your hand."\r\n\r\nShe drew him after her along the passage, opened the door of the room\r\nin which the baby had been put to bed, made a sign to the nurse to be\r\nsilent, and, leading Leonard up to the cot, guided his hand down\r\ngently, so as to let the tips of his fingers touch the child\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"There, Sir!" she cried, her face beaming with happiness as she saw\r\nthe sudden flush of surprise and pleasure which changed her husband\'s\r\nnatural quiet, subdued expression in an instant. "What do you say to\r\nthat piece of furniture? Is it a chair, or a table? Or is it the most\r\nprecious thing in all the house, in all Cornwall, in all England, in\r\nall the world? Kiss it, and see what it is--a bust of a baby by a\r\nsculptor, or a living cherub by your wife!" She turned, laughing, to\r\nthe nurse--"Hannah, you look so serious that I am sure you must be\r\nhungry. Have you had your supper yet?" The woman smiled, and answered\r\nthat she had arranged to go down stairs, as soon as one of the\r\nservants could relieve her in taking care of the child. "Go at once,"\r\nsaid Rosamond. "I will stop here and look after the baby. Get your\r\nsupper, and come back again in half an hour."\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse had left the room, Rosamond placed a chair for Leonard\r\nby the side of the cot, and seated herself on a low stool at his\r\nknees. Her variable disposition seemed to change again when she did\r\nthis; her face grew thoughtful, her eyes softened, as they turned, now\r\non her husband, now on the bed in which the child was sleeping by his\r\nside. After a minute or two of silence, she took one of his hands,\r\nplaced it on his knee, and laid her cheek gently down on it.\r\n\r\n"Lenny," she said, rather sadly, "I wonder whether we are any of us\r\ncapable of feeling perfect happiness in this world?"\r\n\r\n"What makes you ask that question, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy that I could feel perfect happiness, and yet--"\r\n\r\n"And yet what?"\r\n\r\n"And yet it seems as if, with all my blessings, that blessing was\r\nnever likely to be granted to me. I should be perfectly happy now but\r\nfor one little thing. I suppose you can\'t guess what that thing is?"\r\n\r\n"I would rather you told me, Rosamond."\r\n\r\n"Ever since our child was born, love, I have had a little aching at\r\nthe heart--especially when we are all three together, as we are now--a\r\nlittle sorrow that I can\'t quite put away from me on your account."\r\n\r\n"On my account! Lift up your head, Rosamond, and come nearer to me. I\r\nfeel something on my hand which tells me that you are crying."\r\n\r\nShe rose directly, and laid her face close to his. "My own love," she\r\nsaid, clasping her arms fast round him. "My own heart\'s darling, you\r\nhave never seen our child."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Rosamond, I see him with your eyes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lenny! I tell you every thing I can--I do my best to lighten the\r\ncruel, cruel darkness which shuts you out from that lovely little face\r\nlying so close to you! But can I tell you how he looks when he first\r\nbegins to take notice? can I tell you all the thousand pretty things\r\nhe will do when he first tries to talk? God has been very merciful to\r\nus--but, oh, how much more heavily the sense of your affliction weighs\r\non me now when I am more to you than your wife--now when I am the\r\nmother of your child!"\r\n\r\n"And yet that affliction ought to weigh lightly on your spirits,\r\nRosamond, for you have made it weigh lightly on mine."\r\n\r\n"Have I? Really and truly, have I? It is something noble to live for,\r\nLenny, if I can live for that! It is some comfort to hear you say, as\r\nyou said just now, that you see with my eyes. They shall always serve\r\nyou--oh, always! always!--as faithfully as if they were your own. The\r\nveriest trifle of a visible thing that I look at with any interest,\r\nyou shall as good as look at too. I might have had my own little\r\nharmless secrets, dear, with another husband; but with you to have\r\neven so much as a thought in secret seems like taking the basest, the\r\ncruelest advantage of your blindness. I do love you so, Lenny! I am so\r\nmuch fonder of you now than I was when we were first married--I never\r\nthought I should be, but I am. You are so much handsomer to me, so\r\nmuch cleverer to me, so much more precious to me in every way. But I\r\nam always telling you that, am I not? Do you get tired of hearing me?\r\nNo? Are you sure of that? Very, very, very sure?" She stopped, and\r\nlooked at him earnestly, with a smile on her lips, and the tears still\r\nglistening in her eyes. Just then the child stirred a little in his\r\ncot, and drew her attention away. She arranged the bed-clothes over\r\nhim, watched him in silence for a little while, then sat down again on\r\nthe stool at Leonard\'s feet. "Baby has turned his face quite round\r\ntoward you now," she said. "Shall I tell you exactly how he looks, and\r\nwhat his bed is like, and how the room is furnished?"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she began to describe the child\'s\r\nappearance and position with the marvelous minuteness of a woman\'s\r\nobservation. While she proceeded, her elastic spirits recovered\r\nthemselves, and its naturally bright happy expression re-appeared on\r\nher face. By the time the nurse returned to her post, Rosamond was\r\ntalking with all her accustomed vivacity, and amusing her husband with\r\nall her accustomed success.\r\n\r\nWhen they went back to the drawing-room, she opened the piano and sat\r\ndown to play. "I must give you your usual evening concert, Lenny," she\r\nsaid, "or I shall be talking again on the forbidden subject of the\r\nMyrtle Room."\r\n\r\nShe played some of Mr. Frankland\'s favorite airs, with a certain union\r\nof feeling and fancifulness in her execution of the music, which\r\nseemed to blend the charm of her own disposition with the charm of the\r\nmelodies which sprang into life under her touch. After playing through\r\nthe airs she could remember most easily, she ended with the Last Waltz\r\nof Weber. It was Leonard\'s favorite, and it was always reserved on\r\nthat account to grace the close of the evening\'s performance.\r\n\r\nShe lingered longer than usual over the last plaintive notes of the\r\nwaltz; then suddenly left the piano, and hastened across the room to\r\nthe fire-place.\r\n\r\n"Surely it has turned much colder within the last minute or two," she\r\nsaid, kneeling down on the rug, and holding her face and hands over\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"Has it?" returned Leonard. "I don\'t feel any change."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have caught cold," said Rosamond. "Or perhaps," she added,\r\nlaughing rather uneasily, "the wind that goes before the ghostly lady\r\nof the north rooms has been blowing over me. I certainly felt\r\nsomething like a sudden chill, Lenny, while I was playing the last\r\nnotes of Weber."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Rosamond. You are overfatigued and overexcited. Tell your\r\nmaid to make you some hot wine and water, and lose no time in getting\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\nRosamond cowered closer over the fire. "It\'s lucky I am not\r\nsuperstitious," she said, "or I might fancy that I was predestined to\r\nsee the ghost."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSTANDING ON THE BRINK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first night at Porthgenna passed without the slightest noise or\r\ninterruption of any kind. No ghost, or dream of a ghost, disturbed the\r\nsoundness of Rosamond\'s slumbers. She awoke in her usual spirits and\r\nher usual health, and was out in the west garden before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudy, and the wind veered about capriciously to all the\r\npoints of the compass. In the course of her walk Rosamond met with the\r\ngardener, and asked him what he thought about the weather. The man\r\nreplied that it might rain again before noon, but that, unless he was\r\nvery much mistaken, it was going to turn to heat in the course of the\r\nnext four-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\n"Pray, did you ever hear of a room on the north side of our old house\r\ncalled the Myrtle Room?" inquired Rosamond. She had resolved, on\r\nrising that morning, not to lose a chance of making the all-important\r\ndiscovery for want of asking questions of every body in the\r\nneighborhood; and she began with the gardener accordingly.\r\n\r\n"I never heard tell of it, ma\'am," said the man. "But it\'s a likely\r\nname enough, considering how the myrtles do grow in these parts."\r\n\r\n"Are there any myrtles growing at the north side of the house?" asked\r\nRosamond, struck with the idea of tracing the mysterious room by\r\nsearching for it outside the building instead of inside. "I mean close\r\nto the walls," she added, seeing the man look puzzled; "under the\r\nwindows, you know?"\r\n\r\n"I never see any thing under the windows in my time but weeds and\r\nrubbish," replied the gardener.\r\n\r\nJust then the breakfast-bell rang. Rosamond returned to the house,\r\ndetermined to explore the north garden, and if she found any relic of\r\na bed of myrtles to mark the window above it, and to have the room\r\nwhich that window lighted opened immediately. She confided this new\r\nscheme to her husband. He complimented her on her ingenuity, but\r\nconfessed that he had no great hope of any discoveries being made out\r\nof doors, after what the gardener had said about the weeds and\r\nrubbish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as breakfast was over, Rosamond rang the bell to order the\r\ngardener to be in attendance, and to say that the keys of the north\r\nrooms would be wanted. The summons was answered by Mr. Frankland\'s\r\nservant, who brought up with him the morning\'s supply of letters,\r\nwhich the postman had just delivered. Rosamond turned them over\r\neagerly, pounced on one with an exclamation of delight, and said to\r\nher husband--"The Long Beckley postmark! News from the vicar, at\r\nlast!"\r\n\r\nShe opened the letter and ran her eye over it--then suddenly dropped\r\nit in her lap with her face all in a glow. "Lenny!" she exclaimed,\r\n"there is news here that is positively enough to turn one\'s head. I\r\ndeclare the vicar\'s letter has quite taken away my breath!"\r\n\r\n"Read it," said Mr. Frankland; "pray read it at once."\r\n\r\nRosamond complied with the request in a very faltering, unsteady\r\nvoice. Doctor Chennery began his letter by announcing that his\r\napplication to Andrew Treverton had remained unanswered; but he added\r\nthat it had, nevertheless, produced results which no one could\r\npossibly have anticipated. For information on the subject of those\r\nresults, he referred Mr. and Mrs. Frankland to a copy subjoined of a\r\ncommunication marked private, which he had received from his man of\r\nbusiness in London.\r\n\r\nThe communication contained a detailed report of an interview which\r\nhad taken place between Mr. Treverton\'s servant and the messenger who\r\nhad called for an answer to Doctor Chennery\'s letter. Shrowl, it\r\nappeared, had opened the interview by delivering his master\'s message,\r\nhad then produced the vicar\'s torn letter and the copy of the Plan,\r\nand had announced his readiness to part with the latter for the\r\nconsideration of a five-pound note. The messenger had explained that\r\nhe had no power to treat for the document, and had advised Mr.\r\nTreverton\'s servant to wait on Doctor Chennery\'s agent. After some\r\nhesitation, Shrowl had decided to do this, on pretense of going out on\r\nan errand--had seen the agent--had been questioned about how he became\r\npossessed of the copy--and, finding that there would be no chance of\r\ndisposing of it unless he answered all inquiries, had related the\r\ncircumstances under which the copy had been made. After hearing his\r\nstatement, the agent had engaged to apply immediately for instructions\r\nto Doctor Chennery; and had written accordingly, mentioning in a\r\npostscript that he had seen the transcribed Plan, and had ascertained\r\nthat it really exhibited the positions of doors, staircases, and\r\nrooms, with the names attached to them.\r\n\r\nResuming his own letter, Doctor Chennery proceeded to say that he must\r\nnow leave it entirely to Mr. and Mrs. Frankland to decide what course\r\nthey ought to adopt. He had already compromised himself a little in\r\nhis own estimation, by assuming a character which really did not\r\nbelong to him, when he made his application to Andrew Treverton; and\r\nhe felt he could personally venture no further in the affair, either\r\nby expressing an opinion or giving any advice, now that it had assumed\r\nsuch a totally new aspect. He felt quite sure that his young friends\r\nwould arrive at the wise and the right decision, after they had\r\nmaturely considered the matter in all its bearings. In that\r\nconviction, he had instructed his man of business not to stir in the\r\naffair until he had heard from Mr. Frankland, and to be guided\r\nentirely by any directions which that gentleman might give.\r\n\r\n"Directions!" exclaimed Rosamond, crumpling up the letter in a high\r\nstate of excitement as soon as she had read to the end of it. "All the\r\ndirections we have to give may be written in a minute and read in a\r\nsecond! What in the world does the vicar mean by talking about mature\r\nconsideration? Of course," cried Rosamond, looking, womanlike,\r\nstraight on to the purpose she had in view, without wasting a thought\r\non the means by which it was to be achieved--"Of course we give the\r\nman his five-pound note, and get the Plan by return of post!"\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland shook his head gravely. "Quite impossible," he said. "If\r\nyou think for a moment, my dear, you will surely see that it is out of\r\nthe question to traffic with a servant for information that has been\r\nsurreptitiously obtained from his master\'s library."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! dear! don\'t say that!" pleaded Rosamond, looking quite\r\naghast at the view her husband took of the matter. "What harm are we\r\ndoing, if we give the man his five pounds? He has only made a copy of\r\nthe Plan: he has not stolen any thing."\r\n\r\n"He has stolen information, according to my idea of it," said Leonard.\r\n\r\n"Well, but if he has," persisted Rosamond, "what harm does it do to\r\nhis master? In my opinion his master deserves to have the information\r\nstolen, for not having had the common politeness to send it to the\r\nvicar. We _must_ have the Plan--oh, Lenny, don\'t shake your head,\r\nplease!--we must have it, you know we must! What is the use of being\r\nscrupulous with an old wretch (I must call him so, though he _is_ my\r\nuncle) who won\'t conform to the commonest usages of society? You can\'t\r\ndeal with him--and I am sure the vicar would say so, if he was\r\nhere--as you would with civilized people, or people in their senses,\r\nwhich every body says he is not. What use is the Plan of the north\r\nrooms to him? And, besides, if it is of any use, he has got the\r\noriginal; so his information is not stolen, after all, because he has\r\ngot it the whole time--has he not, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Rosamond! Rosamond!" said Leonard, smiling at his wife\'s transparent\r\nsophistries, "you are trying to reason like a Jesuit."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care who I reason like, love, as long as I get the Plan."\r\n\r\nMr. Frankland still shook his head. Finding her arguments of no avail,\r\nRosamond wisely resorted to the immemorial weapon of her\r\nsex--Persuasion; using it at such close quarters and to such good\r\npurposes that she finally won her husband\'s reluctant consent to a\r\nspecies of compromise, which granted her leave to give directions for\r\npurchasing the copied Plan on one condition.\r\n\r\nThis condition was that they should send back the Plan to Mr.\r\nTreverton as soon as it had served their purpose; making a full\r\nacknowledgment to him of the manner in which it had been obtained, and\r\npleading in justification of the proceeding his own want of courtesy\r\nin withholding information, of no consequence in itself, which any one\r\nelse in his place would have communicated as a matter of course.\r\nRosamond tried hard to obtain the withdrawal or modification of this\r\ncondition; but her husband\'s sensitive pride was not to be touched, on\r\nthat point, with impunity, even by her light hand. "I have done too\r\nmuch violence already to my own convictions," he said, "and I will now\r\ndo no more. If we are to degrade ourselves by dealing with this\r\nservant, let us at least prevent him from claiming us as his\r\naccomplices. Write in my name, Rosamond, to Doctor Chennery\'s man of\r\nbusiness, and say that we are willing to purchase the transcribed Plan\r\non the condition that I have stated--which condition he will of course\r\nplace before the servant in the plainest possible terms."\r\n\r\n"And suppose the servant refuses to risk losing his place, which he\r\nmust do if he accepts your condition?" said Rosamond, going rather\r\nreluctantly to the writing-table.\r\n\r\n"Let us not worry ourselves, my dear, by supposing any thing. Let us\r\nwait and hear what happens, and act accordingly. When you are ready to\r\nwrite, tell me, and I will dictate your letter on this occasion. I\r\nwish to make the vicar\'s man of business understand that we act as we\r\ndo, knowing, in the first place, that Mr. Andrew Treverton can not be\r\ndealt with according to the established usages of society; and\r\nknowing, in the second place, that the information which his servant\r\noffers to us is contained in an extract from a printed book, and is in\r\nno way, directly or indirectly, connected with Mr. Treverton\'s private\r\naffairs. Now that you have made me consent to this compromise,\r\nRosamond, I must justify it as completely as possible to others as\r\nwell as to myself."\r\n\r\nSeeing that his resolution was firmly settled, Rosamond had tact\r\nenough to abstain from saying any thing more. The letter was written\r\nexactly as Leonard dictated it. When it had been placed in the\r\npost-bag, and when the other letters of the morning had been read and\r\nanswered, Mr. Frankland reminded his wife of the intention she had\r\nexpressed at breakfast-time of visiting the north garden, and\r\nrequested that she would take him there with her. He candidly\r\nacknowledged that, since he had been made acquainted with Doctor\r\nChennery\'s letter, he would give five times the sum demanded by Shrowl\r\nfor the copy of the Plan if the Myrtle Room could be discovered,\r\nwithout assistance from any one, before the letter to the vicar\'s man\r\nof business was put into the post. Nothing would give him so much\r\npleasure, he said, as to be able to throw it into the fire, and to\r\nsend a plain refusal to treat for the Plan in its place.\r\n\r\nThey went into the north garden, and there Rosamond\'s own eyes\r\nconvinced her that she had not the slightest chance of discovering any\r\nvestige of a myrtle-bed near any one of the windows. From the garden\r\nthey returned to the house, and had the door opened that led into the\r\nnorth hall.\r\n\r\nThey were shown the place on the pavement where the keys had been\r\nfound, and the place at the top of the first flight of stairs where\r\nMrs. Jazeph had been discovered when the alarm was given. At Mr.\r\nFrankland\'s suggestion, the door of the room which immediately fronted\r\nthis spot was opened. It presented a dreary spectacle of dust and dirt\r\nand dimness. Some old pictures were piled against one of the walls,\r\nsome tattered chairs were heaped together in the middle of the floor,\r\nsome broken china lay on the mantel-piece, and a rotten cabinet,\r\ncracked through from top to bottom, stood in one corner. These few\r\nrelics of the furnishing and fitting-up of the room were all carefully\r\nexamined, but nothing of the smallest importance--nothing tending in\r\nthe most remote degree to clear up the mystery of the Myrtle\r\nRoom--was discovered.\r\n\r\n"Shall we have the other doors opened?" inquired Rosamond when they\r\ncame out on the landing again.\r\n\r\n"I think it will be useless," replied her husband. "Our only hope of\r\nfinding out the mystery of the Myrtle Room--if it is as deeply hidden\r\nfrom us as I believe it to be--is by searching for it in that room,\r\nand no other. The search, to be effectual, must extend, if we find it\r\nnecessary, to the pulling up of the floor and wainscots--perhaps even\r\nto the dismantling of the walls. We may do that with one room when we\r\nknow where it is, but we can not, by any process short of pulling the\r\nwhole side of the house down, do it with the sixteen rooms, through\r\nwhich our present ignorance condemns us to wander without guide or\r\nclew. It is hopeless enough to be looking for we know not what; but\r\nlet us discover, if we can, where the four walls are within which that\r\nunpromising search must begin and end. Surely the floor of the landing\r\nmust be dusty? Are there no foot-marks on it, after Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nvisit, that might lead us to the right door?"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion led to a search for footsteps on the dusty floor of\r\nthe landing, but nothing of the sort could be found. Matting had been\r\nlaid down over the floor at some former period, and the surface, torn,\r\nragged, and rotten with age, was too uneven in every part to allow the\r\ndust to lie smoothly on it. Here and there, where there was a hole\r\nthrough to the boards of the landing, Mr. Frankland\'s servant thought\r\nhe detected marks in the dust which might have been produced by the\r\ntoe or the heel of a shoe; but these faint and doubtful indications\r\nlay yards and yards apart from each other, and to draw any conclusion\r\nof the slightest importance from them was simply and plainly\r\nimpossible. After spending more than an hour in examining the north\r\nside of the house, Rosamond was obliged to confess that the servants\r\nwere right when they predicted, on first opening the door in the hall,\r\nthat she would discover nothing.\r\n\r\n"The letter must go, Lenny," she said, when they returned to the\r\nbreakfast-room.\r\n\r\n"There is no help for it," answered her husband. "Send away the\r\npost-bag, and let us say no more about it."\r\n\r\nThe letter was dispatched by that day\'s post. In the remote position\r\nof Porthgenna, and in the unfinished state of the railroad at that\r\ntime, two days would elapse before an answer from London could be\r\nreasonably hoped for. Feeling that it would be better for Rosamond if\r\nthis period of suspense was passed out of the house, Mr. Frankland\r\nproposed to fill up the time by a little excursion along the coast to\r\nsome places famous for their scenery, which would be likely to\r\ninterest his wife, and which she might occupy herself pleasantly in\r\ndescribing on the spot for the benefit of her husband. This suggestion\r\nwas immediately acted on. The young couple left Porthgenna, and only\r\nreturned on the evening of the second day.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day the longed-for letter from the vicar\'s\r\nman of business lay on the table when Leonard and Rosamond entered the\r\nbreakfast-room. Shrowl had decided to accept Mr. Frankland\'s\r\ncondition--first, because he held that any man must be out of his\r\nsenses who refused a five-pound note when it was offered to him;\r\nsecondly, because he believed that his master was too absolutely\r\ndependent on him to turn him away for any cause whatever; thirdly,\r\nbecause, if Mr. Treverton did part with him, he was not sufficiently\r\nattached to his place to care at all about losing it. Accordingly the\r\nbargain had been struck in five minutes--and there was the copy of the\r\nPlan, inclosed with the letter of explanation to attest the fact!\r\n\r\nRosamond spread the all-important document out on the table with\r\ntrembling hands, looked it over eagerly for a few moments, and laid\r\nher finger on the square that represented the position of the Myrtle\r\nRoom.\r\n\r\n"Here it is!" she cried. "Oh, Lenny, how my heart beats! One, two,\r\nthree, four--the fourth door on the first-floor landing is the door of\r\nthe Myrtle Room!"\r\n\r\nShe would have called at once for the keys of the north rooms; but her\r\nhusband insisted on her waiting until she had composed herself a\r\nlittle, and until she had taken some breakfast. In spite of all he\r\ncould say, the meal was hurried over so rapidly that in ten minutes\r\nmore his wife\'s arm was in his, and she was leading him to the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nThe gardener\'s prognostication about the weather had been verified: it\r\nhad turned to heat--heavy, misty, vaporous, dull heat. One white\r\nquivering fog-cloud spread thinly over all the heaven, rolled down\r\nseaward on the horizon line, and dulled the sharp edges of the distant\r\nmoorland view. The sunlight shone pale and trembling; the lightest,\r\nhighest leaves of flowers at open windows were still; the domestic\r\nanimals lay about sleepily in dark corners. Chance household noises\r\nsounded heavy and loud in the languid, airless stillness which the\r\nheat seemed to hold over the earth. Down in the servants\' hall, the\r\nusual bustle of morning work was suspended. When Rosamond looked in,\r\non her way to the housekeeper\'s room to get the keys, the women were\r\nfanning themselves, and the men were sitting with their coats off.\r\nThey were all talking peevishly about the heat, and all agreeing that\r\nsuch a day as that, in the month of June, they had never known and\r\nnever heard of before.\r\n\r\nRosamond took the keys, declined the housekeeper\'s offer to accompany\r\nher, and leading her husband along the passages, unlocked the door of\r\nthe north hall.\r\n\r\n"How unnaturally cool it is here!" she said, as they entered the\r\ndeserted place.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs she stopped, and took a firmer hold of her\r\nhusband\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Is any thing the matter?" asked Leonard. "Is the change to the damp\r\ncoolness of this place affecting you in any way?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," she answered hastily. "I am far too excited to feel either\r\nheat or damp, as I might feel them at other times. But, Lenny,\r\nsupposing your guess about Mrs. Jazeph is right?--"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"And, supposing we discover the Secret of the Myrtle Room, might it\r\nnot turn out to be something concerning my father or my mother which\r\nwe ought not to know? I thought of that when Mrs. Pentreath offered to\r\naccompany us, and it determined me to come here alone with you."\r\n\r\n"It is just as likely that the Secret might be something we ought to\r\nknow," replied Mr. Frankland, after a moment\'s thought. "In any case,\r\nmy idea about Mrs. Jazeph is, after all, only a guess in the dark.\r\nHowever, Rosamond, if you feel any hesitation--"\r\n\r\n"No! come what may of it, Lenny, we can\'t go back now. Give me your\r\nhand again. We have traced the mystery thus far together, and together\r\nwe will find it out."\r\n\r\nShe ascended the staircase, leading him after her, as she spoke. On\r\nthe landing she looked again at the Plan, and satisfied herself that\r\nthe first impression she had derived from it, of the position of the\r\nMyrtle Room, was correct. She counted the doors on to the fourth, and\r\nlooked out from the bunch the key numbered "IV.," and put it in the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nBefore she turned it she paused, and looked round at her husband.\r\n\r\nHe was standing by her side, with his patient face turned expectantly\r\ntoward the door. She put her right hand on the key, turned it slowly\r\nin the lock, drew him closer to her with her left hand, and paused\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what has come to me," she whispered faintly. "I feel as\r\nif I was afraid to push open the door."\r\n\r\n"Your hand is cold, Rosamond. Wait a little--lock the door again--put\r\nit off till another day."\r\n\r\nHe felt his wife\'s fingers close tighter and tighter on his hand while\r\nhe said those words. Then there was an instant--one memorable,\r\nbreathless instant, never to be forgotten afterward--of utter silence.\r\nThen he heard the sharp, cracking sound of the opening door, and felt\r\nhimself drawn forward suddenly into a changed atmosphere, and knew\r\nthat Rosamond and he were in the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE MYRTLE ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: "BEFORE SHE TURNED IT SHE PAUSED, AND LOOKED ROUND AT\r\n   HER HUSBAND."]\r\n\r\nA broad, square window, with small panes and dark sashes; dreary\r\nyellow light, glimmering through the dirt of half a century crusted on\r\nthe glass; purer rays striking across the dimness through the fissures\r\nof three broken panes; dust floating upward, pouring downward, rolling\r\nsmoothly round and round in the still atmosphere; lofty, bare, faded\r\nred walls; chairs in confusion, tables placed awry; a tall black\r\nbook-case, with an open door half dropping from its hinges; a\r\npedestal, with a broken bust lying in fragments at its feet; a ceiling\r\ndarkened by stains, a floor whitened by dust--such was the aspect\r\nof the Myrtle Room when Rosamond first entered it, leading her husband\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the door-way, she slowly advanced a few steps, and then\r\nstopped, waiting with every sense on the watch, with every faculty\r\nstrung up to the highest pitch of expectation--waiting in the ominous\r\nstillness, in the forlorn solitude, for the vague Something which the\r\nroom might contain, which might rise visibly before her, which might\r\nsound audibly behind her, which might touch her on a sudden from\r\nabove, from below, from either side. A minute or more she breathlessly\r\nwaited; and nothing appeared, nothing sounded, nothing touched her.\r\nThe silence and the solitude had their secret to keep, and kept it.\r\n\r\nShe looked round at her husband. His face, so quiet and composed at\r\nother times, expressed doubt and uneasiness now. His disengaged hand\r\nwas outstretched, and moving backward and forward and up and down, in\r\nthe vain attempt to touch something which might enable him to guess at\r\nthe position in which he was placed. His look and action, as he stood\r\nin that new and strange sphere, the mute appeal which he made so sadly\r\nand so unconsciously to his wife\'s loving help, restored Rosamond\'s\r\nself-possession by recalling her heart to the dearest of all its\r\ninterests, to the holiest of all its cares. Her eyes, fixed so\r\ndistrustfully but the moment before on the dreary spectacle of neglect\r\nand ruin which spread around them, turned fondly to her husband\'s\r\nface, radiant with the unfathomable brightness of pity and love. She\r\nbent quickly across him, caught his outstretched arm, and pressed it\r\nto his side.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that, darling," she said, gently; "I don\'t like to see it.\r\nIt looks as if you had forgotten that I was with you--as if you were\r\nleft alone and helpless. What need have you of your sense of touch,\r\nwhen you have got _me_? Did you hear me open the door, Lenny? Do you\r\nknow that we are in the Myrtle Room?"\r\n\r\n"What did you see, Rosamond, when you opened the door? What do you see\r\nnow?" He asked those questions rapidly and eagerly, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but dust and dirt and desolation. The loneliest moor in\r\nCornwall is not so lonely looking as this room; but there is nothing\r\nto alarm us, nothing (except one\'s own fancy) that suggests an idea of\r\ndanger of any kind."\r\n\r\n"What made you so long before you spoke to me, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"I was frightened, love, on first entering the room--not at what I\r\nsaw, but at my own fanciful ideas of what I might see. I was child\r\nenough to be afraid of something starting out of the walls, or of\r\nsomething rising through the floor; in short, of I hardly know what. I\r\nhave got over those fears, Lenny, but a certain distrust of the room\r\nstill clings to me. Do you feel it?"\r\n\r\n"I feel something like it," he replied, uneasily. "I feel as if the\r\nnight that is always before my eyes was darker to me in this place\r\nthan in any other. Where are we standing now?"\r\n\r\n"Just inside the door."\r\n\r\n"Does the floor look safe to walk on?" He tried it suspiciously with\r\nhis foot as he put the question.\r\n\r\n"Quite safe," replied Rosamond. "It would never support the furniture\r\nthat is on it if it was so rotten as to be dangerous. Come across the\r\nroom with me, and try it." With these words she led him slowly to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"The air seems as if it was nearer to me," he said, bending his face\r\nforward toward the lowest of the broken panes. "What is before us\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\nShe told him, describing minutely the size and appearance of the\r\nwindow. He turned from it carelessly, as if that part of the room had\r\nno interest for him. Rosamond still lingered near the window, to try\r\nif she could feel a breath of the outer atmosphere. There was a\r\nmomentary silence, which was broken by her husband.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing now?" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I am looking out at one of the broken panes of glass, and trying to\r\nget some air," answered Rosamond. "The shadow of the house is below\r\nme, resting on the lonely garden; but there is no coolness breathing\r\nup from it. I see the tall weeds rising straight and still, and the\r\ntangled wild-flowers interlacing themselves heavily. There is a tree\r\nnear me, and the leaves look as if they were all struck motionless.\r\nAway to the left, there is a peep of white sea and tawny sand\r\nquivering in the yellow heat. There are no clouds; there is no blue\r\nsky. The mist quenches the brightness of the sunlight, and lets\r\nnothing but the fire of it through. There is something threatening in\r\nthe sky, and the earth seems to know it!"\r\n\r\n"But the room! the room!" said Leonard, drawing her aside from the\r\nwindow. "Never mind the view; tell me what the room is like--exactly\r\nwhat it is like. I shall not feel easy about you, Rosamond, if you\r\ndon\'t describe every thing to me just as it is."\r\n\r\n"My darling! You know you can depend on my describing every thing. I\r\nam only doubting where to begin, and how to make sure of seeing for\r\nyou what you are likely to think most worth looking at. Here is an old\r\nottoman against the wall--the wall where the window is. I will take\r\noff my apron and dust the seat for you; and then you can sit down and\r\nlisten comfortably while I tell you, before we think of any thing\r\nelse, what the room is like, to begin with. First of all, I suppose, I\r\nmust make you understand how large it is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is the first thing. Try if you can compare it with any room\r\nthat I was familiar with before I lost my sight."\r\n\r\nRosamond looked backward and forward, from wall to wall--then went to\r\nthe fire-place, and walked slowly down the length of the room,\r\ncounting her steps. Pacing over the dusty floor with a dainty\r\nregularity and a childish satisfaction in looking down at the gay pink\r\nrosettes on her morning shoes; holding up her crisp, bright muslin\r\ndress out of the dirt, and showing the fanciful embroidery of her\r\npetticoat, and the glossy stockings that fitted her little feet and\r\nankles like a second skin, she moved through the dreariness, the\r\ndesolation, the dingy ruin of the scene around her, the most charming\r\nliving contrast to its dead gloom that youth, health, and beauty could\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nArrived at the bottom of the room, she reflected a little, and said to\r\nher husband--\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the blue drawing-room, Lenny, in your father\'s house\r\nat Long Beckley? I think this room is quite as large, if not larger."\r\n\r\n"What are the walls like?" asked Leonard, placing his hand on the wall\r\nbehind him while he spoke. "They are covered with paper, are they\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; with faded red paper, except on one side, where strips have been\r\ntorn off and thrown on the floor. There is wainscoting round the\r\nwalls. It is cracked in many places, and has ragged holes in it, which\r\nseem to have been made by the rats and mice."\r\n\r\n"Are there any pictures on the walls?"\r\n\r\n"No. There is an empty frame over the fire-place. And opposite--I mean\r\njust above where I am standing now--there is a small mirror, cracked\r\nin the centre, with broken branches for candlesticks projecting on\r\neither side of it. Above that, again, there is a stag\'s head and\r\nantlers; some of the face has dropped away, and a perfect maze of\r\ncobwebs is stretched between the horns. On the other walls there are\r\nlarge nails, with more cobwebs hanging down from them heavy with\r\ndirt--but no pictures any where. Now you know every thing about the\r\nwalls. What is the next thing? The floor?"\r\n\r\n"I think, Rosamond, my feet have told me already what the floor is\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"They may have told you that it is bare, dear; but I can tell you more\r\nthan that. It slopes down from every side toward the middle of the\r\nroom. It is covered thick with dust, which is swept about--I suppose\r\nby the wind blowing through the broken panes--into strange, wavy,\r\nfeathery shapes that quite hide the floor beneath. Lenny! suppose\r\nthese boards should be made to take up any where! If we discover\r\nnothing to-day, we will have them swept to-morrow. In the mean time, I\r\nmust go on telling you about the room, must I not? You know already\r\nwhat the size of it is, what the window is like, what the walls are\r\nlike, what the floor is like. Is there any thing else before we come\r\nto the furniture? Oh, yes! the ceiling--for that completes the shell\r\nof the room. I can\'t see much of it, it is so high. There are great\r\ncracks and stains from one end to the other, and the plaster has come\r\naway in patches in some places. The centre ornament seems to be made\r\nof alternate rows of small plaster cabbages and large plaster\r\nlozenges. Two bits of chain hang down from the middle, which, I\r\nsuppose, once held a chandelier. The cornice is so dingy that I can\r\nhardly tell what pattern it represents. It is very broad and heavy,\r\nand it looks in some places as if it had once been colored, and that\r\nis all I can say about it. Do you feel as if you thoroughly understood\r\nthe whole room now, Lenny?"\r\n\r\n"Thoroughly, my love; I have the same clear picture of it in my mind\r\nwhich you always give me of every thing you see. You need waste no\r\nmore time on me. We may now devote ourselves to the purpose for which\r\nwe came here."\r\n\r\nAt those last words, the smile which had been dawning on Rosamond\'s\r\nface when her husband addressed her, vanished from it in a moment. She\r\nstole close to his side, and, bending down over him, with her arm on\r\nhis shoulder, said, in low, whispering tones--\r\n\r\n"When we had the other room opened, opposite the landing, we began by\r\nexamining the furniture. We thought--if you remember--that the mystery\r\nof the Myrtle Room might be connected with hidden valuables that had\r\nbeen stolen, or hidden papers that ought to have been destroyed, or\r\nhidden stains and traces of some crime, which even a chair or a table\r\nmight betray. Shall we examine the furniture here?"\r\n\r\n"Is there much of it, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"More than there was in the other room," she answered.\r\n\r\n"More than you can examine in one morning?"\r\n\r\n"No; I think not."\r\n\r\n"Then begin with the furniture, if you have no better plan to propose.\r\nI am but a helpless adviser at such a crisis as this. I must leave the\r\nresponsibilities of decision, after all, to rest on your shoulders.\r\nYours are the eyes that look and the hands that search; and if the\r\nsecret of Mrs. Jazeph\'s reason for warning you against entering this\r\nroom is to be found by seeking in the room, _you_ will find it--"\r\n\r\n"And you will know it, Lenny, as soon as it is found. I won\'t hear you\r\ntalk, love, as if there was any difference between us, or any\r\nsuperiority in my position over yours. Now, let me see. What shall I\r\nbegin with? The tall book-case opposite the window? or the dingy old\r\nwriting-table, in the recess behind the fire-place? Those are the two\r\nlargest pieces of furniture that I can see in the room."\r\n\r\n"Begin with the book-case, my dear, as you seem to have noticed that\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\nRosamond advanced a few steps toward the book-case--then stopped, and\r\nlooked aside suddenly to the lower end of the room.\r\n\r\n"Lenny! I forgot one thing, when I was telling you about the walls,"\r\nshe said. "There are two doors in the room besides the door we came in\r\nat. They are both in the wall to the right, as I stand now with my\r\nback to the window. Each is at the same distance from the corner, and\r\neach is of the same size and appearance. Don\'t you think we ought to\r\nopen them and see where they lead to?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. But are the keys in the locks?"\r\n\r\nRosamond approached more closely to the doors, and answered in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n"Open them, then," said Leonard. "Stop! not by yourself. Take me with\r\nyou. I don\'t like the idea of sitting here, and leaving you to open\r\nthose doors by yourself."\r\n\r\nRosamond retraced her steps to the place where he was sitting, and\r\nthen led him with her to the door that was farthest from the window.\r\n"Suppose there should be some dreadful sight behind it!" she said,\r\ntrembling a little, as she stretched out her hand toward the key.\r\n\r\n"Try to suppose (what is much more probable) that it only leads into\r\nanother room," suggested Leonard.\r\n\r\nRosamond threw the door wide open, suddenly. Her husband was right. It\r\nmerely led into the next room.\r\n\r\nThey passed on to the second door. "Can this one serve the same\r\npurpose as the other?" said Rosamond, slowly and distrustfully turning\r\nthe key.\r\n\r\nShe opened it as she had opened the first door, put her head inside it\r\nfor an instant, drew back, shuddering, and closed it again violently,\r\nwith a faint exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be alarmed, Lenny," she said, leading him away abruptly. "The\r\ndoor only opens on a large, empty cupboard. But there are quantities\r\nof horrible, crawling brown creatures about the wall inside. I have\r\nshut them in again in their darkness and their secrecy; and now I am\r\ngoing to take you back to your seat, before we find out, next, what\r\nthe book-case contains."\r\n\r\nThe door of the upper part of the book-case, hanging open and half\r\ndropping from its hinges, showed the emptiness of the shelves on one\r\nside at a glance. The corresponding door, when Rosamond pulled it\r\nopen, disclosed exactly the same spectacle of barrenness on the other\r\nside. Over every shelf there spread the same dreary accumulation of\r\ndust and dirt, without a vestige of a book, without even a stray scrap\r\nof paper lying any where in a corner to attract the eye, from top to\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the book-case was divided into three cupboards.\r\nIn the door of one of the three, the rusty key remained in the lock.\r\nRosamond turned it with some difficulty, and looked into the cupboard.\r\nAt the back of it were scattered a pack of playing-cards, brown with\r\ndirt. A morsel of torn, tangled muslin lay among them, which, when\r\nRosamond spread it out, proved to be the remains of a clergyman\'s\r\nband. In one corner she found a broken corkscrew and the winch of a\r\nfishing-rod; in another, some stumps of tobacco-pipes, a few old\r\nmedicine bottles, and a dog\'s-eared peddler\'s song-book. These were\r\nall the objects that the cupboard contained. After Rosamond had\r\nscrupulously described each one of them to her husband, just as she\r\nfound it, she went on to the second cupboard. On trying the door, it\r\nturned out not to be locked. On looking inside, she discovered nothing\r\nbut some pieces of blackened cotton wool, and the remains of a\r\njeweler\'s packing-case.\r\n\r\nThe third door was locked, but the rusty key from the first cupboard\r\nopened it. Inside, there was but one object--a small wooden box,\r\nbanded round with a piece of tape, the two edges of which were\r\nfastened together by a seal. Rosamond\'s flagging interest rallied\r\ninstantly at this discovery. She described the box to her husband, and\r\nasked if he thought she was justified in breaking the seal.\r\n\r\n"Can you see any thing written on the cover?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nRosamond carried the box to the window, blew the dust off the top of\r\nit, and read, on a parchment label nailed to the cover: "Papers. John\r\nArthur Treverton. 1760."\r\n\r\n"I think you may take the responsibility of breaking the seal," said\r\nLeonard. "If those papers had been of any family importance, they\r\ncould scarcely have been left forgotten in an old book-case by your\r\nfather and his executors."\r\n\r\nRosamond broke the seal, then looked up doubtfully at her husband\r\nbefore she opened the box. "It seems a mere waste of time to look into\r\nthis," she said. "How can a box that has not been opened since\r\nseventeen hundred and sixty help us to discover the mystery of Mrs.\r\nJazeph and the Myrtle Room?"\r\n\r\n"But do we know that it has not been opened since then?" said Leonard.\r\n"Might not the tape and seal have been put round it by any body at\r\nsome more recent period of time? You can judge best, because you can\r\nsee if there is any inscription on the tape, or any signs to form an\r\nopinion by upon the seal."\r\n\r\n"The seal is a blank, Lenny, except that it has a flower like a\r\nforget-me-not in the middle. I can see no mark of a pen on either side\r\nof the tape. Any body in the world might have opened the box before\r\nme," she continued, forcing up the lid easily with her hands, "for the\r\nlock is no protection to it. The wood of the cover is so rotten that I\r\nhave pulled the staple out, and left it sticking by itself in the lock\r\nbelow."\r\n\r\nOn examination the box proved to be full of papers. At the top of the\r\nuppermost packet were written these words: "Election expenses. I won\r\nby four votes. Price fifty pounds each. J. A. Treverton." The next\r\nlayer of papers had no inscription. Rosamond opened them, and read on\r\nthe first leaf--"Birthday Ode. Respectfully addressed to the M\xc3\xa6cenas\r\nof modern times in his poetic retirement at Porthgenna." Below this\r\nproduction appeared a collection of old bills, old notes of\r\ninvitation, old doctor\'s prescriptions, and old leaves of\r\nbetting-books, tied together with a piece of whip-cord. Last of all,\r\nthere lay on the bottom of the box one thin leaf of paper, the visible\r\nside of which presented a perfect blank. Rosamond took it up, turned\r\nit to look at the other side, and saw some faint ink-lines crossing\r\neach other in various directions, and having letters of the alphabet\r\nattached to them in certain places. She had made her husband\r\nacquainted with the contents of all the other papers, as a matter of\r\ncourse; and when she had described this last paper to him, he\r\nexplained to her that the lines and letters represented a mathematical\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n"The book-case tells us nothing," said Rosamond, slowly putting the\r\npapers back in the box. "Shall we try the writing-table by the\r\nfire-place, next?"\r\n\r\n"What does it look like, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"It has two rows of drawers down each side; and the whole top is made\r\nin an odd, old-fashioned way to slope upward, like a very large\r\nwriting-desk."\r\n\r\n"Does the top open?"\r\n\r\nRosamond went to the table, examined it narrowly, and then tried to\r\nraise the top. "It is made to open, for I see the key-hole," she said.\r\n"But it is locked. And all the drawers," she continued, trying them\r\none after another, "are locked too."\r\n\r\n"Is there no key in any of them?" asked Leonard.\r\n\r\n"Not a sign of one. But the top feels so loose that I really think it\r\nmight be forced open--as I forced the little box open just now--by a\r\npair of stronger hands than I can boast of. Let me take you to the\r\ntable, dear; it may give way to your strength, though it will not to\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nShe placed her husband\'s hands carefully under the ledge formed by the\r\noverhanging top of the table. He exerted his whole strength to force\r\nit up; but in this case the wood was sound, the lock held, and all his\r\nefforts were in vain.\r\n\r\n"Must we send for a locksmith?" asked Rosamond, with a look of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n"If the table is of any value, we must," returned her husband. "If\r\nnot, a screw-driver and a hammer will open both the top and the\r\ndrawers in any body\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"In that case, Lenny, I wish we had brought them with us when we came\r\ninto the room, for the only value of the table lies in the secrets\r\nthat it may be hiding from us. I shall not feel satisfied until you\r\nand I know what there is inside of it."\r\n\r\nWhile saying these words, she took her husband\'s hand to lead him back\r\nto his seat. As they passed before the fire-place, he stepped upon the\r\nbare stone hearth; and, feeling some new substance under his feet,\r\ninstinctively stretched out the hand that was free. It touched a\r\nmarble tablet, with figures on it in bass-relief, which had been let\r\ninto the middle of the chimney-piece. He stopped immediately, and\r\nasked what the object was that his fingers had accidentally touched.\r\n\r\n"A piece of sculpture," said Rosamond. "I did not notice it before. It\r\nis not very large, and not particularly attractive, according to my\r\ntaste. So far as I can tell, it seems to be intended to represent--"\r\n\r\nLeonard stopped her before she could say any more. "Let me try, for\r\nonce, if I can\'t make a discovery for myself," he said, a little\r\nimpatiently. "Let me try if my fingers won\'t tell me what this\r\nsculpture is meant to represent."\r\n\r\nHe passed his hands carefully over the bass-relief (Rosamond watching\r\ntheir slightest movement with silent interest, the while), considered\r\na little, and said--\r\n\r\n"Is there not a figure of a man sitting down, in the right-hand\r\ncorner? And are there not rocks and trees, very stiffly done, high up,\r\nat the left-hand side?"\r\n\r\nRosamond looked at him tenderly, and smiled. "My poor dear!" she said.\r\n"Your man sitting down is, in reality, a miniature copy of the famous\r\nancient statue of Niobe and her child; your rocks are marble\r\nimitations of clouds, and your stiffly done trees are arrows darting\r\nout from some invisible Jupiter or Apollo, or other heathen god. Ah,\r\nLenny, Lenny! you can\'t trust your touch, love, as you can trust me!"\r\n\r\nA momentary shade of vexation passed across his face; but it vanished\r\nthe instant she took his hand again to lead him back to his seat. He\r\ndrew her to him gently, and kissed her cheek. "You are right,\r\nRosamond," he said. "The one faithful friend to me in my blindness,\r\nwho never fails, is my wife."\r\n\r\nSeeing him look a little saddened, and feeling, with the quick\r\nintuition of a woman\'s affection, that he was thinking of the days\r\nwhen he had enjoyed the blessing of sight, Rosamond returned abruptly,\r\nas soon as she saw him seated once more on the ottoman, to the subject\r\nof the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\n"Where shall I look next, dear?" she said. "The book-case we have\r\nexamined. The writing-table we must wait to examine. What else is\r\nthere that has a cupboard or a drawer in it?" She looked round her in\r\nperplexity; then walked away toward the part of the room to which her\r\nattention had been last drawn--the part where the fire-place was\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n"I thought I noticed something here, Lenny, when I passed just now\r\nwith you," she said, approaching the second recess behind the\r\nmantel-piece, corresponding with the recess in which the writing-table\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nShe looked into the place closely, and detected in a corner, darkened\r\nby the shadow of the heavy projecting mantel-piece, a narrow, rickety\r\nlittle table, made of the commonest mahogany--the frailest, poorest,\r\nleast conspicuous piece of furniture in the whole room. She pushed it\r\nout contemptuously into the light with her foot. It ran on clumsy\r\nold-fashioned casters, and creaked wearily as it moved.\r\n\r\n"Lenny, I have found another table," said Rosamond. "A miserable,\r\nforlorn-looking little thing, lost in a corner. I have just pushed it\r\ninto the light, and I have discovered one drawer in it." She paused,\r\nand tried to open the drawer; but it resisted her. "Another lock!" she\r\nexclaimed, impatiently. "Even this wretched thing is closed against\r\nus!"\r\n\r\nShe pushed the table sharply away with her hand. It swayed on its\r\nfrail legs, tottered, and fell over on the floor--fell as heavily as a\r\ntable of twice its size--fell with a shock that rang through the room,\r\nand repeated itself again and again in the echoes of the lonesome\r\nnorth hall.\r\n\r\nRosamond ran to her husband, seeing him start from his seat in alarm,\r\nand told him what had happened. "You call it a little table," he\r\nreplied, in astonishment. "It fell like one of the largest pieces of\r\nfurniture in the room!"\r\n\r\n"Surely there must have been something heavy in the drawer!" said\r\nRosamond, approaching the table with her spirits still fluttered by\r\nthe shock of its unnaturally heavy fall. After waiting for a few\r\nmoments to give the dust which it had raised, and which still hung\r\nover it in thick lazy clouds, time to disperse, she stooped down and\r\nexamined it. It was cracked across the top from end to end, and the\r\nlock had been broken away from its fastenings by the fall.\r\n\r\nShe set the table up again carefully, drew out the drawer, and, after\r\na glance at its contents, turned to her husband. "I knew it," she\r\nsaid, "I knew there must be something heavy in the drawer. It is full\r\nof pieces of copper-ore, like those specimens of my father\'s, Lenny,\r\nfrom Porthgenna mine. Wait! I think I feel something else, as far away\r\nat the back here as my hand can reach."\r\n\r\nShe extricated from the lumps of ore at the back of the drawer a small\r\ncircular picture-frame of black wood, about the size of an ordinary\r\nhand-glass. It came out with the front part downward, and with the\r\narea which its circle inclosed filled up by a thin piece of wood, of\r\nthe sort which is used at the backs of small frames to keep drawings\r\nand engravings steady in them. This piece of wood (only secured to the\r\nback of the frame by one nail) had been forced out of its place,\r\nprobably by the overthrow of the table; and when Rosamond took the\r\nframe out of the drawer, she observed between it and the dislodged\r\npiece of wood the end of a morsel of paper, apparently folded many\r\ntimes over, so as to occupy the smallest possible space. She drew out\r\nthe piece of paper, laid it aside on the table without unfolding it,\r\nreplaced the piece of wood in its proper position, and then turned the\r\nframe round, to see if there was a picture in front.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture--a picture painted in oils, darkened, but not much\r\nfaded, by age. It represented the head of a woman, and the figure as\r\nfar as the bosom.\r\n\r\nThe instant Rosamond\'s eyes fell on it she shuddered, and hurriedly\r\nadvanced toward her husband with the picture in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, what have you found now?" he inquired, hearing her approach.\r\n\r\n"A picture," she answered, faintly, stopping to look at it again.\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s sensitive ear detected a change in her voice. "Is there any\r\nthing that alarms you in the picture?" he asked, half in jest, half in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n"There is something that startles me--something that seems to have\r\nturned me cold for the moment, hot as the day is," said Rosamond. "Do\r\nyou remember the description the servant-girl gave us, on the night we\r\narrived here, of the ghost of the north rooms?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember it perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Lenny! that description and this picture are exactly alike! Here is\r\nthe curling, light-brown hair. Here is the dimple on each cheek. Here\r\nare the bright regular teeth. Here is that leering, wicked, fatal\r\nbeauty which the girl tried to describe, and did describe, when she\r\nsaid it was awful!"\r\n\r\nLeonard smiled. "That vivid fancy of yours, my dear, takes strange\r\nflights sometimes," he said, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Fancy!" repeated Rosamond to herself. "How can it be fancy when I see\r\nthe face? how can it be fancy when I feel--" She stopped, shuddered\r\nagain, and, returning hastily to the table, placed the picture on it,\r\nface downward. As she did so, the morsel of folded paper which she had\r\nremoved from the back of the frame caught her eye.\r\n\r\n"There may be some account of the picture in this," she said, and\r\nstretched out her hand to it.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on toward noon. The heat weighed heavier on the air,\r\nand the stillness of all things was more intense than ever, as she\r\ntook up the paper from the table.\r\n\r\nFold by fold she opened it, and saw that there were written characters\r\ninside, traced in ink that had faded to a light, yellow hue. She\r\nsmoothed it out carefully on the table--then took it up again and\r\nlooked at the first line of the writing.\r\n\r\nThe first line contained only three words--words which told her that\r\nthe paper with the writing on it was not a description of the picture,\r\nbut a letter--words which made her start and change color the moment\r\nher eye fell upon them. Without attempting to read any further, she\r\nhastily turned over the leaf to find out the place where the writing\r\nended.\r\n\r\nIt ended at the bottom of the third page; but there was a break in the\r\nlines, near the foot of the second page, and in that break there were\r\ntwo names signed. She looked at the uppermost of the two--started\r\nagain--and turned back instantly to the first page.\r\n\r\nLine by line, and word by word, she read through the writing; her\r\nnatural complexion fading out gradually the while, and a dull, equal\r\nwhiteness overspreading all her face in its stead. When she had come\r\nto the end of the third page, the hand in which she held the letter\r\ndropped to her side, and she turned her head slowly toward Leonard. In\r\nthat position she stood--no tears moistening her eyes, no change\r\npassing over her features, no word escaping her lips, no movement\r\nvarying the position of her limbs--in that position she stood, with\r\nthe fatal letter crumpled up in her cold fingers, looking steadfastly,\r\nspeechlessly, breathlessly at her blind husband.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting as she had seen him a few minutes before, with\r\nhis legs crossed, his hands clasped together in front of them, and his\r\nhead turned expectantly in the direction in which he had last heard\r\nthe sound of his wife\'s voice. But in a few moments the intense\r\nstillness in the room forced itself upon his attention. He changed his\r\nposition--listened for a little, turning his head uneasily from side\r\nto side, and then called to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Rosamond!"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice her lips moved, and her fingers closed\r\nfaster on the paper that they held; but she neither stepped forward\r\nnor spoke.\r\n\r\n"Rosamond!"\r\n\r\nHer lips moved again--faint traces of expression began to pass\r\nshadow-like over the blank whiteness of her face--she advanced one\r\nstep, hesitated, looked at the letter, and stopped.\r\n\r\nHearing no answer, he rose surprised and uneasy. Moving his poor,\r\nhelpless, wandering hands to and fro before him in the air, he walked\r\nforward a few paces, straight out from the wall against which he had\r\nbeen sitting. A chair, which his hands were not held low enough to\r\ntouch, stood in his way; and, as he still advanced, he struck his knee\r\nsharply against it.\r\n\r\nA cry burst from Rosamond\'s lips, as if the pain of the blow had\r\npassed, at the instant of its infliction, from her husband to herself.\r\nShe was by his side in a moment. "You are not hurt, Lenny," she said,\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n"No, no." He tried to press his hand on the place where he had struck\r\nhimself, but she knelt down quickly, and put her own hand there\r\ninstead, nestling her head against him, while she was on her knees, in\r\na strangely hesitating timid way. He lightly laid the hand which she\r\nhad intercepted on her shoulder. The moment it touched her, her eyes\r\nbegan to soften; the tears rose in them, and fell slowly one by one\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I thought you had left me," he said. "There was such a silence that I\r\nfancied you had gone out of the room."\r\n\r\n"Will you come out of it with me now?" Her strength seemed to fail her\r\nwhile she asked the question; her head drooped on her breast, and she\r\nlet the letter fall on the floor at her side.\r\n\r\n"Are you tired already, Rosamond? Your voice sounds as if you were."\r\n\r\n"I want to leave the room," she said, still in the same low, faint,\r\nconstrained tone. "Is your knee easier, dear? Can you walk now?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. There is nothing in the world the matter with my knee. If\r\nyou are tired, Rosamond--as I know you are, though you may not\r\nconfess it--the sooner we leave the room the better."\r\n\r\nShe appeared not to hear the last words he said. Her fingers were\r\nworking feverishly about her neck and bosom; two bright red spots were\r\nbeginning to burn in her pale cheeks; her eyes were fixed vacantly on\r\nthe letter at her side; her hands wavered about it before she picked\r\nit up. For a few seconds she waited on her knees, looking at it\r\nintently, with her head turned away from her husband--then rose and\r\nwalked to the fire-place. Among the dust, ashes, and other rubbish at\r\nthe back of the grate, were scattered some old torn pieces of paper.\r\nThey caught her eye, and held it fixed on them. She looked and looked,\r\nslowly bending down nearer and nearer to the grate. For one moment she\r\nheld the letter out over the rubbish in both hands--the next she drew\r\nback shuddering violently, and turned round so as to face her husband\r\nagain. At the sight of him a faint inarticulate exclamation, half\r\nsigh, half sob, burst from her. "Oh, no, no!" she whispered to\r\nherself, clasping her hands together fervently, and looking at him\r\nwith fond, mournful eyes. "Never, never, Lenny--come of it what may!"\r\n\r\n"Were you speaking to me, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, love. I was saying--" She paused, and, with trembling fingers,\r\nfolded up the paper again, exactly in the form in which she had found\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" he asked. "Your voice sounds away from me at the\r\nother end of the room again. Where are you?"\r\n\r\nShe ran to him, flushed and trembling and tearful, took him by the\r\narm, and, without an instant of hesitation, without the faintest sign\r\nof irresolution in her face, placed the folded paper boldly in his\r\nhand. "Keep that, Lenny," she said, turning deadly pale, but still not\r\nlosing her firmness. "Keep that, and ask me to read it to you as soon\r\nas we are out of the Myrtle Room."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The last thing I have found, love," she replied, looking at him\r\nearnestly, with a deep sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n"Is it of any importance?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, she suddenly caught him to her bosom, clung to\r\nhim with all the fervor of her impulsive nature, and breathlessly and\r\npassionately covered his face with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Gently! gently!" said Leonard, laughing. "You take away my breath."\r\n\r\nShe drew back, and stood looking at him in silence, with a hand laid\r\non each of his shoulders. "Oh, my angel!" she murmured tenderly. "I\r\nwould give all I have in the world, if I could only know how much you\r\nlove me!"\r\n\r\n"Surely," he returned, still laughing--"Surely, Rosamond, you ought to\r\nknow by this time!"\r\n\r\n"I shall know soon." She spoke those words in tones so quiet and low\r\nthat they were barely audible. Interpreting the change in her voice as\r\na fresh indication of fatigue, Leonard invited her to lead him away by\r\nholding out his hand. She took it in silence, and guided him slowly to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE TELLING OF THE SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn their way back to the inhabited side of the house, Rosamond made no\r\nfurther reference to the subject of the folded paper which she had\r\nplaced in her husband\'s hands.\r\n\r\nAll her attention, while they were returning to the west front, seemed\r\nto be absorbed in the one act of jealously watching every inch of\r\nground that Leonard walked over, to make sure that it was safe and\r\nsmooth before she suffered him to set his foot on it. Careful and\r\nconsiderate as she had always been, from the first day of their\r\nmarried life, whenever she led him from one place to another, she was\r\nnow unduly, almost absurdly anxious to preserve him from the remotest\r\npossibility of an accident. Finding that he was the nearest to the\r\noutside of the open landing when they left the Myrtle Room, she\r\ninsisted on changing places, so that he might be nearest to the wall.\r\nWhile they were descending the stairs, she stopped him in the middle,\r\nto inquire if he felt any pain in the knee which he had struck against\r\nthe chair. At the last step she brought him to a stand-still again,\r\nwhile she moved away the torn and tangled remains of an old mat, for\r\nfear one of his feet should catch in it. Walking across the north\r\nhall, she intreated that he would take her arm and lean heavily upon\r\nher, because she felt sure that his knee was not quite free from\r\nstiffness yet. Even at the short flight of stairs which connected the\r\nentrance to the hall with the passages leading to the west side of the\r\nhouse, she twice stopped him on the way down, to place his foot on the\r\nsound parts of the steps, which she represented as dangerously worn\r\naway in more places than one. He laughed good-humoredly at her\r\nexcessive anxiety to save him from all danger of stumbling, and asked\r\nif there was any likelihood, with their numerous stoppages, of getting\r\nback to the west side of the house in time for lunch. She was not\r\nready, as usual, with her retort; his laugh found no pleasant echo in\r\nhers; she only answered that it was impossible to be too anxious about\r\nhim; and then went on in silence till they reached the door of the\r\nhousekeeper\'s room.\r\n\r\nLeaving him for a moment outside, she went in to give the keys back\r\nagain to Mrs. Pentreath.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, ma\'am!" exclaimed the housekeeper, "you look quite overcome\r\nby the heat of the day and the close air of those old rooms. Can I get\r\nyou a glass of water, or may I give you my bottle of salts?"\r\n\r\nRosamond declined both offers.\r\n\r\n"May I be allowed to ask, ma\'am, if any thing has been found this time\r\nin the north rooms?" inquired Mrs. Pentreath, hanging up the bunch of\r\nkeys.\r\n\r\n"Only some old papers," replied Rosamond, turning away.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon again, ma\'am," pursued the housekeeper; "but, in case\r\nany of the gentry of the neighborhood should call to-day?"\r\n\r\n"We are engaged. No matter who it may be, we are both engaged."\r\nAnswering briefly in these terms, Rosamond left Mrs. Pentreath, and\r\nrejoined her husband.\r\n\r\nWith the same excess of attention and care which she had shown on the\r\nway to the housekeeper\'s room, she now led him up the west staircase.\r\nThe library door happening to stand open, they passed through it on\r\ntheir way to the drawing-room, which was the larger and cooler\r\napartment of the two. Having guided Leonard to a seat, Rosamond\r\nreturned to the library, and took from the table a tray containing a\r\nbottle of water and a tumbler, which she had noticed when she passed\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n"I may feel faint as well as frightened," she said quickly to herself,\r\nturning round with the tray in her hand to return to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nAfter she had put the water down on a table in a corner, she\r\nnoiselessly locked the door leading into the library, then the door\r\nleading into the passage. Leonard, hearing her moving about, advised\r\nher to keep quiet on the sofa. She patted him gently on the cheek, and\r\nwas about to make some suitable answer, when she accidentally beheld\r\nher face reflected in the looking-glass under which he was sitting.\r\nThe sight of her own white cheeks and startled eyes suspended the\r\nwords on her lips. She hastened away to the window, to catch any\r\nbreath of air that might be wafted toward her from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe heat-mist still hid the horizon. Nearer, the oily, colorless\r\nsurface of the water was just visible, heaving slowly, from time to\r\ntime, in one vast monotonous wave that rolled itself out smoothly and\r\nendlessly till it was lost in the white obscurity of the mist. Close\r\non the shore the noisy surf was hushed. No sound came from the beach\r\nexcept at long, wearily long intervals, when a quick thump, and a\r\nstill splash, just audible and no more, announced the fall of one\r\ntiny, mimic wave upon the parching sand. On the terrace in front of\r\nthe house, the changeless hum of summer insects was all that told of\r\nlife and movement. Not a human figure was to be seen any where on the\r\nshore; no sign of a sail loomed shadowy through the heat at sea; no\r\nbreath of air waved the light tendrils of the creepers that twined up\r\nthe house-wall, or refreshed the drooping flowers ranged in the\r\nwindows. Rosamond turned away from the outer prospect, after a\r\nmoment\'s weary contemplation of it. As she looked into the room again,\r\nher husband spoke to her.\r\n\r\n"What precious thing lies hidden in this paper?" he asked, producing\r\nthe letter, and smiling as he opened it. "Surely there must be\r\nsomething besides writing--some inestimable powder, or some bank-note\r\nof fabulous value--wrapped up in all these folds?"\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s heart sank within her as he opened the letter and passed\r\nhis finger over the writing inside, with a mock expression of anxiety,\r\nand a light jest about sharing all treasures discovered at Porthgenna\r\nwith his wife.\r\n\r\n"I will read it to you directly, Lenny," she said, dropping into the\r\nnearest seat, and languidly pushing her hair back from her temples.\r\n"But put it away for a few minutes now, and let us talk of any thing\r\nelse you like that does not remind us of the Myrtle Room. I am very\r\ncapricious, am I not, to be so suddenly weary of the very subject that\r\nI have been fondest of talking about for so many weeks past? Tell me,\r\nlove," she added, rising abruptly and going to the back of his chair;\r\n"do I get worse with my whims and fancies and faults?--or am I\r\nimproved, since the time when we were first married?"\r\n\r\nHe tossed the letter aside carelessly on a table which was always\r\nplaced by the arm of his chair, and shook his forefinger at her with a\r\nfrown of comic reproof. "Oh, fie, Rosamond! are you trying to entrap\r\nme into paying you compliments?"\r\n\r\nThe light tone that he persisted in adopting seemed absolutely to\r\nterrify her. She shrank away from his chair, and sat down again at a\r\nlittle distance from him.\r\n\r\n"I remember I used to offend you," she continued, quickly and\r\nconfusedly. "No, no, not to offend--only to vex you a little--by\r\ntalking too familiarly to the servants. You might almost have fancied,\r\nat first, if you had not known me so well, that it was a habit with me\r\nbecause I had once been a servant myself. Suppose I had been a\r\nservant--the servant who had helped to nurse you in your illnesses,\r\nthe servant who led you about in your blindness more carefully than\r\nany one else--would you have thought much, then, of the difference\r\nbetween us? would you--"\r\n\r\nShe stopped. The smile had vanished from Leonard\'s face, and he had\r\nturned a little away from her. "What is the use, Rosamond, of\r\nsupposing events that never could have happened?" he asked rather\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nShe went to the side-table, poured out some of the water she had\r\nbrought from the library, and drank it eagerly; then walked to the\r\nwindow and plucked a few of the flowers that were placed there. She\r\nthrew some of them away again the next moment; but kept the rest in\r\nher hand, thoughtfully arranging them so as to contrast their colors\r\nwith the best effect. When this was done, she put them into her bosom,\r\nlooked down absently at them, took them out again, and, returning to\r\nher husband, placed the little nosegay in the button-hole of his coat.\r\n\r\n"Something to make you look gay and bright, love--as I always wish to\r\nsee you," she said, seating herself in her favorite attitude at his\r\nfeet, and looking up at him sadly, with her arms resting on his knees.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking about, Rosamond?" he asked, after an interval\r\nof silence.\r\n\r\n"I was wondering, Lenny, whether any woman in the world could be as\r\nfond of you as I am. I feel almost afraid that there are others who\r\nwould ask nothing better than to live and die for you, as well as me.\r\nThere is something in your face, in your voice, in all your\r\nways--something besides the interest of your sad, sad affliction--that\r\nwould draw any woman\'s heart to you, I think. If I were to die--"\r\n\r\n"If you were to die!" He started as he repeated the words after her,\r\nand, leaning forward, anxiously laid his hand upon her forehead. "You\r\nare thinking and talking very strangely this morning, Rosamond! Are\r\nyou not well?"\r\n\r\nShe rose on her knees and looked closer at him, her face brightening a\r\nlittle, and a faint smile just playing round her lips. "I wonder if\r\nyou will always be as anxious about me, and as fond of me, as you are\r\nnow?" she whispered, kissing his hand as she removed it from her\r\nforehead. He leaned back again in the chair, and told her jestingly\r\nnot to look too far into the future. The words, lightly as they were\r\nspoken, struck deep into her heart. "There are times, Lenny," she\r\nsaid, "when all one\'s happiness in the present depends upon one\'s\r\ncertainty of the future." She looked at the letter, which her husband\r\nhad left open on a table near him, as she spoke; and, after a\r\nmomentary struggle with herself, took it in her hand to read it. At\r\nthe first word her voice failed her; the deadly paleness overspread\r\nher face again; she threw the letter back on the table, and walked\r\naway to the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n"The future?" asked Leonard. "What future, Rosamond, can you possibly\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose I meant our future at Porthgenna?" she said, moistening her\r\ndry lips with a few drops of water. "Shall we stay here as long as we\r\nthought we should, and be as happy as we have been every where else?\r\nYou told me on the journey that I should find it dull, and that I\r\nshould be driven to try all sorts of extraordinary occupations to\r\namuse myself. You said you expected that I should begin with gardening\r\nand end by writing a novel. A novel!" She approached her husband\r\nagain, and watched his face eagerly while she went on. "Why not? More\r\nwomen write novels now than men. What is to prevent me from trying?\r\nThe first great requisite, I suppose, is to have an idea of a story;\r\nand that I have got." She advanced a few steps farther, reached the\r\ntable on which the letter lay, and placed her hand on it, keeping her\r\neyes still fixed intently on Leonard\'s face.\r\n\r\n"And what is your idea, Rosamond?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"This," she replied. "I mean to make the main interest of the story\r\ncentre in two young married people. They shall be very fond of each\r\nother--as fond as we are, Lenny--and they shall be in our rank of\r\nlife. After they have been happily married some time, and when they\r\nhave got one child to make them love each other more dearly than ever,\r\na terrible discovery shall fall upon them like a thunderbolt. The\r\nhusband shall have chosen for his wife a young lady bearing as ancient\r\na family name as--"\r\n\r\n"As your name?" suggested Leonard.\r\n\r\n"As the name of the Treverton family," she continued, after a pause,\r\nduring which her hand had been restlessly moving the letter to and fro\r\non the table. "The husband shall be well-born--as well-born as you,\r\nLenny--and the terrible discovery shall be, that his wife has no right\r\nto the ancient name that she bore when he married her."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say, my love, that I approve of your idea. Your story will\r\ndecoy the reader into feeling an interest in a woman who turns out to\r\nbe an impostor."\r\n\r\n"No!" cried Rosamond, warmly. "A true woman--a woman who never stooped\r\nto a deception--a woman full of faults and failings, but a teller of\r\nthe truth at all hazards and all sacrifices. Hear me out, Lenny,\r\nbefore you judge." Hot tears rushed into her eyes; but she dashed them\r\naway passionately, and went on. "The wife shall grow up to womanhood,\r\nand shall marry, in total ignorance--mind that!--in total ignorance of\r\nher real history. The sudden disclosure of the truth shall overwhelm\r\nher--she shall find herself struck by a calamity which she had no\r\nhand in bringing about. She shall be staggered in her very reason by\r\nthe discovery; it shall burst upon her when she has no one but herself\r\nto depend on; she shall have the power of keeping it a secret from her\r\nhusband with perfect impunity; she shall be tried, she shall be shaken\r\nin her mortal frailness, by one moment of fearful temptation; she\r\nshall conquer it, and, of her own free will, she shall tell her\r\nhusband all that she knows herself. Now, Lenny, what do you call that\r\nwoman? an impostor?"\r\n\r\n"No: a victim."\r\n\r\n"Who goes of her own accord to the sacrifice? and who is to be\r\nsacrificed?"\r\n\r\n"I never said that."\r\n\r\n"What would you do with her, Lenny, if you were writing the story? I\r\nmean, how would you make her husband behave to her? It is a question\r\nin which a man\'s nature is concerned, and a woman is not competent to\r\ndecide it. I am perplexed about how to end the story. How would you\r\nend it, love?" As she ceased, her voice sank sadly to its gentlest\r\npleading tones. She came close to him, and twined her fingers in his\r\nhair fondly. "How would you end it, love?" she repeated, stooping down\r\ntill her trembling lips just touched his forehead.\r\n\r\nHe moved uneasily in his chair, and replied--"I am not a writer of\r\nnovels, Rosamond."\r\n\r\n"But how would you act, Lenny, if you were that husband?"\r\n\r\n"It is hard for me to say," he answered. "I have not your vivid\r\nimagination, my dear. I have no power of putting myself, at a moment\'s\r\nnotice, into a position that is not my own, and of knowing how I\r\nshould act in it."\r\n\r\n"But suppose your wife was close to you--as close as I am now? Suppose\r\nshe had just told you the dreadful secret, and was standing before\r\nyou--as I am standing now--with the happiness of her whole life to\r\ncome depending on one kind word from your lips? Oh, Lenny, you would\r\nnot let her drop broken-hearted at your feet? You would know, let her\r\nbirth be what it might, that she was still the same faithful creature\r\nwho had cherished and served and trusted and worshiped you since her\r\nmarriage-day, and who asked nothing in return but to lay her head on\r\nyour bosom, and to hear you say that you loved her? You would know\r\nthat she had nerved herself to tell the fatal secret, because, in her\r\nloyalty and love to her husband, she would rather die forsaken and\r\ndespised, than live, deceiving him? You would know all this, and you\r\nwould open your arms to the mother of your child, to the wife of your\r\nfirst love, though she was the lowliest of all lowly born women in the\r\nestimation of the world? Oh, you would, Lenny, I know you would!"\r\n\r\n"Rosamond! how your hands tremble; how your voice alters! You are\r\nagitating yourself about this supposed story of yours, as if you were\r\ntalking of real events."\r\n\r\n"You would take her to your heart, Lenny? You would open your arms to\r\nher without an instant of unworthy doubt?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! I hope I should."\r\n\r\n"Hope? only hope? Oh, think again, love, think again; and say you\r\n_know_ you should!"\r\n\r\n"Must I, Rosamond? Then I do say it."\r\n\r\nShe drew back as the words passed his lips, and took the letter from\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"You have not yet asked me, Lenny, to read the letter that I found in\r\nthe Myrtle Room. I offer to read it now of my own accord."\r\n\r\nShe trembled a little as she spoke those few decisive words, but her\r\nutterance of them was clear and steady, as if her consciousness of\r\nbeing now irrevocably pledged to make the disclosure had strengthened\r\nher at last to dare all hazards and end all suspense.\r\n\r\nHer husband turned toward the place from which the sound of her voice\r\nhad reached him, with a mixed expression of perplexity and surprise in\r\nhis face. "You pass so suddenly from one subject to another," he said,\r\n"that I hardly know how to follow you. What in the world, Rosamond,\r\ntakes you, at one jump, from a romantic argument about a situation in\r\na novel, to the plain, practical business of reading an old letter?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there is a closer connection between the two than you\r\nsuspect," she answered.\r\n\r\n"A closer connection? What connection? I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"The letter will explain."\r\n\r\n"Why the letter? Why should _you_ not explain?"\r\n\r\nShe stole one anxious look at his face, and saw that a sense of\r\nsomething serious to come was now overshadowing his mind for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Rosamond!" he exclaimed, "there is some mystery--"\r\n\r\n"There are no mysteries between us two," she interposed quickly.\r\n"There never have been any, love; there never shall be." She moved a\r\nlittle nearer to him to take her old favorite place on his knee, then\r\nchecked herself, and drew back again to the table. Warning tears in\r\nher eyes bade her distrust her own firmness, and read the letter where\r\nshe could not feel the beating of his heart.\r\n\r\n"Did I tell you," she resumed, after waiting an instant to compose\r\nherself, "where I found the folded piece of paper which I put into\r\nyour hand in the Myrtle Room?"\r\n\r\n"No," he replied, "I think not."\r\n\r\n"I found it at the back of the frame of that picture--the picture of\r\nthe ghostly woman with the wicked face. I opened it immediately, and\r\nsaw that it was a letter. The address inside, the first line under it,\r\nand one of the two signatures which it contained, were in a\r\nhandwriting that I knew."\r\n\r\n"Whose!"\r\n\r\n"The handwriting of the late Mrs. Treverton."\r\n\r\n"Of your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Of the late Mrs. Treverton."\r\n\r\n"Gracious God, Rosamond! why do you speak of her in that way?"\r\n\r\n"Let me read, and you will know. You have seen, with my eyes, what the\r\nMyrtle Room is like; you have seen, with my eyes, every object which\r\nthe search through it brought to light; you must now see, with my\r\neyes, what this letter contains. It is the Secret of the Myrtle Room."\r\n\r\nShe bent close over the faint, faded writing, and read these words:\r\n\r\n     "To my Husband--\r\n\r\n     "We have parted, Arthur, forever, and I have not had the\r\n     courage to embitter our farewell by confessing that I have\r\n     deceived you--cruelly and basely deceived you. But a few\r\n     minutes since, you were weeping by my bedside and speaking\r\n     of our child. My wronged, my beloved husband, the little\r\n     daughter of your heart is not yours, is not mine. She is a\r\n     love-child, whom I have imposed on you for mine. Her father\r\n     was a miner at Porthgenna; her mother is my maid, Sarah\r\n     Leeson."\r\n\r\n     Rosamond paused, but never raised her head from the letter.\r\n     She heard her husband lay his hand suddenly on the table;\r\n     she heard him start to his feet; she heard him draw his\r\n     breath heavily in one quick gasp; she heard him whisper to\r\n     himself the instant after--"A love-child!" With a fearful,\r\n     painful distinctness she heard those three words. The tone\r\n     in which he whispered them turned her cold. But she never\r\n     moved, for there was more to read; and while more remained,\r\n     if her life had depended on it, she could not have looked\r\n     up.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more she went on, and read these lines next:\r\n\r\n     "I have many heavy sins to answer for, but this one sin you\r\n     must pardon, Arthur, for I committed it through fondness for\r\n     you. That fondness told me a secret which you sought to hide\r\n     from me. That fondness told me that your barren wife would\r\n     never make your heart all her own until she had borne you a\r\n     child; and your lips proved it true. Your first words, when\r\n     you came back from sea, and when the infant was placed in\r\n     your arms, were--\'I have never loved you, Rosamond, as I\r\n     love you now.\' If you had not said that, I should never\r\n     have kept my guilty secret.\r\n\r\n     "I can add no more, for death is very near me. How the fraud\r\n     was committed, and what my other motives were, I must leave\r\n     you to discover from the mother of the child, who writes\r\n     this under my dictation, and who is charged to give it to\r\n     you when I am no more. You will be merciful to the poor\r\n     little creature who bears my name. Be merciful also to her\r\n     unhappy parent: she is only guilty of too blindly obeying\r\n     me. If there is any thing that mitigates the bitterness of\r\n     my remorse, it is the remembrance that my act of deceit\r\n     saved the most faithful and the most affectionate of women\r\n     from shame that she had not deserved. Remember me\r\n     forgivingly, Arthur--words may tell how I have sinned\r\n     against you; no words can tell how I have loved you!"\r\n\r\nShe had struggled on thus far, and had reached the last line on the\r\nsecond page of the letter, when she paused again, and then tried to\r\nread the first of the two signatures--"Rosamond Treverton." She\r\nfaintly repeated two syllables of that familiar Christian name--the\r\nname that was on her husband\'s lips every hour of the day!--and strove\r\nto articulate the third, but her voice failed her. All the sacred\r\nhousehold memories which that ruthless letter had profaned forever\r\nseemed to tear themselves away from her heart at the same moment. With\r\na low, moaning cry she dropped her arms on the table, and laid her\r\nhead down on them, and hid her face.\r\n\r\nShe heard nothing, she was conscious of nothing, until she felt a\r\ntouch on her shoulder--a light touch from a hand that trembled. Every\r\npulse in her body bounded in answer to it, and she looked up.\r\n\r\nHer husband had guided himself near to her by the table. The tears\r\nwere glistening in his dim, sightless eyes. As she rose and touched\r\nhim, his arms opened, and closed fast around her.\r\n\r\n"My own Rosamond!" he said, "come to me and be comforted!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nUNCLE JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day and the night had passed, and the new morning had come, before\r\nthe husband and wife could trust themselves to speak calmly of the\r\nSecret, and to face resignedly the duties and the sacrifices which the\r\ndiscovery of it imposed on them.\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s first question referred to those lines in the letter which\r\nRosamond had informed him were in a handwriting that she knew. Finding\r\nthat he was at a loss to understand what means she could have of\r\nforming an opinion on this point, she explained that, after Captain\r\nTreverton\'s death, many letters had naturally fallen into her\r\npossession which had been written by Mrs. Treverton to her husband.\r\nThey treated of ordinary domestic subjects, and she had read them\r\noften enough to become thoroughly acquainted with the peculiarities of\r\nMrs. Treverton\'s handwriting. It was remarkably large, firm, and\r\nmasculine in character; and the address, the line under it, and the\r\nuppermost of the two signatures in the letter which had been found in\r\nthe Myrtle Room, exactly resembled it in every particular.\r\n\r\nThe next question related to the body of the letter. The writing of\r\nthis, of the second signature ("Sarah Leeson"), and of the additional\r\nlines on the third page, also signed by Sarah Leeson, proclaimed\r\nitself in each case to be the production of the same person. While\r\nstating that fact to her husband, Rosamond did not forget to explain\r\nto him that, while reading the letter on the previous day, her\r\nstrength and courage had failed her before she got to the end of it.\r\nShe added that the postscript which she had thus omitted to read was\r\nof importance, because it mentioned the circumstances under which the\r\nSecret had been hidden; and begged that he would listen while she made\r\nhim acquainted with its contents without any further delay.\r\n\r\nSitting as close to his side, now, as if they were enjoying their\r\nfirst honey-moon days over again, she read these last lines--the lines\r\nwhich her mother had written sixteen years before, on the morning when\r\nshe fled from Porthgenna Tower:\r\n\r\n     "If this paper should ever be found (which I pray with my\r\n     whole heart it never may be), I wish to say that I have\r\n     come to the resolution of hiding it, because I dare not\r\n     show the writing that it contains to my master, to whom it\r\n     is addressed. In doing what I now propose to do, though I\r\n     am acting against my mistress\'s last wishes, I am not\r\n     breaking the solemn engagement which she obliged me to make\r\n     before her on her death-bed. That engagement forbids me to\r\n     destroy this letter, or to take it away with me if I leave\r\n     the house. I shall do neither--my purpose is to conceal it\r\n     in the place, of all others, where I think there is least\r\n     chance of its ever being found again. Any hardship or\r\n     misfortune which may follow as a consequence of this\r\n     deceitful proceeding on my part, will fall on myself.\r\n     Others, I believe, in my conscience, will be the happier\r\n     for the hiding of the dreadful Secret which this letter\r\n     contains."\r\n\r\n"There can be no doubt, now," said Leonard, when his wife had read to\r\nthe end; "Mrs. Jazeph, Sarah Leeson, and the servant who disappeared\r\nfrom Porthgenna Tower, are one and the same person."\r\n\r\n"Poor creature!" said Rosamond, sighing as she put down the letter.\r\n"We know now why she warned me so anxiously not to go into the Myrtle\r\nRoom. Who can say what she must have suffered when she came as a\r\nstranger to my bedside? Oh, what would I not give if I had been less\r\nhasty with her! It is dreadful to remember that I spoke to her as a\r\nservant whom I expected to obey me; it is worse still to feel that I\r\ncan not, even now, think of her as a child should think of a mother.\r\nHow can I ever tell her that I know the Secret? how--" She paused,\r\nwith a heart-sick consciousness of the slur that was cast on her\r\nbirth; she paused, shrinking as she thought of the name that her\r\nhusband had given to her, and of her own parentage, which the laws of\r\nsociety disdained to recognize.\r\n\r\n"Why do you stop?" asked Leonard.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid--" she began, and paused again.\r\n\r\n"Afraid," he said, finishing the sentence for her, "that words of pity\r\nfor that unhappy woman might wound my sensitive pride by reminding me\r\nof the circumstances of your birth? Rosamond! I should be unworthy of\r\nyour matchless truthfulness toward me, if I, on my side, did not\r\nacknowledge that this discovery _has_ wounded me as only a proud man\r\ncan be wounded. My pride has been born and bred in me. My pride, even\r\nwhile I am now speaking to you, takes advantage of my first moments of\r\ncomposure, and deludes me into doubting, in face of all probability,\r\nwhether the words you have read to me can, after all, be words of\r\ntruth. But, strong as that inborn and inbred feeling is--hard as it\r\nmay be for me to discipline and master it as I ought, and must and\r\nwill--there is another feeling in my heart that is stronger yet." He\r\nfelt for her hand, and took it in his; then added--"From the hour when\r\nyou first devoted your life to your blind husband--from the hour when\r\nyou won all his gratitude, as you had already won all his love, you\r\ntook a place in his heart, Rosamond, from which nothing, not even such\r\na shock as has now assailed us, can move you! High as I have always\r\nheld the worth of rank in my estimation, I have learned, even before\r\nthe event of yesterday, to hold the worth of my wife, let her\r\nparentage be what it may, higher still."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lenny, Lenny, I can\'t hear you praise me, if you talk in the same\r\nbreath as if I had made a sacrifice in marrying you! But for my blind\r\nhusband I might never have deserved what you have just said of me.\r\nWhen I first read that fearful letter, I had one moment of vile,\r\nungrateful doubt if your love for me would hold out against the\r\ndiscovery of the Secret. I had one moment of horrible temptation, that\r\ndrew me away from you when I ought to have put the letter into your\r\nhand. It was the sight of you, waiting for me to speak again, so\r\ninnocent of all knowledge of what happened close by you, that brought\r\nme back to my senses, and told me what I ought to do. It was the sight\r\nof my blind husband that made me conquer the temptation to destroy\r\nthat letter in the first hour of discovering it. Oh, if I had been the\r\nhardest-hearted of women, could I have ever taken your hand\r\nagain--could I kiss you, could I lie down by your side, and hear you\r\nfall asleep, night after night, feeling that I had abused your blind\r\ndependence on me to serve my own selfish interests? knowing that I had\r\nonly succeeded in my deceit because your affliction made you incapable\r\nof suspecting deception? No, no; I can hardly believe that the basest\r\nof women could be guilty of such baseness as that; and I can claim\r\nnothing more for myself than the credit of having been true to my\r\ntrust. You said yesterday, love, in the Myrtle Room, that the one\r\nfaithful friend to you in your blindness, who never failed, was your\r\nwife. It is reward enough and consolation enough for me, now that the\r\nworst is over, to know that you can say so still."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Rosamond, the worst is over; but we must not forget that there\r\nmay be hard trials still to meet."\r\n\r\n"Hard trials, love? To what trials do you refer?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, Rosamond, I overrate the courage that the sacrifice demands;\r\nbut, to _me_ at least, it will be a hard sacrifice of my own feelings\r\nto make strangers partakers in the knowledge that we now possess."\r\n\r\nRosamond looked at her husband in astonishment. "Why need we tell the\r\nSecret to any one?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Assuming that we can satisfy ourselves of the genuineness of that\r\nletter," he answered, "we shall have no choice but to tell it to\r\nstrangers. You can not forget the circumstances under which your\r\nfather--under which Captain Treverton--"\r\n\r\n"Call him my father," said Rosamond, sadly. "Remember how he loved me,\r\nand how I loved him, and say \'my father\' still."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I must say \'Captain Treverton\' now," returned Leonard,\r\n"or I shall hardly be able to explain simply and plainly what it is\r\nvery necessary that you should know. Captain Treverton died without\r\nleaving a will. His only property was the purchase-money of this house\r\nand estate; and you inherited it, as his next of kin--"\r\n\r\nRosamond started back in her chair and clasped her hands in dismay.\r\n"Oh, Lenny," she said simply, "I have thought so much of you, since I\r\nfound the letter, that I never remembered this!"\r\n\r\n"It is time to remember it, my love. If you are not Captain\r\nTreverton\'s daughter, you have no right to one farthing of the\r\nfortune that you possess; and it must be restored at once to the\r\nperson who _is_ Captain Treverton\'s next of kin--or, in other words,\r\nto his brother."\r\n\r\n"To that man!" exclaimed Rosamond. "To that man who is a stranger to\r\nus, who holds our very name in contempt! Are we to be made poor that\r\nhe may be made rich?--"\r\n\r\n"We are to do what is honorable and just, at any sacrifice of our own\r\ninterests and ourselves," said Leonard, firmly. "I believe, Rosamond,\r\nthat my consent, as your husband, is necessary, according to the law,\r\nto effect this restitution. If Mr. Andrew Treverton was the bitterest\r\nenemy I had on earth, and if the restoring of this money utterly\r\nruined us both in our worldly circumstances, I would give it back of\r\nmy own accord to the last farthing--and so would you!"\r\n\r\nThe blood mantled in his cheeks as he spoke. Rosamond looked at him\r\nadmiringly in silence. "Who would have him less proud," she thought,\r\nfondly, "when his pride speaks in such words as those!"\r\n\r\n"You understand now," continued Leonard, "that we have duties to\r\nperform which will oblige us to seek help from others, and which will\r\ntherefore render it impossible to keep the Secret to ourselves? If we\r\nsearch all England for her, Sarah Leeson must be found. Our future\r\nactions depend upon her answers to our inquiries, upon her testimony\r\nto the genuineness of that letter. Although I am resolved beforehand\r\nto shield myself behind no technical quibbles and delays--although I\r\nwant nothing but evidence that is morally conclusive, however legally\r\nimperfect it may be--it is still impossible to proceed without seeking\r\nadvice immediately. The lawyer who always managed Captain Treverton\'s\r\naffairs, and who now manages ours, is the proper person to direct us\r\nin instituting a search, and to assist us, if necessary, in making the\r\nrestitution."\r\n\r\n"How quietly and firmly you speak of it, Lenny! Will not the\r\nabandoning of my fortune be a dreadful loss to us?"\r\n\r\n"We must think of it as a gain to our consciences, Rosamond, and must\r\nalter our way of life resignedly to suit our altered means. But we\r\nneed speak no more of that until we are assured of the necessity of\r\nrestoring the money. My immediate anxiety, and your immediate anxiety,\r\nmust turn now on the discovery of Sarah Leeson--no! on the discovery\r\nof your mother; I must learn to call her by that name, or I shall not\r\nlearn to pity and forgive her."\r\n\r\nRosamond nestled closer to her husband\'s side. "Every word you say,\r\nlove, does my heart good," she whispered, laying her head on his\r\nshoulder. "You will help me and strengthen me, when the time comes, to\r\nmeet my mother as I ought? Oh, how pale and worn and weary she was\r\nwhen she stood by my bedside, and looked at me and my child! Will it\r\nbe long before we find her? Is she far away from us, I wonder? or\r\nnearer, much nearer than we think?"\r\n\r\nBefore Leonard could answer, he was interrupted by a knock at the\r\ndoor, and Rosamond was surprised by the appearance of the\r\nmaid-servant. Betsey was flushed, excited, and out of breath; but she\r\ncontrived to deliver intelligibly a brief message from Mr. Munder, the\r\nsteward, requesting permission to speak to Mr. Frankland, or to Mrs.\r\nFrankland, on business of importance.\r\n\r\n"What is it? What does he want?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I think, ma\'am, he wants to know whether he had better send for the\r\nconstable or not," answered Betsey.\r\n\r\n"Send for the constable!" repeated Rosamond. "Are there thieves in the\r\nhouse in broad daylight?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Munder says he don\'t know but what it may be worse than thieves,"\r\nreplied Betsey. "It\'s the foreigner again, if you please, ma\'am. He\r\ncome up and rung at the door as bold as brass, and asked if he could\r\nsee Mrs. Frankland."\r\n\r\n"The foreigner!" exclaimed Rosamond, laying her hand eagerly on her\r\nhusband\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said Betsey. "Him as come here to go over the house\r\nalong with the lady--"\r\n\r\nRosamond, with characteristic impulsiveness, started to her feet. "Let\r\nme go down!" she began.\r\n\r\n"Wait," interposed Leonard, catching her by the hand. "There is not\r\nthe least need for you to go down stairs.--Show the foreigner up\r\nhere," he continued, addressing himself to Betsey, "and tell Mr.\r\nMunder that we will take the management of this business into our own\r\nhands."\r\n\r\nRosamond sat down again by her husband\'s side. "This is a very strange\r\naccident," she said, in a low, serious tone. "It must be something\r\nmore than mere chance that puts the clew into our hands, at the moment\r\nwhen we least expected to find it."\r\n\r\nThe door opened for the second time, and there appeared, modestly, on\r\nthe threshold, a little old man, with rosy cheeks and long white hair.\r\nA small leather case was slung by a strap at his side, and the stem of\r\na pipe peeped out of the breast pocket of his coat. He advanced one\r\nstep into the room, stopped, raised both his hands, with his felt hat\r\ncrumpled up in them, to his heart, and made five fantastic bows in\r\nquick succession--two to Mrs. Frankland, two to her husband, and one\r\nto Mrs. Frankland again, as an act of separate and special homage to\r\nthe lady. Never had Rosamond seen a more complete embodiment in human\r\nform of perfect innocence and perfect harmlessness than the foreigner\r\nwho was described in the housekeeper\'s letter as an audacious\r\nvagabond, and who was dreaded by Mr. Munder as something worse than a\r\nthief!\r\n\r\n"Madam and good Sir," said the old man, advancing a little nearer at\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s invitation, "I ask your pardon for intruding myself.\r\nMy name is Joseph Buschmann. I live in the town of Truro, where I work\r\nin cabinets and tea-caddies, and other shining woods. I am also, if\r\nyou please, the same little foreign man who was scolded by the big\r\nmajor-domo when I came to see the house. All that I ask of your\r\nkindness is, that you will let me say for my errand here and for\r\nmyself, and for another person who is very near to my love--one little\r\nword. I will be but few minutes, Madam and good Sir, and then I will\r\ngo my ways again, with my best wishes and my best thanks."\r\n\r\n"Pray consider, Mr. Buschmann, that our time is your time," said\r\nLeonard. "We have no engagement whatever which need oblige you to\r\nshorten your visit. I must tell you beforehand, in order to prevent\r\nany embarrassment on either side, that I have the misfortune to be\r\nblind. I can promise you, however, my best attention as far as\r\nlistening goes. Rosamond, is Mr. Buschmann seated?"\r\n\r\nMr. Buschmann was still standing near the door, and was expressing\r\nsympathy by bowing to Mr. Frankland again, and crumpling his felt hat\r\nonce more over his heart.\r\n\r\n"Pray come nearer, and sit down," said Rosamond. "And don\'t imagine\r\nfor one moment that any opinion of the steward\'s has the least\r\ninfluence on us, or that we feel it at all necessary for you to\r\napologize for what took place the last time you came to this house. We\r\nhave an interest--a very great interest," she added, with her usual\r\nhearty frankness, "in hearing any thing that you have to tell us. You\r\nare the person of all others whom we are, just at this time--" She\r\nstopped, feeling her foot touched by her husband\'s, and rightly\r\ninterpreting the action as a warning not to speak too unrestrainedly\r\nto the visitor before he had explained his object in coming to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nLooking very much pleased, and a little surprised also, when he heard\r\nRosamond\'s last words, Uncle Joseph drew a chair near to the table by\r\nwhich Mr. and Mrs. Frankland were sitting, crumpled his felt hat up\r\nsmaller than ever, and put it in one of his side pockets, drew from\r\nthe other a little packet of letters, placed them on his knees as he\r\nsat down, patted them gently with both hands, and entered on his\r\nexplanation in these terms:\r\n\r\n"Madam and good Sir," he began, "before I can say comfortably my\r\nlittle word, I must, with your leave, travel backward to the last time\r\nwhen I came to this house in company with my niece."\r\n\r\n"Your niece!" exclaimed Rosamond and Leonard, both speaking together.\r\n\r\n"My niece, Sarah," said Uncle Joseph, "the only child of my sister\r\nAgatha. It is for the love of Sarah, if you please, that I am here\r\nnow. She is the one last morsel of my flesh and blood that is left to\r\nme in the world. The rest, they are all gone! My wife, my little\r\nJoseph, my brother Max, my sister Agatha and the husband she married,\r\nthe good and noble Englishman, Leeson--they are all, all gone!"\r\n\r\n"Leeson," said Rosamond, pressing her husband\'s hand significantly\r\nunder the table. "Your niece\'s name is Sarah Leeson?"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph sighed and shook his head. "One day," he said, "of all\r\nthe days in the year the evilmost for Sarah, she changed that name. Of\r\nthe man she married--who is dead now, Madam--it is little or nothing\r\nthat I know but this: His name was Jazeph, and he used her ill, for\r\nwhich I think him the First Scoundrel! Yes," exclaimed Uncle Joseph,\r\nwith the nearest approach to anger and bitterness which his nature was\r\ncapable of making, and with an idea that he was using one of the\r\nstrongest superlatives in the language--"Yes! if he was to come to\r\nlife again at this very moment of time, I would say it of him to his\r\nface--Englishman Jazeph, you are the First Scoundrel!"\r\n\r\nRosamond pressed her husband\'s hand for the second time. If their own\r\nconvictions had not already identified Mrs. Jazeph with Sarah Leeson,\r\nthe old man\'s last words must have amply sufficed to assure them that\r\nboth names had been borne by the same person.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I shall now travel backward to the time when I was here\r\nwith Sarah, my niece," resumed Uncle Joseph. "I must, if you please,\r\nspeak the truth in this business, or, now that I am already backward\r\nwhere I want to be, I shall stick fast in my place, and get on no more\r\nfor the rest of my life. Sir and good Madam, will you have the great\r\nkindness to forgive me and Sarah, my niece, if I confess that it was\r\nnot to see the house that we came here and rang at the bell, and gave\r\ndeal of trouble, and wasted much breath of the big major-domo\'s with\r\nthe scolding that we got. It was only to do one curious little thing\r\nthat we came together to this place--or, no, it was all about a secret\r\nof Sarah\'s, which is still as black and dark to me as the middle of\r\nthe blackest and darkest night that ever was in the world--and as I\r\nnothing knew about it, except that there was no harm in it to any body\r\nor any thing, and that Sarah was determined to go, and that I could\r\nnot let her go by herself; as also for the good reason that she told\r\nme she had the best right of any body to take the letter and to hide\r\nit again, seeing that she was afraid of its being found if longer in\r\nthat room she left it, which was the room where she had hidden it\r\nbefore--why, so it happened that I--no, that she--no, no, that I--Ach\r\nGott!" cried Uncle Joseph, striking his forehead in despair, and\r\nrelieving himself by an invocation in his own language. "I am lost in\r\nmy own muddlement; and whereabouts the right place is, and how I am to\r\nget myself back into it, as I am a living sinner, is more than I\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\n"There is not the least need to go back on our account," said\r\nRosamond, forgetting all caution and self-restraint in her anxiety to\r\nrestore the old man\'s confidence and composure. "Pray don\'t try to\r\nrepeat your explanations. We know already--"\r\n\r\n"We will suppose," said Leonard, interposing abruptly before his wife\r\ncould add another word, "that we know already every thing you can\r\ndesire to tell us in relation to your niece\'s secret, and to your\r\nmotives for desiring to see the house."\r\n\r\n"You will suppose that!" exclaimed Uncle Joseph, looking greatly\r\nrelieved. "Ah! thank you, Sir, and you, good Madam, a thousand times\r\nfor helping me out of my own muddlement with a \'Suppose.\' I am all\r\nover confusion from my tops to my toes; but I can go on now, I think,\r\nand lose myself no more. So! Let us say it in this way: I and Sarah,\r\nmy niece, are _in_ the house--that is the first \'Suppose.\' I and\r\nSarah, my niece, are _out_ of the house--that is the second \'Suppose.\'\r\nGood! now we go on once more. On my way back to my own home at Truro,\r\nI am frightened for Sarah, because of the faint she fell into on your\r\nstairs here, and because of a look in her face that it makes me heavy\r\nat my heart to see. Also, I am sorry for her sake, because she has not\r\ndone that one curious little thing which she came into the house to\r\ndo. I fret about these same matters, but I console myself too; and my\r\ncomfort is that Sarah will stop with me in my house at Truro, and that\r\nI shall make her happy and well again, as soon as we are settled in\r\nour life together. Judge, then, Sir, what a blow falls on me when I\r\nhear that she will not make her home where I make mine. Judge you,\r\nalso, good Madam, what my surprise must be, when I ask for her reason,\r\nand she tells me she must leave Uncle Joseph, because she is afraid of\r\nbeing found out by _you_." He stopped, and looking anxiously at\r\nRosamond\'s face, saw it sadden and turn away from him after he had\r\nspoken his last words. "Are you sorry, Madam, for Sarah, my niece? do\r\nyou pity her?" he asked, with a little hesitation and trembling in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"I pity her with my whole heart," said Rosamond, warmly.\r\n\r\n"And with my whole heart, for that pity I thank you!" rejoined Uncle\r\nJoseph. "Ah, Madam, your kindness gives me the courage to go on, and\r\nto tell you that we parted from each other on the day of our getting\r\nback to Truro! When she came to see me this time, it was years and\r\nyears, long and lonely and very many, since we two had met. I was\r\nafraid that many more would pass again, and I tried to make her stop\r\nwith me to the very last. But she had still the same fear to drive her\r\naway--the fear of being found and put to the question by you. So, with\r\nthe tears in her eyes (and in mine), and the grief at her heart (and\r\nat mine), she went away to hide herself in the empty bigness of the\r\ngreat city, London, which swallows up all people and all things that\r\npour into it, and which has now swallowed up Sarah, my niece, with the\r\nrest. \'My child, you will write sometimes to Uncle Joseph,\' I said,\r\nand she answered me,\'I will write often.\' It is three weeks now since\r\nthat time, and here, on my knee, are four letters she has written to\r\nme. I shall ask your leave to put them down open before you, because\r\nthey will help me to get on further yet with what I must say, and\r\nbecause I see in your face, Madam, that you are indeed sorry for\r\nSarah, my niece, from your heart."\r\n\r\nHe untied the packet of letters, opened them, kissed them one by one,\r\nand put them down in a row on the table, smoothing them out carefully\r\nwith his hand, and taking great pains to arrange them all in a\r\nperfectly straight line. A glance at the first of the little series\r\nshowed Rosamond that the handwriting in it was the same as the\r\nhandwriting in the body of the letter which had been found in the\r\nMyrtle Room.\r\n\r\n"There is not much to read," said Uncle Joseph. "But if you will look\r\nthrough them first, Madam, I can tell you after all the reason for\r\nshowing them that I have."\r\n\r\nThe old man was right. There was very little to read in the letters,\r\nand they grew progressively shorter as they became more recent in\r\ndate. All four were written in the formal, conventionally correct\r\nstyle of a person taking up the pen with a fear of making mistakes in\r\nspelling and grammar, and were equally destitute of any personal\r\nparticulars relative to the writer; all four anxiously entreated that\r\nUncle Joseph would not be uneasy, inquired after his health, and\r\nexpressed gratitude and love for him as warmly as their timid\r\nrestraints of style would permit; all four contained these two\r\nquestions relating to Rosamond--First, had Mrs. Frankland arrived yet\r\nat Porthgenna Tower? Second, if she had arrived, what had Uncle Joseph\r\nheard about her? And, finally, all four gave the same instructions for\r\naddressing an answer--"Please direct to me, \'S. J., Post-office,\r\nSmith Street, London\'"--followed by the same apology, "Excuse my not\r\ngiving my address, in case of accidents; for even in London I am still\r\nafraid of being followed and found out. I send every morning for\r\nletters; so I am sure to get your answer."\r\n\r\n"I told you, Madam," said the old man, when Rosamond raised her head\r\nfrom the letters, "that I was frightened and sorry for Sarah when she\r\nleft me. Now see, if you please, why I got more frightened and more\r\nsorry yet, when I have all the four letters that she writes to me.\r\nThey begin here, with the first, at my left hand; and they grow\r\nshorter, and shorter, and shorter, as they get nearer to my right,\r\ntill the last is but eight little lines. Again, see, if you please.\r\nThe writing of the first letter, here, at my left hand, is very\r\nfine--I mean it is very fine to me, because I love Sarah, and because\r\nI write very badly myself; but it is not so good in the second\r\nletter--it shakes a little, it blots a little, it crooks itself a\r\nlittle in the last lines. In the third it is worse--more shake, more\r\nblot, more crook. In the fourth, where there is least to do, there is\r\nstill more shake, still more blot, still more crook, than in all the\r\nother three put together. I see this; I remember that she was weak and\r\nworn and weary when she left me, and I say to myself, \'She is ill,\r\nthough she will not tell it, for the writing betrays her!\'"\r\n\r\nRosamond looked down again at the letters, and followed the\r\nsignificant changes for the worse in the handwriting, line by line, as\r\nthe old man pointed them out.\r\n\r\n"I say to myself that," he continued; "I wait, and think a little; and\r\nI hear my own heart whisper to me, \'Go you, Uncle Joseph, to London,\r\nand, while there is yet time, bring her back to be cured and comforted\r\nand made happy in your own home!\' After that I wait, and think a\r\nlittle again--not about leaving my business; I would leave it forever\r\nsooner than Sarah should come to harm--but about what I am to do to\r\nget her to come back. That thought makes me look at the letters again;\r\nthe letters show me always the same questions about Mistress\r\nFrankland; I see it plainly as my own hand before me that I shall\r\nnever get Sarah, my niece, back, unless I can make easy her mind about\r\nthose questions of Mistress Frankland\'s that she dreads as if there\r\nwas death to her in every one of them. I see it! it makes my pipe go\r\nout; it drives me up from my chair; it puts my hat on my head; it\r\nbrings me here, where I have once intruded myself already, and where I\r\nhave no right, I know, to intrude myself again; it makes me beg and\r\npray now, of your compassion for my niece and of your goodness for me,\r\nthat you will not deny me the means of bringing Sarah back. If I may\r\nonly say to her, I have seen Mistress Frankland, and she has told me\r\nwith her own lips that she will ask none of those questions that you\r\nfear so much--if I may only say that, Sarah will come back with me,\r\nand I shall thank you every day of my life for making me a happy man!"\r\n\r\nThe simple eloquence of his words, the innocent earnestness of his\r\nmanner, touched Rosamond to the heart. "I will do any thing, I will\r\npromise any thing," she answered eagerly, "to help you to bring her\r\nback! If she will only let me see her, I promise not to say one word\r\nthat she would not wish me to say; I promise not to ask one\r\nquestion--no, not one--that it will pain her to answer. Oh, what\r\ncomforting message can I send besides? what can I say--?" She stopped\r\nconfusedly, feeling her husband\'s foot touching hers again.\r\n\r\n"Ah, say no more! say no more!" cried Uncle Joseph, tying up his\r\nlittle packet of letters, with his eyes sparkling and his ruddy face\r\nall in a glow. "Enough said to bring Sarah back! enough said to make\r\nme grateful for all my life! Oh, I am so happy, so happy, so happy--my\r\nskin is too small to hold me!" He tossed up the packet of letters into\r\nthe air, caught it, kissed it, and put it back again in his pocket,\r\nall in an instant.\r\n\r\n"You are not going?" said Rosamond. "Surely you are not going yet?"\r\n\r\n"It is my loss to go away from here, which I must put up with, because\r\nit is also my gain to get sooner to Sarah," replied Uncle Joseph. "For\r\nthat reason only, I shall ask your pardon if I take my leave with my\r\nheart full of thanks, and go my ways home again."\r\n\r\n"When do you propose to start for London, Mr. Buschmann?" inquired\r\nLeonard.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, in the morning early, Sir," replied Uncle Joseph. "I shall\r\nfinish the work that I must do to-night, and shall leave the rest to\r\nSamuel (who is my very good friend, and my shopman too), and shall\r\nthen go to Sarah by the first coach."\r\n\r\n"May I ask for your niece\'s address in London, in case we wish to\r\nwrite to you?"\r\n\r\n"She gives me no address, Sir, but the post-office; for even at the\r\ngreat distance of London, the same fear that she had all the way from\r\nthis house still sticks to her. But here is the place where I shall\r\nget my own bed," continued the old man, producing a small shop card.\r\n"It is the house of a countryman of my own, a fine baker of buns, Sir,\r\nand a very good man indeed."\r\n\r\n"Have you thought of any plan for finding out your niece\'s address?"\r\ninquired Rosamond, copying the direction on the card while she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--for I am always quick at making my plans," said Uncle\r\nJoseph. "I shall present myself to the master of the post, and to him\r\nI shall say just this and no more--\'Good-morning, Sir. I am the man\r\nwho writes the letters to S. J. She is my niece, if you please; and\r\nall that I want to know is--Where does she live?\' There is something\r\nlike a plan, I think? Aha!" He spread out both his hands\r\ninterrogatively, and looked at Mrs. Frankland with a self-satisfied\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Rosamond, partly amused, partly touched by his\r\nsimplicity, "that the people at the post-office are not at all likely\r\nto be trusted with the address. I think you would do better to take a\r\nletter with you, directed to \'S. J.;\' to deliver it in the morning\r\nwhen letters are received from the country; to wait near the door, and\r\nthen to follow the person who is sent by your niece (as she tells you\r\nherself) to ask for letters for S. J."\r\n\r\n"You think that is better?" said Uncle Joseph, secretly convinced that\r\nhis own idea was unquestionably the most ingenious of the two. "Good!\r\nThe least little word that you say to me, Madam, is a command that I\r\nfollow with all my heart." He took the crumpled felt hat out of his\r\npocket, and advanced to say farewell, when Mr. Frankland spoke to him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"If you find your niece well, and willing to travel," said Leonard,\r\n"you will bring her back to Truro at once? And you will let us know\r\nwhen you are both at home again?"\r\n\r\n"At once, Sir," said Uncle Joseph. "To both these questions, I say, At\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"If a week from this time passes," continued Leonard, "and we hear\r\nnothing from you, we must conclude, then, either that some unforeseen\r\nobstacle stands in the way of your return, or that your fears on your\r\nniece\'s account have been but too well-founded, and that she is not\r\nable to travel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir; so let it be. But I hope you will hear from me before the\r\nweek is out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so do I! most earnestly, most anxiously!" said Rosamond. "You\r\nremember my message?"\r\n\r\n"I have got it here, every word of it," said Uncle Joseph, touching\r\nhis heart. He raised the hand which Rosamond held out to him to his\r\nlips. "I shall try to thank you better when I have come back," he\r\nsaid. "For all your kindness to me and to my niece, God bless you\r\nboth, and keep you happy, till we meet again." With these words, he\r\nhastened to the door, waved his hand gayly, with the old crumpled hat\r\nin it, and went out.\r\n\r\n"Dear, simple, warm-hearted old man!" said Rosamond, as the door\r\nclosed. "I wanted to tell him every thing, Lenny. Why did you stop\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"My love, it is that very simplicity which you admire, and which I\r\nadmire, too, that makes me cautious. At the first sound of his voice I\r\nfelt as warmly toward him as you do; but the more I heard him talk the\r\nmore convinced I became that it would be rash to trust him, at first,\r\nfor fear of his disclosing too abruptly to your mother that we know\r\nher secret. Our chance of winning her confidence and obtaining an\r\ninterview with her depends, I can see, upon our own tact in dealing\r\nwith her exaggerated suspicions and her nervous fears. That good old\r\nman, with the best and kindest intentions in the world, might ruin\r\nevery thing. He will have done all that we can hope for, and all that\r\nwe can wish, if he only succeeds in bringing her back to Truro."\r\n\r\n"But if he fails?--if any thing happens?--if she is really ill?"\r\n\r\n"Let us wait till the week is over, Rosamond. It will be time enough\r\nthen to decide what we shall do next."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWAITING AND HOPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week of expectation passed, and no tidings from Uncle Joseph\r\nreached Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day Mr. Frankland sent a messenger to Truro, with orders\r\nto find out the cabinet-maker\'s shop kept by Mr. Buschmann, and to\r\ninquire of the person left in charge there whether he had received any\r\nnews from his master. The messenger returned in the afternoon, and\r\nbrought word that Mr. Buschmann had written one short note to his\r\nshopman since his departure, announcing that he had arrived safely\r\ntoward nightfall in London; that he had met with a hospitable welcome\r\nfrom his countryman, the German baker; and that he had discovered his\r\nniece\'s address, but had been prevented from seeing her by an obstacle\r\nwhich he hoped would be removed at his next visit. Since the delivery\r\nof that note, no further communication had been received from him, and\r\nnothing therefore was known of the period at which he might be\r\nexpected to return.\r\n\r\nThe one fragment of intelligence thus obtained was not of a nature to\r\nrelieve the depression of spirits which the doubt and suspense of the\r\npast week had produced in Mrs. Frankland. Her husband endeavored to\r\ncombat the oppression of mind from which she was suffering, by\r\nreminding her that the ominous silence of Uncle Joseph might be just\r\nas probably occasioned by his niece\'s unwillingness as by her\r\ninability to return with him to Truro. Remembering the obstacle at\r\nwhich the old man\'s letter hinted, and taking also into consideration\r\nher excessive sensitiveness and her unreasoning timidity, he declared\r\nit to be quite possible that Mrs. Frankland\'s message, instead of\r\nre-assuring her, might only inspire her with fresh apprehensions, and\r\nmight consequently strengthen her resolution to keep herself out of\r\nreach of all communications from Porthgenna Tower.\r\n\r\nRosamond listened patiently while this view of the case was placed\r\nbefore her, and acknowledged that the reasonableness of it was beyond\r\ndispute; but her readiness in admitting that her husband might be\r\nright and that she might be wrong was accompanied by no change for the\r\nbetter in the condition of her spirits. The interpretation which, the\r\nold man had placed upon the alteration for the worse in Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nhandwriting had produced a vivid impression on her mind, which had\r\nbeen strengthened by her own recollection of her mother\'s pale, worn\r\nface when they met as strangers at West Winston. Reason, therefore, as\r\nconvincingly as he might, Mr. Frankland was unable to shake his wife\'s\r\nconviction that the obstacle mentioned in Uncle Joseph\'s letter, and\r\nthe silence which he had maintained since, were referable alike to the\r\nillness of his niece.\r\n\r\nThe return of the messenger from Truro suggested, besides this topic\r\nof discussion, another question of much greater importance. After\r\nhaving waited one day beyond the week that had been appointed, what\r\nwas the proper course of action for Mr. and Mrs. Frankland now to\r\nadopt, in the absence of any information from London or from Truro to\r\ndecide their future proceedings?\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s first idea was to write immediately to Uncle Joseph, at the\r\naddress which he had given on the occasion of his visit to Porthgenna\r\nTower. When this project was communicated to Rosamond, she opposed it,\r\non the ground that the necessary delay before the answer to the letter\r\ncould arrive would involve a serious waste of time, when it might, for\r\naught they knew to the contrary, be of the last importance to them not\r\nto risk the loss of a single day. If illness prevented Mrs. Jazeph\r\nfrom traveling, it would be necessary to see her at once, because that\r\nillness might increase. If she were only suspicious of their motives,\r\nit was equally important to open personal communications with her\r\nbefore she could find an opportunity of raising some fresh obstacle,\r\nand of concealing herself again in some place of refuge which Uncle\r\nJoseph himself might not be able to trace.\r\n\r\nThe truth of these conclusions was obvious, but Leonard hesitated to\r\nadopt them, because they involved the necessity of a journey to\r\nLondon. If he went there without his wife, his blindness placed him at\r\nthe mercy of strangers and servants, in conducting investigations of\r\nthe most delicate and most private nature. If Rosamond accompanied\r\nhim, it would be necessary to risk all kinds of delays and\r\ninconveniences by taking the child with them on a long and wearisome\r\njourney of more than two hundred and fifty miles.\r\n\r\nRosamond met both these difficulties with her usual directness and\r\ndecision. The idea of her husband traveling any where, under any\r\ncircumstances, in his helpless, dependent state, without having her to\r\nattend on him, she dismissed at once as too preposterous for\r\nconsideration. The second objection, of subjecting the child to the\r\nchances and fatigues of a long journey, she met by proposing that they\r\nshould travel to Exeter at their own time and in their own conveyance,\r\nand that they should afterward insure plenty of comfort and plenty of\r\nroom by taking a carriage to themselves when they reached the railroad\r\nat Exeter. After thus smoothing away the difficulties which seemed to\r\nset themselves in opposition to the journey, she again reverted to the\r\nabsolute necessity of undertaking it. She reminded Leonard of the\r\nserious interest that they both had in immediately obtaining Mrs.\r\nJazeph\'s testimony to the genuineness of the letter which had been\r\nfound in the Myrtle Room, as well as in ascertaining all the details\r\nof the extraordinary fraud which had been practiced by Mrs. Treverton\r\non her husband. She pleaded also her own natural anxiety to make all\r\nthe atonement in her power for the pain she must have unconsciously\r\ninflicted, in the bedroom at West Winston, on the person of all others\r\nwhose failings and sorrows she was most bound to respect; and having\r\nthus stated the motives which urged her husband and herself to lose no\r\ntime in communicating personally with Mrs. Jazeph, she again drew the\r\ninevitable conclusion that there was no alternative, in the position\r\nin which they were now placed, but to start forthwith on the journey\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nA little further consideration satisfied Leonard that the emergency\r\nwas of such a nature as to render all attempts to meet it by\r\nhalf-measures impossible. He felt that his own convictions agreed with\r\nhis wife\'s; and he resolved accordingly to act at once, without\r\nfurther indecision or further delay. Before the evening was over, the\r\nservants at Porthgenna were amazed by receiving directions to pack the\r\ntrunks for traveling, and to order horses at the post-town for an\r\nearly hour the next morning.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the journey, the travelers started as soon as the\r\ncarriage was ready, rested on the road toward noon, and remained for\r\nthe night at Liskeard. On the second day they arrived at Exeter, and\r\nslept there. On the third day they reached London by the railway,\r\nbetween six and seven o\'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen they were comfortably settled for the night at their hotel, and\r\nwhen an hour\'s rest and quiet had enabled them to recover a little\r\nafter the fatigues of the journey, Rosamond wrote two notes under her\r\nhusband\'s direction. The first was addressed to Mr. Buschmann: it\r\nsimply informed him of their arrival, and of their earnest desire to\r\nsee him at the hotel as early as possible the next morning, and it\r\nconcluded by cautioning him to wait until he had seen them before he\r\nannounced their presence in London to his niece.\r\n\r\nThe second note was addressed to the family solicitor, Mr. Nixon--the\r\nsame gentleman who, more than a year since, had written, at Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s request, the letter which informed Andrew Treverton of his\r\nbrother\'s decease, and of the circumstances under which the captain\r\nhad died. All that Rosamond now wrote, in her husband\'s name and her\r\nown, to ask of Mr. Nixon, was that he would endeavor to call at their\r\nhotel on his way to business the next morning, to give his opinion on\r\na private matter of great importance, which had obliged them to\r\nundertake the journey from Porthgenna to London. This note, and the\r\nnote to Uncle Joseph, were sent to their respective addresses by a\r\nmessenger on the evening when they were written.\r\n\r\nThe first visitor who arrived the next morning was the solicitor--a\r\nclear-headed, fluent, polite old gentleman, who had known Captain\r\nTreverton and his father before him. He came to the hotel fully\r\nexpecting to be consulted on some difficulties connected with the\r\nPorthgenna estate, which the local agent was perhaps unable to settle,\r\nand which might be of too confused and intricate a nature to be easily\r\nexpressed in writing. When he heard what the emergency really was, and\r\nwhen the letter that had been found in the Myrtle Room was placed in\r\nhis hands, it is not too much to say that, for the first time in the\r\ncourse of a long life and a varied practice among all sorts and\r\nconditions of clients, sheer astonishment utterly paralyzed Mr.\r\nNixon\'s faculties, and bereft him for some moments of the power of\r\nuttering a single word.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Mr. Frankland proceeded from making the disclosure to\r\nannouncing his resolution to give up the purchase-money of Porthgenna\r\nTower, if the genuineness of the letter could be proved to his own\r\nsatisfaction, the old lawyer recovered the use of his tongue\r\nimmediately, and protested against his client\'s intention with the\r\nsincere warmth of a man who thoroughly understood the advantage of\r\nbeing rich, and who knew what it was to gain and to lose a fortune of\r\nforty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nLeonard listened with patient attention while Mr. Nixon argued from\r\nhis professional point of view against regarding the letter, taken by\r\nitself, as a genuine document, and against accepting Mrs. Jazeph\'s\r\nevidence, taken with it, as decisive on the subject of Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s real parentage. He expatiated on the improbability of Mrs.\r\nTreverton\'s alleged fraud upon her husband having been committed\r\nwithout other persons besides her maid and herself being in the\r\nsecret. He declared it to be in accordance with all received\r\nexperience of human nature that one or more of those other persons\r\nmust have spoken of the secret either from malice or from want of\r\ncaution, and that the consequent exposure of the truth must, in the\r\ncourse of so long a period as twenty-two years, have come to the\r\nknowledge of some among the many people in the West of England, as\r\nwell as in London, who knew the Treverton family personally or by\r\nreputation. From this objection he passed to another, which admitted\r\nthe possible genuineness of the letter as a written document; but\r\nwhich pleaded the probability of its having been produced under the\r\ninfluence of some mental delusion on Mrs. Treverton\'s part, which her\r\nmaid might have had an interest in humoring at the time, though she\r\nmight have hesitated, after her mistress\'s death, at risking the\r\npossible consequences of attempting to profit by the imposture. Having\r\nstated this theory, as one which not only explained the writing of the\r\nletter, but the hiding of it also, Mr. Nixon further observed, in\r\nreference to Mrs. Jazeph, that any evidence she might give was of\r\nlittle or no value in a legal point of view, from the difficulty--or,\r\nhe might say, the impossibility--of satisfactorily identifying the\r\ninfant mentioned in the letter with the lady whom he had now the\r\nhonor of addressing as Mrs. Frankland, and whom no unsubstantiated\r\ndocument in existence should induce him to believe to be any other\r\nthan the daughter of his old friend and client, Captain Treverton.\r\n\r\nHaving heard the lawyer\'s objections to the end, Leonard admitted\r\ntheir ingenuity, but acknowledged at the same time that they had\r\nproduced no alteration in his impression on the subject of the letter,\r\nor in his convictions as to the course of duty which he felt bound to\r\nfollow. He would wait, he said, for Mrs. Jazeph\'s testimony before he\r\nacted decisively; but if that testimony were of such a nature, and\r\nwere given in such a manner, as to satisfy him that his wife had no\r\nmoral right to the fortune that she possessed, he would restore it at\r\nonce to the person who had--Mr. Andrew Treverton.\r\n\r\nFinding that no fresh arguments or suggestions could shake Mr.\r\nFrankland\'s resolution, and that no separate appeal to Rosamond had\r\nthe slightest effect in stimulating her to use her influence for the\r\npurpose of inducing her husband to alter his determination; and\r\nfeeling convinced, moreover, from all that he heard, that Mr.\r\nFrankland would, if he was opposed by many more objections, either\r\nemploy another professional adviser, or risk committing some fatal\r\nlegal error by acting for himself in the matter of restoring the\r\nmoney, Mr. Nixon at last consented, under protest, to give his client\r\nwhat help he needed in case it became necessary to hold communication\r\nwith Andrew Treverton. He listened with polite resignation to\r\nLeonard\'s brief statement of the questions that he intended to put to\r\nMrs. Jazeph; and said, with the slightest possible dash of sarcasm,\r\nwhen it came to his turn to speak, that they were excellent questions\r\nin a moral point of view, and would doubtless produce answers which\r\nwould be full of interest of the most romantic kind. "But," he added,\r\n"as you have one child already, Mr. Frankland, and as you may,\r\nperhaps, if I may venture on suggesting such a thing, have more in the\r\ncourse of years; and as those children, when they grow up, may hear of\r\nthe loss of their mother\'s fortune, and may wish to know why it was\r\nsacrificed, I should recommend--resting the matter on family grounds\r\nalone, and not going further to make a legal point of it also--that\r\nyou procure from Mrs. Jazeph, besides the viv\xc3\xa2 voce evidence you\r\npropose to extract (against the admissibility of which, in this case,\r\nI again protest), a written declaration, which you may leave behind\r\nyou at your death, and which may justify you in the eyes of your\r\nchildren, in case the necessity for such justification should arise at\r\nsome future period."\r\n\r\nThis advice was too plainly valuable to be neglected. At Leonard\'s\r\nrequest, Mr. Nixon drew out at once a form of declaration, affirming\r\nthe genuineness of the letter addressed by the late Mrs. Treverton on\r\nher death-bed to her husband, since also deceased, and bearing witness\r\nto the truth of the statements therein contained, both as regarded the\r\nfraud practiced on Captain Treverton and the asserted parentage of the\r\nchild. Telling Mr. Frankland that he would do well to have Mrs.\r\nJazeph\'s signature to this document attested by the names of two\r\ncompetent witnesses, Mr. Nixon handed the declaration to Rosamond to\r\nread aloud to her husband, and, finding that no objection was made to\r\nany part of it, and that he could be of no further use in the present\r\nearly stage of the proceedings, rose to take his leave. Leonard\r\nengaged to communicate with him again in the course of the day, if\r\nnecessary; and he retired, reiterating his protest to the last, and\r\ndeclaring that he had never met with such an extraordinary case and\r\nsuch a self-willed client before in the whole course of his practice.\r\n\r\nNearly an hour elapsed after the departure of the lawyer before any\r\nsecond visitor was announced. At the expiration of that time, the\r\nwelcome sound of footsteps was heard approaching the door, and Uncle\r\nJoseph entered the room.\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s observation, stimulated by anxiety, detected a change in\r\nhis look and manner the moment he appeared. His face was harassed and\r\nfatigued, and his gait, as he advanced into the room, had lost the\r\nbriskness and activity which so quaintly distinguished it when she saw\r\nhim, for the first time, at Porthgenna Tower. He tried to add to his\r\nfirst words of greeting an apology for being late; but Rosamond\r\ninterrupted him, in her eagerness to ask the first important question.\r\n\r\n"We know that you have discovered her address," she said, anxiously,\r\n"but we know nothing more. Is she as you feared to find her? Is she\r\nill?"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head sadly. "When I showed you her letter," he\r\nsaid, "what did I tell you? She is so ill, Madam, that not even the\r\nmessage your kindness gave to me will do her any good."\r\n\r\nThose few simple words struck Rosamond\'s heart with a strange fear,\r\nwhich silenced her against her own will when she tried to speak again.\r\nUncle Joseph understood the anxious look she fixed on him, and the\r\nquick sign she made toward the chair standing nearest to the sofa on\r\nwhich she and her husband were sitting. There he took his place, and\r\nthere he confided to them all that he had to tell.\r\n\r\nHe had followed, he said, the advice which Rosamond had given to him\r\nat Porthgenna, by taking a letter addressed to "S. J." to the\r\npost-office the morning after his arrival in London. The messenger--a\r\nmaid-servant--had called to inquire, as was anticipated, and had left\r\nthe post-office with his letter in her hand. He had followed her to a\r\nlodging-house in a street near, had seen her let herself in at the\r\ndoor, and had then knocked and inquired for Mrs. Jazeph. The door was\r\nanswered by an old woman, who looked like the landlady; and the reply\r\nwas that no one of that name lived there. He had then explained that\r\nhe wished to see the person for whom letters were sent to the\r\nneighboring post-office, addressed to "S. J.;" but the old woman had\r\nanswered, in the surliest way, that they had nothing to do with\r\nanonymous people or their friends in that house, and had closed the\r\ndoor in his face. Upon this he had gone back to his friend, the German\r\nbaker, to get advice; and had been recommended to return, after\r\nallowing some little time to elapse, to ask if he could see the\r\nservant who waited on the lodgers, to describe his niece\'s appearance,\r\nand to put half a crown into the girl\'s hand to help her to understand\r\nwhat he wanted. He had followed these directions, and had discovered\r\nthat his niece was lying ill in the house, under the assumed name of\r\n"Mrs. James." A little persuasion (after the present of the\r\nhalf-crown) had induced the girl to go up stairs and announce his\r\nname. After that there were no more obstacles to be overcome, and he\r\nwas conducted immediately to the room occupied by his niece.\r\n\r\nHe was inexpressibly shocked and startled when he saw her by the\r\nviolent nervous agitation which she manifested as he approached her\r\nbedside. But he did not lose heart and hope until he had communicated\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s message, and had found that it failed altogether in\r\nproducing the re-assuring effect on her spirits which he had trusted\r\nand believed that it would exercise. Instead of soothing, it seemed to\r\nexcite and alarm her afresh. Among a host of minute inquiries about\r\nMrs. Frankland\'s looks, about her manner toward him, about the exact\r\nwords she had spoken, all of which he was able to answer more or less\r\nto her satisfaction, she had addressed two questions to him, to which\r\nhe was utterly unable to reply. The first of the questions was,\r\nWhether Mrs. Frankland had said any thing about the Secret? The second\r\nwas, Whether she had spoken any chance word to lead to the suspicion\r\nthat she had found out the situation of the Myrtle Room?\r\n\r\nThe doctor in attendance had come in, the old man added, while he was\r\nstill sitting by his niece\'s bedside, and still trying ineffectually\r\nto induce her to accept the friendly and re-assuring language of Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s message. After making some inquiries and talking a little\r\nwhile on indifferent matters, the doctor had privately taken him\r\naside; had informed him that the pain over the region of the heart and\r\nthe difficulty in breathing, which were the symptoms of which his\r\nniece complained, were more serious in their nature than persons\r\nuninstructed in medical matters might be disposed to think; and had\r\nbegged him to give her no more messages from any one, unless he felt\r\nperfectly sure beforehand that they would have the effect of clearing\r\nher mind, at once and forever, from the secret anxieties that now\r\nharassed it--anxieties which he might rest assured were aggravating\r\nher malady day by day, and rendering all the medical help that could\r\nbe given of little or no avail.\r\n\r\nUpon this, after sitting longer with his niece, and after holding\r\ncounsel with himself, he had resolved to write privately to Mrs.\r\nFrankland that evening, after getting back to his friend\'s house. The\r\nletter had taken him longer to compose than any one accustomed to\r\nwriting would believe. At last, after delays in making a fair copy\r\nfrom many rough drafts, and delays in leaving his task to attend to\r\nhis niece, he had completed a letter narrating what had happened since\r\nhis arrival in London, in language which he hoped might be\r\nunderstood. Judging by comparison of dates, this letter must have\r\ncrossed Mr. and Mrs. Frankland on the road. It contained nothing more\r\nthan he had just been relating with his own lips--except that it also\r\ncommunicated, as a proof that distance had not diminished the fear\r\nwhich tormented his niece\'s mind, the explanation she had given to him\r\nof her concealment of her name, and of her choice of an abode among\r\nstrangers, when she had friends in London to whom she might have gone.\r\nThat explanation it was perhaps needless to have lengthened the letter\r\nby repeating, for it only involved his saying over again, in\r\nsubstance, what he had already said in speaking of the motive which\r\nhad forced Sarah to part from him at Truro.\r\n\r\nWith last words such as those, the sad and simple story of the old man\r\ncame to an end. After waiting a little to recover her self-possession\r\nand to steady her voice, Rosamond touched her husband to draw his\r\nattention to herself, and whispered to him--\r\n\r\n"I may say all, now, that I wished to say at Porthgenna?"\r\n\r\n"All," he answered. "If you can trust yourself, Rosamond, it is\r\nfittest that he should hear it from your lips."\r\n\r\nAfter the first natural burst of astonishment was over, the effect of\r\nthe disclosure of the Secret on Uncle Joseph exhibited the most\r\nstriking contrast that can be imagined to the effect of it on Mr.\r\nNixon. No shadow of doubt darkened the old man\'s face, not a word of\r\nobjection dropped from his lips. The one emotion excited in him was\r\nsimple, unreflecting, unalloyed delight. He sprang to his feet with\r\nall his natural activity, his eyes sparkled again with all their\r\nnatural brightness; one moment he clapped his hands like a child; the\r\nnext he caught up his hat, and entreated Rosamond to let him lead her\r\nat once to his niece\'s bedside. "If you will only tell Sarah what you\r\nhave just told me," he cried, hurrying across the room to open the\r\ndoor, "you will give her back her courage, you will raise her up from\r\nher bed, you will cure her before the day is out!"\r\n\r\nA warning word from Mr. Frankland stopped him on a sudden, and brought\r\nhim back, silent and attentive, to the chair that he had left the\r\nmoment before.\r\n\r\n"Think a little of what the doctor told you," said Leonard. "The\r\nsudden surprise which has made you so happy might do fatal mischief to\r\nyour niece. Before we take the responsibility of speaking to her on a\r\nsubject which is sure to agitate her violently, however careful we may\r\nbe in introducing it, we ought first, I think, for safety\'s sake, to\r\napply to the doctor for advice."\r\n\r\nRosamond warmly seconded her husband\'s suggestion, and, with her\r\ncharacteristic impatience of delay, proposed that they should find out\r\nthe medical man immediately. Uncle Joseph announced--a little\r\nunwillingly, as it seemed--in answer to her inquiries, that he knew\r\nthe place of the doctor\'s residence, and that he was generally to be\r\nfound at home before one o\'clock in the afternoon. It was then just\r\nhalf-past twelve; and Rosamond, with her husband\'s approval, rang the\r\nbell at once to send for a cab.\r\n\r\nShe was about to leave the room to put on her bonnet, after giving the\r\nnecessary order, when the old man stopped her by asking, with some\r\nappearance of hesitation and confusion, if it was considered necessary\r\nthat he should go to the doctor with Mr. and Mrs. Frankland; adding,\r\nbefore the question could be answered, that he would greatly prefer,\r\nif there was no objection to it on their parts, being left to wait at\r\nthe hotel to receive any instructions they might wish to give him on\r\ntheir return. Leonard immediately complied with his request, without\r\ninquiring into his reasons for making it; but Rosamond\'s curiosity was\r\naroused, and she asked why he preferred remaining by himself at the\r\nhotel to going with them to the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I like him not," said the old man. "When he speaks about Sarah, he\r\nlooks and talks as if he thought she would never get up from her bed\r\nagain." Answering in those brief words, he walked away uneasily to the\r\nwindow, as if he desired to say no more.\r\n\r\nThe residence of the doctor was at some little distance, but Mr. and\r\nMrs. Frankland arrived there before one o\'clock, and found him at\r\nhome. He was a young man, with a mild, grave face, and a quiet,\r\nsubdued manner. Daily contact with suffering and sorrow had perhaps\r\nprematurely steadied and saddened his character. Merely introducing\r\nher husband and herself to him, as persons who were deeply interested\r\nin his patient at the lodging-house, Rosamond left it to Leonard to\r\nask the first questions relating to the condition of her mother\'s\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s answer was ominously prefaced by a few polite words,\r\nwhich were evidently intended to prepare his hearers for a less\r\nhopeful report than they might have come there expecting to receive.\r\nCarefully divesting the subject of all professional technicalities, he\r\ntold them that his patient was undoubtedly affected with serious\r\ndisease of the heart. The exact nature of this disease he candidly\r\nacknowledged to be a matter of doubt, which various medical men might\r\ndecide in various ways. According to the opinion which he had himself\r\nformed from the symptoms, he believed that the patient\'s malady was\r\nconnected with the artery which conveys blood directly from the heart\r\nthrough the system. Having found her singularly unwilling to answer\r\nquestions relating to the nature of her past life, he could only guess\r\nthat the disease was of long standing; that it was originally produced\r\nby some great mental shock, followed by long-wearing anxiety (of which\r\nher face showed palpable traces); and that it had been seriously\r\naggravated by the fatigue of a journey to London, which she\r\nacknowledged she had undertaken at a time when great nervous\r\nexhaustion rendered her totally unfit to travel. Speaking according to\r\nthis view of the case, it was his painful duty to tell her friends\r\nthat any violent emotion would unquestionably put her life in danger.\r\nAt the same time, if the mental uneasiness from which she was now\r\nsuffering could be removed, and if she could be placed in a quiet,\r\ncomfortable country home, among people who would be unremittingly\r\ncareful in keeping her composed, and in suffering her to want for\r\nnothing, there was reason to hope that the progress of the disease\r\nmight be arrested, and that her life might be spared for some years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s heart bounded at the picture of the future which her fancy\r\ndrew from the suggestions that lay hidden in the doctor\'s last words.\r\n"She can command every advantage you have mentioned, and more, if more\r\nis required!" she interposed eagerly, before her husband could speak\r\nagain. "Oh, Sir, if rest among kind friends is all that her poor weary\r\nheart wants, thank God we can give it!"\r\n\r\n"We can give it," said Leonard, continuing the sentence for his wife,\r\n"if the doctor will sanction our making a communication to his\r\npatient, which is of a nature to relieve her of all anxiety, but\r\nwhich, it is necessary to add, she is at present quite unprepared to\r\nreceive."\r\n\r\n"May I ask," said the doctor, "who is to be intrusted with the\r\nresponsibility of making the communication you mention?"\r\n\r\n"There are two persons who could be intrusted with it," answered\r\nLeonard. "One is the old man whom you have seen by your patient\'s\r\nbedside. The other is my wife."\r\n\r\n"In that case," rejoined the doctor, looking at Rosamond, "there can\r\nbe no doubt that this lady is the fittest person to undertake the\r\nduty." He paused, and reflected for a moment; then added--"May I\r\ninquire, however, before I venture on guiding your decision one way or\r\nthe other, whether the lady is as familiarly known to my patient, and\r\nis on the same intimate terms with her, as the old man?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I must answer No to both those questions," replied\r\nLeonard. "And I ought, perhaps, to tell you, at the same time, that\r\nyour patient believes my wife to be now in Cornwall. Her first\r\nappearance in the sick-room would, I fear, cause great surprise to the\r\nsufferer, and possibly some little alarm as well."\r\n\r\n"Under those circumstances," said the doctor, "the risk of trusting\r\nthe old man, simple as he is, seems to be infinitely the least risk of\r\nthe two--for the plain reason that his presence can cause her no\r\nsurprise. However unskillfully he may break the news, he will have the\r\ngreat advantage over this lady of not appearing unexpectedly at the\r\nbedside. If the hazardous experiment must be tried--and I assume that\r\nit must, from what you have said--you have no choice, I think, but to\r\ntrust it, with proper cautions and instructions, to the old man to\r\ncarry out."\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at that conclusion, there was no more to be said on\r\neither side. The interview terminated, and Rosamond and her husband\r\nhastened back to give Uncle Joseph his instructions at the hotel.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the door of their sitting-room they were surprised\r\nby hearing the sound of music inside. On entering, they found the old\r\nman crouched upon a stool, listening to a shabby little musical box\r\nwhich was placed on a table close by him, and which was playing an\r\nair that Rosamond recognized immediately as the "Batti, Batti" of\r\nMozart.\r\n\r\n"I hope you will pardon me for making music to keep myself company\r\nwhile you were away," said Uncle Joseph, starting up in some little\r\nconfusion, and touching the stop of the box. "This is, if you please,\r\nof all my friends and companions, the oldest that is left. The divine\r\nMozart, the king of all the composers that ever lived, gave it with\r\nhis own hand, Madam, to my brother, when Max was a boy in the music\r\nschool at Vienna. Since my niece left me in Cornwall, I have not had\r\nthe heart to make Mozart sing to me out of this little bit of box\r\nuntil to-day. Now that you have made me happy about Sarah again, my\r\nears ache once more for the tiny _ting-ting_ that has always the same\r\nfriendly sound to my heart, travel where I may. But enough so!" said\r\nthe old man, placing the box in the leather case by his side, which\r\nRosamond had noticed there when she first saw him at Porthgenna. "I\r\nshall put back my singing-bird into his cage, and shall ask, when that\r\nis done, if you will be pleased to tell me what it is that the doctor\r\nhas said?"\r\n\r\nRosamond answered his request by relating the substance of the\r\nconversation which had passed between her husband and the doctor. She\r\nthen, with many preparatory cautions, proceeded to instruct the old\r\nman how to disclose the discovery of the Secret to his niece. She told\r\nhim that the circumstances in connection with it must be first stated,\r\nnot as events that had really happened, but as events that might be\r\nsupposed to have happened. She put the words that he would have to\r\nspeak into his mouth, choosing the fewest and the plainest that would\r\nanswer the purpose; she showed him how he might glide almost\r\nimperceptibly from referring to the discovery as a thing that might be\r\nsupposed, to referring to it as a thing that had really happened; and\r\nshe impressed upon him, as most important of all, to keep perpetually\r\nbefore his niece\'s mind the fact that the discovery of the Secret had\r\nnot awakened one bitter feeling or one resentful thought toward her,\r\nin the minds of either of the persons who had been so deeply\r\ninterested in finding it out.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph listened with unwavering attention until Rosamond had\r\ndone; then rose from his seat, fixed his eyes intently on her face,\r\nand detected an expression of anxiety and doubt in it which he rightly\r\ninterpreted as referring to himself.\r\n\r\n"May I make you sure, before I go away, that I shall forget nothing?"\r\nhe asked, very earnestly. "I have no head to invent, it is true; but I\r\nhave something in me that can remember, and the more especially when\r\nit is for Sarah\'s sake. If you please, listen now, and hear if I can\r\nsay to you over again all that you have said to me?"\r\n\r\nStanding before Rosamond, with something in his look and manner\r\nstrangely and touchingly suggestive of the long-past days of his\r\nchildhood, and of the time when he had said his earliest lessons at\r\nhis mother\'s knee, he now repeated, from first to last, the\r\ninstructions that had been given to him, with a verbal exactness, with\r\nan easy readiness of memory, which, in a man of his age, was nothing\r\nless than astonishing. "Have I kept it all as I should?" he asked,\r\nsimply, when he had come to an end. "And may I go my ways now, and\r\ntake my good news to Sarah\'s bedside?"\r\n\r\nIt was still necessary to detain him, while Rosamond and her husband\r\nconsulted together on the best and safest means of following up the\r\navowal that the Secret was discovered by the announcement of their own\r\npresence in London.\r\n\r\nAfter some consideration, Leonard asked his wife to produce the\r\ndocument which the lawyer had drawn out that morning, and to write a\r\nfew lines, from his dictation, on the blank side of the paper,\r\nrequesting Mrs. Jazeph to read the form of declaration, and to affix\r\nher signature to it, if she felt that it required her, in every\r\nparticular, to affirm nothing that was not the exact truth. When this\r\nhad been done, and when the leaf on which Mrs. Frankland had written\r\nhad been folded outward, so that it might be the first page to catch\r\nthe eye, Leonard directed that the paper should be given to the old\r\nman, and explained to him what he was to do with it, in these words:\r\n\r\n"When you have broken the news about the Secret to your niece," he\r\nsaid, "and when you have allowed her full time to compose herself, if\r\nshe asks questions about my wife and myself (as I believe she will),\r\nhand that paper to her for answer, and beg her to read it. Whether she\r\nis willing to sign it or not, she is sure to inquire how you came by\r\nit. Tell her in return that you have received it from Mrs.\r\nFrankland--using the word \'received,\' so that she may believe at first\r\nthat it was sent to you from Porthgenna by post. If you find that she\r\nsigns the declaration, and that she is not much agitated after doing\r\nso, then tell her in the same gradual way in which you tell the truth\r\nabout the discovery of the Secret, that my wife gave the paper to you\r\nwith her own hands, and that she is now in London--"\r\n\r\n"Waiting and longing to see her," added Rosamond. "You, who forget\r\nnothing, will not, I am sure, forget to say that."\r\n\r\nThe little compliment to his powers of memory made Uncle Joseph color\r\nwith pleasure, as if he was a boy again. Promising to prove worthy of\r\nthe trust reposed in him, and engaging to come back and relieve Mrs.\r\nFrankland of all suspense before the day was out, he took his leave,\r\nand went forth hopefully on his momentous errand.\r\n\r\nRosamond watched him from the window, threading his way in and out\r\namong the throng of passengers on the pavement, until he was lost to\r\nview. How nimbly the light little figure sped away out of sight! How\r\ngayly the unclouded sunlight poured down on the cheerful bustle in the\r\nstreet! The whole being of the great city basked in the summer glory\r\nof the day; all its mighty pulses beat high, and all its myriad voices\r\nwhispered of hope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE PAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore away and the evening came, and still there were no\r\nsigns of Uncle Joseph\'s return.\r\n\r\nToward seven o\'clock, Rosamond was summoned by the nurse, who reported\r\nthat the child was awake and fretful. After soothing and quieting him,\r\nshe took him back with her to the sitting-room, having first, with her\r\nusual consideration for the comfort of any servant whom she employed,\r\nsent the nurse down stairs, with a leisure hour at her own disposal,\r\nafter the duties of the day. "I don\'t like to be away from you, Lenny,\r\nat this anxious time," she said, when she rejoined her husband; "so I\r\nhave brought the child in here. He is not likely to be troublesome\r\nagain, and the having him to take care of is really a relief to me in\r\nour present state of suspense."\r\n\r\nThe clock on the mantel-piece chimed the half-hour past seven. The\r\ncarriages in the street were following one another more and more\r\nrapidly, filled with people in full dress, on their way to dinner, or\r\non their way to the opera. The hawkers were shouting proclamations of\r\nnews in the neighboring square, with the second editions of the\r\nevening papers under their arms. People who had been serving behind\r\nthe counter all day were standing at the shop door to get a breath of\r\nfresh air. Working men were trooping homeward, now singly, now\r\ntogether, in weary, shambling gangs. Idlers, who had come out after\r\ndinner, were lighting cigars at corners of streets, and looking about\r\nthem, uncertain which way they should turn their steps next. It was\r\njust that transitional period of the evening at which the street-life\r\nof the day is almost over, and the street-life of the night has not\r\nquite begun--just the time, also, at which Rosamond, after vainly\r\ntrying to find relief from the weariness of waiting by looking out of\r\nwindow, was becoming more and more deeply absorbed in her own anxious\r\nthoughts--when her attention was abruptly recalled to events in the\r\nlittle world about her by the opening of the room door. She looked up\r\nimmediately from the child lying asleep on her lap, and saw that Uncle\r\nJoseph had returned at last.\r\n\r\nThe old man came in silently, with the form of declaration which he\r\nhad taken away with him, by Mr. Frankland\'s desire, open in his hand.\r\nAs he approached nearer to the window, Rosamond noticed that his face\r\nlooked as if it had grown strangely older during the few hours of his\r\nabsence. He came close up to her, and still not saying a word, laid\r\nhis trembling forefinger low down on the open paper, and held it\r\nbefore her so that she could look at the place thus indicated without\r\nrising from her chair.\r\n\r\nHis silence and the change in his face struck her with a sudden dread\r\nwhich made her hesitate before she spoke to him. "Have you told her\r\nall?" she asked, after a moment\'s delay, putting the question in low,\r\nwhispering tones, and not heeding the paper.\r\n\r\n"This answers that I have," he said, still pointing to the\r\ndeclaration. "See! here is the name, signed in the place that was left\r\nfor it--signed by her own hand."\r\n\r\nRosamond glanced at the paper. There indeed was the signature, "S.\r\nJazeph;" and underneath it were added, in faintly traced lines of\r\nparenthesis, these explanatory words--"Formerly, Sarah Leeson."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you speak?" exclaimed Rosamond, looking at him in growing\r\nalarm. "Why don\'t you tell us how she bore it?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! don\'t ask me, don\'t ask me!" he answered, shrinking back from her\r\nhand, as she tried in her eagerness to lay it on his arm. "I forgot\r\nnothing. I said the words as you taught me to say them--I went the\r\nroundabout way to the truth with my tongue; but my face took the short\r\ncut, and got to the end first. Pray, of your goodness to me, ask\r\nnothing about it! Be satisfied, if you please, with knowing that she\r\nis better and quieter and happier now. The bad is over and past, and\r\nthe good is all to come. If I tell you how she looked, if I tell you\r\nwhat she said, if I tell you all that happened when first she knew the\r\ntruth, the fright will catch me round the heart again, and all the\r\nsobbing and crying that I have swallowed down will rise once more and\r\nchoke me. I must keep my head clear and my eyes dry--or how shall I\r\nsay to you all the things that I have promised Sarah, as I love my own\r\nsoul and hers, to tell, before I lay myself down to rest to-night?" He\r\nstopped, took out a coarse little cotton pocket-handkerchief, with a\r\nflaring white pattern on a dull blue ground, and dried a few tears\r\nthat had risen in his eyes while he was speaking. "My life has had so\r\nmuch happiness in it," he said, self-reproachfully, looking at\r\nRosamond, "that my courage, when it is wanted for the time of trouble,\r\nis not easy to find. And yet, I am German! all my nation are\r\nphilosophers!--why is it that I alone am as soft in my brains, and as\r\nweak in my heart, as the pretty little baby there, that is lying\r\nasleep in your lap?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak again; don\'t tell us any thing till you feel more\r\ncomposed," said Rosamond. "We are relieved from our worst suspense now\r\nthat we know you have left her quieter and better. I will ask no more\r\nquestions; at least," she added, after a pause, "I will only ask one."\r\nShe stopped; and her eyes wandered inquiringly toward Leonard. He had\r\nhitherto been listening with silent interest to all that had passed;\r\nbut he now interposed gently, and advised his wife to wait a little\r\nbefore she ventured on saying any thing more.\r\n\r\n"It is such an easy question to answer," pleaded Rosamond. "I only\r\nwanted to hear whether she has got my message--whether she knows that\r\nI am waiting and longing to see her, if she will but let me come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said the old man, nodding to Rosamond with an air of\r\nrelief. "That question is easy; easier even than you think, for it\r\nbrings me straight to the beginning of all that I have got to say."\r\n\r\nHe had been hitherto walking restlessly about the room; sitting down\r\none moment, and getting up the next. He now placed a chair for himself\r\nmidway between Rosamond--who was sitting, with the child, near the\r\nwindow--and her husband, who occupied the sofa at the lower end of the\r\nroom. In this position, which enabled him to address himself\r\nalternately to Mr. and Mrs. Frankland without difficulty, he soon\r\nrecovered composure enough to open his heart unreservedly to the\r\ninterest of his subject.\r\n\r\n"When the worst was over and past," he said, addressing\r\nRosamond--"when she could listen and when I could speak, the first\r\nwords of comfort that I said to her were the words of your message.\r\nStraight she looked at me, with doubting, fearing eyes. \'Was her\r\nhusband there to hear her?\' she says. \'Did he look angry? did he look\r\nsorry? did he change ever so little, when you got that message from\r\nher?\' And I said, \'No; no change, no anger, no sorrow--nothing like\r\nit.\' And she said again: \'Has it made between them no misery? has it\r\nnothing wrenched away of all the love and all the happiness that binds\r\nthem the one to the other?\' And once more I answer to that, \'No! no\r\nmisery, no wrench. See now! I shall go my ways at once to the good\r\nwife, and fetch her here to answer for the good husband with her own\r\ntongue.\' While I speak those words there flies out over all her face a\r\nlook--no, not a look--a light, like a sun-flash. While I can count\r\none, it lasts; before I can count two, it is gone; the face is all\r\ndark again; it is turned away from me on the pillow, and I see the\r\nhand that is outside the bed begin to crumple up the sheet. \'I shall\r\ngo my ways, then, and fetch the good wife,\' I say again. And she\r\nsays, \'No, not yet. I must not see her, I dare not see her till she\r\nknows--;\' and there she stops, and the hand crumples up the sheet\r\nagain, and softly, softly, I say to her, \'Knows what?\' and she answers\r\nme, \'What I, her mother, can not tell her to her face, for shame.\' And\r\nI say, \'So, so, my child! tell it not, then--tell it not at all.\' She\r\nshakes her head at me, and wrings her two hands together, like this,\r\non the bed-cover. \'I _must_ tell it,\' she says. \'I must rid my heart\r\nof all that has been gnawing, gnawing, gnawing at it, or how shall I\r\nfeel the blessing that the seeing her will bring to me, if my\r\nconscience is only clear?\' Then she stops a little, and lifts up her\r\ntwo hands, so, and cries out loud, \'Oh, will God\'s mercy show me no\r\nway of telling it that will spare me before my child!\' And I say,\r\n\'Hush, then! there is a way. Tell it to Uncle Joseph, who is the same\r\nas father to you! Tell it to Uncle Joseph, whose little son died in\r\nyour arms; whose tears your hand wiped away, in the grief time long\r\nago. Tell it, my child, to _me_; and _I_ shall take the risk, and the\r\nshame (if there is shame), of telling it again. I, with nothing to\r\nspeak for me but my white hair; I, with nothing to help me but my\r\nheart that means no harm--I shall go to that good and true woman, with\r\nthe burden of her mother\'s grief to lay before her; and, in my soul of\r\nsouls I believe it, she will not turn away!\'"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked at Rosamond. Her head was bent down over her\r\nchild; her tears were dropping slowly, one by one, on the bosom of his\r\nlittle white dress. Waiting a moment to collect herself before she\r\nspoke, she held out her hand to the old man, and firmly and gratefully\r\nmet the look he fixed on her. "Oh, go on, go on!" she said. "Let me\r\nprove to you that your generous confidence in me is not misplaced."\r\n\r\n"I knew it was not, from the first, as surely as I know it now!" said\r\nUncle Joseph. "And Sarah, when I had spoken to her, she knew it too.\r\nShe was silent for a little; she cried for a little; she leaned over\r\nfrom the pillow and kissed me here, on my cheek, as I sat by the\r\nbedside; and then she looked back, back, back, in her mind, to the\r\nLong Ago, and very quietly, very slowly, with her eyes looking into my\r\neyes, and her hand resting so in mine, she spoke the words to me that\r\nI must now speak again to you, who sit here to-day as her judge,\r\nbefore you go to her to-morrow as her child."\r\n\r\n"Not as her judge!" said Rosamond. "I can not, I must not hear you say\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I speak her words, not mine," rejoined the old man, gravely. "Wait\r\nbefore you bid me change them for others--wait till you know the end."\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair a little nearer to Rosamond, paused for a minute or\r\ntwo to arrange his recollections, and to separate them one from the\r\nother; then resumed.\r\n\r\n"As Sarah began with me," he said, "so I, for my part, must begin\r\nalso--which means to say, that I go down now through the years that\r\nare past, to the time when my niece went out to her first service. You\r\nknow that the sea-captain, the brave and good man Treverton, took for\r\nhis wife an artist on the stage--what they call play-actress here? A\r\ngrand, big woman, and a handsome; with a life and a spirit and a will\r\nin her that is not often seen; a woman of the sort who can say, We\r\nwill do this thing, or that thing--and do it in the spite and face of\r\nall the scruples, all the obstacles, all the oppositions in the world.\r\nTo this lady there comes for maid to wait upon her, Sarah, my niece--a\r\nyoung girl then, pretty and kind and gentle, and very, very shy. Out\r\nof many others who want the place, and who are bolder and bigger and\r\nquicker girls, Mistress Treverton, nevertheless, picks Sarah. This is\r\nstrange, but it is stranger yet that Sarah, on her part, when she\r\ncomes out of her first fears and doubts, and pains of shyness about\r\nherself, gets to be fond with all her heart of that grand and handsome\r\nmistress, who has a life and a spirit and a will of the sort that is\r\nnot often seen. This is strange to say, but it is also, as I know from\r\nSarah\'s own lips, every word of it true."\r\n\r\n"True beyond a doubt," said Leonard. "Most strong attachments are\r\nformed between people who are unlike each other."\r\n\r\n"So the life they led in that ancient house of Porthgenna began\r\nhappily for them all," continued the old man. "The love that the\r\nmistress had for her husband was so full in her heart that it\r\noverflowed in kindness to every body who was about her, and to Sarah,\r\nher maid, before all the rest. She would have nobody but Sarah to read\r\nto her, to work for her, to dress her in the morning and the evening,\r\nand to undress her at night. She was as familiar as a sister might\r\nhave been with Sarah, when they two were alone, in the long days of\r\nrain. It was the game of her idle time--the laugh that she liked\r\nmost--to astonish the poor country maid, who had never so much as seen\r\nwhat a theatre\'s inside was like, by dressing in fine clothes, and\r\npainting her face, and speaking and doing all that she had done on the\r\ntheatre-scene in the days that were before her marriage. The more she\r\npuzzled Sarah with these jokes and pranks of masquerade, the better\r\nshe was always pleased. For a year this easy, happy life went on in\r\nthe ancient house--happy for all the servants--happier still for the\r\nmaster and mistress, but for the want of one thing to make the whole\r\ncomplete, one little blessing that was always hoped for, and that\r\nnever came--the same, if you please, as the blessing in the long white\r\nfrock, with the plump, delicate face and the tiny arms, that I see\r\nbefore me now."\r\n\r\nHe paused, to point the allusion by nodding and smiling at the child\r\nin Rosamond\'s lap; then resumed.\r\n\r\n"As the new year gets on," he said, "Sarah sees in the mistress a\r\nchange. The good sea-captain is a man who loves children, and is fond\r\nof getting to the house all the little boys and girls of his friends\r\nround about. He plays with them, he kisses them, he makes them\r\npresents--he is the best friend the little boys and girls have ever\r\nhad. The mistress, who should be their best friend too, looks on and\r\nsays nothing--looks on, red sometimes, and sometimes pale; goes away\r\ninto her room where Sarah is at work for her, and walks about and\r\nfinds fault; and one day lets the evil temper fly out of her at her\r\ntongue, and says, \'Why have I got no child for my husband to be fond\r\nof? Why must he kiss and play always with the children of other women?\r\nThey take his love away for something that is not mine. I hate those\r\nchildren and their mothers too!\' It is her passion that speaks then,\r\nbut it speaks what is near the truth for all that. She will not make\r\nfriends with any of those mothers; the ladies she is familiar-fond\r\nwith are the ladies who have no children, or the ladies whose families\r\nare all upgrown. You think that was wrong of the mistress?"\r\n\r\nHe put the question to Rosamond, who was toying thoughtfully with one\r\nof the baby\'s hands which was resting in hers. "I think Mrs. Treverton\r\nwas very much to be pitied," she answered, gently lifting the child\'s\r\nhand to her lips.\r\n\r\n"Then I, for my part, think so too," said Uncle Joseph. "To be\r\npitied?--yes! To be more pitied some months after, when there is still\r\nno child and no hope of a child, and the good sea-captain says, one\r\nday, \'I rust here, I get old with much idleness; I want to be on the\r\nsea again. I shall ask for a ship.\' And he asks for a ship, and they\r\ngive it him; and he goes away on his cruises--with much kissing and\r\nfondness at parting from his wife--but still he goes away. And when he\r\nis gone, the mistress comes in again where Sarah is at work for her on\r\na fine new gown, and snatches it away, and casts it down on the floor,\r\nand throws after it all the fine jewels she has got on her table, and\r\nstamps and cries with the misery and the passion that is in her. \'I\r\nwould give all those fine things, and go in rags for the rest of my\r\nlife, to have a child!\' she says. \'I am losing my husband\'s love: he\r\nwould never have gone away from me if I had brought him a child!\' Then\r\nshe looks in the glass, and says between her teeth, \'Yes! yes! I am a\r\nfine woman, with a fine figure, and I would change places with the\r\nugliest, crookedest wretch in all creation, if I could only have a\r\nchild!\' And then she tells Sarah that the Captain\'s brother spoke the\r\nvilest of all vile words of her, when she was married, because she was\r\nan artist on the stage; and she says, \'If I have no child, who but\r\nhe--the rascal-monster that I wish I could kill!--who but he will come\r\nto possess all that the Captain has got?\' And then she cries again,\r\nand says, \'I am losing his love--ah, I know it, I know it!--I am\r\nlosing his love!\' Nothing that Sarah can say will alter her thoughts\r\nabout that. And the months go on, and the sea-captain comes back, and\r\nstill there is always the same secret grief growing and growing in the\r\nmistress\'s heart--growing and growing till it is now the third year\r\nsince the marriage, and there is no hope yet of a child; and once more\r\nthe sea-captain gets tired on the land, and goes off again for his\r\ncruises--long cruises, this time; away, away, away, at the other end\r\nof the world."\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Joseph paused once more, apparently hesitating a little\r\nabout how he should go on with the narrative. His mind seemed to be\r\nsoon relieved of its doubts, but his face saddened, and his tones\r\nsank lower, when he addressed Rosamond again.\r\n\r\n"I must, if you please, go away from the mistress now," he said, "and\r\nget back to Sarah, my niece, and say one word also of a mining man,\r\nwith the Cornish name of Polwheal. This was a young man that worked\r\nwell and got good wage, and kept a good character. He lived with his\r\nmother in the little village that is near the ancient house; and,\r\nseeing Sarah from time to time, took much fancy to her, and she to\r\nhim. So the end came that the marriage-promise was between them given\r\nand taken; as it happened, about the time when the sea-captain was\r\nback after his first cruises, and just when he was thinking of going\r\naway in a ship again. Against the marriage-promise nor he nor the lady\r\nhis wife had a word to object, for the miner, Polwheal, had good wage\r\nand kept a good character. Only the mistress said that the loss of\r\nSarah would be sad to her--very sad; and Sarah answered that there was\r\nyet no hurry to part. So the weeks go on, and the sea-captain sails\r\naway again for his long cruises; and about the same time also the\r\nmistress finds out that Sarah frets, and looks not like herself, and\r\nthat the miner, Polwheal, he lurks here and lurks there, round about\r\nthe house; and she says to herself, \'So! so! Am I standing too much in\r\nthe way of this marriage? For Sarah\'s sake, that shall not be!\' And\r\nshe calls for them both one evening, and talks to them kindly, and\r\nsends away to put up the banns next morning the young man Polwheal.\r\nThat night, it is his turn to go down into the Porthgenna mine, and\r\nwork after the hours of the day. With his heart all light, down into\r\nthat dark he goes. When he rises to the world again, it is the dead\r\nbody of him that is drawn up--the dead body, with all the young life,\r\nby the fall of a rock, crushed out in a moment. The news flies here;\r\nthe news flies there. With no break, with no warning, with no comfort\r\nnear, it comes on a sudden to Sarah, my niece. When to her sweet-heart\r\nthat evening she had said good-by, she was a young, pretty girl; when,\r\nsix little weeks after, she, from the sick-bed where the shock threw\r\nher, got up, all her youth was gone, all her hair was gray, and in her\r\neyes the fright-look was fixed that has never left them since."\r\n\r\nThe simple words drew the picture of the miner\'s death, and of all\r\nthat followed it, with a startling distinctness--with a fearful\r\nreality. Rosamond shuddered, and looked at her husband. "Oh, Lenny!"\r\nshe murmured, "the first news of your blindness was a sore trial to\r\nme--but what was it to this!"\r\n\r\n"Pity her!" said the old man. "Pity her for what she suffered then!\r\nPity her for what came after, that was worse! Yet five, six, seven\r\nweeks pass, after the death of the mining man, and Sarah in the body\r\nsuffers less, but in the mind suffers more. The mistress, who is kind\r\nand good to her as any sister could be, finds out, little by little,\r\nsomething in her face which is not the pain-look, nor the fright-look,\r\nnor the grief-look; something which the eyes can see, but which the\r\ntongue can not put into words. She looks and thinks, looks and thinks,\r\ntill there steals into her mind a doubt which makes her tremble at\r\nherself, which drives her straight forward into Sarah\'s room, which\r\nsets her eyes searching through and through Sarah to her inmost heart.\r\n\'There is something on your mind besides your grief for the dead and\r\ngone,\' she says, and catches Sarah by both the arms before she can\r\nturn way, and looks her in the face, front to front, with curious eyes\r\nthat search and suspect steadily. \'The miner man, Polwheal,\' she says;\r\n\'my mind misgives me about the miner man, Polwheal. Sarah! I have been\r\nmore friend to you than mistress. As your friend I ask you now--tell\r\nme all the truth?\' The question waits; but no word of answer! only\r\nSarah struggles to get away, and the mistress holds her tighter yet,\r\nand goes on and says, \'I know that the marriage-promise passed between\r\nyou and miner Polwheal; I know that if ever there was truth in man,\r\nthere was truth in him; I know that he went out from this place to put\r\nthe banns up, for you and for him, in the church. Have secrets from\r\nall the world besides, Sarah, but have none from _me_. Tell me, this\r\nminute--tell me the truth! Of all the lost creatures in this big, wide\r\nworld, are you--?\' Before she can say the words that are next to come,\r\nSarah falls on her knees, and cries out suddenly to be let go away to\r\nhide and die, and be heard of no more. That was all the answer she\r\ngave. It was enough for the truth then; it is enough for the truth\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nHe sighed bitterly, and ceased speaking for a little while. No voice\r\nbroke the reverent silence that followed his last words. The one\r\nliving sound that stirred in the stillness of the room was the light\r\nbreathing of the child as he lay asleep in his mother\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"That was all the answer," repeated the old man, "and the mistress who\r\nheard it says nothing for some time after, but still looks straight\r\nforward into Sarah\'s face, and grows paler and paler the longer she\r\nlooks--paler and paler, till on a sudden she starts, and at one flash\r\nthe red flies back into her face. \'No,\' she says, whispering and\r\nlooking at the door, \'once your friend, Sarah, always your friend.\r\nStay in this house, keep your own counsel, do as I bid you, and leave\r\nthe rest to me.\' And with that she turns round quick on her heel, and\r\nfalls to walking up and down the room--faster, faster, faster, till\r\nshe is out of breath. Then she pulls the bell with an angry jerk, and\r\ncalls out loud at the door--\'The horses! I want to ride;\' then turns\r\nupon Sarah--\'My gown for riding in! Pluck up your heart, poor\r\ncreature! On my life and honor, I will save you. My gown, my gown,\r\nthen; I am mad for a gallop in the open air!\' And she goes out, in a\r\nfever of the blood, and gallops, gallops, till the horse reeks again,\r\nand the groom-man who rides after her wonders if she is mad. When she\r\ncomes back, for all that ride in the air, she is not tired. The whole\r\nevening after, she is now walking about the room, and now striking\r\nloud tunes all mixed up together on the piano. At the bed-time, she\r\ncan not rest. Twice, three times in the night she frightens Sarah by\r\ncoming in to see how she does, and by saying always those same words\r\nover again: \'Keep your own counsel, do as I bid you, and leave the\r\nrest to me.\' In the morning she lies late, sleeps, gets up very pale\r\nand quiet, and says to Sarah, \'No word more between us two of what\r\nhappened yesterday--no word till the time comes when you fear the eyes\r\nof every stranger who looks at you. Then I shall speak again. Till\r\nthat time let us be as we were before I put the question yesterday,\r\nand before you told the truth!\'"\r\n\r\nAt this point he broke the thread of the narrative again, explaining\r\nas he did so that his memory was growing confused about a question of\r\ntime, which he wished to state correctly in introducing the series of\r\nevents that were next to be described.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well! well!" he said, shaking his head, after vainly endeavoring\r\nto pursue the lost recollection. "For once, I must acknowledge that I\r\nforget. Whether it was two months, or whether it was three, after the\r\nmistress said those last words to Sarah, I know not--but at the end of\r\nthe one time or of the other she one morning orders her carriage and\r\ngoes away alone to Truro. In the evening she comes back with two large\r\nflat baskets. On the cover of the one there is a card, and written on\r\nit are the letters \'S. L.\' On the cover of the other there is a card,\r\nand written on it are the letters \'R. T.\' The baskets are taken into\r\nthe mistress\'s room, and Sarah is called, and the mistress says to\r\nher, \'Open the basket with S. L. on it; for those are the letters of\r\nyour name, and the things in it are yours.\' Inside there is first a\r\nbox, which holds a grand bonnet of black lace; then a fine dark shawl;\r\nthen black silk of the best kind, enough to make a gown; then linen\r\nand stuff for the under garments, all of the finest sort. \'Make up\r\nthose things to fit yourself,\' says the mistress. \'You are so much\r\nlittler than I, that to make the things up new is less trouble than,\r\nfrom my fit to yours, to alter old gowns.\' Sarah, to all this, says in\r\nastonishment, \'Why?\' And the mistress answers, \'I will have no\r\nquestions. Remember what I said--Keep your own counsel, and leave the\r\nrest to me!\' So she goes out; and the next thing she does is to send\r\nfor the doctor to see her. He asks what is the matter; gets for answer\r\nthat Mistress Treverton feels strangely, and not like herself; also\r\nthat she thinks the soft air of Cornwall makes her weak. The days\r\npass, and the doctor comes and goes, and, say what he may, those two\r\nanswers are always the only two that he can get. All this time Sarah\r\nis at work; and when she has done, the mistress says, \'Now for the\r\nother basket, with R. T. on it; for those are the letters of my name,\r\nand the things in it are mine.\' Inside this, there is first a box\r\nwhich holds a common bonnet of black straw; then a coarse dark shawl;\r\nthen a gown of good common black stuff; then linen, and other things\r\nfor the under garments, that are only of the sort called second best.\r\n\'Make up all that rubbish,\' says the mistress, \'to fit me. No\r\nquestions! You have always done as I told you; do as I tell you now,\r\nor you are a lost woman.\' When the rubbish is made up, she tries it\r\non, and looks in the glass, and laughs in a way that is wild and\r\ndesperate to hear. \'Do I make a fine, buxom, comely servant-woman?\'\r\nshe says. \'Ha! but I have acted that part times enough in my past days\r\non the theatre-scene.\' And then she takes off the clothes again, and\r\nbids Sarah pack them up at once in one trunk, and pack the things she\r\nhas made for herself in another. \'The doctor orders me to go away out\r\nof this damp, soft Cornwall climate, to where the air is fresh and dry\r\nand cheerful-keen,\' she says, and laughs again, till the room rings\r\nwith it. At the same time Sarah begins to pack, and takes some\r\nknickknack things off the table, and among them a brooch which has on\r\nit a likeness of the sea-captain\'s face. The mistress sees her, turns\r\nwhite in the cheeks, trembles all over, snatches the brooch away, and\r\nlocks it up in the cabinet in a great hurry, as if the look of it\r\nfrightened her. \'I shall leave that behind me,\' she says, and turns\r\nround on her heel, and goes quickly out of the room. You guess now\r\nwhat the thing was that Mistress Treverton had it in her mind to do?"\r\n\r\nHe addressed the question to Rosamond first, and then repeated it to\r\nLeonard. They both answered in the affirmative, and entreated him to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n"You guess?" he said. "It is more than Sarah, at that time, could do.\r\nWhat with the misery in her own mind, and the strange ways and strange\r\nwords of her mistress, the wits that were in her were all confused.\r\nNevertheless, what her mistress has said to her, that she has always\r\ndone; and together alone those two from the house of Porthgenna drive\r\naway. Not a word says the mistress till they have got to the journey\'s\r\nend for the first day, and are stopping at their inn among strangers\r\nfor the night. Then at last she speaks out. \'Put you on, Sarah, the\r\ngood linen and the good gown to-morrow,\' she says, \'but keep the\r\ncommon bonnet and the common shawl till we get into the carriage\r\nagain. I shall put on the coarse linen and the coarse gown, and keep\r\nthe good bonnet and shawl. We shall pass so the people at the inn, on\r\nour way to the carriage, without very much risk of surprising them by\r\nour change of gowns. When we are out on the road again, we can change\r\nbonnets and shawls in the carriage--and then, it is all done. You are\r\nthe married lady, Mrs. Treverton, and I am your maid who waits on you,\r\nSarah Leeson.\' At that, the glimmering on Sarah\'s mind breaks in at\r\nlast: she shakes with the fright it gives her, and all she can say is,\r\n\'Oh, mistress! for the love of Heaven, what is it you mean to do?\' \'I\r\nmean,\' the mistress answers, \'to save you, my faithful servant, from\r\ndisgrace and ruin; to prevent every penny that the captain has got\r\nfrom going to that rascal-monster, his brother, who slandered me; and,\r\nlast and most, I mean to keep my husband from going away to sea again,\r\nby making him love me as he has never loved me yet. Must I say more,\r\nyou poor, afflicted, frightened creature--or is it enough so?\' And all\r\nthat Sarah can answer, is to cry bitter tears, and to say faintly,\r\n\'No.\' \'Do you doubt,\' says the mistress, and grips her by the arm, and\r\nlooks her close in the face with fierce eyes--\'Do you doubt which is\r\nbest, to cast yourself into the world forsaken and disgraced and\r\nruined, or to save yourself from shame, and make a friend of me for\r\nthe rest of your life? You weak, wavering, baby woman, if you can not\r\ndecide for yourself, I shall for you. As I will, so it shall be!\r\nTo-morrow, and the day after that, we go on and on, up to the north,\r\nwhere my good fool of a doctor says the air is cheerful-keen--up to\r\nthe north, where nobody knows me or has heard my name. I, the maid,\r\nshall spread the report that you, the lady, are weak in your health.\r\nNo strangers shall you see, but the doctor and the nurse, when the\r\ntime to call them comes. Who they may be, I know not; but this I do\r\nknow, that the one and the other will serve our purpose without the\r\nleast suspicion of what it is; and that when we get back to Cornwall\r\nagain, the secret between us two will to no third person have been\r\ntrusted, and will remain a Dead Secret to the end of the world!\' With\r\nall the strength of the strong will that is in her, at the hush of\r\nnight and in a house of strangers, she speaks those words to the woman\r\nof all women the most frightened, the most afflicted, the most\r\nhelpless, the most ashamed. What need to say the end? On that night\r\nSarah first stooped her shoulders to the burden that has weighed\r\nheavier and heavier on them with every year, for all her after-life."\r\n\r\n"How many days did they travel toward the north?" asked Rosamond,\r\neagerly. "Where did the journey end? In England or in Scotland?"\r\n\r\n"In England," answered Uncle Joseph. "But the name of the place\r\nescapes my foreign tongue. It was a little town by the side of the\r\nsea--the great sea that washes between my country and yours. There\r\nthey stopped, and there they waited till the time came to send for the\r\ndoctor and the nurse. And as Mistress Treverton had said it should be,\r\nso, from the first to the last, it was. The doctor and the nurse, and\r\nthe people of the house were all strangers; and to this day, if they\r\nstill live, they believe that Sarah was the sea-captain\'s wife, and\r\nthat Mistress Treverton was the maid who waited on her. Not till they\r\nwere far back on their way home with the child did the two change\r\ngowns again, and return each to her proper place. The first friend at\r\nPorthgenna that the mistress sends for to show the child to, when she\r\ngets back, is the doctor who lives there. \'Did you think what was the\r\nmatter with me, when you sent me away to change the air?\' she says,\r\nand laughs. And the doctor, he laughs too, and says, \'Yes, surely! but\r\nI was too cunning to say what I thought in those early days, because,\r\nat such times, there is always fear of a mistake. And you found the\r\nfine dry air so good for you that you stopped?\' he says. \'Well, that\r\nwas right! right for yourself and right also for the child.\' And the\r\ndoctor laughs again and the mistress with him, and Sarah, who stands\r\nby and hears them, feels as if her heart would burst within her, with\r\nthe horror, and the misery, and the shame of that deceit. When the\r\ndoctor\'s back is turned, she goes down on her knees, and begs and\r\nprays with all her soul that the mistress will repent, and send her\r\naway with her child, to be heard of at Porthgenna no more. The\r\nmistress, with that tyrant-will of hers, has but four words of answer\r\nto give--\'It is too late!\' Five weeks after, the sea-captain comes\r\nback, and the \'Too late\' is a truth that no repentance can ever alter\r\nmore. The mistress\'s cunning hand that has guided the deceit from the\r\nfirst, guides it always to the last--guides it so that the captain,\r\nfor the love of her and of the child, goes back to the sea no\r\nmore--guides it till the time when she lays her down on the bed to\r\ndie, and leaves all the burden of the secret, and all the guilt of the\r\nconfession, to Sarah--to Sarah, who, under the tyranny of that\r\ntyrant-will, has lived in the house, for five long years, a stranger\r\nto her own child!"\r\n\r\n"Five years!" murmured Rosamond, raising the baby gently in her arms,\r\ntill his face touched hers. "Oh me! five long years a stranger to the\r\nblood of her blood, to the heart of her heart!"\r\n\r\n"And all the years after!" said the old man. "The lonesome years and\r\nyears among strangers, with no sight of the child that was growing up,\r\nwith no heart to pour the story of her sorrow into the ear of any\r\nliving creature, not even into mine! \'Better,\' I said to her, when she\r\ncould speak to me no more, and when her face was turned away again on\r\nthe pillow--\'a thousand times better, my child, if you had told the\r\nSecret!\' \'Could I tell it,\' she said, \'to the master who trusted me?\r\nCould I tell it afterward to the child, whose birth was a reproach to\r\nme? Could she listen to the story of her mother\'s shame, told by her\r\nmother\'s lips? How will she listen to it now, Uncle Joseph, when she\r\nhears it from _you_? Remember the life she has led, and the high place\r\nshe has held in the world. How can she forgive me? How can she ever\r\nlook at me in kindness again?\'"\r\n\r\n"You never left her," cried Rosamond, interposing before he could say\r\nmore--"surely, surely, you never left her with that thought in her\r\nheart!"\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph\'s head drooped on his breast. "What words of mine could\r\nchange it?" he asked, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lenny, do you hear that? I must leave you, and leave the baby. I\r\nmust go to her, or those last words about me will break my heart." The\r\npassionate tears burst from her eyes as she spoke; and she rose\r\nhastily from her seat, with the child in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Not to-night," said Uncle Joseph. "She said to me at parting, \'I can\r\nbear no more to-night; give me till the morning to get as strong as I\r\ncan.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, go back, then, yourself!" cried Rosamond. "Go, for God\'s sake,\r\nwithout wasting another moment, and make her think of me as she ought!\r\nTell her how I listened to you, with my own child sleeping on my bosom\r\nall the time--tell her--oh, no, no! words are too cold for it!--Come\r\nhere, come close, Uncle Joseph (I shall always call you so now); come\r\nclose to me and kiss my child--_her_ grandchild!--Kiss him on this\r\ncheek, because it has lain nearest to my heart. And now, go back, kind\r\nand dear old man--go back to her bedside, and say nothing but that _I_\r\nsent that kiss to _her_!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night, with its wakeful anxieties, wore away at last; and the\r\nmorning light dawned hopefully, for it brought with it the promise of\r\nan end to Rosamond\'s suspense.\r\n\r\nThe first event of the day was the arrival of Mr. Nixon, who had\r\nreceived a note on the previous evening, written by Leonard\'s desire,\r\nto invite him to breakfast. Before the lawyer withdrew, he had settled\r\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Frankland all the preliminary arrangements that were\r\nnecessary to effect the restoration of the purchase-money of\r\nPorthgenna Tower, and had dispatched a messenger with a letter to\r\nBayswater, announcing his intention of calling upon Andrew Treverton\r\nthat afternoon, on private business of importance relating to the\r\npersonal estate of his late brother.\r\n\r\nToward noon, Uncle Joseph arrived at the hotel to take Rosamond with\r\nhim to the house where her mother lay ill.\r\n\r\nHe came in, talking, in the highest spirits, of the wonderful change\r\nfor the better that had been wrought in his niece by the affectionate\r\nmessage which he had taken to her on the previous evening. He declared\r\nthat it had made her look happier, stronger, younger, all in a moment;\r\nthat it had given her the longest, quietest, sweetest night\'s sleep\r\nshe had enjoyed for years and years past; and, last, best triumph of\r\nall, that its good influence had been acknowledged, not an hour since,\r\nby the doctor himself.\r\n\r\nRosamond listened thankfully, but it was with a wandering attention,\r\nwith a mind ill at ease. When she had taken leave of her husband, and\r\nwhen she and Uncle Joseph were out in the street together, there was\r\nsomething in the prospect of the approaching interview between her\r\nmother and herself which, in spite of her efforts to resist the\r\nsensation, almost daunted her. If they could have come together, and\r\nhave recognized each other without time to think what should be first\r\nsaid or done on either side, the meeting would have been nothing more\r\nthan the natural result of the discovery of the Secret. But, as it\r\nwas, the waiting, the doubting, the mournful story of the past, which\r\nhad filled up the emptiness of the last day of suspense, all had their\r\ndepressing effect on Rosamond\'s impulsive disposition. Without a\r\nthought in her heart which was not tender, compassionate, and true\r\ntoward her mother, she now felt, nevertheless, a vague sense of\r\nembarrassment, which increased to positive uneasiness the nearer she\r\nand the old man drew to their short journey\'s end. As they stopped at\r\nlast at the house door, she was shocked to find herself thinking\r\nbeforehand of what first words it would be best to say, of what first\r\nthings it would be best to do, as if she had been about to visit a\r\ntotal stranger, whose favorable opinion she wished to secure, and\r\nwhose readiness to receive her cordially was a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe first person whom they saw after the door was opened was the\r\ndoctor. He advanced toward them from a little empty room at the end of\r\nthe hall, and asked permission to speak with Mrs. Frankland for a few\r\nminutes. Leaving Rosamond to her interview with the doctor, Uncle\r\nJoseph gayly ascended the stairs to tell his niece of her arrival,\r\nwith an activity which might well have been envied by many a man of\r\nhalf his years.\r\n\r\n"Is she worse? Is there any danger in my seeing her?" asked Rosamond,\r\nas the doctor led her into the empty room.\r\n\r\n"Quite the contrary," he replied. "She is much better this morning;\r\nand the improvement, I find, is mainly due to the composing and\r\ncheering influence on her mind of a message which she received from\r\nyou last night. It is the discovery of this which makes me anxious to\r\nspeak to you now on the subject of one particular symptom of her\r\nmental condition which surprised and alarmed me when I first\r\ndiscovered it, and which has perplexed me very much ever since. She is\r\nsuffering--not to detain you, and to put the matter at once in the\r\nplainest terms--under a mental hallucination of a very extraordinary\r\nkind, which, so far as I have observed it, affects her, generally,\r\ntoward the close of the day, when the light gets obscure. At such\r\ntimes, there is an expression in her eyes as if she fancied some\r\nperson had walked suddenly into the room. She looks and talks at\r\nperfect vacancy, as you or I might look or talk at some one who was\r\nreally standing and listening to us. The old man, her uncle, tells me\r\nthat he first observed this when she came to see him (in Cornwall, I\r\nthink he said) a short time since. She was speaking to him then on\r\nprivate affairs of her own, when she suddenly stopped, just as the\r\nevening was closing in, startled him by a question on the old\r\nsuperstitious subject of the re-appearance of the dead, and then,\r\nlooking away at a shadowed corner of the room, began to talk at\r\nit--exactly as I have seen her look and heard her talk up stairs.\r\nWhether she fancies that she is pursued by an apparition, or whether\r\nshe imagines that some living person enters her room at certain times,\r\nis more than I can say; and the old man gives me no help in guessing\r\nat the truth. Can you throw any light on the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I hear of it now for the first time," answered Rosamond, looking at\r\nthe doctor in amazement and alarm.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," he rejoined, "she may be more communicative with you than\r\nshe is with me. If you could manage to be by her bedside at dusk\r\nto-day or to-morrow, and if you think you are not likely to be\r\nfrightened by it, I should very much wish you to see and hear her,\r\nwhen she is under the influence of her delusion. I have tried in vain\r\nto draw her attention away from it, at the time, or to get her to\r\nspeak of it afterward. You have evidently considerable influence over\r\nher, and you might therefore succeed where I have failed. In her state\r\nof health, I attach great importance to clearing her mind of every\r\nthing that clouds and oppresses it, and especially of such a serious\r\nhallucination as that which I have been describing. If you could\r\nsucceed in combating it, you would be doing her the greatest service,\r\nand would be materially helping my efforts to improve her health. Do\r\nyou mind trying the experiment?"\r\n\r\nRosamond promised to devote herself unreservedly to this service, or\r\nto any other which was for the patient\'s good. The doctor thanked her,\r\nand led the way back into the hall again.--Uncle Joseph was descending\r\nthe stairs as they came out of the room. "She is ready and longing to\r\nsee you," he whispered in Rosamond\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I need not impress on you again the very serious necessity\r\nof keeping her composed," said the doctor, taking his leave. "It is, I\r\nassure you, no exaggeration to say that her life depends on it."\r\n\r\nRosamond bowed to him in silence, and in silence followed the old man\r\nup the stairs.\r\n\r\nAt the door of a back room on the second floor Uncle Joseph stopped.\r\n\r\n"She is there," he whispered eagerly. "I leave you to go in by\r\nyourself, for it is best that you should be alone with her at first. I\r\nshall walk about the streets in the fine warm sunshine, and think of\r\nyou both, and come back after a little. Go in; and the blessing and\r\nthe mercy of God go with you!" He lifted her hand to his lips, and\r\nsoftly and quickly descended the stairs again.\r\n\r\nRosamond stood alone before the door. A momentary tremor shook her\r\nfrom head to foot as she stretched out her hand to knock at it. The\r\nsame sweet voice that she had last heard in her bedroom at West\r\nWinston answered her now. As its tones fell on her ear, a thought of\r\nher child stole quietly into her heart, and stilled its quick\r\nthrobbing. She opened the door at once and went in.\r\n\r\nNeither the look of the room inside, nor the view from the window;\r\nneither its characteristic ornaments, nor its prominent pieces of\r\nfurniture; none of the objects in it or about it, which would have\r\ncaught her quick observation at other times, struck it now. From the\r\nmoment when she opened the door, she saw nothing but the pillows of\r\nthe bed, the head resting on them, and the face turned toward hers. As\r\nshe stepped across the threshold, that face changed; the eyelids\r\ndrooped a little, and the pale cheeks were tinged suddenly with\r\nburning red.\r\n\r\nWas her mother ashamed to look at her?\r\n\r\nThe bare doubt freed Rosamond in an instant from all the\r\nself-distrust, all the embarrassment, all the hesitation about\r\nchoosing her words and directing her actions which had fettered her\r\ngenerous impulses up to this time. She ran to the bed, raised the\r\nworn, shrinking figure in her arms, and laid the poor weary head\r\ngently on her warm, young bosom. "I have come at last, mother, to take\r\nmy turn at nursing you," she said. Her heart swelled as those simple\r\nwords came from it--her eyes overflowed--she could say no more.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry!" murmured the faint, sweet voice timidly. "I have no right\r\nto bring you here and make you sorry. Don\'t, don\'t cry!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush! hush! I shall do nothing but cry if you talk to me like\r\nthat!" said Rosamond. "Let us forget that we have ever been\r\nparted--call me by my name--speak to me as I shall speak to my own\r\nchild, if God spares me to see him grow up. Say \'Rosamond,\' and--oh,\r\npray, pray--tell me to do something for you!" She tore asunder\r\npassionately the strings of her bonnet, and threw it from her on the\r\nnearest chair. "Look! here is your glass of lemonade on the table. Say\r\n\'Rosamond, bring me my lemonade!\' say it familiarly, mother! say it as\r\nif you knew that I was bound to obey you!"\r\n\r\nShe repeated the words after her daughter, but still not in steady\r\ntones--repeated them with a sad, wondering smile, and with a lingering\r\nof the voice on the name of Rosamond, as if it was a luxury to her to\r\nutter it.\r\n\r\n"You made me so happy with that message and with the kiss you sent me\r\nfrom your child," she said, when Rosamond had given her the lemonade,\r\nand was seated quietly by the bedside again. "It was such a kind way\r\nof saying that you pardoned me! It gave me all the courage I wanted to\r\nspeak to you as I am speaking now. Perhaps my illness has changed\r\nme--but I don\'t feel frightened and strange with you, as I thought I\r\nshould, at our first meeting after you knew the Secret. I think I\r\nshall soon get well enough to see your child. Is he like what you were\r\nat his age? If he is, he must be very, very--" She stopped. "I may\r\nthink of that," she added, after waiting a little, "but I had better\r\nnot talk of it, or I shall cry too; and I want to have done with\r\nsorrow now."\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke those words, while her eyes were fixed with wistful\r\neagerness on her daughter\'s face, the whole instinct of neatness was\r\nstill mechanically at work in her weak, wasted fingers. Rosamond had\r\ntossed her gloves from her on the bed but the minute before; and\r\nalready her mother had taken them up, and was smoothing them out\r\ncarefully and folding them neatly together, all the while she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Call me \'mother\' again," she said, as Rosamond took the gloves from\r\nher and thanked her with a kiss for folding them up. "I have never\r\nheard you call me \'mother\' till now--never, never till now, from the\r\nday when you were born!"\r\n\r\nRosamond checked the tears that were rising in her eyes again, and\r\nrepeated the word.\r\n\r\n"It is all the happiness I want, to lie here and look at you, and hear\r\nyou say that! Is there any other woman in the world, my love, who has\r\na face so beautiful and so kind as yours?" She paused and smiled\r\nfaintly. "I can\'t look at those sweet rosy lips now," she said,\r\n"without thinking how many kisses they owe me!"\r\n\r\n"If you had only let me pay the debt before!" said Rosamond, taking\r\nher mother\'s hand, as she was accustomed to take her child\'s, and\r\nplacing it on her neck. "If you had only spoken the first time we met,\r\nwhen you came to nurse me! How sorrowfully I have thought of that\r\nsince! Oh, mother, did I distress you much in my ignorance? Did it\r\nmake you cry when you thought of me after that?"\r\n\r\n"Distress me! All my distress, Rosamond, has been of my own making,\r\nnot of yours. My kind, thoughtful love! you said, \'Don\'t be hard on\r\nher\'--do you remember? When I was being sent away, deservedly sent\r\naway, dear, for frightening you, you said to your husband, \'Don\'t be\r\nhard on her!\' Only five words--but, oh, what a comfort it was to me\r\nafterward to think that you had said them! I did want to kiss you so,\r\nRosamond, when I was brushing your hair. I had such a hard fight of it\r\nto keep from crying out loud when I heard you, behind the\r\nbed-curtains, wishing your little child good-night. My heart was in my\r\nmouth, choking me all that time. I took your part afterward, when I\r\nwent back to my mistress--I wouldn\'t hear her say a harsh word of you.\r\nI could have looked a hundred mistresses in the face then, and\r\ncontradicted them all. Oh, no, no, no! you never distressed me. My\r\nworst grief at going away was years and years before I came to nurse\r\nyou at West Winston. It was when I left my place at Porthgenna; when I\r\nstole into your nursery on that dreadful morning, and when I saw you\r\nwith both your little arms round my master\'s neck. The doll you had\r\ntaken to bed with you was in one of your hands, and your head was\r\nresting on the Captain\'s bosom, just as mine rests now--oh, so\r\nhappily, Rosamond!--on yours. I heard the last words he was speaking\r\nto you--words you were too young to remember. \'Hush! Rosie, dear,\' he\r\nsaid, \'don\'t cry any more for poor mamma. Think of poor papa, and try\r\nto comfort him!\' There, my love--there was the bitterest distress and\r\nthe hardest to bear! I, your own mother, standing like a spy, and\r\nhearing him say that to the child I dared not own! \'Think of poor\r\npapa!\' My own Rosamond! you know, now, what father _I_ thought of when\r\nhe said those words! How could I tell him the Secret? how could I give\r\nhim the letter, with his wife dead that morning--with nobody but you\r\nto comfort him--with the awful truth crushing down upon my heart, at\r\nevery word he spoke, as heavily as ever the rock crushed down upon the\r\nfather you never saw!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of it now!" said Rosamond. "Don\'t let us refer again to\r\nthe past: I know all I ought to know, all I wish to know of it. We\r\nwill talk of the future, mother, and of happier times to come. Let me\r\ntell you about my husband. If any words can praise him as he ought to\r\nbe praised, and thank him as he ought to be thanked, I am sure mine\r\nought--I am sure yours will! Let me tell you what he said and what he\r\ndid when I read to him the letter that I found in the Myrtle Room.\r\nYes, yes, do let me!"\r\n\r\nWarned by a remembrance of the doctor\'s last injunctions; trembling in\r\nsecret, as she felt under her hand the heavy, toilsome, irregular\r\nheaving of her mother\'s heart, as she saw the rapid changes of color,\r\nfrom pale to red, and from red to pale again, that fluttered across\r\nher mother\'s face, she resolved to let no more words pass between them\r\nwhich were of a nature to recall painfully the sorrows and the\r\nsuffering of the years that were gone. After describing the interview\r\nbetween her husband and herself which ended in the disclosure of the\r\nSecret, she led her mother, with compassionate abruptness, to speak of\r\nthe future, of the time when she would be able to travel again, of the\r\nhappiness of returning together to Cornwall, of the little festival\r\nthey might hold on arriving at Uncle Joseph\'s house in Truro, and of\r\nthe time after that, when they might go on still farther to\r\nPorthgenna, or perhaps to some other place where new scenes and new\r\nfaces might help them to forget all sad associations which it was best\r\nto think of no more.\r\n\r\nRosamond was still speaking on these topics, her mother was still\r\nlistening to her with growing interest in every word that she said,\r\nwhen Uncle Joseph returned. He brought in with him a basket of\r\nflowers and a basket of fruit, which he held up in triumph at the foot\r\nof his niece\'s bed.\r\n\r\n"I have been walking about, my child, in the fine bright sunshine," he\r\nsaid, "and waiting to give your face plenty of time to look happy, so\r\nthat I might see it again as I want to see it always, for the rest of\r\nmy life. Aha, Sarah! it is I who have brought the right doctor to cure\r\nyou!" he added gayly, looking at Rosamond. "She has made you better\r\nalready. Wait but a little while longer, and she shall get you up from\r\nyour bed again, with your two cheeks as red, and your heart as light,\r\nand your tongue as fast to chatter as mine. See the fine flowers and\r\nthe fruit I have bought that is nice to your eyes, and nice to your\r\nnose, and nicest of all to put into your mouth! It is festival-time\r\nwith us to-day, and we must make the room bright, bright, bright, all\r\nover. And then, there is your dinner to come soon; I have seen it on\r\nthe dish--a cherub among chicken-fowls! And, after that, there is your\r\nfine sound sleep, with Mozart to sing the cradle song, and with me to\r\nsit for watch, and to go down stairs when you wake up again, and fetch\r\nyour cup of tea. Ah, my child, my child, what a fine thing it is to\r\nhave come at last to this festival-day!"\r\n\r\nWith a bright look at Rosamond, and with both his hands full of\r\nflowers, he turned away from his niece to begin decorating the room.\r\nExcept when she thanked the old man for the presents he had brought,\r\nher attention had never wandered, all the while he had been speaking,\r\nfrom her daughter\'s face; and her first words, when he was silent\r\nagain, were addressed to Rosamond alone.\r\n\r\n"While I am happy with _my_ child," she said, "I am keeping you from\r\n_yours_. I, of all persons, ought to be the last to part you from each\r\nother too long. Go back now, my love, to your husband and your child;\r\nand leave me to my grateful thoughts and my dreams of better times."\r\n\r\n"If you please, answer Yes to that, for your mother\'s sake," said\r\nUncle Joseph, before Rosamond could reply. "The doctor says she must\r\ntake her repose in the day as well as her repose in the night. And how\r\nshall I get her to close her eyes, so long as she has the temptation\r\nto keep them open upon _you_?"\r\n\r\nRosamond felt the truth of those last words, and consented to go back\r\nfor a few hours to the hotel, on the understanding that she was to\r\nresume her place at the bedside in the evening. After making this\r\narrangement, she waited long enough in the room to see the meal\r\nbrought up which Uncle Joseph had announced, and to aid the old man in\r\nencouraging her mother to partake of it. When the tray had been\r\nremoved, and when the pillows of the bed had been comfortably arranged\r\nby her own hands, she at last prevailed on herself to take leave.\r\n\r\nHer mother\'s arms lingered round her neck; her mother\'s cheek nestled\r\nfondly against hers. "Go, my dear, go now, or I shall get too selfish\r\nto part with you even for a few hours," murmured the sweet voice, in\r\nthe lowest, softest tones. "My own Rosamond! I have no words to bless\r\nyou that are good enough; no words to thank you that will speak as\r\ngratefully for me as they ought! Happiness has been long in reaching\r\nme--but, oh, how mercifully it has come at last!"\r\n\r\nBefore she passed the door, Rosamond stopped and looked back into the\r\nroom. The table, the mantel-piece, the little framed prints on the\r\nwall were bright with flowers; the musical box was just playing the\r\nfirst sweet notes of the air from Mozart; Uncle Joseph was seated\r\nalready in his accustomed place by the bed, with the basket of fruit\r\non his knees; the pale, worn face on the pillow was tenderly lighted\r\nup by a smile; peace and comfort and repose, all mingled together\r\nhappily in the picture of the sick-room, all joined in leading\r\nRosamond\'s thoughts to dwell quietly on the hope of a happier time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree hours passed. The last glory of the sun was lighting the long\r\nsummer day to its rest in the western heaven, when Rosamond returned\r\nto her mother\'s bedside.\r\n\r\nShe entered the room softly. The one window in it looked toward the\r\nwest, and on that side of the bed the chair was placed which Uncle\r\nJoseph had occupied when she left him, and in which she now found him\r\nstill seated on her return. He raised his fingers to his lips, and\r\nlooked toward the bed, as she opened the door. Her mother was asleep,\r\nwith her hand resting in the hand of the old man.\r\n\r\nAs Rosamond noiselessly advanced, she saw that Uncle Joseph\'s eyes\r\nlooked dim and weary. The constraint of the position that he occupied,\r\nwhich made it impossible for him to move without the risk of awakening\r\nhis niece, seemed to be beginning to fatigue him. Rosamond removed her\r\nbonnet and shawl, and made a sign to him to rise and let her take his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" she whispered, seeing him reply by a shake of the head.\r\n"Let me take my turn, while you go out a little and enjoy the cool\r\nevening air. There is no fear of waking her; her hand is not clasping\r\nyours, but only resting in it--let me steal mine into its place\r\ngently, and we shall not disturb her."\r\n\r\nShe slipped her hand under her mother\'s while she spoke. Uncle Joseph\r\nsmiled as he rose from his chair, and resigned his place to her. "You\r\nwill have your way," he said; "you are too quick and sharp for an old\r\nman like me."\r\n\r\n"Has she been long asleep?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Nearly two hours," answered Uncle Joseph. "But it has not been the\r\ngood sleep I wanted for her--a dreaming, talking, restless sleep. It\r\nis only ten little minutes since she has been so quiet as you see her\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Surely you let in too much light?" whispered Rosamond, looking round\r\nat the window, through which the glow of the evening sky poured warmly\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he hastily rejoined. "Asleep or awake, she always wants the\r\nlight. If I go away for a little while, as you tell me, and if it gets\r\non to be dusk before I come back, light both those candles on the\r\nchimney-piece. I shall try to be here again before that; but if the\r\ntime slips by too fast for me, and if it so happens that she wakes and\r\ntalks strangely, and looks much away from you into that far corner of\r\nthe room there, remember that the matches and the candles are together\r\non the chimney-piece, and that the sooner you light them after the dim\r\ntwilight-time, the better it will be." With those words he stole on\r\ntiptoe to the door and went out.\r\n\r\nHis parting directions recalled Rosamond to a remembrance of what had\r\npassed between the doctor and herself that morning. She looked round\r\nagain anxiously to the window.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just sinking beyond the distant house-tops; the close of\r\nday was not far off.\r\n\r\nAs she turned her head once more toward the bed, a momentary chill\r\ncrept over her. She trembled a little, partly at the sensation itself,\r\npartly at the recollection it aroused of that other chill which had\r\nstruck her in the solitude of the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\nStirred by the mysterious sympathies of touch, her mother\'s hand at\r\nthe same instant moved in hers, and over the sad peacefulness of the\r\nweary face there fluttered a momentary trouble--the flying shadow of a\r\ndream. The pale, parted lips opened, closed, quivered, opened again;\r\nthe toiling breath came and went quickly and more quickly; the head\r\nmoved uneasily on the pillow; the eyelids half unclosed themselves;\r\nlow, faint, moaning sounds poured rapidly from the lips--changed ere\r\nlong to half-articulated sentences--then merged softly into\r\nintelligible speech, and uttered these words:\r\n\r\n"Swear that you will not destroy this paper! Swear that you will not\r\ntake this paper away with you if you leave the house!"\r\n\r\nThe words that followed these were whispered so rapidly and so low\r\nthat Rosamond\'s ear failed to catch them. They were followed by a\r\nshort silence. Then the dreaming voice spoke again suddenly, and spoke\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\n"Where? where? where?" it said. "In the book-case? In the\r\ntable-drawer?--Stop! stop! In the picture of the ghost--"\r\n\r\nThe last words struck cold on Rosamond\'s heart. She drew back suddenly\r\nwith a movement of alarm--checked herself the instant after, and bent\r\ndown over the pillow again. But it was too late. Her hand had moved\r\nabruptly when she drew back, and her mother awoke with a start and a\r\nfaint cry--with vacant, terror-stricken eyes, and with the\r\nperspiration standing thick on her forehead.\r\n\r\n"Mother!" cried Rosamond, raising her on the pillow. "I have come\r\nback. Don\'t you know me?"\r\n\r\n"Mother?" she repeated, in mournful, questioning tones--"Mother?" At\r\nthe second repetition of the word a bright flush of delight and\r\nsurprise broke out on her face, and she clasped both arms suddenly\r\nround her daughter\'s neck. "Oh, my own Rosamond!" she said. "If I had\r\never been used to waking up and seeing your dear face look at me, I\r\nshould have known you sooner, in spite of my dream! Did you wake me,\r\nmy love? or did I wake myself?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I awoke you, mother."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say \'afraid.\' I would wake from the sweetest sleep that ever\r\nwoman had to see your face and to hear you say \'mother\' to me. You\r\nhave delivered me, my love, from the terror of one of my dreadful\r\ndreams. Oh, Rosamond! I think I should live to be happy in your love,\r\nif I could only get Porthgenna Tower out of my mind--if I could only\r\nnever remember again the bed-chamber where my mistress died, and the\r\nroom where I hid the letter--"\r\n\r\n"We will try and forget Porthgenna Tower now," said Rosamond. "Shall\r\nwe talk about other places where I have lived, which you have never\r\nseen? Or shall I read to you, mother? Have you got any book here that\r\nyou are fond of?"\r\n\r\nShe looked across the bed at the table on the other side. There was\r\nnothing on it but some bottles of medicine, a few of Uncle Joseph\'s\r\nflowers in a glass of water, and a little oblong work-box. She looked\r\nround at the chest of drawers behind her--there were no books placed\r\non the top of it. Before she turned toward the bed again, her eyes\r\nwandered aside to the window. The sun was lost beyond the distant\r\nhouse-tops; the close of day was near at hand.\r\n\r\n"If I could forget! Oh, me, if I could only forget!" said her mother,\r\nsighing wearily, and beating her hand on the coverlid of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Are you well enough, dear, to amuse yourself with work?" asked\r\nRosamond, pointing to the little oblong box on the table, and trying\r\nto lead the conversation to a harmless, every-day topic, by asking\r\nquestions about it. "What work do you do? May I look at it?"\r\n\r\nHer face lost its weary, suffering look, and brightened once more into\r\na smile. "There is no work there," she said. "All the treasures I had\r\nin the world, till you came to see me, are shut up in that one little\r\nbox. Open it, my love, and look inside."\r\n\r\nRosamond obeyed, placing the box on the bed where her mother could see\r\nit easily. The first object that she discovered inside was a little\r\nbook, in dark, worn binding. It was an old copy of Wesley\'s Hymns.\r\nSome withered blades of grass lay between its pages; and on one of its\r\nblank leaves was this inscription--"Sarah Leeson, her book. The gift\r\nof Hugh Polwheal."\r\n\r\n"Look at it, my dear," said her mother. "I want you to know it again.\r\nWhen my time comes to leave you, Rosamond, lay it on my bosom with\r\nyour own dear hands, and put a little morsel of your hair with it, and\r\nbury me in the grave in Porthgenna church-yard, where _he_ has been\r\nwaiting for me to come to him so many weary years. The other things in\r\nthe box, Rosamond, belong to you; they are little stolen keepsakes\r\nthat used to remind me of my child, when I was alone in the world.\r\nPerhaps, years and years hence, when your brown hair begins to grow\r\ngray like mine, you may like to show these poor trifles to your\r\nchildren when you talk about me. Don\'t mind telling them, Rosamond,\r\nhow your mother sinned and how she suffered--you can always let these\r\nlittle trifles speak for her at the end. The least of them will show\r\nthat she always loved you."\r\n\r\nShe took out of the box a morsel of neatly folded white paper, which\r\nhad been placed under the book of Wesley\'s Hymns, opened it, and\r\nshowed her daughter a few faded laburnum leaves that lay inside. "I\r\ntook these from your bed, Rosamond, when I came, as a stranger, to\r\nnurse you at West Winston. I tried to take a ribbon out of your trunk,\r\nlove, after I had taken the flowers--a ribbon that I knew had been\r\nround your neck. But the doctor came near at the time, and frightened\r\nme."\r\n\r\nShe folded the paper up again, laid it aside on the table, and drew\r\nfrom the box next a small print which had been taken from the\r\nillustrations to a pocket-book. It represented a little girl, in\r\ngypsy-hat, sitting by the water-side, and weaving a daisy chain. As a\r\ndesign, it was worthless; as a print, it had not even the mechanical\r\nmerit of being a good impression. Underneath it a line was written in\r\nfaintly pencilled letters--"Rosamond when I last saw her."\r\n\r\n"It was never pretty enough for you," she said. "But still there was\r\nsomething in it that helped me to remember what my own love was like\r\nwhen she was a little girl."\r\n\r\nShe put the engraving aside with the laburnum leaves, and took from\r\nthe box a leaf of a copy-book, folded in two, out of which there\r\ndropped a tiny strip of paper, covered with small printed letters. She\r\nlooked at the strip of paper first. "The advertisement of your\r\nmarriage, Rosamond," she said. "I used to be fond of reading it over\r\nand over again to myself when I was alone, and trying to fancy how\r\nyou looked and what dress you wore. If I had only known when you were\r\ngoing to be married, I would have ventured into the church, my love,\r\nto look at you and at your husband. But that was not to be--and\r\nperhaps it was best so, for the seeing you in that stolen way might\r\nonly have made my trials harder to bear afterward. I have had no other\r\nkeepsake to remind me of you, Rosamond, except this leaf out of your\r\nfirst copy-book. The nurse-maid at Porthgenna tore up the rest one day\r\nto light the fire, and I took this leaf when she was not looking. See!\r\nyou had not got as far as words then--you could only do up-strokes and\r\ndown-strokes. Oh me! how many times I have sat looking at this one\r\nleaf of paper, and trying to fancy that I saw your small child\'s hand\r\ntraveling over it, with the pen held tight in the rosy little fingers.\r\nI think I have cried oftener, my darling, over that first copy of\r\nyours than over all my other keepsakes put together."\r\n\r\nRosamond turned aside her face toward the window to hide the tears\r\nwhich she could restrain no longer.\r\n\r\nAs she wiped them away, the first sight of the darkening sky warned\r\nher that the twilight dimness was coming soon. How dull and faint the\r\nglow in the west looked now! how near it was to the close of day!\r\n\r\nWhen she turned toward the bed again, her mother was still looking at\r\nthe leaf of the copy-book.\r\n\r\n"That nurse-maid who tore up all the rest of it to light the fire,"\r\nshe said, "was a kind friend to me in those early days at Porthgenna.\r\nShe used sometimes to let me put you to bed, Rosamond; and never asked\r\nquestions, or teased me, as the rest of them did. She risked the loss\r\nof her place by being so good to me. My mistress was afraid of my\r\nbetraying myself and betraying her if I was much in the nursery, and\r\nshe gave orders that I was not to go there, because it was not my\r\nplace. None of the other women-servants were so often stopped from\r\nplaying with you and kissing you, Rosamond, as I was. But the\r\nnurse-maid--God bless and prosper her for it!--stood my friend. I\r\noften lifted you into your little cot, my love, and wished you\r\ngood-night, when my mistress thought I was at work in her room. You\r\nused to say you liked your nurse better than you liked me, but you\r\nnever told me so fretfully; and you always put your laughing lips up\r\nto mine whenever I asked you for a kiss!"\r\n\r\nRosamond laid her head gently on the pillow by the side of her\r\nmother\'s. "Try to think less of the past, dear, and more of the\r\nfuture," she whispered pleadingly; "try to think of the time when my\r\nchild will help you to recall those old days without their sorrow--the\r\ntime when you will teach him to put his lips up to yours, as I used to\r\nput mine."\r\n\r\n"I will try, Rosamond--but my only thoughts of the future, for years\r\nand years past, have been thoughts of meeting you in heaven. If my\r\nsins are forgiven, how shall we meet there? Shall you be like my\r\nlittle child to me--the child I never saw again after she was five\r\nyears old? I wonder if the mercy of God will recompense me for our\r\nlong separation on earth? I wonder if you will first appear to me in\r\nthe happy world with your child\'s face, and be what you should have\r\nbeen to me on earth, my little angel that I can carry in my arms? If\r\nwe pray in heaven, shall I teach you your prayers there, as some\r\ncomfort to me for never having taught them to you here?"\r\n\r\nShe paused, smiled sadly, and, closing her eyes, gave herself in\r\nsilence to the dream-thoughts that were still floating in her mind.\r\nThinking that she might sink to rest again if she was left\r\nundisturbed, Rosamond neither moved nor spoke. After watching the\r\npeaceful face for some time, she became conscious that the light was\r\nfading on it slowly. As that conviction impressed itself on her, she\r\nlooked round at the window once more.\r\n\r\nThe western clouds wore their quiet twilight colors already: the close\r\nof day had come.\r\n\r\nThe moment she moved the chair, she felt her mother\'s hand on her\r\nshoulder. When she turned again toward the bed, she saw her mother\'s\r\neyes open and looking at her--looking at her, as she thought, with a\r\nchange in their expression, a change to vacancy.\r\n\r\n"Why do I talk of heaven?" she said, turning her face suddenly toward\r\nthe darkening sky, and speaking in low, muttering tones. "How do I\r\nknow I am fit to go there? And yet, Rosamond, I am not guilty of\r\nbreaking my oath to my mistress. You can say for me that I never\r\ndestroyed the letter, and that I never took it away with me when I\r\nleft the house. I tried to get it out of the Myrtle Room; but I only\r\nwanted to hide it somewhere else. I never thought to take it away from\r\nthe house: I never meant to break my oath."\r\n\r\n"It will be dark soon, mother. Let me get up for one moment to light\r\nthe candles."\r\n\r\nHer hand crept softly upward, and clung fast round Rosamond\'s neck.\r\n\r\n"I never swore to give him the letter," she said. "There was no crime\r\nin the hiding of it. You found it in a picture, Rosamond? They used to\r\ncall it a picture of the Porthgenna ghost. Nobody knew how old it was,\r\nor when it came into the house. My mistress hated it, because the\r\npainted face had a strange likeness to hers. She told me, when first I\r\nlived at Porthgenna, to take it down from the wall and destroy it. I\r\nwas afraid to do that; so I hid it away, before ever you were born, in\r\nthe Myrtle Room. You found the letter at the back of the picture,\r\nRosamond? And yet that was a likely place to hide it in. Nobody had\r\never found the picture. Why should any body find the letter that was\r\nhid in it?"\r\n\r\n"Let me get a light, mother! I am sure you would like to have a\r\nlight!"\r\n\r\n"No! no light now. Give the darkness time to gather down there in the\r\ncorner of the room. Lift me up close to you, and let me whisper."\r\n\r\nThe clinging arm tightened its grasp as Rosamond raised her in the\r\nbed. The fading light from the window fell full on her face, and was\r\nreflected dimly in her vacant eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am waiting for something that comes at dusk, before the candles are\r\nlit," she whispered in low, breathless tones. "My mistress!--down\r\nthere!" And she pointed away to the farthest corner of the room near\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Mother! for God\'s sake, what is it! what has changed you so?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right! say \'mother.\' _If she does come_, she can\'t stop when\r\nshe hears you call me \'mother,\' when she sees us together at last,\r\nloving and knowing each other in spite of her. Oh, my kind, tender,\r\npitying child! if you can only deliver me from her, how long may I\r\nlive yet!--how happy we may both be!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk so! don\'t look so! Tell me quietly--dear, dear mother,\r\ntell me quietly--"\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! I am going to tell you. She threatened me on her\r\ndeath-bed, if I thwarted her--she said she would come to me from the\r\nother world. Rosamond! I _have_ thwarted her and she has kept her\r\npromise--all my life since, she has kept her promise! Look! Down\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nHer left arm was still clasped round Rosamond\'s neck. She stretched\r\nher right arm out toward the far corner of the room, and shook her\r\nhand slowly at the empty air.\r\n\r\n"Look!" she said. "There she is as she always comes to me at the close\r\nof day--with the coarse, black dress on, that my guilty hands made for\r\nher--with the smile that there was on her face when she asked me if\r\nshe looked like a servant. Mistress! mistress! Oh, rest at last! the\r\nSecret is ours no longer! Rest at last! my child is my own again!\r\nRest, at last; and come between us no more!"\r\n\r\nShe ceased, panting for breath; and laid her hot, throbbing cheek\r\nagainst the cheek of her daughter. "Call me \'mother\' again!" she\r\nwhispered. "Say it loud; and send her away from me forever!"\r\n\r\nRosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb, and\r\npronounced the word.\r\n\r\nHer mother leaned forward a little, still gasping heavily for breath,\r\nand looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the\r\nlower end of the room.\r\n\r\n"_Gone!!!_" she cried suddenly, with a scream of exultation. "Oh,\r\nmerciful, merciful God! gone at last!"\r\n\r\nThe next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed. For one awful\r\nmoment her eyes shone in the gray twilight with a radiant, unearthly\r\nbeauty, as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughter\'s\r\nface. "Oh, my love! my angel!" she murmured, "how happy we shall be\r\ntogether now!" As she said the words, she twined her arms round\r\nRosamond\'s neck, and pressed her lips rapturously on the lips of her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on Rosamond\'s\r\nbosom--lingered, till the time of God\'s mercy came, and the weary\r\nheart rested at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFORTY THOUSAND POUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo popular saying is more commonly accepted than the maxim which\r\nasserts that Time is the great consoler; and, probably, no popular\r\nsaying more imperfectly expresses the truth. The work that we must do,\r\nthe responsibilities that we must undertake, the example that we must\r\nset to others--these are the great consolers, for these apply the\r\nfirst remedies to the malady of grief. Time possesses nothing but the\r\nnegative virtue of helping it to wear itself out. Who that has\r\nobserved at all, has not perceived that those among us who soonest\r\nrecover from the shock of a great grief for the dead are those who\r\nhave the most duties to perform toward the living? When the shadow of\r\ncalamity rests on our houses, the question with us is not how much\r\ntime will suffice to bring back the sunshine to us again, but how much\r\noccupation have we got to force us forward into the place where the\r\nsunshine is waiting for us to come? Time may claim many victories, but\r\nnot the victory over grief. The great consolation for the loss of the\r\ndead who are gone is to be found in the great necessity of thinking of\r\nthe living who remain.\r\n\r\nThe history of Rosamond\'s daily life, now that the darkness of a heavy\r\naffliction had fallen on it, was in itself the sufficient illustration\r\nof this truth. It was not the slow lapse of time that helped to raise\r\nher up again, but the necessity which would not wait for time--the\r\nnecessity which made her remember what was due to the husband who\r\nsorrowed with her, to the child whose young life was linked to hers,\r\nand to the old man whose helpless grief found no support but in the\r\ncomfort she could give, learned no lesson of resignation but from the\r\nexample she could set.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the responsibility of sustaining him had rested on her\r\nshoulders alone. Before the close of day had been counted out by the\r\nfirst hour of the night, she had been torn from the bedside by the\r\nnecessity of meeting him at the door, and preparing him to know that\r\nhe was entering the chamber of death. To guide the dreadful truth\r\ngradually and gently, till it stood face to face with him, to support\r\nhim under the shock of recognizing it, to help his mind to recover\r\nafter the inevitable blow had struck it at last--these were the sacred\r\nduties which claimed all the devotion that Rosamond had to give, and\r\nwhich forbade her heart, for his sake, to dwell selfishly on its own\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nHe looked like a man whose faculties had been stunned past recovery.\r\nHe would sit for hours with the musical box by his side, patting it\r\nabsently from time to time, and whispering to himself as he looked at\r\nit, but never attempting to set it playing. It was the one memorial\r\nleft that reminded him of all the joys and sorrows, the simple family\r\ninterests and affections of his past life. When Rosamond first sat by\r\nhis side and took his hand to comfort him, he looked backward and\r\nforward with forlorn eyes from her compassionate face to the musical\r\nbox, and vacantly repeated to himself the same words over and over\r\nagain: "They are all gone--my brother Max, my wife, my little Joseph,\r\nmy sister Agatha, and Sarah, my niece! I and my little bit of box are\r\nleft alone together in the world. Mozart can sing no more. He has sung\r\nto the last of them now!"\r\n\r\nThe second day there was no change in him. On the third, Rosamond\r\nplaced the book of Hymns reverently on her mother\'s bosom, laid a lock\r\nof her own hair round it, and kissed the sad, peaceful face for the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\nThe old man was with her at that silent leave-taking, and followed her\r\naway when it was over. By the side of the coffin, and afterward, when\r\nshe took him back with her to her husband, he was still sunk in the\r\nsame apathy of grief which had overwhelmed him from the first. But\r\nwhen they began to speak of the removal of the remains the next day to\r\nPorthgenna church-yard, they noticed that his dim eyes brightened\r\nsuddenly, and that his wandering attention followed every word they\r\nsaid. After a while he rose from his chair, approached Rosamond, and\r\nlooked anxiously in her face. "I think I could bear it better if you\r\nwould let me go with her," he said. "We two should have gone back to\r\nCornwall together, if she had lived. Will you let us still go back\r\ntogether now that she has died?"\r\n\r\nRosamond gently remonstrated, and tried to make him see that it was\r\nbest to leave the remains to be removed under the charge of her\r\nhusband\'s servant, whose fidelity could be depended on, and whose\r\nposition made him the fittest person to be charged with cares and\r\nresponsibilities which near relations were not capable of undertaking\r\nwith sufficient composure. She told him that her husband intended to\r\nstop in London, to give her one day of rest and quiet, which she\r\nabsolutely needed, and that they then proposed to return to Cornwall\r\nin time to be at Porthgenna before the funeral took place; and she\r\nbegged earnestly that he would not think of separating his lot from\r\ntheirs at a time of trouble and trial, when they ought to be all three\r\nmost closely united by the ties of mutual sympathy and mutual sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe listened silently and submissively while Rosamond was speaking, but\r\nhe only repeated his simple petition when she had done. The one idea\r\nin his mind now was the idea of going back to Cornwall with all that\r\nwas left on earth of his sister\'s child. Leonard and Rosamond both saw\r\nthat it would be useless to oppose it, both felt that it would be\r\ncruelty to keep him with them, and kindness to let him go away. After\r\nprivately charging the servant to spare him all trouble and\r\ndifficulty, to humor him by acceding to any wishes that he might\r\nexpress, and to give him all possible protection and help without\r\nobtruding either officiously on his attention, they left him free to\r\nfollow the one purpose of his heart which still connected him with the\r\ninterests and events of the passing day. "I shall thank you better\r\nsoon," he said at leave-taking, "for letting me go away out of this\r\ndin of London with all that is left to me of Sarah, my niece. I will\r\ndry up my tears as well as I can, and try to have more courage when we\r\nmeet again."\r\n\r\nOn the next day, when they were alone, Rosamond and her husband sought\r\nrefuge from the oppression of the present in speaking together of the\r\nfuture, and of the influence which the change in their fortunes ought\r\nto be allowed to exercise on their plans and projects for the time to\r\ncome. After exhausting this topic, the conversation turned next on the\r\nsubject of their friends, and on the necessity of communicating to\r\nsome of the oldest of their associates the events which had followed\r\nthe discovery in the Myrtle Room.\r\n\r\nThe first name on their lips while they were considering this question\r\nwas the name of Doctor Chennery; and Rosamond, dreading the effect on\r\nher spirits of allowing her mind to remain unoccupied, volunteered to\r\nwrite to the vicar at once, referring briefly to what had happened\r\nsince they had last communicated with him, and asking him to fulfill\r\nthat year an engagement of long standing, which he had made with her\r\nhusband and herself, to spend his autumn holiday with them at\r\nPorthgenna Tower. Rosamond\'s heart yearned for a sight of her old\r\nfriend; and she knew him well enough to be assured that a hint at the\r\naffliction which had befallen her, and at the hard trial which she had\r\nundergone, would be more than enough to bring them together the moment\r\nDoctor Chennery could make his arrangements for leaving home.\r\n\r\nThe writing of this letter suggested recollections which called to\r\nmind another friend, whose intimacy with Leonard and Rosamond was of\r\nrecent date, but whose connection with the earlier among the train of\r\ncircumstances which had led to the discovery of the Secret entitled\r\nhim to a certain share in their confidence. This friend was Mr.\r\nOrridge, the doctor at West Winston, who had accidentally been the\r\nmeans of bringing Rosamond\'s mother to her bedside. To him she now\r\nwrote, acknowledging the promise which she had made on leaving West\r\nWinston to communicate the result of their search for the Myrtle Room;\r\nand informing him that it had terminated in the discovery of some very\r\nsad events, of a family nature, which were now numbered with the\r\nevents of the past. More than this it was not necessary to say to a\r\nfriend who occupied such a position toward them as that held by Mr.\r\nOrridge.\r\n\r\nRosamond had written the address of this second letter, and was\r\nabsently drawing lines on the blotting-paper with her pen, when she\r\nwas startled by hearing a contention of angry voices in the passage\r\noutside. Almost before she had time to wonder what the noise meant,\r\nthe door was violently pushed open, and a tall, shabbily dressed,\r\nelderly man, with a peevish, haggard face, and a ragged gray beard,\r\nstalked in, followed indignantly by the head waiter of the hotel.\r\n\r\n"I have three times told this person," began the waiter, with a\r\nstrong emphasis on the word "person," "that Mr. and Mrs. Frankland--"\r\n\r\n"Were not at home," broke in the shabbily dressed man, finishing the\r\nsentence for the waiter. "Yes, you told me that; and I told you that\r\nthe gift of speech was only used by mankind for the purpose of telling\r\nlies, and that consequently I didn\'t believe you. You _have_ told a\r\nlie. Here are Mr. and Mrs. Frankland both at home. I come on business,\r\nand I mean to have five minutes\' talk with them. I sit down unasked,\r\nand I announce my own name--Andrew Treverton."\r\n\r\nWith those words, he took his seat coolly on the nearest chair.\r\nLeonard\'s cheeks reddened with anger while he was speaking, but\r\nRosamond interposed before her husband could say a word.\r\n\r\n"It is useless, love, to be angry with him," she whispered. "The quiet\r\nway is the best way with a man like that." She made a sign to the\r\nwaiter, which gave him permission to leave the room--then turned to\r\nMr. Treverton. "You have forced your presence on us, Sir," she said\r\nquietly, "at a time when a very sad affliction makes us quite unfit\r\nfor contentions of any kind. We are willing to show more consideration\r\nfor your age than you have shown for our grief. If you have any thing\r\nto say to my husband, he is ready to control himself and to hear you\r\nquietly, for my sake."\r\n\r\n"And I shall be short with him and with you, for my own sake,"\r\nrejoined Mr. Treverton. "No woman has ever yet had the chance of\r\nsharpening her tongue long on me, or ever shall. I have come here to\r\nsay three things. First, your lawyer has told me all about the\r\ndiscovery in the Myrtle Room, and how you made it. Secondly, I have\r\ngot your money. Thirdly, I mean to keep it. What do you think of\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I think you need not give yourself the trouble of remaining in the\r\nroom any longer, if your only object in coming here is to tell us what\r\nwe know already," replied Leonard. "We know you have got the money;\r\nand we never doubted that you meant to keep it."\r\n\r\n"You are quite sure of that, I suppose?" said Mr. Treverton. "Quite\r\nsure you have no lingering hope that any future twists and turns of\r\nthe law will take the money out of my pocket again and put it back\r\ninto yours? It is only fair to tell you that there is not the shadow\r\nof a chance of any such thing ever happening, or of my ever turning\r\ngenerous and rewarding you of my own accord for the sacrifice you have\r\nmade. I have been to Doctors\' Commons, I have taken out a grant of\r\nadministration, I have got the money legally, I have lodged it safe at\r\nmy banker\'s, and I have never had one kind feeling in my heart since I\r\nwas born. That was my brother\'s character of me, and he knew more of\r\nmy disposition, of course, than any one else. Once again, I tell you\r\nboth, not a farthing of all that large fortune will ever return to\r\neither of you."\r\n\r\n"And once again I tell _you_," said Leonard, "that we have no desire\r\nto hear what we know already. It is a relief to my conscience and to\r\nmy wife\'s to have resigned a fortune which we had no right to possess;\r\nand I speak for her as well as for myself when I tell you that your\r\nattempt to attach an interested motive to our renunciation of that\r\nmoney is an insult to us both which you ought to have been ashamed to\r\noffer."\r\n\r\n"That is your opinion, is it?" said Mr. Treverton. "You, who have lost\r\nthe money, speak to me, who have got it, in that manner, do\r\nyou?--Pray, do you approve of your husband\'s treating a rich man who\r\nmight make both your fortunes in that way?" he inquired, addressing\r\nhimself sharply to Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly I approve of it," she answered. "I never agreed with\r\nhim more heartily in my life than I agree with him now."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mr. Treverton. "Then it seems you care no more for the loss\r\nof the money than he does?"\r\n\r\n"He has told you already," said Rosamond, "that it is as great a\r\nrelief to my conscience as to his, to have given it up."\r\n\r\nMr. Treverton carefully placed a thick stick which he carried with him\r\nupright between his knees, crossed his hands on the top of it, rested\r\nhis chin on them, and, in that investigating position, stared steadily\r\nin Rosamond\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I rather wish I had brought Shrowl here with me," he said to himself.\r\n"I should like him to have seen this. It staggers _me_, and I rather\r\nthink it would have staggered _him_. Both these people," continued Mr.\r\nTreverton, looking perplexedly from Rosamond to Leonard, and from\r\nLeonard back again to Rosamond, "are, to all outward appearance,\r\nhuman beings. They walk on their hind legs, they express ideas readily\r\nby uttering articulate sounds, they have the usual allowance of\r\nfeatures, and in respect of weight, height, and size, they appear to\r\nme to be mere average human creatures of the regular civilized sort.\r\nAnd yet, there they sit, taking the loss of a fortune of forty\r\nthousand pounds as easily as Croesus, King of Lydia, might have taken\r\nthe loss of a half-penny!"\r\n\r\nHe rose, put on his hat, tucked the thick stick under his arm, and\r\nadvanced a few steps toward Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I am going now," he said. "Would you like to shake hands?"\r\n\r\nRosamond turned her back on him contemptuously.\r\n\r\nMr. Treverton chuckled with an air of supreme satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Leonard, who sat near the fire-place, and whose color was\r\nrising angrily once more, had been feeling for the bell-rope, and had\r\njust succeeded in getting it into his hand as Mr. Treverton approached\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ring, Lenny," said Rosamond. "He is going of his own accord."\r\n\r\nMr. Treverton stepped out into the passage--then glanced back into the\r\nroom with an expression of puzzled curiosity on his face, as if he was\r\nlooking into a cage which contained two animals of a species that he\r\nhad never heard of before. "I have seen some strange sights in my\r\ntime," he said to himself. "I have had some queer experience of this\r\ntrumpery little planet, and of the creatures who inhabit it--but I\r\nnever was staggered yet by any human phenomenon as I am staggered now\r\nby those two." He shut the door without saying another word, and\r\nRosamond heard him chuckle to himself again as he walked away along\r\nthe passage.\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterward the waiter brought up a sealed letter addressed\r\nto Mrs. Frankland. It had been written, he said, in the coffee-room of\r\nthe hotel by the "person" who had intruded himself into Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrankland\'s presence. After giving it to the waiter to deliver, he had\r\ngone away in a hurry, swinging his thick stick complacently, and\r\nlaughing to himself.\r\n\r\nRosamond opened the letter.\r\n\r\nOn one side of it was a crossed check, drawn in her name, for Forty\r\nThousand Pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the other side were these lines of explanation:\r\n\r\n     "Take your money back again. First, because you and your\r\n     husband are the only two people I have ever met with who are\r\n     not likely to be made rascals by being made rich. Secondly,\r\n     because you have told the truth, when letting it out meant\r\n     losing money, and keeping it in, saving a fortune. Thirdly,\r\n     because you are _not_ the child of the player-woman.\r\n     Fourthly, because you can\'t help yourself--for I shall leave\r\n     it to you at my death, if you won\'t have it now. Good-by.\r\n     Don\'t come and see me, don\'t write grateful letters to me,\r\n     don\'t invite me into the country, don\'t praise my\r\n     generosity, and, above all things, don\'t have any thing more\r\n     to do with Shrowl.\r\n\r\n     ANDREW TREVERTON."\r\n\r\nThe first thing Rosamond did, when she and her husband had a little\r\nrecovered from their astonishment, was to disobey the injunction which\r\nforbade her to address any grateful letters to Mr. Treverton. The\r\nmessenger, who was sent with her note to Bayswater, returned without\r\nan answer, and reported that he had received directions from an\r\ninvisible man, with a gruff voice, to throw it over the garden wall,\r\nand to go away immediately after, unless he wanted to have his head\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nMr. Nixon, to whom Leonard immediately sent word of what had happened,\r\nvolunteered to go to Bayswater the same evening, and make an attempt\r\nto see Mr. Treverton on Mr. and Mrs. Frankland\'s behalf. He found\r\nTimon of London more approachable than he had anticipated. The\r\nmisanthrope was, for once in his life, in a good humor. This\r\nextraordinary change in him had been produced by the sense of\r\nsatisfaction which he experienced in having just turned Shrowl out of\r\nhis situation, on the ground that his master was not fit company for\r\nhim after having committed such an act of folly as giving Mrs.\r\nFrankland back her forty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n"I told him," said Mr. Treverton, chuckling over his recollection of\r\nthe parting scene between his servant and himself--"I told him that I\r\ncould not possibly expect to merit his continued approval after what\r\nI had done, and that I could not think of detaining him in his place\r\nunder the circumstances. I begged him to view my conduct as leniently\r\nas he could, because the first cause that led to it was, after all,\r\nhis copying the plan of Porthgenna, which guided Mrs. Frankland to the\r\ndiscovery in the Myrtle Room. I congratulated him on having got a\r\nreward of five pounds for being the means of restoring a fortune of\r\nforty thousand; and I bowed him out with a polite humility that half\r\ndrove him mad. Shrowl and I have had a good many tussles in our time;\r\nhe was always even with me till to-day, and now I\'ve thrown him on his\r\nback at last!"\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Treverton was willing to talk of the defeat and dismissal\r\nof Shrowl as long as the lawyer would listen to him, he was perfectly\r\nunmanageable on the subject of Mrs. Frankland, when Mr. Nixon tried to\r\nturn the conversation to that topic. He would hear no messages--he\r\nwould give no promise of any sort for the future. All that he could be\r\nprevailed on to say about himself and his own projects was that he\r\nintended to give up the house at Bayswater, and to travel again for\r\nthe purpose of studying human nature, in different countries, on a\r\nplan that he had not tried yet--the plan of endeavoring to find out\r\nthe good that there might be in people as well as the bad. He said the\r\nidea had been suggested to his mind by his anxiety to ascertain\r\nwhether Mr. and Mrs. Frankland were perfectly exceptional human beings\r\nor not. At present, he was disposed to think that they were, and that\r\nhis travels were not likely to lead to any thing at all remarkable in\r\nthe shape of a satisfactory result. Mr. Nixon pleaded hard for\r\nsomething in the shape of a friendly message to take back, along with\r\nthe news of his intended departure. The request produced nothing but a\r\nsardonic chuckle, followed by this parting speech, delivered to the\r\nlawyer at the garden gate.\r\n\r\n"Tell those two superhuman people," said Timon of London, "that I may\r\ngive up my travels in disgust when they least expect it; and that I\r\nmay possibly come back to look at them again--I don\'t personally care\r\nabout either of them--but I should like to get one satisfactory\r\nsensation more out of the lamentable spectacle of humanity before I\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF A NEW LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days afterward, Rosamond and Leonard and Uncle Joseph met\r\ntogether in the cemetery of the church of Porthgenna.\r\n\r\nThe earth to which we all return had closed over Her: the weary\r\npilgrimage of Sarah Leeson had come to its quiet end at last. The\r\nminer\'s grave from which she had twice plucked in secret her few\r\nmemorial fragments of grass had given her the home, in death, which,\r\nin life, she had never known. The roar of the surf was stilled to a\r\nlow murmur before it reached the place of her rest; and the wind that\r\nswept joyously over the open moor paused a little when it met the old\r\ntrees that watched over the graves, and wound onward softly through\r\nthe myrtle hedge which held them all embraced alike in its circle of\r\nlustrous green.\r\n\r\nSome hours had passed since the last words of the burial service had\r\nbeen read. The fresh turf was heaped already over the mound, and the\r\nold head-stone with the miner\'s epitaph on it had been raised once\r\nmore in its former place at the head of the grave. Rosamond was\r\nreading the inscription softly to her husband. Uncle Joseph had walked\r\na little apart from them while she was thus engaged, and had knelt\r\ndown by himself at the foot of the mound. He was fondly smoothing and\r\npatting the newly laid turf--as he had often smoothed Sarah\'s hair in\r\nthe long-past days of her youth--as he had often patted her hand in\r\nthe after-time, when her heart was weary and her hair was gray.\r\n\r\n"Shall we add any new words to the old, worn letters as they stand\r\nnow?" said Rosamond, when she had read the inscription to the end.\r\n"There is a blank space left on the stone. Shall we fill it, love,\r\nwith the initials of my mother\'s name, and the date of her death? I\r\nfeel something in my heart which seems to tell me to do that, and to\r\ndo no more."\r\n\r\n"So let it be, Rosamond," said her husband. "That short and simple\r\ninscription is the fittest and the best."\r\n\r\nShe looked away, as he gave that answer, to the foot of the grave, and\r\nleft him for a moment to approach the old man. "Take my hand, Uncle\r\nJoseph," she said, and touched him gently on the shoulder. "Take my\r\nhand, and let us go back together to the house."\r\n\r\nHe rose as she spoke, and looked at her doubtfully. The musical box,\r\ninclosed in its well-worn leather case, lay on the grave near the\r\nplace where he had been kneeling. Rosamond took it up from the grass,\r\nand slung it in the old place at his side, which it had always\r\noccupied when he was away from home. He sighed a little as he thanked\r\nher. "Mozart can sing no more," he said. "He has sung to the last of\r\nthem now!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say \'to the last,\' yet," said Rosamond--"don\'t say \'to the\r\nlast,\' Uncle Joseph, while I am alive. Surely Mozart will sing to\r\n_me_, for my mother\'s sake?"\r\n\r\nA smile--the first she had seen since the time of their\r\ngrief--trembled faintly round his lips. "There is comfort in that," he\r\nsaid; "there is comfort for Uncle Joseph still, in hearing that."\r\n\r\n"Take my hand," she repeated softly. "Come home with us now."\r\n\r\nHe looked down wistfully at the grave. "I will follow you," he said,\r\n"if you will go on before me to the gate."\r\n\r\nRosamond took her husband\'s arm, and guided him to the path that led\r\nout of the church-yard. As they passed from sight, Uncle Joseph knelt\r\ndown once more at the foot of the grave, and pressed his lips on the\r\nfresh turf.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, my child," he whispered, and laid his cheek for a moment\r\nagainst the grass before he rose again.\r\n\r\nAt the gate, Rosamond was waiting for him. Her right hand was resting\r\non her husband\'s arm; her left hand was held out for Uncle Joseph to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n"How cool the breeze is!" said Leonard. "How pleasantly the sea\r\nsounds! Surely this is a fine summer day?"\r\n\r\n"The calmest and loveliest of the year," said Rosamond. "The only\r\nclouds on the sky are clouds of shining white; the only shadows over\r\nthe moor lie light as down on the heather. Oh, Lenny, it is such a\r\ndifferent day from that day of dull oppression and misty heat when we\r\nfound the letter in the Myrtle Room! Even the dark tower of our old\r\nhouse, yonder, looks its brightest and best, as if it waited to\r\nwelcome us to the beginning of a new life. I will make it a happy life\r\nto you, and to Uncle Joseph, if I can--happy as the sunshine we are\r\nwalking in now. You shall never repent, love, if _I_ can help it, that\r\nyou have married a wife who has no claim of her own to the honors of a\r\nfamily name."\r\n\r\n"I can never repent my marriage, Rosamond, because I can never forget\r\nthe lesson that my wife has taught me."\r\n\r\n"What lesson, Lenny?"\r\n\r\n"An old one, my dear, which some of us can never learn too often. The\r\nhighest honors, Rosamond, are those which no accident can take\r\naway--the honors that are conferred by LOVE and TRUTH."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILKIE COLLINS\'S NOVELS.\r\n\r\nHARPER\'S\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED LIBRARY EDITION.\r\n\r\n_12mo, Cloth, $1 50 per Volume._\r\n\r\nWITH STEEL PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR BY HALPIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the visit of Mr. WILKIE COLLINS to this country, Messrs.\r\nHARPER & BROTHERS have the pleasure of announcing a New Library\r\nEdition of the Works of this popular novelist, embellished with many\r\nillustrations by English and American artists--some of which have been\r\ndrawn expressly for this edition--and with a New Portrait of the\r\nauthor, engraved on Steel by HALPIN. One volume will be issued each\r\nmonth until the completion of the series. The convenient size of the\r\nvolumes will commend this tasteful edition to the favor of American\r\nreaders, among whom the author of "No Name," "The Woman in White,"\r\n"Man and Wife," and "The New Magdalen," is no less widely known than\r\namong his own countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilkie Collins has no living superior in the art of constructing a\r\nstory. Others may equal if not surpass him in the delineation of\r\ncharacter, or in the use of a story for the development of social\r\ntheories, or for the redress of a wrong against humanity and\r\ncivilization; but in his own domain he stands alone, without a rival.\r\n* * * He holds that "the main element in the attraction of all stories\r\nis the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise." Other\r\nwriters had discovered this before Collins; but, recognizing the\r\nclumsiness of the contrivances in use by inferior authors, he essays,\r\nby artistic and conscientious use of the same materials and similar\r\ndevices, to captivate his readers.--_N. Y. Evening Post._\r\n\r\nWe can not call to mind any novelist or romancer of past times whose\r\nconstructive powers fairly can be placed above his. He is a literary\r\nartist, and a great one too, and he always takes his readers with\r\nhim.--_Boston Traveller._\r\n\r\nOf all the living writers of English fiction, no one better\r\nunderstands the art of story-telling than Wilkie Collins. He has a\r\nfaculty of coloring the mystery of a plot, exciting terror, pity,\r\ncuriosity, and other passions, such as belongs to few if any of his\r\n_confr\xc3\xa8res_, however much they may excel him in other respects. His\r\nstyle, too, is singularly appropriate--less forced and artificial than\r\nthe average modern novelist.--_Boston Transcript._\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE NEW MAGDALEN.\r\n     BASIL.\r\n     HIDE-AND-SEEK.\r\n     NO NAME.\r\n     THE DEAD SECRET.\r\n     POOR MISS FINCH.\r\n     ARMADALE.\r\n     MAN AND WIFE.\r\n     THE MOONSTONE.\r\n     THE WOMAN IN WHITE.\r\n     QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARPER & BROTHERS also publish a Cheap Edition of\r\nWILKIE COLLINS\'S Novels:\r\n\r\n     ARMADALE            Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     ANTONINA                             8vo, Paper, 50c.\r\n     MAN AND WIFE        Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     THE MOONSTONE       Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     NO NAME             Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     POOR MISS FINCH     Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     THE WOMAN IN WHITE  Illustrated      8vo, Paper, $1 00.\r\n     THE NEW MAGDALEN                     8vo, Paper, 50c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY HARPER & BROTHERS, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sent by mail, postage prepaid, to any part of the United States,\r\non receipt of the price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD LYTTON\'S WORKS.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nHARPER & BROTHERS, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is there uniting in one person the imagination, the passion, the\r\nhumor, the energy, the knowledge of the heart, the artist-like eye,\r\nthe originality, the fancy, and the learning of Edward Lytton Bulwer?\r\nIn a vivid wit--in profundity and a Gothic massiveness of thought--in\r\nstyle--in a calm certainty and definitiveness of purpose--in\r\nindustry--and, above all, in the power of controlling and regulating,\r\nby volition, his illimitable faculties of mind, he is unequaled--he is\r\nunapproached.--EDGAR A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
